<Title>“Would be nice, but one major drawback...”
<Content>I was here last summer with my mom, and we were looking forward to staying at this what seemed to be (and was!) gorgeous resort. It is located on beautiful Makena beach, known for many turtles to go around, which is great for snorkeling. I would be happy to give four or five stars, but one lady named Michelle at the front desk was unacceptably rude. Also, the pool was closed during our stay. The beach is great, but this resort has 2 beautiful pools that were under remodeling. This wasn't anyone at the front desk's fault, except for the fact that we told Michelle that we went on the site, looked thoroughly, and couldn't find that it said anywhere that they were under remodel for the pools. The problem was that she kept saying that it was on the site before she even checked. She was stubborn and kept saying it was on there without being helpful. Beautiful resort with a rude front desk attendant. We switched resorts.

<Title>“I LOVE the Makena Beach and Golf Resort”
<Content>First let me say that Malauka Beach is my favorite on Maui, so when staying in a hotel, there is no better place for me. I do not need a glamorous hotel, nothing big and flashy - I prefer understated and with the spirit of aloha. This is the place to be! the rooms have been refurbished nicely, and that halps. The other things I like about the Makena: The rate is the rate...no add ons for every little thing. If you are comparing to other S. Maui properties, at Makena valet parking and "the resort" are included. No resort of valet parking fees. The view from my room....whales jumping - couldn't have been more beautiful! The beach chairs...my favorite beach in the world and nice loungers set up for me....awesome! The LARGE windows and double sliding glass doors so I could have lots of fresh Maui air. I have stayed for both business and pleasure. When staying for business with appointments in town, it is a bit out of the way, but so worth it!

<Title>“Dream vacation”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at this wonderful resort from March 2nd until March 10th 2012 and we absolutelty loved it. It was in a great location, on beautiful grounds with amazing scenery and had a fantastic beach!!! Our entire experience at Makena was top notch, from the accomodations to the food. It was what we had dreamed our stay in Maui would be like, but it was the people at the resort that made it extra special. To start, Thomas and the gang at the valet services were amazing!!! Ron, at the front desk was probably the best we have ever met at his role. He was just awesome and so too were the lovely ladies who worked the front desk with him. Fe, at the concierge desk was informative and very helpful and made booking our excursions easy and fun! Last, but certainly not least, were the terrific servers at the restaurants, and the wonderful cleaning staff who did an excellent job everyday. They all made our trip to Maui special and made us feel relaxed and at home. We will definitley be staying at Makena again when we return for our next visit!

<Title>“Beautiful, Family-Friendly Resort!”
<Content>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Makena. We travelled with family and our 1-year old and found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. Here are some highlights: Pros: -The hotel is situated on a beautiful sandy beach with a tropical garden in the middle. -Spacious oceanview rooms with comfortable beds and nice linens -Free mini golf and croquet available to guests -Friendly staff -Great snorkelling on the beach -Close to Wailea (shopping and food) and snorkelling beaches -Two pools: a deep one for adults and a shallow one (4 feet) for families with young children. -Family-friendly: lots of babies and young children Cons: -The rooms are a little bit outdated, but still nice. Tips: -There is a washer and dryer available to all guests. $2 per wash and $1.50 per dry and although there is a coin machine for soaps, you can save money bringing your own. -If you can find a package breakfast deal online, do it! The food was amazing. There are always fruits, cereals, omlettes, waffles and pastries available and the meats and other specials change daily. (High chairs available for the little ones.) -If travelling with a baby, they will provide a crib (with sheet and bumper pad) at no extra cost. This was very convenient for us. (Baby items that we couldn't bring and the hotel didn't provide we rented from www.easytravelhi.com and had a good experience with them.) -Children can feed the coi fish at the pool in the morning (just ask the breakfast hostess for a small baggie of fish food). -The golf club house has a restaurant with good food at reasonable prices and is convenient since it is just a couple of minutes up the road. An overall wonderful experience with this hotel. :)

<Title>“Every room is an Oceanview room”
<Content>The way that the hotel is angled and built, every room ends up having an ocean view. Every room also has a balcony. I loved sleeping with the terrace doors open and sleeping to the sounds of waves and sitting outside and watching whales. The staff is incredibly helpful and accommodating. The hotel atrium is nice with a large garden in the middle with coy ponds. I really liked that Makena was the last hotel on what I call "resort row". It was 2 minutes from Wailea, and when you came back to the hotel, it was nice to be away from it all.

<Title>“Aloha Maui”
<Content>A world class resort destination set upon a beautiful sandy beach. The Makena Beach and Golf Resort staff could not have been more professional and accommodating. There is a handy resort shuttle, several excellent restaurants, a pillow menu, and turn down service. The Executive Chef Marc McDowell works his culinary magic with fresh ingredients directly from his hotel organic garden and beyond. The renovations include a beautiful atrium garden with water features and gorgeous window box foliage off of each roomâ€™s lani. The rooms are fresh and clean. The beds are very comfortable, and did I mention there is a pillow menu. Nice touch! This was a truly memorable stay with every request attended to with the gracious Aloha spirit. Mahalo.

<Title>“Really enjoyed our stay at Makena”
<Content>This is the very last resort on the south side of Maui, so itâ€™s quiet and not too crowded. It was recently remodeled and looks great; the center section with koi ponds and trees/plants is stunning. It seems like theyâ€™ve done away with the resort fee, although the website is a little confusing on that subject. The service was very friendly, from Ron at the front desk, to our housekeeper, to the concierge, to the pool bar staff. Rooms are large and clean with soft beds, a nice patio, and a dorm-sized fridge (that will fit two gallons of milk/water, etc.). The breakfast buffet is $25pp and wasn't included with our room, so we got provisions at the Safeway about 15 minutes away and ate on our balcony every morning. We only had one meal at the resort, sandwiches from the pool bar, and the food was good. We noticed that the same food on the room service menu was $2 more plus the delivery fee and tip. Housekeeping will bring bottles of water every day. Wifi is not free - $15/day! But there is free wifi at the Starbucks in the Safeway center; I lurked outside and downloaded my mail every few days. Guest laundry is $2 to wash, $1.50 to dry, $0.75 for soap â€“ quarters available at the front desk â€“ although the dryers didnâ€™t seem to work well. Bathrooms are stocked with Tommy Bahama amenities. Thereâ€™s a separate tub and shower with a clothesline above the tub - handy for wet swimsuits. We had a maintenance issue during our stay that the staff responded to and fixed very quickly. Bring your workout clothes because the fitness center is excellent. Itâ€™s brand new, clean, spacious, and stocked with the very latest equipment. Best hotel gym Iâ€™ve ever seen. The beach is fantastic and has complimentary lounge chairs, first come first served.

<Title>“The phoenix has risen. A visit after the renovation of 2011”
<Content>Having stayed here during the renovation last year, it was quite a pleasant surprise to see how well the place turned out. The staff could not have been more attentive and friendly, it's clear this is an organization that values and instils customer service within it's employees. The place looked great after the rooms had been redone and a fresh coat of paint really spiffed up the exterior. Even the gardens and grounds look better maintained than ever. The Sushi restaurant has since closed (not lasting long) which is a good thing. Two very small changes that made a difference (one good the other not so). 1) The rooms use to have two doors one on the outside the other (which has slats) used to keep things secure yet allow a beautiful Hawaiian breeze to naturally cool the room 2) They now offer a breakfast buffet included in the room price which is loaded with healthy choices that included some awesome fresh fruit. Service again was excellent. The beach is still one of the best on Maui! I quiet restful place, stay clear if you wanna party like a rock star.

<Title>“Amazing snorkeling right off the beach”
<Content>My wife and I just came back from 5 days at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort. We had an amazing time. Here is our summary: 1) Hotel - The hotel is nice. Definitely a 4 star hotel. All the staff were amazingly friendly. Big smiles. There is a fitness area but we didnt try it. As other reviewers said the pools are super small. But we did enjoy lounging around the pool during lunch where we ordered food by the pool. The breakfast buffet is okay. Omellette station, fresh fruit, cereal, breads, etc. But honestly after day 4 I was pretty tired of it. Didnt eat at the restaurant during the evenings. 2) Location - This is where the hotel really stands out. There is an amazing beach right in front of the hotel. The snorkeling is amazing. Reefs right off the beach. You can see turtles, eels, amazing colored fish. The beach is not busy at all. Mornings are the best to snorkel. If you are into snorkeling you cant beat this location. You can also drive 10 mins to the Underwater Reserve where the snorkeling is fantastic (the bay at the second parking lot). We also saw lots of whales breaching from the beach. That was pretty cool. Wailea is only 5 mins away and Kihei is 15 mins away. We drove to Kihea a couple nights for dinner. The Coconut Fish Cafe and Cafe 808 (both are reviewed here on tripadvisor) were good. Kahului is about 30 mins away (the city where the airport is). One night we went to the Maui Arts and Cultural Center and saw a ukulele show by Jake Shimabukuro. He was amazing. Do yourself a favor and youtube him and watch it. Another night at the Iao Theater where we saw Grease by local artists. Both were great. On the last day we did drive to Laihana, Kapalua, and Kaanapali to see these other famous areas. All I can say is that I am glad I stayed at the Makena area. Golf - I am an avid golfer. I golfed the Makena course twice. Once with my wife and once as a single. My wife loved the course. The views are amazing. The service is great. The food at the restaurant is really good. I thought the course had amazing potential but needed a lot of tender lovin care. Dont get me wrong I thought the value was good and for most golfers they will enjoy it. But Im a bit of a golf snob. Overall we had an amazing time and cant wait to come back next year. Aloha!

<Title>“We Found Paradise”
<Content>This was one of the nicest resorts we ever stayed at, located near the end of the road just south of Wailea. Your first view of the resort is a wonderfully spacious lobby, and a beautiful atrium garden with waterfalls, ponds and luscious tropical plants. Extremely friendly personnel make your check-in a breeze. The fact that we were upgraded to an ocean view made it even more special. The large rooms are everything you expect from a first class resort. The resortâ€™s biggest amenity is its location. The beautiful beach is the envy of south Maui. Most snorkel trips travel to this beach because of the great abundance of sea creatures, including octopi, turtles and eels. Truly some of the best snorkeling Iâ€™ve personally ever enjoyed. The pool is simple but very inviting, and the waitstaff will take care of everything you need. We enjoyed the Friday night seafood buffet, and the chef personally cut select sushi for us. The golf course offers some of the best views of Molokini on the island, and was a joy to play. We enjoyed a couple of drinks and a wonderful sunset at the â€œCafÃ© on the Greenâ€� after golf. It doesnâ€™t get any better than this. Everyone at this resort was so nice. We will return.

<Title>“A pleasant surprise”
<Content>When arriving at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort in Maui, we were pleasantly surprised. The resort is beautiful, well maintained and peaceful. The building surrounds a beautifully groomed courtyard with a fishpond, waterfall and luscious tropical plants. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a large lanai, overlooking the resort pool and ocean. We stayed in room 328, anything from 330 on would have had an even better view of the ocean, on any floor. There was an entry hall, a spacious closet area with mini fridge and safe underneath. The bathroom had a separate room for toilet area. This is the last resort in that direction on the island and has its own beach area, where very few people come from off the resort. It never felt crowded and was nice and quiet. The pool area is very nice and you can order lunch and sit by the pool or even have your food on the beach. There was free ice water and lemons available all day by the pool, and the workers brought around ice water to us at the pool or at the beach during the day. This was a great idea! We brought our thermal cups and just kept having them refilled with icy cold water all day long. There is a place to rent paddle boards, kayaks, etc right there at the beach. There was no need for us to visit any other beaches on the island as this one was really nice and had everything we needed. The water was great for swimming, paddle boarding etc. We snorkeled off the beach a few times and saw some turtles and fish. There is also a nice golf course at the resort as well. The resort is close to Kihea and many great restaurants and shops. However, it is a bit farther to Lahaina or Kaanapali area, because of its location at the southeast end of the island. It is probably about a 45 minute drive to Lahaina. Our package included a free breakfast daily at the resort and this was a wonderful meal, filled with everything you could want for breakfast, from omelets, to pancakes and french toast, to pastries and fruit. We filled up on breakfast each day! The lunches at the poolside were very tasty as well, with sandwiches or salads. We did not eat supper at the resort. There is a nice fitness room as well if you are inclined to try and keep in shape while on holidays! Walks along the beach are good for that too!

<Title>“Maui's best deal on the beach”
<Content>Makena Beach and Golf Resort is an exceptional facility with a great beach and helpful staff. The resort is located 10 minutes from the busy Kihei strip and has a relaxing atmosphere. If you are looking for "happy hour" type of bars and the typical shopping mini superstores you will not find them here. You will have to take the drive to Kihei. Golf courses in the area are the best in Hawaii and the resort golf course is one of the finest. Many amenities include 9 hole mini golf (putting) and tours facilitated through the front desk. The rooms are all waterview and they are quite large with comfortable furnishings, a small fridge and ample lanai for evening relaxing time. The breakfast buffet is quite good with some waiting times if you get there between 9-10 am. The Makena Grill restaurant has excellent food and it is priced no different than anywhere else in the area. The buffet at dinner is $43 per person but well worth it. Hawaii in general is expensive. Turtles swim in the rocks and coral reefs right in front of the resort and everyone including those who are not the best swimmers can enjoy the snorkeling with the turtles. One of the nicest beaches in the area is right here.

<Title>“Has potential to be a nice hotel / property...”
<Content>Pros: 1) Staff extremely nice 2) Happy Hour is a good deal (go to golf course via hotel shuttle from 4:30 - 5:30...get Mai Tai and Sliders...amazing...view of golf course and ocean can't be beat...then go to hotel restaurant from 5:30 - 6:30 for same $6 dollar deals...) 3) Shuttle service to Wailea shops are nice. 4) Beach is nice and secluded 5) Balcony is nice size and overlooks Ocean which is probably 400 feet away. Cons: 1) Gift shop was closed and Starbucks closes around 6pm...Starbucks should be open until at least 10pm 2) Golf course seemed to be dried out / not in great shape 3) Hotel pool is a joke...it is basically a kids circular pool...if you have a pool in your backyard, it is probably bigger and warmer than the hotel pool...and NO jacuzzi...really?! WTF? 4) Beds aren't that comfy. Rooms have been updated and yet the decor is still cheap...especially the bathroom. 5) Restaurant's hotel food is mixed...breakfast was good yet expensive ($25). Dinner was mixed as well...stay clear of the Eggplant Parm...boring at best. In short, due to its location aka not near anything of substance, the hotel has a great opportunity to get all of your dollars...it should have great facilities so you want to spend all your money there vs. going to the Shops at Wailea for dinner / drinks, etc. Facilities are big time out dated but at least it seems like they are working on updating some of the things...UPDATE THE POOL AREA...BEYOND WEAK...Thought I was staying at a Days Inn in Florida.

<Title>“Away from resort madness”
<Content>The best snorkeling on Maui is from Maluaka Beach and south. The waters are calm right off the resort's private beach and you see amazing coral and tons of fish! As others have said, the staff was very friendly and the rooms spacious and comfortable. Puffy down pillows and high thread count sheets! We fell asleep to the ocean waves every night from the open lanai doors - no loud music or squawking myna birds woke us! An incredible breakfast buffet (omelets made to order!) was part of our room price. We especially like that it is not right in the chaos of Wailea resorts. We will return. Some mentioned that it's a bit pricey but we found it to be the least expensive beach front resort on West Maui & the Wailea area.

<Title>“Friendly staff, great services, albeit pricey.”
<Content>The Good: - First and foremost: their commitment to the environment! I love the compostable cups and silverware! That alone trumps the other resorts in the area in my book! - The staff couldn't be more friendly! With the exception of 1 surly bartender at the restaurant, everyone went out of their way to be pleasant and accommodating. Housekeeping staff was downright awesome! - They have a seamstress on site who can do easy jobs in 24 hours, which was a great help while I was on a business trip there. - If you have a late flight and you choose to check out at noon, they have the option to use a hospitality room for 30 minutes at a time all day long to shower and dress in privacy. Such a great, great feature! - The food was great at every meal I had with one exception (extra rare burger when I ordered medium was a bummer). - The beach is clean, private and simply gorgeous. At this time of year, you can sit there and watch the whales frolicking as the sun sets. Just amazing! - The pool was very clean and well kept. - Tommy Bahama toiletries were perfect for the island feel! I usually don't use hotel shampoos or soaps but these were great! - The bed, desk, porch and lounge chairs were top notch with great linens and pillows! - Coffee pot with Starbucks brew, full ironing board with iron and a strong hair dryer were simply godsends! The Bad - Their much touted Sunday brunch was not nearly as spectacular as the Grand Wailea's brunch down the street. I would recommend there instead. - Pina Coladas & Mai Thais are $10 and there is very little alcohol in them. Lots of filler and pre mix. - No hot tub or steam room which I would think would be expected as part of any resort on the island. - Not on the bus line. However, you can take the hotel shuttle to the mall where you can pick it up. - The structure of the building looks dated even though lots of renovations have been done to spruce it up. My room was clean and well decorated so I didn't mind at all! - The porch furniture was pretty dated but still in good working condition. The Ugly - The room price is pretty expensive but as Maui resorts go, I guess that is expected. -The meals will run you about $40-50 per person with an entree and 1 glass of wine or cocktail. - The doors are so stiff and difficult to open that you literally have to set down your packages/bags and push/pull with great force to get them open. I am sure there is a reason for it but every day I had to do it with all my business gear was kind of a pain. Overall, I had a great experience here while I was on assignment in Hawaii. I wasn't paying for it though so I can be less picky. I would suggest this for travelers who are visiting Maui and looking for a hotel with a good set of amenities and a little luxury. It's not the Grand Wailea or the Four Seasons but it's a really nice hotel if you're willing to spend $300/night.

<Title>“Nice Building, Nice Location, Lacks "software"”
<Content>The "hardware", meaning physical building, surroundings, facilities,etc, all very nice but I found the "software", the human touch that sets apart a great hotel from good hotels generally missing. The rooms were spacious, the lobby airy and the grounds well kept. The pool is small but who wants to swim in the pool when the beach is so near! And the beach seems to be one of the calmer ones with smaller waves compared to other beaches that we visited. Lots of well kept grounds to explore and find your own quite corner without feeling crowded. So why am I giving it 3 stars? The "human touch" seems lacking (with exception of one bell attendant who was really friendly) - not that the service was bad or anything along the lines - just not "warm" and engaging - I travel the world and maybe it is me, but I feel the difference between "welcome" and welcomed. It seems a tad clinical at the front desk and at the concierge, each time I interacted with them. What surprised me was that I had tiny little ants running all over my computer after 5 mins of resting my computer on the work table (yes, admittedly, I do eat at my computer and it does have crumbs!) First time I have seen ants in a hotel room, and I have stayed in hotels in tropical countries before (comparing the resorts to resorts - hostels aside). But what disappointed me most was that the AC in my room was not working, and upon a feedback on my way out of the hotel in the afternoon, the AC was not fixed when I came back some 4 hrs later- claimed to be fixed but not, and despite a request personally at the front desk to have someone come take a look, it took a call directly to the Duty Manager after some time has elapsed, to get their attention. Turns out, the Balcony door had to be set in a particular position for the sensor to trigger the aircon (why?) and they knew about it, but did not have instructions for the guest on how to position the door just right. It is no wonder they kept asking me "is the balcony door shut" when I compained about the AC not working (yes, it was shut). Anyhow, those little irritants, plus unimaginative breakfasts (free with room), made a nice hotel just a building with nice furnishings.

<Title>“Amazing”
<Content>We stayed at the Makena from February 18 thru the 23rd, what a fantastic time we had. This is our second stay (Maui Prince), and I have to say it is our favorite vacation spot. We started our trip on Oahu, which we enjoyed, but for a romantic, private, and memorable vacation, we feel the Makena is the place. Yes itâ€™s true; you are a bit away from things, but if you are interested in romance with your loved one, why would you want to be around all of the hustle and bustle of a big, overcrowded resort. For my wife and me, we love this quite hotel, the staff is excellent, from valet (Tommy is great) to the front desk, to housekeeping, the service was great. The beach (which is as private as you get on Maui), is excellent, and one of the greatest assets of the Hotel. It is very secluded; the water is great, at times the waves are perfect, at times the snorkeling is the best. For us, it doesnâ€™t get any better. As stated in some other reviews, if you want the excitement and energy of a crowded resort, the Makena is not for you. The pool area is a bit outdated, but who goes to Maui to lay by a pool (my opinion). We enjoyed the breakfast on most days; we also had one dinner on property, which we thought was great. The food by the pool was very good. The negative about the property, as others have mentioned, is that there is just â€œsomethingâ€� missing. My wife and I could not put our finger on it, but there is a lack of energy at the property; however we love the Makena and will certainly be back.

<Title>“A beautiful oasis and beach!”
<Content>I have been to Maui 5 times but every time my family has either stayed in Kihei or Kanaapali. My husband (who has never been to Hawaii) found Makena Beach Resort and we got a good deal (with breakfast buffet included). I had never been past Kihei on the South shore (except for Molokini by boat!). We have found a new gem that we look forward to returning to next time! I was excited to see the renovations, beautiful decor, mini fridge in the room, and the beautiful beach! While most beaches on Maui can have rough surf or rocky bottoms, the beach at the hotel is amazing! It is quiet, never crowded, and includes some of the best boogie boarding waves and snorkeling (you can see turtles within minutes of jumping in the water). I also saw many whales from the beach (which distracted me from finishing the Hunger Games triology!). The bed was extremely comfortable, the staff was very friendly and accommodating, and the breakfast buffet was delicious! The only things keeping this resort from being great are having a better pool area, staff being more attentive during breakfast (on our last day a waiter didn't bring us coffee or anything we requested for a looong time..), and having some more dining options at the poolside. One day my husband went to the pool bar to get some food and the staff snapped at him during a busy lunch hour (it seemed like they were understaffed). We just started to go to Kihei for lunch instead when we stayed at the beach. In the future, we will probably bring cold cuts to put into the fridge.

<Title>“Good hotel - 5 star potential, but not there (yet)”
<Content>This is a very nice hotel, but in the current condition, the best I can give it is a 4. On the plus side: - Rooms are clean and mattresses good, we slept very well â€“ good room size - Almost all rooms have an un-restricted ocean view and balcony - Fitness center is well appointed with good equipment - Public beach just next to hotel with excellent snorkeling and kayaking opportunities right from the beach â€“ we went out and saw turtles and a host of fishes as the reef - Whales visible from our room - Many tour boats start their excursions from the public beach - Golf course next door However, on the down side - Isolated (although they will taxi you to the surrounding area free of charge, but access to some prime beaches nearby is only achieved by walking on the road with no pedestrian options - you are good 7 minute drive from ANYTHING else. Most tours will pick you up from the hotel, but you will be first to be picked up and last to be dropped off) - Spa is not really a spa as you imagine, basically two huts next to beach - Pool area is VERY small, there are 2 small round pools, certainly impossible to do laps in the larger â€œadultâ€� one. - We have to queue and wait for breakfast table every day - Room was not made up one day - Shower controls and idiotic, not marked hot or cold and turn clockwise and anti-clockwise - Pretty sparse, not shops for sundries (although it looked like one was under construction) - Eating establishments in hotel very limited, but the food was OK Really relaxing holiday, but depends on what you want.

<Title>“unique experience”
<Content>We had an amazing time on Magical Maui. There were many highlights but one in particular of note. While staying a Makena Beach and Golf resort. One cloudy morning we were on the beach and noticed a outrigger boat returning. I asked the guest was it fun? They suggested we try going with Jay and Ralph and glad we did. We paddled out hawaii 50 style to the 5 caves and snorkeled. Jay picked out a live pencil urchin and Ralph picked out a live spiny sea urchin. Ralph told us to listen to whales as we snorkeled and sure enough we were able to hear the whales high pitched song as we swam. On our way back from 5 caves we stopped to snorkel again. This time the sun came out and we saw a moray eel and then on the surface Ralph pointed out the most beautiful largest sea turtle i ever seen. Not to scare the turtle but curious we started to slowly swim to each other. while swimming ever slowly closely to each other i could hear the whale song in the background and the sun was out in full color! The Turtle made eye contact and swam really really slowly to me as if almost to kiss my mask! I said to myself recognizing All the elements in play that this is what makes Maui Magical! None of this would of been possible if not for Jay and Ralph of Makena resort! They are both native Maui and we can not thank them enough for sharing that morning with us! It was a high note of our trip to Maui!!!

<Title>“Can't wait to return.”
<Content>We stayed at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort from February 13th to the 20th and had a fabulous time. Previously we had stayed at this resort when it was the Maui Prince and while we loved the location it was in need of some upkeep. When we were able to stay again on this trip we were so excited to see what had been done. The hotel and grounds have definately seen improvements. There seems to be more staff and the service was friendly and consistant. We were greeted each day, from the front desk staff, the breakfast servers and the gardeners with a big smile and an Aloha. The breakfast buffet that was included in our room rate was superb. From made to order omlettes, fresh fruit and waffles and pancakes there was something for everyone. The beach is what keeps bringing us back. Even though the hotel was full the beach was never crowded. My husband and daughter were able to swim out to Turtle Town right from the front of the hotel. The nice surprise this time was the added activities that were available to guests with a variety each day. We went to the "Night Under The Stars" and found the whole experience a lot of fun. Becky was informative, entertaining and enthusiastic. Whether you are a couple or a family there is something for everyone. The location was perfect and the fire and smores just added to the experience. We have only been home for two days and we are already talking about when we can return. My only hope is that with all the improvements to the property they do not raise the rates to the point that we can no longer afford to stay here. This is truly our dream vacation spot.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort for a night on our recent trip to Hawaii. The hotel is amazing; the lobby is gorgeous and the rooms are very nice, spacious and comfortable. The bed was probably one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The hotel is a little remotely located, but there is a small town with some restaurants and shops right by it. It is nice because it is not as crowded as other parts of Maui. The downside for us was that we only had one night in Maui, so it was a little out of the way for seeing all the other sights. (It took us between 45 mins - 1 hour to get to the Iao Valley from here.) However, if you have plenty of time, it really shouldn't be a problem. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Breakfast is served at the cafe downstairs and the selection is really great. It is buffet style and they give you the choice of waffles, bacon, omelettes to order, bagels and other normal breakfast foods, pastries, fruit; there is something for everyone. The one thing I would recommend is to steer clear of their main restaurant (I think it's the grill), it is extremely overpriced and the portions are TINY and just mediocre at best.

<Title>“A Wonderful Surprise”
<Content>We had no intention of saying at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort. I certainly would have thought it was way too far out of the way, and I am not sure I would have trusted a non-name brand hotel site unseen. But when hotelbeds.com or the Royal Laihaina or Chase Ultimate Rewards or all three told me I was bumped to the other side of the island upon my arrival, I was skeptical and, actually quite disappointed. But boy was I wrong. The Makena is fantastic. Actually, I later found out from my cousin (who lives on Maui) that the hotel is her family's favorite on the island .... they've stayed there "plenty" times. The plusses . . . there are many: 1) Very large rooms. We had a king with an ocean view on the fourth floor. I think every room has some view of the ocean, and ours was spectacular. We could see whales out in the distance, folks relaxing on the beach, beautiful sunsets, etc., etc. 2) Very clean rooms. The decor isn't super modern, but it's well cared for. The grohe fixtures were a luxury. 3) The breakfast was fantastic! It was inexplicably included in our reservation. I suppose someone behind my booking was looking out for us. I expected coffee and bagels with a toaster. Rather, it was a full spread of fruits, pastries, oatmeal, cereals, breakfast meats, omelets made to order and more. The location was pleasant too. 4) Wonderful pool! Staff circulated offering water (free) and "would you like some pineapple?" (free) or "would you like some frozen grapes? (free)?" Awesome! They also had great poolside food and bar . . . and staff took orders and delivered to your chaise. Why move? You're on vacation. 5) The beach was just steps away. Not too crowded and great for swimming. Along side is a hut full of all your beach needs. I bought a t-shirt. Again, my cousin considers this one of the best beaches on Maui. 6) Great spa service. My partner and I got massages in the tents facing the beach. 7 Gay friendly. Apparently there is a gay beach nearby. We didn't go, but I suppose that's an option. Everyone at the resort made us feel very welcome. 7) Fantastic staff. Every person walks by greets you warmly. "Aloha! Good Morning!" The concierge helped us with dinner reservations (go to Sansei and Cafe O'Lei), and snorkeling boat tour, and the spa. Waiters seemed naturally very friendly and considerate and made us feel at home. I'm sure there's more. This was really a wonderful hotel for us. What I feared would be a very disappointing trip turned out to be one of our best yet. We'll definitely be back. In fact, my partner said at one point, "Let's make Maui and the Makena our February tradition."

<Title>“A Quiet Getaway”
<Content>I happened to discover this hotel when my original hotel plans were quickly changed upon my arrival to Maui. I was forced to move to another hotel due to the booking agency not confirming our hotel stay. This turned out to work in our favor. Makena Beach & Golf Resort is a gem of a place. The rooms are spacious and the hotel grounds are gorgeous and well maintained. The rooms surround a beautiful tropical scenery with a koi fish pond. The staff are very helpful - specifically the concierge service where they were able to help us with our itinerary and activities. The hotel has wonderful amenities including golf course, gym, wonderful restaurants, pool, shuttle service to the local shops and tennis courts. I highly recommend the massage by the beach. It is by far the best part of staying at the hotel. It seems like the Makena area is a little less touristy than the Lahaina side of Maui. Overall, I would definitely come back to this hotel.

<Content>We've been coming to Makena since 1998. It was great to see the positive changes + room upgrades, but many of the same staff (w/new uniforms etc). All the changes seem to be for the better + the staff , as always, is GREAT! Everyone seems to be trying very hard + its evident in the restaurants, at the beach, pool etc. Now if they fix the pool + hot tubs it will be heavenly. A great location and a good value.

<Title>“Very clean, comfy rooms AND Nice Beach!”
<Content>Makena Beach and Gold Resort is a great hotel for golfing on the quiet side of Maui. Their beach and tennis courts are top notch -- uncrowded, great staff. Their concierge and overall hotel staff are also friendly and polite. The only thing to watch out for if you're staying on this part of the island is that you pretty much have to drive back to the hub (airport area) to get to the main attractions. This adds 30 mins to your travel time, which makes Hana a long day trip. While the island is not that big, 30 mins can be precious if your time is limited. But in terms of the hotel itself, absolutely no complaints! Great value for the money. Get the beachfront massage.

<Title>“Another chill day at Makena Beach on Maui. Meetings nearby if you know Bill W.”
<Content>I stayed at this property when it was the Maui Prince some years ago. Though nice, it is not ostentatious like the Grand Waliea up the street. It was known as a very high-quality experience without flash. That feeling remains. Here's the 411. As I was told, a few years ago it was bought and that company went out of business. It is now owned by Summit. The are spending money on capital improvements and there is no real sign of strife from the buy-out. The week we were the property was booked solid. The interesting part is there was no long lines or lack of room by the pool or on the beach. In fact there was a lack of crowds everywhere. I really liked that. Easy to get in, easy to get out. Almost zero kids there. I REALLY liked that. It does not seem to attract a lot of families and frankly this adds to the serenity on the property. The room is large enough, and is equipped with a coffeemaker and a fridge. I am a freak about bedding and forgot my pillow from home. The bedding is superb and comfortable. The area: I much prefer the Kihei side of Maui. It rarely rains. It has the best beaches. Kihei is really chill. If you stay here, drive down to the end of the road and hit Big Beach and lava flows near La Perouse. It is the perfect place to watch a sunset. The peace of staying at Makena must be weighed against being another 15 minutes away from the hustle-bustle. You can hit the crappy t-shirt shops in La Haina with a 1 hour drive if you must. But the peace of Makena beckons and you may find yourself actually relaxing. You will be nearby some of the best golfing in the world. They have massages at the beach. We had one and the treatment was fabulous, but it was a little cold due to breezes and that detracted from the experience, so I would only do it on a hot day. Now the Spa at the Grand Wailea may have a step up here with their mega-spa. Check their specials. If you know Bill W. there are a ton of meetings nearby. Get up early and hit the Kihei Morning Serenity at 7am. The people are warm and welcoming. One of my favs. This property is a bargain at the rate they are charging. It is not flash and glitz. It is quality and peace. Right on Makena Beach and Golf Resort.

<Title>“Lovely Weekend Trip”
<Content>We stayed at Makena Beach and Golf as part of a Get-Away Package. Our accommodations were upgraded from a partial-ocean view to a full-ocean view. The resort was well worth the money, not 5-Star, but definitely a nice resort with friendly, helpful staff. We were especially impressed with the Beach Activities people. They helped us plan our activities and Keani was a wonderful stand-up paddle board instructor. The location is in a quiet area, so the beach and resort never felt crowded.

<Content>We stayed at Makena resort for 9 days (would prefer 2 weeks) and it was beyond our expectations; the view was breathtaking!! Right from the greeting to allowing us a little extra time before we caught our evening return flight. The room service and staff were great and the concierge wonderful and so helpful. Front desk was fully accommodating and the breakfast restaurant staff were as great as the amazing setting by the pond and plants. The pool side staff were fun and friendly (Hi Lucky!) as was the beach staff. We loved getting ice water oceanside!! A special thank you to the friendly knowledgeable and accommodating shuttle service. We are very much looking forward to our next stay... for longer! Mahalo. Aloha from David & Kelly Winnipeg, Canada

<Title>“Saturday evening Japanese Buffet”
<Content>We had heard nice things about the japanese buffet on Saturday evenings. So we drove all the way from the Westin Resort and Spa to try it. We got there when they first opened. Everybody was so very nice. They really tried to make you feel like Ohana. My wife and I were the first ones to go through the buffet line. They had many wonderful choices. I really went for lots of things, but mainly for the shrimp tempura. By the time my wife and I had taken some there wasn't much left.They hadn't made as much as I would have thought. I went back later and they hadn't refilled it. I asked and they brought out a few more pieces. I took some and there was a line for the rest. Our waitress and a couple of the servers made some comments about how much of the shrimp we had eaten and we sure must like it. We finally stopped trying to get them to make more. All the other dishes were very good too. I don't think the $50 per person is too much, if they can keep up with the demand for the food. I would go again if I wasnt made to feel uncomfortable.

<Content>We stayed at the Makena Beach & Golf Resort during our stay on Maui and it was a great choice. The property is gorgeous and our room had a wonderful view of the pool area and the ocean. The room was spacious and had all the amenities. I appreciated the separate shower and having lots of room around the sink for toiletries. The staff was attentive, friendly and always helpful. I especially appreciated the help at the activities desk. Everyone was knowledgeable and found us bargains on tours. A breakfast buffet was included with our room and it was delicious offering made to order omelets, hot and cold cereals, fruits, breads, waffles, etc. A great way to start the day. We also did the Friday night buffet which we enjoyed because of the variety of food. Our favorites were the curry vegetable stuffed mahi mahi and the pineapple bread pudding.

<Title>“Better than expected, but still falling short of good”
<Content>I stayed at Makena for a week in January. I came with a couple of friends who were attending a convention in Wailea, and chose the hotel mainly considering the distance to the Grand Wailea hotel and the price. Prices are extortionary in Wailea. Having visited the other properties and comparing them to Makena Beach and Golf Resort, I actually felt good about my choice. The Vegas-like Wailea hotels are over the top, crowded, and so overdone you would think the beach is just another prop. Makena on the other hand is much more tranquil, natural, and the beach actually looks like a proper nature-made beach. The thing about Makena is that it could be so much better. The architecture is impressive, the grounds are wonderfull, really well kept, and the inner garden is magnificent. Besides that, the hotels design is fairly below average. There's no ambiance whatsoever, the furniture doesn't match, the huge hall looks terribly void and cold, the lighting is airport like. The recent refurbishment did nothing for it. Service is hit and miss, and while most of the staffers are polite and smiley, the ensemble comes across as amateur and far too easy going. The rooms are huge, but to no great effect, as again, they're not properly furnished. There's the quintessentially american wall-to-wall carpeting, wich I found rather horrid, the colonial furniture, and the shabby bathroom, spruced up recently with granite countertops, but leaving the rest unchanged. The bathtub looked especially pathetic. The beds are comfortable enough for one or two nights, but after a week i started having back pain, as the matrasses are rather soft and have the tendency to cave in the middle. The breakfast is nice enough, though there are a number of crucial items missing, like proper butter or anything resembling ham. All in all, I think there is a lot to improve in this property, but unfortunately it seems the owners want it to be a poor man's Grand Wailea instead of the stilishly relaxed haven it could very well be. I do recomend the property based on it's tranquility and the beach, bearing in mind that the although the hotel doesn't by any means deliver a luxury experience, it manages to be more agreable than it's Wailea counterparts.

<Title>“A great stay”
<Content>We are not resort types, but the Makena Beach and Golf Resort was wonderful. We had a partial ocean view room, and it was lovely. Thanks to the peaceful location of the resort we were able to keep our 6 foot wide sliding door open all night to the cool ocean breezes and sounds. Our room looked over the golf course and pool and beautiful flowers. We only ate breakfast at the resort and it was excellent. The breakfast buffet was worth every penny. The resort is located away from the noise and crowds of Kihei which we thoroughly appreciated. Lastly, the staff was unusually helpful and pleasant. Always a smile, and also very efficient. A highly recommended place to stay.

<Title>“Outstanding service”
<Content>The service is what sets the Makena apart from the other resort-themed hotels on Maui. Shell necklaces at check in, cookies in the room, fresh pineapple slices and cold water served poolside and small bags of food to feed the fish at breakfast are a few of the small touches that make a stay at the Makena memorable. The grounds and rooms are nice and breakfast buffet ample. It is on a good stretch of beach and relative isolation gives it a quieter, "old Maui" feel.

<Content>We spent the first 2 days of our 10 day vacation on Maui at this beautiful resort. Our room was a panoramic ocean view and boy was it ever! Amazing views of Molokini, Lanai, sunsets, and whales. Loved listening to the crash of the ocean on the beach during the night. Service was great, golf accommodations superb, grounds beautiful, and the breakfast buffet a delight. We enjoyed the resort so much, when we were notified that our flight home was delayed an 1 1/2 hrs, we went back to Makena to enjoy the pool bar and its surroundings as our final stop.

The rooms were clean, modern and comfortable, and the balcony was a nice touch for those mountain and beach views. Great location / parking not an issue. Only criticism would be that the baths are far too shallow. Huge bathrooms - but tiny bath. I highly recommend the luau.

<Title>“Fantastic Staff”
<Content>Small and quiet. Nice beach. Reasonably priced. What really sets this place apart though is the staff. In my case, I needed a quiet place for a few hours. Without any fuss, they just gave me access to a conference room. The guys at the beach had fun entertaining our kid and telling us old Hawaiian stories. The internet connection, at $25/day is way too expensive. And if you have AT&T for your mobile, you'll be lucky to get 2 bars.

<Title>“Excellent choice for families or singles”
<Content>My wife and I absolutely enjoyed our two day stay at the Makena Beack Resort. Every staff person we encountered took the time to assist us in every way possible. They were well trained and went the extra mile to ensure we were having an excellent visit. The property has recently been totally upgraded. A great beach and all the amenities for a fine resort stay.

<Title>“Beautiful place, the front desk clerks can be a bit crude, but the breakfast buffet is to die for!!”
<Content>I've stayed here four times already, I love it but every time I go it seems the front desk employees are rude and unfriendly outside out checking in. Everything else is great. The staff and hostess in the cafe on the floor level is my favorite place to eat on the island. I'll go back even if I don't stay at the resort.

<Title>“Complete Maui Resort”
<Content>Just returned from a very nice stay at the renovated Maui Beach Resort. The hotel is at the end of the road in West Maui so the setting is quite quiet. That's exactly what we were seeking for a 3 night golf escape. We stayed in a partial ocean view room at the newly renovated hotel -- the room was very spacious with a king bed and adjacent sitting area with sofa, chair and desk. There is a lanai with a table and 2 chairs for sunset watching. We were on the second floor but still had a clear view of the grounds and the ocean. At night, we left the lanai doors open and fell asleep to the sound of the breaking surf. We went to the breakfast buffet every morning before heading out for golf and had a hearty selection of hot and cold items. As we can attest, you can eat breakfast in 15 minutes if you need to, or relax over a leisurely meal. We did both over the 3 days. We didn't have dinner at the hotel as there are many fine restaurants in the nearby Wailea and Kihei neightborhoods. We did stop by the bar on our first evening and left after one drink as it was just a little too quiet. If you don't have a car (or just don't want to drive), the hotel has a shuttle van that will take you to nearby restaurants and golf courses. The selection of golf courses near the hotel is fantastic. There are 3 Wailea courses, the Makena course and the Elleair course in Kihei. All are in top shape and offer slightly different experiences. It's a great way to see some of the best real estate in Maui! And, see whales breaching from some of the higher holes! If you're willing to venture out a little further, there are 4-5 more courses within a 30 minute drive. The service was extremely friendly, from the cold welcoming handtowel at check-in, to the bellmen who always had a smile and greeting. We will definitely be coming back to this hotel on our next Maui trip.

<Title>“Really nice”
<Content>What a great property. I booked just one night via Hotwire for a business trip. Just $158 a night, which is kind of as good as it gets for a three and a half star hotel on Maui, even in November. The place was gorgeous--comfy rooms, nicely kept grounds. Super pretty. Bikes you could check out and ride around the area. Made me wish I were there for vacation and not for business. My only gripe? The resort charge. It seems like lots of hotels these days wind up getting an extra $20 on top of whatever your so-called rate is by charging a resort fee. Not optional, not payable via Hotwire, not advertised in the Hotwire price. If there's a mandatory up-charge when you check in, whatever you paid online is not actually the room rate. Can I get a witness?! Anyway, loved the place. Would go back for sure. Just make sure you factor in the hidden fees.

<Title>“The Outrigger canoe ride was the best experience of my trip”
<Content>I wanted to ride in an outrigger canoe and this was the only place on Maui that provided this experience. I was so excited to find that not only did I get to experience and participate in the outrigger canoe ride, but also had a narrative of the Hawaiian culture given by the star of the theatre play Uleana! Also, we had a snorkel experience with a personal dive instructor whoat was awesome! The turtles were swimming right up to our noses! I did not stay at this resort but it was beautiful and would love to stay here on my next trip.

<Title>“We keep coming back.”
<Content>I write this review with mixed feelings. I really want the MBGR to succeed cause it's a great place, but I want to keep it a secret because it's a wonderful place to get away. I love that it's isolated and away from the maddening crowds. We're from Maui, and when we want to staycation on the South side, MBGR is our only choice. You arrive at the hotel to free valet parking. How nice is that? I was happy to see that the rooms have been renovated quite nicely since our last visit. The facelift done on the property was well done and much needed. The room we had on the 5th floor looks refreshed and chic. My only complaint is that the entry door to the room was hard to open. Normally, that would be so minor, but it really was difficult to open. Looks fantastic, but I can't imagine an elderly person or a mom with a baby in her arms being able to easily open that door. I'm guessing that it's probably a security thing. They got rid of that big tree that used to be in the middle of hotel which has cut down considerably on the bird noise in the morning. The staff here is still wonderful and accomodating. We spent the day at the pool, hanging out. Our server, Linda, was so nice and efficient. We also played put-put golf, badminton, and shuffleboard. All very fun and a nice break from lying around the pool. Dinner was at the Molokini Bar & Grille. Our friends did the seafood buffet, which they loved. The hubby & I ordered off the menu. It was nice to see that their menu options have been expanded. I'm sure that this in part to the closing of the Japanese restaurant next door. My flat iron steak was delicious, cooked exactly to order. My hubby liked his baby back ribs well enough but wasn't wow'd by them. Next morning, we did a light breakfast at the coffee shop downstairs. We left happy, rested, and wondering when we'll be able to come back again. MBGR may not be for you if expect the theme-park/water slide/activities every-hour-on-the-hour experience. Come here to kick back, relax, explore, and enjoy. Aloha!

<Title>“Great resort!”
<Content>Stayed here for my second honeymoon and had a great time. When we arrived the front desk staff were very nice! Ron (front desk staff) was very helpful and friendly, he gave us recommendations about activities and places to eat-mahalo! The rooms are big and nicely decorated and our room had a great view. The bathroom is also comfortable. The hotel has a nice beach with a great view. Cons: the hotel is far from lahaina but it is a nice drive with plenty of places to eat and have fun nearby. The hotel pool needs renovation but maui has so many nice beaches (including the hotel beach) that it is not a problem. We found a great deal for this hotel and will return to stay with them.

<Title>“BEST VALUE ON MAUI”
<Content>If you are looking for action, head to Kaanapali. This is at the end of the higher end resort strip of Wailea. All the best restaurants are so close, hotel provides free shuttle until 9pm to many local shops and restaurants. Had a great view, gorgeous uncrowded beach with excellent snorkeling. Pool is kind of underwhelming but we came for the beach. Quiet and romantic, Starbucks in the lobby closes at 5pm sharp, food is delicious but no real bar scene. Would stay there again for a clean simple room and access to top notch restaurants.

<Title>“Good mid-range resort with great beach”
<Content>Good sized rooms and bathrooms and well maintained communal areas and grounds which front onto a superb beach. The food is OK but overpriced. I think that the hotel is trying to compete with the Grand Wailea and the other big name resorts which are closer to town but it's not really in the same league and needs to get its prices in line with that fact.

<Title>“Rooting for this underdog.”
<Content>Great location, great place, will return. White sandy beach, incredible snorkeling in turtle town which is right THERE. A bit off the beaten path literally and figuratively. You wouldn't want to stay here if you're super status conscious or looking for loads of stuff to do but if you want to get away and enjoy some peace and quiet, this will do nicely. Staff were incredibly nice even though the service was sort of random here and there (nothing egregious but, for example, we ended up with a room of a lower room class than what I paid for and I had to actually negotiate and haggle with the manager to get the rate lowered to the rate advertised online that day...he threw in a total $100 "mad money" credit for the inconvenience; got a knock on the door at 4AM from staff then they once we were awake they muttered "oops wrong room!"--haha maybe it was the manager?; they ran out of beach towels first thing in the morning). What mattered most is that everyone was smiling and seemed genuinely happy to see you. Everyone genuinely meant well. If I had to pick one word for this place it's underdog... Apparently it was almost curtains after being foreclosed so it's nice that it's under new ownership and getting some renovations. While it isn't perfect (see others' comments about the decor and so forth), it means well, it's charming, and you want to see it succeed. So check it out!

<Title>“Christmas Dinner 2011”
<Content>Our family has been coing to Maui for almost 10 years and each time we pick a 'special' place for Christmas dinner. Chose the Makena this year thinking that the re-do and updates would be enjoyable and fresh. We have ben to the Grand, Maui Coast and Fairmount int he past. We thought the Makena would be as good or better. Wrong. Very very wrong. Initally we were directed to the resturant by a helpful staf member. Once at the desk to check in (with reservations) we were taken to our seats. The overall feeling was that of a sports bar, with tvs hanging from the ceiling area. Once seated, the waiter advised us to simply help ourselves to the buffet. No offer of beverages, nothing. Thinking that the busy tourest season had struck, we wrote it off and continued to the buffet. In fairness,, the food was good with good servers where required. But really messy. Slopped searving spoons beside the trays of food sitting in pools of standing mess. Returning to the table, still no beverage service but the employee that had seated us was seen travellng back and forth to the buffet with armloads of clean dishes. then returning with water for tables. Which we were finally offered. Hurriedly. Thats the last time we saw him. Or anyone else. We completed our meal, waiting for our table to be cleared. Never happened. We returned to the buffet collected some desserts and returned to our table. Clearing the table ourselves, piling dirty dishes on top of each other, we completed our mea. No server. No offer of beverage. No table clearing. Still noting the servers running around in what appeared to be a total uncoordinated fashion, it became obvious no one was in charge. It has been a very very very long time since I have been tempted to get up and leave a resturant without paying.This was one of those times. To be frank, I doubt anyone would know! It was that bad. Totally ignored and tcked off, I walked to the bar, asked for the bill, was kept waiting, standing at the bar (guessing that was why the tv was hanging from the roof). Paying the bill, leaving NOTHING for a tip, I collected my family and left. Free parking from the valet service resulted in a 15 minute wait, while they tried to find my car! Save your money. The service is the worst I have ever experenced with no apparent concern for customer satisfaction. To be honest, you get better service at the 808 deli. Not kidding...the Makena was that bad. T.M.

<Title>“Great location but uneven service”
<Content>A great location but the rooms and service are uneven. The resort is south of Wailea on a secluded, beautiful beach, but still close enough to take advantage of the restaurants in Wailea or Kihei. We were told at check-in that the room renovations had been complete. Our room was comfortable with a partial ocean view and a lovely lanai, but the carpet was dirty in several places. Occasionally, we found tiny bugs in the bathroom. Whatâ€™s worse was all the light switches were filthy! Iâ€™ve never experienced that anywhere. We had purchased a package on Expedia that included the breakfast buffet (normally $25pp). The selection was great. Two days we had great service (bringing beverages and removing plates) but the third day we had to ask for coffee after looking for a server for 10 minutes. The service at the pool at lunch time was also poor. (There is nowhere else to eat at the resort at lunch time.) When we first arrived at the pool, the waitperson kept asking us if we wanted to order and we said not yet. When we told her we were ready to order, she forgot about us for about 15 minutes. She also forgot a couple of other things that we requested during the afternoon. We were there in early December and the resort seemed like it had were more staff than guests. Maybe the resort was still getting back to normal after the renovation, but it was a little spooky with only a few people around. In sum, I think I would stay there again because of the location and beach and hope that the service and cleanliness had improved.

<Content>The Hotel was just not like it used to be. Front Desk were pleasant and friendly but that was where it ended. The pool staff were not so nice, the beach concession were outwardly rude and the wait staff in the restaurant were kink of "plastic" with their "aloha". There was some upgrading going on so that may have accounted for the strange atmosphere. Won't bother going back unless I hear it's improved.

<Title>“A lot to like with this resort”
<Content>This is our 3rd stay at Makena B&G Resort and we love the property, location, and the staff. We've stayed in an ocean side room once, and partial ocean view rooms twice. The ocean side rooms are amazing, but you give up little by having a partial ocean view (i.e., the view is still great). We prefer staying in the south wing as the view from your lanai includes the gardens, palms, Pu'u Olai crater, and the sea. In our previous stays, we didn't mind the decor. Since then, the rooms have been modernized, but the new design took away one of the real pluses, the louvered doors that allow the cross breeze at night and the sound of the ocean. It's unfortunate that is gone as we found it too warm to sleep with the sliding doors open, which was a real perk of this beach-side resort. We tried the breakfast buffet for the first time this trip. There was a very wide selection of fruits and breakfast foods in the buffet, but I felt the quality was average, yet reasonable for the package we purchased. The staff is what has made this resort so amazing in the past. The friendliness of the staff is still above average, and maybe because we stayed only two nights this trip, it didn't seem so much so as previous trips. I mentioned location, that starts with the beach next to the hotel. It's one of the best beaches we've visited on the island and with great snorkeling. As a runner, I appreciate the easy access to Makena Alanui Road, which offers a quiet out-and-back course of up to 8 miles on pavement, or farther if you include some trail running. Shortly after passing Big Beach, the course becomes quite scenic as it runs along the ocean through Ahihi Kinau Natural Preserve, eventually reaching La Perouse Bay. Shorter loops can be found by heading towards Makena Landing and beyond. I've also enjoyed a hike up the Pu'u Olai crater which is an easy walk from the hotel. My wife and I enjoy the relatively remote location, however, you are not isolated. The Shops at Wailea are less than 10 minutes away (accessible by hotel shuttle) and include restaurants and shopping. There are also two very nice restaurants -- with live music -- in the Wailea Gateway Center and a few restaurants at nearby golf courses. We've not visited the hotel restaurants with the exception of the breakfast buffet and the pool-side cafe. We find this resort to be an exceptional value, with the only regret being the loss of the louvered doors. It's not a five star resort, with the superficial trappings, it's genuine, friendly, relaxing, and peaceful. If this is what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed.

<Content>If your looking for a very comfortable but peaceful quite place that has everything , then this your place!!!! Stayed here lays week for 6days, couldn't be happier!! If you can try an get the package that includes the breakfast buffet, it's AMAZING!!! Fantastic all you can eat food!!! Just fill up in the morning and your set for the day!!! The size of this resort is perfect!! Just big enough to have pretty much everything but not too big like the mega resorts, and reasonably priced if you get one of the specials. The views from the rooms are stunning, and your just a couple hundred feet from their beach, and just down the road about a mile or two is the marine reserve with some of the best snorkeling on the island,and the snorkel boat that pulls right up on the beach in front of hotel offers excellent service as well. Be sure not to miss the outrigger canoe ride with Jay and Jeff, fantastic experience!!!!! Great ride and very interesting Hawaiian history lesson by Jay and Jeff,, these two guys are great!!! In fact everybody who works here is quite exceptional IMHO,,Russell at front desk was awesome as well as marissa in the breakfast cafe. Come here and you won't Wana go anywhere else!!!

<Title>“Wonderful vacation!”
<Content>We just got back from a week at the Makena Beach & Golf Resort. We had a fabulous time and the hotel fit almost every need. First of all, our room on the 4th floor had an amazing ocean view with West Maui in the background and Lana'i in the far distance (someone mentioned they could see Molokai from a room, but they either mean Molokini, the crater, or Kahoolawe as you can't see Molokai from this part of the island). We fell asleep to the waves every night. The room was very comfortable but know that they get smaller the higher up you go. We did not mind that. We got a beautified' room...the beds were so comfortable, new furnishings, big flat screen tv. There is a 'dated' feel in the room and around the hotel. It's the tile in the bathroom and the flooring throughout. The bluish lighting over the entryway was harsh, compared to the soft amber everywhere else. There were some nice watercolors in the room, but more art would really add to the rooms/hotel. But, if it keeps the prices as reasonable as they were, I'm fine with it. We didn't spend much time in the room, anyway! As everyone mentions, the pool area is small with two circular pools. But it has a nice bar and food service. We enjoyed eating by the pool with the resident cats and taking a quick dip. Since we came without children, who needs the pool anyway? We came for the beach and ocean and Maluaka beach is one of the best. The beach, Maluaka, is perfect. We saw turtles every day and the snorkeling is really good...a variety of fish, including humus, eels, trumpetfish and tons of turtles. This is the beginning of whale season, but in Jan/Feb, you will be able to see the whales off the beach (though some visitors we met saw a few breeching 'next door' in Wailea) .Black sand beach is within walking distance and we also took a short drive south to La Perouse Bay and spent some time at 'secret cove'...Just a gorgeous, unspoiled area. Makena is a very quiet area with a lot of natural beauty...it's about a 45 minute drive to Lahaina/Kaanapali. So, depending on what you want to do on Maui, that could be a consideration. Everyone at this resort was kind, friendly, helpful and we loved the beach guys...Leo, Jeff(?), sorry, I can't remember everyone's name. The people staying at the resort were also nice and laid back. Nobody was fighting over lounge chairs (experiences I've had at the Grand Wailea and Hyatt). I guess we also picked a good time of year to visit as there were no crowds anywhere (kids in school! nice break!). We were a little disappointed in the lack of restaurants here. We loved getting the complimentary buffet breakfast every morning. Great omelettes made while you wait! We also loved the Starbucks with almost 'normal' prices (grande latte $4.25 compared to $6.75 at the Grand Wailea). But, while dinner was a decent meal, we did not like the atmosphere..it felt like we were in a wedding reception hall or convention space. Food in Hawaii is expensive, so we ended up trying various restaurants in the area. If we're going to spend that much money, I personally need a nice atmosphere. BUT, service was always good. We did have some problems at arrival. We were unable to get wifi in our first room so they upgraded us to a room with the above mentioned wonderful view. Unfortunately, we still could not get wifi. We were able to use the ethernet and it was $54 for a week. I wanted to complain but my boyfriend didn't want to as we just got there and were tired. We did not have to pay a resort fee, valet charge ($25-50 a day at other resorts), so we didn't push the issue further and we liked our new view much better and were too tired to change rooms again. But it was annoying. If we pay $54 for wifi, we should have gotten wifi. The other thing that really bugged me was the constant playing of Christmas music! I know it is the holiday season, but I come to Hawaii to hear Hawaiian music...with so many wonderful Hawaiian musicians to choose from, I wish they would have been playing Hapa, Izi, Led Kaapana, etc.. So, overall, I highly recommend this resort if you like quiet, beautiful beaches and being surrounded by unspoiled nature. We will definitely come back. Mahalo nui!

<Title>“Paradise!”
<Content>We loved it here. We got a steal on Travelocity and paid NO resort fee ($25 times 10 days is $250!) plus got a free breakfast everyday. Our room was a "partial" ocean view (which really we felt was a full ocean view), with a big, comfy King sized bed. We had a toddler with us, and the room was big enough for our luggage, my husband's humungous golf club case, and for her to waddle around with books and toys to her delight. Our lanai was great - it had a small wall before the gate started so I was comofrtable with letting her out and walk around without feeling like she may slip through the bars or get her leg caught. The housekeepers also need mentioning here because by the 10th day, they knew our routine and when to clean our room. Everyday they were in there after breakfast but before our girl's nap. Talk about customer service. They also left us extra towels and bottled water which was a super nice touch. My husband used the safe, which was a "choose your own combo" and he loved he didn't have to remember a combo since he chose it. The only thing the room could've used was a microwave. From our room You could hear the ocean, but not the people. It was perfect. ALL of th staff was welcoming, warm, and friendly. When I say ALL I mean the people in the lobby, the housekeepers, the groundskeepers, the bellhops, the concierge, the pool people, the waitors, the people at the beach you rent equipment from... EVERYONE was all smiles there. It was so nice! The breakfast was amazing - eggs, meat, some sides, fresh fruit, yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, personalized omlets, etc. They switched it up each day so breakfast didn't get boring. My toddler loved the fresh fruit and mango yogurt! The servers brought your drinks and cleared your plate since it was all-you-can-eat. Normally, $25 a person, we were super glad to be able to roll out of bed and walk down to breakfast each day. The pool was okay - we are hoping they renovate it. Two round pools but not very kid friendly - one smaller one is 4 feet deep and the other round one is 6 feet. We are hoping they turn the 4 foot into a kiddie pool and maybe add a slide or two to the big one, and add a hot tub. They certainly have the room out there! A ton of seating for tanners. The people out there had towels and offered ice water consistently which was a great touch. Also, my mom, sister, and brother and his family were all in Maui at the same time, and it was so great that they could come over to use our pool! This hotel is one of the few that would allow that. We checked the Fairmont, Grand Wailea, Marriott, and a couple others who absolutely would not let visitors come to use their pool! The pool side cafe was more than reasonably priced for the food portions and the convenience. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and my husband had the club. Our total was $29 after tip. To do a comparison: My brother stayed at the Grand Waila at the same time we were there, and he paid $89 for 3 people to eat, plus two drinks. His food itself was $59. We also tried a Dancing Koi drink, which is an exclusive to this hotel and is award winning. It tastes like heaven and looks like candy. My toddler kept reaching for a drink because she thoght it was a snow cone. Must try if you go! The beach was a skip away from the pool, and again, so convenient and great. You can rent equipment right there, which is what we did, and snorkeled right off the beach. We saw a huge sea turtle and pretty fish! There are chairs out there for you to use, and the sand is so soft! Another thing we loved is their Christmas tree lighting ceremony. The hula dancers came and performed and of course, Santa himself made an appearance. How festive!!! The only things we would've changed: 1) Microwave in the room 2) Plumbing needs some updating (which they're doing now) 3) Would've loved FREE wi-fi 4) Pools Again, these things are small and not a big deal. All in all, we loved it here and can't wait to come back!!!! Best place we've stayed in Hawaii so far, and we've been to Kauai, Big Island, and Maui more than once! Great job!

<Title>“Best Wailea-Makena Area Value”
<Content>Quick summary: Makena Beach & Golf Resort is a good value in a part of Maui (Wailea, Makena) where good values are extremely rare. This is especially true if the Makena is running a special like their recent free breakfast buffet and waived resort fee deal. Opinions based on over a dozen Hawaii trips: 1) Island choice: Even though many folks disregard this busy and densely populated option, you may wish to consider Waikiki if you are on a tight budget and/or have school age children because you can eat relatively inexpensively and kids will probably like it. 2) Maui area choice: On Maui, consider Kaananpali area if you have young kids or teenagers because there is more for them to enjoy there (e.g., long safe beach, most hotels have kidsâ€™ pools and water slides). Consider Wailea-Mackena area if you are older adults looking for a less-crowded and upscale venue. 3) Condo vs. hotel choice: We prefer the amenities available at hotels but you may prefer a condo, e.g., if you have a big family and/or want to buy some groceries avoid eating out. 4) Wailea area hotels: Go for the Four Seasons if you like Caesarâ€™s Palace and bragging about how much money you spent. Go for the Grand Wailea if opulence is important and budget is unimportant. The Fairmont Kea Lani is slightly less opulent, usually a little less expensive, and all rooms are relatively large suites. The best natural beaches that are an easy walk from your hotel are at the Renaissance (which has been closed for years) and Makena. Finally, focus on the Makena: We had stayed here three times while it was the Prince and this was our first stay since it had been through all the financial turmoil and is now owned and managed by some complicated combination of entities including Summit Hotels. Overall, we were very pleased with our experience at the Makena. The good-for-us but bad-for-owners news was that it appeared to be less than 50% full so there were no crowds or waiting in lines, and the staff was very courteous and attentive. Summit and whoever is obviously trying hard to refurbish and upgrade this fundamentally nice property. The work appears to be mostly complete. There is still some work going on, but none of it bothered us, with one small exception: They are moving and changing the bar and restaurant configurations. There was (temporarily?) no inside-the-hotel bar where you could actually sit at the bar, order a drink and snacks, and watch the sunset. You could, however, sit at tables near the bar, which are (were?) in the same basic room as the main hotel dining room. As long as Iâ€™m on the main â€œMolokiniâ€� dining room, I would rate our experience there as mixedâ€¦ entrees, appetizers, and drinks range form fair to good to very good. Prices are a bit less than most Wailea venues but certainly not inexpensive. In case you arenâ€™t aware, there are very good restaurants in the Wailea area, but none are inexpensive or even moderate (e.g., dinner entrees average $35). So if nice but expensive evening meals arenâ€™t your thing, count on driving to Kihei (where there are only a few fast-food and pizza joints, but no nice but inexpensive restaurants of the type you might be used to on the mainland) or staying in a condo with a kitchen (not sure there are any short-term vacation condos in Wailea). The â€œCafÃ© Kiowaiâ€� buffet breakfast was very nice and problem-free, especially since there were no crowds and it was part of a Makena promotional package available while we were there. Lunch items at the pool are good but not cheap. The big advantages of the Makena are the excellent beach, the well-designed structure (I think almost all rooms have at least some view of the ocean), the pretty grounds, the quiet laid-back atmosphere, the lack of pretentiousness, and the good value. Our room looked like it had been recently refurbished, it was nice and fully functional, but I wouldnâ€™t call it opulent. The pool was clean and uncrowned when we were there, but it doesnâ€™t have things like caves and slides that appeal to kids. At the risk of over-generalizing, I think that while the Makena welcomes families with kids of all ages, this property appeals most to adults who prefer a quiet almost serene venue. For us, we like Maui in general and the Wailia-Makena area in particular. When we were there recently, the Makena was far-and-away the best value in that area, and we enjoyed our stay.

<Title>“On the upswing.”
<Content>This place is is in the middle of a renovation which explains the bargin we got on it. It was a great value and it seemed like we had the hotel to ourselves compared with other resorts in the area. Our room was partially renovated with a new living area/bedroom but the bathroom was still out of the early 80's. that was not a big deal at all as we were prepared for the really dated appearance seen in some of the pictures on other sites. The pictures from other reviewers and sites did not do the rooms justice at all. When the full renovation is complete this property will shine. We were given a complimentary ocean-view upgrade. We enjoyed the complimentary Escalade service to local attractions and hotels; nice touches which show this resort is aiming for a five-star rating. The only negative I have is the restaraunt. We went for breakfast twice and the first time not one table was cleared or attempted to be cleared during the entire time we ate. It become pretty gross when birds are flying on the table next to you and landing to eat the eggs off the last person's plate. We thought it might have been a fluke, but when we returned a few days later it was the same scenario, only this time the restaraunt's hostess seemed too overwhelmed to even seat people. It seems like such a small issue that could easily be rectified with a few key hirings and an astute manager. This isn't a deal breaker for the hotel, just an FYI. Otherwise, everyone was very friendly and accomodating. Lucky at the pool bar was great, and the massages above the beach were amazing. this should be a great time to enjoy some of the best of the renovation without the full cost of upgrades. Props for the mock Starbucks in the lobby serving breakfast sandwiches, oatmeal, and quick eats to bring to the beach. Also, the computers in the lobby are super fast, free and a great printer for when you are in need.

<Title>“A Wonderful Place to Get Away From It All!”
<Content>My family and I spent four days at this beautiful resort and did not want to leave! The hotel staff is warm and welcoming. Our suite was magnificent with panoramic ocean views. We fell asleep to the sound of the waves lapping the shore and woke to the cheerful chattering of minah birds. You can snorkel right off the beach and we were immediately joined by a giant sea turtle who did not seem to mind us swimming alongside him! One morning we got up early and boarded a catamaran for Molokini island. It picked us up right on our beach. The kids decided to try Snuba and loved it so much that when we got back they went straight to the activities hut and signed up for Scuba lessons. Pat, their instructor, was great and I joined them for their first dive right off our beach. We found a turtle resting in the coral reef just 20 feet below us. The beach is very private because it is enclosed on either end by rocks extending into the ocean. The huge open atrium is planted with tropicals and hundreds of koi come swimming up to you, looking for some fish food provided by the restaurant hostesses. A large, beautiful heron sits still as a statue waiting for smaller fish to catch. He is wild but also attracted to the natural beauty of this hotel. We can't wait to return!

<Title>“A great value if you get it for the right price”
<Content>Here's the deal with this property. It's obvious that the new owners are still dealing with a massive restructuring/remodeling/rebranding project since acquiring the property last year. The result is that the prior negative reviews referencing the Adams Family, Hitchcock films, etc. are not completely offbase as the hotel is a bit stark and bland in general. I had already stayed for a few nights in West Maui so I only wanted 2 days/1 night in the Wailea area to check out South Maui before I left the island. I didn't want to pay $500+ for the Four Seasons or Grand Wailea and was able to book Makena for $199 inclusive of breakfast and the resort fee. The manager upgraded me to a better Ocean View room when I checked in without my having to badger him for it...in fact, the entire staff was very friendly and helpful the entire time I was there and are an asset to the hotel. I can confirm the prior reviews regarding the room...great views, nice bed, bland decor, elements that make you shake your head at the design flaws, cheap patio furniture that I constantly tripped over, etc. The hotel beach is nice. If you have a car drive to Big Beach 5 minutes down the road. Bottom line with this place is that it is a great value for South Maui if you get the room for a great rate, are not expecting a posh manicured Four Seasons/Grand Wailea experience, and are using it as a base to explore the island rather than sitting by the pool all day.

<Title>“Beautiful resort but watch out for additional costs.”
<Content>This was our second trip to Maui and this time we decided to spend two weeks in this very beautiful resort in south Walea. As we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff and shown to our room. We found all staff to be very friendly and hospitable and willing to help in any way they could. We were located on the second floor with a view of the park like gardens and pool area as well as Makena bay with Molikini on the horizon. The beach was small but almost exclusive to the resort. The snorkeling, right off the resort, was one of the best in Maui. The fact that you could grab hotel supplied towel(s) and in a minute be on the sands of the beach to lay back on one of the beach chairs or jump in for a quick swim was truly fantastic. We also enjoyed several walks from the resort to Makena Landing, as well as, to the black sand beach by the large cinder cone, south. We were not impressed with the restaurants offerings at the hotel. The buffet offered plenty of very average quality food and at $25 per person was not worth it. The drinks at the pool bar were great but at $8 per, on average, would be very easy to run up a huge tab. We loved our room and it's location however, we were taken aback by the additional and mandatory $25 + tax, per day for extras that frankly, should have been included in the original cost. For example, this additional cost covered the use of an in-room safe and a small fridge, two bottles of water (18 cents each at Costco)daily, a three cup serving of, make yourself, coffee, daily newspaper at the small coffee shop, hotel parking, access to two computers for guests which always seemed to be in use by others, also access to a health club, and valet parking. Valet parking was "free" but still expected to be tipped. This service also offered to print out our airline boarding passes but, when I inquired of the concierge I was informed to go print them myself. I have been to several other hotels and resorts where these services were all included. There were several rooms going thru' some major renovations on our floor making for quite a lot of noise from re-tiling, etc. At times the noise made it difficult for us to stay in our room. There are two golf courses, or were, as they shut down Makena South for some reason. Makena North was very nice with easy access from the resort but, not worth the green fees charged of $100 per round, minimum and that's only after paying $165 for your first round.

<Title>“A very tired building on a very beatiful piece of land”
<Content>This summer I spent 5 days at the Makena Beach Resort and loved the views from the hotel, the beach area, and the overall secluded feeling. The staff were also friendly, but I don't think any of them went out of their way, which was fine since I just wanted to relax. The pool area is very small and most back yard pools are nicer (except the view), so I would hope the hotel has plans to completely remove and replace this with a much larger and more lush pool area that would complement a hotel of this size. Most notably, the rooms leave MUCH to be desired. I think it is very misleading to call any of the rooms "Beautified" or "Renovated". Although I am sure they are an improvement from what they were when the resort was acquired, they are unacceptable at this price point. Although they don't have wallpaper, popcorn ceilings, or tired linens....the hollow and extremely cheap interior doors and the bathrooms are just disgustingly unappealing. To slap some granite and new fixtures in and call it renovated just isn't right. They need to gut the bathrooms to the studs and replace the interior doors, and after that I would return. Even many hotels that just put in new ceramic tile in an interesting pattern create a warm and inviting space, it doesn't have to be top of the line marble. I also think the granite color they chose is a mistake...it doesn't go with the rooms and it is stark and cold. A beige color marble or granite would be better suited based on everything else going on in the rooms. Waste of money with that in my opinion. They aren't making the necessary investment that they need to in order to create a repeat clientele that has helped many Hawaiin resorts prosper, which is unfortunate since I know the management is trying hard to thrive. If I were involved in managing this property I would do whatever it takes to do the bathrooms right the first time and stop wasting money on these petty bathroom "beatifications". If they rip out and replace the tile/tubs/showers now, they will obviously spend more money, but it will dramatically change the feel of the room and create a totally relaxing environment in the room & resort as a whole. I wanted to like this hotel, but it just irks me that they are cheaping out on the remodel, and makes me wonder where else they might be sacrificing (i.e. food quality, quality of cleaning detergent for linens, etc.). A nice bathroom is a big deal for a lot of people, especially after spending so much money to travel to Hawaii, so if you don't care about this or can get a good deal and manage, then go here. I wouldn't say it is a luxury resort, but somewhere in the 3-3.5 star range. Hopefully they will modify their renovation plan for the bathrooms and do the pool, making it more in the 4 star range. They wouldn't have to spend all that much, their relatively moderate point in Wailea would still be attractive, which would be a win-win for guests and management. On the wrong track so far.

<Title>“A hidden gem !”
<Content>Where ever you go there you are . After reading Danyelle's review I thought we may have been at two different resorts ? However, I had the most wonderful experience at the Makena Beach resort. The staff were all friendly and warm. Michelle and Ron at the front desk were great ! Jeff and the waitress at the pool were extremely helpful and answered any questions that I had. The guys at the surf shack rocked. They told me the best places to snorkel and what to watch out for. The breakfast was excellent. If anything was mislabeled it wasn't to hard to figure out what it was ? come on Danyelle you are still in America not Istanbul. I had stopped at the Marriott before checking in at the Makena Beach resort. The Makena Beach resort had a much better feel. I was able to get a late check out and take a shower before getting on the plane. Also, the bed was divine !!!! I slept better than I did the whole trip. I commend the whole staff at the Makena and hope folks will read all the reviews not just the one reviewer that could probably find something wrong with anything. Aloha from Seattle. I will be back !!!!

<Content>This is an absolutely gorgeous location although rather expensive. The support staff is wonderful but the downside is the wedding coordinator. She is rude!!! Her communication skills are awful and this is so important when planning a destination wedding. I would email a question and have to do several follow up prompts and it would take her 2 or 3 weeks to respond. She didn't even acknowledge that she received your communication.

<Title>“Has its good qualities too.”
<Content>My wife and I recently concluded an 18 day stay in Hawaii with four nights at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort. Before booking I looked over many of the reviews here and since the majority were positive and since we'd never stayed in the Wailea area before we went for it. The resort, which is on a gorgeous piece of property with it's own spacious and private feeling beach, does seem a bit down on it's heels. The former Maui Prince Hotel, it is in need of updating and seems a bit cold since it all seems to be be painted the same boring color of off white everywhere. Our room, partially updated, is still in serious need of a designer's touch. (Those lamps, Costco?) For example, in the entire room, there is one picture, a small one over the sofa. That being said, it is still a very nice place to stay. Their owners just need to pump some money (likely lots of it) into the infrastructure. Compared to the mega-resorts in Maui, this one needs to catch up. Our room was clean and comfortable and had a great view of the ocean and pool area. The staff is very nice and very willing to please. The dining room crew is great and Lucky out at the pool bar is a treasure. If you go you have to try one of his "Dancing Koi" drinks. He won an award in Japan with that drink and my wife, who's really not a drinker, wanted one for breakfast the morning following her first one at pool side. The breakfast buffet is great and more than adequate. We enjoyed the Saturday night Japanese buffet. Yes, the main restaurant is closed for repairs making the open air "coffee shop" the main eating venue. It's great for breakfast and lunches but not very elegant at dinner time. We played at the golf course once. Despite a negative review I saw here, we thought it was great. A Robert Trent Jones Jr. design, there are no houses built along the course and the natural use of the landscape available is fantastic. The views of the ocean all the way to Lana'i are great. Lee and Richard at the course were great. The pace was timely, not slow like a lot of resort courses. That cold, damp, fragrant towel when we came off the course was a God send! The afternoon rates are a real value in the area. By the way, the morning before we arrived at the Makena from Kona-Kailua, I noticed a better deal on their website. I called their 800 number and was courteously upgraded to the current offering, which by the way, was a great deal compared to other, fancier Wailea properties. Years ago I stayed at the Kaanapali Hyatt which is a fantastic property. My wife hadn't seen it so we drove there and toured the facility. Major construction going on! Tiny beach, hordes of tourists, golf course wedged between the highway and the resort strip. We were happy to get back to the Makena, where, despite it's flaws was quiet, friendly, beautiful and a great deal to boot! I like that someone at the Makena responds to these reviews too. I think that shows they are making the effort to address any shortcomings their guests my encounter. I was a bit confused though. Their entrance has an Okura Hotels nameplate. The check-in counter has a Summit Hotels nameplate. The room has directories for both hotel groups. Weirdly, I couldn't find the Makena Beach and Golf Resort in either.

<Title>“Much to be desired”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Makena for four nights during the first week of October. The antispetic lobby was anything but welcoming. If I were to stand on one side of the lobby and yell, "Echo," it would have reverberated through the entire floor. A few suggestions, this is Maui, spruce up the lobby with plants, flowers, anything tropical and gorgeous. Add a little music. Perhaps add a small lobby bar. Anything to add a little charm would be a good change. We checked into our room and realized that it did not fit our reservation - it was neither ocean front nor renovated. The following morning we requested a room change to meet our original reservation. They did move us to an ocean front and apparently, a renovated room. I was curious as to what they renovated - perhaps they changed the bed linens and replaced the television sets? Neither of the rooms looked anything like the renovated rooms on the website. The overall feel of the bathroom reminded me of the dank basement we had in the 1970s - the original flimsy wood doors were maintained (throughout the unit), the tiling was old and depressing, and the shower flooded everytime we stepped in. The breakfast buffet was one of two good points. The staff was extremely friendly, really on top of things, and the food was delicious. We found the best views in the hotel to be in the breakfast room. Unfortunately, that was also the lunch and dinner room as the main restaurant was closed. We were told it was a temporary close as it had flooded but from reading other reviews - sounds like the close lasted longer than two weeks. The second of two good points was the beach area - beautiful, pristine, and quiet. It was the perfect place to spend a relaxing late afternoon watching the sunset. We genuinely felt as far from the busier parts of Maui as we were. Yes, we did get a great deal to stay at this hotel, however, it was not enough of a deal. My husband and I are in our mid-30's and wanted a relaxing, semi-luxurious hotel to prepare for a new baby on the way. Makena felt more like a resort for college travelers or people on a very fixed budget (backpackers, etc.) that have few other alternatives. I hate to say it, but in the evenings, the lobby felt like the one from a famous movie in which the main character slips into a deep depression and attempts to hurt his family - yes, you know the one. Makena, you have a gorgeous piece of land, but perhaps knock the building down and start over.

<Title>“Peaceful, Elegant, and So Much Fun”
<Content>Dis be da place!! We just spent ten days at the resort--it was our second vist there. We will definitely return, and recommend it to all of our fellow SUPers (Stand Up Paddleboarders) and all other travellers to Maui. The staff is very friendly and will go out of their way to meet your requests. The ambience is older, elegant, laid-back Hawaii and does not have the fake Disneyland feel of some of the larger hotels on the island. The gardens are beautiful, the lobby a little sparse but pleasant and open. A few more decorations and flowers would be nice. Renovations were being done while we were there, and we weren't disturbed. Who stays in the room during the day when on Maui anyway? Our room was ocean front, comfortable, nicely furnished, and the view is stunning--you can see the beach, the volcano, the ocean, and other islands. There's so many things to do there--the beach is long and beautiful with very few people during the week. A few more folks were playing on the beach on the weekends, which is to be expected, but wasn't a detraction from the experience. The people working at the beach house are friendly, helpful, informative and lots of fun! There are many activities--we spent most of our days on our SUPs going up and down the coast--it is so beautiful. It's a great beach for swimming, and the snorkeling is awesome--lots of coral, fish, turtles, and dolphins. We heard about the whales that went by, but didn't see them this time. Generally the wind picks up in the afternoon, as it does everywhere in Hawaii, so get up early for water activities. The breakfast was very good, as was dinner--the setting is so pleasant by the pond and gardens. We enjoyed lunch many times at the pool bar & restaurant. Great fish tacos. Make sure you have one of Lucky's "Dancing Koi" drinks at the pool bar and watch the sunset. We would suggest having live Hawaiian music at the bar when it reopens, and are glad to hear it will be open-air with ocean view . We love this resort and definitely plan on returning. We do have one concern--because we SUP for so many hours every day, and want to have the option to travel to other beaches with our SUPs, we rent our boards at a surf shop for the entire vacation and bring them to the hotel with us. The staff has very kindly let us keep our boards down by the beach shack. We have heard that management is concerned about this, as there is always a possibility of theft wherever you may be. We understand that this is our responsibility, not the hotel's, and hope we can continue to store our boards there. If in the future, board storage is not allowed, this would be our only issue for not returning. If necessary, the resort should offer a waiver stating that this is the guests' responsibility. Since this sport is growing so fast, and with the X-Terra games being held on the island, this will become a larger market in the future, and hopefully the resort will embrace this. You can't go wrong choosing this resort for your stay on Maui! Mahalo to the resort and it's staff for a wonderful experience, and may the Aloha always continue at The Makena Beach and Golf Resort.

<Title>“South Maui Solitude”
<Content>The Makena Beach and Golf Resort, formerly known as the Maui Prince resort, is having a renaissance moment. Situated near the end of the road at Makena Beach south of the posh Wailea resort area, guests choosing this hotel will find a quiet haven with newly updated rooms, updated lobby, and a staff that embodies the Aloha Spirit. The cavernous yet somewhat sparse lobby sports a newly opened Concierge Desk, and bare areas are filling up with new sofa and chair "conversation pit" seating. New management has a "green" thumb and has refurbished the furnishings in the rooms to their former glory rather than starting from scratch. Kudos for the conservation efforts. Rooms are pleasant and spacious, with convenient refrigerators (no mini bar...most folks don't use them anyway) and bar area with coffee maker (Starbucks blends) and ice bucket. Beds are comfortable (if a bit soft), with crisp white sheets and cushy pillows, and there's a comfy chair and ottoman along with writing desk, bureau for clothes storage, clock/radio/CD player and flat screen televisions. Lanai's are spacious, so they dwarf the small round table and two chairs situated on them. Heads-up on "ocean view rooms", as for some you may have to stand in the corner of your lanai and turn your head to see water, but in fact, they do have views of the ocean. Breakfast is currently served buffet style in the Cafe Kiowai (which also serves as the current dinner restaurant), and it's very plenitful and good quality, with fresh fruits, cereals, pastries, omelet station and made-to-order eggs, waffles, hot dishes including scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon, steamed rice, oatmeal, and daily changed selections. The Sunday Brunch is apparently a popular local event. Currently, the only other open establishments for a snack are the Barista 5400 coffee shop (serving Starbucks) in the lobby, or, the poolside snack bar. Speaking of pools...there are two small, perfectly round pools, one 6 feet in depth and the other a "baby pool". New lounge chairs and tables grace the concrete decking, and pool attendants bring guests cold lemon infused towels and ice pops throughout the afternoon, which is a nice touch. The draw here is not the pool, but the spectacular stretch of beach just steps away. Here, swimmers and snorkelers, paddlers and divers, will find their own piece of heaven. The area is known as "Turtle Alley", so endangered green sea turtles frolic off shore, as well as spinner dolphins, and during the whale season humpback whales come to play. We were fortunate to have seen one of the first whales arriving to the area the first week of November, when one small male humpback was spotted off shore flapping his tail and giving us a show. What a thrill! Back to reality...folks, this is a quiet resort, far from the madness of the throngs on Kaanapali Beach. If you are looking for quiet, this is your place. Great shopping and other dining is a short drive away in the Wailea or Kihei area, so no worries. You will need a car here if you are wanting to explore the island on your own, however, if you are just going to relax and stay put a while, the hotel has on-demand car service to the Shops at Wailea for shopping/dining options. If you are looking for a lively hotel with lots going on, this is not for you. But, if you want quiet and solitude, you'd do well here. There are some great deals going no right now to drum up business, so call your local travel agent for the current promotion and come over to visit the best kept secret on Maui!

<Title>“Lovely and great value”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here for our first 3 nights in Maui. The resort is the last in a string of resorts from Wailea to Makena, so it is a little more secluded (bit farther drive to amenities is all). Lots of green space and flowers with a lovely relaxing feeling. We had the most amazing view of a mountain and the beach from our balcony. Loved watching the sunset! The staff is friendly and helpful. The beach is lovely and there are lots of activities available. We had our own snorkles so went out of the beach a few times and saw lots of coral and fish and even some sea turtles! We went paddle boarding for the first time as well as taking the catamaran out to Molonoki island. That wasn't bad, but it was windy so we couldn't go snorkeling inside. Overall, great value for what we paid and had a great resort, pampered feel. :)

<Title>“Marooned at a Resort”
<Content>This is a property that went through a long and challenging foreclosure, and that is now being rehabbed and upgraded. So things are a bit uneven. This place is the end of the line, literally -- the southernmost hotel in the Wailea/Makena area. It is a big, grand, nicely appointed, but mostly soulless place that conjures a Vegas hotel on the beach. On our arrival mid-day, there was exactly one front desk clerk at a big long check-in counter. But then, there were hardly any people staying in the hotel. This is one of those places that aims to nick you on most everything they can. Resort fee? Sure, but the â€œincluded itemsâ€� are things you would expect to be free most places (e.g. fitness center access). Internet fee on top of that? You bet. About $20 per day, per computer (no sharing). Want to use some snorkeling gear or a paddleboard? Youâ€™re going to pay, a lot. Normally there are apparently two restaurants in the hotel. Due to rehab of the main restaurant, only one restaurant (the breakfast/lunch restaurant) was open for dinner. Menu was quite limited and the place looked like, well, a breakfast restaurant. Noticed steam tables in the middle of the dining area and asked about them. Those are for the breakfast buffet. How much? For the full buffet, $25. For cold items only, $20. But she did advise you could order a la carte. We never dined there. There was a pool bar that stayed open until about 6. There was the breakfast/lunch/dinner restaurant that was open until 9 or so. After that, there was not one place to have a drink. No bar, no place to gather in the late evening. No doubt the main restaurant and bar will reopen, but what can you say about a place that is open for guests, in a fairly remote area, and shuts down all but one restaurant, leaving their guests with only this option on-site? This is a hotel that clearly decided that when it is low season, they are just going to reduce staff and options and you will just have to deal with it. I was at a meeting, but most are traveling to Maui to stay in a premium property. Thereâ€™s a nice beach in front, but no lifeguards. Typical of Hawaii hotels that advertise their beaches, but then just put signs all over the place saying you could die in the water so be careful. There are refrigerators in the rooms that are just for you (no mini-bar rip-off). This is good, but then there are signs at the pool and elsewhere that you canâ€™t bring any food or drink with you. So apparently you just have to stay in your room to consume what is in your fridge. There is a spectacular gym. Perhaps the best Iâ€™ve seen in terms of workout machines and free weights. Just one workout mat though for the entire place. Strange. Our room was quite large and beautifully appointed, with a big wide deck, and a number of amenities. Very nice actually. The resort was really very quiet. There were very noisy birds in early morning, but this is a natural area and you expect that. Most people, we found, including ourselves, took the convenient hotel shuttles to restaurants in Wailea, but that was as far north as they would go, and their convenience may have had to do with the lack of guests in the hotel. A 15 minute shuttle ride would take you to an upscale mall and hotel restaurants, like Ruthâ€™s Chris. We found much nicer, local, reasonable restaurants in Kihei, like Cuatro and 808 Bistro. Excellent! But a 20 â€“ 25 minute drive away. One benefit of this location is the beautiful Makena State Beach to the immediate south (you have to drive 5 minutes), with lifeguards, but some rather challenging shorebreak. There is also an incredible drive through a lava field and some great snorkeling south of it, if you are adventurous enough to scamper over rocks into the water on your own, with no lifeguards. Maui is a beautiful place, with many wonderful places to stay and eat. This is a remote resort wherein you are more or less marooned. Itâ€™s the size of a Waikiki hotel, without the nearby dining options. Itâ€™s the location of an exclusive hotel, but without most of the accommodation for the fact that you are somewhat trapped. Itâ€™s more along the lines of, we got you here, now you will pay. If money is no object, you might find it pleasant, but if money is no object, you would not select a place like this. Itâ€™s not that it is totally unpleasant, just lacking in character or intimacy on an island with hotels that offer much more for the cost.

<Title>“Customer service and a great stay”
<Content>We picked this resort off yahoo travel and got a awesome deal! The resort is massive, clean, and the people are amazing! We were greeted at the front by complimentary valet and a sea shell lei, check in was smooth and the valet had our bags in the room before we got there. The beach is big with plenty of lounge chairs and perfect for swimming and snorkeling. The room is nice sized with two queen beds and a big patio, the bathroom is big with a tub and seperate shower. Can't say enough good things about this place. Will stay here again!

<Title>“Wonderful Experience!”
<Content>My husband and I wanted to celebrate our one year anniversary in Hawaii and spent a week at the resort. We loved the resort and the friendly employees that worked there - when we checked in, we had a minor ant problem in the bathroom and the employees worked on moving us to a better room right away. The service was great and the concierge (Roey?) was spectacular! He had plenty of recommendations and even booke our snorkling and luau dinner for us. The hotel is located towards the end of the island so the beaches were pretty empty most of the time. There are a lot of neighboring hotels that have happy hour so we usually grabbed a late bite after we got back from our daily activities - although there isnt a huge night life in Maui. I'd definitely return on our next trip to Hawaii. Thank you so much for making our vacation so fabulous.

<Title>“Great view but poor ambience”
<Content>We booked this expecting an experience similar to that of a resort in Mauritius, but were highly disappointed. On our arrival in the afternoon, we got a nice sea shell lei and then we entered a sparsely decorated reception with no welcome drink and in our case - no one at reception. We asked the concierge to call someone so that we could check in and he told us just to wait. Having just arrived from Oahu where service was an 11 out of 10, we were surprised at the lack of urgency. After about 5 minutes, a lady graced us with her presence and checked us in without an apology or a smile. Not a good start. The hotel was extremely quiet - we felt like the only guests, which can be a good thing, but this was more of a sad quiet. we understand that this is the quieter side of Maui but we landed up leaving everyday to find food and entertainment elsewhere. The hotel has apparently changed hands and was formerly the Maui Prince. It's clearly still struggling to find it's feet. Our room was nice and big and the view was good. There was however a major lack of entertainment and ambience. There's no music, sparse decor and a general lack of friendliness unless you happen to frequent the restaurant or pool area. Food at the pool and restaurant is outstanding and it's a pity that there aren't more people coming to the hotel to eat. We left every night to eat elsewhere where entertainment or live music is generally always included. The food at this hotel is miles better than the Hula Grill's though. The beach here is great and while snorkeling, we even got to see sea turtles on 2 out of 2 occasions. My other complaint however is that at a resort, I don't expect to have to pay $20 a day for a beach umbrella. This makes the choice of visiting other beaches easier as you don't get an umbrella there either. So what incentivises guests to stay here at this resort? Not much really. When the term "resort" is used in a name, I expect to not have to travel anywhere else as everything should be at my finger tips at a resort. Not here. During happy hour, california rolls are half price. We and a couple on a table next to us, ordered them and they came out in under 5 minutes. Very good california rolls I may add. When we and the other table both ordered a second round of drinks and sushi, we waited until 15 minutes before the end of happy hour to get it. The impression here was that they didn't want us to take advantage of happy hour and would rather have us stop ordering. In my experience, a place this quiet wants to move as much product as possible to keep the guest at the resort, spending at the resort. In our case, it was an attitude of we don't need your money so spend it elsewhere - which is exactly what we did. Which is sad really as this hotel has so much potential. If only management and staff could see what they're doing and what they're competing with down the road at any of the other resorts, maybe then this "resort" could be a contender.

<Title>“Wild and beautiful Makena”
<Content>We love Makena Beach and Golf Resort at the end of Wailea and the edge of the wild overlooking Maluaka Beach where we got married six years ago. The rooms are spacious, old fashioned and we love the foyer to each room how you can tie back the solid doors and let the wind blow through the room and the louvered door... So breezy. Staff are wonderful. Sad to see the Japanese Restaurant Hakone (changed last year) now closed... But the Japanese buffet in the main dining room was awesome. No more gold card but would love to go on Kama'aina rate in the future. Tourists, you will love this sedate beautiful place on Maui. Quiet great for those without kids.

<Title>“Beautiful View!”
<Content>We stayed in a room that wasn't renovated yet but we thought the room was great! The view was outstanding and the bed was comfortable with lots of pillows! The carpet was needing to be replaced but we knew that this was an older room when we booked. We enjoyed the balcony and spent our mornings and evenings relaxing out there. Regretfully, we did have issues with smokers on the balcony multiple times. Renovations were being done just down from our room during the day but we weren't bothered because who stays in there room during the day when you are in Hawaii! Loved the beach since it wasn't crowded and enjoyed the snorkeling from the beach. Stayed for 4 days and walked each morning starting in the back of the hotel. The hotel grounds are gorgeous! Overall, wonderful experience!

<Title>“Good Hotel”
<Content>The hotel was ok. The rooms were a bit outdated and not really a four star hotel. I would have paid a bit more and stayed at the Marriott down the street. This was our first time to Maui. Had a couple of issues with the safe and had to have security come to break it open. Our view was great but again the room seemed more like a 3 star.

<Title>“Brides Beware!”
<Content>We planned our wedding at Makena Point, which is managed by the resort. We did not stay at the resort, so I can't offer any opinions on the actual hotel. However, planning our wedding was an absolute nightmare. Leo, our wedding planner, had no idea what she was doing. We showed up for our rehearsal and she acted like she didn't know why we were there (her greeting was "can I help you?") and then disappeared to take a phone call! We couldn't get price quote from her until the week before we left for Hawaii (after asking for months), and she "lost" or didn't receive 5 of my voice mails and emails. We had originally planned to have our reception at the resort as well, but ended up cancelling it one week before the wedding (when we finally got the price estimate). Overall a stressful and frustrating experience.

<Title>“Laid Back and Living Easy at Makena Beach”
<Content>I spent two nights at Makena Beach resort this past September with my wife on our "mini-moon". For our week in Maui, we stayed at the Hyatt and Westin in Kaanapali and also in the Makena Beach & Golf resort. Of all three hotels, Makena had the best beach - quiet, nice sand and warm water. It was also very close to "Big Beach" which is also somewhat quiet and has lots of sandy shores. The room we stayed in was recently renovated, with a beautiful sunset view. The Lanai/Balcony was very spacious and definitely private! The hotel was clean, and the staff was very friendly. The location was also good... it was close to the high-end shopping in Wailea, but was just far enough to be very quiet. Driving into Wailea took about 10 minutes. If you're looking for a hotel to relax, and have some quiet time on the beach, I would definitely recommend this hotel. If you want more "action" on the beach, stay in Kaanapali.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>We have been to Maui six times in 27 years but never stayed as south as Makena. We really enjoyed the resort, and absolutely loved the beach. The mornings were the best to truly appreciate the beauty and the clear ocean waters because the clouds hovered around the mountains of Haleakela in the mid afternoon each day we stayed (week of Oct 9th). The grounds were very pretty and we enjoyed the putting greens and poolside bar. The renovation didn't impact our stay at all and our rooms had very comfortable bedding and were always clean. We stayed on the fourth floor, room 405 and our view was very nice. The ocean was visable, but don't expect to see the sand - it was just what we expected for the Nalu room. We visited Big Beach which was beautiful; however, we preferred the Makena Beach. We saw a sea turtle pop up in the rocks which sit in front of the resort which made me feel like this was still a special little stretch of beach. We will definitely consider this resort again as long as the rates remain reasonable. Roey was very helpful in providing information at the concierge desk and Imelda kept our room nice and clearn :).

<Content>Our trip to Maui was fantastic. We arrived very late and the people at the front desk was waiting for us. Makena Beach and Golf Resort has everything you need to have a relaxing vacation time.The resort offers many ammenities from snorkeling, kayaking, shuttels to shopping or golf, nice walks through their beautiful gardens, or just sitting back and relaxing on the beach, or poolside, with food and beverage service. Staff are very friendly and helpful, and go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. Breakfast was really good, also excellent food and service at the Cafe on the Green .Mahalo for a wonderful time!!!!! to the personnel @ the Makena Beach and Golf Resort. I can't wait to go back!!!

<Title>“Beautiful property in a perfect location”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Makena for 6 nights. We were upgraded to an oceanfront (traditional) room. Ron at the front desk went out of his way to accommodate our special requests and was never too busy to greet us whenever we passed by the reception. Our rate included the breakfast buffet, which we found excellent. Much more variety than we had experienced at other Hawaiian resorts earlier. We had the Japanese buffet on Saturday and another dinner later in the week at the restaurant. Both were very good. The staff everywhere in the resort is very friendly and really tries very hard to accommodate the guests. The beach is wonderful, so are the gardens and koi ponds. We very much enjoyed our stay at the Makena and hope to return in the not too distant future. We will also recommend the resort to family and friends. I am hoping the price doesn't go up too much so we can still afford staying here the next time.

<Title>“Wonderful Resort in Maui; would not go anywhere else!”
<Content>Our trip to Maui was fantastic, and a major reason for that was our stay at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort. We were greeted warmly at the valet and Ron at the front desk was awesome. He was a wealth of information and every day we saw him during our stay he asked how was our stay and had a great smile. The bar at the restaurant was a great deal at happy hour and highly recommended. The salmon appetizer was out of this world and the mai tai's were a great price. The view through the bar to the sunset was amazing. We also went to the restaurant for the Sunday brunch. It was clear that a large effort was made to have cuisine at the highest level and we were overjoyed at the quality. The beach in front of the hotel was pleasant and is was very quiet and relaxing. On top of that there were sea turtles!!! At the rock outcropping just in front of the beach access was a large turtle and it came within two feet of me! Before our trip we had heard about the renovations and there were some hiccups and noises that impacted our stay, but nothing that made us upset. Our room was very clean and we were extremely happy with the service. Next time we return to Maui we will be staying at this resort. Also, it is worth getting an ocean front room. We were definitely happy we chose that option. I could write more about the open lobby, gardens, staff, etc, but I think other reviews cover those aspects quite well.

<Title>“The Good, the not so good and the .....”
<Content>Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort. This was our first time to stay at this property and were pleasantly surprised. And while everyone will have their likes and dislikes, overall it was a beautiful hotel, with an amazing beach and most importantly staffed with hard working employees that wanted to insure everyone had a nice time. Truly, every employee we encountered were kind, gracious and truly happy to see you. The good... Ron, at the front desk, was very accomodating. He even offered my travel partner the option of previewing the rooms before determining which one we would stay in. And although we were not given a free upgrade, we were offered an upgrade to a full ocean view for a nominal fee. This same room/view would have cost two to three times at the other Wailea Properties. And the room was much closer to the ocean, you could even hear the waves at night. And every time we passed the front desk, Ron would personally greet us by name. I noticed he did that with most of the guests. Not many hotels can boost that kind of customer service! The room rate included daily breakfast for two, no resort fee (which includes free valet parking), and the hotel offered free computers/printers. Such the deal! Wish the other hotels would offer the same. The valet folks, were very friendly and provided lots of nice tips for local places to dine. The wait for the car was minimal. There was always someone available to get the car. And they also offered free shuttle service to/from the other Wailea properties, shops, golf courses and dining establishments. The rooms were clean, nice linens, and all offered large balconies. Our room had not been updated, but it was still very nice. Like one reviewer said, he would trade all the granite, marble, fancy bathroom fixtures for this quiet little gem of a hotel. I completely agree! The breakfast buffet was hearty and offered an omelette station, fresh fruits, juices, assorted pastries, breakfast meats, potatoes and cold cereal. Plenty of options to hold you over til a late lunch. Marissa was always smiling, made sure our juice glasses never ran low and provided excellent service. We never felt rushed at breakfast and would usually hang around enjoying the beautiful scenery. The bar offered happy hour drinks and appetizers at a reduced rate. Frank made an excellent Mai Tai. He has been with the hotel for a long time and was a wealth of information. If you enjoy massages, be sure to book an afternoon massage at the beach with Rosalyn or Gailyn, they ROCK!!! What do you get when you combine a cool ocean breeze, outdoor massage and the sounds of the ocean...a little piece of heaven. And, the price is actually very reasonable. No upcharge for being outside either. The highlight of the property is the beach area. The sand is silky soft, the water is crystal clear and there are hardly any visitors to this little piece of paradise. I am almost afraid to mention this because I do not want others to visit this beach. :-) The not so good.... The pool area is not great. But like the pool attendant said, why come all the way to Hawaii to sit by the pool? He's right. It's great for dipping, but nothing beats their beach. Now for the .... ridiculous For some reason, this hotel likes to put a hold on your credit card for the estimated charge of your entire stay. And this hold will stay on your credit card for up to 5 to 7 business days after you check out. Needless to say, I was quite surprised when I got home and found over $2,100 on hold on my credit card. I spoke to Mary Jane, in accounting, and was told "this is how they do it" and really had no other explanation. After much discussion, she offered to call the credit card call center to see if they could expediate the release of the credit hold. And while, I realize it was not actually charged to my card, this made no logical sense. Especially since one of the holds (for $1,799) was dated AFTER our check out date. Mary Jane never offered to follow up with me as to the outcome and will continue to monitor my credit card activity in the hopes the release will completed in a timely fashion. She could learn a few things on customer service and follow up. Advice for management.... 1. Get rid of this credit card hold. I travel extensively and this is the first time I have ever had a property do this. Including when I stayed at the neighboring properties...Four Seasons, Fairmont, Grand Wailea and Marriott. 2. Offer free one hour snorkel equipment for guests. While your hourly rental cost is minimal, it would be a nice added feature for guests. 3. Purchase some beach cruisers for guests to check out, free of charge. 4. I don't know if the pool attendant does this, but it would be nice if he/she could offer cold hand towels, fresh fruit, juices, etc, through out the day. It's a minimal expense and the nice touch would go along way for those that chose to be by the pool. And for those guests that are not sure, it might give them incentive to visit the pool. And if they are at the pool area, they will be more likely to purchase refreshments and food. In today's world, where everyone is being nickel and dimed to death, it's the little things that guests remember. 5. Keep the bar by the pool area, open til dark. It would have been so nice to have cocktails out there, but it closes at 5:30pm. And if you need to drum up business, offer early happy hour specials by the pool. 6. Turn the outdoor fountains off that are outside the ocean facing rooms at 9pm. It currently turns off at 3:30am and back on by 7am. When the fountain isn't on, you can actually hear the ocean from your room. And since the ocean is a big reason why we all come to Hawaii, let your guests hear it too.

<Title>“Destination Wedding”
<Content>The Makena Beach & Golf Resort was very accomidating and a great place for me and my wife to stay. I liked the fact that it wasn't over crouded with a bunch of tourist and the beach at the resort was right in front of the snorkeling boats taking people to see the turtles. We rented snorkeling gear a few days and both days went out to see turtles each time as well as other marine life. Their was some remodeling still being done but mainly on the upper levels of the hotel and really didn't bother us that much since we spent most of our time on the beach or doing activities.

<Title>“Great Stay-cation for Kamaina!”
<Content>I live in Lahaina and booked a room at Makena Beach Resort for my boyfriends Birthday. He had a 10am Tee Time at the golf course and the front desk let me check in at 9:30am instead of the 3pm check in time! The rooms were awesome, comfortable and had a great lanai with an ocean view. The staff at the resort are extremely friendly and outgoing! We especially loved Jules at the pool at Micheal at the Starbucks, but everyone was great! The pool boy even served us complimentary otter pops to cool us off! So many nice personal touches made our stay fantastic and we will visit again and send friends and family to the resort without hesitation. Top notch!

<Title>“Good value”
<Content>We stayed for 10 days at the end of August. The hotel is being renovated (so they have been having an amazing sale) and the hotel was very quiet and relaxing unlike a few of the other hotels we stayed at (the Grand Wailea, the Sheraton at Black Rock). (Don't worry about the renovation it's not intrusive or disruptive at all). The staff at the hotel are amazing (Ron at check-in, the valet crew, David at the restaurant at dinner, ScubaLuv Maui. The rooms (even the renovated rooms) are "slightly" dated (note to owners of hotel- you should have renovated the bathrooms too!) but very clean, quiet and comfortable beds and linens. We stayed in room 532 and the view was amazing. The food at the restaurants is priced like the rest of Wailea (i.e. overpriced for quality) is not good (not awful, but not good either)- none of it- the breakfast, the brunches, dinner. Probably the best food is poolside- except they stop serving at like 5:30 (before it even gets dark) or something like that (note to new owners- I head so many people complain about this- you are losing some serious business). (Another peeve- why don't the restaurants mention if there are nuts or other common allergens in the food like we do on in the rest of the mainland USA. I am allergic to macademia nuts and ate a cookie and was seriously ill afterwards. Food allergies are a serious thing) The pool is small- it wasn't crowded but neither was the hotel. Also there is not hot tub, which is a bit of a bummer. However the beech is amazing and the snorkling is really great. I have no doubt the hotel will be amazing after the reno (provided they fix the food and upgrade the pool). Overall a hidden gem- I would recommend it to my friends and family. But if you are very particular- perhaps you should look elsewhere.

<Title>“Pros and Cons - but Overall Very Nice”
<Content>The people and the beach at Makena Beach and Golf resort made our experience a success. My boyfriend and I were debating between this resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. We were pleased with our choice for the price. The pros: - Amazing, friendly, helpful staff - the valets gave us great tips every day on where to go and eat (one even discreetly directed us to a nude beach near the hotel that we'd tried unsuccessfully to find. Yeah Little Beach!), We felt genuinely welcomed by everyone we encountered. - The beach - we drove ALL over Maui and agreed that Makena beach was our favorite. We saw amazing, huge sea turtles while snorkeling and kayaking. We also saw a ton of fish. Beach was quiet/peaceful and the surf was gentle - great for all levels of swimmers. - Good ocean views from all of the rooms - we had one of the "worst" rooms in the resort - second furthest from the ocean and could still see the ocean from our balcony and had lovely garden and moutain views. Our room was renovated and we found it satisfactory - bathroom still needs work though. The cons: - There were small, gnat-like bugs in our room. I called the front desk about this and they brushed me off. We also saw some larger bugs. Not sure if it was just our room or a resort-wide problem. For the record, my boyfriend had no problem with this given the tropical environment (they were very tiny bugs) BUT if this is 4 stars, I expect no bugs. - The food: the buffet breakfast was yummy but way overpriced. We paid over $50 for our first breakfast. The next day we went into Kihei and paid $20 for an AMAZING breakfast at Kihei Caffe - very chill and delicious. Did dinner one night at the restaurant and it was terrible and we did breakfast a la carte one day and had the worst omlettes ever. - Too quiet. There is no nightlife or excitement here - it was relaxing, but a bit too slow-paced for us overall. Everything shut down by 10pm. For the price and location, I'm still glad we stayed here versus the Fairmont BUT we did eat there one night and had one of the best meals of our entire trip - tied with Spago at the Four Seasons. That said, the beach at Makena is now one of my favorites and the people at the resort were fantastically warm and helpful. If you want quiet, low-key luxury on a budget, with good snorkeling, Makena is a great choice.

<Title>“Slightly disappointed and annoyed”
<Content>We were not informed ahead of time that the resort was going to hold $250 against our credit card as a deposit for room damage. Which is a bit ironic since we were first given an old, outdated room which was 2 doors down from loud construction. After telling the front desk that our booking agency told us we would be receiving an updated room, the staff asked if we had proof of this and reluctantly gave us an "updated" room,but the bathroom still looked like it was from 1970. I do have to say that the view, beach and hotel common areas were VERY nice. But we were again financially surprised to find out that every time we charged a meal or drinks to our room, the hotel actually held more than double the amount that we charged (despite that we had a $50 resort credit and they were already holding the $250 deposit.). When all was said and done, they were holding over $350 against our card and we only owed them $1 when we checked out. We had breakfast included in our stay, which was great but I would not recommend wasting your money on other meals here, there are better prices and food elsewhere in the area.

<Title>“will be great when construction is over”
<Content>pros: - the view from every room is better than any hotel on the island -the beach in front of the hotel is amazing and has great snorkeling -the staff is friendly and helpfull cons: -they are in the middle of doing construction in the hotel - there is noise, dirt and smells in certain areas (rooms) and some amenities are not available -they need to bring back the vented door in rooms for cross ventilation and add a fan -no one makes you aware of construction before you come

<Title>“Friendly Staff, Great for Beach Lovers”
<Content>This is our fourth time staying at the resort and we are happy to see the owners investing to update the property. Everyone we met at the resort (especially Ron at the front desk) was always very friendly and accommodating. They seem to take pride in what they do and the resort itself. While older than the surrounding resorts, this is still a great hotel on Maui. Though it is still very well-kept and the new owners are making some improvements to the rooms and facilities. Here is a quick overview from our visit: Rooms: We were in an updated 5th floor room on the south side of the hotel. The room was clean, well-appointed and the view from the lanai was spectacular. Nice touches in the room included a refrigerator, coded safe for valuables, and a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee (something from a local coffee shop like Maui Coffee Roasters wouldâ€™ve been cool too). The shower system is also unique and very convenient. Dining: They've improved the hours of restaurant operation, but I think this is still a weakness for the resort. The lobby's coffee shop is great, but the restaurant and poolside food service could be better for the property. The staffs are friendly and courteous, but there seemed to be some confusion with poolside service procedures and the food offerings are not all that memorable. We attended the Sunday buffet and were pleased with the prime rib and suckling pig (fabulous), but a bit disappointed the creme brulee had vanished from dessert offerings. Pool / Beach: The beach is top-notch, stunningly-beautiful, relatively uncrowded and only 30 yards away. Off the left (south) side of the beach is also a good reef to see fish and even turtles. The resort's beach shack also has friendly folks who can facilitate beach activities as well. If you're more of a "pool person", you'll likely be disappointed - the pool is rather small compared to other resorts. Other Facilities: The resort also has good coin-operated laundry facilities. Their workout room is really well-equipped, they had comparable equipment to our Goldâ€™s Gym back home (just newer). It was so nice, we actually felt guilty not using it during our stay. The grounds are also very clean and well-manicured. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the resort, the staff is always friendly and the facility clean and well-kept. Our issues with the dining options are small when compared with the rest of our experience at the resort as a whole. We will continue to stay here whenever we visit Maui.

<Title>“Relaxing, Quiet Hotel and Fantastic Beach”
<Content>If you want to escape the "tourist" parts of Maui, this is a quiet hotel with an excellent beach. There is fantastic snorkeling right outside the hotel, and a boat leaves for Molikini crater every day right at the beach. The staff members are friendly. The rooms are large with balconies, views of the ocean and free coffee and water. The grounds are gorgeous, and it's very easy to relax at this hotel!

<Title>“Remote but definately a great spot!”
<Content>We stayed in Makena as part of our Honeymoon trip. Great spot - comfortable, relatively basic (nice decor but nothing extra special). We choose this hotel as we wanted something relaxed and not too formal. In the evenings we didnt have to wear formal dress and most places (bars & restaurants) accepted casual dress with proper footwear. Breakfast buffet in the mornings is excelllent. If you are going to this cafe, avail of the buffet as there is a huge selection and all in all, worth it (approx $30 each - not bad for the island prices!). The beach is beautiful and a spectacular sunset in the evenings. We snorkled in Molokini island and the boat left straight from our beach. Big beach is just down the road, about 15min walk but you need to leave the hotel resort and walk on the main road (be careful if you are a pedestrian, cars drive very fast and there are dips on the road!). I would definately recommend this hotel! Pool service is super - friendly staff refilling your ice water and poolside catering. Also the consierge person "Roey" very helpful & pleasant. Housekeeping refill bottled water in our room everyday in the room fridge. There is a free suttle service to Wailea shops & restaurants which is very handy - remember to tip the drivers though!!! There is a car rental group in the reception of the hotel. This was handy and resonably priced for us as we didnt intend in renting a car until we heard about driving to the other side of the island -Hana (which is well worth the trip!!). I hope to visit Makena again sometime - but it's a long distance from Ireland!! But worth the travelling!

<Title>“An amazing experience and we'll return soon”
<Content>It was our 25th year anniversary trip and I would not hesitate to report my positive experience that my wife and encountered during our stay. We chose Makena Beach resort based on the trip advisory comments and review noted by other traveller and that helped us narrow down our hotel choice. The hotel staff was very helpful, accommodating, happy, and eager to go above and beyond to make our stay pleasant and memorable. I would like to mention exemplary staff members whom we had the pleasure to meet and interact daily during our stay including FO and housekeeping and like to name specific personnel (Ralph, Jay, Jeff, Linda, Ron, and Jewel). There are a lot of good things to speak about them individually, but I want to mention specifically three members (Jewel, Ralph and Jay) who went above and beyond to accommodate our needs and requests promptly and efficiently in which we are very grateful for their hospitality. I was on the fifth floor overlooking the ocean with good view. The hotel is undergoing room renovation and despite our room was not remolded then, yet it was comfortable, amenities in workable order, clean and well organized. The hotel is nicely situated in a calm and beautiful area close to major shops and restaurants and has its own private beach. Fantastic location for those who is looking for calmness, disconnect from busy environment and ambiance. I will definitely recommend this resort to anyone who wants to experience the difference. We would like to extend our special Thanks to Sean Sweeny (General Manager and Carmine Iommazzo (Resident Manager) Denise Hoopai and Phillip for their time to chat with us during our departure and wish them all well and for their great assets (Employees) Keep up the good work and hope to see your fine facility in the near future. The only opportunity I would recommend is to offer Free internet in the rooms and not only to two computers at the lobby where I encountered guests spending too much time on them and not allowing other guests to use them.

<Content>Booked w orbitz and got a hell of a deal. the hotel is under new management and is great for individuals , couples or family. If your looking for quality off the strip but just a hop,skip and jump away this is the place. great beach and decent snorkeling that is sure to please most but the most discerning right off to the left point of hotel beach. Safe calm water in the a.m. for all family snorkeling and still fantastic for a swim in the afternoons. Turtles too! Now for such a great review i should get a comp but... well... they deserve it . Great place... unless you want a condo for big family. Even then you gotta visit the beach for a snorkel....on a scale of 1 to six i would rate this a 5 star

<Title>“Feeling swindled”
<Content>As noted in a previous review, the hotel is now refusing to honor their original commitments regarding when a voucher can be used and the level of discount it brings. Please read the hotel's response to the last reviewer in which they say "This gold card program is very value driven and is a program that comes with a number of restrictions attached to it, restrictions that do change according to business demands." Of course, a simple translation of this prose would be "a deal is not a deal if we decide it's better for us to unilaterally change the conditions...." In other words "too bad for you, sucker." Dear Reader, you have a choice of the people with whom you want to do business. I heartily suggest that you take your trade elsewhere. with Aloha a Maui resident

<Title>“Enjoy a great value before it's gone!”
<Content>We had a really fantastic time at Makena last week and found it to be a great value. We stayed for six nights in one of the non-renovated rooms and had no problems (the showerhead broke the first day but was immediately replaced). Our flight was then cancelled and the airline put us up in the same hotel for two nights, and this time we were in a renovated room. While the renovated room had some improvements -- nicer bathroom and very big flat screen tv -- there were also drawbacks. Most notably, the renovated room eliminates one of the nicer features, which was an interior door that allowed you to keep the exterior door open to create a breeze through the room. Without it, the room was pretty stuff and the wind howled through the door. In any case, for the prices they're offering now I think it's a very good deal. For us the location was perfect because it's not crowded like Kihei or Kaanapali. You'll need a rental car but that's pretty necessary in any case to get around. As others have mentioned, the restaurants are very overpriced (even for Maui), with the $25 breakfast taking the cake. The $7 fish sandwich on the beach was a great deal and delicious! The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout our stay.

<Title>“Sunset Paradise!”
<Content>Before I get to the positives, here are a few negatives about staying at this hotel. PLEASE read the entire review, and you won't regret it! Negatives: 1. The rooms are outdated, BUT they are clean and the hotel is being renovated! This process should be done by February, according to the staff. 2. The only free internet service is provided by two computers in the lobby, where teenagers spend much of their time, unless you pay a daily fee for internet service in your room. 3. The on-site restaurants were mediocre, BUT Frank, the bartender at Molokini Bar and Grille, served delicious mai-tais and half-off appetizers every day between 5:30 and 6:30. 4. The Starbucks in the lobby (called by another name) doesn't offer the full Starbucks menu. Positives: 1. The staff from arrival to departure was AMAZING, super friendly, and knowledgeable. Upon check-in, we were given a free upgrade to a room with a king-size bed and FULL ocean view (shoutout to Ron). After an issue with smokers in the room above us, the staff graciously offered us another room with the same accommodations. At the poolside bar and cafe, Lucky, the bartender, was extremely enthusiastic and spoke to us like old friends! He mixed up an award winning blended cocktail drink called Dancing Koi and another simply called Lucky Special! Both were delicious. The valet service were also extremely friendly, interested in our daily adventures, and shared some helpful tips (shoutout to Thomas and Ed-something -- sorry!). 2. The private beach was AMAZING. It was never crowded, and we loved the fact that people from other resorts would pay for a seat on a sunset cruise that sat 100 yards away from our beach! That should speak for how beautiful the sunsets were from own secluded beach. The beach activity center also provided a variety of equipment and lessons. The rates were pretty decent, too! If you snorkel about 60 yards away from the shoreline on the north side of the beach, you may find our turtle friend! We also saw lots of tropical fish and beautiful coral reefs. 3. If you're looking for a private getaway hotel, this is the one for you! It is the LAST resort on the southwest side of Maui, just a few miles past the overcrowded Wailea resorts. It's quiet and accommodating, but not too far if you want to do touristy things. Although we didn't use it, Makena also provides a shuttle service to Wailea. TIP -- rent a car and enjoy the scenery and beauty of Maui as you drive from place to place! Overall, we loved staying here. It was quiet, the staff was great, and the price we paid matched! If you're looking for a secluded hotel where you can relax on a private beach and enjoy beautiful sunsets every night... and if you don't mind exploring the island of Maui by driving... stay here and you'll fall in love with this place! Before we landed back home, we were already discussing plans to revisit and watch the whales at sunset!

<Title>“*****FANTASTIC!****”
<Content>My daughter and I had stayed at this place twice back in 2003 when it was called Maui Prince Hotel and i was Â delighted to be back here again with my daughter and our friend, Donna. The resort is located in the upscale area of Makena/Wailea amid a beautifully-landscaped grounds. The facilities have undergone a great deal of renovation and upgrades; all rooms are spacious and very tastefully furnished, each with its own lanai, safe deposit box, refrigerator, coffee maker and flat screen TV. Each room has a large bathroom with a separate tub and a shower stall. Beautiful coy ponds and oriental gardens surround the guest rooms. The staff members, from Bell desk to Reception, Concierge and beyond were extremely friendly, accommodating and attentive and made our stay very joyful. This hotel has a beachside swimming pool and private beaches, guest laundry facilities (coin-operated as well as valet) and 4 restaurants. Golfers will feel in heaven on the fairways of the resorts beautiful golf club overlooking the Pacific Ocean and the Haleakala dormant volcano. The resort does also offer a complimentary shuttle to Wailea shopping center. A FEW FACTS: 1. They charge a $27.00 a day resort fee payable directly to the resort and that fee includes daily valet parking 2. There's no Free or wireless Internet in the resort, the connection in the rooms comes with a whopping $14.99 fee per 24 hours and is payable to the cable provider via a credit card. There are 2 computers in the lobby for free Internet access but they are available on a first-come, first-served basis. One possibility to get free in-room Internet service is to join their frequent guest program called "Iprefer" which is free of charge, but inquire at the resort if that entitles you to free Internet at the time of your stay. 3. If you're using a credit or debit card to cover your incidentals, the resort puts a hold of $100 per each day of your stay on your card/account and the unused portion will be released upon your departure. DINING: This was the only area I was not so enthused about this resort! Compared to the quality, I found the $26.00 for the breakfast buffet, or the $53.00 for the Japanese buffet rather excessive and unjustified. There's a Starbuck's in the lobby that you may want to opt for or one of the many restaurants at Wailea shopping center (2.5 miles/10 minute drive) or in Kihei (roughly 20 minutes away but plenty of great and inexpensive dining places). All in all, we loved our stay at Makena Beach and Golf Resort and would gladly stay there again and recommend it highly to everyone.

<Title>“5-star service - great place to get away from it all!!”
<Content>I booked our stay at the Makena through a discount travel site and we were beyond thrilled with the quality of service we received and the accommodations we stayed in - given the price of a lot of the resorts on Maui, it was the best value we had our entire trip. The open-air lobby is spacious and welcoming - beautifully landscaped and inviting to explore, especially in the evenings if you just need a place to walk off the indulgent meals of the day.The staff that greeted us - from the valet to the front desk - were professional & courteous and offered valuable information for navigating the local area. We did not take advantage of the restaurants on-site or the golf & tennis amenities. We did take an evening stroll on the beach and it was beautiful. Every area of the resort that we walked through was well-kept & clean - I believe they were in the middle of a facelift on the property as they were painting the lobby on our last day there. The gift shop in the lobby has a pretty extensive selection of souvenirs, clothing and food/beverages - if you forgot anything, chances are you can pick it up there. You won't be disappointed by the resort's location, either. It's in a quiet part of the island but there is plenty of shopping and some amazing restaurants nearby so you don't have to go far to find things to do. Our time on Maui was the "just us" honeymoon portion of our destination wedding (having spent a week prior to this with our friends & family touring the Big Island and Oahu) and we couldn't have asked for a more peaceful, romantic setting!! We look forward to another trip to Maui in the future and will certainly remember the Makena when booking our next vacation!

<Content>We are staying at the hotel now. Checked in at 10 PM and had repairs done till 11:30! Toilet kept flushing, sink leaked and bathroom floor flooded. Fixed it and this morning the sink leaks again. Have asked to move but have NEVER HEARD from a manager. NEVER been offered any complimentary anything. On a positive note, the staff is amazing but avoid this place until it gets a makeover.

<Title>“Undergoing Renovation”
<Content>We stayed here because of memories of Makena Beach from 30 years ago. We were never told that the hotel was undergoing renovation (even when we checked in). About 1/3 to 1/2 of the rooms are closed off due to renovation. When we first checked in, it was so quiet, I thought we were one of the few people there. We did not get a renovated room and the pool was closed. We had numerous, small problems with our room and requested compensation for the $15 a day internet connection charge (what is up with that in this day and age?). It was a hassle, but we got it. If in-room internet is not a big thing for you (they have computers available in the lobby), I'd ask for a room upgrade. Generally, even if the room had been updated;/upgraded, I wouldn't stay here again because of the location. It is just too remote (the last hotel on the road). Something closer or in Kihei or Kaonapali is better. It was actually difficult to spend the $50 resort credit we got with our room deal. The staff was really nice and tried their best to make everything right, but they don't have much to work with.

<Title>“Good location, friendly staff, but....”
<Content>We just got back from a trip to the Makena Beach Resort. We love the south side of the island...and this is as far south as you could get. This is the only resort in Makena, and I think the only resort south of Wailea (a 5 minute drive). THE GOOD: The staff was beyond friendly and was very accommodating. The rooms were comfortable and clean. No complaints there. We had an ocean view room which was facing the ocean and also the undeveloped forest like proeprty next door. It was kind of cool because we heard a variety of bird noises all day and night. It felt like we were in the middle of a jungle. Also, the hotel has a little private beach that never got too crowded. They offer board rentals and have chairs and a snack bar outside. THE BAD: The hotel was that the hotel was under construction and we weren't told about it until we got there. The pool was being resurfaced and was closed the whole time we were there. They were renovating the room next door so we heard saws and hammering one of the days which was a bit annoying. I spoke with the manager and she kindly gave us a credit for the normal $25/day resort fees that are usually charged. The other negative is the restaurant in the hotel called Cafe Kiowai. We went down for breakfast and it was a bit ridiculous. The waitress kept pushing the $25 buffet on us. We told her that we just wanted some eggs and coffee. The omelet were about $16 which is expected, but the coffee was $8 for a small or $12 for a large. I asked why they would charge so much when there is a Starbucks in the hotel and she kept saying, "see its better to get the buffet". Since the hotel is a little out of the way, it's very inconvenient to have to drive somewhere else to get a light meal.

<Title>“Beautiful beach.....outdated rooms”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Makena and had mixed reviews. The hotel was a ghost town! The restaurants were dead all hours of the day, and had the 80s look, so we never ate there. The rooms are extremely outdated...old, dirty carpet, popcorn ceilings and old tvs. On the good side was the beach. Very secluded, private and beautiful!!! The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly. This "resort" has the possibility of being incredible....but needs a major overhaul.

<Title>“Fantastic Outrigger Canoeing experience at the hotel”
<Content>This review is on the Hawaiian Outrigger Canoe and Cultural Experience only. (We did NOT stay here during this trip, although we did stay here several years ago when it was still the Maui Prince Hotel. We enjoyed that stay very much.) The hotel grounds are gorgeous, and the beach at the hotel is beautiful and pretty empty. The entire experience with the Outrigger Canoe activity was exceptional, largely due to the wonderful staff at check-in and our tour guides. This activity is basically a Hawaiian canoe ride with TWO tour guides on your canoe all to yourself! You can't get a more private tour than this. The staff and tour guides are professional, courteous, and made sure that we felt comfortable from the moment we checked in. While on the canoe, the main guide provided very detailed information on everything that we saw and answered any questions that we had. They explained everything from plants to lava to fruits to fish to Hawaiian history. Our guide even chanted these beautiful Hawaiian chants for us while we rowed, making us feel like we were truly immersed in the Hawaiian culture for just a moment. The best part was seeing a few sea turtles up close when we stopped to snorkel. When I say close I mean I could have reached over and touched it! That was quite a breathtaking experience. Unfortunately I did get seasick towards the middle/end of the trip, so I asked the guides to stop snorkeling and row us back. They were very understanding and once we returned to the beach, they stayed with us until my nausea got better. I think most people are OK with being on the ocean, but for motion-sensitive people, it's better to take your Dramamine beforehand -- no matter how "calm" the ocean looks, there is still bobbing! A big thank you to our guides for giving us such a wonderful tour and giving us so much attention. This is a great deal and I highly recommend it (with Dramamine!)

<Title>“perfect”
<Content>this place rocked. super chill, super cool, secluded and not near any other hotels or homes or shops or anything really; it was nice to literally be so far far away from anything or anyone. i see some of the bad reviews say that the resort/rooms are old. they're not that old, and who the f cares anyways, they don't advertise as some swank resort so dont expect mod furniture. everything seemed nice and clean to me. and the staff. OMG, they were all extremely happy people. super nice people. and yes, they do charge a 25 dollar per day resort fee, but that means 1) you dont have to tip anybody hahahah and 2) you get tons of free stuff like parking, shuttle service, towels, coffee and tea. its not that big of a deal honestly. the main reason i chose this place was b/c its off the beaten path and its the closest resort to Big Beach and Little Beach, which are THE beaches to go to in Maui. you can walk on foot for about 15 minutes and be at these amazing beaches; super convenient. probably the best vacation i've had in a while, and i travel extensively :) maui rocks and makena def contributed to the good vibes.

<Content>First time to Maui. Had a great experience here. Loved the 70s architecture and overall chill vibe. Not as fancy as some places, but very nice, great service and sans loud party groups. The pool was under construction, but this is not a resort where you hit the pool - the beach and scenery are too breath taking.

<Title>“Beautiful, secluded -- will definitely return!”
<Content>I stayed here with my family earlier this month and didn't want to leave. What I love about this resort is that it's slightly away from the hustle and bustle (it's literally the last resort on that stretch of Maui coast), and it is situated on a beautiful sandy beach that's perfect for swimming and snorkeling. We walked down the coast to other equally beautiful beaches that were practically devoid of people/tourists. Our room had a spectacular ocean view. The grounds are lovely. Pleasant staff. The hotel interior is highlighted by the use of beautiful wood throughout. The hotel features a simple approach to interior design -- nothing fake or over the top about this place, which I love. I understand that renovations are taking place (and we weren't impacted by any noise) -- I just hope they don't change the vibe of the hotel too much. It's the perfect, relaxing Hawaiian getaway.

<Title>“Makena Beach & Golf Resort Was Awesome!”
<Content>My wife and I stayed for 7 days at the Makena Beach & Golf Resort the first week in July 2011. We had a great time! The resort was beautiful and spaceous. Our room was on the second floor and had an almost full-on view of the beach and ocean with the west Maui mountains in the background. It was breath-taking. The staff at the resort certainly have the aloha feeling. They always made us feel so special and welcome. Each time we'd return to the resort they would welcome us back and ask us about our day. They seemed truly interested. We ate 2 times at the Molokai Bar and Grill and it was excellent both times. David waited on us and he seemed like a true friend. The Mai Tai's were great! The beach was great, and we never had any problem getting chairs and towels. The water was crystal clear (but a bit cool). We booked the deluxe snorkeling trip with the Kai Kanani 2 and we loved the fact that we boarded it right from the Makena Resort beach! This resort was exactly what we were looking for - secluded, but so close to everything else that we wanted to do on the island. We would return again in an instant!

<Title>“Great but...resort fee?”
<Content>We stayed 5 nights and overall, it was pleasant. The beachfront was the best. The pool and other areas were under renovation. They also had a quarterly pest control maintenance in each room (there were mosquitoes and fleas, but not too bad). We found the most friendly staff. Every worker greeted us with a smile and courtesy. For their service and secluded beach, I'd really go back. Here is one thing for their consideration: They charge a $25 a day fee (+ tax) which I just found out when I arrived (my fault). This fee includes valet and parking, and other amenities that many hotels offer "free" like two computers at the lobby (no wireless system), coffee and water in your room, in-room safe, daily newspaper (in the lobby), fitness center (small, in a converted guest room at the extreme corner) and a shuttle bus (3 miles range). I found this fee quite a ripoff because not everyone rents a car. They could collect a flat fee for guests who have a car and charge less for the other amenities as a resort fee. Also, since they charge $14.95 for internet services in the room, they could provide wireless in the lobby since there are two computers, and at busy hours, guests need to print their boarding pass. This was my first time in Maui and I will definitely go back, but I can't say I'll stay in the same hotel because of this fee.

There is really no need to leave the hotel since everything needed is right there. Good restaurants, pool, sandy private beach, nice staff always willing to help you even if you only need an empty plate or to go coffee cups. We would definitely like to be their guests again. If you need to leave the hotel and explore (of course) check Kihea about 20 minutes driving time. Cool places to eat

<Content>I just spent a week with my teenage daughter. The room was spotless. The view was breathtaking. The rooms, etc are being upgraded - not a big stretch. The grounds are immaculate; the staff delightful. We had a massage overlooking the beach, the gorgeous beach. A 2 minute drive to the Shops at Waiilea, either by the courtesy shuttle or my rental car (parked via valet, price included with the resort fee). This is an amazing place.

<Title>“Best beach on Maui”
<Content>This was our 6th trip to Maui and our first at this hotel. We love to spend our days on the beach, in a kayak or snorkeling!! This hotel is the place to be if you are here for these activities! We saw numerous turtles right off this beach. Nice places to snorkel right off the beach, we saw many tropical fish and coral. The staff here were very friendly and helpful. We would stay here again. Note that this hotel is not in the middle of nightlife. This was no problem for us, we didnt mind driving to Kehei or Lahaina for dinner or shopping. Also, if you are the type to want to hang at the pool all day, note the pool is somewhat smallish, but you really really need to be on the beach here!!! The restaurants here are ok. The breakfast buffet was so so, but we enjoyed lunch at the pool bar. Yes, the decor is somewhat dated, but they are remodeling now. The price was great, the location is the best in Maui. Wish I was back there right now!!

<Title>“Overall great location, good service and resort facilities with a few areas of improvement”
<Content>Overall our experience at the Makena Beach & Golf Resort was very good. Positives: Excellent service - housekeeping, pool services, beach shack were all customer oriented. Check in / out was easy and very pleasant - they even upgraded us to an ocean view room and allowed us a couple of hours late checkout. Resort facilities are very nice and well maintained - not to mention huge. Location is great and beautiful. It is secluded and has its own stretch of pristine beach (not shared with any other resort) - can see Molokini island from the beach itself. Close to big beach and the lava fields as well as some pretty cool and secluded black sand beaches. Areas for improvement - While the room, beds, etc were very comfortable and clean - the property could definitely use some updates. The bathroom and the furniture is a little dated and despite the good maintenance is showing signs of age. They still have CRT TVs in the room. I want to emphasize that this is an area of improvement. I think given the great location, their service and other resort facilities - having the rooms updated would take this hotel to the next level. The only other suggestion I would have is to include internet with the resort fee. We paid a resort fee of $25+tax per day and that did not include internet access in rooms. Seemed a little high to pay that fee effectively just for parking (there were some other things included but those are pretty obvious inclusions for any resort / hotel) Overall - again a nice resort and we had a good experience here. Thank you.

<Content>This resort is in the most beautiful location. The beach is RIGHT there and there are no other resorts anywhere around to take away from the beauty. The grounds are dated but pretty. The staff was so nice. We saw renovations beginning for a beautification process so I hesitate to say anything about the rooms. They were VERY outdated, but quiet and comfortable and we were not in our room much anyway. We did find ourselves driving a lot as it is off the beaten path but that was a nice thing too. We got a good deal, but I would not pay full price until they are done updating it.

<Title>“Great location, but poor front desk customer service”
<Content>I had some really unpleasant experiences when my wife and I had our honeymoon back in March this year. The male staff in the front desk asked us to present the booking confirmation email letter to him for check-in. He looked so impatient as I had taken quite a long time to find out the letter from our bags. Since then, he didn't smile at all, and had a poker face toward us, and very impatient to our questions regarding the hotel facilities and internet access. I understand his job may be stressful. But his behavior just made us feel unwelcome, disrespectful and upset after a long and tired flight trip to Maui and this quality of service is unacceptable as it is a 4-star resort. In addition, the room is clean but a bit old and certainly update is needed. Other staffs are really friendly and helpful and I would like to say thank you for their quality service. Overall, the location and the facilities of the resort are good but the front desk service we received were really bad and disappointed.

<Title>“Best Kept Secret...”
<Content>I've stayed at this resort seven times. I remember when it was the Maui Prince Hotel before changing ownership. My first stay was in 2000 and suffice it to say that many changes have come with the new management. I like it because it's off the beaten path... last resort on the south end of the island. It's very quiet and they have the best staff. They use to have two golf courses (the south and north courses). The south course is now closed. The rooms are very clean and this resort has "the best" beach on Maui as most don't know it's there. In room dining service has declined quite a bit; hardly any real food choices... not like it use to be. The ocean views are unreal. i usually get the largest suite they have available with a full ocean view. It's simply awesome to watch the sunset on a clear day. They use to have a great luau but that's been discontinued now. But if you're looking for a great hotel far from the bustling tourists, this is it. The north course is still a golfing challenge with great ocean views. Because many flights from Maui are late night, you can request an extended check out and that's a great perk. Thanks Maui Beach & Golf Resort for another great stay.

<Content>We just got back from this resort and it was phenomenal. We stayed in a makena suite and the views were beautiful. We stayed in a room that wasn't updated yet and it was great. I think that some people just like to complain. The customer service was outstanding and friendly. We would definitely come back especially after the renovation which is to include everything, as well as the pool. The golf was the best and it had the most hig tech golf cart and gps I've seen and I play a lot of golf. If You have a family vacation and don't want the overcrowded resort experience this is the place. The beach was amazing and uncrowded. We also asked for everything under the sun from the concierge and they delivered.

<Content>We recently stayed in one of their suites and first off the view was just beautiful!! We arrived on a Tuesday and left the following Tuesday everyday was exceptional customer service. According to my husband I can be pushy the staff was great we probably were a pain! The hotel is quiet not full of people plenty of space on the beach for spending time with out little family! We traveled with our 14 month old which they went above and beyond to accommodate! We made it a point to eat at every other resort just to check it out and man were they crowded. We enjoyed the relaxing week together!!

<Title>“The staff makes the stay special”
<Content>This is our second trip to Maui and our second stay at Makena. We love the resort and it's location, primarily because the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The grounds are gorgeous and well maintained. The common areas and our rooms have always been clean. While the resort is a more remote than others, we consider that a plus because the area is quiet. The adjacent Maluaka Beach is one of the best on the island with excellent snorkeling. There are off-site dining and shopping opportunities close by (within 5 minutes) to supplement the on site restaurant choices and all are accessible by the resort's shuttle service. All the activities of Kehei are within a 10 minute drive. We considered doing taxi and taking advantage of the shuttle service, but decided a rental car would be more convenient and cost effective for our stay. The other plus, as a runner, I enjoy starting my morning running along Makena Alanui road, much of which is along the water. There are very few cars early in the morning, the route is shaded until the sun rises over Haleakala, and the shoulder is soft and wide in some spots. While the hotel is a bit dated, it is going through a renovation. We were a little worried that the renovation would impact our stay, but we barely knew the renovation was going on. For us, the resort is nearly perfect; Makena talks a lot about the Ohana and we truly feel like family when we stay there.

<Title>“EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!”
<Content>I was herded to this hotel along with all the people from my entire AA flight that was cancelled. The airline was not very accomodating but the hotel staff more than made up for it. Initially I was a little apprehensive because of comments made by some passengers, but I was presently surprised... Although the hotel looks like something out of a late 70's early 80's movie, the rooms were spacious, I had a FANTASTIC ocean view, they were clean, and very comfortable. The beach was clean and the water was peaceful... Way more than the beaches in Wailea at the Grand Wailea. The pool and other amenities are dated but you can tell in it's hayday, this resort was IT!!! They have information in the lobby showing that they are renovating, so I plan on coming back once that happens. All in all if you are looking for laid back hotel that is close to Wailea without all the hustle, this is the place for you. BTW, the grounds of the hotel are beautiful as well.

<Content>We unexpectedly found this resort because our flight out of Maui had mechanical problems and the airline put us up at this resort. We were pleasantly surprised! The staff took care of us at 2am and even opened the small beverage area for anyone who needed a snack, etc. Everyone during our stay was accommodating and pleasant. Having stayed at Kaanapali for most of our trip, it was a breath of fresh air to have a more laid-back atmosphere. Previous comments mentioned that the rooms need updating, which they do, (and they are in the process of doing) but they were clean and comfortable. While rooms can be upgraded and remodeled, we believe customer service and friendliness are even more important to a memorable stay. Thanks Makena Beach and Golf Resort - we'll be back, hopefully soon!

<Title>“a great place to relax and watch nature at its best”
<Content>What a great resort. I was a bit concerned when I read some of the reviews before we left for the Makena so expected something a bit dingy. The resort itself has undergone some ownership changes and is currently in the process of an upgrade. Saying that we had an ocean view room with a private lanai and a king sized bed. The room could have done with a bit of TLC but actually it was nothing of any concern. The hotel and beach are practically side by side and the hawaiian green turtles are right at your feet - literally. We went on a snorkelling trip but saw more turtles at our own resort only feet from the shoreline. The hotel was really quiet but for us that was brilliant. some of the other resorts in Maui and very commercial and you have to queue for everything. If you want to relax - this is the place to go. There is a free shuttle that runs on request to local restaurants/hotels and valet parking is included in your fees. The Sunday Brunch was lovely and so was the hotel restaurant. Breakfast was nothing special no more than the usual hotel fare, but there was sufficient choice every day and we ate well. the staff were lovely - always chatty but respectful.

<Title>“Not bad, depends on what you paid”
<Content>I got a great deal on Priceline, so I really wasn't that upset that the resort wasn't perfect. There are definitely needed improvements of the place. The rooms are very outdated. Mine smelled like my grandfather's motor boat (stale, mildew). Just open the screen door and it was OK. Sleeping with the screen door open was amazing. The sounds of the ocean and waking up the sunshine was amazing. The pool is old, the hot tub is ghetto, but overall, not a bad deal as long as you don't pay the retail price. The beach location is awesome as well. I wouldn't eat the hotel... overpriced and OK quality. We had breakfast buffet one morning. Our table was outside on the patio. We were bombarded with birds, and the chairs were dry rotted (my partner almost fell through his). Again, if you can overlook the bad parts and embrace the good, you will enjoy this hotel. Just don't expect perfection.

<Content>Came to Makena knowing of bad reviews and didn't find the hotel ambience that bad. Room is comparable to a 4 star hotel. However any interaction with staff is horrible. I received a beachside massage that was the worst massage ever, I highly doubt the masseuse was certified. The poolside bartender said he hated his job. The event admin said he was too busy to book a whale watching trip and would call us back...he called us back while we were on the whale watching trip...good thing we booked it ourselves. Every morning my coffee at statbucks within the hotel cost something different even though it was the same order. Sunday at the pool is clearly bring your family to work day as it was filled with locals so much so that we left the pool. The hotel bones are good, the staff is horrible. Dining options are none, you will need to leave to go out to eat.

<Title>“Excellent Resort-Undervalued”
<Content>For our second trip to Maui, we booked a 7 night stay at a major chain resort at Wailea, Maui, HI. Because of false advertisement of policy at the chain resort, we checked out of the chain the next morning . . . things were not looking good. We used our Frommer's Guide to try to find another resort on Maui for our next 6 nights. Frommer's listed this resort, formerly known as Maui Prince as an 2.5 star rating at the end of its list of resort listings. Going down the list and fearing that we were going to have to hotel hop (Kea Lani could put us up for 4 nights), we finally got to the end of the list and this listing. From the moment the reservationist answered our call, everything went "right." Even though she didn't show an availability for 6 nights, understanding our dilemma, she put us on hold to speak with upper management and successfully secured us a room with balcony for the entire 6 nights for around $300 per night which included 24 hr. internet service, resort fee and valet parking (as we found at the chain all of this is very pricey). Given our situation (Maui for 6 nights and no lodging), we left the chain and headed south fearing what shape 2.5 stars meant. When we pulled into the resort, we thought for certain we were at the wrong place . . . it was beautiful, just like you would imagine an Hawaiian resort, the grounds beautifully landscaped. We were greeted at the entrance with leis, the first we had received since arriving in Hawaii. We went to the front desk and Ron greeted us warmly and seemed to know in advance of our prior troubles (my husband was still fuming about the chain) and entertained us with assurances and calm. At 9 a.m. our room was not ready and we certainly understood that since we had made the reservation 30 minutes earlier. In the meantime, Ron encouraged us to have breakfast and use the property while the room was being readied. We were greeted to a changing room with full bath, so that we could use the pool and beach and our valuables were safely locked up for us. The lobby areas were refreshing, breezy and really pretty with great Koi ponds. From the moment we pulled into the resort, our vacation was saved and wonderful, thanks to the Makena Beach & Golf Resort. The room with a giant balcony and oceanview was large and roomy and all amenities (coffee make, mini-frig, hairdryer, safe) were provided Our room was bright, clean and airy. We noticed that the rooms will be being redecorated during 2011, but our accommodations were great, very pleasantly appointed. The layout of the hotel and rooms are great, all the rooms seem to have an oceanview and through your room entrance, a view of the gorgeous mountainside. The gift-shop had everything one needed and was very reasonably priced. They stock sodas, chips, cookies, beer, and even stocked my favorite Merlot. There is also a coffee bar (Starbuck's coffee) with freshly made picnic foods, here the hotel offers a complimentary local newspaper Monday thru Saturday. All service was friendly, expedient and excellent. I ordered room service coffee every morning, breakfast on the balcony and late afternoon cocktails (and the room service staff seemed to anticipate my call). They seemed to know who I was and what I wanted. The food on site was excellent. An extraordinary breakfast buffet was available with inside/outside dining everyday. The Molokini Bar & Grill for the evening was excellent, some of the best food I've eaten and Celia, our waitress, was a sweetheart. The oceanside spa was excellent and had a great massage by well-trained therapist, I melted into nirvana while inhaling a wonderful aroma under a soft ocean breeze. The beach, ah, one of the largest in Maui. Unlike the chain resort with no real beachfront, the Makena Beach & Golf Resort fronted a very big and deep beach. We stayed at the Kea Lani in 2001 and this 5 star at the time fronts a very small beach but big pools - why go to the ocean to sit at a pool; we have a pool at home. And location, location, location: at the very end of Wailea, but this is a good thing too; it is the last resort along resort-row, just above Makena Beach and Oneloa (Big Beach), making it away from the most congested tourist and shopping traffic. I can't say enough good things about this resort, we felt truly pampered during our stay and have now been introduced to the Preferred Hotel Group, we will look for them again.

<Title>“Yuck! Black mold in my room.”
<Content>The manager was great and moved us to another room and said he would take that room "out of service" but the next room was not much better. This place is so run down. It's just awful. All we kept hearing about is how they were going to remodel but that doesn't help us now. We were suppose to stay 4 nights but left after one night and stayed at the Fairmont which is more expensive but so worth the difference. At the Makena Beach and Golf Resort, the staff, the location, the view... all nice... but the hotel? It's just yuck!

<Title>“Beautiful Resort with Outstanding Beach and Service”
<Content>We had never been to Maui and enjoyed staying here due to its spacious and beautiful grounds, outstanding beach, nice rooms and excellent service. Enjoyed the happy hour at the golf clubhouse as well as drinks at the pool. Our room had a view of the grounds and ocean looking south towards Molikini. It was quite beautiful and we liked the sounds of all the birds from our room. We were able to enjoy the beach, pool and restaurants and thought that everything was great. The only problem we noticed was that the room balconies created alot of noise from persons on adjoining balconies - not a big deal, but annoying if your neighbor was loud. In summary, we were quite satisfied and very much enjoyed our stay.

<Title>“Was worried by poor reviews but great place”
<Content>We booked an ocean front room and were upgraded to a suite - living room, bed room, 2 bathrooms. Hotel gradually refurbishing room, but ours not done yet. Still very clean and comfortable (I am quite picky but still posh enough form me) and views were gorgeous as right off the ocean. Bed a bit soft. Staff were friendly and helpful. Only had breakfast there - buffet good. The water garden/koi pond in middle of hotel with doors to rooms overlooking is beautiful. Pool basic, but we like the beach (beautiful)and snorkling (reef off the beach) and boats going from beach to Molokini - probably closest hotel. parking very close if you don't want to use free valet parking.

<Title>“Beautiful place for relaxation”
<Content>We spent 5 nights here on short notice as i had some unexpected medical issues arise and we had to extend our stay by 1 week. The front desk staff were most accommodating and polite. We were offered a very good rate. The rooms are abit dated but very clean and spacious and i did see the plans for a total remodel of all the rooms which i understand are underway. The grounds are absolutly fabulous and i loved the atrium area with all the greenery, flowers, ponds and water falls. The pool area and bar service was very nice and clean with lots of loungers. The beach was amazing but could use some new comfy lounge chairs, otherwise we spent a few afternoons tanning, swimming and watching the whales. The food here was excellent in my opinion, wether it was at the poolside for lunch or at the Molokini bar for drinks and dinner. The breakfast buffet was nice with a good selection but it is hit or miss depending on the morning as not every morning did they have someone available at the ommolette station to cook so you had to order from your server so your eggs came out after you were finished your breakfast. The buffet was way to expensive for what was offered ( 25.00 pp). The hotel has a nice sized gift shop with reasonable prices, starbucks for morning coffee, computers in the lobby. The whole resort was kept very clean and tropical. The staff at the valet parking were wonderful, friendly and most helpful. Overall i believe once the room renovations are complete this hotel will be a 5 star resort. The location is nice because it's out of the way, quiet and has the real Hawaii tropical feel i like. If you don't want to cook or clean and just want to relax and be pampered then i would reccommend this property :)

<Title>“Needs Updating but Very Clean, Friendly Staff and Great Location”
<Content>My wife and I volunteered to say an extra night in Maui when our American Airlines flight to Dallas was oversold. We were more than happy to stay an extra night in paradise on their dime and get $500 each towards our next tickets. When we went to the ticket counter to volunteer, I made sure to ask where we would be staying, and was told either the Grand Wailea or the Makena Beach Resort. Obviously I was hoping for the GW but was aware of the Makena's great location and the fact that it was on the beach. After reading reviews before we ever got to Maui, I was expecting an outdated hotel with some issues. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. Yes, it it older and outdated but it is very clean (at least our room and the public areas were), the staff were all very friendly and helpful and the beach is outstanding. Yeah, the pool is small and the hot tub(s) is/are above-ground, but that was all expected. My only real problem was that the walls are very thin and you can easily hear others around you from your room. My wife and I always travel with ear plugs so that was never a real problem for us. Since we didn't have a rental car we ate dinner at the Molokini bar & grill and it was better than I expected, and they had great live music during dinner. You are still paying Maui prices, however. This resort is going to be fantastic when the renovations are done. The overall layout of the hotel is great and like I've said it's in a nice, secluded location with a great beach. The large interior courtyard/garden/koi pond area is really cool. I think the company who purchased this place in September made a great decision. If you can tolerate the fact that it's outdated, a bit loud and doesn't have the best pool/hot tub, you will be pleased.

<Title>“You get what you pay for”
<Content>We booked this resort as part of an American Express travel deal as a quick way to escape the bay area winter weather. The Hotel is celebrating 25 years and hasn't been updated at all over the past 25 years. We visited several other Wailea/Makena hotels and the Makena Beach & Golf Resort was by far the most outdated resort in the area. The Good: Service- 99% of the hotel employees are extremely helpful and want to make your stay pleasant. This includes front desk/housekeeping/valets. The only place the service was bad was at the hotel pool/pool bar. The hotel needs to add more staff to this area. There were only 2 people working 15 dining tables plus all the pool lounge chairs, about 50-80. The were running around doing their best but the were under staffed. Location- We loved how close this resort is Makena Beach. This is the closest resort to the beach. It's also not far from Wailea and the resorts, shops and restaurants of that area. Kihei is also about a 15-20 minute drive. The Bad: Needs to be remodeled- The hotel has a board in the lobby showing you all the updates that are planned. I'm glad to see the resort has this planned. Fitness Center- Is located in room 101 and it's horrible. We ended up buying a week's membership at another local gym because the hotel's wasn't bearable. In Summary- If you're looking for a nice resort that you plan to spend a lot of time at relaxing and eating at- this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for a place to spend the night at but plan to use the local beaches and eat outside of the resort a lot, this place if fine.

<Title>“Beautiful from the outside but beware when you get in your room..”
<Content>Here on business with my airline. Had to come here since finding a room at this time impossible. Hotel looks fine from the outside but insde is as old as the Brady Bunch's house. Furniture and fixtures are from the 80's. My biggest problem though is the dampness of the room. When crawling into bed it is very damp aswhen you wake up from camping out in a tent. There is mildew in bathroom and all vents are filthy. I hd them change me rooms but second just the same. Have tld my airline crew scheduler and said I would rather sleep in termina than tis room. Hopefully will be out of here tomorrow

<Title>“Great Place to Stay on Maui”
<Content>Makena is a great place to stay on Maui. It's well away from the hustle & bustle of Kihei and Lahina with very little road traffic. The staff went out of their way to welcome us and were friendly throughtout. We had a "Honu" room with a great view of the ocean - watched whales whenever we were home. Room was quality was good. There were very few kids but the real bonus was no twenty/thirty somethings yelling in the hallways at three in the morning. Best beach in the region - private, quiet and shallow water. The Golf Course was perfection. The staff were wonderful all week and the couse was in great shape. Tip: Play your first round from the "Resort" tees to learn the course, then move back to your preferred tee. The views will throw off your first round so just give in, take pictures and enjoy it::) Tip: Makena no longer has a Luau so if you want to see one, the concierge can book for you - avoid the one at Grand Wailea next door. It was one of the two major disappointments of our holiday. One hour of mediocore dancing on a low, rickety old stage with very poor sight lines - total waste one money. Tip: Helicopter tours are also a major waste of cash. With the height restrictions they have to follow, you fly very high and far from anything worth seeing. They typically fly counterclockwise around the island so if you're on the outboard side of the aircraft, you get a wonderful view of the ocean and not much else. I would recommend Makena to anyone wanting a peaceful holiday, a great golf course and beautiful views.

<Title>“Beware”
<Content>This hotel is way down the beach from the much nicer hotels in Wailea. We selected it because we thought it was less expensive. When we selected our room on the hotel site, a little box popped up with a "Total" amount. In the price breakdown, fees are listed as zero. Beware: elsewhere on the site is a statement that there is a $25/night "Resort Fee." Plus, if you want internet access, you will pay an additional $15.57/day. The room and bathroom were dingy. And the acoustics were such that when we were in our room with the glass doors open, we could hear people on nearby balconies as clearly as if they were in the room with us - every word. One woman was dictating a book or an article - not very relaxing.

<Title>“Makena BEACH...... says it all...”
<Content>Maybe I am just a savvy travelerâ€¦ but I am amazed at the reviewers who claim they did not know the hotel was in need of an upgrade, or that the hot tubs were above ground, or that there was a $25 per night room fee for amenities. If they are here writing a review after their tripâ€¦ didnâ€™t they get online and check out the hotel website and Trip Advisor prior to their trip???? Having said thatâ€¦. This was my first trip to Hawaii. We chose the beautiful island of Maui for many reasons, and we chose the Wailea-Makena area for its quiet and secluded location. We chose the Makena Beach and Golf Resort because it is the last resort on the south side, offering a quiet and private feel. We also felt the rates were very reasonable, as we had lots of activities planned and did not expect to spend much time sitting in a hotel while we were on the island of Maui. We were very happy with our choice. We arrived after midnight- due to the storm of the century sweeping through the mid-west. The valet was right there to greet us and help with our luggage, and they were amazing throughout our entire stayâ€¦(even though we are end-of-the-week tippers)!!! Check-in was very easy, and we were in our large room in a matter of minutes. We opened the large patio doors and listened to the ocean, and woke to the most amazing view of whales dancing in the bay!!! We slept with the patio doors open each night, and the ocean lulling us to sleep!! The bed was the most comfortable I have had in a hotel, and house-keeping had our room cleaned early each morning. We ate at the hotel restaurant and found the food prices to be comparable with other restaurants on the island. The pool bar was entertainingâ€¦. And the specialty drinks were delicious! Because we had a refrigerator in the room, we were able to drive to Safeway and purchase items to have on hand for picnics and excursions. It was a nice amenity. The most amazing part of the entire resort is the beach!!! The feels like a private beach, and the hotel offers great amenities! The guys at the beach house are fabulous!!! They are very knowledgeable, enjoy the water, and watch for guest safety at the same time. We rented kayaks and had the most amazing whale encounterâ€¦. A baby and mother whale surfaced only 10 feet from our kayaks and slowly, but gently swam past us before going under again. AWESOME!!!! All the staff were very helpful and gracious! We did not spend a lot of time at the hotel, but were treated like we were known and recognized when we saw any Makena staff, from the gardeners to the concierge. If you are looking for awesome views, a very comfortable bed, clean room, large balcony, friendly staff, quiet and secluded area, a spectacular beach, all at a most reasonable rateâ€¦. Makena Beach and Golf Resort is an excellent choice. And to those who wrote a mixed or bad reviewâ€¦â€¦..â€¦ HANG LOOSE!!!!!

<Title>“Another wonderful stay at this Hotel.”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from a 6 night stay at this hotel. The last time we stayed here was in '08 when it was still the "Maui Prince". We had a great stay then, and we were hoping that our stay this time under new managment would be just as great. We were not disappointed. We had a little problem with our room when checking in, only because we had requested a double room when making the reservation, and at check-in we were given a king room. We were getting a little upset b/c I clearly booked a double room on my reservation for our comfort, and the front desk clerk was not being extremely helpful. After a few minutes in our King Room, we decided to go back down and re-request the double room we booked. There was another clerk working the desk, and he was most helpful in moving around our reservation and giving us a great double oceanfront room that we had requested. We were satisfied going forward with our room. It was very clean throughout. I did not see one bug in the room the entire time except an occasional mosquito that would come in at times b/c the lanai was open. The room was spacious, and the the beds were wonderful and plush. We ate a couple of times at the Molikini Lounge downstairs. As anywhere in Maui, the food is a little pricey but convenient and very good. The waitresses at the restaurant were so warm and friendly to talk to, we felt like we've been friends forever. The Mai Tai's at both the restaurant and pool are the best to be found on Maui. Lucky the pool bartender was so friendly and made us feel welcome and comfortable being there. The guys at the activity hut were so friendly as well and helped get us the proper gear for snorkeling. The beach is one of a kind, and great for swimming and snorkeling. All in all, it was a wonderful stay, and I know it will be even more amazing once the remodel is complete. We look forward to our next stay.

<Title>“Perfect Hawaii Location”
<Content>We stayed here two nights out of our 2 week stay in Maui. I love Makena. Love it. It's everything I think Hawaii should be. The Makena Golf Resort is the last resort on the south side of the island. It's quiet and less crowded compared to the west side of the island. The resort has a charming old school Hawaiian feel to it. The views from the rooms were exquisite. The pool was a little small but the resort was not packed so it wasn't a problem. If the resort had been at full capacity I think it would have been an issue. The beach right in front of the resort is gorgeous! We so enjoyed it, great snorkeling, lots of turtles and not overly crowded. The rooms were prefect for us. They were not updated, but they were clean, comfortable and had a nice feel. I would definitely go back. My disclaimer: We booked our rooms on priceline for a discounted rate. If I had paid full price, I'm not sure my review would be so glowing. But for the price it was wonderful!

<Title>“Great location, but needs some improvements”
<Content>Good things...we loved the location!! Off the beaten path, but only 4 min. from Wailea restaurants and 10 min from Kehei grocery store and restaurants. 5 min from La Pereuse Bay for great hiking, sunsets, and volcanic rock next to the beautiful ocean views. It was great to have our own beach on the property with great snorkling right and rental equipment right at the pool. Also, the snorkel boat that goes to the Molakini Crater picked us up right on the beach...15 min boat ride to the crater, then 10 min to Turtle town, and 15 min right back to our beach. Only 5 min to Big Beach that had plenty of parking, is huge, and gorgeous!! My husband and son golfed one full day and twilight golf 2 days. They have golfed at many beautiful courses and both thought this was one of the best ever! Not crowded and no golf holes on the road. We were a 5 min walk from a church from 1830's that faced the ocean. We went to their outside Xmas eve service. Unbelievable with a harp, child and adult hulu dancers, choir, trumpet, candles/glow sticks, and songs in english and hawaian. You were supposed to bring a flower to use as ornaments on the two large live evergreen trees. All that said the hotel needs updating particularly in the pool/hot tub area (horrible). Fitness center beyond lame. We did not eat any meals there (to expensive and we like to explore outside the hotel) the rooms were adequate but need updating (the view from our patio deck was lovely). Conceirge nice. Price reasonable. Lobby asian garden amazing. Would return. Keep in mind that if you are the big all inclusive resort, rarely leave the resort type, this will be a disappointed. If location is everything and you like to explore the island daily, take side trips, and try different restaurants(Sansei Sushi in Kehei) this is a great spot.

<Title>“After 25 years finally remodeling BUT RAISING RATES!!!!!!”
<Content>Upon departure we wanted to inquire to send our paremts here next year, only to learn that all the rates are going up because the hotel is remodeling, so I guess we all have to pay for it!!! That's too bad because the hotel needs A TON of work done if you look all around. The best things about the hotel are the MOST EXCELLANT staff ( although a shoestring staff at best), the location (if you like been away from things ( quietness). Also, the breakfast is very good. The in room dining menu and food is just unacceptable. We had to call the Four Seasons drive out dining and take out from there. The pool bar food is okay at best and the drinks at the pool will put one in a sugar coma. ( look at the ingredients they use) Also, the pool area is very small and outdated. We know in these uncertain times we live in, that there will be other places close by that are competitive to their current rates. Hence, we will not return to pay for their 20 year over due remodeling .project To the top mgmt, that's just the cost of doing business. There is a lot more mgmt needs to do other then add some paint and new furniture before this becomes a 3-4 star hotel.

<Title>“Bad customer service”
<Content>On January 17th my wife, daughter and I booked 2 rooms for 3 nights at the Makena Resort. We have stayed there earlier in the year. This stay was a very unpleasant; one for several reasons. The service from one of the Managers on duty (male) was rude and made us feel very uncomfortable and un-welcome. The front desk staff (supervisor and manager) became very demanding and un-pleasant to communicate with. Our first morning at the resort we had a flood in the bathroom from the sink area that flooded the entire bathroom. We did not receive an apology or any type of compensation for the inconvenience. Over all I would give a very poor rating of the resort staff and not recommend this resort to others. T. Gallegos

<Title>“Disappointed Big time.”
<Content>I booked this Hotel for 6 nights. The employes were very friendly and helpful. But we had problems from the day we got to Maui. We booked a Room & Ride deal through the Hotel. We got to the car rental they only had half of the paper work, so we had to sit and wait for an hour and a half to get that all taken care of. We get to the Hotel and not a problem checking in. We had to get tv remotes exchanged twice as they did not work. I now we were not to be in our rooms in Hawaii, but 5 hours difference things were closed early in the morings. Then our termastat did not work, it stayed on all the time got to cold in the room. Then people below us were just talking and it sounded like they were in our room. We even had our doors shut. Just to many things was going wrong. We only stayed the first 3 day of our stay there and spent our rest at another Hotel down the street. The room was very clean, the bed was very comfy & view was good.

<Title>“This place has it all and its all wonderful.”
<Content>All the hotel staff were friendly and helpful. They would remember little things you liked and have them ready for you. For example my Mom likes her soda in a cup with ice so the coffee shop would start getting it ready for her when they saw her. Later the people at the pool would replace her ice if it had melted. The surf shop people offered to store the kids beach toys so we didn't have to carry them back and forth. The hotel offers free shuttle service to and from local attractions. The concierge did a great job directing us to wonderful restaurants and activities. The rooms were clean and big and the beds were comfortable. They are renovating them and our room was not yet renovated so the furniture had some scratches and the TV was not a flat screen but worked fine. The bathrooms has a separate room for the toilet, a shower/bath and a shower with nice products provided. Each room had a refrigerator that you could fill with what you wanted rather than one packed with junk they want you to buy. They also gave you free bottled water. The location was wonderful. The pool is basic but nice. The surf at the beach could get rough but you could snorkel right there if it wasn't. You could see whales in the distance and we saw a couple get married on the beach.

<Title>“Amazing honeymoon resort”
<Content>My husband and I came here for our honeymoon in September. We had an absolutely amazing time. His family had been raving about their last trip to the resort formerly known as (the) Prince, and we decided it would be good for our honeymoon. What we loved most was the quietness of the resort. It was never too busy, very calm and relaxing. We ended up practically never leaving--we'd sleep in, head down to the resort beach, and when the winds kicked up we'd head to the pool and order the fish tacos (Mmmm!! our favorite) and some drinks and just lounge. It was perfect-our room had an amazing view and the front desk people were so nice to us! The restaurants lacked a little, but we LOVED the breakfast buffet, so we were happy! We're hoping to come back for our 1-year anniversary! Thank you guys for making our honeymoon so memorable. :)

<Title>“Can't wait to come back.”
<Content>Our party of 8 (4 adults & 4 children) stayed at the hotel seven nights during the first week of January 2011. We had two Makai rooms which offered outstanding oceanviews. The rooms were larger than the average hotel room, clean and comfortable. The furniture & fixtures were somewhat dated but functional and everything was in working order. Our only suggestion is to have lighting on the lanai. The property has a wonderful beach which was never crowded. We were able to do snorkeling, paddleboarding, and canoeing whenever we desired. The property has a very secluded feel to it but actually is only a few minutes by car to many great shops and restaurants in Kihei and Wailea. It is also only a short jog to big beach. The property itself has a unique achitectual design and the grounds were beautiful and well maintained. The hotel personnel from the front desk to housekeeping to the valet (which always got our cars within a few minutes day or night) to the beach personnel were very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. Based on mixed nature of the reviews, we were unsure what to expect. Although it does not have the plushness of a Four Seasons type resort, it is an outstanding value. Overall, we had a great stay and can't wait to come back.

<Title>“Beachfront, clean rooms and great front desk staff!”
<Content>Stayed just one night to finish off a week in Maui - we wished we had spent the entire week at the hotel. The pros to this "older beauty" of a hotel are the immaculately clean bathrooms and rooms, the beds which are as nice if not nicer than the Westin Heavenly beds and the incredible views, lovely grounds and BEACHFRONT access - no road to dodge traffic across. Also the balcony was nice - a semi-waterfront room the furniture is older out on the lanai/balcony but the view is GORGEOUS! At the price point this is the most affordable location and gorgeous property (although yes it is looking a bit tired). The few cons were the food was fairly awful; we ate at the pool side bar and it was fine but for dinner tried the more casual of the two restaurants as sushi wasn't what we felt like (there are only two dinner location options). The food was bad - like beyond average - similar to what you would get in a large american chain restaurant or a Kelseys in Canada...the prices are also very high for the basic food. Also the casual restaurant looks like an awful convention room - not sexy, polynesian or hawaiian at all...you can't even really say a sports bar (although there were a few large tv's over the bar). That room REALLY needs an update or image decision! lol Other than the restaurant (our server was very sweet at the restaurant although very nervous - and I worked in the hotel industry for years so I know what newbie nerves are when dealing with guests) and a weird moment at lunch when our waitress at the poolside walked up to us out of nowhere and looked off into space and said "someones gone in the water" stating a man was lost - then when I asked someone else it was a misunderstanding between a husband and wife..she was a bit odd... BUT!!!! really you can go elsewhere for dinner there are so many other options and for the price overall the room was spotless, bed so comfy, towels were fluffy and ready to go whenever we needed them I would recommend this place no problem..It's NOT five star but it doesn't claim to be - it's also significantly less expensive than some of the other hotels in Wailea/Makena (the Grand Wailea really starts around $500/night for a basic room if they are even available) so keep in mind that it is reflected in the price point. Front staff (I think I dealt with Ron??) were great, very friendly, helpful and we really appreciated the use of a hospitality suite to shower off before our evening flight - thank you! Hope to return! (only other side note - resort fees are a joke - $25 per day - just roll it into the price it's not like it is optional.... also charging $20 per day ($50 per week) for wireless these days is very tacky.... just my 2cents!)

<Title>“Don't expect 4 star service”
<Content>I just came back form this resort and had a few comments about this place and the new ownership. I expected what the stars state which is 4 star hotel and really I experienced more 2 to 3 star service. My family decided last minute to take a trip there because my mother in law is terminally I'll and she just wanted to see hawaii one last time so I found this resort which Should Have measured up a 4 star with the likes of a westin which is a 4 star and we love westin properties but sorely it did not. Please keep in mind this hotel was very vacant with really a small amount of guests compared to the size of the property. We went out to the pool area to get towels for the beach and Waited for 5min 10min 15 min No one came so I told my husband to wait and I went to go try the beach front pool service I saw a guy there and asked him for towels he responded with "I can only give you 2 towels " I said I needed 3 his response was sorry I don't have any I stood there shocked that A no one really else was there and B that The cabana guy was not prepared with towels anyways I just stood there and he then said fine here's another towel so he had them under the counter the whole time bur did not want to give me another why I'm not sure. WoW I was pissed but what really got me angry was we realized our flight the last day was a late night flight they would not accommodate us they did allow my very Sick mother in law to stay in here room but the manager I spoke with did not seem to really care about our issue he was nickel and dimming to get an extra 50.00 to stay later which is unacceptable considering they charge a 25.00 a day fee for nothing it's a crock fee they slap on cause they can they give you water and free valet and a tiny gym we never used which should be included in my opinion that's like renting a room and charging for sheets on the bed geeshh!!! One last thing to comment on is in my experience the higher star properties if there is availably with automatically upgrade you but I guess that's 4 and 5 stars for you because although we got a ok room they had ocean front rooms just sitting vacant in this giant empty hotel what would it have hurt this hotel to have made it a really nice experience for us not to mention my terminally ill mother in law to have that type of view. Bottom line don't expect much here and you won't be disappointed. was at 12 we had a small child with us and asked if we could stay

<Title>“3rd time is not a charm”
<Content>March 2010 was our 3rd stay at the *new* Makena Beach & Golf Resort - as many already know this property used to be the Maui Prince hotel - it's the last hotel, up the hill, on the right as you head towards Big (or Little Beach). We tried to be loyal spring break vacationers, however this year we are definitely going to look elsewhere. The "Aloha Spirit" was definitely lacking in 2010 - rude wait staff, the pool towel policy became a running joke w/ our teenagers (the resort was VERY concerned about how you got your poolside towels, how many towels you took, returning of the towels - as if baggage space isn't already a premium, who really wants to take lame towels home from Maui!) btw, you would have been surcharged at check-out if your towel balance was off! (by not returning your 'towel card') eesh! We avoided most meals at the hotel, as there are so many better choices elsewhere (other resorts in Wailea, the town of Kihei..) we did make the mistake of ordering food poolside (on a not very busy afternoon) - BIG disappointment, both in service, availability and food quality. Best advice is to grab your coffee at the little shop off the lobby & head out on your daily excursion. The big plus for this location, well, is the location. We did love the beach, it has a very private feel to it - and of course the weather - Makena seems to never disappoint - the Makena Beach & Golf Resort however needs some work.

<Title>“AWESOME”
<Content>What a wonderful stay. Spent a week there, it could not have been a better spot. You can get local hitting the beaches and trails to the south or just pop in on the Four Seasons for High Times. The evening restaurant needs more menu options over sushi and dont forget to make sure your sliding doors are shut just right to get the AC to turn on.

<Title>“Great, private beach. Beautiful landscape. A dream vacation come true!”
<Content>The beach is worth the stay alone. Grounds are beautiful and clean. Rooms are a little dated, but nice & clean. Customer service very accomodating to our needs. The resort is within driving distance to everything. We loved that the beach was less crowded than Ka'anapali. Golf course was gorgeous and amazing. Great place for snorkeling in the morning. A popular spot for a turtle viewing area within swimming distance of hotel. We swam with the turtles. Closest boat ride to Molokini (10 minute boat ride). Before we booked our vacation, we did our homework on all the different options on hotels and it paid off for us, as everything was perfect. We had a blast! We will go again for sure!

<Title>“Do not recommend!”
<Content>Disappointed in the way this hotel does business. We purchased the Makena Beach Resort Gold card for Hawaii residents which includes 2 free nights and a couple 80% off coupons, along with other benefits (for a considerable fee). However, it seems once the resort sold multiple packages to local residents citing the great benefits, the "new ownership" decided not to honor the certificates in the same manner they were sold (no weekends). They claim they have the right to modify "black out dates", but it feels like they took advantage of the local clientele and sold us something we couldn't use (generally people who live and work here cannot stay at a hotel during the week). The selling point was to be able to enjoy a "stay-cation" at home on a weekend. We have many friends and family who visit this island on a yearly basis, and you can be sure word will spread not to use your hotel. Thus, after staying at the hotel on one occasion (took weekday off of work for bday), one can clearly see why the hotel has had "ownership issues" and has to sell "questionable" certificates to get people to stay there ~ definitely not very clean and deteriorating (although the beds were comfortable). We will definitely recommend our friends and family stay at the other nicer, albeit a bit more expensive, hotels in the area.

<Content>I was so scared to come here due to the bad reveiws! DONT GO BY THEM!! We pick the right hotel. The views were wonderful, the beach was the best, the staff was like extended family (warm and caring), the beds were great. Yes it did need a little updating but you forgot all about it after one day. We have stayed at other hotels and this is my favorite.

<Title>“Excellent service..!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at Makena Beach & Golf Resort for 7 nights recently and were quite pleased with the hotel. That's why I was very surprised at some of the harsh reviews I've seen here because I think it was uncalled for. First: the staff really knew how to treat their guests with true Aloha hospitality. When we arrived, we were greeted with a lei made of shells with a warm welcome from everyone we passed at the lobby. We booked our stay through Priceline (a bid) so we were unsure what kind of room and what view we'll be given. To our delightful surprised, we found our room to be spacious, clean, with partial golf course / ocean view. The bedroom area was spacious enough to fit a king size bed, a long sofa with coffee table, a writing desk, and the usual hotel furniture. It also had a real balcony in which you could actually walk about (not the tiny stand-up balcony) complete with a decent size patio set (not the tiny cafe/bistro set) with a couple of benches and drying rack to dry your swim suits. There's a separate area for a double door closet to hang your clothes, a small fridge, and a long marbel counter that held our daily amenities. I also liked the bathroom that had 2 separate showers (a shower stall and bath tub with shower), so both my husband and I could jump into the shower separately at the same time after a hot day at the beach. So with all of those, how could one consider the room small? Our only complain was the bed. We prefer our bed extra firm, and the bed at the hotel was super soft. The staff let my husband tried out 4 different rooms in search of a firmer bed, then offered to put a bed board underneath our bed that solved the problem. The hotel's landscape was absolutely beautiful and meticulously maintained, and the koi garden in the middle of the hotel was really beautiful. I haven't even mentioned the beach yet, which was never crowded and allowed a lot of rooms for everyone to enjoy. Honestly, I didn't understand what some of the posters expected, and to compare this hotel to those at Wailea is like comparing apples and oranges. I paid less than half at this hotel for what I would have paid at the Grand Wailea! The hotel does charge $25 resort fee a day on top of your room charges that covers services such as: self and valet parking, use of gym facility, your daily room amenities, use of 2 computers and a printer at the hotel lobby, etc. I wish it would cover free wireless internet access too. Everyone was attentive and cared about their work, clean, beautiful location, spacious room. All in all, it was a great stay and I would recommend this highly to anyone visiting this area.

<Title>“tired, dismal, remote, two star at best...”
<Content>might have been ok twenty years ago (in fact employee today told me it has not been renovated for at least fifteen years) this hotel is most certainly not a three star or above property. It needs total remodel and updating, seems to be getting some paint in the lobby area but needs at least paint everywhere and all areas in and out seem worn and old. the jacuzzis are plastic above ground and i have never seen such on any property i have stayed.. the pool area is a horrible cement surface and again dismal. numerous local staff at the hotel and other places told me the hotel has been "distressed" in recent years and is now under new ownership. DO NOT STAY here until you are sure it has been updated or unless you get an incredible cheap deal and dont mind motel style rooms. Beach is ok, staff are pleasant but aware of the challanges ... resorts down the road in Walai are all nice .. go there.

<Content>Wonderful stay here. Incredible views out of our large room and from our lanai. Quiet, comfortable bed, birds abound. Delightful! Good buffet breakfast...had to buy the granola when we found it Upcountry! Best for me was the lomi lomi massage by Renee out in the cabana by the ocean. Pure bliss. I shall be going back to that in my mind all winter long! Very close to Great Beach for swimming and we missed going to Bev Gannon's restaurant at the golf driving range, but know it is great as we went to her Upcountry one!

<Title>“Paradise on earth”
<Content>Let me start by saying the negative reviews I have read of this resort seem to be a bit pretentious. Myself and my partner found this resort to be perfect for our Hawaii vacation. The resort is really nice and the garden which fills the atrium area of the hotel is beautifully maintained. The birds fill the palm trees each evening and make lots of noise every morning to greet the rising sun. I thought it added to the tropical feel of the islands. The best amenity was the beach right in front of the resort. It is protected on both sides by the lava rock outcroppings which provides more privacy for the hotel guests and offers awesome snorkeling opportunities. The reef is located just a few yards from the shore and very safe for viewing all those beautiful tropical fish. The rooms are clean and the beds are very comfortable. Although the furniture could use a facelift don't let that discourage you. The rooms are still nice and the lanai, with it's breathtaking views of the ocean and Molokini crater, more than make up for the lack of fancy decor. With sunny skies and warm temps year round who hangs out in their room anyway? The pool area is small but was certainly big enough to accomodate all the guests without feeling cramped. This place has a feeling of Ohana - warm, intimate and local. Thank goodness it is not a mega resort. All the staff (front desk, maids, valets, and shop attendants) were constantly friendly, helpful and always greeted us with smiles and alohas. Foodwise, we really enjoyed the Sunday Brunch with lots of great variety in the seafoods, salads, typical breakfast dishes, rich desserts not to mention the non-stop flowing of champagne. The pool area has a great lunch menu offering a good size portion of food at a decent value by Hawaii standards. Don't miss out on those frosty tropical lava flow drinks from the pool bar. It is sad to know that this place will only become more popular and expensive as the updates to it's appearance are completed. Nonetheless, we plan to return again and again as it is one of the best kept secrets. Thanks Makena staff for sharing your little piece of heaven with us and making our stay memorable. I miss you already!

<Content>To the other reviewers that said this place was run down, we did not have that problem. the hotel is being updated during our stay. the beds were comfortable and the views were perfect. It was always clean in our rooms and in the hotel. we felt like we were the only ones in the hotel with all of the outstanding attention we got for the staff. special thanks to Brian the bellhop, who went above and beyond to make sure all of our needs were fulfilled and Irene, in Events, who planned our events for the days we were there. every one we encountered while we we there made us feel we were the most important. i highly recommend this hotel and i will come back to stay there again.

<Title>“Great Place For a Vacation!”
<Content>We stayed at Makena Resort Oct. 16-24th. We had an incredible stay. The resort grounds are beautiful! The beach is not crowded and so peaceful. The snorkeling boat comes right to their beach, no travel involved. We did the Sunday night Luau. The staff could not have been more gracious and helpful! Does it need updating, yes. They were painting when we were there and are slowly making improvements. I would also suggest some improvement in the resturant situation, very pricey for the quality and availability. We rented a car and you definitely need one. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a peaceful, stressfree vacation. If all goes well for the new owner it should be a 4 star hotel again soon and we can't wait to go back!

<Title>“I'm being kind with two dots/stars...”
<Content>The one and only redeeming quality of the Makena Beach Resort is its location. The southwest coast of Maui is breathtaking and serene. Most of the year the waters are calm due to the prevailing easterly trades, so kayaking and snorkeling in the area are accessible for people of all comfort levels and the lava fields offer some spectacular hiking trails for all skill levels as well. Now for my review of the resort itself, which was impressively bad. I arrived at 9:30 pm on a Friday night and I'm pretty sure there was only one person working in the entire resort. There was a couple checking in before me and I waited while the front desk clerk checked them in, then got their bags, then apparently valet parked their car. 15 minutes later she helped me and was relatively friendly although clearly frazzled. While checking in I was educated about the $25 per day resort charge that was somehow not included in the room rate. I asked if this was an optional charge and was told it was not, that every guest was required to pay the resort fee. If that's the case why not simply add it to the room rate? This was a bad start. I arrived to my room and found it damp with a strong odor of mildew. The room was so humid that everything felt wet, from the carpet to the bed linens to the towels. The room looked as if it had not been updated in decades, as a result I felt like I had walked onto the set of Caddyshack (circa 1980). The wood veneer was peeling off all the furniture, the paint was chipping off the walls and ceiling in the bathroom, and the tv was a 27" CRT. When I went to plug in my phone charger behind the nightstand, there was literally 1/2 inch of dust buildup along the entire back wall behind the bed. The final offense was when I turned on my computer to do some work only to find out the in room internet costs $16 per day. All of this would be okay if I were staying at a Motel 6 in Lubbock, TX for $39 a night, but this is a place that bills itself as a 4 star resort and charges close to $300 a night for their most basic room. Totally unacceptable. I strongly advise avoiding the Makena Beach and Golf Resort, there are much better options to be found close by.

<Title>“Good not Great”
<Content>As I like to start out all my reviews I like to state look at the many reviews I've written. I'm pretty well traveled. I commonly stay anywhere between 2-5 star hotels depending on why I'm traveling. Moving on, this is NOT a 4 star hotel. Anyone who thinks this is higher than a 3 needs to travel more. I firmly believe WHEN the hotel was built around 1986 it was on par with any 5 star on the island, but its very clear that reinvestment within the hotel is not the current focus. The housekeeping does a great job, the room was spotless. As other reviews have mentioned the beds are great. Personally I have a Tempur-Pedic and always look forward to getting home, yet this vacation I didnt. The areas that others have mentioned such as the bathrooms, tile everywhere in the hotel, tvs, the fact that they let people sell things in the lobby, the pool area are were the hotel needs the most help. The overall exterior of the hotel is in desperate need of a paint job, its really sad that they have allowed this once grand hotel to fall into the shape it has. The pool area is very small, but finding a chair is never an issue. One thing I found that REALLY cheapened the hotel is the whole "towel card" thing. I understand that there are guests that steal but come on this isn't cancun, anyone that can afford Maui I think will bypass taking your towels. The others that have talked about the resort fee, I feel its pretty standard in many resort areas yet in most resorts internet is part of it and here is wasn't. We did not do the buffet, as we are not buffet people but we did eat in the restaurant and we found the service to be VERY subpar and we only did it once. We did go to Stella Blues a few times, and it is wonderful. Also you will need a car, that really is a must. Overall I would return but I now know what to expect. It was our first time in Maui and it was by far one of the best vacations we have been on. Cheers!

<Title>“Makena Resort - Perfect Paradise”
<Content>This review is based off our experience as honeymooners in their mid-20's, taking their first big trip as a couple....for our honeymoon we just wanted a nice quiet place to relax, enjoy the beach, and go snorkeling everyday. Service staff that waits on you hand and foot and rooms equiped with the most modern ammenities were not important to us, so please keep this in mind when reading our review.... My husband and I stayed at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort for our honeymoon for one week in mid October 2010 - we booked flight and lodging through Orbitz. When we checked in, we were upgraded to an oceanfront room - and man, was it oceanFRONT! The view was amazing....we went to sleep everynight listening to the waves and saw sea turtles from our balcony. We had a king size bed and it was very comfortable....the whole room was clean and we appreciated the "complimentary" water bottles everyday. (included in $25/day resort fee) We also liked that the resort had a couple computers for you to search the internet for free - their computers don't allow use of flash drives, so you will need to bring your laptop or go to I-Zone in Kihei if you need to download pictures or do work. The resort grounds are beautiful - asian inspired theme and the beach is wonderful. We went in the off season, so we felt like we had the beach to ourselves. We visited some of the resorts in Wailea and even during the off season, they had crowds and screaming kids running everywhere - you won't find any crowds at Makena! It makes for a perfect honeymoon/anniversary get away location. I saw some complaints on here about the small pools and above ground hot tubs....for us it was perfect - during our week long stay there, we were in the pool a total of ONCE and in the hot tubs every evening...never had to share them with anyone!! The restaurants at Makena...as are at every resort in Maui....expensive ($25/person for breakfast) so we had fun exploring the local places for meals. Homemade Cafe in Kihei has delicious Hawaiin donuts ( malasadas ) and Kihei Cafe has great omlettes and pancakes. Some of the other mornings we just ate pop tarts and granola bars from the Safeway. (side note) If you are going to splurge for dinner one night, though, we highly reccommend the Humuhumunukunukuapua'a at the Grand Wailea - super dining experience!! We also liked the Kihei Mall bars and grills - especially the Tiki Lounge. Ka'anapali/Whaler's Village has some great restaurants too. The Makena Resort's golf clubhouse at the top of the hill has a great menu and beautiful view - it's little pricey, but better than the resort restaurants and we were fine splitting one entree. The Molokini Bar and Grill has a good salad that we split and we had fun playing pool while we waited for our food. The staff at the Makena resort are all very nice and courteous - we always felt our questions were answered and we were given good advice for activities in the area. Makena has a catamaran that takes people on snorkeling excursions to Molokini and Turtle Town, as well as sunset cruises. After some research, we found out that Molokini really isn't worth your money for snorkeling, so we booked a trip out of Lahaina to Lanai - totally worth it. (see my other post under Hawaii Ocean Rafting-Lahaina). The whole Makena/Wailea stretch is considered Turtle Town and you see tour boats off the shore all the time...it was great having such wonderful snorkeling spots close by! Although we didn't go on the Makena catamaran, it was still neat to see it go out every morning and I'm sure the sunset cruise is a nice experience. We went to the Makena Luau and paid $40/person for the show only and cocktails tickets. If you are going to see the Luau, we recommend doing it this way - you also get desserts. The show was interesting/ok (just not our thing), so we were happy to not have paid the full price of $110?/person for the dinner and show. Oh, and if you go - buy a lei from the lady making leis - she sells them for $10 - other vendors on the island sell them for $12...not that big of a difference but just a tip! Overall, we LOVED our stay at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort and can't wait to go back. It met all of our needs and we couldn't have asked for a better honeymoon experience. So, if you don't mind staying at a quiet hotel with a gorgeous beach, great views from every room, and great snorkeling, then please consider the Makena Beach and Golf Resort. We loved it and hope you will too!!! :)

<Title>“Amazing, beautiful location, on the beach!”
<Content>We stayed here for our wedding and honeymoon. What an amazing place! From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed and made very comfortable. Our reservations had been accidently cancelled, by a third party travel agent. The reservations desk staff, were very helpful and explained in detail what had happened. She also upgraded our room and we got a better price, than what we had originally booked. The room was exceptional! Very clean, nicely decorated and a great patio, with a view of the ocean. We woke up each morning, opened the patio door, and listened to the ocean. The beds and pillows were the most comfortable in any hotel room, I've ever stayed. Every time we left our room, we were greeted by the nice staff, the grounds people and the front desk staff. Everyone was so friendly and always asked if there was anything we needed or anything they could do for us, to make our stay better. After staying a few nights we were suppose to transfer to a condo in Kihei. We ended up adding another night and gave up our condo. My husband and I have already talked about going back to the Makena beach Resort for our 1st anniversary.

<Title>“Inexpensive room rate, on a beautiful beach, HORRIBLE Housekeeping, not a true 4 star...”
<Content>We stayed there 8 nights. I would not stay here again. The view and the valet attendants were the only good things about this hotel. We had an ocean front room and it was beautiful with a large Lani. As you walk out the front door to the room we had a beautiful mountain view. Front desk clerks were very slow, unconcerned and not friendly. Housekeeping was the worse I've ever experienced. I showered with my shoes on and slept in more clothes than normal... not kidding. It's an older hotel which I don't mind but I still expected clean. Old shouldn't = DIRTY!!! Amazing view of a beautiful beach but I would have rather paid 1k more for a better hotel. We were very active and stayed out of the room as much as possible. Eat away from the hotel for better food and prices. I almost forgot it literally rained in the hotel and they had several trash cans sitting out to catch the rain. Not new leaks from looking at the ceiling. Stay at this hotel at your own risk! Another good point Maui was gorgeous and we drove around the entire Island.

<Title>“What a let-down”
<Content>My wife and I were advised by our travel agent and be other reviews on Trip Advisor to stay at this resort. Upon arrival, the grounds looked average and the facility lacked that "resort" look. The staff was VERY NICE! We were upgraded to the full ocean view room, which they advised us was their nicest room level. Upon walking into the room, I was immediately bummed. The room was no better than a Hampton Inn or Holiday Inn. Neither of those hotels are bad, but when you are expecting a resort, and are paying resort prices, you expect fantastic. I travel literally every week for work, so I have a good feeling for what to expect out of hotels, this one was a huge let down. When I went to take a shower, the cold water faucet didn't work. My wife was afraid to walk around the hotel room barefoot. The main atrium had bushes that were overgrown (not a big deal, but indicitive of the dramatic lack of pride at this "resort"). I was told the hotel has been bought out by a very high class resort operator, however, it is obvious that updates have yet to be made. The pools were far from resort quality. They were two simple round pools with no frills at all. Aside from the friendly staff, the beach was beautiful! This resort is the closest and only (I think) with direct access to Makena Beach. All of this being said, I was so offended by this hotel, that within an hour of my arrival, we had arranged a refund of our remaining nights at the hotel and were booking the remainder of our trip at the Marriott Wailea (unbelievable resort that was very similar price to Makena Beach, definitely should look into the Marriott if interested in that part of Maui).

<Title>“Friendly staff and remote location is a plus”
<Content>My wife an I traveled to Maui for the first time and stayed at this property based on a co-worker recommendation. We watched carefully as the news of the foreclosure came out, concerned we may not have a place to stay when we arrived. Not only are they still operating with full amenities as advertised, but the staff is very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the location that is away from the hustle and bustle that is Maui (compared to Kauai). The beach in front of the hotel is excellent and Big Beach is a short walk (or drive) if you want something different. There were plenty of activities close by to keep us occupied. We also took advantage of the day spa. Frankly, we kept asking ourselves why people are complaining ... maybe to keep the resort a secret! If the property is renovated, we just hope it's not in Septembers when we want to return.

<Title>“Quiet, Friendly, Beautiful, Relaxing....”
<Content>We stayed here Sept 10-15th with another couple and loved it. It's very secluded with a private beach that is beautiful. The Molokini Crater is visible from the beach and the snorkle, scuba, snuba trips leave straight from the hotel. The staff is very friendly and the grounds are beautiful. It's not the Ritz in terms of luxury but it's also not priced as the Ritz. The birds are very loud at night and early morning, however, we asked for a fan and they provided one. The fan drowned out the birds so all was good. Beds were SUPER comfy and pool food was very good. Room service is VERY expensive as is the bkfst buffet. I reccommend getting drinks and snacks from the Safeway down the street and stocking your room. We will definitely be back to this resort... only complaint would be the cleaning crew. Our rooms were pretty clean but could use a deep clean. There was a dead cricket in the room behind the chair that stayed with us through our entire stay. The cleaning crew also left black hairs on the floor after cleaning the bathroom. Overall.... we truly enjoyed this hotel!

<Title>“Secluded hotel”
<Content>I almost didn't want to write this review in order to keep the hotel as secluded as it is... but I decided I should share my experience. My wife and I came here back in 2008 and again in 2010 and the hotel has provided consistently good service. The bathrooms are a bit dated, but everything is kept very clean. Almost all if not all rooms have a nice large balcony with a partial/full ocean view. The rooms are also quite generous. The location is in a very quiet area in south Maui, last hotel on the road, maybe a 5-10min. drive to the shops in Wailea where you can find a mall with shops and restaurants. We enjoyed the quiet location, and we especially enjoyed the awesome beach where the snorkeling cannot be beat. I paid a $25/day resort fee which included a daily supply of 2 bottles of water in your mini fridge, self-parking, and internet access on 2 computers in the lobby (useful for checking in to flights). Back in 2008 (hotel under different management) I didn't pay for any of these amenities, but I suppose $25 is reasonable when you look at what you are charged and what you get at other resorts.

<Title>“More Maui less concrete total relaxation”
<Content>Have stayed at the Maui Prince / Makena Beach resort every year for eight years, this resort offers the stay at a reasonable rate, the best string of beaches are nearby, hiking is close by and sunset are wonderful. Pool is small and adds to its character of an excellent place to relax and enjoy Maui. The landscaping is Hawaiian with a Japanese accent on balance, beautiful open air arrival overlooks an interior floral rain forest type layout with running stream and paths to walk and learn the local plants. Rooms are where you sleep and bathe and are not a place to spend a vacation in, the beds are big and comfortable, baths are huge, relaxing and comfortable. The staff here has never been unappreciative to us at any time, I actually know them by site and they remember us each year. They have always made me feel like if I needed they would take into their own homes. As for the restaurants while adequate the main restaurant seems over pretentious to the rest of the resort but the meals have always pleased. I am not a huge eater and see food as a way to keep going more than something to celebrate so my observations of restaurants are sighted toward value and not ambiance. For the grounds and activity offerings there is more than enough to keep a person happy, a quiet pool, walking sidewalks, excellent places to run with our traffic, no noise to speak of, real neighborhoods surround the resort and you feel part of them. This is not the place to if you want water slides, babysitters, multiple dining options and late night entertainment, I love its quietness, remoteness and warm Aloha feel. If you want to be entertained on vacation stay at the mega resorts that are designed for that, this one is designed to be enjoyed and relaxed in. Mahalo and we will return again in September to I hope is my family staff.

<Title>“Beautiful grounds and resort, staff don't go out of their way to be welcoming.”
<Content>This resort had very beautiful landscaping, a marvelous uncrowded beach, and all rooms have ocean views (incredible value). We loved the location past Wailea; it avoids the Kaanapali feel of "tall building after tall building" lining the beach. These are the positives. The negatives are: some staff are unfriendly. I can't say anyone went out of their way to make me feel welcomed or appreciated. Rooms are aging (but who spends much time in the room anyway. No microwaves a bummer). #1 complaint: If you check in with a debit card instead of a credit card, they require a $75/day deposit for incidentals. For a 10 day vacation this is $750. This has the effect of FORCING you to eat your meals there (very expensive) as it ties up a good portion of your food budget. Just bad policy... Most hotels accept Visa/MC debit cards as a security deposit. Overall: The resort grounds, the beach and the location are so very beautiful,that it overcomes any negatives. Will stay again (when they change there daily deposit policies). Oh, yeah; beds VERY comfy. This is rare :)

<Title>“Three star hotel at three star prices”
<Content>Resort needs lots of work to be a four star resort -- chipped, stained exterior, pealing wall paper, cracked tiles, furniture is worn, old, faded, stained. Jacuzzi is a small "hot tub" above ground, holds 3 - 4 people. There are two of them. The rates are cheap to compensate - just don't expect a four star resort. Staff is friendly and the hotel has some of the best snorkeling on the island. You should be a strong swimmer if you plan to swim out to see the turtles -- they are a little ways off shore. Tour boats come in to snorkel right outside the resort to see the turtles. If you're a good swimmer, you can easily do this yourself. We stayed in a two room suite. At first they put us in a very shabby room on the third floor. We asked for an upgrade and received the top floor (5th) which had a better view. The room looked nothing like the pictures we saw online!!!

<Title>“Fantastic location and hotel - an oasis of tranquillity”
<Content>Our arrival was greeted with shell leis which set the tone for the fantastic service offered here. Ron at the front-desk was particularly friendly and attentive. The beach was the best one we saw in the area with lots of space and fun waves (not scary) and other options just up and down the road. We were always provided with a change of beach towels (sometimes with a little wait) and free water. The room was spacious and clean with a beautiful view and the hotel itself was clean and tasteful although the structure was a little dated. The central courtyard was home to hundreds of birds who all returned at sunset! An oasis of tranquillity only a short drive away from restaurants and shops.

<Title>“The Oceanfront Spa is Absolutely Wonderful”
<Content>My husband and I had the pleasure of having a 80 min couples Lomi Lomi at the oceanfront spa here at the hotel ( we were not guests of the hotel but came expressly for the spa treatment) and we could not have been more impressed and pleased. The location by the beach with the ocean breezes and sounds of the ocean was divine and the views stunning. Our therapists were wonderful - my husband had Barbara and I had Mele, and she gave me one of the best massages I have ever had. We booked the treatment at 5:30pm and when it was over at 6:50pm the sun was setting. I will always remember this beautiful experience.

<Title>“AWESOME!”
<Content>This resort is one of the most beautiful properties I have ever seen. It is well kept and absolutely gorgeous!! Very quite and relaxing atmosphere with the birds churping in the atrium garden. They provide lounge chairs and towels for the beach. The room was clean and the bed was so comfortable it was like sleeping on air. We even managed to see a Sea Turtle which was swimming at the waters edge. We found out later that we are not far from Turtle Cove. It is very close to the Big Beach if you want to try other beaches however, we found the beach at the resort one of the nicest ones in Maui. The hotel staff was very friendly and made it a point to remember your name when you would pick up your car from the FREE valet they offer their guests. The general parking is very close if you choose to use that. We will definately be staying here again!!

<Title>“Good beachfront location, nice views from rooms, housekeeping needs work”
<Content>Lukewarm staff, sketchy housekeeping, worn beach towels (if you can get them, as they tend to run out). Got charged $5 "room service delivery fee" to borrow some plates/silverware for use in the room â€“ something we have never encountered elsewhere. Rooms are worn and carpet is dirty. Found other people's hair in room upon arrival and housekeeping appears to do minimal in the rooms during our stay. Also had problem with people in adjacent rooms smoking on their lanai â€“ prohibited by hotel but nothing you can do because the rooms do not face each other and you have no idea which room it is coming from. However, very, very quiet hotel and great for couples wanting to get away. Great access to beach and free beach chairs are fairly plentiful, especially in the afternoon. Parking was very easy. Recommend this hotel if you can get it for good price and can overlook their shortcomings (mostly the oldness and cost cutting). Found several mistakes on our bill at check out so please review before you sign.

<Content>This hotel was perfect for us. We loved the secluded area. There was a sea turtle swimming right in front of the hotel the first few days.It was far enough away from the crowds to have a great time at the beach and pools, yet close enough to the other places for restaurants and shopping.The staff was great. They gave us a CD, a cooler to use, beach mats, and maps when we drove the road to Hana.They always asked us if we knew how to get where we wanted to go and offered many helpful tips. The rooms were a bit dated, but who goes to Maui to spend time in the room? The view from the room was beautiful.The beds were super comfy! We did not eat at the restaurants, however, we did get delicious sandwiches and drinks by the pool.

<Content>This is my wife and my 3rd trip to this hotel (formerly known as Maui Prince) and we had a great time! The hotel staff was great...they upgraded us to an Ocean View room and even though the decor is on the old side...it is very comfortable. The Sunday brunch was excellent (our only meal at the hotel) and the surrounding restaurants in Wilea and Kihei are great. We also did the new horseback riding on the hotel property in up country and had a private ride (just my wife and I) with the guide. Otherwise, fantastic trip and we will be back again soon!

<Title>“Loved the location, but the hotel needs some work”
<Content>First off, this is NOT a 4-Star hotel, but neither is the price. We loved that the hotel was secluded and the beach was quiet, the hotel being half empty did not hurt either. The exterior does needs work, the pool is just a small circle, the two whirlpools are cheapy above ground models, and the rooms need new furniture, paint\wall paper, and a redone bathroom. The hotel employees seem to think the the new owners will be renovating it soon. But on the other hand the grounds are very well maintained, the staff is friendly (though all of Maui seemed to be well maintained and the people friendly), plus the Koi pond is really nice. I was annoyed by the mandatory $25 resort fee which basically got you 2 small bottles of purified water (which Enterprise was giving out for free while you wait for your car), 4 cards for towels, and self parking which seemed to be free anyway. You still had to pay for beach umbrellas, use of tennis courts, tennis rackets, etc. The squawking birds in the morning did wake me up half the mornings.

<Title>“Don't waste your time or money here.”
<Content>This hotel used to be known as the Maui Prince hotel, but since it was facing foreclosure, the new investors took over and changed the name to the Makena Resort. The only visible investment made in the hotel was the beds/linens. They are very similar to the Hyatt beds and actually quite comfortable. But overall, the resort is less than stellar. Our airline put us here for two free nights due to oversold flights, and we debated paying to move to a better hotel down the street. If you want a "budget" hotel on the beach, then I suppose this hotel would work for you. Keep in mind the word "budget" when you set your expectations. Hotel Rooms: Large and spacious with very tired furnishings (except the beds). The King rooms have a pull out couch. The balconies are furnished with the 80's versions of patio furniture. Visibly - the hotel rooms offer nothing more than a place to rest your head. (Wifi is $15 a day). They do have a mini fridge by the way. Beach: The beach is fine. There are lounge chairs you can use to lay out with. There is no beach service for food or drinks. I recommend buying drinks and a cooler to bring with you. This hotel provides towels through a "towel card program". Restaurant: They have one of the worst buffet breakfasts I have ever tried. La Quinta and Hyatt Place hotels provide a better quality breakfast free of charge. Makena charges $25 per person for the buffet (and the a' la carte menu is $16-$20 each). Their big item for breakfast was "make your own waffles" in those machines kids use in college. Do yourself a favor and take the free shuttle to the Fairmont Hotel, Grand Wailea, or our favorite The Four Seasons for mind blowing food and service (each of those breakfasts are $30-$35 per person and completeley worth it). FOOD AND BEVERAGE at the Makena resort is a HUGE letdown. We ended up taking the free shuttle to Subway for breakfast down at the Shops at Wailea. Overall, I would NEVER recommend this hotel, because I know that for $50-$100 more a night you can upgrade to a much better quality hotel which would greatly impact your travel experience. Do your research and check around. I can't imagine coming to all the way to Hawaii to stay in this dump.

<Title>“Surpassed all of my expectations!”
<Content>The Makena was amazing! The staff was incredible, esp. Thomas, who parked our car for us often during the week. The breakfast at the Kiowai Cafe was great, and although they did away w/the buffet, the menu items were great. I do NOT recommend the Zen-Zen restaurant. It was very overpriced and the selection was not good. The room was wonderful and had an amazing view of the ocean. The bed was super comfy. The room could've used some redecorating, but we didn't spend that much time there anyway. The beach was awesome - the water is so clear! The attendants at the beach were so nice and accomodating. The pools were nice. I heard some people say that they were small, but there was a 4 ft pool and a 6 ft pool, plus 2 hot tubs. The Luau was worth every dime we spent - this is a must-do! Another thing you should do is go to WalMart and stock up on snacks for your room if you'd like. They supply you w/2 bottles of water each day and ours did pile up thru the week, which was nice. Another thing to do is buy the ROAD TO HANA CD and take the drive - gorgoeus!!!!! It does take several hours, so plan ahead. The Makena was secluded from the other resorts, which was nice. It was great and the trip of a lifetime. They made sure we had a great time and I hope others will enjoy their vacation there, as well. Another thing, my husband played golf at the Makena Golf Club and was not too impressed.

<Content>This resort is removed from the hustle and bustle of Wailea and Kihei, but close enough for meals, shopping etc. It is located on a beautiful beach with amenities, and daily visits from sea turtles! While the hotel is slightly dated, it is still lovely, built around an outdoor atrium so that each guest room opens to trees, birds and fountains. Our stay was made more special by Ron at the front desk, Margaret at the pool and Keoni at the beach.

<Content>I live on Maui and have been going to Maui Prince, now Makena Beach Resort for over 10 years. I am very happy that it is now under new ownership and on it's way back up in status. My recent visit was awesome. They have a new spa, Makena Kai, right on the beach! Massages on the ocean, with breezes blowing and waves crashing, it was amazing. I highly recommend the spa, the food and the location. Can't be beat! Hopefully, once they get their new funding, the rooms will all be redone, but for now, it's perfect for the price.

<Title>“Pleasantly surprised!”
<Content>After reading several negative reviews about Makena Beach and Golf Resort on TripAdvisor.com, we were worried about our 2 night reservations at the end of our 9 night stay in Kaanapali, Maui. We decided to take a peek at the Makena Resort and booked a horseback riding tour at Makena Ranch, which is owned by the Makena Beach and Golf Resort. Following the horseback ride, which was great fun with Rocky as the tour guide, we decided to check out the hotel. After the reviews, we were expecting to see a Motel 6 quality facility. NOTHING COULD BE FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH! Yes...the facility could use some updating, such as exterior building painting and flat screen TV's. However...those are minor issues, compared to a gorgeous private beach, an attentive and gracious staff, the tropical central garden/koi pond area, the very nice rooms with fabulous views with spacious balconies, the incredibly comfortable beds and pillows, and the beautiful serene gardens with that great secluded Makena feel. We wish we could have stayed longer and are already looking forward to going back. Some of the people who made our stay memorable were: Denise Hoopai, Front Operations Manager, who graciously gave us fourth floor ocean view rooms; Rocky, horseback riding tour guide/paniolo, who made our horseback riding tour great fun; Alan the bellman/driver who was a walking history book of the area; and Thomas the bellman who, as he puts it "comes to work every day with a smile on my face" and put a smile on ours. The only negative comment we have about the resort was the $25/day resort fee which we were not expecting after the fees we had already paid to Priceline.com. This fee, although a somewhat minor detail, did not even include free wireless internet access, which is a must in 2010. Internet access is available, but for an added fee. In addition, someone had complained about the bird noise...we found it charming. The first night, at about 5 am, we heard very loud bird noises coming from the front door of our room. We were able to go back to sleep using ear plugs. The next evening, we heard the same sounds around sunset and saw numerous birds camped out on the railings in front of the rooms. We had fun chasing them off with the assistance of some nearby children and the next night,we did not hear any more noises from the birds. We highly recommend the Makena Beach and Golf Resort, but since we only stayed there two nights we did not get a chance to take advantage of the spectacular golf course, beach side massages, and hotel dining that were closed the nights we were there. We must recommend Serentos in Kihei for Happy Hour/Dinner (best Calamari we have ever had-we ate there both nights!!) and The Kihei Cafe for a fabulous and reasonably priced breakfast (great pancakes and omelettes, also ate there both mornings!!).

<Content>We stayed at the Makena Beach and Golf resort for three nights and had a very pleasant stay. There are some aspects of the hotel that are quite dated, signage for instance, but the rooms are clean and comfortable and the lanais are very big and private. The staff is friendly and attentive, the beach is gorgeous and great for swimming (free beach chairs!), and it's a great value for the money. We enjoyed the activities the resort had to offer. My boyfriend played the Makena course and declared it better than Ka'anapali. We also took the express snorkel tour and sunset cruise offered by the charter company based at the resort. We highly recommend them!

<Title>“nice view front and back”
<Content>Thanks to the shape of its building, every room in this hotel has an ocean view. Our balcony had a wonderful view of Molokini. On the other side, we had a mountain view plus a beautiful tree. I actually like the fact that the hotel was far away from other resorts, so that the beach in front of it was not that crowded.

<Title>“Great resort relativly small quiet location really beautiful”
<Content>I agree with the other reviews, the beds are amazing and i am spoiled. Ulalena is worth every dollar loved it! Whale cruise with Pacific Whale foundation was awesome. Maui aquarium is really nice. There are lots of coupons in the free magazines if you do some homework and plan ahead you can save a lot of money on dining. Aloha Mixed Plates is worth the drive. Get an ocean view room it is worth it, you can see the ocean conditions from your porch and the Luau! You don't have to move your car for snorkeling it is steps from your room, do it early before the wind starts picking up. Stella Blues in Kiehi has great food, they have coupons for meals in the magazines, the breakfast is really good. Loved Market Fresh Bistro in Makawao! Paia Fish Market and shopping in Paia hippy town. Don't forget the Lavender Farm and Botanical Gardens. So much to do...

<Title>“Making Maui Memories at Makena”
<Content>First, to qualify this review, let me say that my husband and I have stayed at the "Pink Palace" in Waikiki, the Mauna Lani on the Big Island (twice), and the Bora Bora Nui & Intercontinental (Papeete) in French Polynesia. We live in an ocean resort on the Atlantic (Maryland), so we are no newcomers to beach/resort hotels (at the high end). As frequent travelers, we rely pretty heavily on the reviews posted here in our decision making. I am barely able to post this review, because I fear, that if word gets out about this hotel, no one will ever be able to get a room here again. So, here goes: If you want a pretty secluded and safe beach, it's here (remember-all beaches are public in HI); if you want a very affordable, decent rate for an ocean-front no frills hotel, it's here; if you want the feel of 'old Hawaii' with all of the Aloha and the Wailea location, it's here; great food--not here, good food, yes, but not great; best sunset lounge that's not on the beach, it's here; big-time, over-the-top nightlife, not here, but good Hawaiian entertainment several nites during the week, it's here; friendly staff--Jay, Kai, Michelle, Amy to name a few--nothing is ever a problem; great bed, clean room with plenty of towels, soap, etc, it's here; if you want lots of kiddie amenities, maybe another choice is wiser; if you want quiet, quiet, quiet, a large hotel and grounds where you have space to wander and relax, this is it. If you need glitz and noise, overworked valets, and stroller races in the lobby (yes, I witnessed this on a walk-through at another hotel that has a "four" in its name), then go for all of that at the mouth of Wailea. Makena Beach (formerly the Maui Prince) is a wonderful alternative to the overpriced crowded chaos at the other end of this road. We are only sorry we could not stay longer--8 nites was not long enough at this little spot on Maui. (And yes, do eat at Mama's & Gannon's & Da Kitchen in Lahaina. -- all good, really good.) We're still trying to figure our review on Spago at the "4 . . . Hotel."

<Title>“Best bang for the buck on island...”
<Content>Best bang for the buck on island. Overall, I feel like the hotel is trying to find their niche. Some very nice touches, such as cool towel on check-in, shell lei, etc. Front desk forgot to tell bell desk to send our bags to the room, we had to call and ask. Key cards only programmed for one day, so we had to go back to desk to get new ones. Small, irritatating things, not train wrecks, thank goodness. Rooms vary, so look before you commit, and don't be afraid to ask for a different room. Bernard at Bell desk is a rockstar! If you missed the beach, you missed the point!

<Title>“I love this place!”
<Content>Really...I just loved this place. It is the very last big hotel on Kihei Road and my travel agent tried to get us to stay up closer to the bigger towns but we wanted somewhere that was a little more private and secluded and thats what we got. The property is probably a little older than many of the other hotels down that way but we it was still immaculate and very clean. (I think I heard that it was built in the 80's) We had a room on the top floor and the view and breezes were wonderful. The service was courteous and polite and everyone was very friendly and helpful. The grounds were absolutely gorgeous. The pool was beautiful but the jakuzzi's could have been nicer. There were two jakuzzi's placed on the side of the pool area that were basically the same kind of jakuzzi's that you would have at home. There is a nice Tiki Bar poolside and an Activities hut out by the beach where you can book your whale watching tours or snorkeling trips to Molokai. You can actually see the whales in the water from your room! I don't know about the golf course because we didn't golf but the miniature golf was a blast! They even have croquet! I hope to someday go back to Maui and if we do, we'll definately stay here!

<Title>“Decent resort but don't eat at the on-site restaurant, Molokini Bar and Grille!”
<Content>Hotel was okay. However, the service at the resort restaurant "The Molokini Bar and Grille" is beyond awful. They are apathetic and inattentive. Our arrival went unacknowledged so we seated ourselves, we had to wave down staff for beverages and after 1.5 hours still didn't receive our food. Go anywhere but here!

<Title>“Secluded, serene hotel in paradise with improved service”
<Content>When I first went to Maui over twenty years ago, this hotel was top of the line on the south shore, but its reign has long since been overtaken with bigger, glitzier, newer, more luxurious, (therefore, pricier) hotels in Wailea. It continues to be the only resort in Makena, though a bit worn by the passing years, without, apparently, a major update. It sits alone without anything in sight, except for Molikini in the distance, along a pristine, secluded, quiet stretch of beach. The solid construction has stood the test of time, with beautiful wood accents in public spaces, as well as private rooms. The rooms and bathrooms with dressing area are still roomy by today's standards, but the above ground hot tubs are not hotel caliber, and the tv's are old, though I don't go to Hawaii to watch tv. More modern hotels have made use of ocean views, which unfortunately, this hotel did not when it was constructed. When walking into the lobby, one would never know there is an ocean, as it is not visible at all from the lobby. Also, when eating breakfast at Cafe Kiowai or sitting at the pool, one would not know that this hotel sits on the Pacific Ocean. This may not be an issue to some visitors, but I like to go to Hawaii for the beach and ocean, so I missed not having the scenic ocean views that most of the hotels in Hawaii take advantage of. On the other hand, if you like flora and fauna, then you will be in your glory, because the mature gardens are lovely and beautifully maintained, with a waterfall that is perfect for picture taking. The hotel is constructed in a horseshoe, with all the rooms facing the ocean, so at least you can enjoy the beautiful ocean view from your room. Nothing beats waking up to see the beautiful expanse of the Pacific, or being able to watch the sunset over the ocean from your lanai. I had a great night sleep as the beds are queen size, not doubles, and very comfy. What a difference a year makes in service with the new management company. I was hesitant to return since staying last year when the resort was poorly run by Prince Hotels, but got a great rate of $179/night, so decided to try again, and I'm glad we gave the place a second chance. The new management company has made noticeable improvements. To begin with, the staff was much more welcoming and friendly, and aimed to please. I received a welcoming e-mail and personal phone call a few days before we were set to arrive, and another e-mail after we had returned. The staff exuded the Aloha spirit with friendly smiles and hellos, especially Gail at the front desk, and Jay at the beach hut, who both greeted me by name each day. When I requested something, like feather pillows or extra towels, they were brought to the room immediately. There are new, bright lounge chairs at the heated pool, and the new menu on surfboards at the pool grill presented well. The portions were huge, food tasty, and for a resort, I though reasonably priced. The virgin lava flow drinks at the pool bar are devine, and the bartender (sorry, I forgot your name), will bring them to you so you don't have to get out of the pool. Talk about service! Don't forget your float! Another upside to this hotel is that it does not nickel and dime you like many of the other resorts in Wailea. Valet parking is free, there is an empty refrig in the room with two free bottles of water each day, and there are free newspapers in the lobby. There is also a laundry facility on the first floor if needed. My children enjoyed being able to play shuffle board and ping pong, which are available free of charge at the pool. Good deals can be had all over Wailea, since Maui is coming out of a low occupancy spring. We got great early bird dinner specials at old favorite restaurants Joe's and Buzz's Wharf, which I highly recommend. Cheeseburger in Paradise at the Shops at Wailea even had a $5.99 breakfast special! I also recommend Trilogy excursions to snorkel at Molikini. Kai Kanani leaves for Molikini right from the beach in front of the hotel, but when I went on last year, they ran out of food and pushed alcohol usage. I don't go on a snorkel trip in the morning to drink, and don't want my teens to have to subsidize drinkers since this boat does not discount for their age like the Trilogy does. This is probably the most economical choice of hotels on the south shore that has a swimmable beach. I recommend staying here for a quiet, low-key, relaxing stay the way things used to be on Maui before the construction of high dollar hotels and condos. If you desire something ritzier, Wailea is a better choice, or more hopping than the quiet south shore, then go west to Kaanapali. I will definitely return here if I can get a reasonable rate. Aloha!

<Title>“location location location”
<Content>More specifically, the beach in front of this hotel is the best. Lovely for swimming. It is a very easy entry to go snorkeling along the south side of the bay where there are many fish and also sea turtles. Tour boats call this Turtle Town and bring paying customers here to see them. Best of all, when we were finished, we could immediately go up to our room for a shower and a change of clothes. We also liked being very nearly at the end of the road. It is quiet. Less light therefore better view of the stars. Nearby is another fabulous beach - Big Beach. A short distance further you can drive through lava flow from the last eruption of the volcano and then it really is the end of the paved road. The restaurants here were far too expensive. We drove back north to eat in Kihei. The rooms were nice but no proper ocean views. This would be an issue in whale watching season.

<Title>“Would go back in a heartbeat”
<Content>This was by far one of the best vacations ever. The rooms were nice, comfy bed and pillows. The color and pictures in the room weren't tacky as expected when you visit a tropical location. The only downside to the room was that the bathroom and balcony furniture could use updating. But how much time do you actually spend in the room? Service was outstanding. From the front desk to the beach hut, nothing but smiles, aloha's and friendly conversation. The bar tender at the pool bar, Lucky, was the best. Frank at the Bar and Grill was a close second. Restaurants on site are a bit pricey but the food is good. The breakfast is a rip off. There are nice restaurants, including breakfast about a mile away at the shopping area. Mulligans Irish Pub is a must visit to see Willy K perform. There is a shuttle from the resort that will drop you off and pick you up. You definitely need a rental car if you plan on exploring or finding somewhere else to eat. The beach is beautiful and quiet. There is also a catamaran right off the shore that goes on snorkeling trips and sunset cruises. The pictures on their website do it no justice. The rain forest in the courtyard is beautiful. I could go on forever but I will leave it at that.

<Title>“Great for the Price”
<Content>We chose to stay here for the central location since we planned on snorkeling at Molokini, going to Haleakala and driving to Hana. The Makena Beach is a great value, when you pay for an ocean front room, you get one. We fell asleep listening to the pounding surf every night. The staff is friendly and helpful, the room was large and clean, with a very nice balcony. The beach behind the hotel is beautiful and it is very convenient having the Kai Kanani based right there for the snorkel cruise. It is not luxurious, but who stays in the room anyway. We found it perfect for us, although I did hear some people complain about the hundreds of birds who nest in the interior courtyard at night-with the ocean lulling us, we never heard them. We also had a fabulous ceasar salad-mine with grilled shrimp and my husband's with mahi mahi. It was beautifully presented-made from whole heads of baby romaine. Just what we needed after an 8 hour flight!

<Title>“I would stay here forever”
<Content>This was the favorite hotel stay of my honeymoon. The location is perfect - the last one on the strip of hotels so it is quiet, but still a close drive to Kihei and Wailea. The beach is perfect with a great view of Molokini and two of the islands. There is a boat the leaves from the beach and makes snorkeling trips to Molokini. The weather in this area is generally very dry and sunny. The bar by the pool is good. Perhaps the only complaint would be that it's too quiet. The lounge/restaurant area was completely empty. It seemed everyone went out elsewhere, but at least there is a free shuttle to take you to other restaurants.

<Title>“Definetely not a bad choice”
<Content>We stayed in this hotel In May 2010. It was our wedding trip and I chose it for its position (most of weddings take place in the South) and the fact that it was not in a middle of crowded areas (like Kaanapali or Kihei). I also liked the idea that it is the last hotel in the South's hotel chain. We were a bit scared to find an old old fashioned place, but in the end we are rather satisfied with this choice (believe me, I was more than sorry to spend our second week in Sheraton!). The hotel indeed is a bit outdated and old-fashioned, but the rooms are big and very clean and view even from the partial ocean view rooms is great (we saw the montains, the garded with the pool and the ocean). The terrace is big enough and it is a pleasure to watch the sunset from there! The garden is beautiful and the snorkel is great! Each afternoon you can see 2-5 huge turtles, which come to feed on the rocks just a coupld of meters away from the beach (in the center, you can snorkel with the turtles or just watch their heads popping out from the water every minute :). On the left side of the beach there's a very nice coral, although not so many fish, but the coral is beautiful. Hotel also provides beach chairs and beach is not too crowded (unlike Kaanapali, for example). By the way, you get two beach towels per person in this hotel. Makena/Wailea area is very beatiful, the gardens are wonderful and Aloha spirit is all around you. The food at the beach bar is not bad at all, but I was not the biggegst fan of the staff, they are rather slow and inefficient. Another bar inside the hotel has a nice bar tender and nice views to the ocean, but it's time they clean the windows (oops!), so the view could be nicer. The jappanese restaurant has good food, but too high prices and it is closed on Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays! During our stay the hotel was full with the older generation guests (:DDDD), so sometimes it felt strange to sit in the bar and be surrounded only by pension-age guests, but who cares! The staff is friendly, the only thing I didn't like that at check out they were not able to explain our final bill (we made lots of calls to Europe and sometimes there were diffrent calls with different duration to two different countries and they would cost exactly the same price!!! (e.g. 25.33). The staff was unable and unwilling to investigate why (the only anwer was "I don't know". Generally, we had very nice and relaxing stay in this hotel, I wish I han't chosen to spend the second-half of our hollidays in Sheraton (it was a disaster!)

<Title>“Most underrated hotel in Maui â€” great value too”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel 12 yrs ago when it was the Maui Prince. It's taken some knocks during the economic downturn -- last fall, the owners lost it in foreclosure, and a new management company was installed who's cut staff and services. But it's still my favorite hotel in Hawaii, and I've stayed at some of the best ones --- Grand Wailea, Ritz Kapalua, Four Seasons Kona, etc. Why? To me, the Makena Resort gets me a lot closer to my ideal Hawaiian vacation than the others. That said, it's not for everybody, so here's my criteria: 1) I travel with my wife. We don't have kids. We like quiet and romantic hotels that are not teeming with children. Makena Resort is great for that. 2) I go to Hawaii for isolation and calm, not to be in the midst of hustle & bustle or to sit in traffic. So I love the Makena Resort's location at the south end of Maui. 3) I like simple, clean, comfortable rooms and I don't care about high-end fixtures and amenties. The rooms at the Makena Resort are a little dated -- no, they don't have flat panel TVs. But did I turn on the TV once during the week? No. The beds and bedding are very comfortable, the rooms are super clean, and the views are fantastic. At other hotels, you can easily get stuck with a view of the valet parking lot. Most of the rooms here have ocean views. 4) Admittedly, food options could be better. The sushi restaurant, Zen Zen, is terrific. Unfortunately it's only open Weds-Sat. The breakfast / lunch Cafe Kiowai is only mediocre. But there are good restaurants in Kihei, just up the road. 5) The $15/day resort fee does include free valet parking, but wifi is extra (and expensive). Again, that's a problem if you come to Hawaii to use your laptop, but I don't. 6) Snorkeling is great right off the hotel beach. The hotel is close to Ahihi Bay, a nature preserve and good snorkel spot. The hotel also runs a catamaran that does morning snorkel visits to Molokini which get you there before anyone else. 7) The price is right. We just stayed there a week using a package from Orbitz and it was well under $200 a night. In short, not everyone is going to like the Makena Resort. But for me, it has most of the features I want in a Hawaii hotel and less of the extraneous nonsense that I'd rather not pay for.

<Title>“WOW All we hoped for! --- READ THIS”
<Content>We read these reviews before we left and were worried because we had already booked here. When we arrived we were blown away. Hospitality was superb. Rooms were immaculate and great views!! Food was good. Room Service Concierge Valets Gift Shop Waiters all treated us great. The BEACH is the best part!! Private. Clear clean deserted. We got a scoop that we could swim with the fish and turtles here instead of spending money on a tour boat. Well it took us all of 5 minutes of snorkeling time to see 2 turtles and lots of fish. Pool was warm and great. The property has several characters in the way of cats. They patrol the place and are a pleasure to see on property. I took many pics of our room and the views. My sister stayed at the Marriott but spent most time with us. She will only return to 'The Makena' any time in the future. If you want romantic secluded and safe for kids this is a must stay. We LOVED it. We live in a beach community ourselves so it isn't like we are not accustomed to ocean life. I can't say enough.

<Title>“Great resort”
<Content>We stayed in an ocean front room, the view was super, being able to snorkel in back of the hotel wonderful, can't beat the Sunday brunch, room service especially good, staff could not have been nicer or more helpful, and we thought the gardens beautiful. We got a very good deal for the 7 nights that we were there, around 200 a night. Yes, it was quiet, but we had the pool and jacuzzi to ourselves, and we were often out on road trips. For the money, it was a great value.

<Title>“Very quiet when we were there....”
<Content>Apart from the birds. The building is an open pentagon, with a lush and beautiful garden in the middle. Each evening hundreds of Minor Birds flock to the trees at sundown...hundreds - an incredible noise. Each morning at dawn, they wake up. Do not expect to sleep in. The hotel was only half full. The bar was deserted and we did not eat in. there was a $15 surcharge per night per room for beach, towels, parking, inernet access. Great beach, average pool...we dont play golf but the course looked great, the weather was not brilliant. In fact it was dissappointing so the crater snorkle trips were canceelled twice. Easy walk into Wailee, good shurttle bus from hotel to Wailee to. Staff were excellent and there is a launderette - so you don't have to pack too much!

<Title>“Great Location but has seen better days...”
<Content>Upon arrival you anticipate you are going to enter a hotel similar to the ones down the street such as the Fairmont, Marriot and Four Seasons but not this one. It looked as though they are spending just enough money as to keep it from disintigrating into the sea. It had an old worn look with the white paint being replaced with dark discolorations and wood which hasn't seen a coat of sealer since Noah's Ark. It seemed empty and deserted and reminded me of the hotel from the "Shining" but with a tropical bent. Although put off by the condition of the hotel, the front desk staff were extremely helpful and accomadating. Our room dated back to the 80s in need of some cleaning and updates but was overall comfortable. It does have a nice beach cove you can access and swimming seems to be no problem with a few rocks. Because of the condition of the hotel I would drop the hotel rating down to a 3 star, maybe a tad lower.

<Title>“Wonderful beach location”
<Content>My husband and I went over there for our 20th wedding anniversary. The staff were wonderful very friendly. The hotel it self needs some updating. The pool was small compared to a lot of high end resorts, but the beach made up for all the downfalls of the hotel. The beach was private and very quite. Oh and one other thing. The restaurants were not always open. Not sure what day it was I think a Monday evening my husband and I decided to stay in for the evening and have dinner. Well found out the restaurants close on that evening. So took the shuttle along with another family that was not aware of that and went down the road for dinner. Overall if you want a quite place and a wonderful beach this is the hotel.

<Title>“Overall, pretty happy!”
<Content>My husband n I were here to celebrate our Silver Wedding. We enjoyed the hotel & thought the value for money was pretty good, We had a room with views over the pool/beach/ocean. ( Room 326?) The room itself was quite comfy n clean with enough room. Lanais are a great size. The hotel is sort of Ã³pen plan'and there is a tree which the birds seem to flock to of an evening. * TIP* ask for a room AWAY from the birds. They are pretty loud n start 'talking'early. Luckily we were away from them BUT we were above the breakfast restaurant & to be honest it could get a bit noisy early when they are preparing the plates etc. We slept with the windows shut a lot so as not to wake too early. Reception & bell desk were very helpful & always a cheery exchange when passing.Even our maid knew our name by the second day. Still dont know how she worked out which room we had come out of! The hotel has sold off some land and there is construction at the south end of the beach of a club house & 13 housing lots. No houses yet but the club house is underway. Having said that, we didnt find the noise particularly noticible. The beach is lovely. The pool area could do with a little make over. Concrete floor doesnt look too pretty. However, the poolside bar staff cant do enough for you coming around to see if u need a drink while tanning up :) Breakfast was ok, nice aspect but do take the free hotel shuttle up to Wailea to eat there too, if u dont have a car. Wailea shops/ restaurants are about 50 mins walk each way. Overall the hotel is clean but maybe a little tired in places. They are / were up for auction this month & hopefully with a cash injection this place could be fantastic. We'd like to see the pool area revamped. They are aware of the fact it needs a facelift. We;d like to see the restuarants revamped. We ate at the hotel in the evening once. There isnt a lot on the menus of either of the restaurants. A great bar for the evening. Pool bar is small & closes at 9 pm since its IN the pool area & the pool n spa closes then. They have plenty land they could build new or revamp one restaurant & build a nice deck to sit out on. Since he last shuttle from Wailea is 9 pm? u either have to drive back if u have a car, walk if u can manage that far when a litte tipsy :) or be home early! There is SO much scope for this place. We ate up at Wailea. Happy hour at Cheeseburgers 4-6pm half price cocktails if memory serves. Hubby played golf a couple times. Loved it. The south? course is closed, Im guessing whilst the construction of the new homes is underway. Would I stay again? YES! What time is the flight?? But I would love to see it again in a couple years when they have new investors.

<Title>“Better than expected. Calm. Beautiful.”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here as a belated 13 year anniversary celebration. We had an ocean front room smack dab in the middle of the 5th floor. Loved it. Heard the waves crashing each night. Saw whales and turtles from our balcony! People pay to see stuff like that! I was thrown off by some of the reviews saying that the room was "old and outdated". Guess what, the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. The room is dated a little but who cares, you're in Hawaii!! Service was wonderful. Our first night we stayed in another room around the north end. It was supposed to be ocean front but it seemed more like an ocean view. Wevoiced our concerns to Ron at the front desk and he obliged our request immediately and had us moved to room 532. Pros: - Had to be one of the most quietest, serene beaches of all the south Maui resorts. We visited the Four Seasons and Grand Wailea... those beaches were a zoo. - The bed was one you can sink in to all day long. Got good rest. - Service. We were addressed by name most of the time. The valet kindly referred to me as "bruddah". - Buffet. Though $20 a person, the food was good quality. I loved the fruit crepes and banana macadamia nut pancakes. - Close to Kihei. If you come to Maui you know you need to get a car. Nuff said. It's a short 10 minute drive to Kihei if you want other things to do. This is a non-issue that other reviewers seem to gripe about. It's not that far of a drive. Cons: - My biggest "complaint" is the TV... it's 2010, time to upgrade to a flat screen. The rooms being outdated wasn't much of a concern to me whatsoever. - I agree about the pool. I've been in back yards with grander pool. We never hung out there because the beach is literally 60 seconds away. - The $15 a day resort fee. Really? Why? The internet is not free. Movies are not free. Not sure what that covered. Overall I would highly recommend the Makena Beach & Golf Resort for a quiet getaway that's close enough to town. And to whoever is complaining about the birds in the courtyard, relax, it's nature and they only chatter twice a day.

<Title>“Solid 4-Star Experience”
<Content>We stayed in an Ocean Front Room with views of Molokini and North Maui. It's a spectacular spot. The hotel itself is a little out of date, but it's extremely clean and the finishes are high quality. The hotel is very quiet and intimate compared to the larger, more family-oriented resorts out there. We liked the room, with the empty fridge, amazing bed, and screened entry door alternative. There were plenty of activities, including tennis, etc... All activities were reasonably priced. The food onsite is okay, but I recommend renting a car to visit all the dining options across Maui. The beach is small, relatively calm and private. Pool/spa is nothing to write home about - recommend that the hotel invest in an "adults-only" pool, since the resort seems to cater to honeymooners and couples, not families. Main Complaint - the "Makena Cloud"... Be warned, that this area of the island is known for overcast afternoons. If you want a hot, sunny beach, this is not it. We had two of our six days with clear, sunny days. The other four were sunny mornings and late afternoons, but it was cloudy between 12 - 4. The Makena is close to everything, and we found ourselves spending the mornings on the beach or at the pool, and then driving to another part of the island for the afternoon. It was an enjoyable trip, and service/accomodations were wonderful for the price.

<Title>“If the Adams family ran a resort for the witness protection program,”
<Content>If the Adams family ran a resort for the witness protection program, then it would be this hotel. This throw-back to the 1970s could be a world class resort and I mean one of the most amazing if it were completely gutted and redone. Why do I say this? The physical location is wonderful - a perfect cresent beach with nice gentle surf. However, aside from friendly-enough valet folks, the rest was like the Adams family house - probably nice in the day, but unfortunately the day was well before I was born. The pool is circular - completely wasted if you want to do laps and it is about the size of a bathtub. The walls - are white...ok, they were white, but now look like the shade of Bob Geldoff's teeth. And what is up with the makeshift mall when you first walk in - au curant with the other hotels int he area, the Makenna allows local "artisans" to sell stuff in the lobby. I use the word "artisan" loosely, as if you think you can get nice jewelery at the Piercing Pagoda in a mall, then you can find fine craftmanship in the lobby. So, on the good side, like I said, the beach seems really nice. The hotel is out of the way of everything, but if you have a car, not a problem - out of the way means ten minutes from anything. The golf course is about as good as any poorly kept executive course, so if you are going for th egolf, but Tiger Woods on Nintendo and stay at home. Overall, the resort feels is a bit down-on-your-luck. They could try to weed a few beds here and there - they have amazing fully grown specimen trees and such, but totally ruined with weeds and such. It could be great, but it needs Disney, Trump, or someone with bucks and vision to take it from where it is, to where it needs to be. Too many other options that are nicer and cheaper.

<Title>“Makena Beach Club Has it All”
<Content>I stayed here from 3/8/10-3/15/10 & enjoyed every minute! The staff was welcoming and very helpful-always available if I had a question or request. I picked this hotel because it combined a tranquil setting (even a tropical forest in the center courtyard) with *lots* of active diversions-particularly great snorkeling. Boats come from all over the island for the reefs that are located right a few feet off the beach to see "Turtle Town" as well as numerous fish. A catamaran moored just offshore offers variety of sailing packages (sunset cruise, whale-watch,etc) from Dawn to Dusk. My room was spacious and I could here the surf each night; no need for AC with the ocean breeze! Plenty of good restaurants offer varieties of cuisine in a casual setting. The hotel drew from every age group-and everybody was happy to be there-including me!

<Title>“Makena Beach and Golf Resort was a wonderful surprise .”
<Content>The hotel was much more than we expected. We go to Hawaii quite often and have stayed in Wailea, but never in Makena. The staff was extremely gracious, and we were greeted by name each morning as we passed the front desk. When we checked in,i made specific requests for the room I wanted and they were granted. the room was spacious, with a large balcony and a great view of the ocean and the sunset. The furnishings were simple but comfortable. The beach is located in an area where the waters are calm but with some wave action. Thegolf course was in wonderful shape and we enjoyed playing there. The Jacuzzi needs to be upgraded, but the overall experience was terrific.

<Title>“Very happy I gave it a try...will be back.”
<Content>We go to Hawaii every year, sometimes twice a year. This was among the the top hotels we've stayed at in this price range. Pleasant staff with no exceptions. Clean rooms. Great views (although there was an adjacent property being cleared outside our window by a guy with a wood chipper-he was not a problem for us). Good area for runners and especially for snorkelers willing to drive 3-4 minutes to Ahihi-Kinau Natural Area Reserve. Don't let the butt-in-ski tell you you can't wear your gloves while snorkeling. I checked with the ranger and the statement seemed to confuse him. He told me what common sense dictates in the ocean - don't touch anything. The hotel was busy but it still gave off a casual vibe. I like the second locking plantation-style inner door, allowing you to crate a cross-breeze but still keep the room locked up. I also liked the totally segregated bathroom, allowing me a place to get ready early in the morning allowing my girlfriend to sleep while I banged around at 4:30 or 5 a.m. Too often the vanity/mirror is part of the bedroom; not here. Exceptional staff included the coffee shop and the pool folks. Everyone else as wonderful.

<Title>“Nice Location, Great Value”
<Content>We spent one week in this hotel in mid-February. We booked it because it has good reviews and it was much cheaper than most hotels around or close to Wailea. We decided to stay in the area of Wailea and Makena is less crowded than Lahaina and Kaanapali and is closer for going to the volcano and Hana. The hotel is farther away from Wailea, where there are a couple of nice beaches and places to eat, but it is cheaper than staying in an similar hotel in Wailea. It is a nice hotel and has a nice quiet beach with great snorkeling, highly recommended for families with kids. There is one cafeteria and 2 restaurants in the hotel, which are expensive. So, the main constraint of being farther away is that you need to drive to increase your food options. In our case that was not a big constraint because we wanted to drive to Hana and the Halekeala National Park. So, we would have rented a car anyway. An additional good thing about the hotel is that it doesn't charge you for parking. Our room was large, with partial view of the ocean. It is true that the hotel is a little but outdated, but the room was comfortable. The bathroom has a bathtub and a separate shower, which is good when you have kids. The beds were too soft to my taste, I like hard beds, but we all slept well. There is also a small fridge, which we regularly use to store milk, juices and some fruits for breakfast. My last comments is that even though there are 2 PCs with free internet in the lobby, it would be nice if the hotel includes free internet in the rooms. Overall it is a great quality and location for the price.

<Title>“Dated room and bathroom... nice beach... far from everything else.”
<Content>Makena Resort is the farthest hotel on the Wailea-Makena strip... The hotel is very isolated and you definitely need a car to get around. The hotel is far from everywhere (i.e., food, towns, shopping, visiting sites) . The room is not bad, but it is very dated with 80s furnitures and the shower is impossible to use. There is a $15/day mandatory resort fee. The beach is nice. The room wasn't cheap either.. we asked for a room with the ocean view and we got a room with lawn view. Next time, I think we will stay somewhere else closer to towns and newer hotels.

<Title>“Great place, great staff, great location!!!!”
<Content>I was a bit iffy at first as I had heard this place was recently in receivership; however, those fears were unfounded. The staff was first rate, the facility was good, the grounds were great. The place actually looked like the pictures I had seen, which we all know is pretty rare. I do not recommend the food at this place -- overpriced and pretty nasty to be honest. The drive to the shops at Wailea or to Kehei is worth it besides it is only a 5 min drive. The beach was great and this place is just down the road from Big Beach which was great. Were were there for the so called tsunami and the staff was informative and calm. Overall I will visit this resort again. I recommend ANYWHERE in the Wailea-Makena area there or the Napali coast (Kapalua).

<Title>“tranquil, beautiful, real hawaii”
<Content>We stayed three nights at the Makena Beach and Golf Resort in Makena on Maui. This hotel used to be called The Maui Prince but has changed hands. It's a beautiful property with a superb beach. The staff is helpful and real and warm and knowledgeable. You feel genuinely welcomed at this hotel. A lot more laid back than some of the (fancy) Wailea hotels. Makena is a terrific place to stay. They have a shuttle that can take you to the golf course (my husband loved the golf), hotels in Wailea, the shopping center in Wailea. They have a wonderful catamaran that leaves right from the beach for a morning snorkel trip to Molokini or an afternoon whale watching trip. The hotel is also known for their Sunday Brunch -- fabulous. We also had a memorable meal at the Japanese restaurant, Zen Zen. We look forward to going back.

<Title>“Fantastic service and good value”
<Content>We had a great one-week stay here. The staff was exceptionally friendly. The beds were comfortable. The room was large and clean with a lovely view of the gardens and ocean. There were many options for activities, although we mostly just snorkled and laid on the beach. Their delicious breakfast buffet is $20 but very much worth it, especially when considering how much it costs to buy groceries! The pool is small and unremarkable, but who needs it when the ocean is only steps away. The courtyard is the nightly resting place for hundreds of myna birds and home to a heron and a dozen or two koi fish. We hope to return soon.

<Title>“Good hotel”
<Content>A good hotel. Nice beach. Reasonable (but small) pool. Breakfast buffet was great; service at pool for lunch was also very good. Only one restaurant for dinner and menu is limited and pricey. We rented a car when we arrived in Maui and drove into Kehei or Wailea every evening for dinner. You really need a car if you are going to stay here as it is a bit off the beaten path (about 2 miles past the Fairmont in Wailea). We strongly recommend the Deluxe Molokini snorkeling tour that is sold downstairs in this hotel. On the day we went, we had some great snorkeling, saw lots of humpback whales, had dolphins swim with the boat, and snorkeled with sea turtles. Also put up the sail and sailed for an hour. A great experience.

<Title>“Great Value”
<Content>I recently mad a return trip to Maui, with my husband. We had already booked a condo, but ended up adding 2 extra nights that were not available at the condo. We had been to what they used to call the "Maui Prince" before and loved the location. I use Price line a lot and took a chance at a rate of $140 for a "resort" in Wailea/Makena. They accepted our rate and I immediately called the resort to request a "high floor." I explained that we were returning guests, celebrating our anniversary. We had a lovely ocean view room on the top (5th) floor. It was overlooking the pool. I noticed that they no longer had a luau on the grounds. The hotel is not new, but the staff is lovely, the inner courtyard is a beautiful Japanese style garden that does have some noisy birds for an hour every morning. The rooms could use a little face lift. But, at $140/night, you can not beat the location. We arrived the day after Thanksgiving and found the resort to feel a bit empty...fine by me. I did notice that there is a boat that goes out directly out front and gets to Molokini in about 15-20 minutes. The beach was lovely. We did not eat there, but us us minutes from many great restaurants.

<Title>“An EXCELLENT VALUE in Hawaii. A solid 4-star choice!”
<Content>As a solid 4-star hotel, the Makena is an excellent choice. We were a little nervous when we paid $149/night at the last minute on Priceline (trying to avoid Northeast snow storm.) Didn't know what we were going to get. Were we pleasantly surprised! Rooms very clean and well appointed. Excellent, quiet location. Minutes from Shops at Wailea and good restaurants. Nice beach. Small pool. Nice restaurant. Good, but small, fitness center. Recommendations: (1) Replace tile in lobby and rooms. While clean and in excellent shape, the small tiles look a bit dated. (2) Lose the Clairol mirrors in bathrooms as others suggest. Look dated. (3) Expand pool area. Time will tell if current owners have the money or inclination to do so.

<Title>“Needs a little TLC”
<Content>We stayed here over New Years. We had been here about 5 years ago and loved the location.......it is away from all the hustle and bustle on a great beach. The rooms were tired then and although they have been updated, the hotel still looks a little tired. It had recently been sold from the Prince company and we were told by someone at one of the restaurants that it was going to be sold again. The people there are wonderful and very helpful. The hotel itself needs a little TLC. There was a bag of recyclable bottles left near our elevator for 3 days before anyone took it away and it was obvious that it should not be there. It needs a paint job outside and it needs a bigger pool. They had added a nice shaded outdoor cafe by the pool since we were there last and that was nice to have. It is close to the Wailea shops and restaurants so the location is great. It could be a great hotel with a little more attention given to it. It still did not have flat screen TVs, and although that is not why you go to Hawaii, the first rate hotels have them . We also didn't have robes in our rooms and I am pretty sure we did last time. Not big things in themselves, but still not in a first rate hotel class. The price was right, and the location great but next time we will try another hotel.

<Title>“This place is an under-rated gem--please don't tell anyone!!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed for six night in December '09 and January '10. It was only after booking that I saw some of the negative reviews on TripAdvisor and I was nervous. I need not have worried. The resort was beautiful. It was much bigger than I had expected.The buffet breakfast was lovely. The grounds and the beach were beautiful. Staff was terrific. The fitness room was not luxurious but perfectly adequate. There was a coin-operated washer and dryer, which was very handy. The gift store was large and had newspapers, souvenirs, clothing, snacks and wine. We had an oceanfront room. The view from the lanai was spectacular. The room had everything we needed. (I laughed at all of the previous references to the Clairol make-up mirrors but I must agree that ditching them would be a good move. They are dated.) The people at the activities desk were very helpful and provided a wealth of useful information rather than just selling tours (although we did buy tours through them and had no regrets.) The beach at the Makena was amazing and there is an unforgettable snorkelling and whale watching catamaran tour available on-site, operated by an extremely likeable and caring crew. Coral, fish, turtles and whales abound. We attended the luau and although we were prepared for it to be hokey we thoroughly enjoyed it. The bar was open and the food was really good. The musicians were talented and the fire dance should not be missed. The golf course is a two-minute walk away and has amazing views of the ocean. There are several interesting beaches a short walk away. We recommend the Irish band at the pub called Mulligan's at one of the Wailea golf courses just a few minutes away by car. The only knock on the resort is probably the pool which is small compared to the pools at the more lavish resorts in nearby Wailea. But the beach is just a few steps away and is beautiful and unspoiled. After our time at the Wailea we spent two days at the Fairmont in Wailea. There is no doubt that the Fairmont is much newer and more luxurious and with more amenities. The Fairmont was lovely but our oceanfront suite there cost considerably more than our room at the Makena and although both places were wonderful in their own way we will return to the Makena when we go back to Maui. Which I hope will be very, very soon.

<Title>“Still open...for now...”
<Content>I just returned from what I believe was my 5th stay at the Makena Beach (formerly Maui Prince) Hotel. I was a bit alarmed when making reservations; there was little word the Prince group was dropping the property and I had to make sure I was reserving at the place I had intended. The hotel is "in receivership"...no immediate plans to close, but no new owners announcing their intentions yet. My stay was pretty much as in the past...great beach location away from the crowds and noise, comfortable if slightly shopworn rooms, pleasant staff who always remember me. There are signs of cost-cutting: room service ends at 9:00, the restaurants are also operating on shorter hours, public areas are looking even more shabby than usual. Yet, I hope the new owners don't change much. Yes, it would be nice to get things spruced up, but I don't want it to become another Four Seasons-type resort for the super-rich. It's nice to have a "shabby elegant", lower-priced option in that part of Maui, and I really hope it stays that way.

<Title>“Excellent Resort for Value in Maui”
<Content>We stayed 3 days beginning Dec 31st and booked thru hotwire and directly with the hotel with last minute addition of our daughters. We found the location quiet, away from the higher end of Wailea and the hotel is older but our rooms were large and very clean. The beds extremely comfortable and the overall service excellent. We arrived New Years Eve and had tried to get into 5* restaurants in other hotels but they were all booked so we decided we would dine in the resort. Both my husband and I felt the New Years Eve chef's menu was one of the best meals we have had and we travel alot. For $52/pp we had a 3 course menu with wine pairings and the food was amazing especially the main course Beef Tenderloin. We are from Alberta Canada and know our beef and felt this was one of the best cuts. We didn't dine any other time so no comment on daily fare but the New Years Eve was special. I would recommend this hotel and would return.

<Title>“Old Hotel, Good Value”
<Content>We booked our stay through Priceline and got a good deal. That being said, we were a bit nervous staying at this hotel after reading the negative reviews about the hotel's age, cleanliness, and bug problems. In our experience, these concerns turned out to be exaggerated. The hotel definitely shows its age, and is shabby around the edges (there are no nice touches of a 4-star hotel). The room is huge, and is very, very clean. However, the TV is small, and the couch is old, and has an old/musty smell. We did see a big cockroach, which probably sneaked into the room from the garden outside. Our lanai was great with an ocean view and average size. The bathroom is old but clean and spacious. It has both a stand-up shower, and a tub, and a separate room for the toilet. Both the shower and the toilet again had the musty smell. The hotel location is great! The beach right behind the hotel is big with soft sand, and has mild waves. The only drawback is that Makena is isolated. It's a couple of miles away from the Wailea shops, and a couple more miles from Kihei. Without a car, you would be stuck with expensive hotel foods! The pool area is very nice but small. So overall, we enjoyed our stay, and appreciated the very friendly hotel staff. When we come back to Maui, we'd probably look around for another hotel in Kihei/Wailea that's a bit newer and closer to restaurants/shops. But Makena Beach and Gold Resort would be a great alternative!

<Content>Really beautiful hotel with neat Japanese motif. There is a huge coi pond in the middle of the lobby. The rooms have a beautiful Maui view and are spacious and comfortable. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The hotel is right on the beach from which you can go snorkeling. The restaurants are ok; for fine dining go to Spago in the Four Seasons. The restaurants were responsive to my wife's gluten allergy. The pool area is nice, but I wish they would keep it open after sunset. Downsides: the hotel is near snorkeling by not close to the Hana Highway or crater national park. If you book a tour through the Pleasure Activities desk, double check their work because the agent wrote down the right day of week but wrong date. Luckily there was still room on the snorkel trip.

<Title>“Wonderful Experience !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
<Content>Having read numerous reviews(many negative) about the Makena Beach and Golf Resort ( formally the Maui Prince Makena) I must say we were concerned about what we would find when we arrived after our long journey from Cape Cod. We also learned that the property was in receivership.Having said that - we couldn't have been more delighted. The outside entry to the Hotel itself is very elegant but is starting to show signs of its age (early eighties) and could use a coat of paint etc. and our rooms although spotless could use some updating(cosmetic mainly). The interior lobby overlooking the beautiful court yard with it's waterfalls,coy ponds and plantings are spectacular and exquistly maintained. The main restaurant was good but could have had a little more variety for our palet. However--that is about the "only" negatives I have to say about this resort. The huge 1,800 acre exterior grounds and plantings were absolutley breathtaking and gave us a warm "aloha" welcome sight to behold @ every sunrise and sunset of our 11 day stay. The entire staff was excellent and the service was impeccable . Whether we were at the pool or any where else on the property they all made our stay there that much more pleasant and we truely felt more like extended family than guests. The private sandy beach was also gorgeous and never once had more than 15-20 guests on it . The breakfast buffet for $20 pp is terrific!!!!! Never did make it to the Japanese Restaurant. We met many very nice guests who all had high praises as well. One guest we met was an advisor for a travel magazine. He told us that he had stayed at every resort and hotel in Maui and that the Makena Resort was more 5 star than 4 and without question the best value for your buck anywhere on the entire Island. We whole heartedly agree. Our entire time there was truly a relaxing "magical- tropical" experience. Do's- The cat boat cocktail cruise was great and you can catch it right there @ the hotel beach. Shop for your food,snacks and libations for the room or day trips@ Safe-Way supermarket in Kehei. Its much less expensive. Rent a car and see the sights--it's truly a magnificat and beautiful island. Try the "Cafe OLE' restaurant in Kehei. It has the best Sushi anywere and also serves excellent Island grown beef and pasta meals @ very reasonable prices. The buffet breakfast at the hotel garden was fabulous. Take the tour of the Tedeschi Winery on the mountain rd. to Haleakla Crater-Great day trip. I went Scuba diving for the first time ever with Pat @ the hotel beach. --Great instructor , great guy, GREAT EXPERENCE!!! Go to the ocean aquarium whether you have little ones or not. Check out the lava fields just past the hotel along with the beaches @ Makena State Park. The beaches there are the best on the entire Island. We found that just asking the staff where to go and what to do was a great way to find things out. They were wonderful. Don't-- Take the "Road to Hana" drive if you are afraid of heights and many tight twisting turns. Other wise it is a must see all day trip.Don't stay here if you looking for "hype or night life. This is a very peaceful and tranquil setting.

<Title>“Great Value - Beautiful Location”
<Content>We just returned from 3 nights at this facility. We were concerned after reading other reviews and comments. I travel extensively for business and so have stayed in numerous facilities. Is this a five star luxury facility? The answer is no, but neither are their prices. The room was clean, although furnishings are easily 20 years old. Does that matter if they are clean and work? I don't think so. The pool, entry, and public areas are beautifully maintained. The beach was clean, wide and had plenty of room to walk, talk and enjoy the views, or just sit and relax. The staff was excellent, very friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to answer all questions and make recommendations. Would I stay again, yes, without a doubt. One caveat, if you are into the crowds and party atmosphere of the NW part of the island, then this isn't the place for you, since it is quiet, relaxing, and very low key here.

<Title>“Beautiful vacation spot”
<Content>My wife and I planned a vacation in West Maui December 5-12, 2009 and we decided to take two days and go to South Maui and stay at the Makena Beach & Golf Resort. I wasn't completely familiar with the ownership change, but read reviews regarding the property. We stayed in an oceanfront suite and were very, very pleased with the staff, accommodations and practically everything about the resort. The room was very clean and spacious. The lanai was very large and the view breathtaking. The beach is great for snorkeling and it is a very quiet area except when the birds fly into the garden in the middle of the property every afternoon. They leave in the morning but are very loud. The pool is small and the hot tubs are a little old. We ate poolside one day and at the Japanese restaurant one night. The food was very good at both. We played golf one day and the course is very challenging. The greens need some work and one of the nines which was the ocean side nine was closed unfortunately. All in all I would highly recommend Makena. I know that the property was just taken over in September so there will need to be a little upgrading but I would stay there again and again.

<Title>“Gorgeous location in Makena!”
<Content>My husband and I rented a room here for 2 nights...The night before our wedding and our wedding night. At check in the night before the wedding, they upgraded us to a gorgeous oceanfront room. We had rented a partial oceanview, so we were very happy with this. I was at the hotel alone for the night and it was so relaxing. The bed was honestly one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in! The room was very large and the bathroom was huge! I spent the morning of our wedding day relaxing on the lanai and enjoying the beautiful view. There were 3 of us getting ready for the wedding in the room and there was more than enough room. This was one of the largest hotel rooms I have stayed in. We weren't able to have Sunday brunch since we had a post-wedding brunch at a different location with our wedding guests, but have heard it's fantastic. I look forward to staying here again!

<Title>“The Maui Prince Hotel, no longer princely.”
<Content>The Maui Prince Hotel, no longer princely. On my third visit to the Maui Prentice in November of 2009, I see the most radical transition of all in any of the nonperforming assets in the Prince portfolio. The downgrade from the Aveda bodycare products found in the toilets was a notable first sign of distress. While the replacements are functional, they certainly fail to match the room price. Some things are our relative constant. The quality of the beds for example, these are a static signature of quality that has not changed. They're fluffy and comfortable. The Maui Prince has a problem with vermin. On my first visit I stayed in a very nice suite that contained 1 1/2 bathrooms. While exiting through the fire stairwell, I noticed in an area that was not traveled much by visitors, a lot of rat traps. In this single bathroom suite in my latest visit, the balcony appointed with tropical flowering plumage also contained a black plastic rat trap. The irrigation tube was broken and sprayed water all over the trap. Distracting from the amazing oceanfront view, the reminder of vermin was not the visual cue you should expect at a resort of this reputational caliber. A common theme at this resort is the dysfunctional condition of the in suite refrigerators. Once again, the bottom part of the door was rusty in room 130. Another amenity in need of repair are the residential style pair of hot tubs in the pool area. While functional, they were missing knobs and controls. A moment of humor struck me while I'm misinterpreted a chlorine biscuit for a urinal cake! It was more than the puck shape, it was also the smell of the vulgar disc! Hakone is the in-house restaurant. They were an acceptable choice on the past visits and I made no effort to visit them on this trip. Kehei provides a wonderful amount of food choices from the lowly fast food burger joint to world-class culinary art. The resistance to spending money on resort for food began at the coffee shop. While three dollars for a 16 ounce cup of coffee is all right, the small salads offered for $10 or more expensive than those offered on the aircraft for a full meal upgrade. The booth that offered beach rentals such as snorkel gear and boogie boards was curiously closed on a few occasions at what I consider to be prime rental hours. The gear I rented was of good caliber and in good repair.

<Title>“Location is fantastic, Hotel needs major updating and cleaning”
<Content>The location and property were very nice, the beach was amazing and the view fantastic. The people who worked there were very friendly and polite, but I could not get over the dirty feeling of the room we were in. The bathroom felt like it needed a deep cleaning and the carpets, well lets just say I was uncomfortable taking my shoes off in our room or sitting on the floor, and when you have a toddler that is important. The couch that was in the room was very dirty, both looking and feeling. The baby cockroaches crawling around the room pushed me over the edge. We were scheduled to stay there 9 days but moved after 5, we just couldn't relax. The restaurant was also dirty feeling, and the buffet left a lot to be desired for it's price. I don't know how this hotel gets such high ratings.

<Title>“Chill out on beautiful beach”
<Content>My wife and I originally booked for 6 nights but after 24 hours decided to stay a further 3 days , and never regretted it. We had originally booked while the hotel was still Maui Prince but there were no problems , and the friendly staff were very helpful and efficient. We had Ocean view rooms which were good with really comfortable beds. I agree with the `slightly dated ` previous reviews. So What? â€“ the rooms were clean,well serviced daily, -good showers etc . At home we are used to Hotels up to three hundred years old-- so Makena Beach is modern by those standards.Anyway we were out most of the time. We found the food of a very good standard and dined at the hotel about half our stay. Breakfast Buffet at around $18 might seem a bit high ,but Maui is not cheap and we did breakfast at other places finding most dearer,with less selection. Poolside lunch also good and nicely presented. Dinner ranged from `lite fare` to a limited `Table D`ote` and we all left clean plates. Our Son and his wife dined at the Japanese restaurant and said it was above par,as did most others. To walk on the beach at 0630 in the morning with a light surf and the only others boarding the morning Catamaran was brilliant. The garden and pool staff always gave a cheery greeting. The two seawater pools are elderly but well maintained and about 75 yards over a hill from the beach.Sheltered -so it gets HOT. We agree that all extras ,hires,shop are pricey but having seen other areas in Maui not more so.The Makena Beach Resort is the most Southerly Hotel, but only 5 minutes beyond the main Wailea Hotels, and is certainly more peaceful with probably the best quietest ,beach. Did not do their Luau, as we went to The Old Lahaina which was well worth it. Haleakala was Awesome (Not a word I use) and worth the drive, though we did it mid-day.We were rained out of Hana. So back to watch the sunset in the hotel bar with one of Frank`s Mai Tais , followed by a bite to eat â€“Regards to Celia. Back to the Makena Beach- The Staff were brilliant,the food was very good, The internal gardens (with the noisy birds) were beautiful.the beach was Stunning and we`d go back tomorrow!

<Title>“Not a 4 star. This hotel needs to be reviewed!”
<Content>Do not expect a 4-star hotel when booking. This hotel is on a great property but the hotel lacks upkeep. I have stayed at other 4-star hotels and this hotel does not compare at all. At most this hotel is a 3 star but the location is great. The rooms are old and have not been updated for over 10 years. You will find dirty amenities, old carpets and very old furniture. Not to mention you have small old TV's in the room. When I stayed at the Hyatt on the same trip I had a beautiful room each time with flat screen TV's with HDTV and iPod docks in my room. This hotel is stuck in the 80's.

<Title>“WORTH THE MONEY”
<Content>If you want a hotel that is private this is it !!. Great staff, Great beds, Great beach, Great snorkling. Twenty yards of shore you are swiming with 300 pound turtles and dolphins. The turtles come to this area to get their shells cleaned by the local fish that are all around. Maybe 20-25 minutes from airport. You MUST and I mean MUST go to Mama's Fish House for dinner, about 40 minutes away. Call for reservation, best time 4:30 to 5:30.

<Title>“The Spirit of Aloha Reigns Here!”
<Content>My husband and I decided on a trip to Hawaii to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary. We booked the trip through American Airlines Vacations in January, for travel in September. We chose the â€œ4-Starâ€� vacation package, which included 4 nights at the Maui Prince in Makena, and 3 nights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu. Throughout the time from January to September, I was in contact with various members of the concierge staff at the Maui Prince to plan activities for our stay. They were always so gracious and helpful, and I felt like a valued guest with every communication. Just before our trip, I learned that the Maui Prince was under new management (had become the Makena Resort), and got a little nervous about the reservations, but no worries! Everything was perfect from check-in to check-out. We were greeted with shell leis and refreshing cool towels, as well as a very friendly bell staff and front desk attendant who immediately wished us a happy anniversary and gave us an upgrade to our room at no additional charge. We were booked in a partial ocean view room, but got a beautiful ocean view room instead. It wasnâ€™t the â€œtop of the lineâ€� room, but it was ocean view, and we didnâ€™t have to pay extra! I cannot give enough praise to the staff, as they were all extremely friendly and helpful, and absolutely exuded the spirit of aloha, from the front desk to the pool bar, to the wait staff in the restaurants, and the housekeeping staff. Fabulous service â€“ always with a warm smile! The beach in front of this hotel is extremely beautiful and uncrowded. It is a small beach, but all the more cozy and private. I might add that this resort is on the southwest coast of Maui, not in the Kaâ€™anapli area up north, where it is apparently much more commercial. This resort is about a 30-minute drive from the airport. We were within 10-20 minutes of all the shopping we could ask for, from a Safeway shopping center to the Shops at Wailea, a very upscale shopping complex with stores like Gucci and Tiffanyâ€™s. The restaurants at the resort served absolutely incredible food. Be forewarned, everything in Maui is quite pricey, but if you know that before you go, there wonâ€™t be too many surprises. I just donâ€™t recommend ordering room service at the resort. One of the â€œmust-doâ€™sâ€� on Maui is a drive on the Hana Highway. Start early in the morning, though, because you will want to make several stops, and it will take you at least 4 hours to get to Hana, if there is light traffic. I recommend getting the CD-guided tour at the Shell station near the airport for $20, well worth it. There are some breathtaking views and gorgeous rainforest scenery along the way, and you will definitely want to see the black sand beach. If we had not gotten the CD package, we would have missed it. The Maui Prince/Makena Resort has a luau one night a week, but we were not there on the right night for it, so we went to the Honuaâ€™ula Luau at the Marriott just up the road for our anniversary dinner â€“ it was AWESOME! I highly recommend it, regardless of where you stay. The food and show are worth every penny of the $100+ per person cost. I would just really like for the staff of the Maui Prince/Makena Resort to know that they made our anniversary trip everything we dreamed it would be - the most wonderful, memorable, romantic trip we have ever taken. I just hope we can go back someday. Mahalo nui loa, Maui Prince/Makena Resort!

<Title>“Better than Expected, wow”
<Content>My wife and I were recently married on Maui, and stayed at Makena Beach and golf resort from Oct 5th to Oct 9th. We stayed in an Ocean Front room (picture of view enclosed) and the room was excellent, although it could use a little updating. Hereâ€™s the down-low you need to know: If you have a Hawaii ID, you can save lots of money, itâ€™s the local rate. Buy your drinks at Costco or Safeway, the drinks at the resort are very expensive, I mean 14.00 for a 6-pack of Heineken. Buy your toiletries at the ABC store at the shops in Wailea, the hotelâ€™s sundry shop is again, very expensive. For breakfast, travel over to the shops at Wailea, youâ€™ll see a better variety of food and save money. The hotelâ€™s beach was excellent and not too many people were occupying space. The beach equipment is very expensive to rent i.e 15/hr for a beach umbrella. I wonâ€™t blame them, you have to make money somehow, right? We found inexpensive beach equipment at the ABC store, and snorkel gear for 15/week at Snorkel Bobâ€™s in Kehei. Go, have fun, but beware the food/drinks at the resort are a little pricey. Be sure to take the daily snorkel tour out to Molokini, itâ€™s 48 USD for the express cruise and 114 for the deluxe, which includes a self-serve lunch and bar.

<Title>“Easygoing beach paradise with lots of local charm”
<Content>Formerly known as the Maui Prince (and the hotel had just switched over during our stay, so some of the signage hadn't been updated yet), this simple and elegant hotel has an amazing beach and we enjoyed the best genuinely warm service we have EVER received at any hotel. Makena Beach is perfect...nice sandy beach, great swimming, snorkeling on either side of the beach (I even saw a giant sea turtle just offshore), free beach chairs and towels for hotel guests, and the ability to rent anything else you might need (umbrellas, recreation equipment). You can go up the stairs to the Pool Bar for a drink or lunch or to use the restrooms. We took at few short excursions to other notable beaches in the area (Black Sand Beach, Big Beach), but ended up just returning to Makena Beach since the amenities made it so comfortable. You can also take a snorkeling cruise to Molokini right from the beach, and it only takes 15 min to the crater! The real selling point for the hotel is its unbelievably wonderful staff. Everyone, from the valet attendants to the cleaning staff, always greeted us with a smile and went out of their way to make sure we had a nice time. Almost every morning, our waitress at the on-site restaurant would give us fish food to feed the many beautiful koi that live in the atrium's pond. When one of the valet guys saw that we were getting our car to go to the beach, he got us some straw mats for the sand and a boogie board to borrow. When my son got sunscreen in his eyes at the pool, the Pool Bar waiter took it upon himself to get him a cool water cloth and even found eyedrops for him while the Pool attendant gave him the ultimate medicine: an ice pop. On the beach, the beach attendants would come by with little treats like cool towels or pineapple. Upon leaving, one of the staff members gave my son a necklace and "fish" made out of woven leaves. We had nice conversations with many of the staff and got to learn more about real local life. The list goes on and on... The only thing I will say is that the accommodations, while still perfectly fine, are showing some wear and tear and are certainly nowhere near as glamorous as its Wailea neighbors. But then again, you are not paying Wailea prices! The pools are very simple---no amusement park style slides or chic people-watching here. But we were in Maui primarily for the beach, so this was fine for us. Re: the rooms...on the plus side, the beds are very comfortable, the balconies enclosed for privacy, and the tiled entryway made a nice "mudroom" (or sand room?) before you got to the carpeted part of the room. On the down side, our toilet ran constantly (luckily we couldn't hear it in the bedroom), the fixtures and doors were definitely showing age, and the temperature controls were a bit tempermental. But truly these minor irritations paled in comparison to the overall feeling at the hotel which is elegant, friendly and relaxing. It will be interesting to see if the new management will be upgrading some of the hotel's elements. Not all the restaurants were open, as it looks like the new management is trying to figure some things out. The excellent Japanese restaurant Hakone is only open Wed-Sat and the casual cafe restaurant looks like it will be closed for a while. The breakfast buffet is a pretty decent deal for the area ($20 per adult), and while we were there they had a promotion where kids ate free at any of the property restaurants. While we are not golfers, my co-worker who is a golf maniac says that Makena is his favorite golf course on the island. We were there during the off-season, and so the hotel had pretty low occupancy when we were there. We enjoyed never feeling like the place was too crowded, but I'm not sure if this is representative of the hotel during busy season. As for the $15/day resort fee, this was the first time I've paid a resort fee where I felt I got good value for the money. Valet parking and free daily bottles of water are included, and common facilities were very nicely maintained.

<Title>“Rooms in need of some help, but overall a GREAT experience!!!!”
<Content>I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Makena Resort with one of my friends. We stayed at the resort for 4 days/5 nights from Oct 4th-8th, and it was wonderful!! We have always spent alot of time reviewing hotels in any place that we choose to visit, and so it was a tough decision on where to stay while visiting Maui. We ultimately choose Makena Resort because of a hot deal they had listed on Orbitz, and I am SO glad that we did. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were each greeted with a shell lei and helped over to the front desk to check in. The gal who checked us in was very nice, her name was Michelle I believe, and she helped us out tremendously-you see, even though we prepaid for our entire package, we still had to put up a credit card as part of procedure at the car rental and the hotel, not a big deal until I figured out how much they wanted to hold-$500.00-almost as much as my hotel/car cost me in the first place-well, after my card had already been swiped earlier at the car rental, there was not enough to cover-so Michelle worked some magic and only held the resort fee for us-much appreciation to her-glad I didnt have to dip into my spending money for the trip! Just wanted to point this out in case others have the same problems when checking in-had NO idea it would be so much of a hold, especially when being paid for in advance. After checking in, we settled into our room for a while, and I didnt know quite what to think, I remember seeing pictures of updated rooms on a travel website, and it showed something a tad different than what we received-possibly because of the deal we got-not sure-but let me just say this-the room itself was a very large room, two very nice and comfortable beds with new linens, and it had a HUGE lanai with excellent views of the pool, the luau area, and the ocean-and we were on the first floor-so I can only imagine the views on the upper floors! The pool area seemed a bit small, with one small pool and a small kids pool, and I believe two small hot tubs-didnt matter-never once went to the pool-why the heck would you waste time at a pool when you are that close to the beach???? Now to the real gem in the south Maui area-the beach! Maluaka Beach is the beach fronting the Makena Resort-and let me tell you, I have been to beaches in my old home Southern California, the Mexican Rivieria, the Caribbean, and to my other favorite Makaha beach on the island of Oahu, and not one of those beaches can even compare to Maluaka! Its pretty decent in size, never too crowded, and has the sandiest bottom of any place I have ever seen! There is one side that also offers great snokeling, if you are into snorkeling, I am not-I came for a nice relaxing sandy beach, and I definitely got what I was looking for! I did not eat at any of the restaurants on the property-so I cant judge those-but I did visit the Shops at Wailea-just a short drive north of us, and ate at both Tommy Bahama's and Cheeseburger Island Style-let me just say-Bahama's was a bit pricey, but well worth the money spent-ate there twice as a matter a fact! Cheeseburger Island Style has a huge following among locals and tourist apparently, but I thought it was the nastiest burger I had ever tasted-looked and tasted like the prepacked patties you find in the freezer section at the grocery store-you know-the ones that you try to figure out what kind of meat it REALLY is??? Well, you get my point-my meal at Cheeseburger cost almost the same price as my meal at Tommy Bahama, and I didnt get the food or service that should come with that price-stay away from Cheeseburger!!!! Having said all of that, back to the Makena Resort-check out was seamless, did it from our room before sadly leaving-let me say that this resort and the entire Wailea/Makena area is very quiet and extremely low key, not a whole lot of families staying down here, and it was great-not trying to knock people with kids, I do have a niece and nephew that came with us to Honolulu just before coming to Maui-and they were fairly good, but when you are coming to this area, you are trying to get away from everything about your normal life-including the noise of kids and maybe even some adults who act like children-probably people you work with! My point is, there in not a whole lot of activities for kids-unless you are staying at the mega Grand Wailea with its water slides and mega pools-in this area-so if you are visiting with younger kids who need entertainment, Lahaina and Ka'anapali may be better suited for you. If you are looking for the ultimate relaxtion destination, Makena Resort is for you!

<Title>“Exactly what I thought Maui would be like!”
<Content>i just spent a week at the new Makena Beach & Golf Resort in Makena, Maui and the hotel used to be the old Maui Prince Hotel. With a recent change in management, I wasn't really sure what to expect but was I pleasantly surprised!!! My visit started with an authentic Hawaiian greeting from the front desk team and beautiful shell lei. The views were awesome. Inside, the building surrounds an open air Japanese meditation garden with amazing flowers, foliage, streams and fountains. Outside, treetops, shiny blue water and mountain views. The property also is very private and has the best beach around - totally uncrowded unlike some of the other resort areas on the island. The bed in my room was also the most comfortable I've ever slept in and you could lock your interior louvered door to enjoy the breezes at night. What a nice touch! The Japanese sushi restaurant was spectacular. The other restaurant was ok but I loved the morning coffee at Cappuccino Corner. I can't wait to go back!

<Title>“Management changed, new name, so far away...”
<Content>Know that this hotel is now the "Mekena Beach and Golf Resort" ( http://www.makenaresortmaui.com/ ). The management company changed this week. Service was still what you would expect from a resort, so only the name and purse strings are different. Overall, it could use a few millions dollars in a makeover. The outside needed paint, and there are visible small repairs throughout the grounds. The gardens and gold course were immaculate. The tile floors were in need of a deep scrubbing, and we saw areas where the new company was just beginning to paint . The hotel is far, far away from anything. If you are the type of people that don't rent a car and feel that the shuttle or public transit is the way to go, book another hotel closer to the main drag. The shuttle here is good, but the bus system on Maui is sub par - it only runs once an hour. It's nowhere near as good as Oahu's bus system. The walls of the rooms were thin; you could here the next room's hairdryer, but not necessarily voices. When on the balconies, you can hear your neighbors on their balconies perfectly (which made for hilarious eavesdropping.) The bed was VERY comfortable with high quality sheets and towels. Very happy about that. The plumbing can be heard whenever someone next door or above is taking a shower. And our toilet's plumbing seemed to have come loose in the wall, for it was seriously banging around. Room service is above average and courteous. The grounds, gardens and golf course really do match the pictures you see on the website. The luau looked much better than Germaine's on Oahu - so if you got burned by Germaine's Luau (like so many have) you should have a better experience here. The beach is cozy and since your hotel is miles from anything, you will not have to worry about other hotel's guests crashing your beach. BUT, the beach is too small for the hotel should it ever fill up. Internet is $16 a day, and is pretty slow. Hardly anyone was staying a the hotel when we were there, so i can imagine that this would come to a crawl when the place is busy. Drinks at the pool bar were $7, but heavy-handed. Wait staff was a lot like the service you find on a cruise ship where they remember your name and are over friendly. So if you like that kind of thing.... Would I stay here again? No. So overpriced for what it is. I would get a condo just a mile down the road that has all of these amenities (Internet, Washer and Dryer and more.)

<Title>“Great Place”
<Content>So we were a little nervous what we would find when we got here, after hearing some of the reviews about dated furnishings and the fact it was going into foreclosure. We were pleasently surprised. Although the furnishings were not brand new, they were clean and functional as was the rooms themselves. The ocean view was great with good views of West Maui as well. The staff was friendly and helpful. The Lu'au was quite an event, although it was our first, so nothing to compare it to. The beach was clean never overcrowded, but not dead either. The one downside that has been mentioned before is that it is a longer drive to get anywhere else on the island. But hey if you want to relax this is a great place. The birds are an issue for about 1 hour every night at sunset only. Loud.

<Title>“Very Disappointed”
<Content>Simply stated, I was very disappointed with this hotel. I booked here because I gambled with naming my own price on Priceline. I was skeptical when I viewed the website, but was willing to give it a chance. However, it was not at all the caliber of resort my family desired for our vacation. I also feel we overpaid because it not worth what we paid, even with the low bid. The hotel is quite dated, and the suite which they upgraded to (nice gesture) was uncomfortable because it was consumed with bugs. Not an enjoyable encounter. The hotel was very empy, felt isolated. I enjoy privacy and seclusion during my vacations, but not isolation which was becasue the hotel is large and empty. The hotel grounds are not lush. If you are accustomed to nice, tropical resorts, this place will probably disappoint you. Other reviews commented on other overpriced resorts that are nearby, but I believe you get what you pay for... Some of the others are more expensive, however, the experience is 100x better. During my stay, I learned the hotel is closing (not sure when) due to financial troubles. No surprise, but unfortunate because the staff is VERY pleasant.

<Title>“Your happiness with this place will be linked with how much you paid to stay here”
<Content>Bottom line: if this place is cheaper than other locations in Wailea, book it. It's a nice property. However, if you are trying to decide between two Wailea locations that are similarly-priced, you might want to consider another property. I recently stayed at the Maui Prince for 5 nights (1-6 Sept 2009) because I was attending a conference down the street at the Wailea Marriott. I paid $159/night. At this price, I would say that the stay was nice because the resort feels pretty quiet and the beach is very beautiful. (Note there is also a $15/day + tax resort fee that covers parking and 2 bottles water per day.) However, I would likely not stay here again in the future because the neighboring resorts are a lot nicer. First, let's start with the positives of this place: 1. The staff is very friendly. Everyone--bell staff, front desk personnel, housekeepers, maintenance people--always said hello to me whenever I passed by, and I always felt like they really meant it. That was nice. 2. Despite (supposedly) being near-capacity, the resort always felt empty. I'm not sure why this could be possible, but this place would be ideal for a couple looking for the amenities of a large resort without the usual circus-like feeling that accompanies staying at a large property. 3. The rooms are tastefully decorated, and there are a lot of nice touches throughout: lots of real hangers, comfortable desk & chair, a safe, berber carpet, a separate room for the toilet, and a thermostat that allows the user to chill the room to the lower 60's with the AC. There's even a second door that allows for increased ocean breezes. (You prop the main room door open, and then you shut a second, slatted wood door. This provides some privacy while allowing the ocean breeze to pass through the room.) 4. The beach is beautiful. The hotel provides easy access to the beach out back, and it is a great beach for swimming and snorkeling. We saw several large turtles while snorkeling, and we even saw a beautiful manta ray. (It was the highlight of my trip.) However, there are several reasons why I would not return to this hotel: 1. The birds. If you don't know what a Grey Francolin is, you will be able to identify it's (early morning) call by the time you checkout. Also, every evening hundreds of different birds arrive in the hotel's central courtyard, and they can make quite a racket! 2. The hotel has a strange, has been-like quality to it. The exterior of the building could use a new coat of paint, especially the wood trim. Several of the restaurants appear to be closed, but I wasn't sure if this was seasonal or permanent. (The restaurant by the koi pond did appear to be permanently closed.) I tried to find something to eat at 11.45am on a Tuesday morning, and the pool bar was the only place that was offering any food. This seems a little strange, especially for such a big hotel. 3. While the staff was very friendly, they also seemed to lack a little common sense. Two examples: (1) When I arrived, I was told that my room wasn't ready. When I returned at the posted check-in time, it still wasn't ready. It turned out that the room simply didn't have a bath mat or any hangers, and this is why I wasn't allowed to check in when I initially arrived. The front desk staffer should have allowed me to check in and provided the bath mat and hangers later in the afternoon. (2) When I checked out, there was a $19 charge on my bill that I did not recognize. (It was from the beach rental facility, and I did not rent anything while I was there. The charge was clearly a mistake.) Instead of simply removing the charge, the front desk staffer spent a lot of time calling the rental facility, trying to track down the charge. My sense was that the staffer burned more than $19 in staff resources trying to explain the charge. He should have just removed it without question. 4. There were a lot of little annoyances. The shower head sounded like a dying accordion. Internet access is rather steep at $15/day. They charge an obnoxious rate to use the lobby computers for 15 minutes. The bathroom faucet had a 1 gallon per minute flow limiter on it. (When I consider the amount of water that their golf course consumes, this miserly dribble coming from the bathroom faucet seems asinine.) Finally, the hotel is in foreclosure. (See attached picture.) If you're planning to stay here in September 2009, be sure to call the hotel to confirm that they are still operating.

<Title>“Stay Far Away From This Hotel (Priceline Got Me With This One)”
<Content>Let me start off by saying I never write reviews or complete surveys however my experience at this hotel was so awful I feel it is my duty to inform others about this place. My overall complaint is regarding the grounds only, the people were great, and in a way I feel sorry for them. They know the property is a wreck but they do they beat they can with what they have. Now let's get to the property. It's old, old,old. I mean you can tell this place was a happening spot back in the 70's but fast forward 30 plus years later, that same decor from back in the day just does not work. The room we stayed in was a suit. It also was dated. On top of that it was filled with exotic bugs that I had the pleasure of killing. With a 15 month old in tow, this was not cool. He was confined to the bed. I could not enjoy the Maui breeze becuase my patio was occupied by Gecko's who obviously had reserved that area first. They comment about the birds in the previous review is spot on. It felt like I was in central park. The noise they made was more than anything odd. On top of all that we found out the next day that the property was in foreclosure. Augh mystery solved. Bottom line do nit even think about staying here. If you do stay here and you wonder why it is so quiet, it is probably because you are there by yourself. FYI I am writing this from my iPhone at the Four Seasons which is about a mile down from the Maui Prince. I now feel like I am on a vacation again.

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel”
<Content>We had wonderful time at the Maui Prince. We were able to get a two bedroom two bath suite for less than a regular room at most other hotels. The beach was uncrowed and the staff was fantastic. Kids eat free for breakfast and lunch and the food was great. The room was simple but very clean and comfortable. This hotel is a tremedous value. The pool is small but you will want to spend all your time at the beach. Grounds are very lush and very beautiful. We snorkled off the beach every day, and the sea turtles are 10 feet from the beach. Those that gave this hotel a poor review simply paid too much. For what we paid I would certainly go back. Do your homework, compare it to other resorts and book your stay with confidence, you will have a wonderful time.

<Title>“Treated Like Royalty - Wedding Day at the Luau”
<Content>We didn't stay at the Maui Prince but we enjoyed the luau. We were married at Makena Cove in the late afternoon. I wanted a luau not a stuffy restaurant. There were 4 of us. We had the priority seating - front center table. We loved the show and the personal attention were received as the bride and groom. Not a cheesy show like the one at our hotel. Food was good, mai tai's were just ok. Great fun! Our limo driver dropped us off at the front door. We were offered a ride back to our hotel after the show by the doorman. True to their word, we were taken right to our hotel. Nice gesture!

<Title>“It was just *okay*...”
<Content>The hotel was *okay*... a bit overpriced and I think 4 stars is a stretch. The room was a little "worn" (beat-up doors, plugged bath tub, etc.) to be considered 4 stars. Overall, the resort is *very* overpriced in amenities (food, drink, etc.). Expect to pay $20/person for an average (at best) breakfast buffet. After throwing in a few coffees, you'll be paying $50 for an "okay" meal for a couple (whereas you can get a great breakfast at Kehei Cafe for ~$25 for a couple... just up the road). The restaurant was pretty good for dinner, but again... very overpriced for the quality. You're a bit away from other dining and nightlife, but if you decide to stay here... I'd recommend going to Kehei (~10-15 minute drive) for better choices. On the bright side, the small beach that borders this hotel is great... you're close to Molokini Island (get there before the rest of the boats and nab a great spot for snorkeling)... However, I wouldn't really recommend this resort overall.

<Title>“Best hotel Iâ€™ve stayed at”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Maui Prince for our honeymoon in from July 14 â€“ July 21. The staff was extremely friendly. We were greeted with sea shell necklaces. The parking was free which surprised me, the coffee in our room everyday was free, the safe was free. Although we got there at night and couldnâ€™t see what anything looked like outside, we were already impressed by the hotelâ€™s perks and service. The room was very clean and spacious, especially the bathroom. It had a walk in shower, as well as a bathtub, closed in toilet and very big sink counter and mirror. In the morning we finally got to see our spectacular view from our big balcony. All the rooms in the hotel are either ocean view of partial-ocean view. Some people in previous TripAdvisor entries complained about the birds. The hotel does have a set of trees and plants in the middle of the hotel/lobby which is nice and where I guess the birds flock to, but I personally donâ€™t know what people were complaining about since I didnâ€™t really hear or see a lot of birds on the resort, and if I did so what? Itâ€™s just a reminder that weâ€™re away from the stresses of big cities and closer to nature where we can relax. Whatâ€™s funny is that I actually did find birds annoying on the roads of Maui! Iâ€™m surprised I only killed one the whole week I was there. Happened on the Road to Hana. Oops. The hotel is in Makena, which is a 1 minute drive from Wailea and a 10 minute drive from Kihei. I thought it was nice to be a bit more isolated from the other popular areas but still close enough. There are lots of water activities available including paddle board lessons, rentals, canoes, and a boat that comes pick up snorklers twice a day to the nearby Molokini crater. The cream of the crop is the Maui Prince Luau which is on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I must say that I enjoyed myself far more than the â€œFeast at Leleâ€� in Lahaina. Maui Princeâ€™s Luau was much more interactive, informative, the host was funny and the buffet was delicious. The beach has nice clear water and lots of room on the sand. It also has some lava rock in one section thatâ€™s home to 2 huge sea turtles which could be seen there everyday which was nice. The restaurants and the food was delicious but expensive. Our breakfast cost us $25 each. But Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s the same case in other hotels as well. We simply ate out most of the time.

<Content>We stayed here for our honeymoon just a few weeks ago! It was a great hotel, though we wished that we had a little better map because it is a bit far from the airport. However once we got there we were glad we booked here. Overall everything was as it should be, beautiful and just-plain-easy to like.

<Title>“Best vacation in 20 years!”
<Content>We booked this hotel through an online agency and after reading some of the prior comments I was a bit apprehensive about this place. All I can say is: "This place is fantastic, a true gem." We celebrated 20 years of marriage and were SO GLAD we stayed here. As we arrived we were greeted by the most wonderful staff . The hotel grounds and scenery are wonderful and exceeded our expectations. All staff that we had the pleasure of dealing with was very polite, professional and great. Our room was an oceanfront room and we could see the sunset while sipping on a tropical drink. We awoke in the morning with a phenomenal view drinking our coffee on the large lanai as the seabreezes greeted us. The room was extremely large, clean and very comfortable. Not a problem anywhere to be found. The hotel gardens were so serene and very beautiful. The birds are noisy in the evening but it really didn't bother us at all, in fact we enjoyed it. We had our breakfast included and the staff and food was really great as we sat and overlooked the garden area and reflecting pools with Koi swimming freely. The Molokini bar is a bit pricey but very nice. (All of Hawaii is more expensive than the mainland). We had a great time one night (too good!) and met some wonderful people from CA. that we unfortunately didn't their contact info.. We rented a car (FREE PARKING at the hotel!) and was a short drive to Kehei/ Ma'alaka/LaHaina for dinner, shopping and other activities. The pool is great and uncrowded and very beautiful and well maintained. The beach is quiet (although $25/day for an umbrella is high) but you can also sit under a tree for shade. The snorkeling - WOW! They call Makena "Turtle Town" for a reason, I snorkeled with turtles and saw some of the most beautiful fish ever right off the hotel beach. Very plush towels at the beach/pool area as well as great drinks/food at the bars. The staff at each area was very pleasant, polite and very nice to accomodate your every wish! The area is quiet and if your looking for nightlife - it's not here - it's realaxing without the screaming kids and over boisterous party animals. We went to the Luau - very nice, elegant with great food. Let the snobs stay at the Grand Wailea/Farimont Kea or elsewhere - us "real" people enjoy the peace and quiet. Wonderful staff - we will stay here again. Oh, by the way, I've travelled to Asia over 22 years in the high tech field and this hotel is modeled after the finest hotels in Asia such as the New Otani in Tokyo, and Singapore and many others. Aloha and Mahalo for the great times!

<Title>“Maui Prince Was Wonderful”
<Content>I traveled to Maui to celebrate my daughter's college graduation. I got a great package deal that included air, car and hotel. I chose the Maui Prince because of the great location. Not in the heart of town and great snorkeling nearby. The other catch is that all their rooms have at least a partial ocean view. I had read some not so good reviews mainly about the age of the hotel. Having been to Europe, I can't see a reason why an older building would be a problem unless it is falling apart. Well, I was so happily surprised when I arrived at the hotel. Greeted by the desk clerk with cold towels and a lei I was immediately given an upgrade to a room with more of an ocean view (still not a complete ocean view but more than partial I guess). The room was nice. It had everything I wanted and the beds were really comfortable. I didn't spend much time at the hotel but everyone I spoke with was super friendly and always wanting to make your stay even nicer. I booked the luau for the first night and it was really wonderful. The food was good - not great. The drinks were good and the entertainment was really excellent. I had coffee at the little cafe and a drink at the Molokini Bar and Grille. I enjoyed their breakfast buffet in the Garden restaurant (I don't remember the name of this restaurant). The waiter was great! My french toast was cold so he had the chef cook up some fresh for me. Also the price wasn't overwhelming. I must admit I did not choose to take advantage of much more of their amenities -- didn't bother with the pool -- why should I when there is a gorgeous ocean a few feet away with amazing sea turtles that swam along side of me. On my last day, I wanted to spend the day in West Maui so I asked if they would store my bags. They did so with no problem and no charge. Tip: If you plan on snorkeling, go into Kehei and rent some gear from Snorkel Bob's or Boss Frogs. Maui Prince's gear is way too expensive. The good: Beautiful grounds, birds, turtles and fish all right at your fingertips, friendly and helpful staff. The not so good: they charge 15.00 per day for internet use (they use a third party provider) on top of a 15.00 a day resort fee.

<Title>“Great Location, Comfortable Hotel”
<Content>Stayed at the Maui Prince at the beginning of a week long stay on Maui. We arrived late in the evening, our room was in great shape and ready for a good night of sleep in the beds that we were told had been replaced very recently. Woke up early in the morning to a view of beautifully landscaped grounds, the pool surrounded by cabanas, and most importantly, the ocean. I was a bit concerned before we arrived because I had read some bad reviews, but none of it seemed to be true. Staff was friendly and helpful, room was clean and comfortable, and the pool was small but enjoyable (and a short walk to the ocean). We ate in the restaurants for breakfast twice and dinner once, and all were good, not the best meals I've ever had, but good fresh fruit and sticky rice for breakfast, and lots of options for dinner. We had to wait a while for our dinners to come out because of a large party, which was no big deal since we were sitting watching the sunset, but the restaurant comped us our drinks anyway. The atrium has great landscaping, and does seem to be the home to many birds. They all come in for the night around 6 but I didn't hear them leave in the morning. Hopefully they are keeping the area bug free for people to enjoy. The beach in front of the hotel is great: clean sand, and I hear the snorkeling is good even though we didn't go in this location. There is also a great view of Molokini, and lots of other islands. Fairly private, seems to only be used by hotel guests and a few other local rentals. If you keep driving down the road past the hotel, however, you find even more beautiful beaches, where the lava rocks are in the waves. Maybe not great for swimming and snorkeling, but definately striking, and a great place to watch locals surf.

<Title>“The worst hotel i have ever stayed ..”
<Content>We got to stay in this hotel via priceline.com which somehow rated the hotel as 3.5 star. It was definetely overated in my opinion as the carpet was damp, old building, dusty, rusty wood door, smelly room, hot air conditioner, old elevator and have a garden where every morning thousands of birds are coming there and make so much noise which can be heard from the room.

<Title>“Couldn't ask for more-everything was great!”
<Content>Loved this hotel. I read MANY bad reviews, mostly regarding the staff, but these were completely unfounded. All the staff members I met were cheerful and helpful. The cleaning staff were eager to help (we had a 'do not disturb' sign up for most of the day, and when the cleaning lady saw us come back to our room, she immediately asked if she could clean the room for us). The doorman chatted with us at the cafe and gave us plenty of tips on where to find what we were looking for (souvenirs, coffee, etc). We only ate at the hotel once. We had the breakfast buffet, and it was DELICIOUS! peach-filled crepes with Tahitian vanilla cream sauce and either maple or coconut syrup--WOW! Fresh fruit, traditional eggs/bacon/ham, eggs benedict with salmon, pastries, fresh guava and orange juice...you get the idea. Excellent breakfast buffet. The hotel itself is beautiful (lobby and grounds). All rooms have a balcony facing the beach, and the entrance to each room is off a central courtyard. It's true that between 4-5am there's an insanely loud congregation of birds in the courtyard, but my friends always slept right through this. If you're a light sleeper, they might wake you up, but hey--you're in Maui--get up and enjoy an early morning! The birds all leave for the day around 5am so you can get back to sleep. The hotel beach is beautiful! Soft golden sand on the beach and in the water. Nothing sharp to walk on underwater. There's a rock formation in the water that you can explore with snorkel gear, and there's a large sea turtle that spends its afternoons at the rocks. It's there pretty reliably so you can be sure to see it if you go snorkeling. This was a superb hotel. We had an excellent stay and I wouldn't change a thing if I could.

<Title>“Excellent service is the reason to stay here”
<Content>I highly recommend the Maui Prince for a very special vacation. I am sure you could find more modern and flashy options on Maui. It is the amazing, effortless service here that will remain special for you. One morning, I left the hotel room to go about my Dad and a maid, 5 doors down, said good morning, Mr. Lewis. Very impressive! I also would compliment the amazing view of our hotel room. Full on straight views of the Pacific. One word of caution, light sleepers beware that the grounds of the hotel were built on a bird sanctuary. The birds are amazing and beautiful but also very loud. At about 5 am, every morning, the birds go absolutely nuts. Its a spectactle. We particularly enjoyed Gail at the Front Desk and of course, the maid who remembered my name. Slight downsides are the pool is on the smaller end but the beach above the hotel is top notch.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel grounds and room”
<Content>Our stay at the Maui Prince Hotel was great - the hotel grounds and atrium were really beautiful, and the room was well-kept and clean. It was a little pricey, but if you can get a good deal on Priceline or another site, it may be worth splurging for. The pool was also not so exciting considering it's supposed to be a resort, but since we didn't come to Hawaii for the pool, it met our needs. The best part of the hotel, aside from the beautiful landscaping, was that it never felt crowded. Since it's a little further away from the hotels in Wailea, it had a nice deserted feel, and even though the hotel had a lot of booked rooms, you couldn't tell from walking around the grounds. In terms of location - I was worried that since it was in Makena, that the drive would seem somewhat long, but it was MUCH more convenient than staying in Ka'anapali, and the drive was really not bad. It was great as a starting point each day for seeing the island's sites - Haleakala, Road to Hana, Iao Needle, etc. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again if the price was right.

<Title>“Never stay here for honeymoon or anything fun”
<Content>We arrived at the Maui Prince after two days in Oahu at the Hawaii Prince and two days in Hotel Hana in Maui. It was our honeymoon which we planned several months in advance. We were looking forward to relaxing for 5 nights at the Maui Prince. First off, the bell men were beyond rude. They never welcomed us with leis as we saw others being welcomed. The moquitos run rampant there which we never had any problem with riding all over Maui. The floors and rooms were dirty. Obviously, they don't clean daily. The front desk was also rude. No Aloha spirit in this place which we had gotten accustomed to in other parts of the island. They gave us a pitiful view for our prime ocean view rate. Our shower made a loud banging noise which went from hot to cold to scalding hot while you showered. It also lost most the pressure during use. We asked for a room change or maintenance to fix which they said they did during our dinner. We tried out the hotel restaurant since it' s in the middle of nowhere. The food was mediocre at best with very high prices. The service from wait staff and hostess was also snobby. The other dinner restaurant was closed for renovation til July. We decided to leave the second day but they were going to charge us the early departure fee of one night stay so the manager upgraded us to ocean front room. The view was better, room larger and separate shower but it was old and dirty also. The pool was always hot and there is only one which we were used to several. If you want a nice place to stay, you can get a better rate in Lahaina or Ka-anapali Beach at the Westin, etc with better view and many pools and restaurants. I think people go there to have quiet, but it's not going to happen if that's your reason with the nightly bird convention in lobby and loud shower and faucets. It's falling apart and in need or an upgrade or serious rate adjustments. They charge daily rate for internet and plus additional charge for parking nightly. Rape you every way they can. NOt ideal for honeymoon at all.

<Title>“Quiet Escape”
<Content>My wife and I recently stayed at the Maui Prince for our 25th anniversary. We had stayed there 10 years early and wanted to enjoy that part of Maui again. I have read through comments from other travelers and agree with much of what they say. The actual hotel building is dated and needs a freshening up. The white concrete is rather stark and the original design and material selection could have been more attractive, but to me it is no better or worse than the bright white Kea Lani up the street. But we didn't come to the Maui Prince to focus on the exterior of the building. The interior gardens are very pretty, the grounds very nice and the proximity to one of Maui's best and more secluded beaches can't be beat. The lobby area is open and airy and while there is no view of the beach I rather like the simple elegance that it presents. I feel very comfortable at this hotel without the need to wear my designer clothes and show up in my designer car. I had read from another review that there was a damp and moldy smell in their room. This stay we experienced the same. I believe the carpet had been recently shampooed and had not been allowed to dry out. We spoke to the staff at the front desk and they were very accomodating, moving us to another room which was fine. The staff from the front desk, to concierge, to restaurant to those taking care of our room were always very nice and accomodating. We ate at the restaurant twice and were very pleased with the food. The pool area is rather simple and I am sure doesn't compare with some of the resorts in Wailea. There are no water slides or waterfalls, but I would rather enjoy what Mother Nature created. For us the beach is the draw. Coming from Northern California where stepping into the ocean is always a chilling choice, being able to walk right in is a treat. A couple of turtles even came swimming by me one day. We opted one morning to take the Kai Kanani snorkel trip to Molokini. It leaves right from the beach in front of the Maui Prince. A nice trip and something to do once. The crew were very accomodating and what a treat to get off the boat and right up to your shower. The hotel is indeed at the end of the road, one of it's charms. My idea of a vacation is to get away from everyone. We did do our play time, drove to Lahina a couple of times and the ever present need to see Hana, but the majority of our time was spent enjoying each other's company, lying on the beach, swimming, sipping drinks and trying to forget our busy life at home for awhile. If that is what you are looking for, I recommend the Maui Prince.

<Title>“Maui Prince - dated, but not nice”
<Content>I spent a week at the Maui Prince hotel this month. As I stated in the title, the MP is a nice hotel, but it could definitely use a fresh coat of paint to brighten up the place. The hotel is right on the beach, and is very close to Little Beach and Big Beach (the largest white sand beach) - location wise it's perfect if you don't want to deal with the densely populated Lahaina and Kanapali areas. Hotel staff is courteous and attentive. When I arrived at the hotel, the doorman greeted me with a "Hello", which I thought was strange. The rooms are spacious and modern. Our room had a great ocean side view and overlooked the beautiful homes and condos next door. Each room has a safe and fridge to store valuables and leftovers. Don't expect too much from the hotel or Wailea area for nightlife. The only night spot in the area is Mulligan's, which is a golf course bar/restaurant. They close at midnight. We met some nice Aussies who drank with us, so that was a nice experience. One thing about the hotel that bothered me was the smell from the koi pond area. They have large koi pond that gave off a very strong uncleaned fish tank smell. Very gross since the pond is close to the restaurants.

<Title>“Seriously lacking in charm and the feeling of being in Hawaii.”
<Content>This is a very poorly designed hotel. It is shaped like a giant donut, with an open atrium for the hole. The good part of this is that most rooms will have a good view off the lanai. But the downside is that all the public spaces are extremely institutional in feel and quite lacking in charm. There are zero, I mean absolutely no, "cutouts" in the donut. So standing in the lobby, there is no view of the ocean, or pool, or anything pretty.... just a view of many floors of the doors to all the rooms, in unvarying, unrelieved concentric array. The poor workers at the front desk! All the beauty of Hawaii, and not a shred of it visible! We found ourselves always going down the fire stairs near our room to exit the building ASAP and be outside as the walk through the lobby was so unappealing. (Also the atrium has a lot, in the bad way, of birds flying around.) The pool is also odd -- a relatively small pool, it is a perfect circle (do I detect a theme here?) of 100% deep end -- over 6' deep of water. There are no stairs down into it, only ladders. There is no getting into this pool slowly or halfway. If you like to kind of hang out in a pool without having to tread water or hang off one of the side walls, this is not the pool for you unless you are at least 6'5". The beach is not at all visible from the pool, and is a good walk away from the pool. The layout of the grounds is quite odd... there are 2 huge berms (hills, kinda steep in fact) which hide the view of the beach completely until you walk up to the top of the second hill. We found this also to be such a waste of the beauty of Hawaii. You can either sit at the pool, far from the beach, or sit at the (hot!) beach, far from the pool. There are two lovely grassy areas on the berm nearest the ocean, but they don't want you to put beach chairs there even during the day because they have weddings in the evening. We found this hilarious (chairs can be MOVED, duh!) and ignored it. Even if you do this, you are unlikely to have a view of the ocean from your chairs due to the slope of the berm. We stayed here because we were making a tour of all the islands and wanted to try the Wailea area. This is the sister hotel of the Hapuna Beach Prince Hotel on the big island, a very lovely hotel indeed, where we have stayed often. The Maui Prince has some similarities, especially in the room layout, but it cannot compare with Hapuna. Both hotels have this neat feature of two front room doors -- one solid and one louvered to let in the breeze. So you can sleep with your glass lanai doors open, using the screened lanai doors in their place, and also use the louvered front room door (instead of closing the regular solid front room door) to have a breeze pass through all night, and hear the sound of the ocean (though often you instead hear the sound of the irrigation system). At the Hapuna, the louvered door is completely screened, to keep critters out. In our room at the Maui Prince, our louvered front door had no screens, so we weren't able to take advantage of this rare and really cool feature. The staff was okay, not up to Hapuna Prince standard. When we drove up, no bellman came to meet us or deal with the car at all (he was there, just didn't bother). So we just went right by him up to the desk to check in. We were surprised not to be offered an upgraded room, given our Prince Preferred membership, our many stays at a sister Prince property, and most especially the fact that the hotel was virtually empty. Hapuna has never failed to upgrade us! As for the location, this is a quiet area (it's the last hotel on this end of Maui) and the beach is very nice. If you plan to eat/do stuff in the immediate area, then it's great. If you plan to see a lot of Maui, expect to do a fair bit of driving (though this is also true of Lahaina side). We weren't deterred by the location, but would not stay here again for the reasons discussed above. If you want to stay in Wailea without staying somewhere snooty, this could be a fine hotel for you, especially if you get a nice ocean view room (better be on a high floor given all the stupid berms). If you are looking for a hotel where you will just happen upon many beautiful bits of scenery while walking through the corridors (as is the happy case at beautiful, well-designed Hapuna), go elsewhere. We ate in the restaurant, and made a dinner out of appetizers and dessert. The food was very good and the service was great. As at Hapuna, the wait staff and housekeeping staff is friendlier than the front desk staff. Again we were stuck by the lack of view from the restaurant. I would love to meet the architect who laid out this hotel and ask him/her why such poor use of the land was made. It is just very strange to build a hotel in such a beautiful setting and block all public-space views of what most people come to Hawaii to see.

<Title>“Amazing Trip! Amazing Hotel!”
<Content>After reading a few poor reviews, I thought I needed to step in and give my review. Its strange how reviews go in waves for this hotel, you get a few weeks of all 5 star reviews, and then it seems like a few snobs stay, and it goes to 1 star. We stayed at the Maui Prince from May 9 to 16, 2009. We booked through Travelocity, and traveled from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. As soon as we arrived at Maui Prince, we knew this would be a wonderful hotel. We really enjoyed the 3 minute drive from the Wailea area to the hotel. We were a little shocked, by the short distance that this hotel is from everything, based on prior reviews. It is a phenomenal drive, with the golf courses on one side, and other nice hotels and ocean views on the other. We actually felt the distances from the Maui Prince were quite reasonable, 3 minutes to the Wailea area, about 10 - 15 minutes to Kihei, and less than 45 minutes to Lahaina. We were very impressed as soon we pulled up. The staff were excellent who welcomed us, they were very friendly, and grabbed our bags right away. The check-in was very seamless, and we were given a beautiful prime ocean-view room on the 5th floor. We found the hotel room to be very clean, very nice and comfortable linens, clean bathrooms and a wonderful lanai. The room was fairly basic, and the furniture was a little date, but honestly, who cares? We thought it was excellent, and we hardly spent anytime in the actual room anyways. We really enjoyed the lanai, and are view of the grounds, the golf course, Molokini, and the ocean. It was excellent to go out onto the Lanai at around 5 o'clock, and watch the sunset, and the occasional wedding going on below. We thought the pool area was okay. We spent a lot of time reading around the pool, and had lunch twice. We thought the food was quite good, a little expensive, but that was expected. We really liked the fact that the pool area was not busy, and cabana's were always available. We really like the fact that the cabana's were free, when you could go to another hotel just down the street at hotels where they are often $200 and up. I think if the pool was a lot fancier like you might see at the Grand Wailea, it would be insanely busy. We really enjoyed the quite atmosphere, and just being able to dip into the pool when we got to hot. We loved the beach. We spent every day of our vacation at the beach. We would often get down early, and get a couple lounge chairs from one of the Hotel Beach hands. They were always friendly, and were always helping guests with the paddleboards, lounge chairs, etc. The beach was absolutely beautiful, with incredibly views of Molokini in the distance. The water is amazing, and the weather was always perfect. It often seems like there is some kind of a wall right over the Maui Prince. As you looked back from the beach towards the hills, you would see big black clouds, but right over the Prince it was always sunny and big blue sky. We never got rained on, the only time was a few sprinkles at the golf course, in the hills. We saw more than a dozen turtles, and they were often right up at the reef a few meters from the shoreline. They were quite remarkable to watch, and we loved when they would poke their little heads up. The snorkeling in the coral to the left of the beach was amazing, and a ton of really cool fish to see. We brought our own snorkel sets that we bought back home at Costco, and they were definately well worth it! I had been on the Makena Golf Courses website before the trip, and really wanted to go golfing, but decided against it. When we checked in, we were given a couple for a "No Clubs, No Shoes, No Worries Promotion" for $159USD. We decided to make a tee-time, and check out the course. For $159, we got a round of golf (my wife also came along to caddy for me for $30), brandnew Taylor Made R7 irons and Burner woods, Nike Golf Shoes, and a sleeve of Titleist golf balls. I thought this was a really good deal, and very convenient, for people who are hesitant to bring their golf clubs on vacation. The course was in amazing shape, and we were able to go out just the two of us. Place of play was perfect, and the views of the ocean and Molokini made it all worth it. We definately enjoyed this, and were glad we did this. We loved this hotel, and will definately come back. It is such a shame that it gets such bad reviews from some people. I would often walk through the beautiful lobby, and through the koi ponds, and think to myself, what are people thinking, how can you complain when you are in such a beautiful place. Maybe people have experienced unique situations, but that is no reason to blow it out of proportion. We will be back to the Maui Prince in a heartbeat, and will recommend it to everyone we know. Some of the Restaurants that we visited were as follows, we would recommend them all: -Molokini Lounge (at the Maui Prince Hotel) -Cheeseburger in Paradise (in Wailea and Lahaina) -BJ's Pizzeria (in Lahaina) -David's Shaved Ice Shop in Lahaina (I can't remember the actual name at the moment, but it was really good, I really enjoyed the Halaekala, and my wife always liked something different) -Old Lahaina Luau -Makena Maui Prince Golf Course Clubhouse for Lunch

<Title>“made my maui trip a nightmare !!!!”
<Content>If you check out Maui Prince's website, you will find nice photos of their guest rooms, looking new and clean.. well.. don't be fooled like we did !! We were first checked into a room that had VERY DAMP carpets, and smelled like dirty public bathroom. So we asked for another room, and we got a slightly better room, the carpet was still damp, but not as bad as the other one, and the smell was there too but only in the area outside of the bathroom. I was paranoid to walk around in the room barefoot, paranoid that my feet might get contaminated by fungi !! The bathroom is old, and dusty and the hairdryer plug in didn't work, the sink blocker did not work too. And the Air Conditioning was not cold either. The hotel had a really old vibe.. their lobby is old, big and empty. their pool is small and looks VERY old. The only good thing about them is their beach. Maui prince is a 4-star hotel. It definitely does not represent it very well. We came from a 4-star Marriott at Waikoloa at the Big Island Hawaii, with their rate $100 cheaper, and it was a million times better than Maui Prince. Please don't go there. It made my maui trip a nightmare..

<Title>“Moldy and severely outdated”
<Content>I have no idea why this hotel has such great reviews. If it was billed as a 2 or 3 star, it might be more appropriate. But for a 4 star hotel to have MOLD growing in the bathrooms and carpet to the point that it made my friend sick....completely innapropriate. After spending one night in the hotel (my friend couldn't even sleep in the room, she went to the Marriott), we asked to be moved to a non-infested room. When they couldn't accomodate the request, we decided that it was worth the huge cancellation fee to change hotels. Don't even bother with this place, unless you are craving a respiratory infection.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel, Great Service, Would Recommend!”
<Content>We stayed here for Valentines Day 2009, and we're thrilled by the hotel! It was a little pricier than we normally like to spend, but justified it for our honeymoon. Worth the money, the people there were just great, in-room services were also fantastic. We loved the location on the South Side as opposed to Lahaina (didn't have to drive so much). Overall a great experience!!

<Title>“Gem for the moderate budget traveler who wants to stay in Wailea”
<Content>This moderately priced hotel is right on a beautiful Wailea beach with amazing snorkeling and swimming. The grounds are well maintained and spacious. Beach and pool access is easy and intelligently designed. From what we could see the majority of rooms are at least partial ocean view and each has a nice balcony. Our room was large, comfortable, and recently renovated. It was exceptionally clean. The decor is functional, with a home-like quality. There is a refridgerator and coffee maker in the room, which was nice for keeping cold drinks or having a morning coffee. Each staff member we interacted with was exceptionally helpful and gracious. If you are looking for a place to stay in the high rent district of Wailea to enjoy the spectacular beaches and be close to shopping and restaurants but don't want to spend $500-$1000 a night, this is the place! As a plus, their golf course is well designed and has spectacular views. We will definitely be going back on our next visit to Maui.

<Title>“If I had it to do over again . . . . .”
<Content>I would ABSOLUTELY choose the Maui Prince!! My husband and I stayed there recently for 8 nights to celebrate our anniversary. I got a great deal on Priceline. We were given a very nice oceanview room on the 4th floor with a king sized bed. One day we came back to our room to find a phone message asking us if we would like to upgrade to an oceanfront room! They even sent someone up to help us transfer our belongings. Every night we watched the sunset right in front of us from our lanai. We had no problem with the rooms. Our beds were so comfortable and the pillows and linens were high quality. Both rooms had new drapes and the carpets were clean. So the bathrooms didn't have granite countertops, who cares? The staff was extremely helpful, even offered to check us in at the airport and printed out our boarding passes. We also liked the location, as it was always nice to come back to our quiet, secluded hotel in the evenings after dinner. The restaurant and pool foods are expensive but they have a great little coffee shop that we visited daily and bought fresh cut-up papayas, pineapples, banana bread, wraps, and salads and kept them in our room fridge for breakfasts and lunches on our lanai. The beach is one of the nicest beaches on Maui . You could snorkle right in front of the hotel and we saw turtles everyday. They were so close you could almost touch them. And yes, the resort's pools are not very impressive but for us the pool just isn't that important any way. There is so much to see and do on Maui. The Maui Prince was perfect for us and we can't wait to return.

<Title>“Beautiful Honeymoon Hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here for the first part of our honeymoon last summer. We had a wonderful time! It was quiet and relaxing in a secluded area south of the more touristy Wailea. We loved the privacy, the quiet, and the beauty of the area. The beach is particularly lovely, and we enjoyed snorkling off the rocks to the left of the beach. We saw a ton of sea turtles! This was our favorite snorkling spot in Maui; it was less crowded than other areas, but the selection of fish and turtles was amazing. As far as the hotel is concerned, everything was attractive, well-maintained, and comfortable. We liked all the birds in the central courtyard (though they could be noisy at dusk). The staff was excellent--helpful, friendly, and charming. We arranged a group tour to Hana from a tourism desk in the lobby. They came and picked us up early in the morning (it's worth doing the trip to Hana, but be prepared for some very nerve-wracking turns on the road). Overall, this was our favorite hotel from our two-week honeymoon. We're sad we only stayed five nights; I wish it had been ten!

<Content>What a great place. Other reviews have not been kind enough. The staff was great. Each time I wanted something, they had it right here, right now. Seemed to have plenty of privacy. I am saddened to hear it may not be there much longer. I think if this hotel is older than you are you may not "get it" but we though it was reminiscent of vintage Maui. The only thing missing was Don Ho. Great stay!

Located at least a mile from any other resort. The atmosphere is serene and quiet. The grounds are lovely, the staff is friendly and the beach is beautiful. Every room has an ocean view and lanai.

<Title>“Stunned!”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for 1 night, we were booked for 7 nights. After spending 10 nights at the Mauna Kea, we started the second part of a 2 island holiday. Before booking this hotel we checked Trip Advisor reviews and the Prince hotel website. Both were very positive. On arrival we were shown to a room overlooking the rear loading dock. No upgrades which was surprising considering we had just stayed at the sister resort. This was one of the most depressing,dated, worn hotels I have seen. The place was deserted and had some wierd policies, such as not being credited the $50.00 per day credit unless you used it for their bland meals. After one night we went looking for other accommodations. Assuming the lack of people at the Maui prince was due to the economy. We were very suprised to find most of the other resorts on the wailea booked nearly solid. We ended up staying at the Fairmont Kea Lani at a price that was only about $100.00 more per night. The manager at the Maui Prince gave us a story about the sister resort Mauna Kea stealing all of their profits to finance the upgrades at the Mauna Kea? I heard later that the Maui Price is sold and is going to be torn down. Why prince resorts is continuing to promote this dump is beyond me. We were confused after the Maui Prince was being promoted by some of the staff at Mauna Kea. We were grateful to the concierge at the Kea Lani for salvaging an otherwise horrible experience,

<Content>My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon. It was a great place. Our room was a partial view of the ocean. The first room we were escorted to smelled moldy, and so we had requested another room. The staff was very accommodating towards us. Our second room was great!! The beach was beautiful, hotel was nice, but the restaurants located in the hotel was very expensive. The best part about this hotel was our view of our room and the staff. They were great.

<Title>“Nice hotel in an excellent location, though a bit dated”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for 6 nights while we were in Maui. Located in Makena, which is south of Wailea (where all the nice & posh resorts are), the resort feels a bit secluded from everything else, which to us is a plus. Not sure if it was due to the economy, but we never felt the hotel to be crowded. The beautiful Makena Beach sits right in front of the resort. The open lobby is very airy and light. Rooms, however, are a bit dated, especially the bathrooms. Luckily, everything is pretty clean, so we had complaints. We also got a pretty good deal, so we did not mind as much. The bed was at least pretty comfortable. Pools are also very small, but with such a great beach in front, who needs them? The hotel is also close to Big Beach.

<Title>“Amazing hotel!”
<Content>My husband and I booked our honeymoon through a travel agent that recommended this hotel. We had no idea where to stay so when she told us about her visit a few months prior we decided to go with it. We were so pleased when we arrived. The hotel is absolutely beautiful and in a wonderful location. It's the very last hotel on the south end of the island so its very quiet and peaceful but tucked away in between golf courses so the views are gorgeous. We had an ocean view room which let us view some of the best sunrises and sunsets. The entire center of this hotel is open and looks like a little jungle. There's waterfalls, tons of gorgeous flowers and plants and a great coi pond. It was really stunning. We opted to go out for lunch and dinner but our package came with a breakfast buffet and we wouldn't have chosen any where else to eat breakfast. The Maui Prince has the best breakfast buffet on the island! My husband isn't a big breakfast person but he absolutely loved the omelet center. There were so many different choices of breakfast foods and drinks so it never got old or boring. The pool is a bit small but when you're right in front of the ocean you don't need the pool. We did spend time laying out at the pool just about every day and it was very relaxing. The hotel isn't much of a kids location so we were never bothered by noise or anything else. The staff at this hotel was also amazing!! From the time you walk in till the time you leave the resort you are treated like kings and queens. They are so friendly, accomoding and incredibly helpful. We couldn't have been happier with our choice of hotels and I would highly recommend it to anyone else. Our brother and sister-in-law stayed in Lahaina and said it was a very busy little area so we wanted to make sure we stayed farther south. Wailea is a great location, both high class yet low key. Loved it!!

<Title>“Great experience, as long as you know what to expect”
<Content>I've stayed at the Maui Prince four times. It is very easy to describe and the decision to stay there should be simple, as follows... Pros (what I love about the hotel): 1. Staff are excellent, committed, genuine, friendly, with real spirit of aloha. You will feel warmly welcomed and treated. 2. Location is great. It is away from hustle/bustle of Wailea. It feels a world away. It is quiet, even serene. I love to walk to big Makena beach. There is a special feeling to the location that will make you want to keep coming back. 3. Beach is great. Turtles frequent the beach, snorkeling is good, beach is not busy. 4. Parking is low hassle. Valet is free. Self park lot is close to the front entry, easy walking, and it's also free. 5. Public areas of hotel are really special. The gardens and koi pond are mature and beautiful. Lots of koi, which are fully grown. The local Mina birds also use the central courtyard as their roost, which may wake you up at 6am and accompany your cocktails at 6pm, but you will come to love them! 6. Specific parts of the rooms, namely, double doors allow breezes through, and all rooms have at least some ocean view. The rooms all have two sets of doors. On the inside is a louvered door that can be kept closed and locked, but lets you hear the gardens and lets the breezes through your room. The outer door can be closed when you want the A/C. Views: no rooms overlook the parking lot like they do at other hotels, but some of the partial ocean rooms could be considered "far back." Cons (what I wish the hotel would fix!): 1. Rooms need lots of work. You will find the carpets older and a bit scruffy, the bed linens not very high quality (this may have been remedied in recent replacement of soft goods, but I have not stayed since), the furniture is older and a bit dated in style. The bathrooms are dated, with older tile scheme. The wallpaper may be frayed in places. Housekeeping is very good and very consistent, they do their best, but clean old stuff is still old stuff. So, you will walk in the bathrooms and feel it was nice in 1983 and has gone untouched since then, but is very clean. The rooms do have great closet space, nice bar space above the mini fridge, and balconies are good. 2. Pool is a bit small and unimpressive. It works for lounging, and if you do not like a lot of action around the pool, it will please you. It's a simple oval shape. The spa is above ground and not very impressive, but serves its purpose. You can't see the beach from the pool area, due to protective berm, but it's a 1-minute walk between the pool and beach. The pool service is good, drink service and food, by very friendly servers who will remember you on multiple day visits. Overall, if you want a "lay by the pool" vacation and know what to expect here, you will not be disappointed in the pool. 3. Restaurant situation. The main restaurant is closed for renovations. Other venues are a bit iffy...breakfast only, Japanese, pool service, room service, bar food. The bar actually serves a nice selection and is a good choice for a "stay around hotel" day, if you are not a huge eater. The sunset from the bar, and frequent live entertainment, can't be beat. I hope they will complete the restaurant and reopen it. The staff at the restaurant have been very good on all my visits. In summary, I am quite firm in believing the pros far outweigh the cons. The hotel can fix some things, especially a major room renovation. However, for now, the rates are low, and the hotel's pluses make it a definite must do. As long as you know what to expect here, you will have a memorable time and will not want to leave, and will want to plan your return on the way home! The hotel possesses that indefinable quality that will draw you back.

<Title>“Would definitely stay at the Maui Prince again & again!”
<Content>Wonderful service! All staff was extremely courteous and made our Honeymoon stay personal. They went over and above to make our stay enjoyable. Great location - quiet enough for rest & relaxation but with lots of things to do! My husband had a great time playing golf across the street while I had an awesome facial at the Maui Prince Spa. They use all Aveda products which is hard to find back on the mainland! We ate at each of the hotel's restaurants and enjoyed each one very much. Room service is VERY pricey - $90 for breakfast one day and we got the basics (Tea, eggs, toast & juice). Beach was clean and secluded. Pool was also very nice with cabanas to get out of the sun and nap. We would highly recommend the snorkeling trip that leaves right from the hotel that takes you to Molokini. Worth every penny to swim with green sea turtles and snorkel around the crater. Buy an underwater camera for that trip! We attended a Luau at the hotel but was a bit diappointed. Due to the rain, they had the Luau indoors. Not what we had hoped for. When we go back, we would definitely attend again when the weather permits! Overall great experience at the Maui Prince!

<Title>“Hawaiian gem”
<Content>The atrium is outstanding with a wonderfull full garden, meandering stream and walking path. The entire place is nicely decorated with an almost oriental flair. The staff was very nice - even one woman who was obviously having a bad day made sure to smile and say goodbye. Sunday brunch was excellent. Morning breakfast was very good and view was nice but it did not include the ocean. You overlook a pond and manicured bushes. Our room was spacious and clean. It included a standard desk, an armoire that housed the tv, armchair and footrest, and a king sized bed. The lanai was large and contained a table with 2 chairs. There was a counter near the closet for the coffee maker and it was over the mini fridge. The bathroom had a separate room with door for the toilet. Kinda old school. Bathroom fixtures were older and the tub had a hand held shower (handicap maybe?). We really enjoyed our stay and had a hard time figuring out where the bad reviews were coming from. All we could come up with is that it's probably very picky people! State of the art tech this is not. Clean, comfortable, old hawaii - it is!!

<Content>from the second we got off the plane, we knew we were "there." the smell alone was amazing. the staff made us feel as if we were royalty, even refusing tips. rooms were nice and breakfast on the lanai will forever be etched in our memories. try the portuguese sausage. the luau was a great time, great food, look out for the mai tai's. water was like a luke warm bath, and crystal clear, dont skip the scuba. local food was great, dont be afraid to try anything, its all good! visit the spa and spring for a massage, well worth it. we played the makena south golf course, wow, the views alone are breath taking. the staff there offers superior service.the best honeymoon we could've imagined. we plan to return in the near future, or as near as we can afford. absolute paradise!

<Title>“Wonderful Stay at Maui Prince”
<Content>For months I was concerned about staying at the Maui Prince after bidding on Priceline. Well, I would have to say that I was pleasantly surprised! As we checked in, we were greeted with the moist towels and leis and we also upgraded to an Oceanview room . The room was very nice and housekeeping was really on top of things. The only negative was that it was 3 and 1/2 miles from Wailea Village. I will also say that the food at the Maui Prince was quite expensive. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Large rooms, quiet area, nice lanai”
<Content>I booked the Maui Prince on Priceline, so I was searching for a resort property in the Wailea Makena area so originally hoped to get the Marriott. The Maui Prince was a fine choice for the price. We were there at the end of March and it looked like the place less than half full. We hardly saw any other guests present. The room was nice, it was also clean. We ate at the restaurant and enjoyed the quiet meal and good service. We also had the contiental buffet and it was your standard hotel buffet. If you like pretty tropical birds with your breakfast you will be entertained by them flying nearby. If you can get a good rate and want a nice quiet retreat you would be happy at this hotel.

<Title>“My favorite Hawaii honeymoon hotel room”
<Content>First of all, let me say what I'm comparing this to: the Hyatt Regency in Kaanapali (West Maui) and the Waipouli Outrigger Resort in Kapaa in Kauai. I loved the Maui Prince best because the beds were BY FAR the most comfortable, with the softest, most luxurious linens, and the best, least obstructed view of the ocean AND no way to see in--so we could keep the screens on the windows with no curtains, to be able to see and hear the ocean from bed. I also have to say that this was the cheapest of the rooms we booked--$175/night on priceline, booked about a week and a half before our stay there. As other reviews have mentioned, EVERY room has an ocean view, and the "partial" ocean views here are much better than similarly-described rooms at other hotels. We had two rooms over our stay there, first a standard room with two queen beds and then upgraded to one king bed labeled a "prime" room, and I would agree with other reviews that "prime" appeared to convey no benefit over the standard room. The price difference would not have been worth it for us. The beach is beautiful and, unlike the other hotels we stayed at, there were plentiful beach and pool chairs any time we were there, as well as a very friendly staffperson (Danilo) who helped move chairs around for folks as needed on the beach. It was quick and easy to get down to the pool or the beach from our room, which was not as true other places (meandering paths at the Hyatt actually made it difficult to get from point A to point B, and locked gates made beach access tricky at the Waipouli in Kauai). We had mostly good luck with the Maui Prince staff, as well, including front desk staff that went out of their way to move us to a room with a king bed rather than two queens, even though we had booked on Priceline. We also had a red-eye flight back home on our last day, so we had all day after we had checked out of our room to hang out on the beach. We could get more beach towels from the pool/beach staff, hang out in lounge chairs on the beach, eat at the pool bar, and even use the hospitality suite at the end of the day to shower and do our final pack before the flight. The one downside to the Maui Prince was that it's way down in Makena past the more expensive properties in Wailea that are all attached with a paved ocean walk (like the one in Kaanapali), so you have to drive to get anywhere. It would have been fun to be on that walkway at the Four Seasons, the Fairmont, or the Marriott. But not worth the price. It's also a long way from the Maui Prince to the airport, to the Kaanapali beaches, Mama's Fish House (not to be missed--our best meal by far on the island), or the drive to Hana. The pools are also a little lame--just plain small circles of water. I think the point is tranquility and serenity, but after the fantasy pools of the other resorts we stayed at, it seemed kind of boring to jump in a small round pool at the Maui Prince. I will say that the bathrooms in both the rooms we had were very oddly configured, with doors coming out of weird places and uneven water temperature in the shower. The bathrooms especially show the age of the property, as newer resorts have much better designed and more spa-like bathrooms. If you want to just hang out by the beach or the pool for a few days, with easy access to several gorgeous beaches for swimming, bodysurfing, or snorkeling, while enjoying beautiful ocean views from your comfortable room, Maui Prince is perfect.

<Title>“Full of the Aoha spirit”
<Content>We have stayed at the Maui Prince every year in Feb for our anniversary since 05, this time for two weeks 2/12- 2/26 in a Mauka Suite from which we still had an ocean view I am amazed at some of the negative comments by those who say the most lame things imaginable, look the hotel is not new, but is very well maintained, imagine how many hundreds of people have stayed in these rooms, some wall paper could suffer, and sand dunes are there to stop high seas during storms, the staff at the hotel are simply the best and like any building in such constant use it shows it's age, but has aged well, the gardens, beach and location are most excellent, the food at any of the hotel venues is great but of course pricey, how much time do you really want to spend in your room while you are on Maui anyway?, the houskeeping staff are great also, they really do a great job and should not be overlooked, so if you are not going to be so idiotic as to expect an older hotel to be all "new" inside, this is for you, if you are a persnickity snobby type you will probably complain that you can't see the ocean while you eat your eggs benedict, maybe those people will be glad to know that prince hotels does not own the hotel for close to two years now, the new owners (Everett Dowling / Morgan Stanley) have gained approval and the hotel will eventually be torn down and a new one built in it's place, along with other homes and some other developments, I hope it does not ruin the area, we will stay at the new Makena Resort, but we will always fondly remember the Maui Prince, it is a very special place.

<Title>“True Aloha Spirit and awesome beach”
<Content>Our family returned to the Prince for the 4th time - we were not disappointed. Yes the rooms are a bit tired and need updating - BUT, the service is impeccable, the beach is fantastic and the hotel never feels crowded even when it's 100% occupancy. The Prince is the best hotel in Wailea in our opinion - the grounds are beautiful and everything feels quiet, lush and secluded. You can sleep at night hearing nothing but the ocean. The restaurants are fabulous - try Hakone for the best Japanese buffet on Maui - or their breakfasts which are legendary. Our son scuba 'ed here with Steve; we'll try the Eco-kayaking next time. The Maui Prince is what Hawaii was 20 years ago - kind, gentle, lush,welcoming and beautiful. If you are lucky enough to land a great deal on Priceline or Hotwire - enjoy!! it's like winning the lottery!

<Title>“Nice rooms but don't pay for 'prime ocean view'”
<Content>We had two rooms 2/23 to 2/27/09. One room was 'partial ocean view' for and the other a 'prime ocean view' for nearly twice the price. Both rooms were large with big, comfortable beds. Another nice feature was in-room safes large enough to hold a laptop. I was a bit disappointed with the view from the 'prime view' room and even more so when I saw that the 'partial view' room had a much better view. The 'prime view' room was on the South wing and faced the pool and Mahuna Point. There was little or no water view when sitting on the bed or couch. The 'partial view' room was on the North wing and had a full ocean view facing the West Maui mountains. After learning more about the views, I asked management for a room change or rate reduction and it was eventually and grudgingly granted for a portion of my stay. Another thing to consider is that there is no pool or outdoor eating area with a view of the ocean due to the sand dune ridge between the property and the water.

<Title>“Awesome!”
<Content>We were booked at a hotel down the strip, but because the service was horrible, we cancelled & made a last-minute booking @ the Maui Prince. Needless to say, it was a very good move. We arrived on Sat., 2/28/09. The service from the Valet, to the Bell staff, on to the Front Desk staff, was IMPECCABLE! They made us feel like we were VIP's. We arrived at 12pm and were accomodated with rooms next to eachother. The rooms were clean, spacious, and the balcony is huge! The view, just MAGNIFICENT! I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Maui. The price is right for the location & accomodations. Nothing but great memories there, thanks to the staff!

<Title>“Ideal location, half the price of other hotels in Wailea”
<Content>We just got back from a two night stay at the Maui Prince. We were very happy with the resort. The location is perfect. It is just one mile North of the best beach on Maui. ("Big Beach"). It is a quick drive to "The Shops at Wailea" (eat breakfast at Longhis). A few miles up the road is the town of Kihei(tons of great dining options). The hotel was very clean and comfortable. It appears that all rooms have an ocean view. Not bad for $190/night on hotwire. A great deal compared to the rest of Wailea. No resort fee, free valet parking, mini fridge in room w/ free bottled water. An all around great experience. We would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Amaing views, secluded location, decent rooms”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for the first 3 nights of our honeymoon from February 5-8th. We had an Ocean Front King Room that was right in the center on the fifth floor. Positives - Best view of our entire trip, looks at Molokai, Lanai, and Molokini - Location is quiet, secluded, and uncrowded yet close to main strip in Wailea - Bed, linens, pillows all super comfy, slept like a rock - Super private lanai(balcony) that no one could see into - Excellent 630am snorkel trip on catamaran right from our beach, we were the first and only snorkelers to Molokini that morning and had it all to ourselves. - We both had excellent, pricey 80 min massages our first day, but worth it after the long plane trip, cheaper than other resorts we stay in - Whales are everywhere, rent a kayak and go sit and wait for them to come to you - Ivan at the sushi bar made us some incredible rolls Negatives - Slight musty smell in the bathroom/closet area, makes the room show its age - Totally overrated/overpriced Sunday brunch - Two small hot tubs that were not up to par, dirty and reeked of chemicals Overall for the price we paid it was worth it. It was a stunning view that we could never have afforded in Wailea. It's not the Four Seasons but we could not have afforded their outrageous prices anyway.

<Content>We took advanatge of a 4-day kids-free weekend and headed to Maui. We were attracted to the Maui Prince by the $225/nite rate and figured we would just roll the dice. Well, we ended up with an ocean view room (I think all the rooms are ocean view). The service was impeccable, the staff very friendly and accomodating...I didn't want to leave. If you are going to Maui and want to head for the end of the road on the south shore and be treated exceptionally well.....this is the place for you. We will be back!

<Title>“Very nice, friendly hotel with a great beach!”
<Content>We stayed here as the 3rd leg of our honeymoon and very much enjoyed our stay. When we arrived we were decorated with a shell garland which was a lovely touch. We had paid extra for an ocean view room so were a little disappointed to only have a partial ocean view. The room was large and clean and had all the amenities we would have expected. The hotel itself has a small salt water pool which is perfectly sufficient as there is an amazing white sand beach with a private access from the hotel (although all beaches in Hawaii are publicy owned and accessed also). There are all sorts of different kinds of beach equipment for hire at the beach shack but we would recommend hiring boogey boards for a couple of hours, but wear a t-shirt as we both got burned because we were too busy having fun and had not applied enough sun cream! Another nice touch at the pool was the free cold towels and pineapple pieces for anyone that wanted them. Very welcome when relaxing in the Hawaiian sun! There is a friendly shuttle service at the hotel which takes you just about anywhere within 10mins drive. We used this to go to the local shops, golf courses and restaurants and it runs from around 7a.m. until 9p.m. The hotel itself does not have much choice in terms of restaurants. There are only 2 but one is not even open every night. However, in the local area there are a lot of good quality restaurants. Seawatch is particularly good for a selection of locally sourced delicious sea food! We would recommend the sea food sampler starter, it was amazing!

<Title>“quiet hotel with great location...”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Maui Prince for 3 nights in January and had a great time there. We stayed here 3 years earlier on our honeymoon and when coming back to Maui again, we stayed here again. We got a good deal with their 'Winter Escape' package where we got a prime oceanview room and $50/daily resort credit for $330/night (with discount from their loyalty club). The room had nice view of the ocean and was clean. We like that the hotel is usually quiet and doesn't appear crowded (never had to wait more than 15 seconds for an elevator) and the beach was pretty empty when we were there. We did some snorkling off their beach two mornings. We rented gear at the hotel for $9/hr. The gear was OK but we probably will buy gear and bring it with us instead. The snorkling is better off the southern side of the beach. We actually stumbled across a sea turtle and got to watch him swim around the last morning we were in Maui. They also have alot of fish to spot. The waves are pretty calm so surfing doesn't really happen. More of a snorkle beach. We ate at the hotel for breakfast twice. It was OK for $25/head but there was a better place just down to road for breakfast (Seawatch) that is half the price and food is better. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurants but made alot of use of their hotel shuttle that goes anywhere in Waliea area. We would take the shuttle up to the hotel restaurants nearby for dinner (so we could both have Mai Tais with dinner). You just need to tip the driver a buck or two.

<Title>“Good for price”
<Content>My husband and I recently stayed at the Maui Prince hotel. We went to Maui to get married and to honeymoon. I must say, after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, they were pretty right on. Hotel The Maui Prince was great in that it was pretty secluded and quiet. The rooms were a little out-dated, but they were comfortable for our needs. The beds were nice and comfortable and everything in the room worked and was pretty clean. I would definitely recommend going for an oceanfront room. It was nice to keep the door open and sleep to the ocean (a luxury we don't get here in KY!) One thing I thought was strange was the water fountain in the garden. The grounds were very beautiful and well kept, but all we could hear until 8pm was the water fountain in the koi pond. The fountain didn't really serve a purpose and overshadowed the ocean for a while. Beach The beach was nice. We easily got lounge chairs and our pick of spots. There was even a guy from the hotel walking around making sure everyone had what they needed and offering cups of water. I would recommend taking a short drive south of the hotel to Big Beach state park. It was pretty empty when we were there and was very serene. Staff The staff was ok. It was nothing to rave about, but we didn't really have any problems. There is free valet parking (a tip of course is expected) or you can self park. I would recommend self parking. The parking lot is not far away and you save yourself the money for tips. However, the first day we arrived, the valets pounced on the car and seemed irked that we did not want to take advantage of their services (I was just being dropped off while my husband parked). Food To be honest, we only ate at the hotel once (excluding the luau). We ate at the pool grill after a day at the beach. The food was good, but pricey for what we got. Iwould highly recommend going to the Shops at Wailea for a couple of meals. Longhis was named "best breakfast in maui" and we couldn't agree more! Everything is homedmade, the service was great, and the atmosphere was laid back. I was hesitant at first because it looked like a fancy restaurant, but we saw people in everyhting from board shorts, to work out gear to resort wear in there for breakfast. I would also recommend have lunch or dinner at Cheeseburgers island style. Everything is ala carte on the menu. Also, if you're a pop drinker, I would get the bottomless mug. It pays for itself in 2 refills (refills are not free). If you're around any of the restaurants (wailea or lahaina), you can take the cup in for a refill. Each room has a minifridge in it. I would recommend going up to Safeway (on Pi'Ikea near Hilo Hatties) and get some drinks and snacks to keep in the room. It saves money and the hassle of running to a vending mchine. I apologize this review is lengthy, but I've always found Trip Advisor useful and wanted to share my experience.

<Title>“Fantastic Hidden Secret of a Hotel!”
<Content>I almost hate to write this review, as I'm afraid this little secret of a hotel will be spoiled. My husband and I have stayed at this hotel numerous times, and we have to say we love it. For the location, for the people, for the privacy; it's what a tropical hotel should be. Located in Makena, Maui, surrounding hotels cost twice what the Prince does. Go ahead and compare the Grand Wailea, The Four Seasons, or the Fairmont Kai Lani and you'll see the Prince resort's prices are unparalleled. Maluaka Beach is right in front of the property; it's one of the prettiest around. Thomas the bellman remembers us each time we arrive (he's been to our home town before which is why he remembers us). He's such a nice man and is all smiles. Ron at the front desk remembers us when we check in. He's always pleasant to interact with. Tina by the pool remembered us as well, even though we've only seen her one previous year before. The rooms are in need of some attention (and funding) but they've recently updated the linens and fabrics. Though the furniture still needs to be updated, the rooms are comfortable and clean. Each room has a large in-room safe; there is more than enough room to store a laptop. Each room also has a mini fridge large enough to store a box of left-over pizza. The beach is gorgeous. Hotel guests have access to free beach chairs and umbrellas, and the friendly beach staff keep the beach clean. The sand is tan in color, and somewhat fine in texture which makes for crystal clear blueish-green water (meaning that the sand isn't so fine that it's easily stirred up within the waves, resulting in cloudy water). If ever there were a place God would vacation, Maluaka Beach would be it. The water goes out quite a ways at knee-to-waste deep before it's up to your chest (I'm 5'5"). But the waves aren't harsh; they're quite manageable for teens and adults alike. But I wouldn't leave a toddler to play at the water's edge alone. This is because there is a wee bit of a drop off (about a foot) near the water's edge where the waves break that takes the water's depth from ankle-deep to knee-deep. Add in the waves, and you've got trouble if you leave a toddler to play by themselves too close to the water. There is no lifeguard on duty at this beach, so swim cautiously. However, because of the gorgeous clarity of the water and its relatively shallow depth (25 to 30 feet) snorkeling here is lovely. Turtle Town is around the rocky outcropping to the north from this beach and the little Honus (turtles) can periodically be seen coming into the bay, gracefully floating by. The water is so clear that in the past, my husband and I have been wading waist-deep when a Honu came by and stayed around for 20 seconds giving us a nice close-encounter with 'the locals.' This beach is quite a treat. The Prince Hotel pool does a nice lunch menu with some tasty mahi mahi tacos ($18), flavorful classic Caesar salad with authentic dressing ($12), guacamole dip with chips and salsa ($10), and some wonderful sandwiches ($14 to $18). Alcoholic drinks by the pool range from $5 to $9.50 for the more frou-frou drinks, but all were served with pineapple slices and umbrellas. Iced lemon water is available free of charge as you lounge by the pool. For some inexpensive eats, I recommend going to Cheeseburger Island Style in the Shops at Wailea (3750 Wailea Alanui Dr. toward the back of the shopping center, lower level: Burger $9-$10), or to Amigos in Kahului (333 Dairy Road:Tacos and burritos $5), or to Aroma D'Italia Ristorante (1881 S. Kihei Road, on the corner of Halelani Place and S. Kihei Road:$10 to $15 per entree at dinner). For a real Polynesian experience, stop into Wow-wee Maui Kava Bar in the same shopping center as Amigos for some real Kava. This drink goes back centuries and is a great part of history to experience; but its an acquired taste. If you can afford one, the Prince Hotel has a fantastic masseuse named Rene Ruiz. A 50-minute massage was $90, but well worth it!! She was great; the pressure wasn't too hard, she did a combo of diff massage styles, and I felt so relaxed and tired afterward, a lounge on the beach was all I could manage. The atrium within this hotel is unreal. There are dozens of tropical birds to be seen with thousands of plant species. Their nature trail within the atrium is educational and quite beautiful as well. The koi pond is amazing and stocked with tons of fish you can feed. I recommend feeding them and watching them fight for the food to get some great photos! They almost leap out of the water! If you get a room within the lower numbers (x10 through x20, where 'x' is the floor you're on), you'll be able to see, smell and hear the Luau that occurs on their grounds every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. I recommend getting a bottle of wine, and sitting on your huge patio to listen to the luau in the cool evening breeze. Or better yet, buy a ticket to the luau to partake in the awesome food. The kalua pork is from their imu (undergound oven) and is HEAVENLY; so tender, so juicy, so flavorful. The hotel periodically has star gazing parties that can be a lot of fun. The surrounding golf grounds also belong to the hotel, so their parties will take place near a green or hole of the course so you get an unobstructed view of the dark night sky (there is very little light pollution at the Prince Hotel). We were there during the Geminids last year (little meteors) and had quite a show of shooting stars. If you can't tell, I love this hotel and her staff. It's such an amazing little place to be (and its always so quiet when we're there) that I'm always sad to leave her. I hope you check out the prices and the website http://www.princeresortshawaii.com/maui-prince-hotel.php to formulate your own opinion!

<Title>“1980's Charm”
<Content>We ended up at the Maui Prince after blind-bidding online at a nameless wesite and were pleased with both the price and the hotel. We noticed that hotel's own online rates were very reasonable as well. This may be due to the current economic times, but we certainly felt that we received great value. If we had been paying full rack rates, I think our scrutiny would have been higher. That in mind, we had a wonderful time and liked the 1980's Hawaiin feel. The bed and the carpets were very comfy. Everyone was very friendly and because the hotel was half empty, it was extremely quiet (except for the birds living in the atrium garden!). The in-room fridge was also a nice extra that allowed us to have snacks, breakfast and drinks on the patio. There definitely are some things that need updating; the jacuzzis near the pool were both sort of broken and our bathroom had a stand-up shower that had been sealed shut in favour of another shower in the bathtub. But nothing that would spoil a vacation. We did the Saturday sushi buffet at Hakone (which was pretty full that night) and were impressed with the quality. We also enjoyed brunch at Seawatch at the golf course up the street. We liked driving around and didn't mind being at the end of the road; if you'd rather be centrally located then I would recommend Wailea.

<Title>“Great first trip to Maui!!”
<Content>We had an incredible time for our first trip to Maui. We recommend staying at the Maui Price for many reasons. Location is great for snorkling, great pricing for hotel compaired to others, food pricing is much better than others we looked into. We are telling friends they need to stay here if they come to Maui. Our trip was great. The weather was perfect for this time of year and fortunately it didn't rain at all. It is connected to it's own little beach with a great view. The only negative thing I could say is that the pool was WEAK compaired to other locations! But, we were at the beach more than the pool. Don't expect much if your into pools.

<Title>“Satisfied With Our Stay”
<Content>We stayed 3 days at the Maui Prince last week and enjoyed our mini-vacation there. Hotel : as stated in previous reviews, this is a bit of an older hotel. However to me, it felt like a classic Hawaiian hotel. Lots of aloha service with minimal fanfare. As you drive up, you're greeting with a shell lei and friendly valet/porter service. Walk thru the doors and you see the lush atrium of the hotel. To the left is the reception desk and to the right is the coffee bar and gift store. There is a concierge desk with helpful information on many of the activities Maui offers. You can also "rent" a computer with internet service to check/write emails or print out any documents. Our check in was smooth with a suprise upgrade and a toy bag for our son! Room : was a perfect size for 2 adults and one baby. We requested a crib which was brought to our room immediately upon arrival. There's a nice little bar area next to the bathroom with a small refrigerator. Our bathroom was fine...everything worked and it was clean. There were Neutrogena hair & skin products, plenty towels on hand & a rubber mat for the tub available for the guests. There's also a safe in the closet so you can put any valuables in it during your day at the beach/pool. The view from our lanai was awesome. Palm trees and the ocean, what else can you ask for? The best part of our room was the bed....the minute my head hit the pillow, I was out! I wanted to lug it home with me! Location : pretty much the last hotel in Wailea. If you don't want to eat anything at the hotel, you'll have to drive to The Shops of Wailea or into Kihei town for a meal. It's nice that the hotel is farther away from the hustle & bustle of other hotels though. Service : awesome!!! Everyone who works at this hotel, from valet to pool attendents, were so friendly to us and showed us much aloha. The lady who bussed our table at the breakfast buffet even gave our son some fish food to feed the kois in their pond. The only small complaint would be the pool. One small pool for adults and another smaller pool for the keikis. But it's all minors when there's a beautiful beach just steps away. I would definitely go back to this hotel on our next visit to Maui!

<Title>“Please, I beg you to rennovate!”
<Content>This is the second time we stayed at the Maui Prince, so I knew going in the rooms are directly from the 1980's. Makena is my absolute favorite part of Maui, so we overlooked the fact that this hotel is badly in need of a face lift. This trip we split our time on the island between Makena and Kapalua since we never spend much time in West Maui. This may be why I am so upset with the Maui Prince --- the Deluxe rooms Ritz-Carlton Kapalua were cheaper than our Ocean View room at the Maui Prince. The Prince needs to lower their prices until the hotel is brought into the year 2008. Pros: 1 - LOCATION, LOCATION and LOCATION By far our favorite beach on Maui is the Maui Prince beach. Sea turtles to the left, great spot for bobbingin the ocean without getting pounded by the November ginormous waves. Ahihi Bay marine preserve is 5 minutes away by car, the best spot on Maui to swim in an aquarium. Shops at Wailea a close 10 minutes. Makena and Wailea have less resorts, so you feel like you are in Hawaii. Lahania/Kaanapali area makes you feel like you are on Spring Break. Influx of cruise ship passengers combined with a billion other resort/condo dwellers make for crowded beaches and restaurants in West Maui even in off-season. Was I on Front street or a port in the Carribean? 2- View from our room Great hotel for watching the sunset 3- Very friendly staff Cons: 1- Rennovate or drop your room rate - The bathrooms were worse than I remember. Slippy shower, or maybe I'm just clutsy. 2- No restaurants - I had the choice of Sushi (yuck) or eating room service every night since the hotel closed their Prince Court restaurant. Had to drive to dinner. Breakfast buffet had great food and a large selection for $24 per person. 3- Hotel Pool - Very small - plan on heading to the beach and skip the pool On our next trip to Maui, we will stay in Wailea and skip the West coast. Unfortunately, we will not stay at the Maui Prince until it has been rennovated, if one is planned. I know the Prince hotel in Kauai has been updated, so I will paitiently wait until it is the Maui Prince's turn.

<Title>“Pleased”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince Oct 25 - Nov 1. Our third time at the hotel. Yes, it's a bit rough on the edges (cracked tiles, chipped paint, etc.), but the Prince has an unpretentious, casual, tropical vibe. Fantastic ocean views from many of the guest room balconies (lanais). Majestically situated on the lush, western slope of the Haleakala volcano. Great beach and snorkeling just steps away. Sure, the hotel pool is small and simple, but FTLP (for the love of pete) why fly to the Hawaiian Islands and spend your day poolside? Also consider: The Makena district, where the hotel is located, is a relatively undeveloped, natural area. You're not surrounded by other hotels, or condos, or shops... If you want a thoroughly groomed, manicured, squeaky-clean property, you may prefer Wailea.

<Title>“Disappointing”
<Content>We booked this hotel after staying in a sister hotel on Hawaii's Big Island. We were very disappointed with what we found. The hotel is very tired and the decor is now in a poor condition - some of the furniture was worthy of a working class bar rather than a high class hotel. The staff were not overly friendly, especially the pool bar staff. The pool itself is small with a cramped terrace and a low quality bar offering microwave snacks. The main hotel bar and restaraunt were tried once and then avoided, they were pretty dismal. There was limited internet facilities and these were charged at ridiculous rates. If you get invited to the luau, avoid it. The only saving grace is Makena Beach, it was fantastic.

<Title>“Suite Life at the Maui Prince”
<Content>On previous stays on Maui I have stayed at the Ritz-Carlton in Kapalua and the Four Seasons in Wailea. Well, I can now say that the Maui Prince is a notch above those other two properties in my opinion! First I want to give a big mahalo to Ron at the front desk, who assisted me in upgrading my reservation from a Mauka Suite to an Ocean Front Suite before my arrival. I called him the morning of my check-in date, and he was able to offer me an upgrade at a very resonable rate. For 10 nights, I stayed in the most beautiful suite I have ever stayed in on Maui. The suite itself was very spacious and well decorated. But the highlight was the fact that there were not one...not two...but three lanais from which to enjoy the spectacular views of the Pacific. From room 534 (on the top corner floor of the Wailea wing) there was a 270 degree panoramic view of the West Maui mountains, the Island of Lana'i, the islet of Molokini, the Island of Kaha'olawe and of course the stunningly gorgeous turquoise blue Pacific. Each morning it was a treat having coffee and breakfast on one of the lanais...as we watched the 6:30am departure of the Kai Kanani II take snorkerlers driectly from Maluaka beach in front of the Prince Hotel to Molokini. Some of our days were spent relaxing on the beach in the morning, snorkeling amidst the schools of fish and the occasional green sea turtle, and having lunch under one of the poolside cabanas before returning to the suite for a relaxing afternoon nap. Others days were more action packed: taking a day tour over to Molokai to do the World Famous Mule Ride to Kalaupapa to see the beauty and history of the former leprosy colony; driving the entire loop around the west Maui mountains; driving the Hana Highway and spending one night at the gorgeous Hotel Hana Maui; going to 2 different luaus: the Old Lahaina Luau and the Feast at Lele; or taking in a Vegas-style theatrical production called 'Ulalena in Lahaina. Regardless of what we chose to do, the Maui Price Hotel was the perfect place to return to each evening to absorb the beauty of the sunset over the Pacific. (Check out some of my photos.) And I have to admit that the bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. The Maui Prince is much more relaxed than the other resorts in Maui at which I have stayed. The entire staff goes out of their way to exude a spirit of aloha which other mega resorts call only dream about. The beach was gloriously uncrowded, since it is shared by no other resort at the current time. The snorkeling directly from Maluaka beach was so incredible that we did not feel the need to go to Molokini. And the room service was so delicious that most nights we just ordered in and relaxed in our spacious 1100 square foot suite while enjoying the sounds of the crashing waves. The pool was perfect. Just large enough to do some laps after swimming in the ocean, but not so large as to be overrun by screaming children...as is the case at some of the other mega resorts in South Maui. The complimentary cabanas were always available; and the poolside service was very friendly and prompt with towels, drinks and food. On our final day, I was granted a late check-out of 6pm since my flight back to the mainland did not depart until 10:40pm. What a superb gesture of customer service on the part of the management of the Maui Prince! Mahalo for that! I can not give enough accolades to the Maui Price Hotel. Everything truly was "Perfectly Prince!" I will be back!

<Title>“Oasis”
<Content>I was a little tentative having read a few mediocre reviews of the Maui Prince....but I was pleasantly suprised upon arrival. We stayed for 4 nights. The location is terrific; an area that feels like the "real" Hawaii, not a commericalized Hawaii- themed playground. And NO silly resort fees like its pretentious cousins charge!!! The hotel itself is relatively upscale, but certainly not pompous or over the top. . Very low key and tranquil...and its built around a beautiful lush courtyard. Our room was large and meticulously clean..and the housekeeping went above and beyond to keep it that way everyday. Lastly the beds were sooooooo comfortable! The room also had a good size empty refrigerator which we were able to put to good use for sodas, and lunch provisions. Given the cost of eating at the hotel, or frankly anywhere on the island; we really appreciated that. What initially drew me to the Maui Prince was the beach. And it didn't disappoint. Excellent!!!......clean, and never croweded, Best of all, the snorkeling was good; and even though we drove to some much touted snorkeling spots on the island; frankly there there was no need to. We saw several turtles, and a great variety of fish. My only complaint was they start coming to pick up and lock down the beach lounge chairs too early in my opinion. Also, its very expensive to rent an umbrella ($15/day - better to bring your own) Lastly, if you have a pineapple you wish to enjoy, bring a knife!!! I was stupefied when we called for a knife and were told it would cost $5 for them to cut up our pineapple for us. This was the only moment that slightly soured our stay. All in all, I thought the Maui Prince offered a relaxing Hawaiian oasis. If you are looking for nice digs without all the glitz and glam, then this is your place!

<Title>“Treated Like Royalty”
<Content>Spend a little bit extra for the best ocean-view room available. It's worth it to see the tremendous sunsets over the water every evening, and the beautiful violet-blue of sea and sky each morning. Amazing beach for swimming, snorkeling, walking and sunning - who needs a pool here anyway? This is not the place for all-night partiers, but for romance and serenity. Lots of honeymooners and anniversary couples. The helpful and professional staff made us feel like royalty.

<Title>“wonderful property, convenient in many ways”
<Content>Before booking this stay, we checked many reviews. So we tought it would be ok, except when we got there...everything was amazing! First of all, I want to adress the issue of the decor. I know hotels in the States really focus on the rooms, while for us it's more about the overall experience. The rooms aren't new, but the furniture and design are very, very classy and eternal. If remodernised now, it would end up looking just like the other hotels. This one has an elegant soul. The whole layout of the hotel is wonderful. There's the spacious terraced lobby overlooking the internal garden and the koi carp pond, also the other hotel grounds were the most beautiful tropical garden there could be. The beach in front of it is also beautiful. The views of Molokini (specially sunset and sunrise) are quite something. It's a resort, but since we went there in September after Labor day, it wasn't crowded at all. That was also noted by other reviews. Since the sheer size of the hotel, we would never really grasp the number of people staying at the time. However, when we went to the morning yoga session on the lawn overlooking the beach, it was almost like having a private instructor. The staff in general was great, helped us with planning all our other activites in Maui. About the location, yes, it fells amazingly secluded since it's the last hotel in south Makena, close to some great looking beaches (Big Beach, Small Beach, La Perouse Bay is also nearby). But if you have a rental car, and you probably want to have it for you trip to Maui, you can reach Wailea in minutes, than take the highway bypassing Kihei and from there on to the other attractions of the island. We felt that if we were to stay in Kaanapali, the drive to the other sights would have been much longer, since the road to Lahaina isn't as fast as the highway close to Kihei. Just one caveat, the shack next to the beach renting snorkling gear & other equippment is overpriced. There are many great restaurants in Maui, so we didn't eat at our hotel up to our last night when we just ordered room service. We were again surprised, the food was very good and the menu quite imaginative (for a room service menu). The breakfast buffet is a bit pricey. We would love to stay at the Maui Prince Hotel again, I don't know what the standard rates are since we booked a package through an online service (although we feel it was a bargain for the superb quality of the hotel).

<Title>“A bit dated, but still a great hotelâ€¦”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for our week-long vacation in September. Though the hotel dÃ©cor is a bit dated and the hotel could use a general â€œrefreshâ€�, the service that we received during our stay and the hotelâ€™s location are fabulous. We really appreciated the hotelâ€™s more secluded location, with great views of surrounding wooded areas, Maluaka Beach, Molokini Crater and surrounding islands. The other hotels a bit further north were surrounded by condos, other hotels and developments. The staff at the Maui Prince was very nice and accommodating towards us. They were always happy (and quick) to fulfill our requests and the service in their restaurants was good as well. The only warning I would give visitors is that there is a bit of construction noise due to a condo development just south of the hotel. The construction activity is limited to weekdays during business hours, but if you plan to relax on the beach or in a south-sdie room during this time, you will hear some of the noise. Overall, my wife and I really like this property and we plan to stay with them again on our next visit.

<Title>“This hotel was OK”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for 4 days. This hotel has really relaxed vibe. Secluded away from town about a mile from the shops at Wailea, which the hotel provides a free shuttle back and forth. The front of the hotel service and valet were really nice and efficient. If you want to get away this place would be sufficient. The views from the rooms and the secluded beach are beautiful. The hotel itself needs a make-over. This place is dated, doors and bathrooms are old and stale looking. They came to each room to change the picture frames and they looked the same. The picture frames in the hotel main area bathrooms are straight out of the early 80's. I guess they had recently updated the bathroom shower curtains to new white ones, I don't even want to know what the old ones looked like. The food at the hotel, was mediocre at best. Small portions and extremely overpriced all except for the breakfast buffet. I can't say I loved the hotel I've stayed at many hotels in Hawaii and this one I would not return to. The room prices are reasonable but you pay an arm and a leg for slow expensive food in all of the restaurants so they get you there. I wouldn't recommend this spot. I don't know why so many people love it, there are plenty of hotels that have the same ambience and beach front, but better.

<Title>“Great time at Maui Prince”
<Content>We just got back from staying at the Maui Prince during the last week of August. We stayed here 5 years ago for our honeymoon and we enjoyed our second visit just as much. The hotel is the last resort on the south end of the island. So if you are looking for a hotel surrounded by a lot of other resorts and busy with traffic zooming by such as the resorts in Kannapali, the Prince is not for you. A little more nightlife would be nice though. A little music in the lounge perhaps. The staff was extremely helpful with ideas for things to do in Wailea and Kihei. The beach is great as you can snorkle right off the baech and see all the turtles and fish you want. The rooms could use a little updating but the maid service was great as our room was cleaned most days by noon. The valet service was helpful during the afternoon rainstorms. Overall we enjoyed our visit and will recommend the Prince to everyone.

<Title>“Travel Agent Loved Maui Prince”
<Content>Maui Prince is a beautiful, quiet hotel. The Spacious rooms are newly renovated ,with beds so soft you don't want to get up! Very clean! All rooms have some view of ocean from a huge lanai- which is hard to come by in Hawaii. Huge Bathroom with seperate shower, and a tub with handheld shower, so two can shower at same time. Granite countertop with Coffeemaker and Refrigerator. Large closet / dressing area with free keyless Safe. Free Valet parking. Beautifully landscaped gardens and grounds. Nice pool area with Free cabana use. Attentive pool staff will bring you free Icewater poolside, or you can order a full lunch with drinks. (You can split the lunch - large portions, good food) 2 Hot tubs. Great Beach for swimming, and snorkeling (south side of bay). The Kai Kanani Catamaran departs right from the beach. A new boat with a fun and helpful crew. We took the early morning snorkel cruise to Molokini and saw the sunrise over Haleakala - just beautiful! This is a great hotel in the Wailea area. Just be aware it is in a quiet area, the last hotel along the strip of hotels. So... if you are looking for a hopping pool area and nightlife, this will not be your best choice. But...if you are looking for a restful retreat on beautiful Maui - don't hesitate! Notice all the "free" extras that this hotel includes and does not charge a resort fee! Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

<Title>“I think I'm in love with a handsome prince! The Maui Prince that is!!!”
<Content>Wow, where have you been all my life? Fabulous service, surroundings, and seclusion made our three days there the most relaxing and satisfying experience I"ve ever had in a hotel. My best friend and I traveled to Maui in support of a friend who was running his first triathlon at age 54. The Maui Prince was a great venue and the staff could not have done a better job making this event happen without a hitch. My hubby and I usually rent oceanfront condos when we visit the various Hawaiian islands, which I still prefer, but this hotel has literally thought of everything to make ones stay here enjoyable. Shore snorkeling, excursion and catamaran pickup right on the beach, yoga classes right on the beach, and attention to details like having a coffee, pastry, and smoothie kiosk right in the lobby that opens at 6 am for early risers like me. Ever heard of a hotel having free valet parking? You call down to the valet desk and ask for your car, leave your room, and by the time you've walked to the lobby the attendants have the car waiting for you out front, with the top down, a/c on, and music playing. We used the coffee machine and refrigerator extensively. Wine cooled along with cheese and meats for our pre-dinner drink and appetizers every night at sunset on the very substantial lanai outside our oceanfront room #130. I had pre-ordered a bottle of Charles LeFere champagne to be chilling in a bucket of ice for our arrival which we enjoyed very much. The room size amazed me! It was one of the roomiest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in at a fraction of the usual price. The grounds were beautiful and the pool and surrounding area was nice. Breakfast options: 1. For budget eaters, grab a coffee and freshly baked tropical fruit bread from the kiosk mentioned before and head to the beach for a surreal early morning experience. That's where I am as I'm writing this review. I'm the only person on the beach and I am near tears at the absolute serenity I feel here. 2. For an average breakfast, go to Cafe Kiowai to order ala carte or eat at their bountiful buffet. Beautiful surroundings overlooking koi ponds and waterfalls, which is what the center of the hotel consists of. Amazing! 3. For a splurge, eat their champagne brunch on Sunday morning. Great food and very good champagne , the same Charles LeFere we had before was served along with a very nice musical group to entertain all the diners. Expensive and fabulous! Worth every penny. We did not eat dinner at the Maui Prince. It was too much fun riding in our convertible to dine, otherwise we would have. From service to scenery, the Maui Prince has it all! Where HAVE you been all my life?

<Title>“Honeymoon/Romantics Dream”
<Content>Stayed here for our honeymoon and from the moment we checked in we felt like celebrities. So secluded with gorgeous beaches and your own snorkeling rental on property. The on-site luau was awesome (I've been to other Hawaii luaus when you have to bus to and from and this was the most authentic). Loved the pool area with private cabanas! Definitely a good place if you want to have a romantic vacation; no partying crowd nearby but close enough to party if you want. Loved it and planning our 5 year anniversary here!

<Title>“Stay Away!”
<Content>We just got back from our 9 day honeymoon in Maui and for the first 6 nights we stayed at the Sheraton Maui in Kaanapali which was ABSOLUTELY THE BEST HOTEL EVER! For the last 2 days my husband and I thought it would be nice to see another side of the island so we trusted the travel agent in picking the Maui Prince. BAD IDEA! We arrive to a hotel that is absolutely dead! They immediately checked us in, and she proceeded to give us our room when I told her that we were a honeymoon couple and if there were any upgrades possible (note that Pleasant Holidays has a thing they print out on our check in slip that says please give guests one free upgrade as they are honeymoon couple). She seemed irritated, and was gone for 10 minutes before she told us she would upgrade us from a partial oceanview room to a full oceanview room. Fine I guess, however, the Sheraton Maui upgraded us from same type room all the way up to an oceanview suite and there hotel was packed versus the empty Maui Prince, so I didn't get the logic, but I'm not going to complain on a free upgrade. We get in the room and you can barely see the ocean! It has a weird odor in it, the tv is so small you can barely lay on the bed and watch it, and there wre only 2 drawers for clothes- mind you we had tons of clothes so we just kept them in our bags. We ended up eating dinner out of the hotel at The Grand Wailea at HumuHumu, which I suggest to everyone!!!! The next mroning I woke up with a cold so we decided since the hotel was so slow, we would just stay in the room all day. We went down for breakfast at the grill they have and decided on the buffet for $24.95 each. Which is fine, that is what we had paid at Sheraton (actualyl we didn't, our package at Sheraton gave us breakfast for 2 free all 6 days, GREAT!) First of all, waitress was extremely rude, and she served no purpose at this hotel. There was a machine inside for Orange Juice and coffee, with the smallest glasses I have ever seen, so you basically serve yourself. The food was fine, nothign like the Sheraton, but there were maybe 5 other people dining at 9 in the morning, I thought that was odd and showed us how slow the hotel was. We went to the store to get me some cold medice and figured since the maid was in the room next to ours when we left, she would have cleaned the room up by the time we got back. WRONG! We came back about an hour later, so maid in sight, and the room hadn't been touched. I just wanted to lay down so my husband was kind and made the bed and cleaned up the room for us. Finally by 3 (serveral hours later) I called the housecleaning department to bring us up some towels. 4 rolls around, NO MAID! I finally went downtwains to front desk and told them about them not cleaning our room and she said that was really weird and asked if we had a do not disturb sign on and I said no we hadn't, we had just been forgotten. She said she would send some towels up right away. Within 15 minutes towels for finally broughten up, with no offer to clean teh room. I just couldn't believe it! We ended up giong down to the pool so I coudl lay in the sun and nap and hopefully the heat would help my cold. Yet again, NO ONE ELSE AROUND! I have never seen a pool so empty in Maui in my life. I geuss its great if you don't want a lot of noise, but at the same token, I'm not understanding why we weren't offered a better room considered we spent over $400 on the room we already had. The next day we got up early and left and decided to never stay there again! Its a great hotel if you like really quiet, but for us, we like quiet, but the option to go to a nice bar with people around for background noise. This hotel was sucha huge letdown, we just laughed it off and told our families of our trials at the hotel. If you are looking for somewhere to stay, try Sheraton Maui, every single employee there greated us friendly and helped us in any way possible.

<Title>“Great service but at times inconsistent.”
<Content>After reading several mixed reviews I was somewhat hesitant about how our stay would be. However, we were pleasantly surprised. Upon our arrival, the valet attendents literally ran our to our car with shell leis to greet us. I still cannot figure our how they new we were new arrivals. The service at the front desk was mediocre at best. We were not offered the cool towels as was touted as a part of the "Prince Pleasures." We stayed in an oceanfront room that was spacious, clean, fresh smelling, and offered an incredible view of the ocean. Yes, the room was outdated but had none of the mold or insects that I had read about. There was no turn down service (I guess you have to request it) which was a surprise considering the cost of the room. There was water for us that was replenished seemingly at the whim of the housekeepers. When enquiring about this at the front desk we were informed that there was a $3 charge per bottle. However, the next day there was more water. We ate at all three restaurants with the only disappointment being Cafe Kiowai. Not only was it incredibly expensive; it just wasn't very good with service at a minimum. The other places were amazing offering a different type of buffet nightly. The pool staff and service was just amazing. The food was great and the wait staff very attentive. They continually supplied fresh, cold water as well as fresh pineapple and cool, damp towels. The sandwiches there were large enough for two to share and they would split them for without being asked. We had a beachfront massage our first morning. The therapists were amazing, the surroundings were incredible. It was probably the best massage I have ever had. Later in the week, however, I had arranged for a couples massage. When arriving to a small room by the workout facilities we had to wait about 15 minutes outside. Literally outside on a bench. We were then informed that they didn't "do" couples massages and when I told them that I had arranged this through the concierege weeks before I was told that the concierege are all Japanese and didn't understand what I was asking. We settled for massages that were possibly the lamest massage I had ever had. Really poor service. Overall, the place was relaxing with the beautiful gardens that I had read about. The beach was amazing with sea turtles just a few feet from the shore. The snorkeling was great once you knew where to go. We took the sunset cruise and highly recommend that. The night that we went out was a light group. The staff was awesome and tripped over themselves to give us individualized service. Really wonderful! We stayed there because of a meeting for my husband's job and probably wouldn't stay there again. However, our stay was relaxing and come on, we were in Maui!

<Title>“Maui No Ka Oi”
<Content>Maui No Kai Oi (roughly translated Maui is the Best) This was a beautiful hotel. All the rooms had ocean views and the amenities were exceptional. The hotel location is separate from the rest, so you really feel a sense of seclusion. The rooms are big, bright and comfortable. Having breakfast out on your lanai is a wonderful way to wake up. If you happen to stay during a Sunday, definitely experience their famous Sunday brunch. I was there on business and the hotel staff was amazing in accomodating our group. I will be sure to stay here again.

<Title>“Excellent Place for Rest And Relaxation”
<Content>The Maui Prince is an amazing resort for rest and relaxation. Please understand that this is a place to enjoy Hawaii in a way that feels in tune with the island, and not over-extravagant. I like it because it has a beautliful beach which is not over run with tourists, beautiful gardens, and it can be affordable (by as far as Wailea / Makena area standards). One can still get a room for between $250 and $400 that has an ocean view, which is actually near impossible for anywhere else in Wailea. On the fair notice side, the hotel rooms decor is a little dated in a 1990s hawaiian style feel, which I liked. In addittion the 2 pools are circular and simple / small by the mega-resort standards of Wailea. But if you want a dip in the pool and enjoy the ocean (where you can walk out about 100 - 200' without hitting coral) then this is still your place :)

<Title>“Loved the Maui Prince”
<Content>My husband and I recently stayed at the Maui Prince. Everything about it was wonderful. We have traveled alot and stayed at a lot of different hotels, and I still would have to give them a 10! We had previously been in Waikiki and had stayed at the Wyland Waikiki. The service there was unacceptable. Then when we arrived at the Maui Prince, we were so pleased. They meet you at your car, greet you with a shell Lei, unload your car and take your luggage up to your room, park your car, and this is all free of charge. Everyone there is so friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet is fantastic. We only had 3 days there, but I wish we could have stayed alot longer. Don't hesitate about booking here. I guarantee you will be happy.

<Title>“Pretty darn great”
<Content>The maui prince is along the long strip of South Maui hotels...not nearly the caliber of the four seasons or the grand wailea...but then again, the price isnt as ridiculous as well. We were glad we chose the prince though, because you're in hawaii....how much time do you really want to spend in a hotel room? The staff was friendly enough. Seashell leis, cold towels when we got there. The housekeeping kept our room nice & we got a lot of towels from them. The pool was fine, small, but that kept it from being a kid zone. Never had troubles getting spots under the canopies & the drinks were good (though pricey). Hottubs were fine as well. It worked out well for us though. We got on the top floor & had a garden view, but when your view overlooks a lush golf course & a mountain, it's still not bad, so I didnt miss that we couldnt really see the ocean. It's a short walk anyway. The hotel room was slightly dated...could use an upgrade, but it wasnt bad. our shower had a leak in the faucet on the first day, but was fixed by the 2nd. There's a mini fridge in the room that you can use & they give you 2 bottles of water at the beginning. The room safe was free & handy to have. The AC worked fine, though we mostly had our door open w/ the screens because the weather was so nice. Bed was nice & soft, felt great. The tv was kinda lame, but then again, we didnt watch too much. They had internet hookups in the room (for ethernet ports), & I had thought it would be free, but it was about $40 for the week. Our room was on the south side of the hotel & overlooked the garden area where they held the Luaus. THAT got reallllly old after awhile & we were glad we never paid to go to it...we just got a bottle of wine & sat on our lanai & watched. Saved $80 each & we could go inside when it got too cheesy. Instead we went on a dinner cruise & had a great time. We also went on the early morning snorkeling trip from our beach on the Kai Kanaii. The staff there were excellent & it was a great trip, esp since we just walked right out of our room for it. We had breakfast once at the hotel buffet, but only once, as it was $25/person & we felt that was a little overpriced. The birds seem to fly around all over Maui & hop around on tables, so guard your food well...even with good wait staff, they'll take advantage. The beach at our hotel was fantastic...mostly sand & very secluded most of the time. on our snorkel trip we were about 200 ft out from the beach & swam with huge seaturtles (it's one of the 'turtle towns'). About 1/2 mile to the south is a great black sand beach where you can see the turtles from the shore. We never swam there as the water was too rough when we went. Big beach to the south is great too, very classic. Snorkeling around south maui is excellent. We rented equipment at Maui Dive shop (a heck of a lot cheaper than the hotel) & went to as many beaches as we could. BEST ADVICE: buy the "maui revealed" book & bring it with you everywhere...it's the best resource for places to see, eat & go.

<Title>“Great location, but could be better.”
<Content>After a long flight from Chicago, we arrived Sunday around 5 p.m. There was literally nobody in the entire lobby - which made me wonder if I picked the best resort to celebrate our wedding anniversary. There was only one lady checking in a family of 3, who received hot towels. After waiting about 10 minutes, she finally got to me. She didn't offer me any hot towel, and instead said I have a partial-ocean view. I asked for an upgrade, as it was clear the hotel was far from booked. She said none were available, but, she would put me on a wait-list. My wife and I proceeded to the lounge and were one of 6 guests in the entire place. The staff was friendly, but, without any guests, the place was less than lively. Next day we waited for the concierge who was talking to the same family of 3 I saw the day before. She never acknowledged me waiting, or, said "I will be with you shortly..." My wife and I took turns waiting. After the concierge was done, instead of talking to my wife, she picked up a cell phone and started chatting. My wife walked away frustrated, and I came over. I heard the concierge say "I gotta go..." and proceeded to help me. This place is nice, but, definitely not the same caliber staff or facilities of the Marriott or Four Seasons just up the street. We ate dinner at these two places instead because it was like a ghost town at the Prince. There is litle help at the restaurant too, and we sat and watched a dozen birds tear apart all the food left on the tables because there is no wait staff to clean up. The poor hostess has to do it all. When we left our room service tray in the hall after lunch, it was still there the next day. The beach is great and not having many people there was the best part. I think if the hotel focuses a little more on training it's staff to be more professional and attentive to guests waiting, it would go a long way. The front desk never did call me for the wait-list as promised, and I could see at night all the empty rooms. We also never received any champagne or fruit like other guests. Just don't tell me our rate is for the best available room but not give it to us. For those of you looking to celebrate a wedding or anniversary, I suggest you think twice about the Prince because you will not be excited when you get here. Granted, it's a good value, but, I felt like I let my wife down coming here instead of spending just a little more to enjoy a truly 1st class resort, which the Prince is not. I never saw a manager once, and I'm not sure there is one. Walking into the lobby you see about 3 or 4 staff - and that is all. A little attention to staining the dried-out wood room doors, and replacing all the small white tiles with something a little larger and more updated, along with a visable manager, whould go a long way. The beach can't be beat.

<Title>“Loved the Prince overall. Watch the surf on the beach and be aware of the beds.”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Maui Prince Hotel from June 11th through June 18th 2008. This was our second visit to a Prince hotel (the first being in Honolulu, which is a great hotel). The Maui Prince staff was great and the grounds were wonderfully landscaped (probably our favorite thing about the Prince). The room we stayed in was dated and looked as if it had not been remodeled since the 1980's, however it was well taken care of and very clean. We were given one of the lower rooms since we booked through Priceline; we did get a great rate which was $1000 less than any other hotel in Wailea so having out-dated carpet and furniture in the room was really fine. (Wailea is the place to stay in Maui). The bed on the other hand was horrible, I had to put pillows under the edge of the bed because it gave no support and I felt as if I was going to roll off of it. In addition to this. We were told when we booked the hotel that we would have a partial ocean view from some corner our balcony, which was true. My wife and I just pulled the table and chairs to the corner of the balcony that had the ocean view and had breakfast from there every morning. Even just looking out of the window from the room was amazing; the grounds are very well taken care of with palm trees everywhere and flowering trees as well (I have no idea there names, but they are great). One note regarding what is in the room, they have a dorm fridge that is for use by the occupant, which is great. Microwaves are extra however, we just brought a hotshot and had Oatmeal in the mornings. The area around the Prince (Wailea) is considerably more beautiful than Lahina and Kehei. It is very much an upper end area with the Prince located at the southern most region (maybe two miles from any other hotel). I would also highly recommend just making a walk on the beach/greenway south to Little Beach. It was simple yet one of my highlights of the trip. There are many tidal pools in the outcropping along with Black Crabs and other sea life in the pools themselves. There are also a couple of small black sand beaches along the way. Please be careful going into the water in front of the Prince!! When we arrived we were not informed of a swell that was occurring. The first time we got in the water the first time it was pretty calm however a lot of sand was in the water. We saw turtles off to the left near a rocky out cropping, however again it was murky and hard to see and around 10am the ocean became rough and were told to come back earlier in the morning when it would be more calm. So we came back around 7am the day before we left and got into the water as we normally would, right after we got out there and put our flippers on, several 5 to 6 foot waves began to hit us. This threw both of us about pretty severly. My wife ended up going to a local doctor for several cuts and abrasions (this was just from the sand on the beach!!) along with a huge burse on her hip, and twisted muscles in her leg. There is another beach called Ulea or something like that further north that is suppose to be much calmer and have more fish (we only saw a few the first day we went out). Just as a tip for eating out in the area, we ate at two very outstanding restaurants, the first is called the SeaWatch restaurant, which is located at a golf course near there and has unbelievable views and great food along with very good service (breakfast was about $10-$12 per person dinner was a lot more, $20-40 per person). The second was at Big Wave cafe in Kehei. This is not a fancy place as it is in a strip mall. However since they have 2 for 1 pricing from 5 - 6:30 PM, it did not really matter. I had macadamia nut crusted Mahi-Mahi (normally $24) and my wife had a steak (normally $22). Both meals came with salads and bread. Everything here came to around $35 after the tip!!! The road to Hana is beautiful but long, you will see shirts that read â€œI survived the road to Hanaâ€� there is a reason for these, it is nerve racking. I would highly suggest if you do it, get a hotel down there, then drive back the next day and see it all over. We left around 7am and got back at the prince around 11pm (there is a lot to see along the road which is the point to going). Also, I have personally seen the signs, you cannot get all the way around the south side of the island, and earthquake in 2006 took out several bridges. Overall we really did like the hotel, even if it was not as nice as the one in Honolulu. This is our third island to visit (Oahu and Kauai) and like most people you develop a favorite. We both loved Maui; however it is not lush and green like Oahu and Kauai. We decided that with all Oahu offers to see and do this it is still our favorite.

<Title>“Wow!! Fantastic!!!”
<Content>We were here 3 nights, as part of a 3 island, 25 year anniversary. We were overwhelmed, from the moment we drove up it was like they knew were driving up. We were immediately met by a lady comming up to my side of the car, and a man at my wife's side, to present us with shell leis, and another person wanting to get our bags, and yet another wanting to park our car. This was all complimentry, although I did tip the bellman for bringing up our luggage. The grounds, and lobby of the hotel are absolutely (as my wife exclaimed) AWSOME!!! It far exceeded my expectations, (I had a few reservations after reading some reviews about mold, remoteness, etc.). We had a partial ocean view, king bed. It overlooked the luau sight. We were not there during any luau nights, but saw a wedding Sat. night, right below us, which was cool. I have to say the bed was stacked wth pillows, and like sleeping on a cloud, we wanted to take it home. You "extra firm mattress" sleepers wouldn't like it. There were always lots of very friendly staff around, to answer questions. Pictures don't begin to do justice to the grounds. All I can say is WOW!!!! I might say we didn't see any signs of mold, (and my wife is very sensative to allergens). We also saw several couples young and older, celebrating marriages/anniversaries. Kihei is only 15 min, away, and loaded with shopping, eating, beaches, etc. We ate at Antonios(itialian) and Peggy Sue's (hamburgers), great. We got breakfast goodies at Safeway store, (open 24 hrs.) and had breakfast ou our lani, each morning. Hilo Hatties is also right next to Safeway. Most of the big events are at Lahaina, which is less than hour away, but the drive is so beautiful you won't mind a bit. The beach at the hotel was also the best. I dare say this was the best hotel experience I have EVER had.

<Title>“Maui Prince is Awesome”
<Content>The Maui Prince Hotel is such a great place to stay. Our room was very clean. Housekeeping was great. Refrigerator and safe in room had no problems. No AC problems either. Oceanview room on the third floor. The breakfast buffet at Cafe Kiowai was perfect. Attentive waiter and hot, fresh, new food. Ate there 4 times that week. Great snorkeling at the hotel's beach. Great location also. The "posh" Wailea is only 5 mins. away and Kihei is only 10-15 mins away. Kihei is where you will find restaurants/shopping/grocery. We were so pleased with the Maui Prince. Such a beautiful hotel. Great Value! May 21-28.

<Title>“Tranquil”
<Content>Quiet, calm, undisturbed, peaceful.................This was our third stay at the Maui Prince. We have been coming to Maui twice a year for years now and have stayed at numerous resorts and condos (Westin, Sheraton, Westin Villas, Wailea Marriott, Maui Hill, etc...) and the Prince is the by far the most serene. It is located about as far South West as you can get, a couple of miles south of the Shops of Wailea and a mile north of Big Beach. As others have stated this is an older property, but we did notice improvements in the room this trip, most noteably a new bed, which was very comfortable. The beach is never crowded and the snorkeling is very good. If you enjoy nice resort pools and jacuzzi's, this is NOT the place for you, The two pools are very small and the jacuzzi's are fiberglass. As we have gotten older (late 40"s), we have begun to appreciate the quiet slow pace of the Mckenna area. We saw lots of Honeymooners, lots of folks are age or older, but hardly any kids. Having brought our kids to Maui before when they were early/late teens, we can see why, our kids would have been bored stiff here and turned on us. If you are looking for a romantic, quiet (except for the birds) time, the Maui Prince is a good choice

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay!”
<Content>After reading the reviews of this hotel, I almost made a last minute change to our itinerary to stay elsewhere. However, we decided to take a risk after speaking with our travel agent who told us he was fairly sure we would enjoy our stay. He was correct! Although the hotel is a little dated and needs it's soft goods upgraded, the staff and the landscape made up for everything. We upgraded to an oceanfront room because the oceanview prime didn't give us a view of the sunset. (And that is our favorite part of vacation.) The hotel is set back on a very private piece of land. The beach is wonderful and is not crowded with a ton of people. I highly recommend having lunch at the clubhouse, the views are spectacular. All in all, the prince is a classic hotel. If you are looking for something new, don't stay here. But if you want to stay someplace with character and a great beach, this is a good place to stay.

<Title>“Maui Prince, Makena - Remains in My Heart”
<Content>My 2 sisters and I spent 11 days at the Maui Prince In Makena, our first experience at this lovely hotel. This trip was especially inspired by my Mom who passed away in April 2006 (her Hawaiian name is Makina) and to celebrate my 50th birthday. It was a once in a lifetime trip and I spent it with the best sisters. The hotel was beautiful, however, the room less desirable. I wish I had communicated better with my Travel Agent that a suite was preferred but our accommodations was a room with 2 queen size beds (more like full size) and a rollout bed. The bathroom had mold and mildew in the tub & shower units as well as the flooring. We did spend some time in the room and having a spacious living area would've been ideal but we settled for what we had unwilling to pay extra. We were upgraded to Ocean view but it really was a partial view with the luau garden and pool to the left of the ocean, that was ok. The morning workout activities at the Ocean side were early, at least for me, but so worth it. We enjoyed Julie Lee & her husband as they instructed Yoga and Tai Chi. The staff was very friendly and pleasant. The Director of Luxury heard our visit was in honor of our Mom and she sent us sweet compliments in her memory and on our last night, we came home from our long daily outings and found a gift bag of 3 Makena coffee mugs with a card from the General Manager. Not only were we surrounded by the peaceful and beautiful surroundings of Makena but Wailea and Kihei were just minutes away for plenty restaurant choices and shopping. The 11 days was definitely not long enough and as usual when returning from the islands, it remains in my heart with great desires to return soon. We had a wonderful time and I would recommend anyone who wanted all the pleasures of Maui and yet have a quiet and serene getaway, come here. To commemorate this trip, my sister and I got tattoosâ€¦ well that wasnâ€™t so pleasant but so worth it.

<Title>“A Prince of a Place”
<Content>Just returned from staying 4 nights at the Prince. The GOOD... Our room was nice , a little dated,clean with a lovely view. The pool was small, but heated and never crowded. Complimentary ice water served pool-side was a nice touch. The beach was beautiful with complimentary lounges making it outstanding. The gardens and grounds were bright, tropical and very well kept. The hotel staff was friendly, helpful and professional. The location is a bit out-of-the-way but if you want peaceful surroundings, then this is it. We were asked upon check-in if it was a special occasion, I mentioned we were kind of celebrating our anniversary which would be next month. A bottle of chilled wine was sent up to our room before we could even unpack. The BAD... Upon check-in the air-conditioning wasn't working properly, however once they were informed, the maintenance staff corrected it promptly. Construction work on the property was annoying at times. It is quite a ways from the hotel but the sound still carried up to the rooms. Fortunately, they quit at 3:00 pm, so it was minimal. The breakfast buffet is limited and only mediocre. The UGLY... The "Sunset Cruise" offered at the hotel is simply not very good and far too expensive. The "pupus" are stingy with little variety and the drinks, although plentiful, are poorly made. The cruise consisted of going up the coast a couple of miles, floating for a while, then returning. It was shameful, really. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Prince and will return. After all it is Maui, how bad could it be? Aloha!

<Title>“We came to love this hotel. Very relaxing. Excellent beach.”
<Content>The hotel is a little dated, however, the rooms were clean, the beach was uncrowded, the staff was friendly. Plenty of free self-parking. We hosted a business group of 80 people there and had a great time. Our customers loved the hotel. The mature gardens are beautiful. We had the buffet breakfast every day. The fish tacos by the pool were excellent. The food prices were reasonable. The cabanas by the pool are free! Pool service staff was available to wait on you. We went to walk around several of the other Wailea hotels realized how peaceful our hotel really was! We hiked up the crater next to the hotel. We saw white tailed deer and could view 4-5 groups of whales at one time. We walked over to Big Beach (Makena Beach) and body surfed. We really felt like we had left the rat race behind. I would go back there in a heart-beat!

<Title>“The ULTIMATE Tropical Paradise Experience!”
<Content>We've stayed at the Maui Prince Many times over the years, from when our child was young to a teen. IF....you WANT....a tropical experience that matches you life-long dreams, The Maui Prince is the place to stay! Our first time after a forever plane trip we drove...and drove...and drove..in the dark night over tiny banked roads until we came to the Southern end of the Island, then passed all the commercial standard hotels. We thought we must have gone too far as we suddenly we in the utter dark, with only tropical plants along the road, then suddenly...we crested a hill....and there was our Shangri-La! A tropical oasis....with soft glowing lights by the ocean. We drove up, tired, but happy, and we greeted by the most wonderful valets, kind, helpful, and genuinely happy to see us. We were led to the front desk where we gratefully accepted their warm, moist washclothes. We heard our first "Mahalos" from a beautiful lei-draped hostess, then were led to our rooms. To our amazement, there was no roof over the main hotel plaza....it doesn't rain in Southern Maui. The aroma of tropical plants was spectacular. We were led to our wonderful room that had two doors....an outter shuttered door you could leave open to let the tropical breezes waft through and an inner security door. We noticed the constant theme of whales over everything, so asked if you Really saw whales, or was that a rare occurrance..the bellhop casually walked to the large lanai (balcony) and said, well, there is a pod swimming below now...and we saw an entire family of whales swimming by!! The bed was huge, comfortable, and magnificent. The hotel had provided a huge basket of UNBELIEVABLY fresh, ripe tropical fruit. For our first breakfast, we ordered breakfast in bed. To our amazement, they brought in a real table, put in real linen, real siverware, a fresh orchid centerpiece, and our first taste of genuine fresh-brewed, genuine Kona Coffee, as we sat in our bed, Lanai door opened, and watched the sunrise. We were in paradise! They even brought a copy of the daily newspaper. To our surprise a little while later, there was a knock, and the manager and our assigned ?server/hostess/beautiful Hawaiin Maiden Tami..for the week was there with the manager, bringing our young daughter a complimentary stuffed animal, Maui the Whale! That morning we went to the beach for the first time and experienced Nirvana....we were the only ones there for a mile of perfect white sand beach, warm water, and perfect medium waves. To my amazement, whales would swim by just hundreds of yards away. We took the hotel Catamaran trip...something you MUST NOT miss! We sailed to a sunken volcano that was flush with tropical fish. On our voyage, then suddenly took down the sail, and said..look to the side. A gigantic whale appeared inched from the side of the catamaran, and lazily rolled to it's side to eye us, then over the next hour, swum beneath our Catamaran and eyed us from literally inches away, one with nature. What an experience! The next morning we tried the breakfast buffet, and we dazzled. How can I describe perfection? A warm, magnificent morning, warm, tropical breezes, sitting at a table on the edge of a large Koi pond FILLED with enormous Koi....who would jump out of the water willingly for a tossed piece of bread. The breakfast was magnificent...buffet style....with a selection of both American and Japanese fare. You'd sit back, nibbling on a piece of toast, imbibing the perfect Kona coffee, feeding the Koi, and feel the strings of work come off as you went into a dreamlike state. That afternoon we drove to the very close- by neighborhood hills and we stunned at the incredible display of flowers and the aromas of tropical paradise. One evening we took the incredibly-long journey to the "tourist" Western End of the Island with all the huge crowded resorts to go to the Swan Court. It was fun....live Swans literally strolling between the tables as you watched the sunset. We felt SORRY for the poor people paying three times as much to be jammed into the crowed commercial hotels. One day we took the Haleakela Volcano Sunrise tour.....picked up at the hotel before dawn, driven to the top of the FREEZING cold Volcano to witness your own personal sunrise, then ride bikes downhill for an hour without pedaling, going from freezing to tropical. We went to the world-reknowned Japanese-Sushi restaurant in the hotel...very traditional Japanese with bare wood tables...but the most incredible Sushi you will ever experience. Ivan was our Sushi chef...ask for him. The manager was so delightful...take the time to talk to him. TAKE THE TIME.....to have the best drink of your life....take the shuttle to the very close golf course 19th green, order the best Mai Tai of your life...then sit in the tropical splendor as the warm tropical breezes blow as you overlook the impossibly-green greens....that slope downwards from your vantage point to the crashing surf....with pods of whales swimming by! The golf course itself is unusual...a tiny fringe of green surrounded by volcanic rock with impossibly-perfect oceanic views. The only negative?....a teeny Motel 6 cold circular pool. This is the PERFECT tropical paradise for adult couples or couples with very young children. Teens would be bored.

<Title>“Maui Prince - Loved the privacy”
<Content>We just returned from Maui. We stayed at the Maui Prince and the Sheraton Kaanapali. Maui Prince was by far the favorite. We had ocean front rooms in both hotels. At the Prince on the fifth floor, we saw a lovely crescent white sand beach, Lanai and Earthquake Hill in the distance and koi in a landcaped stream right below the room from a spacious lanai. At the Sheraton, we saw a sea wall in building 6 off our balcony with just room for two chairs and a small table and the ocean with no beach. Yes the room at the Sheraton was fresher with a bigger bathroom but the hotel was more crowded and I felt that I could have been at any beach. The bed at the Prince was a winner. At the Prince, there was still a feeling of old Hawaii and relaxation. As a bonus, I could step out of my room at sunrise and see it over Haleakala framed by the huge garden atrium with waterfalls and a stream. At the Prince the beach lounge chairs and pool cabanas and valet parking were complimentary. The Sheraton charged for all three amenities. A lounge chair rental on the beach was $10.00. We did enjoy the luau at the Sheraton with prime seating at ring side for just an extra $10.00 with Maui Adventures. The Sheraton told me prime seating was sold out. All in all we enjoyed the beauty and serenity at the Maui Prince at Makena. Snorkeling off their beach is great and I swam with two sea turtles. There are lots of coves in Makena to explore. Spend the extra $ and rent a convertabile car to see t he island.

<Title>“Loved the Prince!”
<Content>We stayed our last three days at the Prince. It was a great way to end our visit to Maui. We also stayed in Kapalua and Hana. Each place was just as great as the other since they each had their own special appeal. The one thing they did all have in common was the quiet atmosphere that we so much craved and loved. The Prince did not let us down in anyway....the pool was nice and quiet.....just the way I like it. They came around all the time to check on your drinks and your needs. It was nice to be able to talk with the staff and not feel rushed. Everyone was very personable. The rooms were dated but they were very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel grounds were beautiful and I loved going for runs through the grounds and then out to the road. Great place to run. The June Triathonlon starts at the Prince.......I can see why. Lots of road bikes in this area. I can't say anything negative about the Prince because everything and everyone were beyond great. I can't wait to return.

<Title>“Wonderful Honeymoon!!”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews we booked this hotel with a little apprehension. However, our experience at the Maui Prince was wonderful from the time we arrived until our departure. The staff were warm and friendly, the rooms were comfortable and clean and the views were spectacular. We highly recommend this hotel to other travellers and would gladly stay there again.

<Title>“Great Beach!”
<Content>This hotel was great- Snorkeling was the best! Views were AMAZING! I was a lit'l concerned after reading some of the reviews- but if anything it helped prepare me for the hotel- I didn't expect the 4 seasons- but the hotel exceeded my expectations. Room was Clean, bed was not so great- but we were told they were upgrating, and with the sound of the ocean outside our window I had no trouble sleeping. Everyroom has a porch with table chairs and a drying rack- we stocked our fridge with breakfest food and ate on the porch every morning. A car is necessary- the hotel is off the beaten path- which makes the nights quite and pretty. We visited the 4 seasons- and it was LIGHT central--too much going on. The beach at the prince was better- and the snorkeling is amazing- we saw 3 turtles from snorkling off the beach. We rented our gear from an outside vendor for the week (it was cheaper then renting by the 30 min. at the resort) We ate out every night- Sorentos was AWSOME! Spago's sucked and they had $10 kona coffee on the menu--come on! The service at the hotel was great! they offered robes and slippers. We upgraded upon arrival to a room with a view- it was well worth the extra $50 a night we payed. Yea the pool isn't great but they added some unbrellas and it looks pretty- however, with there secluded beach- you don't need the pool. The beach is great! The hotel was the BOMB back in the day- it's a lit'l dated.....but the price compared to everything around and the views can't be beat! $250 a night with ocean view

<Title>“maui is heaven on earth”
<Content>The property was great, and the staff was even better, The staff was very helpful when our ATA flight was cancelled. The Maui Prince had all the amenities my wife and I wanted on our vacation, spa, golf, snortkeling, ect. . . . The resturants were good at the resort, but you will have to drive to find a varity of food. The coffee shop in the lobby was great for breakfast and cheap. We will be back.

<Title>“Amazing!!”
<Content>I read the reviews for the Prince everyday. They were mixed. We booked anyway. I was scared about finding a dirty and outdated room. We were afraid of construction noise. I was aware that others had said the staff was rude. We wondered if we should pay more to stay at the Grand Wilea or the Ritz. But, we took a chance on the Maui Prince, and we are so glad we did. We made our decision based on the properties seclusion, the small pool (no kids) and the beach. Why stay somewhere with a huge pool that could pass as a waterpark when you arent bringing the kids, and an amazing beach 20 yards from our room? First, check in was a breeze. We were greeted with a shell lei and a cold lemon washcloth to wipe away the grime from the plane. We booked an oceanview room, and were upgraded to oceanview prime. Our view was amazing. Room 523. Ask for it. There were rooms with better views, but they must have been the suites. We could see the palm-lined beach, the hotel grounds, molokini crater, and sunsets. Secondly, as other reviews have stated, there is construction near the hotel. We could see it, and hear it occasionally. What we did hear was quickly drowned out by the ocean and the birds. It was not a problem by any means. We found the staff to be outstanding. We arrived with a positive attitude, and left with a better one. We were polite and happy, and sure enough, the staff treated us the same way. When I made a request for housekeeping to bring us new robes, they were knocking on our door within 5 minutes. Room service was prompt and friendly. The activities desk handled all of our plans such as the luau and the sunset cruise. We reccomend any trip on the catamaran that leaves from the beach. The staff has alot of personality, and they dont skimp on the rum! Billy at the beach shack is very cool, and he knew us by name the first day. He can reserve you a beach cabana. The beach was windy, and that cabana saved our day. Also, not described anywhere, there is yoga by the ocean every morning at 7. And, pay the ten dollars to upgrade your seating at the luau. We had to wait in line, but we ate first and had fantastic seats for the show. Bring your money, the arts and crafts are impossible not to buy. They will also sell you a photo of your party for $20. Not worth it, but I bought it anyway, and wish I hadnt. We left the hotel once, to get our marraige license. We even got married on the hotel beach. Which, by the way, is very private. We sat near a couple that were staying at the Four Seasons. They came to our beach because it was less crowded, better snorkeling, and larger. That says alot. We watched whales breaching off shore, turtles swimming, and sunsets. At times, we were the only ones on the beach. And the hotel was booked. I cant say enough about the Maui Prince. Stay there while you can. Its only a rumor that it will be torn down, but dont take the chance of missing this wonderful peice of Maui where we left a bit of our hearts!

<Title>“Nice enough, but know what you are getting”
<Content>On the plus side: Â· The beach is magnificent and a short swim lets you observe sea turtles. Â· The service is excellent. Â· All of the restaurants seem to be wonderful. We ate in Hakone twice and in the bar once, both of which were excellent. The sushi bar at Hakone was exceptional (but expensive). Â· The central courtyard is drop-dead gorgeous, but there are few places to sit and enjoy it. Â· Parking is free, as are most of the other amenities that many other spots either charge for on an ala cart basis or in a separate (mandatory) â€œresort fee.â€� Â· It is a large property and, even when fully-booked, you'll think you are the only ones here. Â· The surrounding area is relatively undeveloped, making for lovely views and pleasant walking â€“ although there seems to be a lot of construction underway near the hotel, so that lovely isolation may soon be gone. On the other hand: Â· An ocean view room means you can see the ocean from some far corner of your lanai. (Our view was so bad the bellhop apologized for it and showed me where to stand to see the ocean.) You may face the more unattractive edges of the property from a lower floor. This is explained on the website, but I never found it when I booked my room. (I looked!) Had I known what I was getting, I either would have paid extra to up-grade or looked elsewhere, as this was the most expensive hotel on my itinerary and I was expecting a place where I could see the ocean. Â· Apparently they have very few king rooms. The vast majority of rooms have two full-size beds, not even queen beds. Â· Internet access is $10 a day. Â· The hotel is NOT located right on the beach. From an environmental perspective, I appreciate this. However, this distance from the ocean means lower-level rooms and the restaurants do NOT have a view of the beach, although lower oceanfront rooms do have lovely views of the ocean through swaying palms. Nor is there a beach bar. Again, not a bad thing, just something to know â€“ especially if you have a weakness for beachside cocktails at the end of the day :-) Nothing is cheap at the Prince, but there arenâ€™t many extra charges either. The price is reasonable when compared to similar properties at this end of Maui (we booked a multiple-night special at a rate of $255 a night, which was a good price around here) â€“ as long as you understand what you are getting. I didn't realize what I was getting and was very disappointed with the lack of view (you could see the ocean from one tiny corner of our lanai) and the fact there was nowhere else on the property to relax with a drink and enjoy the scenery. However, when I finally got really frustrated (near the end of our stay) and complained that the website needs to be clearer on what sort of view the rooms have, I was upgraded for our final night to an oceanfront room with a lovely view. Despite some of the other reviews here, I felt the management does want to please their guests. However, I also have to admit that I acknowledged that I intended to review the property here and that may be what prompted the upgrade. (I didn't ask for or even suggest an upgrade, but it was offered at some point after I explained that I intended to warn others about the lack of clarity on the website.) Still, guests in tears at the front desk seem to be something they really do want to avoid.

<Title>“Give me Maui Prince over ostentatious overbuilt resorts any day”
<Content>It all depends on your vision of a perfect vacation in Hawaii. If you are here for the resort, not to really experience Hawaii (but rather to be among other tourists in a place that would look perfectly at home in a -possibly gated-Florida vacation development) go north to the other resorts of the South Shore. If you like classic elegance with a bit of charming wear and tear, and a feel of being in the environment versus disneyland, you may really enjoy the Maui Prince. Driving past the other resorts of the South Shore, I was crossing my fingers, hoping we had not made a terrible mistake. We passed the highly manicured overbuilt resorts one by one, then drove a little further. With a sigh of relief we pulled into the drive to the hotel-surrounded by greenery, allowed to grow a bit on its own so that you have the sense of being in the woods, away from it all. And then we walked into the lobby and caught our breath! Designed as a large open square around a lovely Japanese- influenced garden, the hotel transports you to another place the minute you step into the lobby. The room we had was "partial ocean" and yes it was only partial (staff got a bit crabby when we asked about that) but from our lanai(balcony) we also saw lush plants and the island of Lanai'i outlined in the distance. The rattan furniture may not be brand new, but does give a welcoming, island feel to the rooms (as compared to say the Sheraton rooms which gave lip service to Hawaii but really could have been a hotel room in Vegas...) As to food, this was our one complaint/word of advice- avoid buying the overpriced hotel food. We went to the Court restaurant and were turned away due to my husbands t-shirt and accepted the redirect to the next door lounge (it was our first night and we were starving) which served the same food and was really only separated by an open doorway. The food was fine, not that great and came in small over-priced portions. This experience was to hold true for most of our trip- avoid hotel food and find something in the community. In this case I suggest taking the short drive to Kihei- look up stuff in Fodor's, Frommers, Lonely Planet or this site and forget hotel food. The coffee cart in the lobby is fine for breakfast (they have fresh fruit as well as pastries). The pool and beach. Okay the pool is small and just round (sorry again no Disney action here) and I could not do laps- but the ocean is great for that here and again we all really liked the pool. (yes I was surprised by the hot tubs but they are right next to the lovely gardens so who cares?) And the blue tiles, the canopied cabanas, the gorgeous gardens, just felt charming and cosy, and a lot more personal than some huge lot of over-manicured lawns etc. The beach is wonderful- great swimming when we were there plus lovely views of Molikini, Kaho'olawe island and West Maui. Not too big or crowded. And you can always head to Makena State Park and go to Big Beach- one of the best beaches on our trip. We brought a 12 year old who also liked it here, especially the beach. (there were other kids around as well) If I had it to do over, I'd definitely skip the Sheraton and the whole Ka'anapali thing and extend our stay at the Maui Prince. It is too sad that they are tearing it down---they could just do an "uplift" if they feel it's needed and keep the charm so lacking in so many other places.

<Title>“Fabulous Service”
<Content>We stayed in a partial ocean view room and were quite pleased with the hotel. While it is true the hotel decor is somewhat dated, the hotel is clean and the service is second to none. Although the pools are small, they are never crowded and the service at the pool is very personal. It is a large resort that feels like a small resort. While the beach here is uncrowded and fantastic, we chose to sit by the pool out of the wind and sun for our infant daughter. We never had trouble getting a cabana and the pools were never crowded. The bellman suggested and brought us a crib for our daughter at no extra cost which was very much appreciated. We would definitely stay here again. We traveled throughout Maui, but when we stayed here we never left the resort for three days and it was very relaxing.

<Title>“just right”
<Content>Really enjoyed the Prince. It isn't a full "resort" with several pools and an incredible workout facility, but is much more than "just" a hotel. Kind of something in between. Lovely grounds, at the end of the road, nice beach. Kids might get bored here. But, wonderful bird sounds and waves to wake-up too. If you want the full resort/spa experience, this probalby isn't the place. However, if you are happy with a nice pool, a nice beach and a lovely location and room, this is perfect.....(I would skip the restaraunt, though! The breakfast buffet is nice, but not dinner.....). Ron at the front desk was most helpful. The conceriege worked really hard at recommendations, but overall, I didn't really enjoy their dinner suggestions.

<Title>“Don't let the high price fool you”
<Content>I just got back from a long weekend in this hotel with my wife and daughter. At $400 a night, I expected at least a 4 star experience. What we got wasn't even close. First of all, don't be fooled by the intentionally misleading "ocean view prime" room. I specifically asked my travel agent for an ocean view, and he understandably thought I was getting one by booking "ocean view prime." Turns out we were on the 2nd floor looking at the pool and could barely see the ocean over the trees (if we stood on the deck and looked to the right). I complained, and they told me I wanted "ocean front" which would cost $90 extra per night. After checking, they told me they had none available. They offered to move me up a couple floors facing the same pool. That helped a little, but definitely not what I bargained for. And the front desk guy was getting impatient with me, as if I was asking too much. So we went down to the pool to get some food. The pool, by the way, is a joke. Its a small circle of a pool. Nothing you would expect at a nice resort. And here is the best part . . . there are two hot tubs next to the pool that are the above-ground kind you would buy at Sears. At a Holiday Inn I wouldn't complain. But for $400 a night, gimme a break! After sitting for 15 minutes at the pool bar, someone finally came by and asked if we were being helped. We asked how the $18 shrimp cocktail was. We were told not to get it. The shrimp was purchased pre-cooked and came in a bag, and wasn't worth the money. I appreciated the honesty, but I would rather pay $18 for quality. The next morning we went to the overpriced breakfast buffet. Its very basic. The cream cheese was actually covered in mold. My wife pointed this out and they replaced it, but again, no attention to detail. After 2 nights at the hotel, we decided to move over to the Four Seasons which was only slightly more expensive. When I checked out of the Maui Prince they told me they were still going to charge me for the 3rd night as a "penalty" for early check out, and the $100 credit I received for incidentals for a 3-night stay wouldn't apply. Smoke was coming out of my ears at this point. The desk clerk told me all this without even checking with a manager. She told me she would have the manager call my cell phone. An hour later, the desk clerk (not the manager) called me back and told me she spoke with the manager and the decision was final. This time I insisted on speaking with the manager. The manager told me she was going to charge me the 3rd night because my problem with the "ocean view prime" room was my travel agen't fault, not theirs. My travel agent, according to the manager, should have known better. I got her to give up on shafting me out of the $100 credit for incidentals, but not the $400/night penalty charge. I know there are a number of positive reviews on this message board. I am baffled to see that. Something tells me the folks who write nice reviews work for the hotel. At the Four Seasons, the staff is intensely focused on making sure guests are happy at all times. I felt like the opposite was true at the Maui Prince. A few other notes: -- The hotel is clearly early 80s vintage, and is in desperate need of a facelift. -- We had to ask 3 times to get a crib. -- There were some "salty dogs" at the pool bar who were clearly not guests and were there as friends of the bartender. They were loud and cussed a lot. That just added to our wonderful experience eating pool side. - The Four Seasons, the Grand Wailea and the Fairmont are all right near the Prince, and are all much nicer without having to pay much more.

<Title>“walk to makena beach”
<Content>This is the baby boomers delight!!! Rember old Maui when we couldn't aford more than a tent at Makena beach? Well, you can't do that anymore, but if you want to walk a trail through the trees to Makena stay here! Soon this classic will be torn down and investors will start over with some huge place that will be way over priced. The Prince still has the ambience and beauty of a stylish garden hotel, and the pictures on line do not lie. The aloha spirit is fabulous as staff will bend over backwards to make your stay comfortable and happy. The rooms are spacious and comfortable enough. We moved to an oceanfront room and spent most of the time on the lanai watching for whales. Because the Prince has lost its reputation for swank, there were not the usual wannabe's we experience at other hotels...and we had the pool virtually to ourselves and a few other readers. The beach in front of the hotel is in a little cove and protected from the wind. We hope to stay here again before it bites the dust...

<Title>“Marginal Value and Service Ranges from Indifferent to Rude”
<Content>This was our first trip to the Hawaiian Islands. Our expectations for the Maui Prince were based somewhat on two stays we've had at Mexican resorts in the Caribbean over the past 10 years. Both of those occasions were very good experiences, marked with polite, responsive, and respectful service throughout our stay and from all levels. This in turn was the kind of service we expected at the Maui Prince, and certainly for the price. But at one time or another we were disappointed -- from the front desk, to the on-site restaurants, to personnel at the pool and beach, to the valet. If the service wasnâ€™t generally indifferent, it was outright rude and disrespectful. The first night at check-in, our dates of stay were incorrect by the hotel system. First the clerk said that we would have to pay for an extra nightâ€™s stay because of â€œthe changeâ€�. We produced travel documents showing the correct dates to which the â€˜un-empoweredâ€™ clerk said weâ€™d have to talk to a manager-- who had gone home for the evening. We got it resolved the next day, but there was no genuine apology for the hotelâ€™s mistake or any effort to make up for it (just indifference). We didn't want to have to spend our time resolving problems like that. Next, the on site restaurants were never open at convenient times, some closing at 5:00 PM (which is about dinner time where we come from). So one late afternoon, my wife went to the pool to get something for dinner, and was told â€œsorry, weâ€™re about to closeâ€�; yet other people were still eating and drinking. As she walked away she checked the time on her cell phone and saw that it was 4:45 PM. She went back and showed the time. They took her order, but again, there was no genuine apology â€“ just indifference. Then at the beach, a beautiful beach by the way, there is a snorkel boat that leaves and returns every few hours. For anyone who is around the beach for any length of time, never mind a few days, the boatâ€™s activity is readily obvious and its visits and departures are no big deal; it moves at a snailâ€™s pace. For overblown safety reasons, we suppose, the people who charter it feel the need to shout about to people to â€œbe on the lookout for the boatâ€� and â€œDo you Understand!?â€� Iâ€™m thinking: Weâ€™re just walking down the beach; thereâ€™s no need to shout at us; itâ€™s disruptive to an otherwise quiet beach. And whatever happened to â€œExcuse Me, Please, and Thank Youâ€� as opposed to barking Commands at bystanders and strollers who are paying to vacation at the beach?? Finally, the Valet; theyâ€™re just plain rude; barking commands to people like at a boot camp, instead of treating people like they are vacationing at a high-priced resort. The rest of this review is to affirm what is stated in many other reviews: the bathrooms in particular are run-down and in serious need of refurbishing. Our bathroom was really dirty (cob webs under the sink counter, old dark-colored dirty water marks across the ceiling that looked to be from years of accumulation, mold in the showers, peeling wall paper and some gross, rusting metal at the overhead fire sprinkler. For the price, this is a 2/5 or 3/5 hotel at best. Plus keep in mind, you get indifferent and rude service too! The Maui Prince is a definite No; a definite Avoid.

<Title>“Paradise Light”
<Content>I booked the Maui Prince through Priceline (first time ever) after looking at my options for Maui in mid-January 2008. My options were all in the stratospheric price range for a resort, so I bid a relatively low price and ended up at the Maui Prince. After reading the reviews in Tripadvisor, I became concerned, but the reality is mostly good, which I will now report upon: First, the good -- this slice of paradise (Wailea-Makena) is tops on Maui because of the awesome views, spectacular landscaping, low humidity, relatively low traffic, and minimal commercial shlock to mar the beauty. When you arrive at the Maui Prince (about 30 minutes from the airport at Kuhului) you say "wow." The property is literally the last hotel on the road wedged between the Pacific and the mountain. Even the parking lot is beautiful and the place is very quiet. As for the dreaded construction noise reported upon by other reviewers, we did not hear any even though we could see the construction site about 1000 yards away. All we ever heard was the surf and the birds that wake you up in the morning. The beach is terrific, the open air lobby/atrium is very attractive, and the grounds are well-maintained. Our room was large with a mini-fridge, bath and separate shower, good beds and a clever interior louvered door arrangement that allows one to shut off the AC, open the sliding glass doors (close the screen doors!) and enjoy cross ventilation. One real pleasant surprise: in the lobby is the Cappuccino Cafe, which has to be the biggest food bargain on Maui. Good coffee, first rate pastries, pleasant staff and all at rock-bottom prices. Forget the $30 breakfasts for two elsewhere -- $7 for two here. OK, it comes in plastic and paper, but buy it and park yourself in comfy chairs in the lobby and enjoy your savings. Now for the bad (really semi-bad): the pool is relatively small and round with no shallow area, so it's not as functional as other resorts. However, the pool area is nice with cabanas (for those of us who are sun-averse), good chaise lounges and umbrellas, and food/bar service. Our room AC was dysfunctional even after a maintenance staff visit. The thermostat and fan had minds of their own. The good news -- we shut it off and were actually more comfy. Final negative -- the linens were not top-notch and the blankets were really heavy. Would I stay here again? At $200/night versus $500/night for other Wailea resorts -- absolutely. My wife thought that the pool was a deal-breaker.

<Title>“Totally Perfect!!”
<Content>OK People-Here are the facts of the Maui Prince Hotel--HEAVEN. My wife and I just got back from a five day Honeymoon stay at the Prince and have only GREAT things to say about our experience. Let's start from the beginning. The front desk and lobby are absolutely GORGEOUS. The entire Lobby area is an open air atrium with a koy pond, waterfall and beautiful garden. We were met at the front entrance by a very attentive valet, received a seashell lei, and were pleasently directed to the front desk. At registration we were informed that we had been upgraded to a full ocean view room (Thank's Expedia!) Our room was just off the elevator. Very convienent. Our room (418) was perfect in every way. Very large, spotlessly clean, huge bathroom with a seperate toilet area, refrigerator with FREE bottled water, soft robes, fantastic view of the Ocean, pool and golf course. No matter what words I write, they can't begin to accurately describe how wonderful our stay was. Please take the Molokini Snorkel Trip that is sold in the first floor office. At first I thought that the price tag was a bit steep (114.00), but the Catermaran picks you up right in front of the activity hut and the crew of the ship are friendly, knowledgable and funny. I saw none of the problems that some other reviewers complained about. The room was large, NOT outdated and exceptionally clean. The pool has plenty of lounge chairs, a full service bar and very personable bar tenders. No, the pool is not HUGE, but it was never even close to full capacity. If you need some type of extravagant pool, stay out of Hawaii and go to Orlando instead! The nice thing about having a "normal" size pool is.....NO KIDS! The management sent us up a very nice bottle of Champaign for our Honeymoon stay. The coffee in the coffee shop is $2.00 for a large size. The food in all the restaurants is well above average. I could go on and on, but I think you get my point. This was my first trip to Hawai'i, and I couldn't have been more satisfied.

<Title>“Love Makena and Prince is great value”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for 3 nights in mid-January, before our usual trip to the Big Island. For context, weâ€™ve stayed at the Prince several times previously, most recently in 2002. Weâ€™ve also stayed at the Grand Wailea and Four Seasons a few times each; we have also stayed in Kaanapali (Westin) a few times. We chose the Prince for this stay (despite the mixed reviews) because we love the location and itâ€™s very special to us and because weâ€™d heard the hotel was going to be demolished/renovated and we wanted to say goodbye. (I asked the desk staffâ€”they say the decision whether to renovate and upscale or demolish and build new will be made in the 2010 timeframe. Until then, it will continue to be managed by Prince Hotels.) Our room was deluxe ocean view on the 5th floor. The view of Puâ€™u Olaâ€™i, Molokini, and the Pacific was spectacular. With the lanai doors open a crack, the sound of the surf lulled us back to sleep in the morning; the sound of birdcalls reminds us that weâ€™re here in Makena again. We originally booked via the hotel for about $330 for a deluxe oceanview room. Then in December, we got a Prince Preferred email for â€œwinter escapeâ€� at $290 (same room) including a $100 resort credit. The Makena area is our favorite part of Maui. On the drive from the airport, we saw how much has changed and been added in the way of new shopping centers, stores, housing, vacation rentals. Wailea, although lovely, felt more like Scottsdale to me than Hawaii, despite the palm trees (they have them in AZ also). Once we were down on the lower road, there was no view of the sea, just gorgeous gated properties. We gave a sigh of relief and the â€œrelaxingâ€� part of the Maui stay began as we crossed into Makena. For now, at least, there is still kiawe along the road, and itâ€™s quiet. Although the outside of the structure show a few signs of wear (could use a repainting) the inside is clean and fresh after renovations. The hotel was built in the 1980s and has a minimalist, Japanese sensibility. The rooms are functional but not ornateâ€”no over-the-top marble baths, no luxurious furniture. The furniture is simple bamboo and light wood, Hawaii-style. The king bed was very comfortable, carpets fresh, paint spotless, bathroom immaculate. It does have the Japanese hand-held shower, which many find annoying; I actually find it convenient. Housekeeping once a day was thorough. The empty fridge had complimentary bottled water, replenished daily (a must in this hot and sunny area). There is construction at the south (Puâ€™u Olaâ€™i) side of the property. They did not work on the weekend; weekdays they start around 8 am. It was not overwhelmingly loud. We were away from the hotel for the afternoon, so I canâ€™t speak to what it would have been like if I wanted to doze by the pool. The pool area has shade (umbrellas, cabanas) and a pool bar/restaurant. We did not use them. We also did not dine at Hakone because it was only open for buffet night while we were there (we love the sushi made by Chef Ivan, but the trip timing did not work in our favor this time. The breakfast buffet was $23 and had a wide assortment of items hot and cold, American and Japanese. The mac nut waffles were excellent; service was friendly and efficient. The only downer was the very grubby/mildewed green plastic placemats in the outdoor seating. They have to get rid of those (to be balanced, my spouse did not notice!). All in all, it was a lovely and quiet stay in our favorite area of Maui. I think the Prince would be my recommendation for someone who wants a South Maui base of operations in a hotel with lovely grounds and a great beach, and where Maui (not a â€œdestination resortâ€�) is where he/she wants to be. It would also be a possibility for a repeat visitor who has experienced all the â€œattractionsâ€� and is tired of Kaanapali and the drive to and from the West Maui lodgings. The Maui Prince is very quietâ€”some say â€œdead.â€� Itâ€™s quiet and so for â€œnight lifeâ€� one must go elsewhere. For context, we ate at Capische? one night (see my review) and at Ferraroâ€™s and Spagoâ€™s the other two (reviews forthcoming). We stayed at the Prince and ate in high-end places every night for less than what a room alone at the Four Seasons would have costâ€¦since we donâ€™t spend much time in the hotels, this was a good choice for us. We love the Maui Prince. â€œUntil we meet again, thus sweet memories come back to me.â€�

<Title>“Perfect”
<Content>My wife and I celebrated our 30th anniversary on Maui, and we stayed 6 nights at the Maui Prince, 12/17-12/23. The Maui Prince was the perfect place. The grounds are beautiful; complimentary champagne on arrival for our anniversary; great view from our spacious, comfortable, simple but tastefully appointed prime oceanview room (544); one of the best beaches in Maui with a terrific reef to explore. Service was friendly and courteous. My wife and I both loved it. One of the unique items is a little 9 hole grass minature golf course, and a large practice green. The hotel provides putters and balls at the pool hut. There is also a croquet green. We were very happy with our experience at the Maui Prince.

<Title>“Not Bad.”
<Content>I think we must have gone during the quietest week of the year as none of the resturants or bars in the hotel were open after 9pm which was dissapointing resulting in us having to order room service on a couple of occasions. The hotel is impressive as you walk in to the lobby and the grounds and distance from the beach are great. The hotel itself needs a serious amout of cash spent on it though. The bathrooms especially are really dated bordering on 'grubby'. The room was a good size though with excellent views of the pool, golf course and beach. The sun sets right in front of you. Stunning. Location wise.......we ended up having to rent a car as the hotel is the last one on Wailea/Makena stretch and its a good hours walk to any of the resturants and shops etc. Not ideal. We probably wouldn't go back here mainly for the location and the fact that everytjing closed so early, although in the height of the season it may be different. The best thing was the champagne Sunday brunch. Well worth the $40 odd a head!! Be warned though, you will be drunk by 10.30am!!

<Title>“kamaaina review”
<Content>I'm a local resident of Oahu and decided to stay at the Maui Prince for 2 nights. The property is in an excellent location: Away from traffic and noise, all the rooms have a view of the ocean or partial view of the ocean, the rooms are spacious and clean, nice beach in front, friendly staff. We were given a free upgrade upon checkin too. This hotel is at the end of Makena after all the other resorts. It was about a 40 min drive from Kahului Airport. I loved the garden in the courtyard. It has a waterfall, native hawaiian plants, and a koi pond with a a little bridge. They have a lot of parking and valet or self parking was free! I really loved the fact that it's secluded so not overcrowded like Waikiki in Oahu. From our room the only sounds we heard were birds chirping, swaying of the trees, and the ocean waves. There's a luau on the hotel grounds at night - that was the only noise we heard actually. The lanai is huge - your whole family can sit out and enjoy the view and eat outside too. It was so relaxing!! The room wasn't new and luxurious- but it was clean and spacious and nothing major to complain about. However, I think they will need to update certain areas of the hotel. I didn't care for the Neutrogena toiletries. (you might want to bring your own toiletries) The carpet and the bed felt a little moist - could have been the A/C. The bathroom has an older feel - but it was clean and that's the main thing. Overall, we liked the property and would stay here again. It was such a relaxing getaway from Oahu. Mahalo to staff at the Maui Prince!

<Title>“Maui Prince December 2007”
<Content>The true test of a resort is how it manages a crisis. Rains caused power outages during this reviewed stay. Like a chorus, "I'm sorry" rang true from nearly all staff. Beyond power loss, no hot water, limited phone and internet service, and a restricted food menu antagonized guests. The emergency glow sticks placed resort wide to aid navigaing stairs made the stay rave reminicint. The absence of generators to power anything more than emergency lighting and credit card machines proved a fatal flaw in guest satisfaction. One test a critic (me) uses is as follows: I note an item needing attention. In this case, a glass with an inch of beverage left outside a room went unattended for three days. This was in clear view, and ignored while routine housekeeping duties were executed. This chain of resorts changed the Aveda personal care products to Nutragena, a step down to complain about. This is equivalant to renting a luxury car and getting a subcompact. The baseline of care has dropped, noting food quality, upkeep of the property and amenities, generally. While picturesque and beautiful, why go half way. Save your pennies and get a condo, or go full on and stay at the Four Seasons. A savvy visitor to Hawai'i must understand they are basically in another country with different ways. A resort must buffer some of the differences of expectations. Speedy service, low prices, and mainland expectations are thousands of miles away. "Island Time" is the excuse of laxidasical execution of duties, and must be tolerated. This resort is generally acceptable when the power is on, but even then, it is at best par with comperable resorts based on price.

<Title>“great place to get away”
<Content>We spent 4 days at the Maui Prince at the end of our 12 days in Maui. See separate review for outrigger in lahaina. Our stay at the prince was great. The only issue we had is well documented in other posts where the hotel is dated, but the room was clean and certainly served its purpose. The only issue was the plumbing made noise. We had no issues with mildew or odors in our room. The room was on the 5th floor on the north side and had wonderful views. The staff there was wonderful, when we checked in (at 11:00 AM) our room was not ready so I mentioned to the wife we should head to the golf course in the mean time, the gentleman that checked us in was on the phone with the golf course before we even said anything to him. Now that is service! The thing we found nice about the hotel is that they did not nickel and dime you for everything. No resort fee, free water in room, turn down service. The grounds were very well kept, as mentioned the pool area was small but the beach was great! We did not encounter any problems with the construction but this was over thanksgiving weekend so we were fortuneate as you can see the construction area is just adjacent to the pool and beach, and next to two holes on the south golf course. The area is great as the property is far south and by itself so if you are not into the crowds you avoid the crowds that can be found elsewhere on maui.

<Title>“Pedestrian”
<Content>This is a very average and aging resort which could use an extreme makeover. Room was not ready on arrival (2PM Hawaii time). Asked them to please rush as we were tired. Went down to the only place to eat for lunch at pool side!!!!! Were told that they would call us on our cellphones when room was ready. Needless to say we never received a call. Went back to the desk after lunch and had to complain and then received the room immediately. Sound of jackhammers from our Lanai starting at 7:30AM and lasting to the afternoon. Hotel said it had available WiFi that I purchased but it was essentially unusable from my room. Essentially worked well only in the lobby. Small pool with limited restaurant availability especially during the day.

<Title>“Perfect Laid Back Resort”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince Nov. 4 - Nov. 12. There is currently construction next door to the hotel, on the south side, which was noisy, however we didn't really see it as a problem. We were rarely in our room during construction hours, and while it would have been nice to not have the din of construction, this is one of those "what you make of it" things. The construction is not on the Prince property (according to the staff), but you can hear it from the beach in front of the hotel. Yes, the room decor is outdated, but the rooms are clean, the hotel is clean, and the staff is wonderful. The best part(s) of the room were the double front doors - there is an entryway just inside the solid front door and then a locking louvered inner door. You can prop your solid front door open, close your lovered door, and then open your large double lanai sliders for a delicious cross breeze through the room. The lanai was spacious, with an ocean view as well as a view of the luau on Tues. and Thurs. We watched the luau both nights from the lanai and ate in (or out, really, on the lanai). The rooms have a coffee maker and a mini fridge, which was perfect for snacks, sandwich fixings, and beverages. Dining options are limited, however there are restaurants about ten minutes away at the Shops at Wailea and Kihei is only about 15 minutes away, with more dining choices. The pool is small, so not a place for those looking for a hopping pool scene, however the beach is right there and is beautiful. The hotel supplies lounge chairs for guests and the KaiKanani snorkel boat loads and unloads from the beach. All in all, the Prince is a great oasis for regular folks not looking for a happening pool scene, obvious displays of money, or bodily perfection. For those looking for a laid back, friendly resort, south of everyone else, this is the place. Loved it and would go back again in a heartbeat!

<Title>“Dated but not that bad”
<Content>The rooms are dated like everyone says. However, they aren't that bad. I found the rooms to be nice and clean. The beach is nice. The pool was small. The hotel service was nice, friendly and accomadating. The downside of the Prince is there is very few choices for dining. If you just want a causal meal during the day you needed to eat at the pool bar. During the evening the only choice is their high end restaurant, which appearred not to get much activity. For breakfast if you wanted buffet you are at the right spot, however, if you just wanted something light you are out of luck. So you need to go into town which is a 15-20 minute drive. Our biggest gripe was our unfortnate timing with a World Championship competion being held at the hotel during our entire stay. They let us know at arrival that it will be noisy with loudspeakers, helicopters, celebrations etc, I just wish they would of told us when I was making my reservation!

<Title>“We enjoyed our stay!!”
<Content>My fiance and I recently came back from our 3-island Hawaiian trip. Maui was our last stop where we stayed 4 days and 3 nights. We booked the Prince Hotel in Makena based on tripadvisor reviews and ranks. The hotel was located in Makena which is pretty much the last stop on South Maui. Very isolated. But a wonderful and relaxing place. We arrived into Maui from the Big Island late afternoon and after driving about 30 minutes from the Kahuilui airport, we were greeted with shell leis and nice cold damp cloths to refresh our hands and faces. We proceeded to chill by the pool which is decent size. Pool side service was awesome. Great burgers. The beach was less than 5 minutes away. The Makena beach was a very nice beach but not great for snorkeling. Great sunset view. The front desk was always friendly. Our room wasn't exactly ocean view - as the hotel boasts that every room is an ocean view. We were facing the grounds which turned out in our favor since one night, we were treated to a free viewing of the hawaiian luau show (it occurs every Tues/Thurs only). The room was spacious. A plus for getting free two bottles of water each day in our room. The toilet is a separate room adjacent to the bathroom which was nice. We DEFINITELY did not encounter any construction noise during our stay there. Other pluses: after exploring Maui each day, a spin at the whirlpool hottub by the pool was nice (closes at 10PM daily); we also ate one night at Hakone inside the hotel (awesome sushi/sashimi place). If you're looking for a nice place to relax in Maui, the Maui Prince Hotel is great for the price you're paying (moderate $$). Also in terms of location, it may seem far but it's only an additional 30 minutes to Kahuilui (the central hub to where you want to go: ie. Lahaiina, Hana, Halealuka crater)

<Title>“A Pleasant Surprise in South Maui”
<Content>We spent 5 nights at the Maui Prince from Oct. 14-Oct. 19 and we loved it. We were a bit concerned after reading some of the negative reviews but we decided to give it a try. For the past few years we stayed at the Kea Lani but the prices have become outrageous so we booked the Maui Prince. The room we had at the Prince was larger than the room we had at the Four Seasons some years back but smaller than the suites at the Kea Lani but at half the price with an ocean view, we were satisfied. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted by name and I still don't know how they knew us by name since we arrived in a rental car. The entire staff was very friendly and Thomas, the bellman, was so helpful with restaurant tips and other suggestions that helped to make our stay so pleasant. Since we are snorkelers, the beach at the Maui prince was great and right by "Turtle Town" so there were plenty of turtles to be seen. The beach at the Prince is far better for snorkeling that the Kea Lani or Four Seasons. The furniture in the rooms was dated a bit but our room had new carpeting and fresh paint and we loved the large patio with the drying racks for our wet gear. The bathroom was dated but I loved the removable hand spray in the shower to rinse my scuba gear and the water pressure was fine. There was a safe in the closet and plenty of counter space for toiletries, etc. right outside the bathroom. We also liked the dual front doors with the tiled entry hall so you can open the patio door and close the louvered front door and still get the trade wind breezes, we did not need to use the A/C at night at all. Yes there is some construction noise on the south side of the hotel, so request the North wing if that bothers you. Since we spent most of the day out of the room, the noise was a minor inconvenience. We really loved the gardens and flowers/fauna on the bottom level along with the waterfall and koi pond. There were plants, flowers and trees we have never seen anywhere before and it made for some great photos. The Maui Prince has much more of a 'hawaiian flavor" than the Kea Lani or Four Seasons does. The pool was small but we never use the pool when we go on vacations, we use the beach/ocean. We tried the breakfast buffet and it was reasonably priced and had a nice variety of foods to choose from. I did some scuba diving with Shaka Divers and Doug sure knows the reefs around South Maui, I highly recommend Shaka Divers for some fun, safe diving. For great inexpensive lunches we went to Jawz Fish Tacos in Kihei. It was so good, we ate there 3 times. Fresh grilled Mahi Mahi, Ahi or Ono with cabbage, seasoned rice, sauce and a great selection of salsas and sauces, it was delicious, fast and inexpensive! For dinner we went to Roy's in Kihei, (excellent seafood, no view), Pacific'o in Lahaina (great food, great oceanfront setting) and Tommy Bahama's in Wailea (excellent fish, live mellow music). Oh and you must stop at Lappert's for ice cream or coconut sorbet. Overall we had a great trip and would recommend the Maui Prince in Makena for a great, reasonably priced hotel in the South Maui area. I think that Makena will be the next growth area since Wailea is getting overbuilt and already high priced. Get there before the developers do.

<Title>“Don't bother with this hotel”
<Content>We chose to stay at the Maui Prince hotel for our Honeymoon this October. We had already been to the Prince property on the Big Island (Hapuna Prince, where we were married), and were so pleased with that experience, I expected the same type of accommodations and experience at the Maui Prince... I was wrong. Saying the rooms are dated is an UNDERSTATMENT. The bathrooms are atrocious. Shower-tubs with shower curtains, cheap early 80's beige tiles, and those horrible removable shower heads that offer no pressure whatsoever. They boast ocean-views from every room... that is true, except we had to lean ALL THE WAY over our Lanai to see the Ocean... what we saw were primarily trees. The grounds of the hotel were nice, and the ponds were lovely to look at; but since you really don't want to spend too much time IN the common areas of the hotel, it doesn't make for much of a difference. While the beach was decent (snorkeling was just okay; you have to swim out pretty far to see anything of interest), the pool was horrible. I think our pool at home was larger. As far as the clubhouse is concerned, it is not within easy walking distance... you need to take a shuttle. The food there was greasy and unappealing. The hotel restaurants were okay, but given the price, I would have expected more (yes, I know food is expensive on the Islands, but you are better off going to the shops at Wailea for food). Soup was delivered cold, and service was slow. Yes, there is considerable construction noise. The plus side of not having a room with a better ocean view was that we were further from the construction site, but when on the beach, you hear it... all day long. There is no mention of that when making your reservations. Also, our room backed into their service delivery alley. So, at night and in the morning, you can hear the trash being picked up and taken away (also, bottle breaking, vehicles backing up, etc.) While I was not their on business, I did need to use a computer to check in for our return flight home; no business center. Only two computer terminals for the whole hotel, and they charge you a ridiculous $15.00 for 8 min of use; the printer didn't even work, and the concierge was clueless as to how to fix it. Staff were relatively friendly, but when complaints were made, all that we received were apologies... no action. In hindsight, I would have much rather stayed in Kaanapali or somewhere else in Wailea. I consider this property to be an embarrassment to the Prince name. My recommendation is for the Hapuna Prince on the Big Island, but to avoid the Maui Prince all together; you will find your money better spent at another location. I have been in newer hospitals that have better decor and more up to date facilities than this location.

<Title>“We LOVED it!!!!!”
<Content>Just returned from a 7 day stay at the Maui Prince Hotel. We loved it. Our room was 546 on the north side. The last 2 reviews complained of construction noise??? I never experienced anything of the sort. The room was beautiful and clean. When I travel I usually stay at Westin or Marriott, so it is comparable to those. The beds are "Heavenly". The view was spectacular from our room, too bad we were not there during whale watching season, because you could see them while laying in bed. The Lanai was my favorite place! The geckos came every night as soon as we turned on the lights in our room, and that's a good thing because they eat any bugs that might stray by. It's a wonderful place to just sit or have a romantic dinner or breakfast. You wil spend alot of time out there. The hotel is a wonderful, beautiful, quiet, contimplative space. If you have little ones, I would suggest another resort. Somewhere with a larger pool and slides. This is an Adult's retreat. Sublime. The beach is lovely and the snorkeling is great right in front of the hotel. Try the clubhouse restaurant at the golf course for lunch, great food and reasonable prices. We will definitely return, just as soon as possible. D & B

<Title>“Construction site next to the hotel”
<Content>Prince Maui Hotel is the last hotel on the Wailea resort strip but there is a construction site next to the hotel. It is noisy and the noise could be heard from the room that we had and more importantly, it could heard at the pool and at the beach. After one night, we contacted our travel agent for re-location since the purpose of our trip was to relax. We relocated to Kaanapali beach which we were happier with (better beach and no constructions nearby). Prince Maui Hotel was clean but with slightly old fashion decor. We wanted to eat after the restaurant had closed, saw the room service prices which were too expensive to us so we got in the car and drove up the road to find a restaruant. The hotel offers free parking. The pool is on the smaller side.

<Title>“Beautiful Experience”
<Content>We recently stayed at the Maui Prince and we loved every minute of it. The surroundings were gorgeous, it was so quiet and peaceful and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was great. The bed, very comfortable, I've never slept better. It was nice to get re-stocked with bottled water in the refrigerator every day. The view was incredible! I would wake up between 5 and 6 everyday to stand on the balcony and just to take it all in. The beach front was marvelous. Just a short walk and you were there. Snorkeling right off the beach was amazing! We were able to see a green sea turtle right off the beach. The fish were numerous. We loved the Maui Prince and would love to return there someday. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a quiet, peaceful, relaxing get-away with that special someone!!

<Title>“Nice if You Want Seclusion”
<Content>I stayed here for 3 nights as a side trip after completing some business travel on Oahu around the middle of September. The hotel is nice in many ways. The atrium has a beautiful fishpond and lovely little waterfall. The grounds are beautiful, with golf courses and walking paths nicely laid out and very convenient. The rooms are big and have a lovely view of the grounds and ocean from nearly every room (see attached photo of the view from my room on the first floor). Very good customer service as well, all of the staff were very helpful, knowledgeable and polite. The beach here is beautiful and as some have already mentioned offers decent snorkeling at times. Beds are very comfortable and the soundproofing is good (did not hear a peep from the folks in the next rooms). There are a few downsides as well. The decor in the rooms is very dated and not very well maintained. All of the furniture looked like it had been around and was used and abused quite a bit. The swimming pool is small and can get a bit crowded. The restaurants are very expensive for what they serve, you are much better off going into Kihei to find food. The last thing is the location, this is as far as you can go South other than Mekana Beach Park (Big Beach), or the long road to la Perouse Bay. So, if you plan on venturing up Haleakela or driving out to Hana, or golfing at Kapalua, or going to a luau in Lahaina you have a mighty long drive. Of course, if you plan your day trips, and manage to take a change of clothes with you, you can work around that problem to some degree. Bottom line, if you do not mind not having the very nicest touches to your room, but appreciate the nice layout and extra space, and if you do not mind driving a bit to get around (or you want the seclusion), then this is a great place. I would probably go back if I had the time to spend just chillin' on the beach. This would also be a great place if you just wanted to hang out and play golf for a few days. I would recommend this hotel keeping in mind the few caveats mentioned above.

<Title>“A nice place, a great location, a beautiful island getaway”
<Content>Having gotten married a year ago at the Prince Hapuna Beach hotel we decided to try the island of Maui and the Prince hotel this year for a trip that combined my wife's birthday with our first anniversary. We'd read some less than complimentary things about the Maui Prince prior to the trip and I'll admit I had some concerns but we were going with her parents and took advantage of the hotels two rooms for the price of one special which brought the cost per room down around $225/night per room. At that price its by far the cheapest hotel in Wailea. When we arrived at the hotel we were very pleasantly surprised. The greeting was very similar to that at the Hapuna Beach. The cold towels are refreshing after spending hours on the plane and then juggling luggage and carryons thru the airport and rental cars. We had arrived early before main checkin but that gave us time to put in our request for a room on the 2nd floor. We were hungry so we headed to the pool bar and had a drink and a snack while we waited for our rooms to be ready. They called our cell phone later to let us know our rooms were ready and we were pleased with them both. We'd read that the rooms were a bit smaller as you went higher and later on we were able to confirm that by looking into a couple. Its not a huge difference but it was enough to be noticable. As you go higher you're trading off a little room size and distance to the ocean for a slightly better view. I didn't think it would be worthwhile since I like to be able to hear the ocean and we appreciated the extra square footage since we were there for a full week. We had "oceanview prime" rooms (#236 & 238 non-adjoining). From there we had a great view to the beach and could watch the snorkel boat coming and going each morning and afternoon. and a fantastic view out to Molokini. The rooms were very pleasant. I'll admit the decor may be slightly dated but it didn't detract from our ability to enjoy anything and we found it comfortable. Why come all the way to Maui if you're going to sit in your hotel room?? At sunset the more distant islands came more into view and the sunsets were stunning. I've posted a few pics of the rooms and the view. The hotel pools were nice and pleasantly warm. The bar at the pool was nice and we spent a good bit of time out there during the trip. Getting to know the bartenders is a great way to get info on the things to do or not do. Lucky (yes that's his name) the bartender was a wealth of info and was very helpful. He also pours a great mai tai!!! The beach was great and the snorkeling right there was good. There's a reef that runs off the left side of the beach and goes out quite a way. It has lots of little reef fish and the occasional turtle pops up as well...all for free right there at the hotel. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurants much other than one lunch/snack and one breakfast. The buffet breakfast was excellent and on par with what we had at the Hapuna last year and quite reasonable, though I wouldn't shell out the $50 for the Sunday brunch. To us, breakfast just isn't worth that much. I will also say that I thought the prices for dinner at the hotel restaurants were quite high, averaging $50 per person before drinks and tip. Instead we drove into Wailea or Kihei for dinner most nights. My mother in law from Texas particularly liked Fred's Mexican Cafe in Kihei. The complimentary valet parking was very handy. My wife's father is an avid SCUBA diver and he arranged a dive trip almost every day that we were there. Being able to just drive up and unload the car at the front and have someone else park was very nice and well worth the couple of bucks per trip in tips. The hotel staff was excellent. I'd called and let them know in advance that this trip was for our anniverary and my wife's birthday. When we came back to the hotel on our 2nd night they had given us a complimentary bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries. It was a very nice touch! For my wife's birthday I called the concierage and arrange for some flowers to be delivered. It was all taken care of and delivered by the hotel staff on her birthday evening. Again...very nicely done! Overall I'd say the hotel is very nice, the staff was great and the location is fantastic. I wouldn't pay $450/night for it, but in relation to the prices at the other nearby hotels that's actually not insanely out of sight. If you're looking for a hotel that's comparable to the Fairmont or the Grand Wailea then this isn't the hotel for you. If you're looking for a nice, quality hotel with resort style amenities this is a good place without having to pay $500-$800/per night. I'd certainly come back and stay here again!

<Title>“Great hotel & Staff but where did all the other tourists go ?”
<Content>Stayed here for 7 days during our honeymoon from 30.8.07. Great hotel, very beautiful surroundings and garden, nice beach, not private but could be as its seclusion, room was good quality but maybe a bit dated, but we were happy with it, comfy bed etc etc. We were unsure of getting a hire car for our stay but did in the end, this is aa must for this hotel as its almost the last hotel heading away from civilisation in makena, This is a big hotel but we did not see many other guests, in the evenings there did not seem to be anyone about so we felt we may have been missing out on something. The Princes court restauant buffet was brilliant, loads of local catches and traditional food, well worth a visit. Would we stay here again, no, because of how quiet it was and how far away from life it was, we would next time look for a 4 star hotel in kaanaplai (there seemed to be more life there)

<Title>“Loved It”
<Content>After reading some reviews about the hotel I had a very uneasy feeling about it but i still booked it. Well to my surprise as we arrived the staff welcomed us warmly (the outside of the hotel is nice it isnt the hilton or the ritz but its nice) and even though we had arrived early (check in time at 3pm) they held our luggage while they finished up the room we were going to stay in and we had drinks at the pool side bar(drinks arent the best on the island but they are decent, we thought the food was too pricy so we neve ate there) they took about 30 or so mins to get everything set up. As we walked to our room (they said they had upgraded us) we had a great view of the mountains and then we entered the room, I expected to see a run down hotel almost motel style (beacuse of some reviews i had read) but it was nothing like that, yes like others have said the furniture isnt brand spanking new but its clean and comfortable, Im very picky about rooms and this room met all of my expectations. The bathroom was a good size with a nice good size tube and we had a dressing area, a small table by the bed to have snacks and dinner on and a very good size patio with a table. Our view was the best, we had partial ocean view and partial mountain view which was perfect, I didnt know which i like best the view of the mountains or the view of the ocean. Our room was directly in front of the area where they have the lua and we were able to see it a few nights when we were there which was nice no need to leave our room for a show. I really enjoyed my stay there and recommend to anyone, the beach is nice and calm with not too many people around.

<Title>“1970's Style Beach Resort”
<Content>After spending a wonderful night at the Westin Kanapali about an hour north of Wailea, we were dissapointed as we entered the property of the Prince. If you feel llike travelling back in time, I would suggest staying at this very dated beach "resort" The decor has a flair for faded palm tree print and the beds are far from luxury and the pool was literally a tiny circular swimming hole. Definitely not something that you want to spend all day lounging and relaxing in this atmosphere. We were afraid to dine at their restaraunts, only because everything else felt like it was 30 years old (30 year old sushi? No thanks.) On the plus side, the rooms are very large with nice big balconies (make sure you get a higher floor with an ocean view). The resort does have a small beach with great snorkeling right on the property (rent your equipment offsite, like Snorkel Bobs in Kehei...it's $9.00 an hour from the Prince). The resort is seculded if you are looking for an escape, and it is very close to wonderful golfing and a tennis club. Valet parking is free and they don't charge an outrageous "resort fee" like most other hotels on the island. The staff was friendly and curteous, we were there in off season, so by the end of the week they knew our names. An average rating, not what you'd expect if you are paying upwards of $300-$400 a night.

<Title>“Lovely stay at the Maui Prince”
<Content>My husband and I had stayed at the Maui Prince August 30-September 2, 2007 to celebrate our anniversary. We had booked a prime ocean view room and the view was just gorgeous. We had the top floor, room 526. The room was clean and very spacious. The lanai was large with good outdoor furniture which included a drying rack (good for drying dive equipment)! We enjoyed the pool bar and the Molinkini Lounge. All staff were very professional and friendly. Big Beach is within walking distance of the hotel. The Maui Prince has beautiful and lush gardens to enjoy. We will most definitely return.

<Title>“Fantastic experience at Maui Prince - can't wait to go back!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Maui Prince resort for our honeymoon in July 2006 and had a wonderful experience. We can't wait to go back! Upon arrival, we received a room upgrade without even making a request. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating. Champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries were delivered to our room on the first night of our stay (this was part of a package that we had signed up for when booking the room). I have read the many comments on this website about dated rooms. While I agree that the decor was not in the "modern" style, I felt that the rooms and all areas of the hotel were decorated tastefully and, more importantly, everything was very clean and well-kept. Cleanliness and friendly service are much more important to me than modern decor. Our room had a lovely view of the ocean (I have posted a picture to illustrate). We loved having kona coffee (provided by the hotel) on our lanai every morning. The room also included a small refrigerator and a safe. We found both of these amenities very useful. The bathroom was not a huge modern hotel bathroom, but it was very clean and thoroughly functional. We had no complaints. We also liked the fact that there was a door separating the toilet from the main bathroom area. I have read the complaints about the pool (again, picture has been posted). I have to agree with the reviewers who have commented that they come to Hawaii for the beaches and not the pools. I feel the same way. But although the pool is small, again, the pool and surrounding areas were very clean and well kept. We lounged in one of the cabanas for a bit one afternoon and had a very quiet and relaxing time. The beach at the Maui Prince could not be beat though (picture has been posted). The beach is lovely and, perhaps because it is further away from the main resort areas, it is not a high traffic area. Most of the time we found that there were only a handful of people on the beach and at times we had the whole beach to ourselves. If you like your beaches crowded and busy, this is not the place for you. But if you like a nice quiet beach where you can lay out, relax, and listen to the sound of the waves, you will love this place. We also found some other nice secluded beaches very near the Maui Prince, as well as a couple of great snorkeling spots, thanks to our Lonely Planet guidebook. My only slight complaints about the Maui Prince involve dining. First, at least the week that we were there, the 2 restaurants onsite seemed to have really irregular hours. In fact, a couple of the days they werenâ€™t even open at all. The bar food was alright, but nothing special. And since the Maui Prince is at least a short drive from other dining options, it would be nice if they offered a few more in-house options. Second, the bird situation at the breakfast buffet. The breakfast buffet itself is fantastic â€“ the food is great (I still salivate remembering the Belgian waffle bar). The setting is lovely with most seating being outdoors overlooking nicely landscaped ponds. However, the number of birds that stalk this dining area at times bordered on the comical. And at times it made me think about bird flu. These birds are not shy of people at all. Above all, do not leave your food unattended to go back for a refill on juice. I canâ€™t tell you the number of times I saw someone go back to the buffet for something only to watch at least 1 or 2 birds pounce on that personâ€™s plate the moment they left the table. Overall, we absolutely loved our experience at the Maui Prince. It was fantastic value for money. This resort is not for those who are looking for lots of action and crowds, but if you are looking to relax in a friendly atmosphere of peace and quiet while soaking up some of that Hawaiian sun, the Maui Prince absolutely canâ€™t be beat.

<Title>“Loved the Maui Prince”
<Content>We loved the Prince entirely - great beach, friendly staff, breakfast buffet was excellent with lots of selections and very fresh fruit. I didn't find the room dated - maybe some have been rehabbed? very modern Japanese style decor. Hotel was very quiet. Partial ocean view and lanai were lovely. Now we did come from a hideous b and b (spyglass house, avoid) so we were prepared to be delighted, but honestly the only complaint that I have is that the a/c in the bar where we ate two dinners (late night after driving road to Hana, and just plain tired the other day) was too cold. nice music tho, and pizza and spring rolls both quite good. we called in on day of arrival (having fled the b and b) and got a great rate - about half the rack rate - if you are spur of the moment types, worth a chance

<Title>“Perfect Maui Vacation”
<Content>Our week at the Maui Prince this summer was wonderful. We found nothing negative at all! Some past reviews were nit-picky, but everything was delightful from our wonderful room which was upgraded (514) to the impeccable service (couldn't be friendlier), the grounds which are breathtaking, the beach which was lovely. Yes, it's been sold but nothing will change for the next few years and we plan to keep coming back. Oh, and the silly looking shower? It works just fine...just needs some getting used to. We've been going to Maui for years and have even owned a condo in Wailea, but this was the best experience ever. Our breakfast by the koi pond every morning was just the perfect way to start the day. Also, room service by mainland standards was reasonable. We rarely left the hotel...why would you want to? This is really a gem in the midst of Wailea's "hotel row." The other complaints (decor) are hardly worth mentioning. It's kind of like Hawaii: corny, charming and utterly delightful!

<Title>“Honeymooners Beware”
<Content>I'm not a picky person, but considering that you only get one honeymoon, I would have appreciated a little more fanfare from the staff. Nobody seemed to care all that much that we were just married. We even had a beef with one of the pool waitresses, who created a terribly awkward cabana situation with us and another family. We spoke with a manager and all he gave us was a scripted apology. Service gets a big fat zero. We were hoping for a more adult atmosphere as well. To our surprise, there were definitely more families than couples staying at the resort, which was a disappointment. On a positive note, the food was excellent. I highly recommend the Saturday night Japanese buffet and the fish tacos at the pool. Enough has been said regarding the rooms and the pool, and I couldn't agree more. I would not consider this to be a 4-star property by any stretch of the imagination, and I definitely would not recommend it if you're planning a honeymoon.

<Title>“terrific beach”
<Content>Before I booked the Maui Prince I took a lot of time weighing my options and reading reviews. Overall the reviews here really helped, as there were no surprises when we got to the Maui Prince last week. The hotel is dated, and the pool area is somewhat bleak (no problem getting a chair or even a free cabana here) -- but the beach is fantastic and the hotel staff really excellent (they couldn't be nicer). And our room was always very clean. We did a lot of snorkeling there last week, and saw turtles every day we went out and great fish, right from the hotel beach. The snorkel boats stop there (one leaves from there), but it's an easy swim out to where the boats and kayaks stop to see the turtles. I think this is one of the best hotel snorkel spots on the island -- it's not as crowded as Black Rock at the Sheraton in Kanapali, and much prettier. I like to be on the beach in Hawaii, as I feel we don't have to fly to Hawaii to sit by a pool. So the state of the pool didn't bother me. If you're looking for lots of activity, with people sitting elbow to elbow on beach chairs jammed around a busy pool which you have to fight for early in the day, like so many of the hotels in Hawaii, this isn't the place. As for restaurants, I read some recommendations here for Matteo's, which we loved. It was well priced, delicious Italian food -- so good, we went there twice. I also read recommendations for Da Kitchen, and went there -- and thought it was horrible; loud, greasy and disgusting. Though the grounds are amazing, the hotel does lack a nice outdoor place to sit, eat or have a drink and look out at the ocean. Nevertheless, we truly enjoyed our time at the Prince!

<Title>“Maui Prince Great Hotel”
<Content>We spent our honeymoon at the Prince (July 21st- July 28th) and completely loved the hotel. The staff was very friendly and the room, although a little outdated, was large and very comfortable! We enjoyed sitting outside eating the breakfast buffet with a view of the fish pond and birds. The pool is a little small, but we enjoyed it very much! Diane at the Activity Desk was extremely helpful in helping us book our activities around the island! We really enjoyed attending the luaua at the Prince! The landscape and beach are awsome and it was a very peacful and relaxing place to stay! The sunsets from the beach will be remembered forever!! It was hard to get back to work at [-] since we were so relaxed. My wife and I will definitely stay there again and cannot wait to get back to Maui!! (Mark from Louisiana)

<Title>“We loved it!”
<Content>I too was hesitant about the Prince based upon the other reviews. I guess that the experience at the site is uneven. Unlike the previous poster, our room was immaculate. No smells, no mildew, which is a deal breaker for me. (I'll write about mildew in my report on the Hilton Waikoloa). The room was dated but clean. The carpet seemed much newer than anything else in the room. The property certainly needs updating and I hope that the new owners have some plans in place to bring it into *this* century. That said, our room was spotless. Our housekeeper even left us a thank you note every day for her tip. That was a first! We stayed in room 560 which was an upgraded ocean view room (we were here on a Priceline booking). The lanai was huge and had a beautiful view of the palm trees, the ocean, and the coastline of west Maui. I joined the Prince Preferred Club and called ahead to request a king bed, and not only did we receive an upgrade, they even sent up a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our anniversary. It was a nice touch. The staff on a whole was outstanding. They made us feel like welcome guests. The best feature of the Price was their outdoor property. The grounds are lovely, and their beach access is wonderful. I can't comment on the pools because we never used them. The snorkeling off of the beach was pretty good (not quite as good as the snorkeling off of Black Rock), and we enjoyed the Molokini sail on the Kai Kanani that left right from the beach. That was a huge timesaver to leave from the beach instead of one of the harbors. The Kai Kanani also took us to a place about 100 yards off the beach where we saw about 8 turtles. It would be a bit of a swim, but is doable from the beach in front of the Prince. They had a shuttle that took us up to the Shops at Wailea. It was efficient and free. Valet parking was also efficient and free. All that you have to do is tip the staff as opposed to the Hilton which charged $16.50 for valet and $9.50 for self parking! We would definitely stay here again, primarily because we liked the location and the warmth of the staff. The dated room didn't bother me nearly as much as I thought it would.

<Title>“A great way to start our honeymoon!”
<Content>After being greeted by friendly gentlemen with the valet, we walked into a beautiful front desk and lounge. The garden was lovely to stroll through. As we walked to our room we were pleased with our view of the mountain and hawaiian plant life. Upon arrival to room we found a comfortable bed, clean bathroom, and a beautiful partial ocean view from our balcony. One of our favorite parts of our stay was the beach, beautiful, and calm enough to swim in without being worried about being hit by a huge wave. The turtles in this area were wonderful to see, however we did have to snorkel out rather far, so I suggest wearing one of the little "snorkel floaters" you can rent. I would suggest renting snorkel gear elsewhere. The snorkel gear at Maui Prince is good quality, however it is VERY overpriced, it hurts me to remember that I paid that much! But the convenience was nearly worth the price! My husband and I loved the peaceful location, we enjoyed the privacy of the area. The drive to Luaus and shopping is at least an hour, however if you rent a convertible, the drive is almost as fun as the destination! The restaurants in the area made us feel welcome. Matteos is a tasty place to eat!! I realize they are a pizzeria, but I would go back to eat there today! Maui Prince was the perfect place to start our honeymoon, we did not have a single problem with them. :::sigh::: If only we could return this year..... =o)

<Title>“Great Property, Great Staff”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Maui Prince near the 4th of July. I was somewhat anxious given other reviews, but this property exceeded expectations. Our oceanfront room had a beautiful view. The room and the balcony were spacious and clean. The staff was efficient and cordial. The valet parking was particularly amazing. Over three days, our car was ALWAYs waiting for us when we called on our way down. My husband did not want to leave!

<Title>“Relaxation at it's best!”
<Content>My wife and I had been to this resort before for our honeymoon back in 2005. We decided to stay here again because of the incredible experience we had then. We stayed in an ocean front room (#532)....what an absolute gorgeous view each morning and night!!!! The beach was amazing and not crowded at all...I think a lot of people chose to drive the small distance down the road to "Big Beach", which was fine with me. The pool was small, but we don't have children (yet) and smaller pools tend to weed out the young ones. I can't say enough about their food. All the meals are prepared by the Prince Court staff, so if you have been to the Prince for Sunday Brunch...that's the food you will enjoy everyday for every meal. My only complaint is that I am very heat sensitive and the A/C is not powerful enough...think they need more coolant. The staff always had a smile on their face and were very accomodating and eager to help with anything we needed. I highly recommend this resort to anyone who wants to relax. If you want the party scene go to the Hyatt.

The food was delicious and the view from the rooms were breathtaking. I also recommend going to the luau, it was fantastic. I definitely recommend the Maui Prince Hotel.

<Title>“Maui Prince - excellent”
<Content>I have never written a review of any travel experience before; however, I believe the courtesy and excellent service extended by this hotel should be shared; as well as our experience at this wonderful hotel, as a whole. We had just found flown into Maui and found out, when we picked up our rental car, that the road to Lahaina was closed due to a brush fire. We immediately phoned the hotel in Kaanapali (one of the large ones- which will remain unnamed) where we had been originally booked to stay. We asked for referrals to other hotels under the circumstances and they gave us no information. So, we were essentially - on our own. After trying several hotels in Kihei and Wailea which were booked because of the fire created chaos; and, finding that other hotels that still had rooms were extorting high room fees because they realized people had no choice -- we stumbled upon Maui Prince. What an incredible relief! The atmosphere was extremely relaxed and beautiful. Rather than overcharging, they stated that they understood the predicament of the people caught in the fires and gave us a special rate. The grounds are beautiful. It was like a Zen type atmosphere. The food was great. All of the employees showed extreme courtesy. I highly recommend the Maui Prince Hotel.

<Title>“Great Beach, Nice People, Watch the Food”
<Content>The beach at this hotel is not so busy (at least in July) and the staff is quite friendly and accommodating. The rooms are a bit musky. You'll find that the hotel itself is do-able, but it isn't the best out there. Don't let those appearances dissuade you from the beach, the friendly service, and the wonderful drinks. The food in the hotel is not the greatest. We were served a not so great piece of fish. It wasn't right. Our server corrected the problem, but merely took the meal away and took it off our tab. Most quality restaurants at that price would do more. I think that they just got overwhelmed when a big party came in and weren't at their best. Didn't check out their Luau- went off campus for meals after the aforementioned problem happened. The concierge was gracious in arranging alternatives.

<Title>“Hidden Paradise!”
<Content>We got this hotel thru bidding on priceline and could not have been any happier! It was just beautiful! The grounds, the private beach, the service, everything was amazing, just a perfect honeymoon! I wasn't impressed with the pool, but that didn't bother us as we were enjoying the beach everyday anyway. There's a small group of rocks upfront near the center of the beach that homes lots of huge green seaturtles. I couldn't believe how close we got to them, not allowed to touch them though. Alos, you will need to rent a car as this hotel is at the very end of the "Hotel Zone".

<Title>“Some tips if you're going to the Maui Prince Hotel”
<Content>I felt I had to write something about this hotel after seeing what other people have said. First of all, I love nice hotels and have been lucky enough to have stayed in some of the most amazing hotels in the world. That said, the Maui Prince Hotel is not one of those, but it is good enough. The beach is, however, one of the most beautiful and pristine I've ever been on. And, you can't beat the location. It's quiet and private and a reminiscent of "old Hawaii." Here are some tips to make your stay more enjoyable: -- Do not expect fancy rooms. They are dated, worn down and in dire need of renovation. -- Try to get a room as close to the ocean as possible, as those have the best views. -- Have housekeeping shampoo your carpets BEFORE you arrive. --Have housekeeping switch their standard pillows with feather ones. -- There are mini-fridges in the rooms. Stock those with waters and whatever else you may need. -- The daily buffet brunch is great! -- Rent a car.

<Title>“The Maui Prince is in a fantastic location on Maui!”
<Content>Stayed at the Maui Prince for 3 nights in early July 2007 and thoroughly enjoyed it! I think the overall vibe I got from reading the many TripAdvisor reviews about this place before going to Maui is dead-on: the vast majority of people will love the Maui Prince but there will be a minority of guests who will feel somewhat disappointed with the actual rooms. But before I get to that, let me start from the beginning - you're greeted at check-in with a lemon-scented cold face towel by the front desk staff. After sitting on an airplane, sweating through baggage claim and getting the rental car, nothing puts you in the "Aloha" spirit faster. The front desk were able to accomodate our request for an early check-in without a problem. They even called us while we were eating lunch to let us know our room was ready. I thought that was a bit of extra effort on the staff's part to make things more convenient for us. That kind of consideration from the staff was evident throughout our stay. Every single hotel employee we encountered was friendly, cheerful, helpful and professional. Obviously this hotel puts a premium on customer service and satisfaction. I liked how the Maui Prince provided plenty of amenities without "nickel & diming" you for them - ie they provide a free shuttle van to and from the hotel and the Wailea area. There's free internet access in the lobby. Water bottles in the room fridge that they'll replendish daily for us. Free valet parking - although we used the self parking lot since it was only another 100 yards from the front of the hotel. There's also a decent sized convenience store in the hotel lobby area with plenty of gift ideas, sundry items, snack food and drinks (yes, alcohol too). Prices were quite reasonable. The hotel beach was quite nice - and there's excellent snorkeling right off the shore. If you're really into snorkeling, there's plenty of excellent places in nearby Makena Beach and La Perouse Bay. We did a sea kayak / snorkel trip one morning and snorkeled in 3 different spots, all pretty much within half a mile of the hotel's property. Lots of sea turtles! (We used Maui Eco Tours, and would highly recommend them!) If you are a golfer, the hotel's two 18 hole courses are among the best in Maui. The North course is more up in the hills than the South course, which hugs the coastline. The North is narrower, and tougher to play if you're not accurate with your tee shots, but the payoff for playing that course is a view on many holes that is mind-blowing - 180 degrees panoramic views of the ocean, Kahoolawe, Molokini crater, and Lanai. Absolutely beautiful setting. Just remember that every putt breaks towards the ocean, no matter what your eyes are telling you! The South course has the same view, but not from an elevated viewpoint. Also a beautiful course. The 15th is beautiful par-3 that you play towards the ocean, and the 16th plays right along the ocean. I also played at Wailea Gold Course, and while Wailea's pro shop and SeaWatch restaurant blows away the Makena clubhouse and proshop, I much preferred the Makena golf courses for their overall conditioning, challenge and greens. Final note on golf - if you've ever played in Maui, you've probably been hammered by the trade winds that kick up in the afternoon. Playing in Makena / Wailea is different since Haleakala blocks much of the wind. Forget Kaanapali and $300 rounds @ Kapalua - play golf in south Maui! After reading some reviews, we tried the sunday brunch @ the Prince Court in the Maui Prince. Pricey @ $43 pp, but it was delicious! I recommend it. Didn't eat anywhere else in the hotel. As for the rooms, we stayed on the third floor, on the south side as some other reviewers suggested. The room was plenty big for us, although the little coffee table area felt somewhat squeezed in between the bed and the balcony. I believe the 1st and 2nd floors have a bigger floorplan, so they probably don't have that problem. I guess the decor can be viewed as outdated, but we found our room to be very clean, and designed with a simple, uncluttered aesthetic. The common hotel grounds are quite lovely with koi ponds and large well manicured grass areas to walk around in. Finally, the location of the Maui Prince deserves some comment. It is literally the last hotel on the southern part of Maui. The mega-resorts and shopping in Wailea are not even a 5 minute drive away, but once you're out by the Maui Prince, it's wonderfully peaceful, serene and quiet. There are no other hotels or condos in sight. Just nature, with the sound of the surf crashing in the background. If you want glitz, posh luxury, a hopping pool-scene, and night life, then Makena & Maui Prince is not for you. If you want a resort setting without any attitude (besides friendly), and if you like being "outdoorsy" (playing in the ocean, snorkeling, kayaking, golf) vs just lounging by a pool, then the Maui Prince is for you. If I came back to Maui, I would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Worst Hotel Ever”
<Content>My stay at the Maui Prince lasted a total of 10 minutes. My husband and I checked in, walked around the room, and checked out. The hotel was terrible. It stunk and it was very out-dated. I would compare it to a 2 star Holiday Inn in a small town. When we decided to check out, we called other hotels in Maui and found rooms close to the Maui Prince rate. We only stayed here because we won our bid on Priceline. The staff at the Maui Prince was nice enough to not charge Priceline, which should enable us to get a refund.

<Title>“Best Vacation Ever!”
<Content>My wife and I had a wonderful time at the Maui Prince. Maluaka Beach had a spectacular view of the West Maui Mountains, Molokini, and a 360 foot cinder cone. The crystal blue water was very swimmable, especially in the morning. Also, the beach was never crowded; at times we felt as if it was ours alone. The staff at the Maui Prince was great. The breakfast buffet was also good (load up on pineapple and bacon!) Feed the koi at the Prince's koi pond. They will eat from your hand and you can pet them like dogs! The drive to the top of Haleakala was a bit nerve-racking but incredible. THE event of our trip was the Road to Hana. The views along the drive were like nothing we'd ever seen or even imagined: lush, green rain forest surrounded by black sand beaches and insanely blue ocean vistas. You will see bamboo forests, plants and flowers you have never seen before. Taking in all of the island's beauty was at times almost overwhelming. Other highlights: Old Lahaina Luau, Iao Valley, snorkeling along Maluaka Beach, the view and windsurfers at Ho'okipa Beach. Best food: Bada Bing in Kihei and Milagros (get the blackened salmon sandwich) in Pa'ia. Sure, the Maui Prince could use some touching up; some decorations were a little outdated and wood paneling made it feel like it was 1983. Believe me, this was minor. The hotel was great and the location can't be beat. Just wish we were there right now.

<Title>“Paradise”
<Content>The Maui Prince Resort in Makena was better than expected, because the pictures on the web site just don't do it justice. We were treaded like royalty from the moment we arrived. There is free Valet Parking, bell service that is excellent, a nice cold damp wash cloth at the front desk upon check-in to freshen up. We were in an ocean front room on the 4th floor that had the most incredible view! Don't wast a lot of time booking snorkeling trips while staying at this resort, because some of the best snorkeling is about 100 yards straight out from the beach. There is actually a turtle cleaning station just off shore that the snorkel companies to every day that you can swim out to. The pool is small, but with the ocean just yards away, it's not very crowded. The pool Grille serves great lunches for very reasonable prices. The Food......at this resort is Great! Every place we ate the resort was fantastic! There is also A great Burger place at the Shops At Wailea. Roy's in Kihei is always a favorite also. Don't miss the aquarium in Maalea Harbor, the underwater tunnel is well worth the trip. The highlight of the trip was the sunrise bike ride down Haleakala Volcano. We uses Mountain Riders with Pops and Tom as our guides and we had a blast!! Worth every penny. I've included some photos of the Sunrise and bike trip

<Title>“Don't miss the Maui Prince!”
<Content>What a wonderful experience we had at the Maui Prince! Traveling with my husband and teenage daughter, we were very pleased with the accommodations and the grounds, beach etc. Don't be dismayed by the reviews on Trip Advisor. I read these reviews each time I vacation and was a little concerned about the "room conditions". Let me tell you that the rooms are spacious, very clean and simply, but tastefully decorated. The insulation between rooms is great - didn't hear anything. The lanai is beautiful. Needing two beds, we were on the second floor, south facing (recommended in other reviews). We had a partial ocean view, enough for the beautiful mornings and sunsets as well as a view of the luau. And how much time do you really spend in your room??? The staff was exceptionally kind and helpful. The valet parking is included in your room rate and the bellmen are STILL smiling and willing to help...makes you want to tip them more. We loved the beach! Bring your boogie boards, sand toys, cameras and snorkel! Ask the bellman to "loan" you a boogie board...we gave ours to them and they said they had lots to loan out...a good secret! The waves are great for bodysurfing - very little rock, you can go barefoot. Turtles are in waist deep water right off the beach! The snorkel boat to Molokini (Kai Kanani) was terrific and they pick you up on our beach! We liked them so well we also went on the 4th of July sunset cruise to Lahaina to watch the fireworks - cocktails and appetizers, but very family oriented. The pools are small, but with the beach, we didn't even go to them! There is a great mini-golf course with real grass and fairways. There is shuffleboard and volleyball - plenty to keep my active teenager happy. There are kayaks to rent on the beach too. Lots of people were doing that. We had one meal at the hotel which was average. There are lots of great restaurants in the Wailea/Kihei area and there is a shuttle from the hotel. Best of all, the hotel is peaceful....not a lot of noise and chaos...just what we wanted for our tropical vacation...don't miss this oasis in South Maui!

<Title>“Lovely Hotel”
<Content>My family was recently stranded in Wailea due to the wildfires near Lahaina. We were staying at the Sheraton Maui and could not get back as the only road in or out was closed. We feared we'd have to sleep in our car when we learned that the Maui Prince had available rooms. Since we had never heard of this hotel, we had no idea what we were getting into, but anything was better than the car! Even though the hotel could have easily gauged all the wayward travelers arriving on its doorstep, they charged everyone of us a fair price. We were very pleasantly surprised when we arrived in our lovely, large room. It overlooked the beach, and had a very nice balcony, with a table, 3 chairs and a very useful drying rack. The bed was comfy and they promply brought us a roll-away and a number of amenities, including razors, combs, toothbrushes, etc... The bathroom was large and well appointed. We awoke the next morning and finally got a a good look at our view - magnificent. The hotel grounds are simply stunning. There are nature walks throughout the gardens, and an enormous koi pond. We had a great breakfast at the buffet (which was also well priced) and then decided that we might as well make the most of our "detour" and spent the rest of the day at the fantastic, quiet beach. We had heard that Makena beach was great but never thoought we'd get there since we were staying in Kaanapali. It did not disappoint, and in fact, we decided we preferred the atmosphere at the Maui Prince to the Sheraton.

<Title>“Outdated accommodations with high low-season prices”
<Content>If you know you're not going to be in your room a lot, don't mind outdated bathrooms and a musty smell and want to be in the South Maui area, this is your place. The Maui Prince has a nice lobby and a very nice staff, but the rooms are not very nice. The carpet in my room seemed newer, but the bed and the bathrooms seemed old and very outdated. There was also a musty smell that we couldn't seem to trace. The pool itself is quite small. I can't say enough about how great the staff is at the hotel, but the accommodations made me check out. If I had a full schedule planned that would have kept me out of my room enough, I might have stuck it out (especially b/c the rates seemed more reasonable than other resorts in the area). My plans consisted of tons of pool time, though, and for that reason I moved to a place where I wouldn't mind lingering in my room at times.

<Title>“Wonderful, friendly place!!!”
<Content>Just got back from our honeymoon at the Maui Prince, and I have to say it was wonderful!! The staff are very nice and helpful, the hotel clean and spacous, the rooms very nice with excellent views and the Luau was wonderful!!! We were seated with a couple who had been to 2 other Luau's on the island already and they agreed that the Prince's Luau was by far the best! The pool area and beach are wonderful! Our room was a partial oceanview and was excellent! Valet parking is a part of the service with no assitional charge and was a wonderful perk! The atrium/koi pond area in the middle of the hotel was beautiful as well as the grounds. Resort is the last on the south side of the island, but only 5-10 mins from Kihei and some very nice restaurants. I highly recommend cafe O'Lei for lunch, try the onion soup for sure! Snorkling was right off the beach in front of the resort and was a blast! All in all a wonderful trip and I can't wait to go back next year!!!

<Title>“ 'Old' Hawaii”
<Content>Thank Laka (Pele's babe) that the Maui Prince exists! It is the best kept secret on the Ilse of Maui. First off, the beach is fantastic: big, soft sand, good snorkling both to the right and left, and, most importantly, IT IS BASICALLY ONLY USED BY GUESTS OF THE MAUI PRINCE! That final point is the biggest point if you are looking to get away from crowds as part of your reason for going to Hawaii. Also, the resort is the closest to Molokini Crater (where we snorkeled with turtles, sharks and a variety of colorful fish). Next, there are a variety of restaurants on the property, so there is no need to drive into Wailea or Kihei for food. Yes, the food is pricey, probably right up there with the Four Seasons, Kea Lani, or Fairmont in terms of cost. It is good quality, however, and Hawaii in general is like eating in Manhattan, price-wise, let's be honest. As for the rooms, we had a suite at the far end of the hotel, not really an ocean view, but you still hear it all night, plus you get the bird songs (and, unfortunately, a punctual rooster). The hotel does need some love, i.e. bucks, in terms of exterior paint and interior decoration, both in the lobby and in the rooms. It is well kept, but no matter how clean you keep 20 year-old tile and furniture, it is still going to show wear and tear. Let me emphasize again, that it is CLEAN, but the owners do need to fork over the cash and do some basic updating. For example, the "gym" facility needs to be scrapped and a new out-building, perhaps near the croquet court, constructed of some 2000 feet to hold the current and new exercise equipment. The Prince sits at a real disadvantage to the "Big Four" ("Grand Wailea, Four Seasons, Fairmount, and the Marriott) in terms of appealling to more fitness conscious clietel (and, take note, Owner: those folks pay UP and a good portion of your current clientel is dying off). If they can't scrape up the $750,000-$1,000,000 for such facility, then they need to sell to someone else. That said, we would highly recommend this resort to those couples and families looking for a restful, interesting (on-site, pretty good luau, salt water swimming pools, etc.), and quiet vacation, this is the place. Our beef with the alternative Big Four is that its like being in Beverly Hills or the Upper East Side: lots of people, super pricey, very noisy, a lot of SEE AND BE SEEN (particularly at Spago at the Four Seasons), and a lot of people who go the Big Four just to tell their friends they went to the Big Four. We actually want to go someplace to go there, not impress others. We get enough fake boobs, spray on tan, swell fellas, snotty kids, etc. where we live, so we wanted something a little different. If you share our viewpoint, then you will be happy you stayed at the Maui Prince.

<Title>“Beautiful!”
<Content>My husband and I were married at the Maui Prince this month, and we spent part of our honeymoon there. It is a beautiful property, and all the hotel employees are wonderful. Rooms are larger than normal, with a big sitting area. Walls and doors are definitely soundproof. There is a large and small pool connected to the pool bar and restaurant. The beach on the property is lovely and safe for swimming. Everyone who helped us with wedding plans, arrangements, restaurant and activity reservations, room service, etc. were all friendly and nice. Snorkelling right off the beach is great, with a little reef where turtles socialize. The restaurants served delicious food, and the location was unbeatable. This was my favorite hotel ever. The only thing is that the hotel is in the process of being sold, and I have heard that they are going to build a number of condominium units on the property. I think this addition will change the feel and sense of welcome this property has.

<Title>“The Good and the Damp!”
<Content>This was our second stay at the Maui Prince. Our first was two years ago on our honeymoon. We had such a great previous trip there, so we decided to return. 1) Location - it is the best. You don't get the bad traffic or cramped feel from staying in Kaanapali. It's close to everything you'd want - cheaper food in Kihei, five minutes from Big Beach in Makena and a 10 minute drive from La Perouse Bay in South Makena. 2) Snorkeling and the beach in front of the hotel - amazing. You don't have to fight to get a chair on the beach or covered seating in the pool area. There is great snorkeling right in front of the hotel. The beach is truly one of the best I've been on in Maui - and I've been to a lot of them all over the island. We did the Kai Kanani snorkel trip to Molokini directly from the hotel. Molokini wasn't that great but when we stopped on the way back for "so-called turtle town" - it was amazing! We swam with five turtles and had a great time. It was priced very well and we ddin't have to make the drive to Ma'alea. 3) peace and quiet at the hotel. We rarely heard our neighbors. The Lanai/balcony was great. 4) service was wonderful. The staff here are very warm and friendly, very hospitable. On our way in, we were in Room 210 on the second floor w/ partial oceanview. It was really "partial" on the oceanview, but it was a large room and bathroom. We were upgraded on the second night to Room 317 - but actually secretly wished to go back to Room 210. The reasons? I think the rooms get smaller as you go higher (you'll notice this on the outside of the buildings). Also, the bed was MUCH better in 210 than in 317. The one negative thing I have to say is that we just felt like our hotel room was DAMP the whole time. We just felt really soggy in our bedroom. All hotel rooms in the tropics are going to have a certain level of humidity (your books will get a little wrinkled) but this was very extreme. It was very odd. This was my tenth trip to Hawaii, and I haven't experienced this level of dampness before. -If you book at the Prince, in sum, I'd recommend you join the Prince Preferred membership for free and get a nice discount on room rates and golf. And don't be so quick to shy away from the first or second floor as it probably means bigger rooms. (I think all rooms will hear the luau, it's not so bad, eh?) The room we stayed in for the remaining six nights ont he 3rd floor was MUCH smaller than on the 2nd. We didn't bother to move beacuse we just plain didn't want to. I recommend this hotel if you can get it for about $230 or less. I really wouldn't pay more than that to stay here. The furniture is very outdated. I hear they just got a new owner and perhaps some other things will change soon. Room service is great but the extras they charge are pretty high. --In maui, I also recommend the Westin Kaanapali Villas although the beach is a lot less inviting. It's a pretty quiet property and is less than 2 years old.

<Title>“Disappointed with the Prince”
<Content>The service at the hotel is great, but the hotel itself is not quite up to par. Maui itself is expensive, but paying $350/night for a hotel that's dingy and outdated, especially one that doesn't have enough covered walkways so that you don't get wet when it's raining (and it poured during our entire stay) was very disappointing. The elevators were old, the shower was tiny and covered in mold, and the beds were uncomfortable. We booked for our honeymoon and were told we had a great oceanfront room, but were given a room on the 2nd floor, right above where they held the luau which was very noisy, and you could barely see the water above the trees. We went to eat at 10:00pm after arriving and most of the restaurants were closed, and the food we ended up getting was sub-par. The grounds are beautiful and walking outside is great, and the beaches are very nice. It's very secluded also so you don't feel like you are on top of others. But when the earthquake happened and the power went out, the hotel was not prepared at all - no emergency generators, all of the restaurants shut down, and there was no backup plan for food. We had to leave and go to a different hotel to eat breakfast and lunch. There was also no communication about whether or not there was damage to the hotel or if we were in danger of a tsunami coming. All in all we were very disappointed with our stay in the Maui Prince.

<Title>“Great Maui hotel - set back and relaxed”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince Hotel from April 22th to the 26th on our honeymoon. This was our first trip to Hawaii. We stayed in an Oceanview Room with the Romance Package. Overall, the Maui Prince gives you exactly what you want out of Maui. The hotel is located way south on Maui, south of Kihei. It's a 20 minute trip from the airport, so it's not exactly a hike. This location really gives it value. The area is beautiful and natural. The only negative to the location is that you need to rent a car. Unavoidable based on where the Prince is. However, the Shops at Wailea and Kihei town are not far and will provide what you need. We chose the Romance Package. This is a great deal and perfect for a honeymoon. With it, you get free breakfast, replenished bottled water daily (why isn't this standard everywhere?), an oceanview room, free rental car (almost, you must pay tax), chocolate covered strawberries and champagne, and a $100 food credit. Not a bad deal for $420 a night, considering what you're getting. (Works out to -$60 for car, which you'll need, -$30 for breakfast, -$25/day for food credit, so it's really only $315/night). First, the room itself was nice, well-kept, but outdated. Everything about it screamed the 80s. Everything was in nice condition but the decor needs a revamp. I'd say no less than 5 years from now they should get cracking. Other than that, there was nothing to complain about. The balcony was gigantic and the view, even oceanview, was stunning and completely private. The room was large and spacious, way more than 2 people would need. The bathroom was large, with a doored off toilet, shower, and tub with shower. We stayed on the second floor, but we probably could have gotten a slightly better view a floor or two up. It was very nice leaving the balcony doors open while we slept. You heard nothing but the ocean. Quite a change from Waikiki! The hotel itself is unique - I don't think you'll see a design like this any time soon. It was mostly open air, with a large patio area with amazing landscaping and a giant pond full of Koi (after breakfast, spend a $1 and feed the koi! Well worth it). Again, the outdated look rears its head, but it's not something that will take away from your stay. Although we chose this hotel in part due to it having room service, we did not use it. We did try the Molokini Lounge which was good, and of course the breakfast buffet which was impressive. The sheer volume of options was quite nice as was the rotating menu options. We never ate at the hotel otherwise during our stay. We highly recommend doing an intro scuba dive. The instructors there are top notch (ask for Kris or Scuba Steve, lol) and the reef at the turtle cleaning station is amazing. Worth the cost for sure. You will see some amazing things. This is the only activity we took part in (having to pass on Haleakala), but the activity desk was more than helpful. The beach is not perfect but still untouched and beautiful. Our main problem with it isn't really related to the beach itself, but the windy conditions we found ourselves in. It may be the west Maui coast, or just weather related, but it got extremely windy each day we went to the beach. The ocean became too choppy to snorkel in on your own and you just got thrown around. We had to push our scuba to early the next day and miss Haleakala because the scuba would have been rough in the wind. The Maui Prince turned out to be a great choice for the second half of our honeymoon. It's in the right spot with the right package for a romantic getaway.

<Title>“Don't let the bed bugs bite........”
<Content>We arrived at the Maui Prince in the early evening on a Friday night. My first impression of the lobby was very good, it was open with a garden with trees in the center with birds sounds filling the lobby area. Quite nice. However, after checking in I found that the rooms were below average for a resort in Wailea. On a previous trip, we stayed at the Kea Lani and it is by far more luxurious. The furniture desperately needed updates, the cleanliness was horrible. I pulled back the coverlet of one of the doubles and viola, a dead bed bug! I then pulled the coverlet of the second be and there were tiny black specks and another but smaller, perhaps a baby bed bug. We immediately notified the front desk and asked to be reassigned to another room. The staff was not at all friendly about our finding and told us that they did not have another double room. When I asked if there had been previous complaints, the front desk person told us no and had the nerves to say that we probably let the bugs in when we opened the door. Uh, we just arrived, less than 10 minutes and the bugs were UNDER the coverlet. And advised us that they just recently had their pest control updated. Then come to find out, their rates only cover for 2 adults per room. There was three of us and advise us of a $60 per night room for the additional person. They finally agreed they would place some airline employees in a king room and give us the double room. I feel as if they are going to charge $350+ a night, they should have been more accommodating, especially since it is their fault. There was an excessive amount of cob webs and bugs stuck near the base of the headboard and between the bed and the nightstand that I was hardly able to get any sleep. In addition, the beds were too soft and gave me back and neck pain. Their beach was nice and their service staff were friendly but I will never, ever go back to the Maui Prince and if clean hotels I would definitely not recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Fabulous beach and staff, rooms okay”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince three nights. The beach was the nicest we saw on Maui, and you will almost have it to yourselves. We saw lots of turtles and fish right off the hotel shore.... The pool, while not very big, is also very peaceful and relaxing. The staff are super helpful and friendly. Yes, the rooms are dated, but ours were clean and quite large. We had a view of the ocean and of the garden that was nice to wake up to. Children are given a welcome gift. The grounds are beautiful, and very well kept. This is probably the only resort on Maui that gives this level of quiet, peaceful relaxation. If you hate crowds, this is probably one of your best choices on Maui. If you need a beautifully decorated room, and more resort style amenities, then you should find a more upscale resort.... They have a hospitality room, so if you arrive early, or stay late, you can shower and change into/out of your swimsuits.

<Title>“for us getting married in Maui...The Prince is the ONO ( best)”
<Content>Hello, Let me start this review by saying how picky and insane i can be with selecting hotels. I live in New York City, I have traveled the world and stayed at dozens of hotels. and am pretty demanding and a pain in the [---] at times with the details, I expect the best from myself and others.. so I really want you to know the background of our unreal and amazing experience at the prince. Currently we are in the grand Hyatt in kauai, a 5 star hotel with everything and all the whistles...and it is good here.. but my heart longs for the Maui Prince. Let me tell you why... My wife and I got married in Maui last week, and wanted a place for everyone to stay that was not too expensive or too lux, like the other Walea resorts, BUT not too shabby either. We visited Maui in August and i think we were expecting a Hawaii of the past like when I last visited in 1997.. but alas Maui was more crowed then I thought and it took some getting used to. The Mui Prince however WAS chill and relaxed...once past most of the other hotels we were the only car there... I guess because i was expecting perfection and empty sand beaches .. it took me a while to get the feel of the island.. we stayed at the prince in august when we were scouting the island for our wedding.. they upgraded our room to an ocean prime and we had a good time.. we visited the fairmont and all the other resorts and were jealous ( for some stupid reason) .. gold and marble and amazing pools and services.. or so we thought.. no one would show us any rooms and the service was stuffy. but the prince was 300 a night for ocean views and the others 600 for mountain and parking lot views .. so you may ask.. if the prince was just ok and at first you were not wowed why did you go back? well when we went back home, we just said.. let's go for it.. i told people the pool was not the best and the rooms were not " perfect ( slightly faded pictures as the sun shines bright in every room).. we were looking forward to coming back to maui but honestly a little hesitant to stay at the prince... i mistook the chilled attitude there for lack of concern but actually it is concern .. they just give you a touch more privacy and are not always saying a somewhat fake Aloha every 5 seconds like were we are now at the " grand" hyatt. Fast forward / rewind to last week, and let me just say the amazing things we found about the Prince the second time around. Makena.. the area around the prince is amazing.. it is at the end of the road, and our 36 guests loved it.. hikes on almost empty beaches.. whales breaching off shore.. sea turtles every day off the beach.. the snorkle sail boats leaving directly from beach.. everything! just a quiet simple understated clean and luxury stay. If you are looking for a 5 star resort with all the bells and whistles the prince was not that.. but the kind service and friendlyness of the valets to the amazing secluded property.. it just worked.. we had the ping pong and volleyball all to ourselves outside and the beach was so amazing that people from other hotels came to our beach! We stayed for 6 nights and they upgraded us to an ocean front suite as a thank you... Cindi Rosetti was a pleasure to deal with in the Reservations department at the hotel. To give you an idea of how kind and thoughtful they are there.. RON.. my dear Ron.. he was the nicest person i may have ever met. My wife left her wedding dress in our room my mistake.. uh oh! and Ron packed it up and ups'd it the next day to us in NYC.. above and beyond that Ron also returned my father in law's tux to a shop near the airport as we had an early flight and the store was not open.. really what service and what a guy! beyond that everyone was nice.. not this stuffy.. hello mr -------, but a real hello in the morning and even asking me if i was relaxed and ok with my wedding coming up. So I am here to always talk about the Prince and what they did for us.. how kind they were and how above and beyond they went. I am leaving so much out.. but from the quietness of Makena, but still being close to everything, to the on the beach feel and the sound of the waves all night long, to the birds in the courtyard all coming home to sleep at night.. I will never forget.. The hotel was just bought out and i hope so much they just make small changes.. maybe redo some bathrooms... update some stuff here and there.. but the feel of this resort should not be changed.. it is sort of this modern ( 1970's ) japanese hawaiian feel...you don't need a bigger pool as the ocean 20 yards away was one of the best in my life.. the breakfast buffet is great ... they even have japanese breakfast that my wife ( she is japanese) loved. and there is also wonderful food in the prince court. some last things .. the rooms on the lower floors are bigger and the non ocean front rooms were also bigger too! sort of the reverse of what i thought.. try to get a room ( about half) that the door overlooks the courtyard.. that way an amazing breeze comes through ...and you here the birds more ?( a good and bad thing!) the property is amazing.. if you want a lux resort this is not for you.. but if you are young at heart and enjoy a resort fitting into the surroundings and blending in with nature.. it is AWESOME I applaud the Prince for being the highlight of our wedding ( we got married up country and had a lovely time in Maui) and it really deserves my full praise. BRAVO MAUI PRINCE...WE LOVE YOU, and will never forget you!

<Title>“Great place to get Married”
<Content>We stayed here since we got married on Makena Beach in front of the Maui Prince. This was 1st stop out Big Island(Outrigger Keauhou) and Oahu(Outrigger Waikiki on Beach) which I also wrote reviews and stayed at each 5 nights. Few things I liked are open air lobby and the floors when you walk in and how open it was.The garden and waterfall and Koi ponds are really nice. Our room was an oceanfront and I believe it was room 333 and had a lanai. One negative about the room was the bathroom and the shower head looked real cheap. The air condition did work good so that helps since it was so very humid. We did have breakfast at their buffet which was acceptable at Cafe Kiowai. The cafe at the pool was good too. The pool is nothing great at all so just go to the beach. There is a bar that stays open to like 10pm or 11pm so you can unwind. I feel there were more positives than negatives staying here. Would I stay again probably not only because I'm active person and work out a lot so I eat 4 or 5 times a day and it gets expensive not having a kitchen around. The little fitness room was sufficient to get the basics done. It's relatively new equipment not some 70's nautilus multi-station. Good cardio equipment and towels and water supplied there. Few tips for people getting married there not using Maui Prince grounds. Have someone reserve a spot in the morning by bathrooms at the Makena beach since it's open to the public and is first come first serve. It gets really really hot and you will be sweating so dress light. I was fortunate to save a spot that we wanted since there was 2 other weddings going on at the same time. Wheeew. We stopped at Grand Wailea couple days after our wedding and there was a few weddings going on but way too many people and kids running around. I did see a few turtles but I don't see it as so called turtle town. I saw a lot more turtles at the Big Island(Outrigger Keahou). Overall, this is quiet area and doesn't have a crowded feeling at all. I enjoyed my stay here and don't have any regrets.

<Title>“Loved It!”
<Content>It was our first trip to Hawaii. We stayed at the Prince before boarding the Norweign Cruise Line in Maui and again when we returned. They staff was amazing. The front desk people were more than happy to answer any questions and give us advice on what to see. In fact, we found "Big Beach" through them. Once you leave the Prince, take a right out of the parking lot and drive to the very end. And the road DOES end. The scenery is fabulous. They even offered to keep our luggage for us on our last day there so that we did not have to be bothered with it until we went to the airport at 11PM. I would definitely stay there again. No complaints from us!

<Title>“It was fine”
<Content>Every February for 6 years, a group of friends have vacationed together at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel on The Big Island. Because of the earthquake, our annual destination hotel closed. We thought this would be a good time to try another island. We also thought that we would be safe trying the Mauna Kea's sister hotel, The Maui Prince. We had a fabulous trip but I thought a few comments might help others. First of all, the hotel is very clean and peacefully located far enough away from the commercial centers to enjoy the peace of Hawaii. However, it is still close enough to get to other restaurants and shopping. Other reviewers have mentioned that the hotel is run-down. This is true. It is quiet and clean but the price per room was close to the internet price at the Four Seasons a few doors down. We dined at The Four Seasons and we all agreed we wished we had reserved our rooms at this beautiful property. The staff at the Maui Prince, with a few exceptions, seemed angry. At lunch by the pool one day, one of the ladies in my party asked for Swiss cheese instead of Pepper Jack Cheese on a sandwich. The waitress sighed angrily. I laughed and said "I guess this isn't Burger King". She snapped, "It just makes it hard on the cook." I know this seems minor but the pervasive attitude was as if we were the unwelcome and uninvited relatives disrupting everyone's schedules. At least we were able to laugh consistently and have a good time. We heard that this hotel was just bought out by another group so possibly there are job security questions floating around. Who knows? It is a far cry from the rich tradition of the Mauna Kea where the employees appeared to own the place reflected in their pride of service. Also to note, the Maui Prince is set away from the beach so enjoying the beach is an effort. Don't pick the bfast buffet package unless it makes extreme financial sense. Actually the package ended up costing a little bit more based on menu prices rather than buying your own bfast. The food quality at this hotel is excellent, the property is clean, and the location is good nonetheless we will not return to the Maui Prince because there are nicer properties in the same price range and sure to be staffs with more pleasant attitudes. The customer is not always right at The Maui Prince.

<Title>“Long Time Guest”
<Content>Stayed at the Prince 2/12-2/22/07. Have stayed there 5 times prior. Have always enjoyed the peace & quiet of the resort, always felt the openess even when resort was full. The resort has restricted the area where guests can place lounges on the beach, resulting in a crowded feeling with lounges within a few feet of each other. Our shower ran from very cold to very hot without warning. As usual the staff was excellent & responded to all our requests,although the shower never really worked right. In the past we have never thought about staying anywhere other than the Prince - After last visit we will at least look at other options.

<Title>“Great Vacation”
<Content>The Maui Prince is an excellent hotel. Great food, friendly staff, secluded beach. Not crowded. We recommend the ocean front rooms. We could see whales from our room lanai. We got a "romance package" including a convertable, the breakfast buffet and a $100 dinner. Seemed reasonable...and we really e joyed ourselves. We recommend the Whale cruise that departs from the beach at the hotel. We had 25 people on a catamaran. The whales swam near the boat. We will choose the Maui Prince again.

<Title>“Maui Prince - still as good as ever”
<Content>After reading the reviews, I am now firmly a believer in parallel universes. There is a Maui Prince somewhere that has poor service, surly staff, slummy bathrooms and is over-priced and over-rated, but the Maui Prince in my universe is really rather good. I have stayed there on 5 occasions in 5 years, and while I have noticed a degradation in the room decor etc, the overall ambience remains good, and the service and attention from the staff if anything has improved. On my 1st morning, I went to the Cappochino Corner cafe to buy supplies for my breakfast on the lanai, and Evelyn who was serving immediately said Welcome back!. It had been 12 months (to the day) since I had last been at the Prince, and there must have been 1,000's of customers through the cafe since then. Perhaps as a Brit I stand out a bit, but I don't have 2 heads or wear a crown or anything, and she still remembered me. That's good. The room was look inga bit faded, the furniture a bit scratched. Bed comfortable, no scratchy sheets, and the maid kept the room Impeccable. I did not resort to hiding bits of dirt on the floor to see if they had been cleaned (as I've read others do). The luau on the lawn is pretty appalling it has to be said. I heard from my room the same jokes as last year, and I would certainly recommend anybody to give this a total miss. Eating in the hotel is expensive, but they'll run in the shuttle down to Wailea where there are good places to eat. A car is really essential though. Despite the hotel being full, the beach and pool-deck were invariably almost empty. Imagine that in Europe, where if you have not reserved your sunbed by dumping a towel on it by 30 mins after sunrise then you'll never get one! There had been a big storm the week before, and half the beach had been lost to the ocean (along with beach cabanas and chairs), so the beach was narrower and steeper than before. But it is beautiful, and the wonderful big beach and even-more wonderful little beach are 10 mins away in the car. Negatives: . rooms are a bit run-down, but still comfortable and Clean . eating is expensive . noise does travel - remember Meg Ryan in the deli scene from When Harry Met Sally? --- well I heard pretty convincing Meg Ryan impersonations on 3 out of my last 4 mornings (starting about 0630) through the open lanai doors, and from the room below. Positives: . staff . views from lanai . gardens . the sun going down behind Molokini . quiet pool area/beach . always seemed to be staff cleaning and sweeping While I was staying, it was announced that the property had been sold for $575M. I expect big changes to occur (the now-needed refurbishment), but perhaps an upping of the room-rate to match. Overall, a delightful 10 days in paradise (pity I was there on business, but there are worse places to travel to in the service of Queen and Country) Maui Prince, I hope you get a face-lift, but please do not change from your present ethic of providing a peaceful haven with attentive staff.

<Title>“awesome”
<Content>We can't tell you how happy we were with our 7 night stay at the Prince. We read the reviews and were concerned, but we can tell you that from the moment we arrived at the hotel were treated like VIP's. (Vallet attendents, Ron at the front desk, Diana at the activities desk, to all the people who made our stay wonderful, we would like to say thank you.) We agree with most of the reviews, the rooms are dated, however, they are very clean and the view we had from the 4th floor was awesome. The balcony was beautiful and the bathroom was just fine, nothing to write home about but fine. We can't think of anything bad to say about the Prince. We chose it because we wanted romance, and time to spend with each other, we were not disappointed. We rented a car and drove the island, relaxed on the beach and by the pool, went swimming, drank some cocktails, we went on a sunset cruise, whale watching, snorkling, went to a luau,and we had some fine dinners at some excellent restaurants. For us it does not get any better. Thank you Maui Prince and staff.

<Title>“Great beach, decent value”
<Content>This was our first trip to Maui and we really struggled to find a nice place that wasn't way overpriced (especially in Wailea area). So we settled on the Prince and couldn't have been happier with our choice. We were immediately impressed with the warm welcome, and happily surprised to be upgraded to an Oceanview room upon check-in. The beach was great and never felt crowded. Our favorite part of the entire trip was snorkeling with sea turtles...right out in front of the resort no less! We even met a baby turtle that came right up to us out of curiousity and tried to play. Amazing! The resort is far from Lahaina and other main cities, but we liked it that way. Our favorite part was when we went towards the end of the island, found a nearly hidden trail and hiked out over lava to a private snorkeling spot. I believe it's called the "Aquarium" in Maui Revealed. We were the only two people there and it was the most incredible snorkeling. Take your water shoes for climbing in and out over the lava fields, but be prepared to feel like your snorkeling in your own private aquarium. And don't miss lunch on your way back to Makena -- there's a fantastic roadside food stand on the right side of the road. The woman that runs it touts it as Tony Hawk's favorite food on the island. The rooms at the Prince are a bit outdated, but they are still very nice. For the price (compared to other resorts in Wailea) you can't beat the Prince!

<Content>Read the reviews and questioned my pick --but after staying here 3 days in Jan. I give it 5 stars. So those that give this hotel less I question your reasoning. It is next to Big beach a hidden secret and Little Beach --more of a secret. A great hotel in a quite location

<Title>“Beautiful Grounds, helpful Staff, dated rooms”
<Content>Great location if you're looking for the quiet side of the island. Golf also seems to be plentiful nearby. The hotel grounds were really well done, great pool, outdoor hot tubs, and nice beach. Lots of games, volleyball, ping pong, etc... The room was a bit dated though, but why stay in the room when in Maui, well except to sleep, except that the NIGHTLY Luau was on the East side of the hotel so that hotel side heard this nightly. If you wanted to sleep in the late afternoon, early evening(jet lag ya know), you may have to change rooms to the other side. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was really good, but doubtful the buffet was worth $54 for two. Also, if you're looking for a beach run, look elsewhere, this seemingly private beach was quite small. Overall I'd say an average hotel, would likely stay elsewhere, though this was certainly not shabby!

<Title>“Hello Hawaii 5-0...”
<Content>This was a 40th birthday present from my mom and it was for me a trip of a lifetime! Spent first week in January in Kauai renting a condo in Princeville. Incredibly beautiful place but some bad luck weather days made rainly moments and doing things challenging to say the least. By the time I got to Maui for second week was craving sun and hotel amenities. Friend recommended the Maui Prince as she and her family were renting a condo at the Makena Surf and we wanted to be near each other. She did say it was a throw back to the 70's but cool. All hotel photos and reviews talked to that as well. Best review however was the person who said, ask what you want from a hotel - glitz or taste. This hotel and its grounds are quite beautiful and grand and in its heyday was probably nicer than some of the pricey joints in Wailea ie. Four Seasons, Fairmont, Grand Wailea. I booked directly with the Prince and got a great rate of $259USD per night. The others were at least $400+. For the time we spent in the room I couldn't really justify spending that kind of money. Also eating in Maui isn't the cheapest either. Unless you know of and seek the local joints its pretty much food courts or expensive places. Did find a great pizza place in Wailea across from Shops at Wailea - order at the counter etc. And don't miss Mama's Fish House in Pa'ia (45min from Maui Prince). Go for lunch as it's right on the beach - what a view. What an incredible meal - best fish I have ever had. And service was excellent. Tab for 2 was $200 but worth every penny. Service was great. People friendly. Room wasn't made up till about 3/4pm each day but oh well could work around that. Rooms were a good size. Furnishings bit 5-0 but think of it as 'retro digs'. Few ants in the bathroom but room plenty big for everyone. Got upgraded to an ocean view and could see whales from the balcony in the mornings. Restaurants were a bit pricey but Mai Tai's at the Molokini lounge fun and a great first night thing to do. Had lunch at the Four Seasons once - which then makes the Prince eats seem good value. Friend used the spa services which are Aveda and enjoyed it. Pool area is very nice. Lots of loungers and some cabanas. There are 2 salt water pools small and smaller but with the beach right there and max 1-2 people in the pool at a time it was fine. Overall I really enjoyed my stay at the Prince. Loved the location with it being more remote. Everyone rents a car so you can drive and go anywhere on the island. Got a tip in the hot tub...Prince may be sold soon which probably means reno but more $$ for rooms.

<Title>“Best vacation in years!”
<Content>I had a conference at the Maui Prince and signed up for a room before reading any reviews. I almost cancelled my reservation after reading numerous reviews on this site that were less than glowing, but I am glad that I decided to give the Maui Prince a try. The resort was quite, secluded, and had fabulous snorkeling right off the beach! For eight days I sat on the beach, read a book, swam with turtles, and enjoyed doing a whole lot of nothing. I agree with more recent postings; the Maui Prince was everything I wanted. It was not Las Vegas glitz but a relaxed vacation destination. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and quiet. Yes, the decor was slightly outdated but..... If I wanted glitz and decor I would drive 4 hours south to Las Vegas. Wonderful! If you want a quiet, luxury hotel with its own beach.... the Maui Prince is your place. I would return in a heartbeat.

<Content>we stayed 4 days. the 'ocean view" was disappointing for the price. but the room was large and comfortable. we were near the service elevator, so it was a little noisy. nice shuttle to the shops. don't go to their luau, even with the discount, it was fair--like on a cruise ship. rent a car because the prince is at the end, but that was nice and peaceful.

<Title>“Overall a nice place”
<Content>Maui was the second island of our stay, and it's beautiful. My second visit to Hawaii, but my family & husband's first time. The Maui Prince is located at the very southern tip of the island and is the last hotel on this side of the island. The grounds are beautiful, and are great to just stroll around on during the day or night. The beach is pretty secluded since you're at the end of the island, and is really clean, but the water can get pretty rough at the end of the day. It's also right outside your door, which is great. The pool left something to be desired and is the major downfall of the Maui Prince. It's pretty small and was really cold. There were plans for 2 additional pools, but City ordinances on how close pools could be to the ocean took that out of the plan. The rooms were nice, but nothing spectacular or over the top. It's a great value for Maui, and you don't spend much time in the room itself, so no big deal. We also ate in the upscale restaurant @ the Maui Prince and everyone really enjoyed themselves. But, know that pretty much everything closes by about 10pm in Maui, so dinner reservations aren't usually taken after 9pm. We're from Chicago, so that's a bit strange to us - it was nice to actually HAVE to relax and get a good night's sleep though! As for other activities, we snorkeled with the "4 Winds" ship and went to Molokini & Turtle Town. It is a popular place to go for boats & tourists, but everyone had fun (about $70 per person). My brothers went deep sea fishing, and after waiting an hour for the boat captain, they headed out...and didn't catch anything ($150 per person) for 7 hours. We also did the Road to Hana - I've done this twice now and can recommend a couple of things: rent a Jeep, go early (leave your hotel around 6-7am), and get the tape offered at the gas station on your way ($10 and really helpful). One of the best parts of our trip was biking down Haleakala and ending at the Maui Winery. Aloha Bicycle Tours (---) was recommended to us - and well worth it. Not as easy as they make it sound, but a really great experience for all of us. Mention their website and it's $99, otherwise it's $120 per person. The owners, Marc & Karen, were fantastic. They give you water & snacks along the way, and provide a great lunch @ the winery. Enjoy your trip!

<Title>“Glitz or Shibui, your choice”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince Dec. 14-21st. All the mixed reviews of this hotel reflect only what people want from their vacation experience. Some obviously want GLITZ which they are not going to get at the Prince. Japanese have a word, shibui, that means quiet tastefulness, and that is what you get at this Japanese-owned hotel. We looked over the Wailea hotels while there and found them glitzy, not true Hawaiian atmosphere. Think Las Vegas instead. I have lived in Hawaii in years past and the Prince has the real feel of old Hawaii. If you want a quiet vacation in a beautiful location and very friendly staff choose the Prince. If you want glitz, go elsewhere. Look to what YOU want from a vacation. Also want to add, maybe it depends on the room you happen to get. Our room and bathroom were quite satisfactory; though we had the cheapest rate and the furthest room back from the ocean, we still had a nice view of it from our lanai and ate most breakfasts out there enjoying our view of the lovely grounds with the ocean in the background.

<Title>“The Prince is a Pauper!!!”
<Content>For all of you that steered us to this hotel... please say you are sorry! First of all, we arrived at the property which is at the end of the island in Makena, quite a ways from Wailea. Our room was not ready, so we walked out to the beach and to the bar. No one was there, except a woman who told us that the rooms were "not what I expected, our refrigerator was old and the room was dated". From that point we were a bit leary. We then checked in, only to find our our "oceanview" room was not that at all, if we moved to the end of our lanai, we could barely even see the ocean!! The room was quite old and there were bugs flying around. YUCK!!! We complained to the mgmt and after 3 hours on the phone with Expedia trying to change hotels, the night manager told us he would upgrade us to his "best" room. Well, it was basically the same old, dated, and dreary decor. NO! Expedia finally told us we could change hotels but they would not credit our act for 7 days, but we were so disappointed with the hotel, we stayed for one night and happily moved on up to the Ritz Carlton, a gorgeous hotel in Kapalua...for a higher price, of course. The night manager of the Prince tried to apologize by sending us a free botle of complimentary champagne. Too bad it was their "house", 2005 vintage.... it gave us a headache! Overall, the "Pauper" is a very poor hotel, with bad service, ugly rooms... what more is there to say?? Save your $300.00 per night and stay elsewhere... 4 stars it is NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>“Great experience”
<Content>Great hotel. Lobby is beautiful, the snorkeling right off the beach is fantastic. Just swim out and to the left. Staff was extremely friendly. The guys were cleaning part of the lower roof by us and everytime we walked by said Aloha. In fact everyone said Aloha. Grounds are pretty and romantic. Breakfast buffet delicious. Well stocked gift shop (its almost a convenience store!). My only negative is that the decor in the room could use some updating. It's looking a little old (not really beatup but on the older side designwise). The bathroom is older but fairly large and the shower has great water pressure.

<Title>“Peaceful Retreat”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince in September for 9 days and could not have been happier with our stay. We got a free upgrade to an ocean view prime room and the view was great! I donâ€™t understand all the negative reviews? We really enjoyed the relaxed, quite atmosphere at the hotel. We had previously stayed at the Hapuna Beach Hotel on the Big Island for our honeymoon. We liked the service and room so much we decided to stay with Prince hotels for our trip to Maui. The room is dated, but there was a large fridge, which enabled us to stock up at the local Safeway (Kihei) and save some money. Due to its location it is a drive to get to anywhere, but that did not bother either my wife or me. We were sad to hear, during our stay, that he hotel is up for sale. I hope the future owner does not change too much. We would definitely stay there again in the future.

<Title>“Mediocre at Best”
<Content>We decided to give it a try despite the reviews. The room was okay, but the bathroom definitely needs an upgrade. The grounds of the hotel were beautiful. Sushi restaurant was excellent. Our experience with the staff and service level was definitely spotty. There were a few employees who truly understood and seemed happy to provide good service. Most of the employees seemed to be the "do the minimum required" type and would not work with guests to find solutions to problems. Service in the restaurants was definitely slow and sloppy. It wasn't a bad deal for the price, but we would not stay here again.

<Title>“Perfect Vacation!”
<Content>My husband and I celebrated our 32 wedding anniversary at the Maui Prince hotel recently. What a wonderful experience! We came in from Miami, Florida after a one night lay over in Las Vegas, this allowed us some relief from the usual jet lag affecting those of us from the East Coast. Upon arrival we picked up a Jeep Wrangler at the rental station right in the airport. Using the maps provided by the rental company we easily found our way to the Hotel (about a 30 minute drive). Upon arrival at the hotel I mentioned to the clerk that we had been planning this trip for 32 years, and were finally there, so we would really appreciate a room with a nice view. She was very accomodating and changed our room from the 2nd to the 5th floor. We had a perfect view of the mountain, the golf course and the ocean, including a distant view of the island of Molokoi right from our balcony! The Hotel is very well kept, and the staff is quite friendly and accomodating. Unfortunately, the restaurants are very expensive, but the food is delicious. After our first night's dinner - a $175 experience - and next morning's buffett breakfast - $80 for 2 - we decided to seek alternative restaurants in Kihei, only a 10 minute drive away. We stopped at the local Supermarket and purchased breakfast foods, snacks, bottled water, beer and soda, which we kept in the room's refrigerator. The Hotel Luau at $80 per person was very nice. We attended the regular Luau and were treated to a nice show, typical food buffett, and quite an entertaining show. The hotel also hosts a huge Luau twice a week for Cruise passengers on the grounds, which turned out to be right outside our balcony, so we got to see the show again for free! We took long drives around the Island of Maui. Our first day we took a drive to the West side of the Island towards Lahaina, and just kept goint around the coast all the way around the North side ending up back at the Airport. What a great drive! My husband and I enjoyed this drive even more than the much touted Drive to Hanna - (that is not to say that going to Hanna and the required stop to the Black sand beach - is not a wonderful trip also) but the drive up the North Coast through very winding narrow roads is worth every heart stopping turn! Going back to the hotel after these long drives was like returning to a wonderful peaceful retreat to refuel for the next adventure! We would absolutely go back to this wonderful place.

<Title>“The Prince IS a Prince!”
<Content>My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at The Maui Prince for our wedding night and the few nights after. Our Travel Agent- Teresa Nelle of Luxury Hideaways/AMT American Express Travel got us a fabulous room that looked over the pool & ocean. It was a dream. I checked in before our wedding & we returned to our room to find champagne (yes- the real french stuff) & chocolate covered strawberries! The room service was very good, and the menu extensive- we found the best room service cheeseburger on the island! Of course we ordered the sashimi too! And in the morning the buffet breakfast was great. We didn't get a chance to eat at either of the acclaimed restaurants that The Prince boasts, because we didn't call for a reservation early enough. So be sure to not wait to make your reservations. The hotel is a bit older, so the furniture & fixtures are getting a bit dated, but everything was in fine working order & overall the hotel was very clean & in great shape. The service was fabulous as well- everyone had true Aloha Spirit. The hotel is in a great private location & has it's own uncrowded beaches, as well as activity counters, covered beach loungers & one of the best snorkling spots on the South Side of Maui. We will surely be back to The Prince for an Anniversary, and we'll definately call Teresa to help with our plans! Mahalo & Aloha! Casey & Sean

<Title>“Dated Hotel”
<Content>We have previously stayed at this property and visited again this year for dinner at their Japanese restaurant. The primary tempation for staying at the Prince is that very reasonable room rates can be obtained, either through the hotel directly or priceline. We had intended on staying for our first night due to a late arrival but instead stayed at the Mariott in Wailea. Notwithstanding the price, we found the property as a whole to continue to be very dated and desperately in need of a face lift. The beach and location is so attractive so the potential is there if they were only willing to spend some money updating the hotel. The funny part is that my in-laws stayed at the Prince 20 years ago for their honeymoon (second for each) and constantly rave about how wonderful the hotel was. The reality is that absolutely nothing has changed since their stay, for better and for worse. Hopefully the owner of the property will eventually decide to inject some capital and return this hotel to its former glory. Until then, it will not be able to compete with the other hotels in Wailea.

<Title>“Mixed Feelings”
<Content>After reading the previous negative reviews about the hotel I was very apprehensive on my arrival at the hotel. This was part of a three week tour that my husband and I were on to celebrate his 50th birthday (this was not acknowledged by the hotel despite them being aware of this). We had just left The Omni Hotel in San Francisco, which was outstanding ,and had booked seven nights at the Maui Prince. First impressions were positive, the reception area and the grounds were impressive. Unfortunately the room and in particular the bathroom area was slightly disappointing. Despite this if I am honest my husband and I settled in quickly and we began to appreciate what the hotel had to offer. The staff were very pleasant and helpful, the grounds are magnificent, the beach was first class and the restaurants good value. The household staff cleaned the rooms every day to a high standard and all the toiletries were renewed as was the complimentary coffee and water. There is a fridge and a separate area within the room for you to prepare food if you choose to do so. If you are staying at this hotel you do require a car as it is too far from the nearest resort. We survived the road to Hana which is an experience in itself. We left our hotel at 7.00am and arrived in Hana at 09.30am. The journey is spectacular however Hana is very disappointing - there is nothing there apart from a few houses, some art galleries and a hotel. There are no places to eat so have breakfast or lunch before you go. Would we go back to the Maui Prince? At this stage I don't think so but that does not mean that we did not enjoy our stay or appreciate the hotels finer points of which there are many. If you want a relaxing quiet holiday then this is the place for you.If the hotel is modernised then I would not hesitate to return. I hope this review is helpful to others (Best wishes from Scotland)

<Title>“Great Honeymoon Spot”
<Content>We stayed at the Prince Sept. 24- Sept 29 before heading to Kauai for the rest of our honeymoon. We thought the hotel was great. We arrived at night and were greeted immediately by the very friendly staff. As a matter of fact, the staff was always great! Our bags were brought up immediately as well. Our room was # 527, great room. Overlooking the beach, but private enough. The room was good, no complaints. The bathroom was spacious and in good condition. The grounds are beautiful, full of greenery and flowers. Very well maintained. The beach is pretty and roomy enough not to feel crowded. The hotel is the last hotel on the stretch of road. It is a drive to get to restaurants and such, but in Maui, riding around with the top down is what you want to do. See the island, if you don't rent a car and drive around the island you are definately missing out. At night there is not much to see, but the weather is always pleasant. We ventured out to find restaurants. We drove to the West side one day, which was fun with the winding roads. We drove all of the way around the west side which went through little villages like up in the mountains. There is a gallery in the middle of nowhere that you MUST stop and visit. We did Mt. Haleakala one day, and tried to drive to Hana one day. However our drive to Hana was cut short, b/c we did not want to be late for the luau. Do the Luau!!!!!!! It is a treat, I thought. I was a 1st timer to the islands and had a great time. Book your tickets for the luau right when you get there, b/c they do get full. That is the luau that you want to see. And get there early though, the later you are the further back you will be seated. Great Luau!!! We booked ours with someone at the hotel, but went to the luau at another hotel, the Prince luau had been cancelled due to weather. I would suggest booking through the hotel, the guy knew what he was talking about. Everything he said was exactly how it was. And you won't be risking having to go to a time share seminar that other places entice you to do. We had 1 breakfast buffet at the hotel, we sat outside, it was nice, but expensive for breakfast. The Prince was great for our stay. And for the price it was great. If you are going to Maui to stay in the hotel, stay somewhere like the Four Seasons. But if you are going to Maui to see it, the Prince will satisfy your hotel needs. Staff was great, food was good, service was great, room was great, views were fabulous.

<Title>“Old”
<Content>The staff was very pleasant and friendly. The rooms are very old and need to be updated badly. They look like a motel 6 at best. The view was amazing and the salt water pool was a nice touch. There was an unbelievable sunset! Would I stay here again, probably not. It was overrated for the price of the room.

<Title>“Did not get the Aloha Feeling”
<Content>We just got back from a 8 day stay on Maui.The Island and sights were very nice. We stay at the Maui Prince, because we smoke we checked out the website the site read non-smoking rooms available upon request. So we book a oceanfront room, upon arrival we learned that all oceanfront was non-smoking.We tried to do the right thing, we ask for a smoking room we had to down grade to oceanview. The oceanfront room were up to date the, oceanview were not. The people were not helpful or friendly. We did no get the Aloha Feeling, we get the hit the road feeling.

<Title>“Wonderful Time!”
<Content>We were a little worried after reading some reviews but they proved pretty much groundless. Our check-in and welcome was seamless. We arrived early and were given a room right away. The manager sent champagne for our anniversary. With one exception the staff was friendly and efficient and that is important to us after a trip to Kona where the service ranged from surly to incompetent at a hotel there. Believe me, a consultation with the manager and head of security can put a dampner on your trip. (But that's another story.) Our room was comfortable and clean but not luxurious so if marble baths are important to you, find another place. We liked the private lanai with a view. This property is up for sale so hopefully the new owners will make some refurbishing choices in the rooms and bathrooms. Food here was pricey but good. There are plenty of other good restaurants in nearby Wailea or 10 minutes away in Kihei for the more budget-minded. Check out the panoramic view from the golf clubhouse and sit on the beach at night with a canopy of stars overhead and the sound of the surf. Romantic! Maybe you'll see a shooting star like we did. The luaus were constant throughout the visit but they wind up early. If you just want to watch the show walk up the pool path and stand in back to see the Samoan fire dancers. ( Entertainment in the hotel lounge was sedate & not our style.) People seemed to be enjoying the beach and pool, but if this beach isn't enough, gorgeous Big Beach is just down the road. BTW our Entertainment card was accepted w/o question in the Prince Court and Hakone restaurants. If you have a need to see and be seen or are high energy, this place may not be for you. But if you, like us, like a hotel with a Hawaiian feel right on the beach with a relaxing environment, it's wonderful. If you go in the off season, you can save 40 percent off the hotel room and the Entertainment Book for HI can be purchased online at the end of their year (around Aug or Sept) for a greatly reduced price. That's what we did. Aloha!

<Title>“Can't Add Much To What Has Been Said”
<Content>Canâ€™t really add much more than what has been said. The Maui Prince is situated on the exclusive section of the island but is the most dated property in the area. With that said, the beach and grounds are well kept and I donâ€™t think youâ€™ll be disappointed. If you have some extra money, try a resort actually in Wailea. The Makena/Wailea as a whole is quiet and the Shops at Wailea have some great restaurants and shopping venues. The eclectic happenings of Lahaina will be about an hour drive from the Maui Prince meaning if youâ€™re looking for great shops and restaurants in a town that is not so high scale, youâ€™ll need to drive for a while. The road to Hana is an all day thing. Even with a rental, we did the round trip. The â€œunpavedâ€� roads are not actually unpaved but are rough. If you do the round trip, youâ€™ll see some real interesting things most who visit Maui wonâ€™t see. With that said, once is enough. It was a long day. The reward that night was dinner at Mamaâ€™s Fish House. It was expensive but very good. In the end, if youâ€™re anything like my wife and I, you probably wonâ€™t see much of your hotel meaning the dated look of the Maui Prince might not be a big deal.

<Title>“Beautiful - Open - Great Views”
<Content>The Maui Prince was a wonderful ending to our honeymoon in September 2006. We had just come to the island from a very peaceful resort with no TV's or phones which was wonderful, but it was great to have the more typical resort amenities at the Maui Prince. The hotel has a wonderful lobby and open-air feeling in the courtyard, and the beaches in Wailea are the best. Though the resort is right next to the Four Seasons and the Grand Wailea, you can't really access the other resorts from the beach. All are essentially private. We were attracted to the Maui Prince by the reviews, the amenities, and also by the romance package. We got a great rate, including a convertible, a $100 food voucher to be used at one of the hotel restaurants, and champagne & chocolates delivered by room service. We were upgraded from an Ocean View room to a Prime Ocean View room at check-in. I'm not sure of the difference, but the views were admittedly incredible...and also very private. Noone around or even below could see into your room from the outside. The Maui Prince is also right next to a small island, Molokini, which is Maui's best for snorkelers. There is a great 35-person snorkeling trip that leaves from the Maui Prince (very convenient) which takes you to Molokini on a sailboat, includes breakfast, lunch, then unlimited beer/mai-tais. They make an extra stop so you can swim with the big turtles that swim just off the beach. A great trip and a good deal. Much better than the 200-person cattledriver ships that also go to the same spot. It is very nice to have a car on Maui. The pool is nice, but not incredible - I may have gotten restless if I didn't have a car after a couple days. We took an evening drive to Lahaina (great spot on the western coast), then took a day on the road to Hana. Do this drive, but don't do the full circle on the dirt road at the end - it's not worth it and is actually longer than circling back, like you're "supposed to". In all, I think this a great spot in the midst of some great resorts...without the 4 Seasons price.

<Title>“the perfect place!!”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for 5 days in mid-August. i think the hotel is fantastic - it is circular with the whole of the centre being open air. It looked like a botanic garden with all the waterfalls and beautiful plants. There are a lot of comments on this site about the condition of the rooms - our room was immacutely clean - the bed was very comfortable and we had a great selection of toiletries replaced every day in the bathroom. We had a fantastic view from the room - it is very quiet - exactly what we were looking for. If you are looking for state of the art bedrooms you will not find them here - that did not bother us because everything else was perfect! The hotel is situated on Makena beach which is absolutely to die for. The staff are helpful and friendly. The choice of restuarants and bars are very good. You also have a fridge in the room so you can stock up and eat/drink in the privacy of your balcony. The hotel was fully booked while we were there but it is so spacious it felt really quiet and peaceful. It is only a 5 min drive to Wailea where there is a selection of restuarants and shops -but far enough away to feel like paradise. I loved the raspberry lemonade smoothie that they sell in the coffee shop - we bought them to take to the beach/pool. The grounds are all totally immaculate and all staff everywhere smile and say "hello"! I can't wait to return to the Maui Prince.

<Title>“Honeymoon Heaven”
<Content>This was a perfect place for a honeymoon! The grounds of this hotel are like a whole world in itself. My husband and I really loved the waterfall they had in the courtyard. We were here during a sold out week and yet every time we used the hot tubs we had nobody else around. On the beach I think I saw 20 people at the most at 1 time. The last night of our honeymoon we went for a walk on the beach and never saw another person. This made it very romantic! Seem like it was our own personal beach! We did not go to the luau but we did get to sit and watch it with a perfect view from our lanai! The staff was very friendly and helpful! I can't comment on the food as we did not eat here at all. This is the perfect spot for honeymooners! All I can say is that it has a very romantic feel to it! Another charm the hotel has is that after a fun filled day in the busy citys you can come back to this hotel and enjoy peace and quiet. It is out of the hussle and bussle but yet close enough to it if you want it.

<Title>“Great hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince in Mid August for 6 great nights. We were in Maui for our honeymoon, and we had never been to Maui before. I was a little nervous after I read some reviews on the web, but the Prince was great, we had a wondeful, clean room with a great view! We went to the luau they had at the hotel and it was a great experince, the food was good, but the entertainment and location was the best part. We also went on the snorkeling trip right from the hotel, which was great. FOR THOSE THAT ARE STAYING IN WALIEA OR MAKENA, GO TO THE SNORKELING TRIP THAT DEPARTS FROM THE MAUI PRINCE HOTEL, IT WILL SAVE YOU ALOT OF DRIVE TIME!! We ate at Mama's fish house, Blu, Maui tacos, Alexanders, Outback, and poolside...all were great.... We did the drive to Hana, and it was fun, but something I will only do once. Stop at Twin falls, it was great, we went swimming in the waterfalls. Overall Maui was great, especially for a honeymoon!

<Title>“loved the gardens”
<Content>We syayed at the maui prince for 5 nites beginning on the 10 August.We were a little hesitant because of all the bad reviews the hotel had received,but could not fault the hotel or the staff.We were on our honeymoon and when we checked in we asked about an upgrade of our room which we were given.The views we had were spectular,pool was small but there was never many people around during the day,the gardens were wonderful,rooms very clean and the food excellent,our only fault we could find was that the rooms needed a make over,the furniture was dated,the bed was not great either.Having read alot of the negative reviews I think that these people want 7 star accomadation at 3 star prices or just maybe that we are from Europe and that our standards would not be as high as other continents.Finally for people who are worried about the Maui Prince,don't be as I would never write a review about a hotel but I feel I have to defend the Maui Prince on this occasion

<Title>“honeymoon in paradise”
<Content>I truly made the right choice for our weeklong honeymoon when I booked here. The grounds were gorgeous and we took many nice photos there- the website doesnâ€™t do it justice! The staff made us feel like royalty. They were very attentive- they even asked if I wanted a vase for the flowers I brought in! The lobby is gorgeous, all open-air, but it never felt too hot or cold. Our room was on the top floor (I think there are only 5 floors). It wasnâ€™t facing the ocean head-on, but we could see plenty of the ocean and also mountains. I liked how you could leave a 2nd door open and let air circulate the room, though itâ€™s still locked. We never even needed the a.c, though my husband usually wants it on. I had no problem with them needing to modernize, as other people wrote in. The bathroom was decorated with nice ceramic accessories and the toilet had its own separate room. The cleaning staff was amazing. Itâ€™s like they knew when we left the room, whether it was in the morning or afternoon and when we got back, it was immaculate. I liked how you had the choice of conserving resources by not getting the sheets washed, if you donâ€™t want to. They never knocked on the door and bothered us. We ate at the Japanese restaurant and itâ€™s probably would be fantastic, though I realized Iâ€™m not crazy about raw fish. The presentation was like art and the butterfish with garlic-tasting flowers was phenomenal. We had a nice time at the luau, but looking back- we could have spent the money better somewhere else (go to Nickâ€™s Fishmarket at the next hotel and blow $100 on a much better dinner). It was entertaining seeing all the just-married grooms on stage doing the dance! What others wrote in about the cafÃ© at the golf course being a best-kept secret is absolutely true! Go there for the gorgeous view and split an ice-cream brownie. I also had the lunch â€œmedleyâ€� plate and it was very good and reasonably priced. We had fun spotting the mongooses along the road. Look for them in the shady grass area on your drive in/out. We booked a 2 hour snorkeling package through the hotel. It was a new experience for me, but 2 hours seemed like more than enough. I was a little cold, since it was so early in the morning, I had trouble breathing with the gear, since I was shivering- the long-sleeved shirt Iâ€™d bought didnâ€™t help. Iâ€™d suggest going later in the day- and buy your own gear. My husband caught a cold not too long after, and we wondered if it was from the equipment. If youâ€™re going to send postcards, make sure you buy stamps at the front desk, because the machine in the store charges double. Iâ€™d love to go back, and if I can afford it, Iâ€™ll go back to the Prince.

<Title>“We've Given Up on The Maui Prince”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Maui Prince twice a year for about five straight years, but gave up on the property. All the negative comments by other writers are the same problems we encountered, on an increasing basis, over the years with the Maui Prince. Indifferent Front Desk staff, shabby and dated decor, rooms in varying states of cleanliness and disrepair, beach furniture that is dirty and broken and a pool area that is desperately outdated compared to other properties. The list goes on and on. It's particularly bothersome as the Prince's rates are certainly not in line with it's facilities and amenities. From our perspective, it appears that Prince Hotels is not investing any capital in this property for improvements or remodeling. Why should they, the occupnacy remains high - this property is a "cash cow". It's very hard to understand how a large hospitality chain can be so indifferent about a property in such an gorgeous location at a world class tourist destination. My hope is that someone at Prince Hotels will read this and wake up. They have a gem of a property that desperately needs work! Until they do, we'll continue to stay elsewhere on our twice a year visits.

<Title>“Anniversary paradise”
<Content>We stayed at the Prince for 9 days for our 25th anniversary. After reading many negative reviews, we were worried about what we would encounter. We wasted a LOT of unnecessary time worrying. From the moment of check in until we checked out, we were treated like royalty. We had saved for a long time for this trip. We are NOT wealthy but we DO like nice things. The hotel is very pretty. The rooms are decorated with a tropical motif, and although they are not "plush", they are nice, comfortable, and the bedding was immaculate. Our housekeeper did an excellent job EVERY day. She even changed the sheets more often than we requested; maybe because she knew we were having an anniversary honeymoon. ( after 25 years) The whole staff at this hotel seemed to go above and beyond. The beach was beautiful, and we didn't feel like the pool was small. It was never crowded. The restaurants were no more expensive than any of the other upscale restaurants in the area. You cannot BEAT Makena. Although Wailea is a more expensive area, it is ALSO more crowded, and we enjoyed our seclusion. You can get to any and everything from this hotel in less than 10 minutes. We will definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Such a great hotel!”
<Content>After reading some of the other reviews, I was very nervous about my Honeymoon to Hawaii. First we stayed in a 5 star resort in Waikiki (which was OK at best) and then made our way over to the Maui Prince. I can't tell you how pleased we were! We enjoyed that it was a little further away from the bigger resorts (this was our Honeymoon, after all), and we had a car to take us the the less expensive restaurants. Yes, the restaurants are a little pricey, but they were still less than the resort in Oahu. The rooms were fine, and beautifully cleaned every day. They provided complimentary water and coffee daily, which is also something you don't get everywhere else. With our "partial oceanview room" we saw nothing but ocean and palm trees - simply stunning. The valets were fabulous, always offering directions and recommendations on where to eat and what to do. The snorkeling was great right from the hotel and the beach was great as well. The pool was wonderful, easy to get a chair and a cabana, if you want. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Maui. Don't listen to the bad reviews, people are always more likely to rant rather than rave, they just proved it. But this is one hotel you should rave about!

<Title>“Sorry excuse for a hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this pathetic hotel for the first 5 nights of our honeymoon, which was quite a shame since we had wanted to relax for the first part of our trip. However, we were so disgusted with the Maui Prince that we tried to be around as little as possible. Our room was clean, contrary to other reports, but that is about the only good thing I can say about our stay. Upon check-in, we found our ocean view room had very little view of the ocean, and instead overlooked the tiny pool and a big field which was empty during the day and had an obnoxious "luau" in the evenings with a pathetic lounge singer. Do NOT stay here if you want to relax on your lanai without listening to this lounge singer for 3 hours!! Since we had $100 credit as part of the "Romance Package", we planned to have a nice dinner on Saturday night at the restaurant with an ocean view, and we looked forward to watching the sunset as we ate dinner. However, we were rudely told that the large section of the restaurant with the only good views of the ocean was closed for dinner on Sat. night because it was reserved for the Sunday brunch. Are you joking??!! That was what we thought a lot of the time, when staff were constantly telling us "no" to normal requests. I was even told that they didn't have bread at the restaurant pool to have with my salad. This hotel is far from anything, so not only are you in a crappy hotel, but you are far from anything decent. If you can help it, do NOT stay at the Maui Prince! I would recommend renting a condo, camping, or sleeping in a cardboard box (just kidding about that part!!) before staying at this hotel.

<Title>“The Good and Bad”
<Content>My wife and I just returned from Hawaii of which 5 of our 10 day vacation took place at the Maui Prince Hotel on the island of Maui. The good: 1). Maui is a beautiful island, and the south shore where the Maui Prince is located is particularly beautiful. 2). The Maui Prince is a visually pleasing, moderately priced hotel accentuated by well-kept and aesthetically pleasing grounds. The room had a comfortable king size bed, a tub with a shower and a separate walk-in shower. Great view from lanai ( ocean front room) 3). The beach is a good size, easily accessible and is very good for swimming and snorkeling (Sea Turtles abound). 4). If you golf, there is a beautiful 18 hole course on the grounds of the hotel (a 9 hole mini course as well). The bad: 1). Because of its fairly isolated location, you'll definitely need a rental car to get around, but even more importantly, to take you to affordable restaurants. (We paid $50 including tip for breakfast at the Maui Prince. 2). There is no casual dining at this hotel except at the pool. (There are 2 expensive restaurants). Unless your reservation comes with a meal plan, your best bet is a 15 minute ride to Kihei where you will have several choices. The pool bar, which does have sandwiches at a decent price, is an option for lunch but closes promptly at 6 P.M. 3). 2 swimming pools (not cold as some writers mentioned) but too deep for small children.

<Title>“Great location for relaxation”
<Content>We stayed here for our honeymoon four years ago, and while the rooms are outdated ( and probably even more so now), we found the hotel grounds beautiful and relaxing. The beach is very nice and despite other reviews saying there isn't a lot to do, it depends upon what you're looking for. You are within miles of fantastic beaches and many great restaurants in the Wilea and Kihei area. You just have to ask around or get a good guide book. Also, just down the road from Maui Prince ( down a road that barely looks like a road) heading away from Wailea, there are amazing snorkling pools that you can hike to over lava fields. I think it's one of the prettier areas of Maui and doesn't feel like a tourist trap. However, for the same price, you may be able to find a nicer room elsewhere- I am not sure.

<Title>“Extremely Disappointing!”
<Content>My husband and I went on our honeymoon at the beginning of July and were booked at two Prince Hotels, 1 on the Big Island, 1 on Maui. After staying at the Hapuna Beach Prince hotel on the Big Island, we had high expectations of the Maui Prince Hotel. However, our expectations were not met. When we checked in at the front desk, we asked about a room upgrade since we were on our honeymoon, and we were told that the hotel normally does complimentary upgrades but they did not have anything available since the hotel was booked. That was fine with us, so we went to our room. We got off the elevator and there was our room, right in front of the elevator. Not a good location at all. We opened the door and found our roomm in really bad condition. It was equivalent to a run-down Jersey shore motel, except 3 times the price. Our lanai was extremely dirty (see picture), the carpet was ripped in spots, shower was not clean, and the decor was extremely outdated. The showerhead was like nothing I have ever seen. Our view, which was partial oceanview, was mostly of the roof of some building. Now, we do not complain about things, it has to be VERY bad for my husband or I to speak up and complain about something, and this was bad enough for us to go down to the front desk and let them know how unhappy we were. We could not stay in a room like that for the next 7 nights of our honeymoon. We were told that they might have an oceanfront view room available, that the people who were possibly going to stay in it hadn't called back yet, so that we might be able to stay in that room for an extra $80 a night. They said we could check out that room. So, we went down, got the key, and headed up to that room. It was the same type of room, dirty and outdated, the only difference was a gorgeous view off of the lanai. We werenâ€™t really concerned about the view, so didnâ€™t want to spend $80 more a night for this! We went back down to the front desk, and I asked about the complimentary upgrade we were at first told we couldnâ€™t get. Now that this room was available, wouldnâ€™t this be a free upgrade. We were given some -- story about how since they were booked up it couldnâ€™t be given to us for free. So basically we were lied too, told one thing, then another. I just became angrier and angrier. I asked to speak to the manager, I needed some answers. An assistant manager came out to talk to us. She offered us the oceanview room at $60 more a night. We didnâ€™t want that. We already paid so much to stay here, and the oceanview room wasnâ€™t in any better condition. I felt trapped, and I could feel the tears coming. We were also told before by the man at the desk that if we wanted to leave and cancel our room that they need 72 hours advanced notice or we get charged for the rooms. Thatâ€™s 3 nights, I couldnâ€™t waste 3 nights there! I asked the manager about this and she said she would waive that policy for us if we found somewhere else to stay, she didnâ€™t want us to be trapped on our honeymoon somewhere we were unhappy. So, we went back up to our room and started calling around to other resorts to see if we could be accommodated. My husband was set that he wanted the Four Seasons, and he called and they did have rooms available, just not for the current night, but for the rest of our 6 nights. We got prices, and it would be about $80 more a night for a mountainview room there. So, we booked it. We told the hotel weâ€™d stay the night and cancelled our other nights. We walked around to check out the rest of the Maui Prince. The nicest part of the hotel was their courtyard in the center. It is a garden like setting, with a very nice waterfall and gorgeous koi pond. We checked out the pool, unimpressive. We went down to their beach, nice beach, but beat up beach chairs and umbrellas. Itâ€™s really a shame! All in all, the hotel is in desperate need of an update, and will need it in order to stay in commpetition with the other hotels in Maui that are gorgeous and have comparable prices.

<Title>“Very happy with our Maui Prince honeymoon..”
<Content>Ok, after reading all the reviews, I was a little worried. But now I just wonder if some of these reviewers arent just people with interest in other hotels. We stayed at the Maui Prince for 7 nights in July, we were immediately checked in and told there was a beautiful room waiting...we did not ask for an upgrade, because I already knew all rooms came with an ocean view, our room was clean, smelled nice and was overall a great experience, we ordered room service and ate out on the lanai a couple of times the food was great, listening to the waves crash in. Housekeeping was excellent, our room was cleaned expertly everyday. We went and toured the place, and when we came back there was a chilled bottle of wine from the hotel, since it was our honeymoon. We made great use of the activities people booking different tours, they were great even with stuff we decided to do last minute. I highly reccomend the snorkeling trip that sets off right on the hotel's beach. A valet person offered up an excellent, excellent local breakfast spot. The pool was round and small (there are 2, one for kids, one for adults), but was nice to swim in, the beach was great, on our last morning, there was a turtle swimming right at the water's break. We flew over 12 hours to make it to Maui, so it wouldnt take much for me to find something to complain about, however at the Maui Prince I found nothing short of a great time. It is true that if your looking for nightlife then you should stay in Lahaina, because as anyone will tell you most places are closed after 10pm in Makena and Wailea, but thats not exactly the hotel's fault.... The thing I loved the most was even though the hotel was full, you never had the feeling of crowededness, if you wanted to be off on your own on the beach or anywhere, you could be. I would go back in a heartbeat.

<Title>“extremely disappointed with the facilities here”
<Content>We stayed here on our honeymoon at the beginning of July. I had read many reviews of this hotel before going, so I was prepared for what to expect, yet we were still both disappointed. We had let them know that we were a honeymoon couple in advance, and it was noted when we arrived at the hotel...the person checking us in even remembered to mention it. I asked about the possibility of a room upgrade (we had paid for partial ocean view), and he said he was giving us the best room he had available, but it was still in our same room category....We took the elevator up, only to find that our room was at the very, very end of the hall, as far from the ocean as one could possibly get. Granted, it did have a decent view, but it was a disappointment that the BEST room he could give us was still probably the worst room on the floor. The room was not terrible, but the furnishings were totally out of date...I think these furnishings were modern about 25 years ago. The balcony was dirty. The bathrooms are vile. The shower is basically a hose with a nozzle. Our tub didn't drain well. The toilet area (a separate room) never felt clean. Outside of the room ,the luau took place on the lawn on our side of the hotel. This didn't really bother us, since we were usually out while it was going on, and it was always over by the time we came back (even on our early nights)....the lawn was dark and quiet by 9 PM. The beach was nice, but the chairs the hotel provided were old and dirty, many broken. There were nicer umbrella chairs available for extra $. The pool was small, but we didn't spend too much time there...too many beaches to explore. The hot tub was small and dirty. We really loved being near Wailea however, and this hotel was basically a place to lay our heads at night after exploring the island. It served its purpose, but we wouldn't go back.

<Title>“A Kihei to Wailea Coast tour”
<Content>On this coast you'll be able to sample the budget to luxury gamut when it comes to hotels and restaurants (Kihei being the land of inexpensive hotels and condos to Wailea, the home of 5-star destination resorts for the rich and famous). Our very favorite hotel has always been the Maui Prince because of its location -- not on a hotel strip. It's beach gets bypassed because of glitzy Wailea to the north and popular Big Beach to the south. The snorkeling at Turtle Point can't be beat and general hotel ambiance is oldstyle Hawaii. We've always used the Maui Trailblazer guide for finding things to do in this region. It's also a primo place to Kayak. We find the restaurants on Maui very average and always end up shopping at Safeway and bbq our dinner at the beach parks. Because we've been to Maui over ten times, we often don't venture away from this coast where the sun always seems to be shining.

<Title>“Outstanding Service”
<Content>We just got back from a stay at the Maui Prince Hotel. We were there for four days with our two children, 5 and 8. Upon check-in we were offered a room upgrade and the keys to check out the possible rooms. We chose the Oceanfront Suite, the room was slightly outdated but clean, comfortable and oh what a view! Throughout our stay the service was first rate, in every case hotel personnel bent over backwards to be accomodating to us and especially our children. One Hotel staffer tracked me down after telling me we couldn't use our keike club discount for brunch, told me she was wrong and re-rang the check - actually giving us back our money. Another provided free fish food for my children to feed the koi. The Pool was never crowded and my kids loved the childrens pool. They could have used a little more help with serving guests at the pool deck, but the server was extremely nice and apologized profusely for our wait in service. Yes you could stay some where more posh but you will never find better service anywhere. I understand they are starting a 5 year renovation project shortly. We will definately be back, in fact we are already planning next years trip.

<Title>“Couldn't Have Asked for More!!!”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for our honeymoon May 28 to June 3, 2006. When first arriving we noticed it was a beautiful place to stay. It is nestled at the end of all the hotels at Wailea. This means you are not sandwiched between high rises and toursit attractions. The beach is very private and you do not have to fight the crowds to find the perfect spot. There are no high rises in this stretch which makes the experience that much better. You have wonderful views of both the mountains and the ocean from the balcony. The staff is extremely helpful, everyone is very friendly and accomodating. The rooms are clean and comfortable. They include a programmable safe, refridgerator (stocked with 2 bottles of complimentary water a day!) and a completely private balcony. We did not have any problems with the decor. It was neat and clean which is most important to us in a hotel. Even though its the end of the beach there are more than enough things to do. In fact we had everyday completely filled with activities. You can rent sonorkling and beach equipment right on the beach. The hotel has several restaurants. We did not eat at them during our vacation, however we did order room service. It was delicious, we recommend trying the chocolate chip cookies!! It is also a very romantic to open the glass doors on your balcony, pull the screen doors shut and listen to the waves break on the beach. It is a honeymooners' paradise and we can't wait to go back!! WE LOVE THE MAUI PRINCE!!!!!!

<Title>“Great Hotel, Good Food, Breathtaking Views, Excellent Service!”
<Content>My wife and I are newlyweds and we decided to spend our honeymoon at the Maui Prince Hotel. This was, by far, the best vacation we had ever been on. As we entered the lobby on May 27, 2006, we couldn't help but admire the lush gardens and beautiful grounds of the Maui Prince. Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted and offered some refreshing cool towels to freshen up at the front desk. Since it was our honeymoon, the Maui Prince gladly upgraded our room for FREE. We stayed in room 556. This room had the most breathtaking view of the ocean and the trees surrounding the hotel. The lanai was quite large, which was great for eating dinner while watching the sunset. I have read other reviews on this hotel and have noticed quite a difference in the reviews. It seems that some people either love this hotel or absolutely hate it. The most common complaint about this hotel is the rooms being outdated. While this may be slightly true, the rooms aren't nearly as bad as some guests seem to make it. The room was exceptionally clean and the dual sliding doors to the lanai are wonderful for letting that tropical breeze flow in. I can't understand why some people seem to dislike the hotel in any way. The service here was exceptional. During our stay we took full advantage of the complimentary valet parking and everytime we pulled up to the hotel after a day of fun or wanted to leave for another adventure, we were always greeted with an "aloha" or "welcome back" and everytime we left the hotel we were asked if we needed any directions anywhere. The service made it seem like we were very important. We will certainly stay at the Maui Prince again. Aloha!

<Title>“Happy with the Maui Prince”
<Content>The hotel is in a wonderful setting and the beach directly in front is excellent. We snorkeled everyday and saw a large variety of fish and a lot of turtles. The surf was gentle enough for families to enjoy. We always bring our own fins, masks, and snorkels, but the water sport kiosk rented boogie boards, snorkle equipment, and arranged for excursions of all kinds for what appeared to be reasonable prices. there was also a desk inside the hotel for a trip to Molokini that left from the beach. The pool was small, but adequate for everyone who was there. It was about 3.5 feet in the shallowest area, and there was no kiddie pool. There were plenty of chairs and towels were provided for guests. There was also a bar that served lunches in the afternoons. On several occassions we were sharing snorkeling stories with people on the beach who drove over from the Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, and the Fairmont. They loved their hotels, but loved our beach better. The rooms are nice, and we appreciated having a small refrigerator and complimentary bottled water each day. While we didn't use it, there is also a self-service laundry available. There is also free valet parking and plenty of self-parking. We rented a "prime oceanview". Our first room was on the second floor and overlooked a roof with the ocean behind. I called immediately and told the desk that there was "nothing prime" about that room, and I wasn't going to take it. Maybe because I didn't sound like a younger person, or maybe because the staff had that aloha spirit, we were moved into a room on a higher floor with a much better angle of the water on the otherside of the building. On several nights the hotel put on a HUGE luau for the cruise ships. On other nights, there was also a luau, but not as large. Each night there was a wedding somewhere on the beach. The setting was wonderful and the music and partying always ended by 9pm If you are looking for a lot of nightlife, don't stay in this part of Maui. One afternoon we drove to Lahaina, and it took almost 2 hours. It wasn't so much the distance as the traffic. Very bad. We have been to the other islands numerous times and have always loved the Kona area. Since we hadn't been to Maui in 20 years, we thought we would give it another chance. The traffic, the endless construction projects (large condo developments, housing tracts, roads, strip malls), and the high prices were really hard to enjoy. I know Hawaii is expensive, but Maui seemed worse than anywhere else we have been, and we were in Kona just last year. If I go back to Maui, I would enjoy a stay at the Maui Prince, but I don't care to go back to Maui. If you look out at the ocean, it is breathtaking. If you turn around though, you are anywhere.

<Title>“Wished we stayed somewhere else”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the hotel May 16 thru the 21 of 2006 I had read all the bad reviews before we went and we talked with are travel agent about the problems with the hotel. She called Classic Vactions whom they use to book the trip with and asked about the hotel and the things we read about. They assure us that this is a vey nice hotel and not to read to much into the bad reviews. Well guess what, the reviews we read were right and they were wrong. The hotel room we got smelled bad, the wall paper was coming off, and the partial ocean view was of a golf course with a utility shed. I called are travel agent and left a message, because of the 6 hour time difference, about how all the bad reviews we read were right. Thankfully, the next day, she was able to have us move from room 208, which if you are facing the ocean is on the left side of the hotel, to room 416. We had a better veiw and the room was in a little better shape. The decor of the rooms is very out-dated, but most of all the rooms need to be remodeled badly. As for the hotel staff the valet guys were very nice and helpful, but after we got are room changed the staff at the front desk didn't seem as friendly as they were when we had arrived. So my advise, I would pick somewhere else to stay, because not only of the run down hotel rooms, also because you are pretty far south and there isn't much around as far as places to eat. Oh by the way gas is or at least it was 3.66 a gallon. But if you don't mind the run down rooms, or the very high price restaurant and driving 20 to 40 minutes to see or do anything, and have the bucks to blow this is the place for you.

<Title>“quiet and a nice beach”
<Content>We splurged and got an oceanfront room - not sure it's worth the extra amount, since we spent most of our stay outside on the lovely beach in front of the hotel. It was a beautiful view, though. Good snorkeling and rentals (sun umbrellas, boogie boards, etc.) at the beach. Room was clean and quiet. Breakfast buffet was overpriced for so-so food - after the first day, we drove to Kihei for breakfast. However, we had an excellent dinner at Hakone, the Japanese restaurant on the premises. We've stayed at many places in Maui over the years, and we decided we'll return to the Maui Prince next year.

<Title>“Perfect Romantic Getaway!!!”
<Content>Maui Prince was not the first choice for us when we were looking for a hotel, but we were very happy to have chosen it for our Honeymoon. It is the perfect place for anyone seeking a quiet romantic and peaceful time. We had a pretty good view of the ocean and west Maui. The rooms were clean and nice. The staff was very courteous and helpful. The gardens were beautifully designed and well maintained. We booked through Expedia and the fun desk staff (Aribe and Angel) were both great and helped us plan our vacation perfectly. Besides couples like ourselves, we also saw kids having a great time at the beach and by the pool. So don't be fooled into thinking this place is only for couples. The beach was hardly crowded and was very private. Overall, we had a blast and will definitely come back again. Do remember to plan your vacation properly and you will hardly mind the long drives to any sight seeing spots from the hotel.

<Title>“Please don't stay here!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here for the final two days of our honeymoon much to our regret. We had great expectations of relaxing in an Ocean View room - but could not see the ocean from the room and only a partial view from the lanai. We complained that the room we were given was only a partial ocean view. I was appalled when the front desk rudely told us that we should have read the fine print - an ocean view room is if you can see part of the ocean from any where on the lanai. When we tried to work with the front desk for a room closer to our expectations they asked for an additional $443 per night - too much for us to afford. We were so disappointed I wanted to move to another hotel, but the front desk informed us that since we didn't cancel 72 hours in advance we would be charged for the room anyway. This was a disappointing end to our honeymoon and we would recommend that you choose another hotel. Thank you.

<Title>“excellent beach-attentive staff”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince in Sept 05 for our wedding and honeymoon--booked an ocean front for 260 a night which was a deal. We absolutely loved the hotel--it's quiet and laid back, but the staff was so attentive-offering us recommendations for dinner and activities that were right on! the beach in front of the hotel is the best--you can snorkel for hours and see lots of turtles. It also is a lot bigger than other ones in Wailea. We went to the other beaches just to check them out and always came back to ours! It was a waste to go on the snorkel trips after snorkeling on this beach! The Prince Court had a wonderful Friday night buffet with the freshest sashimi and poke. The room was fine, excellent view for sunset. You can always visit the more expensive hotels during the day if you really want to, but why pay 400 a night to stay there! The pool isn't great, but why go in the pool in Maui!!!! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to relax and have a peaceful experience!

<Title>“Great value at the Maui Prince”
<Content>This resort is an exceptional value. It's rooms are little small, but offer a seating area, and a nice sized lanai. It has complimentary valet service, and a fantastic beach. In fact, when in town, the locals suggested we go to the beach in front of the Maui Prince in order to get good sea turtle views when snorkeling--we were already staying there! The pool is small, but offers drinks and sandwiches, and towel service. But, the beach in front of the resot is the draw, when it comes to swimming. There is a fabulous breakfast buffet, and the Japanese resturant is good, too. Plus, there are dorm fridges in the rooms, which was great for feeding our hungry 2-year old. Overall, this was a great stay for the money.

Pool is very mediocre. The place shoud consider a makeover. On the upside, golf courses on the property were spectacular. Bring cat food for the feral cats.

<Title>“Totally Laid Back”
<Content>The MP was a great choice considering the other very pricey hotels in Wailea. Not to say that $260 per night is cheap. The weather here is the best on Maui. The hotel beach is lovely and private. Better than the beach in Wailea. The staff is more than terrific! The hotel is close to the nude beach called Little Beach (no tan lines) and Big Beach (which is the preetiest beach in the area). It's true the rooms need to be updated however and the pool is uninspiring. It was a very relaxing stay all in all. I would recommend The Grand Wailea as well because it has a fun livley pool with water falls and slides etc. I think it would be nice to split ones stay between the two hotels in order to experience both atmospheres. If you get a chance to island hop with Pacific Wings I highly recommend it! Amazing and beautiful experience (not to mention the very hot pilots)!

<Content>We Stayed at the Maui Prince Hotel from April 12-18th. The grounds and beach were nice but I was not not to impressed with the rooms. They need to update the rooms and bathrooms. The service was good but the pools need to be updated too. I kindof have a hard comparison because I have stayed at the Four Seasons Maui and that is hard to beat. All in all Maui was wonderful and we had a great time.

<Title>“Hated the Maui Prince”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for the final 3 days of our vacation. Upon arriving, we found that we could not have the room we had reserved because we had 3 children. The front desk clerk offered us an upgrade for an extra $100 for a one bedroom suite, adding that it was normally a $700 a night room. When we were able to check-in, I had to go back to the front desk twice because the key cards they gave us didn't work. The view from our room which was supposed to be an ocean view, was the parking lot out of the main room and onto trees and grass clippings from the bedroom. Our room was dirty, the sticky spots on the floor never did get wiped up even though I moved the furniture so that it was apparent to housekeeping staff. The room was dated and the lighting almost non-existent. Staff at the restaurants were rude. It almost seemed as if we were interupting them just to get seated. We attended the Sunday Brunch which, for some reason, is voted one of the best on Maui. They seated us just about as far away as possible from the buffet even though we had three children that would be carrying plates of food back to the table. When I paid our cheque, the waitress did not bring back the change, she didn't even look at us again when she went past. The pool area is dirty and the lunch we had there was a completely ridiculous price. The hallways are filthy. I noticed staff sweeping one morning but not mopping. We walked over the same spots(looked like squashed berries and old gum)every day. In the shop in the lobby both times we shopped there, we had to hear all about the scheduling problems the staff were experiencing as the clerk there didn't bother to put down the phone to serve us. We wouldn't make a return trip to this resort.

<Title>“The Prince is KING!!!”
<Content>Just got back from a 10 day trip to Maui with my wife and 15 yr old daughter. We spent 5 nights at the Prince and 4 nights in Ka'anipali at the Maui Westin. Being our first time to Hawaii and to Maui we wanted to get a different feel for the island by splitting up our stay. All I have to say is that we are sorry we left the Prince. Forget the complaints about the 'poolside service' or the 'decore'. The prince is a well maintained, VERY accomidating hotel. We were there with a mostly booked hotel and we felt we had the place to ourselves most the time. NO crowds, great beach, great golf!! Our time at the Westin was like being in Times Square at rush hour. TOO MANY PEOPLE!! If you wantd to sit by the pool you had to be armed and ready to grab a chair by 7am..if not forget it. Unlike the Prince where we always found PLENTY of space to be alone either by the pool or the beach. We will definatley be back to the Maui Prince!!

<Title>“Nice hotel and beach”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Maui Prince for our 20th anniversary. As this was our first time to Maui, we had no other hotels to compare it to. We did find a very nice hotel with exceptional staff, unlike one of the recent reviewers. The hotel itself is open with a high-ceiling foyer as you walk in with beautiful mahogany shutters and moulding. The rooms were average size with somewhat outdated furnishings, but we spent very little time in the room and so were not concerned. Our room was cleaned spotlessly every day for us, and the staff helpful and friendly. Don't rent the snorkels there though, $$$. Go to Bob's up the road. The beach at the hotel was one of the best we found for snorkeling. Also purchase an entertainment book if staying for a week or more. It came in handy

<Title>“Service, views, food and fun pack a punch!”
<Content>1) Service - we have never felt so welcomed and made to feel so comfortable as we were at the Maui Prince this past week. From the valet to maid service, room service to front desk we were addressed by name, with a smile and a sincere sense they were there to make our day. Even just passing in the elevators, the staff would smile and say hello. They had personality!!! 2)Ocean views!!! No rooms face the interior; smart design for a beach front hotel. The interior area is an open atrium type meditation garden, beautifully landscaped with waterfalls that feed into a koi pond. Found myself enjoying the front door view as much as the lanai view. 3) Food - We ate lunch at the pool twice, used room service for 1 breakfast and 1 dinner, 1 breakfast at the cafe and had Sunday brunch at the Palm Court. Everything was fresh, full of flavor, and bountiful. Consistent high quality everytime. Probably gained a few pounds because it was all so good. 4) Fun ... we enjoyed a day snorkeling with reservations in house and departure right there from the beach at the hotel. It is 20 minutes to Molokini from the hotel, instead of the normal hour for most other tour companys. Then the Luau couldn't have been more fun and so convenient to have it right there at the resort. And not least, it is just a short drive to one of the most beautiful beaches on Maui - Big Beach. Without a doubt, future visits to Maui will be at the Maui Prince Hotel for us. Rental car a definite must if you plan on meandering the island. Is it the newest, shiniest hotel along the south beach area? No ... but it makes up for it tenfold with the highest level of service, food, views and activities.

<Title>“Quiet, relaxing, and a great HONEYMOON!!!!”
<Content>Just got back from our honeymoon. 6 nights at the Prince was wonderful. A nearly book hotel, but somehow we felt like we were the only ones there! Staff was great. We loved the free valet parking and shuttle rides to Wailea. The pool may be small, but we fully enjoyed relaxing in our choice of lounge chairs(as opposed to fighting for ones at some of the other resorts). Beach is close to the resort and very nice as well(calm waters). The food is pricey, but tell me where in Maui it isn't? The best thing my wife and I enjoyed at the Prince was the relaxing atmosphere. If you are looking for activities every second and large waterslides in your pools, this is not the place for you. If you(like me and my wife) are looking for a great quality hotel with an amazingly peaceful and relaxing atmosphere to vacation at, this place is perfect. We would definitely go back again!

<Title>“Stay somewhere else”
<Content>I have been traveling to Maui for 20 years and I have stayed at many hotels in Wailea, but never the Maui Prince. So I decided that I would try the Maui Prince to see how it compared to the other hotels. It is not up to par with any of the other hotels in Wailea. The rooms are small, noisy, uncomfortable and out dated. The pool was also a huge disapointment, it is about a 1/4 of the size of all of the other hotels. Most of all the costmer service was extremely disapointing, I would almost say rude at some points. You are better off staying at one of the other hotels in Wailea.

<Title>“maui prince is great as usual”
<Content>we have recently stayed at the maui prince for the second time. We absolutely love it. We are from oahu and never seem to want to come home when we stay there. The rooms are great and big compared to a lot of other resorts. The bathrooms are big offering a shower and a tub and the toilet is separate and has a door to close it off to the rest of the bathroom. Nice size refrigerator as we stayed elsewhere in maui where you could not fit anything into those fridges. I have never had a problem with the check-in although we never arrive before 300PM because they do tell you check in time is 300PM and not just the prince, but every hotel. The hotel business is complex and it's not that they are trying to scam you, but there are procedures and way of assigning rooms and the maids can only clean so fast with all those rooms. I think the hotel is great and the price is good. The pool tiles were being fixed when we were there so they have taken care of that. The luau was going on when we were there too and it was fun to watch. It doesn't go til late and it depends which room you have whether you can really see and hear it. Most people are usually out and about and don't get back til after it's done anyway. sometimes you have to revert to the term you get what you pay for and at the prince I think you get what you pay for and then some. If you want to pay double the price to stay at resorts in that same area then go for it. I don't think people should expect to get a room on the four seasons level for the price they are paying which really isn't much compared to other hotels in the area. The remote controls in our rooms which we have had a total of 3 different rooms so far were never attached to the tv. There is a game controller attached to the tv stand, but the remote was not. The restaurant we ate at was the breakfast buffet at cafe kiowai and we liked it every time. They do allow children 5 and under to eat free. My son is 4 and thoroughly enjoyed his breakfast. I don't think that 20.00 is asking to much to pay for an all you can eat buffet stocked with meats, eggs, fruits, salad, rice, pastries, cereal, yogurt , omlet station, waffles, and even more. If we had to pay for him to eat we would have done so as he enjoys eating there. If the menu states a price for cold breakfast and a price for hot breakfast then you pay for what you take. I would definately recommend this hotel and would stay there again and am planning on staying again. Basically the hotel has rules and the complaints I have been reading are of rules that are stated but people get upset when they don't make an exception for them.

<Title>“Great Resort”
<Content>I was a little nervous about the Maui Prince because of some of the bad reviews however it wasn't so bad. The resort was very clean and the staff was very helpful. The rooms were big and spaceous with a great view. True, the furniture was a bit outdated but who cares unless you plan to stay in your room the whole trip. The hotel sits out by itself with no other resorts near it, but not to far away from all the excitement. We saw whales right off the resort beach. As stated before, if you want luxury go to the Four Seasons but if you want stay at an above average resort stay here. Actually we saved lots of $$$$$$ by staying here. We had enough savings to take several extra excursions.

<Title>“Terrific Stay!”
<Content>Just returned from a three day stay at the Maui Prince. I really enjoyed the location because it's away from the other hotels in Wailea and feels like a private retreat. There is a wonderful stretch of sandy beach right in front of the hotel with good snorkeling. Lots of sea turtles. There are no extra charges like the other resorts in Wailea which was a bonus. No resort fee or charges for parking (self or valet). There was a compimentary empty mini-fridge in the room (great for stashing sodas or beers). No charge for the in room safe. Two bags of free coffee replenished every day (two of regular and two decaf). There's also a comp shuttle to the shops in Wailea if you don't have a car. Also two comp bottles of water in the frig. All rooms are ocean view or partial ocean view so you can go to sleep with the lanai doors open (there are screens to block out bugs) and listen to the waves crashing. Very relaxing! The staff was super friendly-front desk to housekeeping. The grounds were meticulously maintained- lush landscaping, waterfalls, koi pond, and beautiful flowers. Also a plus for me was that the hotel appeared to be adult oriented- mostly honeymooners and older couples. A staff members said that the Maui Prince averaged four weddings a day! There were no hordes of kids running around (unlike one or two hotels in Wailea which seemed Disney-like with water slides and screaming kids). I like my peace and quiet on vacation and the Maui Prince provides it. I guess the only negative was that the hotel is somewhat dated, but extremely clean and well maintained. It's also half the price of the other resorts in Wailea- $307 vs. $600. If you want more luxurious, pay double somewhere else.

<Title>“Great Location, So nice we got married there!”
<Content>The Maui Prince is a great hotel, and perfect for location and a relaxed feeling. It's not a fancy bells and all hotel, (you know which ones I mean, if your not a millionaire you get scoffed at!!!) But It's a lovely hotel and the atrium with the open gardens in the middle, chills you out the minute you arrive. It's the last hotel at the bottom of the island, which I preferred, to be away from everybody else, for that Island feeling. Yet during the day for something to do besides the pool and beach, you are better to head up 10mins to Kihei Centre, which has everything you need ie shops, restaurants, beaches, activities etc, then disappear back to the quiet recluse of the Maui Prince. I wanna go back soooooo badly!!

<Title>“Perfect for Laid Back Solitude”
<Content>My husband had been refusing to go to Hawaii due to concerns about overcrowding and too touristy destinations. So when I read the reviews on trip advisor for the Maui Prince, I knew it was the place for us. Away from the other resorts, completely laid back without any snobbishness or over-attentiveness on the part of the staff, it seemed like we were there almost by ourselves, even though the place was fully booked. I like to stay in nice places, whereas my husband would probably prefer sleeping in a tent in the wilderness. Good compromise, as the furnishings were nice and comfortable but not so plush as to offend his sensibilities. If you're looking for the Ritz, this is not it. No crowds, no glitz. The food was very good, and although expensive, was no more than most other places. The luau was not worth the price, and could have been easily crashed (without the food). The location was very close to Ahihi-Kinau preserve which had some good hiking trails and excellent snorkeling. I took a horseback tour from Makena Stables in the preserve, and it was pricy but very good. We saw wild goats and deer. We never even went on the main drag of Kihei, but woke early (still on Massachusetts time) to hike in Haleakala and drive to Hana. No crowds if you leave early even in high season. It rained almost everywhere else we went, but no rain in Makena (averages 10 inches per year vs. 400 inches per year in Hana). Since we came during whale season, we spent a lot of time from our lanai whale-watching. Don't forget to pack your binoculars. Great trip, almost worth a 13 hour flight.

<Title>“Tip top hotel”
<Content>Stayed at the Maui prince for two weeks at the beginning of Jan, with my seven year old daughter. We had an amazing time, the hotel was bright and airy, with beautiful well maintained gardens. The Koi carp pond is spectacular. The beach is clean and snorkeling is a must. The pools although a little cool are of adequete size to keep a seven year old amused. The resturants are a little pricey but well worth a visit. We also went whale watching off the beach, which was superb, the crew was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Our room, with sea view, was spacious and kept spotless throughout our 14nts stay. Staff stay in the background but are available and curteous when needed. The hotel was in a quiet location away from the hussle and bussle of the larger hotels, just perfect. It was extremely sad to leave.

<Title>“The Best Beach.....Still”
<Content>We had another great stay at the Maui Prince. This was our 2nd stay in a year, enjoyed it even more. We stayed for 6 nights. The beach is outstanding. There were times when my kids and I were the only ones swimming in the ocean, its that private! This trip we decided not to rent any beach equipment from the hotel. Instead we bought everything either in town or at a shop in Wailea. The kids also get a gift bag when you check in with a bucket, shovel, beach ball and a few others. I can't say enough about the staff, they are so friendly. The employees at the coffee shop are great, I am now hooked on Kona Coffee. It is true that the pool is not huge but you hardly see anyone swimming in it anyways. The pool area is however quite large. Yes, the restaurants are very expensive. We had steaks on Monday night, then the next morning had Sunday Brunch. Food was great but you will go broke unless you venture out. The Seawatch is just a few minutes away in the Golf course. Food is outstanding with reasonable prices, at least for lunch. We also decided to make the trip to Hana, on the other side of the island. If you have kids....don't do it. The ride is slow (3.5hrs) on little roads with one car only bridges. My kids were carsick and my wife too tense to even speak. I found the views were awesome. You will see waterfalls and lush green everywhere, but its not worth it. There was nothing in Hana. Make sure you visit the Maui Plantation and take the 45min tour through pinnapples, coconut trees, macadamia nut trees, all the local flowers and fruit. It is a group tour which pulls you through the grounds on a little train like thing. It was really cool. Anyways, the hotel is great dont be scared away by the bad reviews. To us it is clean, quiet, relaxing and still has the best beach on Maui. We will be back soon.

<Title>“4th visit, excellent as ever”
<Content>This was my 4th visit to the Maui Prince in 4 years, and I am pleased to say that it remains as good as ever. The hotel feels open and spacious, the grounds and beach quite beautiful. The pool area was small, but it was usually almost empty (the hotel was 100% full my first weekend, but nobody was around the pool). The beach was never crowded. The room was fine, OK not the most luxurious you could imagine, but everything worked and the room was kept spotlessly clean by the maid service. I have read adverse comments about the bathrooms --- seemed fine to me, I've suffered many much worse. I've read some complaints about the sheets --- mine were soft and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable, the room furniture was fine, and the lighting tastefully done (but a dim light on the lanai would have been a nice touch) This year there were finally electronic key-cards -- on my previous visits we had to lug around a great big brass key. Nice touches - the big blue beach towels, the bathrobes, bottles of water replenished each day, a little box of chocolates on my bed on the last night, more towels than I knew what to do with in the bathroom. Although I was on the side overlooking the lawn where the rather cheesy "luau" is performed, the view over to the Pu'uola'i cinder cone is magnificent, and in any case the "luau" was generally over by 2030. I did not eat in the restaurents --- highly overpriced, but made my own breakfast brought from Wailea (and the lobby coffee shop), and enjoyed it on the lanai each morning. The coffee shop staff knew my usual order, and always called me my name. This is a 500 room hotel, but the staff give a personal service. The remoteness of the site is one of its appeals, if it is bright lights and clubs then go to Kihei (or don't come to Maui!) You need a car to get around, but one of the major highlights of my trip was a glass of wine on the lanai last thing at night, followed by a walk along the beach under the stars. Magical. I went to sleep each night with the lanai doors fully open, with the crash of the surf on the beach. Downsides ? Only a few. (1) There was a cockerell somewhere in the grounds that gave me an unwelcome early morning wake-up call (about 0400) each day. I would have to shut the doors to drown out the noise, and spend the next 20 minutes plotting the demise of that cockerell until sleep returned! (2) On my previous visits, the hotel had very nice Prince Hotels scented soaps and shampoos. This year it was standard packaged "Neutrogena" stuff which reminds me of chain budget hotels. (3) My room was close right next to one of the lift lobbies, and there was a rather loud and irritating "boing boing" everytime the lift (sorry, that's a British term, I mean the elevator) arrived at my floor. (4) And my last two evenings on the lanai with some wine and listening to the Pacific waves were spoiled by the people in the room above with their TV on far too loud. I did not travel nearly half way round the world to listen to canned laughter from some ghastly American sit-com! Overall: a great place to relax. Eat out (its cheaper) but the accomodation is good, the staff excellent, the location fantastic.

<Title>“Relaxation”
<Content>My wife and I are expecting our first child in June and decided to take a trip before our life turns upside down, a sort of "Babymoon"(honeymoon before the baby comes). I read the reviews of this place here and decided it sounded like the right place for us. We were interested in a quite relaxing time to sit on the beach, snorkel, and do some sight seeing. There were a number of reviews here that knock the hotel for it's age but we felt the hotel and the rooms were kept up nicely. Everything was very clean and in working order. I felt the price we paid about $250 a night for an ocean front room was very reasonable. Especially since the hotels next door that others are comparing it to, the Grand Wilea, the Kea Lani, etc are over $500 a night. The restaurants were OK, the food was good, and the prices were a little high, but hey, this is Maui. We enjoyed the free parking and complementary valet. The beach chairs were also free to use, not the case at all the resorts in this area. The beach was beautiful. Calm waters and excellent reef snorkeling right off shore. We saw many fish and got to swim with a family of sea turtles! The staff was very helpful and courteous. We had a late flight home, 10:30pm, and the hotel offers departing guests use of a hospitality room for cleaning up after use of the beach etc. Overall a very nice experience and we would stay there again.

<Title>“$39.99 for a room in Hawai`i is sorry to say but considered dirt cheap.”
<Content>I just had to laugh at the previous review about someone barging in to the room booming ALOOOHA! That's the local way. I don't know if he came to your room by mistake but I know a lot of locals in Hawai`i are being displaced by the booming real estate market. It's cheaper to stay in a hotel than pay rent here sometimes. In Hawai`i, the median home is more or less at $600,000 depending on what island. Maui is at the more side. And we still share our snacks! So $39.99 for a hotel room is dirt cheap.

<Title>“Loved the Prince”
<Content>We loved our stay at the Prince and hated to come home. To provide a bit of context, we were choosing between the 4 and 5 star hotels on Wailea--Wailea Grand, Renaissance, Fairmont, etc... We went with the Prince and in no way regretted it. Those other resorts are DEFINITELY more luxurious. So if you want 5-star luxury in your room, you'll be dissapointed in the Prince. What the Prince offers is seclusion and peace and quiet. We first visited The Wailea Grand and Fairmont for dinner. Nick's at the Fairmont is one of the finest eating experiences we have ever had. We were envious. Then, we visited the Grand, Fairmont, Renaissance, etc... during the day. UGH! CHILDREN HELL! They were so crowded on the grounds and around the pool, also felt crowded on the beach. None of that at the Prince--very peaceful and NOT crowded (and apparently they were close to capacity when we were there). If you want amazing pools, you won't like the Prince--it has a clean, simple round pool--rather small. However, who wants a pool when you go to Maui? The beach is around 1/4 mile long. It's a beautiful beach, and here's one of the #1 reasons to choose the Prince--there is a turtle cleaning station right on the rocks on the left side of the beach. It is fabulous--you walk right out and every day can swim along side the giant sea turtles. People from other resorts travel down to the Prince for the experience! The other main reason we loved the Prince was the proximity to the beach. While the other large resorts were set back 100 yards from the beach or more, the Prince is right there. We laughed with other guests about our experience of sleeping with the sliding doors wide open to the sound of crashing waves. Lovely. The biggest downside is probably that the rooms themselves fall somewhere between 3-star and 4-star. If a super luxury room is what you want, you might be dissapointed with the Prince. We cared less about that than the proximity to the beach. Also, the hotel was apparently nearly at capacity when we were there, but it sure felt like there weren't that many people around. There are several very nice restaurants at the Prince. As with all eating out on Maui, it is pricey! It wasn't a problem for us, but there is a louao (bad spelling, sorry) 3 or 4 nights per week. There is one side of the Prince that faces the event--the drums might bother you. However, avoid this problem by reserving a room away from that side of the hotel. The Prince is about a 5 minute drive past all of the other resorts toward the lava field. This results in the wonderful seclusion of the hotel. There is an amazing koi pond and the grounds are wonderfully maintained. If you want to go to the other resorts, the Prince offers complimentary transportation to any of the resorts on Wailea. What else...one of the snorkel services to Molokini leaves right off the Prince beach. The lava fields are about a 15 minute drive away--they will eat your shoes up, so be careful! We rented from Snorkel Bob's--found the equipment to be good at a good prince. We found what we think is the best snorkeling on the island (according to some locals). If you head about 10 minutes from the Prince toward the lava fields, the little road goes around a cove with houses. I think it's called the fishbowl or something like that (the aquarium?). It looks like NOTHING from the road. But when you wade in, you are greeted by hundreds of fish! We preferred this spot to Molokini. If we return to Maui, we will probably return to the Prince. The rooms are a little older and less luxurious than the other 5 star resorts on Wailea. But the seclusion and hearing the waves from your room and the turtles on the beach daily left us feeling completely satisfied with our choice.

The room was very clean and comfortable and had a good veiw of ocean. The meals from the restuarants as well as room service was prompt and delicious. The snorkleing off the beach was great...and if you adventure the back side of golf course you will find yourself at the base of a huge cindercone and a beautiful beach. We will go back again.

<Content>Very peaceful hotel with wonderful garden and cute Koi that come up to you knowing they will be fed. The stroll to the beach is easy the staff is very helpful. Those big brown doors are shutters in case of a storm and I find them to be very attractive (Key Largo-ey). Our room was fresh, attractive and quiet. The view was partial ocean and was a delightful place to stay. The pool is quiet not having a bunch of screaming, jumping kid, etc. All in all a very nice vacation because after all, vacations are what you make them to be and if you simply ask respectfully, the staff will help you resolve any issues.

<Title>“Worst hotel Ever.”
<Content>The 'Beach View' rooms are not beach View. The Management is friendly but does absolutely nothing about addressing issues. They have a check in scam - most flights arrive in the mornign, and although they have many vacant rooms, they insist that you wait by the pool and possibly have lunch to pass the time. The restaurant is very sub standard. The rooms are smelly. The furniture is clean but 60's inspired (and I use the term inspired loosly). The Pool tiles were cracked. The only plus was the beach staff who were very polite and helpful. I would not return and do not recommend this overated, overpriced, poorly run excuse for a hotel.

<Content>I thought the hotel was pretty nice... I don't remember a whole lot about the rooms, but I don't remember being offended by anything. Except we had major trouble getting the key to work in the door and finally someone had to spray inside the lock with something, and so everytime we used our key it was covered with black yuk that we had to wipe off. The ground are pretty nice, I liked the Japanese Garden and the koi were too cool. The beach outside the hotel was great for snorkeling. I didn't go out very far, so didn't see alot of interesting coral, but saw several different kinds of fish including the 2 types of trigger fish which are real pretty, convict tang, and a sea snake. And a turtle! We did think that the location was pretty far out of the way from other things, though. Seemed like we did a lot of driving to go see everything and at the end of a long day, we were like "Are we there yet?!?!"

<Title>“Shocked to see positive reviews”
<Content>This has to be one of, if not the, worst places I've ever stayed--considering the price--and certainly the weirdest. We only stayed here one night. We were previously at the nearby Marriott for 8 days and were able to extend our trip by one night, so we went through Priceline again. When "Maui Prince" came up on Priceline, I cried tears of both laughter and horror because we'd been to the Prince a few days prior for brunch and wondered why--at similar prices to other, nicer resorts--anyone would stay there. The old brown room doors face the lobby and look like a prison. No windows on that side. Although it's open air, the property still manages to be stinky and as another reviewer wrote, smell of mildew. We walked into our nonsmoking room which smelled of years of smoking through a rickety, banged up wooden door. The bedspread looked like a small animal got a hold of it and gnawed for a few hours. The bed was very uncomfortable, and the room was spacious in a creepy way. The TV remote is connected to the tv, so a wire dangles in front of it while viewing. No, I don't go to a resort to watch a tv, but something so outmoded should not be in a room that's over $39.99/night. We were in the room about 20 min. when someone walked in, unanounced/no knocking, and shouted "ALOHAAAAA" and offered us snacks. Very random and strange, I found it amusing but would not have had I been asleep or undressed! The bathroom was unreal. It cracked me up...yellowed plastic shower curtain hooks, crazy, dated pseudo-tropical decor, and it even had one of those old Clairol make-up mirrors, where you switch the "lighting" to office, night, etc. Drumroll... it was BROKEN, so basically there was just a clunky piece of discolored plastic taking up counter space. The toilet is literally in a closet attached to the bathroom. The bathroom sink made a very loud howling noise everytime we turned it on for 2-3 minutes. The restaurants are not attractive. We ate at Prince Court, which was below average food and very pricey. No cheaper than Grand Wailea, which is nuts when you're sitting on old vinyl and an atmosphere barely above IHOP. The pool bar is a tiny hut and very limited. Again, no cheaper than any other resorts. The pool is round and small with extremely limited poolside service. The pool towels I got for the beach smelled smoky. One plus--the beach is really wonderful! Very close to the property and peaceful. While lying on the beach, I was thinking that Prince really should market itself as a lower-priced option and charge less, or do some serious renovation, but with the amount of money it would take to bring it even close to modern, I can't imagine the rates could still compete with other properties. Please note: I am someone who is not particularly uptight and I love kitsch. I thought I might actually be amused to make it through one night. Nope. I left feeling exhausted and dirty. I've never written a review here, but thought it was my duty to warn others the minute I got home!

<Title>“Average - Nice Open Air Feel”
<Content>Upon arriving for two nights at the Maui Prince I was pleased with the location (a bit off the beaten path, but not too much so...near enough to shopping/restaurants). Great proximity to the beach. Pool lovely but service hit-or-miss. The hot tub is your average "home style" hot tub; nothing spectacular. Cabanas on the beach, etc. for rent with umbrellas. No drinks on the beach (!) but around the pool the staff serves drinks and a pricey bar food menu. Beach is rather smallish and specifically deeded to this hotel. For an asian (Japanese) inspired hotel, I was very surprised they did not have a dry sauna, steam rooms, whirlpool baths (as with any upper-end hotel/spa anywhere else). The massage I had with Renee was, however, one of the best. I was in bliss. The massage/facial room was a converted hotel room, but well appointed with appropriate lighting, etc. Food at this hotel was so-so. Room service was prompt and had my orders correct with appropriate condiments. This hotel is in need of an update. Reminds me a bit of a 1960's theme hotel, but with Koi fish instead of Mickey Mouse. I hope they will add an Asian style spa with any upcoming renovations should they be forthcoming. Overpriced in my view for what we got. The "upgrade" to the view of the beach from our lanai was not really valid. The beach was there - I could hear it - but had to crane my neck to see a glimpse of it. Rooms a bit dingy, but not dirty. Bathroom definitely nothing special.

<Content>The view from our superior room was fantastic but from that point this hotel went down hill fast. Expensive and indifferent food rather tatty and the noise each night as the Lu- au churned out the so called local culture under our window was intollerable. Maui is civilised and very manicured, if this is what you want, then try a different hotel.

<Title>“I wanted to love it ...”
<Content>... but I'm afraid I can't recommend the Maui Prince. 1) As other posters have pointed out, the rooms badly need an update. Our room (#249) featured all the telltale signs of a hotel awaiting remodel: unsightly scuff marks on the walls, chipped and scratched closet doors, discolored bathroom tile, etc. Staff keeps the facilities clean enough, but the problems that exist are beyond the scope of chambermaids. (Although one note about those maids: At the beginning of our stay, I spied a dead insect under the desk while plugging in my Blackberry adapter. When I unplugged the adapter six days later, the bug was still there. I suppose at that point I could have disposed of the thing, but I wasn't in the most charitable mood by then.) 2) Restaurant prices are sky-high all over Maui, but the Prince deserves a special booby prize for its daily breakfast buffet. My wife and I, with our six-year-old daughter in tow, made the mistake of eating there several times (I know, we were asking for trouble, but it's a 10-minute drive to any resort in Wailea, which isn't necessarily what we felt like doing at 8 in the morning). The total charge was $60, which seemed awfully high considering a spread that was OK but certainly not spectacular by resort standards. But what really steamed me was the dual pricing scheme for "hot" and "cold" breakfasts, especially for kids. Our daughter picked at some cereal and fruit, which kept her on the "cold" side priced at $8. But when she sipped a bit of miso soup, the price suddenly climbed to $12 -- for the "hot" breakfast. I complained first to the waiter and then to Scott, the assistant manager, who listened sympathetically, said my feedback was important -- and then did absolutely nothing except invite me to join the Prince's loyalty program. Memo to management: If I'm going to pay you $23 per adult for a mediocre buffet, do you mind if my kid eats for free? Or would you prefer that families go somewhere else? (NB: Hapuna Beach Prince, the Maui Prince's sister property on the Big Island, has a superior buffet -- that's included in the room price!) 3) Service is uneven throughout the hotel. One day, we searched in vain for someone, anyone, to offer service by the pool. The towel kiosk was vacant. To order drinks, my wife had to retrieve a waitress from the restaurant inside the hotel ("We're understaffed," the hostess complained.) Scott, the assistant manager, promises that the hotel recently hired a new food & beverage manager who will help prevent such miscues. But this person will have his hands full: during our second dinner at the Prince Court, the hotel's signature fine-dining restaurant, we alerted our server, as the appetizers were arriving, that we still had no napkins. She looked at our laps and said: "Oh, that's not good, is it?" No, at these prices, it sure isn't. 4) One seemingly minor point that actually seriously hampers enjoyment of the resort: The property is very poorly illuminated. Apparently to save money, management has installed only path lights on the cobblestone walk tracing the perimeter of the resort. The tall palms on the property cry out for low-angle floods but remain shrouded in darkness. As a result, at night the grounds seem uninviting and even a little scary. Most folks wouldn't feel safe walking around alone outside the main building or parking lot -- it's just too dark. Assistant manager Scott offered two reasons for the lack of light: 1) Maui has codes restricting bright lights (someone should tell that to the Grand Wailea, which is lit up like a Christmas tree) and 2) the hotel needs to upgrade its electrical service. Whatever the case, the hotel needs to lighten up. Don't get me wrong: The Maui Prince has many virtues, including a prime beach location, proximity to many activities, and relatively reasonable room rates. Once we got outside our room and enjoyed what the island had to offer, we had a blast. But the resort itself was a major disappointment -- and unless management gets on the ball, we won't go back.

<Title>“The perfect place for our 35th anniversary”
<Content>We stayed 5 nights at the Maui Prince to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary and it was the perfect choice. Being greeted with a big smile,cool wet towel,room upgrade to full ocean view and a complimentary bottle of champagne was just the start of a wonderful vacation. I have never seen hotel staff so genuinely friendly and happy to make a guest feel welcome. The concierge and activities desk were extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations, tee times or anything else you wanted. Special thanks to Rick for being so helpful. We wanted seclusion,the Prince being the last hotel on this end of the island provided it. The grounds at the hotel were immcaculate, the coi ponds, waterfalls and flowers in the garden area were beautiful, we had our coffee here most mornings. The pool area was perfect for us, quiet,layed back with good food and drink service and 2 hot tubs. If you are looking for a theme park type pool this is not the place. The beach at this hotel is great,plenty of lounge chairs (free) and it was never really crowded. The best snorkeling on this part of the island is right off of this beach, some turtles and as many fish as any guided trip, a lot of tour boats anchor off of this beach for their trips. We did take a kayak tour which left just 2 blocks from the hotel at Makena landing. I would recommend this over a boat tour any time, less people more activity and saw plenty of sea turtles. We did not eat breakfast or dinner at the hotel but did have lunch by the pool a couple of times, good burgers, big enough for us to split, usually grabbed a burrito or pastry from the snack bar for breakfast on the way out for daily activities. The breakfast buffet for $24.00 per person seemed overpriced for bacon and eggs. The dinner menu is pricy also but no more so than any upscale restaurant on the island. We were going try Hakone but were never in the hotel at dinner. The food we did order at the Prince was very good and we wish would have tried one of the hotel eateries before we left. One must do on a trip to Maui is dinner at Mamas Seafood House,it is about an hours drive with traffic and we would do it again in a heartbeat. We will definately stay at this hotel for our next trip to Maui.

<Title>“Perfect!!”
<Content>My boyfriend and I went in April 2005 and think this may be the spot we will eventually get married- there is the most perfect bluff overlooking the private beach and ocean. The hotel had everything we needed- the only reason we ever left the hotel was to take the "Road to Hana." The only negative aspect I found was that the breakfasts were very overpriced. The dinners were fine, but if you have a car- I would suggest getting less expensive meals away from the hotel and using the money you save on snorkeling gear/tour or other activities that they have without having to leave the hotel. The concierge was great- go see them for everything!!

<Title>“Holiday at the Prince”
<Content>I read all the reviews and would agree with most that the hotel is nice. Location is great - grounds feel spacious, great beach or you can lounge above the beach on the grass...or at the pool. Staff is very nice. Drinks are great and not over priced. Although hours are short and everything locks up at 10PM. Food is outstanding - Prince Court Sunday brunch was outstanding....and dinner was equally so. Yes, prices are high but not as high as other hotels on this coast. Rooms are very large by modern standards but in need of an update. Pool is ordinary and spa is not much. The hotel is very clean....they are always out cleaning something - as if they are trying to make up for the fact that the facility itself is faded and in need of an update. All in all - much aloha although there is no getting around the fact that the facility and the rooms are in real need of an update. This could be a great hotel as the location is so very nice, it's quiet and totally relaxing. I've been to Maui five times....this was my first time at Prince. Would I stay again? Maybe. It gave me what I wanted this trip. In the south...this is the most laid back hotel and that makes it attractive. I personally liked the Sheraton at Black Rock better...although the location is not as remote.

<Title>“Maui Prince - I'll be back”
<Content>Lots of aloha going on here. We stayed here for 3 nights on our wedding trip and got a double upgrade and a bottle of fizz without even asking. Thanks to Ron for such a warm reception. Staff seem very happy here and they seem to really enjoy their work and care about your experience. We had a lovely room with a balcony and great ocean view. The snorkelling is great and a very good Molokini trip leaves from the hotel every morning. Out of bed and straight into the crater! I had a wonderful time and would recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys nature, peace and seclusion. Oh and thanks also to the Hakone staff for creating a lovely veggie meal for my husband and doing it with a smile. Oh and be sure to look out for the kittens that play at the koi pond.

<Title>“Great stay at the Maui Prince”
<Content>Stayed here at the end of Sept for some vacation mixed with business. Stayed also at the Kapalua Bay Hotel on the same trip and the Maui Prince *wins* on all counts: especially immaculately clean, well designed rooms and superlative service. At the Prince: as others have remarked, these are not fancy or the latest design in rooms but perfectly fine and extremely comfortable (beds especially) with nice amenities like fridge, lanai with furniture, separate bath and toilet areas and good use of space. Access to an excellent swimming and snorkeling beach, with a snorkel boat leaving right off the beach twice each morning--Kahana, also highly recommended. Maui Prince has a lovely Japanese garden in the center that keeps the air fresh, the food is very good but not superior (but did not try the Japanese restaurant) The service is the reason this hotel rates an 'excellent'. Everyone there took the time to learn and use our names, provide whatever we wanted and always with a smile and great attitude. Small pool with plenty of lounge chairs, beautiful grounds where we saw a number of weddings, great access to biking and hiking and other beaches/snorkel spots within easy reach. Not being into golf or tennis, we can't comment on the course and tennis club just across the way from the hotel but they would be very convenient and packages are available. A well equipped beach hut offers snorkel gear, umbrellas and sundries along with great advice from locals. We loved the location which offered the best of both worlds. The Prince is located a mile or two south of the last of the Wailea resorts which gives it a feeling of privacy and peacefulness, with ready access to the restaurants and shops there. (We especially enjoyed Roy's of Kihei which my companions pronounced one of the better Roy's outposts they'd been to.) Finally have to mention again the fine staff who made our stay so much more than a room at a hotel. Recommend: room 535 Aloha Maui Prince!

<Title>“Beautiful and Private with a FANTASTIC Beach”
<Content>My wife and I spent 5 nights at the Maui Prince. Both of us loved this resort. The positives: The beach is absolutely FANTASTIC. The snorkeling is as good as anywhere I have snorkeled off a beach in Hawaii. A resident family of sea turtles, lots of gorgeous fish and volcanic rock outcrops (to the left side) are all present. We actually saw snorkel companies docking out to the left side of the beach to bring people in to snorkel. I suggest getting out early before the mid-day swells roll in. It is also a great swimming beach. I could not stay out of the water. Not to mention it is a gorgeous stretch with views of Molikini in the distance. Not crowded either. The landscaping of the Resort is simply gorgeous. There is a huge Koi garden within the lobby with waterfalls and paths. The exterior of the resort is also very nice. Very classy and impressive. Nice rooms. We had a partial ocean view that was as good as a direct ocean view. The room was very large, updated and had a large balcony. The exterior gardens were a nice view with the ocean backdrop. The Weather. This is a very dry, sun-soaked portion of the Island. Lucky for us we were just leaving Kaanapali where it was starting to rain and it continued to rain there for four straight days (showers). We did not have one drop of rain at the Prince when the majority of the island was getting hit with storms. If you like the sun, this is the place to get some on an awesome beach. A few negatives: We thought the hotel services were a bit expensive. From the breakfast to lounge it just didnâ€™t seem worth the prices. The entertainment in the lounge was great, it was the food and drink prices were a bit steep for the quality. The onsite restaurant selections were not our favorites either and they carried hefty prices with the limited selection. This is just our preference though, if there was an Italian restaurant onsite we would have been happier. This Resort is off the beaten path a bit. However, this is both good and bad. Unlike nearby Wailea and Kaanapali, there is no beachside path that leads you to other resorts and beach spots. You need to get in your car and drive to get anywhere. When you are out having drinks on vacation, this is not a good proposition for a drive back to your hotel. Plus, the fact that my wife and I did not like the restaurant(s) onsite, we had to drive out to get the dinners we desired. This location does have an advantage though if you are craving more privacy and the micro-climate of the area keeps it sunny most of the time. The excluded beach would not be as nice if you had the hordes tracking in off a path like at Kaanapali. I guess I have mixed feelings. If you are a pool lover, this one may disappoint. Personally I love the Ocean, but on days with bad surf the limited pool size may disappoint some. It is very small. However the surf was fine for all five days we were there. There is a poolside bar though that made great drinks. Overall my wife and I would return to the Prince. The weather and beach alone would make it worth it and it is a very beautiful, private place to stay.

<Title>“Wonderful, relaxing beach”
<Content>We were only able to stay at the Maui Prince for one night, but we were really happy with the beach and hotel ammenities. Our room was an ocean view room on the top floor of the hotel. It was very clean and well maintained. Our room was large, with a nice sitting area inside and a large, private lani. The decor of this hotel is dated, meaning that it looks like it was built and decorated in the early 1990's, but the entire hotel is very well maintained and clean. This hotel was booked to capacity while we were there, but it was remarkably quiet. The grounds around the hotel are very expansive for the number of rooms which ensured that the hotel never felt crowded or busy. The best thing about this hotel is the beach - the beach is beautiful and the swimming was amazing. As many other reviewers have noted, we saw several turtles while snorkeling along the left side of the beach. We also took a snorkel trip directly from the hotel to Molikini crater. It was a great trip and could not have been more convenient. Something that we appreciated, but may not have universal appeal was that this hotel is very isolated. You must get in your car or take the hotel shuttle to get to other resorts or shops in the area. This was not a problem for us, but it may be a little annoying if you stay here for a while and do not want to drive to try other resturants. We ate at the Japanese resturant at the hotel and thought the food was fabulous. This hotel in on the south coast of Maui, which tends to be a bit drier than the other areas of Maui. This means the weather is consistently better on this coast for outdoor activities.

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince in May 2005 for our honeymoon. We got married at gorgeous Makena Surf Beach, right down the road from the hotel. Hotel and grounds are clean, beautiful, & well maintained. Gardens and koi ponds are very tranquil and relaxing. Hotel is right on a very nice, uncrowded beach with great snorkeling. We saw fish, an eel, lots of sea turtles, & beautiful coral formations just a few feet off the beach. Snorkeling at the hotel beach was better then the snorkel trip we took out to Molokini! Restaurants at the hotel were excellent but a bit pricey. We drove to Kihei and and found cheap breakfast places right along the road across from the beaches. Hotel is last one on hotel row, far enough away from everything to be quiet and uncrowded, but still close enough to drive to shops and stuff in Wailea and Kihei 10-15 minutes down the road. We did a luau down the road in Wailea which was fun, the snorkeling trip to Molokini, and a Sunset cocktail cruise which was beautiful. I would recommend doing a cocktail cruise instead of an actual dinner cruise because it's less expensive & they serve you a very adequate light dinner with all cocktails included, & besides, you are going for the sunset and not the food anyway. The weather was beautiful on this side of the island. We were there 05/03/05 through 05/09/05, & it only rained the evening of our last day there. There is a complimentary hospitality room at the hotel where you can shower & change, so it was nice being able to stay after checking out and enjoy the beach and pool before we had to leave for the airport for our late-evening flight. The pool is a little small but nice and clean and pretty uncrowded. The pool bar had good drinks and would make them a little stronger for you if you requested it. I loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again. Great price for a magnificent hotel right on the beach!!

<Title>“Ultimate Vacation”
<Content>We had been planning this trip for months, but nothing could have prepared us for how wonderful our stay was. Much as every day was something special, I have to admit, my favorite part (especially for a fraidy-cat like me) was learning to scuba dive. I cannot recommend it enough! I could not have asked for a better instructor than Teresa, who, while we were there, got promoted to top scuba instructor and for good reason. I don't imagine you'd find someone more patient, clear and friendly to teach scuba as Teresa. We just LOVED her. But you want to know about the hotel. We had the pleasure of having our balcony overlooking the luau grounds, so every once in a while, we'd buy a six-pack and sit out on our balcony and watch the luau. It never got boring and I learned to hula to the Huki Lau. Although the best luau is the Old Lahaina Luau (awesome!!), it's nice to watch off your lanai. You can go snorkeling right off the beach (and scuba-ing) with plenty to see and a Honu (green sea turtle) now and then. The rooms are clean and cool, hotel employees are friendly, bell service were incredibly helpful. We only had a little problem with the wireless service, but it was fixed the next afternoon. The bar by the pool had excellent drinks, food and service. Arnold (bartender) even snuck me an extra slice of pineapple in my drink now and then. The best part was, although we had put a lot of stuff on our room tab (3 scuba dives, a few meals and LOTS of drinks), when we checked out, the tab was about half of what I'd expected to pay. Long story short, if you're going to Maui, stay at the Maui Prince. It's no ka 'oi!

<Title>“Loved the Maui Prince”
<Content>This was our first time to Maui and we loved the Prince. We were in Maui for our wedding and loved the tranquility of the Maui Prince. The room was fine (the bathroom was a bit small and outdated) but how much time do you really spend in the bathroom? We had a room facing the mountain/luau area and loved it! You could also see the ocean by looking to your right. By the way, we always had a very clean room. All the staff at the Maui Prince were always very friendly and very helpful in regards to tourist activities. The koi ponds and Japanese gardens are beautifully manicured and great if kids want to purchase fish food. The beach fronting the property is nice and calm, great for snorkeling (most of the fish hang around the rocks/coral). I wish that I would have taken more advantage of it! The best snorkeling location is located just minutes away from the Maui Prince at the end of the road. We visited other hotels and decided that the Prince provides an excellent atmosphere especially for the price that we paid for the room. If you are looking for a Vegas-like hotel, the Grand Wailea is perfect. We are now staying at the Hyatt in Kauai and the more-crowded feel isn't exactly what I had in mind for our honeymoon. It is a nice new hotel, but does not have the gorgeous beach that the Prince provided. Oh well, I would definitely recommend the Maui Prince to anyone who is undecided.

<Title>“First Time to Maui”
<Content>A week in Maui 9/19-9/24/05. We arrived in Maui around 10:30 AM, and learned that the drive from Kahuluai Airport is approximately 40 minutes away. Of course, it wouldn't be the same if we didn't get lost for a brief moment, so when we add a trip to the market, it took us about an hour. You'll know when you arrive in Makena. The lawns are immaculate, the palm trees tall, the golf courses just perfect! As we drove up to the hotel to Valet parking it didn't take long to be greeted with a great big smile, Aloha!, and lei made of small ivory shells that they so graciously placed around our necks. Paradise, we're finally here! They are eager to get our luggage and make sure we don't lift a finger and direct us to the lobby. As we check in at the hotel desk, we again were greeted with Aloha!, and the very polite young lady apologized that our room wasn't ready. She immediately asked if we had eaten lunch and recommended a great place to eat. We chose to use this time to check out the hotel and beach. She smiled and handed us a couple of warm, damp, face towels, with a scent of lemon, to help us relax from our long flight. The lobby and hotel are in the shape of a horseshoe with approximately five floors, with the center of the horseshoe being the garden, with lush green trees, shiny foliage, flowers and plants. The beautiful koi garden is located on the floor just below the main lobby. The garden is perfectly manicured. For you golfers, there are two great golf courses! We check into our room a couple hours after we arrived and while it isn't a suite, it was average size and it was comfortable. By all means it wasn't small. The ocean view was perfect and could be seen from the whole bedroom, not just a corner of it. The lanai was a good size and had a table and a couple chairs to sit on to take in the view. I can do 6 days of this. Not bad. They provide bath robes, a safe, hair dryer, iron and T.V. You can ask for a VCR, but we didn't find a need for it. Although housekeeping has regular schedules and we were often in and out as is everyone else, we found it worked best if we'd call housekeeping to let them know when we'd be out of the room. They never seemed to mind our busy schedules at all. They also replenish your ice and coffee and never hesitated to get us more towels when we asked. For you coffee drinkers, the coffee stays hot! We didn't plan our vacation to be a busy one and really planned on getting some well needed R&R. This was definitely the place! Day 2 we took in a Luau. The Maui Prince offers their very own, comes with a buffet, and overlooks the ocean. I recommend to purchase premium seating because they'll take in a few hundred people in one show. If you didn't bring a camera to the Luau, they'll take pictures of you and your guest with one or two of their show performers and sell them for around $20 bucks at the end of the show. You get a 5x7, a couple 3x5's, and a calendar to insert your 5x7 picture in. You also get a chance to buy some crafts that are being made right there! The buffet was great, people were great, and it was an overall fabulous experience! And a small tip, pardon the pun, if you order room service, the tip is included on your receipt, so be careful not to double tip. Or if you're just feeling very generous, good for you! We spent most of our time at the Resort and snorkeled every day - well almost. This was my first snorkeling experience, so I got to practice a day at the beach before taking on a snorkeling trip to Molokini. I'm glad I did. So for anyone who has never snorkeled before, I recommend to practice on the beach first. It makes for a more pleasant experience if you decide to take a snorkeling trip. The 3rd day we took the Catamarin Snorkeling trip to Molokini. We took the 6:15 early bird special and our guides were very nice people who made our trip great! For this adventure, we got to snorkel in 300 ft of water! The guides were especially excited and told us that we weren't going to their usual spot, but instead, we were going to snorkel in 300 ft. of water and this was about a 1 in 500 trips opportunity. But, then again, they could be saying that to all of their patrons and we wouldn't know any difference! When we got to Molokini, we believed him! It seemed like we hadn't been there for too long before we got a 15 minute warning from our guide before we had to swim back to the boat. Could it be we were having too much fun? I will definitely recommend to buy the 4 hr. trip. We paid for the 2 hr. trip and it went too fast. You may want to make reservations for activities when you arrive. I found that you actually get better discounts from the advertising coupon books they have in the hotel and at shopping centers. Anway, I thought it was really nice of the guides to offer to snap pictures of you and or of anything you ask, just before the trip comes to an end. So if you're not a diver, he or she will get you some really cool pictures! And if you're really lucky, you may just get to swim with a small shark, which was really an experience! OK, I didn't actually see it, as much as I tried, but the guide did take pictures with a snorkelers camera and atleast I can say I swam with it! How many people get to swim with a shark anyway? The fish were beautiful and of many colors - yes, just like in the ads! I'll truly never forget this experience. It will be with me for a lifetime! On day 4, we were snorkeling at the hotel beach and heard rumors that the turtles were out, so we got to swim with a HUGE turtle and that just added to the fun we had! All that snorkeling gets you really hungry! Even though we didn't get to stay for the Sunday Brunch, I hear it is outstanding. We did enjoy breakfast buffet every morning for about $50-60 for two people. You don't have to order buffet, but you're on vacation so why not. You must try the waffles and fresh whipping cream with strawberries! Oh my gosh, my mouth is watering just thinking of it! The koi pond is immaculate and just beautiful! You even get to feed the koi fish with food they sell there. Friday was Prime Rib and seafood day at the Prince Court, and we were not dissappointed. The cost for two people - $100 bucks or more, so plan on paying more if you drink more than a couple drinks. As with all of the restaurants there, they are pricey, but there are choices elsewhere if you don't mind driving. If you take a short drive you can find some other places to eat at, other hotels, and road side meals on wheels type of food. The Maui Prince has a conveniently located activities center right at the beach and everything you need to have great fun! From kayak rentals, boogie boards, cabanas, snorkeling equipment, cameras, etc. The prices, I thought, were pretty reasonable and you can rent by the 1/2 day or full day and if I'm not mistaken by the hour. As for beaches, we found the hotel beach to be very convenient. There are, however, several other beaches to choose from within driving distance too. Big Beach is right next door as are some others. We chose to spend most of our time at Makena Beach. A big plus is their beach activities center that has everything you'll need right at your fingertips. And they will gladly charge anything you rent or buy to your room. You can even review your bill on their channel on t.v.! Don't take any outside beverages to the beach though, you're not allowed to. There is a bar and beverage near the pool area, not necessarily on the beach, where you can purchase drinks. If you forget beach towels, don't worry if you're at the hotel beach. Next to the bar/drinks area, you can pick up a couple warm beach towels on the way to and from the beach for free! A Hotel amenity. There's also a convenient outdoor overhead shower to rinse off. One last thing, take some time to drive to Hana. We made it to Hana on Friday, but didn't really have alot of time to take in the whole drive. But we did get to swim in Twin Falls! Pittsburg, CA

<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince from September 26th - October 1st. We had a Ocean front room #439. We thought the room was great. It was clean and didnt notice any problems with the furniture. Our view and balcony was gorgeous. We ate at the Prince court and the food was so good and fresh. We even ordered pizza delivered to our room with a 2 liter of soda and a bag of freshly popped popcorn for only $14.99. We snorkeled right by the hotel and saw many fish and turtles. The staff where all so nice and very helpful with any question. We loved the Prince and will go back again.

<Title>“Loved the Maui Prince Hotel!”
<Content>I stayed at the Maui Prince Hotel while attending a conference on the north side of the island. I loved it and if I ever go back to Maui, that is where I will stay. The Maui Prince is located in a very quiet, almost secluded part of Maui (literally--at the end of the road). It is so much better than the crowded areas in Kihei (unless you like that kind of thing). I felt waited on hand over foot the whole time I was there--from the free valet parking, to room service, to the excellent restaurants in the hotel. You can sit by the pool much of the day and order drinks, lunch and refreshment without ever getting out or your chair. I will admit, I have not been a guest at the really expensive resorts, so I do not know how they compare, but if you are looking for a less expensive (for Maui standards) place to stay and still be pampered, this is the place. I even got a massage for a decent price on very short notice (outstanding!). Also, I cannot say enough about the grounds at the Maui Prince--absolutely beautiful, especially if you want to be surrounded by what makes Hawaii unique--its flora and fauna. There is opportunity for hiking and walking, and Big Beach is right down the road (a great Maui beach, again, away from the crowds in other popular parts of the island). The Maui Prince has its very own beach (not crowded at all) with a beach kiosk where you can rent just about any equipment you would like. The snorkeling right off the beach (and for miles on either side) was excellent--as good as the so-called "best" sites on the island. Also, just blocks down the road is Makena Landing--another great place to snorkel and kayak. Several other reviewers had negative comments about the rooms. Evidently, something had changed, because when I was there in July 2005, the rooms were wonderful. I had only a partial ocean view (and I could see the ocean from my balcony), but the grounds outside my window were beautiful. I ate breakfast on the balcony (full table and chairs on the balcony with sliding glass doors) every morning listening to the birds and enjoying the morning air. Another nice feature of the room was that you could completely open up the room to the outside air from the front and back with the air conditioner off (automatically turned off when sliding doors are opened). I honestly cannot think of a negative thing to say about the Maui Prince. A great buy!

<Title>“A great hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Maui Prince for 5 nights in early September and liked it very much. It's true that there are turtles and good snorkeling right on the beach at the hotel and the beach is nicer than at many nearby hotels. I found the employees there very nice and eager to please, the hotel very well kept, and the location fabulous. A much quieter place than the larger resort hotels up the road and that was just fine by us as we did not have our kids with us. If we had, we may have opted for one of the larger hotels with more activities although I think they do offer some kind of kids club. I took a horseback ride at Mendes Ranch and we took the Kai Kanai to Molokini, both worthwhile trips that were arranged by the activities desk at the hotel. Some reviewers complained about scratchy sheets, but I didn't notice that at all. In fact, they had a really substantial nice quilted bedspread that I would have liked to bring home. The food is expensive at all the hotels and restaurants so hit one of the grocery stores in Kihei and stock up your room fridge. Even locals, however, seem to think that the Prince Court Restaurant offers very good food. We ate at 5 Palms up the road from the hotel and while it was as expensive as most others in Wailea, the atmosphere was great and the coconut shrimp were to die for (request an outside seat.) You should pick up a copy of "Maui Revealed" at your local bookstore. Great insights and honest info about activities and restaurants on the island although I didn't necessarily agree 100 percent with everything the authors said. Old Lahaina Luau was better than the cheesy one offered at the hotel although more expensive. Also try to include a trip to the Aquarium in Maui. At $19 not unreasonable, very well done though small, and they have a nice restaurant and huge gift shop. The Pacific Whale Foundation has a gift shop in the same location and if you are going to spend money on tee shirts or other souvenirs, why not put your money toward a good cause at the same time? Call ahead and find out when they are feeding the fish. They had a diver with a two way in her mask so she could take questions while swimming with and feeding the rays and other tank inhabitants. Have fun on Maui! It's fabulous! We would certainly stay at the Maui Prince again. You probably need a car if you plan to stay there although I understand that the hotel has an on-demand van that will take you to most places nearby. And if you haven't ever seen a lave field, head past the Prince and check out the protected area just past Makena. Really cool.

<Title>“Great Maui Getaway”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Maui Prince from 8/8/05 til 8/15/05. We had an oceanview room on the second floor and when we checked in and we couldn't see the ocean through the trees they immediately put us on the fourth floor with a much better oceanview. We have no complaints regarding housekeeping or the room- very spacious and clean. We did not go to the pool, but as others have said we didn't need to with the beautiful, uncrowded beach right there. We saw fish and turtles each time we snorkeled. The grounds are well kept and staff was very helpful. Dining is very expensive and we recommend going into Kihei for a good, well priced meal. Check out Kmart in Kahului for cheaper snorkel gear too. The Tiki Bar, in Kihei, is a nice place to grab a bite to eat/drink for the afternoon. It is located on the right hand side of the road if you are leaving the Makena/Wailea area. We walked through many other hotels in Wailea(Fairmont Kea Lani, Grand Wailea, Renaissance Wailea) and decided we had chosen the right hotel for us. It was far from crowded and quite a bit cheaper in price to stay. We paid under $350 per night and joined the Prince Preferred Club for a couple extra perks. If you want a more "touristy" and ritzy, busy hotel, try one of the others we toured. We have toured the road to Hana before, and did it again, we loved it. If you go all the way to the Sacred Pools, bring a change of clothes for swimming, go early in the morning (7'ish), expect about a half day+ there and back. Lahaina was busy as usual, but worth visiting and shopping. We booked our helicopter tour through Boss Frog's and saved a couple hundred dollars. We flew with Air Maui for the 60-65 minute Deluxe Circle Island Tour and loved it. Haleakala is also worth driving up to check out. If you stock your fridge with drinks or food, get it from Star Market or the ABC stores. The Shops at Wailea are nice, some pricey. If you like quality island wear go to Tommy Bahama or Tori Richards. Overall the Maui Prince and its beach are the best for your dollar. We will definitely will stay again at the Maui Prince.

<Title>“Great honeymoon spot!!!”
<Content>We just returned from a 10 night stay at the Maui Prince Hotel (August 15-25). We were married on the beach right behind the hotel. It was a beautiful beach. Starting with our arrival, everyone was so friendly. Free valet parking is offered which is always a plus. Our room was really nice - we had an ocean view room (room 222). It had a view of the mountain,ocean and it was right over the pool. You could always see the sunset from the balcony. Complimentary goodies and water were provided 2 out of the 10 nights. They provide a little refrigerator in the room - very convienent. Room service is really good as far as the food is concerned but it is quite pricy. Housekeeping did a great job every day and gave us a fresh bucket of ice daily. Exercise room is free to use for people staying at the hotel. And there is a self service laundry room that came in very handy. The pool was a nice size with lots of lounge chairs. They also provided lounge chairs for the beach. There was really not much to complain about ....the sheets were a little bit itchy but fresh. There were very few children staying at our hotel and that was a plus for us because we were on our honeymoon. The luaus held on the hotel grounds can get a little bit loud at times but nothing too annoying. The hotel gardens / grounds are beautiful. The restaurants at the hotel are pricy but very tasty. All in all - Maui Prince was a great choice and especially for the price. We would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Great Hotel - But Not Perfect - Recommended!”
<Content>My wife and I just returned from a week at the Maui Prince and we are very glad we chose the hotel. It is not perfect, but it is extremely affordable lodging in South Maui, while maintaining a great atmosphere. We had some noticeable, but very minor complaints about the hotel, but we would gladly return. First, we booked this hotel through a local travel agent. Our cost was extremely low in comparison with other reviewers, and considering our vacation was during the height of the tourist season, I think you should seek deals on this hotel before purchasing the rack rate, but then again if you are on this site, you probably already are doing so. Our arrival was uneventful, with the staff's greeting and front desk very cordial and our service was very efficient. One great benefit over other hotels, free valet parking (compare at $18/day for neighboring hotels). Our room was nice, the view was gorgeous, and we could watch the luau from our lanai. (Others have complained that this was too loud, but either I was extremely tired and didn't notice, or it isn't too loud). The facilities are very relaxing, without much ado. For example, the pool is very plain, but we never got in the pool (why when you have a gorgeous beach right nearby). The beach was a highlight, the snorkeling was great every day, and the turtles would come right up next to us, almost frightening you as often we were just playing in the surf when they swam by. You do not need to pay for a professional tour if you are adventuresome, we paid for a local kayak tour and ended up snorkeling right off our own beach. In fact, one boat leaves from the beach every morning. However, we did manage to compile a few complaints. Remember however, that these complaints will not prohibit us from returning to the hotel, but could factor in our decision if the price were increased... 1. Facilities - While they were adequate, the restaurants seemed a bit pricey for the area, we definitely took advantage of the cafe as it is more affordable. 2. Location - It is called the "Last Resort" for a reason, as it is the last resort on South Maui, but it is worth the drive if you want to relax. If you are going to be in Lahaina each night for the nightlife, this hotel is not recommended. 3. Bedsheets - We were thinking to ourselves that the sheets were scratchy when we read another person's review that confirmed it was not just us. A small thing, but when you get a little too much sun, the hotel could help you out by using better sheets. (These were poorer than many motels I have stayed at). 4. Housekeeping We had a problem communicating with our housekeeper, who unfortunately came whenever we were in our room and did not understand our instructions as to when we would be back (one day after 4.5 hours on the beach, we came back and our room was still undone and we had to leave again to get the room cleaned) Nevertheless, we found our stay enjoyable and we are very relaxed and refreshed after our stay at the hotel. I recommend this hotel for those persons wanting to stay on a beach, but hoping to avoid the high priced resorts nearby. Not quite the amenities that you might find at the Grand or the Fairmont, but it was money well spent.

<Title>“Great hotel-Great location-Great Trip”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Maui prince from Sun 7/31 to Mon 8/8, 2005. What a great hotel. We arrived Sunday night aboout 8pm. We got a very friendly greeting with a nice cool towel. Check-In was very smooth. We had an Ocean View Prime room that was wonderful. Very clean, not at all outdated as some previous posters had mentioned. No smells. The bed was very comfortable. Loved the make-up mirror and the stool to sit on in the bathroom. Great touch as well as the hamper for dirty towels. Toilet had its own room which is a nice touch. Plenty of hot water and water pressure. Housekeeeping was fabulous. Our room was cleaned most days by 12 noon. Always got fresh towles and the room was cleaned very well, especially the bathroom. Our view was spectacular. We were on the 4th floor with the ocean to the right, pool directly below us and looking out over the 17th hole of the golf course. Yes, this was the side the luaus were on but we were only in our room 1 night when the luau was going on so it really didn't bother us and we enjoyed hearing the music. They have a special luau for cruise ship passengers Monday and Fridays. The regular luaus I believe are Tues and Thurs. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We really didn't ask them for much but the few times we needed directions or times for driving they were pretty much right on. Eating at the hotel was pretty expensive. We made reservations Friday night for the seafood and prime rib buffet at the Prince Court. The Entertainment book has discounts for both the Prince Court and Hakone. The buffet was $43 per person and in my opinion although the food was good it was definately not worth the money, even with the Entertainment discount. We pretty much stuck to local resturants in Kihei for breakfast and dinner. We thought the breakfast prices were ridiculous. Although there is a small coffee shop in the lobby with coffee, danish, fruit and juice. The price there were not too bad. We did have lunch at the golf course 2 days and the food was very good, the service was great and the prices were very reasonable. About $10 for sandwiches and fries and one day a stirfry plate that was very delicious. We also bought cheese and crackers and fruit and kept them in the fridge for afternoon snacks. Drinks were very expensive-Don't bother-Go to the local ABC store or Safeway and by your own. We did have lunch one day at the pool as we were on the beach and didn't feel like getting cleaned up to go into town. Lunch for 2 was about $41-We paid for the convenience. Sodas were in a small cup and $2.75 ea. Again, we bought our own and water and kept them in the room fridge and took them to the beach with us. Beach was fabulous. Plenty of chairs and room. Never felt very crowded even on the weekends. Also very clean. Snorkeling off the hotel beach was amazing. Saw a bunches of turtles, tons of fish and beautiful reefs. Rent your equipment in Kihei town from either Snorkel Bobs or Boss Frogs. Will save you a lot of money and they have great equipment-Very modern and not worn. Hotel snorkel equipment was $15 per day per person. We rent for a week equipment for each of us and I had a prescription mask plus we had flotation belts and total cost was $70 with coupon from Entertainment Book. We booked the early morning snorkel trip to the Molikini Crater. Save your money. Snorkeling right off the beach was so much better. Although if you must, definately book early morning. We were the only boat there and by the time we were getting ready to leave, there had to be a min of 10 boats pulling in. The hotel had a nice mix of people. A lot of honeymooners, quite a few older couples and older families. There were a few families with kids but they definately were not over running the place. One of the reasons we picked this hotel was we figured there would be less kids as the pool is nothing to write home about and it is very secluded so we figured the appeal would be for a more adult crowd. And that did seem to be the case. Parking was plentiful. We always parked our own-Never used valet although they seemed to be very efficent and no one seemed to wait very long for their cars. The weather was wonderful. After the first night we left the sliding doors open and used the louvered door in front to let breezes in. It was great hearing the ocean and the waterfalls from the courtyard. We never heard much noise from other guests. Remember the hotel is secluded-There are shutttles into Wailea and to the golf course. We rented a jeep and just drove ourselves. Everything is pretty conveninet from the hotel although again you do have to drive. Kihei is a 5- 10 min drive. Wailea is just up the road-maybe 5 minutes. We went to Lahaina and it was 45 mins to an hour depending on traffic. Airport was about 30 min drive. My husband played golf one morning. Rates are very resonable for hotel guest. He had a blast. The course is beautiful and well kept. Spa services were good. The spa is nothing great or grand. I had a facial and massage and both therapists were good. Basically it was 2 rooms-Nothing very fancy at all. I would definately recommend the hotel, especially for couples. It is very romantic. We had a wondeful, relaxing time and hated to leave.

<Title>“Wonderful Honeymoon Location”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for 7 nights (beginning 27th July) following 3 hectic days in Las Vegas. The Maui Prince was extremely relaxing and in a wonderful location. The beach in front of the hotel was safe, sandy and beautiful. Just off the beach the snorkelling was excellent with a few turtle encounters. Photo of beach attached. We took our own snorkelling equipment but the hotel's beach hut also rented it cheaply. They also provided free towels for the beach and pool which saved us getting ours wet. The hotel's restaurants were rather expensive - $30-40 for a main meal in the restaurant and likewise in the Japanese restaurant. We often ate in the lounge where for approx $13 you could get great burgers and pizza and watch the sunset. We went to Mulligan's Irish pub just up the road on the hotel's free shuttle bus. We really loved this pub, it had the best sunset views, wonderful flavoursome, well-presented food (slightly small portions but fantastic prices) and really friendly staff. The hotel's cleaners could have put in a bit more effort. It was ok but not sparkling like it could have been. We didn't get the daily bottled water as per the other reviews. There wasn't much to do in the evenings, no where to walk or bar-like environment. Not the best place if you're looking for lively nightlife, but for relaxing its great. This proved a really tranquil resort, aided by the Japanese garden atmosphere, outside breakfast dining, lots of waterfalls and ponds. We didn't need a car as the excusions we went on (organised by the hotel's activities rep) included transport from the hotel. We came away completely refreshed and wishing we were back there. I'd recommend going there.

<Title>“A Very Pleasant Experience!”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from a ten night stay at the Maui Prince. This was our fourth trip to Maui (previously to the Kaanapali area) and we decided to stay in the Kihei/Wailea area for a change of pace. After doing some research and reading the reviews on this website, we settled on the Prince. We are very happy that we did! I thought that the room was fairly large and well layed out. There was a seperate closet/dressing/coffee area and the toilet was seperate from the shower area. The hotel supplied some nice amenities for a four star hotel. There was a lighted makeup mirror and a nice bench to sit on to apply makeup or do your hair. There was also a towel basket for used towels. Everyone receives a welcome basket filled with goodies and bottled water. Every day the coffee (no limit) and bottled water was replenished. One of the services that I have not seen mentioned is the shuttle service that the hotel provides. We never had to take the car out when we went to dinner in Kihei or Wailea. They will drive you in a private car or their shuttle bus to your destination. When you are dropped off, you are given a card with the telephone number to call for pick-up. The hotel has an agreement with all of the area hotels, restaurants, and shops because no matter where we went, the people were happy to call for us to be picked up. We never waited more than a few minutes. I also have to commend the valet service. We never had to wait for our car. I think that the employees are trained to learn your name when you check in because after each encounter (valet, concierge, restaurant, etc.) we never had to say our name more than once. Maid service was outstanding. Every morning I would call housekeeping when we left for breakfast, and when we came back the room was always made up. There are three sides to the hotel. The middle section is ocean front and the two side sections are ocean view. One side section has a view of the pool and the other side is mountains and ocean. If you want quiet, stay on the mountain side. The Prince hosts four luaus a week and the luau garden is on the pool side of the hotel. Friday nights, they host the people from the new mega cruise ship (about 1500 guests). You can walk over and watch the entertainment, but if you are on the pool side, you will have to listen to the drums in your room for hours four times a week. When we checked in, the girl at the desk suggested the mountain side because we were staying for ten nights - and she said that the luau drums can get on your nerves after that period of time. We were happy that we made that decision. There are five stories to the hotel rooms. We were on the third floor (room #352) and had a huge lanai. I also want to mention that the lanais are very private. You cannot see another person on their lanai and no one can see you. When I looked up at the lanai above, the bottom looked about two feet shorter. I asked about it and I was right, floors four and five have smaller lanais. I also want to mention that we never heard all of the birds chirping that people have written about. It may have been the location. The beach is outstanding! We do not snorkel, but we were still able to watch the huge sea turtles from the shore. The water is so clear that you could see them swimming and bobbing their heads above water. The people that were snorkeling said that they had amazing experiences. The hotel rents umbrellas for $15 a day, cabannas for $25 a day or $15 for a half day. Beach chairs are free and so are unlimited towels. We didn't use the pool, but it was a very pretty round pool. There are no slides, etc. and it was never crowded. We could have had a poolside cabanna (there is no charge) at just about any time. One thing that I have not seen mentioned is that the beach access is a fairly steep incline - both up and down. Any person that has a mobility issue could have a real problem. We did go to visit the Four Seasons, Grand Wailea, and Fairmont Kea Lani Hotels. They are indeed magnificent properties! They are also very busy and the beach chairs remind me of those on a cruise ship. They are elbow to elbow, as are all of the cabannas. You cannot walk between them. The same goes for all of the areas around their very elaborate pools. The beach areas are not nearly as nice or as large as the Prince - and far more crowded and very, very noisy. If you want to read a good book on the beach or at the pool, the Prince is for you. If you have small children, you may want to consider a hotel other than the Prince because it does not have all of the slides, etc. that you will find elsewhere. I was looking for a quiet resort away from the children and after visiting the other hotels, I was happy that I stayed at the Prince. I have read reviews that try to compare the Prince to these other hotels, but you can't. They are in a totally different category. You will pay two to three times the rate that you are paying at the Prince. We joined the Prince Preferred (which is free) and booked directly through the hotel. We took the lowest rate that included breakfast (we rented a car on our own through National). We calculated the rate that included the car and found that it was cheaper to do it this way. The Prince Preferred gave us a few little extras which you can check on their website. We even got a gift bag when we checked out. We ate breakfast at the buffet every morning, which was excellent. We never had to stand in any lines whatsoever and the hotel was at 85% occupancy. We never had to wait for an elevator, there were never any lines at the concierge desk, valet desk, main desk, etc. For some reason, this hotel just seems empty (although it was not). We did not have the Sunday brunch, but we did eat at Prince Court for dinner twice and Hakone once and they were both excellent. We bought the Hawaii Entertainment book for $9.95 (they are reduced at this time of the year) and the Prince Court and Hakone were both in there. I took my New Jersey card (they are not marked, just to see if it worked) and I had no problem using it when we ate the second time at Prince Court. You just have to make sure that #22 is not scratched off from your card). This is a very quiet property with no noise and very few children. If you are looking for a lot of activity, this is not the hotel for you. The concierge recommended wonderful restaurants in Kihei and the Wailea area. We had outstanding sunset dinners and didn't have to drive to the restaurants. They drove us and picked us up. If you are looking for a lot of nightlife, then you are better off in the Kaanapali area. It is a good ride to get to that area from the Prince and not very easy in the dark. We have stayed at the Sheritan Maui once and the Westin Maui twice. The Maui Prince was a nice change from all of the hustle and bustle of Kaanapali.

<Title>“Great Trip - Average Hotel”
<Content>We just returned from a seven night stay at the Maui Prince Hotel. The location is beautiful if you like the secluded feeling. Personally, I think next time I would stay further North because we found ourselves driving to Lahaina for dinner, shopping and activities almost daily. The pool is really sad for such a large resort, but we spent most of our time at the beach anyway which was never crowded and has great snorkeling. The food is great at all the restaurants, but WAY overpriced. The room service is cheaper than the cafe which I found a bit strange. There are two reasons why we would not stay at the Maui Prince again: the birds and the linens. There is an open court yard in the middle of the resort and EVERY morning at 5:30 am on the dot they would wake us out of a dead sleep. They would go on for hours so we finally had to get earplugs to sleep! Also, the linens were terrible. I am not even a thread-count snob, but the sheets were so scratchy and did not breathe. We turned out air conditioning down to 66 degrees every night but were still hot. Unfortunately for those two reasons we will not be repeating our trip at the Maui Prince. I say unfortunately because the service is wonderful. Very friendly staff and willing to help out with anything.

<Title>“Away from the Crowds, Pleasant”
<Content>I have to give a 5 star mainly because of the value. We got package for 5 nights including rental car for $1200 total. Got it throught (---), a local travel agency. Less than half the price of hotels in Wailea. The Prince is not luxury by any means, but the rooms are not as dirty and dated as some other visitors state, at least this is my opinion. I loved the grounds and the courtyard! Just relaxing and pleasant to be around. Service more than adequate. We passed on the $23 breakfast buffet and went for the coffee shop in the lobby which had great pastries, muffins, etc. for quiet reasonable prices. Recommend sitting at the bar which looks right out at the sunset over the island of Lanai, it is stunning and you have a front row seat. I understand that the bar has only been in less than one year because some guests in the past compained about no where to get a drink. I would go back to Maui Prince without hesitation. Beach is wonderful as others have stated. I have done scuba diving for years and never saw as many and as large of sea turtles as you can by just walking right off the beach in front of the hotel, amazing!!

<Title>“Loved it at the Maui Prince”
<Content>My wife and I stayed 7 nights at the Maui Prince from June 10-18, celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. We loved the hotel. The Lanai was very large and private and we had a great view of the beach from room 346. The staff was very freindly and courteous and we were treated to a bottle of champaign our first night there. We had a hard time deciding where to stay for our 1st trip to Maui and chose the Maui Prince mainly because it was a bit secluded and quiet. We were not disappointed. The rooms were spacious and clean and we could here the ocean from our room. The breakfast at the Cafe Kiowai was very good but be careful not to leave your plate or the birds will quickly move in to steal your food. The grounds were very well maintained and the gardens were beautiful. The beach was never crowded and sea turtles are a common sight just a few yards out. We will have many great memories of our trip to Maui and the Maui Prince will definitely be a part of them.

<Title>“SO GLAD WE STAYED HERE”
<Content>We went here on our honeymoon from July 5-11. I did a lot of research and based part of my decision from the reviews on here to stay at the Maui Prince. First of all, this hotel is very clean, I found no bugs in our room (very important to me). The rooms are pretty average, nothing over the top and a little dated. We were upgraded from a partial ocean view to an ocean view, but you still had to stand on the balcony to see the ocean. The staff was super friendly, always offering to help up or offering directions. The hotel grounds as said before, are very nice. We went to the Maui Sunset luau here (because the Old Lahaina was sold out) and enjoyed the show and the food. The beach here is great! Not too crowded and good snorkle in the morning, even saw a huge sea turtle off to the left side of the beach. Also a plus, was the boat that goes right out of that beach to Molokini. The Sunday brunch at Prince Court was good, but not worth $40 pp. The $23 pp breakfast buffet at the cafe was pretty good. The location of the hotel is the last in south Maui, and you have to drive into Waliea or Kiehi for shopping and dining, but we live in a big city, so the change was nice. Very satisfied with this hotel.

<Title>“Makes a guest feel right at home”
<Content>If the staff is the soul of a hotel, then the Maui Prince is blessed indeed. We arrived at the Prince after driving across the island when we found the "charming" B&B I had booked was so horrible i wouldn't stable a goat there. My wife and i were hot, frustrated. tired, and at the end of our rope because we had no reservations anywhere. Ron, the person at the desk, made everything all right. He found us a room for three nights, got us a reasonable deal, and we were checked in within a half hour. The courtesy and friendliness of every staff person we had contact with made us feel that they were glad we were at THEIR hotel. Pride in a job well done and it shows. The rooms (we had to switch after one night because of bookings) were bright, clean, and comfortable. A really nice extra is when you open the door to your lanai, the A/C stops and doesn't come back on again until you close the door. The breakfast buffet was fabulous and the Prince made our last three days on Maui a positve experience. Jim Myers

<Title>“Maui Prince is GREAT!!!!”
<Content>This is a very good resort...not spectacular (see Grand Wailea)....but very clean, isolated and nice. Resort is away from the noiser, higher priced, "fancier" resorts, but the Prince is fancy in it's own right. Rooms are pretty nice, very clean, with big private balconies, big bathrooms (seperate bath and shower). 5 star beach with excellent snorkeling on the left side. Not a crowded beach at all. Saw 5 turtles while snorkeling. Water/waves get choppy in the afternoon making snorkeling not so good. Pool area is kinda lame, but why spend all day in the pool?...you can do that back at home....the beach is where it's at. Room service is quick and the front desk is very courteous. The Prince Court resturant is good but way overpriced unless you're rolling in dough. Any Negatives? Our room, #143 was right by an outside door that people kept slamming...not that big of a deal, but I hate doors slamming. Also...beware the bell boys and valet parking. Although valet parking is "complimentary," you will feel inclined to tip. If you pull up and open your trunk, the valets will swarm. The Kai Kanai (sp?) is Prince's boat that picks up passengers right on the beach to go snorkeling Molikini crater that is only 20 minutes away. Very nice trip with crystal clear water...70 foot visibility. However, Molikini is somewhat overrated as the corral isn't overly abundant and the fish count isn't that high either...we saw a white tipped reef shark and that was worth the trip for us. Take the early morning $45 trip to save some money...it's worth it. Overall, I was very, very pleased with the Maui Prince. The gardens and grounds are beautiful...plenty of free parking. Shop around and make sure to get a good deal. Oceanviews were decent, but next time, I'm saving money and booking a cheaper garden room...I know what the ocean looks and sounds like. 4 out 5 stars for the Maui Prince.

<Title>“Best Honeymoon Ever!”
<Content>I have to admit when we won this hotel on priceline for only $185 a night, I was a little skeptical after reading the reviews on tripadvisor.com. Once we arrived at the airport and headed south to past Wailea to the secluded and quite Makena, I realized I was skeptical for nothing! The Maui Prince is a PERFECT place for a honeymoon...seclusion and a beautiful beach! We loved driving to the hustle and bustle of touristy Lahaina and Ka'anapali for nights out or dinner and then making the beautiful one hour drive back to our own little secluded paradise, the Maui Prince. We felt like we were the only ones there. The resort never seemed crowded and all the staff was really courteous and knew us by name. The room was better than your standard room with a vanity area, a safe, a mini fridge and a HUGE lanai with an ocean view. Housekeeping kept our room spotless everyday. The tub was small which was disappointing but it wasn't that big of a deal. The pool area was small, but never crowded and we always were able to get one of their 6 cabanas. The hot tub was also nice to relax in and the drinks from the poolside bar were good. The beach was AMAZING! We saw turtles everyday about 10-15 yds in from the shore. We even swam with them one day when we had our snorkel gear! The beach had beautiful sand and wasn't rocky, truly enjoyable. The grounds of the Maui Prince are spectacular. The gardens and koi ponds and landscaping were beautiful. We really enjoyed strolling the property and taking in the scenery. We enjoyed our stay there and would definitely stay there again! Maui Prince Hotel Breakfast Buffet at Cafe Kiowai - B+ $23 per person seems stiff to me for breakfast but we decided to try it. The assortment of food was delicious....except the first time I went up all the food was cold...the eggs, the waffles and the french toast! I was determined to not pay $23 for cold food, so I immediately told our waitress and she acted shocked and took charge instantly. Less than 2 minutes later they restocked the buffet with hot eggs, waffles and french toast. And she brought me a plate of hot fresh eggs to our table. Definitely fixed the problem. Once I had hot food, the $23 was worth it.

<Title>“Truly another part of Paradise”
<Content>We've just got back from almost a week in paradise with my wife and son (June 13-19), and even though my wife said that I haven't got a romantic bone in my body, the Prince is a fantastic place for some loving! It's hard not to repeat all the good things that have been said about this hotel, so I can just re-emphasize most of them. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. Fantastic beach, nice pool (so what if it's a bit small?), beautiful setting, wonderful wildlife (birds, turtles, deer) etc. etc. 10/10. We had a very nice room at the lobby level (#154). It opened towards the courtyard in rear of the hotel, where the birds congregate in the trees every morning and evening to socialize. They will probably wake you up the first time you hear them go, but you'll get used to it. If you want a more quiet room then ask for something near the front of the hotel. Of course the Lanai was nice, overlooking the gardens and west Maui in the distance. 9/10. The staff were fantastic - from the bell desk to the reception and especially Leila at the pool: 10/10. Free valet parking is superb! 10/10. Beach activities were great - my son also earned to Scuba dive and I had a refresher dive with the turtles! 9/10 Although the Luau is held in the grounds, there are probably better ones on the island than the one at the prince. The setting is great but the entertainment can be a bit cheesy. The food is only so-so and at $75 it's not cheap. The upside is that you can drink as much as you want and not worry about driving back afterwards! Overall 7/10 for the Luau. Room service is pretty good, considering the prices for food elsewhere in the hotel. I'd recommend stopping at Safeway in Pi'ilani (just off hiway 31) to get some supplies - drinks, salads etc. , then have a picnic on the beach (or in your room!). 8/10 for room service The Friday Seafood & Prime Rib Buffet was very good - it's worth not eating much for the whole day to make sure you have room for everything! More shrimp as well as crab and lobster would give it a higher score than my 8/10. The breakfast buffet is excellent too; it's great sitting outside with all the birds (Mynas, Night Herons etc.) by the Koi pool, and the meal will keep you satisfied the whole day. 10/10. You will need a car if you really want freedom, otherwise you can use the free shuttle to the nearby Wailea resort shops. Our overall score is a good 9.5/10 (it would be 10/10 if the prices were lower, but then that's Maui for you...). We will definitely be back there as soon as possible, even though the island is more expensive than the mainland. Catman

<Title>“Exceeded Expectations”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Maui Prince from 6/12-6/19. After reading many reviews for this hotel, we had some reservations about staying here. The Maui Prince exceeded our expectations. The rooms were larger than expected . We had an oceanview on the 2nd floor. (220) The staff was vey helpful and friendly. Used the free shuttle service to Waelia and also the Makena golf courses. The two golf courses were an excellent value with great views. The beach and the snorkeling is the best on the south side of Maui. Lots of sea turtles and fish to see. Very private beach area. Pool is small but great service from Sara at the pool bar. Never very busy at beach or pool. We have stayed at other south Maui mega-resorts and really enjoyed the slower pace and lack of crowds at the Maui Prince.

<Title>“We loved the Maui Prince”
<Content>The Maui Prince is a great hotel. The pool is small, but the ocean location is excellent. The room was nice and clean and the staff went out of their way. We arrived early and were given a room right away. Each room has a refrigerator which was nice for drinks and snacks. They also brought up a DVD player and installed it only minutes after we called. The luau on the property was fantastic and the food was surprisingly good. We got a good room rate through Priceline and would definately stay there again.

<Title>“Loved the Maui Prince!!!”
<Content>My new Wife and I have just returned from our wedding/honeymoon in Maui. We stayed at the Maui Prince from 6/12 to 6/19. We booked it through a package deal and got the Premium Ocean View room on the top floor (5th) in 545. When we walked into the lobby and heard the waterfall, we knew that we had made a good choice. The grounds are very lush and the staff was very friendly. The room service was good. The Makena Breakfast Buffet at Cafe Kiowai was excellent and worth the price ($23 a person) after eating from the make you own waffle and omelet bar. We did not eat at Hakone nor at the Prince Court. They both close at 9pm, which seems kind of early to me. We also went the Sunset Luau with all of our family and had a great time. If you are looking for a romantic, secluded place to share with your significant other, I really, really suggest the Maui Prince!

<Title>“Loved the Maui Prince - has it's own private beach!”
<Content>I read all the reviews on TripAdvisor before booking this hotel. The one recurring comment was the hotel needed a remodeling update. Although perhaps the furnishings aren't opulent as some of the mega hotels on the strip, I really loved the simplicity of the Maui Prince. The grounds are excellently kept. The hotel has a charming coy pond in the center with fountains. There is an open air lobby which was great for relaxing and listening to the birds. We were upgraded for free from a partial ocean view to a full ocean view which we found to be serene. From our balcony you could see the mountains, the pool, a golf course, and the beach. Cardinals and a variety of other birds would land on our balcony and the tropical birds on the grounds are amazing to see. There was a mini fridge which was great for cold drinks and sandwiches and salad. The snorkeling at the private beach right near the hotel was AMAZING! There were only about 50 people at the beach at any given time. The only problem was that it had limited shade although you can find a few random trees here and there. It is hot in Hawaii. We saw sea turtles less than 50 feet from shore almost everyday. We also saw blowfish, numorous tropical fish, a mana ray, etc. about 100 feet out to sea. The hotel is near the lava pits and the Big Beach, which is a white sandy beach. Both were interesting to see. However, it is about 15 minutes further from the mega resort strip and about 45 minutes from Lahaina, the happening town. This extra distance is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The advantage being that the hotel is completely isolated but the disadvantage is that it is a pain to get anywhere. Skip the room service though. The food is very expensive and not that tasty. They messed up our order as well. Also, the DSL costs $11 a day!

<Title>“Great Location Old Rooms”
<Content>On our honeymoon we stayed at the Maui Prince for 5 nights. The staff was pleasent and upgraded our room to an oceanview for our honeymoon. We really liked the amenities offered at the beach, however they are for an extra charge. Great snorkling around the beach! The staff was pleasant, and the rooms were clean but really in need for a little TLC remodeling. They were a little "creepy", & we had a hard time relaxing in our room. We expressed our concern, there really wasn't too much they could do (except bring us a plate of choc-strawberries) to apologize for any inconvience to us. All in all, we were happy to leave onto our next hotel (next time we'll stay at the Marriott)

<Title>“Would go back, but needs an update!”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from our first trip to Hawaii and thought the island of Maui was lovely - really pristine and one georgous beach after another. Since we didn't know the island at all, I relied heavily on the reviews here and booked the Maui Prince because it seemed like the most mellow of the Wailaia resorts. It is. In a really good way. One of the most common things said about the MP is that it doesn't feel crowded, even when it's full. And that is very true. We visited most of the big resorts on the Southern side of the island and truth be told, most reminded me of the Fountainbleu in Miami Beach - or of a cruise ship... kids screaming at the water-park-like pools, overpriced gift shops, TONS of activities and only the most Disney-fied version of "Hawiian" culture - luaus, tiki torches, leis, etc. The Prince has a bit of that, but the volume knob is on five, instead of ten. What the other resorts had that the Prince didn't, which is key for my husband and I, is a place to sit outside to enjoy the sunset and cocktail hour. Our room was "partial" ocean view, so you'd have to sort of stand on the ledge and lean over the balcony to check out the sunset... hard to do with a drink in hand. And the cocktail lounge is inside (and sort of tacky) AND (if anyone from the hotel reads reviews - PLEASE change this) they stop serving drinks at the pool bar at 5PM. Why?!?! Why would you do that? Just extend the hours to 7:30 during the summer - no biggie! Luckily, we found the bar at Ferraro's (at the Four Seasons) was the perfect alternative - drinking mango margaritas and munching on antipasti. Sigh. As far as updating, I feel like the MP has simply fallen behind in some basic ways. They realized they needed a gym, so they emptied out a guest room and threw in some treadmills and freeweights. Suggestion 1: build a real gym. Other hotels have jacuzzi's attached to the pools, the MP has a couple of port-a-spa's a side deck somewhere. Suggestion 2: build an in-ground jacuzzi (that's a bit more comfy to sit in). Other hotels have a place to sit outside and enjoy the sun setting behind Lanai. Suggestion 3: build a patio over the breakfast area on the ground floor (there are too many birds around to enjoy an outdoor breakfast anyhow), and bust out the outer wall of the Molokini lounge - to create more of an indoor/outdoor feel. Finally, the rooms feel a little dated, but we didn't go to Maui to sit inside a hotel room.

<Title>“Don't go to the Maui Prince luau”
<Content>I want to shout it out for all the world to hear (but I still won't get my money back) - DON'T go to the LUAU at the MAUI PRINCE. I surfed the web before our trip to Hawaii, and every where you see that the luau at Lahaina is the best, but I found some compelling reviews for the Maui Prince (and since we were staying south, we chose that one) that were completely unfounded. Yes, the fire dance is kind of cool, but this luau is $75. The food is like (but not even as good as) the Old Country Buffet. The pre-show is the worst kind of cheesy. The actual dancing was okay but the setting ruins the experience. Big round tables on a grassy lawn (not on the beach); you're seated with complete strangers - not of your choosing. Even with the dancers, a few were good and a few were bad. We thought about asking for our money back 5 minutes into it, but tried to make the best of it - as you can tell, it didn't work. We can't get our money back now, but if we save 3 people from a ruined night in Maui, it will make us feel better!

<Title>“Second Honeymoon!”
<Content>Just returned from 9 nites at the Maui Prince Hotel in Maui Hawaii. I did a lot of research before I left including reading comments from Trip Advisor. If you are looking for an upscale and small Hotel, this is the place to stay. We had an Oceanfront room. It was awsome. All the rooms are Oceanview, but it was our 35th Anniversary and we wanted the best! The hotel was full, but not crowded. You were not overwhelmed with the Hotel. I've been to some resorts that are just too big. We had dinner at two of the Hotel's restaurants and both were very good. We went a mile down the rode to the Seawatch every morning for breakfast. The scene was a golfcourse sourrounded by the ocean and mountains. It was breathtaking and the food was reasonable and delicious. They had the nicest waitresses and waiters. The beach in front of the hotel was beautiful. It was huge. Never crowded. And every night you could watch the sunset. We didn't spend too much time at the beach. We did a lot of exploring. It was awsome. A great vacation and a wonderful hotel.

<Title>“Great Family Vacation”
<Content>I read the other reviews and people need to "Quit Whinning." My family had a great time at the resort. We stayed with our daughter who is a year and a half. The staff catered to our needs and made us feel like family. I never once was awoken by the bell boys. Staff gave our daughter a beach ball and bucket. . Its cheaper to order room service instead of eating in the restaurants. The beach is nice and private. The pool is a bit small but if you go to Maui to sit in a pool you might as well have stayed home. Room service was excellent and is the only way to go. The laui was excellent and well worth the money. The grounds were well kept and lush. We went to Kaanapoli and it was very crowded. All the resorts were stacked up next to one another. THe Maui Prince is on the south end of the island and is quiet and secluded. If people do a little research before they go on a trip it might make their vacation more enjoyable. If yo uare looking for a beautiful resort that is nice and quiet Prince is for you.

<Title>“Disappointing”
<Content>We booked this from the UK on the strength of it's reviews both here and in travel brochures and from friends who'd lived in Maui and said Kanaapali woud be too noisy. In retrospect I wish we'd stuck to the excellent Sheraton we'd had in both San Fransisco and Kauai and stayed further up the island. The Maui Prince is in "Golf City" and, despite the shuttle [latest back 9:30pm though] is very isolated and requires a $200/week car rental. Although they realised we were on our honeymoon and had specifically booked an ocean view [we were told there were no deluxe ocean views....although apparantly there were premium which we didn't get!] both rooms [the first stank of smoke] only glimpsed the ocean from one side. The whole hotel, while beautiful in a museum-type way, was very noisy with bell boys trundling their carts at all hours as well as being able to hear everything in the corridor [including lift bells] with both doors shut. We had a lovely holiday but I didn't feel the hotel lived up to it's reputation or price and, when we spoke to the manager, we were told it was an 80's hotel due for refurbishment so....be warned in the near future but it could be great when that's finished.

<Title>“Great for a honeymoon”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for five nights May 7th- 12th. We got married in Kaanapali and came to the Prince for our honeymoon to escape our family and friends. We were given an upgrade when we checked in and had a huge room with a gorgeous view from our lanai. The staff was incredibly friendly and thoughtful, when checking out the front desk agent even told us congratulations on our marriage. Housekeeping did a great job of keeping our room clean and organized. I agree with other reviews that say the pool area is small and disappointing. Our thoughts were that we wouldn't be spending any time at the pool when surrounded by such great beaches, but after seeing some of the amazing pools at other resorts (like the Grand Wailea or Sheraton Poipu on kauai) we realized that a better pool area would have really added to our enjoyment of the hotel. The beach right in front of the hotel is beautiful and has great snorkeling. Other beaches within walking distance of the hotel are Black Beach, which was never crowded, and Big Beach which was absolutely beautiful. If you plan on snorkeling do not rent from the activities booth at the hotel. You can rent equipment for a week at Snorkel Bob's for the same price as a day at the hotel. There is a Snorkel Bob's at the Shops at Grand Wailea. You can have the free shuttle take you there. As far as dining, we were disappointed by the Sunday brunch. With some exceptions the food quality did not live up to what I expected for $45 a person. The brunch staff was excellent and very attentive. We did not eat at any of the other hotel restaurants. Definitely have a car if you are staying here. We did not have one for the first two days and you begin to feel kind of trapped in the hotel, especially at night. The Kea Lani, which is the closest hotel is two miles away so walking is not an option.

<Title>“Guests are second fiddle”
<Content>This could have been the perfect beach front hotel. My wife and I stayed at the Maui Prince for 5 nights in April 2005. We booked an oceanfront room at just over $500 per night including taxes. We were looking for peace and quiet, service and a great oceanfront location. We got 2 out of 3. While we were there, the hotel was changing the room locks. All day long the whine of the worker's drill could be heard. We did not spend a lot of time in the room during the day, but by the second day, this was very annoying. But even worse, twice while we were in our room *with* the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, the hotel staff knocked on our door because they wanted to change the lock. After it happened the first time, I complained to the assistant manager, but the next day, same thing. To me, this is unacceptable. The second time, the excuse was "you are the only room left to do on this floor". Apparently that trumps a Do Not Disturb! Well, you can see where management's priorities are. At $500 per night, this sort of work should not be scheduled when the room is rented to a guest. Not recommended.

<Title>“Wonderful, relaxing vacation at the Maui Prince”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince from March 29th to April 5th 2005. We had a great time. The staff at this hotel are wonderful. They were extremely friendly and helpful. The hotel grounds are beautiful. The courtyard and the open air lobby were amazing. The rooms were a little run down but nothing like we had expected from reading other reviews. The rooms were always very clean. The lanai was great with a view of the ocean and Molokini. We enjoyed the breakfast at the restaurant overlooking the koi pond. The pools were quite small, however, we didn't spend very much time at the pool as the beach here is so great. The snorkelling right off of the beach at the Maui prince is really good. We also took another snorkel trip to Molokini and a second spot (the second spot wasn't even as good as the snorkelling right off of the Maui Prince beach). I would highly recommend having a car if you stay here because it is a bit out of the way but this makes it very quiet and relaxing. We walked around the Kea Lani Fairmont and the Grand Wailea and they are amazing hotels but the Maui Prince is much more 'Hawaiian'. We also went to the Old Lahaina Luau. This was really good. The grounds here are also quite beautiful. We also took a helicoptor tour with Blue Hawaiian and we really, really enjoyed this. I would highly recommend doing a helicoptor tour even though it is quite expensive. All in all, we had a great vacation at the Maui Prince.

<Title>“Loved It!”
<Content>Two families and two rooms was a great vacation for all. The rooms were clean and the staff is wonderful. I liked the birds singing in the morning. The pools are a little on the small side, but you have the entire ocean just a short walk away. The Sunday brunch is must! The shuttle van will drive you just about anywhere in the area of the hotel and pick you up when you give them a call. The Maui Prince is a quiet place to relax and be with family. The night life is up the road in Lahina, which is fun but not relaxing. Forget the snorkle trips you pay for, they are right there on your private ocean.

<Title>“A Nice Hotel”
<Content>My wife and I recently stayed at the Maui Prince. While the hotel grounds were exquiste and the beach was beautiful, the hotel itself was okay. The rooms were clean, but they can be upgraded. The hotel is great for relaxing on the beach, snorkeling and sunsets. If your room is located near the mid to back of the hotel, you will be awaking at dawn to the sounds of a thousand chirping birds. Prior to arriving in Maui, we stayed an the Hawaii Prince in Honolulu. The Hawaii Prince I would rate a 10, the Maui Prince is a 7. We had a great time in Maui, and our stay was very relaxing, which was our goal; however, if we return to Maui, I probably will choose one of the hotels in Wailea.

<Title>“Beach Fun galore at the Maui Prince”
<Content>Stayed here 3/22- 3/25/05; my husband and I are in our mid 40's, no kids. The resort is gorgeous- beautiful beach, stunning atrium area with koi ponds. Rooms are larger than most with a 2 room bath (toilet sep), double door foyer (allows you to keep outer door open, close inner louvered door and keep sliders open for the breeze), 10 x 5' foyer/changing area, large bedroom (our prime ocean room #440 looked right over a restaurant roof but we had the beach, ocean, mountain view that was unspoiled), lanai 5 x 10'. Room service was OK; of the 3 times we ordered, mistakes were made on 2 (wrong appetizer sent and correct one sent right up after we called; hamburger request to be 'no pink', was 50% pink); food quality overall good. The hotel provides 2 bottles/water daily and complimentary snack package (2 biscotti, coffee, chips, chocolate) and was prompt with request for decaf. Housekeeping very good- asked for xtra robes and received them quickly. We saw whales 2/3 mornings from our lanai (better view with binoculars, but still could see w/ naked eye). Snorkeling from beach good one day, other days too silty/windy. Took the whale watching catamaran that leaves from the hotel beach- AWESOME- saw mama/baby, 2 male escorts; crew very friendly. Beach staff helpful mostly (I wanted to rent a one person kayak one morning and the attendant did tell me there was no one to help me get it in/out of the swells at that time and I'd be on my own. There was a staff person from the catamaran on the beach, who saw me hesitate at the timing of the swells and was quick to help me out, tho). Pool area nice, adult pool , kiddie pool, 2 spas. Overall good trip and would go back to the hotel for the excellent location on the beach and quick access to water/beach activities.

<Title>“A Real Treat”
<Content>The Maui Prince is definitely a jewel located at one of the best locations in Maui. We were there early in March which means higher winds and more rain. We still managed to get in some great snorkeling right off the hotel beach. As we researched the best places to snorkel we found that this beach area came highly recommended. We found that the water was less clear due to the rougher water; however, we still saw many colorful fish darting in and out of the coral. We had a 5th floor prime ocean view room which lived up to its title. From our lanai we could see Lani and the West Maui Mountains. If we stuck our heads out to the left we could spot Molikini. The ocean during our time there was active so we were lulled to sleep every night by the sound of the waves coming through the screen door. I am not sure if this would be true in summer. The room and bathroom were spotless and very well laid out. The furnishing was simple but perfect for the room. The king size bed was very comfortable. The bath tub shower hose is hung from the wall about 5 Â½ feet up. I am 6 foot and I did have to scrunch a bit to get the top of my head. Room service was excellent. We ordered room service so that my wife and I could enjoy our lanai view over breakfast. The presentation and friendly service were fantastic. This was the experience we had with any of the hotel staff we encountered. Everyone had a smile and were always looking for ways to make our stay more enjoyable. We loved the fact that the hotel while beautiful was not ostentatious. The breakfast buffet at the CafÃ© Kiowai was a real treat especially if you donâ€™t mind eating surrounded by birds all looking for an easy meal. The Molokini Lounge serves some mean tropical drinks along with a small choice of good hot sandwiches. As we ate we also got to see whales surfacing not far from shore. This I understand happens all the time during the winter months. The Prince Court Restaurant does a stupendous job. We thoroughly enjoyed the dinner there. The only problem we had were the hours. The Prince Court and Hakone restaurants all stop seating at 8:30 PM. We often found ourselves coming back to the hotel from other island activities at a time that did not allow us to freshen up and go to dinner. The pool was small but I am surprised anyone would want to spend one minute in a pool when such a gorgeous beach was only a three minute walk away. This hotel sits at the end of road which gives it itâ€™s serenity. This means more driving time on the road. For us this extra time behind the wheel was a very small price to pay given the Maui Prince location. We are already making plans on coming back. We might try a little later in the season.

<Title>“Relaxation and Serenity”
<Content>My husband and I have been staying at the Prince for over 10 years and it suits us to a tee. We prefer resorts that do not attract a lot of families with children. The Prince does not seem to have an extensive kid's program, thus not so many kids. We like warm, friendly service, but prefer to avoid the ostentation of some of the "grander" resorts. There are good restaurants right at the hotel, plus lots of fabulous restaurants to go to all around Wailea. Yes, some of the decor is a bit dated- however, it's not shabby or anything like that. I suppose they'll do some updating someday, however, we have so many great memories there, I wouldn't want to see it change too much.

<Title>“Great Setting!”
<Content>My wife and I had a wonderful stay at the Maui Prince for our honeymoon. From the moment we came onto the grounds, we truley felt like we were in paradise. We were greeted well and brought up to our room by a very informative and friendly bell hop. We were happy with our room on the fourth floor that overlooked the gardens as well as the pool area and ocean off to the side of our balcony. No doubt that room furniture, sheets, etc. need a desperate update, but we didn't come all the way to Maui for the rooms. The room served us well and were overall happy with it. We especially liked the lanai where we ate our breakfast or listened to the waves of the ocean or just hung out on. The best part of the Prince was that it had its own beach without the crowds of people that other surrounding hotels experience on a daily basis. Throughout our 7 day stay, we never had a problem of finding that perfect spot on the beach or being too close to other people. We ate at Hakone one night for their Buffet. The food was good, but very expensive. So if you're a family of four, consider yourself warned. The Concierge desk was helpful most of the time and provided us with good information about tours and restaurants. Here's a little known tip- our flight wasn't until 7:00pm, but we had to check-out of our room at noon. We were in Maui and nowhere to go, so naturally we headed to the beach until 3:00...what else would we do! When we were done and needed a place to shower and dress, we asked for the hospitality room that included a living room and bathroom...but we were too late, it was already reserved for an hour. So, we were told that we could use the showers in the workout room...which we did. As we were leaving, we ran into more couples doing the same thing...On the beach until the end. Overall our stay was a memorable one. We liked the seclusion of the Prince- absolutely no traffic or the like; friendly service and the beach and the grounds were spectacular. There are other places to stay in the area that are more grand and newer, but definetly wthout the charm of the Prince.

<Title>“Out of date, needs renovation and small pool”
<Content>The Maui Prince is in DESPERATE need of a major renovation!!!! The white tiles are out of date as are the artwork in lobby. Rooms were spacious but AGAIN need updating! WE thought front lobby could have benefitted from an open space to enjoy the ocean view. Staff was reasonably friendly and gift shop not over priced. Beds were VERY UNCOMFORTABLE and pillows small. We never stuck around to try the pool after seeing how small it was and with no view of ocean or drink/food service seemed anywhere around. The best thing I can say about the Maui Prince is that the beach is private, but you would be best served by trying another resort and driving down to the "private" beach!!! I enjoyed my stay at the Renaissance (2004) much more. I found the Renaissance to be elegantly decorated and had beautiful ocean rooms and great food. I also loved being able to lounge by the pool and have drinks served to me! They also have hula lessons for kids which the Maui Prince didn't (we had brought the kids this time). Overall not a bad place, but with so many other options on the Wailea strip and comparable prices I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

<Title>“Wish we had stayed here longer...”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here 3 nights during our honeymoon 12/21-12/24. Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer. The staff was excellent. Their room service is reasonably priced. The view is amazing and even though this hotel does appear a little bit older, it is very clean and comfy. I never had one complaint the entire time. The hotel is the furthest south on the coast, so the beach is pretty private, as only hotel guests venture to this southern area. From Maui, my husband and I flew to Kona and stayed at the Ohana Keauhou. We wish we had stayed in Maui those days instead of visiting Kona. The Maui Prince was by far a highlight of our trip.

<Title>“Still one of the best”
<Content>We have been staying at the Prince for about 7 years, for varying lengths of time. This year, for example, we stayed for 13 nights, 12 days during the summer. I like the hotel because it is not ostenstacious, and the staff are so down to earth. I've mailed things home from this hotel, and it always arrives promptly. I just love the staff in the Cafe Kiawe. It's unfortunate that the restaurant was closed for lunch, during the summer, though. This was a little disappointing, and inconvenient, especially if you have young children that need to eat right away. The service by the pool was awful, as they leave your food there to get flies on them, etc. The service there needs to be better, but I'm glad they're there. The smoothies are good. The daily pool activities are wonderful, and I've enjoyed them immensely-Yoga, coconut leaf weaving, etc. The pool is lovely, and the beach activities staff is wonderful. The waves on the beach can be daunting, but I just love boogie boarding on the beach. My son took it up this year; he's twelve. Golf is enjoyable for my husband, and it's so close. The food at the Golf course, which is where you have to go for lunch, is good, and the service is great-it's the old staff from Cafe Kiawe. The amenities(internet connection, pool service) have gone downhill from the first time we stayed at this hotel, but we still keep going back because it's quiet, and the staff are so down to earth. When you go to the Grand Wailea, it's so noisy, and the patrons are so rude, it seems. At the Prince, you have locals from other islands, or even Makawao staying here, so it's fun-as long as you don't have the screaming boys from Makawao who love to jump into the pool without looking. I just love the location of this hotel-a little out of the way, but it's close to La Perouse Bay, and the Ahihi Nature Reserve, which are so quiet, compared to the rest of Maui. Piilani Highway is getting so busy, but still the best route to get to Wailea from anywhere. Still love this hotel, despite the changes. I noticed, that the rating went down. Each year it's a four star. There was no mention of star rating with AAA on the board for 2003 or 2004. Changing times, I guess....

<Title>“Bad Service/Discrimination”
<Content>WE go to Hawaii twice a year (for the last 15 years). We have never had the check in problems that we had at this hotel. We stayed at The Maui Prince over the holidays. We had booked a room with a king bed, ocean view, non smoking. We were given a smoking room with 2 doubles. We complained and were told..too bad/there is nothing they could do. After 50 minutes..and saying we would leave the hotel..they magically had a room..but no view. We took it. After talking to other couples...all the couples that did not have the same last name were treated the same. We meet 3 other couples by the pool with the same complaint..and they were stuck with the smoking rooms and double beds. WE have never had this happen in Hawaii. I would suggest if you are not married or you have different last names to absolutely avoid this hotel. We are prince perferred members...it is outrageous that the room you book is not the room you get.

<Title>“Don't Believe the Bad Reviews-Maui Prince is a Nice Place to Stay”
<Content>I have to be honest, having read mixed reviews (especially the one about the bugs in the beds), I was a little concerned about the Maui Prince. It was the only hotel with availability during the holiday season so we didn't really have a choice on hotels. After having stayed for 7 days, I was very pleased with the hotel. I did not see any bugs and our room was very clean and tastefully decorated. I am sure that it is not as nice as some of the other resorts on Maui, but I was pleased with the property. I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, and many other expensive hotels and the Maui Prince met my standards. The grounds were very peaceful and like eveyone else has said, quiet and relaxing. The beach is beautiful and a wonderful place to snorkel. Many of the snorkel boat trips came to the ocean in front of the Maui Prince because it is known as Turtle Town. I saw a ton of turtles, eels, beautiful fish, and coral! I saw more snorkeling off the shore of this hotel than I did on my scuba dive! The food was great at that Hakone but the Prince Court was typical hotel food. The staff were all extremely nice and I have to say, probably nicer than any hotel staff that I have ever dealt with. I am glad that I stayed on that part of the island. It is just beautiful there and less tourist like than other parts of the island. Please know that there is a ton to do and you aren't too far away from everything. The only rude service that we had on the island was at the Kobe Japanese restaurant in Lahaina. Do not go there under any cirumstances. Regarding the Maui Prince, an overall nice place to stay so don't believe some of the bad reviews that it has gotten. I wanted to make sure to post to this site because it really had me concerned and I felt it was necessary to help others going there to feel more at ease with their choice than I did. Have a great time in Hawaii!

<Title>“Perfect for a honeymoon!”
<Content>We visited Maui March 1st of 2004 and stayed for 5 days. I spent nearly a whole month planning my first trip to Maui and reviewed all the top locations and prices of the resorts for the perfect honeymoon. And perfect is what we got. Now hear me out, my wife and I both have high standards and we know quality when we see it, so when I say this trip was perfect, I mean it. The Maui Prince Hotel is the ideal "getaway" location. You're on the Southwestern side of Maui (where you get the best sunsets) and your a short distance from all the tourist trap areas (where you're free of street merchants) but quite close to some of the islands finer dining and golf resorts (Wailea is a 5 minute drive, or you can take the free shuttle with the hotel). The grounds at the Prince are gorgeous and well kept and the beach is just past the garden in the front. The Prince Court is one of the best dining experiences you'll ever have. Not only is the food exquisite, but the matrodee, Gio, will make your evening special. The restaurant overlooks the garden, the beach and one of the best views of Lanai for a romantic sunset dinner. The rooms aren't huge but it's plenty of room for newlyweds! They're very nicely decorated. My advice, PLAN A LONGER TRIP! Ours wasn't long enough and we're dying to get back! You'll never forget Maui so long as you live, I promise.

<Title>“Super!!!!!!!!!!”
<Content>We just came home yesterday (Dec 15) after 10 wonderful days there. We arrived at hotel and were pleasantly greeted by Desiree at front desk. Our hotel room was paid in advance as a partial ocean view. We were upgraded free to a full ocean view. Our room was beautiful. We chose this hotel so my lovely wife and I good celebrate our anniversary in a quiet setting. This hotel does not offer some of the frills some others do with water slides, etc. It was a beautiful, quite, well manicured property. They were even laying new carpeting on Monday and Tuesday in some parts of the hotel. The pool area was super with a wonderful beach which we took advantage of. The property has a few restaurants. We only ate at the one, Prince Court one evening. The food was excellent. What was surprising was how many customers came from other properties to eat there that night. I was told by several other guest that the other restaurants were also super. One little fact that not many people talk about is the more north you go, the more it rains. The Maui Prince is the last hotel on the SW side of Maui. We talked to others that had rain several times last week. We only had rain for about 2 hours one day. The entire staff was super. We can't wait to go back. If I can help anyone with other names of super restaurants and activities please let me know.

<Title>“Very Nice!”
<Content>First, some context. We found a great deal on the hotel's Web site ($199/night) and we took it. We can't afford to stay at hotels like the Four Seasons and are comparing this hotel to other moderately-priced properties we have stayed at in the past, not to the luxury category. Overall, we were very pleased with the entire experience. The hotel is located on a great beach that has good swimming and snorkeling. Access to the beach is just across a golf cart path, not a busy street. It was very convenient for all those trips back to the room for things I forgot. I read the other comments about the room being dated, and we didn't really notice this. The decor in our room was light/white and pleasant. The doors were a little beat-up, and a darker wood, but we didn't mind. We liked the option of air conditioning or opening the screened sliding doors. Our room was spacious with a view of the mountain, some trees and a bit of the ocean. We liked the nice, private lanai. In general, the room was very comfortable, peaceful and relaxing. Service was a bit uneven. Most of the staff was very pleasant. The valets may have been a bit miffed that we preferred to self-park our car in the lot, rather than have them do it. On the other hand, the waiter at the Prince Court was very gracious about our use of the Entertainment discount. Maid service was great on some days, lacking on others. The room was reasonably clean when we arrived. The pool is a plain circle - no waterfalls or anything. We didn't use it. The grounds are lovely with lots of interesting plants. We liked the open courtyard on the way to our room, rather than a closed-in hallway. One nice surprise was that they didn't "nickel and dime" us. Each day they dropped off some bottled water. The room safe was free. Parking was free (self-park or valet). We especially appreciated the very reasonably priced take-out lunch counter. We would stay there again.

<Title>“Wonderful hotel!”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince from Nov 9th-18th, 2004 in a partial ocean view room. For the cheapest room, we still had a view of the ocean from our balcony. I love this part of the island, you are isolated and there are not globs of tourists like northwestern Maui. The beach is the best part of this hotel....it's decent size and not crowded at all. You'll find sea turtles on the south end of the beach, make sure you bring an underwater camera! Snorkels at the hotel are expensive, $15 per day. Stop by Snorkel Bobs or Boss Frog's for a weekly rental for $30 and a $7 ticket to Molokini on the Quicksilver. The hotel itself needs to be refreshed, but I overlooked that because the staff was so wonderful on our stay. Nothing that a coat of paint couldn't cure. The rooms were great, little outdated, but very clean. This comes from a VERY picky person that needs a clean hotel. They also had a refridgerator which we kept stocked with a case of bottled water from Safeway in Kihei. Pool is very small, but there is no need to use it when the beach is right there. We went there once when it was too windy on the beach. Didn't eat at the hotel restaurants, but did order room service once...TIP--Do not order the pizza....ick. We ate mainly in Kihei or some other part of the island. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel. Can't beat the location and it's by far my favorite beach on Maui (probably because I fell in love with the sea turtles).

<Title>“Didn't care for the hairs and bugs in my bed!!!”
<Content>I booked this hotel at last minute on Priceline for part of our Honeymoon trip. I had previously saw it on Expedia and thought it looked very pretty, and for the price in that area of town thought it was a deal. We were supposed to stay two days in Maui and both days were booked at the Four Seasons. At last minute, I started to feel bad about paying $700 for a two night stay and decided to make it one night at the Four Seasons and one night somewhere else so I decided to enlist Priceline in that help. I knew we wanted to remain in the Waliea area so I put in the price of $150 for a resort hotel and it took it. When it came up the Maui Prince, I thought "What a great deal for a nice resort!" Looking on their website you can see that their rooms go up to $300 and $400 so I figured it must be decent. We passed the Four Seasons on our way there since it's only 2 miles apart and I knew that I had probably made a mistake. The Four Seasons looked so nice and classy and upon getting to this hotel, it looked just ok. My husband who is never one to complain just said that I was going to complain about anything I could because I wanted to be at the Four Seasons. When we got there, the receptionist was very nice and let us check in about 2 hours early. We got a room on the fifth floor that faced the golf course. Upon entering the hotel we definitely noticed that the decor was old. As many previous responses have said, the bathrooms had the kind of shower heads that you use to water your dog. Still my husband wasn't sure that it was a bad place so we changed and headed out to the pool. The pool is a little small and round. We decided to bypass this because the 10 people that were laying there were all staring when we walked by and no one was in the pool. So we decided to go out to the beach. The beach is an ok area and ok in size. There were only 20 people or so out there so we were able to get a chair. The bar attendant on that day was Lucky, and he was excellent bartender and very funny. One of the girls that was waitressing was talking about how they were going to close early because they weren't busy and hadn't been all week. The more we go to talking to her, the more she told us all the things that were wrong with the hotel. She also stated that if they did not redo some of the decor and pool, they would not be able to keep up with the other hotels in that area. We went out later that night and upon getting back, we pulled back the sheets to go to bed. There was a long black hair on the pillow. Both my husband and I have blonde hair so it wasn't either of ours. Upon pulling back the covers, there were 3 more hairs, one more long hair and two small short hairs, not the kind out of your head! So, I picked up one of the pillows to get the sheets off the bed and a cockroach came walking out from underneath the pillow. At that point my husband was unhappy and decided to call the front desk. They were very nice and changed our room, but we had to pack everything up at 12:00 midnight and move down 7 rooms. It was at that point, that my husband decided the hotel was not a "Resort" but more a dump that needed updating. I am the first to admit that I am very picky, and the decor doesn't bother some people, but when there is someone else's hair on your sheets and pillows that is something to be picky about. First thing I did when we changed rooms was call the Four Seasons to see when we could come over. The receptionist stated that we were guests when Saturday morning hit and that the spa opened at 6:00 am and the pool opened at 7:00 am, and we were welcome to come over anytime after 6:00 am to leave our luggage and change in the spa and swim. Needless to say that we got dressed and headed over there about 10:00 am without even going back to Maui Prince to swim or lay on the beach. Once we checked in with the Four Seasons, the met us with real lei's and allowed us to not only swim at that time, but even let us do an early check-in at 10:30 am!! The normal check-in is at 3:00pm. My husband has decided that if we go back, it is worth our money to save and stay at the Four Seasons the whole time. I wouldn't waste my money on this place!!

<Title>“Relax and enjoy the beach”
<Content>My wife and I have stayed at the Maui Prince twice now. Each time, we really enjoyed ourselves. The beach the property sits on is probably one of the nicest beaches in Maui (so nice in fact charter boats make this a stop for snorkeling), not to mention the fact that it is so picturesque that beach weddings are almost a daily occurance. Enough of the beach, now about the hotel. The reviewer who stated, "it is all what you are looking for" had it right on. If you want lots of people with a movie star atmosphere, this is not for you. I have stayed at other resorts (Fairmont Kea Lani) and really liked the pools and the people, but for the money, the Prince is for me. It never seams crowded, the staff is not over-bearing, the rooms are clean and mostly in good shape, and as I said, you are right on the best beach in the area. I plan on going back again next year and recommend it to both friends and family. Up's Beach, quietness, un-crowded, bar tenders at the pool (that may be biased, we have made friends with several of them), clean rooms and grounds, the Wailea area. Down's Rooms could use updating, pool is not resort quality. If the Prince were to install a new large pool with a bar, it could probably draw in more people. However, with Makena beach at your doorstep, I can see why they keep it simple.

<Title>“It all depends on what you're looking for”
<Content>We (myself, wife and 3 year old) stayed at the Maui Prince in March of 2004. We wanted to experience the beauty of island parardise without the busy resort feel. This resort is quiet (even when they're sold out... huge property), peaceful, surrounded by island beauty, amazing golf course amongst nature, and a fantastic beach. The setting is amazing. The rooms at the Prince are sufficient (clean and functional). The pool sucks... only because it's not heated... it's function is to cool off not swim... spent most time at the beach... it was so beautiful. You can do pretty well every beach activity from here including snorkelling trips to Molikini. The central courtyard at the Prince is really nice... we had breakfast at the adjacent restaurant every day... nice spot. It's not as remote as it feels.. every night we took the complimentary shuttle 5 minutes to the Shops at Wailea for dinner (4 resaurants on the water.. med to high price). Lots of people about, fun place... then we went back to our sanctuary at the Prince for the night. We also checked out the other resorts in Wailea, Fairmont Kea Lani etc., nice places but very busy, pools are awsome but swarming with people...towels everywhere.. tiny beach... can't beleive the price. We've already booked to come back in March '05. Near perfect vacation for a family of three into a quiet, relaxing trip. (Just needs a heated pool and updated decor... but then it would be very expensive).

<Title>“Loved the peace and quiet!”
<Content>After reading the mixed reviews, I was not sure exactly what to expect. Booked our room through Hotwire and they rated it as a 4 1/2 star hotel. Still, I a little uneasy before arriving. I am glad to report that my husband and I were very pleased with this hotel. My husband even said "I think this is the most quit hotel I have ever stayed in." That was a big compliment from him. We received a newspaper every day (except Sunday). They have lawn games, private beach with a beach activity center, a small hula show on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in the lounge, a gift shop, shuttle service to the other hotels, glof courses and shops in Wailea, a 5 ft pool, a 3 1/2 ft fool and 2 hot tubs, pool side bar. Try the buffet at the Hakone on Monday nights if you like Japanese food. Come hungry and try the Macadamia Nut Cheesecake. I agree the rooms could be updated, but the room was clean. If you are looking for a glam hotel with tons of nightclubs and action, marble statues and art work on the walls, this is not the place for you. We were looking for a place to kick back, relax, work on our tans, and foreget about the rest of the world. We found it at the Maui Prince. Would stay there again in a heart beat.

<Title>“Wonderful!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Maui Prince Hotel from September 28, 2004 through October 5th. We really enjoyed it once we got the room we wanted. At first they gave us an upgrade to ocean view. Well, you could see the ocean in the distance after a bunch of trees. We were kinda dissapointed. But then my husband went down to the desk to see if we could upgrade. They were SO accomodating. The desk lady gave us about five different keys to different rooms so that we could pick which one we liked. We found the PERFECT room (#533)!!! Incredible ocean/beach view. You could see the waves crashing on the beach and every sunset in full view. We watched at least two weddings every sunset from our balcony (very cool). We ordered room service and had them set the table outside with table cloth and everything for the sunset. They brought us a complimentary bottle of champaign (it was out 8th anniversary trip). Then a couple of days later we came back to the room after a day of adventures to find a beautiful vase full of goreous flowers with a card from the lady at the front desk. The weather was perfect for snorkeling right on the beach at the hotel. The best ocean swimming I have ever done. The pool was small, but who cares when you have such a wonderful beach just 30 seconds away. They installed two new hot tubs while we were there, so here's no more problems with the jaccuzzi. Yes, the decor is a little dated, and they could do a few things to improve on the ambiance (like adding tiki torches in front of the property or lighting at night in their beautiful garden area). Also, the Japanese Restaurant's Monday night buffet is way over priced for what you get ($44.00 per person). That is the only reason I give this hotel an above average rating instead of excellent. It is true that you get a lot for what you pay for. I would definitely stay there again. I loved watching the turtles bob up out of the water among the rocks right on the beach. Beautiful! I want to go back in December for whale watching.

<Title>“A real find!”
<Content>We couldn't agree more with the June 27, 2004, reviewer who said, "The people that posted negative reviews on this board must be the type that look for problems and aren't happy with anything." The Maui Prince was an ideal vacation spot for us and we plan to return soon -- lovely room with a great view, a fantastic housekeeper (Mila called us by name the first time we met!), beautiful grounds, no crowds, and a helpful and pleasant staff at the check-in desk. Other things we appreciated were: 1) complimentary valet parking; 2) cool washcloths at our late check-in; (3 hospitality snacks in our room upon arrival; 4) a filled ice bucket each morning; 5) ice water served by the pool attendant; 6) great service in the two restaurants (but not quite so good in the Lounge); and 7) quick service by housekeeping staff on our request for vases. And finally, is there another hotel that actually imprints its logo on the toilet paper rolls? Our only disappointment was that the weather wasn't right for snorkeling - but we don't think the hotel had any control over that!

<Title>“Wanna relive the 80's again? Stay at the Maui Prince Hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince Hotel for 6 nights on August 4-10th and thought we got a deal of $180/nt. for an oceanview room. The reservation, front desk and housekeeping staff were great! But our room was worn and outdated back to 1984, but clean at least. An oceanview room doesn't mean "full oceanview", just that you can see some of it. I wonder what the Partial Oceanview category meant, does someone have to hang by their belt to see the Pacific? The room was noisy because it was located in the elevator foyer and the building design meant voice echos from anyone who uses the elevators (avoid those rooms). The radio and alarm clock did not work for what seems since the 90's and the most interesting was that the shower was nothing more than a short rubber hose that you wash dogs with. It was funny at first to hear the adventure my 6'3" boyfriend had trying to wash anything above his chest with a 5'5" length of hose. The next morning we were put on waitlist for one of the few rooms that had a western height shower. Nothing was available for the entire week. The plumbing system is all connected and outdated since your shower will get cold and hot when anyone in one of the 500 rooms flushes a toilet, which is a constant temperature fluxuation, not sexy. Plus, you hear every hotel room guest fighting with the plumbing's groaning and squealling sounds, that were NOT sounds of a honeymoon. The tiny hotel pool water was sickenly pee warm and murky, the hottubs never worked even though the staff was notified daily. The beautiful beach had dangerous and sharp boards with nails floating in the water and on shore, that the staffed didn't haul away even when asked by myself. The staff instead tossed them back into the water when they thought no one was looking. The Prince Court fine dining restaurant had the smallest food portions for such high prices and the staff had no clue how to serve in a fine dining restaurant. When I politely mentioned the tiny "easybake oven" food portions for $34, I was told, "you should have ordered something else" and "That's the way it is" before our server walked off in the near empty restaurant. Simple, common sense was not available that night, no wonder the place was empty. The hotel and beach are beautiful and has so much potential, but needs a complete renovation and update, and the staff need to be trained to a service level of the nearby luxury resorts if the Prince wants to compete. The Maui Prince Hotel is nice, but no longer upscale or luxury, and should not promise to offer what it can no longer deliver. A tarished, outdated original "Grand Dame" hotel that deperately needs a facelift. sad.

<Title>“The lowdown...”
<Content>After spending 5 nights at the Prince Maui, my wife and I were left with the feeling that it could have been so much better with a few simple things being done that other hotels of the same class all seem to manage. When you arrive, I expect a real flower garland not some cheap sea shell made in the phillipines. A glass of something fizzy to welcome you would be nice. A customer relations manager to take your round the hotel on arrival so you know where everything is. We were on a wedding anniversary trip, so some sort of effort would have been nice on the hotels part. Fruit basket, something. I do not expect to have to pay $18 a day to have an umbrella on the beach. Personal attention, even if its something silly like asking if we need our sunglasses cleaning when by the pool.. it does make a difference. The hotel needs a refit, the pool is tiny, the spa is a joke, they need to sort out a proper beach service, cheap and nasty sun loungers don't cut it. After speaking to people on Maui basically allot of things I've mentioned were there once like a proper Maui welcome, but the human resources manager has cut them all out trying to cut costs. Anyone with any brains gets fired, she doesn't want to feel bettered by anyone. So while the head office is happy with the cost cuts the clients leave unimpressed and unhappy. Staff morale is very low, although we found staff friendly. Lots of people have left the hotel. Others are trying to go to the four seasons, which i think is the best hotel on the island at the moment. The idea of the Mau Prince being away from everything is a good one but the hotel isn't upto the job. They should look at other hotels like Legends in Mauritius who do the same but a lot better. In the end over our five night stay we didn't eat once in the hotel restaurants which you may think is a shame but when you see that you are paying an extra for everything, even internet access(!), you don't want to spend anymore in the hotel. So we ate most nights at the four seasons and at Wailea.

<Title>“Batting ninth for the Yankees...Maui Prince”
<Content>Hi! I've booked this hotel through Hotwire and got it for less than 200$ and this is what's it worth compare to the surrounding Mega-Resorts in the area. Don't get me wrong, this is a real nice hotel with a superb beach but if Maui Prince plays with the Milwaukee Brewers, he's batting fourth. The problem is this resort are in the big leagues and he's playing the with the big stars in this area of Maui and in a yankees lineup, he's batting last. The main drag for this one is it's 8-10 minutes south of the others resorts and you need to drive all the time to go somewhere. If you're vacation goal is to relax, enjoy the beach, eat at the resort without being overprice and enjoy a real quiet place, you will be in a great place. If you enjoy luxury, swimming in a great pool, this isn't your place. By the way, this is the smallest pool I saw in the world for a 'resort'. The pool is really disappointing but the beach is gorgeous. Service is above average, restaurant is above average for pricing and the rooms are cleans. I hope it will help. Thanks!

<Title>“Didn't like the Maui Prince.”
<Content>I stayed at the Maui Prince for one night in August (2004). I was fairly disappointed in this hotel. While the staff is helpful and the beach is nice, I did not like the rooms or the pool. The rooms desperately needed a makeover. The walls were marked up. The furniture was old and dirty. The bedspread was falling apart. The pool was not nearly as cool as other places on the island. I was so upset that our travel agent booked us there on our honeymoon. It was not close to the paradise I expected, and not worth what I paid for the trip. I paid an extra $500 and moved to the Hyatt and it was well worth it. While I'm sure this hotel is fine for some people, if you are picky about where you stay, don't stay here.

<Title>“Prince Is Everything Maui”
<Content>We stayed at the prince in Sept 2002 for 6 nights after being at Wakiki for 6 nights. We could not have asked for a more relaxing secure place. We arrainged to be married in Maui with out the help of the Prince as we wanted it to be very simple and secluded. We found the perfect beach just one mile from the prince. Makena or Big Beach go there. The Prince had at least two to three weddings going on everyday we stayed there around the complex. All of the people and receptions were never a bother or hinderance to the rest of the customers. The Staff at this hotel is by far the best and warmest I have ever encountered in any resort we have stayed which includes the Kappallani Beach Motel on the other side of the Island. We were catered to beyond what you would normally expect from a hotel, that is why it is so great. You can stay at more expensive places with childrens areas, 2000 guest, luxery pools filled with hordes of loud people, lines at restraunts, loud nightlife etc.. or you can come to the prince and enjoy paradise as paradise should be enjoyed. The Prince is Maui as nature is, quiet, peacefull, serene, beautiful, and open hearted. We have visited four of the Islands and have stayed in resorts in Hawaii, South America, North America, Bahamas, Jamacia, and the Rockies, No where have I felt the Aloha spirit as I felt in the Prince. I is worth the time, effort and expense to get there and stay there. We will be back in Sept 2004 again.

<Title>“Perfect Honeymoon”
<Content>We stayed at the Maui Prince for our honeymoon and loved it! The price difference in the oceanview room was worth it--we were able to leave the balcony doors open each night and listen to the waves. The beach was never too crowded, and the staff was so friendly. We were pleased that the hotel was not in a busy, crowded area and did not mind driving to our sightseeing destinations. We hope to visit this hotel again when we celebrate our fifth anniversary!

<Title>“Tranquility at The Maui Prince”
<Content>I live on Oahu and like to travel to the neighbor islands for quick getaways to "recharge my batteries". The Maui Prince is my favorite hotel on the south side of Maui. My son and I love the spacious rooms and the beautiful gardens. It is not a super deluxe resort with gadgets and tons of activities, but a serene spot to unwind. The rooms are spacious and very clean. Each room has a mini refrigerator stocked with bottled water, a coffee maker and a basket of goodies complete with coffee, chips and biscotti. The bathroom offers a tub with handheld shower, a separate shower stall, hairdryer, lighted make-up mirror and various Prince label toiletries. There is adequate seating with a bench next to the armoire housing the tv and dvd/cd player and a settee at the foot of the bed. There is also a desk with chair, a small table and 2 rattan chairs. The closet includes real hangers, an iron, ironing board and safe. The rooms also have privacy doors in the breezeway...nice to open the outer door and let the tradewinds cool the room. The balcony is a wonderful spot to sip wine and watch the sunset over the ocean or to drink coffee and watch the island wake up. The pools & whirlpools are adequate but the beach is also right there. Everything about the hotel is comfortable. The service is absolutely top-notch. All of the workers are extremely friendly and accommodating. There is always a friendly smile and a warm welcome from the staff...this includes store personnel, valets, housekeepers, massage therapists and everyone else in between. Cafe Kiowai serves a very good, if slightly pricey breakfast. The Prince Court Restaurant has an absolutely fabulous Sunday Brunch. The shuttle that takes you to the golf courses can also take you to other Wailea resorts or the Shops at Wailea for dinner or shopping. The resort is definitely not for someone looking for lots of action; it is for someone looking for a peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle of touristy Maui. I guess the laid back feeling here is perfect for unwinding. The lush gardens and koi ponds have a tranquil quality and ambience. I have stayed at many 4 & 5 star resorts, not only on Maui but on all the other islands, and still continue to return to the Maui Prince year after year. I think it's because I feel so rested and rejuvenated after a stay here. Other resorts may certainly be more luxurious, but a stay at the Prince is like coming home. I just returned from a weekend stay there and am already wanting to return.

<Content>Started our Hawaiian honeymoon at the Maui Prince on July 3rd and stayed for 3 nights. All I can say is WOW! Super friendly staff, wonderful rooms with incredible views of the ocean and the beautiful Haleakala. Only ate at the breakfast buffet, which was resonably priced and very good. Location kept it secluded enough to be be very romantic, but was still only about 30-40 minutes from all the activities on the west side of the island. We will definitly be returning.

<Title>“Our Maui Prince Honeymoon was Great!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Maui prince for a week in July of 2002... it was paradise. We enjoyed our rooms, NEVER saw any bugs, smelled smelly or "musty" smells or encountered rude people. Perhaps things have changed since we visited, but the grounds were immaculately kept, the staff was friendly, check-in was a breeze and we were given a warm cloth to freshen up with and a champagne welcome in our room. We did a lot of activities around the island, but we always loved to go back to the hotel at night, walk the gorgeous beach, and just relax on the grounds. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.

<Title>“Great Value for a Resort”
<Content>This was a great place if you want to be away from all the crowds of Kaanapali, or Wailea. The hotel is very nice, beautiful grounds, excellent beach, helpful staff. Rooms are adequate, clean, and come with free safe, coffee, fridge. The pool is plenty big enough for this hotel. We spent a lot of time down there lounging around and there was never a time when even half of the chairs were filled. No people fighting for spots by putting towels down at 6:00 am. In fact we are sun wimps and they have cabanas around the outside of the pool area for free. We never had any trouble getting one of those either. The trip to Molokini was great. Largest Koi I've ever seen in their pond. The golf courses at Makena are very nice (played 3 rounds) and I heard comments from others in my foursomes that they were in much better shape and better views than the 3 Wailea courses. Believe that stuff about putts breaking toward the water! Those that talked about bugs in other reviews are right, you are in Hawaii and it is a tropical environment. There are wierd bugs from time to time. We saw some great walking sticks, green grasshoppers, beetles, etc. Only saw one bug in our room, but hey, they tell you to leave your slider closed to avoid that. They must have read that comment a while back about cobwebs, because I saw them cleaning walls and cielings with brooms during the entire trip. I paid for a Prime Ocean view room and at first they put us on the 2nd floor. I was a little dissapointed and asked the front desk if there was something higher up. They promptly moved me to a 5th (top) floor room with an excellent view. I appreciated their help with that. One negative thing shows my cheapness. We had our house on the market and it sold during our vacation. Had to send faxes back and forth to sign the papers. They allowed received faxes for free, but charge $3 a page to transmit?? Cost me $45 with taxes for a 15 page fax? Also they charged $8 for 15 minutes on the internet. You can do better in Kehei at the internet cafe. Other things of note about the Prince: The store is great with many grocery items you can purchase to have breakfast in your room, etc. It is only a couple miles from the Wailea shops mall, 5-8 miles from Kehei where there are many restaurants, stores, etc. The long haul is up to Lahaina and Kaanapali, but it really only takes 30-40 minutes, so it wasn't that bad. Haleakala was great, do it the first morning you get there and the 3:00 am rise time will not bother you with the time difference. Snorkeling from the beach in front of the hotel will yield great fun with Sea Turtles. Over all this was a wonderful vacation. I don't like those places that are crowded and over glitzed to the point that they want to charge you $400 a night per room to pay for all the glitz. If you want to sleep with the stars, go up the road to the Fairmont Kea Lani. They will charge you a lot for nothing except the room is decorated fancier and you may see a celeb now and then. PS - We had dinner for our 25th anniversary at Sarento's on the beach at Kehei and had a great meal, plus we sat next to Magic Johnson.

<Title>“Great Vacation at the Prince”
<Content>I wasn't quite sure what to expect after reading the reviews, but I was very pleasantly suprised. We were there for the Maui King's Trail Triathlon. The hotel had to accomodate hundreds of bicyclists with their bicycles as well as lots of activities at the hotel. They did an amazing job - and ALWAYS with a smile. I am seldom on a trip where every employee at the hotel is welcoming. I cannot think of a time when an employee passed me and did not say hello. While in some ways the rooms may be a bit tired, overall, the hotel looks good and is well maintained. The gardens are beautiful. This hotel is at the end of the road passed Wailea. I loved the quiet of the area. And the Prince has what I consider one of the best beaches on Maui. Calm, blue and full of fish and turtles. If you want a place that is quiet abd beautiful, and don't need a place with lots of activities for the kids, I highly recommend the Maui Prince.

<Content>Our stay was perfect at this four star hotel. We had over twenty five relatives from six states at various rooms within the hotel. We had a partial ocean view room on the lobby level for our family of four. Our room was nice but not extravagent. The view of the pool, ocean, and grounds from the balcony was very pretty. Our children were part of "the kid's eat free" package which was great. The flowers and koi pond on the grounds were beautiful. The room service was quick and food prepartation was exceptional. We ate almost all of our meals at the hotel and were never disappointed. The sunday brunch was incredible. The pools are average, but we were not there to stay at the pools all day. The cabana's were free, a bonus, if needed. The beach was the highlight. Expansive and uncrowded, swimming and snorkeling was perfect. Turltes visited every day to the coral reef twenty yards off the beach. The golf course was five stars. We played the south course and the views of the ocean and island were breathtaking. We rented clubs (talyor made r580 driver and RAC irons) and they were almost brand new. I would definitely stay again at the Maui Prince.

<Content>We just stayed at the Maui Prince for 8 days for our wedding. Our friends and family occupied 45 of the rooms and EVERYONE had a great experience at the Prince. Unlike large hotels, this is smaller with a peaceful setting - not much night life but very relaxing. We would come back because of the staff: extremely helpful and friendly. We (including our friends) would highly recommend the Prince and it is located on some of the best snorkling and white sands beaches in Maui. The drawback - night life. Nothing much to do on this side of the island.

<Title>“Very disappointed at the Maui Prince”
<Content>Within 15 minutes of checking into our room we kept hearing a loud banging noise. I went back to the front desk and informed the lady that this would be unacceptable. She then referred me to her manager (Michael) who told me they could move us to another room for $90 per night, otherwise we would just have to live with the noise. We had already payed a premium for an ocean view room and I felt this was an excessive increase just to get a quiet nights sleep. Michael promised to investigate the noise and get back to me. That was the last we heard from him. Not to mention, the bed was the most uncomfortable we have ever slept in. We booked our trip through the Auto club of southern california. I will never do that again, nor will we be staying at the Maui Prince next November when we return to the Island. Several people whom we met in Oahu had nothing good to say about the Maui Prince, so it seems that their reputation already has been tarnished. Shame on you Maui Prince and the Auto Club for not knowing better.

If you are looking for a relaxing vacation, the Prince is great. If you are looking for energy and excitement, don't stay at the Prince. Our room was nice, the people were friendly. We have no complaints. Now about the price. You can get good deals through the internet (such as on expedia.com). for $200 or so a night including car you can't beat it.

<Title>“Wonderful hotel in perfect Hawaiian setting”
<Content>Our family of four spent a wonderful week at the Maui Prince hotel in late March/early April. We had an excellent experience all around. The staff was always courteous, friendly and helpful. While not the most deluxe decor in the area, the hotel and grounds were clean and well maintained. Our "Prime Oceanview room" was just that, great views of the ocean, pool, volcanoes and gardens. Very, very nice. The room was large enough for the four of us to spend a week together in and the lanai was great for family card games and watching sunsets. I would recommend paying the upgrade for the prime ocean view. We found the hotel's location and setting of natural beauty to be perfect . The beach was gorgeous, with great swimming and snorkeling and even a few days of great waves for jumping. Many excursion boats to Molokini also make a stop near the Maui Prince hotel beach area because the snorkeling is so great. We saw loads of sea turtles in the coves right near the hotel beach. The pool, while on the small side, was perfectly adequate for our kids, ages 17 and 10. They also enjoyed the hot tubs! You cannot even see another resort from the Maui Prince Hotel. The setting alone was worth the trip. The hotel feels very secluded and is a peaceful, quiet place, even when fully booked as it was while we were there. The other resorts in the area (Fairmont Kea Lani, Grand Wailea) have more of a waterpark feel to them, with crowds and noise and hassles. None of that at the Maui Prince. It never felt crowded at all. (Also, no trouble with bugs or odors nor did we notice any scuffed walls as written in an earlier review.) All in all, we had a great experience and the Maui Prince Hotel would be our choice again if we are ever lucky enough to go back.

<Title>“Just okay...expected above average from previous reviews.”
<Content>We had reserved 3 rooms...ocean views. The ocean could be seen only after going out onto the balcony and turning our heads towards the ocean...otherwise it overlooked a dirt lot (construction area which the hotel overlooked to mention). The staff at the front desk and concierge could have cared less who was their customer. The bell and housekeeping crew were the only helpful bunch. Not worth the money...we ended up spending a lot more to upgrade all three rooms to oceanview prime...if we would have known that we would have stayed at a 5 star hotel, since we ended up spending just as much anyway. The beach was secluded...nice. We travel as a family a lot, and will definitely stay elsewhere next time.

<Title>“Perfect for people who love the beach”
<Content>My husband and I spent the first week of our honeymoon at the Maui Prince (March 28-April 3) and we really enjoyed our stay there. I have to agree with some of the reviews that say the resort is outdated -- it has a little bit of a 70s time warp feel to it. It reminds me of the Contemporary Resort at Disney World in that it used to be very sleek and modern but now it's just a retro concrete building. However, the grounds are lovely and lush and overall we liked the look and feel of the resort. Somebody mentioned that there were lots of cobwebs but I beg to differ. There are lots of webs -- but most of them contain living spiders and that's to be expected when the atrium and grounds are so full of live plants and flowers. It's not as if there are ugly webs around from a lack of cleaning. As for the note card about bugs: ours said they had little flying gnats that didn't bite but were small enough to fit through the screening on the lanai doors and recommended that you keep the glass door shut if you wanted to avoid them. The only bugs we saw on our stay were spiders and a praying mantis. Nothing gross like roaches. The real selling part of the Prince for us was the proximity to the beach. It's just steps away from the hotel, it's beautiful, and it's nearly empty most of the time. Plus the hotel provides free full sized lounge chairs and towels. You can swim and snorkel right from the beach and we saw plenty of sea turtles swimming just off shore around the rocks. The views of Molokini, Koholawe, and West Maui are beautiful too. The activity hut is close by and the restrooms and pool bar are close enough to walk to when you need a quick refreshment. If you're a swimmer, it's possible to snorkel over to Little Beach and maybe even Big Beach if you're feeling ambitious. They are both easily reached by car -- about a 5 minute drive from the hotel. We also really enjoyed the services of the Kai Kanani catamaran that left right from the beach at the Price. We went on the snorkel trip to Molokini and on a whale watching cruise and both were awesome. The staff was very personable and I can't even tell you how convenient it is to hop on the boat right at the beach...or being able to flop on a lounge chair the second you return from your trip. Molokini was virtually deserted when we visited with Kai Kanani because it's so close to the Prince (maybe 20 minutes by boat). Our only problem overall was with the restaurants. It was hard to get a reservation some nights and one day the only place open was the Japanese restaurant and that was expensive and not exactly our cup of tea. However, the breakfast buffet was great and the hotel is quite close to Wailea where there are many places to eat and also only about 15 minutes from Kihei where there are even more places to eat (and some less expensive places too!). I'd have to admit that the TV set was pretty lame too -- old and with weak reception. But honestly, I didn't come to Hawaii to watch TV so after looking at it on the first day I kind of laughed at it, shut the cabinet and didn't give it another thought. The bottom line: if you're the type of person who loves the beach and the ocean and you're looking for a quiet vacation, you you probably can't pick a better place than the Maui Prince. (It was absolutely perfect for us!) But if you're looking for pampering and a fancy pool, you'll be better off somewhere else.

<Title>“You don't get whay you pay for here...”
<Content>At some overpriced hotels, at least the employees pretend like they care about their jobs. Not here. We paid for an oceanview king room. We got a view of a lawn or maybe is was a tennis court under construction instead. This place still hires and keeps the kind of employees who look you up and down before they decide if they will allow you to eat at their restaurants. We must not have passed muster with the stuffy, bitter woman who guarded the entry to the restaurant, because first she told us that reservations were required, then told us that we could not make reservations for another 1 1/2 hours. This was at 7:00 PM even though the restaurant was not even half full. When I said we could eat at the bar, as we had the night before, she said no, we wouldn't like that food either. Then she said we should eat at the Japanese restaurant downstairs instead. We did, and it was an excellent meal, but I almost choked when the bill came- $91.00 for just two people. I should've done an end run around the stuffy woman and eaten in the bar anyway. Checking out the next morning took over an hour, and I spoke to three desk clerks, before they went into another room to have a conference over my bill. I was so disappointed with what was from the outside a very pretty hotel, with beautiful landscaping. but that couldn't make up for employees who hate their jobs and all of their customers. If I go back to Maui, it'll be to some other hotel.

<Title>“All our Dreams come true...”
<Content>My Husband and I spent 7 nights at the Maui Prince Hotel and have had the best holiday ever. We read the reviews before we went and even though the valet team impressively rushed to assist us with our bags upon arrival and the check in went smoothly, we still approached our door with some trepidation incase the "smell" rumour was true... No, it was not. As we entered our room, we were first greeted with a beautiful fresh smell, followed by a bigger than expected room, and then the cherry on the cake, a beautiful view of palm trees and partial ocean. I can only assume that those reviews which are not so complimentary of the Maui Prince are those from people who have opted for the cheapest rooms furthest back from the Ocean. For the sake of a few dollars more, book yourself the next one up and you'll have a great place to stay. The oasis in the middle of the hotel is like nothing I've seen before and was just stunning - it was all just so perfect....right on the beach, quiet surroundings, although not far from shops and restaurants for which the hotel lay on a minibus to get to if you wish to use it, but the restuarants in the Maui Prince were superb, and I have to say we loved our room so much that we spoilt ourselves with Room Service more than once....the price was so reasonable how could we refuse? Maui is the most magical holiday we have ever had and it would not have been so without the Maui Prince Hotel.

<Title>“Great, Quiet Place to Stay”
<Content>We just returned from our honeymoon at the Maui Prince. We had a lovely time. The rooms were big and the ocean views were beautiful. We had no problems with bugs whatsoever. It was nice that the hotel was not that full; it was nice to lounge by the gorgeous beach and the pool was also very nice (it is not too small). Only ate at Hakone, the Japanese restaurant, and it was decent. If you want more luxury, we spent some time at the 4 Seasons down the road, which was absolutely gorgeous. I recommend staying on this south side of Maui, as it is so beautiful, much warmer, and less touristy. If you are watching your budget, there is nothing wrong with the Maui Prince, and I promise I am a picky traveler!

<Title>“Middle of the road hotel”
<Content>Just returned from a trip to Maui. I was fortunate to win airline tickets to Hawaii at my company's holiday party, and used this website to gauge what hotel to book for Maui. I was looking for a "mid-priced" hotel, as our last trip to Kauai was nearly a disaster when we tried to do a budget vacation. I would like to say that I was generally content with my stay at the Maui Prince. The location was lovely, the beach is one of the best on Maui, the charter service for trips to Molokini or whale watching was fun and generally the service was good. But, the rooms are small, which is a big deal when the weather isn't good (our bad luck again on our 2nd trip to Hawaii). The entire hotel needs updating, which if they don't start soon, it will start to look run-down. The wait-staff at the hotel restaurants was marginal, as will happen when you concentrate on buffet breakfasts and dinners. The kicker is, when you check out the other hotels in that area, although they are more expensive, the professionalism is top notch, ie, you get what you pay for. And if you can put up with a garden or mountain view at the Four Seasons or Kea Lani, you will spend about the same amount of money as the Oceanview prime at the Maui Prince. The hotel was a good choice for a first time visit to Maui, but I think we can do better next time.

<Title>“Peaceful, great scenery, outdated hotel”
<Content>We stayed here 7-12th February 2004.Location: The hotel is out on its own but I don't think that really matters - we didnt even have a car, but used the free hotel bus to take us to the shops at wailea and the other hotels on a daily basis - you can even ring them up once you have finished your meal.The beach is amazing and in a 15 minute walk you can also reach Big Beach which is one of the most photographed beaches. The beach hut is a rip off - about $20 a day to hire snorkel and fins - you can go to a shop at the shops at waliea and you pay less than that for a full weeks hire! The sunbeds are free on the beach but if you want a cabana which is basically a bit of cloth providing some shade you have to pay ?15 a day - i though this was scandalous - nobody uses them. I complained to the hotel as we have a 6 month old baby so the beach was off limits to us alot of the day as there was no shade - the hotel said its a separate company (yet you can charge hire eqpt to your room...) Free beds and cabanas at the pool - a few reviewers have mentioned the pool is small - it never crossed my mind.Food: very expensive at hotel and in maui, you can easily spend 200 dollars on a meal (four seasons) and $110 in the hotel for two people. My main gripe with the maui prince is that you come to hawaai and you expect to be able to sit outside to have your food - all evening restaurants and the one bar are all inside - thats why the molokini bar is deserted - who wants that. The cafe where you have breakfast in teh morning is outdoors, i dont know why that cant be opened up at night - the setting is very nice. We ate at the hakone japenese buffett - it was ok, nothing amazing. we ate twice at the four seasons, spago and another one outside (italian) - both were amazing food, amazing service. Longis is good for breakfast at the shops at waliea, tommy bahamas good for lunch and the seawatch restaurant at the g9olf course is very good.We did the early morning snorkel trip to Molokini from the hotel and that was excellent - we saw whales on the way out.the hotel and rooms are very very dated, it feels like the 1970's. Then you go to another hotel and see what a resort hotel is all about - if you have the cash - dont stay here, stay at the four seasons. Th maui prince has the scenery, the beach, great spot, the grounds, but outdated decor and no outside dining let it down

<Title>“Heaven on Maui”
<Content>We were at the Maui Prince from Feb. 13th thru Feb. 20th, and it was awesome. Any trip is going to be what you make of it, but at least at the Prince you don't have to work hard. Everyone was ALWAYS helpful, and pleasant, we even had a blast with the valett drivers. This trip was to celebrate our anniversary and the 1st time we ever took a "grown-up" trip with out our kid's. The Maui Prince was quiet, and clean, the views were breath-taking, and it more then meet our expectations. We visited the Kanapalii area, and it was so busy, and loud, and a million people and kids everywhere, it was nice to drive back to our quiet little piece of the island. If your looking a for fast paced, action filled, loud vacation, then the Prince is not for you. However, if your looking for someplace to relax, enjoy the ocean, and scenery and be surrounded by God's beauty.....the Prince is for you. Yes it's an older, not as "flashy" as some other resorts, but who really want's that on vacation? Another seceret to help the dollars not to fly from your wallett, ask the locals where to eat, they know all the secerets, we were told to plan on $100 per day for meals, we never came close to that, and we splurged on several dinners. Another mus do is the snorkel trip with Pacific Whale foundation, these people LOVE their job's, they live to educate mainlanders on their home, and their neighbors in the ocean!

<Content>I have traveled all over the world and have stayed at some spectacular places-while the maui prince is not the top of the heap-it certainly is an excellent place to stay-rooms are CLEAN and smell fine-The staff is great and helpful-the place is quiet-the beach is about the nicest there is-I drove to most of them-the pool is not spectacular,but it is nice ,clean and certainly big enough to hold the 2 people that are in it at a time.If you want to stay somewhere and save money to spend on food and whale watching,this is the place-The Four Seasons is SPECTACULAR-The beach sucks and the louge chairs are on top of each other-go there to eat,or if you want the best money can buy-Tips:Halakelka is worthwhile going to-you can go at sunset and avoid getting up at 4am-Driving to Hana is a waste of time -if you have done any traveling at all,avoid this- Book any trips at Barefoot bobs in Lahaina(sp?) it gives you the best prices with no time share-you can book over the phone-Nicks fishmarket at the Fairmont is goregous for setting,very marginal on food- it is a rip off-Kaanapali is a joke-hotels on top of each other-feels like you are in Florida-GO WHALE WATCHING-Eat at Longeys at least once-Eat at Tommy Bahama cafe in Wailea-Have a great time!

<Title>“Clean, serene and authentic - we loved it.”
<Content>We stayed at the Prince for 10 nights (2/12-2/19), booking a decent deal through Hotwire for something like $190/night or so. We arrived to a complementary valet, an exceedingly pleasant staff, shell leis and refreshing cool cloths, and were shown to our great room (207) with a king size bed, private balcony with a view of the ocean and golf course, and a bathroom suite with separate shower and bathtubs. There was also an area with a small fridge, a cofeee maker, and the complementary gift basket. The room was more than adequate, but certainly not ultra-crazy-luxury hotel style.We did manage to take a peek at the other area resorts in Wailea, e.g. Grand Wailea, Outrigger Mariott Mailea; while they certainly had fancier decor and an insane amount of fountains and pools, nothing came close to the authentic yet thoughtfully assembled ambience of the Maui Prince, with its breathtaking inner courtyard with colorful koi fish, waterfalls, and Hawaiian birds amidst a mini-tropical-forest.The beach was extraordinary. Clear waters, and calmer toward after mid-day, with fantastic snorkeling with myriad colorful tropical fish off mostly to the left side of the beach near the coral, and even two giant sea turtles near a coral formation toward the center of the beach. And, despite staying for over a week, we had nearly perfect weather on every single day, save for a one or two cloudy nights when we didn't see all the stars there were to offer. There is also a beach activities counter, which rents out various things, and also where you get and return complimentary fresh beach towels. The snorkel rentals, however, can get excessive -- you might be well-advised to stop by one of the stores in Kihei and grab snorkeling gear or a boogie board if you're so inclined, and staying in town for more than a couple of days. We actually bought an inflatable raft that I ripped to shreds against the coral when I brought it to La Perouse bay to go snorkeling (see below).If you go, definitely take advantage of the 6:45 am - 8:45 am Molokini boat / snorkeling trip ($39/person,needs reservations). We saw whales on our way back, and were the only ones at the underwater crater for the time we were snorkeling there --- and the boat leaves right from the hotel's beach! Something to think about doing your first or second day there, while you're still jetlagged.The pools were smaller than the ridiculously titanic ones of the Grand Wailea, but we found them more than adequate, believe it or not. The pool area is done nicely, with one larger deeper 5'-6' pool, and another shallower 3-4' pool, and then two hot tubs in another area, surrounded by well-maintained and beautiful gardens, and a less-than-20-seconds walk to the beach.There were also a few activities that we tried poolside, which were a nice change of pace -- mostly weaving crafts. There's also a free Tennis machine clinic on Tuesday morning at the Makena Tennis/Golf club down the street that we tried out which was great. The hotel also provides shuffleboard, badminton, bocce, putting green equipment, and croquet for free -- which was fun at times after snorkeling to exhaustion at the beach.We ate at all the hotel restaurants. Prince Court Sunday brunch was excellent (I'd say worth the $40 or so) with an outstanding assortment of both local and standard brunch cuisine. Likewise, we tried the Japanese buffet at Hakone on Monday night (again $40 or so), which was also excellent -- although we had hoped there would be more prepared sushi than sashimi! We also liked the breakfast offerings at Cafe Kiowai -- the breakfast buffet is fantastic. In sum, there is definitely a Japanese-influence on the cuisine at the Prince, which we definitely appreciated. Molokini Lounge was okay, but largely underpopulated -- in reality, it's sort of an extension off of the area where the Prince Court restaurant sits.I'm not quite sure what the reviewer who mentioned a musty-smelling room with a turn dial was talking about. We had a well-appointed room with modern equipment (we even reviewed our charges and checked-out through the set-top box), and there was no musty smell.Also regarding an earlier review about the funky smell in room 446, our room definitely didn't have anything like that. Our experiences with the staff were that they bent over backwards to address anything that we might have questions or issues about. I was overly concerned about what would happen if the in-room safe ran out of battery power for the digital lock, and they sent a guy over in less than 10 minutes to check it out and explain the emergency unlock master key access.Otherwise, regardless of where you stay, I'd highly recommend the snorkeling down the road a bit in Makena in La Perouse bay. If you continue on the road past the Maui Prince Hotel and drive until you pass the lava fields, there's a trail before the paved road ends off to the right that leads through a brief lava field to some coves with OUTSTANDING snorkeling, probably better than Molokini at the time we went -- one family we ran into even saw a dolphin in one of the coves at about 7:30 a.m. (before we showed up).Dining can also be pricey, but we still enjoyed restaurants such as the Seawatch, Longhi's (at the Shops at Wailea), Roy's (up the highway about 15 mins), and Sansei over in Kihei (also about 15-20 mins away). If we had to do it over, we probably would've skipped the nearby Lu'au at the Outrigger Marriott, though, unless there was a better deal on it. After phenomenal food at the above restaurants, the Lu'au food seemed pretty unimpressive, though the show was interesting (epecially the fire-knife part at the end).The concierges cater to both Japanese and American tourists, and are bilingual. As such, though, there was so much literature around and people at the resort who had done and seen different things that we had a good idea of what to see & do (e.g. Hana Highway, Haleakala crater, etc.)In all, the resort is definitely out-of-the-way -- plan on an extra 30-45 minute drive to get to Kahalui to begin any of your expeditions to Hana or Haleakala, or even to Lahaina. But for those shunning the at-times gaudy grandeur of the other Wailea resorts, and craving a more peaceful, serene, and arguably authentic but still luxury experience, check out the Maui Prince. That being said, if you want the high-end ultra-luxury experience with waterslides and miles of brass-railing, I'd tend to look toward the other Wailea resorts first, but be prepared to pay more for those hotels.

<Title>“Truely Hawaiian Experience!”
<Content>I was really worried that we had made a mistake staying at the Makena Prince based on the reviews but we are really happy we did! What a great Resort! The staff are fantastic... very hospitable, welcoming and friendly. You really get the Aloha spirit here. Prince staff want you to enjoy your vacation and do there best to ensure it! Architecturally this hotel is unique. The property, 1800 acres had a great beach, beautiful grounds and warm inviting restaurants. Big Beach next door is one of the best beaches we have visited in all Hawaii. The court yard, for lack of better description was awesome... water falls, koi pond, miner birds and forested... you really know that you are on a south sea isle when staying here. The other hotels that we visited: Kea Lani, Four Seasons, Grand Wailea are all beautiful especially the Four Seasons (incredible property) but you could be sitting anywhere in the southern U.S.. At the Prince you know you are away from the continential U.S. and will truly have a Hawaiian Experience. Yes the pool is small but is is quiet and uncrowded unlike the other high end resorts. Very few kids? We joined Prince Preferred and were upgraded from Partial Ocean View to Ocean View. It was perfect for whale watching! It is really hard to get a poor view (less than 5%) at this hotel given its design with all rooms facing toward the ocean. If you can get a room ending in the 20s to low 30s they have a view of some of the most spectacular sunsets -- amazingly everyone stops to take them in and shortly thereafter continue with drinks and dinner. Yes the rooms are dated... but very comfortable and clean. Just think of them as Top Notch for the 80s. This hotel allows you to really relax and slow down... each night returning is like heading to your island home. Recommend Seawatch for Breakfast at Wailea Emerald and Gold Golf Club -- the view is extraordinary and the price a little easier on the wallet. Sansei in Kihei and Sarentos (ocean front) just on the edge of Wailea and Kihei are also worthwhile. In Kaanapali, we enjoyed Peter Merriman's Hula Grill! Our best meal for food was definitely David Paul's... on par with the best restaurants of San Francisco, New York and Toronto! Great place to even grab a seat at the bar and be entertained by the staff. Do not miss the Whale Watching and the Maui Ocean Center (especially if you are not a scuba diver)! These 45 tonne mammals leave you awestruck! Pacific Whale Foundation tours were very informative and help fund the preservation and protection of the whales that really allow YOU to be THEIR guests!

<Title>“Better than I expected!”
<Content>I just got back from staying at the Prince for 9 nights (2/3 to 2/12). I was a little worried about our choice after reading some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly releaved. Our room was large, a comfy king size bed, a large lanai with table and chairs with a great view of the golf course and ocean, and a large bathroom with the MOST amazing high-pressure shower, a frig, and a complimentary gift basket upon our arrival. The decor was just ok in my opinion, but I only slept in my room. The beach is excellent, the pools were small, but there was never more than two people in it at a time. The gardens were gorgeous and the staff very friendly. Down the street there was some amazing snorkeling near La Perouse Bay. Prince Court food was great and I too used the Entertainment book coupon. Sunday brunch at Prince Court is reknowned on the island. I snuck in at the Grand Wailea and I was so happy I didn't spend thousands more to stay there. While the lobby is gorgeous (if not a little too extravagant, most looked weird walking around with beach attire in such a palace) The Grand has an over 18 pool (the only relatively quiet part outside). The other pool is a theme park/slide that is so crowded with kids and families. I didn't understand why people just didn't go to Disney. It was fun for the day, but even their beach is crowded - not my idea of an island paradise. I liked Makena because it is convenient to go to Kahului with Walmart and Costco (we stocked up on food, boogie boards and snorkel gear) but it was a drive (45 minutes to an hour) to Lahaina. Met Locals (living in Maui for 8 years) and they think most tourists are better off in Ka'anapali. It really is beautiful there and more convenient, but not as secluded as Makenna (but if you want secluded go to Kauai) I also stopped in the Kapalua Bay Hotel in Kapalua. It is truly beautiful, everything I liked about Maui Prince, it has, only a little more upscale. Very Quiet, nice pool. Anyway, from what the locals say, Maui Prince has a reputation for being a "hawaiian" resort. That's a compliment and you can't go wrong!!!! BTW, you must get HAWAIIAN GOLD pineapples the only pineapples still grown in Maui. SO sweet and little acid :-) Have fun!

<Title>“A perfect Honeymoon”
<Content>Before choosing our honeymoon destination and hotel, I read hundreds of reviews on Trip Advisor. It was importannt to me that we make a great decision with out honeymoon dollars, because it really is a once in a lifetime event. The great reviews for the Maui Prince convinced us to stay tehre. I'm so happy we chose to spend our honeymoon at the Maui Prince in Makena. We were there from 1/2/04-1/9/04. The first days we were there were very rainy, but it didn't detract from the beauty of the area. The concierge was very helpful and went out of their way to help guests find activities. We really enjoyed the secluded feeling of being at Prince, and felt that it was close enough to Kihei and Lahaina for any shopping or off resort dining we wanted. Our room was a good size, and kept very clean by the maid. The bed was very comfortable, and there were extra pillows to be had. The food at the resot is amazing, but pricey. The Seafood Buffet at the Prince Court was worth the cost! To save money, we ordered an Entertainment Book for Hawaii online and brought it with us. The 2004 edition has 2-1 coupons for both Hakone and the Prince Court. Actually by using our Entertainment book at the resort and elsewhere on the island, we saved appx. $170, so we ate well, and didn't have to hurt so bad when the credit card bills came in. Complimentary Valet was awesome! The service at Hakone was superb, but Prince Court was a little snooty. I guess they didn't like the coupon book! :) Really, overall, we loved everything about the place, and would not complain about anything. We enjoyed lounging on the beach, and my husband snorkeled quite a bit. I played in the waves, and soaked up the sun. The grounds were so tranquil and peaceful. In chatting with fellow travelelrs as we wandered around the island, we discovered that the Maui Prince has a great reputation, and we entirely agree.

<Title>“Secluded, peaceful, outstanding retreat.”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Maui Prince for the first two days of our Honeymoon, January 11 through the 13th, and absolutely loved it. We booked on Hotwire for $190 a night and still recieved a complimentary upgrade to a full ocean view room, which had an incredible view of the water/beach and northern half of the island. The balcony was nice, as was the sound of waves below. And we enjoyed the lush environment around the koi pool and nature trail. As everyone says this is the place for a peaceful retreat, and that is just what we were looking for. The hotel met our expectation in every way and we can't wait to go back. Although you can definately say something for the other resorts on Wailea which all seem incredible. Definately the part of Maui to stay on.

<Title>“Over-priced, out of date, bad service”
<Content>If you've ever wondered what it would have been like to stay in a Soviet-era hotel, the Maui Prince is your answer. This austere, aging, behemoth lacks personality and the service is third-rate if not horrible. A slight rain makes the tiled exterior floors a hazard to walk on, especially for seniors. The beach is not great by South Maui standards and for the kind of money you pay at the Maui Prince, you would be far better off staying up the road at Waliea at one of the many first-class resorts there. The extra charges on many things came as a complete shock. The hotel is bad need of a reno, so look around before you get trapped at this place. It's seen better days.

<Title>“Paradise”
<Content>Spent five nights at the Prince last January. The grounds were beautifully designed and well cared for, each room faces the ocean, each with its own VERY PRIVATE lanai, and wonderful restaurants. We really enjoyed the pool area, which was spacious but without waterslides or waterfalls. Because of this, the hotel wasn't loaded with kids, which we really loved. The Prince is the last hotel on the southwest side of Maui, about a 5 - 10 minute drive past the previous hotels, and we just loved the quiet atmosphere, laid back feeling, and privacy of it. We are going back next year, and will definitely stay here again. Spent one night at the Grand Wailaiu, but was way too busy and noisy for us.

<Title>“Perfect!”
<Content>We chose to have our wedding here so were able to secure a block of rooms and a bridal suite at a very good rate. Our suite was amazing! Fantastic view! Our group was there for about a week and everyone received the best service! Free valet parking is a great touch. The pool was small but adequate and a fantastic beach is just a few steps away. The only complaint I would have is that the front reception desk could be a little surly or too professional, almost robot-like. We had a running joke throughout our 3 hotel stay honeymoon that since it was the low season, the hotels put all their in-training personnel to work. It sure seemed like that everywhere we went. The valets here are the best! We had people from our group over almost every night including a large group following our wedding dinner - we always felt like we had so much privacy. Our balcony was perfect for entertaining. After staying in very large suite, it was hard going to a regular hotel room at the Fairmont. I'd chose the Maui Prince over the Fairmont White Orchid (Hawaii) anytime!

<Title>“Don't tell anyone!!”
<Content>I am planning my 5th trip to Hawaii since 1987, and my 4th time staying at the Maui Prince. Makena is the best-kept secret on Maui. Nestled in fields of lava, with a spectacular view of Haleakala Crater and the closest lto Molokini Crater, one does not have that "hotel row" feeling that exists in Kaanapali. It is truly what Hawaii is all about - the peace and serenity of the most magnificent place on Earth. Shhhh!!! Don't tell anyone!!
