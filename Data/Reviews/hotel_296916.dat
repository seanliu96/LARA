<Title>“Comfortable, clean, good location”
<Content>My husband, 8yo daughter, and I stayed at the Hotel Jazz in Barcelona from April 7 - 13, 2012. We had the triple room on the corner of the 3rd floor. It was clean and attractive, and the king-size bed was very comfortable (fold-out bed less so, but perfectly fine for a fold-out bed). The hotel is located within a block of one Metro station and within 2-3 blocks of another, with different lines serving them, so that was convenient. It was mostly pretty quiet except for the recycling/trash pick-up early in the mornings outside, but that bothered me very little; I noticed it but it wasn't terribly loud. My only wishes are that it had had a coffee/tea pot in the room (although there are Starbucks and cafés within 2 blocks) and that the lighting/electrical system had been more convenient. There were some lights that had several switches around the room, some that I never could find out how to work them, and the alarm clock (programmed via what looked like a light switch on the wall next to the bed) went off unexpectedly on our first night there.

<Title>“Location and More”
<Content>The reviews about the location are all true. I can't really imagine a better location in Barcelona. The hotel is so close to the Rambla, the Raval, the Metro, the Placa Univeristad stop of the Aerobus, and more. We walked or took the Metro everywhere. Tons of wonderful resturants and sights are within easy walking distance. The hotel is very clean, the rooms are spacious, the breakfast buffet is ample and delicious. To top it all off, the hotel has a wonderful rooftop deck. We would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Great location in a quiet hotel property”
<Content>We arrived from our cruise ship early in the morning so we were very grateful when the staff was able to immediately assign us a room on a very busy weekendin Barcelona. The rooms are large by European standards and very modern and clean. I loved that I could open the window of the french balcony to view the street below. The lobby is a bit stark, but did not detract from our stay. The breakfast offered a wide variety of choices and was very good! It is a very short walk to La Rambla and Placa de Catalunya from this hotel. The staff were gracious and helpful. The hotel is a very good value for such a great location and generous room size.

<Title>“good hotel”
<Content>We stayed in this hotel for 5 days. It's a very good location next to Old town. Bus from the airport stops right around the corner. The hotel is very clean, modern and comfortable. The only thing - you can here underground trains passing by (we stayed on 7 floor). Otherwise, excellent value for the money, considering great location.

<Title>“A good home-base for exploring Barcelona”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Jazz in April, 2012, for 4 days. We had an on-the- street-side room on the 6th floor. The hotel was clean, comfortable, stylish, and very quiet, with easy-to use, in-room, free wi-fi. We heard occasional people one evening, but we slept well. The street-noise was present, but didn't bother us much. A lighter-sleeper may prefer a room off the street (traffic, street sweepers, 2am-ers, etc could sometimes be heard). The room lighting was excellent; the climate control defaults to 'off', so I'd have to remember to turn it back on; it took a phone call to the desk to figure out how to access the additional cable channels to get BBC (the desk was very nice about it). There is a free in-room safe, and the bed was 2 twins pushed together, which was comfortable and apparently typical. I would have loved to have a facecloth included in the linens. The rooftop solarium and pool were open on the nice days - great views! Also, when you are learning your way around, you can see the edge of the solarium on the roofline from down the street, to help find the hotel. We were not impressed by the continental breakfast - mediocre offerings at a high cost (11 Euros). There are several fabulous little local cafes about a block up the street, heading toward Pl. de Catalunya, on Ronda de Sant Pere. The ambiance, bustle, and great food are worth leaving the hotel for your first cup of coffee. The service at Hotel Jazz was very good. I heard the staff speak Spanish, English, Catalan, and German. They patiently answered my tourist questions, gave directions, fetched hot water for me to bring back to my room for a quiet cup of tea, and loaned umbrellas on rainy days. The location was perfect for our needs. We had a very short (half-block walk) from the Aerobus stop (the shuttle bus from the airport - get off at Universitat, but walk up to Pl. Catalunya to pick it up back to the airport). In addition, the nearest Metro stop was also at Universitat, and La Rambla was just down the street. Very easy starting point to all things Barcelona. The price was a little steeper than we typically like to pay (ok, who REALLY wants to pay anything??), but the overall quality of the hotel, the superb location, and the excellent service made this a very good value. Given the opportunity, I would seriously consider going back.

<Title>“Excellent value for money”
<Content>Excellent value hotel, much better than hoped. Didnt have breakfast but plenty of cafés nearby, in particular, the Foodmarket cafe I can recommend. Great location this hotel and as we had a room facing the interior/ rear it was very quiet indeed. The bed was very firm with two pillows and a blanket/sheets, (no duvet). The room was very smart and the bathroom palatial. The only small negatives being the ventilation in the bathroom didn't work and there was no freebie hair conditioner! Would definitely stay here againacne cause of the value for money, cleanliness and friendly staff. PS Barcelona I found to be chilly, weather forecast said 17-19deg C, too cold for sandals and 3/4 length trousers!

<Title>“Great stay at Hotel Jazz”
<Content>Just come back from a long weekend in Barcelona. Hotel Jazz was in a great location (at the top of La Ramblas). Rooms were clean and modern (although no kettle in room). Excellent shower - although no ventilation unit so when you came out it was like you had been in a sauna! Didnt get to use pool on roof as it was too cold but looked lovely. Our deal didnt come with breakfast so we just headed to local cafes (plenty to choose from!) Reception staff were helpful - asked them to book a restaurant one night that we had been recommended. This was just a simple and chique hotel which is just what you need for a city break.

<Title>“Perfect Location”
<Content>The hotel was easy to reach from Placa Catalunya in 5 minutes, after taking the Airobus from the airport ( at 5.30 euros each way..a brilliant service!) We had difficulty finding the entrance, but one of the concierges realised and came after us. The hotel is so central, modern and the staff are friendly and helpful, with excellent English.Our room was on the 7th floor,quite spacious,with a small balcony and very comfortable twin beds pushed together.Only downside was that after a bath or shower there would be a rather unpleasant odour from the drain.That said, the bedroom was great with good size wardrobes, and plenty of hangers. The breakfast room on the first floor was excellent,with a vast assortment of cereals,cold meats,cheeses, breads and fruit and juices, with great staff who always brought your choice of tea or coffee the moment one walked in each morning.We loved staying here and we thought Barcelona the most stunning city.

<Title>“Really handy for the Rambla and the centre of town”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel a couple of years back and liked it then. We were equally happy this time. It's clean, it's modern, and it doesn't charge silly prices like a good many places in the centre of Barcelona. They have a rooftop swimming pool with great views over the city, so you can have the best of all worlds - eating, shopping and sunbathing within a few minutes of each other. Assuming it doesn't rain, of course, which it does sometimes in Barcelona! The wifi is free so you can always while away the time reading your e-mails. Now that would be sad in a place with so much to do. Staff were friendly and willing to change our room so we had an outside view. In fact, service was pretty good all round here. Rather than getting a taxi from the airport we thought we'd try the airport bus. Brilliant! For 5 Euros 30 cents it drops you right in the Place de Catalunya which is about five minutes walk from the Hotel Jazz. It's really clever - route A1 goes to Terminal 1 and route A2 goes to Terminal 2. It says in big letters on the side which one is which!

<Title>“Fantastic little hotel and awesome location”
<Content>TripAdvisor never fails. This hotel was a gem, and feels very boutique. We stayed in Triple Jazz suite, and the room is so spacious! Location is block from Las Ramblas where many shops and cafes are...10 - 15 walk to beach. Breakfast is not included, but there is a coffee shop directly below and next to hotel. Alexandre who works the night shift while we were there was extremely nice, and helpful.

<Title>“Gem of a hotel in a prime location”
<Content>Just returned from Spain where we spent three nights at Hotel Jazz. We were definitely impressed with the central location and the quality of our room. The hotel is easily accesible from the airport by the airport bus which only costs 5.90 euros each way. The bus from the airport stops at Placa Universitat which is less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel. On the way to the airport, the airport bus stop is at Placa Catalunya right next to Corte Ingles, about less than a 10 minute walk. We literally walked to every sight in Barcelona from our hotel but the metro stop is right next to the hotel for those who prefer to fast track it. The Rambla, Mercat de Boqueria, Barrio Gotico, and so much more are literally walking distance just a few minutes away. I love spaciousness and the decor of our room, the modern bathroom with bidet, hairdyer, electric converter, a safe to keep your valuables. I would definitely stay at Hotel Jazz again and highly recommend it to other travellers. Finally, I would also highly recommend dinner at Les Quinze Nits which is a wonderful and affordable restaurant located in Placa Real just off the Ramblas.

<Title>“Good, not Great Experience”
<Content>We booked this hotel for three nights - 4/2 - 4/5/12 - based on the many favorable reviews. While the location was great and the staff willing to help, we had a few complaints: 1. No one available to help with quite a bit of luggage. We're seniors, and schlepping luggage up the ramp and to our rooms was a chore. Ditto on check-out. 2. Room was hot and stuffy. Air conditioning didn't work. Called the front desk the first evening, and they sent up a maintenance man - he fiddled with the controls and proclaimed it "fixed". It still didn't work. We had to open the window, which let in the street noise. Second day I complained about it to the front desk. When we returned to our room, it still didn't work at all, although we were told that it had again been "fixed". Again, we had to sleep with our window open. 3. Breakfast buffet was OK, although for 11 Euros per person, it lacked any item that would distinguish it from what one would get at a Holiday Inn Express.

<Title>“Value in central Barcelona”
<Content>Spent the better part of a week in Barcelona at Hotel 1898 and Hotel Jazz. Both are centrally located, have convenient subway access and rooftop pools. Jazz is considerably cheaper than 1898, though they are both part of the same hotel group. Underground parking is available in the building which works really well for travelers with rental cars. Jazz offers a low cost buffet - 12 euros, though we never at in. Staff are very friendly and were able to provide maps, route guidance and whatever we needed. Due to an error on our part, we showed up a day late on our booking. Management reversed the no-show charge and gave us a credit on our stay. Very much appreciated. We would recommend this hotel to value conscious travelers.

<Title>“Perfect location, Great rooms, Even better price.”
<Content>My husband and I are 26 years old and had never been to Barcelona, and we stayed here due to Trip Advisor reviews. The location is unbeatable - right next to the metro, and walking distance to the pier, las ramblas street, shopping, etc. Rooms remind me of a W hotel - very trendy/modern and a good size. Reception down front is very helpful and we felt extremely safe at Hotel Jazz. Make sure and get a sangria from the hotel bar - SO good and so reasonably priced!! The rooftop pool is a plus, too! You won't regret staying here.

<Title>“Lovely Hotel!”
<Content>We were early, and were allowed to book in and get settled straight away, which is always a great start. Rooms were perfect, and in fact were better than expected for a 3* hotel. It couldn't have been better situated for the Las Ramblas, but far enough away not to be distrurbed by noise. The only noise we experienced was other residents knocking on their door at silly o'clock! However, if you listened carefully you occasionally heard the rumble of the metro, but it never disturbed us. For transport to the Hotel, highly recommended is the Airport Aerobus, which stops right at the Universitat, which is seconds away fromt he Hotel, so don't lay out for a taxi as it is totally not worth the extra spend, the fare was 5 euro 3 cents, well worth it.

<Content>We stayed 5 night at the Jazz Hotel. The location is perfect, two blocks from the top of Las Rambles and a major train/metro stop of Placa de Catalunya. The room was quiet, spacious and well kept. The front desk staff was very helpful. I sprained my ankle and they told me where to go to the hospital and were helpful with other advise. Staying right on Las Ramblas would have been noisy. This was perfect in every way!

<Content>Just yards from Placa de Catalunya and next to Universitat metro so centrally placed and within walking distance of most of the places we wanted to visit. The room we had on the 7th floor was clean andspacious with a balconly, had a decent king bed, a large bathroom, and no late night noises from the street. It was however really warm with no control over the air con.We had no problems with the shower, though I do think that the shower screen could have been a tad longer, the bath towels a little bigger and the toiletries could have been restocked more frequently. The breakfasts were really good with the selection changed daily, even the tea was strong enough to be drinkable! All in all a really good hotel, great location and I would certainly look to the Jazz for our next visit to Barcelona

<Title>“Great Location for First Time Visitor to Barcelona”
<Content>The Hotel Jazz is a modern, stylish hotel with a great location for the first time visitor to Barcelona. Rooms are modern and cheerful but have no views. Mine looked onto an interior courtyard, but was very quiet, which is a plus because I found Barcelona to be a noisy city. I was on a high floor and did notice the rumblings from the Metro but it never bothered me. The pros of this hotel are as follows: · Good price, at least in the off season · Friendly helpful, English-speaking staff · Warm and cheerful décor. Nice roof deck with a plunge pool Free wi-fi · They provide an assortment of in room amenities such as dental kit, comb, etc. Note though, as typical for many European hotels – there was shampoo provided but no conditioner. · There were a few minor negatives: · The heat/AC control in the room was initially difficult to figure out · TV reception was poor for English speaking channels. · I though the lobby was very sterile compared to other hotels in this chain. · There was free wi-fi but you had to sign on almost every time you used it; I found this to be annoying. Probably the biggest plus of the hotel is the location for first-time visitors: It was a five minute walk to Las Ramblas, and probably no more than ten minutes to the Gothic quarter; a ten minutes walk to Passeig de Gravis and 25 minute walk to the Magic Fountain. If you are a good walker, and stay at the Hotel Jazz, your use of public transportation and/or cabs should be minimal. Although I had a good stay here, if I were to return to Barcelona, I would probably stay in a hotel closer to the heart of the Eixample, my favorite district. But for a first time visitor, it was fine.

Service was good, the room was modern and clean. Despite the location it was very quiet at night. Unfortunately, it was too cold to make use of the roof top pool.

<Content>The reviews of this hotel are consistently good for a reason. This is a great hotel. The part that was the most pleasant surprise was the English fluency of their staff. I was prepared for the basics of communication, but these guys were just great. The only thing that would have made this get 5.5 stars (out of 5) is if the pool was heated. Perhaps they heat it in the summer, but it would have been nice to use the pool rather than just sit next to it and enjoy the view.

All the staff were very helpful. Easy walk to the tourist buses, metro and La Rambla.

<Content>We chose from internet because of the location, and the location is priceless! this hotel has large rooms, and large bathrooms provided with everything from toothbrush to a shaving set. The rooms are quiet, the beds are very comfortable, the decor modern and stylish. The reception desk is friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet is plentiful, many juices and the orange juice is freshly pressed. However the prices quoted do not include tax, so expect to pay a bit more. the hotel also has a garage (for extra charge) because there is the subway, buses, and taxis all over and close by, so you really don't need a car. Great hotel for a visit to this wonderful city!

<Content>We chose this hotel for its ease of access to the airport and main attractions, and weren't disappointed. This makes it ideal if you're travelling with a child (as we were). The room was large, clean and well-equipped - apart from the lack of tea and coffee making facilities. It was also quiet, with no noise from within the hotel, and just occasional street noise. We were on the fourth floor and you could just about hear the subway, but it certainly didn't disturb us. The bar/restaurant are in a strange location on the first floor and seemed deserted. We didn't have breakfast there as there are plenty of places nearby.

I would love to go back in the warmer weather to make use of the roof top pool. We loved this hotel, and the location can not be beat. An easy walk to Plaza Cataluyna, a hub for the metro, and an easy walk to La Rambla, the Barri Gotic, and also the Eixample. Definitely recommend it.

<Title>“One of the best boutique hotels in BCN”
<Content>My second stay here. As always - a warm welcome. Compared to many hotels of this size, the rooms are quiet spacious. It's is very clean & well maintained hotel. Bed very comfortable. Rooftop bar & pool-but due to weather was all closed. The bar is a bit soulless ( & expensive) - but there are no shortage of bars nearby. Handy for public transport. From the airport bus stop ( university square) it is less than 5 minutes walk. Perfect location for me, handy for metro, Ramblas & medium distance buses.

<Title>“CLEAN, CLASSY AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, CENTRAL FOR BARCELONA!”
<Content>Just got back from staying at the Hotel Jazz with my girlfriend for a romantic trip away. Here are the low-downs you'll want to know: 1. Doesnt get much more central than this - a stroll to pretty much anywhere decent! Most other reviewers are right when they say, this is a great location, it really is, and so easy to get to using the Aerobus from the airport (5 euros approx one way). 2. Close to Pl Cataluyna metro stop which is one of the metro stops which many lines cross 3. Its clean, its smart, it's modern and has everything you need (aside from an Iron - got to say we were surprised at that!). If you want to iron something, either take a travel iron with you, or use their ironing service - it's your only option! There is no iron in the hotel that they can give you. Btw, the bed we had was MASSIVE. Ask for a double bed - we even lost each other during the night sometimes, lol! The bed is also extremely comfortable. 4. Ask for a room higher up, you will get much less traffic noise. We had a room on the top floor and noise was no problem - we even slept with the windows open most nights (as rooms can get warm). Yes, you here the metro rumble past sometimes, even on the top floor, but this is no issue at all. To be honest, its a nice feeling to know your in a vibrant city. 4. All the staff we encountered were very pleasant and not one of them rude (which from what we've seen/read, can sometimes be a problem in Barca) 5. The servive was very good - room service was especially good and prompt. We pretty much used it every day for a quick breakfast fix! Overall, we had a fantastic and very memorable stay in Barcelona, and Hotel Jazz played their part in that.

<Content>Great hotel, in a fantastic city location. Very quiet. Rooms were clean and so comfortable. Bar was expensive, however we found a great Irish bar around the corner, which was much cheaper. Would defiantly go back.

<Title>“Perfect!”
<Content>Easy to find, close to public transport, close to the main things you want to see/do (minutes walk from La Rambla while being far enough way to not have the crowds), great staff with excellent English (my Spanish is woeful), rooms exactly as portrayed on the website, good value. I can't think of one negative thing to say about this hotel and I would definitely stay here again. We did not use the breakfast option as there are local options in the area (Food Market Cafe/Creperia del Mar) that are well worth visiting. Note that the stop on the airport bus that is indicated as being closest to the hotel was not obvious to us and we ended up at Placa de Catalunya... still an easy less than 5-minute stroll from this main transport hub.

<Title>“central to city but away from noise of La Rambla”
<Content>Great buffet breakfast with eggs, lots of cured meats and bacon, cheese, pastries, fresh fruit and juices for 11,90 euro (1/2 price for children).  Friendly responsive help. Free wireless or wired Internet - be sure to ask for login information at front desk.  Shower doesn't offer a lot of privacy in bathroom due to short glass partition and no shower curtain.  Lots of space in room with hard wood floors and contemporary colors and furnishings. Door opens so you can get fresh air in the room.  Was able to check in early but got a room on third floor over hotel entrance across from elevator (noisy when trying to sleep during day due to jet lag).  Safe didn't work and no one could fix because it was the weekend.  Safe area.  What is that rumbling noise every 30 minutes?  Must be the metro system...which is very close to the hotel and easy to use to get around town

<Title>“One snazzy hotel in a great city”
<Content>The Jazz is exactly as shown in the photos on their webpage. The rooms are very comtemporary with the wow factor. They are a spacious room with every thought given to the smallest detail in design. Wardrobe space is fantastic, while the bathroom is rather spacious for a hotel. The reception staff are extremely friendly and helpful and nothing is too much trouble. We had trouble with our boarding passes for the airport before leaving and they kindly let us use the computer in reception to sort the issue. The hotel is in a great location. Just a 5 minute walk to the main square, Plaza de Catalunya, from where the tourist buses and the aerobus arrive and depart.It is also here that Ramblas begins On reading previous reviews we asked for a room on one of the upper floors and have to say that we did not hear any noise, in fact I slept very well during our stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a comfortable stay in Barcelona.

<Title>“Nice rooms, decent buffet”
<Content>Nice rooms, decent breakfast buffet (for an extra charge), but considering that the only other breakfast you can find at 7 in the morning in Barcelona is mostly some sort of bread and a single cup of coffee, an endless pot of coffee is a plus. We were also doing some work that required printing several reports. I just took a USB drive to the front desk and they printed for no charge--loved that service! In-room safes were pretty roomy--we put in two 11" laptops with no problem, and I think I could have gotten in a 15" if I wanted to. Keycards are required for the elevator, so nobody can get to any floors above the lobby without a keycard. That's good for security, but if you are meeting someone in the bar, you need to keep an eye out for them to bring them up. But you won't be meeting many people in the bar because try finding a bar tender or even an attendant in the afternoon. We learned to tell the front desk when we were going so they could rustle up somebody. The room often wasn't cleaned until late afternoon, even when we put out the "Please clean" sign. We would have liked it cleaned a little longer. Also, the wireless works well and is speedy, but they user an older authentication method that requires you to login every time you wake up your computer--that's just annoying. It should be set to remember your computer for 24 hours. We didn't see the pool as we were there during the recent cold snap. Overall, when we return to Barcelona, we will stay there again.

<Title>“Central Hotel - Good Value”
<Content>Decided to go for the Hotel Jazz mainly due to a very good rate including breakfast. The hotel is very well located, right next to Plaza de Catalunya, on a side street. There is a bus stop and a metro station very very close, literally at the doorstep. Many shops, easy access to the Ramblas, Passeig de Gracia, El Corte Ingles etc... It very convenient to arrive and depart since the aerobus stops very close as well. There are many restaurants nearby, as well as breakfast options. Rooms are very well appointed, modern and clean, as well as bathrooms. Shower is a little low and it makes the floor wet, but that is a minor con. Got a room on the 5th floor and yes, I could slightly hear the metro underneath but only if I paid very close attention. It does not bother your sleep. Front desk staff are very helpful to give directions but nobody (not even doormen) help with luggage. Not a single move. Breakfast staff on the other hand were very polite and nice, and options very good.

<Title>“Good location , functional, and clean”
<Content>I stayed at this modern hotel for two nights and found it well-run, clean, and perfectly located. Although I had chosen a standard room, I was given a corner room, more like a mini-suite, on the sixth floor. Rooms have their numbers emblazoned very large outside the door. There was plenty of room and lots of light. There were no dressers, but a large built-in closet with plenty of shelving and clothing racks for both my wife and myself. The bathroom had a stall shower and a tub -- all very modern. Our bed was very large, comfortable and faced a flat screen television -- little English language and no CNN or BBC news. There were separate lights for reading on either side of the bed and the electricity of the room was turned on by inserting your room key. Despite being on a high floor, you could hear the muted rumbles of the metro but ironically not the traffic on the busy street. It didn't really bother either of us having lived in New York apartments for many years. The front staff spoke English and was helpful with dinner suggestions. The neighborhood is a bit commercial -- busy on one side and the university nearby. It is truly within walking distance of most high end shopping, tourist shops, good restaurants and department stores. Las Ramblas is down the street as is some of the moderniste architecture. What isn't close is easily accessible by bus and certainly by metro -- the university stop is a short walk away. We did not see the pool area upstairs -- it was January.

<Title>“nice but noisy”
<Content>stayed here for a weekend break. was able to check in and get a room when i arrived at 11am which was great. hotel is modern and clean and very centrally located only a few minutes walk from la ramblas. but........ you can hear the underground trains passing underneath the hotel. i was on the second floor and could hear the rumbling of them passing underneath, and not sure if they can still be heard from rooms on the top floor. also room service are very noisy when they are cleaning the rooms in the morning times. and i could also hear furniture getting dragged constantly across tiled floors. this must have been coming from the bar area on the first floor. also there was a leak in the bar area that no-one seemed too concerned about! so if you are a light sleeper ask for a room on the top floors, other than that, a very nice hotel to stay at.

<Title>“Couldn't be better”
<Content>Just arrived today on the over night flight from Newark. Arrived at the hotel at 0930 and asked if we could drop off the bags. Instead they told us our room was ready (wonderful) and what a great room. Very modern styling, clean as a whistle, view is not wonderful as the location is downtown but that is made up for by the location which is close to Plaza Catalunya and Las Ramblas which in my mind is the best location in Barcelona. All sorts of restaurants and shopping within walking distance. The pool area on the top floor is just lovely, although a bit too cool to use at this time of year. Staff is most helpful and speak excellent English. Beds are comfortable, nice amenities, flat screen tv and reasonably quiet considering the location. Wouldn't stay anywhere else in Barcelona.

<Title>“Good, but they don't value loyalty”
<Content>The Jazz is good. The beds are comfortable. I'd prefer some ventilation in the bathroom as after a shower it's completely humid. The pool is a nice place to cool off, but it would be better if someone tidied up more often. Pool towels get left on stretchers by guests and you don't know if they are coming back or if they just couldn't be bothered to put them in the baskets, so you have nowhere to sit. Very often the poolside towels run out and it can take several calls to get them restocked. But that aside it's good and in a great location. I stayed regularly at the Jazz but have decided to try elsewhere next time - why? Well I've been loyal to them for several years, but never once did they say anything like 'welcome back'. Last time I had, as always, booked a double room. My colleague checked in at the same time as me (he was a first time guest and had booked a single room) and was upgraded to a suite. I've started to think maybe they don't care about repeat custom.

<Title>“Great value for money!!!”
<Content>I look for three things in a hotel, great location, comfy bed and value for money! Safely say Jazz delivers all three! Quiet rooms are a bonus, no scraping upstairs or lift noise! Clean rooms and very reasonable mini bar prices. Great location, and we found the staff pleasant and polite. Didn’t have breakfast in the hotel, so couldn’t comment. Also conscious of safety so i was pleased to see you must use a room key to validate the elevator and use it. Overall, great hotel, my only niggle was the fact we had an inside facing room, so it was quite dark, didn’t get a lot of natural light and rather warm, had to keep the A/C on mostly, it would be quite warm in summer i would think. But i would go back.

<Title>“Fantastic value for $ + great location!”
<Content>Rooms are spacious and well decorated. Toilet was a surprise as it's modern and stark (black deco). We had breakfast on 1 morning in the hotel and was impressed with the quality and selection, else there are a few cafes nearby which offers good breakfast at very reasonable price. Front desk was helpful to recommend Cellars de Tapas - which we went back for 3 meals! Hotel also offers complimentary WiFi which works wonderful for our iPads and iPhones. Front office was also helpful to recommend places of interest to visit and maps. This hotel deserved a 5* rating because of the comfortable beds, clean deco, well furnished bathroom, sound proof walls and most importantly, anti slamming doors. Location is perfect to visit old town, Casa Mila, Casa Batllo, shopping stretch La Ramla. You'll love it!

<Title>“Great stay at the Jazz”
<Content>The massive number of positive reviews don't lie. We had a great 4 night stay in January. The room is clean (bare laminate wood floors), modern bathroom/room, large flat screen on the wall. If you are looking for shag carpeting, wallpaper, and oversized dark furniture, this is *not* your place. As others mentioned there is no tea/coffee in room, but you have about 6 cafes one block from the hotel. You are in the middle of a city - there is some traffic noise, ambulances etc. This was not a problem for us, and we had an outside-wall room (we live in a urban area). Hotel staff were helpful, but we did not ask for much. We did not hear our neighbors. I think any bad reviews come from people staying during the high season when it is more crowded or perhaps they are just impossible to please.

<Title>“Not Sure”
<Content>Yes, it is in a good location and yes I agree with all the comments written about this hotel, but to be honest I was a little dissappointed. This could be because everytime I tried to book this hotel it was full so I was very excited that it would be something different. I found it had no soul. The rooms were comfortable and the decor was good. However the corridors reminded me of a cruise liner. The bar area was completely empty all the time. I am sure this is because it was January. This Hotel is part of a chain, of which I have stayed at the B Hotel also in Barcelona and to be honest I felt the same about this hotel. Staff were very helpful

<Title>“Nice Hotel - Great Location”
<Content>Stayed here for 2 nights without breakfast so don't know about the breakfast. Stayed on the 3rd floor and from other reviews there is a little noise from the metro underground but not enough to lose sleep. Wi-fi is also free which is a bonus. The room we stayed in was a little on the small size but it was just for sleeping as the whole city of Barca awaited as it was my first time here. There's a outdoor rooftop pool - about 10/12 metres with some nice garden furniture to relax - I'd say it would be put to good use over the summer months. Location wise, this place is a 2 min walk from Las Ramblas the heart of the night life.

<Title>“Excellent value”
<Content>Excellent value. Our room was modern, very generously-sized, comfortable and clean. Las Ramblas is a 5 minute walk away, which actually works well if you like to retire to a quiet area at night. Although the hotel is abutted by major thoroughfares, the room was very well soundproofed; we didn't hear any road noise. We did, however, feel slight vibrations when the underground trains go by, but we very quickly got used to it. Hotel reception staff were helpful when called upon, but otherwise functionally polite which works just fine for us.

<Title>“Just returned; loved Hotel Jazz”
<Content>Hotel Jazz is a great little hotel near Barcelona University, La Rambla, and the Plaza of Catalonia. In other words: it's perfectly located. It is very convenient to the many fun things the city has to offer. We particularly enjoyed wandering the streets of the Gothic Quarter and then meandering back to the hotel late at night/early in the morning. The staff was friendly, the hotel clean, wife free, good Rioja wine at the bar priced nicely and the rooftop pool area was peaceful. The pool was open, but we never used the rooftop other than to hang for a few minutes -- the weather's nice in Barcelona in late December, but not nice enough to lay out by the pool! I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

It is well located two blocks from the Corte Ingles, Ramblas and very good restaurants. From the airport very easy just take the airbus and you stop at Universitat station walk 2min. They have parking, wi-fi, rooms very modern and comfortable. I dont have any complaint or negative comment about the hotel, the staff nor the location if I return to Barcelona i will stay again!!!!! From the room you can see the street but there no noise, imagine we were able to see the 3 Kings Parade from our room.

<Title>“a bit disappointed but ok”
<Content>Let me start off by the pro's, The hotel has a good location, away from all the hustle but close enough to las ramblas, & the metro. The rooms have a great size for european standards and was clean and modern. Con's: STAFF! they were not helpful at all. When we arrived, we asked to have matrimonial beds as my husband did not want a twin beds put together. they advised they would not be able to have this ready until 3pm, we had arrived at 10am. we had to carry our luggage into the hotel and into the storage and then out of storage and to our room, which by the way ended up having two twin beds together anyway. we never got a city map with out asking and we rarely greeted upon arrival. Felt like they were annoyed to have people there. They really need to work on their customer service skills b/c it's actually a nice hotel, but i'm all about service...

<Title>“Hotel Jazz, Barcelona”
<Content>What a fabulous hotel! Excellent location, airport bus stops so nearby so peace of mind if travelling alone. Room was so spacious, very comfortable and the housekeeping staff were very attentive (room was cleaned and restocked every day). The bar isn't very spacious but is well stocked and ideal for a quick drink before heading out / heading to bed. I didn't eat at the hotel as I tend to eat breakfast at nearby cafes of which there is an abundance to choose from. The roof top pool/area is lovely with amost 360 degree views across Barcelona. Lovely place to relax in between excursions. The hotel happily kept luggage safe between check out and flight time allowing lots of extra free time to roam the city without carrying luggage everywhere. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel and will most definitely be using it again for my next stay.

<Title>“Great location near Ramblas & Plaza Catalunya”
<Content>This hotel was in a great location and was priced very well. We were in a room on the 2nd floor, and unfortunately we were right above the metro line so the room periodically rumbled. Other than dealing with occasional train-related rumblings, I liked this hotel. Location was great, staff was very friendly, there was a rooftop pool which would be great in the summer (it was 50 degrees fahrenheit when we were there in december so no pool for us), and it was easy to get to the airport via bus or train. Overall I was very happy with the hotel due to the good price and location, but I should've asked for a normal pillow (not just a body pillow) and we were over dealing with the train noise by the end. Maybe a room on a higher floor wouldn't experience the noise, but I don't know. Good hotel though overall and good value.

<Title>“What more can I add!”
<Content>Not much to add to the previous reviews, this is a great little hotel in a superb location if you need to be close to P. Catalunya; great for transport links to airport if your a first timer to BCN then the hoho tourist buses are a must. Liked the idea of card operated lift cars and security on the front door. Didn't use breakfast facilities as we found some great little cafes locally and Scobies Irish bar (just around the corner) is real handy for a last drink before bedtime! This hotel does not pretend to be something it isn't i.e. it is a relatively small 3 star hotel, well cared for and caring towards its clients, if you're only in town for a couple of nights then the little box of toiletries in the bathroom is a real bonus as you have everything you'll need right there.

<Title>“Great location ok hotel”
<Content>Hotel jazz is a very modern hotel, it doesn't have much character. The staff were ok but not overly helpful, as I had contacted them a week before our arrival to see if we could check in a little earlier as we were travelling to Barcelona by train arriving at 8 am, they said there was little they could do and this would not be possible, we could leave our bags which was good but it meant no shower to refresh and no safe to put valuables in. Our room was inward facing and was very dark, we had to have the lights on all day, although the bed was comfortable. On the plus side, the hotel is in an excellent location just 5. Mins from place de la catalunya and the top of las ramblas. The terrace on the roof was a nice feature to relax on after a day of sight seeing, although the pool was very small. Overall it was a good base.

<Title>“So/so”
<Content>Great location. 7 minutes walk to La Ramblas and Placa de Catalunya, so great for bus/walking tours or shopping. Clean simple design. Above the subway...so you will feel the vibration a bit...we were on the third floor and still felt it every couple of minutes. We stayed for 4 nights. 2 afternoons after our tours...the cards won't work in the elevator, so we couldn't go into our room and had to get the cards renewed at the front desk, and the next afternoon, the elevator was repaired, and we were pointed to the stairs. Staff was indifferent and unapologetic. Thank god we were only on the third floor. We got a room across from an "office" which is where the housekeeping keep all their stuff, and we could hear them talking loudly from our room at all hours. And 2 nights, at 9pm, they knocked on our door and when we opened, only said:"Sorry, no check out." Why not check their list first to see if the rooms were occupied before randomly knocking on guest doors at night? Especially if we're only 2 female friends traveling. The night they didn't knock was when we put a "Do not disturb" sign on. On the last night, we came back to find the housekeeping staff have damaged the balcony door handle...meaning we couldn't open it for fresh air as the windows can't be opened. The staff admitted it was loose and the front office couldn't get it repaired that night and offered us another room, but since it was our last night and we had to pack for a 6am check out, we stayed in that room and couldn't sleep well because it became quite warm.

<Title>“Great Location, rooms, decor, price and service”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights during NYE. The hotel is located next to Universitat Station, Placa Catalunya is a 3 min walk and La Rambla is a 5-7min walk. The beach is possible to walk to approx 20-25 mins but much easier to catch the Metro. Lots of clothes shops and restaurants close by The hotel is modern contemporary. Its neat and tidy and lots nice. When you check in and go to your room, you will not be disapointed. Im not sure of its star rating but 4 star would be adequete. It doesnt have a gym or spa although it has a beautiful roof top swimming pool and bar. Note there are many other luxorious looking hotels dotted around but generally I found that inside the rooms they tend to be dated. Our room didn't really have any sign of wear thus the hotel is well maintained. Price is very competative for location and decor. The service is excellent. The reception staff are attentive and always greet you with a friendly smile and hola. The wifi here is completely free so bring your laptop/iphone. Used it through out my trip to post pics on facebook and keep in touch with friends. Restaurant is great, we had evening drinks here and breakfast. Breakfast has a fair amount of choice and all the food tasted great. Will be back again. Adios

<Title>“Excellent city break hotel”
<Content>The Jazz is situated in the Ramblas district very close to the main commercial centre and convenient for the underground. It is within walking distance of the Art Nouveau houses of Gaudi and of the mediaeval Gothic district. We stayed 4 nights for an off season city break: we didn't take the breakfast option as there are many artisan bakeries nearby (try Crusti where you can watch the bread being prepared and baked as you sip coffee and eat your fresh pastries) We also found good local dining at reasonable prices (€10-15 for 2 courses with wine and coffee) The hotel is newish and has an attractive roof terrace with (very small) pool. Our room was spacious but marred by poor maintenance: the basin was crazed and the table top stained, the toilet roll holder was broken when we arrived and despite requesting repair nothing was done; the wall of our room had been very crudely repaired after previous damage.....all little things on their own but un-necessary at this standard of hote.

The room was big ,new and warm. This hotel is indeed a surprise for this price. The location of the hotel is fantastic.It is 5 minutes from Ramblas . Arthur

<Content>The hotel is located in a perfect location for exploring Barcelona, about 2 minutes walk from Pl. catalunya'30 Meters outside the hotel there is a metro stop. The hotel is modern and very well maintains .the room we stayed in was a junior suite and was perfect. Breakfast is great with multiple choices. The only down side is that once in a while at lower floors one can fell the metro trumble.so ask for an higher floor.

<Title>“Excellent”
<Content>The Hotel Jazz is another great one of the Núñez Navarro Hotels. The location is fantastic, in the very center of Barcelona, within walking distance to the major touristic attractions in the city. To reach the other sites, you can use the subway, as there is a station right in the corner of the hotel street. It's also very convenient to get to the hotel from the airport, as the Aerobus makes a stop in the Plaza Universitat (very close to the hotel). The room is great, spacious, clean and comfortable. The bed is awesome, big and cozy. I did hear the subway running underground a couple of times, but it is not a big deal, I don't think that noise can wake someone up. The bathroom is amazing, big, clean and modern. The amenity kit is the most complete I've ever seen. Now I wish I had had breakfast at the hotel, because it must be very good, but I didn't try it, so I can't comment on that.

<Title>“Thats why its top 10”
<Content>Short 2 night stay for the two of us at the beginning of December. Using the regular airport bus the hotel is no more than a 2 minute walk from the University stop. Convenient for all tourist attractions, shopping, restaurants and bars, right in the heart of the city. What I like about this hotel is that it gets the basics right and does them well. Warm and helpful welcome, attractive & comfortable room, comfy beds, bathroom with both shower and bath, and importantly, spotlessly clean. The detail is in the range of toiletries, in-room safe, abundant storage, room service and bar. Slept well, our room was on the 4th floor overlooking the main street. Slight rumble from the metro, but no big deal, and never noticed noise from the street. There are also a couple of desktop computers with free internet access located in the bar area. Didnt have breakfast in the hotel, there is an abundance of places to eat any type of meal just out the door. The metro is a hundred metres away and being in the heart of the city, walking will get you to most sights. The Rambla is minutes away, and the Gothic area a little further. I recommend Hotel Jazz for its value for money, superb location, plentiful facilities, and being secure and comfortable.

<Title>“Awesome value”
<Content>Having read the reviews of this hotel, I picked this one over a 4 star holiday. All I can say is that I wasn't disappointed. It is located right by the University stop of the Aerobus from the airport which was 5 euros each. Can't beat it for location! The hotel is modern and clean. Although the lobby isn't big, the staff are efficient and friendly. However the main star of the show are the rooms. They are up to date, comfortable and cosy! A nice LCD TV and very comfortable beds. The bathrooms are also excellent and with the toiletries provided, its certainly better than some 4 star hotels I have been to. So if you need a good value for money hotel that is central and provides you with a nice roof over your head, this is the place.

<Content>Stayed here overnight awaiting cruise. Great location just off the square. Rooms are small compared to the states but extremely nice, colorful and upscale. Beds were a little harder than most. The only negative aspect was the breakfast price of $28.00 for the buffet, but other restaurants were abundant in the area.

<Title>“Outstanding hotel in a perfect location”
<Content>We have no idea how this outstanding hotel can only have a 3-star rating! It's far better than most 4-stars we've stayed in and given its perfect location, all adds up to a fantastic bargain which you really ought to grab. The hotel has smart modern "urban contemporary" styling throughout and ours was a very comfortable and spacious room (with efficient heating/aircon) and a first-class bathroom you'd expect to find in a much more expensive hotel.The location is perfect - only a couple of minutes walk from the airport bus stop so no need for taxis or complicated transfers - and only a minute more to La Rambla and the rest of central Barcelona so everything is in easy walking distance. There's a roof top pool with great views of the city skyline, the wifi is free and the whole place is obviously well run, efficient and spotless. If you really want to be picky, it's true (as other reviews have mentioned) there's no tea/coffee making stuff in the room and most of the TV channels are Spanish or Catalan - but neither of these mattered to us. Without a doubt we'd recommend the Hotel Jazz to anyone and definitely plan to stay there again soon.

Rooms modern and comfortable with every possible need catered to including fridge. Bathroom stocked with soaps and gels and hairdryer. Two minutes from Aerobus to Airport. two minutes to Cataluna Square. Two minutes to La Rambla and hopon -hopoff bus. In short a fabulous place to stay. will definitely go back and stay there in the new year.

<Title>“Location second to none, should be a 5*”
<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Jazz for 2 nights from the 2nd - 4th December.  We arrived via aerobus which was very simple (we had visited previously and got a taxi which was 4 times the price for 2 people based on a return trip.) The bus stop is approx. 1 minute walk from the university stop, however you can stay on until plaza catalunya which is only 5 minutes away.  We arrived at 10.30 a.m and did not request our room to be ready upon arrival however we were shocked when we were handed the keys straight away (certainly not something you would expect in Europe, speaking from experience.)  The room and en suite were spacious, especially by european standards. The bed was comfortable and clean, shower was powerful, decoration was tasteful and the veiws were lovely. We were on the 4th floor and did not hear nor see our neighbours.  The mini bar was stocked to the brim and good value for money as well as the room service.  A safety deposit box was included in the room price which we rely on and is sometimes not provided elsewhere. A vast supply of toilletries was provided for both of us (rare) and re-stocked daily - we have never experienced this even in 5* accomodation.   The metro and road can be heard from the room however this is to be expected and does not disturb sleep. The hotel staff were helpful when asked questions, however not outwardly friendly when passing the reception.   We visited the hotel bar and pool however did not use the services despite looking pleasant.  The terrace provides stunning veiws with sun loungers and tables - possibly not suitable for December but the sun is hot when it comes out.  Location is second to none (we had previously stayed on carrier d'aribau which was convenient however the Jazz was a huge improvement.) There are many bars and restuarants within walking disatance including the Hard Rock Cafe and a cosy Irish bar.  Las Ramblas is a 5 minute walk.  Overall for location, price, standards and space provided we would be more than happy to come back as Barcelona is our favourite city and this hotel really does it proud.

<Title>“Modern Jazz”
<Content>We liked it a lot. Four nights in late November. Location is convenient to Aerobus + Pl. Catalunya, Rambla, and the Gothic quarter. 25 mins nice walk to Pl. Espana conference center. 30 mins lovely walk to Segrada via Eixample. Facts: Curtains offered perfect blackout. No noise from adjoining rooms. Modern trendy and functional design. AC system was effective and very quiet. Lots of lights, and easy switches to control them. Floating hardwood floors. Reserved a "Jazz room" which had two beds side-by-side sheets tucked in separately (we had to untuck!). No coffee machine but many coffee shops within meters outside. No free H2O but supermarkets within 30 seconds outside. Complaints about noise in other reviews here we felt were overstated - we heard a low rumble periodically, that was perfectly tolerable. We were on 6th floor street side. Flat screen TV with CNN + BBC World. Staff were efficient, friendly and competent. Smart card room key to operate elevator adds to security. Place is cute and convenient. I'd go again. Roof top pool was open - would be terrific if we'd had 10 degrees C more.

<Title>“Location is perfect”
<Content>Just back from six nights in Barcelona. This hotel suited our needs perfectly. The Airport shuttle drops you off about a two minute stroll away and you can pick it up back to the Airport about a five minute stroll away. Staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel is excellently located. You are right at the top of La Ramblas and have access to everything via foot, metro and bus. Room was a good size, nicely decorated and the bathroom was good with a nice added extra of a box of bits and bobs like dental kits etc that you might need. The only slight down side is that we had a room on a lower floor looking out at a small back courtyard. So no view and a bit dark, but then were weren't in Barcelona for the view from our hotel room! Restaurant menu was also a bit limited, but you are surrounded by hundreds of restaurants and coffee shops, so no danger of going hungry. Roof top pool is small but is a nice extra. The weather was nice enough for us to be able to sit up on the roof area for a short while in the middle of the day and it would be really nice in even warmer weather. Traffic noise does travel up though, so not particularly peaceful. Do watch the prices in the restaurants and bars. We got fleeced the first day, but got wiser after that. You get charged more for sitting outside (even in November) than inside. Make sure you see the price of what you want before you order. We paid €4.20 for a coffee the first day and then discovered we could get it for €1.30! The main area for fleecing appears to the La Ramblas, so eat and drink in the many places either side. The Cathedral designed by Gaudi and still being built has to be the highlight of our visit - don't miss it. It's worth queuing for.

The reception staff are very helpful and gave advice about where to go and how to get there etc. The rooms are spacious, comfy, clean and modern. Great value for money. The restaurant/bar is modern, comfy and reasonably priced. Room service also available. The rooftop pool is great and shows great views of the area surrounding the hotel. All in all a great hotel which is very reasonably priced.

<Content>My husband and I stayed here on the last leg of our Honeymoon. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a corner suite. The room was perfect: modern but warm. We loved it. The staff at the Jazz Hotel (as well as the sister properties) was great. Extremely helpful and pleasant to deal with. The roof of the Jazz was fantastic. There is a small heated pool and a bartender who makes a killer mojito. Location: Perfect. About a 2 minute walk from las ramblas. I wouldn't want to stay any closer than that. Also very close to the tour bus stop if you're into that sort of thing. I think the price was paid was a steal. Modern and spacious hotels are hard to come by; don't miss this one!

<Title>“Very nice all around hotel”
<Content>The hotel is well rated for a reason. It has a friendly staff that offers good service. The rooms and hotel are very clean, with very nice daily cleaning service. The room has a large king bed, desk, nice bathroom, laminate flooring, very contemporary and comfortable. Big door opens to the street (a bit noisy as most hotels along busy roads), or courtyard (probably less noise but maybe less privacy from other windows). A bit of vibration from the adjoining metro, but practically negligible. Fantastic roof top with pool and lounge chairs. Immediately next to Metro University (convenient and an Aerobus stop from the airport, a bit under 6 euro a person and 2 minute walk to hotel). Perhaps a 5-6 minute walk to Rambla and 10 minutes to Gracias. (As long as you stay near Rambla or Gracias, you cannot go wrong with hotel location). The building itself is contemporary, so it is very nice; some other hotels are in older buildings with great architecture, so it is a matter of taste. But in short, it seems like Jazz offers the same accommodations as other hotels of this class, just a good 30+% less expensive, so it is really a great deal. If they improved their breakfast buffet, it would be that much better. However, 7 nights here, and turned out very well.

<Title>“Believe all the positive reviews!”
<Content>I picked this hotel based on its TripAdvisor reviews and it did not disappoint. It is important to remember that it is a 3 star so don't expect 5 star service because of the reviews here. Having said that it is the best 3 star I have ever had the pleasure of staying in and better than many 5 stars I've been to. The location is excellent, v close to the centre of everything but not so close that you can't escape back to the hotel in the evening for some rest and relaxation. The room was cleaned thoroughly every day and even though our room faced the elevator we did not hear any thing. We stayed on the 5th floor and thus were not disturbed by the metro. If and when I return to Barcelona I will be staying in this hotel. Also the little box filled with toothbrushes, shoe mitts, razors and basically all your toiletry needs was topped up every day. No complaints!

<Content>Excellent location. Close to metro and bus stops. The staff is outstanding!!! Very friendly and helpful. There are several restaurants and a couple of small groceries stores nearby. Nice room. Very clean. Well appointed. Very comfortable bed. Flat screen tvs, hair dryer, safe. Good windows. Heard very little street noise. Would definitely stay again the next time I am in Barcelona. Tip: Take the Aerobus from the airport. This is a very efficient service. It takes 20-30 minutes. The price is 5.30 Euro or you can get a roundtrip ticket if you are staying less than 9 days for a discounted price. The bus stops at Plaza Universitat-Pelai, which is very close to the hotel. This is much easier than lugging your suitcase on the metro.

<Content>As others have said, the location is perfect. Very close to everything but a couple of blocks away from the noise. The front desk staff is outstanding. They do not have a bellman, 4 of us arrived with enough luggage to sink a boat. They ran out with a cart and helped all the way. They all spoke English like a native Chicagoan. The down side, I am handicapped and reserved a handicap room. There were no barriers from the front door, to the lobby, to the elevator, to the room. The bathroom was the problem. The toilet had bars surrounding it , but the toilet was low, not transfer height. The shower was in a bathtub that was 19" high and did not have grab bars. I am not giving it 5 stars because of the accessibility problem.

<Title>“Great hotel, excellent location”
<Content>From the moment we arrived the hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. The hotel room was clean and modern. The best part of this hotel was the location which was just a short walk to Las Ramblas and close to two metro stops.

<Title>“Loved hotel Jazz”
<Content>We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed our stay very much. Location is great and you can walk to a lot of places. The rooms are really nice & clean. We requested a room on a higher floor and our request was accommodated, so barely noticed the train sounds. The TV does not have any channels exclusively in English. Also one day the housekeeping did not come to clean the room till very late in the afternoon. However these are minor issues as we had a great time. The staff was friendly and helpful.

<Title>“Great Hotel in a central Location”
<Content>The Hotel jazz was awesome, it was a few blocks from Plaza catalonia and also a few blocks from Las Ramblas and Passeo De Gracia. One block from a Subway train. The hotel was very modern and clean, the staff was great, they had a great rooftop bar area and also an internet cafe area. The rooms are modern and if you are lucky to get a high floor the views are nice. Great place overall.

<Title>“Clean and modern hotel in good location”
<Content>Just 5 minutes walking distance from Las Ramblas street which is an huge advantage. Because you dont want to stay on Las Ramblas if you want to get some sleep. Rooms are big and clean. Stuff has small problems with English which is pretty normal in Spain. In overall nice hotel in good location, would stay again.

<Title>“Good location but not too spacious”
<Content>We liked our hotel and would recommend it because of it's location. It wasn't the most spacious place though. Staff was pleasant but not the greatest English, but nice. The location was GREAT. Not in the hussle-bussle of Ramblas but centrally located. I'd stay there again.

<Title>“Value for money in good location”
<Content>During a five-night stay in Hotel Jazz my family and I were accomodated in a corner suite. The room was clean, spatious and had good storage capacity for 3 people. Because we were on the fifth floor the noise of the subway was hardly heard. Staff are friendly and helpful. The minibar was not filled on one occasion but when we pointed this out the problem was solved within 3 minutes. Breakfast is served till 11 AM and has a wide variety of bread, pastry, cheese, meat, fruit, cereal and warm dishes that vary every day. When something you like is not there (e.g.)type of eggs), a simple request is all it takes to get the required dish within some minutes. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but has room service with a variety of snacks. The location is great: basically every major site can be done on foot. The roof top has a swimming pool and a nice area where you can sit and relax. I would certainly book this hotel again when returning to Barcelona. The value for money is very good. Before selecting I looked at various hotels and found them rather epensive, so I went for Jazz. I haven't had any regrets!

<Title>“Loved Hotel Jazz”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Jazz before and after our cruise out of the Port of Barcelona in September 2009. After reading many reviews, we decided on this hotel for its great location and the price could not be beat!! We took a bus from the airport and found this hotel with no problem after getting off the bus. The hotel was very contemporary and we loved it. We went to the rooftop pool which was very nice. The rooms were clean and very large, the bathrooms were very spacious. The hotel is located within walking distance to Las Ramblas and we felt very safe even walking around the area at night.

<Title>“Nice n comfort Hotel”
<Content>Very good location, center of the city. easy to get to attraction by metro or buses. got our room upgraded for one night, helpful staff. room is clean n comfort, however, a little bit dirty on the ceiling of the toilet. a little bit noisy from the street, and whenever the metro comes underground. if you need a complete silent hotel, it is not going to be your choice. we have totally no problem to the little noise. anyways, we had a great, wonderful trip in Barcelona.

<Title>“Jazzing in Barcelona”
<Content>About a week before we left for our trip to Barcelona (and Mediterranean Cruise) we received an email from the manager reminding us of our upcoming visit (like we'd ever forget THAT, as excited as we were!) and wanting to know if there was anything they could do for us to help us with our trip! Wow! That was sure a good sign. Arrived in Barcelona at 8:30 a.m. took a cab to the hotel. Our room was ready. I looked longingly at the bed but we threw our luggage in the room and took off to explore. Reception is efficient. The decor is great: streamlined but elegant. The pool on the roof is small but nice. We had a drink up there later that evening and it was nice. Our room was terrific. The heat/air conditioning was totally silent and worked well once we figured it out. The ONLY thing that was not perfect was the humming of the subway, which sounded like a jet taking off way off in the distance. As others have said, by the time you go to sleep it isn't even noticeable. I am a notoriously light sleeper but that vibration noise didn't really bother me. I think the subways stop running at midnight or thereabouts anyway. We stayed at the Jazz again after our cruise. You can take a bus that stops a few feet from the hotel and it stops right at the entrance to Park Guell, very cheap. We walked everywhere else. The location is PERFECT for seeing all the major stuff in Barcelona. Very clean. Internet worked fine, if a little slow one time (but 'normal' the rest).

<Content>We went for the 1st time visit to Barcelona and were impressed with the Hotel. There staff were very helpful and assist us there it were required. Our room were spetacular and neat with full equipped vanity box. There swimming pool on the roof is a must visit when you stay there. The breakfast were good and there are enough to eat from everything you want. The Hotel is well situated close to a lot of seeing. We will stay again at the Hotel.

<Title>“Good hotel let down by noisy furniture !”
<Content>Attracted to this hotel by the positive comments of previous contributors to this site. Excellent location with easy walking distance to Pl. de Catalunya, Las Ramblas and other main attractions such as Gaudi's architectural masterpieces in Passeig de Gracia. A modern building with a strong contemporary style internally with a very attractive roof top pool and sun deck. My enjoyment was however marred by the sound of furniture being dragged around from 7.00 am ! It was only when I entered the breakfast area that I realised this noise was caused by guests chairs being dragged across the tiled floor. I would strongly recommend to anyone booking at this hotel to avoid rooms on the second floor ( where I was located) to avoid this problem, alternatively, Management should note this point and fit rubber/felt pads to chairs as a matter of urgency to prevent further criticism in the future. I too, was aware of the Metro rumbling below but this was not considered a problem by comparison to the chair issue. My room was clean and well organised with ample storage for clothes and suitcases as well as air conditioning which worked both quietly and efficiently. Bathroom was spacious and well stocked with toiletries, ceiling above shower however was stained and basically crumbling away as a result, I suggest of steam concentrated above the shower head only 30 cm above. All in all a good hotel but let down by a few gltches that could so easily have allowed me to award it a 5 * rating

<Title>“Good location, reasonable room”
<Content>Reasonably comfortable - generally sound-proofed. Close to Las Ramblas, but not so in it that there are tourists all over the place. Only complaint was that the bed was a "king" that was two twins pushed together, and made separately - not sure who actually wants a bed like this, since if you want to sleep next to each other, you probably want to share your sheets...also, the mattress wasn't very comfortable. Generally clean, service was nice but not remarkable. Like many place in Spain, prices were good - very fair for everything in the mini bar and a bottle of reasonable cava for about 15 euros that they give to you in an ice bucket that you can take to the roof-top pool, which has a pretty awesome view. It was definitely a good value for the price.

<Title>“Location location location!!”
<Content>Best location ever: in the heart of the city, walking distance to "all". Nice entrance and first impression, but a bit "cold" and dartk interior though modern and well done. Nice staff, always people in the door at night. Lovely terrace with pool and wiew, must be perfect in summer!! Nice bar area with good service and lovely drinks. Breakfast is good for being spanish with lots of choices and serving of coffe at table. We chose one breakfast at hotel and the next day at Starbucks just down the street. We had a room facing inside, quiet! Friends of us had a room facing street on fifth floor and it was quiet as well (although friday and sat.), may be due to the mont and less people. Finally; the room was quite large and well decorated. Big bathroom with plenty, thick towels and products. Nice! Spacious wardrobe and mini-bar with affirdable prices (at least by Scandinavian standards..:) What I missed was the warmth and personal touch in decoration. Some colors, some flowers or some green. But all in all a def. recommendation due to location - value - price:)

<Title>“So So”
<Content>This is our second time staying at this property.The first time was in the fall of 2008.First I have to agree with others ~A train runs under the hotel and yes you can feel and hear the rumble in your room.It did not bother us during our first visit 3 years ago.However it did bother us this time!!! They are not keeping up with the property real well.We had mold on our shower caulking and the bathroom door had swelled from water getting it wet over the years! Our room looked into a small courtyard that was surrounded by the hotel on all sides.Therefore when you opened the window there was no breeze or ventilation,just stagnant air!

<Title>“Great find in Barcelona”
<Content>My boyfriend booked this as a weekend break and I loved the hotel! It's in a great location, close to public transport and great for walking and exploring the city. Perfect to get The Ramblas! Service in the hotel is fabulous - we didn't eat here but chose to eat at some fabulous restaurants near by (must try Cuidad Condal - AMAZING food!!) Rooms were clean, tidy and very comfortable - only point was that there was no tea and coffee making facilities. Roof top pool and bar were small but very pleasant - the pool is only waist deep... Not too many umbrellas in the pool area for us fair skinned individuals!!!

<Title>“Excellent Hotel”
<Content>As has been said on numerous previous occasions, the Hotel Jazz is situated in the ideal location being less than a five minute walk to the top of Las Ramblas. The nearest Metro is less than a minute away and the Aerobus stops at Plaça Universitat, a three minute walk away, although as said in an earlier review, for the return journey to the airport you have to go to Plaça Catalunya, a seven minute walk. A lot has been mentioned previously of the staff, I found them to be friendly and helpful, their English being twenty times better than my Spanish!! Our room was on the sixth floor and faced the main road, however, when the balcony door was closed, there was little noise to be heard. The bed was huge and one of the most comfortable we have ever slept on and the bathroom was large, clean and modern. The room was large and kept immaculate by the cleaning staff. There has been mention of there being no English language television channels, this is not correct, there are. If you go to reception they will explain how to get them. The air-conditioning is easy to work and extremely effective. The only negative I can say about the hotel, is that it does not have a kettle and the 'makings' in rooms, which we tend to expect in England. That said, there is a Starbucks a few doors up from the Hotel, so only a minor issue. All in all, if you want a good quality hotel in the heart of Barcelona at sensible prices, then I would certainly recommend Hotel Jazz and we will certainly return there.

<Title>“Very pleased repeat Bcn visitor”
<Content>Hi i've visited Barcelona several times...it is my favourite city in the world. I stayed at the Jazz (1st stay at this hotel) for 8 nights in September. Front desk check in was quick...but i had to wait a few hours for my room which was a tad annoying after a long flight but not a huge deal. I asked for and received a room on a higher room...i also was given a corner room which was nice.The room was clean and fine. My only issue with the room was the bathroom lighting (for makeup!) and the lack of hair conditioner and body lotion. Fortunately, Sephora was close by. On those occasions where i need something or ordered room service it was quick. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was good...no complaints. The rooftop pool and deck area made the hotel for me...it was a wonderful place to relax late afternoon....LOVED IT Would stay here again if the price was right.

<Title>“Great hotel in super central location”
<Content>If you want a little bit of extra comfort stay at this hotel, it is in a central location just two blocks of catalunya square so great for all the local shops and tourist bus start point , although you can get on and offf any where u like as there are many stops on route. great location for all the sight seeing and if you have strong legs you can walk to most of the local attractions. Hotel staff friendly and helpfull, room is clean and modern and bathroom is a good size with plenty of warm water any time. Nice roof swimming pool and great views of the city during the day and night it is fab. Did not eat in the hotel but there are pleny of local places to eat that is far cheaper and i recommend to do. Short walk of about 30 mins to the beach for some wonderfull views of the area. could not fault the hotel although is is a little expensive for just room only but you pay for that privalege of bieng a central hotel. defo will go back again and stay there for along weekend next time to finish of what i could not do on this trip.

<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Jazz for one night in mid October, post-cruise. It was perfectly located and the staff was very helpful. Yes, we did move our own luggage and had to work out some kinks in using the A/C and television, but the staff was extremely helpful- arriving in our room within minutes to fix the TV. There was a mild rumbling from the subway, but we are from NYC, so it was just like being at home! The room was modern, super clean and comfortable..filled with amenities;toothpaste, brushes, etc. the breakfast buffett was well presented and offered a wide variety...throw in the free wi-fi and we knew we had a winner!

<Title>“Disappointing Visit”
<Content>This hotel is the first time trip advisor has disappointed us. If this hotel is number 9 there must be a lot of very bad hotels in Barcellona. Check in OK but not overly friendly or helpful. No one to help with our bags. Had to get the front desk help us get the elevator to work. Room and bathroom good. Could not get the air conditioning to work so had to get help. First International hotel I have ever stayed at that had no English channels. Enquired at the desk why the restaurant / bar had CNN but not the rooms and was informed it was a different TV cable provider. Directions regarding tourist sites restaurants etc were grudgingly given with one exception. Jose Diaz who was very helpful. Breakfasts were good. Hotel is situated on top of a subway line. We eventually got used to the noise and shaking. Once again HOW does this hotel rank as #9 out of over 500.

<Title>“GREAT HOTEL, GREAT LOCATION”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in early October and we absolutely loved it. The location was PERFECT, close to subway, close to La Rambla, cafes, restaurants nearby. We also had excellent service, and rooms were spotless. I saw review here saying there are no English TV channels, which I found puzzling. We had BBC (several channels, CNN and a a couple of others all in English. I am not a fan of hotel breakfasts, but this one is really done well. However, there are also cafes for breakfast steps from the hotel. (It is also handy for picking up tourist bus tour). No one is mentioning the pool on the roof. We were lucky enough that it was warm and we could enjoy it, made such a relaxing end to a hectic day, and views are great. There is also plenty of room, plus a lovely bar area ("manned" on the weekends, otherwise can bring up drinks from the bar on lower floors. Would most definitely recommend and can't wait to go again!! P.S. About the complaint of "no service" after 10 p.m., the hotel does indeed have a security guard, for all of our protection, but help IS available, we saw them at work. The service at the front desk was also excellent for help in other areas.

I was informed I had been given an upgrade (without asking) The room was absolutely fabulous (411) very functional with everything anyone could wish for (apart from tea & coffee facilities) The position of the hotel is absolutely incredible - a short walk to most places being near Universistat Metro station. The breakfasts were also of excellent quality with huge choice. I wanted to rebook for a couple more days but sadly the hotel was full - that says something!

<Title>“We would stay there again? Likely not.”
<Content>The hotel itself is nice, clean and comfortable with nice sized rooms. It’s in a good location – off the Las Ramblas but close enough to walk to it. We spent three nights there in September. Our biggest complaint was the lack of service. You would think that for 248 € per night that someone would actually attempt to help us with our luggage. We arrived late at night (approx 10 pm) due to flight delays. Four of us with luggage – 2 bags each plus carryon. The taxi driver dropped us off in front of the doors and no attempt was made by hotel staff to engage us or even offer up a trolley. As a matter of fact, security came over to complain that we were blocking the door. Once we finally located the trolley, my friend and I checked in while our husbands struggled with all of the baggage – making two trips to the rooms. After that gong show we went to the lounge to have a drink, the bartender was so busy talking to someone that he completely ignored us. After 10 minutes we left and found another place to unwind. All of this was puzzling to us as all the reviews that we had read previously were positive regarding the service Beds were comfy, bathrooms very nice, had a/c, safe, well lit and nice view. Although the subway rumbles underneath, it didn’t really bother us as we were on the 5th floor. My score – hotel 6 out of ten, service – 2 out of ten.

<Title>“Great Hotel and All that Jazz”
<Content>This hotel was very nice and the room pretty good size for European hotels. The price was good value for Barcelona as I checked around a lot. The bed was comfortable and I slept well as I asked for a quiet room and got one -- upper floor did not look over main street. Had in-room safe, nice bathroom and it was very attractive. The staff was very helpful and the hotel really cares from prior correspondence before arrival and followup. The location is great for a tourist and convenient to the metro and airport bus (note--you get off at placa Universitat upon arrival, but for departure, you cannot get on the Airport bus there, you must go to placa Catalunya, don't know why). It's only about a block to the hotel from the airport bus stop. There are lots of good restaurants just north on rambla de Catalunya and that area. My only negatives about this hotel are that there are no English channels on the TV. This seems odd for a hotel trying to be an international business hotel and most hotels in a city this size in Europe have some alternatives (nothing was on but Spanish, I would take English or French). If you never watch TV, that wouldn't matter, but I like to relax and watch news or something at end of day. Some other review said they had English channels but they didn't when I was there as I checked every channel several times. Also, the electricity completely went out in half my room the last night I stayed. I didn't do anything, I was just in bed watching TV and one circuit (which included the bathroom and half the bedroom lights) just went out for no reason. Luckily, there was enough daylight to manage in the morning and it wasn't all the lights, but this seems odd to me.

<Content>Stayed here for 2 nights prior to a cruise and it was a nice, suitable hotel. It was a bit rundown in some aspects but for what we needed it worked perfect. We had a standard room on the second floor. Also note that this is our first time in Spain or Europe for that matter so our judgement of this hotel is in comparison to US hotels, not those of Spain. Pros: English speaking front desk staff, large bed, large safe, hardwood floors, open window balcony, good working air conditioner, awesome roof top experience, near metro stops, great location, next to great cafes and a gelletaria with fabulous Coconut ice cream. Cons: 338 Euros is $456 USD for 2 nights, a bit on the pricey side and we thought we had gotten a deal, pool closes early, shower door doesn't close and you get water everywhere, parts of hotel were definitely showing some age. Recommend: La bouqueria to buy ham and manchego fruit and bread best enjoyed for poolside siesta. Overall good experience at this hotel and I would stay again if the price was right. Don't freak out when you see European outlets - ask the front desk to borrow a converter.

<Title>“Hotel Jazz Hotel”
<Content>The Jazz Hotel in BCN is a very good choice for the money. The rooms are new, modern and clean and the location is excellent. Even the rooftop pool was refreshing and relaxing after a day of sightseeing.

<Title>“Excellent Break”
<Content>This hotel was perfect for a short stay in Barcelona. Central location close to the metro station, main strip and lovely restaurants and cafes, but far enough from the nightlife to get a good nights sleep. Pool on the roof was lovely. Fresh towels on the loungers every day, excellent bar staff to serve you drinks pool-side. Bathroom was exceptionally clean and modern. Bed very comfortable and plenty of storage. Can't actually think of negatives....! Made our stay in Barcelona comfortable and relaxing. Would stay again.

<Title>“Excellent”
<Content>My first time as adult in Barcelona, not sure where to stay and this hotel was recommended to me by my partners nephew. The Hotel Jazz is very modern and with an excellent location only about 30mins from the airport and 10min walk from the airport bus stop. The location is excellent, 5min walk from Las Ramblas and all it has to offer. Staff were very friendly. The rooms were of an excellent standard, plenty of space and storage,very clean and modern. We only had breakfast in the hotel once which was of a reasonably choice (great freshly squeezed orange juice). The pool is not the biggest but if you are only looking for a dip to cool off then it is fine, the decking area with sunbeds offers great views over Barcelona. Another perk was free internet access! I would most definately stay at this hotel again on my next visit to Barcelona

<Title>“Perfect Location”
<Content>We arrived at the Hotel Jazz after a cruise with a problem: another couple with the same last name took a car that we had hired and pre-paid to take us from the port to the hotel. So we were out the money we'd paid for the transportation, and we had to hire and pay another driver. The staff at the front desk were marvelous. They called the company we'd paid and pushed them until they credited us with the 59 euros we'd given them. I doubt very much that we would have gotten our money back (we found out later that we'd way overpaid) if it weren't for the efforts of the front desk staff at the Hotel Jazz. Thank you again! The Hotel Jazz is perfectly located, just a short walk to two metros, and to Las Ramblas. The room we had was spacious, modern and clean. Also, we were allowed to check in before 10:00 in the morning, which was a great plus. I would stay at the Hotel Jazz again without hesitation. The only improvement I think they could make would be to get better towels.

<Title>“Just perfect.....”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Jazz for 5 nights in August. It was a perfect base for exploring Barcelona. The hotel is only about 5 minutes walk to Las Ramblas and Plaza de Catalunya where you can catch the tourist bus of the city sights. You are close to the main attractions without being in the centre of things which makes this hotel quieter, and in my opinion safer. This is a great little hotel that is perfectly formed in every way. It’s very modern and is spotlessly clean, practically brand new. The roof terrace has a small and again perfectly formed swimming pool which was nice after a day’s sightseeing in the heat, and there are plenty of sun loungers. At night it is nice to sit out on the roof terrace have a glass of sparkly and take in the lights of the city - very relaxing. Our room was very spacious, had an enormous ensuite bathroom and again both were absolutely spotless. Breakfast was good but did get a little samey after 5 mornings. The receptionist kindly recommended a fantastic tapas restaurant for dinner which is just around the corner and we went back there three nights in a row. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. It’s just perfect for a break in the fabulous city of Barcelona. I will definitely be back again.

<Content>I love the hotel! Rooms are big, modern and very comfortable - feels new too. The hotel is located 5 mins away from La Ramblas, along the main road and this makes locating the hotel very easy. It is also a 5mins walk from the airport bus pickup/dropoff points. The breakfast offering was good and even if you choose to have breakfast outside, there are many choices in the area. Starbucks is also only a minute's walk away.

<Title>“Jazz Hotel was perfect”
<Content>My wife and I stayed three nights at the Jazz in Barcelona prior to a cruise. What a perfect little hotel! It's central to everything - just a block from the main square and the beginning of Las Ramblas. You get pretty hot seeing the sights in Barcelona and it is a treat to return to this hotel in the afternoon. There is a relatively large swimming pool on the roof with a bar and views of the city. Clean, contemporary rooms with all amenities. Great buffet breakfast to start your day. Staff speaks excellent English. Guests predominantly English speaking Americans and British. Good value. Highly recommend.

Nice rooftop swimming pool, good bar and comfortable rooms. Modern decor. No breakfast but you can pop to cafe otto just opposite for a good bite with freshly squeezed juice. Not cheap but excellent value for money considering standard and location.

<Title>“Great Hotel, Lovely Design, Excellent value and staff”
<Content>I had heard about the hotel jazz from some postings I read on cruise critic. Its prices seemed good, looked like a clean nice place so I booked it. They were accommodating enough to have my room available at 9AM. I had booked what they called a corner junior suite. Absolutely beautiful. Design of the hotel reminded me of a W hotel. Sleek lines, bright clean colors (red,black,white), with every little extra you could want. I liked that it had separate shower and tub. 5 small juliette balconies, and separate areas for both sleeping and work. The room had some street noise but nothing appreciable. Free wireless worked fine except on the roof. They had very nice rooftop pool, with plenty of lounge chairs for enjoying the sun, and a separate bar area open during the late afternoon to early evening hours. Food in the hotel was nothing spectacular, but was above average. The breakfast buffet changed every morning with 15 or 20 staples there (fruit, cereal, eggs, etc). The hotel had an ideal central location, just a few minutes to Las Ramblas, Placa de Catalunya, and the Passage de Gracia. The staff were extremely helpful in suggesting restaurants , and helping with power adapters and trying to meet every need with a smile. It's one of about 7 hotels owned by the same group, and since a friend was staying down the road at one of their sister hotels, he found that one just as nice. So was glad to see their quality wasn't just a fluke. Would highly recommend this hotel and plan om staying there again.

Breakfast was well priced with a decent selection, bar prices were good for a hotel The rooftop pool was a great feature I found the noise to make it a little hard to sleep, and could feel subway vibrations. Perhaps I'm more sensitive to it than others, or maybe it's common in barcelona?

<Title>“Clean and tidy in Barcalona”
<Content>We enjoyed our stay here.. I give it three stars because it wasn't one of my favourite places we stayed during our trip. No real fault of the hotel.. it just didn't have that magic feeling you get from some European hotels. Its made of plaster.. the theme is Jazz and it feels like more of a business hotel. There is a pool on the deck but its more of a paddling pool and can't fit more than a couple of people in it at a time. Not a pool for doing a few laps.. more to cool off. Great view from up there though and it was well used by guests. The rooms are new and fresh with comfortable bed. Location pretty good. Just a few minutes walk to Las Ramblas (check out the fresh food market) and main shopping areas. We didn't eat at hotel so can't comment on that. I'd say if you can get a good price here its a good central base to go exploring.

<Title>“Modern, clean & convenient!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Jazz Hotel for 3 days after a European cruise. We selected the hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and were very pleased with our accomodations!! We couldn't have been happier with the location, since it was in the heart of town and close to all the tourist bus transportation. We found it very convenient to have a hotel close to the tourist attractions since it was sometimes challenging to find a public bathroom! The hotel rooms and bathroom were larger than expected and VERY clean! The website pictures are very accurate as well...what you see is what you get!We felt very safe at the hotel and were able to enjoy time on the roofdeck pool. The Jazz Hotel was a great value and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona!

This boutique hotel is new and modern with sparkling clean rooms and very accommodating staff. We had to change our reservations last minute and they were very gracious. Ask for a quiet room if you don't like to hear the street noise as it's on a busy street. Would stay here again!

<Title>“Hotel Jazz is in an excellent location!”
<Content>We stayed here for 2 nights before a cruise. As others have mentioned, it's a very short walk from the Universitad Aerobus stop. As you exit the bus onto the large square, take the road directly in front of you. Once you cross the square, it's just a short distance on the first side street you cross. About a 2 minute walk from the bus stop, very close to the Metro stop. The hotel was very clean and the beds were comfortable. The front desk staff spoke English well and were very helpful. The rooftop pool was beautiful but I wish the hotel would keep it open later. We were told it was open until 9, but an employee tried to kick us out at 8:30 (we arrived at 8:25). Some others argued with him and he finally relented, but we felt pressured to leave by about 8:50. Only disappointment, mostly because it was so enjoyable on the rooftop. We wanted to stay longer! Las Ramblas was a couple of blocks away and the hop on/hop off bus had a stop about a block from the hotel. Perfect base for a couple of days of sightseeing! We paid 118€ per night and the hotel was a great value at this price.

<Content>At the risk of repeating the comments from previous reviewers, I would like to add my endorsement of Hotel Jazz as an ideal place to stay in Barcelona. Just a short walk from Placa Catalunya and the Ramblas, the location could not be better. The hotel is modern and the rooms are very clean and well presented. It is really quite a classy place to stay, and the rooftop pool, bar and terrace are a real bonus after a hot and busy day sightseeing. Breakfast is fine but nothing special, and there are lots of cafes and restaurants nearby. The staff are polite and helpful - really couldn't fault it.

<Content>I almost don't want to tell everyone about this place because it will become too hard to get a room here, but it's already one of the top reviewed hotels in BCN, so the secret is out. I used to stay at the Hotel Marvi across the street, and was so happy to try this upgrade. Breakfast buffet was plentiful and on special for 10 euros/day (which for an American is still expensive, but better than other hotel breakfast prices!); rooftop pool, lovely; room, comfortable and modern; location, perfect (near metro and bus, Plaza Catalunia and Ramblas and gay area.) I won't stay anywhere else when I come back to Barcelona.

<Content>The Hotel Jazz was an excellent choice for our Bank Holiday weekend in Barcelona. It's very central and literally 5 minutes walk from the airport bus stop but much quieter than a hotel right on The Ramblas. The rooms are modern and look recently refurbished and breakfast is lovely with a superb range of hot and cold food. The reception and restaurant staff were very friendly and efficient. However the best thing about the hotel was the gorgeous rooftop pool and bar which proved a little oasis in the heart of the city. I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again if I return to Barcelona.

<Title>“Huge room in a great location in Barcelona”
<Content>We just spent 2 nights in a "triple" room at the Hotel Jazz after our Med cruise and loved it!! Found it to be fairly quiet and a convenient walk to Las Ramblas & the metro. It was a little pricey but the room was HUGE!!! Largest room we've ever had anywhere. Son (14) who usually complains about being put on a sleep sofa was content to be in his own space (although he couldn't see the TV which was on the master bed side of the wall). The "master" beds were hard as rocks tho so we didn't sleep as well as we would've liked. (We have a "Select Comfort" bed at home so often have a hard time sleeping on regular mattresses.) The one thing that caught us off guard that I hadn't read about was the rumbling from the metro which runs under the property. Every 4 or 5 minutes we could hear the trains go by - they weren't loud, but they were noticable & unexpected (we were on the 5th floor). We found it to be clean, modern & well furnished. Our interaction with the staff was all pleasant. They offer a computer off the reception area where you can check-in online for your flights & print your boarding passes which was nice. We did not eat at the hotel so can't really comment on their restaurant. I gave it 2 stars only because I walked thru 1 morning to look over their breakfast offerings & thought it was very overpriced for what was being offered so we went down the block & found a cafe around the corner with a decent breakfast menu for a lot less. We visited the pool both afternoons after touring around the city & Montserrat and found it refreshing, although a tad crowded (not enough loungers). It seemed most of the other guests had the same plan as us to chill by the pool for a bit every day. There did not seem to be many children staying at this property so our son (14) felt a little awkward I think, especially with a couple of topless sunbathers taking center stage by the pool (hard to get used to that European sunbathing I guess). We had spent 1 night in Barcelona pre-cruise at another property and decided by our 3rd day in Barcelona that we just weren't in love with the food that we'd had in general. We had hit & miss experiences with different tapas & paella and our son had 1 very nasty hamburger somewhere (not even sure it was beef) so on our last evening we decided to go to the Hard Rock Cafe down at Placa Catalunya and that ended up being our best meal in Barcelona!! We went around 8:00 and only had to wait about 10 or 15 minutes to be seated. We were very pleased with that decision and would recommend that as a dining option as it's a very short walk from the hotel. So yes, we would recommend the Hotel Jazz to others and yes, we would stay there again. It really was a nice property in a good location.

<Content>The Jazz Hotel was very well located for the aerobus and for walking in the old city and the new parts of Barcelona. For a 3 star hotel I was very impressed. The web site pics matched what you got. Very clean and a few additions I wasn't expecting such as a hairdryer and beach towels. The terrace area was good, but you had to get their early to get a lounger and the pool was more of a plunge pool.

<Title>“greit hotel in the center of Barcelona”
<Content>Great Hotel in the center of Barcelona. It was our first time at this hotel. We asked for a room on an upper floor. We had room nr. 709 above the main entrance. The room was very modern, clean and with a great shower. Air condition worked properly and we used it all the time. There was only one English TV channel working at the time of our stay (not important for us). The roof with a bar and a swimming pool was great. There were always clean towels. The only disadvantage is that they close it at 21.00 every day – too early. From 20.30 a barman was telling everyone that they were closing soon. It would be great to be able to sit there until the late at night and enjoy a Barcelona view from the roof and have a drink. Prices in the bar are quite reasonable. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, but there are plenty of places to eat around the hotel. It is very easy to reach the hotel with airport bus. You can get off at the University place and the hotel will be 3 min. walk. To go back to the airport it is better to go and take the bus from Placa Catalynya in order to get a sitting place in a bus. It is 5-7 min walk from the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to live in the center of Barcelona.

<Title>“Fantastic hotel, perfect location!”
<Content>Stayed here in July 2011 as part of our honeymoon, and we absolutely loved it! Very clean hotel, with large rooms, and lots of amenities. The staff are great, and the rooftop pool is a bonus given the fantastic weather we had. The restaurant was alright, with a decent breakfast, but pretty expensive for what it was. The location is perfect - very close to Placa Catalunya, so not only are you a two minute was from Las Ramblas, but you are also very close to all of the metro lines. Also, the Aerobus from El Prat drops you off about a two minute walk from the hotel. Brilliant! We would absolutely, without hesitation, book here again.

<Title>“excellent but beware dining suggestions”
<Content>The hotel and staff were excellent and in keeping with all of the previous recommendations. The only downside was the recommendation by a staff member to eat at the 'Cellar de Tapas' - the food there was disgusting and an insult to the other fine tapas eateries we found around Las Ramblas

<Title>“Great location at a good value”
<Content>I really enjoyed my conference-related trip to Barcelona earlier this year, and the Hotel Jazz was part of that experience. The room was comfortable and plenty large enough for one person, and very clean/light. The staff was friendly on check-in and throughout the stay. And when I decided to extend my stay by one night, they found room for me (even though they were fully booked) and even moved things around to allow me to keep the same room. I did not try out their breakfast, since there were so many nice options in easy walking distance. For the adventurous, a short walk down Las Ramblas to the market is a "can't miss' breakfast opportunity as well. The only slight "ding" against them was the rooftop bar. Staffing and service were intermittent, and I waited in vain for over an hour for service on my first trip. At least the free wireless internet was working!

<Title>“Excellent modern clean hotel, very central and great experience”
<Content>Nice clean simple rooms, good price. We did not do the breakfast option as we thought it was a little steep. But did do some lunches and drinks throughout the week at the rooftop restraint and bar. It was very fairly priced for these options. This hotel was roomy, spacious, quiet and very, very clean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona and would stay here in a heartbeat again. Roof top pool could use dome sun umbrellas, but it was a nice refreshing option to have during the afternoon. Free internet which is a must in any hotel

<Title>“Excellent Location and Great Value”
<Content>The Hotel Jazz was clean, safe, and reasonably quiet. Prior to choosing this hotel, we had read lots of Tripadvisor reviews and had done a lot of comparison shopping before booking through the hotel's website. All the pre-booking arrangements were handled smoothly. We felt we received an excellent rate for the quality of the hotel and its proximity to the major tourist sites. The staff at the front desk spoke English reasonably well and was able to answer our questions about hotel facilities and sightseeing in Barcelona. When we arrived after a sleepless international flight, they checked and since our room was ready, they allowed us to check in early. Our room was located on a high floor and was as quiet as one could reasonably expect of a hotel located in the heart of Barcelona. There was a safe in the closet that was operated with a keypad. Near the hotel were the kinds of shops that made life nice in a strange city. Every morning, my husband would leave the hotel and return 10 minutes later with rich, strong coffee and wonderfully fresh pastries. There was a very reasonably-priced sandwich shop and several ATMs nearby. Within an easy 5-minute walk was the Placa Catalunya where one could catch the Bus Turistic (Barcelona's Ho-Ho bus) or shop at the Corte Ingles.

<Title>“As good as expected”
<Content>We booked this hotel as it was recommended by a friend who stayed there before. Location is great, right next to metro station and very close to Aerobus drop off spot. The hotel is very clean, staff are super friendly, polite and helpful. The room was spacious. We paid EUR10 each for breakfast which is great value. The pool on the roof top can be a little too crowded during peak season but still decent. The only drawback of this hotel is it shakes when the underground trains pass the station and you can hear it from your room. However, since the trains run only during the day until 10 or 11 pm, so it didn't bother us much. The shakes were only minimal.

<Title>“Great position and excellent room”
<Content>Booked two rooms for ourselves and children (21 and 18) for two nights after a weeks cruise. Upon arrival early in the morning the receptionist kindly informed us that she could get our rooms ready for 12.30pm. This was fantastic and allowed us to make the most of our day. Both rooms were clean, nothing flashy, great air conditioning, enormous beds and beautiful bathrooms. Position next to the Unistat metro station is fantastic, and only two minute walk to the Ramblas. The internet access allowed us to book our seats for the flight home. Roof top pool was great, and the highlight of the day was the beer on the terrace after a hot day sightseeing. Only quibble was that we tried to get a coffee and beer at 10.30pm but bar was closed. Also no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. But hey, so what! A great place to stay, and a smoke free haven.

<Title>“Good value for money”
<Content>Recently stayed here for a week, I read up on most reviews so i knew what to expect beforehand... We had two rooms a standard room and a triple corner room which they honored my request to have them as close as possible. Only had one niggle that i wasnt aware about beforehand - The triple room was all open plan, no doors - so there was no privacy between the main sleeping area and those in the sofa bed/lounge area. The hotel was busy with numerous hen parties coming/going during our stay and although the pool area was full in the late afternoons most of the time there was room for all. The hens didnt disturb us at night, just felt a little sorry for them after the 6am false fire alarm :-/ Warning for light sleepers, the metro will sporadically wake you ,although it passes underneath fairly frequently, it seems every now and again a really loud train passes underneath and shakes the bed. I dont think floor level will make any difference as i felt it when i was sunbathing on the roof a few times too. Despite this, i did manage to get enough sleep with my earplugs in! Amazingly the corner room we had was on a busy road leading to Plaza Catalunya yet I barely heard any traffic/street noise on such a busy location. Pro's Free WIFI Good value for money Modern rooms - Corner room, very spacious Plenty of toiletries Pool area & bar a godsend in the heat Fab location Fridge mini bar - essential for your own water etc Bar staff friendly & pleasant, helped with my map reading Cons Tried breakfast once, wouldnt bother Metro did keep me awake on occasions as i am a light sleeper, but it wouldnt deter me from returning

The breakfast was very nice also. The location is very convenient to many attractions. My only complaint would be the need for more shady areas by the rooftop pool.

<Title>“Wonderful return trip”
<Content>This is our second visit to the hotel jazz, and once again thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We were there for a family celebration, and booked 5 rooms. Although we arrived early, one room was made available to us, which was a nice surprise. We arranged a bottle of cava to be left in one of the rooms one afternoon, and it was there when we came in from doing our touristy things. If you catch the aerobus in from the airport, it's cheaper to buy a return ticket, although this is not promoted. Also it's better to get off at Universitat, as it's only a short walk to the hotel. There is a small cafe about 2 doors away that advertise a cooked breakfast for 7euro, this should be avoided!!! The food was terrible, We were on the second floor, and although we could hear the faint rumble of the underground it did not bother us at all. We love this hotel, the atmosphere, the staff, the location and the rooms are all brilliant. We hope to be back soon

<Title>“Excellent location - Right next to Viena!”
<Content>Jazz Hotel Having been to Barcelona a number of times, I chose this hotel because it was located next to a fantastic little eatery called ‘Viena’ right in the heart of town. Having stayed at Jazz’s sister hotel, ‘B-Hotel’ last year, I was expecting the same warmth from the staff I received there, but this was not exactly the case. There was a sense of urgency and efficiency, but the reception and security were quite cold and miserable. The room itself was quite small, even for European standards, but everything else was top notch. The room and bathroom was immaculately clean and the beds were very comfortable. The selection of toiletries supplied was very generous, as was the number of towels. The design of the shower/ tub glass divider was utterly hopeless, as it was too small to stop the shower spraying all over the floor. Another annoying point was the lack of English channels. During the first night, the fire alarm went off at 6am and all the guests congregated by the entrance, and the majority of the people were American, British or from other English speaking countries, yet of the 80+ channels there was not a single English speaking channel, except for the Disney Channel at certain hours. Even BBC World News was not available! The rooftop pool and bar was pretty amazing however, and the warm water was great for a swim after a long day. Ultimately the greatest selling point of this hotel is it’s location. It’s situated 2 minutes from La Ramblas and the airport Aerobuses even stops round the corner. Despite the minor niggles, I would probably still choose to stay at this hotel next time.

What a great location - right in the middle of the city, so convenient for Las Ramblas and other sights. Very modern and comfortable. Very nice rooftop pool - perfect for the hot weather months. The people at the front desk all spoke perfect English, and were very helpful in answering any questions. The rate we paid was very reasonable as well.

We booked a triple room - the sofa turned into a comfortable double bed. This hotel was close to Las Ramblas and La Catalunya. The only downside was the occasional rumble of the trains below. This hotel had a pool on top and free Internet access. Didn't eat in the hotel as it was close to many restaurants

<Content>After staying in a tiny Paris hotel room, my wife and I found our hotel room here increadibly spacious and comfortable. Large room, great king size bed, hardwood floors, great jazz on the sound system (with speakers in the bathroom) and the bathroom was very large (compared to Paris room) with tiled floor and nice modern shower. The best part was the rooftop deck with a pool and the location -- a block from Plaza Catalunya (where airport bus stops), the Ramblas and next door to subway station (I could hear a bit of vibration at night when trains departed the station). Highly recommended for the price.

<Content>We are a family of 5 and we had a family room with a double bed, pull out double bed for the kids and a cot for the baby all in the same room. The room was a good size and very clean etc the hotel is in a perfect location for getting round Barcelona and doing some sightseeing. All in, a good stay. Staff were very helpful, especially as we'd selected the hotel for location and because it had parking. I hadn't mentioned we had a roof box and when we turned up the parking is a small underground lot so we had to remove the roof box to get in it. A bit of a nightmare, but luckily not a lot in it and the staff helped with doing all that and held on to the roof box for us in storage during our stay.

<Title>“Awesome!”
<Content>We stayed for 5 nights at Hotel Jazz and loved every minute. The staff were extremely helpful and more than willing to answer any questions we had and requests. They suggested we eat at a restaurant the first night we arrived very late, made the booking and it was amazing. The hotel is located a couple of minute walk from the Ramblas but enough out of the hustle & bustle of this part of Barcelona. We found it to be a perfect location. If you are wanting to head to the beach it is quite a walk - but do-able. We stayed in a Junior Suite which was spacious, very comfortable and had everything we needed. Very cool jazz music included! The pool on the roof is really good, we spent lots of time lying on the sunbeds relaxing and going for dips plus ordering drinks from the rooftop bar! WIFI was free too. We would definately stay here again on our next trip to Barcelona.

<Title>“hotel is showing its age”
<Content>This hotel has a very good location. Not far from the main tourist areas and next to metro stations. Very good resturants surround this property. Also the bus from the airport drops off a few hundred yards away. It is a 3 star contemporary designed hotel. As far as service is concerned it is spotty. The staff is young. Some are eager to help and others could care less. Don't expect much of a welcome upon arrival or a thank you when departing. If you need help with your luggage they don't provide it. Some might like the design but it was for me quite sterile and cold. Some nights the halls were barely lit. They use tiny recessed bulbs. They offer free internet service. Two pc's are available for guests. But most of the time I was there (3 nights) the one pc was inoperable. I noticed water stains in the ceiling of the bathroom of my room when I checked in. Later that night I heard dripping. Since it was over the tub I waited until the next day and told the front desk. No one came to look at the leak or fix it. The next day the leak became a steady stream of water. At 11 pm I went to the front desk again, this time the front desk clerk came to my room to see. She offered to move me which I accepted. Had to pack everything up, she couldn't help me because she was the only one on duty. What should one make of this? I believe that this hotel at one time was a good place to stay, but something happened - the economy maybe but a hotel that knows it has a plumbing problem and doesn't address it has staffing or financial issues. If you look closely you can also notice other issues. Such as the curtains have got to be the orginals. This hotel simply is not being maintained properly. I had an early departure flight, it was still dark at around 6 am and just out front of the hotel where taxis pull up were several clearly intoxicated persons lying on the ground. The hotel security man was out there watching them, I don't understand why he didn't call the police to have them removed. Over the years I have stayed in a number of good value hotels due to TA reviews but a few times I have been disppointed as well. Sometimes a general consensus begins to form about a certain hotel and the conventional wisdom is not accurate. This hotel is ok if you get a good rate, compare the rate to other 3 stars. And if the room is not a critical part of your vacation. In other words the hotel doesn't matter that much. But if you think you're getting a value I would say you might be disappointed. I would have given Jazz 3 stars but with the leak a 2 was a generous rating. I still had a wonderful time in Barcelona. A very interesting and beautiful city.

We stayed in a triple room ( 706 ) , two adults and two teenage girls there was plenty of space in a fantastic room king size double bed and a pullout sofa bed. The style of the rooms and hotel is modern and as the name sugests jazzy. The staff were great ,helpful and friendly, they were attentive and did everyting they could to ensure our stay was memorable. The location was great also ,a stones thow from the placa catalunya and La Ramblas but quiet enough for abit of relaxation on the roof top terrace where there was a pool and bar. I cant recommend strongly enough Hotel Jazz, ,we will definately return on our next trip to Barcelona

<Title>“Great central hotel”
<Content>Stayed at the Hotel Jazz for 8 nights in early July. I selected this hotel based upon the positive reviews I read on TripAdvisor. Here's my thoughts: Pros: - very clean, modern hotel - fair size room for a European hotel (I've stayed in much smaller) - good value for money - very good sound-proofing in the rooms (we didn't hear a thing) - good location (close to two subway stations, and far enough away from the crowds on The Ramblas) - good A/C - nice pool area Cons: - pillow way too soft for my liking (I used one of the decorative pillows, which was much firmer) - there are two public computers by the bar - the first few days we were there, the Internet was very, very slow We did not eat breakfast at the hotel, as there are cheaper places to eat nearby. There are 2 Starbucks about two minutes away, as well as other restaurants and grocery stores. Others have mentioned hearing the rumbling of the subway. The only place I ever felt the rumbling was on the ground floor. Our room was on the 6th floor (there are 7 floors), and I didn't really notice the subway. I am so glad we did not stay on The Ramblas (way too crowded) or in the Glories area (very isolated). We would definitely stay at the Hotel Jazz again.

<Title>“Great pick for American Travelers”
<Content>Hotel Jazz is in a great central location to head out to all parts of Barcelona. The hotel had easy access to internet; hotel staff easily dealt with us english speaking guests. The rooms were clean and comfortable, feeling secure as well. The pool on the roof was a nice plus. If we ever returned to Barcelona, we would stay at this reasonably priced hotel again.

<Title>“Perfect Hotel and Location”
<Content>This review is not the shortest, but will be the only review you will need rather than sifting through each catergory I have tried to compile and independent summary based on our stay.... so please read on! Firstly, Location (& transfers) The hotel is situated perfectly as is just set away from Las Ramblas yet is within a 5 minute stroll which on route you will find many places to snack or shop. Jazz is within 15 mins of the airport and so i imagine a taxi would be cheap, however, you would be foolish not to take the airport (AEROBUS). this costs EUR5.30 pp and you need to get off at th 3rd stop (Universitat). For clarity, you should exit the airport through the main doors and walk to the left where you will see the bus. the return trip is just as easy but you catch the bus in the square at the top of las ramblas. Just a note, get off the bus walk straight (road towards la ramblas) and keep looking left, you will see the hotel on a little side street.... 2 mins from the bus stop Amenities. The pool is small, but you are in a City! the rooftop pool isa great extra where you can chill, lunch, drink or soak. it tends to be quiet so i wouldnt recommend a large group of kids, although it definately caters for them. Most visitors are on business i'd guess. The hotel has a large breakfast area, small jazz room (bar with internet) and a rooftop bar. all prices are reasonable. the brekkie seems pricey but apparently nice, cant comment though as we ate out alot. Rooms are great size and pretty upmarket, you get the feel you're in one of the better hotels in the vacinity! outside is very loud, but honestly with the balcony door shut, you cant hear a thing, we stayed on floor 4 it was perfect! Links Hoetls jazz is close to plenty of bars and restaraunts and is round the corner from a tour bus stop. This costs EUR23 for one day, so we got a 2 day one for EUR30 and used one day to tour and visit nou camp and gaudi sites, and the other day to take a diff route and get to the beach. very little at all to fault, strong 9/10

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel, great location!”
<Content>My girlfriend & I stayed in the Hotel Jazz at the start of this month for two nights. It was our first time in Barcelona so we wanted to make sure we chose the right hotel by checking out all the reviews posted here. Without a doubt, we definitely made the right decision. The hotel is in a great location with a 5 min walk to La Rambla & Placa de Catalunya. The room was spotless and the staff were great. The swimming pool on the top floor was beautiful & was a great place to catch some rays before heading out to do some sightseeing! We defo recommend the Hotel Jazz

<Title>“Great for a short stay”
<Content>Stayed here after reading the reviews, and I have to confess...our dog's name is Jazz, so we thought it was a cute fit for us! We stayed for 2 nights pre cruise and one night post cruise. We got a corner room suite, which was ready for us early. We were very grateful for this after our flight from Boston. The room was clean, and spacious. My only complaints were that the bathroom is badly designed. I can see the look that they are trying for, but I need real lighting in a bathroom, and real shower doors. I wondered why there was a drain in the bathroom floor, and it's because it was near impossible to shower in either the tub or shower stall without soaking the floor. There needs to be better lighting and an exhaust fan. The lack of these was an issue that if I were staying for more than a few days would have been a real issue for me. The rooftop bar and pool were great, and the location was excellent for us. Close enough to everything! The only other complaint is the business center does not have a printer. So you can print your boarding passes. The hotel offers to rpint them for you if you email the document, but you have to know how to convery it to a pdf first? I was just happy my husband took care of that...but it would be a really inexpensive upgrade to the business center to add a printer. Otherwise, we had a great stay here!

<Title>“Good location, but better hotels to choose from.”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel after our cruise for one night. Previously we had stayed at the Villa Emilia and loved it. This hotel did not even come close with a similar price tag. The interior is a bit run down and needs some extra cleaning and repairs to the decor. It is a bit cold and uninviting even for a "contemporary" design. We got a room on the 3rd floor looking into the interior courtyard, I would recommend asking for one of these to avoid street noise. There is no solution, however, for the subway noise that comes all the way up through the entire hotel. There are no irons available at this hotel, which irks me since I've been traveling for 2 weeks and my clothes are all wrinkled. My other issue was the hair dryer that is installed in the bathroom. Ours was so old that it barely worked and there was no replacement available. On a positive note, the location is right off of La Rambla and close to several public transportation stations. Also, the staff was helpful in securing us a restaurant reservation while we were out sightseeing, which we appreciated on a Friday night. Breakfast is included, extensive and has some great hot and cold choices. Final word is that you just want to sleep here and nothing else.

Great hotel at a great price in a great location Loved the roof top bar Will stay again when I go back to Barcelona and the best thing was that my room was ready for an early check in when I arrived from an over night flight!! The Jazz hotel is the besttttt

<Content>If you want a great room with a view and little street noise, spring for a corner room. Great space. Don't miss the roof top pool and the free internet PC in the business center. The breakfast buffet is really good but you can find a Starbucks one block away. The subway system is less than a two block walk. There are great tapas restaurants in the area.

<Content>Just returned from a 3 night stay in a fabulous city. Hotel Jazz is contemporary, spotlessly clean and in a brilliant location to explore the city....literally minutes away from La Rambla and the surrounding areas. Our room was spacious,lovely roomy bed and nicely furnished in a modern style. A very nice bonus came in the form of the roof top pool and bar which was a great way to spend an hour or two in the early evening relaxing before heading off for a niight out in Barca

<Title>“The good, the bad and the ugly.....”
<Content>We just returned three days ago from a seven night stay at the Hotel Jazz. Before I begin, let me say that I am not a really picky person unless things start to pile up and annoy me. A hotel room for us is mostly a place to sleep a few hours, shower and get OUT for the day/night. We were in Barcelona for our 25th wedding anniversary, so I selected a hotel that I thought would be a little 'special' to celebrate. I'll start with the GOOD: The rooftop pool. Without this pool, this property would have only gotten 2 stars/bubbles (if that) from me. The pool is wonderful, with food and beverage service available (mojitos!!). The only downside is that they close this area off at 10:00pm; there were several nights when it would have been nice to sit up on the roof, have a drink and look at the lights of Barcelona. The BAD: Things are just a little weird, as though they were reluctant to pay for repairs; we had track lights that were flickering for three days before they were replaced, the slider to the non existent patio did not lock, the end cap that held the toilet paper on the holder was missing (which caused the roll to come flying off every time you used a few sheets of the sandpaper-like paper). The cable TV worked fine the first couple of days, but after that, we only got a handful of stations and no longer got BBC. The a/c did not work the first night we were there, but, in fairness, they DID fix that the next day as soon as I told them about it.. Then there were the things that were just poorly designed. The hotel LOOKS great, but trying to put on make-up in the (black) bathroom was laughable. The makeup mirror was positioned in an unlit area, so I was never QUITE sure where the mascara was ending up. The cord on the blow dryer was too short to be able to see yourself in the mirror while you dried your hair. The a/c seemed to have two settings; permafrost or sweat lodge. Worst of all, the tub was really slippy; you took your life in your hands every time you got out of the shower. We had some trouble getting toiletries replenished and had no bar soap for two days (they were very thorough about taking away the leftover soap though; too thorough). Plus, it took a note to the housekeeping staff and TWO subsequent phone calls to get a couple of extra pillows. The UGLY: One day, after being out for hours in the hot sun, we decided to head back to the hotel for some 'pool time'. We walked through the doors at the same time as a couple of young women from Holland. We all walked through the door with sunglasses on. As we took our first steps, we ALL started skidding across the floor towards some stairs at 100mph in different directions. The (black) marble-y floor was wet and soapy, but we couldn't see that walking in from the bright sunlight with sunglasses on. There were NO signs warning of 'wet floor' and the men doing the actually mopping were on the other side of the room. It was a miracle that none of us actually fell; my life flashed before my eyes more than once in those split seconds. Once we all came to a stop, I looked around to see if I'd missed a 'wet floor sign'; I hadn't. I went kind of ballistic, yelling at the mopping guys, "WHERE IS THE SIGN??". They couldn't have cared less and actually seemed annoyed with US for walking on their wet floor! The front desk staff seemed surprisingly unconcerned as well. It really annoyed me and at that moment, I decided I needed to write a review.... Did I have a wonderful time in Barcelona? Absolutely! Did I love the roof top pool and whoever made the cocktails? Yes and yes! Would I consider staying here again? Not likely. For the price, I think we (and you) can do better. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

<Title>“modern and clean”
<Content>This is a modern, clean hotel located at the end of the Ramblas. The room was comfortable and of a good size. The location is good for sights and restaurants, shops etc. My criticism of the hotel however would be I found the staff at reception a little cold and generally it lacked a sense of character /atmosphere. That’s me being picky though, Barcelona is a great city!

<Title>“Great location, huge rooms!”
<Content>Highly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Jazz--room/bathroom very large and bed was comfortable. Rooftop pool smallish but still a must-see! Hotel staff very accomodating, except when we ordered breakfast via room service--we were told they "didn't have fried eggs, only omelettes or scrambled", which boggles the mind... Very good location, close to Las Ramblas and very short walk to two metro stops. Would stay here again!

<Title>“Nice hotel, could be noisy”
<Content>We stayed just one night before departing from the airport, and I asked for a "quiet" room based on other reviews. We got just what we wanted in a top floor, inside courtyard facing room. It was indeed very quiet, except for the hall noise. Fortunately, we only heard the hotel cleaning staff in the hall ( as if they were in the room) as they finished their day and didn't have any late night revelers near our room. Otherwise, the room was nicely done, and the stay was great for what we needed. This hotel is in a rather busy area near the University, so if you are looking for a quieter location, you may want to look elsewhere. The staff was all very helpful and all spoke English to make things easy.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel, excellent location!”
<Content>Just back from a three day stay at Hotel Jazz and have no complaints! Hotel is in a great location, two min walk to La Rambla and the bus stop for the Aerobus. Room was quite large, larger than expected for a city centre hotel - the bathroom was massive. Beds are very comfortable. You can hear the metro going under the hotel, even on the 5th floor, but not so much that it would disturb your sleep. The pool area looked nice, we didn't spend much time up there though, just had a quick drink on our first evening. Drink is quite expensive in the hotel, 8euro for a G&T but it is to be expected for a city centre hotel. The staff were lovely too, very helpful. Would defo recommend hotel and will defo be back soon!

<Title>“Excellent hotel in a great location”
<Content>We recently stayed at the Jazz pre-cruise May 25 and post cruise June 7. This hotel lived up to the good reviews already posted on Trip Advisor. We got in earlier than check-in time and was allowed not only to check into the room but was also upgraded to a suite. Very roomy and wonderful amenities. Our second stay we got there very early and wanted to do some sightseeing, so they kept our luggage for us until the room was ready. On the 7th floor and on the 5th floor on our second night there, we never heard street or subway noise enough to disturb our sleep. The staff was English speaking and very helpful. I never saw them lose their cool even when the front desk was swamped with a sudden horde of check in guests. And they gave us city maps and a coupon for a discount on the Bus Turistic which was a great way to see Barcelona. The location makes it easy to walk to sights and restaurants. The Cafe Viena is right across the street if you are looking for light fare and are in a hurry. Valuable to me was the free wi-fi and it worked well. They even offered to print off boarding passes for us. Actually we never expected to find a European hotel of this caliber and value and were very pleased overall.

<Title>“Good location; well informed hotel staff”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Jazz for 2 nights prior to a cruise that departed from Barcelona. We followed the hotel website advice and took the AeroBus from the airport. We got off the bus at the stop indicated by the website, however despite the hotel being very close to the stop, it was not in sight. So after a bit of confusion we had to stop at a local Starbucks for directions. This was the most disappointing part of our stay... Otherwise this was a nicely located, clean and well staffed hotel. The rooms were small, but not by European standards. The hotel staff were very helpful, providing information regarding the tour buses and excellent restaurant recommendations.

<Content>Hotel Jazz is just 2 blocks from Las Ramblas so it's a perfect location for touring, walking and finding great restaurants. It's a very sleek and modern hotel, deceiving from the outside. The beautfiul hard wood floors in the room were a great improvement over traditional dark hotel carpeting. The room was quiet and we were lucky enough to have a room with windows on 2 walls. Hotel was very clean as well & free wifi. The front desk was always helpful in suggestions and pointing us in the right direction. A short taxi ride to cruise port.

Rooms were very clean and modern (great design including hardwood laminate floors, which I appreciate as an allergy sufferer)! Staff were super helpful when I had problems with some online concert tickets I'd purchased. Location is fantastic, with a five-minute walk to Plaza Catalunya (hub for buses and metro) and Las Ramblas. Hotel decor is modern and elegant, and the roof-top pool area gives you a lovely view of the city. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Found this hotel on Trip Advisor and loved it. It's in a great location for walking around the city and it's very close to where the tourist route hop-on/hop-off buses stop which is very convenient. If you don't have breakfast included in your room deal then you might want to grab something elsewhere as it's quite expensive in the hotel. However, if you are a big breakfast eater you can have a good feed and skip lunch!! The bathrooms in this hotel were big and lovely!

<Content>We had a pleasant stay here. It was just minutes away from las Ramblas and I felt we got a pretty good price. If you stay in a hotel right on las Ramblas, it can be pretty pricy. So we chose to stay just 2 blocks away here at the Jazz Hotel. The only issue we had was that we somehow kept tripping the breaker when we plugged in our electronics (laptop, cell phone charger) which resulted in the A/C turning off. But they quickly resolved the problem. The pool was smaller than we expected, but it really was a beautiful view of the city.

<Title>“Nothing but location...”
<Content>This was our 1st disappointment with regards to the accommodations chosen for our trip through Europe. Yes, the location is great but it was not enough to please us. 1st of all, we have faced problems with our booking that was made to may and somehow confirmed to april (and it was our fault do not follow up their confirmation details). On the other hand, the lady on front desk was very helpful, informing that we could stay overnight and looking for other options among their sister-hotels. Luckily she found a stay to accommodate us on U232, 2km far from Jazz. We had no other option but accept at that stage. The room we have stayed overnight was clean and spacious (the biggest we had so far), but the bed was the worst ever (and then we felt grateful for just having one night there). The main street besides the hotel is very noisy, and we could hear all that noisy from the 4th floor! The subway noisy was there close as well... The breakfast was very poor for the price charged. We have asked for some tourist info on front desk but they have nothing to offer. This hotel is ok for business travelers, but we would never return there for fun.

Hotel has its own parking but it is underground around some very tight corners - don't bring your own car in here!!! Loads of shops nearby, restaurants, good late-night jazz bar. Good price for Barcelona. I would definitely stay here again. Don't forget you swimming/sunbathing kit - we did so couldn't use the lovely roof top pool.

The rooftop pool, bar and view TOTALLY make the place - having been our first time in Spain, it was awesome to get there and go there first thing at sunset to see the view of the whole city! The staff weren't the best if looking for true concierge service but they were nice and helpful enough. I will add to the comment of get a higher level room as the hotel is right above the subway but it never once kept us awake at night.

<Title>“Met my expectations and a little more”
<Content>My husband's first trip to Europe. Picked this hotel because of the reviews on trip advisor. Wanted a small hotel with amenities and this filled our expectations. Great Location in heart of city by University and a short walk to Las Ramblas. Small boutigue Hotel with roof top pool. Hardly heard the subway underneath the property and for the most part staff was friendly. Free internet service was a big plus. Rooms were modern and clean. No Iron in room and hotel charges for usage of one and also our converter did not work at this hotel but I know the front desk does have their own supply, not sure if there is a charge. We did without. Loved that there was only 8 floors and that there was a bar area for relaxing. Our room was on the 7th floor facing the front so expect street noise but that did not bother us. If you like modern, clean with a hint of sophistication but down to earth this is your hotel for Barcelona

<Title>“Excellent modern hotel”
<Content>I don't wish to add to all of the positive comments that have already been written. The hotel is modern, clean, efficient, in a great position, the staff I met were helpful and professional, and thsi was a great base to see a fascinating city. I loved the roof top pool, though the weather was not good enough to use it every day. I slept well with no disturbance, even on a night Barcelona lost the cup to Madrid!

<Content>Good Hotel in a good hotel that is near the Hop On, Hop Off bus stops for both major routes. 15-minute walk to Gaudi's commercial buildings. The location makes the hotel worth it. Excellent coffee shop nearby...

<Title>“Great stay at Hotel Jazz”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at Jazz for four nights in a corner suite. We stayed on the 7th floor. We heard no street noise or noise from other guest. The metro rumbling could not be heard either. We slept so soundly we had to set the alarm to get up. We got in before checkin but the room was ready so we could checkin. The room was immaculate and meet all our needs. It is tucked away from the main street but is accessible to everywhere you would wish to go. We ate breakfast out every morning. I would recommend this hotel to anyone coming to this lovely city. Esp.,first time vistors. You are a hop and a skip away from so many things and taxis and the metro are so close by. The staff (we tend not to call them alot, just for cabs, etc) were very nice and helpful. The only that would have made it better was a coffee machine in the room and robes!

<Title>“Good location”
<Content>I actually stayed here in June 2010, but have only gotten around to writing this review now. The hotel room my girlfriend and I were in was very good. The decor was very modern and was pleasant to come back to at the end of the day after doing all the sightseeing. It was a corner suite, so was of a decent size too. The pool on the roof was great and it was a nice, relaxing way to finish off the day as well. The location of the hotel was perfect. It was only about a 5min walk to the top of Las Ramblas and to a metro/underground railway station. Far enough away from the crowds, but close enough to the action and transport. Barcelona is a beautiful city with plenty to see and do, so being near the transport and Las Ramblas is a big bonus for this hotel. I found the staff pleasant and helpful as well. If I were to travel back to Barcelona, I would definitely make this hotel my first option.

<Content>On our recent trip to Barcelona my husband and I stayed at Hotel Jazz on the recommendation of a friend who had recently stayed there. The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated. The hotel itself is just off a main street so you don't get as much noise as some other hotels. It is close to the metro stops and main must see tourist attractions. The staff was very helpful during our stay.

<Title>“Perfect location”
<Content>We have just returned from 4 nights at the Jazz and it was perfect. The location was a 2inute walk from the aerobus stop and 5 mins from Las Ramblas. We had a room on the 7th floor and the noise wAS what was to be expected from a Hotel in a city centre . We purchased a T 10 metro card and a stop was just outside the Hotel. The number 59 bus went all the way down the Ramblas to the beach and the fish outside the arts hotel so it was good to walk all the way down there knowing we could get the bus all the way back. The best tip we got was to catch the metro to Vallcarca to go to Parc gualle and then follow the directions to the outside escalators that brought you in at the top of the park. Yes there is no bell boy but to be honest it makes us feel uncomfortable to have someone lugging our cases around. This Hotel is perfect for a trip to Barcelona

<Title>“Nice hotel, only fair service”
<Content>The Hotel Jazz is located in a very good location. It is within walking distance of the Port (without bags) and a reasonable taxi ride to the airport. The location is pretty much in the middle of everything Barcelona has to offer. The rooms are good, clean and spacious. Breakfast is OK, not great. The hotel reception is fair. They process you in fast enough and will help you with directions. But, there is no one to help you with your bags. Despite having a guy in a bellhop uniform walking around in the lobby, forget about having any bellhop service. Be prepared to handle your own bags. Having already the reviews on this site, I was prepared not to get upset. The management has obviously decided to remain substandard in the service department. It speaks to their loss of potential. Our friends stayed at the St. Moritz a few blocks away. The rooms are not much better in quality and the breakfast seems to be the same… but the service appears to be somewhat better and the lobby is much nicer. They also offer international newspapers. Either hotel works, as long as you manage your expectations.

<Title>“lovely hotel, modern clean and friendly staff!”
<Content>My husband and i went to barcelona for a short 4 day break to celebrate my 40th. We were moved to jazz hotel as there were a few problems with the original hotel. i am so glad they did as it was a lovely hotel, very modern decor and extremely clean with very freindly staff. we were also given one of the larger rooms on the 5th floor which was lovely and although you could just hear the noise of the underground it never disturbed us at night. The roof top pool was a nice way to relax after a days sight seeing and i would definately return to jazz hotel the next time we visit barcelona and would recommend it to friends.

<Title>“Great Experience and Great Location at Hotel Jazz”
<Content>We stayed in Hotel Jazz for our first trip to Barcelona and had a great experience. (We were taking a cruise out of Barcelona and wanted to spend a few days in the city before it left.) Not only were we able to check in early (a blessing after a long flight from the U.S.) we were upgraded to a Junior Suite at no additional charge - without even asking! The room was amazing. We were on the corner of the 7th floor and had a wrap-around balcony (which was quite narrow, but the views were still incredible.) We thought we'd have to take the metro everywhere, but the hotel's location was terrific. We could easily walk to the Catedral and Las Ramblas, and even walked down to the docks one afternoon when we felt a bit more adventurous. We walked around at night and felt very safe since there's lots of activity. The beds were very comfortable, and I thought the room was much larger than I expected from a European hotel. All in all, a terrific stay at Hotel Jazz. I definitely recommend it!

<Title>“What a great hotel”
<Content>Stayed with 6 friends and had a lovely stay at this hotel. The double rooms were great (although could do with a mirror on the desk area) and the triple was great value and really spacious, fine for 3 adults. The hotel is well located for all the sights and shopping and the pool/terrace was a great place to relax. We were room only so didn't try breakfast although the bar snacks were fine and reasonably priced. The hotel bar is a bit lacking in atmosphere and service during the day was a slow but don't let this put you off. Staff were helpful and it was no problem for Reception to confirm our dinner reservation. I would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“A Great Choice in Barcelona”
<Content>My husband pronounced Hotel Jazz the perfect combination of location, amenities, cool design, and value. From him, that is high praise! We spent 3 nights here at the end of April, and I'm so glad I picked this hotel. The location, close to Placa Catalunya, was perfect for our sightseeing and dining needs. We loved going up on the roof deck in the evening for a short swim, followed by a glass of wine at one of the tables set up there. Our room, on a high floor, was quiet even though it faced the front sidewalk. We had a great vantage point from which to view the festivities (honking and flag-waving) after Barca's vistory over Real Madrid. viva Catalunya!

<Title>“Absolutely FABULOUS Hotel!”
<Content>This hotel was worth every penny spent. It's in the heart of the city and steps away from La Rambla, Catalunya Square, great shopping and the subway. The hotel is well decorated and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. Our room faced the street and we didn't hear a thing at night - good sound-proofing. The roof-top patio with pool was a perfect place to hang out when the weather was nice and you needed a break from sight seeing. The staff was friendly and very helpful when recommending places to go and eat or to just check out. Overall, it's a great hotel!

<Content>Hotel Jazz was great! Just far enough off of the main strip (about 3 minute walk) to keep the noise down, but close enough to walk everywhere you want to go. Very nice, very clean. The breakfast they offer is decent, but for the cost you could probably find better down the street. The bar menu could use a larger selection as well, but it is reasonably priced. The front desk was helpful. They have 2 computers with internet access you can use which was very nice if you are traveling abroad. All in all, we had a great stay and would definitely stay at a NN hotel again.

<Title>“Comfortable, central and quiet hotel”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed for 5 nights in Hotel Jazz. Overall: very satified! The pro's Quiet. We stayed on the seventh floor, not on the street side. It was one of the more quiet city hotels that we have stayed in. We heared/felt sometimes a rumbling the metro below (but it did not bother us, although we are very soundsensitive). We didn't hear our neighbours at all. Very central. Near to the main tourist attractions, the metro and the airport shuttle bus. Friendly staff. They where friendly and helpful. Relatively big room. We had a standard double that was spacious. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. There was a small rooftop pool and bar. There was a free and fast wifi connection. The cons If any, it would have been nice to be able to make some tea of coffee in our room.

<Title>“Great location, modern and comfortable”
<Content>Arrived at the hotel at 12pm, although check in isn't until 3pm. The receptionist rang housekeeping and we were told our room would be ready in 20 mins if we'd like to leave our bags. We decided to wait and within 10mins we were told our room was ready, very impressed. On using the in room safe there was an error, as i don't think it had been reset from the last person, but we contacted reception and they were there in 5 mins to sort it, very efficient. Our room was on the 4th floor, very spacious, modern and clean. The bathroom offered a free handy kit of everything you could possibly have forgotten. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of wardrobe space. The only real problem with the hotel position is the loud rumbling noise of the metro that runs directly beneath. This could be heard regularly and runs from 5am - 12am (and until 2am on weekends). It sounded like a big rumble of thunder every 15mins or so. Although a bit of a nuisance it didn't actually disrupt my sleep and reading other reviews it may be best to request a room on a higher floor if you're a light sleeper. I wouldn't let it put you off. We enjoyed drinks in the hotel bar one evening, great service and relaxed ambience. The only reservation was that the bar shuts at 11pm which was a tad early for us. A breakfast buffet was included in our stay and was typically european, plenty of choice (although i prefer an english breakfast myself) I'm sure the meats, cheeses, fruit and cakes will suit many pallets. There was one staff member who did not speak much english and therefore seemed to avoid us rather than offering us tea and coffee. The hotel is in a fantastic location just a couple of minutes walk from the top of La Rambla and Plaza de Catalunya where the bus tours start from. The hotel offers free wi-fi which was great and a free bag storage service after check out. The hotel has a great roof terrace with plenty of seating, great views of the city and a pool, although it was too cold to use. I would highly recommend this hotel. Travel tip: From Barcelona airport take the train to Passeig de Gracia, switch onto the metro, purple line one stop to Universitat and the hotel is just round the corner. Get a T10 ticket which gives you 10 journeys and can be shared. Beware of lifts in the metro/train station as we caught some low-lifes with their hands in our bags!!

<Title>“Fantastic value for money”
<Content>Jazz Hotel was a hit with its minimal modern decor, location and great breakfat. If you are looking for something unpretentious as a base to explore Barcelona Jazz Hotel is the perfect choice. We had a quiet room on the 4th floor looking into a courtyard but could still hear a muffled noise from the metro running underneath the road. This is my only recommendation, if you want a quiet room ask to stay in a room on an upper floor. I cannot comment on the swimming pool as it was too cold to use. It looks small in the picture but this should not put you off, Barcelona has a very good beach! Also remember this is a crammed city and a roof top swimming pool is a real bonus.

<Title>“Lovely hotel, faultless location and good service.”
<Content>We stayed for 5 nights in April and had requested a quiet room and were given one on the 7th floor. The metro below was just a quiet rumble but definitely more noticeable on the lower floors. The room was stylish, clean and you could step out onto a mini balcony. The bed was great, really big. My only gripe about the bathroom was that the water leaked from the shower onto the floor really easily but that's just a minor complaint. Although we didn't use the rooftop pool it looked lovely and the terraced area was a great spot for catching the sun. We got breakfast as part of the deal which was fine - ham, cheese, bolied eggs, sausages, fruit, pastries, yoghurts and cereals. You could also ask for a generous amount of scrambled eggs or an omelette, made to order. The hotel's location was fantastic, pretty much walking distance from most of the must-see areas. As mentioned many times the metro is just metres away and the airport stops at Univerisat (about 100m away from the hotel). On the last day, we left our luggage at the hotel to spend a few extra hours in Barcelona and in a rush I stupidly locked the key to my suitcase inside the case along with my passport!! When I told the receptionists they didn't bat an eyelid but when to great efforts to remove my padlock. That was great service!

<Title>“Great modern hotel in a fantastic location”
<Content>Barcelona was our last stop on a 2 week trip through Spain last summer (June 2010) during the World Cup. This boutique hotel has very nice, clean rooms. The beds were extremely comfortable, and the room sized very nice by European standards. You also can't beat the location, as it is steps from the metro and just blocks from good food, shopping and drinking. Two of my favorite spots were the Irish Pub across the street (brand new and great for a pint to start the day), and the pizza place right around the block (best pie we had the entire trip). But do take note of the many out door cafes and restaurants that are within minutes walking distance. This really was the perfect hotel to cap the end of our trip. Would definitely stay here again, especially since it is such a bargain price.

<Title>“Top location and great service”
<Content>We recently had a family gathering of 9 people, including two teenagers, and found the location to be ideal for all - close to the main streets and sites, shopping, restaurants and university. The hotel itself is quite nice. Service was excellent, and the roof-top pool and deck was lovely. The weather was a bit too cold to swim, but we enjoyed bringing wine, bread and cheese up to enjoy the city views. One of the reasons we stayed was the 'Jazz Triple' which allowed my 15 year old nephew to stay in the same room with his parents. It was not easy to find in the downtown area. I recommend the Hotel Jazz highly, and without reservation. But you should probably make your own reservations!

<Content>This was our second stay at the Jazz, the first one was a few years ago. Very clean and modern. My wife will stay no where else. We arrived early on April 16th and the staff cheerfully let us keep our luggage there until the room was ready. We had a suite that had a fabulous beautiful view from every window. It is walking distance to the Las Ramblas ( 2 blocks). Excellent location. We sat at the rooftop where their is a pool and lots of chairs and tables, But still very private and drank cava while looking at the beautiful view of Barcelona. Although I spoke some spanish, the staff spoke very good english. The staff is very helpful in getting information and maps. The internet access was great and they even have a few computers you can use for free if you did not have one. You will not regret staying at this hotel.

<Title>“Amazing Location”
<Content>Just got back from a short post cruise stay in Barcelona. I chose the Hotel Jazz based on recommendations from trip advisor. The hotel has an amazing location! We were able to walk to las Ramblas and the HoHo bus stop was only a block away. The metro station was also very close but we didn't use it. I was also in shopping heaven as there are also shops all around the hotel. We had a room on the second floor and yes you could feel the rumble from the metro station. Did it keep me up, no it reminded me of planes flying over our house. Friday night/ Saturday morning there was also a bit of outside noise from folks making their way home around 3:00 am. I will be honest that the noise didn't bother me that much. When I go back to Barcelona I will most certainly look at staying at the Hotel Jazz again.

<Title>“Bedbugs”
<Content>We stayed in Hotel Jazz and we liked it first! But then my friend had after one night spots on her skin that grow bigger and bigger during the day. After coming back to the hotel we showed them the spots and the hotelstaff said that there is no other room to change but they would clean everything in our room. So we agreed but then i got also bites when i was lying on my bed and we went back to the reception to ask for another room. This time they agreed to move us to another room. We were happy to be in another room because sleeping in the same beds would have been a torture...with the bedbugs! So, we had a very unhappy situation and we couldnt enjoy our trip as we wanted. I guess this can happen in every hotel nowadays.. I think we would have appreciated it there would have been a person thats responsible (like a director or a chef) that would have taken a deciction to move us straight away to another room. The positive was that we got offered (after asking a discount) one night for free and a breakfast. I hope they will check this room so no other guests will suffer...

<Title>“Totally Overrated, Substandard Service”
<Content>We chose this hotel based on the great reviews on Tripadvisor but we would never stay here again, nor could we recommend it, based entirely on the inexperienced and often rude hotel staff which I will explain in a minute. This one issue could make or break your stay and I strongly advise you consider these comments before you book as there are many better places to stay in Barcelona in equally nice locations. On the positive side the hotel is clean and modern, our suite was comfortable, the housekeeper was terrific (and so nice, something lacking at this hotel), and the location is good. On the other hand, with just a few exceptions the front desk staff is for the most part rude, uninterested in helping you, uninformative, and indifferent. In all my years of travelling internationally and throughout the US, I can’t imagine anyone at any hotel, whether a Four Seasons or a Hilton, speaking to a guest and treating them the way one particular front desk woman treated us (she checked us in around noon and seems to work midday and is nasty beyond description). It was just unbelievable to the point where we even spent part of our first day looking at other hotels as we couldn’t imagine staying at a place like this. The entire check-in process was a bad experience. There were three of us travelling (including my 15 year old daughter and my mother who’s in her mid-70s). We were dropped off in front and after 20 hours of travel and with 8 days worth of luggage, noticing we had to lug our belongings down some stairs to the front desk, you would think at least SOMEONE would have gotten up off their chairs and offered to help, or at minimum say hello and welcome. There were 3 clerks (the nasty woman and 2 guys) just sitting there watching us. After I made it down with my bags I asked if there was a bellman or someone to assist my mother and the front desk woman snapped "This is a 3 star hotel, we don't offer that service!" Wow, okay, I didn’t know that but I also wasn’t expected to be scolded. You’d think at least one of the 2 guys could have been a gentleman and earned a tip. We were never greeted with a hello, welcome to Barcelona, how was your flight – something would have been nice. She barely made eye contact. The indifference she showed us was just shocking. And we couldn’t have been more polite to her! After finishing the paperwork I asked for a map and a few suggestions as to where we could walk around that afternoon. Again, this woman continued to be downright nasty to the point where I finally had to ask if there was something bothering her as we couldn’t quite figure out why she was so mean to us. Did she hate Americans? Did she not like women? We were dumbfounded. All we did was check in and ask for some suggestions and we couldn’t have been nicer. When we got to our room we found that the phones weren’t working (and they repeatedly broke during our stay). The first few times we had to call the front desk about the problem they actually seemed annoyed with us. The bathroom had a hair dryer that barely blew air so I called the front desk to find out if they perhaps had another dryer they could send up and wouldn’t you know it, I got the nasty woman who snapped “I have one here but if you want it you need to come downstairs and get it yourself or you’ll have to wait 10 minutes because I’M BUSY”. I cannot imagine in my wildest dreams any hotel staffer anywhere speaking to a hotel guest that way! A couple of times we asked other staffers for dinner suggestions. A few suggestions were good, but one clerk who was super nice was clearly inexperienced as she sent us to a place that was barely a step above a pizza hut. We had much better luck finding things on our own. I just don’t think many of the Jazz staff have the knowledge and experience to offer valuable suggestions and/or act in the capacity of a concierge. Another staffer gave us incorrect information about where to meet our tour bus and how to handle payments. Bottom line, if you want a full service hotel with a proper concierge (or other services like a bellman, full service restaurant) this is NOT the place for you. We should have payed a little more and stayed at the Meridien, which looked absolutely lovely and in hindsight would have been the better option. If you just want a clean and comfortable place to sleep this hotel is fine. But absolutely, undeniably overrated!

<Title>“Hip, Modern Hotel in a great location”
<Content>I traveled to Barcelona for a business trip and stayed at another hotel across town, which was older, much less comfortable, and had lousy guest service. Once my boss left, I stayed an extra couple days and transferred to Jazz based on Tripadvisor reviews. Jazz was great, really. It's near the happening part of town, including La Rambla. The staff was extremely nice at checkin and helped arrange cabs and gave recommendations. The room was great - very modern, and extremely clean. I can't say my room had a great view - it was a interior alleyway type view, but enough to let light in. Unlike the other hotel I stayed at in Barcelona, the WiFI was terrible to the point of being useless. Jazz had great wifi. TV service was also pretty good Compared to everything else I looked at, Jazz was a steal. I'd recommend this to anyone, but definitely book early.

<Title>“Great Location! Lived up to TA reviews, but needs places to eat improvement”
<Content>If I could I would give this hotel 4 1/2 out of 5. The only reason I do not give this hotel 5 is because of their places to eat recommendations. We went to Celler de Tapes the 1st night and most of the food was decent but not a wow! They also gave us a recommendation for Matamala for Paella and when we ordered it was not the traditional color of Paella and was bland in taste, however the salad was good. If you want paella, I would recommend Los Toreros on Xulca 3-5 in the Ravel area. Be prepared for a large Paella for two that 4 people could eat. The Jazz Hotel should rethink their restaurant recommendations. We did not eat breakfast at the Jazz, but there are plenty of cheaper options around the area. There is a 24hr small market across the street where you can get drinks and other food items. The location is the best part. So close to everything including Plaza Cataluña and right on the corner of Pelia and Catalunya is a bank with ATM's inside the doors. I would not trust the street ATM's which are too open to the public streets. Subway Noise- not an issue at night and we were on floor two. A slight rumbling of noise but not a big issue. We had a slight problem with the bathroom which was fixed in 10mins. We would stay again!

<Title>“Perfect”
<Content>Clean, bright, comfortable, in a perfect location near Placa Cataluna, but without the noise. Airport bus stops about 50 metres from the hotel, metro station likewise. Reception staff speak excellent English and were able to answer all our questions. We didn't use the small rooftop pool but like everything else it was clean and smart with fantastic view of the city and pool towels provided. Can't wait to get back to Barcelona and I'd definitely stay at the Jazz again

<Title>“Would Recommend Over and Over”
<Content>I have read the strangest reviews about this hotel. I agree with the positive reviews. The hotel was in a great location steps away from the Ramblas and the Gothic district in the center of everything, yet was peaceful and quiet. The staff was polite and very helpful with good English. We tripped a breaker in our room TWICE and the staff was polite and patient. The rooms were modern and VERY clean. The beds are comfortable--not the softest, but European beds usually aren't--didn't have any trouble sleeping and no morning aches at all. People have complained about the sound of the metro being impossible to live with. That's just crazy to me! The noise from the metro was very minimal, like VERY distant occasional rumbling thunder. We loved this hotel and would recommend it again and again.

<Content>Stayed in hotel jazz at end of february, staff at reception very helpfull, very fast checkin and checkout. Rooms were a nice size and clean, free wi-fi was handy, bathroom clean good size all amenities available great stock of soap,shampoo,shaving kit etc. we were on the second floor so there was a little noise from traffic and metro but we were able to have full nights sleep each night. Location of hotel is excellent very close to airport shuttle bus stops,walking distance to las ramblas and metro very near which we used alot to get around the city and was very good and cheap to get around. Barcelona was a fab city to visit loads to see and do.

<Title>“Excellent value”
<Content>I stayed at Hotel Jazz for 5 nights in February and could not be more pleased with my stay for what I paid. The hotel is very clean and well kept up, the rooms are a decent size for Europe. The bathroom is stocked with toiletries galore! (comb, shaving kit, shoe mit, you name it!) I read other reviewers saying it was noisy, but this was not my experience. Granted, I live in Manhattan, so perhaps I have a different sense of noise, but we slept with the sliding door open every night with no problems. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice hotel, in a great area, for a reasonable price.

<Title>“Great spot to explore city”
<Content>Spent 4 days/nights at Hotel Jazz and was very pleased with every aspect of the hotel. Location was excellent, the bus from the airport stops just a couple blocks away, it was around the corner from the metro, and within walking distance to Las Ramblas and Gothic Quarter. On top of the location, the service was excellent - front desk was helpful at all times and very friendly too. The room was comfortable and modern, slept like a baby in the bed - it is on a busy street and can be loud when the window(s) are open but when closed the noise is barely heard - shouldn't be an issue unless you are a very light sleeper. Barcelona is a beautiful city and this was a perfect location to explore the city from.

<Content>The Jazz lived up to its good reputation - attractive entrance to a spotlessly maintained hotel with courteous, helpful and efficient staff. The location of the hotel is ideal for all public transport and many of the top city attractions, restaurants, bars and cafes. While there is a roof-top pool, it is neither large enough or deep enough for swimming; neither is it heated. Next time I stay, I shall leave my cossie at home.

<Content>This was our first time in Barcelona and after reading the reviews we were not disappointed with the hotel. The room was fantastic, clean, spacious and the staff friendly. The hotel has great terrace on the roof with nice views. Breakfast was good and the staff made sure everything was kept topped up. I would definately stay in this hotel again. As other people have mentioned there is a rumble from the metro so a room on a high floor is recommended however this doesn't take away from the fact the hotel is in great location for Marina, las ramblas, airport and metro.

<Title>“exceeded my expectations”
<Content>It's a bit difficult to try and add anything different about this hotel.It appears to have all been said, but I will try. Check-in was quick and easy, very polite professional staff, honouring our request for a high floor. Our 7th floor room was spacious and clean, good supply of toiletries and storage space. Comfortable generous sized beds, and little noise from busy Barcelona allowed a good nights sleep. Breakfast was a choice of the usual suspects, hot breakfast, fruit, pastries and omelettes to order. Being close to the metro and tourist buses in catalunya square made it a easy to travel around barcelona. A 5 minute walk brought us to the very busy La Ramblas. I must say at this point that although fore-warned, we did not experience any personal threat to our safety or security and thoroughly enjoyed Barcelona. Well located hotel that i would gladly recommend to fellow travellers.

<Title>“Huge triple room--so hard to find in most cities”
<Content>We had a great stay here. The triple room was huge! For a great price we got a very large corner room that had a separate area with the extra bed (a comfy fold out couch). 4 people actually could've stayed comfortably here. Triples are usually so hard to find in Europe so we were very happy. It was street facing and even on a higher floor, it was kind of noisy at night. But that was an easy trade-off for being in such a good, central location. The front desk was so attentive, helping us with reservations and answering questions. Both lights next to the bedside were broken and when we notified the staff, they offered to switch us to a different room since maintenance couldn't come for 2 more days (we declined but it was a nice offer). The bathroom was spacious, the wifi was free in the rooms, and the rooftop with the pool/bar had great views. We paid for the buffet breakfast one morning and it had a good selection of hot/cold foods, fresh fruit, and beverages (even freshly squeezed oj).

<Title>“Perfect hotel in a perfect location, would definately recommend this gem!”
<Content>We arrived at Hotel Jazz around 12:30PM and we were able to check in straight away as the room was ready for us. The staff on the front desk were very friendly and helpful, advising us on access to the room safe and providing us with the password for the free wi-fi. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the room was so spacious - previous hotels we've stayed at in cities have been much smaller. The room was very clean, modern and we had a huge king sized bed. The minibar was well stocked, although we only had 1 drink out of it on the last night - we preferred to buy drinks etc from a supermarket and keep them chilled in the fridge as this was cheaper. The bathroom was a good size, very clean and had complimentary toiletries etc. It was lovely to come back to a very welcoming room after a long day of sightseeing. The hotel is in a perfect location being just a 5 minute walk up to Placa Catalunya where there are huge department stores and the Hard Rock Cafe is also located there. Las Ramblas begins just off Placa Catalunya which is a lovely stroll past all the stalls and leads down to the Marina. We caught the Aerobus from the airport and got off at Placa Universitat, walked up the street for 1 minute, crossed over the road and onto Carrer de Pelai and to our amazement, Hotel Jazz was right in front of us - we couldn't believe how close the drop off point was to the hotel! We would highly recommend the use of the Aerobus as it was only 5.50 euros each (compared to taxi fare of about 50 euros) and because of how easy it is to use. On our return journey, the Aerobus picks up from Placa Catalunya (not Placa Universitat) which is only a 5 minute walk from the hotel. See website http://www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/en/airport/transport/barcelona-airport-aerobus.html for more details on Aerobus. The hotel was very accomodating in storing our luggage for us past check out time on our last day so that we could enjoy a last walk around and go to the shops without having to cart all of our luggage. Hotel Jazz was an absolute gem and we would definately recommend anyone to stay here when visiting Barcelona.

<Title>“And all that Jazz...”
<Content>Top notch: great location, quality hotel and a decent price. The location is particularly good as the hotel is just off La Rambla but the entrance is on a small street tucked away from the main road. We had a room looking into the internal courtyard which ensured it was very quiet. Would also recommend including breakfast, which had a good choice and some decent cappucinos (on request). The roof area was impressive, and in the heat of summer it would be a great place to cool off (although be aware that it is not huge 'swimming' pool - more of a cooling dip).

The bathroom was huge aswell and our room was perfectly clean with any extra amenties required delivered straight to our door. On both arrival and departure we were greeted with welcoming smiles and perfect English from the people at the front desk. The location just off the ramblas is great as you have no noise and only have to walk 2 minutes to be straight in the centre of everything. We highly recommend this hotel!

<Content>The location is fantastic, steps away from La Rambla. Rooms are modern,stylish, average size. Service is limited, what I mean is that there is no-one to help you with your luggage, there is a little confusion with simple requests like room service or calling for a taxi. But then - the price for these accommodations is excellent, so i do understand the limited staffing. A 3+ star hotel with a 5 star location.

<Title>“Modern Feel with a Great Location”
<Content>The pluses of Hotel Jazz are many. The location is great, since it is right next to a metro stop and is within easy walking distance of El Raval and Las Ramblas. The price was also great. We were there during Christmas and the rate was only 80 euros a night for a standard room. They also have free wifi as well. The only negative I found is that the modern architecture did not have as much personality as many of the other places that we stayed at during our time in Spain. We started to get used to beautiful older buildings with friendly staff. Hotel Jazz had a nice staff, but it could have been a modern hotel anywhere in Europe and I think we were simply spoiled by some of the other great places we stayed at elsewhere in Spain.

<Title>“Loved It!”
<Content>I moved from a business hotel in Montjuic to Hotel Jazz for the weekend and a friends visit. The hotel location is ideal - a few steps from the University Metro stop and the Plaza Catalunya, La Rambla and Gran Via all just a short walk away. The hotel itself is very clean and modern. The rooftop and pool area is a great place to relax in the am or pm with coffee or wine. There is also a 24/7 convenience store right across the street - which is great b/c you can stock up on your own bottled water, snacks and wine for your room at a fraction of the cost of the hotel. The staff were very professional and friendly. They gave good advice about best routes to some of the touristy spots and where to catch buses back to the airport etc. I will recommend Hotel Jazz to any friend that decides to visit Barcelona and will stay there myself if I am lucky enough to go back.

<Title>“Fantastic location”
<Content>This is my fourth trip to Barcelona. The hotel I used to stay with did not allow booking 7 months out, so I checked out my alternatives. After searching tripadvisor, I decided to try Hotel Jazz. I am glad I did, as this one is more central, easier to get to from airport, and cheaper! The Aerobus from airport is conveniently located one floor below arrival level of terminal 1 ( or A?) and runs every 5-10 minutes, depending on whether it fills up quickly. Fare is only 5.1 euros. The bus stops just above the metro station Universidad, which is less than half a block from Hotel Jazz. We asked for a quiet room and was assigned 7th floor. I can understand a lower floor being bothered by the rumbling noise from a passing metro, as I can even feel( hear ) it on occasion in my room. Front desk service is superior, check in process swift. Room cleaniness and amenties fitting for a four star. Bed very comfortable. Location is what we wanted, as it is just two blocks west of la Rambla and near many attractions. The very large department store El Cortes, just north of La Ramblas, has a large grocery section in the lower floor, ideal for making a light meal to eat in the hotel .

<Title>“Hotel Jazz in Barcelona - Perfect!!!”
<Content>Hotel Jazz is a 3 star hotel in Barcelona, I would recommend this to absolutley everyone from famalies to singles or couples to groups. I personally travelled with my partner and 2 of our friends. We could not believe that it was only a 3 star hotel it was beautiful, The rooms are Spacious, Clean and Modern. The staff are Friendly and Helpful. The location if the hotel is fantastic it is very central and not noisey as you would imagine a hotel in the middle of the city is. The metro is very close to the hotel the 'universitat' stop is literaly outside the door and a few steps to to the left. The pool on the roof is beautifully laid out and very comfortable and relaxing. I dont think i had one complaint about the hotel I had an absolutley brialliant time in Barcelona and to rest my head in somewhere as nice as this was great. definatly well worth it. The only negative thing i will say is to any one who is visiting Barcelona in general is WATCH YOURE BAGS/WALLETS!!! pick pockets are everywhere around this city.

<Title>“Great Hotel, Lovely Staff, Perfect Location.......Need I Say More!!”
<Content>We stayed in this hotel on a recent trip for my partners birthday after reading alot of reviews on tripadvisor. They were all pretty spot on. The room was large and spacious (we have a corner suite) and a nice large bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and big enough!! (my partner is 6"3 so that is always a problem!.) With regards to the location, it could not be more perfect for us. i was at the top of catalunya square and was a good base for us to sightsee. We also visited the rooftop pool and terrace- it was too cold to sit out in feb but it was so much larger than we expected from the photos and im sure there would be plenty of room for guests in summer! Overall a throughly enjoyable stay.

<Title>“Rather a 4* hotel. Perfect medium budget solution.”
<Content>The hotel is situated in the very center of Barcelona. A suitable location practically for every type of vacation in the city. Just a three minutes walk from one of the central squares of the city - Plaça Catalunya. The rooms are stylish, on the second channel on the in-room radio they play really nice jazz and blues. The hotel may rather be rated as a 4*, if they put bathrobes and sleepers)) The stuff is very helpful and cooperative. So if you are looking for a medium budget, but comfortable and pleasant stay in Barcelona - this hotel probably is one of the best options.

You are in the middle of the 3 main roads- passeo del gracia, rambla and rambla catalunya. We walked everywhere. For tourists Park Guell and magic fauntain are the only two places you need transportation. Of course it is not a 5 star hotel, but que quality is much better than what I ve seen in a 3 stars.

<Title>“Convenient, modern/spartan and pleasant stay”
<Content>The hotel's walking distance location to major shopping and the touristy Las Ramblas is a major plus. But if you are looking for a warm, cozy environment this hotel is more austere modern chic. That's not a knock, just an observation. A minor quirk noted by others is the fact that the underground subway trains can be felt and heard from lower floors like ours. It didn't keep us awake, as it did others, but it is worth noting. The staff were helpful and after we checked out stored our bags for safekeeping with tags until we were ready to depart for our next city hours later. That is a nice touch since the bags were both checked and stored out of sight. Some places you worry about your bags being taken due to lax procedures. Our overall impression was good, but if you don't mind the lack of warmth it is a good place to stay in Barcelona; comfy bed (split into two twins) and good facilities. The second floor bar and computer area was also a nice addition.

<Title>“Modern, High Quality, Ideal Location”
<Content>Hotel Jazz is an excellent base for exploring the sights of Barcelona. Good transport links from the hotel - airport transit stops less than 100yds away, metro/bus links are very useful. Our room was very modern, exceptionally clean - all in working order. Good sound-proofing. The only downside was that our room was stuffy (we stayed in January), so could imagine this being a problem in the Summer. We decided against the hotel breakfast - as this was too expensive compared to the nearby cafes / restaurants (good deli round the corner serving fresh pastries & coffee for under 2 EUR each). Free WiFi in the Hotel room & bar area was very useful. Roof terrace was great (pleasantly warm even in January!). Would definitely stay again.

<Title>“A perfect base from which to explore the city.”
<Content>A welcoming smile and complimentary upgrade on arrival; delicious and substantial buffet breakfast with lots of choice - better quality and value than anything else we saw in cafes around the hotel; central location but very quiet; luggage kept for us after we checked out but carried on sight-seeing; very helpful staff when we wanted to print-off flight details we had mislaid; everything was faultless.

<Title>“The best - in all means - hotel I have ever stayed!”
<Content>I am always sceptical to reviews of other travellers but I could not skip writing a review for this hotel. Because these kind of hotels are the ones I look for in trip advisor! Only 1 minute on foot from placa catalunya, its metro station and la rambla. Another metro station (Universitat) even closer that Catalunya, the bus from/to the airport 2 min. away, all busses and open touristic busses start 2 min. away. And just 5 minutes walking from the central shopping street passeig de gracia. Right next to El born where you can find all these cute little shops and cafes to eat. Buy the Barcelona card and you can have all the bus, metro free and discount of 10-25% to all museums, exhibits and many restaurants. Moreover, the room was the ideal room for 2 people who travel and need a cosy, clean, modern and stylish hotel to stay but not pay half their wage. With 85 euros per night (no breakfast included cause there are numerous cafes where you can have breakfast and watch barcelona right next to the hotel) we had a great great experience! They gave us a room at the last floor though we had the simple room booked. The staff was great, everyone very friendly, I am definitely suggesting this hotel to people who look for a good hotel in an excellent location that is value for money! I ve seen and paid at the past so many hotels that looked great and turned out bad that I am honestly suggesting this hotel. When returning to Barcelona I am going nowhere else! Plus free Wifi!

<Title>“good hotel in center of Barcelona”
<Content>We stayed here after cruise on Oceania. It's a great location, near the Plaza Catalunya & Las Ramblas, a wonderful pedestrian mall, but touristy. The plaza is the starting point for all the hop on/hop off bus tours, and there are many tapas bars nearby that provide excellent tapas & wine. Cellar de Tapas on Placa Universati was a good tapas bar we enjoyed first nite, just around corner from Hotel Jazz; also Cent Foc was a muy typico Catalonian restaurant, 1 1/2 blocks on other side of Hotel Jazz. The room was clean & comfy, hotel staff pleasant. Hotel itself very cosmo, drinks in bar nothing special. Mattress was comfy, wifi good. Hotel is on fairly quiet street off of Calle de Pelai-upper rooms better to avoid noise I think.

<Content>Excellent Location, within 15 min walk to La Ramblas, Casa Batllo, Casa Mila, Palau de la Musica. 30 secs walk to L1-Universitat Metro station. 7-10 mins walk to the Airport Bus Terminal (just outside of El Corte Ingles). Free Wi-Fi in room with strong signal. Super huge room with king-size bed, very comfortable. Very friendly and helpful staff. Best hotel for this 2-week trip (Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, and Lisbon) I would definitely stay here again when I come to Barcelona next time!

<Title>“Wonderful hotel!”
<Content>Spent a week here dec 2010-jan 2011 and absolutely enjoyed the stay at JAzz. The hotel is very cool, neat, chic and conveniently located. Loved the entrance to the hotel, as its off the main road, with its own alley, seemed grand n welcoming :). It looked like a very new hotel, all the fittings in the room seemed brand new. Spectacular room, with everything u need, comfortable and well laid out and designed. A cool jazzy bathroom too..totally recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in the centre of barcelona. the service at the reception ws also satifactory, they had recommendations for NYE n stuff.. All in all perfect!

<Title>“Amazing hotel- great price! Great city!”
<Content>Stayed with partner for 4 nights in April 2010. LOVE LOVE LOVE this hotel- rooms are good size, nice balcony/window overlooking the street which joins Las Ramblas, but not noisy at all with windows shut. Rooftop pool would be gorgeous in hot summer. A good distance from all major sites as its just of the top of the Ramblas, so you can walk down it to the beach or further North to the sites of the city- make sure you go to Park Guell! Amazing views and sculptures are worth the short hill walk. Cannot rate this hotel highly enough, when we went we paid only about £80 a night, I think it was a bit unknown and maybe quite new? though I now see thats its great reputation means it is a bit more at around £120 a night- i still think it is worth it! Will return when visiting Barca again!

<Title>“Best location, fantastic hotel, don't know why just a 3 star!!!”
<Content>This hotel has to be one of the best in Barcelona, especially for the money. It is located 2 blocks from Plaza Catalunya, with access to 3 or 4 subway lines, 50m walk from the drop off of the airport Aerobus and on a fantastic and vibrant street. It is a funky place, the rooms are great sized, modern and clean. The hotel breakfast was very good, but at 10 euros you can do better outside. Staff responded instantaneously to requests for towels, or a TV that was not working properly. Front desk staff, while very pleasant, don't really know where to send visitors. They simply just look it up on their computer - not the savvy concierge that you often meet - with the exception of Frederico, who did really know his stuff and worked very hard. WiFi works very well, but sometimes needed resetting at the front desk. In summer the rooftop pool must be wonderful. All in all, 100% recommendation for this hotel. It exceeded our expectations and was all that we could ask for.

<Title>“A very good hotel in a convient location and excellent Service”
<Content>The Jazz Hotel is a simple but very nice hotel in a convient location. It is very comfortable and clean with all the amenities we needed. The best things you may want to see in Barcelon are in walking distance and public transportation is easily accessible. I can't say enough about the service at the hotel. The airlines lost our luggage and they helped me at the front desk with the calls I needed to make in my efforts to contact the airlines and airport.

<Title>“Great hotel-highly recommend”
<Content>A great little hotel in the heart of Barcelona, near Plaza Catalunia, and yet quiet enough, not too hectic outside. People at reception extremely friendly, helpful, nice - very pleasant, relaxed and willing to assist with phone calls. Don't get breakfast at the hotel - too expensive - coffee is 5 euros! - but go to great coffee bar across the street -Jamaica bar, where coffee and croissant is 1.60 euros. Also, do consider the metro, which is also right outside, where trips - even with connections - are 1.40 euro for a single trip. a 15 minutes taxi ride can be about 15 euros. Great tapas restaurants on Ramblas - towards Majorca. Room is big enough, nice bathroom, lovely french windows to street, - ask for high floor since people stay out late on the weekend and some noise from street, not too bad at all. Certainly will be back.

<Content>I visited this hotel on business during November 2010. The location is great as it is just 5 minutes away from the famous Piazza where all the Tourist hub is. In the middle of everything and convenient for a vacation. The service is good, the rooms are very clean, free wifi internet is a bonus! and the staff at the desk are always with a smile. I arrived at 1am and needed urgent ironing for 7am in the morning. Altough there was no Housekeeping staff on duty since they start at 7am, they came at 6 am and by 6.50am my shirt was delivered. They go out of their way to help and assist. The breakfast is good and overall stay was super! well done. Just one thing, always ask for a high floor room.

<Content>I stayed at Hotel Jazz for 2 nights in mid December 2010. The hotel was very modern and everything in good order. Rooms are spacious and quiet, although I could hear the metro trains running through the night. I was allowed an early check-in as my flight arrived early. Rates were very reasonable, and the hotel is definitely in the upper bracket of most 3 star hotels.

<Content>As a special treat to my husband we visited Barcelona and stayed at Hotel Jazz. It was his first visit and my second. We are both in our seventies and ,love to visit cities. Hotel was easy to find and very convenient; weather warn and sunny. We used the bus from the airport and then a short walk to hotel. Decor and service excellent, breakfast plentiful; staff helpful. We look forward to going again. we stayed only 4 days and included a trip by train to Sitges where we found a very helpful tourist office and enjoyed our lunch looking at the sea.

<Title>“beware the early morning taxi scam”
<Content>We traveled to Barcelona with our daughter in October 2010 and chose to stay at the Hotel Jazz based on the great reviews on Tripadvisor. The hotel and location were fine. However, Saturday morning we checked-out to go to the airport. The desk-person "helpfully" called a cab for us. When we got to the airport, the cab driver demanded twice the metered fare, stating that the fares on the weekend were doubled. Amazingly enough, our daughter, who left for the airport a couple of hours later received the same story. I have contacted the hotel about this, but have received no response. The only possible explanation I can see is that the person at the front desk and the taxi driver he calls have a pretty good scam going for this to happen on 2 different cab rides the same morning. Of course, part of the blame is ours: this is one of the few times I have not asked about the fare amount prior to getting into the cab - so lesson learned!

<Title>“fantastic location - but so much more”
<Content>I recently returned from a 6-day trip in Barcelona, which I visited with my elderly mother. I had stayed there previously and chose it again because of the excellent location. Naturally, this was again extremely helpful, and provided easy access to the most visited parts of the city. Since my stay was longer this time, I was also able to appreciate how clean and quiet the room was. But I was most impressed by the desk staff. Every single person spoke English graciously and well. They were all very happy to answer all kinds of questions and never seemed rushed or annoyed. When I travel in Europe, I usually rent a flat, so this was by far my longest stay in a hotel. I was so pleased that it seemed like a real home for my mother and myself.

Nearby there were touristic buses and metro , many restaurants, FNAC, malls ( El Corte Inglez). The hotel is very modern, clean with big rooms well decorated and excellent staff and service. My son, five years old, loved the breakfast. There were free wi fi all over the place. We strongly recommend Jazz hotel for everyone that want to go to this wonderful city

<Title>“Excellent in all respects”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz Hotel for four nights. It was pretty near faultless and we would recommend it. We got the Aerobus from the airport to the hotel. It costs 5.05 euros, takes about 25 minutes, and it’s easy to know when you’ve arrived at your stop (Universitat). From the bus stop to the hotel is five minutes walk Among these reviews there have been some negative comments about the staff but we found them helpful and eager to please. It helps considerably that they all speak good English. We were on the fourth floor. The rooms was a good size and in a good state of repair, as was the bathroom. We had a window and balcony overlooking Carrer de Pelai which is a busy street but with the window closed there was no noise to disturb us. Throughout our stay we slept well, the beds were comfortable and the blackout curtains effective. The hotel is warm and we turned off the heating and didn’t get cold. Some reviewers have commented that you can hear the metro running under the hotel. That is true – particularly late in the evening and early in the morning – but it certainly wasn’t loud enough to be a problem. If you’re a light sleeper, I’d ask for the seventh floor because I doubt the noise reaches there. If we had one niggle it was that the bedroom doors do not keep out the noise in the corridor very effectively but this wasn’t a serious issue. One of the reasons we chose the hotel was the existence of the free wifi service which we took full advantage of. The connection was quick and dependable. Having a safe in the room was a real bonus and it just about took our laptop (15.6 inches screen). We looked in on the bar but never used it. And we never ate at the hotel. Each room has a fridge stocked with food and drink. We didn’t use that either but the prices looked reasonable for a hotel. We visited the roof terrace. There are plenty of sun loungers and umbrellas, shower facilities and a bar that opens in summer. The pool is about 8m by 4m and only about 1.5m deep. It was November and so no one was using it. Good views over Barcelona. Where this hotel really scores is its location. You are very close to many of the sights and a short walk from the stops for the Barcelona Tourist Bus. We took the Aerobus back to the airport from Placa de Catalunya (five minutes walk from the hotel). Different Aerobuses stop at different terminals so make sure you get on the right one. We got on theA2, were dropped at Terminal B only to find we wanted Terminal C (Easyjet), ten minutes walk away. Lucky we were in good time. All in all we had a great time and the Jazz Hotel certainly lived up to expectations.

Lovely modern hotel, very clean and a great location only a few 100 metres from la ramblas. I will definitely be my first choice on hotels in future visits to Barcelona. More like a 4 star than 3 star.

<Content>This small boutique hotel is in a great location with metro close by and walking distance to many attractions, restaurants, shops, etc.. I thought I saw on their website that the rooms were sound-proof but they are not. There are some ladies-of-the-night across the street working every night and you will hear some drunken fools hassling/negotiating. The shower head would not stay in place and sprayed water all over the bathroom wall so they had to send technician to fix it but the shower, although big in size, never worked out for me. I just showered in the tub/shower. Overall, it was ok for the value and location.

<Title>“Great hotel with excellent location”
<Content>We stayed here Oct 28-31 pre-cruise. The staff was very helpful and got us in early when we arrived at 10 a.m. The room was larger than expected and very clean, with a very nice tub/shower. We didn't have a chance to use the pool, but the terrace was very nice and I could see spending a lot of time here in the summer. We ate breakfast at the hotel once, and while it was good, it was overpriced compared to surrounding restaurants. The dinner was also good in a pinch. The location is excellent - close to all the action but a few blocks away to get some peace and quiet. Overall we would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Pleasant Surprise”
<Content>We were "bumped" from the Hotel Granvia (despite having confirmed reservations and notifying them of a late arrival - something about a national holiday), but they sent us to the Jazz, a member of the same hotel chain, and we couldn't have been more pleased. New, larger-than-average rooms, excellent shower (my personal yardstick of comfort) and helpful staff. We also considered it more convenient than the Granvia to the Metro & busses. Only minor negative is that they seem to be deferring maintenance (as evidenced by jerry-rigged plumbing fixtures in our particular bath) which could eventually begin to adversely affect an otherwise positive impression of an excellent hotel providing outstanding value.

<Title>“Great position”
<Content>The Hotel Jazz is very well positioned close to La Rambla, great restaurants and good shopping. Barcelona is a city where you will walk and walk and walk so finding a centrally located place to stay is fairly important. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a suite on our recent stay of 4 nights. The rooms were contemporary, big and very comfortable - especially the king sized bed. Bathroom included shower and bath. One thing that was lacking was an iron and ironing board. The hotel has an ironing service but no DIY arrangement. We were on a busy corner but experienced no noise from the street. The rooftop pool area has fabulous views of the city. I wish we'd visited at the beginning of our stay rather than at the end. I imagine it would be a good spot to plan the day's walk. Breakfast was good. Fresh fruit everyday along with the usual cereals and pastry offerings. Scrambled eggs and omelettes also on offer. Staff friendly and helpful - especially when credit cards needed to be cancelled because of a nimble fingered pick pocket. Really appreciated free internet access. Would certainly return.

<Content>Great location close to Placa Catalunya and top of La Ramblas, perfect for exploring the city. Metro station at the university only seconds away. Nice rooftop pool but not warm enough for a swim when we were there. Room larger than expected. Staff pleasant and efficient. We had one breakfast in the hotel and it was fine - reasonable selection of the usual buffet items. Only minor complaint - we could hear the rumble of the metro beneath our 2nd floor room but it didn't interfere with sleep.

<Title>“Very Nice Hotel - Central Location”
<Content>I was part of a group who stayed at the Hotel Jazz in Barcelona Spain prior to our cruise ship departure. I must say that we were all impressed. The hotel has an art deco design and the rooms are warm and inviting. The room we were given looked out into a courtyard. Nothing spectacular to see from that vantage point, but that was fine with us. Our room had a king sized bed, a couple chairs, a flat screen tv, a spacious closet, and a long desktop for working (if your stay is for business or if you want to write a few postcards). Our bathroom was larger than we expected and the bathtub was quite nice. There were two computers available to use - with free internet access - on the Mezzanine level of the hotel. The lobby, corridors, and the rooms were all clean and well maintained. There is a restaurant and bar inside the hotel. We visited the restaurant for breakfast prior to our departure. They had a large selection of breakfast items available to us. Everything we sampled was fresh and tasty. The entire staff at Hotel Jazz was friendly and courteous. The location of the hotel is just a few blocks walk away from La Rambla which makes this hotel a prime location for tourists. There are also dozens of restaurants and shops - with different price points - all within walking distance of the hotel. If you decide to stay at Hotel Jazz, you will not be disappointed. Be sure to take a stroll through the city. It's beautiful and the people are friendly!!

<Title>“Still good but not like before”
<Content>I just got back to the States from Spain and my 4th stay at Hotel Jazz in 2 years. I still recommend this hotel, primarily for location and value but I can definately say there has been some loss of quality in the past several years. (has even dropped in rankings on Trip Advisor) Rooms and baths are starting to look a little worn (but still very clean!). The bathroom furniture in both our rooms had water damage and the ceiling was peeling. The staff were cordial but not super friendly. Dont expect any favors like getting into your room early but sometimes it might happen. Housekeeping service was also very slow. My only complaint that has remained consistent throughout the years is the noise you can hear from hallways. Seems that soundproofing between rooms is good but you can hear any and everything going on out in the halls - fortunately people dont hang out in the halls very long. Still - I would probably give them another shot. Beds are very comfortable. FREE wi-fi that works well!! Just call front desk for an access code. Good value in off-season.

<Title>“Top value hotel”
<Content>Very modern, very clean and in a brilliant location, just a couple of minutes stroll from Plaza Catalunya and the Ramblas. Aerobus from the airport is a pleasure and stops just 50m from the hotel, for just €5 each. We were upgraded to a "junior suite", so had plenty of room - beds were comfortable, and bathroom good, although the shower cubicle a little cramped, but the shower itself was fine. Wouldn't use the bar (but that is what you go out for ....), although breakfast was very good. Reception staff were all very helpful.

<Title>“Never stay in this Hotel!!!”
<Content>I don't understand how could such a hotel be ranked number 9 on tripadvisor. I stayed at the Jazz with my husband after being in Barcelona for 6 days between the U232 and the hotels where we had a great stay. We thought being in the city center will offer a different experience and thought the high price of $250/night was justified. Unfortunately, it was the worst experience ever. Since we arrived to the Jazz, we felt that the staff was not friendly at all. I asked for help with the luggage and the doorman stood still and told me to get the luggage myself. The reception lady informed us that there is a problem with the system and we had to wait for the check in. We stayed in the lobby for 30 min and no one bothered to appologize or offer a cup of water. After checking in, we were disappointed by the relatively small rooms with the only view to the other rooms. It's as if staying inside 4 walls. It was so annoying and we had to keep the curtains closed all the time. The breakfast buffet seemed ok but the food was tasting detergent and there was no one to provide service to the clients. The ultimate was the metro station beneath the hotel... The sensation of vibration as well as the noise were unbearable. You can feel negativity and low level of customer service in every corner of the hotel. To add to our negative experience with the Jazz, our plane was scheduled at 6 am in the morning and we had to be in the airport at 4. Not being able initially to book an extra night, we asked the reception to try to find us any room to stay for couple of hours at night just to freshen up. Her answer was negative without providing any alternative in one of the other hotels in the same chain. So we checked out in the morning, left our luggage in the storage room and left the hotel to come back at 2:30 in the morning. We stayed in the lobby waiting and apparently, we slept while sitting for less than 10 minutes when the night shift manager came shouting and stating that this is not a place to sleep. My husband tried to explain to him that we're simply waiting for the taxi to come at 3:30 and that we were staying in this hotel and we don't accept to be treated that way. However, he kept on shouting and said it's not his problem. We left this weird place and decided to share our experience with eanyone who thinks of staying in this hotel.

<Title>“Great stop in barcelona”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel jazz in barcelona for one night pre-cruise and one night post-cruise. The hotel is in a good position, about 5 minutes walk away from Catalunya Square. The staff are really friendly and helpful and the hotel is modern, clean and comfortable. The breakfast is good, wide ranging with a selection of both hot and cold food. There is a guests bar with internet on the first floor. The only slight downside is that the rumble of the Metro can be heard. This may disturb a light sleeper. It would not deter me from a further visit.

<Title>“Gem of a small hotel,punches above its weight, highly recommended.”
<Content>Spanking clean everywhere, spacious room and well-equipped bathroom/shower/bidet in minimalist modern style, with every facility we had asked for, and wanted (safe, icebox, generous wardrobe with shelves and drawers, luggage rack, bedside reading lights,balcony,blackout curtains, hair-dryer,comfortable big twin beds.All the equipment was in first class condition and worked! Fresh pillow cases and towels every day and immaculate room cleaning. The breakfast is great if you like a "help yourself" variety of fresh fruits and dried fruits, juices, breads croissants, pastries,cereals, yoghurts,and small portions of ham, cheese, sausage, quiche. Location is down the street from Plaza Catalunya and the Aerobus stops nearby at the 3rd stop (University) as well as Plaza Catalunya. Rumble of the Metro is very slight even on the lower floors. Only criticism is that the bar is not manned at all times and lacked atmosphere, otherwise we received immediate attention at breakfast and at the desk and unfailing politeness and efficiency. Lovely little hotel, quiet at nights and convenient for everything. Would recommend it to anyone.

<Title>“Great Hotel in Barcelona”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Jazz in late September as the first stop in a two week trip in Spain. The hotel rooms were very clean, great shower / bathroom and comfy beds and pillows. The pool terrace has great views, however, it is not open to see the sunrise (we were not around much for sunsets). Reasonably priced and tasty breakfast. Also the hotel is in easy walking distance to most of the sites. We also found the hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>This was our last stop in a two-week jaunt around Spain and we went a bit further upscale to end the trip. Hotel Jazz was a great place, though I have to say we spent little time in the hotel as we were out and about the whole time. The location was great, walking distance to, well, a lot of great places to walk around. We did a lot of walking. Front desk staff were helpful and we had no problems. Only complaint, like the last post, was that the shower splashed all over the bathroom floor. Also, the bathroom door rubbed on the floor and wouldn't open all the way. All in all, minor complaints for a great place to stay in downtown Barcelona.

<Title>“Great Location, Great Service, Spacious”
<Content>We just returned after a 4 night stay at the Jazz and this place was superb. Very close to Placa Catalunya and Placa Universitat (closer station) this place served as a great base to explore the entire city. The beds are huge, and larger than they appear in the pics online. The room service is very good and the front desk very helpful. They also accommodated an early check-in and late check-out. The only critique I would have is the shower - the divider is not large enough and the water tends to splash out in the bathroom, which is not the largest. But to be honest, its a very clean and comfortable place. I would highly recommend this for people looking to spend most of their time outside the hotel.

<Title>“Great Hotel!”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel one night before a cruise. It was very spacious and had a great view. I liked that there was a large window that opened up so you could let in some fresh air. The location was pretty good and close to lots of stuff. You can hear the subway below even on the 6th floor but it isn't a hindrance to sleep. I would without a doubt recommend the hotel to a friend and I would stay there again. The room is very clean which is always a major plus!

<Title>“Its what it says on the tin 2”
<Content>I stayed here last September and reviewed the hotel then. This year I consider that the staff are even better, friendly and attentive. I saw a review criticising the fact that there were no duvets in the rooms. I think this because the rooms will heat up to be in excess of 30 degrees if you don't set the air conditioning or open the patio door. This is a great hotel in a superb location. I used the bus from the airport this year. Its third stop is universitat 50 metres from Hotel Jazz. The bus costs 5 euros and has ample space for large luggage. For 100 euros per night this has to be a great hotel, I have no hesitation in recomending it and will be booking for next year. it drops you

<Content>stayed for 2 nights on our first trip to Barcelona after reviews on TA found the hotel with little problem and agree its in a great location, hotel is newish modern and clean, although first room offered had 2 single beds put together so asked for a room with double bed but had to waity as none were ready. after all that it was still 2 singles but with sheet fitted over both so not much better but by this time we just wanted to rest and shower. Also room was quite basic but ok lack of full toiletries was dissapointing. after all its not a cheap hotel !!!. Also no duvet on the bed meant it could be cool at night. Overall it was a good place to stay for our first time but some of the little things could have made it better.

<Content>Totally recommend this Hotel. Location was fantastic. Just take the Airport Bus to the main square and it is a maximum 5 min easy walk away! Plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops on your doorstep! We didn´t have breakfast included and ate at cafes. There is one right accross road that does good coffee and rolls with ham. Plenty of pastry place around also. Lots of fun to stand at bar like a local, having coffee and bite to eat. Rooms were nice and modern. Wifi was great to have! Terrace area was fab and roomy. Pool lovely with nice views of city. Totally recommend a hotel with a pool in the summer heat. Funky lounge music played in pool area and fantastic mohitos at bar! Greta place to stay in Barcelona!

<Title>“Stylish, central and very good value”
<Content>I was pleasantly surprised to find this boutique hotel five minutes walk from the main square and the Ramblas, and near the bus stop for the airport bus into the centre. The rooms are spacious and cleverly designed, and although the hotel has no 'frills' it is right in the centre of one of the most vibrant cities. Breakfast is best taken in local cafes. The service is attentive and charming, and the staff at the front desk even kindly printed out a document for me as the two computers for the use of clients had no printer attached. There is free wifi throughout the hotel although the strength of signal was a little variable and therefore it was occasionally 'touch and go'. The pool on the roof is a bonus particularly in the summer months when Barcelona can get very hot, but being a trendy hotel, the piped music was off-putting and far too loud. Not conducive to a nap in the evening sun after a day of sightseeing. I will certainly use this hotel as a base on any return visit.

<Title>“Perfect hotel for exploring Barcelona!”
<Content>There can hardly be a better hotel in Barcelona with so much value for money as the Hotel Jazz! The hotel is perfectly located, with walking distance to the Rambla and all the main parts of the city, such as Barri Gottic and El Raval. There is also a metro stop right outside the hotel, which is practical when going to the beach or visiting sights out of walking distance. We really enjoyed the roof top terrace, that has a lovely pool, sunbeds with towels and a bar with soft music playing in the bacground. Lovely to relax up on the terrace a couple of hours after exploring Barcelona, before going out to dinner. There are so many great restautants in Barcelona, and we did quite a job with research in advance - which turned out to be very smart. We enjoyed lovely dinners at lovely restaurants all week, and never paid more than 50 Euros totally, including 2-3 courses, a bottle of wine and water. We booked the most of our restaurants in advance. We did not by the breakfast at the hotel, as this is quite expensive. For us Norwegians who are used to a pretty big breakfast, it is always bit of a challenge to find a healthy, big breakfast in countries is Southern Europe. But they have ok options at Starbuks 300 meters from the hotel (multigrain sandwiches etc), and also at the place just under the hotel. We would have bought the breakfast at the hotel if the price was a little better. 15 Euro per person is simply too expensive. The rooms are really nice, woth fresh, modern design. They are also very well cleanded, and our room had a bath tub with is nice. The only negative thing was that the bed was too hard, but no crisis for a week. We will return to Hotel Jazz, no doubts about that!

<Title>“Great Location, Great Price”
<Content>We stayed at hotel Jazz for 4 nights. It was such a nice hotel, very clean, great pool, very friendly and helpful. The only downside was the walls are so thin, being a light sleeper I was woken up many nights from guest coming home late. One night we were woken up by a leak in the bathroom from the room above us, we called the front desk (2:00 am) and within a few minutes someone was up to our room and offering us another room on another floor. They were very helpful and kind. The subway runs below the building and I could hear it and it would wake me up but my husband is a heavier sleeper and slept right through it. The location is great, only a few minute walk to La Rambla. Very close to the university too. Security is always in the front lobby and felt really safe here. You needed a room key to operate the elevator so no uninvited guests could come up. The rooms were very modern and clean. The bed was hard but comfortable. Room service was expensive but usually is we found local cafes around the street to grab morning coffee. Great hotel for the price!

<Content>My husband and I chose to spend the last two nights of our honeymoon at Hotel Jazz. We were thrilled with the location (right near the Universitat metro stop, at the end of Las Ramblas) and the hotel ambiance. The sun deck was lovely. Staff were polite and helpful. One downside is that, similar to the vast majority of hotels in Spain, the bed was two twin beds pushed together instead of an actual king sized mattress. Overall, great place.

<Title>“Great location and perfect for a city break - but lower floors may have too much metro rumble”
<Content>Firstly, what a fantastic location. Far enough away from Plaza Catalunya so that it is more relaxed but near every conceivable mode of public transport (Airport bus, metro, city buses). The pool served as a bonus where you can dip in and cool off when exploring the city becomes too hot. It does however become quite crowded as it is more of a dipping pool. The negatives would have to be the quite thinly walled rooms and also the rumble from the metro/underground. We were on the top floor (7th) facing the courtyard which meant traffic noise was non existent but the rumble from the metro was still audible. On the lower floors I am sure this could be quite intrusive.

<Content>We had 3 rooms at Hotel Jazz Sept 2 & 3, 2010. Even before we arrived at Hotel Jazz they were providing assistance to us. I had contacted them about Car Services while on board a cruise ship. They provided an excellent recommendation for the Car Service. Once we arrived at the hotel (well before the 3PM check in) they were ready for us with our rooms. They provided us with a map and easy directions for local sight seeing. We were very happy with the qualify of the 3 rooms, the price was well worth it, rooms were clean, comfortabble and a couple blocks from Las Ramblas. Everyone in our party was happy with this hotel and it's location.

<Content>Fab hotel, great location, lovely pool, gorgeous quiet, clean & modern and sound-proofed rooms. Only 2 minutes from Universitat metro stop, and only 5 mintues from Placa Catalunya metro stop (and airport shuttle bus stop too). Lovely pool and friendly, helpful staff. A drink at the pool won't cost you the earth either. Hotel is on a street with nice shops (Zara, Sephora, Massimu Duti, Mango, Women's Secret, numerous shoe shops, Starbucks) and at the end of the street (at Placa Catalunya) is Cafe Zurich - a good place to start your day with a coffee and snack and watch world go by....Would highly recommend Hotel Jazz and would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“PERFECT CITY BREAK HOTEL”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel for two nights , but wish it had been longer . It is perfectly placed , very central , a five minutes walk to the Ramblas and the main square , where all the buses can be found . Its a 10 minute ride from the airport by public bus , which stop outside the doors of the airport and about six stops later , the hotel ,the stop is two minutes away from hotel so dont bother with taxis . The hotel is just behind the main square but tucked up a small side street so is central but quiet . Check in was swift and professional and our room was just perfect , Boutique style , practical and clean . We didnt bother with breakfast which to us seemed overpriced , so we popped across the road to the little cafe , authentic , cheap and a lovely atmosphere . We did venture up to look at the roof top pool , which was small but perfectly formed and fantastic views across the city ,a little oasis in a busy city . I would stay here again without doubt , it was safe , friendly and was that perfect special treat breakaway with my husband without the kids . Barcelona is a fabulous city , cant wait to return and this hotel would be my first choice again .

<Content>this is a fantastic hotel to stay in within walking distance of plaza catalunya and the ramblas. The facilties are outstanding, rooftop swimming pool, free internet, extended breakfast hours and large buffet selection. What really made our stay perfect though was the outstanding customer service we receieved from all the staff there. Everyone spoke perfect english and they all went above and beyond in explaining to us how to get to places, how to work things, when I had a problem with my safe in my room at midnight, someone came up to the 7th floor in under 10 minutes, truly great service. i stayed with my wife and 3 year old daughter, its a childproof place as well! highly recommended!!

<Title>“Exactly what TripAdvisor reviews led us to expect”
<Content>We stayed 4 nights at Hotel Jazz prior to a Mediterranean Cruise and then one night post-cruise as well. Pre-cruise we were on the 6th floor in adjoining rooms and post-cruise on 7th floor down the hall from each other. Both times we found the rooms to be spotlessly clean, nicely sized, with the terrific "amenities kit" in the bathroom (best ones I've seen in any hotel, anywhere). Front desk staff are professional and helpful and attend to all requests quickly. Fantastic location, walking distance to many of Barcelona's sites and good restaurants and shopping. Roof top pool is relatively small and was busy in afternoons/evenings but a very welcome cooling-off spot after a day of walking and sight seeing, with a good bar. Breakfast is convenient and tasty and enough selections to satisfy anyone I would think. I did find the restaurant/breakfast staff to be a mixed bag in terms of friendliness and professionalism. Some very good, others so-so. Our last morning there was a server we had not seen before, who insisted only a plain omelette could be made and who did not remove used plates from any table until the occupants of the table left the restaurant. In some cases that meant large stacks of dirty plates on an occupied table and this was incomprehensible to me. I did argue that I'd enjoyed a cheese omelette every morning for 4 days only a week earlier and insisted that he ask the kitchen to make one for me, which they did. No idea why he put up such a fuss about it; his attitude bordered on rude, he seemed very unwilling to accommodate even the smallest request, and although he passed our table many times during our 30 minute stay he did not remove a single used plate from our table or any other. Weird. Nonetheless, that is a very small point in the scheme of things. The Hotel Jazz represents a fantastic value given the room size, cleanliness, style, and location. It's a gem and I would not hesitate to recommend or return again myself.

<Title>“Adorable, centrally located boutique hotel”
<Content>This hotel is conveniently located for Metro and not far from Placa Catalunya. It is clean, new, and comfortable. My room had a little balcony that overlooked one of the quaint streets it borders. Hotel Jazz is nicer than many of the smaller hotels - more toiletries in the bathroom, better pillows/bedding. It was easy to get around Barcelona from the hotel and I felt safe coming and going. There was a minibar in the room and a convenience store a block away. I didn't use most of the amenities, so am not familiar with them. My biggest complaint about hotels in Spain is that there is no way to completely lock out the staff (no deadbolts, sliders or chains) so I have been taken by surprise a couple times - be sure to use the Do Not Disturb sign and put it up as soon as you enter the room. I also put a chair in front of the door so I at least get a warning. Also, because your room key turns on the electricity in the room, it is necessary to have a battery powered clock (or use your mobile phone), because everything turns off when you leave the room and take your key out of the slot.

<Title>“Very Good value”
<Content>Like most of the other reviewers, we could find very little to fault the Hotel Jazz. We requested a room as high as possible (5th floor) and barely heard the metro trains! The breakfast was good value and the staff very helpful without being intrusive. As expected, the air temperature was quite high so we made good use of the rooftop pool and bar. We were also very aware of the security problems in the city and heeded the advice given on the Trip Advisor Barcelona forum. Dont let this put you off coming to Barcelona, it is a great city to visit....just be careful and take sensible precautions as you would in any other big city around the world.

<Title>“ticked all the right boxes”
<Content>Just back from a wonderful trip to Barcelona, stayed at the Hotel Jazz which ticked all the right boxes: friendly and attentive staff (especially on the rooftop terrace), clean and well proportioned chic bedroom and bathroom (great shower), fantastic location, close to all the excitement but in a peaceful spot. After a days sightseeing (and sights are in abundance in BCN) it was great to have a dip in the pool then relax with a glass or two of cava watching the setting sun before heading out again for food and entertainment. Divinus, a restaurant very near Hotel Jazz, offers traditional food at a good price. The skate boarders at Placa Universitat provide free entertainment and Jazz Si in Barri Raval is an interesting nightspot.

<Content>Very cool room in a terrific location. Walking distance to attractions, restaurants, and lots of neat places to discover. The hotel is in a safe area (we never felt concerned, even in the wee hours of the morning). Staff are very nice and accommodating. Prices are extremely reasonable. Did I mention how cool the rooms are?

<Title>“All that's been said and more...”
<Content>It's already been said about the cleanliness, stellar location, and good service. I would like to expound on the good service part. I needed help trying to figure out how to get an event ticket printed (that I had booked pre-trip), and the man behind the desk actually walked me to the right place, about 2 blocks away! He was so friendly, and went above and beyond. It is so appreciated!

<Title>“Disappointment at Jazz”
<Content>When first checked in we were excited about the room until we noticed the sewer smell . The drain in the shower was blocked and we thought that this could have been the source of the smell . The blockage was quickly fixed by the hotel maintenance but the odour was still present . It was worse when the windows were opened. After 1 night we couldn't tolerate it anymore so we asked for a room change. We were give an equivalent room on another floor. The smell was still present but much less so. This room was not as clean with stains on the furniture, carpet and sheets. The Jazz is well located on a busy section of Barcelona and close to everything for tourism but I think that there are better choices for a stay in his beautiful city.

<Title>“Supurb hotel, clean, tidy and central”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel over New Year at which time I only used trip advisor for checking on the places I was staying, now I feel I should also add my comments for my fellow travellers. This vist was part business and leisure, a little business coupled with a break. This was our third stay at the hotel in the last year. The Hotel Jazz is extremely clean the rooms are very well appointed, modern and bright. It is very convenient for the City centre and shops - ideal for my wife! Whilst vcentral there is little traffic noise that one would associate with a City centre. I have no hesiatation in recommending Hotel Jazz for business or pleasure breaks. There are some first class bars and restauarnts nearby, try the frankfurter restauarant (bizarre but good), the best find for us was left out of hotel,across the street, down the lane and turn right and about 300m up on the left is a small gem of a restaurant, looks more like a small cafe with about 10 tables but first class food and service - sorry I do not recall the name (it is a number). Our stay this time was short, Barcelona is a beautiful City and well worth visiting we intend to return to see what we missed and we willstay at the Jazz

<Content>The hotel lived up to it's expectation. Location about 4 blocks from Plaza Cataluya close to everything Paseo Garcia, Rambla, etc. Hotel size standard european ,clean and quite. You will hear the metro but not disturbing like any other big city with train systems. Just remember, you are in holidays not to live in hotel room. Free wi-fi ask for code when checking in. Starbucks 1 block & lots of cafe shops next to hotel. Very enjoyable stay. Definite will go back.

Jazz is located very central. Can catch the bus from the airport and it's a short walk to the hotel. 5min walk to the shopping area at Sol. I would strongly recommend this place!

<Content>We first came across Hotel Jazz when we were staying in a nearby hotel and we were allowed to use Hotel Jazz's pool. Then we were hooked! The hotel is in a very good location, just far enough away from Las Ramblas not to be disturbed by late night revellers but close enough if that is your thing! The staff were all friendly and very helpful, the rooms spacious , modern, bright and immaculately clean.

<Title>“Great stay in central location”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Hotel Jazz for seven nights with my 15 year old teenage son. We found the hotel easy to find from Placa de Catalunya which is where the Aerobus drops you off (10 minute walk). The staff are friendly and all speak English, room service which I used twice was prompt (15 mins) and yummy food. Having the sun roof with small swimming pool, with the breeze across the rooftops from the sea with views was was a bonus, especially in August after walking your feet off! There was also a bar serving drinks and food all day if needed. The room was cleaned and toiletries/towells replaced every day and having air con and a TV (Action+ channel showing back to back films in English for the teenager) came in very handy. Barcelona is a great and vibrant city, lots to see and do. I would recommend going on the Las Glonondrinas boat drip (90 minutes trip) out of the marina and along the coast, as well as doing the red and blue bus trips (you don't need to do the green tour as you cover it on the boat trip). You can purchase tickets and get on the bus tours from Placa de Catalunya. We found the Starbucks handy to pop in to (5 mins from the hotel) for a refreshing frappachino (the staff are very friendly), or there is another on Las Ramblas, near to a Carrefour supermarket to purchase small bottles of water for next to nothing to put in the hotel room fridge! Don't forget the indoor food market half-way down Las Ramblas to see the fish, meat, fruit delights, and there is a health bar for smoothie drinks and amazing salads. If you fancy a special Oriental meal, I recommend La Xina on Pintor Fortuny, just off Las Ramblas (on the corner of Hotel Jazzs' sistere hotel 1898. There are also other nice restaurants to choose from on this street including an organic cafe. Try and go off the beaten track and explore the Old Town (Bari Gotic) off Las Ramblas on both sides as there are some great little one off shops and eateries. Also, it's a 5 min walk to the MACBA (Museu D'Art Contemporani De Barcelona - a must. Enjoy.

<Title>“Couldn't ask for a better hotel for a honeymoon!”
<Content>First, the location .... right in the center of Barcelona. Its only two blocks from the Plaza Catalunya. The airport buses have two different stops, both within three blocks from the hotel; so don't pay outrages taxi prices, catch the A1 bus from the airport for only 8.75 euro round trip, and you'll be dropped off almost at the doorstep. We had asked to be given a room when we arrived which we knew would be early in the morning, flying from the states. While they said they couldn't guarantee a room when we arrived (check in is at 3 pm), we arrived at 9:30 and they had a room already for us. The rooms are a nice size for the typical european hotel room. Plenty of room to spread the luggage out around the room, a desk for your laptop, free wifi anywhere in the hotel, and two twin beds pushed together to form a king. The room had a door to a small window overlook, which was enjoyable to leave open in the evenings to allow the breeze in. There is a nice roof-top rotunda, full with a bar that stays open until midnight, and a pool. You can see a majority of the city from the top, and it provides a great place to unwind after walking around the city during the day. We only had two complaints all week long. First, the breakfast food is not the best. We ate at the hotel breakfast buffet the first day - and while it provided plenty of food, it wasn't the best breakfast I've eaten at a hotel. The second day, we had the continental breakfast delivered to the room. Again, it was nice, provided plenty of food, but wasn't the best. Also, both days the price was about 10 euro per person. So, you pay for quantity, not quality. I recommend skipping the hotel breakfast and go find yourself a pasteria or some other local shop if you're a person who's hungry in the morning. Along with the food issue, while there is room service and a restaurant on the premises, there isn't a lot of great food to provide a mid-afternoon snack. The have some sandwiches if you're looking for a light lunch - but it is lacking. The second complaint - and it's not really a complaint - is that the hotel sits on top of a metro stop. So, if you can't ignore noises around you, this might bug you. You can hear, and slightly feel the rumbling of the metro every time is passes underneath. In many ways, this was the only reason we could see why the hotel is only rated with three stars. The best part was the price. For this location and this wonderful of a hotel, you might easily be asked to pay 150-300 euros a night. When we checked out, the price was even cheaper than when I had booked online - less than 90 euros a night. What a deal! Save yourself the time you could spend looking elsewhere and stay at the Hotel Jazz - you won't be disappointed!

Excellent location 10 mins from Catalynuna square and Las Ramblas but down a quiet side street. Rooms a good size and lots of ammenities. Air con a plus. Superb roof top swimming pool so you can see the whole of barcelona with a sensibly priced bar. Would highly reccomend.

<Title>“Perfection.”
<Content>Just back from a wonderful stay at Hotel Jazz. Location - Just across from Placa Universitat and a block away from Placa de Catalunya. The Aerobus from the airport drops you to practically outside the hotel, we never once had to use the metro or a taxi to get anywhere, walking distance to all our destinations. Cleanliness - Our room was spotless, fresh and clean. The cleaners do a fabulous job, it was like we were the first people ever to be in our room! Sleep Quality - Slept soundly with no noise complaints whatsoever (on 6th floor) Value - Just over 100 euro per night, unbeatable for what we had. We are already booking our return to this Hotel.

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel!!”
<Content>This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. It is a 5 minute walk from La Ramblas, bus stops and underground stations are close by and it is located right in the center of everything. The hotel looks brand new and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We stayed in a triple room. Triple rooms are corner rooms and are big like suites. We were extremely comfortable, plenty of space and cable TV as well. The bed was so comfortable!! The bathroom was also huge and spotless. Room service was excellent. Overall, excellent value for money. And the pool on the roof was a definite plus! A final note: the noise from the underground trains mentioned in other reviews was not an issue for us at all, we barely heard it. Will definitely stay there again next time I am in Barcelona!

<Content>Stayed at Hotel Jazz for three days before going on a cruise from Barcelona. When we arrived in Barcelona, my carry-on was stolen (be VERY careful in Barcelona, there were six others at the U.S. consulate when I applied for a temporary passport to replace the one that was stolen!). Needless to say I was quite upset by the time I arrived at the hotel. The front desk was quite helpful in getting me the credit card company numbers to call, the consulate phone number, etc. The rooms here are contemporary and spacious. The hotel is located within a few blocks of the top of La Rambla, but without all the noise and traffic. Would definitely recommend to others.

<Title>“Amazing stay – why stay elsewhere?”
<Content>The room: we paid €102 for room 712 and we were not disappointed. We had a very large and spacious room with king size bed (oh so nice), desk area, arm chair, safe, huge closet. The bathroom was also huge and decorated with much style and flair. Free WiFi too. The hotel: we felt like we stayed in a five star hotel with its modern look, amazing rooftop pool and bar and overall feel. The hotel is really affordable, with cocktails at the pool bar for €8 and onsite parking at €22 per day. The service: all staff were friendly and professional and spoke good English. Only once we got a bit of a cold shoulder, but the guy at the bar was closing up and I guess he wanted to go home. The location: just perfect! The metro stop was about 50m away. Barcelona is safe, don’t believe what you hear from others. We walked at night and never felt threatened. It’s a 3 minute walk to the top of La Rambla (the main street) and there are plenty of restaurants nearby. The conclusion: amazing stay – why stay elsewhere?

<Content>The hotel is very well located in the city and close to the metro stations for getting around. It is a contempory hotel with nice furnishings.We stayed in a twin room and the beds were of a good size as was the room. The main draw for me for this hotel is the roof top pool. On the 8th floor the pool is surrounded by approx 20 sun loungers,(busy after 3pm) plenty of towels available .There is also a terrace and bar with lots of chairs and tables and a handful of comfy sofas all with umbrellas. The staff were very pleasant and we had no problems whatsover. Highly reccomended

<Title>“Location, location, location”
<Content>Based on trip advisor reviews, we stayed here for 3 nights in July, and couldn't have asked for a better location in the city. As many have already said, the location for the money can't be better. We asked for a room on the upper floors, and we were accomodated with a room on the 7th floor; I didn't hear the metro once while we were in our room, but my husband did slightly. Some minor things that weren't mentioned in previous reviews that we found helpful: GETTING THERE: From the airport, take the blue A1 airport bus, and get off a Plaza Universitat (cost 5.05 Euro per person). The hotel is less than a minute walk from the square. When getting off the bus, walk in the same direction as the bus was traveling, and cross the street. The hotel entrance is located behind the white building that is located on the corner of the triangular shaped block. While standing in the square, you can see the red facade of the hotel behind the white building, so you'll know in which direction to walk. TOILETRIES: Although there was a good assortment of toilietries in the room, missing were hand lotion and conditioner -- better bring your own. POOL SCENE: It was wonderful to come back to the hotel after a very long and hot day of sightseeing to spend some time in the very warm rooftop pool. Not great for swimming (only 1 meter deep), but perfect for soaking. This seems to be a popular place to congretate during the summer, and were dissapointed to find that when we returned to the hotel on our last day at about 5:00 pm, the pool was full, and there was not a seat to be had. This was a Friday, and I suspect that this is the norm on summer weekends. The weekdays were much less crowded. Also, about every 1/2 hour, a machine on the rooftop makes the noise of a screeching bird -- I suppose to keep some sort of nuisance bird away -- but this could be rather annoying while trying to relax poolside. PICKPOCKETING: We read extensively prior to leaving about all the pickpocketing in Barcelona. Before our trip, we were almost in a state of paranoia about what we might find -- we purchased a money belt, a backpack that has access from only against your back, etc. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the pickpocketing issue was over stated. Yes, you are in a big city, so you must be aware of your surroundings, but we found it no different than being in New York at home. Be cautious, but don't be deterred. FREE WI-FI: Free wi-fi worked from our room on our own laptop with a passcode that we got from the front desk - very helpful! Overall, a very good stay, and would recommend Hotel Jazz.

<Title>“The Perfect Location in Barcelona!”
<Content>Our recent stay at the Hotel Jazz was wonderful. The hotel is located near the main pedestrian street, Ramblas, and very close to at least three major Metro staions. So either walking or taking the train to get around Barcelona is a breeze. The front desk staff could not have been nicer or more helpful, which we really appreciated. The room and hotel overall is high style (though a tad worn in some places) and the rooftop pool, sundeck and bar are a total bonus! A beautiful buffet breakfast is served every morning, which was included in our rate. It was so bountiful that we never even ate lunch. This hotel is GREAT value for the money. We highly recommmend this hotel and would gladly stay here again when we return to Barcelona, which we hope is soon. What a fantastic city!

<Title>“Beautiful room, fantastic rooftop”
<Content>We reserved through the hotel website. We had requested early check in and a suite, which unfortunately wasn't ready when we arrived mid mornong from the airport. The first receptionist said they would hold our bags and to come back in 5 hours at 3 pm, regular check in time. She had very little sympathy for our need for a shower and a bed, she said there was nothing she could do for us.Not the welcome to Spain I was hoping for. Luckily Daniel returned to the desk and came to our rescue. He gave us the code for the internet so we could use our netbook to check in with home. We then asked him for directions to go eat. He gave us those and a map and said not to worry, come back in about an hour and we should have a room. He was correct.and Daniel was so helpful with whatever we needed throughout our stay. The suite was very spacious. We were on the third floor, a corner room with floor to ceiling windows. There were very good blackout curtains on the windows. The windows also opened so you could have fresh air if you wanted. The room definitely rumbled from the metro but it didn't bother us. We never felt it on the roof so if you're concerned maybe ask for a higher floor. The air conditioning in the room was wonderful. Even though you took your key from the light switch when you left the room the air stayed on so you retuned to a cool room. The bathroom had a tub and a shower stall and plenty of counter space. There was a small flat screen tv facing the bed and a couch and chairs and a table. The lighting was good and there were convenient electric outlets. Housekeeping was very efficient and did a great job. The wifi worked great throughout the hotel, only place we couldn't get a signal was the rooftop. The rooftop was amazing. Great views, lots of tables and chairs, a nice bar that served good sangria and had a small food menu. Very helpful bartenders. The pool was small, but had a very nice area for lounge chairs. There were a few days where we chose to have breakfast at the hotel. It was less than 11 euros per person and they had a large array of pastry and juices. There was bread and a few hot items. They would make an omelet if you asked. They brought coffee or tea to the table. The location is very good, a few minutes to Placa Catalunya and between 2 metro stops. It can be a little hard to find though, as the entrance doesn't face the street. There are many cafes nearby and Scobies, and Irish bar, is literally steps around the corner. Great owners and bartenders there as well.

<Title>“A FANTASTIC birthday trip in Barcelona”
<Content>Just got back from 4 days at Hotel Jazz and felt the need to tell everyone that the reviews I read before booking were true and what a FANTASTIC place the hotel and location were. We had a spacious 6th floor room looking out on the street. Noise was minimal only a slight rumble from the Metro, but hey when you’re from the country like us you notice any noises so none of it was a problem. All the staff were very helpful and the wifi was good on both BlackBerry and Netbook. After the first day missing breakfast and eating in the city we had breakfast every other day and value for money 10 Euro was good. The cream on the cake was being able to slip in to the roof top pool after a day of sightseeing. To watch the sun set sipping a drink after having a dip in the pool recharged the battery ready for the nightlife of the city. A VERY SPECIAL 50th BIRTHDAY TREAT.

<Title>“A great choice”
<Content>This was a great place for our four days in Barcelona. The location was good- near the main tourist areas without being so close as to be loud and crowded. The room was very modern and comfortable. Friendly staff. Nice rooftop bar/pool area to unwind at at the end of a day of sightseeing.

<Title>“The bad and the good”
<Content>There were definitely some good and bad points. Bad: I guess I am picky or an old stick in the mud, but I did not like the half door on the shower - allowed the floor to get wet. I am cold natured and the sheets on the bed were no thicker than a kleenex. The room thermostat, for someone just visiting, was very complex and hard to understand. The hotel was hard to find. The rooms were definitely not sound proof - thankfully the road in front of my room was rather quiet. Good: Design was very stylish and modern. It definitely had a flare. The room was a nice size compared to some other Euro hotels I have stayed in. The bad point about being hard to find led me to probably the best area of this hotel - the helpful staff. I called the hotel trying to find its location - I was very confused, not ever having been in Barcelona before. The person at the front desk told me to stand at a certain location and he would find me. I went where he told me to go - he left the hotel, came to find me, and walked me to the hotel. I thought that was a very nice thing to do.

<Title>“A great find in Barcelona, especially in summer.”
<Content>We just returned from 4 nights at the Jazz with our 2 teens. We found the hotel through Tripadvisor and the reviews were right on. We totally agree, a 3 star hotel that feels like a 4 star. We all enjoyed the Jazz more than our immediately preceding 5 star hotel in Madrid. The hotel is clean and modern, in an excellent central location for both walking and the metro. We paid extra for the breakfast package, and had an ample and excellent breakfast buffet each morning. The rooftop pool and bar where just ideal to come back to in the late afternoon after a hot day of sightseeing. You can't beat a sangria or cerveza at the rooftop pool. They even serve light food, all fairly reasonably priced. Yes, if you listen, you can hear and feel the faint rumble of the subway deep below the hotel. But that is white noise, especially compared to the overall noise and craziness of this vibrant city, including loud music into the night on weekends from nearby Placa Catalunya and Universitat. Probably not much quieter anywhere else, and certainly quieter than staying on Las Ramblas. Highly recommend.

<Title>“Hotel Jazz was the fantastic - exceeded expectations”
<Content>Hotel Jazz had been recommended to us by friends who stayed before and we are thrilled to have stayed there. The location is perfect - close enough to walk to La Rambla, Barri Gotic, Eixample, etc. It's on a little triangle street which keeps the rooms quiet at night. The rooms are modern and spacious and the rate of 94 € was totally reasonable.

<Title>“Loved it!”
<Content>Perfect location - nice staff, comfortable rooms and gorgeous roof top pool (too cold for us to use but still nice to see!). I'd definatley go back!!! Despite being in the city centre it is very quiet and ariy... My only advice would be to stay on the highest floor as possible as the tram line is under the hotel... you can sometimes hear it when it's quiet.

<Title>“Fantastic value and location”
<Content>Stayed for one night on Thursday, 1 July 2010. I always stay in this area as it is very central. The prices have been rising rapidly in the last 15 years since my first visit and I was therefore somewhat sceptical about a 3* hotel only charging £90. However I was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel is very good value and the staff excellent. The roof top pool was a great bonus. All in all I can only recommend it to anyone. My wife and I will probably stay here when we return with the kids later in the year.

<Title>“This hotel is a little pleasure...”
<Content>Based on these reviews we booked direct with the hotel for a 1 night stay and from booking to departure the Hotel Jazz lived up to all the great comments. We arrived a little before 11am but our room was ready which allowed us to quickly refresh before exploring the sights. As many others have already commented, this is a fantastic hotel for being right in the mix of the Barca sights. Tourist buses, La Rambla and Metro are all within a few mins walking distance. The room was clean and has everything you require. Although we didn’t make use of it the hotel Pool and rooftop bar they had great views. I would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to visit the great city of Barcelona.

<Title>“Lovely hotel, would definitely return”
<Content>It's taken a long time to get round to writing a review on Hotel Jazz but I felt I should as it was such a great hotel. We stayed at the hotel for a long weekend and had timed it to coincide with the Tour De France going through Barcelona. Our first thoughts on arrival at the hotel were how clean and modern it was inside. The check-in was fast and we were in our room before we knew it. I had emailed the hotel prior to our visit asking for a high up quiet room and I was really pleased to see that was exactly what we were given. We were on the top floor below the roof terrace (where the pool was situated) and even had a small balcony which although not big enough to sit on, was lovely to stand on and admire the view. The room itself was spacious and was very modern, clean and nicely furnished. The bathroom was lovely with a nice big bath and shower. Although we looked out over a busy street, we did not hear any noise at all from outside or from other rooms within the hotel. There was the occasional distant rumble from a metro train going underneath the hotel but we didn't mind that at all as it was very faint. Our rate was for room only so we didn't eat at the hotel. We did use the roof top bar though on a couple of occasions and this was lovely. There were plenty of comfy chairs/sofas to sit on and also the added bonus of the swimming pool on the other side away from the bar. The views from the roof top were brilliant and far reaching. The hotel was in the best location right in the centre of Barcelona. We were less than five minutes walk from Las Ramblas and Placa de Catalunya and a two minute walk from the nearest metro stop (Universtat I think it was). There were also loads of places to eat all around the hotel so it was a perfect base. We would definitely go back to Hotel Jazz again and in fact I recommend it to anyone I know who visits Barcelona (a friend has stayed there since and she loved it aswell). It was a lovely hotel in a perfect location. One last thing I would say, and I'm sure you've heard this many times before, is to watch out for your handbags/wallets. We were on our way to Camp Nou and as we were exiting the metro station on the upwards escalator I felt something on my bag (which was a cross the body one which was zipped up but had a flap covering the zipped bit). I realised it was the hand of the man behind me (who's friend was conveniently covering him with a large tourist map). He had his hand under the flap of my bag and was obviously feeling for the zip. I slapped my hand down on my bag and he pulled away then tried to look all innocent when I turned round to confront him. He and his friend then jumped off the escalator and walked away. I was so angry but realised that it could have been much worse for me had my bag not been zipped up. Just keep a hand on your bag/wallet/camera etc when in busy areas such as metro stations or busy streets.

<Title>“Enjoyed Our Stay at Hotel Jazz”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Jazz based on a recommendation from my travel agent, and we were not disappointed. We were in Barcelona for 2 nights pre-cruise, then 1 more night post-cruise, and enjoyed Hotel Jazz both times. We arrived before the normal check-in time, and both times we were allowed to stow our luggage until our rooms were ready. The front desk staff were very friendly and accommodating, giving us instructions on taxi and bus service, as well as restaurant recommendations. The hotel has a minimalist modern feel, with wood floors throughout, and the rooms are large, with a refrigerator, free internet service, extra wide bed, desk, tv, and small balcony overlooking the busy city streets. I did notice a constant rumbling from the underground subway, and a little noise from the street, but it was not too distracting and we were able to sleep comfortably. There was some loud shouting in the streets one night after a World Cup game, but it didn't last too long. The breakfast buffet is outstanding, and the service staff is very helpful. The rooftop pool and bar were very nice too. The hotel is conveniently located to the cruise port, airport, Las Ramblas, and other Barcelona sights. We highly recommend the Barcelona City Bike Tour with Fat Tire Bike Tours, and a visit to Park Guell. We only wish we could have stayed another day!

<Content>Great location. Convenient to public transportation including airport bus. Beautiful rooftop pool and bar. Simple but stylish design. We were on 7th floor; could hear/feel subway (sounded like distant thunder), but were not at all bothered by it. Room wasn't cleaned while we were out all day. We reported this, and the room was then cleaned while we were out for dinner.

<Title>“Yes the reviews are true - it's terrific!”
<Content>Just returned from a 6 night stay. Great location - metro stop, Placa Catalunya a block away, restaurants, anything you could need within a block! Hotel and rooms are very clean and modern, large bed for a European hotel, great bathroom. Staff are friendly and helpful, free wifi in your room (get passcode from front desk), were able to take advantage of roof top pool every day after sightseeing! Yes you could hear the subway rumble but we were on the 7th floor so it wasn't too bad, noise from the street could be disturbing to some but hey you're in Barcelona! Took advantage of the breakfast buffet, nice selection, can request scrambled eggs or omelettes, pastries, fruit, juice, etc. a good and convenient way to start your touring day and was reduced to 10.70 euros per person. Great hotel, yes we were Jazzed! With its reasonable rates, I would definitely recommend this hotel - and it's the first hotel that the rooms look exactly like the hotel photos!

<Title>“Loved this hotel!”
<Content>We recently returned from a Med cruise that began in Barcelona. Stayed 3 days precruise and loved this hotel. Location was great and easy to walk to the Rambla and other nearby sites. We stayed in other hotels during the trip (Venice and London) and as in most European hotels where the rooms are small to begin with, found this room appeared to either be or feel larger as far as the ability to navigate around with all our luggage. Metro very near and yes, one can hear/feel it's rumble but it never affected our ability to fall asleep after a long day of touring which may just be from being so exhausted from the day's activities or since we were on the 7th floor and it wasn't as loud up there. I'd definitely stay here again!

<Content>Stayed at this hotel pre-cruise for two nights; rest of the group was there for three nights. We were on the 4th floor, so we did not encounter the noise the rest of our group did who were on the 2nd floor. Noise was from the Metro trains. Very clean, nice room. Great bathroom ammenities. Front desk personnel were all very nice. Free computer access on 1st floor - never could get my WiFi to work. Close to Las Ramblas, Metro, restaurants (including Starbucks) and the Market.

<Title>“Very pleasant stay at Hotel Jazz!”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Jazz for 4 nights while visiting Barcelona. I had done a thorough search for hotels near Las Ramblas and many people had recommended this hotel, so I took a chance and booked it. I was very happy that I did because we had a terrific stay at this hotel! It is in a great location within close proximity to most everything you'd want to see in Barcelona. The decor in the hotel is very modern, the front desk staff is very friendly, and the rooms are extremely clean (my main concern when staying at a hotel). They have a business center, a nice bar/restaurant, and a really nice pool and sitting area up on the roof. We spent every night sharing a bottle of wine on the rooftop -- it was great! I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona - can't beat it!

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel!”
<Content>SPAIN, BARCELONA - Hotel Jazz My husband and I visited Barcelona July 2009 and stayed at the Hotel Jazz. The hotel was everything we were looking for and more! A couple of the hotel highlights: * Location was excellent. The hotel is located right between Barri Gotic (old Barcelona) and Eixample (new Barcelona). The metro, airport bus and tourist information center were right around the corner (at Place de Catalunya) and many of the tourist spots and restaurants were within walking distance (think Barcelona Cathedral, La Boqueria, Palau de la Musica Catalana, La Pedrera, Casa Batllo). If you are an ambitious walker, even Port Vell and Barceloneta are walkable (although we metro'd it back!). * Rooms (and bathrooms) were modern, clean, spacious and comfortable (see pictures). Given past reviews we requested to have a room on a higher floor to avoid any metro noise and didn't hear a peep during our stay. Rooms were also larger than typical European hotels so that was a nice touch. * Facilities were amazing! The rooftop pool and bar is an amazing plus. After long days walking around exploring, it was great returning to the hotel and lazing on the rooftop pool deck, drinking fresh made sangria or mojitos and eating tasty thin crust pizza. The rooftop is exceptionally beautiful with great views of the city. * One thing to set expectations, don't expect staff to be exceptionally friendly - they are, as in most places in Europe, polite, curt and efficient. Wouldn't think twice about staying here again!

<Title>“Great Hotel in a Perfect Location!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Jazz for three nights after the completion of a 12-day cruise. After being on a ship for almost 2 weeks, we were very happy to check into this hotel. The accommodations were modern, clean and comfortable. We had a standard double room on the sixth floor and could hear a slight rumble from the underground, but not enough to bother us. We especially liked the free Wi-Fi, excellent buffet breakfast and relaxing on the rooftop terrace after a long day of touring the sites of Barcelona. Hotel Jazz is centrally located, right next to Plaza Catalunya, La Ramblas, and many restaurants. Front desk staff was extremely helpful in assisting us with restaurant suggestions and taxi service to the airport. I was so happy that I booked this hotel!

<Title>“What a gem!”
<Content>This hotel was a real bargain! What I mean by bargain isn't that it was just priced very reasonably, but that it was priced reasonably AND it was a great hotel! We haven't been able to say that too often in our travels. The rooms are spacious (we stayed in the Jazz room) including the bathroom. The room service and food was good - we like our coffee in the morning and we were happy with theirs. One of the best features was free Wi-Fi! The maid did an excellent job cleaning our room during out stay too. The only negative thing I can say is the person who checked us in was not all that friendly. I've read so many reviews that say how friendly and helpful the staff was that I figure maybe it was a fluke, and it wasn't that big of a deal. The hotel is centrally located as other people have mentioned numerous times. I would definitely recommend this hotel!

<Title>“Fantastic!”
<Content>We arrived direct from the airport on the very prompt Aerobus (ask them to drop you at Pl Universitat) and were able to check in straight away even though it was only 1.30pm. Our room (on the 7th floor as requested) was clean, cool and comfortable Not particularly spacious, mainly due to the extremely comfortable ENORMOUS bed. I had pre-ordered a bottle of Cava and this was delivered promptly to our room by room service. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and the provided toiletries were adequate. The only criticism would be that it was very difficult to run a bath due to the large immovable shower screen. The room was quiet and yes, you could hear a rumble from the metro every now and again, but it certainly didn't stop us sleeping. When we opened the door to the 'balcony', the roar of the city was amazing, made you realise how much outdoor noise was shut out. We headed promptly for the rooftop terrace which was amazing. There were views across the the castle, to the sea and to the cathedal. The pool was cold, but not cold enough to stop me enjoying a pre-breakfast swim each morning. The terrace was well supplied with loungers and towels and the bar service was a bonus.Two cold beers in the sun at 7pm after a long day sightseeing was fantastic. I used the free wifi with my laptop in the room. I had to ring the front desk to ask for a code but the service was efficient. The location of the hotel was perfect. Placa Universitat and the nearest metro station is literally 30 seconds walk from the hotel doors. Placa Catalunya is 5 minutes walk away. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel for location, style and comfort.

<Title>“Sleek and modern hotel in a great location”
<Content>This was our first trip to Barcelona, and I am so glad we selected Hotel Jazz. The room was incredibly spacious (especially by European hotel standards), immaculately clean and decorated in a very contemporary way. Check in was quick and easy, service in the bar the one time we used it was excellent, and the front desk staff was always accommodating (although one restaurant recommendation should have been reconsidered). We like to walk as much as possible in cities, and the location of Hotel Jazz made that extremely easy -- we had breakfasts in a coffee shop in the Barri Gotic, dinners in the Eixample and lunch down near the beach, all nice walking distance. And for trips a bit further away (Sagrada Familia, Park Guell), the hotel is half a block from the Metro (and that system is excellent). The room was comfortable, as was the bed. I've seen comments about noise -- I think it may depend on who is in the room next door. Yes, I heard folks come in late one night, but that was it. We were there when FC Barcelona won the Spanish league championship -- thousands of people descended on Placa Catalunya just two blocks away, and the street area just below our fourth floor room was shut down by the police as a staging area for paddy wagons, etc. But even with all the revelry, etc., the room was quiet enough to sleep (and I'm a very light sleeper). I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay”
<Content>We arrived at our hotel midday and were offered a room on the 7th floor as per our request. Great start to our weekend break. The room was fairly spacious for a city hotel, adequately furnished, clean and quiet. It's in a great location, 10 minutes walk to Catalunya/Las Ramblas and 5 mins to Universitat. A coffee/sandwich shop next door and a couple of other cafes in the very near vacinity. Vienna across the road do great paninis. We didn't eat the hotel once during our stay but on our first night asked for a recommendation of a local restaurant. An Italian close by was recommended called Taglitelle, we were not impressed with the food or service. The roof top area was a great oasis after a long days sightseeing but the bar wasn't open, you had to go to the 1st floor to get a drink in a plastic glass, there was no waiter service from the bar. They said the pool bar was due to open in a couple of weeks. Although not entirely a negative point as they didn't seem to mind guests drinking their own drinks around the pool area, which many guests did. One tip: The keycards operate both the room and the lifts. Make sure your keycard works in the lift before the door closes. I found myself in a situation where the door closed and the keycard didn't work which resulted in me being trapped in the lift for quites some time, ringing the emergency bell several times eventaully brought a staff member to my aid. Several other guests had this problem. Overall we had an enjoyable stay.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel: Great Rooms, Service and Location”
<Content>We spent three nights post-cruise, our first visit to Barcelona, arriving at the hotel at 9:30 AM, where the very helpful front desk staff managed to find us a room immediately available for our stay on the requested high floor. Our fifth floor standard room was the biggest hotel room we ever have had on any of our numerous trips to major European cities, and it was fresh, modern, quiet and immaculate, with a beautiful wood floor. The bed was as wide as "American" king beds and the layers of curtains included a third "blackout" layer. We had to be very quiet and attentive to hear the rumble of the metro, which stops running at midnight, and did not affect our stay at all. We had booked directly with the hotel on-line at a good rate and on arrival found that breakfast was being offered for just over 10 Euros per person, rather than the usual 15 or more, so we ate there and enjoyed the amazing, well-prepared and extensive selection on offer daily, with attentive servers busing the tables, providing cappucinos, coffee with hot milk, etc. Free internet was available at two computers just outside the breakfast area. Our last morning, we had to catch a 6:50 AM flight to make our connection to Cincinnati in Paris, and the front desk personnel steered us professionally and correctly regarding the amount of time we needed to get to the airport, how early we needed to be there, and arranged for an our taxi at the precise time we requested. My only criticism was that the lighting by the bed if you wanted to read in bed was dim if the beds were arranged together to make a king bed, like for us, rather than separated as twin beds. However, a comfy chair with great lighting was available in the corner. The weather was cool during our visit so we never visited the pool on the roof, but, because we hope to stay at the Hotel Jazz on our eventual return to Barcelona, we will have the opportunity to enjoy this amenity.

<Title>“Beautiful, comfortable in great location”
<Content>This hotel just outside the Placa Catalunya has stylish rooms, a gorgeous roof deck with a very small pool. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. Only downsides were that I was put in a room that smelled heavily of cigarette smoke, possibly because of my early arrival, and there were no clocks or irons. The room was very clean though.

<Title>“Perfect hotel, Perfect location, Nice pool, pool bar and view at the roof!”
<Content>This hotel is absolutely recommendable! The best hotel ever I visited in a big city in europe and I travel alot! It is top value for the money. New and cozy rooms not big but standard size but the quality is spotless! The location is awesome just beside the university with nice bars and restaurants and 2 minutes walk to the ramblas and excellent transportation around the city from the hotel! Metro and busses just outside the hotel! Easy to get to the hotel from the airport also with a bus going directly to the university (that is really close to the hotel)! The best thing about the hotel is the roof terrace with a nice pool and a excellent view over the entire city! The pool bar is also recommendable with reasonable prices. I would even tempt to say cheap prices compared to many other bars in the city! And the service at the bar and hotel was spotless and really friendly! If you go to Barcelona and want to stay in central Barcelona, then take this hotel you will not regret it! Within 15 minutes you are, at the beach with public transportation.

<Title>“Good hotel in a good location”
<Content>This hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. The location is handy for the Ramblas and old city as well as for the Eixample. It's about a 25 minute walk to Barceloneta and the beaches and a bit more to Montjuic and its museums. But very handy to the metro and close to the train and buses to/from the airport. The hotel is modern, we were upgraded to a very nice corner room. Staff were friendly and efficient. The breakfast (10 euros) was very good as was the service. I would stay here again. The roof deck terrace (with small pool) was a nice place to hang out and relax.

<Content>We chose Hotel Jazz based on great reviews on Trip Advisor and we weren't disappointed. The location is terrific - handy to public transport, super easy to get to from the airport and an easy walk to most major attractions. We felt safe day and night. The staff are very helpful and will do whatever they can to make your stay comfortable. Rooms are modern and attractive and the room we had was spacious and clean with everything we needed. Breakfast, though not exceptional, was ample, fresh and tasty. The internet is free and there are several computers so no great wait even though we were there during the Iclandic volcano crisis.

<Title>“pretty good spot”
<Content>I liked the overall appearance of the hotel, its location was excellent and the girl on the desk recommened a couple of local restaurants that turned out to be very good. It won't appeal to everyone in terms of taste but then what does. We were on the 5th floor and could hear the metro rumbling but it wasn't loud, more like gentle thuder, quite pleasant actually if you're into thunder. Perhaps an issue if you're on lower floors but ear plugs should solve that. Quite good sound-proofing from the street, although you will hear some and sirens etc espeically in the dead of night, but then you're staying in a city centre what did you expect? Sound-proofing through doors not so good, but wouldn't be an issue unless you were unlucky and had rowdy folk passing your room which we didn't. Room was a decent size, bathroom was nice, ok floor gets wet when you shower, no big deal it dries pretty quickly, aircon easy to operate. Bed was very large although was 2 singles pushed together however I could barely feel the join and besides who actually cuddles in their sleep anyway - bugger off you're too hot etc. There are no tea/coffee making facilities as stated by others, for me its an observation not a complaint as I don't care, there's more than enough cafes to go sit in. On that note we didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food, I agree and thought 15euro each was a bit much for breakfast. Not that I'm a fan of super chains, but Starbucks is 2 mins away and does a decent coffee with a couple of croissants for 11 euro for 2! add fresh orange juice and you're looking at about 16euro for 2. Again there are local cafes if you don't like starbucks, but it had a good location too with a decent outside area, so I shamefully submitted to the corporate giant. Someone else mentioned that Mcdonalds, Burger King and KFC were all quite clsoe, this is true, but why the hell would you come all the way to Barcelona to eat that crap?? the mind boggles. Others have mentioned that Barcelona is well populated with thieves, whilst we didn;t suffer from this I did see some of the various ploys previously mentioned in action, eg the 'fake tourist' hello I'm obviously a local, you're obviously a tourist but i'm going to get a map out and ask you for directions anyway while my mate pickpockets you, solution - ignore, walk swfitly on. Ploy no 2; Hello would you like to Salsa dance, I'm promoting a club even though I only have 1 small business card but for some reason I want to stand really close to you to show it to you whilst I try and go through your pockets. Solution - smile, keep your distance and walk away. Also saw the pea under 3 tins being done in la ramblas. Avoid. Update - ref the museum up in the castle, guidebook suggests it may be closing, well in fact it now has, nothing really to see apart from the building itself which has some fab views and some gardens.

<Title>“Location...location”
<Content>Look no further. Hotel Jazz is in a prime location within walking distance from all of the major sites and shopping. The rooms are a great size, some with real king size beds which are difficult to find in Europe. The only down side of this hotel is that there are no irons or ironing boards available in the hotel, so if you are going out for a nice dinner and have been traveling for some time and everything is wrinkled - your only option is to have the hotel press your clothes (at five euros a piece)!

<Content>This is a nice, small, modern hotel between Las Ramblas and the University. The rooms are contemporary and comfortable with very nice bathrooms. It's true it is over the Metro, so get a room on the upper floors. The front desk was always helpful and accommodating. The on/off bus stops a block away.

<Title>“Near Perfect”
<Content>Our stay was nearly perfect. The room was spacious and clean, the staff was extremely helpful. We called in the middle of the night for blankets and they were at our door in less than 3 minutes. They let us check in very early (11 am or so). The only thing that was less than perfect was that it is in a busy area with a fair amount of street noise from traffic and revellers. We were on the 6th floor and there was still occasionally some distracting noise. But then again, it is situated so centrally for all the neighborhoods of Barcelona and I would totally stay there again. While it wasn't exactly cheap, it was a great value. We had the breakfast buffet once--it was a little pricey (15 euros) but had eggs, breads, cereal, yogurt, bacon, fruit... and pretty much anything else you'd want for breakfast.

<Title>“Cool and Comfortable”
<Content>This turned out to be an outstanding choice for my recent 8 night stay in Barcelona. Room was immaculate upon my arrival and well-maintained by cleaning staff throuhgout stay. Comfortable and pleasent environment, stylishly designed rooms, courteous and helpful staff, good climate control and nice public areas, with easy internet access on computers near bar. Did not have any noise issues from street, even though room looked out over busy Carrer Pelai. Maybe some would find there is a little lack of character in this fairly new hotel and bar is very quiet -- but with so many interesting attrachtions/ restaurants etc. just a few steps or a short metro ride away, that was not an issue for me. For visitors to Barcelona, would highly recommend day trips to Monserrat, Girona, Tarragona and Sitges (last three are reachable from Passeig de Gracia station which is very convenient to hotel).

<Title>“Nice hotel... but over the metro...”
<Content>We recently returned from a stay at Hotel Jazz and selected the hotel based on it's high rating here and checking out the hotel website. The hotel is located in a great central location which makes getting around very easy. It is literally over a metro stop, blocks from Placa Catalunya and around the corner from a tour bus stop. The rooms were clean, staff friendly, decent breakfast, and nice design. Our only issue was at night you could hear the rumble of the metro as it passed under the hotel and we were on the 7th floor.

<Title>“This is an excellent hotel”
<Content>Just back from Hotel Jazz, 2nd stay in 3 years , I cant rate this hotel highly enough, The pool and roof terrace are superb, the staff are very helpful and friendly, the hotel is spotless and in a superb location, 5 minute walk from the top of la rambla and plaza catulunya, 7euro taxi ride to parc guell, 1.5 miles to sagradia familia ,the rooms are excellent, couple of minor things, there is no kettle or coffee making facilities in the rooms, and the bacon and mushrooms were served cold, with warm tomatoes, fair enough if that is the way they eat them in Spain, it still tasted alright , but that is a minor blip in an other wise superb hotel, Tip if your arriving in the evening like we did get the night bus, the N17 at the terminal. it takes you near enough outside for 1.40 euro. on are return we took the well marked blue airport bus, getting on it directly outside el corte englaise which is on plaza catulunya this costs 5euro, once again this is an excellent hotel and if I return to Barcelona i wouldnt stay any where else (there is no need to)

<Content>Great hotel in an excellent location.The hotel reception were helpful & we managed to get a room early.The rooms were clean , spacious & modern. The rooftop terrace & pool is great for relaxing at the end of a busy day. Really easy to get the aerobus & not far from hotel. Lots of good places to eat & drink nearby. I'd definately recommend Can Culleretes for lovely authentic Spanish meal. The only negative is the rumbling metro, but I would definately stay here again.

<Title>“Fantastic hotel, great location, lovely rooms”
<Content>The prices may seem slightly high for this 3* hotel, but you will see why. If there were better services, it could be classed as a 4*. Fantastic location - less than 5mins walk to top of Las Ramblas. There are 2 metro/underground lines within 2-5mins walk. Easy to find hotel. Location has to be the main selling point. Safe area as well for walking back (even alone) at night. We walked to all the sites - would recommend this as opposed to getting the tourist bus (22euros!). Was lucky enough to have room with balcony looking over main road, but don't worry the windows are sound-tight - could not hear any outside noise. Rooms very clean, great facilities. People moan about having no tea/coffee machines and double beds being two singles pushed together, but this is consistent with most European City hotels. Hotel had nice bar and resturant (didn't use due to so many bars and restaurants near-by). Roof top sun terrace is fantastic - great place to unwind after a busy day site-seeing. Swimming pool was freezing cold, but this was beginning of April and hadn't warmed up. Think it may be heated in the main holiday seasons. Overall: Location 10/10 Hotel facilites 9/10 Rooms 9/10 If come back to Barcelona, this would be our 1st choice hotel (if good prices were available).

<Title>“Fantastic stay, perfectly placed and excellent service”
<Content>We had the "opportunity" of extending our stay due to the recent volcano over reaction. The staff were brilliant and extended our stay with no issue, they even gave us a reduced rate for the extra days unlike a lot of opportunists who were cashing in. The facilities at the hotel were exactly as described and we agree with the previous reviews in that it felt more like a 4 * hotel. The room we had was large, very clean and well maintained; the level of equipment was above standard and had everything you would hope for from a European hotel. The free use PC’s with internet access were a great help in sorting out rebooking our flight and things to do during our extra time in the city. The location is so convenient for the Ramblas and the Eixample area which has much better (less commercial) restaurants, the staff were very helpful and willing to advise on where to eat. We found an "Argentinean corner" around the Carrer d'Arago, 2 very good and reasonably priced restaurants. Also convenient from the hotel is the underground access, there are two stations within 2 mins walk. The rooftop area was a nice addition to relax in the sun but it was not warm enough for us to use the pool. We would definitely recommend the Jazz hotel and would have no hesitation in staying there again if we ever wanted to return to Barcelona. Maggie and Alan Wilkinson, Norfolk, UK

<Title>“A NICE WELL LOCATED HOTEL BUT WITH A NOISY YOUNG CLIENTELE.”
<Content>A NICE WELL LOCATED HOTEl BUT WITH A NOISY YOUNG CLIENTELE....BRING YOUR EAR PLUGS! We stayed in Hotel Jazz for 3 nights in April 2010. While the Hotel Jazz is very well located (5 mins from Place Catalunya and Ramblas), clean and has friendly English speaking staff, the standard rooms can be very small and it may not suit light sleepers and the 50 + category. This was our third stay here in 2 years. Previously we stayed in one of their larger corner rooms on the sixth floor. This time all we could get in a booking late was a standard room on the 4th floor...the floor from Hell, as it transpired. The room was beside the lift, was very cramped, and had a view of a large grey wall and nearby resident’s washing hanging out to dry. Unfortunately the main problem was NOISE. The Hotel is obviously built directly over the Metro as regularly a low vibrating rumble would permeate the room, lasting about 5 seconds. When we had previously stayed here, we were on the 6th floor and while we could notice the Metro effect then, it was far more noticeable on the 4th floor. So if you’re booking, go for as high a floor as you can get, to get away from the Metro effect. Secondly as the room was right beside the lift, we also had regular lift noise. However staying in a small cramped room looking out the back of the hotel onto a blank cement wall does have one advantage ... you’re not fronting onto the main road. On the two previous occasions we stayed in Hotel Jazz, we had a room which fronted onto the main street. There was a lot of all night traffic noise, police sirens, youths shouting, etc. Finally, the 4th floor must be where all ‘noisy’ guests are placed, or at least it seemed that way to us. The first night, there was a large group of young English people who appeared to occupy most of our floor. Loud talking, shouting, door banging, etc., at 2 am, 4am, etc.. The following night, mercifully the English appeared to have gone home, but only to be replaced by a large excited group of young Spaniards who also liked to party, it would seem, into the early hours. On the final night, the Spaniards seem to have gone home and all seem quiet for a time ...until a new born baby in a room close by started to wail! As parents ourselves (we have three grown ups) we couldn’t for the life of us comprehend why someone would want to come to a Hotel with a small new born baby who needed to feed regularly? What ever happened consideration for others? I accept that the Hotel can’t be responsible for the guests, but the Hotel can avoid placing a large group all together on the same floor beside other unfortunates who then have to listen to the ‘fund’ the group are having at all times of the day and night. The Hotel must also know through its pricing policy etc. what end of the market it is attracting. It can't have it everyway. The Hotel is well located, clear and friendly, buy my advice is bring your ear plugs, seek as high a floor as you can get, and don’t take a room beside the lift. As it appears to us that Hotel Jazz are now after a younger more lively crowd (maybe they are deeply discounting their hotel room prices on certain websites attracting young people?) we have decided to move next time on to a more sedate hotel. Hotel Jazz has turned into an Hotel for young people, not for the 50 + group. Sorry Hotel Jazz ...we won’t be back!

The hotel has a roof top pool, and although it was a tad too cold to take a dip, the views of the city were amazing from the decking area. The hotel's location is fantastic, only a 5-10 minute walk to Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas.

<Content>We arrived at the hotel on the airport aerobus which took about 20 mins. The hotel is ideally situated as its only 3 mins to the metro 5mins to the Ramblas and has several restaurants and bars within walking distance. The hotel is clean and modern. The staff are very friendly. The rooms are spacious with loveley bathrooms which have bath/shower, hairdryer and a little box of freebies-gels/creams/lotions etc. We didnt use the restaurant but the bar is nice though fairly quiet. There is a loveley rooftop pool with chill-out seating area which has wonderful views of the city. I would not hesitate to return to this hotel-hopefully it wont be too long!

<Title>“Very Impressed!!”
<Content>We decided on Hotel Jazz as it was much cheaper with Thomas Cook than anyone else. After reading lots of reviews saying how noisy and small the hotel rooms were generally in Barcelona, we were a little concerned it was too good to be true but it was!! Fantastic location just off La Ramblas, checked in within seconds and the room was fab, so much so we took photos as it was so impressive! Immaculately clean, modern and large. Very quiet and air conditioned so no need to open the windows. The hotel has other sister hotels in the City which all took just as impressive.

Room service was adequate as they were missing club sandwhiches and pasta on the menu. Stuff was pleasant, value for money! Very boutique style! Definitely recommend it! The only thing is that we were situated on the 2nd floor near to the road, as I am a light sleeper, I found it noisey, otherwise I can't complain much! The location is central for shopping, cafes, tapas bar etc! Walking distance to Rambla district!

The location for the drop off point for the Aerobus, and proximity to the Metro and Catalunya Square was excellent. The staff were very professional. The rooms were first class and were very comfortable. Everyone in our group thught the hotel was excellent. Although some reviews comment on the Metro noise, I hardly noticed it. I did not eat at the hotel but there are lots of eating places nearby. I woould thoroughly recommend this hotel, and would definitely stay again when I return to Barcelona.

They brought us coffee to the room when requested and provided free access to the computers, printed stuff and even sent a fax all for free. The front desk staff could not have been more gracious. The facilities were very clean and the breakast was quite delux. I would recommende this classy hotel to anyone and I recommend having a nice bottle of cava with friends by the pool on the roof.

<Title>“Good hotel close to all the action”
<Content>I liked the fact that this hotel was close to Plaza Catalunya (where all the tourist buses start), Passeig de Gracia (Gaudi houses) and Las Ramblas. Lots of shopping all around. Clean, good-sized and comfortable rooms. I could hear the subway rumbling but got used to it after a while. Our king-sized bed was basically two twin beds pushed together. We were there the day it snowed in Barcelona, so the small balcony outside the room was perfect for enjoying that rare and special moment. Really appreciated having free Wi-Fi to plan for our next destination. There were also quite a number of English language channels to choose from on TV. Breakfast was satisfactory - plenty of cafes around should one opt not to have breakfast at the hotel. It was comforting to see that the hotel had a security guard at the lobby at all times. Do not mind staying here again in view of its excellent location.

<Title>“Excellent Service & Location”
<Content>The hotel is located at a perfect location close enough to all transportation and within walking distances to many attractions. You can walk to Las Ramblas within 3 to 5 minutes and the Metro is about two blocks away on either side. Is close to everything but also very quiet. The staff is very helpful and never seem bother with our questions. On the contrary they would always ask if any assistance was needed. Rooms are clean and well kept and the higher floors have great views. Would love to go back in the summer to enjoy the roof top deck and pool!

<Title>“A Nice Hotel in a Nice Location with Nice People”
<Content>The Hotel Jazz is very nice. The rooms are not perfect and could use a little updating but that seems to be the case with most hotels. The beds are comfortable, the room is spacious for 2 people, the shower always had hot water and drained well, The free internet is appreciated and seems to be well used by guests. Yes, you could hear the subway going by but it would never wake me. Noice from people in the hallway returning to their room in the middle of the night will wake you. The windows were soundproofed. We did not have breakfast so I can't comment about that. The location was perfect for us. Close enough to Las Ramblas and the Aerobus drop off and pick up spot but far enough away to not have to always deal with Las Ramblas being too close. It is a nice 3 star hotel and you should consider it if the price is right. The staff were very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable. When we return to Barcelona, we will consider booking at the Hotel Jazz again.

<Title>“Great location, a little bit expensive”
<Content>Stayed in Jazz last week. Were in Barca with colleagues to attend Mobile World Congress. Location is almost perfect. Metro is right outside, Ramblas is 10 minutes walk and there are a bunch of good restaurants on the side streets around the hotel Rooms are done up well though amenities are limited. Dont even expect a complimentary bottle of water. One funny thing is that there is no steam iron available in the whole hotel for an emergency press - allegedly for safety reasons. Net connection was pathetic - extremely slow... Could not get much work done once back in the room. Breakfast is adequate, they tweak the menu slightly every day, so it is not too monotonous for a short stay. Check in / check out process was efficient but not without the odd glitch. Rates are a bit high for the size of the hotel, facilities and services

<Content>Very friendly welcome, no messing about, booked in and "keys" handed over in minutes. Rooms are very clean, although in small parts require a little bit of up-keep... wallpaper slightly torn/damaged - but overall lovely, very modern - essentially in an absolute prime position for exploring Las Ramblas/Gothic Quarter and Gaudi's architecture. (Shouldn't forget, the hotel is very close the Playa Catalunya where the super-efficient, very good-value-for money airport buses will drop you off/pick you up.)

<Title>“Excellant hotel - recommended for the active wheelchair user”
<Content>My 1st impressions were very good. Moden, ramped reception area with helpful multi lingial staff. The staff accomadated our requests (to turn our twin disabled room into a double) with no issue. The 2 lifts were of reasonable size and would comfortubly accomadate 2 people with large cases and a wheelchair. Our disabled room (2nd floor) was clean, comfortable, with good space/turning circles and facilities. As common with the area, I could hear (slightly) the sound of the metro, but that is the same with ALL hotels/cafes/restaurants in this location. Once guests accept it's there in the dim background, it is not a problem. Hotel Jazz has done its best to minimise the sound, the metro runs weekdays tilll approx 00.00 and later on weekends. Several good restaurants are only a few minutes walk away on Las Ramblas and surrounding areas. The local area is wheelchair friendly, but I would recommend another person helps with some of the inclines and ramped pedestrian road crossings. This hotel is highly recommended and we wil return later in the year.

<Title>“fancy a glass of vino”
<Content>just back from hotel jazz after stayin for 5 nites. The hotel is very centrally located, spotlessly clean - bed clothes and towels change everyday. Mini bar in room very expensive so we didnt use it thank god. Breakfast is a rip off not even worth 5 euros - we bought rolls and things and with the help of our own kettle made our own snacks. Biggest complaint is although hotel bar was the cheapest place we found to have a few it closed lites out at 11 p.m. i felt like a teenager. Bar staff spent most of their time out the back so you might have to wait to get ur thirst quenched and one in particular just seemed to hate to be bothered serving anyone. A proper restaurant in hotel jazz and extension to opening hours in bar and service with a smile would do a lot for this hotel

<Title>“Good Location, Good Value except for buffet breakfast”
<Content>We stayed here for 2 nights following a cruise. The location is ideal for walking to La Rambla, Barri Gotic, L'Eixample, while not being in the heart of the congestion. The room was large by European standards, with greys and blond woods in a very modern, minimalist aesthetic. Although we had read about the subway noise, we were totally unaware of it, but in December we were not opening the window. My husband has dietary restrictions (no sugar, no cheese) that make breakfast in Europe, especially in Spain, a bit of a challenge for him. He usually needs eggs or cereal with milk, or plain yogurt (not the fruit kind) or he will become ill. So he needed to eat at the hotel's buffet because we did not see any viable options on the streets near the hotel. He found the scrambled eggs inedible, but was able to eat the hard boiled ones. The price per person was steep and not worth it. The hotel is located steps from the metro station on the line that goes directly to La Sagrada Familia, so very convenient in that regard.

<Title>“A very elegant, modern, “3,5” Stars Hotel”
<Content>We had a wonderful time (5-nights) at Hotel Jazz a very nice, modern, “3,5” Stars Hotel. The room was very comfortable, very clean, quiet, and in perfect condition with a little balcony facing the street. The accommodation was basic but the king size bed was comfortable and the bathroom spacious very clean nicely equipped and with very hot water in a powerful stream. The service was excellent and the staff was very polite and very helpful and everyone spoke perfect English. Before our arrival they replay immediately to my e-mail questions. Two, Free internet, PCs are available in the 1st floor. The location is absolute perfect since it is so easy to get the city center. There are two Metro stations nearby, and Las Ramblas and the Plaza Catalunya are only 5 minute away. Coming from the airport the Hotel is only 1 minute from the “Aerobus” station. We didn’t have breakfast since there are so many nearby cafe's.

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel and Location”
<Content>Stayed in a corner suite at Hotel Jazz in early January 2010. Staff was very helpful, breakfast was good and fresh food, and the accommodation was wonderful. The room was very large by European standards (being a corner suite helped, but my son had a double room and it was also roomy), shower pumped out hot water in a powerful stream, and the king bed (bigger than a king actually) was quite comfortable, with a clean comforter. The room had two large glass doors that opened onto a small balcony (not big enough to use) and the streets below, providing fresh air and the sounds of Barcelona. I can't really say anything negative about the hotel, they had a security guard in the lobby (who didn't do much but smile) and the front desk folks were helpful when we asked them information on tourist activities. There is a wine shop literally 50 feet from the front doors, allowing you to buy a bottle of wine to avoid using the hotel bar (we don't typically use hotel bars unless we're well outside town, and this is central). There are two Metro stations within a few hundred yards, and Las Ramblas is a 5 minute walk, as is Plaza Catalunya. It was not cheap - 235 Euros for a corner suite (91 E for a double), but the room was as big as any I've ever had in Europe, and comfortable. Swimming pool on the roof was closed for winter, as was the roof garden area.

<Title>“Clean, modern hotel in perfect location!”
<Content>Hotel Jazz is a great choice for people visiting Barcelona for the first time. The blue airport bus drops you off within a block of the hotel. The hotel is easy to find, no matter how jet-lagged you might be. The service was excellent, and everyone spoke perfect English. Rooms were clean, quiet, and in perfect condition. My cousin who has visited Barcelona many times recommended Hotel Jazz to us as her favorite hotel in Barcelona. The breakfast buffet was available every day for 15 Euros, even on Christmas. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel, because Spanish hot chocolate was available at nearby cafes for only 3 Euros. Exotic fruits are available at a nearby market, and several bakeries are a short stroll away. There is also a grocery store nearby.

<Title>“Stylish, quiet, with good location for sightseeing”
<Content>As the name suggest, this is a modern, trendy hotel, decorated in grays and blond wood. We enjoyed it two years ago, and came back with our four teenagers. Good location for sightseeing and business downtown. Nice rooftop pool. No restaurant, except for breakfast buffet and that is not worth it at 15 euros. Get a cafe out on the street. Rooms are VERY quiet - except that every two minutes you you can sense a rumble from subway, which stops at midnight. (Odd, if there was a little street noise you wouldn't notice the subway.) Bed/mattress are very comfortable. Bathrooms are nicely equipped. Like other hotels in Spain, they don't use shower curtains, bathroom fans or tissue boxes. We thought it was a nice touch to have a security guard in the lobby (in a sportcoat, not a uniform) - we were comforted, not intimidated. Overall, highly recommended.

<Title>“Great Location, Nice Hotel with a few (minor) negatives”
<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Jazz for 7 nights over New Years and oved the hotel (mostly). The location is perfect. There is a metro stop basically riht outside the hotel which makes it perfect for getting to everything you might want to see. La Rambla is a short walk (5 minutes) which we found nice as the closer you get to it the more the crowds become somewhat annoying after a few days. There are countless great restaurants within short walking distance of the hotel which proved nice as the hotel restaurants lunch and dinner menu left a little to be desired (this is the first of my negatives towards this hotel). It is actually the same as the in room dining menu. I had expected more. The buffet breakfast which we tried once was okay but for what it offered was a little bit pricey. I would recommend going to a nice cafe nearby for breakfast instead. The final thing that left a somewhat bad taste in our mouth was that when we asked for a late checkout we were told it would be 50 euros for two hours extra. We felt that afte having stayed in the hotel for a week that two extra hours shouldn't be too much to ask. They did old our luggage for us for the extra time we had needed but it definitely would have made it easier to be able to still be in our room. All in all this is a fantastic hotel and would recommend it to anyone wanting to see Barcelona it's just we had a few minor negative things that if rectified would have made our trip perfect.

<Content>We were here in April and our experience this time was just as good. Last time we had a room looking out of the front, this time our room was facing the internal courtyard - both times on the 5th floor. Our preference was this room as it was very quiet, although both were good. The location is great and the staff were very helpful and guests may leave suitcases with reception in a secure room even after you have checked out. It may be a 3 star hotel, but it offers everything that a city visitor needs.

<Content>A sister hotel to the 1898, this place is NOT as historic and in the middle of Las Ramblas as 1898 is but it is a great bargain for the type of rooms it offers.. hard-wood flooring, next to metro and a short walk to las ramblas... If you are on a budget but want a great hotel, do jazz if you want an incredible hotel and don't quite care about paying maybe 1/3 more... absolutely go with 1898! I did love Jazz though!

<Title>“Jazzed!”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel jazz for three nights before departing on a Transatlantic Cruise. We chose the Jazz based on reviews/location/price and were not disappointed! As others have mentioned, the hotel is ideally located within easy walking distance to Placa Catalunya, La Rambla, and the Passeig de Gracia. Our room was located on the 2nd floor with an interior view of a “courtyard” (I don’t believe it was accessible?). Some people would have probably objected to this particular room – opting for something on a higher floor with a view or with more light, but we loved it. We felt kind of “tucked” away and it was very quiet (ideal for sleeping in!). We did hear the rumble of the subway, but this did not bother us at all – I kind of liked it. The room itself was very clean, modern and quite large. We had a king bed which was firm, but comfortable. The bathroom amenities were fantastic… lot’s of shower gel, sponges, soaps, a vanity kit, etc. While the hot water takes a bit of time to warm, the water pressure is fantastic. The free wireless internet access is a huge plus and QUICK I might add! Even though it was too cold to swim, the rooftop pool area is a great spot for sipping Spanish wine and taking in the sunset over the city! I imagine this would be quite the oasis in the city during the warmer months! As mentioned, the location is perfect for exploring BCN by foot – or otherwise! We did not use public transport while there, but the proximity to the metro makes it easy breezy to get around town. There are lots of cafés and restaurants within steps of the hotel. In fact, there is a little “snack counter” type place just to the left of the entrance, which is ideal for grabbing a soda, water, wine - whatever! We spent three days walking, walking, walking – wandering and exploring Barcelona! We had visited Barcelona on one other occasion and hit all the “major” sights – this time, we just enjoyed getting lost in the maze of alley’s – popping into bars, café’s, markets, shops. Barcelona is a truly fantastic city! We were actually kind of sad that we had to embark on our 14-night cruise! All in all, we loved the hotel jazz and would stay here again without hesitation.

The hotel is very modern, plenty of light, balcony doors that open for fresh air , wood floors in the guest rooms, no dirty carpets here. Nice breakfast, plenty of choices. free use of computers on 2nd floor. Small bar on 2nd floor nice place to unwind after a long day. Airport bus is the way to go. It stops one short block from hotel ( 3rd stop ) . 5 min walk to las Rambas. Room was larger than the standard European hotel.

Besides the great location of this hotel (10 min walk, with the suitcase from where the Airobus drops you in plc Cataluña) and the originally designed rooms the stuff is extremely friendly and definitely contributes to the overall success of the entire trip. This place definitely deserves a good word!

<Content>This is a beautiful hotel in a great location. Just be ware that altho you are in a 4 star hotel, with security cameras and a security person at the front door, you can be robbed in the lobby. As with all over in Barcelona, thieves are thick and slick. Our son-in-law was robbed of his backpack containing expensive camera equipment and his passport as we were sitting on one of the benches in the lobby. While we were focused on reading a map, some men in suits (we saw them on the security cameras later) walked by and took the pack which was sitting behind him. The staff was not too quick to come to our aid when we reported the incident. We had to take the initiative to say, "We have to call the police, or lets look at the security cameras, etc.". That was disappointing. Apart from that, it was a beautiful place to stay and we would stay again. We had a great view of the street below!

<Title>“Just right for us”
<Content>We have never been to Barcelona before, what a surprise. It is a lovely city with so much to see and do. We stayed at the Hotel Jazz for 4 nights from 14-18th November. We arrived at midday and was allowed to check in straight away, which was an added bonus. We found the staff helpful when asked and the room was ample for our needs. The weather was very warm, so it was a pleasure to sit by the pool on the roof at the end of a tiring day, what a lovely view. One day I could not get the air conditioning to work and the room was quite cold, I phoned down to reception and someone came within 5 minutes and got it working. How is that for service? Although it has a small bar, it did not get busy,(maybe it is the time of year), the barman was friendly and approachable. All in all we enjoyed our stay, and the free Wi-Fi has got to be a big plus. On checkout we were allowed to stay in our room until 12-30 pm, then we left our cases in the luggage room and went up to the roof and sat in the sun by the pool until it was time to leave, a very pleasant way to end our stay.

<Title>“You must stay here!”
<Content>Although we were in the hotel less than 24 hours, the accomodations, the location and especially the service were just amazing. Located at the top of La Rambla, Hotel Jazz is centrally located to all of Barcelona's best features.

<Title>“Modern design in great location”
<Content>Great location right off of Plaza Catalunya, stylish modern design and a comfortable room. Great pick for your first stay in Barcelona when you’re just getting to know the area. For future stays, there are probably better deals. The pool on the roof was tiny but cute and we found the hotel staff to be helpful.

<Title>“Very pleased with this hotel, great location”
<Content>Stayed here 4 nights first week of November after cruising. The people in the front desk were friendly and nice. Rooms were relativly spacious, it was possible to move around even after we had placed two suitcases! Bathroom a little dark with black tiles, but stylish. I loved that there was at bathtub. Bar was nice to sit and relax. We went out for breakfast the first 3 days because we thought the hotel breakfast was too expencive (there were 4 of us). Lots of little coffeshops around and also a Starbucks. The last morning we took breakfast at the hotel, and it was very good with cereals, bacon, sausage, eggs and so on. The location could not be better. Close to Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. And one other thing we appreciated very much - the free wireless internet connection in the rooms and everywhere else. We had 2 rooms in the second floor and could hear the subway as a distant rumbling, I think someone mentioned here earlier that it passes under the hotel. Did not bother us at all. But that said, you hear "all" sounds from the corridor and from rooms above you. That is the one little negative I have to say about Hotel Jazz. Would definately stay here again.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>The location of this hotel couldn't be better - especially on a short break when you want to pack in as much as possible. Looks a bit dark and severe as you walk in, with unsmiling reception staff and a tiny public lounge area, but the bar is pleasant and the rooftop pool area is a lovely place to relax when the weather is nice. Rooms are modern and well-equipped. A mirror over the dressing table would be welcome so two people can get ready at the same time! These are minor gripes. Would definitely recommend it overall. If it's a first trip to Barcelona and you haven't much time the open top tourist bus gives you a very good idea of the diversity of the city. A 2 day hop on hop off ticket is good value at 27euros and allows you to do the red and blue routes. For Gaudi lovers like me, Parc Guell is a must and entrance is free. The taxi driver advised going early evening in summer months because it's quieter. At 3pm on a fine November day it was swamped with people.

<Title>“Another reason to trust Trip Advisor advice!”
<Content>Spent two nights in Barcelona the last week of October. We were extremely pleased with our choice of the Hotel Jazz. The location was perfect, just a little off Las Ramblas, liked the stream-lined, tonal, boutique decor, and our room on the 7th floor was large with very comfortable king bed. The staff pleasant and helpful. We couldn't comment on the brunch or bar because we didn't take advantage of either. It was definitely in a safe-feeling area and a good value for the cost. Thank you to all the Trip Advisor members whose reviews helped us in planning!

<Content>We just returned from a three night break in Barcelona and couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The location was fantastic, the rooms were good and breakfast was a very ample spread. Our teenage girls were very happy - close to lots of shopping - and my husband liked it so much he decided he'd use it again when he goes to Barcelona on business.

<Title>“Perfect, perfect, perfect”
<Content>This was our first time in Barcelona and we were only going to be there one night before we left on our cruise. This hotel was in a PERFECT location for exploring Las Ramblas and the Barrio Gothic. It was also close to the port and the airport. Great rooms with a lovely pool deck. Has a great breakfast too. Moderately priced, not too noisy and in walking distance of some major highlights of the city. Also free internet which is a plus when travelling abroad.

<Title>“Excellent location and hotel for visiting Barcelona”
<Content>This hotel is in the best location for a city break to Barcelona. It's very near the centre of town and within easy walking of Las Ramblas and the old city. The hotel is modern and very clean with laminate floors and new fittings. Our room also appeared to be soundproofed pretty well. The only thing we could hear from the 7th floor was some traffic noise and the rumble of the metro trains. But hey, you're in the centre of a big city, what do you expect?! We used the roof top terrace, took our own food and drinks up, it was great in the sunshine. Our rate didn't include breakfast but there are loads of good cafes just outside on the street. These were much cheaper than eating in the hotel. The only real problem - no kettles in the rooms so if you have space bring a travel kettle and tea/coffee for the luxury of tea in bed. We used the open top buses to get around. A 2 day pass was E27 each. A word of warning, there are two bus companies running these trips. We used "Barcelona City Tours" and had no problems getting a seat on the top deck at most times. The other company, "Bus Touristic", have more buses but the queues to get on were horrendous.

<Title>“Nice hotel...”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here for 6 nites in October 2009. Without a doubt, the best way to get to the hotel is via the Aerobus from the airport. The cost is 4.25 euros, which you pay to the driver when you get on. Just make sure you get off at Universtat, which is the third stop from the airport (and a fairly short ride BTW). If you stay on until Pl. Catalunya you will undoubtedly have a much tougher time finding the hotel. From Universtat the hotel is about one block away. It is basically straight ahead in the direction that the bus goes, but a little off to the right. There is a nearby cab stand if you need to ask for directions. In general we thought the hotel was very nice. We stayed on the 4th floor and had no problems with the metro noise. We could definitely hear the subway, but it was nothing more than a minor annoyance. It was not enough to wake me even though I am a fairly light sleeper. I heard it roughly 2 or 3 times an hour. Nor was the street noise an issue; in fact it was fun to watch all the activity out on the street. I had thought about requesting a courtyard room but was glad I did not. I looked into a courtyard room and it appeared smaller than our standard room. Our room had a huge kingsize bed and a fridge big enough to hold large sodas. We ate breakfast twice in the hotel. We thought it was okay. Nothing particularly special. One area they could improve on is keeping fresh eggs out. The eggs we had had definitely been sitting out for some time, and some times there were none. Also, the breakfast room is very nice but there was not enough staff there. Several tables had dirty dishes from customers who were long gone. For late night snacks, there is a McDonalds about 2 blocks away. If you walk left out of the hotel towards Pl. Catalunya it is down on the right side just past Starbucks. Burger King is also just around the corner from there. There is also a KFC not too far away. The hotel is in a good location, although I’m not sure that I would want to stay in that area if I were returning to Barcelona. Why? It is kind of like staying in Times Square in New York. Very, very busy. The advantage to staying there is you can always find something to eat and other conveniences like a small grocery, and transportation options are excellent. We bought a 4-day metro pass downstairs in the metro. We never saw attendants so used a machine, and ended up using cash since we did not know the PIN for our credit card. A 4-day pass was 20 euros. We thought this was well worth it. The buses are fairly easy to use. The metro was a bit more challenging but we did use it a couple of times. Some of the stations were a bit crowded and hot, but we had good experiences on the trains themselves. We did not use the touristic bus. The advantage for the touristic bus would have been not getting lost, which we did a few times. Because we were there for 6 days, getting lost was less of an issue for us. The most fun we had was on a one-day bus tour to Montserrat. It is a monastery on a huge mountain about one hour outside the city. The bus tour begins at 8am and ends at 8pm (except Mondays I believe). They also take you to a winery and the upscale beach town of Stiges. We bought our tickets at the Julia travel agency. If you exit the hotel to the right it is directly across the street. They told us at Julia that you have to book a day in advance, but we saw people paying on the bus the next morning. The bus leaves from near the Aerobus stop at Pl. Catalunya at 8:30. The touristic bus co. actually runs the tour. The cost is 70 euros per person. We thought it was worth the high cost. We did not take the Aerobus on our return to the airport b/c you can only catch it from Pl. Cat. and that was too far (about 3 blocks) to walk with our luggage. The cab ride was a bit more expensive than we thought it would be at 32 euros, not incl. tip. There is a Barclays Bank ATM machine just down the block if you head to the right out of the hotel, going towards Pl. Cat. It is very small and easy to miss, but this is an excellent place to withdraw Euros if you hold a Bank of America ATM (not credit) card b/c Barclays is a partner bank with BOA; you will not be charged any service fees at all. Just make sure you withdraw from your checking, not credit account. I only saw one US branded ATM, a Citibank, just off Pl. Cat., to the left, if you are walking towards that area, I believe near a second Burger King in that area. Upon our return I see on the BOA website that Santander is also a partner. That bank is located throughout the city. We did not have very good luck with restaurants in our 6 days. In fact we found the food quality overall to be average at best. Yet, the cost was quite high, on avg. at least 50 euros or $75US, for two people. We tried a number of places listed in the guide books. The best place we found by far was Monchos, an all-you-can-eat buffet which gives you the advantage to try many different things. And the cost was reasonable, 16 euros per person. It is quite easy to get to by city bus. Take the no. 58 from Pl. Universtat (near where the Aerobus drops you off) and go roughly 6 stops to Travessera de Gracia. It is in a very nice, less touristy neighborhood, and the restaurant is beautiful and had live music when we were there. We flew on Air France from Washington DC, thru Charles de Gaulle. AF was certainly nothing special (our luggage, and several other passengers’, did not make it to Barcelona even though we were on the ground in Paris for over 1.5 hours causing us to spend an extra two hours in the BCN airport waiting for the next flight from Paris). But if you stop over in Paris, make sure you get some croissants and quiche. That was the best food we had the entire trip.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>My sister and I stayed in Hotel Jazz during the middle of October. The hotel was clean, staff were friendly and location was excellent. Your feet away from a Metro Station and very short walk to Plaza Catalyuna. We took the aerobus from airport to hotel (4.5 euro each) and it drops you almost on hotel door steps. The hotel staff was nice, but they do not have a concerige. Also, the hotel doesn't change currency, but with ATMs it's not a big issue.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>Jazz Hotel is located within 2 minutes walk of Placa Catalunya which is the central aea of Barcelona. It is also near the universty so there are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. The Baroque Market is a must see and perfect place to get some freshly cut fruit for breakfast or enjoy fresh lunch cooked on the spot with the freshest market produce - it is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel has a great swimming pool on the rooftop and free internet. It is a very new hotel (2004) with good amenities and great location. Watch the rates, the earlier the better to book as we booked 2 nights for only 90 Euro each but then extended our stay in Barcelona and had to pay 180 Euro per night! For 90 Euro it is great value but 180 is too expensive. Check around as there are hundreds of hotels in the same area. The cleaning staff are great but the hotel reception are not overly friendly or helpful. Still, if it was around 100 Euro I would stay here again.

<Title>“The reviews are true - great stay!”
<Content>Booked our double room six months ago when we got our cheap flights and go room for 100 euro per night. The location is great - just off Placa Cataluyna at top of La Rambla so nice and quiet but 5 min walk and you are in the heart of the city. Room had everything you need and a bit more (dental kit anyone?). Did not do breakfast - seemed expensive and there is a Starbucks if you need a familiar place or plenty of local bars with pastries and espresso for less money. Used hotel bar one night as it was cheap - 2 euro 50 for a san miguel or glass of cava! Found staff very helpful and friendly - provided maps and advice and even changed some big euro notes for smaller ones rather than me trying to use them in bars etc. Got airport bus there - really easy. Too cold for the pool but must be really good in summer to take a dip and lounge around. Recommendations - Taller de Tapas (hotel gave us directions) try the salt cod fritters. Vino dy Senyer (near Taller) - great little wine only bar. Cafe Sol on the beach for cheap lunch time deal (11 euro for 3 nice courses) Bus Touristic (nec for any short visit to see everything) Casa Batillo (amazing to see inside it - cost 16 euro to get in - discount with bus ticket by 20% but well worth it for Gaudi fans)

<Content>We returned to Jazz for 2 nights after staying here 2 years ago. Quite pricey for what it is, even though we shopped around and eventually found the best price on the hotel's own website. Pool and roof terrace make it worthwhile, but the best thing of all about this hotel is the soundproofing. Excellent!

<Title>“Funky modern place in great location near the old town and side streets”
<Content>We really liked this location - close to La Rambla and old town, but not right down in all the noise. The whole hotel atmosphere and rooms are very modern and funky. The swimming pool on the roof is worth a visit around sundown with great views across the city and you can have a dip while you wait for the locals to have dinner (!). Service was very friendly and professional. Free internet on the mezzanine level to help plan out your days. There's not a lot happening in the hotel bar, but that's fine because there must be 50 restaurants or bars nearby in the uni district or down on La Rambla (7 mins walk). We'd stayed in many older heritage-style hotels before this on our trip, so it was nice to stay in something so modern and new for a change.

<Title>“Great location; impersonal atmosphere”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz for a few nights, and arrived late at night. Check-in absolutely unproblematic, and we knew from previous trip to Barcelona that this was a good location for us (pretty much equidistant between the different Barcelonas - Olympic area, main port, 'Gaudi', old town... We had a huge corner room, more like a suite (clearly the big sofa could have been a bed for two more people), with a very nice bathroom and the usual flat-screen tv. The pool was really the only disappointment (we breakfasted out every day - the cafes in the University Sq. are cheap and do excellent choc. and churros). The pool area was obviously cleaned over-night (or very early a.m.) each day, but not subsequently, so if one retired to the roof to swim against the Barcelona skyline after a hot day sight-seeing, there were (on all three of our days) no clean towels available, and a lot of bottles/glasses lying around from the day's revellers. Nevertheless, by bringing up our bathroom towels we did still swim! I think however that despite the excellent location and value, we would try to find somewhere with a little more character for our next trip.

There is a rooftop pool that is lovely and free internet access (if you didn't bring your laptop) on the second floor; otherwise there is wi-fi access in the rooms. The room rate is incredibly reasonable. I highly recommend this hotel. I was in Spain for 2 weeks and this was, far and away, the nicest of all the places I stayed.

The bedroom was modern, clean and well-appointed, and the bed was huge & very comfy. The rooftop area, with pool, was lovely, with great views - we were disappointed, however, that they closed the area at 5 pm, ( they are now on winter time!)so we were never able to sit there for a drink in the evening. All in all, great value for money. We would definitely go back again.

<Title>“Fab Hotel Jazz!”
<Content>We stayed in Barcelona for 5 nights and chose the hotel mainly because of the rooftop pool and its location. Fabulous hotel, great atmosphere, friendly enough staff at reception with fluent english. The bar staff on the first floor had very little english, but enough to understand your order. The room was nice, we stayed in the 504.. Modern, clean, plenty of space. However, when they said we'll be staying in a room with a queen sized bed, they did not mention that there are just two single beds stuck together. Regardless of that, it was comfortable enough to sleep in, and very little noise, as we were on the 5th floor we did not feel the metro going by under ground. Although the cleaning ladies are really really noisy!! The bathroom was also lovely and they had all these kits, dental, shaving, lots of little shampoos, shower gels, and even a sponge! Which for a 3 star was pretty generous, as very rarely would you get this even in a 4 star.. Loved that there was an ambience music in the room and bathroom. Really nice of them to have free internet for guests, although there were only 2 pc's, it wasn't that busy so you could browse for free in peace.. It was great lounging around by the pool, we stayed from 29th Sept to 4th Oct and the weather was still really nice, around 25C. They give out free towels, and the beds are quite comfortable. The pool was small, but that didn't bother us as neither of us swim! The very few things we weren't really happy about is that there was no ironing board in the room, and you could only iron your clothes with their service which is only until 20.00, and per shirt they asked €5.00. Also, when we were checking out the receptionist was nothing but unfriendly, and we had to ask the same question about 4 times to get an answer out of her. Overall, we had a really nice stay regardless of the little flaws we found. This should really be a four star, rather than a three, the reason behind that is a mystery! I would definitely recommend it for the location (it's around 2 mins walk from las Ramblas where you can get the metro, shop, eat, etc etc), and the fabulous rooftop pool! As you come out of the hotel there are a few shops zara, mango etc, ladies prepare your excuses!!

<Title>“Another great experience with the help of Trip Advisor”
<Content>Location, cleanliness, good A/C, smooth linen on good beds and internet access in a newer modern hotel (that lack the "old stenches" of an older hotel) are my main peeves, so if you're like me, then I think you'll enjoy the comforts of this hotel. I have become a keen user of Trip Advisor for my travels and have learnt to filter the reviews I read. I consider myself "high maintenance" but love to get reasonably priced hotels...Hotel Jazz was my choice for 3 days in Barca and it was great! All the staff were friendly and professional (thx to Jose at the front desk for the xtra fun) , the two rooms were I booked were both clean, smart and neat...i will upload photos later as I think these were rather lacking when I tried to get a better feel for the rooms and bathrooms. I would definitely recommend this hotel for first timers in Barca, it's so close to everything! TIPS: Take the hop on hop off Bus Turistic tour for easy access to all the main attractions...and definitely hit all of Gaudi's! It's literally out of this world! Try to find your way to Moncho's (think it's on Passeige de Gracia near Gaudi's La Pedrera) for jambon and paella, definitely good stuff (found out too late that there is a branch inside the Barca airport)!

<Content>I loved this hotel and would recommend and would go back. It is very chic and sexy, great location (2 blocks from Placa de la Catalunya + La Ramblas), fun pool, rooms are very stylish .. loved it. That said, I found the receptionist a little cold. The 3rd floor and our room had the faint odor of brussel sprouts, for some reason (after 5 mins, you didn't notice this at all). I would have liked to have seen more service on the roof deck by the pool. You have to call down to the restaurant and then they'd come up, a little awkward. But I'm really looking for things to complain about. Overall, I'd say great value, very chic and fun and awesome location.

<Title>“Thank you Trip Advisor!!”
<Content>I booked this hotel for us and three other couples, based on the reviews on Trip Advisor - and it lived up to its reputation and more! The design is nicely understated, and rooms are very stylish and clean, with everything you could need. The rooftop pool is a nice place to relax (although the pool is quite small), and the location is excellent - right at the heart of the city (I read one review that complained it's over the underground line - it was, but it didn't bother us). The bar area is nice, and if you can get a deal that includes breakfast - as good as I've had on the continent. All in all an excellent hotel - and as the city has so much to offer, I'm sure we'll be back!

<Title>“Excellent Location”
<Content>We recently spent four days at the Hotel Jazz finding it a great location for exploring the city, especially the Gothic quarter. We were only blocks from La Rambla and from Placa Catalunya as well as easy access to the metro. The service at the hotel was exceptional, helping us with tour bookings, restaurant suggestions and bookings, and general information to make our visit memorable. If going to Barcelona we recommend the Barcelona Card for use on transportation and discounts on museums, etc. When leaving for the airport we recommend using the bus service rather than taxi. Instead of being charged the meter reading of 35 Euros we were charged 55 with explaintion that the extra charge was for two people. Rather than have an argument and miss our flight we paid. With the Barcelona Card the bus would have been a fraction of that cost. Barcelona is a dynamic city with much to recommend. Restaurants: check out El Quatro Cats and Taller Tapas. Taller helped to make our evening special with attention to detail, great suggestions, and excellent wine. They even provided complimentary sparkling wine (Cava) when they learned we had a birthday that day with the whole restaurant singing "Happy Birthday".

<Title>“Great hotel in Barcelona”
<Content>Based on previous Tripadviser rating we stayed at the Hotel Jazz for 3 night prior to a cruise. It is a very tastefully done and comfortable hotel, and for 100 Euro/night very reasonably priced. The hotel is fairly new, but unlike many newer hotels that have no character or charm, this place is really quite nice. The location is great about a block from the Rambus for shopping and dining, and about a block from two Metro stops. The rooms are very nicely done with tasteful furniture and very nice bathrooms. All of the rooms have a glass door that you can open to a false balcony, just a railing with no room to go out. This allows you to get some fresh air, see what the weather is like or just people watch on the street. My favorite part is the roof top pool. Not a huge pool, but adequate with plenty of deck area for sunbathing and looking out over the city. There is also a great outside rooftop bar. Many of the other rooftop bars in Barcelona are expensive and dressy. The bar here is very inexpensive and low key. Just a great place to go up at night, have a drink and relax looking out over the city. I am sure you can find more expensive hotels and also fancier hotels, but this is a very nice comfortable and well designed hotel that is very reasonably price. You can't go wrong staying here. Save the money you would spend on a more expensive hotel and go out and have a nice meal instead.

<Title>“Great rooms, great location, great terrace, great value!”
<Content>I had booked this hotel without reading any of the reviews, sold by the pool terrace. I then spoke to a friend of mine who had been twice and loved it and couldn't recommend it more, and she was right. The rooms are contemporary, clean and a comfortable size with juliet balconies. We were on the 4th floor and it was possible to hear the metro as it went underneath, however this was not intrusive. The location is fantastic, 5 mins walk from La Rambla and closer still to the Place de Catalunya, the main pick up & drop off for the airport and tourist buses. It is convenient for other bus routes and the metro and there are plenty of shops, bars and places to eat nearby. We found the service to be good, staff were polite friendly and helpful. The pool terrace is gorgeous, the photos on the hotel website don't actually do it justice! It is small, the pool is small and only 1m deep, more for cooling off than swimming but it is peaceful, clean and has lovely views. If I was going to be picky, one of the sunbeds was ripped, but it there were plenty others to choose from. During our visit there was at most 6 other people around the pool and it didn't feel crowded but during mid summer it may get cramped. Unfortunately the terrace bar wasn't open during our stay so I can't say what the food / service was like although it appeared to be reasonably priced. This menu is also the room service menu and the mini bar was also cheaper than we expected. However the breakfast (continental buffet style) was 15,50 each! Needless to say we visited a cafe around the corner for a quarter of the price! The room itself was 247 euros for three nights midweek which we felt was a good price. All in all we would definitely recommend it and would visit again, we had a great time.

<Title>“Hotel is on top of a train station”
<Content>I don't know why none of the reviews I read mentioned this, however this hotel is located directly on top of one of the tracks of a train station. We learned this when shortly after arrival (and every 15 minutes following) our room on the top floor of the hotel was rattled by an incoming train. While trains slow in frequency throughout the night, we learned the hard way that they start up regularly again around 430am on weekdays. While the decoration and cleanliness of this hotel were nice, the noisy trains were definitely a disappointment. Free internet for all guests was definitely a plus.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>Nice clean hotel in super location, modern decor in pretty good condition. Rooftop pool is small, but sunloungers and seating make it a good vantage point. Breakfast is above average - and ask the waiter for an omlette!! Recommend bedrooms above floor 4 ( on floor 2 we felt slight rumblings from the metro line underground - but not a drama ) Best feature is the location - Metro stations of Universitat is 100m and Placa Catalonya is 300m, with loads of good bars and restaurants around (the Cerviceria directly opposite is good) Lonely planet guide will take you to several cheap places to eat - if not slightly bohemian in style

<Content>We stayed in Barcelona at the Hotel Jazz on our first leg of our honeymoon. The rooms were clean, the staff was very friendly, and the hotel itself was very close to Las Ramblas. the main drag in Barcelona. Overall, I would say that this was a great hotel for our honeymoon, and would definitely recommend it to our friends and family.

<Title>“Wonderful surprise”
<Content>We just returned from a cruise to Europe, spending 1 night before and 1 night after in this fantastic hotel. Upon recommendation of Tripadvisor, we reserved the Hotel Jazz. This is truly a modern hotel, within a 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas. Set on a quiet street, there is very little in the way of outside noise. The staff is well versed in English, and were very helpful to answer all of our questions and recommend some site seeing highlights. We highly recommend The Hotel Jazz in Barcelona!

<Title>“Great Hotel, location, pool,staff”
<Content>Located 2 blocks from Plac'a Cataluna, hub for both Old and New Barcelona, transportation,and plenty of restaurants, this modern, small hotel has everything you need, and is beautifully decorated. It is near the University AND stylish shops; is perfectly clean, and staff is friendly and speaks English. Wewould definitely stay here again, or at one of this small, family owned chain's other hotels. There is a nice roof deck pool with a great view for resting your tired feet after a long day of sightseeing. There is a nice breakfast buffet, a little expensive, but made up for by the amazingly low cost of rooms. We loved it.

<Title>“Awesome hotel, Awesome value”
<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Jazz from 9/10 to 9/13/09 and absolutely loved it. The reception desk was so curtious, helping us with directions, making dinner reservations, and giving us tips on the city. The hotel is spotless, the rooms super clean as well with great decor - very trendy, boutique hotel. We loved our balcony in our room - kept the door open most of the time we were there. Rooftop pool was nice touch too after a long day out walking around. The value was the best part about the hotel - it was about $89 euro a night which we thought was an absolute steal for the quality and service of this hotel. We had just come from Italy where we stayed in 2 other 'boutique' type of hotels that were about 3x the price howeer the Jazz blew both of these hotels away. I also liked the location how the hotel is just a bit off the beaten path - it was nice to not be swarmed with crowds of people when you come back from a long day. Great stay at the Hotel Jazz!

<Title>“Its what it says on the tin”
<Content>Currently staying here during the La Merce Festival, first time in Hotel Jazz have previously stayed in other central hotels. This place is great, I love it, its just as described. In common with all other Barcelona hotels there are no in room drink making facilities so bring your own kettle, coffee and tea. The roof terrace and plunge pool are excellent. I cannot disagree with any of the positive reviews that I have read apart from the Irish couple who stated that food and drink in Barcelona were reasonably priced. This may be the case if you are paid in Euros, but if you are paid in British Pounds Barcelona is now expensive. A Big Mac burger, not that I eat these but for illustrative purposes only :), is 6 pounds and a pint of beer 5 pounds. Nothing to do with the hotel of course which is extremely good and I will be staying here again next year.

<Content>My husband and I stayed here 2 nights precruise. We were very happy with the stay. Modern and up to date furnishings. The brkfast was included in our special rate which included hot and cold items. We booked thru the hotel web site. Great location, altho was a little tricky to find from the aerobus stop at the University. A good map steered us to Pelai St. Once we found it after about 5 min. it was easy to get around the city. The desk staff was friendly and helpful in their service provided. We would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Very convenient hotel but without character”
<Content>Stayed in this hotel 4 nights with friends in September. First 2 days - rain, thunder, lightning, floods... last 2 days - fine, sunny and warm. Food in Barcelona was good - tasty and reasonably priced. Service in the restaurants was good for the most part. We tended to eat our main meal at about 2 pm and then have a snack at night. The 'Menu del Dia' was excellent value - bread, a drink, 2 courses, plus either dessert or coffee for about 10 - 12 euros. ++ Plus Points ++ Hotel Jazz is very near to the centre of Barcelona and easy to reach by bus from the airport. The bedrooms are well-appointed if a little tired looking. There was a comprehensive selection of toiletries provided. As well as the usual shower gel and shampoo, there was a dental kit, shoe sponge, comb, shaving kit, shower cap etc - all much appreciated. Air conditioning was invaluable. The shower was powerful and easy to use and there was always plenty of hot water. The standard of housekeeping was good with towels changed every day and sheets and pillowcases changed once during our stay. Staff at check-in and check-out were efficient if not very friendly. Our rooms were available for us even though we arrived a few hours early. The rooftop terrace was a plus - really enjoyed relaxing there. We got a great deal from the hotel website -182 euros each for 4 nights. - - Minus Points - - The hotel entrance is difficult to negotiate as there is no ramp. Getting a suitcase up and down the steps was quite a feat of endurance! There were no operating instructions for anything in the room - tv, air conditioning, bathroom fan etc. Really missed tea/coffee making facilities. The hotel lobby is without doubt one of the most unwelcoming and drab that I have ever seen. We visited the bar once - walked in, round about it and then out. We found it very unattractive and not welcoming. The shower over bath was quite dangerous when the water was on, as the surface wasn't non-slip and there wasn't a handrail. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel so cannot comment on this. But even though this is quite a negative list I think that I would stay here again for all the good reasons I pointed out above. After all we were in Barcelona to enjoy the city, not sit in a hotel room or hotel bar (at least not all the time!)

The room was very quiet, thick window glass that shut out street noise, black out curtains on the window which help when you are sleeping off the jet lag. Buffett breakfast was convenient and not overly priced. Location allows access to all city sights. We would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Content>The hotel is only a few minutes walk from Placa Catalunya yet feels away from the real crowds. Great roof top bar and small pool for relaxing and great views across the city. Breakfast is pretty good and plenty of it. I would highly recommend this hotel as I thought it was good value for such a central location and the rooms were modern and very tasteful. We were on the second floor and the noise from the metro which other reviewers have mentioned was minimal in fact I had to point it out to my husband. It certainly never disturbed us. All in all a great hotel in a great spot.

<Content>Stayed here for 4 nights. They upgraded me to a Junior Suite without me even requesting it. Staff was friendly and helpful throughout the stay. The location can't be beat. Easy access to Metro and most tourist areas. It was wonderful to tour around this beautiful city and then come back to the rooftop pool in the afternoon to relax. Close to many restaurants, cafes, and bars. I would highly recommend this hotel for the casual traveler looking for nice accommodations and a good value. Not luxurious but just right!

<Title>“Not a huge fan...”
<Content>I read a ton of reviews of this hotel before making my reservation and am a bit perplexed as to what characteristics people use to rate a great hotel. While the Hotel Jazz definitely has a "cute" factor, it lacks any of the real amenities that make it stand out as a good hotel. First, the hotel is only ideal if you want to be in the dead center of the tourist area of Barcelona. Think a block off Time Sq in NY. Second, the floors smell terrible. I had read about this in a few reviews before reserving but thought that people may have been exaggerating. They were not! The smell hit us the minute we got off the elevator and was so bad that we knew right away that we would not be staying too long at the Hotel Jazz. Next, the rooms themselves... while adequate in size, the beds were horrible. Hard as a rock and a "queen" bed was literally two single beds pushed together and covered w/ very rough queen sheets. The tv barely worked and the room did not have an iron... nor did the entire hotel have an ice machine. The roof pool was nice (although TINY) but again, due to location, the view left a lot to be desired. Finally, the staff was less than nice. All the reviews I had read mentioned how curteous and helpful the staff was. Not sure if we just got unlucky but the staff we encountered would not even crack a smile, much less make any recommendations. Needless to say, we only stayed one day out of the 4 days we had originally planned. We moved to a hotel in the Barceloneta/Port Olympic area... a MUCH better place to stay; walking distance to the beach, casino and all the waterfront restaurants/bars.

<Title>“Fantastic hotel, great location and excellent staff”
<Content>Just returned from 5 nights in Barcelona, staying at the Hotel Jazz on Carrer de Pelai. Placa de Catalunya and La Rambla are a 5 min walk away and there are lots of excellent little bars, cafe's and restaurants in the vicinity. The hotel itself is very modern and contemporary and the rooms are spacious, light and airy. Bathroom spotlessly clean too! The rooftop patio and pool offer a great view of the city, esp at night and is a lovely place to have a pre dinner drink or two. Only thing to watch out for is that although the bar closes at midnight, the staff tend to clear away the bar and stop serving half an hour before. Other than that, the reception staff were very friendly, helpful and gave excellent recommendations for restaurants in the vicinity esp Celler de Tapas on Placa Universitat and Antico Carr on Gran Via, both of which are very close to the hotel. I would definitely stay at the Hotel Jazz again on my next trip to Barcelona and recommend it to anyone looking for a good value, centrally located hotel which manages to perform the trick of being in a great location while not being too noisy at night.

Staff were very helpful in solving problems and answering questions. Great location with Las Ramblas just around the corner, but far enough away to be quiet. Hotel Restaurant wasn't open, but 100s by others within 10/15 mins walk. Rooftop Swiming pool was truly stunning.

Each night we asked our concierge for a good dinner choice and were always impressed with the recommendation. We didn't make it to the rooftop pool and bar, though we wished we had, when we went to check it out our last night. The food in room service was good too, and practically on par with restaurant prices so you can order in and enjoy the luxury... We had one minor problem with our bathroom one night and they switched us to the junior suite... what else can I say! :)

<Content>My husband and I spent 8 nights at the Hotel Jazz.. Good position..approx 3-5 min walk to top of the Ramblas & Placa Catalunya. Very central to stations to travel for day trips. The hotel is modern and clean. The staff are very helpful with everything...from making a special dinner reservation to directions to metros...discounts for hop on hop off bus and anything else you need. our room was very large and huge bed.clean bathroom. The pool area is lovely but don't get excited as the pool is not to do laps in..just five strokes. More of a plunge pool. Outstanding Value and great Staff. if you want to be in the heart of things..perhaps choose their hotel in the Bari Gotic area...but this was a wonderful choice for us especially in summer where you can walk everywhere. Considering it is on a fairly busy street our room was very quiet.(sixth floor).definately recommend.we did not have the breakfast included in our price so went out for breakfast.If you like cereals, and Muesli..better include the breakfast in the hotel as outside is pastries, coffee, eggs and fruit down at the Bocquira/Market.

<Title>“Lived up to expectations”
<Content>Booked as a surprise by my husband based on reviews on this site and we were not disappointed. Prior to our trip we contacted the hotel to request a high room facing the courtyard to avoid metro and road noise which they kindly accommodated. In our opinion the metro noise can be overstated, we were on the 6th floor and can honestly say hardly noticed it. The room and bathroom were spacious and extremely well appointed - probaby the best city room we have stayed in terms of size/value for money. The journey from the airport by city bus was very easy and literally stops yards away from the hotel. The location of the hotel was ideal for both walking and public transport for all areas of the city. The staff were always helpful and pleasant. The rooftop pool was an added bonus to dip into after a day of sightseeing. It was well kept, very clean and tidy. However, one area of improvement (although a Europe wide problem) would be not to allow guests to reserve sunbeds by the pool. The pool area is small with only @ 15 sunbeds therefore when we arrived late afternoon normally all the beds were already 'reserved', often with no-one appearing within the hour that we were there. That said, this did not spoil our enjoyment of the hotel and we would definitely recommend it.

<Title>“All positives”
<Content>Hotel Jazz was a great place to stay in Barcelona. The location is excellent, as you can walk south along La Rambla for those attractions, and are also close enough to walk north into L'Eixample to see the Gaudi architecture. Our room was very large and modern, while the price was very affordable. The bathroom was large as well, and everything was very clean. The hotel is in the middle of everything, but was very quiet. There are also 2 free computers to use, which was helpful. I'd highly recommend this hotel.

<Title>“The Hotel Jazz - for at great stay in Beautiful Barcelona”
<Content>Everything written about the Jazz is true, and the hotel's pictures are true-to-life. Great location, right next to the metro , and 5 min. walk to The Ramblas. The a/c worked great, planty of room for 2 persons, beautiful modern bathroom, fast and free wireless internet, a hotel safe etc. Only 2 small complaints/suggestions: The hotel staff could be a bit more service-minded, and there should be.beach umbrellas at the extremely small hotel roof pool..... Adddionally, would suggest you buy your breakfast right next door or at Starbuck's down the block for about 5 - 7 Euros instead of paying 25 Euros for the hotel breakfast...... Book in advance and get a much better rate. I booked at half the cost - just 93 Euros pr. nite for 2 people w/o breakfast.

<Title>“Great location, great staff, we'd stay here again in a heartbeat!”
<Content>We were in Barcelona for just a couple days and this hotel was terrific. Unlike many hotels in Spain, the fact that my husband and I wanted to be in a double bed (without any split in the mattress) didn't mean we were confined to a smaller room. Location was terrific - close to the Ramblas, but felt safe. The best feature was the rooftop hotel pool. After a day of shopping (fab shopping within a few minutes walk) and sightseeing, it was the perfect way to spend the afternoon despite the fierce August heat. Kids loved it too. Hotel staff was lovely and spoke great English. Comfortable beds, quiet rooms despite proximity to major roads. All in all, a great experience.

<Title>“Great Choice!”
<Content>We had a great stay at the Hotel Jazz during our two nights in Barcelona. The hotel was very clean and had a modern theme. The staff were very helpful and professional. The rooms were very nice and even had an in-room sound system (mysterious buttons near the bed). The location can't be beat- just a few steps from the University Metro station and a few blocks off La Rambla. Breakfast was above average for European hotels based on my experience, and although the rooftop pool was small, it was perfect for cooling off in during siesta. I'd certainly stay at Hotel Jazz again.

<Title>“Great Hotel, Great Location, Great City”
<Content>Stayed four nights at Hotel Jazz. The hotel is modern and comfortable. The beds were great. Had super sleeps. Hotel is really really quiet. Location is outstanding and we were block and a bit form Il Corte Ingles. The metro is a the end of the block. Bela Luna Jazz club around the corner. Everything even the hop on hop off is at the end of the block. You could not have had a better location. The front desk staff very helpful and pleasant. Only thing I would say is computers were busy, so might have to wait for access. The fellow at the rooftop bar wasn't all that friendly, but everyone else made up for it. Would definitely recommend and stay again. Loved Barcelona. OH great shoe store Fosum?? steps away.

<Title>“perfect break!!!”
<Content>just returned from a 3 nights stay at hotel jazz!.no complaints at all,the rooms were perfect with a lovely big bed,the in room music system was so ideal for us as we are great music lovers and it played some lovely jazz music.we did'nt use the pool and we did'nt have breakfast at the hotel,but we did spend some time on the roof top and that was very nice & peaceful.the city itself is beautiful with so much to take in.we saw some dodgy looking characters on the street but never had any problems with pickpockets.my advise is to keep your wits about you at all times and you'll be fine.the locaton was excellent and the staff were so helpfull.would recommend this hotel to anyone and if we returned to barcelona we would most definatly stay here again!!!

<Content>Just back from a wonderful break in Barcelona. Hotel Jazz is just perfect - high standards, cleanliness, staff, all perfect. Great location, just a short stroll from La Ramblas yet nice and quiet. Would recommend highly. Only downside of Barcelona is the pickpockets, unreal, such ques in the Police Station, You could not be careful enough.

<Title>“Worthy of the high ratings its been getting!”
<Content>Hotel Jazz is a contemporary hotel located near the Plaza Catalunya in Barcelona. It is about a two minute walk to the Universitat train station with lines that take you to Sagrada Familia, the pier end of La Rambla, the trendy El Born area in a few stops. The hotel is surrounded by good places to eat, and is a short walk to the fantastic market La Boqueria off La Rambla. I like the look of this hotel. Very hip, very "today" in a thoughtful way. The rooms are of blacks and neutrals with little punches of color like red and orange. Loved the HUGE room numbers on the doors. Such a playful and quirky touch :-) The lobby is black and grey--small compared to traditional hotels but does the job! Who needs a fancy lobby. Staff are efficient, friendly and helpful. There are two computers offering complimentary internet access on the second floor where the restaurant/ bar is. There's no printer but front desk would be happy to print your document for you if you email it to their mailbox, at no charge to the guest. We never went to the bar of the hotel but did do breakfast there. Hotel Jazz breakfasts are really quite fabulous. I'd say they're above and beyond the typical breakfast fare! Dizzying array of options. There's hot and cold fare, grains and nuts, meats, eggs, omelets to order, fresh cut fruit and juices, coffee and tea, assorted pastries, assorted breads, olive oil dip and a wonderful light tomato puree of sorts to spread on the bread. Breakfast is served from 730 to 11 so it makes a wonderful, substantial brunch for those on a holiday who I guarantee will be finding themselves waking up late in the mornings. Though my husband and I share a king-sized bed back home I thought the standard double bed was comfortable for two people. Rooms have flat screen TV with cable, a hair-dyrer, a socket outlet with dual voltage for non-European made appliances in the bathroom. Did not see if wake up calls could be requested but we brought our own travel clock (our companions just used their i-phones for alarm clocks). There's a safety deposit box in the closet to store your valuables too. We enjoyed the rooftop pool. It is a small pool, certainly not for diving nor doing laps but again it does the job! Great for cooling off in the hot summer afternoons. Guests can enjoy it until about 9pm. The hotel rooftop has a bar area too that's open till midnight (If I remember right) and offers a nice breezy retreat for groups enjoying a game of bridge or another. Piped in music fills the air as you sip your Sangria or Cava planning your adventures for the next day! There is handicapped access in the lobby and even in the pool area. I can't find anything to complain about this hotel. I think Hotel Jazz is well-run, well-maintained, thoughtfully designed. Definitely worthy of the high ratings it has been getting since they opened a few years back.

<Title>“Fantastic Value. As good as the reviews say!”
<Content>I booked this hotel as a surprise Birthday trip for my husband following the great reviews on tripadvisor.co.uk and it more than lived up to expectations. Hotel Jazz is in a great location, just a couple of minutes walk from the top of Las Ramblas so ideally placed for exploring the city by foot. Hotel Jazz is modern, clean and great value for money. Our rate included breakfast which was a buffet style and good quality that included all the usuals. The highlight for us was the roof top pool and bar. We had some great weather whilst we were in Barcelona so there was nothing better than starting the evening with a glass of Spanish cava in the sunshine! I would totally recommend this place. 3 stars really doesn't do it justice!

<Title>“Perfect location, Comfortable Room, No Problems whatsoever”
<Content>After doing much research to find the best and most affordable Hotel in Barcelona, I decided to book the Hotel Jazz based on user reviews on this website. My husband and I were very pleased. We stayed from 8/19-8/22/09. The location is perfect. It is in a central location near Ramblas, and Plaza Catalonya. The employees at Hotel Jazz were very polite and helpul with our needs. the room was perfect. We stayed on the 4th floor and had no issues with Air Conditioning, cleaning service, etc. Beds were comfortable enough to get a good nights sleep. We would definately return to Hotel Jazz!!! We also stayed in Hotel H10 Raco de Pi in el Barrio Gotico (about 2 blocks from the center of Ramblas) from 8/22-8/24/09 and were somewhat pleased. The location is great, beds were ok, not as good as hotel jazz but good neough. Overall, We preferred hotel jazz! If you come to Barcelona, please take the Hop on and Hop Off Bus Tour! You will not be disappointed.

<Title>“Booked, confirmed and denied”
<Content>We booked this hotel due to the reviews on this site and the price, compared to others we considered. The hotel CONFIRMED our reservation twice via email the week prior to our one night reservation. When we arrived, we were told that due to “problems” we were being moved to Hotel Inglaterra for the same price we had booked Hotel Jazz. We were given the key to a VERY small room in that hotel that we could not even fit our luggage into. We then had to move all of our luggage to another larger room in that hotel ourselves. The lobby of the hotel Inglaterra was not air conditioned and it was always VERY hot. The rooms were both HOT when we checked in. The elevator was VERY slow and always hot. We found several staff less than helpful. They even tried to charge us for ice. I cannot recommend Hotel Jazz.. I felt that we were not appreciated as customers, as they CONFIRMED our reservation twice via email, then we had no room at Hotel Jazz when we arrived and were shown to another inferior hotel. I believe this was due to the fact that we had a one night reservation, as other people (probably with longer stays booked) were staying in Hotel Jazz. Hotel Jazz told us we could use their pool...gee thanks. Wait in the hot lobby of Hotel Inglaterra for the slow, hot elevator, go up and change into your swimwear, then do the same in reverse, walk across the street to the Hotel Jazz, where we were confirmed, but could not stay, swim in their postage stamp size swimming pool, pay for overpriced drinks at the pool bar and have the opportunity to do the same on the return trip to Hotel Inglaterra. I was not impressed in any way. I contacted the management when they emailed me to "thank us for our stay". The manager offered us a "big deal" upgrade if we return to Barcelona of a discount and upgrade to suite. This trip was the first night of a two week Mediterranean cruise vacation celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. We won't likely be going to do this again, as it was a “once in a lifetime” kind of trip for us.

<Title>“Excellent Location”
<Content>The Hotel is situated in a great place to explore the City. We fully intended to use Metro/Bus Turistic but found that we were able to walk comfortably to everywhere we wished to visit. The staff were helpful and friendly from the Reception to catering and cleaning. A comfortable room that was clean and well cared for. The only negative aspect was the music from the roof area was too loud on one evening. We did report to reception but nothing changed. It was however only one out of the seven we were there so no great issue. We did use have breakfast on a few occasions and it was pretty much what we had experienced at other Hotels in Portugal and Spain if a little expensive. Although previous reviewers had noted a rumble from the Metro this was occasionally felt but would not prevent me from staying at the Hotel again. I had read numerous forum reports on crime in Barcelona and arrived a little apprehensive. We did not see any evidence of crime although there was a suspicious character paying attention to my bag whilst in a queue for Sagrada Familia. I watched him closely and he moved away. We travelled through La Ramblas at least twice a day and did not feel in the least bit in threat of crime. Go to Barcelona a fantastic City and use this Hotel, you will not be dissapointed.

<Title>“Mother & Daughter”
<Content>Having stayed at a different Hotel in Barcelona last year I can thoroughly recommend this Hotel. Walking distance from main Placa Catalunya, where you can get dropped off from the airport by bus, the metro is also situated here, it's only a couple of stops for the Sagrada familie & Park Guell, also the buses run to the beaches. Lovely bar on top of Hotel to finish with a night cap. Also shoppers, lots of nice shops within walking distance. What more could a Mother & Daughter ask for!!! I thought it was quite nice to hear the rumbling of the metro, it made the Hotel seem alive.

<Title>“Great location, rooms and pool: surpassed my high expectations”
<Content>The reviews read on Trip Advisor were generally very positive so I was surprised that these high expectations were surpassed. Hotel Jazz is well located just 5 minutes from Placa de Catalunya and a minute from Placa Universitat. Both have metro stations and the Aerobus [bus transfer from Airport - 4.25 EUROS] can drop you off at the latter and and be picked up for the home journey at the former. The hotel is very modern and clean. It was also so nice to be able to chill out by the pool at the end of a day of sight seeing before going out of dinner and to also return there for a night cap. In August Barcelona was so so busy it was just lovely to retreat to the hotel pool and get away from the crowds. As reported before the sun beds do get 'reserved by towel' but there are plenty of chairs and tables around the bar. Breakfast was not included in our deal but there are places across the road eg D'Or or around the corner eg Starbucks. If you are planning to go to the Bari Gotic area then I would highly recommend having breakfast at "La Pallaresa" on the Calle Petritxol: hot chocolate, fab pain au chocolat!

<Content>The room was spotless and the bathroom fab. The pool is a plung-pool really, on a great roof-top - lots of space to sun worship or reading while having a drink from the bar on the roof -- it was more than we expected for the price. A 5 min walk from major tourist area BUT with none of the horrible tourist area noise - it was a real refuge from the heat and husstle.

<Title>“A great city break”
<Content>I would recommend the Hotel Jazz to anyone having spent 4 very enjoyable nights there during August with my boyfriend. We booked months in advance and got the rooms at a reasonable rate of about £90 per night although I noticed the rooms nearly doubled in price closer to the date. The location of the hotel is perfect, if you take the Aerobus from the airport (about 5 Euro's each) and get off at the Universitat stop it is literally a couple of minutes walk to the hotel. It is also only about 5 minutes walk to Las Ramblas and Placa De Catalunya where all the tour buses go from. The room itself was nice, my first impressions weren't great due to a broken lampshade which was stuck with sticky tape together. That aside the room was modern and clean and room service promptly cleaned every day. I did miss having no tea/ coffee making facilities although the fridge, safe and massive bed was an added bonus. The roof top bar in particular was a nice touch and the pool looked very inviting although I never actually got to take a dip! We stayed on the top floor (7th) and occasionally heard the Metro underneath although it did not disturb us. I recommend buying a two day Bus Turistic tour ticket from Placa De Catalunya. We did the red route on day one and blue the next for 27 Euro's each, which was ideal as we got to see all the major sights at our own pace. Initially we struggled to find nightlife but after two days finally discovered a strip of about 15 bars located on the bottom level at Port Olympic. There are also a strip of about 10 upmarket restaurants and bars along the beach front at Port Olympic which were nice with an added beach view. Drinks were very expensive everywhere. I thoroughly recommend visiting the Skky vodka ice bar on the beach front just for pure novelty value (it is -9 degrees inside, you drink from cups made of ice and are given fur coats and gloves to wear). You can't stay in too long because of the cold but it was fun and something different. Entrance is 15 euro's each and that includes a drink. Wasn't all that impressed by Ramblas. I think the crime topic is over-hyped slightly, there is a big police presence but we did see many suspicious characters and a scam in action with two female tourists so be aware/ alert and don't get into conversations with strangers who approach you. Overall a fab holiday, I would definitely recommend this hotel and Barcelona in general to anyone.

<Title>“Perfect”
<Content>Couldn’t believe my eyes as I walked in the door – it looked exactly like the photos on the website!!! The location of the hotel was absolutely spot on, around 3 or 4 minutes walk from La Ramblas. I had to keep reminding myself what we spent on the room as I was waiting for some hidden costs on check out but the rates were the best value for money I’ve spent on a hotel room ANYWHERE. Would totally recommend this to anyone, and already have. An excellent hotel, will definitely be returning. Only complaint - the lifts were slow and seemed to have a mind of their own but otherwise a perfect stay.

Catalunya square nearby where the open top bus tours leave from. 27 euros pp for 2 day pass, hop on/hop off, 3 routes around city. Rooftop pool is small but adequate. Some of the sunbeds are in need of repair and they could do with a few more but it was great to have somewhere to chill after a day out. No tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms but beds were very comfortable and the rooms/bathrooms were very clean and modern.

<Title>“First time in Barcelona ? hard to beat the Jazz”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz in 2007 and It's still going strong. A great location especially for first timers. Spacious rooms (we were upgraded to a junior Suite !) good friendly staff and a great (if a little small) pool on the roof. We didn't pay the usual extortionate breakfast prices, and there is a convenience store next door. The hotel is just by Placa da catalunya, this means all the tourist things are either walkable, or available from the bus touristic just round the corner. TIP ! get the Aerobus from the airport. Stops at university 2 min walk or Catalunya 4 minute walk. Much cheaper than a taxi ! Only seems to pick up from Catalunya on the way back though

<Content>We loved the Hotel Jazz. Would agree with most reviews here. It's perfectly located, clean, modern, quiet and a great price. I'm fairly picky when it comes to hotels but I can't fault this one. We stayed for 10 days and didn't have any problems during our stay. We didn't take breakfast but there were two or three places across the street that were sufficient including a starbucks if you like that sort of thing. We will return, and would reccomend to anyone.

The location is hard to beat being only a few minutes walk to the Placa Catalunya in the centre of the main tourist area. Rooms are always spotlessly clean and have very comfy large beds. The rooftop pool is lovely and the rooftop bar is a great bonus! Looking forward to returning for a 4th time.

<Content>I chose Hotel Jazz for the trip in July because of its location for I had been to Barcelona once. A lot of good reviews on Tripadvisor made it easy to decide. I was very satisfied when I arrived and even more when checked in. I made booking 4 months in advance requesting for a twin room on high floor but did not expect that my request would be satisfied. I got a room on 6th floor in the hotel front, very modern, quiet, clean and spacious enough for two persons. What impressed me most was the hotel staff. Good breakfast too. Will definitely stay at Jazz hotel again when visit Barcelona.

<Title>“Cool Jazz”
<Content>Booked this hotel after reading glowing reviews which I found to be totally accurate during our stay at the beginning of July. Rooms were great although not overly luxurious. Bed very large. Had to fix the TV myself as someone had connected it incorrectly! The first receptionist we asked information from was a little cool but the rest were great and very helpful - one directed us to a great tapas place around the corner..others were only too willing to book restaurants for us. Tremendous location just minutes away from Las Ramblas and the Bus Touristic main office. Rooftop pool deck was excellent although heavily used so you had to be lucky to get a sunbed in the late afternoon. We booked a room on the top floor after TA reviewers mentioned the Metro noise - and this was probably a good idea as you could detect a very slight rumble even on the 7th floor. Overall a great place to stay and amazingly despite its popularity it keeps the summer rates to around 100 euro a night - great value. And by the way Barcelona is the tops.

Be ware of the small showers, but I think that's more of a Europe thing. Perfect location and within walking distance to all the sights. If walking is not your thing, there's a metro stop a 100 meters away. The roof-top pool is also a great place to lounge away the afternoons. I wouldn't recommend staying anywhere else.

<Content>Hotel Jazz is in a really great location. Very close to metro. It's far enough away from Catalunya square and Las Ramblas to insulate you from the crowds, but everything is easily within walking distance. The hotel offers meals and has bar service. Alternative options for food/drink abound near by. The rooftop deck and pool area offer great views. Rooms are good sized and well appointed (except for a clock which was an issue all over Europe). Bathroom was nice (with tub). Nice step out balconies. Business area with free internet. Stoic, but helpful staff. It was all good...except the bed(s). We had a double twin room and the matresses were pitiful. They were completely broken down and extremely uncomfortable. Tried everything but wound up sleeping on the box to get some support. If we had been there any longer (just 2 nights before a cruise), I would have complained vigorously. We were in the second week of our European trip, so we'd done a lot of walking (Barcelona included). A comfortable bed is really important, and unfortunately the Jazz fell way short in that area. I would recommend the Jazz because of all it's upside...but would caution to check the mattress out immediately, and don't settle until you're happy. It may have just been our room...just beware; you'll need the rest.

<Content>Convenient to Metro station and within walking distance to many attractions if you enjoy strolling the city. Staff was friendly and helpful. Rooms clean and comforable. Some street noise, but to be expected being so central.

<Title>“Nice hotel and good location for exploring Barcelona!”
<Content>We chose the Jazz hotel based on reviews on different websites, it looked like a decent hotel in the photos, the reviews were positive and it seemed like a good location. The rooms are clean and modern, I like the trendy decor. The room is equipped with minibar, flatscreen tv, wireless internet connection (free!!), hairdryer.. The hotel has two bars - one on the roof terrace. There's a small swimming pool and sunbeds at the roof as well. Very popular and most sunbeds were taken by 11:00 AM (pool opens 10 AM). It is located close to Placa de Catalunya and La Rambla. There are good shopping opportunities in El Triangle shopping center, Passeig de Gracia and Ave. Diagonal, so it's an excellent location for shopaholics like myself. There were lots of restaurants and bars in the area as well, so no need to travel around the city to get a good meal! Very happy with the location of Hotel Jazz! I'll definitely consider Hotel Jazz if/when returning to Barcelona!

<Title>“Excellent Hotel at an Affordable Rate”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Jazz during our Honeymoon in July. We read wonderful reviews about this hotel and the reviews did not disappoint. First, the Hotel is near the Universtat so you have both bus and subway connections right around the corner from the hotel. Next, the location of the hotel cannot be beat as it is two to three blocks away from Las Ramblas so you are near the tourist areas without being surrounded by the chaos. Within the hotel, the pool and pool bar are a nice way to relax after a day of exploring Barcelona. Also, Internet services are provided for free on the first floor so that was a plus. The actual room itself was spacious enough for two people. Both the bathroom and bed were clean and decorated in a modern fashion. The price of the hotel is affordable and the hotel staff, especially those who work in the morning, provided us with very useful information for both in and around the city. For example, they told us about a beach city, Sitges, which is about a 30min train ride from Barcelona with incredible beaches in a safe and relaxing atmosphere. Overall, we were very impressed with the Hotel Jazz. We would recommend it to anyone who wants and affordable room near the center of Barcelona.

<Title>“Perfectly placed”
<Content>I've just had a whole week at this modern hotel and I have to say it was ideal. It is moments from Ramblas, the main shopping streets and the Placa Catalunya where you find the main tourist information site and transport links. The room was well appointed and always spotless. Ours was internal and with traffic noise almost constant in Barcelona, it was nice to be able to keep the window open undisturbed. The rooftop bar and pool area was a great refuge on the hottest days. Although the pool is tiny its fine for a refreshing dip mid-afternoon. The only slight disappointment was the cheap orange juice they served at breakfast, but we soon discovered that it worked out far better to skip the hotel breakfast, visit the most popular tourist sights without any queues and then grab a breakfast in a cafe afterwards. We hadn't paid for our breakfast upfront and found we even saved money this way.

<Title>“Excellent location”
<Content>The hotel is located just about 3 mins walk from Plaça de Catalunya and from the top of Las Ramblas. Our room was on the 6th floor (no noise from the metro) and was spacious with everything you would expect - safe, fridge, toiletries, and the best black out curtains we've ever experienced (leading to lots of lazy starts to the day). We were celebrating my husband's 40th and I was having some difficulty reserving a table from England before our trip with my lack of Spanish. I rang the Hotel Jazz and the receptionist kindly made the booking for me and sent me an email to confirm the reservation - very helpful. The hotel has a rooftop pool and bar and quite large sitting area, really nice for finishing off the evenings. We mostly didn't have breakfast but did on the last 2 days for about Euros 10 each. We thought this was good value for the choice and you can have omelettes freshly made too. All in a bit corporate, but great location and comfortable. A few tips: (1) We got the airport bus into the city and got off at the stop before Plaça de Catalunya - Plaça Universitat and this is slightly closer to the hotel. However, on your way back to the airport the bus only goes from Plaça de Catalunya direct to the airport. (2) We travelled to Montserrat using the Trans Montserrat combo-ticket (bought at the tourist info. on Plaça de Catalunya) and it was a great day - really recommend this as it's only an hour from Barcelona. (3) We ate at Pla restaurant in Barri Gotic and it was wonderful (have written separate review).

<Title>“Great location, not sure about the price”
<Content>Excellent location. Quiet but central. Friendly and helpful staff. Rooms modern and very clean (no kettle, no ironing board, no cable). Really more a great 3* than a 4* in my book. Rates we paid (in the height of the season) were certainly 4* so look out for good rates and you will not not regret staying here. Good breakfast. You can take the airport bus to Universiteit and you will be a minute from the hotel (cab will be quicker but cost 5X as much). Bar and swimming pool on roof. Free wifi.

Thank you to the ladies that took care of our room every day:) The location of the hotel is perfect for exploring different parts of the city.

Enjoyed relaxing on the rooftop patio with a glass of sangria and there is also a pool area. Attractive jazz bar on another floor which we did not have time to take advantage of. Close to Metro and several cafes. Would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“All the comforts of home”
<Content>Our family stayed at the Jazz Hotel for one night after coming off a 2 week cruise. The rooms were spacious, the beds were very comfortable, service was exceptional, decore is modern and clean looking. We had a couple problems when we checked in which were fixed quickly (no hot water, wireless internet connection). The water pressure in the shower was great and the water was as hot as you would want it to be. The front desk personnel were always helpful and on top of things. The pool is on the roof and was very clean. The hotel is located within walking distance to the Gothic quarter and near Barcelona University - lots of people watching in these areas. It is located above the Metro station so you get some vibration but it didn't bother me. Book it!

<Content>we stayed at hotel jazz for 1 night pre-cruise. the location of the hotel is perfect, with all the main attractions nearby. it's only a couple of min walk to la ramblas and plaza catalunya, and there's a bus station for the hop-on-hop-off bus within a block, in addition to the one at the plaza catalunya. we took a cab from parc guell back to the hotel for about 8 Euros, and the ride was about 10 mins. we stayed on the sixth floor but didnt hear any noise. the staff was also very helpful with our needs. There are two free computers with internet access for the guests on the second floor. I would definitely stay in this hotel again.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel For First Time Visit, Would Recommend to anyone!”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Hotel Jazz and was not dissapointed. The Hotel is located a 3 minute walk from the main center of Barcelona and the Ramblas. So an excellent location. It was my first trip to barcelona with my boyfriend and my first holiday abroad without my family so I was a bit nervous when setting out on my trip but after being there for a very short amount of time I felt right at home and the Jazz helped make my stay very enjoyable. The Jazz is clean and very modern with a smart front desk and mainly very helpful staff giving suggestions for things to do and places to eat (we only had a problem with one woman we found a bit rude when we first arrived). The rooms are spacious with all the mod-cons you could want (TV, Air-con, Safe, Fridge). There is a supermarket a short walk down the Ramblas where we bought bread, butter, cheese ect so we could make our own snack and drinks and the hotel were completly happy with us keeping our own food in the min fridge. The maid was also very helpful and gave us everything we could need for our stay. The Hotel also has a roof top pool, it is not massive but is perfect for a quick dip to cool down in the hot weather and there are plently of fresh towels and sunbeds for you to relax on. One thing that confussed us was the lighting in our room! We didn't realise that you had to insert a room key into the slot on the wall to activate the lights, tv ect! this is to save people leaving the lights on when they leave the room, a great idea, but someone should have told us on arrival!! We also managed to lock our safe incorrectly so that we could not open it again and when we called the frond desk someone came up straight away to sort it. Some people have mentioned the rumble you hear from the metro, they are right you can hear it during the day but it never disturbed our sleep or bothered us to much and we were on the 3rd floor so I imagine the higher you get the less you hear it. Overal a GREAT hotel and would happily go there again. Two tips for barcelona - to get the best rate in this hotel is to call the hotel and ask which nights are avaliable at there lowest rate of 95euros and to then book online because you get a 10% discount if you book in advance - Another is to ask at the front desk for discount vouchers as you get money off attractions and the Bus touristic (another thing well worth going on!)

<Title>“Clean and modern hotel, well located”
<Content>The Hotel Jazz is well located, just two blocks from La Rambla. There are plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants within a short walk of the hotel. There is also the University Metro station just a metres away from the front door. The room itself was clean and modern. The floors are wood (although the corridors are carpet) and the bathroom was well appointed, with shower over bath (with good water pressure). The TV was a little on the smaller size (although not too small) and it has CNN, BBC as english language channels, along with some other channels occasionally showing english programs. The air-con works very well also. There are two computers available for limited internet use also (on Level 1), which is a good touch. Although I have no major complaints, at least none that would keep me from staying in the hotel, there were few little things that I did notice. The noise in the hallway can be heard in the room. Also, you can occassionally hear the Metro pass under the hotel - this is not annoying, but you can hear it (or feel it?). It is a bit like a truck going past the building but different. There is no iron in the room and no daily paper. Again, these are not major complaints, but just observations. Overall, this is a very nice hotel and I enjoyed my stay. It is modern, clean and well located for seeing the sites of Barcelona. I would definitely stay at Jazz again.

<Content>We stayed at the Jazz overnight before a cruise. The location was excellent. The staff was accomodating and spoke English well. The rooms were very nice. We found the free computer/internet very useful, and we loved cooling off in the rooftop pool after our long flight. What a view! We also found the room rate to be very reasonable. We took the train from the airport and transferred to the subway. This was inexpensive using our T10 tickets, but we did have to carry our luggage up lots of stairs. We would definitely stay at the Jazz Hotel again. Thank you to the Jazz staff and owners.

<Title>“Great location, great hotel”
<Content>We just returned from our 40th wedding anniversary trip! We did the Celebrity Summit Mediterranean Cruise. It was aweseome! We started in Barcelona and spent almost two full days there before our cruise. We had a nother couple traveling with us. We all stayed at the Hotel Jazz and it was wonderful! The location is excellent and the staff helpful. They all spoke at least some English. The rooms were tasetful and very clean. Tip: they do not accomodate USA appliances, so be forewarned! The hotel is very close to Las Ramblas and La Boqueria as well as the bus stops and metros and even a Starbucks! The price was very good. We were able to take a bus from the airport to within an easy walking distance of the hotel and just pull our rolling suitcases. That amazed us, and the buses are equipped for the luggage. The hotel actually had our rooms ready for us at 9:30AM. However, they had told us they would store our luggage at that time even if the rooms were not available. The day of checkout they stored our luggage until we were ready to leave for the ship later in the day. They also secured a larger taxi so the 4 of us could travel to the port together. We had no complaints whatsoever with The Hotel Jazz.

<Title>“Good Hotel Though Quite Noisy”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel in June 2009 based on the very high ratings on tripadvisor. I was for the first time ever dissapointed in a hotel recommended so well by tripadvisor. While the rooms were very clean, quite large, the staff was exceptionally helpful, and its in the center of town. My one complaint (a pretty big one for me)...the metro noise! The hotel is located right on top of the metro station. We were on the second floor which no doubt made it worse, but every 10 minutes we could hear trains rumbling through the station and the entire room shook. Thankfully I think they stop about 1 in the morning so we got some sleep. If you are a light sleeper at all I would recommend you look at another hotel, or at the least make sure you get a room on the upper floors.

<Title>“the great location, a good stay with a few problems”
<Content>The location is perfect for tourists; close to Gracia and Catalunya, Univeersitat stations equally. You will need one full day for Montjuic (Jewish Hill)area. And, Bari Gothic(Old Town, Picasso museum, Roman wall, Dali) area, the east side of Rambla, for 1.5 days on foot, then another day for Eixample for Sagrada familia church and Casa Mila and others. And, one more day if you want to explore sitges beaches, or Parc Guell for an excursion. From the BCN Airport, the Aero Bus(Platform 2 for T2 Bus for British Air, 4.50 Euro-25 min.) drops you off or pick you up every 15min. at the East side of Catalunya Plaza(head to the northern side of the plaze and walk left) and The Jazz hotel is two blocks away(7 min.) in Green building with Alliantz Insurance Group plaza-7 min. walk. The local area is for University crowds(El raval) and it can be fun to watch the young in the streets. Luckily the annual club music festival was held in the small front yard of Museum of Contemporary Art when I visited there(Richard Meir, architect). And, that enhanced the spirits of the students and others of BCN. The three negative things during our stay were; First, the cleaning maid never leave the new shampoo or shower gel for 3 days and we had to be careful not to use up the tiny bottles. The front desk later confirmed that that had nothing to do with their eco policy. The wear and tear signs were eminent here and there but in general, it was all acceptable, better than Radisson or Holiday Inn or Courtyard ranges in room decors. The second is, there were two pickpocket attempts during our 3 night stay, approaching tourists at night and distracting one while robbing the other while hugging them or shaking hands while covering their acts with maps or jackets they carry. And, finally, Rambla is a real disappointment all the way to the waterfront. And, from the half way(Liceu station) to the Columbus column/water front, The street was filled with more African Prostitutes, who are often aggressive, than the strollers. And, I would advise any family with children not to visit this place at night. The noise/vibration from the hotel room on the 5th floor(516) was acceptable comparing its proximity to Universitat station( second building from the entrance, 100ft away) and the bed is comfortable without giving any back pain in the morning. I always felt well-rested. The AC actually works after 5 min. and upon check-in, I sweated a bucketful before the room was cool.(the outdoor temp for June was 28-30'C and very hot). In all, Jazz Hotel met my expectation and I would recommend this place to others for its ideal location and better than average features.

<Title>“Good all-rounder”
<Content>We travelled to Barcelona to celebrate my husband’s birthday and chose to stay at the Jazz as he likes contemporary hotels. It proved to be a good choice. The location is very good, handy for transport links and close enough to walk to many of the main sights. And having experienced the crowds on Las Ramblas, I was relieved we had not chosen a hotel there, as I really wouldn't have liked all that hustle and bustle every time I left/returned to the hotel. Yet the Jazz is only a five minute walk away from all of this - so ideal in my opinion. We took the airport bus and got off at Universistat (cost about 4 euros each) - this is only a couple of minute walk from the hotel. For the return you have to go to Placa Catalunya, approx 5 min walk away - and as this is the first pickup at least you'll get a seat - the airport buses were very crowded. We couldn't get a great room rate that many have spoken about, despite an exhaustive search, so ended up paying an average of £140 per night, room only - it was the Friday night stay that bumped up the price. However they did upgrade us to a corner room, a large room which consisted of a living area - sofa, table and chairs and separate sleeping area. There is a mini bar but no tea/coffee making facilities. The room is very contemporary in style; my husband loved it and thought it better than most 4 star hotels we've stayed in. I find the contemporary style rather bland - but that’s my personal taste - there was certainly nothing to complain about, contemporary, clean and in good condition. The bathroom was great - fantastic shower. I thought the toiletries provided were excellent for a 3 star hotel, although replacement of them was erratic, but I’m sure you only had to ask for more. We were on the second floor and although you could occasionally notice the rumble from the underground, it was only very slight and certainly wouldn't have disturbed our sleep. We also didn't notice any noise from the street. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel, there are plenty of little cafes around and the wonderful La bouqueria. There is a small rooftop pool and reasonable sized terrace. The pool was another reason why I'd booked this hotel, but in fact there was so much to see and do in Barcelona that we never got chance to use it. The roof terrace has great views of the city and is a nice place to have an evening drink. The hotel has a bar but it seems to close early - but I suppose you have to remember it is a three star. We found all the staff in reservations and reception to be very helpful and efficient. As it was our first trip to the city we used the tourist bus, which departs from Placa Catalunya (5 mins walk away). Although a bit time consuming, it allowed us a real feel for the city and I think we saw more than if we had been left to our own devices. One word of warning re Barcelona - pickpockets. I'd become a little bored with people mentioning the problem to me when I told them we were going to Barcelona. But I'm afraid they were so right - it is a real problem here. And you need to be aware all the time. We were able to alert someone who's purse was about to be stolen as she was getting on the bus from the airport. The thief disappeared but later as our bus pulled out of the airport we saw the same young women combing the queues for another victim. What a dreadful start to your holiday that would be. And from the top of the tourist bus we saw a similar situation in Placa Catalunya. So beware when you are queues or crowds. Now back to the hotel. My husband really loved it and I’m possibly being a bit mean with giving it a rating of 4 rather than 5. But for me it lacked a wow factor, and I find the contemporary style rather soulless. But personal decor taste aside this is a really good hotel, in a handy location with great staff. Would I recommend it to my friends - absolutely - particularly if you can get one of those great rates.

<Title>“Excellent hotel and location - a must for a stay in Barcelona”
<Content>Spent 3 nights at the Jazz first week in June. Its got a great location about 2 mins from Placa Catalunya and easy walking distance to La Rambla, shops, restuarants, bus tours etc etc. Rooms are large, modern, clean and a pleasure to stay in. Service was excellent and there is a buffet breakfast for those who wish to eat in the hotel - this is a bit expensive at E15.50 if you dont have a large appetite! The hotel has a pool and large terrace on the roof for relaxing and good views across the city. The rooms that over look the roads have very good double glazing and we were not distrubed by any outside noise. I would highly recommend this hotel - its the second time we have used it and would stay there again. If you are looking for restaurants try Citrus on Passeig de Gracia - good mediterranean food at a reasonable price and a nice location or the Thai Garden just off Passeig de Gracia on Diputacio. Qu Qu on Passied de Gracia is good for Tapas and watching the world go by.

<Title>“Great hotel at great price and centrally located”
<Content>Hotel Jazz is modern and minimalistic. We love it. It was a spacious double room with a large bathroom although that was secondary for us. The location was the primary reason we chose Hotel Jazz. We were next to Placa Catalunya and La Rambla. The hotel was highly rated and was my second choice but it will be a first choice next time we travel to Barca. Barca is really spread out but we walked to Casa Mila, La Sagrada Familia, La Boqueria and the marina from the hotel without any difficulty. Separate of the hotel stay - don't miss Casa Mila and dish out the 16 euros to go inside. It is a truly work of art.

<Title>“Nice Hotel, Pool Closed”
<Content>Hotel Jazz was a very nice and modern hotel. The decorations were very stylish, the bed was very big and comfortable, and the location was very convenient for traveling on the Metro, walking to La Rambla, and getting to and from the airport. Since it is above the metro, we could hear the distant rumbling of the train sometimes, but it was not very noticeable. After reading other reviews, we requested a room on the highest floor, which they gave us, and so train noise was not a problem at all. We had the breakfast on the first morning. It was nice, but definitely a lot of money for what it was. We decided to venture out of the hotel for breakfast every day after that. They had wi-fi in the rooms, but it was not a good connection and went in and out. The only major complaint I have about the hotel was that they closed the rooftop pool without giving us any notice. We stayed for three nights. The first night we decided not to use the pool because we were tired. When we went to use it the second day, there was simply a sign in the elevator saying it would be closed for the remainder of our time at the hotel. If they had given any advance warning, we could have used it on the first night, but instead, it was just closed. It was a huge disappointment since the rooftop pool was one of the features that attracted us to the place. But otherwise, we had a nice stay at a fair price.

<Title>“Convenient, trendy and clean hotel.”
<Content>A friend and I stayed at the Jazz Hotel for 4 nights and had a very nice stay. It is very centrally located (5 minutes from Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya where there is a metro station and the official tourist bus stop, lots of cafes etc.). The Aerobus from the airport cost 4.25 euros and dropped us about 2 minutes away from the hotel - the journey was only 25 mins. The hotel itself is very modern, looks brand new, extremely clean and quiet. We had a room on the 4th floor and there was no sound. My only complaints would be the rooms are decorated in dark brown colours which makes it quite dark, but the windows are large and it was sunny when we went so plenty of light entered the room anyway. Also, our shampoo and shower gel was never replaced and we had to ring reception for new ones every evening (one time they did not have any left). There was no mirror in the main room area, only on the bathroom door where there was very limited light so it was extremely hard to do make-up - take your own mirror! The pool on the roof was excellent, and there are two computers next to the bar area for free internet use. The room was spacious and the beds huge. The bathroom was also new and clean. We didn’t eat breakfast at the hotel as it was quite expensive (around 10 euros) and there are enough cafes nearby to buy things like a croissant, Spanish eggs and freshly squeezed orange juice for cheaper. If you want a homely feel, this hotel is probably not for you as it felt a bit impersonal, but otherwise it was good. Also very pricey unless you are able to negotiate a good deal.

<Title>“Great location, made the holiday what it was!”
<Content>I booked the Barcelona trip for my fiance's 21st birthday. It was a great surprise for him but the trip itself was even better! The hotel couldn't have been more perfect -in a great location for walking to everywhere or for catching the metro - metro right outside! This did mean you could hear it occasionally and the odd shake of the hotel - but i have to say, it did not disturb sleep, become annoying or disturb us in any way shape or form! The hotel was clean and modern. We discovered after the first night that there is a dial by the bed to turn jazz music on that you hear throughout the room and bathroom. Bed - yes it was two singles put together - but it made one HUGE bed that was seriously comfortable. The air conditioning was great and the blackout curtains were too - if we hadn't set an alarm we would have slept all morning because you can't see the daylight because the curtains were that great! We would definetly go back. We had no faults what so ever about this hotel! We didn't try out the pool although did sit on the roof terrace to eat and ice cream and watch the world go by :-) I'm now wishing i hadn't written this review as you'll all be there!

<Content>Just finished three nights at the Jazz and loved the hotel for its decor, cleanliness and service. Staff were always helpful and friendly.The hotel is a mere five minutes leisurely walk from La Rambla and the wonderful lively Barcelona crowds. I loved my stay in Barcelona and would strongly recommend the hotel to anyone.

<Content>This really was the best hotel for the money I've ever stayed in. The location was perfect, right in the center of everything and close to the bus stop for our trip from the airport and close to the metro as well. The room was very nice, modern and clean. The staff was very nice. The free internet and computers were a nice touch. The pool on the roof was very nice.

<Title>“In the Heart of Barcelona”
<Content>Hotel Jazz is an awesome urban hotel that's a five-minute walk from Las Ramblas and other popular attractions. You can also catch a bus from the airport that will drop you off two blocks from the hotel. The decor is modern and the vibe is hip. We stayed at the hotel on two separate occasions and on the second leg of our trip, the hotel upgraded us to a beautiful suite at the regular-room rate. Very cool. The hotel is also very close to one of the double decker city tour stops, which I also highly recommend doing. It's a cheap and easy way to experience all the popular sites around Barcelona.

<Content>This hotel was recommended to me by someone who lives in Barcelona. It is very modern and clean and pleasing to the eye as well as being comfortable. Brilliant value for money. The bar is very quiet but friendly bar man and free crisps!! Gorgeous pool on the top floor and towels provided.

<Title>“Great location and value”
<Content>Our five day stay at Hotel Jazz following a cruise was perfect. The hotel is two blocks from Las Ramblas, close enough to walk but far enough not to hear noise, one block from the on/off bus stop and within walking distance to major shopping and sites. The room was spacious, good closet space, comfortable kingsize bed, and all rooms are non-smoking.

<Title>“Great hotel, great location, great pool”
<Content>In one word: GREAT. We stayed in the hotel from 30th April till 3th May. We arrived late in the evening and it was just as we expected from this website and the website of the hotel. The room was very spacious, alot of light, good airconditioning and very clean. The bathroom was great, with a good working shower, everything was very clean and all the needed equipment was available. Enough towels, that were freshened every day. We were on the 2nd floor so we could lightly here the metro passing, but you had to listen very well to even notice it. Besided that the rooms were very quiet. We also loved the pool on the rooftop, after a warm day of walking through the city it was great to enjoy a fresh dip in the pool and the great view that came with it. We didn't use the breakfast because we found it too expensive and for half of the price you could get a very good breakfast across the street at "D'Or" or "Viena". Overall it was a great stay in a great hotel, i would definitely go there again for a next trip in Barcelona.

<Title>“Perfect”
<Content>Finding the hotel from the airport bus dropoff was a short walk and easy (I used google maps to get walking directions and looked at the street views before arriving). It's a great location for walking around the old city areas. The rooms were clean, quiet, good size, perfect. The pool on the roof is attractive (but April is too cool for me to go swimming). The hotel offers the quality room I wanted, in a good location, at a good price.

<Title>“"Excellent"”
<Content>We stayed in Hotel Jazz for three nights from March 12th, 2009 and we were very pleased. The hotel is in a perfect location not far from Placa Catalunya. We took the bus from the airport and got off beside Universidad Metro Station, the hotel is just a vew minutes from there. Rooms are quite modern, bright and clean, with enormous beds. Air conditioning came in very handy as we were very lucky with the weather which was sunny and around 21 degrees during our stay. The room also has a roof top pool with fantastic views. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful and they all spoke English which is a bonus. Breakfast was not inlcuded in the cost but is available for 15 Euro per person which we considered quite expensive. There are plenty of cafe's where you can have breakfast but if you want to experience the real Barcelona go to the "Boqueria" which is a large and very colourful market just off La Rambla, we ate breakfast there and it only cost 12 euro for both of us. There are numerous restaurants to chose from but one I would heartily recommend is Cafe Academia which is situated in the Gothic district. Friendly staff and excellent service along with wonderful food made for a very enjoyable evening. One restaurant we were disappointed with was "Siete Puertes" situated near the Port. Service was way to fast for our liking with each course being served almost as the previous plates were cleared. My husband asked for his steak to be well cooked and he was told he should have the veal instead. He then settled for a medium steak but when it arrived it was raw. For service and value for money Cafe Academia is far better. This was our second visit to Barcelona and we still can't wait to go back again. There is just so much to see and do that you would never be bored. Carmel Shanahan Dublin

<Title>“Great Hotel, Perfect for Exploring Barcelona”
<Content>Located a stone's throw from the Placa de Catalunya, this 3 star hotel looks and feels more like a 4 star. Modern decor and light spaces mean it feels spacious, staff are extremely friendly and professional and it is immaculately decorated throughout with large rooms and bathrooms. The breakfast provides more than sufficient options for most people (this is probably the part that is 3 star rather than 4) and the quality of the food was fine. You can explore the Rambla, Port and Eixample areas easily on foot and shops, bars, restaurants and transport links are all nearby. The windows onto the balcony are also well sound proofed, so even though it is on a busy street, the noise level is minimal. The swimming pool on the roof is a nice added bonus and for less than £100 per night, I wouldn't search any further for a hotel in the city.

<Title>“It was simply FABULOUS”
<Content>Hotel Jazz does it for me! We paid 101 Euros per night for 4 nights from April 1 to 5 at this hotel. This did not include breakfast but it doesnt bother me, we never like eating in hotels anyway. We stayed at Room 606. We checked in early and they were able to put us up in the room. The hotel is located by the Universitat Metro stop at Plaza Catalunya. This location cannot be beat. You are 5 mins away from the Ramblas. I don not recommend staying along the Ramblas at all. From this location you can walk everywhere. There are other hotels in this area such as Chic and Basic Tallers (we stayed here for one night see my review on this) , Hotel Inglaterra which just faces Hotel jazz. Enough of the location, its great first time tourist location. The hotel is very modern and contemporary when you walk in the lobby. The room they gave us was simply BEAUTIFUL. Other than the hotel in Munich, I don’t think I have stayed in such a beautiful room. Its like a one bedroom apartment minus the kitchen. It had 4 balconies, yes 4, it was all around. You walk in a hallway then you see a sitting room where there is a couch and a chair and a small desk with two chairs. A gray wall partitions this to the bedroom area and bathroom. Oh how I wanted to stay longer. The room itself is perfect 10. You want space, you got it! It really puts even the Park Hyatt rooms or Four Seasons Rooms to shame. Now about the noise, we were on the sixth floor and you really cannot hear the metro, maybe in the still of the night and you are really listening to it. I am an extremely light sleeper and on the weekends, Friday and Saturday night, you will hear people screaming in the streets and just plain old drunk. This was the only noise that I heard, I guess the soundproofing cannot take care of that. I just used my earplugs. But this will not deter me from staying at this hotel at all. There is a complimentary computer on the second floor that you can use. There are only 2 and I swear you have these young English girls who use these computers to check out their myspace or facebook pages and pictures etc. I had to say something one time coz it was very inconsiderate. They were there for like half an hour and on both machines. There was one guy in the front desk who was extremely helpful, I forgot his name. He is in the morning shift. Everything in this hotel is wonderful. I have very few 5 star ratings but I think this one deserves it.

<Content>My friend & I stayed at the Jazz hotel in early March (sorry about the delay in writing review).We found it to be the perfect location, just off La Rambla.We were offered a choice of rooms on arrival,ie a quite room to the back of hotel,or room with a view to the front of hotel.We opted for quite room, on 7th floor & got great nights sleep every night(4 nights). The room was very spacious & bathroom also had bath with shower.So we were ready to embrace the world early in the morning.The staff on Reception were very friendly & greeted us every time we entered the hotel.Would have no hesitation in recommending it to my friends.

<Content>My partner and i stayed at the hotel jazz on the 24th march and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is in a perfect location 2 minutes from the Ramblas and just outside a main subway station, it is central for everything. The hotel is really modern and clean and is more like a 4 star than 3 star. The only complaint I would have is that our room was facing the main road and was quite noisy..you can also hear the subway (we were on floor 2) but we were well prepared with earplugs and it is a city after all.. (request an high floor)..other than that it was perfect and Barcelona is fantastic!!

<Title>“Would definitely return to Hotel Jazz”
<Content>Picked this hotel for its no-smoking policy and the TA reviews. Very convenient to airport bus, Ramblas, Metro, although we walked almost everywhere other than when we took the Tourist Bus. Would have appreciated conditioner (someone else mentioned that too.) Decor so dark that room felt a little cave-like, but since we were out and about it didn't matter too much. No noise problem, bathroom new and sparkling clean, bed acceptably comfortable (never did get used to those long skinny Spanish pillows, tho), and the staff very friendly and helpful. Good internet access.

<Title>“absolutely perfect!”
<Content>I took my boyfriend here for a romantic weekend away and I cannot fault the place! Usually my boyfriend always has some small complaint about something and even he could not fault it. I booked the hotel directly through their website and mentioned that it was our anniversary and when we arrived (it's very easy to find once you have your landmarks sorted!) they had upgraded us for free to a Junior Suite! It was amazing. We had three huge doors that opened out (we were on the 3rd floor) so we had a great view on the hustle and bustle of below. We didn't hear any street noise that bothered us other than the RAC that have sirens like police cars. Breakfast ran until 11am and they have a good selection and a real toaster (not many places seem to have these nowadays!) and the coffee is good (although if you like starbucks there is one very close by) Las Ramblas is literally 5 mins walk away (if you can get passed Zara without taking a quick peep lol) We also had a few drinks in the bar before and after heading out for dinner and you have to try the Cocktail Jazz! We took a look at the pool on the 9th floor but were too busy sighseeing to take a dip although it did look inviting! And the view from up there is pretty special too! This really is a special place in Barcelona and we'll definitely be back for our anniversary next year! Thank you Hotel Jazz!

<Content>Me and my spouse spent a romantic week in Barcelona and Hotel Jazz was a great choice. Location could not have been better, our room & bed were spacious, staff was wonderful and breakfast ran till 11am. I was reading from earlier reviews about the traffic noise, yes you get some of that, but that cannot be avoided in Barcelona. Streets are full of life so if you need dead quiet during the nights get a hotel in the country. Truly want to thank wonderful staff for great time!

<Content>Ideal location 2 minutes from the Plaza Catalunya (and 25 mins to get back from the match at the Nou Camp). Rooms are spacious, modern and clean - very nice bathrooms. When we booked the Pound to Euro conversion made it a £110/120 a night hotel which it most certainly is.....by the time we went the crashing pound brought the cost in at around £150 a night - I'd normally expect something 'extra' for that but all in all I still wasn't dissapointed.

<Content>I picked the Hotel Jazz based on reviews on this site and was not disappointed. The hotel was in a great location - 5 minute walk from Las Ramblas and 5 minute walk from Placa de Catalunya where you can get the airport bus. I would recommend getting the bus to and from the airport, alot cheaper and just as easy as taxi. Hotel was very nice, rooms where immaculate and spacious and the staff where helpful. Did not eat at the hotel as we thought it was a bit expensive, just used the Starbucks which was 2 mins away for breakfast and there was loads of cafe/restaurants around for remaining meals. Really enjoyed Barcelona and recommend the Hotel Jazz to stay in.

<Title>“Excellent”
<Content>My friend and I stayed for 3 nights at Hotel Jazz based pretty much on the excellent reviews and price. We took a taxi from the airport - 28 Euro, but as many people indicate the hotel is very very close to Cataluyna which serves buses and metro. If you do decide to take the bus, get off at Catalunya, walk toward the big shopping centre called "Triangle" and then past it so its on your right, keep going, past Starbucks and the hotel is just after a chinese resturant on the right hand side. The entrance is in a small paved area just off the street. The walk will take you about 5 mins max. I cannot praise this hotel enough, staff very friendly and helpful, rooms clean and spacious, great shower, comfortable bed. Roof patio is lovely, gives you a sense of space and being away from the city. The pool is small, but hey its a pool! Breakfast (buffet style) available for 15 Euro which i thought was a little steep but it was lovely food and we ended up taking it as it was easy and it set us up for the day. The best part of this hotel ? Its location is simply perfect. You are in an area that feels safe, and its close to pretty much all you need. We walked everywhere from this hotel. Ramblas is 5 minutes (our least favourite street in city as is simply all about tourism, i guess all cities have one) the beach area is 25-30 minutes walk. Dont be afraid to explore this gorgeous cultural city and wander and get lost in ts narrow streets, you'll find hidden gems! Hotel jazz is the perfect base to begin and end your days exploring, eating and soaking up the chilled out but vibrant Barcelona! If I have to find negatives then they are minor: Yes you hear the metro at night, a low rumble but its gone away after a few seconds and wont come back for 10-15 minuets or so. Really didn't bother us much at all. No tea / coffee in room. Thats it. Bascially this hotel is a must if you are looking for a friendly, unassuming, clean, modern comfortable central hotel in Barcelona. I would stay again

<Title>“Great location, rooms, pool and friendly staff”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here for two nights prior to our NCL Jade cruise. Couple of questions before arrival were capably handled by email by Francesca and Daniel. (Front desk staff are young professionals and very helpful.) We took the 4 euro bus from the airport to the Universidat stop, 100 meters from the Hotel Jazz, but the hotel is angled a bit and not immediately seen. The hotel is wonderfully located and an easy walk from Placa Cataluna (where the tourist buses are), Las Ramblas and anything else you need. The rooms are spacious, clean, quiet and had a fine view from our small balcony (6th floor). We had a time trying to turn on the lights until the maid showed us how to put our room card into the slot device by the door. Rooftop pool is nice and has a great city view. Two computers for email plus wifi. We booked our room thru the hotel site, watched the euro float a bit and re-booked when the hotel rate went down to 101 euros (from 115). We had a fine dinner with the locals at the Balmes 12, a rather nondescript place nearby. Take a right as you exit the Jazz, turn right and go one block. It's just across that street. Menu del Dia (first plate, second plate, dessert and a drink) for about 9 euros and tasty. Good folks too. Gaudi's Sagarda Familla Cathedral should not be missed ! Cab to the ship from the hotel was 16 euros. Have fun. Fine hotel, great city.

<Title>“Fab stay at the Jazz”
<Content>Hi. My wife and i Stayed in the Hote Jazz in Barcelona for three nights on 22nd February 09. The whole experience was excellent from the simple pleasant check in to the beutiful bedrooms.We were offered two singles or an extremly large double bed and our request for a low floor was met with the option of an inside or street side room. We oppted for the inside room for quietness. Some people had commented on a noise from the underground train but to be honest it was no more than a distant four second rumble and nothing you would really be aware of.Certainly no sleep lost over it. The location of the hotel was second to none as the Rambla and Gothic old quarter were but a gentle five minute stroll away and we were well directed by the at all times pleasant staff. Lots of restaurants also but as in most large cities it is expensive and not helped by the weak pound at the moment{best we managed was 107 euro for £1}. Having said that there are some very tasty kebab shops if that is your fancy which are not expensive. Dont be scared to wander down the many side streets where you will find some lovely little boutiques with very reasonable prices. All in all Barcalona is a wonderfull city for culture , buildings, street art and much much more. One tip check your taxi price if you decide to get one from the airport.It should be 20-25 euro. Peter and Noreen. N.Ireland.

<Title>“Fantastic in every way”
<Content>I booked directly with the hotel based on positive reviews on Trip Advisor. Wow!!! So clean and spacious. Nose from streets/metro was not a problem at all. We slept with the sliding balcony door and we didn't hear a thing. Staff was very friendly and efficient. Housekeeping: unfortunately, they do not provide conditioner but offer everything else, eg. toothbrush, shoe mitt, comb, razor. Floor is made of hardwood, which I found a lot better and cleaner than carpet. Location: it is close to EVERYTHING. We pretty much walked everywhere, even Catalan Art Museum and Parc Guell!!! But if you want to take the metro, there are stations all over the place. It's only a 10-min walk to the Boqueria market, where we had potato omelettes and espresso every morning. There is a Starbucks nearby, but come on, you're in Bacelona! There are also shops everywhere along Las Ramblas, for clothes, souvenirs, wine, etc. Price: very reasonable. I thought it was a steal of a deal for the cleanliness and location. Highly recommended.

<Title>“Perfect boutique hotel”
<Content>I went with three friends to the Hotel Jazz for 5 nights in late July 08, to celebrate a birthday. We booked it based on the price, location, and excellent reviews on this site, and were not disappointed. It is a lovely boutique hotel i.e. it's reasonably small, well-finished and with the facilities you need for a city break. The hotel is immaculate. The rooms are spacious, the beds comfortable, and the bathrooms lovely, with decent showers, lots of towels, and a hairdryer. I saw another review on here that said the lack of mirrors in the main bedroom was annoying. I know what they mean, but there is one in the hallway and another big one in the bathroom. Fine for two girls getting ready for a night out, so I think that's quite telling. The air-con is great, because you can control it from your room to get the right level, and it does get very hot in Barcelona in July! We used the roof-top pool, which is a wonderful treat. It's not a massive pool, but it's all you need to cool off. There are free sunbeds, and decking, as well as a roof-top bar, so you can order sangria or a beer and drink it by the pool, looking over the city. There is also another bar downstairs, which has a good selection of spirits and friendly barmen. We didn't take breakfast in the hotel, but there are lots of shops and cafes within walking distance. In general, the hotel is everything you need for a city break, and it's very cool and relaxing after the buzz of Barcelona. It's close to everything you need - Las Ramblas, the metro, and the Gothic quarter. There are lots of lovely little cocktail bars and restaurants tucked away in the streets around, so I would say get out the first evening you get there and see what you come across. I would whole-heartedly recommend this hotel to any one looking for a city break in Barcelona.

<Title>“Ideal location for short trip to Barcelona”
<Content>Recently stayed in the Jazz hotel while on a short break to Barcelona. The hotel is well located just off La Rambla, 2 mins from the metro and bus stops. I found the staff to be very professional and friendly. Our room was located on the 4th floor and we did hear the metro (as mentioned in other reviews) at times but it did not cause us any problems the rumble only lasts a couple of seconds, and we did not hear it at night, so do not let that put you off staying in the Jazz. you can always request a room on a higher floor. I found the bedroom and bathroom to be both a good size and spotlessly clean. The bathroom has modern fixtures and is well stocked with toiletries. The bedroom had a huge comfortable bed, plenty closet space, a safe, large t.v. (dvd available to rent) and a mini bar, beware quiet expensive. The room has climate control which was lovely because sometimes hotel rooms can be very warm and stuffy. My only fault with the hotel is that there is no hospitality tray and it is nice to be able to make a cup of coffee after a long day sightseeing. However there is a starbucks and many other places for take away coffee on the doorstep, also, there was a very strong smell of smoke in the room on our arrival. We did not have breakfast in the hotel because it was quiet expensive and I was glad of that because we discovered La Boqueria a food marked located off La Rambla you must visit there. We had breakfast in one of the many tapas bars located in centre of the market on a couple of mornings and it was great. Lovely omelettes, fresh bread and freshly brewed coffee for €5 each. Barcelona is a great city to visit I would recommend that you do your homework before you go because there is so much to see and do so that you do not miss anything. One thing the metro system is difficult to use, and signage to some attractions are non-existent. I would think the tourist buses are best for getting around, and seeing the sight. You must visit the Gothic area. Look out for Milk a lovely cafe. Barcelona has an abundance of small bars and restaurants.

<Title>“A Little Gem”
<Content>My Wife and I had a four night stay for the weekend of St. Valentines, Could not fault this hotel, rooms were great for size and comfort the blackout curtains and most comfortable six foot bed made for a great nights sleep after a long day exploring the city, Breakfast in the morning was lovely excellent choice and loads of fresh coffee to go with it. Unfortunately I had work to do while here but the wi fi Internet connection in the room was great and meant I was able to complete the e-mails I had to send easily and with utmost speed. We had a meal in a restaurant just along the Via Catalanes at an Argentinian Steak house called Patagonia Beef and Wine, Absolutely outstanding Quality and service highly recommend this. Occasional Rumble heard from the Subway but never bothered either my wife or I

<Title>“Perfect stay in Barcelona”
<Content>I stayed here in late December of 2008. The hotel is very conveniently located right near Pl. Catalyuna and Las Ramblas. It costs a little over 4 euros to take the shuttle from the airport to Pl. Catalyuna and is about a 30-40 minute journey. Pl. Catalyuna is also the main drop off and pick up point for the Bus Turistic. The rooms were really nicely decorated with a modern feel and were incredibly comfortable. The rooms are also equipped with a small fridge. The staff was very helpful in answering any questions I had and were well versed in English. There are a couple of computers located on the 2nd floor of the hotel where the bar is at with free internet use. Personally, I had no issues with the rumbling of the metro as our room was located on the 10th floor right below top floor with the pool but I can imagine it being a nightmare for people staying on lower floors.

<Title>“Believe the hype!”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz at the end of January, I booked it after reading the positive reviews on this website, we only paid £100 a night and was very impressed with what we got for our money. The hotel is only about a 15/20 min taxi ride from the airport (costs about 20 to 25 euros) we booked into reception quite early as we had an early flight; check in was speedy and the receptionist was friendly and polite and the room was already ready for us. We had a room on the 6th floor (room 612) it was modern and spacious. It was also very clean, something I cant say for some of the hotel rooms we’ve visited over the years! I’ve uploaded some photos of our room so please judge for yourselves!! And we didn’t notice the metro noise at all, although as mentioned by others perhaps this was because we were on one of the higher floors. The location of the hotel is also another major plus point, it has 2 metro stops within easy walking distance, it’s also a stones throw from the Plaza Catalonia and Las Ramblas. Infact we walked from the hotel to the seaport, a lovely walk looking at the shops and the market on the way! As our stay at the Jazz was all too brief we didn’t have time to use the rooftop swimming pool (plus it was a bit to chilly for our liking anyway at this time of year!). All the hotel amenities looked great i.e. the bar and breakfast et al. We found a lovely little place to eat lunch and snacks just over the road from the Jazz called the Vienna café; I’d definitely recommend popping in if you get the chance! All in all I’d certainly recommend the Jazz to anyone who asked me about it and when we go back to Barcelona we will be staying at this hotel again.

<Title>“Very Nice Hotel..would come again”
<Content>I was recommended this hotel by a friend and was really glad we took his advice, really nice hotel-fab location, close to Las Ramblas, metro, shops etc. Rooms were spatious and clean, lots of hot water & soundproof windows. A lot of the reviews mention that you can hear the metro, we were on floor 7 (top floor) and we could hear it slighty but this did not bother us at all. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and we had a really good stay, i would totally recommend this hotel to others.

<Title>“Jazz Lived Up to Good Reviews / Preferential Location”
<Content>We spent three days at the Barcelona Jazz in January 2009 prior to a cruise. Our experience was good in every regard and lived up to previous positive reviews. The basics: the rooms (2 rooms for four of us) were in excellent condition and extremely clean upon our early morning arrival. Since we had asked for two rooms close to each other, they were not able to provide both rooms so early in the morning. They did provide one room with promises that when the second room close by was available they would provide us with access. They delivered on the promise. The rooms are modern and of average size for European hotel rooms., not as large as typical American hotel rooms but certainly not small. As requested, one room had a queen bed and the other had two twins. Each room had a flat screen LCD TV, a comfortable sitting chair and a chair/desk. Internet was available and the wi-fi signal was strong. I believe they also had ethernet available. A safe was provided in the ample-sized closet. The rooms had full functioning doors rather than windows but neither room had a balcony so the doors were for ventilation only. The bathroom was clean, modern and well-supplied. The heating worked well when used. Although any view from the hotel (we had two of three sides covered with corner rooms!) are of streets below and certainly not scenic, the location was excellent. This was not our first trip to Barcelona so we knew we wanted to be close to La Ramblas and Playa Catalanya. This hotel fit the bill. It is two blocks off La Ramblas and on the main boulevard for Playa Catalanya in a well traveled area. We felt no qualms about late night walks to/from the hotel. We took the non-stop Aero-bus from the airport to Playa Catalanya for four Euros and easily walked the two blocks to the hotel with our rolling luggage The front desk service was friendly and helpful. Check-in was quick, rooms as promised and they set up a requested departure van for us that arrived at the requested time. They were also very helpful with tourist information and directions. We found the subway system more difficult to navigate than other cities but stations for several lines are located within a one block radius. Cannot comment on hotel restaurants/bars as we did not make use of either on this trip. Numerous restaurants, bars and shopping are all around and/or within easy walking distance. Even a Starbucks on the next block for those who can't leave it at home! We did not encounter any of the subway noise mentioned in previous reviews but we are all sound sleepers. There was occasional street noise that could be heard (sirens/horns), alhtough nothing that woke us. Would recommend this hotel and will use it again if we visit Barcelona.

<Title>“Jazz hits the mark in Barcelona”
<Content>Belated review of the Hotel Jazz – my wife and I stayed here for three days during April 08. I can echo most of the sentiments of other reviewers – great bedroom with a huge number on the door – most unique – and very comfortable furnishings. If you want breakfast find one of the many cafes nearby for pastries, coffee etc – we certainly were not going to spend Eu30 on breakfast at the hotel (hence the loss of star). Swimming pool / sun area on the roof was very nice (even in April) – the hotel provides towels which is most useful – and the views are very interesting. Location is perfect – five minutes from the Placa Cataluña (for the Aerobus) – and La Rambla for the evening stroll. Just be aware – if you buy a beer on La Rambla shop carefully or you might find yourself out of pocket. There are a number of good local bars and restaurants within a minute walk from the Hotel – take some time to explore these. Very distant rumbling of the tube trains – we did not find this an issue at all (so don’t be put off by the negative reviews). Check in / out as you would expect. Nice hotel - we would recommend it and will probably end up staying there again on our next trip to Barcelona.

<Title>“Very good for a city break”
<Content>I like the hotel Jazz. Location is brilliant - very central and less than 5 mins from the flipping Ramblas. I like the staff too, they were helpful and willing. The hotel is contemporary in a fairly understated. I'd best describe the style and the bedrooms as simple. Simple is good, and the price of this hotel is excellent value for money. If you want to have a lavish or special treat away with a loved one in luxury where the hotel is as, if not more, important than the location then this hotel is probably not for you. If you want a weekend away where you are perfectly located for exploring the city, in a very comfortable and clean modern hotel then i reckon you'd struggle to beat this for value.

<Title>“Loved this hotel”
<Content>My husband and I arrived at this hotel on New Year's Eve and stayed for 5 nights. We got the bus from the airport - cost was euros 7.20 for both of us return and the stop was a two minute walk from the hotel. This hotel is ideally situated for exploring Barcelona - a short walk to Playa Catalunya and Las Ramblas. Our room was spacious and immaculate with lovely bed and bed linens and a really good bathroom with lots of toiletries etc. There were no in room facilities for making tea but that was not a problem. The hotel is quiet - other reviewers have mentioned the noise from the metro underneath - we were on the 4th floor and it was nothing more than a very distant rumble - did not cause any annoyance either during waking hours or when asleep. The staff in reception were both pleasant and helpful. If visiting Barcelona again I would not hesitate to return to this hotel.

<Title>“Another good stay at the Jazz”
<Content>We ended up going back to the Jazz again for a four night stay. We spent a few nights here in 2006 and liked the hotel, and decided to give it another go. The location is brilliant, right in the middle of everything, but still quiet and undisturbed. The facilities are good, although one could tell that the hotel has now been running for five years and starts showing some slight signs of wear and tear. We paid about 500 euros for four nights including breakfast. This is reasonably good value compared to other hotels, but still somehwat high considering that the hotel seemed awfully quiet despite visiting during the holiday season. The breakfast facilities are Ok, and if you get breakfast included for less than the 15 euros per night per person the hotel charges, I would recommend it. However, it is not worth paying 30 EUR/ day for two people. The breakfast buffet is average, and gets somewhat limited after a few days. We had to fight to avoid having skimmed milk with our morning coffee, and it took a lot of arguing before we got our coffees they we wanted to have them. The staff overall is very unobtrusive, somewhat aloof, but polite and correct. Overall, I would recommend the Jazz to other travellers.

We have traveled to major European cities for years, and the Hotel Jazz was one of the best. Ask the front desk for the coupon for the tapas place around the corner, where we used it for drinks on the house!

<Title>“It is that great!”
<Content>We booked this hotel on the strength of a personal reccomendation and the wealth of good reviews on this website. We were not disappointed. We spent a week here over the Christmas period and it was perfect for our needs. Check in was efficient and I was very pleased when we were able to check in early (at 8:30am)! we were not expecting this and welcomed the chance to have a nap following our sleepless night on the overnight train from Paris. The room itself was very spacious (room 604) and looked out onto a busy shopping street. With the door shut the thick double glazing did its job and we could hardly hear the street. The bed as others have stated is MASSIVE and is two large singles / queens zip and locked together. The wardrobe was equally huge and we had a niced dressing area near the bathroom. The fixtures and fittings were modern and contemporary and we particularly liked the unusual wall and floor coverings. Being on the 6th floor we felt nothing of the metro system underneath the hotel but sat in the bar on the 1st floor you could feel it - which could be a contributing factor for the low prices in this quality hotel. We got a room rate of £88 on expedia which we were pleased with. The roof terrace is a peaceful haven in the city and on christmas day we sat in the sun by the pool on the sun loungers and it was just blissful. I tried to swim but it was too cold! It would be fab if the pool was heated in winter but there you go. The bar was useful for a quick drink before heading out and for using the internet. It was fairly empty though. We had the spanish omelette and the pizza in the bar but there are more interesting places to eat in the city. There is also free wifi in every room though and we made good use of this. The staff we came across were pleasant. efficient and polite but not effervescent. Fine for our needs. We had no problems with room service, the room was spotless every day. The bathroom was clean and the hot water plentiful. The hotel in general is very warm but each room has its own aircon so within minutes you can be icy cool! We didnt take breakfast in the hotel but there is a supermarket just down the street and starbucks too which was open even on Christmas day. As others have said we couldnt fault the location, very close to La Ramblas and Place De Catalunya from where you can get the opentop bus, airport bus, and there is a metro station right outside the hotel. I can't reccomend this hotel enough. We would definately stay again and even after staying 1 week in Barcelona we would return, there is so much to see and do.

<Title>“Not that great!”
<Content>Well, not as great as we had expected. The taxi in from the airport was about 25 euros and the hotel was easy to get to. The location is very central with a short walk to La Rambla and good shopping. Check in/out was fine nothing exceptional and the front desk tried to be helpful with directions etc. Our biggest disappointment was with the room... dirty bed sheets. Not what we would have expected for a hotel as well rated as this one. We only stayed one night and that was just fine with us. Not a bad hotel but we are sure there are better in Barcelona.

<Content>We selected Jazz Hotel based on the reviews that we read from the TripAdvisor website. We were not disappointed. it was a great hotel. 5 mins walk from La Rambla and Catalynya Plaza. Near enough and yet away from the crowd. The design is contemporary, the room sizes generous and the bathroom big and clean. We stayed at Jazz for 4 days, left some bags in the luggage room, and check out to explore Sevilla and Granada before returning to Barcelona and re-checking in to Jazz. On the return leg, it felt like coming home. It really felt that cosy.

The rooms are immaculate and very modern and the beds were very comfortable. We didn't opt for the breakfast since there are many choices in the surrounding area. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel in Barcelona.

<Title>“Excellent location; amazing bathroom!”
<Content>Stayed at the Hotel Jazz in Barcelona for the last three nights of October 2008. We were generally impressed by the hotel. It is in an excellent location, the rooms were clean and modern, and the bathroom was by far the best bathroom I have ever seen in a less than five-star hotel! They had one computer available for free use, although it could be difficult to find an opportunity to go online. Our only slight complaint was the price of the breakfast (which was not included in our room price) which we felt was too high. They recommended a tapas bar which we enjoyed so much we ended up eating there on all three nights!

<Title>“Super hotel!”
<Content>4 of us stayed at the Jazz late November for a weekend and can thoroughly recommend this hotel. Rooms are large and very well appointed, staff are professional and the location cannot be beaten. While we didn't eat there we found an abundance of cafes & restaurants nearby. The mini bar came in useful for storing our own supplies but the prices charged by the hotel were reasonable. We also made use of the rooftop pool on a couple of occasions, great fun to recover from a late night as the November temperature shook off any cobwebs. If I have any reservations it would be the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms but the hotel was so good I still give it 5 stars.

<Title>“Great location and price”
<Content>We've just returned from a four-night stay at the Hotel Jazz, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona for a few days. We booked our stay through the hotel and got an even better rate than was available on the website. The four nights for us both cost about 510 euro, including the 7% tax. The real selling point for the Jazz is the location. It's between the Place Catalunya at the top of the Ramblas, and Place Universtat. The Ramblas is less than five minutes walk away, and it's possible to walk most places. During our four days, we never used the metro, and only took a taxi once (in search of a restaurant that proved not to be worth the trek!) We also used the open-top tour buses two days, and other than that we walked every where. There's no need to pay 150 euro each for breakfast. We ate on two mornings in a little bar/tapas place across the road (I think it was Biere D'Or) and other mornings just picked little cafes off the Ramblas - and about 10 euro should cover two people. We were on the very top floor, so we had no problems with noise - even even had a tiny balcony over-looking the busy Pelai Street. The hotel bar is handy for a drink before going out, and we also used the internet there to check out restaurant reviews before we went out! It's not the kind of place where you'd spent an entire evening, and it didn't really stay open late enough for a nightcap, but for what it was it was fine. We had very little contact with reception, or staff in general. They weren't exactly over-friendly - but they were efficient and as I've already said, for the price you couldn't do much better. We had lovely tapas on our last evening just around the corner from the hotel - come out of the hotel and turn right, and cross the street in front of you, turn right and then turn left at the next junction - the restaurant should be on the corner ahead of you on your left. I think it was called Dancerama or something like that. 35 euro got us more plates of tapas than we could eat, ice-cream and two beers! But back to the Jazz. For a city break where you're not going to be spending much time at the hotel, the Jazz is perfect - spotlessly clean, comfortable, modern and well-priced. PS We even used the outdoor pool (yes, in November) and found out that they don't seem to bother heating it at this time of year....

<Title>“Comfortable, friendly Hotel Jazz”
<Content>We just returned from a happy five-night stay at Hotel Jazz in Barcelona. Though it is very conveniently located--just two blocks away from the Placa de Catalunya, the heart of the old city---the fact that it is tucked away in a sort of corridor between two major streets makes it surprisingly quiet. As noted by another reviewer, a metro line runs nearby, but on the fifth floor where we were, the noise is muted and did not effect us or disturb our sleep at all. Guestrooms are immaculate and large for a hotel that is not grandly deluxe, with plenty of storage space for clothes, toiletries, and travel paraphernalia. The hotel's decor is sleek, with natural wood accents and dark walls punctuated with orange and black abstract art pieces. The overall effect is warm and comfortable. Hotel Jazz is well-staffed with helpful and courteous employees. A copious breakfast is available for 15 euros (actually pretty expensive for Barcelona.) You can special order scrambled eggs or omelettes or choose from a vast array of pastries, cold cuts, dairy products, cereals, juices. It was a real pleasure to come back to this hotel each night after a busy day of exploring Barcelona!

<Title>“Wonderful bedroom, great breakfast, very central”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz for one night pre cruise. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. Our bedroom was absolutely beautiful and the bathroom was gorgeous. We booked the hotel along with our flight, through British Airways, so breakfast was included. We loved the position of the hotel, very close to Las Ramblas and would stay there again.

<Title>“Best location, nice modern hotel”
<Content>Stayed at Hotel Jazz for 3 nights and absolutely loved the place. Location is on Pelai 3 (tell taxi driver you're going to "hotel jazz" or "hotel yazz" on pelayo tres" or near hotel inglatera (not all taxi drivers know the hotel right off the bat). The hotel is near the following places of interest: hop on hop off bus-across the street from the hotel julia travel agency/tours- across the street from the hotel las ramblas-5-10 min. walk el corte ingles mall (supermarket at basement)-plaza catalunya-5-10 min. walk Universitat metro-in front of hotel tapas bars across from the hotel or go to the ramblas rainbow cafe-beside the hotel starbuck's- shopping area-5 minute walk zara, topshop,etc-5 min walk lefties outlet (zara and bershka)-5 min. walk All other places of interest can be reached with metro, very easy to navigate. Buy t10 (can be shared) card if staying for a long time. Other hotels nearby-Hotel Inglatera-cheaper, close to the hotel lleo hotel About the hotel rooms- everything you need is available-hairdryer, toothpaste/brush, shaver, soap, shower cap, bidet, minibar, comforter, map etc. Front desk people are very friendly, can arrange taxi even early in the morning. Overall, had a great time at hotel jazz. Best location, modern, comfy,clean hotel, highly recommended.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>This hotel has a location that is close to bus stops, cafes, easy walk to major attractions. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Most staff is helpful. Skip the breakfast-very expensive and you can go across the street for much less money (we are on a budget).

<Title>“Clean, Good Location, and HUGE Bed!”
<Content>Good Location - easy for Aerobus, get off at Universatt (Have to return though from Catalyan)and metro handy too. Speedy and efficient check in. Clean room, not massive, as most of the room was taken up by the Bed - my wife and I slept in different time zones. Nice modern and clean bathroom. Yes, bar is boring (one quick drink there before we all went out) and in a strange location right by the lifts, and we didn't have breakfast there either- too many local places much cheaper/better. Pool on roof looked great (for the summer!) Only downside no tea/coffee makin facilities in room. Booked a few months ago and got a rate of 105 eurs per night. Yes, we would use same Hotel again.

<Title>“Agree that some aspects are not perfect but....”
<Content>We stayed in the Jazz in October,not for the first time, and have to agree that pehaps a little "JADED" rather than "JAZZED" might apply now.It is still a good enough hotel and very central.The smell in the bathroom was accepted gracefully and we were quickly moved.The bar WAS lacking in atmosphere,the entrance IS as described...a bit of a non event..and yes,the porter didn't seem to porte much! But would I go back?YES! Maybe it's the big comfortable bed-(the room wasn't that big this time)...I dont know,but I would love to hear some recommendations for an equivalent hotel.. If you are looking for a restaurant, try the Citrus on Passeig de Gracia.We went there twice thanks to PAPA ,the friendly waiter!The food is reasonably priced,the views towards the Battlo romantic at night,the menu varied.Try the fish soup! And don't forget to ask for Papa!

<Title>“An oasis in bustling Barcelona”
<Content>We stayed 4 nights B&B prior to a cruise. This hotel is well placed for the central sights and right by a metro station to get to the others. Our room faced the cut through between the two major streets (i.e. the front of the hotel) and we heard little noise apart from (faintly) the metro below (we called it Las Rumblas!) Front desk friendly and efficient and gave us some good restuarant reservations. We also found that if you go north, away from the tourist area, prices are quite a bit lower, e.g the Canela in C. Aribau - very good but weird English menu translation! Our room was clean, comfortable and stylish. Breakfast a good choice of hot & cold items. This hotel is handy for the Aerobus (10% of a taxi) that drops off from the airport in nearby Pl Universitat, but beware that for some mad reason it wont pick up there - you have to drag your stuff to Pl Catalunya. When we got back from the cruise the hotel were happy to mind our bags for a day until our evening flight.

<Title>“Amazing Value in a Great Location”
<Content>We just returned from a 3 night stay at Hotel Jazz following a cruise on the WindSurf. I chose the Jazz based on the excellent recommendations here. All of us (we had two rooms) couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel. We arrived early on a Sunday morning, and asked to get into our rooms early. The desk clerk offered us rooms on the third floor, but had nothing at that time on higher floors. The only big negative in reviews was feeling the subway rumbling (and it seemed that only those below the fourth floor felt the rumbling), so I chose to wait for rooms on a higher floor. They stored our bags for us, and we waited on comfortable sofas in the lobby (where we did feel the subway rumbling under us). After about an hour (around 10:30 am) there were rooms available on the fourth floor for us. On the fourth floor, none of us ever noticed any noise or rumbling during our stay. One room faced the street, and one faced the courtyard. With windows closed, both rooms were extremely quiet and we all slept well. The beds are comfortable, and everything was very clean. The rooms were a bit small, but very comfortably arranged - and a great value for the 105 euros we paid for a double room (with queen bed). We didn't have breakfast at the hotel (it didn't look interesting) but there is a snack bar next to the hotel entry, and a Starbucks less than a block away. I have to confess that I really enjoyed Starbucks after a couple weeks of European coffee! So I ran for Starbucks and pastries every morning - fine for breakfast. The only negative during our stay was trying to drink our Starbucks at a table next to the bar while waiting to use the PC - the restaurant staff was quite nasty in telling us to get out (despite the restaurant being totally empty). The bar was nice for a quiet nightcap after dinner - but definitely not a swinging hot spot. If I was looking for nightlife in Barcelona, it seems to me that any hotel bar would be a boring choice! The pool was closed due to cool and rainy weather, but it looked like it would be nice. The free wi-fi worked great, and it was absolutely fabulous to have a free PC with a fast Internet connection for guests to use. We had a little work crisis, and it was a lifesaver! And we found the front desk to be very kind and helpful. They let us in the room early, gave us directions, made restaurant reservations. The English was a bit limited, but they did their best and we thank them for their help. Best of all was the location, just two short blocks to Catalunya (central point for the hop-on/off bus) and Las Ramblas. All-in-all, we thought Hotel Jazz was an amazing value and highly recommend it! Our only regret was that we didn't stay longer!

<Title>“Jazztastic!!”
<Content>Booked it online so a little nervous but my friend and i couldn't fault it. Great location ( 5mins walk from top of the ramblas) clean, modern and smart inside. Did hear the metro rumbing underneath at times but that was the only (minor) negative. No rowdy groups to be seen - mainly couples (young and old) and friends together. Would definately recomend it to all - good value for a hotel that was classier than we imagined for the money!! Was bad weather so the pool on the roof was closed - but it was Nov!!

<Title>“Excellent”
<Content>Excellent hotel in great location. Rooms good, clean, moderately sized. Wifi access. Very helpful staff. Avoided breakfast after all the trip advisor reports, it is easy to find cheap coffee and croissant elsewhere. If they had a reasonably priced worthwhile breakfast we would have felt more at home, the lobby is small and it is literally from the street to the lift to the room which is a bit cold. But this is a quibble, it’s as good as other reviews suggest.

<Title>“Just the job”
<Content>Nice little hotel this, right on top of shopping, the Ramblas and a bit of nightlife to boot. Rooftop swimming pool big enough for a cooling dip if you are there when it is warm enough and felt a bit like a scene from a spanish mary poppins looking out over the rooftops from the pool terrace. Rooms well appointed and breakfast adequate. Trying to get a drink from the hotel bar was a challenge but if you are not in a hurry you will get one. Would and probably will return.

<Title>“Very happy with our stay”
<Content>We were quite happy with the hotel. The location is great; a few blocks away from the Placa Catalunya (the center of Barcelona) and a few steps away from a subway stop. The room was adequately large and well laid out. Although the street outside can be busy, the room was very well sound-proofed. The desk staff is helpful. The roof deck has a decent view, but we didn't try out the pool.

<Title>“Amazing stay!”
<Content>This was by far one of the best hotels we've stayed at. We arrived around 11am and they immediately checked us in and upgraded us to a suite (as that was the only room available at the time). The room was impeccably clean. The decor was elegant and modern. The location was great. About a 5-minute wald to La Ramblas. Also very close to a Bus Turistic stop. We would definitely stay here the next time we're in Barcelona.

My only complaint is that the restaurant is a little pricey for the quality of food provided. I would definately stay here again!

<Title>“Good location with good sizes clean rooms”
<Content>Right beside the Universitat Metro station and five minutes walk from the top of La Ramblas. Very modern hotel with clean lines. Rooms large, clean with large bathroom containing bath and shower. Minibar and safe in room. Queen sized comfortable bed but sheet was for king size. Selection of piped jazz music available in room and bathroom. Only downside is metro rumble from Line 1 which runs under hotel. Apart from that room was quiet. Staff efficient and pleasant. Breakfast is a massive 14.5 euros per person but there are plenty of places to eat around the hotel.

<Title>“Clean, spacious, modern, central location”
<Content>Stayed here this week based on positive reviews from this site. Was not disappointed. Was on my own but got a generous double room with a gigantic bed. Staff were efficient and professional. I am a stickler for cleanliness and could find no fault here. Pristine bathroom with a truly powerful shower. Room had a Juliette balcony overlooking Pelai street. Great location, just off Las Ramblas. My only "complaint" would be that i would really have liked a kettle in the room to be able to make a nice cup of tea after trudging around for hours. I did find the room extremely hot, which could be solved by opening the balcony door, but then you had the noise issue.

<Title>“Beautiful beds !”
<Content>3 nights here as recovery from a gruelling conference - so glad we chose this hotel. It's stylish, contemporary, clean, efficient, friendly helpful staff. The room had everything we needed including a minibar fridge which is always helpful for a small amount of self catering. Floor to ceiling windows with a full opening door allowed fresh air, but also able to block out the noise with the door closed and aircon on. Gorgeous comfortable bed. The location is convenient for the airport bus (less than 5min walk from Universitat stop) and is about 5' walk also to Placa Catalunya and Ramblas. Being slightly away from Ramblas was good so you could sleep. It was a pleasant walk to the main centre of things. Don't miss the local market - just off Ramblas - absolutely beautiful fresh produce, juices and great breakfast at Pinotxo.

<Title>“La Merce Week”
<Content>Just returned from 5 days at the Hotel Jazz having read the reviews here and confirm its great! We were lucky enough to get our room early (arrived at midday) with all we asked for during the booking. The Hotel staff were very helpful, the room was very clean and the breakfast (inclusive via lastminute.com) was excellent with scrambled eggs/ frankfurt sausage, cereal, fruit, cakes, meat/cheese/ breads / toast /juices. I have to say we didnt want to eat much for the rest of the day! As mentioned elsewhere the centre of Barcelona is noisy but its quieter here than on Las Ramblas. The advantage is that its close to Cataluna Square which is a major bus terminus and where several tube lines cross. We walked easily to the sea at the botom of Las Ramblas and wandered the old City. Our best travel tip is that whenyou visit Gaudi's Sagrada Familia church ask for the second lift. The queue at the first one was 90 minutes , the second one at the back just 20 minutes. La Merce festival was great entertainment with processions etc

<Title>“Definitely stay here again”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Jazz for four night while in Barcelona on vacation. It was a great choice for us. The rooms were clean and modern as depicted in the photos and our window was a sliding glass door with a railing on the outside which provided great ventilation. The air conditioning worked really well too. There is a small plunge pool on the roof with lots of chaise lounges to catch a few rays, as well as a number of tables with umbrellas if you want shade. This hotel is in a great location for a tourist and there is a subway station just a few yards from the front door. Breakfast was a disappointment, and you might just walk over to Placa de la University if all you want is a croissant and coffee

<Title>“A Solid Choice”
<Content>We arrived on a rainy Friday night for a two night stay. The hotel is very conveniently located in the centre of the city. First impressions of the reception area is functional but rather uninspiring and bland. The check in process was quite slow and there was some confusion about how many rooms had been reserved. I was on the fourth floor and my friend was on the seventh floor. Initial impressions of the room - very monochrome, masculine decor and a bit dark for my personal taste, hard floors, good quality furnishings, good cleanliness, excellent wardrobe with safe inside, massive and very comfortable bed. I walked into the bathroom and there was a very unpleasant smell (think sweaty socks...) coming from the washbasin. My friend's bathroom didn't have the same problem. Reported it to reception on Saturday morning but it was still there by the time we checked out on Sunday. Apart from this (hopefully isolated) incident, the bathroom was really superb with a refreshingly powerful shower. From the fourth floor, you could hear the distant rumble of the metro trains but it didn't bother me at all. Both of our rooms were on the inside courtyard rather than the street which certainly reduces the light at the window but also makes them very quiet. There is a sliding door which is good if you want fresh air. The air conditioning was quiet and worked well. Room lighting was also very good. We used the breakfast buffet both mornings. As is the norm with similar hotels, it is expensive but there was a good range of food and service was efficient, so if you have a big appetite at breakfast then it's good value and very convenient of course. We didn't use room service but from looking at the menu, the prices seemed quite reasonable which is a rarity. The roof terrace is really stunning with wonderful views of the city. I suppose we were at the wrong end of summer but it was still quite warm and there was only ever one or two other people up there. It does seem very strange that it closes so early because it's such a great asset to the hotel. So to sum up, a good value, very comfortable hotel. The Hotel Jazz won't set the world alight but it's a solid and quality choice.

<Title>“Location, location”
<Content>We stayed in the Jazz in Sept 08 for 4 nights, after reading all the positive reviews on TA. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others. However, there are a couple of negative points to note but nothing too major. Positives:- - Very convenient location, just 5 minutes from Las Ramblas. - Fantastic bedroom and bathroom. - Reasonable price (booked via Hotels.com at €130 per night including Breakfast). - Spotlessly clean. Negatives:- - Overall slightly disappointing breakfast, and the worst coffee ever ! Had we being paying extra for breakfast I would have complained, as it was not worth €15 each. - Due to the central location, there was a lot of traffic noise from our room (we were on the 6th floor at the front). The windows sound like they are slightly open even when they're fully shut. - One of the reasons we chose the Jazz was due to having a terrace pool, so we could cool down after a day walking around in the heat. This might sound really picky, but the water was SO cold that it was just unusable. You just had to watch people grimace as they stepped in (and promptly step back out). Would I recommend the Hotel Jazz? Overall, yes. Would I return? Probably not.

<Title>“Nice Hotel / Great Value”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here for one night in late August. We were there for a wedding, so for the rest of the time, we stayed in a villa outside of the city. I thought the Hotel Jazz was very nice. We had a relatively large, clean, modern room. We were there on a Friday night and there was no noise to speak of in our room. The hotel is situated near Las Ramblas, but not on Las Ramblas which I believe helps with the noise. I thought it was a great area to be in since it was walking distance to everything but not right in the middle of the late night Las Ramblas scene. Overall, the hotel was a good value. I had investigated similar hotels in the area, and they were all a bit pricier. Next time we are in Barcelona, I would check out the Hotel Jazz again.

<Title>“Fabulous Hotel”
<Content>Hotel Jazz is a steal! It is an extremely nice hotel for a great price. Everything about this hotel was wonderful -- the staff is very friendly, the rooms are amazing, there are computers with free internet access, the bar is great and the pool is also very nice. My husband and I really loved the location. It is very short walk to Las Ramblas/touristy stuff, but far enough away that you don't get all of the noise. The location was perfect. The room/bathroom were very spacious and nice. The bed was comfortable and it was nice to be able to open the balcony door for fresh air. The hotel is very modern and the decor is wonderful. The roof deck pool is a bit small and there aren't very many louge chairs around the pool itself, but it is a nice area with great views. There is also an deck with a bar adjacent to the pool. We had a great time hanging out at the bar. The only downside to the bar is that it closes so early -- I believe at 11 or 11:30 pm. I wish it had stayed open later, and several other guests commented on this as well. I highly recommend this hotel, and if I ever go back to Barcelona, this is where I will stay!

<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Jazz during a weekend visit to Barcelona. The pros: The rooms are really beautiful. Trendy, attractive and comfortable. The staff was also welcoming and helpful. Although, we asked for a restaurant suggestion and I was not quite happy as they sent us to a super touristy area. Location is good. There is a metro stop just a few steps away and it is in close proximity to some sites as well. There is also a great view from the rooftop pool which seems well maintained and a nice refreshing way to end a long day. Check out is 11am which is good as we like a later checkout. The cons: Breakfast is expensive. And is fine. But not impressive. We stayed on the 4th floor but at times, could still hear the metro running past below. It didn't disturb us really but it might do on lower floors. The airco works. Yet, it was directed just at the area where your head lays on the pillow. Rather uncomfortable and not good for the sinuses. The pool is far too small for the number of guests in the hotel. We had to hang around for nearly an hour before even getting a chair. When we finally did get one, it turned out to be broken. Plus, there seem to be a lot of guests who just place a towel down to reserve a chair, then never return. All in all I'd say it is a nice hotel and certainly worthy of a 3.5 star rating. But, when I go to Barcelona again, I will likely look to see what else is out there as I feel there may be something more satisfying.

<Title>“As advertised”
<Content>I decided to stay at this hotel as it was my first stop after 30 hours of travelling from Australia, and I wanted a comfortable room. I stayed on the fifth floor, facing the main street and I barely heard any noise at all - not even any subway noise as mentioned in other reviews. As I was pretty much shattered after my flights, and suffering from a cold, I spent a great deal more time in the room than I had intended. I found the room to be very comfortable and the in room wifi was very handy. Overall a great stay.

<Title>“Great location but be prepared for noise!”
<Content>Just returned from a long weekend at the Hotel Jazz in Barcelona and have a pretty mixed review which i hope will be helpful for those thinking of staying there. The hotel is lovely and clean, the beds and bathrooms are big for a city hotel and staff are friendly and helpful, the rooftop pool is a fab advantage and the views arent bad. However the hotel is in no way soundproofed internally! it is true we couldnt hear any street noise but the sound of the person in the room above showering was enough to wake me up every morning as well as the noise of the lift and staff and guests making their way along corridors which echoed throughout the rooms! Breakfast is a complete waste of time and was worse than anything i have ever tried to eat - definitely worth getting up and going out for it. Other than that it was a pleasant enough stay but would definitely choose somewhere else next time.

<Title>“Outstanding, but.......”
<Content>Anyone who would want to stay near the Ramblas in Barcelona must be under 30. It's little more than the longest souvenir strip mall in the world. Luckily, if you stay at Hotel Jazz, it's close enough to the Ramblas to be close, and far enough that you won't be bothered by all the vending. Overall, Hotel Jazz is well and centrally located. The interiors are modern, hard-edged, and hip. The only drawback is that the design of the hallways is also modern, hard-edged, and hip, and not furnished with wall-to-wall sound-attenuating carpet. That translates to NOISY. What with the staff slamming doors, insensitive guests slamming doors, and every child slamming doors, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM it's reminiscent of being in the middle of the orchestra pit during Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture," complete with brass cannons. Outstanding breakfast. Nice roof deck with inconsequential pool. Fairly helpful staff who were unable to accommodate me with a mere two hour late checkout after a five-night stay. I would probably stay there again, but not before checking out the alternatives more closely.

<Title>“Has everything”
<Content>Just returned with my wife from a lovely 3 day stay at the Hotel Jazz over our wedding anniversary. This was my seventh visit to the city and the best hotel so far. Location is excellent just a minutes walk from an airport bus stop which was handy as we didn't land until late. There's a metro station and numerous bus stops all within 300m of the front door and a walk of no more than 5 minutes gets you to Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas. Our room was excellent with a massive bed. Ours was on the fifth floor over reception, so not facing the main roads and was quiet with the balcony door shut. As mentioned on other reviews you can hear/feel the metro trains going under the hotel but only just. The air conditioning was very effective and quiet and was too good and had to be turned off on our first night as we were too cold!! For the days we were there it was very hot and the pool ,although small, was a welcome relief following a day of taking in the sights. The hotel had two PC's that offerred internet access and we were able to get free wi-fi in our room on our PDA. Breakfast was expensive but was very extensive with choices and if you are capable of eating lots of food in the morning you could have got your money's worth. Our room had a minibar fridge which we stocked up with drinks from the little shop round the corner which was much cheaper than the hotel prices. We had room service one afternoon by the pool which was relatively cheap and tasted nice. All in all a great short break and if we go back to Barcelona we would stay here again.

<Title>“Great Stay”
<Content>The Hotel Jazz is a fantastic hotel in a great location. Check in was very smooth, no problems at all. The rooms are a good size, with nice bathrooms and very large and comfortable bed. The aircon was great as it was very hot outside. The hotel is very well located, about 5 mins walk to las Ramblas. Barcelona is a wonderful city, you are spoilt for choice for restuarants, bars sightseeing and anything else that you may want to do. If i had to complain about anything it would be the prices at the hotel. Our rate didn't include breakfast and you'd have to part with 15 Euros each for the privillage. I never understand why hotels charge so much as this shows as both the bar and restuarant was practically empty all the time . Mind you the poor rate we get for the Euro doesn't help The reception Desk was very helpful, they'd give directions, draw out maps and even book resevations for you. There is a pool at the top of the hotel, nothing special as it's tiny and very shallow, but still nice to have a cool dip at the end of hot day. Hotel aside, i would definitely recommend the tourist bus service. There are 3 routes, Reb, Blue and Green. This is the best way to see Barcelona. For around 13 Euro's a day (you can buy 2 and 3 days passes) you cant really go wrong. All in all the Hotel Jazz is a great hotel and Barcelona as a city is even better.

<Title>“Come to Barcelona - stay here”
<Content>I've regularly use tripadvisor as my main source for hotels - even over the guidebooks. I've stayed in some really nice places ove the last two years so I decided that I should have my view and help other users like they helped me. In other words, if you are in Barcelona, then stay here. The pool is just the icing on the cake. The location is perfect and all wrapped up in a great price (go via the intranet web pages and take your time with hotels and you can recieve great deals. However, I'm not going to give it five out of five because the staff were not always forthcoming. We got what we needed all the time and hence the great review but the occasionally distracted staff just rough over what was otherwise extremely excellent holiday. thumbs up.

<Title>“Fantastic in every way.”
<Content>This hotel is slightly expensive in comparison to other 3*'s but the service and quality of the hotel could easy make it a 4/5*. We had a room that faced onto the internal coutryard. At first I was unhappy about this and was going to ask them to change it but then thought it may be less noisy then those that faced onto the main road. The hotel staff were great and couldn't do anything more for us. They recomended and booked us great restaurants. The pc's are not connected to a printer so they went on our airlines website and printed off our flight tickets rather then going to a net cafe. The bathroom was a good size but was lacking in supplies. There was no 2in1 shampoo and conditioner or body lotion, only shampoo and a shower gel which looked and smelt like fairy liquid. So i went and bought some supplies. I didnt try the breakfast or the bar. For breakfast i found a great bakery at the top of Ronda di Sant Antonio just off Placa de la Universitat. The shop underneath the hotel has some basics but the fresh stuff wasn't that great. The metro does run underneath the hotel and you can hear the rumble of the passing trains but if you are going to stay less then 300m from the metro then you have to expect it. Overall a great hotel with a great location. I will definitely be staying here on my next trip to Barcelona

<Content>We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel Jazz, I booked it because of reviews I read on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed!! it is in a very central location only three minutes from the top of Las Ramblas, the staff were really nice, the room was clean, large and had great air conditioning and a mini bar, we had sky news and cable TV (not that we watched it!) I cant recommend this hotel enough! The roof top pool is lovely too!

<Title>“Excellent; shame about the barman!!”
<Content>Hubby & I have just returned after a 4 night stay at the Hotel Jazz, booked solely on the recommendations of Trip Advisor travellers reviews. On the whole we were very pleased with our stay; the room was a good size with a massive,comfortable bed & excellent air conditioning which was essential as Barcelona was in the middle of a heatwave. Our room was facing the main street but no noise was heard. The location is brilliant, with easy access to most major sites either on foot or Metro (we mostly used Universitat Metro which is nearer the hotel than Catalonya.) The rooftop pool was a blessing but timings had to be right!! It got very busy around 4pm daily & was at times impossible to get a sunbed (due to towel blockers!!) or even a chair. We started to go out early to sightsee & returned to the pool earlier in the afternoon, when it was much quieter, which was a nice relaxing end to the day before going out for the evening. Breakfast was expensive at the hotel & as others have recommended, can be obtained from cafe's along the road for much less. We had several excellent & reasonably priced meals around the Placa Reial, left off Las Ramblas, with our favourite being La BoTiga which is on Carrer d' Escudellers. Don't get drawn in to the huge queues that form at the 15 Nits (yes really!!) in the corner of the square; other restaurants are as good & you get served straight away. The reception staff were helpful when approached but don't make a point of acknowledging guests when you enter or leave the building. We had a late flight & were kindly allowed to use the pool after check out.; however the pool barman quite rudely refused to allow us clean towels to shower with so we had to dry using ones very damp from the pool. He obviously has another job as the hotels laundryman!! Not a major issue but irritating considering the cost of the hotel & not an attitude you would receive from the Hilton for example. Otherwise a very enjoyable visit!

<Title>“Excellent Location and Refreshing Rooftop Pool”
<Content>Most impressed with Jazz Hotel with its spacious, comfortable and clean cut rooms. The bathroom was exceptionally relaxing with its deep brown tiles and trendy Jazz shower screen. Tempatures were high and after touring the city for the day the pool was very welcoming to chill! The location was perfect, far enough away from La Rambla but only minutes walk away. The only downside was lack of music at the pool/entrance area. It should live up to its name! All bar that I'd highly recommend it.

<Title>“Superb place to stay, but you do pay for it”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at the Hotel Jazz in July '08 for 6 nights following all the positive comments made about it on TA. We were certainly not disappointed and had a superb stay. The Jazz is perfectly located to explore Barcelona, being walking distance from the Ramblas but importantly also near the Universitatt and Placa Catalunya Metro stations which made exploring the city easy. The hotel itself was spotless, our room was large and always cleaned well and the bathroom was much larger than our expectations. We didn't have a view from our patio doors (it looked out upon the central 'garden' area) however I never mind an inside room in Spanish cities as it keeps the noise to a minimal level. One key aspect was the attitude of the staff who were quite simply excellent - some reviews on TA had questioned their attitude but they were exceptionally helpful and courteous to us, answering questions, giving advice allowing me to print things for free from the reception PC's and so on. The rooftop pool is a great addition and one of the reasons we chose the Jazz and it provided a great place to relax when not out trawling Barca. Towels are provided by the pool. A bar / cafe is available on the roof, however, we chose to just buy baguettes from the shop next door and to eat them by the pool. Travelling from the airport, the aeorbus (about 4 Euros each) takes you to Universitaat where it is literally a 2-minute walk to the hotel - unfortunately, it only picks up again from Placa Catalunya which, with a suitcase is more like a 7-10 minute walk. We got a taxi back to the airport which cost 35 Euros with tip. I was in Barcelona for work and therefore my hotel was paid for on expenses. The total cost for the 6 nights stay was £900, which for a 3-star hotel is a lot of money, and this would normally be over my budget if travelling for leisure. This price didn't include breakfast either. The Jazz is, however, a well placed and excellently managed hotel with great service and therefore if you can afford to pay these prices, it's a solid bet that it will provide an excellent base to discover Barcelona.

<Title>“Thumbs up for the Jazz”
<Content>Hotel Jazz was a great stay. Located very close to La Rambla but far enough away from the Frenzy. The rooms were smart and clean, and very quiet. Our room was adjacent to a fairly busy street which I never heard, unless I had the window open. Also, a major metro station is about a 2 minute walk from the hotel. We used it extensively. The pool was a nice place to relax mid afternoon and actually got a bit crowded at times. Helpful English speaking staff. Good value for the price. I'd recommend it to a friend.

<Content>Modern hotel, spacious room, suprisingly quiet and a GREAT location! That said, I'm not sure that I would stay here again as the bed we had was awful. We both woke up with back pain from the mattress we had - you could feel the springs! It's a shame that they get everything else right but the bed falls way short. When the only time you spend in your room is to sleep and you can't do so comfortably, that's a failure in my book.

<Content>We booked this hotel due to its proximity to Las Ramblas and the metro station at Universitat and were thoroughly impressed with the place. The rooms are clean, well equipped with amenities and have great showers, although the bathtubs are little small. The Hotel's rooftop pool is also the perfect way to cool-off after a hot day of sightseeing! Only grumble was the price of the continental breakfast (15 Euros - you'll get a much better deal at any one of thousands of cafe's in the area) but other than this the hotel gets a big thumbs up

<Title>“Perfect Location; Great Rooms”
<Content>This is a great hotel from which to explore Barcelona. Its location (near the Placa Catalunya, La Rambla, and the shopping area along the Passeig Gracia) is superb. It's also near several Metro stations, which makes getting to other areas of the city a breeze. The rooms are spotless and a good size for a city like Barcelona and the location of the hotel. Our room (on the 4th floor) was very quiet. Periodically, we could hear the subway rumbling below, but it was not a distraction in any respect. Minibar is great as it is big and they don't fill it full of stuff, so there is plenty of room to put your own water bottles and a bottle of wine or snacks. No concierge and the front desk staff seemed somewhat willing to assist, but certainly not rushing to provide advice or assistance. Just don't rely on them for anything other than check-in; check-out; and wake-up calls (by the way, the rooms have no bedside clock, which I thought was strange). The shower/bath combination is strange in that the piece of glass that is intended to enclose the shower is not large enough. It makes for somewhat of a chilly shower and the water gets on the floor. However, the water pressure is excellent by European standards and there is plenty of very hot water. As noted in previous reviews, the amenities are poor and not abundant (the soap bar literally lasts for one shower--not sure how it dissolves so quickly). Based on the prior reviews, I brought a few small bars from another hotel to supplement. Also, there is no box of Kleenex--only a small packet with about 8 tissues. If there is one thing about the rooms that the management needs to improve, it is the bath amenities. We didn't eat in the restaurant and the bar looked empty and depressing, so we stayed away. I did ask for a glass in the bar since there were not enough in our room, and the surely bartender refused. Not sure what he thought I was going to do with the glass. Overall, we had a very good experience. The main thing is that the hotel was clean, quiet, safe, well-located, and provided a good night sleep. After all, you aren't hanging out at the hotel a whole lot in a beautiful city like Barcelona.

<Content>First of all: Incredible location... The room service is excellent: I asked for an ethernet cable and they brought me one in 3 minutes... After this, I asked for two bath towels, and in less than two minutes they were in my room. The room is nice, clean and with a modern style. The employees are very nice and kind people... I have read some reviews that complained with this issue, but I had a great experience. I didn't use the amenities, but I visited the pool at the roof and is very nice. The relation cost/benefits is VERY GOOD... Beause I paid 140 euros for the first week of July, which is high season.

<Title>“Cool hotel in Barcelona!”
<Content>My husband really wanted a hotel with a roof top pool. So I picked this hotel in the middle of city and were pleasantly surprised since the hotel staff is super nice and gave us some of dinner suggestions around town. We took a cab which is about 15 minutes to the hotel which is near the center of many sight seeing attractions. The room is clean and very spacious...the only weird thing is the blanket has a tiny burnt hole in it... They have a wonderful roof top pool in which we took advantage of when we just wanted to relax and provided pool side lounge chairs and towels. The hotel is walking distance to most places and is very close to the Metro station. Barcelona is really wonderful city with many amazing architecture and the culinary is not to be missed from their famous tapas selections. Would definitely come back again!

<Title>“Fabulous Hotel , great location, superb housekeeping”
<Content>I went to Barcelona last July and stayed at the Montacado H10 and thought that was good. The Hotel Jazz is absolutely fantastic. We arrived around 1pm and were quickly checked in and our bags taken. Now, as we are in a major city I expected the room to be small - it was last year, but boy did we have a suprise - it was huge, plenty of room , comfortable beds, spotlessly clean, and a lovely large bathroom with all facilities. The hotel itself is about 5 mins walk from PLace de Catalunya where you can get the airport bus to and from. There is a Starbucks on the way which was great for the morning coffee and plenty of bars , shops etc. and you are only max 2 min walk to the top of Las Ramblas. The rooftop solarium and pool are perfect for a city and the views are quite extensive. We never tried room service etc or the bar as we were out most of the time. Now to Housekeeping, this is where many hotels get it wrong but at the Jazz it was absolutely spotless everyday and the staff deserve a special thanks. Every day when we came back the room looked perfect - we were so impressed we left an extra large tip for the cleaners - they deserve it - well done ! Make sure you go to the old market just of Las Ramblas - if you are going down from the top it is about 100m on the right. Amazing place, fab fresh food and there is a cafe in there where you can eat, may have to wait though but it is well worth it. Superb break all in all and I will definitely go back to the Jazz again.

<Title>“Fantastic Accomodations”
<Content>We spent 3 weeks in Europe and stayed at 6 hotels and 5 were very, very good; Hotel Jazz was the best. We had two adults and two kids (8 and 13) and our room was spectacular. I can't do justice to the room -- it was perfect. Because it was for 4 it was a corner with floor to ceiling windows that opened as if to a balcony, although a balcony only 6 inches deep. The room was spacious, spotless, and modern. The bathroom was large and you could eat off the floor. The pool on the roof was open and chilly but the kids didn't care -- actually it worked out great as they were the only ones in it. The view by the pool is wonderful. The room and hotel was spotless. Quick walk to the Rambla, but not on it which is a good thing. Near all subway stops and a Starbucks. I had to do some business while there and I had no problems with internet access or getting documents printed by the staff. The staff was ok, not overly friendly, but I didn't find many people in Spain who were particularly friendly. If I sound like I'm in love, it's b/c I am with the Hotel Jazz -- too bad I don't feel the same way about Barcelona and won't be going back anytime soon.

<Title>“Nice, maybe a bit expensive”
<Content>Very nice hotel, clean, sleek style. Location is perfect, walking distance from Placa Catalunya and therefore Ramblas and Barrio Gotico. Little swimming pool on the roof top. You can access WIFI and also use 2 Computers on the 1st floor by the bar for free. We didn't try the breakfast as seemed a bit expensive, but it was not a problem as just right next to it there is a little cafe that serves croissant (the chocolate covered ones were great), or savory sandiwiches and makes coffees (even to take away - altouhg in a plastic cup). Next to this cafe there is a little shop where you can buy icecreams and water or drinks. The room is confortable and big enough - seem all new. The bed in particular is huge. They have double glazing windows so even if some rooms are on the main street you forget you are there. On the negative note...i think it is very expensive, probably for 210 euros a nighe it is not as great as it should be - or at least it should include the breakfast.

<Title>“Liked the Hotel Jazz”
<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Jazz in Barcelona for three nights prior to a cruise. The rooms were very comfortable and attractive. The bathroom was spacious and clean. The location was excellent -- we could walk to just about everything. The helpfulness of the staff was uneven -- some front desk personnel were cold and brusque, others were very nice. They appeared to be generally understaffed. No concierge, no bellhops. Not a luxurious experience, but a good value.

<Title>“Had camera stolen”
<Content>The Hotel is very nice abit like a business hotel but rooms very clean, air conditioning great and close to everything. Would recommend for those reasons however I had my camera stolen in the bar and I didn't feel that the hotel took it seriously I was not at any stage asked details about where I was sitting etc. I was passed to the bar when speaking to reception and then told at the bar to speak to reception. No-one really wanted to deal with it. Also filled in comment sheet left email addess asking for a reply about the theft. I have not received a reply and wonder what is the point in filling in the reviews. For the cost of the hotel I did not expect to get something stolen within the hotel. Beware of setting anything down in this hotel.

<Title>“Smart Hotel”
<Content>We (2 couples in 2 rooms) booked this hotel because of the reviews at TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed. The location was ideal. Within a block of an Aerobus stop (Universitat) and two blocks from Plaza Catalunya, the center of town. We're all city-dwellers (Chicago), so the noise around the hotel was no problem. The windows were well-insulated to cut down on noise in the room. We did notice the rumbling of the subway (from our rooms on the 4th floor), but it wasn't anything that would keep us awake. The hotel is smartly furnished. The rooms are well-lit, large (for a European hotel), and nicely appointed. There's a bedside closed-circuit radio (no commercials) that plays the music from the bathroom. (Trust me, it's cool.) Bedding was comfortable. My only complaint was with the bathroom ammenities: shower gel would have to be used as shampoo. We had very prompt service from the staff when our radio went off at 4AM our first morning and we didn't yet know what it was. (Is there an alarm feature that we didn't know about?) The breakfast was expensive, but substantial and worthwhile. Be hungry. The cool & rainy weather wasn't making the rooftop pool a good option, but the views from up there were very nice. This was our first trip to Barcelona and we were very intrigued by the city. When we go back, the Hotel Jazz will be our first choice.

<Title>“Another good choice from TripAdvisor”
<Content>Once again I have not gone wrong in picking a hotel that's in the top 4 or 5 on this site. Hotel Jazz was fine - certainly not the best or fanciest, but the location was excellent (very close to metro stop and walking distance to p. catalunya/ramblas); clean rooms; room was certainly larger than some europe hotels I've been in; and very helpful and friendly night staff (note I stress night). The roof deck w/ pool is very nice (just wish it was open later). The main complaint I have about this place is the stinginess with the toiletries. We had to practically beg for additional toilet paper and soap; the maid never left enough. The toilet paper was just slightly softer than sand paper and the soap was tiny and melted in 5 minutes. We resorted to using the bath gel as handsoap bc we never had enough to last. They also don't provide any moisturizer or hair conditioner, and only about 5 tissues per day in a tiny sealed package. Once we saw what the deal was with the toiletries, it made sense that this was only ranked a 3-star hotel. Luckily the maid left the cart unattended in the hall a few times so we stocked up. The breakfast is a rip off at 15 euros per person though the selection was fairly good - however, they kept running out of things the 2 times we went bc they use the buffet to assemble the room service orders!

<Content>This 3 star hotel is easily better than 4 star hotels I've stayed in. The staff were incredibly nice and helpful whilst not being over-familiar, the room was stylish, relaxing place and very comfortable. Basically I couldn't think of anything negative to say here even if I wanted to. Sure, there is a slight and rumble from the subway to be heard but it's really nothing disturbing and besides, you're in a big city - what do you expect. Very highly recommended.

<Title>“very nice, clean, helpful staff”
<Content>We decided to try this hotel based on recommendations read here; we were not disappointed. Our room was on the 5th floor, and, yes, we did hear the subway, but it didn't bother us. Room was otherwise quiet, and very clean, and when our room telephone malfunctioned, the staff fixed it immediately. Also, the day we arrived it was pouring rain; the staff had sturdy umbrellas available for us to borrow. The breakfast was very good, and the hotel is within walking distance of many nice shops, restaurants, and the metro and tourist bus line. Staff spoke English, and helped us find our way around. I will stay at the Hotel Jazz again.

<Title>“very good experience”
<Content>Overall, this was an excellent stay. As noted by others the location of the hotel is a major benefit. The metro stop is essentially outside the door and other sites of interest are very close. Breakfast was not included in my rate but I preferred to venture out for something to eat with numerous possibilities close by. As noted by others noise of the metro can be a problem however I was on the 6th floor with an interior-facing room and heard only a very mild "rumble" which was not at all a problem. The room and hotel in general were clean with a lot of wood (e.g., wood floors, wood floors with carpet down the middle in the halls). This has a pleasing appearance but one should remember that wood does not absorb sound so you may hear a bit more hall noise than you'd like. The staff were pleasant and helpful and overall I thought my stay there was very good. However, my one complaint (as noted in some other reviews) was the lack of air conditioning. This time of year, Barcelona is certainly not hot but with the room window closed and the air conditioning fan on high there was barely detectable air movement let alone cooling. On some evenings I had the large room window (i.e., sliding door) open to cool things off before sleeping. Looking out the window I saw others doing the same thing, however, I'm not sure this is something I'd want to do in the summer. Overall, at a relatively cool time of year I would certainly stay here again.

<Title>“Loved the City”
<Content>The hotel is very central. Within walking distance of all the main attactions. The stop for the tour bus is just up the street, which i would highly recommend. We grabbed a taxi from the airport into the hotel, which was 20mins. The hotel is about 5 mins walk from Las Ramblas. The hotel is a boutique hotel, which worked out at about €400.00 for 3 nights. This was about €67 each per night. This did not include breakfast. You could get breakfast in the hotel but it is very pricey at €15.00 per person. It is a fab breakfast (got it the morning we flew home) but it is very expensive. The hotel is very modern, minimalistic interiors. The rooms are small, however very clean and servicable. The staff on reception were very helpful when approached. I would totally recommend staying at this hotel and hopefully will stay there again soon.

<Title>“Excellent Experience!”
<Content>Really good hotel, represents good value for money and is in a great central location. Nice clean, modern decor; rooms are not large, but perfectly comfortable. Service was very good. I left an item in the hotel and the staff could not have done more to help me when I called them from the UK. They called me back twice and sent the item back to me without charge. Excellent!! Only criticism is that they do not have irons in the room, nor can you borrow an iron and ironing board, but I think this is a policy of NN Hotels as the same is true in the couple of other hotels in the same group that I have stayed in.

<Title>“Good hotel/great location!”
<Content>Stayed for one week in February-- had 2 rooms on the 5th floor. They were clean and comfortable. We loved the location! You can walk easily to las ramblas and the metro. We could hear the trains but it wasn't very loud and did not really bother us at all. Staff were pleasant and helpful when needed. We generally don't really require or ask for much assistance. But we had originally booked the hotel for only 5 nights but then changed our plans and wanted to stay an additional 3 nights. They were able to accommodate us for only 2 additional nights but kindly made our last nights reservation at another nearby hotel for us. Overall, I thought it was a clean,pleasant, & safe hotel in a great location. It was a little pricey(largely due to a poor exchange rate) and I would love to have had a breakfast included for the price.

<Title>“Good hotel, but overpriced for what it is”
<Content>Stayed 2 nights in Hotel Jazz, we had upgraded to a Jr Suite, which was a lovely room, very spacious, all mod cons, maybe a little 'worn' in places, fridge not working, nor aircon, but didn't spend enough time in he room to make an issue of these things. Other than a great room, the hotel has nothing to offer, breakfast (included in our deal) was only so & so, waitresses were running away & hiding in the klitchen instead of seeing to people's tables, you had to literally go & stand by the kitchen door to grab one of them as they came out to ask for your coffee, an omelette etc... and then they still ignored you, also not much choice, but hey it's only a 3-star. The Bar was always empty, the barman hiding somewhere, we always had to go and find him to serve us a drink. Location, in my view, not so great, true it's close to Plaza Catalunya for access to public transport, but area has nothing to offer, no nice bars or restaurants. I would recommend you can find hotels slightly out of the city centre much much cheaper, offering better facilities (spa, restaurants,etc.) and use the Metro for the times you want to come into the city centre. We paid far too much for a hotel like Hotel Jazz which hasn't much to offer. They did allow us a very late check-out till 7 pm, and did not charge extra for it, maybe we were just lucky there.... would not recommend because of its cost - not good value for money.

<Title>“Excellent hotel”
<Content>Chose the Hotel Jazz after having read reviews on Trip Advisor and they were very accurate. Its in an excellent location, 5 minutes off La Rambla, is very well designed, modern, smart and efficiently run. The staff were lovely, cleaning was very well done and everything you could want was provided in the room. We even managed a morning's sun-bathing by the pool as the weather was good and the views from there are wonderful. I had requested a high room, as suggested, as there is a fair amount of traffic noise, but we slept with the french door open with no problem. We had breakfast just over the road (turn right out of the hotel) in a tapas bar surrounded by Spanish people - €2 for coffee and croissant/filled roll. Excellent hotel and would definitely recommend it.

<Title>“Niggles at the Jazz”
<Content>Just rerurned from a 3 day break from Barcelona staying at the hotel Jazz. Having stayed in Barcelona on 3 previous occasions, I can safely say this is my least favourite hotel. Whilst the rooms were clean and reasonably well equipped, there was an unpleasant damp smell in the bathroom and no mirror in the bedroom. For those who rely on straighterners or tongs, it was a thankless task styling hair in a steamy bathroom! When the mini bar was restocked it was irratic and on one occassion I had to request clean towels as these had not been replenished by housekeeping. We were room only and were not impressed that on 2 of the 3 mornings cleaning in the corridors started at 8.45, not the alarm call that we had requested! In addition,I can not endorse other reviews relating to the staff. The reception staff were fine but I was rather disappointed that a security guard /concierge (not sure which)watched myself and two daughters struggle down reception stairs with heavy cases without offering to help. The bar, although pleasant ,was irritatating as it was never staffed and it was impossible to get a drink after 11.30pm! The one plus re this area was that internet access is free! I also was disappointed that staff were not more supportive towards a young honeymoon couple whose luggage had been lost and when reunited with its owners was badly creased. The couple asked for the use of an iron but were told that this was not possible and that there was a charge of 5euros to iron each garment My main reason for selecting this hotel however was to take advantage of the rooftop pool. On the first day the weather was 21c and I looked forward to taking a dip. I was disappointed by the size, barely bigger than my bath, and the concept that the pool is heated was laughable. All in all a disappointing stay and next time I'll go back to the Rivoli Ramblas! Louise, Newcastle upon Tyne

Great central location , seconds from Metro Station, Modern, clean rooms, good service. We had breakfast included which was an excellent decision as well. Breakfast (buffet style) was served from 7am-11am which accomodated most lifestyles, and of great importance to English visitors they served tea as well as coffee.

<Title>“Hotel Jazz Fan”
<Content>Have just returned from a 4 night stay with my son at this superb hotel. He (age 15) was particularly taken with the roof level pool, which is not really large enough for serious swimming but a great place to 'chill out'. The staff were polite, friendly and helpful without exception. The rooms are a comfortable size and well fitted out. The double glazing is very effective but cannot eliminate all street noise - so if that bothers you, ask for a room at the back. The location of the hotel could not be better in my view - easy access to two different Metro stations (one literally 50 metres away and the other a 5 min walk). It is not bang in the middle of the tourist area which means that you can escape from the hectic pace whilst having it within easy striking distance. Will definitely book again for next visit.

Beds large and comfortable - plenty of cupboard space. The bathrooms, decor and cleanliness were really high quality. The location made it perfect for anyone wishing for a 4 day break in this great city. To make it perfect a roof top swimming pool with great views enabled us to do a bit of sunbathing in early April!!

<Title>“Believe the reviews”
<Content>My husband and I have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona where we stayed at the Hotel Jazz which we chose on the basis of the Trip Advisor reviews. I just want to endorse all the other good reviews. It was one of the best thought-through hotel designs I've encountered. Plenty of lights (including tiny halogen reading lights on each side of the bed which could be angled to shine brightly on my book but didn't disturb my sleeping husband), decent full length mirror, plenty of coat hangers etc. I knew when I turned off the lights on our first night and noticed a glow through the windows that I would find black-out curtains that I hadn't closed, and so I did. The location is excellent - quiet but 5 minutes from La Rambla. The breakfasts are good but try and get them included in your deal because they are quite pricey. Hotel Jazz in one of a chain of 9 hotels in Barcelona - Nunez Navarro - and they all look equally stylish. Next time we'll probably try another one of them just for a change.

<Title>“A hotel offering a great location and a decent value”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel during mid of March for 4 nights as a group of three. I reserved the hotel based on the reviews from tripadvisor. The first thing I want to mention is that the hotel is very conveniently located. It is just two very short blocks away from the subway's interchange station CATALUNYA, where you can connect to L1, L3 and other lines that virtually take you everywhere. L3 runs from the north to the south of the La Rambla. L1 let you connect to L4, which allows you to get around the old town easily. If you wish to stick to L1, then the hotel is one block away from L1's UNIVERSITAT. In fact you can see that subway stop right from the front door of the hotel. The hotel is about 3 blocks away from the La Rambla. So you can walk there within 5 minutes but are exempted from the parties and noises along that street. We did not breakfast at the hotel. There is a Starbucks one block down from the hotel. Then there is a Cafe Zurich one block further. Both offer great coffee and pastries at decent prices (I cannot say "cheap" anymore at the rate the Euro is claiming up against the dollar). The hotel itself is clean and trendy. The people at the front desk are very friendly and speak very good English -- especially after I arrived in Madrid and was shocked by how poorly English was spoken, even in the top 5 star hotel. I am quite impressed with the size of the room -- being to Europe numerous times myself, I am used to small and crowded hotel rooms, especially at the price we paid. The bathroom is also spacious. We stayed at rooms 416 and 417 and we did notice the noise from the subway underneath as other travelers have pointed out. But it did not bother us that much since we do not stay at the room during the day and during the evening the metros are less frequent. I do think they should offer more towels. The only reason that I gave 4 instead of 5 stars for this hotel is the bar. I really think the hotel should fire its bartender. The first night we stopped by for a drink, it was 11:05 and the bar area was already dark (though you can still see some people sitting and chatting in the bar area). So we went downstairs and asked the front desk. The front desk ensured us that the bar is open and the gentleman tried to call the bartender. But after ten minutes he told us there must be some problem because there is no response. The next night we stopped by around 10:40 PM and the bar was open. However, the bartender had such a nasty attitude as if we were bothering him and he really just wanted to get rid of us. All the drinks (very basic ones) we asked were greeted with either a cold and simple "No", or "We do not make that". At some point I could not help but started laughing. My husband had to instruct him to make a simple cocktail and he literally screwed it up right in front of us (not sure if this was done on purpose). While we were sitting in the bar area chatting, the bartender walked by and shut off the light. So he probably thought that his bar -- which the hotel told us to open pass 11:00 PM -- should be closed before 11:00 PM despite there were still customers. Now some more tips: (1) I found the map provided by the front desk of the hotel is quite useful. Speaking of city maps, please save your money and stay away from MapEasy’s Guidemap to Barcelona and Madrid. They are full of mistakes and mislabels. We tried three restaurants marked on their maps: One is located completely on a different street from what the map says – this incident happened in Barcelona. One is no longer there anymore (replaced by a Burberry Shop) and the other is closed – both occurred in Madrid. The city map that I found more reliable is Streetwise Barcelona and Streetwise Madrid. (2) Almost all the guidebooks would suggest you to buy a T-10 ticket: for the price of 7 trips you can get on the metro for 10 trips. But if you buy T-10 ticket you cannot use the free transfer that you are entitled if you would have just bought one single ticket – which allows you to transfer within 75 minutes.

Only downside was hubby found shower over bath quite tight (could be due to him being over sized). Don't know if they have rooms with seperate showers. If you need large fluffy towels take your own though. I found the staff very helpful, english speaking, great with advice on services etc.

<Title>“Good overall value hotel”
<Content>My fiancee and I stayed here for three days after staying at the much ritzier Hotel 1898 for four days. The hotel was clean, mostly quiet and centrally located. We were there in February so there were no families with kids, although the signs in the elevator seemed to indicate that there are kids around at other times of the year. If we hadn't stayed at 1898 first we probably would have rated this one excellent. The underground pool and spa at 1898 really spoiled us. For one hundred dollars less per night it was a steal. Try booking through the venere.com or with the hotel directly. We got a lower rate than we booked on check out at the 1898. Both properties are from the same hotel group.

<Title>“Service SOSO with the exception of Anais!!”
<Content>We stayed here for 6 nights - the location is great and the rooms are spacious. however, the rooms did not have robes and room slippers or even an alarm or clock. Further, the housekeeping people kept on forgetting to leave towels in the bathroom, so everyday, we had to call down to get new ones! the service was okay - however, and a big however, one person was especially helpful and very nice - Anais! we had accidently reserved for one night less than our stay and Anais said the rooms were sold out. instead of just throwing us on the street, she was quite helpful and called around numerous hotels to find us a room... it was this added touch, that made me smile. The desk was quite busy, but she was nice to everyone and patiently called over 10 hotels on our behalf! I would go back only because of that!

<Title>“Fab Hotel!”
<Content>What a great hotel! Easy to find, quiet, designed to within an inch of it's life but without the attitude that can come with a high-style destination. Asked for and received a quieter room on an upper floor. Saw a hen party in the lobby but never heard them when we were ready to sleep. Staff were great, very attentive and helpful when it came to questions about the area and requests for help with our lost luggage etc. We'd stay here again without a second thought.

<Title>“great find”
<Content>Just stayed here, booked two rooms for our family, and really loved it. Location can't be beat, central to everything you'd want to see if you are walkers like we are, and steps from metro stations, too. Right by Starbucks, as well, if you need a taste of USA while there. It's a modern hotel in a traditional area, with large rooms including the bathrooms, which have full tubs/showers with plenty of hot water. Everything was clean, and there's an incredible roof-top pool with awesome views. Unfortunately, it was too cool in early March for us to use the pool, but it was ready to go and would be a fun respite if visiting Barcelona in warm weather. The front desk staff was helpful when asked, but not warm or helpful if you don't ask. Would definitely stay here again.

<Content>My boyfriend (now fiance!) and I stayed in this hotel in February and clearly he thought that it was a lovely enough hotel room to propose in! We had a fantastic stay ... the room was spacious, the bathroom large and very clean and the bar and front desk staff extremely attentive (we even received a complimentary packet of crisps with our champagne :-) ). We would definately also recommend the location of this hotel as it was an easy stroll to the shops, the old town and even down to the marina! Thanks Jazz Hotel ... I'll definately remember my proposal in Barcelona !!

<Title>“Fabulous hotel”
<Content>I came to Barcelona as a side 3 day trip on my trip to Spain. I chose the hotel based on Trip Advisor, and I can say it´s a great hotel.....very W-like, very modern with great design. Even the interior stairs are slate with glass rainlings and the room balconies have opague glass as the railing. The rooms are very comfortable, and the baths are high design and even have towel warmers. The breakfast was not terrific, but I am so pleased with the rest that it doesn´t matter. Free WiFi in the rooms - important to me, plus free internet computers in the bar. It´s located very conveniently, close to the Ramblas and one of the main plazas - Catalunya. From this plaza, you can get to and from the airport on one of the "blue" buses. It only costs 4 Euro, and runs constantly - saves a bunch on a taxi, especially since the Spanish cab drivers are known for taking advantage of tourists. Just an aside, but do the Spainish people ever joke around or even smile?

<Title>“great place, great city”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at the hotel Jazz in July 2007. Its taken me a while to get round to writing this review, but I felt that the hotel was so exceptional that it needed to be praised. This hotel is billed as a 3* and very reasonably priced. The hotel, in my opinion is more like a 4/4.5* (and I have often stayed in 4/5* hotels so I have good examples to compare with). The rooms were large, quiet, and spotlessly clean. The hotel and pool were also the same. There was never any problem for us to get a sun lounger (although it does get busier at weekends). The hotel is also fantastically placed for sightseeing and walking around barcelona. We did not eat in the hotel - no need to really, with starbucks and local shops with lovely croissants so close by for breakfast. Recommendations for nice bars: Milk bar (lovely food also), Qbar for relaxed and cheap drinks and Margarita blue is a delicious mexican. I recommend this hotel very highly.

High standard of room, very clean. Breakfast was buffet style, with a large variety. Staff were excellent - the waiter at breakfast remembered what we had to drink every morning & just brought it striaght out, without asking! Reception were also very helpful.

<Title>“Comfy, contemporary hotel”
<Content>Found a great deal for this hotel somewhere on the net, don't remember now. Stayed 4 nights. Perfect central location within Barcelona, 5 mins walk to central city station/ plaza. Had a room on a near top floor - thank goodness for lifts! Pool on top of roof, which unfortunately was closed by the time we reached back each evening from our galavanting, but it looked great! Great view from window, overlooking the busy streets below. No balcony or anything but not required. All services provided as expected in a new, large hotel. Not much character to it yet as it's pretty new, but it was more than satisfactory for a few nights sleep after busy days out. Booked twin i think, which were cose together but separate - I stayed with a cousin of the opposite gender so separate beds were required. Not somewhere for staying if you're looking to spend the day in the hotel. We literally used it as a base to shower and sleep with the extra comforts of a neat, contemporary and comfortable place to stay. Very close proximity to shops, restaurants,other hotels, public transport and so on. Great location. Great ice-cream vendor we named 'Luigi' at the bottom of the hotel in the street, a must! (and he was open late!) YUM! Highly recommended if you like a modern hotel with guaranteed cleanliness and all perks of a new hotel. Will add piccies.

<Title>“And All That Jazz!”
<Content>It was a mother and daughter weekend, with the daughter arriving from New York early in the morning and the mother at noon from Milan. We had booked a 3 day Winter Sales Package, which included a bottle of champagne upon arrival and daily breakfast. I had asked the hotel if my daughter could check in early and they did not promise that the room would be ready. But when she arrived, since the standard room that we had reserved was not ready, she was upgraded to a junior suite for free! We had a lovely large space divided in two by a half wall, with a flat screen tv in front of the bed and a couch on the other side. If you do not like contemporary architecture and design, pick another hotel. I love it, so I felt perfectly at home surrounded by linear furniture, black, brown and white decor, and a new clean wooden floor that felt so much nicer than the worn out carpets that usually cover hotel room floors. Black and white photos of jazz playing instruments hands decorate the walls of the hotel and of the rooms. Service was extremely quick and kind, everything worked well, the bathroom had both a tub and a shower (again, it was all black and white, if you are into antiques, or decorated details, go elsewhere), lots of amenities, a powerful hair dryer, the only thing missing is a little shelf inside the shower stall to put the soap or foam bottle. The location of the hotel is perfect, at a few minutes walk from Placa Catalunya, and the first stop of the Bus Turistic right across the street, next to the Metro stop. Breakfast was abundant and with lots of things to pick from, the different varieties of breads were delicious. Our room was on the third floor, so unfortunately we felt the vibrations of the Metro beneath us, but only until 11 pm, and then again from 6 am, though at that hour we were still deeply asleep. So if I were to return to the Jazz Hotel, which I certainly would do, I would ask for a room on a higher floor. The noise from the street was not a problem at all. It was our first trip to Barcelona and the choice of this hotel, recommended by a friend of a friend, made it perfect.

<Title>“Modern decor, comfortable room”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at Hotel Jazz for a long weekend in early February. This is a new hotel so the interiors feel fresh and new and it has a very modern design aesthetic. Our room was comfortable and clean although it was on the small side (14' x 16' approx.). But I have found this to be fairly common in major European cities in this price range. We were on the 7th/top floor and were impressed by how sound proof the french door/window was since the hotel is on a busy street. The only noise that disturbed us came from the hallway. This door definitely needs sound proofing. The hotel staff was helpful though not of four star service caliber. For example, when I checked in on my own (my husband arrived later in the day) I was struggling with my bags as I walked down the lobby steps. No other guests were in the lobby and none of the staff attempted to assist me (I don't think there are any bellboys here). So not a major let down -but if you love doting service this is not the place for you. The location is great - a few block away from Placa Cataluyna and the old city. Definitely check out the Boqueria food market on Las Ramblas. It is a unique experience where you can pick up prepared food as well as oogle over all the produce, meats, fish, spices, and baked goods in the market. We would happily return to Hotel Jazz.

<Content>Rooms very modern, stylish and clean, most rooms are on the main road but noise not noticeable on upper floors. Great terrace on top floor looking out over the city, bit cool for the pool in January though. Breakfast was very basic and definitely not made fresh daily, nice staff though who asked us if we wanted fresh eggs every morning which made up for it. Good location as well, 5 minute walk from Rambler and Gothic area, would go back if we got a good deal again!

SO easy to walk from the airport bus stop which only will cost you 4 euros! the staff is lovely, the breakfast is plentiful (make sure you get a deal with it in the room cost). They upgraded us to a suite- which was HUGE. loved the modern bathroom (except wish there was a shelf for products/soap in the shower.. besides that a perfect stay , i would recommend to all!

<Content>This hotel was brilliant value - a lovely hotel, friendly staff, great location and was perfect for our 3 night break in Barcelona! Great location, very near drop off point of the Airport bus and a very short 5 min walk to Las Ramblas. Also right beside Place de Catalunya where the official Barcelona Tour Bus goes from. The room was spotlessly clean and had a lovely modern feel to it. Nice flatscreen TV with 2 or 3 english channels. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful - we asked if they'd mind ringing up a restaurant to book us a table that night and they were more than willing to do so. The hotel also had wireless broadband so we brought our laptop and could look up reviews of restaurants, bars etc which was great. I've already recommended the hotel to lots of my friends as it was great value for such a lovely stay.

<Title>“New Year in Barca!”
<Content>This trip was a special one as it was Mr Chucklers 40th birthday. Mrs C had taken care of all the bookings and on that basis I can only assume the hotel made it very easy for her!!!! Good communication throughout the enquiry/booking process I am reliably informed - I was delighted on arrival as it was a total surprise! We would recommend a taxi from the airport for a 'no fuss/bother' way to reach the hotel. Cost €30. Mrs C had organised a bottle of champers and it duly arrived shortly after going to our room. The hotel is perfectly located 5 minutes walk from Playa Catalunya & Las Ramblas. There was a metro station 100 yards from the hotel door - perfect for exploring the city. It was great to be so close but yet out of the hustle & bustle of Las Ramblas! Check in was friendly and our room was very modern and clean - a superb range of toiletries were available too. Mrs C had booked a room on the 6th floor, following other Trip Advisor reviews and in fairness the metro rumble did not bother us at all. We did not have breakfast in the hotel as there is so much choice close by and at much better prices! In reality we enjoyed the hotel as a place to sleep and freshen up as Barcelona has so much to offer - one criticism would be that we did not find the beds overly conducive to a good nights sleep. For us the Harbour area was perfect....beautiful walks and lovely street cafes & bars line this spectacular area. One bonus was that we were able to obtain tickets to see Barca playing, albeit against a 3rd division side in the Copa del Rey. The ground is easy to get to from the hotel using the metro and is a must see on any trip to the city. All in all we would thoroughly recommend the Jazz - it lived up to its reviews! There is a great cafe next door to it and El Raco restaurant is also recommended (turn right at the front door).

Great position easy walking to the ramblas Previous posters had said about asking for a room on a high floor because of the metro noise we were glad we did as we could could still hear it faintly although not enough to disturb us. Rooms were really good and great bathroom with all those little extras you might have fogotten. Breakfast was included and was really nice we booked through roomsnet.com very good its my 4 booking with them We would stay again

<Content>Stayed there for 1 night on the 16th January 2008 and arrived very early (before 9am), expecting to be told no early check ins. Instead, was warmly welcomed and even given a free upgrade to a Junior Suite, which was nothing like the usual cramped sparse rooms normally found in Europe. The room was unbelievably spacious, had the most comfortable bed and a balcony where I could stand out on and watch the liveliness of the La Ramblas. Reception was extremely helpful and took the time to recommend sights, restaurants, and shops. The location could not have been more perfect and I was able to step out, go shopping and visit all the main sites within minutes of each other, mostly from just walking. I cannot recommend this hotel enough!

<Title>“Brilliant Location”
<Content>My husband and I went to Barcelona for the weekend and stayed at this hotel on recommdations from our in-laws. The hotel is in a prime position just at the top of Las Ramblas which is the mean street in Barcelona. This stretches from the middle right down to the Port. We loved this city, it was clean, friendly and quite easily accesable. Top tips. From Barcelona Airport jump on the bus marked Playa Catalunya for 3.90 euors each and this takes you straight to Las Ramblas. I think a cab would be around 25-30 euros so this is much better. Hotel Jazz is very comtemporty, clean with a lovely roof swimming pool. We were is room 506 which which I think a bit bigger than the rest however the hotel is great with very helpful staff. Las Ramblas is quite expensive in itself ( 2 large beers between 12-20 euros ) however there is entertainment all day and a great bustling street. Highly recomend Hard Rock Cafe ( at the top opposite the square ) and a small place called D'or which was opposite Hotel Jazz. Serves great wine and huge amounts of very reasonably priced Tapas. Also recomend the Open Top bus tour. Although it is 20 euros per head, it lasts around 3 hours but it the best way to see the city and its beatiful buildings. I guess it was quite quiet going in Jan compared to the middle of the year however we would defiantley go back here and also stay at this hotel !!!

Also the cleanliness, staff politness, and fittings. I would happly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a centrally based hotel for their short sight seeing trip. P.s. Just remember, the only slight dampner is the fact your have to buy breakfast as it's not included in room price.

<Content>Fantastic hotel in an ideal position in Barcelona, the hotel is luxurious, modern, and offer a fantastic service. The hotel staff are warm and welcoming, and are always more than happy to help. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and are inkeeping with the modern feel. Many facilities provided such as minibar, flat screen tv, air-conditioning, radio, hairdryers, and safe. The restraunt serves a wide range of breakfasts and the hotel also provides free internet access for all those staying at the hotel, plus other amenities such as luggage storage after checkout, and toilet and lounge areas. The hotel is situated only 5mins walk from the Placa de Catalunya (Main Square at the top of La Rambla) where all the bus tours leave for trips around Barcelona which are unmissable; they are only 23Eur per person for a two day ticket, and you are able to use the bus as many times and for as long as you want, and you can hop on an off when you feel, so you can enjoy the city at your own pace- well worth the money. Would definitely stay at this hotel again, had a great time.

<Content>At $165 per night it was a great comparative value as we had stayed one night at a sister hotel, U232 and were disappointed there. The room was clean and bright and we had a small balcony. The lobby is chic/stylish and the staff very helpful (they spoke good English). The staff provided excellent city information and materials as well as restaurant referrals (The Cellar de Tapas around the corner is out of the world yummy!). The location is perfect, a short walk to all of the action on Las Ramblas (strolling/shopping area). We did not do the breakfast, it was extra and we felt expensive. Wireless services work well and internet is available downstairs if you are without laptop. It must be nice in warm weather on their roof pool! I would definitely return to this hotel!

<Title>“Excellent value for money”
<Content>Booked this hotel after reading reviews on TripAdviser and my son and I were not disappointed. The hotel is indeed superbly located, not just given its location at the top of La Rambla but also because of the nearby metro stations at Universitat (got us effortlessly to the Camp Nou for the Real Madrid game) and Catalunya. Note also that the airport bus (A1) terminates a few minutes away in Plaza Catalunya - so you can get to the airport for just €3.50 each way. The room was simple but comfortable and well-appointed. Service was good (no problems to access a PC to print off online boarding passes) and the noise from the streets was tolerable. Of course the breakfast at €15 is over-priced, but why would anyone eat at the hotel with so many cafés nearby? We had coffee and pastries in nearby bars for a fraction of the price. The price was very reasonable, so we would recommend anyone to use this hotel. We will certainly use it again.

<Content>Most of what you read about Hotel Jazz is true--Great location, clean, modern, and (in our case, anyway) friendly, helpful staff. My only gripe--The breakfast was VERY expensive. Not worth it, except for the convenience. But that's ok...there are tons of restaurants close by, and trying them just added to the overall travel adventure.

<Title>“Great location and room, but minimal services”
<Content>We spent a week at the Hotel Jazz. I can't say enough about the location, just about every neighborhood is walkable from the hotel. The entire hotel is extremely well taken care of, and the room on the 7th floor had a nice little balcony and was clean and elegantly designed/furnished. Unlike previous reviewers, I did not experience any subway rumble or noise, and the double paned glass really did a good job of keeping street noise to a minimum. As long as you appreciate Hotel Jazz for what it is, and come to terms with it's shortcomings it's a solid choice. In some ways it is more like an apartment stay than a full service hotel. My complaints have to to with the services. There are really no public spaces to speak of, so if you get a little stir crazy in your room you are out of luck. There is a very small bar area, but it closed around 9:30 pm on the two nights we tried to go there! The breakfast is expensive, and in no way worth it. The staff are either helpful, or very unhelpful. There are times when there is only one person at the desk which can be frustrating. When unhelpful, the staff borders on rude. We had bad experiences with room service as well with it not being delivered at all on two occasions. Their toiletries were also pretty disappointing. Were I to return, I would bring my own. In addition, their recommendations for restaurants and the like are pretty awful. I can wholeheartedly recommend a new restaurant in the area on Ramblas Catalunya (I think #13) called Mata Mala. We are foodies, and this place was not a tourist trap like what the hotel recommends, but was a modern ingredients-driven place that we really liked. It is one block off Place Catalunya.

<Title>“Fault free Hotel Jazz”
<Content>I stayed at the Hotel Jazz for a week in December and think that it's probably the best hotel I've stayed in - not in terms of facilities as these are limited but in terms of the quality of the location, rooms and staff. The hotel is a couple of minutes away from the old town so you are right in the middle of excellent shops and bars but the rooms are quiet and restful. The staff speak excellent english and are helpful and polite. The rooms are well decorated with great bathrooms, TV and free wifi. On the downside there is no restaurent (although breakfast is available) but there are literally dozens of cafes and restaurents all around the hotel. It's one of those rare hotels where everything works as it should.

<Title>“Cool Style in Centre of town”
<Content>We stayed here for three nights and paid £71 per night room only. Breakfast is an extra €15 per person and is a tad overpriced for what you can get. The reception area is very austere but our room was great. We got an upgrade to a junior suite. The colour themes of the Jazz might take some getting used to but we found it to be fine. The bathroom was kitted out with black marble tiles throughout and white porcelain. It had both a separate shower and a bath with a shower. Plenty of towels. The beds were firm and comfortable. There's a minibar (not too expensive) but no hot beverages in the room. The hotel is exceedingly well situated for the centre of activity in Barcelona, just a couple of blocks from Placa de Catalunya but far enough away from the noise of the Ramblas. There's some traffic noise even through the double glazing and you can hear the rumbleof the Metro trains as far as the sixth floor but unless you're really very fussy about sound these won't disturb you. If arriving by bus from the Airport (€3.90) dismount at Universitat as this stop is less than 2 mins walk from the hotel. The service is quick and easy.To return by bus it's necessary to go Placa de Catalunya. The are many sights to be seen in Barcelona and the 'Bus Turistico' covers most of these in 2 separate 2hr long circuits from Placa de Catalunya (€19 or €23 if spread over 2 days). The bar shuts at midnight at weekends, 11pm other days. This is a 3 star hotel and there's no night porterage. If dining out the dozens of tapas bars offer great value. The same can't be said of the two restaurants that we used: Mussol on Carrer de Casp whose food definitions left a lot to be desired and who billed us in our local currency at poor exchange rates despite our refusal to sign an agreement to this action. El Gran Restaurant on Carrer d'Avinyo which despite an interesting decor rushed us through our courses at breakneck speed.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay”
<Content>I booked a 3 night stay at Hotel Jazz for myself and my daughter after reading some great reports on Trip Advisor. We certainly werent disappointed and the tips other reviewers had given about getting the Aerobus from the airport and getting off at Universitat were spot on! It was so easy and quick and at 3 euros 90 each way it was a bargain too. Would probably have got a taxi if I hadnt read this website! The hotel was a short walk from the bus stop and the rooms were modern and comfortable. We had a view of a busy street, but being on the 6th floor noise was not really a problem. The Christmas lights outside made a lovely view from our window. We had a drink at the hotel bar each night before going out but the bar was deserted and we were often the only people there, which mean there wasnt a lot of atmosphere in the place. We eat at Sinatra's (just off Plaza Real) one night and can highly recommend. Also ate at Cellar de Tapas (much recommended on this site), which was very good. On our final night we ate at La Fonda at Port Olympic where the food and atmosphere were fantastic. Would definitely recommend. TAlthough it was the 'poshest' of the three restaurants we visited it actually worked out the cheapest. The hotel receptionist told us we would not get in without a booking, but we secured a table on arrival with no problem. Staff were very friendly and we got complimentary liquers where they simple brought the bottle and the shot glasses and left it on the table with us! The port area was very quiet in the evening (compared to my last visit in September). The hotel location was excellent for accessing many areas of the city and only a short walk from Plaza Catalunya where the open top bus tours began. All in all a very enjoyable trip, although if you are going to Barcelona for the shopping, you may be a little disappointed...we have had much better elsewhere. Go to the Jazz, you will not be disappointed!

<Title>“All that Jazz”
<Content>I booked this hotel following good reviews on various websites and I am glad I did. This was the first trip to Barcelona for my wife and I.We booked three nights stay at the Hotel Jazz which is perfectly located near the main area not far from the Ramblas. The hotel is clean,modern and has good facilities including a rooftop pool and solarium.There are also free toiletries in case you forget the essentials.Our room also had a mini bar which was useful for keeping our wine and drinks cool after a long day sightseeing! We found the free internet access useful for keeping in touch with home.The only thing lacking in our opinion was that there was no tea/coffee making facilities in the room. If like us you prefer to eat breakfast outside the hotel I would suggest the Cafe De L'Opera on the Ramblas as a good option. Also a good tip is to go to El Cortes Ingles Department Store a short walk away,go to the Cafe on the top floor,get a window seat,order a coffee and admire the stunning views across the city. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.

<Title>“Modern Jazz”
<Content>Very nice place, well located, sexy modern design of rooms (and hotel in general). Very clean. Friendly staff. Beautiful swimming pool on roof of hotel. The hotel has free wifi. Everything is very good in this hotel. The only "negative" point I saw is that rooms on the north side are less calm because of the main road, and vibrations from the metro. (I had the chance of also testing a room on the other side, which is noise-less) But all room windows are solid, modern, double-glazing so really it's NOT a big problem, noise is minimal, it's what you would expect from living in the center of an international town.

<Title>“good hotel”
<Content>great location. nice modern decor. very clean and comfortable room. There is only one little thing to improve- the shower head should not be installed above the middle of the narrow tub. You have to stand either in the front half of the tub, where some of the space is taken up by a towel rack, or the rear half, where there isn't much room to stand with the curb of the tub. This is more a review for the hotel. It's just a minor discomfort. I would strongly recommend it to fellow travelers.

<Title>“Very Good”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Jazz for four nights in August 2006. We booked our room based on tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed - all the positives and negatives reflected on tripadvisor were there. Hotel Jazz is conveniently located within a few blocks of metro and a major square. We had no trouble finding it after stumbling off our plane into Barcelona. The rooms are very clean and modern. The windows eliminate nearly all street noise. Our bed was comfortable. The maid service was respectful and did good work. The concierge was very helpful and spoke great english - all our special requests were met. The hotel has a nice bar and restaurant with good food. The rooftop bar was cool and well attended. Our only gripe was that the metro runs right below this hotel and you will feel and hear it no matter what floor you are on. Even if you sleep with earplugs (like us), you will still feel the vibrations of the metro and it takes some getting used to. Fortunately, we were so tired every night from so much incredible sightseeing that we passed out and generally did not notice the trains rumbling below.

<Title>“Beds not great here”
<Content>I stayed 4 nights at this hotel 14 -18 November on recommendations from Tripadvisor. This hotel is fine generally, clean rooms, although some of the furnishings are getting a little worn (e.g. worn desk edges; cracked and flaking plaster coming loose from bathroom ceiling, not great). However my main complaint is the beds - they were wobbly/saggy - not the standard of firm, luxuriant beds (e.g.Westin) you'd expect of a hotel of this cool, minimalist profile - and not what you'd expect of a hotel that charges 180 euros plus per night. I slept on floor 2 of the nights as I couldn't bear the lack of support in the bed. This does not add to the pleasure of your holiday. Also the hotel generally lacks any warmth or character - an anonymous experience; staff don't give you much, it's all a bit sterile. Generally the hotel is fine if you like peace and quiet (it was very quiet - 7th floor in any event) but not if you appreciate a really good bed.

<Title>“Hotel Jazz - Superb!”
<Content>I stayed at the Hotel Jazz on business in early October 2007. The hotel is in a brilliant location about 5 minutes walk to the top of the Ramblas and 10 minutes to the Gothic Quarter. It's right in the centre of the city in a nice area but far enough away from the tourist trail to enjoy the real Barcelona! The reception staff were friendly, helpful and polite throughout the stay. The room was excellent, well equipped and comes with a comfy bed. The terrace on the top floor provides a great view of the city and a nice pool to cool off in! I didn't eat in the hotel but the menu was reasonably priced. That said, there are some great little places to eat out within 2 minutes walk if you fancy tapas, pizza and such like. I highly recommend the Jazz if you visit Barcelona, I already know where I will be staying again in the future.

<Title>“Terrific and Brilliantly located hotel”
<Content>Myself and my husband stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of November. Hotel and room were excellent....loved the decor. Having a drink in the Jazz bar was a great way to kick off the night! I found the business area in the Jazz bar particularly useful for keeping in touch with home and checking the bank balance!! What was best of all was the wonderful location - just a few minutes walk from La Rambla and Place De Catulyana. We were able to take the bus back to the Airport from here. We could have taken it from the airport also if we had known how convenient it would be but when visiting a city for the first time we usually want to get to our hotel with the minimum of fuss. Other reviewers has mentioned the tapas bar - Cellar de Tapas- in placa de Universitas just around the corner so we went there on our last night.............it was absolutely fantastic. I would recommend it highly. All in all the Jazz hotel was a wonderful experience and I would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Excellent for University and Plaza Catalunya”
<Content>Hotel is less than 5 minutes walk from the central old university and very near to Plaza Catalunya and La Ramblas. Style is very modern so your first impression on walking through the door is indicative of the decor in the rooms. I had a double/twin room on the second floor. The room was spotless, if a little cramped, but I didn't feel short on space. Noise was occasionally a problem with late-night revellers (this could be a problem in any hotel in Barcelona), sound from room upstairs (heels on wooden flooring) and a distant rumble from the metro below. The bathroom was also spotless, well equipped and with good freebies. Buffet breakfast was good with good choice of hot and cold, although you could get better value in local cafe-bars.

<Title>“amazing stay”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel Jazz from the 6th until the 8th of October this year. It was our third time to Barcelona but our frist time staying here. We were not disappointed. It was a gorgeous hotel. Staff at check in were very friendly and even though we arrived early we were able to check in straight away. Our room was very large and it had a small balconette that you could look out over the city. Lots of products in the bathroom. Great pressure in the shower. The location of the hotel is ideal. It's about a five minute walk from Placa de Catalunya and the Ramblas. There's a lovely tapas bar opposite the hote. The rooftop pool,,while small, is great to have and the views are amazing. I will definitely stay here again when I return to Barcelona. Check out was quick and they had a taxi for us in about four minutes.

<Title>“excellent hotel”
<Content>Chose this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and the reasonable price, compared with other well-rated hotels. We thought it was a great hotel - modern, well decorated, comfortable rooms and friendly, helpful staff. Also only a short walk to Placa Catalunya and La Rambla. The Cellar de Tapas restaurant mentionned by one or two others was excellent, and just round the corner from the hotel. When we asked reception about it, we were given vouchers for a free glass of wine. We also found a cocktail bar just round the corner called Milano - it had a lovely atmosphere and played jazz music - its on Rhonda de Universitat walking towards Placa Catalunya, its entrance is part of Bracafe, on the left. Other places we ate in and loved were Cafe de L'Academia and Los Caracoles - the latter was fantastic - great atmosphere and good food and interesting surroundings - don't order the lobster though unless you are feeling flush!!! We used the open top bus on our first day - its a good way to familiarise yourself with the city - we travelled on both the red and blue routes, stopping off at one or two places en route. We then used the second day to further explore areas we liked the look of. We loved Barcelona and can't wait to go back.

<Title>“Fantastic!!”
<Content>This hotel is superb! It's in an ideal location if you don't mind walking and taking in the sights. It's ideal if you don't want to be taling taxis everywhere. We tended to walk down the Ramblas early morning and stay out until 3ish and then go back to the hotel to relax by the roof-top pool. Towels are provided which is bonus if your just on a city break - extra packing room! You can even ring down to the bar for drinks whilst you sun-bathe. The rooms are of an excellent quality, contempory design with good air conditioning. We arrived at 10am in the morning and were allowed to check in. Over-all if I went back I would definatley stay here again and have recommended it to many friends. Kirsten & Scott, Staffs UK.

<Title>“Superb!”
<Content>Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Jazz. I made the booking after reading great the reviews. Lived upto expectations and more. Cannot say anything negative. Yes you can hear faint rumble from the metro but was not a problem at all, don't let this put you off. The hotel is situated in great position, handy for everything yet not too busy and noisy, 5 minutes to top of Las Ramblas. The rooms are fab, modern,very clean, and spacious. Great shower! The staff were very helpful. The barman recommended excellent Tapas bar round the corner on Place de Universitaire, went twice it was brilliant. Breakfast may seem expensive but well worth it. The selection was great, bacon,eggs, cereal, beautiful fresh fruit, pastries, breads and unlimited tea and coffee. Not sure you could find a better breakfast for less. Set us up for the day! Overall a great experience and would highly recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Great hotel”
<Content>I spent 3 nights at the Hotel Jazz. It is a great hotel. The location is extremely convenient, with easy access to all parts of Barcelona by Metro, bus, or walking. I walked mostly, as most areas to visit were within 10-15 minutes. The front desk staff was consistently friendly and helpful. The rooftop pool area was nice. On several nights, I watched the sun set up there, and it was quite beautiful. The pool was not well heated, and so I didn't spend much time swimming but some other guests did. The rooms are very modern with all necessary appointments. My only minor criticism is the thermostat in the room was a bit tricky to work, but once I figured out the controls this was fine as well. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Barcelona.

<Title>“excellent!!”
<Content>we stayed in the hotel jazz for 2 nights,one night pre-cruise and one night post-cruise. arrived mid-afternoon on a friday,check-in was a breeze,took 5 minutes! we got a fantastic room on the front corner of the hotel which was huge,i enjoyed the decor of the hotel,even the bathroom had the "jazz theme"!! the room had all the amenities you could want,we heard little or no noise from the subway underneath(we were 5th floor 1st night,2nd floor 2nd night). hotel was only a 5 minute walk from las ramblas,there was a great irish pub around the corner(scobies) and a good pizza place next door to the hotel(rainbow). we had the breakfast in the hotel,the reviews are right,its way overpriced at €15 each but we took it as we hadn't much time to see the city and find somewhere else. check-out was as easy as check-in,no problems!! on our return from the cruise for our 2nd night in the jazz we arrived at 08.00,they had no rooms ready but stored our luggage until we returned around noon when they had a room ready. the second room wasn't as big as the first but it was still lovely,again we'd no problems! in short an excellent hotel for a short stay,it's expensive but once you've read the reviews here you'll know what to expect,i'd recommend it highly and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>We had a great stay at Hotel Jazz. The room was spacious, comfortable, clean and amazingly quiet. The rooftop pool was an added bonus. Good view of the surrounding area and a very comfortable place to rest our feet after a day of walking around. The free internet (2 computers - intended only for fairly quick use) was in the bar which made it easy to hang around and wait when others were using them. The location is great. We would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Excellent location”
<Content>Title says it all -- it's in an excellent location. Simply get the bus from the airport and get off at the 3rd stop, cross the road and you're at the hotel. It's a couple of minute walk to Placa Catalunya, which makes it an ideal base for going just about anywhere. We didn't need to use many of the hotel facilities -- there are loads of cafes nearby where you can have breakfast for about 2 euros, and an excellent tapas restaurant (Celler de Tapas) just round the corner. The room was clean and well-appointed, and the reception staff very helpful.

<Title>“Brilliant location”
<Content>Booked this hotel based entirely on trip advisor reviews and it more than lived up to expectations. As the reason for the trip to Barcelona was a special 40th birthday celebration, I asked the hotel for a room with a view, on a high floor (remembered previous reviews mentioning the noise of the metro) and requested a bottle of cava on ice on arrival - everything I asked for was provided and the cava was chilled to perfection!! Location of the hotel was brilliant, about a five minute walk to Las Ramblas, just around the corner from the nearest metro station with plenty of bars and restaurants on your doorstep. The hotel rooms are spacious and modern, with an absolutely huge bed and trendy bathroom. We were on the 7th floor and whilst we could heard the rumble of the metro, it wasn't a major issue. There's lots to see and do in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend getting a two day tourist bus pass that takes you everywhere you need to go - it's great value for money and good fun too. Hotels in Barcelona are not cheap and the Jazz is no exception but if you want a good location, nice room and friendly staff, then the Jazz is perfect. p.s. if you like Sangria I would definitely recommend the Sangria de Cava served in the Jazz bar - it's scrummy!

<Title>“Excellent treatment by front desk staff”
<Content>Westayed twice, before and following a Mediteranean cruise. Despite arrivng before Noon (once before 8:00 AM), we were permitted to occupy a room that had been made ready! Tips to supplement the other positive reviews: (1) We reserved through Venere.com, which does not require advance payment. (2) We learned to take advantage of Hotel Jazz's (pronounced "Yazz" in Barcelona) 14 Euro per person breakfast. That seemed expensive until we saw how little we got for 10 Euros at a local bar/coffee shop. The Jazz breakfast issumptious and exceeds most hotel based buffet breakfasts in the US. (3) At check-in, learn how to use the (a) credit card type room key to turn on all power in the room and (b) thermostat. Neither is obvious to the first-time US traveler to Europe. (4) The evening desk clerk's dinner recommendations were uniformly good.

<Title>“Great Location & Hotel”
<Content>After spending many hours reading reviews on hotels in Barcelona and trying to get the combination of a good hotel in the right location we were very happy with the choice. We stayed for 6 nights at Jazz in September with the highlights for us being 1) the location - few mins walk from La Rambla on main road rather than hidden in a backstreet...easy to find 2) the pool - a very relaxing way to spend the late afternoon relaxing on the deck after exploring the streets of Barcelona. 3) the rooms - modern, very clean and had everything we needed. Our room was on 5th floor facing the street which had excellent sound proofing and most importantly air conditioning that worked 4) The breakfast - although expensive (15 Euro) was good quality. 5) The 2 PC's near the bar with free internet connection were very handy. Only negative was some serious water damage to the ceiling in the bathroom which they hadn't repaired. Not a very nice site considering the rest of the room/hotel was so well presented.

<Title>“Jazz is Cool”
<Content>Wow! Fabulous Hotel. Great location, beautifully decorated. We took the Aerobus from the airport right into Universistat (3rd stop on the line) and just walked across the square to the hotel entrance. Couldn't have been any easier. Just off La Ramblas and near Metro stations, etc. Safe, quiet and very, very clean. The full breakfast for 2 was very good but overpriced at $45.00 (US) so on subsequent days we just ordered the coffee for $6.00 (US). The restaurant staff was helpful and accomodating as was the front desk. They advertise free wi-fi in every room, but our signal was too weak to be able to use the laptop we brought with us. However, in the Jazz Bar area near the restaurant are 2 hard-wired computers that are free to use. Very helpful to be able to check emails and talk to the kids you left at home. Don't miss the day trip to the Torres Winery / Montserrat / Sitjes that is offered by the Catalunya Bustourista (get info from the "i" information booth located underground at Catalunya Plaza, one block away from the hotel) The Montserrat tour the hotel pushes is overpriced.

<Title>“Good choice for business or pleasure”
<Content>The hotel Jazz is my hotel of choice whenever I am in Barcelona on business or pleasure. It is extremely convenient for the metro (10 meters) and an easy walk to Las Ramblas, Placa Catalunya etc but far enough out to be reasonably quiet. Not quite sure why it is only a 3* as I have stayed in worse 4 star hotels.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at Hotel Jazz for three nights after an 8-day cruise. I booked the Jazz through their website in January. Before I get into the hotel stay itself, I do want to point out one HUGE negative. As I said, I booked the hotel through their website, and the website advises that you will get a confirmation email directly from the hotel. We never did, so I emailed them in February asking them to confirm. I never heard back. I emailed them again in March, and I never heard back. I emailed them again in April and finally, in May, I received an email confirming our reservation. Four weeks before our trip, I was checking reservations, and for some reason, our reservation number didn't show up on their website. I again emailed them asking what happened and asking them to please confirm. We heard NOTHING. In the space of 4 days, I emailed the hotel three times and the home office (Nunez Navarro) once and never got a response. Then, the reservation number showed up on the website again. Hmm. Thankfully, we did have a room when we got there. The good stuff: The front desk staff does speak English. . .some better than others. They checked us in immediately, and we went to our room on the 7th floor. The bedroom and bathroom were extremelly clean. I liked the fact that the floor was wood laminate so that it was very clean. Everything was spotless and in its place. I will say, however, that the furnishings are spartan. If you are used to the *new* beddings in American hotels, don't expect them here. While the beds were comfortable, they didn't have the fluffy mattress covers, fluffly pillows or the comforters so many hotels have now. These beds are flat with dowdy bedspreads and hard pillows on them. But, that being said, they were not that uncomfortable. The hotel's location is great. It's about a 5-minute walk from Placa Catalunya and the top of Las Ramblas, a block from Starbuck's, in the middle of a university/residential area. While you can feel the subway when it runs below the hotel, it's not really that bad. And, with the window (balcony door) closed, you won't hear the traffic and pedestrian noise. . .And, because we were there during Feste de la Merce, there were both kinds of traffic 24-hours a day. While the front desk personnel was polite, most of them didn't go out of their way to help with much. They didn't know anything about Feste happenings, and some of the information they gave us on banks, airport and restaurants was wrong. The best person working the front desk was Alejandro, who works the evening shift. When he didn't know something, he admitted it and then tried to get the right information for us. His English was also the best of all the hotel personnel. So, all that being said, we would book this hotel again.

<Title>“Central and great value”
<Content>My partner and i went for 3 nights to this hotel. We had read the great reviews and we had to agree with them. The hotel is very central - just a alleyway or two from La Ramblas. The room was nice - wooden floor which you dont normally see in hotels and comfy beds and a nice bathroom. The hotel is boutique in style so dont go here if you are looking for period features or old spanish charm. But if you like clean and modern this is the place for you! The roof pool made this hotel for me because it changed the feel from city break to "holiday" and it was fab to leave the hustle and bustle of the busy streets and chill on the very nice loungers beside the pool! so no complaints whatsoever - we never had breakfast in the hotel because it was really expensive - we used to go out to pavement cafes for gorgeous hot croissaints and coffee so cant comment on food and drink but everything else was great!

<Title>“We're loving the Jazz...”
<Content>We were absolutely delighted with this modern, clean hotel in the centre of Barcelona and would rate it as the best we've stayed in for the money (spent roughly the same in Venice, Rome, Florence and Amsterdam and all were ok but this was exceptional value for money). We were on the 7th floor and can honestly say we couldn't hear the underground metro (and we had 6 nights to test it in!) and the roof top pool was really lovely - good quality sun furniture with towels supplied and, needless to say, very impressive views. We didn't use the drinks/food service by the pool but other people did and we heard them comment on the speed and ease of service. All staff we came across were very helpful and the hotel was very central - about 5 mins stroll from Las Ramlas. There is a stop for the city tour bus directly opposite the hotel. Go and enjoy, you won't regret it and we will definitely be going back.

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel and Great Location”
<Content>I stayed at Hotel Jazz pre-cruise. We had 3 rooms reserved and all three rooms were great. They upgraded both my husband and I and my husband's parents to suites, which was such a welcome sight after the long night/day of flying. The location was perfect. All the cafes and shopping you could possibly want were right out the front door. You could also get on the HOHO bus just around the corner. We stayed at a different hotel on the return from our cruise, only because Jazz was already booked, and although it was nice, we were all wishing we were back at Jazz. My husband and I agreed that we will visit Barcelona again - we had such a great time there - and when we do, we will definitely stay at Hotel Jazz.

<Title>“Lived up to expectations”
<Content>Returned from the Jazz on the 6th Sept 07. Not going to repeat all what the reviews have said before as it is all correct absolutely cannot complain about anything. We can only say we wish we had stayed another day to see more of the sights of Barcelona. Perhaps only disappointment would be that we e-mailed the hotel to say we would be staying with them for our honeymoon (got married 31st Aug 07) and nobody even acknowledged it. Barcelona beautiful city, Jazz wonderful hotel. We will be going back again soon I hope to them both.

<Title>“Really Excellent Hotel - Hotel Jazz”
<Content>We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Jazz. We would really recommend this hotel. It is really central and easy to find either by Metro or if you use the Aerobus as it is so close to La Rambla and Placa Catalunya. The Hotel itself was modern and clean. The staff were helpful and friendly. The breakfast catered for all tastes. The swimming pool was a useful area to relax after a hard day's sight seeing! It also offered really great value for money. Ask for a room on the 4th Floor or above to aviod the Metro disturbing you too much!

<Content>Clean, comfortable hotel with friendly, knowledgable staff Location is perfect, approx 3 mins walk from La Ramba so far enough away to avoid the hussle & fuss, but with 2 metro stations (Placa de Catalyuna & Univeristat) within 200 yards, the whole city is easily accessible The room had everything you could ask for really, an enormous bed, air con, a reasonably priced mini bar, tv, safe & a very fancy bathroom The hotel bar is a little quite, but with hundreds of bars to chose from in Barcelona this isn't really a problem The roof top pool is brilliant but was quite crowed the couple of times we used it. There's a large terrace area available to spill over if needed though

<Title>“best hotel ever”
<Content>We were on a short 2 days trip to Barcelona, and haven't a reservation. Friendly staff at the desk, and a few minutes later we've been in our room. A studio, with a large double bed and an extensible sofa in a small living room, adjacent to the main sleeping area. Large, modern, bathroom. All furniture and room decoration in great, modern, tasteful shape and design. Great location, steps away from Placa Catalunya that is a start point for many city tour busses. Internet is included in the price, with good wireless speed. We've got the breakfast included for 3 persons, and it was excellent. Parking is a little tight, but for small cars should be fine. We've got a semi-large, crossover type of car, and it was a little hard to park it in the assigned space. Folding outside mirrors, definitely helped. Other than that, the only minor complaint would involve the lighting in the bathroom: a little too dim for a morning close shave. All for around 240Euros, including parking, breakfast, Internet, studio room for 3 people.

<Title>“OK but nothing to rave about - pool area dirty and not enough sunbeds”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Jazz over the bank holiday weekend - the same time as some of the other reviewers. I'd booked the hotel (in January) on the basis of the other reviews on tripadvisor. Arrived late afternoon - after 3 o'clock - room not ready. However not really a problem we only had a 5 minute wait. We ended up in a junior suite (upgrade) - so maybe it was not a bad thing to be last to arrive on that day! it was on the 4th floor and the metro is very loud - it does keep you awake and the room does shake a little from the vibration of the trains which do seem to run all night. The suite had a small seating area which faced a wall - so not really that useful - certainly wouldn't pay for a junior suite. Hotel was clean, great location and staff were helpful - only real gripe is that went upto the pool on Bank holiday monday late afternoon - not a sun bed to be had - other than the ones littered with old towels and dirty plates and glasses. It was really dirty and not inviting at all. No towels, though eventually tracked a one down, which we shared and managed to sit round by the tables and chairs which was fine. Its OK but not as great as you reviews lead to you to believe - great location but nothing to write home about. For a good trip whilst in Barcelona why not try Fat Tire Bike Tours - really good way to see the city and great fun as well.

The hotel is just perfect; great location, very nice modern rooms, big bathroom, friendly staff and delicious breakfast - nothing to complain about. Thers's a pool at the top hotel but as we were in Barcaonly a couple of days we didn't have time to try it. The only other hotel in Barca I would consider is another hotel in the same chain, the 1898 which I,ve heard is great too.

<Title>“Great stay in Barca”
<Content>I just returned from a 5 day stay at Hotel Jazz, and was very pleased with the experience. The hotel is in an excellent location, within blocks of both the Placa Catalunya and Universitat metro stops and a five minute walk to the top of Las Ramblas, making access to almost anywhere in the city very easy. The rooms were modern and clean, as were the bathrooms (with good water pressure). The staff was very accomodating, and in particular gave consistently good restaurant recommendations. The Intranet terminals were very handy for checking emails, weather conditions, etc. There are a few small blips: I was on the fifth floor and could hear (and feel) the metro rumbling by, which kept me awake part of the first night until I got used to it. Also, there are no tea / coffee facilities in the room, so a warm cup of tea before bed is a non-starter. But, these are minor details. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Very good until the Brits arrived”
<Content>I'm giving the hotel a good review as I think that on the whole it was very good. Everything said in these reviews was accurate: the room was very clean and well presented, the position was great for us (I had stayed in the middle of the Barri Gotic before, but preferred it here, as we got to go North to the Gracia area as well), and breakfast was very good. The concierge gave 2 excellent restaurant reviews, including Patagonia steakhouse and the El Raco which was 2 minutes away, very unusual, tasty and well priced. All in all, it's usually worth asking, as their recommends were always better than our gos at finding somewhere to eat! Took the Bus Turistic for 2 days (only 23 Euros per person for 2 days, which was a bargain) and had some lovely strolls around the Barri Gotic and the areas around the hotel. The rooftop pool was also very nice, and we had some very peaceful afternoons up there (watch out for the bird scarer - scares the begeebies out of you first time!). On our fourth day, our afternoon by the pool was ruined by a large group of Brits who (as we have seen so many times before on holiday) acted like they owned the place, behaved very badly, were loud, drunk and did not attempt to control their children (one of whom threw a ball off the 9th floor onto the street below). It completely spoiled our afternoon, although we understand that this was not the fault of the hotel. As we were checking out, we noticed that a large British Hen Party were checking in, so we can only think that we timed that right. When will Brits abroad start to understand that there are other people around, and that a little consideration goes a long way. Anyway, please don't let this put you off this very good hotel. We would def return.

The pool was small but fine and it's up on the roof so you get lots of sun .The hotel location was ideal and you could walk everywhere and there are plenty of restaraunts near by . If I go back to Barcelona I would definately stay at this hotel again.

<Title>“Nice modern hotel”
<Content>The Hotel Jazz is in a very good location, it is clean and modern. The pool is only small but there is ample terrace space for sunbathing. It had great shower facilities for check out day, lots of people put their cases behind their sunbeds and stayed as late a possible before heading to the airport. The breakfast was super, much more than the average 'continental' and well worth getting a deal that includes it in the cost. The free internet access was a bonus and the bar was very pleasant with a relaxed atmosphere. The staff all spoke English and were helpful and polite. My only complaint was our room was too dark. The hairdryer was in the bathroom and there was no mirror at the dressing table. Not great for ladies getting ready as I had to wait for the steam of the shower to clear before I could do hair and makeup! Might sound petty but with 2 ladies getting ready it would be a pain.

<Title>“Clean Modern Great Location and Friendly”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Jazz back in June.Once off the plane we were shattered so opted for a taxi which costed in the region of 20 - 25 euros which we felt quite reasonable. The hotel is very clean and modern. The room itself was not huge but more than adequate for our short stay. All appliances are modern and clean. We found the staff to be very helpful from the reception all the way to the chamber maids. The breakfast was very nice with all the cereals, jams, fruits, breads we could want, along with all the meats and cheeses we didn't want ( although the Spanish guests tucked into these and seemed content!) The location is excellent even to the point of the City bus tour stopping right outside the hotel. My only quarm with the hotel was that the bar shut early which you could understand as we didn't actually ever see anyone in it. But as someone who enjoys winding down with a beer and large gin in his hotel before retiring to his room after a long day and night, I did miss this facility. There is a mini bar in the room, but as we all know, its not the same. this would not stop me staying at this hotel again. I only mention this because I am doing a review and to be pre-warned is to be pre-armed!

<Title>“fab - some extra tips”
<Content>Great location & good value. I booked with the hotel direct (via email) and got a good deal on a family room which gave us a lovely corner room with two double beds separated by a partition. We drove from England so wanted parking - they have a small but very secure underground parking area which they charge 22Euros/night for. However the staff were fantastically helpful with perfect English and on check-out they let us have the parking free - Fab :-) The rooftop pool can get busy late afternoon and some people seem to try and reserve beds for the day despite not being there - just move their towels off and relax!!! The supermarket 200metres down La Rambla is useful for snacks etc and cheap wine (pack a corkscew). There is no kettle in the room - so pack a travel kettle if you want. Lots of restaurants about - avoid the ones directly on La Rambla (small portions and overpriced). Stayed in hundreds of hotels and this has to be one of the best - especially the helpful staff.

Air conditioning was superb and a definite must at this time of year. Swimming pool on the roof is an added bonus and was very clean and not busy at all. There are sunbeds surrounding the pool and we never had a problem getting one. Location is fantastic, about 5 minute walk from the top of La Ramblas. Hotel sits on busy road but we never had a problem with traffic noise. We were on the 7th floor!!

<Title>“Very Nice Hotel in a convenient location”
<Content>We just returned from a 10 day tour of Spain followed by a Mediterranean Cruise. We stayed at the Hotel Jazz one night following the cruise and found it to be a wonderful experience. Prior to the cruise we stayed at the Rick Steves recommended Hotel Continental Barcelona, paying almost the same price for much inferior accommodations. We did this to meet up with some traveling companions who had already booked the Hotel Continental. The Hotel Jazz is one and a half blocks off the west end of La Rambla and Catalonia Square. There are numerous good restaurants and other facilities in the neighborhood. We found two excellent restaurants on the streets just west of Catalonia Square. Back to the Hotel Jazz. The check in was easy, with the staff speaking English very well. We checked in at 10 am and the room was surprisingly ready. We had asked for a room away from the street but none were available. This turned out not to be a problem as the windows were double paned and the Spanish traffic is much quieter than in Italy. Not a problem for a light sleeper. The room was very large, clean, and bright, just as shown in pictures on the hotel internet site. The room and lobby are very modern. The bed was excellent, this from someone who is extremely critical. My wife also loved her tub. They have two free internet computer terminals. They do not have a printer, but claimed you could email things to their address and they would print it at the front desk. On the same floor as the computers there is a pleasant bar and two large rooms where breakfast is served. It is 15 euro per person and looked very good, although we did not partake. Our rate was 110 euro plus tax. Not inexpensive, but very reasonable for Barcelona, which seems to be the most expensive city in Spain for hotel rooms. Highly recommended.

<Title>“Stay here soon!!”
<Content>Stay here when you come to Barca. It is the best hotel for a comfortable friendly and clean experience. Staff are fantastic, very welcoming and friendly, speak excellent English if your Catalan or Spanish isnt up to scratch! Pool is great for a midday break between trips around the city, with great views and lots of sun chairs, plus tables to have drinks. Breakfast is a bit pricey but worth it once in a while when your feeling lazy in the morning. Our room was very nice, comfortable, modern without being cold, nice bathroom, great shower which I consider essential, air conditioning, great safe which unusually the hotel will accept liability for if something is stolen (up to 600 euro worth). Central location without being too noisy at night, you can hear the metro rumble occassionally, but this never affected me, I only ever noticed when I was awake. Also its very reasonable!

<Title>“Enjoyable Stay”
<Content>We just returned from a 1 night pre-cruise stay and a 5 night post-cruise stay at the Hotel Jazz. All in all, we enjoyed this hotel very much - from the prime location, the comfortable bed, the linens and the helpfulness of the staff - in particular, Marien. I had actually double-booked a stay at another hotel (Hotel Majestic) for our post-cruise stay but was pleased with the Jazz that I cancelled my reservation at the Majestic. On the pre-cruise stay, we had a triple room on the 7th floor (Room 706) which consists of a large king bed and a fold-out sofa for the 3rd person. The swimming pool was on the 8th floor. We didn't notice any subway noise but heard noise from the street / traffic. The windows do not seem to do much to insulate the exterior sound. We live in a city and are therefore use to such sounds. On the post-cruise stay, we stayed in another triple which was located on the 6th Floor (Room 606). Of the 2 rooms, Room 606 was larger as it had a wall in between the king bed and the sofabed. Both rooms are on the southwest corner of the building so you had windows that opened up on two sides of the room. Air conditioning worked great - probably too well and it took some time to figure out how to adjust the temps. Don't know if it was because we were there longer, but we did hear the noise and the rumble of the subway in this room. Positives: Location, friendliness of the staff, the pool, usage of computer with internet access (front desk offered to print my boarding passes if I would only email it to them). Food ordered from the pool was fairly good and relatively inexpensive. 11 Euros for a large pizza and a liter of water. Negatives: Pool doesn't open until 10 a.m. and closes at 8 p.m. My wife would have liked to get in a morning or late night swim for exercise, but they lock the floor. Also, housekeeping didn't make our room until late in the afternoon (4 pm) even though we put out the sign for room clean up at 9 a.m. After a day of sightseeing, the last thing we want is to return to an unmade room or catch the housekeeper in the middle of her clean up. I think that she was concerned about cleaning up the rooms for guests who were departing so that the hotel could have them available for incoming guests instead of taking care of the other guests who were staying. It cost us 25 Euros for a taxi cab from the hotel to the airport at 5 a.m. (no traffic), but note the taxi adds another 2 Euros for each additional piece of luggage. We had previously booked a private car to pick us up from the airport to take us to the Hotel Jazz and that was $50 flat. If we did not anticipate that there was going to be little traffic at the time of the morning, we would probably book a private car as it would be cheaper and probably less stressful. The taxi driver spoke NO english whatsoever. If returning to Barcelona, we'd stay at this place again and would recommend it to anyone.

<Title>“Jazzy-Hotel in Mardi Gras-like town”
<Content>LOCATION: We took the bus from the airport to the nearby Placa de Catalunya for about 3 euros each. There are plenty of busses going to the Placa and they are easy to find, but don’t bother with their automated curb-side ticket machines. None of them worked when we were there, creating long lines of frustrated customers. You can simply buy your ticket from the bus driver upon entry. We took a taxi on our way back to the hotel instead of taking the bus (around 30 euros with all the fees) because we simply didn’t want to deal with dragging our suitcases through the mass of humanity at the Placa. Barcelona in August is crazy busy, like going to Mardi Gras in New Orleans. The hotel itself is clean, sleek and new, and just far enough from the Placa to provide a sense of refuge. The place used to be a bus station, making it an interesting and fun lay-out. The staff was helpful and gave us free maps. The University metro stop is right outside the hotel, and yes, you do hear the underground rumbling in your room which sounds like an elevator. I wore earplugs to counteract it and slept well. Frankly, the party girls in the hallways at all hours were a greater problem. ROOMS: We booked months ahead of time and got a lovely courtyard double room for only 105 euros, a great value for high season in Barcelona. Our beds were comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. Like others, we had issues with getting water all over the floor from the partially enclosed shower. My daughter had to blow-dry her hair in the bedroom because she was worried she’d electrocute herself standing in the puddles of water. There is a drain in the floor outside the shower but it doesn’t help much. We could have used more soaps, towels and tissue paper, but we got a nice supply of razors, toothbrushes, etc. BREAKFAST: We ate the 15 euro breakfast most days as it was too good, fast and convenient to pass up. You can also watch German MTV while you’re eating with all the international travelers and their families in the breakfast room. POOL: A happy place. You can order up food and lay in the sun while looking at the view (and the occasional topless sunbather). INTERNET: There are two Internet computers next to the bar, but the rooms themselves offer excellent free wireless. ROOM SERVICE: If you’re feeling overdone by all the Spanish ham and heavy meats, order up the vegetarian pizza. Delicious. OVERALL: This place is cool without trying too hard, a fun hotel with no snobbish airs, and an excellent value if you book ahead. Just be prepared for a party if it’s August.

<Title>“couldnt fault this in any respect”
<Content>Given the price we paid, this was the best value hotel I have ever stayed in. The reception staff were extremely helpful providing a range of information when requested. The rooms were excellent quality (very large beds) and the pool was fantastic. Its only small but thats all you need for an early morning dip or to cool off at the end of the day. The hotel itself is in a good location close to the main centre. If I ever went back to Barcelona this would be first place I would return to

<Title>“All that jazz and more!”
<Content>Hotel Jazz was absolutely perfect, situated only a minute away from the top of La Rambla (the main street). The great design was modern but not cold or hard and the rooms were just the right size. The location was great, ideal for the Aerobus from the airport which is only 4euros for a single trip and it drops you literally around the corner from the hotel. If you head down towards the port there is La Rambla and the Barri Gotic area - if you head up the street, its the main shopping district - all chic designer shops. There are loads of cafes around, and a few shops (Zara, Mango, even Topshop!) literally on the doorstep to the hotel. We didn't want to pay 14euros or whatever the price was for breakfast, I think that was the only down point - we couldn't find anywhere nice to have breakfast, so ended up having it at Starbucks! (There are at least 4 starbucks within 10 mins of the hotel!) And there is free internet access 24 hours in the bar area - the bar is again, great modern decor, but maybe a little pricey (but you get free crisps with your drinks!). The pool area was just great - most people seemed to go sightseeing during the best part of the day, then come back to the hotel around 3.30/4pm to chill out by the pool. We found if you get to the pool around 2.30/3ish you basically have the poolside to yourself, but if you go later around 4, you might struggle to find a sunbed. They also provide towels around the pool, but sometimes they run out later in the day. Its really clean, and the views are great! I think the only downside about the pool was there wasn't enough shade - the umbrellas they had (only about 3!) often couldn't go up because of the strong breeze. There is also the really loud bird sound over the tannoy every hour (which wakes you up if you're napping!) but it keeps the birds away - and it works! You can order food & drink from up there as well, the drinks were pricey (2euros for a coke) but the food was quite cheap. There were workmen working on the roof while we were there which was quite annoying but it was only for a couple of days. If you have a late flight, the check out time is a reasonable 12noon, and they are really good about letting you use their facilities, they have a lock up area for your bags, and you can use the pool & shower up by the pool for the rest of the afternoon. We ordered a taxi from the hotel back to the airport (having taken the Aerobus in) but they add a hotel surcharge for ordering you one - the taxi was pricey as well (nearly 40euros!!) but I think we got completely ripped off! The rooms and bathroom were a great size - and yes, you can hear the metro but its literally just like the rumble of a car going past - what can you expect in the middle of a city?! But otherwise the rooms were silent as can be and the air conditioning was heaven after coming in from sightseeing! The bathrooms were really clean and again, modern decor - felt like luxury! In terms of food - I would recommend you book a few nights ahead for restaurants or else you might end up waiting an hour for a table - even during the week. Also some of the restaurants I can recommend around Barcelona are: La Crema Canela - you HAVE to try this restaurant, its just off the Placa Reial - people were queuing to get into this posh restaurant on the square, but if you go around the corner this was so much better, its so cheap and absolutely beautiful interior and the food is so tasty! El Gran Cafe - situated in a back street in the Barri Gothic area, 1920s interior, a bit more pricey but fantastic food. NOTI Restaurant - If you are looking for a posh, luxury restaurant, I would come here - it was my boyfriends birthday so I wanted to take him somewhere special. It was a lovely atmosphere and the food was amazing! But anyway, I would REALLY recommend Hotel Jazz to anyone!

<Title>“Chic Hotel/Great Location”
<Content>I thought the rooms and location were great. Very modern, minimalist, muted style, which we enjoyed very much. Air Conditioning was wonderful. Pool was lovely. The only thing that I was not thrilled about was the staff. They don't really have a business office. And their printer wasn't working. So I had to use an internet cafe. The staff answered direct questions, but I thought they were not particularly friendly, and their recommendations were sometimes way off base. I asked about a gym, and they recommended a place literally miles away from the hotel. With not much effort, I found a great one 4 blocks away (Holmes Place). Another time I asked about having laundry done. Again, he recommended a place 15 minutes by foot, and the nearby tourist office recommended one which was blocks away!

<Content>Fantastic new hotel right in the middle of Barcelona's shopping and restaurant areas. Only 300m or so walk to the famous La Rambla and handy to the tourist bus networks. Spanking new and exceptionally stylish with a terrific rooftop pool. The only thing we missed was having coffee making facilities in the room, but not many in Europe do this. Large rooms and bathrooms. Helpful staff and free internet for guests.

<Title>“Hotel Jazz was fantastic”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Jazz in July '07 for 5 nights and loved it!! You really could not beat the location- less than a block from the Universitat metro stop, and a block the other direction from Placa Catalunya and another metro stop. Plus, the room was beautful, the hotel itself is very classy and as modern as they get, the staff was very friendly and helped us book several things, and the rooftop pool and view were excellent There were only a few minor, nitpicky concerns (that would never prevent us from returning, by the way)- the shower wasn't fully enclosed, and thus water sprayed all over the floor every time you showered, and the breakfast (in our package) was not included and WAY too expensive- 15 Euros. Also, the staff started cleaning trhe rooms too early in the morning- it could have just been our floor (6th), but if you stay there and plan to sleep later than about 9, make use of the "do not disturb" door sign. Overall, we had a fantastic experience and would certainly go back!

<Content>We loved this hotel. The rooms are quite small and we really noticed it because we had a cot but we spent no time in it so it didn't really matter. We didn't see any other children there but the staff were great with us and my son who was one at the time. Always helping us with buggy and finding him a nice seat for breakfast. The location is fantastic. Down a very safe road and just off the main touristy streets. Can't fault our stay. Brilliant!

The staff were friendly, the rooms were attractively decorated, spacious and clean and the roof top pool was a fabulous place to cool down after a days sight seeing. It is easy to get to, just a couple of minutes walk from the Universitat metro station, and is only a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona.

<Content>Booked Hotel Jazz following a number of very positive TA recommendations. Offers very good value for money. We paid 160 euro's per night and for this you get a top notch hotel room with huge bed, well equipped bathroom and separate shower, good toiletries etc decorated in chic up to date style. Reception as others commented are very helpful providing map and information. Location very convenient but far enough off the square to be reasonably quiet and close to underground. Pool is another bonus.

<Content>Have just returned from staying 3 nights in Barcelona with my girlfriend. The hotel itself & the room are superbly styled & spotless. Was impressed as soon as I walked through the doors. Girlfriend loved the bathroom, need I say more? Bed was massive & very comfortable. The pool on the roof is great & the sound levels due to the traffic outside were almost non existant on the 2nd floor. Ordered breakfast just one morning & it was excellent also & exactly on time. Perfect location for getting straight on the metro or bus routes. Excellent selection of bars/food etc, within 2 mins walk every direction! Really enjoyed staying here, and will definately be returning in the future again.

<Content>We arrived early at the hotel at midday, expecting to be able just to leave our luggage, but were met by charming desk staff who promptly checked us in upgrading us to a Junior Suite as it was the only room ready! The hotel was very smart and in a fantastic location. We were able to walk easily to many attractions. The suite was very nice, spacious and on 6th floor with great views -very little noise except on night of 23rd June which was a fiesta night and the fireworks were spectacular and went on all night! Would stay here again.

<Content>I've never written a review before, but I find tripadvisor so helpful, and LOVED this hotel that I had to share. I loved it so much that I'm writing the review 1 year after my stay. Great Location - close to everything yet quiet, Great service - they made a great recommendation for restaurants (named Pla) and my fiance had them organize flowers and champagne for a surprise and they were the most beautiful flowers I've ever received. A huge bouquet, I was so sad to leave them on our departure - and they were very affordable ($50 - $100 US). The decor was very chic and modern. We got a deal for $150 USD per night and it was well worth it. Will definitely stay there again.

<Content>I stayed here for 4 nights with my husband at the end of June. We booked after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor and we weren't disappointed. The rooms and public areas are spotless and the breakfast was ample and the choice was excellent. We were on the 6th floor and were aware of the metro running underneath so I suppose it could be quite noisy if you are on a lower floor. It certainly didn't bother us though. We did request a high floor however by E.Mailing the hotel about 3 days before we arrived. We would definately return to this hotel if we ever returned to Barcelona

<Content>Great, stylish hotel in a very central location. Staff were all very friendly and helpful - recommended a fab tapas bar around the corner (on Placa Universitat), Celler de Tapas, which I would highly recommend. Our room was on the 7th floor overlooking the Carrer de Pelais which was perfect as we could keep an eye on the busy street below, but didn't hear any of the noise (double glazing worked a treat) - room was modern, had icy cool aircon, very clean and bathroom not only had the usual shower gel and shampoo, but a disposable razor, comb and sponge! Pool on the roof a real bonus too especially after a long hot day of sight seeing and the views across Barcelona were awesome. We'd definitely stay there again and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.

<Title>“Just as promised”
<Content>My test of a hotel is the quality of sleep that I get. Jazz offers a good bed, good pillows and air conditioning that works and is so quiet that if it wasn't for the fact that the room got cooler you might think it was not working (which may be the reason that some people can hear or feel the Metro - in most NA hotels the AC fan is so loud that the Metro vibration would not be the thing that you would notice). Also, if you like outside air, the windows open (good only if you have an inner courtyard room due to street traffic). In summary I got a good nights rest every night. Add to that competent and friendly staff, designer rooms, a great location (close to the airport bus drop-off/a short 3 min walk to both La Ramblas and the not- so-touristy shopping and eating district to the northwest) and a roof top pool area that gives you a wonderful break after a day touring. I am sure there are negatives but none that I can think would be worth mentioning given the value. I'll stay there again..

<Title>“Good Hotel in a Great City”
<Content>Excellent hotel. We were on the 5th floor at the front overlooking Carrer de Pelai. We could just hear the metro – did not affect us, neither did traffic noise. Convenient for most places – easy walking distance to Ramblas. Front desk were very helpful. Many reviews have mentioned the price of breakfast – in our view it depends on what you want. If you just want a coffee and croissant then 14 euro is expensive – but the food on offer is excellent and there is a good variety on offer, including hot food. And you can stock up on fruit for the day. As advised by some reviewers we did try D’Or (across the street) but by the time we had coffee, juice and sandwiches it was not significantly cheaper than the hotel. There is a Sandwich bar in same block as hotel for a quick bite during the day. There is a Carrefour at the top of Ramblas for essentials. Would recommend getting the Aerobus from the airport – the hotel is just three stops on the route (near University). When you get off the bus the hotel is across the street and to the left (less than 5 minutes walk with cases). Go to the “El Raco” restaurant (leave the hotel, turn right and it is directly across the street) – the steak is how meat should taste -really excellent flavour.

<Title>“stylish barcelona hotel”
<Content>Barcelona was the last stop after a Mediterranean Cruise last summer and we were delighted to be checking into the Jazz. We were traveling with our two children ages 6 and 9 and we had some trouble booking online as it would not accept our reservation for 4 people. We ended up with a LARGE corner room/suite with a pull out sofa for the kiids. The airconditioning worked beautifully (it was HOT in July!!!!) and their was a plasma TV in the room. The room had a contemporary vibe and was new and felt more like a small apartment with a foyer. The kids loved the rooftop pool though it was very much a singles scene with a group of girls on a bachlorette trip. Other guests we met at the pool complained that their rooms were quite small so I think the key is to get the corner room/suite. You do feel a bit of a rumble (we Califonian's always think it's a quake) when the underground went by occasionally so I think the higher up of a room you can get the better but we didn't mind it much. One warning ~ some fellow cruise passengers checking into the Jazz (in the lobby) had their bags stolen right under their nose. In fact, they did not even miss them until they reviewed the hotels security footage and saw the theif lift them. The police told them that this is a very common theft in Barcelona and it was an easy get-away as the lobby was small. We LOVED Barcelona and can't wait to go back. We would definitely book into the Jazz and stay for longer next time.

FREE internet available to guests right next to the hotel bar. Large room size and modern bathroom. Altogether a really nice place to stay! We'd stay there again.

<Title>“Jazz a favourite”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz for 5 nights at the end of May, largely based on the reviews on this site. I found most hotels in Barcelona expensive (and unavailable) when I was booking in April, so don't regret the 160 euros excl VAT which we paid. We couldn't get a booking through the hotel website (it showed "unavailable") but managed to get a room through Venere.com. The first welcome surprise was that the Airport Bus stops in Plaza Universitat. Very convenient - you simply cross the square to Calle Pelai, walk a few metres, and you're at the hotel. The check in staff were amongst the top three hotels for friendliness and helpfulness in our entire 5 week trip in Spain. They were also very helpful when we wanted to organise a day trip to Montserrat. The Hotel Jazz is a brilliant location. The Metro stop at Universitat makes getting around the city very easy (buying a 10 trip ticket was perfect for 5 days), its a short walk to Las Ramblas or across to Passeig de Gracia. Across the road on Pelai is a great little cafe for breakfast - Viena - and there are lots of bars and restaurants around. The room was large, clean, in a contemporary design - just like the website. We were on the 6th floor and had no problems with noise. There is free internet access in the bar - two PCs there - which was very welcome to holiday makers who had determinedly left their laptops at home, but by this time were going through email withdrawal! Although it was still quite cool in Barcelona, the pool area was busy whenever we checked it out. Kids loved it, and the roof is a nice place to relax after a hard day sightseeing or walking the city. I have no hesitation in recommending the Jazz.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel”
<Content>What a great hotel!! I just got back from Barcelona a couple of weeks ago, and I fell in love with the city and Hotel Jazz. Hotel Jazz is in a great location. The staff were very friendly and accommodating. I really enjoyed the hotel's modern decor. My room was very large compared to most European rooms. The size reminded me of an American Hotel. My room was very clean as well. I would definitely stay here again and I'm recommending the hotel to all my friends. If you stay here, be sure to use the free internet computers on the 1st floor and check out the pool on the roof. The view is awesome.

<Title>“Get Your Jazz On!”
<Content>I had booked the Jazz based on other's reviews, and everyone's raves about this hotel were "spot on"! Front Desk staff is friendly, rooms are nice, and the hotel is located 2 blocks from the city centre. We asked for a room above the 4th floor, and barely noticed the subway rumble, and the glass in the windows silenced the street noise completely. We did our share of Tapas, but found a Cuban restaurant about 15 minutes walk between the hotel and the waterfront. I highly recommend this restaurant if you want to eat where the locals hang.. Can't remember the name, but maybe the front desk staff can help. I recommend doing a 2 day pass on the city bus tour. That way you can spread the two routes across a couple of days. It's the best way to get an overview of the entire city. Well run, and great views. We walked Las Ramblas, and found a wonderful pottery store a couple blocks off, that had great selection and price. There are four of these stores in Barcelona proper. Ate dinner one night at the Seven Ports. The paella was good, but I've had better. Still neat to eat in such a historic landmark. They serve four types of olive oil w/ bread, and one of them was the best I've ever had. Internet access was good, and priced reasonably. The room was clean, and set up efficiently. Larger than standard European rooms. I recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona, that wants to be near the heart of the city.

<Title>“Loved it!”
<Content>I stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend to celebrate our 3 year anniversary in Barcelona and the hotel exceeded out expectations. Having heard that city centre hotels are not as clean as those on the outskirts, I was a bit wary but I needn't have worried! The staff are friendly and helpful. Check-in was swift and hassle-free. It literally took us 5 minutes to check-in. Maid service was excellent. The hotel is spotlessly clean with modern decor and I have no complaints at all about the room or en suite. My only 'whinges' (which is an overstatement) are: (1) The pool is on the small side and rather shallow. (2) The rumbling noise which the lift makes - this may not be heard from other rooms situated away from the lift. All in all, our stay here was extremely pleasant and the location is excellent too - about 1-2 minute walk to Placa de Catalunya and the same to La Rambla. I would recommend restaurants in the Barri Gotic and the squares just off La Rambla also. Look out for Les Quinze Nits (found in a large square off La Rambla) - cheap and yummy food. We were particularly curious when we saw a huge queue of people stretching across the square! La Taller de Tapas is fantastic for tapas with lots of coverage in newspaper articles. You can take the Aerobus from La Placa de Catalunya to and from the airport costing 4 euros max which takes about 40 minutes but the queues can be long. If you take the taxi option, it will set you back around 20-30 euros depending on how much luggage you have. I would also recommend going on the Bus Turistic to do your tourist sight-seeing. Enjoy!

<Title>“JUST GREAT!”
<Content>My husnand and I visited Barcelona for the first time last week. We enjoyed our 3 nights stay in hotel JAZZ very much! The whole hotel is very clean and spacious. Great design! Modern and friendly. Our room and bathroom was very comfortable and convinient. Breakfast buffet has a full range of delicious food and drinks. Staff is polite and overall friendly. The hotel is situated very central in the city. Ideal for discovering the main attractions of this joyfull city, also because of the availability of an underground railway in the neighbourhood. Next time we will definetly stay in hotel JAZZ again! EXCELLENT! Thea

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel and city”
<Content>My partner and I stayed in the hotel Jazz in May for 4 nights and could not fault it at all. Ideal location, only 5 mins walk to Las Ramblas, shopping area, Gothic area. 2 mins to nearest Metro stop. The rooms were modern and spacious, great bathroom, satelite t.v. mini bar which wasn't too over priced, comfy beds and very clean. room service is very good and reasonably priced. We had breakfast in bed on 2 of the mornings at no extra cost which is a great service. Free wi-fi plus ethernet conections in all rooms as well as 2 free to use pc's in the bar area. hotel staff very freindly and helpfull. would recomend this hotel to any age group, business or pleasure. The pool on the roof is a nice addition although only used it once, the water was a bit too cold in May but nice place to unwind and catch some sun after a days sight seeing. Barcelona is probably the best city i have been to and i am quite well traveled, it is a very lively place with lots to see and do but laid back at the same time. A must is the open top tourist bus service, 19 euros for 1 day or 23euros for 2 days, there are 3 different routes which stop at all the main tourist sites and you can get on and off as many times as you want, there is a bus every 5 mins or so, it is an ideal way to see the city without missing lots of it by using the underground system (which is very good) and a lot cheaper than getting taxis everywhere. A must is a visit to the sagrada familia, which is absolutly out of this world. We will be staying at the hotel Jazz again no doubt about it.

<Title>“Great hotel at a great location”
<Content>We booked the Hotel Jazz through recommendations using this website. And everyone where right, this is a great hotel with very helpful staff. They helped us booking restaurants, taxi etc. The rooms where modern and always spotless cleaned. The breakfast was great but a little expensive. Because we where 11 people with 3 children we ate there for the convenience. It was very nice to lie down on a bed at the roof terrace after a long day walking around in the streets. If I come back to barcelona, I will definitely stay at the Jazz again.

<Title>“Great little hotel”
<Content>We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights following a short cruise which ended in barcelona. The hotel was easy to find, maybe 5 mins walk from the top end of the Ramblas. The hotel is very modern and fairly minimalistic in decor. The staff were English speaking and friendly. Although we arrived at 9.30am, they had a room for us by 10am. The room was spacious, good king size bed and blackout curtains. There is a great (small) pool on the roof terrace with views around barcelona and it was empty on the first day. By the second day the pool area was busy, but there were still seats/loungers. We got a late checkout no problem. We didnt try the room service/bar, but the maid service was accomodating with the time the room was made up. I would highly recommend this hotel. Despite being a 3*, it has all we typically find in a 4*.

<Title>“Clean, Comfortable and Central, but something missing”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz last week, and cannot fault the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms. Also enjoyed the room service pizza, which was delivered promptly. However we did feel that this hotel was slightly soulless, and a few extra touches might go a long way towards making guests feel more welcome. For example a complimentary bottle of water on arrival would I feel be appreciated by many guests who had endured a long journey. We have received (and now come to expect this) in many hotels of a lower rating, and these extra touches really do make a difference. We also found the general ambiance in the public areas around reception bit too stark and unwelcoming.

<Title>“great”
<Content>Great Hotel, better than many 4 star european hotels. Housekeeping do a great job, rooms were spotless, we had a triple room on the 7th floor with four mini balconies, very nice, spacious, bathrooms are very niceand modern, vast array of complimentary toiletries. Bar is nice but closes around12 or 1am. Breakfast is not that cheap at 14 euro but very good, well worth it. Room service pizza was great and very hot when it arrived. Location is superb. Not actually related to the hotel but the three restaurants we visited were les 4 Gats, The Attic and les Quinze Nits, Les 4 gats was really cool place, very atmospheric and good food at reasonable prices, The Attic was awful!! Service and the incredibly rude restaurant manager were mostly to blame but the food was also well below par, I have read many good reviews of it But I can only begin to explain how bad it was, we were a group of 17 and had booked for 10pm many months in advance, when we arrived at 10pm we were told our table was not ready and we had to wait outside for 20mins when we sat down at 10.20 we asked if we could order a drink, the drink finally arrived at 10.50pm when they also finally took our food order. one of our party's main course never arrived and they had to come back out and take her order again after most people were finished, then her meal came out while everyone was reading the desert menu. Our deserts arrived at 20 to 1am. Through all of this not once did anyone even apologise. Les Quinze Nits- Fantastic! Well worth queuing for. We joined the queue at 7.50pm Sunday night and there was about 50 people ahead of us but by 8.30 there must have been almost 1000 people in the queue. Very cheap, very good, very fast, very pleasant!

<Title>“quiet and subdued hotel in good location”
<Content>Spotless but characterless hotel in good location near the metro and open top bus stops. Hotel itself was very quiet but there was alot of road noise at night if the windows were open (we were on the 7th floor). The hotel is situated between two main roads.There were no coffee or tea making facilities in the rooms and we couldn't get any from room service in the mornings as it doesn't open until 1pm! The bar was very quiet and shuts early (midnight). I didn't go to the pool as there is so much to see in the city I didn't have time. I think the hotel is over priced considering the lack of facilities (£140 per night for a twin roon - no breakfast) but I have been told that Barcelona is pricey. Barcelona is an amazing place to visit and I will definately return (you don't have time in a long weekend to see everything) but I will not return to this hotel.

<Title>“can't go wrong!”
<Content>can't say enough about this hotel. booked through british airways and got a good deal with an unbeliveable full breakfast included. was concerned about the coffee as a few people mentioned the coffee was not up to par. as a starbucks fan, i found the cafe con leche delicious and a great way to start the day. we,( my husband and i, both 50) consider ourselves somewhat hip and very well traveled. as architects, we found the jazz to be just what we were looking for. a small, clean, beautifully designed and furnished hotel. location was perfect., right off the ramblas. we walked everywhere, yet if you are not up to it public transportation is a stone's throw away. room was spacious. great comfortable king size bed. tv with cnn news. staff was helpful and courteous. rooftop deck and pool were a nice retreat in the late afternoon. barcelona is an incredible city and if you are thinking about the jazz, you can't go wrong!

<Title>“So quiet”
<Content>Spent four nights here and thoroughly enjoyed it. The hotel was immaculate throughout and the staff were very helpful.The room we had was tastefully decorated as were all the public areas. As some have pointed out breakfast was quite expensive but I would have to say,worth every cent. We decided to try it out on our first morning and then go somewhere outside for the next three days which would be less expensive.In the end we had breakfast in the hotel every day. There was a good choice of food which was well presented and plentiful. What really amazed me was the fact that the hotel is very well located ( near la Rambla, Placa de Catalunya Passeig de Gracia etc) but always very peaceful. No stag/hen parties to disturb you at some ungodly hour. There was very little street noise. We were on the 2nd floor and could hear a not to loud noise from the underground but it did not cause us any problem. Anyone wanting a very good restful hotel in the centre of Barcelona need look no further than the Jazz

<Title>“Great Location, No Real Issues”
<Content>Stayed over Easter weekend. We arrived early (U.S. redeye flight) but did not have to wait long for the room. No issues with noise at all. Staff were friendly but a bit harried; their English was fine. Initially our room had some electrical problems (TV and several outlets didn't work -- blown fuse?), but the staff fixed it promptly. The biggest headache was with the wi-fi service. We were on the highest floor and in the corner of the building, so our connection simply never functioned properly. The room had an Ethernet jack, however, so we settled for that. The restaurant is basically irrelevant -- opt for eating out.

<Title>“Great Stay At The Jazz”
<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Jazz from 15th December - 18 December 2006, and picked the hotel because of the reviews on tripadvisor, from the minute we got there to the minute we left, the hotel was brilliant. The Rooms and immaculate, Modern and clean with a nice flat screen LCD T.V, mini bar was surprisingly priced and bathroom and shower were quality. We had Tickets for Espanyol V Real Madrid, and the first thing we did when we checked in was to find out what was the best way to get to the Olympic Stadium, The guy on the front desk was very friendley and advised us well. The Hotel is across the road from a bar called D'or, Go in!!!, amazingly cheap and pint glasses the size of houses!!, we ate dinner there once and the food was quality too!!, at some point over our 3 night stay we ended up in the there for a night cap!!! Only place in Barcelona to stay!!

<Content>Very nice hotel, modern (thus, don't stay here if you are looking for an extremely Spanish or Catalunyan hotel). Very confortable room with free internet access, minibar, safe, good lighting, modern bathroom. Very quiet on fifth floor (can't comment about the lower floors). Staff spoke English well and were friendly and helpful. Didn't eat in the hotel or use the bar (not sure why you would conisdering the fabulous location and hundreds of eateries within minutes out the front door. 5 minute walk or less to Las Ramblas. 5-10 minute walk to the fabulous neighborhoods of Barri Gotic, El Born, L Eixample, and El Raval. Metro station (Universistat) literally at the front door of the hotel. This provides access to all the other parts of the city. The neighborhood around the hotel is clean, appeared fairly upscale and felt safe (certainly in comparison to Barri Gotic and El Born, which had some scary areas particularly at night). I would definitely stay here again, particularly for the accomodations and the great location ("the best location in Barcelona" according to a native Barcelonian friend).

<Content>This hotel is in a great location, close to walk to most areas. The sound from the streets was never a problem. We were on the 4th floor and had no noise complaints, The staff were great and very accomodating with any requests. The pool looked nice but the weather was not warm enough to really enjoy it. The breakfast is overpriced for the selection but there are many other choices within walking distance. I would recommend it for anyone heading to Bareclona.

<Title>“Good option in Barcelona”
<Content>This is a good hotel option in Barcelona. Property generally: Overall, while the design elements are very well carried out, this does feel primarily like a business hotel, and offers no particular Spanish, Catalanian, or even particularly European character per se. It is, however, very modern and has comfortable, clean, fashionable public spaces. Rooms: Well sized, good amenities, well kept, clean and very stylish. Good for either a holiday or a business trip. The windows are well insulated, so even overlooking the busy street, the rooms remain quiet, though hallway noise does come through the door. Location: Excellent. The property is an easy walk to Passeig de Gracia, La Ramblas, and even the beach is not a difficult hike. Oddly, there was no city map provided in the hotel, though I didn't ask the concierge who I assume would have had one available. Service: Every staff member I came into contact with was helpful and generally friendly, and were able to speak with me in English and French. The only warning to people generally about Barcelona is that the shopping is incredibly good - perhaps amongst the best shopping cities in the world - so beware the smoking credit card!

<Title>“Ideal for long weekend”
<Content>Great location, modern, clean and comfortable accommodation. Throroughly recommended. Staff were very helpful and and efficient. The buffet breakfast, while a bit pricey at 14 euros, has plenty to choose from and was a good start to the day. The pool was waterless when we visited which was a shame - the weather was hot enough for a swim even in mid-March. The hotel is close to Placa de Catalunya, meaning you can walk to many sights such as Gaudi's Casa Batllo, stroll down Las Ramblas or wander the myriad of narrow streets in Barri Gotic. The Placa is also a useful transport hub for buses and the metro to places farther afield. The "Bus Turistic" may seem a bit tacky, but it is good value and links many of the key sights with frequent open-topped buses. Some reviews mention the rumble fron the metro. We had rooms on the fourth floor but, while just discernable if you're listenng out for it, it never disturbed sleep or any other part of our stay. Our room faced the inner courtyard, so was cool and quiet.

<Content>Stopped here after reading reviews Hotel Jazz is in a good location, a few minutes stroll to Plaza Catalunya at the top of the Ramblas Room was comfortable Double , bed and pillows gave comfy sleep. Decor had minimalist feel with brown and red tones, room had free safe and mini bar. - Safe proved handy as I met at least 2 people who had been mugged on Ramblas late at night Positives - Good Location . pleasant reception staff and good standard clean rooms My negatives - after a lively night out, cleaners have an early start and the wood flooring in corridors and rooms will give you a early morning wake up Breakfast - at 14.98 euro's including tax - poor quality - do yourself a favour and eat out Top Tip Taxi's - If you get a taxi from hotel expect to add on 10 euro's to your fare, stroll 10 yards to the street corner and save yourself some money Taxi from airport 20 euro's - hotel booked taxi back to airport 29 euros

<Title>“Great Hotel in an awesome city”
<Content>Booked hotel jazz after reading great reviews on trip advisor and overall I was nowhere near being disappointed. We arrived on the Friday afternoon and got the aerobus from the airport (3.90 euros, compared to the taxi's 20), hotel became quite hard to find as the map I'd got off of the internet wasn't too accurate, I'd advise a detailed map to get you there, as you may miss it's side street entrance. No hot water on first night which was very annoying but this turned out to be the only negative of the trip. Rooms are very clean, very stylish, have great facilities and for the price are unbeatable. The location is fantastic with a nearby metro station only 50m away and La Rambla a mear 150m. The Hotel provided a great centre point for a fantastic sightseeing holiday. The pool was empty as it was out of season, so be warned if your looking forward to a relaxing swim on the rooftops. I wouldn't recommend the breakfast as it is 14 euros and I'v never eaten a breakfast that was worth that much, especially when there are so many cafes and patisseries nearby as well as a starbucks only 100m away. OVERALL - hotel jazz was in a brilliant location with friendly and helpful staff, great facilties, extremely clean, and I would happily stay there again and reccommend it to anyone.

<Title>“OK overall”
<Content>Comfortable - but if this is the third best of some 400 hotels in Barcelona, then that is a little worrying! Good location, close to most attractions, although it must be said the tourist heart of Barca has shifted in recent years to Born and towards the waterfront which is a good 15-20 mins walk away. Rooms are comfortable and reasonable condition, but they are small. Not much space to even walk around the bed! Pool area on the roof is pleasant, but when we went the pool was empty, and had been for some months! When I asked why this was not made clear on the website, the lady was totally disinterested. Only other bug-bear , was that the maid began clattering around on the wood floors in the hallway every morning before 8am which kind of defeated the purpose of seeking out a hotel in a quiet location!

<Title>“GREAT place to stay!”
<Content>Stayed at the Jazz for 3 nights and had a wonderful time. The rooms are clean, the bed is comfortable and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The bathroom is clean and modern and although the 1/2 shower door will put water on the floor, a few towels easily remedy the problem. The location is nearly perfect if you want to be close to all the best that Barcelona has to offer. You're just minutes from Las Ramblas and can easily walk to some of Gaudi's architectural marvels. Skip breakfast at the Jazz and find a lovely cafe with a view of the people walking by... there are so many to choose. We highly recommend dinner at Taller De Tapas. Overall, a lovely stay and a lovely hotel. If you want luxury, stay someplace else. If you want clean, simple, modern and a great value... the Hotel Jazz is a sure bet.

<Title>“Great location, staff--some improvements needed”
<Content>I can't totally concur with all the glowing glowing reviews of the Jazz. I thought that the rooms were looking more than a bit shopworn. This is my main complaint. The printed informational materials in the room were stained and dog eared; even the complimentary stationery could not have been used. The wallpaper is beginning to curl and the bedspread was snagged and possibly not as clean as one would hope. Chairs worn and needing replacement for a room at these prices. The first room I was given was more unpleasant than that--but a change of room was quickly and cordially accomplished. Rooms are quiet with the window shut. Lighting is good, with a lot of different lighting options. (Note that you have to insert your room key in a slot to the left when you open the door in order to get any of the lights to turn on.) Maybe I'm too old school to appreciate the total starkness of the modern decor, but I think it could use a contrasting color (light aqua?) to break up the almost gloomily pervasive dark brown. Given the difficulty of finding email access, though, the free internet was a great plus. BUT my main compliment is to the reception staff, like Jose and Alex, who are just super. Very professional, personable and real problem solvers. There seemed to be a lot of genuinely nice and helpful people working in Barcelona's tourism industry but these folks go beyond the average. I would recommend asking for a room on the Pelai side of the building. A little less noise and great people watching as the night wears on. This hotel is pretty much in the heart of the party, shop, eat and drink center of Barcelona and walking out the front door to all of that is a real convenience for those who want to be in the midst of it all. Within a block in any direction I didn't see many eating establishments that were instantly appealing, though a few blocks away up Rambla de Catalunya, there were several.

<Title>“Loved the Jazz”
<Content>My Sister and I had a fabulous stay at the Jazz at the end of January this year. The hotel had a perfect location, on a fairly quiet street but within a few minutes walk of the famous Las Ramblas. The hotel was right next to public transport links, and lots of great shopping opportunities. The rooms were well appointed and spotlessly clean, a little on the small side but considering the price of central Barcelona hotels it was an absolute bargain! I'd recommend a city tour to get an overview of the city, and a trip to Gaudi's Casa Battilia a must; the highlight for me though was wandering around the gothic quarter, it was a pleasure getting lost there, and we found an incredible, tourist free, pinchos bar just down the road from the picasso museum. It was buzzing by around 11pm on a friday night. If you're looking for a great hotel in a wonderful city look no further than the Jazz!

<Title>“Pretty Perfect”
<Content>We couldn't have asked for a better base. The Hotel Jazz is stylish, comfortable and in a perfect location allowing you to explore a lot of Barcelona by foot. And to see all the main sights, the metro is only a stone's throw. The staff were extremely helpful and let us check in 4 hours early. Room service was very efficient with a good menu when in the mood for munchies. Our room was brilliant. Being on the corner, we had a large L-shaped balcony overlooking the busy Les Ramblas. It was great to overlook the hustle and bustle. Despite being in the heart of Barcelona, it was by no means noisy. We had a queen size bed and a large lounge area with 2 out of 4 walls being mainly windows/ balcony doors. The roof of the hotel is fantastic. Covered in wooden decking, the roof has a swimming pool (which was out of order but we didn't mind as it was late November!), with good quality loungers. Sat up high amongst the other Barcelona buildings, you overlook the city, and on a sunny day, it's like a little suntrap with no one overlooking you. It's so refreshing to have stayed at a very stylish, very well designed hotel without having had to pay through the nose for it. We'll be coming back to the Jazz again for sure.

<Title>“Very good mid-range central hotel”
<Content>The Jazz is very convenient for all the attractions and handy for the Tourist buses that go from Plaza catalonia, 300 meters away. The rooms are very clean and well appointed, with free internet for sad people. Breakfast is not worth the money and the coffee is awful. Room service however makes good coffee and free biscuits. Tip - take the blue and red tourist buses for 23 euros for two days. You will save at least 23 euros in discounts to the attractions.

<Title>“Modern, clean and helpful!”
<Content>Would fully recommend this hotel. I would like to thank those who wrote reviews on this as I booked this based on reviews I had read. The location was excellent, just off Las Ramblas down a side street. It is 5 mins walk from where you get the Bus Touristic and from El Court Englais where you can spend hours upon hours gazing at the beautiful merchandise and prices! The staff were most helpful at this hotel, providing us with a free map and booklet upon arrival and also directing us to places we wanted to visit. We stayed on floor 4, the room was clean, comfortable and well designed for our needs. Even in the bathroom the wee complimentaries you get were fab - razor, tissues, toothbrush, toothpaste, sponge etc. The only thing and this is only a small minor thing, we could hear the lift going up and down as it was only across the corridor but this was only minor. Breakfast was good - the fruit was gorgeous with a good choice of fresh fruit juice. The hot breakfast was not that good, best avoided. Barcelona itself is a delightful city with lots of shopping and sightseeing. The port itself was disappointing, highly commercialised with people pestering us to eat in their restaurants. The Gothic Quarter is a must, wee streets with unusual arty shops and of course, a cathedral

<Title>“Perfect Hotel. Perfect Location”
<Content>Spent 5 fabulous nights here in September 2006, which was very hot! Pool is a big plus, small, but perfect for hot afternoons when you've had enough sightseeing. Always a supply of towels and kept very clean and tidy. Rooms and bathrooms were very modern, lcd tv, great shower! The best thing about this hotel is the location. Metro station is just steps away and from here you can reach all of the sights with ease. Airport bus stop is about 5 min walk away. Las Ramblas is just at the end of the street and a vast array of restaurants and shopping is very close by. Would recommend "Quinz Nits" just of Las Ramblas, queue forms quickly, so get there early. Great food and a really great price. Looking for a great hotel in a great location, look no further!!!

<Title>“Perfect location”
<Content>Stayed here 16 and 17 February. Lovely staff. Lovely rooms. Lovely shower. Not at all noisy considering that so many reviews of hotels in Barcelona complain of this. Also very safe area. It is a 2 minute walk to Placa de Catlunya - where the metro will bring you to any tourist site you'll want to see!! It is in the middle between Las Ramblas and Passeig de Gracia - 2 of the main streets. If you're getting in from Girona airport on the bus it is just a quick cab ride away - or if you're getting in during running hours a few stops on the Metro. Would definitely recommend this place.

<Title>“Perfect location for wandering.”
<Content>Just returned from a trip to Spain and Italy and stayed at Hotel Jazz from December 27-30, 2006. I chose this hotel based on tripadvisor reviews and have to agree with the masses. This is a great hotel. Our priority as a couple in our late-twenties with no children was location. This is the perfect location: within sight of Las Ramblas but removed enough to be quiet. So much to do, see...very safe and comfortable. A couple of weird things...there is only a half shower door, so that's kind of difficult to manuever. Also, and apparently this is a European hotel thing I don't remember from my previous trips, but there are NO CLOCKS in the rooms! So, if your cell phone isn't going to work (as ours didn't) make sure you have a watch. The only real downfall is that it is not soundproofed from within the hotel. We could hear people in the hall talk as if there was no door between us. We recommend!

<Content>Can't beat the Hotel Jazz for location! Just a few minutes walk to almost anywhere you want to be. The rooms are very clean and comfortable - shockingly quiet given activity on the streets below. Like others mentioned, I would have liked a shower curtain to keep the water contained but not that big of an issue. Only issue we had was temp of the room: It was pretty warm and we couldn't get the air to kick in... meant we had to open the balcony door and hear all of the noise below...Small consequence for great place!

<Title>“So great!”
<Content>After much research we chose Hotel Jazz. The location provides easy cab drop off and pick up and is within wallking of all the "must see" sights. The rooms are modern and quiet, the beds are very comfortable ( I am VERY picky about beds), shower a little wet with no curtain. The staff service was exceptional, all speak English. Jose is a gem. Skip eating and/or drinking there, you have so many other options right out the entrance. Highly reccommended, you will not be disappointed-we travel a lot and this hotel was so great! Try Cencsentits for amazing dinner and say hello to Rose and Amelia, wonderful people. Also paella at the Seven Ports restaurant, yum.

<Title>“Best beds in the world!”
<Content>After a long day trekking around Barcelona it was a joy to get back to the Hotel Jazz and fall into bed. Not only are the beds the best ever but the pillows fall into the same category! Modern hotel in a good spot at the top of Las Ramblas-ideal to look around the shops at night, explore the gothic quarter and then find somewhere to eat amongst the many restaurants available. The 1898, same group, on Las Ramblas is also good. The Pittari down near the Colombus statue and Quo Vadis near the back of the theatre off Las Ramblas were two really good ones. Don't get there much before 10pm though. Nono close to the blue Gaudi extravaganza is great for a long Sunday lunch, the staff are knowledgeable and interested in their food. Tapa tapa just across the road was the best tapas we have had, and we have lived in Spain for almost 3 years! Just don't plan to eat later as you will be too full. Both Gaudi apartments are worth doing the tour of, just stunning. Make another trip there at night to really appreciate the architecture and detail. If you like those then make sure that you don't miss the music palace behind the old cathedral in the gothic quarter. A visual feast! At the moment the Xmas Markets are in the old cathedral square, not anywhere near as good as the ones in Manchester or the German ones, seems to be mostly figures for nativity scenes.

<Content>Recently stayed for four nights at the Hotel Jazz after reading Trip Advisor reviews. It is very centrally located and only a five min walk to the airport bus.Had little or no contact with the staff but what litle we had.... was fine.Checked in and out with ease. Rooms were clean and modern.We stayed on the 6th floor but could still hear on occasions the Metro.Was not a problem but wondered if it would be if we stayed on a lower floor.Anyway that is only nit picking.....would have no hesitation in recommending the Jazz to any fellow travellers.Coming from Ireland where the build up to Christmas was in full swing I was struck by the lack of even a modest tastefull tree in the lobby but hey we do tend to over do it in our neck of the woods:-)

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel Jazz”
<Content>First time in Barcelona for 3 nights away with my sister for sightseeing, shopping and eating/drinking!! The Hotel Jazz is a perfect place to stay - in fact I couldnt fault it in any way!! I have staying in many 5 star hotels, including the Bellagio in Las Vegas just a couple of months ago, and the Hotel Jazz was of equal standards and comfort. The staff are efficient but also friendly and speak good English. Upon arrival we took the blue Aerobus from outside the airport terminal and got off at the Placa de Cataluyna (cost 3.75 euros each) - the hotel is a quick 5 minute walk away down the Pelei but the entrance is just off the main street (we walked past it without realising at first). Although we arrived at 1030, we were able to get into our room immediately. Our room was on the 5th floor and only felt slight rumble from the underground which wasnt a problem. The windows must be triple glazed because we didnt hear any traffic noise when they were closed. Just a couple of tips in relation to eating out ; the hotel charges 14 euro each for breakfast if not included in your package - we visited a local bakery a couple of blocks away for our breakfast which cost 7 euros for both of us and a small supermarket which is in the straight that runs next to the Cafe D'Or. Previously people on tripadvisor recommended Cafe D'Or for breakfast and dinner - we ate tapas there and it was cold and quite horrible so really disppointed, but the staff were friendly enough. The main restaurant you must visit is Les Quinze Nits in Reial Square ( about half way down Las Ramblas on the left hand side) for quality and very reasonably priced food - it opens for dinner at 2030 and when we arrived at 2020 there was a huge queue of about 100 people!! - we didnt think we would get in but did - we sat outside which was a bit nippy but kept our jackets on. Although I had kept hold of my bag with the tightest of grips for the entire trip I lost my concentration momentarily and hung my bag on the back of my chair. I was promptly spoken to by the security chap at the restaurant to hide my bag away which I did. We also ate at the Hard Rock Cafe for a non-Spanish meal and it had a great atmosphere and good food. For great views of the city, take the smallest lift in the world !!! up the Columbus tower which is located at the bottom of Las Ramblas - however, warning its not for those who are claustrophic or dislike heights. For tours round the city we took the orange Barcelona Tours bus - they arent marketed as much as the other bus company but they are better as you get headphones for the tour which you can select for your language - instead of hearing the same thing being said 5 times over in different languages!! - it took us to all the main sights and we could get off and on as much as we wished. We were really aware of our bags so thankfully didnt get anything stolen, but there is quite a strong presence of police in the Las Ramblas area. We loved Barcelona and will definately be returning! One thing you must take with you is a phrase book and try the language (Catalan or Spanish) as some places do not speak English.

<Title>“Barcelona central”
<Content>The Hotel Jazz was great, very clean with helpful staff. It is in a wonderful position some 300 metres from the Place De Catalunya at the top of Las Ramblas. Also perfect for catching the Airbus from the airport which drops off at Place de Catalunya. Bedrooms were big enough not to feel cramped with plenty of storage space and well equipped bathrooms. Breakfast is pricey if not included in deal but worth it if you can get it included as there was lots of it and a good variety of food available. The rooms are double glazed and most traffic noise does not reach the occupants but it was noisy on Friday and Saturday night when bars below were in full swing. The metro underneath the hotel can be felt as a rumble at times but it in no way disturbed us. Tea and coffee in the bedrooms would also have been desirable but you can't have everything at these prices. I would recommend the hotel but be aware that the area is busy and noisy at the weekend. We stayed on the second floor near the street so it may have been quieter on higher floors.

<Title>“The best 3 Star Hotel I've ever stayed”
<Content>We stayed for 3 nights from 19th November 2006, in a twin/double (two semi-double beds adjoined together) room for EUR 444 incl. tax, booked directly from the hotel website. Our room was on the 6th floor with great view, bright & airly, quiet, spotlessly clean... We were very impressed by the design of the room - obviously refurbished recently, contemporary with laminated floor, plenty of lighting options. Very nice size. All the amenities you can think of... electric safe, built-in radio that also plays in the bathroom - lovely to listen to some music while having a bath. It would have been nice had there been a hot drink facility in the room (e.g. coffee machine), but I don't suppose you find it in many hotels in Europe... Large window opens widely, ventilation & air conditioner are also perfect. Bathroom is also beautiful & in nice size, with bidet, heated towel rail. As well as shampoo & shower gel, toothbrush set, shaving razer + cream, shoe cleaner, comb, shower cap, sewing set, disposable washing sponge. When we checked in, toilet was sealed with a sticker to ensure hygiene standards. Free access to swimming pool. Receptionists are friendly + very polite. 2 lifts/elevators work very well. We didn't actually use the bar/care on the first floor. But there is a cafe opposite the hotel who opens at 7:30am and serves continental breakfast as well as English-style big breakfast for reasonable prices. Great location - less than a minute walk from Universitat Metro station, a few minutes walk to Placa de Espanya / La Rambla. I'm usually quite fussy about the hotel I stay, but this one I just can't complain! I would definitely choose Hotel Jazz again.

Pool area is great for relaxing after a busy day. Only drawback is the lack of a restaurant. Breakfast is served or there are Starbucks and many restaurants in the area. This hotel is well worth the money. 150 euro per night.

<Content>Thanks to the good reviews here we booked the Jazz and were not disappointed. The hotel is very clean and comfortable and had a lovely spread for breakfast. Just one caveat was that in our room on the third floor we could hear the trains underneath! However it did not spoil our enjoyment. It also has a nice pool on the roof which we would have used in the summer. Barcelona is well worth a visit and I would recommend using the airport bus to the central square five minutes from the hotel.

<Title>“Top Notch & Trendy”
<Content>This was the best hotel of our recent trip to Spain. Nice new features and great design throughout. Hotel is located about 3 blocks from the top of La Rambla (Las Ramblas) and Plaza Catalunya and 1 block from Plaza Universtat. Close to 2 metro stations; and just off the SE corner of one of the gay districts. It is surrounded by 1-way streets and therefore tricky to get to by car. There is a garage under the hotel with adequate parking (for 22eu per day). Reception/concierge is efficient and staff speaks fluent English. Room 717, at end of hall on top floor faces a U-shaped courtyard; therefore it is fairly quiet. Nonetheless, noisy guests talking loudly in the corridor was a problem since there is no interior door. Room is spacious and well-designed with adequate closet space, drawers, surfaces, a safe. Bathroom is chic, but could be more user-friendly – sink faucets work strangely, hard to adjust water temperature in shower. A/C is wonderful, works very effectively and is very quiet and responsive. It was worth figuring out the control panel, which is not explained anywhere in the room – but the concierge immediately pinpointed the problem with a phone call. . Very good internet once you get past the wireless and go for the wired option and get your laptop set up for that. Front desk was responsive in dealing with the internet issue while insisting that the free wireless option worked well throughout the hotel (except anywhere in Room 717). As an alternative they offered the wired internet (also free), which worked fine after going through some DNS-server set-ups different than standard default. Buffet breakfast @ 14.00eu per person is plentiful – fresh fruit & melon, hot eggs & meats, cold meats & cheeses, bread & pastries, cereal & dried fruits, juices. No soy milk. Weaker coffee than elsewhere in Spain.

<Title>“Fantastic hotel!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Jazz Monday 10/16 through Wednesday 10/18/2006. The location was great, just a few blocks from Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya, with two Metro stops close by. The staff was very friendly--at checkout one of the clerks printed out driving directions to Montserrat for us. The rooms are spotless, and include room safe, minibar, and free internet access. We had a suite, which also gives you a balcony overlooking the street. The modernist decor is colorful and comfortable. A spectacular experience, highly recommended.

<Title>“Loved it”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz hotel for 3 nights at the start of October. The staff were very friendly and all spoke excellent English. We were staying with our 1 year old and they couldn't have been more helpful. We had a lovely big room, beautifully decorated. The pool was a really lovely place to relax by at the end of the day. The hotel is also excellently positioned just by the top of La Rambla. We had a fantastic time and I would recommend it to anyone.

<Title>“Loved the Jazz Hotel!”
<Content>We booked the Jazz hotel by chance and I am soooo glad that we did!! The hotel is very new and modern and the rates were surprisingly reasonable. Rooms were large with wooden floors and flat screen tv and the bathroom was very cool with a black and white theme. Best of all though was the swimming pool on the roof, it was perfect for cooling down after a day of sightseeing! The location was great too, right next to the Ramblas. If I go back to Barcelona (and I'm sure I will) then I will definitely be staying at the Jazz Hotel again.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>Hotel Jazz is in a great, busy location but is set back and as such we did not have any undue noise. Some rumbling from the underground. Excellent for exploring all areas on foot or to catch the city tour bus. Roof top pool area is small but really nice and the free internet access in the bar was great. Ramblas is not so great and we felt a bit tacky. Areas up toward the Gaudi Cathedral is much nicer. Arola restaurant at Hotel Arts is excellent (although quite pricey) but is nice for a special occasion and the service is great. If you are going on a Saturday night, and are staying up in the Hotel Jazz area then do not expect to get a taxi in a hurry - it took us 45 minutes to get a taxi and that was with the hotel trying to phone one and hail one - this is the norm for a Saturday night in Barcelona apparantly. Would stay there again.

<Title>“Great Reccomendation”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel on the strength of reviews of Trip Advisor. The location was excellent, the staff friendly and the rooms were modern and very clean. The one slight, and I mean slight, downside was that the sound proofing was not great. Our room was just beside the lift and we knew when other guests were coming and going. The pool was a great facility and breakfast was substantial. Would definitely stay there again

<Content>Stayed here for one night pre cruise - as suggested on this site asked for a room on a high floor - request met by hotel - could just hear distant rumble of metro but no problem. Room and service excellent - had breakfast at the hotel which was reasonable value for the wide choice available but if you only want a juice, coffee and a croissant go out. Staff at the desk very pleasant and helpful and e mail facility useful. Highly recommended!

<Title>“Everything they say is right”
<Content>I booked this hotel on the basis of Trip Advisor reviews. Everything lived up to very high expectations. We had a problem with the shower which was fixed very quickly. No other complaint on any aspect. Cafe D'Or opposite was first stop and also lived up to expectations. Recommend bus trips to assess the city and what's on offer. Fellow guest was robbed by very pushy flower girl. She was as efficient as a street magician - literally right before his eyes. Local advice is push and kick them away. If you like seafood you are spoiled for choice of highest quality. Don't like seafood ? you won't enjoy a culinary experience. On the central reservation down Las Rambla they sell beer in a giant brandy glass. The cost is a stupid £6.50 glass so share. Absolutely brilliant hotel and weather but there is no doubt that in general the Catalonians do not like tourists of any nationality, Graffiti near park "good tourist = dead tourist". Obviously written by one of the very many surly locals. Despite that, if you haven't been, go. And stay at the Jazz.

<Content>This is a nice boutique type hotel with an excellent Barcelona location. Room and bath were good sized with very nice amenities. Prior to arriving, I emailed the hotel with a special request and they honored it. The only negative was that the card in the room for ordering room service breakfast was confusing and did not list the cost.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>Stayed in the Hotel Jazz for four nights. The hotel itself was very clean (cleaned every day and changed the towels aswell every day), loads of freebies, so if you forget anything they should have it and roof top pool was great after a hard days shopping and sight-seeing. Staff were really friendly. Its location is perfect for the first time visitors to Barcelona. Its right up the street from the main shopping areas and has a sight-seeing bus stop right around the corner. My only complaint would be that the breakfast was very expensive. Its not included in the room price so I'd advise you eat somewhere cheaper! One more thing, if your dining out in Barcelona go to a thai restaurant called Thai Sabai Sabai its FANTASTIC!

Airconditioning was superb and location was just steps away from the subway and walkable to Las Ramblas. Room was very quiet and cozy. Very modern fixtures - bathroom had both tub and shower. Free access to the internet. Would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends!! Would be helpful if there were porters though. Some of the staff were not too helpful.

They were modern, nicely furnished, clean and comfortable. The staff were helpful and even gladly stored and retrieved our baggage (i.e. for 16 people about to board a cruise!!!) without a fuss! The Hotel is also in a great location! I would recommend this hotel to other travellers. Hint: Don't miss the Barcelona by night tour. It was excellent and the starting point is a few minutes walk from Hotel Jazz

<Title>“Good value for money in a great location”
<Content>Stayed at the Jazz Hotel for four nights in August 2006 following the reviews here on Trip Advisor. Efficient check in following a fairly late evening arrival, to a very comfortable and trendy looking room. However, one minor downside was that even though we were on the 6th floor, the whole building seemed to vibrate as the underground trains went through beneath us! They did stop by 1:00 in the morning and started again at about 6:00. So while there were a lot of positives to the Jazz Hotel, it is worth noting the one negative we found. Otherwise, it's a great hotel in a great location. All the staff we encountered gave excellent service and the breakfast was worth it for the quality and convenience. The free internet acces was a bonus.

<Title>“Great Hotel and Great Pool!!”
<Content>We booked this hotel after reading all of the great reviews on this website and were not at all disappointed!! We stayed here for 3 nights prior to cruising and certainly felt we got great value in a very good location. Check in was very smooth and everyone was friendly. All tried to speak English and were very attentive to any requests. The rooms were clean and modern with great floor to ceiling windows and a glass door that opened up to look onto the street. We had requested the sixth floor or higher based on previous reviews and found it waiting for us when we arrived. Though you could hear some rumbling from the subway below, it was nothing distracting at all. The location of the hotel was excellent- literally down the street from Las Ramblas and 2 blocks from Placa Catalunya. All of the perks of a downtown hotel without the noise and chaos. We always felt safe walking back to the hotel at night as well. Now, the pool was the main reason we booked here and we again were not disappointed! It had great views of the city from the top floor, had lots of tables, chairs and loungers, and refreshing water. The pool is not heated so it is not an issue in the summer and is only about 4.5 ft deep so it is meant mainly for dipping. We found that if you wanted to lie by the pool, you needed to be back to the hotel by about 2pm or your would have more trouble getting a chair. People seemed to head back for that time. Again, in an area of 4 star hotels with so much to do this hotel is great for the money and experience. I would highly recommend it to anyone! If you have some time to spend in Barcelona and have heard of Salvador Dali, i recommend purchasing the "Figures and Girona Dali Tour" through Expedia. The bus picks you up in Placa Catalunya and is a great way to spend the day. Girona is a walled city (medieval church and all) and we were pleasantly surprised by how lovely it was. Going to the Salvador Dali museum in Figurese was quite the experience- it's very animated, interesting and a great way to spend the day.

<Title>“Jazz- Perfect hotel for a great price”
<Content>I have never before written a review but I feel compelled to comment on the great service we received at Jazz hotel. My husband and I stayed at Hotel Jazz for only one night before our cruise. We arrived at 9am after a very long flight from Vegas and were told that we could immediately check in even though we had not made any prior arrangements to do so (what a relief for our jet lagged, weary bodies). The room was IMMACULATE and very spacious. It was also in a superb location, in the center of town with in walking distance (or a shirt metro ride) from everything we wanted to see. Definitely don't miss the Sagrada Familia, the Gothic Quarter and the Park Guell!!! The price was also very reasonable for the impeccable service and quality Hotel Jazz delivered. Everyone at the front desk was courteous and helpful. The breakfast buffet was a bit overpriced , but the food was great. I will definitely book this hotel on our next trip.

<Title>“Two Days at The Jazz Hotel”
<Content>I returned to Barcelona after a 20-year absence, bringing my wife, her two college-age children and my two teen-age children. We booked three rooms at the Jazz Hotel, two through bookings[""] and another through expedia[""], because the bookings occurred at different times. I booked us this hotel for three reasons: Convenient location, stylish and thoughtful presentation and expectations of good service at a new hotel (it only four years old). We were not disappointed -- at $160 ($125 euros) per night per room, we could have gone to a less expensive hotel. But we were pleased with the service, the cleanliness and the rooms themselves. The pool on the roof is small but the view, while not spectacular, is still worth heading up for. My wife was especially impressed by the quietest AC system we'd ever had in a hotel room anywhere. Jazz Hotel is a block from Plaza Catalunya and the Ramblas, and there is a very good Tapas restaurant (D'Or Restaurant) across the street, which we went to, on a recommendation from a Tripadvisor post, on the first night. The beer on tap there is great, and I suggest you ask Felipe, the waiter in the back of the place, to serve you a tapas sampler. Really great. Americans and Anglos generally will like Hotel Jazz for its capable service -- all desk people spoke English well -- and the easy access to everything. After reading this site I was concerned prior to our visit that the tremble of the subway would keep us up after our long trip to Barcelona. We definitely felt the rumble a couple of times -- we were all on the fourth floor -- but it didn't wake me up from sound sleeps, and generally did not detract from the experience. I think those posting complaints about the subway rumble must have been on the lowest floor (3rd) or were hypersensistive. I highly recommend this hotel for a two or three-day stay in Barcelona, especially if you plan to eat out, as we did. The hotel bar is rather limited, and the breakfasts at 14 euros apiece we didn't spring for. Still well worth going for.

<Title>“The Jazz is a Gem!”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz for 2 nights before our July 1st cruise. We were a family of 10, needing 3 double rooms and one quad. Conveniently, since we were all meeting from different parts of the US, the staff put all of us on the 7th floor, which was both quiet and comforable. The rooms were great, large by European standards, very clean, lots of toiletries if you forgot anything and great bedding (we asked for a King when we booked and although it was 2 singles pushed together, it was a big improvement over many European doubles we have had before) . My one complaint would be that with the design of the 1/4 glass door on the showers, it is impossible not to get the floor wet when you take a shower. The breakfast buffet was great, but a little expensive at 14 Euros. The staff at the front desk were all very helpful and all spoke English (this was not true at the hotel my in-laws stayed at down the street - where language was a definite problem). They helped us with touring suggestions, maps, taxis, restaurant suggestions and reservations. The one suggestion that we were disappointed in was for a restaurant on the waterfront, (it think it was "Posit" or something like that). It was the most expensive meal of the entire trip and probably the worst food, although the location was nice. To give the desk clerk his due, he did say that he had never eaten there so he was going by the fact that we asked for seafood and a waterfront location. All of their other suggestions were very good. For lunch one day they suggested "3 Frogs" (I think) and the inexpensive 3 course lunch was great! The hotel's location is excellant for touring - there is a bus stop right around the corner for the red and blue buses, which are a great way to see the ciy and stop at all the "sites". It is an easy walk to Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas. And at the end of a hot day of touring, a dip in the small (but clean) rooftop pool was a nice treat. ( the lounge chairs could use a little work) . Overall, when 10 family members all agree that the hotel choice was excellant, I'm a happy person, (I picked the Jazz) and we would stay there again!

<Title>“Great place to stay”
<Content>Just got back from a break in Barcelona . Stayed at the Hotel Jazz which was great . It has a brilliant location close to the Place de la Catalunya . The hotel facilities are really good for a 3 star hotel . The roof top pool area was perfect to come back to after a hard day's sightseeing .Also a really good breakfast selection. We made use of the bus turistic and would recommend them to anybody wishing to get a flavour for Barcelona .They visit all the top sites and you can hop off and on as often as you like . Would especiialy recommend the Pablo Espanyol site ( living exhibition of different spanish villages / crafts / resteraunts ) .Also enjoyed the Nou Camp . Slightly concerned before we went about safety but never had any issues over there at all - just need to be sensible and don't advertise the fact that you are a tourist ( carrying bags etc ). Even strolling for a meal at night - would recommend the Ramblas Catalunya - much quieter than the famous Ramblas and plenty of great Tapas bars . Overall a fantastic city and we will definitely be going back .

<Title>“Fantastic Jazz ... the first and ONLY choice”
<Content>My girlfriend and I have just returned from a sensational four night stay in the Jazz. The rooms were absolutely pristine, with brilliant air conditioning - with the temperature outside hovering around 40C most days, we actually found the room was cold on a couple of occasions! We had a room on the 3rd floor, and despite arriving at 9:30am we were checked into our room immediately and made to feel incedibly welcome. Yes, we heard the Metro trains on occasions but this certainly didn't interupt or spoil our stay - in fact I would say it was the one reminder that you're in a city hotel - and as we wanted a city break, that wasn't an issue for us. The roof top pool and terrace were absolutely A1 - and the friendly bar staff would take orders for drinks and snacks from the convenient telephone on the sun deck and bring them up to you either by the pool or on the deck itself - just excellent service. The complimentary internet access and willingness to store our luggage on the last day (we had an evening flight) were nice touches which made the stay all the more memorable. The best highlight though without doubt is the great bar on the 1st floor of the hotel. Often hotel bars are stuffy places where you want to get out ASAP, but this is not the case at the Jazz. The bar staff were very friendly, offering suggestions on good places to visit and being attentive without being pushy. In particular, Donato - an Italian guy who works behind the bar there - was very friendly - ask for him, and his 'Donato Special' drink - guaranteed to give you a fat head in the morning! Local resturants and bars are excellent too - try the 'Cafe D'or' which is opposite the Jazz and serves brilliant snacks, it's a great breakfast haunt. They also offer the local beer by the Damm - I made that mistake only once, a Damm is apparently a litre!! We also liked the Carusso resturant on La Rambla, which had excellent food and brilliant Sangria. All in all, loved Barcelona, loved the Jazz and certainly wouldn't stay anywhere else. This hotel is a gem and we were delighted to have found it. There's nowhere else in Barcelona offering this level of service and quality for such a reasonable price.

<Title>“Perfection! Wish we stayed longer.”
<Content>An unbelieveable hotel! My husband and I stayed there only one night, post-cruise, during our honeymoon. We wish we could've stayed longer! The front desk checked us in immediately at around 8:30 a.m. even though check-in isn't typically until 3 p.m. The elevator was really tiny and barely fit us and our luggage but what a room! I had emailed the hotel ahead of time and told them it was our honeymoon and they gave us, probably, the best room (actually it was a suite or seemed like one) in the hotel! Be sure to request room 706 if you go. It really was huge, had nice lighting and a great surround sound system in the room. I loved the music! The views were unbelieveable and the doors opened to a quaint balcony on both sides of our corner suite. The bathroom was modern and large and contained two showers, a bidet and complimentary toiletries (toothbrush, toothpaste, shower cap, shower gel and shampoo, a shoe shiner, razor and comb). There was a minibar which was more on the reasonably priced side and a pull-out couch for any extra guests. The closet was also a decent size and contained a safe for no extra charge. The location was fabulous! It was in a very nice neighborhood with the Metro on the corner and Playa Catalunya and La Ramblas down the street. There is a nice breakfast/tapas place across the street and an Irish pub a few steps away. A Starbucks and Hard Rock are also within walking distance. I did not feel uncomfortable at all while I was there, despite the online reports of theft I read before our visit. After strolling down La Ramblas (so cool!), we decided to take the Metro to Sagrada Familia. Words cannot describe the beauty of this amazing cathedral! Definitely a must-see. And it took less than 15 min. to get there. It was 8,00 E per person to enter and was well worth it. We slept soundly through the night (I never once heard the Metro) and the rooms seemed to have been sound proof once you close the curtains. The bed was extremely comfortable and cozy and there was a fuzzy blanket that I curled right up in and made me fall fast asleep. If we ever get the opportunity to return to Barcelona, I wouldn't consider any other hotel. Thanks Hotel Jazz!

<Title>“Noisy but Gem of a Hotel with rumblings of the Metro below”
<Content>We booked this hotel for the location and modern amentities, and the great reviews of other [-------------------]traveler prior to July 17. Everything met our expectations except for the noise level. We were on the the third floor and hear and felt the room shake whenever a Metro train pulled into the station in the underground below. Coming from California, I sense when there's an earthquake and this is what it felt like. After the first night, we asked if it might make a difference if we moved to an upper floor, and the front desk said they would try but the hotel was fully booked. Not sure it would have made a difference. The front staff assured us the Metro ran until 12 midnight, but I was kept up until 1:30 am, and woken up at 5 am again when trains started running again. Needless to say, I slept very badly on the both nights despite a full day of exploring the City. Don't know why the structure of the building did not insulated itself against the underground -- I have lived in NYC with many subways below my office or apt. The hotel itself is luxurious and rooms comfy for the 150 euros we paid, but not worth the annoyance of hearing the trains. Not sure why none of the other reviews we saw on traveladvisor.com did not mention the Metro noise. Was everyone else on a higher floor than us on the 3rd? Other travel tips: Sagrada Familia: take the elevator with the shorter line, to the right of the entrance (easy to miss this one bec you get swept into the church with the rest of the crowds to the opposite elevator). Go between 6 and 7pm when the crowds have thinned. Palau de Musica Catalan: indoor architectural tour of the stunning concert hall. Great cafe with pintxos, brushetta-like snacks with all sorts of toppings. Eating: Cafe L'Opera, La Rambla: where Picasso had his coffee :-) Churros con xocolata is the highlight. Cal Pep, Placa de las Olles: tapas bar where the line starts before doors open at 8pm, no menu, waiter orders for you but you may tell him to stop serving or your bill will surprise you. Origen, Passiage de Born: real Catalan homestyle cooking, magazine like menu with 5 pages of desserts before all other menu items! Extremely reasonable - 35 euros for two. **Overall, stay in the Gothic neighborhood to eat, restaurants are less touristic than La Rambla. Catalans are friendly people, we did not encounter any rude locals at all.

<Title>“Hot Jazz”
<Content>I've just returned from a 2 day break in Barcelona with my husband. We stayed one night in the JAZZ hotel and absolutely loved it. The decor is very tasteful. Our room was spotless, comfortable and had many little touches that enhanced our stay. The staff were mannerly and efficient. The price was incredibly reasonable. The rooftop pool and the effective air-conditioning made 41 degrees more bearable! The location of the hotel is perfect, very central for sight-seeing, eating and shopping. I would certainly recommend the Jazz hotel. My one piece of advice would be to ask for as high a floor as possible as you are in the middle of the city and very close to the underground train system.

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel 3* with 5* attitude”
<Content>This website was right!, this is a gem of a hotel, fabulous situation within walking distance of all the main attractions. Very modern building, exceptionally clean and well kept. Although there were 4 hen parties staying at the same time as us they never bothered us and if they were noisey we certainly did not hear them. I took the advise of other visitors and requested a high floor room, we were given room 501, 3 floors from the top, very quiet, never heard the metro once, and fab air con! The weather last weekend was boiling hot and we took advantage in the late afternoon of a dip in the pool, my only criticism would be that there are not enough loungers as everyone had the same idea as us! We only had breakfast at the hotel, no other meals this was very satisfying and met our needs, however I have to say that if we stay there again I would go out for breakfast, I had made the mistake of thinking that breakfast was included so the 28 euro charge for 2 I felt was a bit steep. Our taxi driver had no probelm in finding the hotel and the taxi fare from the airport cost 25 euros including a tip, we arrived at 5:30pm so also had to contend with evening traffic on a Friday. As for places to eat out I would avoid Port Vell, although nice for a wander and a drink its really just a glorified cinema complex. Head instead for Port Olympic for more choice and nicer surroundings, although on Saturday night by midnight it had started to get a bit rowdy. As a treat we had dinner at the Hotel Arts, excellent food and service but no change from 250 euros for 2 and that was for only 2 courses and coffee and wine, but worth the experience. All in all I would say a fantastic trip made all the better by the hotel whose staff were friendly and efficient, will definitely come again but this time for longer!

<Title>“Hotel Jazz hit a sour note”
<Content>I was very disappointed in the service we received from some of the front desk people. I accidentally left a scarf and leather jacket at the hotel. I requested they send it to me, at my expense and after I confirmed w/ the staff that they had it. It was never returned. This hotel also doesn't have an onsite restaurant that offers lunch or dinner. There were thankfully places around to eat, but it would have been convenient to have onsite options. Lastly, when we arrived, the woman at the front desk complained to us that we had too much luggage. Well, there were four of us and everyone had a bag. Not a great way to welcome patrons.

<Title>“Met All Our Expectations”
<Content>This hotel was wonderful and exactly as we had expected as all of the reviews on Tripadvisor were accurate - thank you Tripadvisor! First off, getting to the hotel was extremely convenient. We caught the Aerobus (which was very easy to find outside A1) from the airport for € 3.50 and took it straight to the Universitat station, got off and headed straight for Pelai Street and there was Jazz Hotel. It is in a safe, central and convenient location right by everything. The hotel itself is very trendy, bright and immaculately clean. A bit on the smaller side, like most European hotels but we didn't mind at all as it was a very comfortable stay. Full amenities and wonderful service was provided as the staff were friendly, professional and helpful. We liked the free internet terminals on the 2nd floor by the bar which was handy. We had dinner at the tapas bar across the street on Pelai, Cafe D'or, and found to our delight our meal was quite tasty and would highly recommend. In the morning, we walked over to La Rambla, the main street where there are alot of shops and street performers and that was only 10 min. away from our hotel. Make sure you check out Barrio Gotic while you're in the area - very cool. We checked out the rooftop pool and it seemed really nice but unfortunately, we did not have a chance to try it. If we had to find one fault of this place, we would only recommend trying to get a room on the higher floor as the street traffic can be a slight hum on the 2nd floor (where we stayed). All in all, we had a wonderful stay at the Jazz Hotel and for the price, we would definitely come back again. You just can't go wrong at this place!

<Title>“Cool hotel”
<Content>Our first family holiday with two teenagers so we were a little nervous but everything was perfect. The hotel hit just the right note - cool but not pretentious, friendly but never overbearing service, comfortable but not fussy. The location is excellent, the rooftop pool is a great place to chill out. There are several sandwich shops nearby for breakfast (ours wasn't included in our package) or take a travel kettle as there are no facilities for making tea or coffee (the only minus).

<Content>Very much enjoyed our stay at the Jazz. Location is very good, being at the top of the Ramblas. Rooms are very nice - cool and quiet. Only very small complaint is that theres no coffee making facilities in the room. Swimming pool on the roof is great for cooling off (not big enough for a proper swim though) after topping up your tan :)

<Title>“Fantastic hotel”
<Content>Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Jazz. Very modern + large rooms + large bathroom. Great location - minutes from Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas. The aeroport bus also stops a few minutes at Placa Universitat (although we caught a taxi from the airport as our plane arrived late - 22 euros). Must advise that aeroport bus on the way back to airport does not stop at Placa Universitat - must go to Placa Catalunya to board!! Staff extremely helpful and the rooftop looks inviting although did not have time to enjoy. This hotel is highly recommended!

<Content>We have just returned from 9 day's in Barcelona (7 nights at Jazz Hotel and 2 nights at Port Aventura Hotel) The staff at the Hotel Jazz were very helpful and very nice. On the first day, they gave us a Map of Barcelona and some advices about the trains to Port Aventura and Figueres (they have printed us the timetable of the trains...). We have stayed at the 716, and have a beautifull view from our balconny. The ROOMS are modern, clean and well equipped. The BATHROOM is nice and have plenty of complimentary toiletries (toothbrush, shaving kit, shoe shine kit, sewing kit, sponge,...). At the 1st floor we have free internet access, and a big TV (nice to see the football matches) I would definately reccommend this hotel and will have no hesitation in staying here again!

<Title>“Barcelona with two young children”
<Content>We arrived at the Jazz hotel in Barcelona after our cruise. We stayed in family suite #211 that was not only quite large, but very, very nice, with a flat screen TV, a great bathroom, desk, and sofa bed for the kids (ages 6 & 9). The hotel is very modern and very well done. The internet usage is free and there are two terminals. The pool on the roof made my kids very happy as Barcelona was quite hot. My overall review of The Jazz is that is very centrally located and a very nice place to stay. It is a 3 star hotel but to me, it's at least a 4.star. A few things that you may want to know: While checking in/out, Keep your valuables with you and notice your surrundings. When we checked in, someone stole a bag with jewlery from another couple with a child at the lobby, and even though the thief was cought on the security video, the victims had to waste five hours at the police station filling forms, etc.. In Barcelona and throughout Europe, keep your valulable with you at all times, no matter how safe the place looks. Keep panhandlers at least three feet away from you. One last thing, the cab driver from the port to the hotel tried to pull a fast one on me, so please, pay ONLY WHAT THE METER SHOWS. This could be the trip plus an addional charge for suitcases, but is should all be in the meter and ASK FOR A RECEIPT. The trip from the port to the Jazz should not be more than EUR 20

Such a modern, clean comfy and centrally located hotel: it was perfect. Fab rooms and friendly staff we did not want to come home. Would certainly reccomend Hotel Jazz to anybody visiting the city of Barcelona! Hope to visit again!

<Title>“The Jazz is another great Tripadvisor find”
<Content>Four of us booked two rooms for a one-night pre-cruise stay in June on the advice of other Tripadvisor reviewers. Once again, we got a great deal on a hotel. I really have no complaints. The hotel is in a terrific location. Fabulously close to the metro, the on-and-off tour bus stops, great dining, Las Ramblas and excellent shopping. The hotel staff were incredibly helpful - even sending several people calling about and running into the street to flag down a large cab for four people plus cruise luggage. Warning - if you are traveling with a lot of baggage or a big party, expect to have trouble getting a cab that can accomodate you. We had to take separate cabs on several occasions while in Barcelona. The hotel was spotlessly clean and even rather chic. Didn't use the pool - no time. The rooms had well stocked minibars and even had flat screen tvs. Beds were comfortable although I probably would not have noticed if they were not since we were all so tired. We did get personal attention at this small hotel which was a great change from the big chains. They recommended a great and reasonably priced restauranct for dinner although I can't remember the name of the place. We even met some very nice people from the UK in the lobby. I guess I do have one tiny complaint because we only got one bar of soap for use between the shower and the sink. I found this to be true at several hotels throughout Europe though. I guess as an American I am spoiled by the shower and bath amenities we consume here in the US. Anyway, I would DEFINITELY stay at the hotel again and I feel we found a perfect hotel for us thanks in part to this great website. Thank you once again Tripadvisor members!

<Content>I have just returned from 3 days (25-26-27 of June). The hotel is in the perfect location for sightseeing. Easy walking distance to La Ramble and the metro literally on your doorstep. The room we had was clean, tidy, large with a large bathroom. The hotel was very modern. One general comment/recommendation about Barcelona not the hotel - when in Barcelona look after your values. Jazz has a safe in the room, use it. I met at least 6 people had had their values removed. Appart from the above comment. My wife and I had no trouble at all in Barcelona. We though it was a beautiful friendly city and we will be going back.

<Title>“Perfect location for a shopping spree in Barcelona”
<Content>We have just returned from Hotel Jazz, Barcelona for a week of holiday. The hotel is ideally located in the center of everything shopping, entertainment, people watching, street entertainment. A sight seeing bus station is just across the street that takes you to all the sight seeing spots in Barcelona. Besides its perfect location, the hotel is very modern, clean, and well managed by a bunch of friendly staff members. The air condition in the room is absolutely perfect to keep the room very cold and comfortable after a tan on the roof top or hours of shopping under the hot sun. Very comfortable room at a very reasonable price. We will return next winter for the winter sale period for some nice leather shoe, jacket, shirt, ..........etc. We have travelled to Paris, Thailand, Japan, Canada, America, Singapore, Malaysia, Germany, Switzerland, Holland, Italy, France, China, Monaco, Indonesia,Korea, Taiwan. Hotel Jazz Barcelona is the best. Ole!!

<Title>“Decent Hotel, Not sure of Price”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz Hotel June 16, 17 & 25. We had two nights before our cruise and one night after. On our pre-cruise nights, we were on the 6th floor. Our room faced the courtyard. I could hear a faint rumble of the metro below, but I found it amusing and no trouble at all. It was quiet the first night, but the second night, there was a band playing in the hotel and they didn't stop until 6:00am. So, we finally fell asleep, but then woke up late and had to rush to get out and get to the cruise ship. The room was impeccably clean. The hotel maids work so hard to make sure each room is absolutely spotless. I did not like the shower. Whomever designed them did a poor job. The glass screen doesn't cover enough and the bathroom gets all wet. On our post cruise stay, we were allowed to check in early. I forgot the cruise ship boots you off by 9:00am and with no place to go with our luggage we headed over to the Jazz. We got lucky and they were able to check us in early. However, this time we were on the second floor. The metro rumble is a little louder and we also had a window facing the street. It was a bit noisier at this location, but what really bothered me, was a sound like someone above us was dragging a chair across the floor all night. It continued until 3:00am. One last word on the rooms....they are really small. I understand that by European Standards, it is supposed to be considered large, but my cabin onboard the ship was larger as well as my master bedroom bathroom back home. On the roof top, they do have a nice pool. I didn't swim, but many people were using the lounge chairs for sun. There is also plenty of room up there along with tables, chairs and umbrellas to bring a meal from one of the local restaurants and dine alfresco. We enjoyed doing this twice. A nice plus was the free internet on the 1st floor by the bar. I could get on most anytime I wanted and was able to keep in touch with my daughter back home. Over all, it was a decent hotel. Most are noisy anyway. But this place is clean as can be and close to everything. So, your location couldn't be any better. I do have to complain about the price. This hotel cost us 203Euro a night, which I think is steep for a tiny room in a 3 star hotel. The mini-bar had outrageous prices too. A tiny bottle of orange juice was 3Euro. We bought 2 bottles at Starbucks across the street for 3Euro. That's half the price! Would I stay here again??? I might, but not before checking prices on other hotels that I saw nearby.

<Title>“Great Place, Perfect Location!”
<Content>The location of the Jazz Hotel is great, very central. The place itself is incredibly clean, and we loved the hip, modern feel. The staff is very pleasant and helpful and they recommended a couple of non-tourist-y, off-the-beaten-path restaurants which were wonderful. Our room was right on a major road, but the windows are all sound-proofed, so we didn't hear a thing. My only complaint is that our king-sized bed was actually two twins pushed together, so there was a little crevasse in between them. Frankly, that's a minor complaint and the hotel is an excellent value for the money. Next time we go to Barcelona, we'll definitely stay here!

<Content>Have just spent two nights at this great hotel. Flew Ryanair from East Mids airport to Girona airport, easy to pick up taxi outside airport. Took us an hour to Hotel, 120euros, ok because there were three of us. We had room 711 at Hotel, triple room, very clean, plenty of room. Good location, 5mins walk to Las Ramblas. Turn right out of Hotel and across road to pick up orange open topped bus for tour of city, good value, 19 euros for the day. Hailed a taxi, turn left out of Hotel, went to Port Olimpic on the Sat night, 10euros, plenty of restaurants, a great area. Called at Arts Hotel for a drink, very posh, see how the other half live!. No hesitation in recommending Hotel Jazz and Barcelona, we had a great time. Kay, Angie and Angie.

<Title>“Jazz Hotel Fantastic !”
<Content>We have just retunred from a weekend break in Barcelona celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary ! Everything about our holiday was perfect from the moment we set foot in Barcelona. We booked the Hotel Jazz through recommendations using this wedsite. The hotel is in the perfect place for all your sightseeing. Easy walking distance to La Rambles and the metro literally on your doorstep. The room we had was very spacious and had the biggest bed ! Everything was clean and the hotel very modern and contemperary in decor. We couldn't fault it. The only thing were didn't use was the restaurant. We had breakfast at a place called Buenas Migas which was just of the La Rambles, at Place Bonsuccess 6 which served loverly pastries and coffee. In the evening we went to a restaurant called Les Quinze Nits on the Place Reial which was brilliant, the food there was great and very reasonable in price and very very popular. It opens at 8.30pm and there was a big queue just waiting for the place to open, but it was worth the wait. We ended up going there twice as it was so great. If you go Barcelona, do stay the the Hotel Jazz it is well worth it !

<Title>“Brilliant location, lovely staff,good value”
<Content>Stayed at the Jazz Hotel from the 25th May to the 29th May. The rooms are a nice size with a safe, quiet air conditioning and the whole of the hotel is non smoking which is unusual in this part of the world. Ask for a room on a higher floor as you can hear in the background the rumble of the trains. We were in room 608 overlooking the front of the hotel and we had no trouble sleeping. The reception staff are wonderful, always willing to discuss were to visit, what restaurants might be of interest and they don't just direct you to touristy restaurants they share with you where they go to eat and relax. Location is wonderful the street into Placa de Catalunya is lined with shoe shops and the walk takes five minutes and its a very safe area even if you are two girls travelling alone as my friend and I were. The pool is great after a hot shopping spree and it is warm enough to use now as we were grateful to cool down on Sunday afternoon. Universitat subway is two mins away and the subways are clean and easy to use. The tube staff are really helpful too! If you are going to make a few trips together get one book of ten tickets and share it. But note it is really hot down in the underground even in the evenings so you might like to walk especially as most restaurants are in easy reach and everyone is out and about too. We went to Rubi Supper Club in Banys Vells off Carrer de la princesa - not huge menu choice modern fusion theme - nice quality though in a relaxed bar atmosphere. Really good cocktails and not too noisy if you get there eary - about nine o'clock. There's a new restaurant in Carrer de la Argenteria called Cheeseme which we went to and this was also good. The restaurant looks out on a little Plaza so it is a great place to people watch as there are a couple of tapas establishments and a bar off the square. Best tapas bar was the one round the corner from the hotel in Placa de la Univesitat but can't recall it's name but reception will direct you. Very good for your first night meal as you get your bearings. Packing - bring comfortable shoes as you will walk lots and lots. The Gothis quarter and El Born are a wonderful maze of little streets with tiny boutiques and speciality food shops. When it gets warm these are nice as they are cooler and every so often you find a placa to sit and watch the world go by. Really lovely hotel in a great location and hospitality wise five star in my view.

<Title>“Great Hotel !”
<Content>My husband and I have just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hotel Jazz in Barcelona - we had a fantastic time, the Hotel was great, well positioned, ( NB quicker to get to from the University bus stop on the Airport Bus than the Placa Catalunya bus stop ). The staff were very polite and friendly, sorted our safe out, ordered taxis etc. The room was lovely, very modern and very clean. The mini bar was well stocked although we didn't use any of it - we did use the fridge for storing our own drinks though ! No tea or coffee making facilities in the room but it didn't bother us, air conditioning was good, we were on the 5th floor - no noise as the rooms are soundproofed but you can feel the metro - not a problem though. The bed was very big and comfortable. Take care in the bathroom as the shower panel was not really long enough so some water inevitably went on the floor. Breakfast was lovely - included in our overall price and ideal for us. Weather was lovely too - so nice to sit around the pool on the 8th floor at the end of the day. We didn't swim but some people did - a little on the chilly side though ! We purchased a tourist bus ticked for 2 days - excellent value - 23 euros for 2 days, 19 euros for one day. We could have sat on it all day in the sunshine ! Hold on to your hats though and make sure you have suncream on ! You must go to the market on the right hand side half way down the Ramblas - it is unbelievable ! All in all a fabulous trip and a great hotel.

<Title>“Centrally located”
<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Jazz from 25 April - 2 May on our Honeymoon. From previous reviews we knew we had made a good choice. When we arrived we found that honeymooners have no special treatment to that of any other guest, which was a shame as we felt they could have done something to make our stay more memorable, even a free drink at the bar would have been nice - but nothing was given, despite emailing ahead to advise of our special trip. That said the hotel itself was very comfortable to stay in. The rooms were kept very clean and the decor was very modern. We loved the bathroom and the flat screen television which kept us up to date with the News and the odd Football game! (Barcelona played twice in the week we were there!). We spent a couple of days lying round the rooftop pool but did not take a dip as it is unheated so was a bit too fresh for our liking. Weather was great though. The menu for food at the hotel was very limited so room service was a definite no. We had breakfast twice but at 14 euros each it was too pricey for every day but there was a nice variety to choose from. As both of us are Vegetarian we found a few nice restuarants that catered for us, but be warned most restaurants don't open until 8 -8:30 pm unless on the Ramblas. We highly recommend FresCo a self service all you can eat salad bar ( turn right and right again out of the hotel and its on the left side of the road along a few hundred yards) brilliant value for money as there is pizza and pasta and ice cream and fruit all in the price. Juicey Jones we came across when taking a walk - very colourful decor!!! had a nice set meal deal and is predominantly a juice bar but the food was very nice. Bio Centre - four courses for a set price so go when hungry and you won't be disappointed. We also ate at Roissy - a restaurant with Medieval decor but very tasty and filling meals. L'Hortet - again lovely restaurant pretty blue lights in the window and food freshly made to order. We highly recommend taking a stroll along the ramblas as there are loads of shops and the street artists are worth giving a euro or two too as although many are of the painted statue variety there are a few that react to a coin tossed into their bucket with a mini performance - quirky and fun. Also make the trip on the Metro to Parc Guell as this was a fantastic place to see. It is not for the faint hearted as the trek up to it is uphill but there are a few escalators outside to help you with the climb - but it is so worth it when you reach the top and look out over the beautiful city that is Barca.

<Title>“Really good choice, this hotel”
<Content>We found the Jazz Hotel to be excellent. My wife and I stayed 3 nights, Sun 7th - Tues 9th May. You could say that it was expensive but I found everything about the hotel was quality. Our room was on the 6th floor at the side of the hotel. The room was spacious enough and the bed larger than kingsize. We had a small balcony overlooking the street below - useful for enjoying the the display of football skills and antics prior to the triumphant Barcelona football team cavalcade passing by in the evening! Everthing was nice and clean. The staff very helpful. The breakfast was very nice with good selections. As for the Hotel position - 5/10 mins from Placa de Catalunya, which is at the top of the La Rambla and a leisurely walk all the way to the Port areas. The old Barri Gotic quarter is nearby and we were able to walk to the Sagrada Famila and also the El Eixample area, which is flush with modernista architecture - you will see buildings by Antoni Gaudi here. Useful tip - if you dont mind the walk wheeling a case, then catch the Aerobus from Placa de Catalunya to the Airport at only 3.75 Euros each.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>The hotel was in a great location at the top of the Rambles. Everywhere was walkable. The staff were efficient and helpful. The place was clean and tidy. The top floor with the pool was lovely. All in all a great place to stay. Yes the rooms aren't huge but then how much time do you intended to stay in the room and how much space do you actually need. They are about as big as a travel inn in the UK so more than sufficient.

<Title>“perfect choice!”
<Content>Went with some friends for a bank holiday break and found the hotel ideal for our neds. Vey modern iterior, friendly staff, and all the features needed. Free broadband internet access in the bar is a plus for the independant traveller and a very good USP for a hotel. The rooms are very well decorated and equipped Location is very close (2min walk) to the top of the La Rambla (main tourist street) and well within alking from the marina (30min walk). Metro link is also around the corner. In balance of fairness 3 things worth mentioning, no irons fr pressing clothes were available for the more vain amongst our group, the pool had no heating -might be ok in August but in April/May it was cold even though the weather was gorgeous. And the 3rd point although not a real issue is the rumbling of the metro can be heard underneath, but in no way does this disturb your relaxation or sleep, anyone who says anything different is a fool!! Barca was a great city to visit and Hotel Jazz a superb place to be based at.

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel”
<Content>Fantastic Hotel, rooms small but well equipped. We had a room on the 6. floor to the courtyard. It was realy quiet - you only hear a little bit of noises from the metro. The hotel is near Metro station Universitata. Take the bus A1 Aerobus from the airport and go off at the station Universitata. This is closer to the hotel as Placa Catalunya. The breakfast is not cheap (14 EUR) but it is a good breakfast buffet. The pool on the top now works, but its is very cool. We would take the Hotel again next time.

<Title>“Pool now open”
<Content>We have just returned from Barcelona having spent 4 nights at the Jazz Hotel (28th April - 2nd May 2006). It fully lived up to our expectations. We had three rooms on the 7th floor. All were clean, modern and spacious. The location was perfect - the north end of the Ramblas was about a five minute walk and the nearest metro (Universitat) was 50 metres away. Because of this proximity to the metro there was a slight rumble as trains went past. This was more noticable on the 1st floor but it certainly wasn't loud enough to be a problem. Sound proofing was very good; the traffic noise wasn't noticable. The air conditioning worked well and was virtually silent. We weren't going to have breakfast at the hotel (14 euros) but the variety was so good that we ate at the hotel 3 out of 4 mornings. The swimming pool was open during our stay but wasn't heated although it was still very refreshing after a day sightseeing. I'm struggling to find anything negative to say about this hotel. Bear in mind that this is a 3 star hotel so you don't get bathrobes, 24 hour room service, concierge etc. If these things are important to you then go to a 4/5 star hotel. This hotel was everything we could've wanted for a city break and I personally thought the price (150 euros per night) was perfectly acceptable. Pros - location, clean modern hotel, swimming pool. Cons - you won't be waited on hand and foot (perhaps a "pro"), no facilites for children.

<Title>“Would Highly Recommend”
<Content>We have just come back from a three night stay in Hotel Jazz, Barcelona. It is a lovely hotel and I would have no hesitation in recommending it. It is classed as a three star but in my opinion is a good 4 star hotel. The location is excellent - right on the border of the old town and the more upmarket part of town. There is a roof terrace with a pool and we enjoyed a swim last week in the sun (this seemed like a real treat considering the city centre location). The rooms are not big but a perfect size for a city hotel and the shower was great. The hotel is spotless clean and has a nice bar if you fancy a night cap before bedtime. The only negative thing I would say is that breakfast is expensive at almost €15 per head. Shop around for deals as I got quotes with up to 200 euros in the difference. Enjoy if you go!

<Title>“Hotel Jazz. Nice.”
<Content>The hotel is newly built (2004) and is modern, clean and well designed. The bedrooms are spacious and clean, and I found the beds to be exceptionally comfortable. If you add in the price of the stay and the hotel's location, the fact that you are less than 5 minutes from las Ramblas and less still from Placa de Catalunya (and the Aerobus that takes you to and from the airport) then it is easy to see why the hotel is high on the list of hotels to stay. Yes you can hear the odd bit of hubub from the streets below, the occasional rumblings of the tube - but these are generally kept out well by the windows - and anyway....you're staying here because it's in the heart of the city!! We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, so can't comment on the quality of that, but we did have some great tasting and great value breakfasts served up at some of the nearby cafes.

<Title>“Good hotel but overpriced”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Jazz for 7 nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary so we booked a suite. I knew the cost when I booked (direct with the hotel for suites unfortunately) but for that sum I expected separate living/sleeping rooms, however the suites are just large bedrooms with a bed settee and small table/chairs added. As a previous reviewer has said the beds are queen size but hard, although we did get used to them and slept well. Although the room and bathroom (506) were modern, clean and reasonably sized it was not what I had expected for 267 Euros a night for room only. I asked a receptionist if I could have bathrobes but she said that as they were only a 3 star hotel they didn't provide them - 3 star maybe but 4 star prices!! We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as I thought they were receiving enough of our money so I can't comment on the food. We did go into the bar on the 1st floor around 11.30pm one night but it was completely empty with no atmosphere, in spite of the hotel apparently being full. The pool was also being repaired throughout our stay so we not in use. On the positive side the hotel is well situated and the maid service is excellent. Soundproofing is also very effective and we always found the reception staff pleasant. Three restaurants we particularly enjoyed during our stay were: CAPUTXES - opposite the large church in the old town (not the cathedral - can't remember it's name but Del Mar rings a bell). It's an Italian restaurant and the lunches are really good value and excellent quality. Service is very good too. AGUA - near Port Olympic in the row of restaurants alongside the beach. Need to book for dinner as it's very popular but lunch is good too. A bit more expensive but worth the extra cost. Le Nits (not its full name but all I remember. It's in Placa Real, off Las Ramblas and queuing starts before 8pm - it opens at 8.30 - no booking. This place is fabulous, great extensive menu & wine list -Not to be missed!

<Content>Very nice hotel in a great location in Barcelona, just off all the main areas. Hotel was exceptionally clean and comfortable, hotel staff very helpful with excellent English. Getting from the airport to the Hotel was a bit of a hassle, have to switch trains and metro lines. Having asked staff about the return trip discovered there is an airport bus that drops you approx 5-10 mins walk from the hotel, all for only 3 euro 75 cents.

<Title>“Fantastic Jazz”
<Content>I booked the Jazz Hotel on the strength of this site, it was a surprise long weekend for my fencee on her birthday. I wanted it to be as perfect as possible and I had looked at a number of hotels in Barcelona and this one had by far the best write up. I have to say the hotel lived up to every expectation and made a great base for our weekend. I took the advise of what I had read on the site and asked for a room on one on the upper floors (we got the 6th) so that we would not hear the subway. This was a good move and the staff were really helpful with any of our requests. The room was fantastic and very clean. Two little moans, one the pool on the roof was empty(but I suppose they all need cleaning) and 2nd the breakfast could have been a bit better. The Jazz Hotel was an ideal location to explore Barcelona, with only a 5 minute walk to Las Ramble, we also found the subway really easy to use. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, we will definatly be going back. One last word of warning, be very careful when ordering drinks if you are sitting in one of the street cafes on Las Rambles. We paid 33 euros for 2 drinks !!!!!!!

<Title>“doesn't deserve 3rd place”
<Content>Hotel Jazz has a great location to Las Ramblas and Bus Touristica. The rooms were good sized, perfectly cleaned,and with very nice toiletries. There was a very nice and empty lounge on the 1st floor with free internet service with two computer stations. I thought the beds were hard but comfortable. We were a large group and had one double (2 twins together) and one junior suite with one double and a queen sofa sleeper. The children were disappointed that the pool was closed, but it is never heated anyway. The maid service was the best! Better than any luxury hotel I have ever stayed at. the Cons the front staff needs to learn how to give directions, provide suggestions for restaraunts and entertainment, and be nice. If you have been to Barcelona and know how to get around-this is a great hotel. If you are new to the area, I would not recommend it. It is hard to find, taxi drivers never know how to find it and if they make a booking for you- they probably receive an incentive. On one incident, i made my own booking, I believe the staff was not happy, so he sent me to the wrong address. I plan to visit barcelona often so right now I have nothing to compare it with. But thereare many choices to choose from.

<Title>“Very good, but not without flaws...”
<Content>Stayed here weekend just gone. The location is excellent, 5 minutes from the top end of the Ramblas, just off Plaza Catalunya. Busy street below, but windows blocked out most noise. We were on 2nd floor and while we could hear the odd rumble of the subway, it certainly didn't bother us. The hotel itself looks brilliant. Very modern frontage and a cool, modern reception. The staff are excellent, all speak great English and are polite and warm. Beds are massive, bathrooms very modern, everything spotlessly clean. Free broadband internet a big plus. Like it. The gripes - * The place makes much play of its rooftop pool. All well and good if they actually bothered to fill it. It was getting on for 21 degrees when we were there and my girlfriend and sister were both looking forward to using it. Black mark. * We ordered breakfast to the room one morning. Bacon, eggs sausages etc. Stone cold. Not good enough, in fact inexcusable given the price of these things. All in all though, I would recommend this place if you get a decent deal. Location, staff and decor are all spot on.

<Title>“Appreciated by teens through to 50+!”
<Content>our party of 7 stayed at the Jazz from Feb26th to Feb 28th. Its location is very convenient without being too noisy. Everyone in our party had a a double room except me-their rooms were big but mine was smallish. It was situated right next to the lift which was a bit annoying during the night. Howevever , the bathroom was fab-it even had one of those magnifying mirrors on a latticed hinge!! The breakfast was ok-all the food was not terribly warm-and even TWO teabags couldn't make a decent cuppa!However there is a great cafe right next door -it sold gorgeous toasted sandwiches cheaply etc. I must recommend the staff for the way they helped me after my handbag was snatched from my arm about 100 yds from the hotel. They phoned the police and arranged taxis and were very kind. My bag was taken from my arm as we crossed at a crossing . The thief ran away in the direction of the Contemporary Art Museum nearby-real seedy backstreets -and he drew a knife. Our purpose was to celebrate a fiftieth birthday and my sister -who turned 50-and myself brought between us 5 daughters aged 16 to 24! They absolutely adored the hotel.

<Title>“Good not great”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz for a family break having read the reviews on Tripadvisor. Had 2 rooms - a double and a triple corner suite (for the kids). Nice modern decor. Staff helpful (ordered a 7 seater taxi etc) and spoke good English. The location is good and if you have a skateboarder in the party (as we did) it is very convenient for several of the better "spots" (MACBA, Universitat, one stop on metro to Paral.lel, etc). The position is a bit noisy and the breakfasts are quite expensive (though very good as well). So overall, we thought it was a good choice but not the best ever. We'd use it again.

<Title>“Great Location, Excellent room”
<Content>Hotel Jazz is a great one to stay in Barcelona. We stayed during March 06, here is a bit of information: Great Location: The hotel is situated about 5 min walk from Las Ramblas and Plaza Catalunya Great Amenities: We were told the hotel was constructed in 2004 so you can imagine that everything looks brand new. The T.V is great and modern, so are the bathrooms, floors etc. In addition, the room size is excellent compared to other European Hotels. The only bad thing I would say about this hotel would be that the name of it is a bit hidden. We took the bus from the airport and got off in Plaza Catalunyna. We walked a bit, and kept asking people about the hotel, but since it is new a few people knew about it. Finally we started asking about the street in which the hotel is located “pelayo” as soon as we asked for the street name; we were able to find it. The name of the hotel in on the side and is a bit small. We plan to go back next year, we loved it.

<Title>“Don't Believe the Hype”
<Content>As a frequent trip advisor user, I was disappointed with the hype of this hotel (especially it's #3 status!) Not only did our room and hallway have a musty bathroom-like odor, but we found several members of the staff to be rude and unknowledgable about sights and restaurants. As a young couple we were hoping to book at one of the more trendy and fun Barcelona restaurants. When our guidebook options were booked, we asked the hotel for recommendations. They sent us to a total tourist trap, expensive, formal restaurant where we were surrounded by people three times our age. It was not the type of place we were looking for had the staff listened to us. Couldn't help but think that the hotel probably got a huge kickback for sending us there! (Learning: make sure to book your restaurants in advance!) While the location is great, there are plenty of other hotels in this same area and I'm sure there are better values for the money you pay (it's not a cheap hotel)! I would definitely try another hotel the next time we return. Despite this experience, Barcelona was one of most favorite destinations. Enjoy!

<Title>“Thanks TripAdvisor!”
<Content>Going on the reviews here, we booked into the Hotel Jazz for three nights and weren't disappointed. As we arrived in Barcelona after dark we decided to get a taxi to the hotel instead of using the airport bus but it is so close to PLaca de Catalunya there would have been no problems using the bus instead (which we did for the return trip), currently 3.75 euros each, opposed to 23 euros for the taxi. The staff all spoke lovely english and were helpful. On arrival I remembered reviewers mentioning higher up rooms, so I asked and we ended up on the 6th floor overlooking the small internal courtyard. Aircon was a blessing as it decided to get warm while we were there - nice to have aircon that worked **too** well :) Very modern, contemporary designed rooms, bathroom was fab and even came with toiletries (more than I've seen anywhere) and the room had an LCD tv (woohoo!). Plus the free room safe was a boon meaning we just took enough cash out to last the day. The rooms are wi-fi enabled which meant we could use the PDA to email home, and surf the net checking out Barcelona info when needed. You're literally only a few mins walk away from La Rambla (or Ramblas depending where you see it written!!). The Bus Turistic leaves from Catalunya square and is very handy for all the sites. There's two routes (red - north, blue - south) and from April there's a smaller green route along the coast also. We got a 2-day ticket (22 euros each, 18 for one day). If you're finished on the red route, there's actually a stop just by the hotel to save your legs ;) I can't comment on the pool or breakfast services as we didn't use those but this is a high-quality 3* hotel (probably should be a 4*). We'd go back if we ever did Barcelona again and would definitely recommend it to friends and family.

<Title>“What a perfect base.”
<Content>You must try this gem of a base in Barcelona. We have just returned from 3 nights at the Hotel Jazz in Barcelona and adored it. Our booking was influenced by previous reviews and everything written by previous guests was spot on. Modern does not mean uncomfortable - it was a real departure from our usual choice of hotel but were not disappointed. Fabulous location near to all public transport - the very efficient metro only few yards away (very easy to use - purchase T10 ticket for 6.75 Euro in metro station and share between all members of party just by re-inserting into machine on metro or bus), multitude of buses passing in all directions and the heart of the city so close on foot. There are several eating places in close proximity and great shops too. The airport bus even goes to and from Placa de Catalunya (outside El Cortes Ingles Department Store)every few minutes and is only 3.75 Euro each way - and is again only a short walk away from the hotel. Otherwise taxi from airport to hotel is approx 25 Euro. City taxis are numerous and inexpensive too. The hotel is most comfortable, great beds and plumbing, and so clean with fast efficient lifts. There is also a free safe in the room. The noise of the busy city can easily be shut out by closing the balcony double glazed doors and if you think the faint rumble of the metro will bother you then request a 7th floor top room to help minimise this. The roof top seating area is pleasant, breakfast offers a good choice to suit everyone and the staff are most helpful.There is also a luggage room if you have a late flight. All in all a great base to explore a fantastically vibrant and diverse city. We would also add that if you like football,a trip to see FC Barcelona play at the Camp Nou is definitely worth arranging as we did - tickets can be delivered to hotel to await your arrival on various web sites and it is only 6 stops by metro from hotel.

<Title>“Lovely hotel, Excellent location!!!”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz from the 22nd Feb till the 25th Feb 06. The rooms were very nice. The had flat screens tvs, wooden floors and an extremely large double.(Enough for 4 people, if you like). The rooms had an Ikea feel about them as they were very modern and the use of wood. The shower was very powerful and hot water a was always available (even at 4am!). The door numbers are each at least a foot each on the door, so even the most drunk of people can find the right door number. lol Did not use the bar, but looked pleasant enough. For people going in the summer, the pool was quite small, but that;s to be expected from a roof top pool. The staff were friendly, they even delivered Ice to the rooms on request. The bar also has 2 computers offering free internet access. All in all a very pleasant stay and would not even consider looking anywhere else when i go back. A note regarding Barcelona:- Ramblas:- Pleasant enough but very touristy, hence expensive. Nights out:- Again expensive around 50 euros for a round of 3 barcadi and cokes and 3 malibu and cokes. The Catwalk is a very good clubat the Port Olyimpic. Clubs offer free entance before 1:30am, which is because nobody gets there till 2am!!! There is an area at Port Olyimpic,next to the casino, full of bars, which has a feel of your average bar street in say tenerife or falaraki. Make sure you do the tour bus, you need 2 days atleast. We managed to see Ronaldino leaving the Barca stadium. Anyway have fun...............i know i did. Ps The Ramblas did not feel unsafe on any occasion, contrary to what people may say. It's like walking around trafalgor square at night time.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody going to Barcelona on a short break or a business stay.

<Title>“As good as its reviews”
<Content>We booked the Hotel Jazz based on the reviews posted on the Trip Advisor site. The recommendations were entirely justified. On arrival at the hotel we upgraded to a junior suite - so we can't comment on the standard rooms. However, the quality of the suite was very high: fittings, furnishings, facilities, space and cleanliness were all of the highest order. The staff were warm, courteous and English speaking! The hotel is well positioned for exploring the central attractions of Barcelona. The lack of a restaurant at the hotel did not prove to be a disadvantage: there are so many good places to eat in the vicinity (ask at reception). A very positive experience.

<Title>“Great hotel”
<Content>The Jazz Hotel is very attractive and comfortable, with a helpful and friendly staff and rooftop pool and cool bar and restaurant. However, the even better part is the location. It is a short walk to Plaza Cataluna and Las Ramblas and is right above the Metro. The area is very busy at night, making it safe to walk alone. The room was quiet, clean, attractive, with a working in room safe (rare in Spain), hair dryer, flat screen TV, efficient heater, sliding glass doors for a breeze and free Internet access.

<Title>“Great Location & Great Deal”
<Content>My boyfriend & I stayed for 2 nights at the end of January. Unfortunately that weekend they had unexpected severe weather of torrential rain & temperatures of 3C & below! Luckily for us the Jazz Hotel was so nice that we didn't mind spending more time than we anticipated in the room. Contemporary but very comfortable with a huge bed & large marble bathroom. We agree with other reviews about the small bar & Metro rumblings - however I am an extremly light sleeper but wasn't disturbed (3rd floor). Greatly situated only 3 minute walk from Placa de Catalunya. We found the best deal by far on Hotels by Phone - and it included breakfast. The buffet style breakfast has a very good selection of hot & cold food - if not too busy they also cook you fresh eggs to order. We would definitely stay again.

<Title>“Great hotel, Fantastic Location”
<Content>My girlfriend and i spent 4 fantastic nights in Barcelona the week before christmas. We were on the fifth floor, where the traffic from the road below was still audible, but nothing that was going to keep you awake, this may become more of a factor if you are situated on a lower floor!! The room itself was perfect, lots of space to chill out in after a hard day walking around, only minor niggle was the bed was two singles pushed together, this said, the bathroom was spotless and the shower was fantastic. The staff were very helpful, and spoke good English, which was handy when my Spanish deserted me!! The Hotel was superbly situated just 5 minutes from Las Ramblas and within walking distance of most of the other attractions, La Sagrida Familia is just 20 mins walk away. If you need to go to somewhere further a field (Park Guell is a must!!), there is a subway just 100 yards down the road, meaning, everything is a piece of cake to get to!! All in all this is a great Hotel which i would not hesitate to recommend to anyone, and one which i fully hope to return to in the future. Thank you for making our trip complete Hotel Jazz!!!

<Title>“Fantastic stay”
<Content>Just returned from a 2night/3day stay at the fantastic Jazz hotel,Barcelona. Facilities excellant,staff extremly helpful nothing too much trouble. Rooms well decorated,modern and spotlessly clean. The buffet breakfast was more than sufficient plenty of choice including catering for special dietary needs. It is located in a good area less than 5mins walk from the airport bus at Placa Cantalunya and La Rambla. Would recommend Jazz Hotel for bussiness or leisure trip and certainly hope to stay there again.

<Title>“Not quite as good...”
<Content>As an enthusiastic user of members' recommendations, we were expecting great things of the Jazz Hotel. Sadly, it did not live up to the earlier rave reviews. It's a good hotel with lovely modern rooms, including a well designed bathroom. The hotel is ideally situated in the centre of the City, close to the Metro (which you can hear on the lower floors but it doesn't disturb your sleep). What let it down from a 5 star review was: 1. The fridge didn't work and it couldn't be fixed 2. The hot water system broke down on our final night so we couldn't shower before we left. The receptionist made no reference or an apology when we checked out. 3. The barman (in the very small but attractive bar) kept disappearing for over 10 minutes. This led to some other guests to help themselves! 4. Some receptionists were very helpful but others couldn't be bothered. Overall, I'd still recommend the hotel but, based on our 3 day stay, I'd say it doesn't deserve to be in the top 3.

<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Jazz earlier this month for 4 nights and had a great time. The hotel was in a great location, 2 minutes' walk from Placa de Catalunya and La Rambla - very central. The staff were very friendly and helpful - they were more than happy to make recommendations, book restaurants for us etc. Our room itself was very spacious and well designed and very well maintained. All in all, the hotel was lovely and I would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Highly recommended!!!”
<Content>An excellent hotel. Good location - only a 5 minute walk to the Rambla and Place Catalyuna. Room was spacious, clean, stylish - great bathroom and comfortable beds. Staff were friendly and helpful. The only thing I would say about the hotel that is in any way negative is that it doesn't have a proper restaurant and the bar is a little too small - however, given all the great restaurants and bars that are nearby this really isn't an issue. I would highly recommend the Jazz Hotel to anyone. The rooms are great and the area is safe. On a separate note and based on personal experience - PLEASE take care when walking around Barcelona - don't carry your passport around and beware of bag snatchers - I would suggest you take out only the cash you need with you, keep passports and anything else you don't need locked in the room safe. Ideally use a money belt and carry bags securely across your body, preferably under your coat. Whilst walking to the (excellent) Picasso Museum my mother was targeted by a bag snatcher - luckily he didn't get her bag but only because she yelled and yelled and I rushed to her assistance. Just be careful!!! Also beware the women selling carnations - do not get your purse out, be firm and just walk around them - do not let them stop you. Be firm and rude if necessary. But please don't be put off - just be very aware - Barcelona is a great city and there is plenty to do to have a great stay here. I would reiterate that the hotel itself is in a very safe area.

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel ! Especially for Shopping and Sightseeing !”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel just before Christmas and found it excellent. It was very clean and the rooms were really cool especially the bathrooms. We had no problems with noise so much so we kept sleeping in. It is great for shopping and sightseeing as you are so close by that you can drop back to the hotel throughout the day to freshen up or drop off any purchases you have made. The staff were very friendly and went to great effort to help us choose a restaurant despite out terrible lack of Spanish ! Also the hotel had free internet access which was a great help. In response to the complaint made by the Trip Advisor member from NY - not being able to drink the water is standard over most of Europe and the Hotel can't be blamed - also if you want to watch TV I wouldn't advise flying half way around the world to Barcelona to do it !

<Content>We stayed there for just 1 (short) night as we had to get the morning flight to Seville (no time for breakfast). The Jazz is a beautiful and very modern hotel just 5 min away from the Ramblas. Staff was efficient and very friendly. Only recommendation would be to ask for a room away from the busy street as street noises do filter in but this is a hotel I surely would return to!

<Title>“The Perfect Place”
<Content>This Hotel is ideally located just 2 minutes walk from Plaza Catalunya and the therefore the top of La Rambla, and central to all that Barcelona has to offer. In my opinion it is a 4* Hotel in the main, however the lack of a Restraunt outside of breakfast, Room Service available only until 22:30 and english speaking channels limited to BBC World News, CNN and Eurosport have limited it to 3*. That said the lack of food options means you get to explore the cities eateries and who would travel to a city and watch TV! We arrived at 11:00 am and there was a room available for us to check-in. Although it overlooked the inner 'courtyard' this may've been a blessing in disguise as the hotel is flanked by a couple of busy roads. The kingsize bed was heavenly, the room well decorated with wooden flooring, flat screen tv, mini bar and air con too. The bathroom was very stylish, clean and modern. I really couldn't find a fault with either the hotel or the staff and would go back there at a moments notice.

<Content>Stayed at Jazz over Christmas with my husband and 2 daughters. The hotel was perfect;clean and in a great location. Staff was polite and helpful. Barcelona was absolutly beautiful. We stayed for 6 days and couldn't see everything. One word of warning , don't let the taxi driver suggest your resterant. We did this and then let the waiter suggest our meal.400.00 euros later we felt we had been taken. Oh well,you live and learn. If I had a dollar for everytime one of my family members said, "I wish I was in Barcelona now" I would be a rich woman. Can't wait to return!

<Title>“New Years at Hotel Jazz”
<Content>Based on all the good reviews here, we decided to stay at Hotel Jazz for 5 nights to ring in the new year. We were not disappointed. The entire staff were nice and helpful in planning our new years eve dinner and in giving us directions to get around. Our room was always clean, the bed was so comfy that we had to force ourselves to get up, the one trouble I encountered on the first night was the shower - you have to make sure it is positioned right and facing downwards before turning it on - its a handheld and for some reason ours was facing straight at my face when I turned it on - just a little tip. As for the aforementioned metro rumblings - we were on the sixth floor and it was only a very slight sensation because I notice everything, but my partner never did. The very best part was the location! Everything was within walking distance - La Rambla; the shee-shee shops along Passeig de Gracia where you can also see Gaudi's Casa Battlo and La Pedrera - there's an H &M store as well (its a popular chain of clothing stores in Europe, in case some of you have never heard of it and may be getting it confused for something else); the mega mall Corte Ingles which has a grocery store in the basement for your bottled water needs and much more; Starbucks (though you can get a yummy cup of coffee anywhere in Barcelona); lots of apparel and shoe shops; and for anyone that's interested in booking a guided bus tour - the Julia Bus Terminal is directly across the street. This was an awesome surprise since I booked the tours online thinking we'd probably have to walk a bit or take a bus to get there, but nope - it was just a 30-second walk out of the hotel lobby! We took two guided half-day tours of Barcelona on different days - Morning Classical and Afternoon Artistic and they were both good. They have other tours to choose from as well, which you can book online or when you get there. Lots of places to eat - we loved D'or which is across the street and serves a good and inexpensive breakfast. Everything was just so convenient during our stay. The free internet was a huge plus too - they have two computers for guests to use at any time. It was a very memorable and relaxing vacation and we look forward to spending it there again.

<Title>“Great value”
<Content>I stayed 4 nights at the Jazz Hotel in December 2005. Before arriving there, I was a little skeptical and concerned that the positive reviews posted on this website were perhaps too generous. However, it turned out that the positive reviews were correct. The hotel's location is very convenient, close to Ramblas avenue and very close to a subway station. The rooms are very nice (modern style) and quiet. Also important for those who rent a car: the hotel has a garage and you can actually park your car right in front of the hotel in order to unload your luggage and check in, which is not always easy to do in Spain!

<Title>“Excellent hotel in exciting city”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz for five nights. We had a triple room--two beds pushed together for my husband and me and a sofabed in a separate sitting area for our daughter. The room was a huge corner room with lots of windows (and, a nice touch, blackout shades to keep the sun from waking us up too early). The decor is modern and sleek but still very comfortable. The bathroom was well equipped with a tub w/shower, a separate stall shower, bidet, hair dryer, and so on. My only problem with the bathroom was that the tub was almost too narrow to sit in, and I'm not an especially big person. We were on the 2nd floor, and the rumbling of the Metro bothered me a bit but not enough to change rooms over. My husband and daughter are sound sleepers and never noticed it. If you're a light sleeper, ask for a room higher up. There is a flat-screen TV with Spanish and German channels, plus BBC and Eurosports in English. One warning, especially if you're traveling with children of any age: late at night, several of the channels go to hard-core porn. The people at the front desk and the housekeeping staff were very accomodating (even to the point of recommending a hospital emergency room and telling the cab driver exactly where to take us--my husband had minor surgery and was fine). The hotel's location was perfect for us--walking distance to many restaurants and shopping and to some attractions, such as the Cathedral and the Picasso Museum. The Metro is right there, of course, so it's very easy to see the city from this location. All in all, a very good experience at the Jazz.

<Title>“Great hotel”
<Content>Great location, we walked to Las Ramblas. Friendly staff with good restaurant suggestions, helpful with directions. Clean & modern rooms, bed was comfortable. The hotel was quiet, didn't hear noise from the hallways. Had a non-smoking second floor room which was great. Couldn't hear the metro at all unless you listened real carefully, in which case you might hear a faint rumbling occasionally, but you wouldn't notice unless you were listening for it. Free internet was appreciated. The rooms were decent size for Europe. We had a window that opened up onto the courtyard which was nice for fresh air (no balcony.) The bathrooms were very modern. Only complaint was that the shower had half a door, its a decorative style, but the whole bathroom floor ends up getting soaked. Highly recommend this hotel, and would stay there again.

<Content>Have just spent 3 nights here 11-14 November and agree with all the good reviews. We found most of the staff very friendly and most helpful. The room had everything we required and was very clean and the king sized bed extremely comfortable. The location was great an easy walk to the Ramblas etc. We were on the second floor and yes there was a slight rumble from the metro but after a full days sightseeing we did not notice it. There was a slight problem with the shower on the first use - we nearly flooded the bathroom as it was a little tricky until the hose was correctly positioned, but this was a minor problem. Compared to many hotels I have stayed in I rate it pretty good and will definitely return and have already recommended it to friends.

<Title>“A Love/Hate Relationship”
<Content>We chose the Hotel Jazz for our October visit to Barcelona based on its location and the many great reviews on this site. The location was excellent, the room was modern and clean, the bed was good, and the reception staff friendly and helpful (except for one icy female staff member). But there were several serious problems. First, the water was undrinkable, full of chlorine. When we mentioned this, we were told that everyone in Barcelona drinks bottled water because it always tastes like chlorine. We had to drag 1 1/2 liter bottles of water from a market several blocks away. For the equivalent of 25 cents a bottle, a hotel of this caliber should provide it to guests. Second, the two English language TV channels both had terrible reception all during our five night stay. We were told that it was the fault of the satellite company, but when we moved to a hotel near the airport for the next two nights, the reception was just fine. Third, the Metro noise was very noticeable on the sixth floor. For a hotel costing about $225 a night including two breakfasts, plus over $26 a night for parking, these conditions are unacceptable.

Great location as discussed elsewhere, very clean and modern, excellent design work, obviously a lot of thought went into the hotel. The top floor pool area is great, always clean and towels provided for the (also very clean) showers up there. Linens changed every day, staff friendly and there English is much better than my Catalan. Would NOT hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone!! Also as mentioned elsewhere if you stay here, the staff over the road at the D'or cafe are very friendly and helpful, plus the food either morning or night is great...

The rooms are clean and modern. Free internet access was very convienent. We also enjoyed the roof top pool. Very nice to relax on the roof with a drink after a day of sight seeing. The staff was friendly and spoke excellent English. Overall, Hotel Jazz was a great value for the location and quality of the hotel. Seems more like a 4 star than it's current 3 rating.

<Title>“Choose the Jazz hotel, you won't be disappointed!”
<Content>We settled on the Jazz hotel after extensive research on TA and was more than happy with our choice. The hotel itself is very modern, flat TV and nice decor. The location is unbeatable, being so close to Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas, which means you could return to your room to drop off your shopping or for a short rest before heading off again. Las Ramblas is always buzzing with life with the kiosks on both sides, we stumbled acorss the Mercado de la Boqueria which is a fresh fruit and vegetables market and it was good fun exploring experience there. The cafe D' Or across the street was indeed what everyone had said on their reviews, good breakfast and lunch time Tapas and the waitress was very friendly and helpful. We travelled around Barcelona on the orange sight-seeing bus which is operated by a different company to the Red and Green line, it is called Barcelona Tours while the others are called Bus Touristic. We had found it to be extremely useful to travel to all the major attractions, but the only drawback is it has shorter operating hours to the Bus Touristic with the last bus being around 7pm departing from Placa Catalunya which means you could not really make the most of your travel pass to travel around the city later at night. The only reason we did not give full mark to the Jazz hotel was due to the disapponting service we had received from two of the female staff at the front desk, one was not particularly friendly and helpful when we enquired about the Flamingo dance booking while the other one stuffed up with our request for a taxi to the airport which made us to wait for more than 20 minutes. Other than the minor complaint above, the hotel itself is excellent in every other aspect and it would definitely be our choice again for our next visit to Barcelona.

<Content>Excellent modern hotel just off of Placa de Catalunya. Hotel staff were very helpful at getting taxis. They also allowed us to leave our baggage in their check area all day since our train didn't leave until 9 pm. The rooms were quite large with nice furnishings. The pictures on their website are very accurate (unlike other places I've stayed). The FREE Wifi was a nice added bonus. The only possible negative was that it was extremely warm in the hallway outside our room. I don't know if the rooms had a/c because we didn't need it. It was nice temperatures outside, but the hallways were very hot -- could be a problem in the hot months, but i don't know. I would highly recommend this hotel though.

<Content>Not to repeat what has already been deservedly said about Hotel Jazz, just wanted to add that we found the staff exceptionally helpful in providing service and assistance. Excellent location as well. Be sure to have the hotel address with you if you take a taxi as this hotel is not yet well known in the taxi circuit. b

<Title>“You'll love The Jazz”
<Content>Had booked this hotel on the strength of Trip Advisor reviews and were very pleased with our choice. It's location near to Placa Catalunya means it is easily accessible via the airport bus ( a half hour trip or so, depending on the time of day) and it is ideally placed for exploring this lovely city. Our second floor room was very modern and minimalist, with plenty of storage space, flat screen t.v. and an efficient air con system which made it pleasantly cool to return to after a day touring the sights. It's proximity to the metro also made it easy to get around if you got tired of walking ! We were aware of an occasional slight rumble (not noise) from the metro, but this didn't disturb us. The bathroom was reasonably sized, warm and well equipped, and the overall standard of housekeeping was very high. There were lovely views and space to relax on the roof terrace, though we didn't use the pool. Our deal included breakfast - good and plentiful with a wide range of dishes, including a selection for those on restricted or special diets. Alternatively, there are cafes close by if you prefer just a croissant and a coffee. Lots of upmarket shopping on Las Ramblas de Catalunya just a short walk to the north of the hotel, but didn't have enough time during our 4 day stay to fully explore the retail opportunities. What a pity - we'll have to return !!!

<Content>We have just returned from barcelona and spent 3 days there and you couldnt fault the jazz hotel. There was a party of 10 of us and we all said it was very clean the staff friendly and best of all the location was exellent. Yes you can hear the underground but it will not affect yor stay. We all said we would use this hotel again.

<Title>“A great hotel”
<Content>Returned yesterday after a 3 night stay with 6 friends. The hotels location is fantastic, only a couple of minutes stroll from the Ramblas. The interior really has the wow factor and we must have sounded like a bunch of giggly school girls upon arrival because we couldn't believe how great it was. I shared a triple room and we fully expected to find a 3rd bed had been squeezed into a double room, but we actually felt like we had a suite as it was so spacious. The swimming pool on the roof is a real bonus, and couldn't believe we were able to swim at sunset with a fantastic view included. We had breakfast on our last morning which was nice, but didn't think it was great value. Starbucks is about 1 minutes walk away and was ideal for us (and alot cheaper).Our only very minor complaints are that there were no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, and there were only 2 mirrors (not good for 3 girls when one is in the bathroom and one is on the bathroom door with hideous lighting). I have already looked at going back next year!

<Title>“Jazz is worth it!”
<Content>My wife & I stayed here Aug. 24th(one night) prior to a cruise and we were surprised by the cleanliness and quiet! We had read(here) so many reviews about the noise, less-than-desirable accommodations, bad locations, etc. that we were glad that we booked here. The staff was very helpful, but english is NOT their best talent, and the rooms are modern, clean, and well-furnished. The location is probably the best attribute for Jazz! Two short blocks from La Ramblas, plenty of eating establishments nearby, and two blocks from bus or subway transportation just can't be beat! The area around the hotel felt safe, and we never had any reason to feel threatened on either day(just use common sense). The buffet breakfast at the hotel($13us/pp) is worth every penny. We'll stay here again!

New design, King Size beds, well stocked mini bar. Clean light rooms. Staff really nice and friendly. Security on for any trouble. Breakfast set us up for the day. All in all a great stay at the Jazz Hotel.

<Title>“Fabulous hotel! Highly recommended!!!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Jazz Hotel for 2 nights Sept. 9-11, 2005. We couldn't have been more pleased....this hotel is wonderful! The location is perfect - so close to La Rambla and steps away from Placa Catalunya, which makes getting to and from the airport (by Aerobus or by train) very easy. We loved the ultra modern decor in the bedroom and bathroom. The rooftop terrace has a pool which is quite small but has a nice view. We loved this hotel and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona.

<Title>“A great place to stay!!”
<Content>The Jazz hotel was fantastic. My boyfriend and i stayed here for 5 nights which really wasn't long enough! We loved the pool on the roof of the hotel, really cold but when you have been exploring all day its a good way to cool down!! All staff were friendly and the cleaners were very good. I would recommend a breakfast or two at the jazz hotel...a good selection of cakes that the cook kept bringing out! Internet use was also very handy. As for location, this place is good. About 2 minutes from a metro station and also if you're looking to do a bit of shopping then stay at the Jazz!

The interior designer who made this hotel is a genius, rooms are really luxurious and better than in several 5 stars hotels I saw, breakfast is very good and, only hotel in Spain I found, they had a free computer in the lobby to connect to internet.

<Content>A beautiful, new & well-styled hotel. Quality linens & furniture, an attentive staff & close to Las Ramblas. (A selling point, I suppose, if you like shopping the equivalent of 34th street in Manhattan.) The small pool on the roof is great after a hot day of running around. Beware, breakfast IS NOT included and costs about $20.

<Title>“Clean, Fresh and Modern Hotel. Great Location!”
<Content>We stayed for 3 nights in September. When we booked, we requested a non-smoking twin room but was given a smoking room on the fourth floor. The stale smell was too overpowering so we complained. We then got given a non-smoking room on the second floor which the hotel staff kindly rearranged from a double to a twin. The hotel had recently been refurbished so everything felt clean and fresh. The only complaints we have are: 1. The shower screen was too small and the bathroom floor ended up getting quite wet. 2. We can hear the trains going pass even though we are on the second floor. Apart from the minor points above, we highly recommend this hotel. Location is superb!!!

<Title>“Perfect!”
<Content>This hotel is fantastic. Spent 1 week there (August 30 - September 6, 2005) and found our triple room modern, clean, comfortable and quiet. We were on the 4th floor (Room 406) and the only time I heard faint rumbling of the subway train was when I was in the bathroom, but nobody else in my party even noticed it (I asked them after we checked out). Desk staff are excellent, housekeeping superb and the food met all our needs (especially breakfast). Will stay here again on my next visit to Barcelona.

<Title>“Excellent, stylish and friendly”
<Content>Modern, stylish and friendly. Had read a review complaining of noise or rumble from the metro' underground. We were on the 7th floor so may have been protected from this. I listened out for it in the early hours and could make something out...but certainly not intrusive in any way. I hadn't told my girlfriend about this before-hand and when I later asked her if she had heard anything she had no idea of it. Room was large, immaculate and had small balcony overlooking the noisy busy road below (more of a Juliet balcony so no sitting out on it). Noise was never a problem from the road because of the excellent double glazing. Some noise in the morning from the maids (although this was later than 9am). Free internet (proper internet connection not the snail stuff) on two units near bar area. Didn't have to wait. Bar very smart and modern, in keeping with the rest of the hotel, although drinks were very expensive. Generally friendly staff (including discussion with guys on the desk about Barca' and Real Madrid on arrival). We had just come from Paris where the staff were formal and a little stuffy so the staff here made the difference. Rooftop pool small but didn't suffer because of it. Seperate pool towels provided and plenty of (comfortable) sun loungers. Excellent breakfast variety and open til 11am. Location right in the centre with Universitat and Placa Cataluna metro stations very close. We stayed first week september for two nights. Paid approx £100(sterling)per night.(girlfriend loved the plentiful freebies!) I couldn't really afford this for a longer stay, nor can I compare with other hotels in the area. However, compared with other european hotels this was refreshingly worth the money.

<Title>“Loved the hotel, loved the location, loved Barcelona”
<Content>Have just got back from a three day trip to Barcelona. I picked the Jazz based on the recommendations on Tripadvisor and was not disappointed. On arrival we were immediatley upgraded, free of charge, to a Junior Suite on the 2nd Floor. The room was fantastic, with a seperate living area and the biggest bed I have ever seen!!!! But the best thing about this hotel was the roof top pool and terrace. As temperatures were so high we spent the mornings visiting the attractions and the afternoons lounging around the pool which was a perfect way to end the day. We rarely heard any noise from the metro and when we did it was just a very faint rumble, certainly nothing to make us want to move up a floor. Because the Jazz is so central we were able to walk to most of the main attractions or alternativley catch taxis as they were so cheap and always available. Barcelona is a fantastic city and the Jazz is a perfect hotel to stay in for your trip!

<Title>“Better than I hoped”
<Content>Following weeks of research on the internet and reading many reviews on Tripadvisor, I chose the Hotel Jazz as it came highly recommended and featured in the top 10 on this website. And I was not disappointed. I followed the advice and asked for a room on the upper floors to avoid the underground noise. On the fifth floor you could hear one or the other train occasionally but it wasn't more than a slight rumble. As it was my partners 40th birthday, I had also asked for a special room and was given a suite instead of the booked double. The room was fabulous with a sleeping and a separate living area. Tasteful decorations allround and the biggest bed I have ever slept in. The bathroom was also a gem with a bath and a separate shower. Staff were helpful and very friendly and the location allows you to be right in the centre within minutes or in the quieter quarters when you walk the other way. I highly recommend this hotel to anybody who is going to visit this fantastic cultural beach city. Barcelona has it all.

<Title>“Brilliant Hotel, would highly recommend”
<Content>We choose this hotel mainly on the strength of the great reviews left by trip adviser users and weren’t disappointed. This hotel is excellent, all the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, when we arrived at the hotel four hours before the given check-in time they were very accommodating and made sure we were in our room within 30 minutes. The rooms are lovely, we were on the 7th floor at our request after we read on this website the problems with noise on some of the lower floors and we weren’t disturbed by it at all. The room itself did face a busy road but the windows shut out any road noise so that wasn't a problem. The rooms were extremely clean, plenty of space and very modern with flat screen TV, radio etc and decorated with lovely finishing touches. The bathroom wouldn't have looked out of place at a 5star hotel, it was extremely high quality with a great bath and powerful shower. The toiletries in the bathroom were much more than the standard, with razors, make-up removers, shoe shine etc, etc in additional to all the usual things, this coupled with the free safe, well stocked mini bar etc made this hotel a little extra special. The hotel and the rooms are exactly as they look in the pictures, if not better. The hotel the bar was nice, we had a few drinks in there, bar staff were friendly. We didn't eat in the restaurant but it looked very nice. The free internet access was also an added bonus as was the roof terrace pool. It was small but at the end of the day you are in the centre of Barcelona so any pool is a bonus. The Location of the hotel couldn't have been better, a couple of minutes walk from Playa de Catalunya, which is one of Barcelona main square's at the top of Las Ramblas. Perfect position for sight seeing. Las Ramblas is great, take time to have a drink there and watching the people go by and the mime artists - how those people stand so still is beyond me! Barcelona is a brilliant city with so many things to see an do - the Casades (get there early it gets so busy), marina, zoo, Gaudi Cathedral were all brilliant places to go and we tried to walk to most places to see all we could of Barcelona, which was tiring but worth it. Lots of lovely places to eat and drink, and the shops go on for ever. I would highly recommend both this hotel and Barcelona itself, we will defintely be going back again.

If i had to complain about any thing, it would be that we asked for a double room, and they tried to give us a twin, and said that i had not asked for one, i asked to see the confirmation form and it was definatley on there, i had to argue to get the right room, but that was only 1 employee.

<Title>“Hotel Jazz, better than expected.”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Jazz mid-august. The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from the Placa de Catalunya. We travelled to the hotel using the train from the airport, only 6,30 euros for a 10 journey ticket-excellent value. On arrival the staff were ok, not over friendly. We asked for a non-smoking room so were on the 2nd floor-no problems with noise at all. Our room was very clean and spacious. The bathroom was as good as we would expect from a 4 or 5 star hotel back home. Also surprised to find no charge made for use of the safety deposit box in the room. Mini-bar/fridge well stocked. Bar staff very pleasant and efficient. Roof top pool/terrace nice, always fresh towels although some of the sunbeds weren't in the best of conditions. Nice irish bar round the corner called Scobies and this was a better source of recommendations for restaurants etc than the hotel staff. Overall, we were very happy with this hotel and will hopefully be returning soon.

<Content>Stayed with my husband for 3 nights in this modern hotel. We stayed in the 2nd floor but the train station or traffic was not disturbing us at all. Rooms are very clean and personnel is helpful and nice. Breakfast was quite expensive (€ 14) but a variety of bread, fruits, juices, cheese, ham... was offered which makes it worth to have breakfast at the hotel. The hotel is only a few steps away from the placa Catalunya and the Ramblas the most famous avenue in Barcelona. It is very good situated and I would go back and stay there any time. Really good recommendation to stay in the centre of Barcelona. Enjoy!

<Title>“It was just Okay”
<Content>I stayed here with my boyfriend as part of our trip around London and Barcelona, mainly because of the number of raving reviews. First I stayed in room 314, and yes, we heard the rumbling and vibration of the underground train, which stopped around midnight. Try and get a higher floor. The bathroom was nice, new, sparkling and clean which was a plus, as I am a cleanfreak. We desperately needed a converter plug for charging our laptop and we continuously called and asked the front desk about one for the entire duration of our stay (3 days) and the answer each time was that they were all out. Each time we called it seemed as though someone just got one 20 minutes ago and we were out of luck. So be sure to bring your own adapters. We could have bought one from down the street but it just seemed like a waste since we were here for so little. The beds weren't as soft and comfortable as when we stayed near the ocean in the Arts Hotel (the first part of our trip), and the bedding was just sheets really. The soundproofing from outside the room was alright, we didn't hear much noise, except when a rally of protestors woke us up at 7am, but otherwise it's quiet. The pool closes pretty early, about 7 or 8pm, and so I can't say we got to enjoy it, because we spent most of the day out and about the city. Location-wise it is perfect, it's right by Las Ramblas and within walking distance of all stores and areas. While you are there, stop at Farggi's and have a gelato, it's really good. Don't expect someone to get your bags for you, and there is no concierge. The english-speaking front desk does most everything, but I guess I caught them in the wrong times because they weren't too friendly or polite. Overall the hotel is nice... yes it is all 'modern' but if you know anything about construction and materials you can see it's all cheap decor (doorframe is a plastic material), but if that crap doesn't matter to you it should be no problem. If the price is right then do it. All in all it was a pleasant and memorable stay, besides the little things mentioned above that was a bit annoying.

<Content>We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The room is quite spacy, modern and clean. The location is good enough to reach all tourist atractions. Staff are friendly, helpful and good. Just one thing, we chose this hotel for its roof top terrace and swimming pool. However, the roof top terrace and swimming pool is opened only from 10:00 to 20:00. We could not drink cava at the terrace in cool breeze late night or swim early in the morning. Also, the view from the terrace is so, so and quite noisy due to traffic down from main road. The hotel is worth to try and probably better than other hotels which are in the same price category. WHy they cannot open the terrace 24 hours?

<Title>“Jazz it up and stay here!”
<Content>We got back a few days ago after having spent 10 nights at Hotel Jazz. It was really wonderful! The rooms are spotless, very modern, the AC is so quiet you you can't hear it, the doors open to small balconies with a great view of the street (on our side) and the street is loud, but the glass is soundproof and when you close the door, it is totally quiet. The rumble from the train was no bother on the 5th floor at all. The pool was great, but we wished it stayed open later than 8, because the sunset occurs around 8:30, 9 and it would have been nice to swim up there and watch the sunset.. The staff was split for us. We found the male staff consistently freindly and helpful, and female staff to be curt at times and rude.. but we just learned to rely on the fellows and they are the ones on at night when we had most of our questions. We rented a car and drove up to the Dali museum in Figueres. If you do this, drive along the Costa Brava. It is incredible! And rent from Damacar. It's the company Hotel Jazz uses and the people there were really kind. Not too expensive either! We spent 57 Euros on a 24 hour, 350 km trip. The location of Jazz cannot be beat! It's around the block from so many great things to see and do, and the train is basically outside your doorstep! So the fact that the bartender was hard to track down was not the most important because you could get anything a few steps away. There is a liquor store on the street that D'Or is on one block away and you can buy a six pack of Estrella Damm Beer for 3 Euros and keep it in your fridge, ratehr then spending 3 Euros for one at the hotel. We miss it so much and definitely plan to come back in the future!

<Title>“Loved the location, price and all that Jazz!”
<Content>I spent three nights at the Hotel Jazz in April and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. It has a wonderful location just off Playa Catalunya, less than a 5 minute walk to Las Ramblas and about 2 minutes to the nearest metro station. Considering it’s proximity to the tourist hub of Barcelona, the Jazz remained a quiet and peaceful place to retreat to after a long days sight-seeing and even though our room was on the second floor we hardly noticed the noise from the metro. The hotel is modern and the rooms are spacious for a city-centre hotel and have good facilities like a hair dryer, flat screen television and in-room safe. The bathroom was well stocked and had an excellent power shower. The roof pool was a nice feature with a number of sun beds and pool towels provided. The staff were always very friendly and helpful with the checking in/out and luggage arrangements. We booked through Expedia and got a good price for the hotel and BA flights. Overall an excellent value for money hotel with a location that cannot be faulted.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay - Great Value”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Jazz during the final leg of a 2.5 week trip to Spain and France. We paid about 110 Euro for a standard room. Based on previous posts we requested and got a higher floor room on the 6th floor. The front desk was very accomodating given our unexpected late arrival due to a delayed flight from France. One drawback was that they were unable to provide a luggage cart for our 6 bags, so we ended up taking two trips up and down to get everything into the room. We heard very little street noise and definitely no impact from the rumbling of the metro that we read about. We did hear quite a bit of noise from the hallway, but it was quiet at night. Also, the curtains in the room are incredible. They blocked almost all the light!! The room was very nice, we did have a king bed, which was actually two twins pushed together. I would rate this just ok. The bed was adequate, we could sleep, but nothing to rave about. We took advantage of the wireless Internet. It was very very easy to use and very helpful to us. Also English speaking news stations were great, particularly CNBC Europe. The bathroom was fantastic. Fresh towels and toiletries every day, which was great. Toiletries were great, razor kit (husband forgot to pack a razor), toothbrush, sewing kit, shampoos, soaps, etc. The rooftop pool is smaller, but wonderful. A great way to start the day with relaxation or to unwind after a long day. It was crowded sometimes, but we always managed to get a chair. Also, the tables were great, we bought sandwiches a few days and just ate them up there, which was nice. The hotel location is awesome, very centralized and easy to get just about anywhere in the city. We had lunch one day at d'Or across the street. It was great. Also, I don't speak Spanish at all and thrive on coffee, so was pleased to find a nearby Starbucks.....I know I know, but it was good for me. The front desk was not good with recommendations for where to buy some bottled water, etc. but we found the Champions grocery on the rambla which was a great solution for water and wine to keep in the room. They were very helpful though in making reservations at local restaurants we wanted to try and navigating the metro. They also gave some interesting recommendations for walks around the city that were not on the map. I definitely recommend going to dinner one night at La Venta in the Tibidabo area of the city. We ate upstairs, where you will need reservations, but the service, food, and view were outstanding!!

<Content>What a great little hotel, nothing to complain about except... a smell in the bathroom, resembling a sewer towards the latter part of the morning!! i think this is a generic problem rather than a specific problem with the hotel. The hotel was great so do not let the smell deter you, the service was excellent, the pool was a pleasure in the heat and the location was superb. Have been back 10 days and recomended it already, would go back for sure

<Content>We stayed here for two nights last week (August), with our daughter and her friend. We had two standard rooms on the sixth floor (thanks to previous reviewers I asked to be high up). Regarding the hotel's style and location, I agree with previous reviews - excellent, perfect position, tasteful, clean, modern etc, great to have the rooftop pool area, free internet access and English language news channels. Regarding metro noise, we noticed the rumbling when sitting in the bar on the first floor - it didn't seem particularly intrusive but then I wasn't trying to sleep so maybe it would be different if it was your room ... certainly we couldn't hear anything when we were up on the sixth. The bar is a stylish place for a drink,but the barman appears to have several other responsibilities, so you can wait a long time for him to appear. He is friendly and helpful when he's there but that's hardly the point. Apart from the bar the staff were very efficient and helpful regarding rooms, luggage etc. - but a request for a restaurant recommendation from the front desk turned out disastrously. I think a previous reviewer suggested that the staff probably wouldn't be a great information resource and I would agree. We tried Cafe d'Or opposite the hotel (recommended in several previous reviews) and it's lovely and friendly. Also good, for tapas, is Celler de Tapas (I think that's what it was called) just around the corner on the Pl. Universitat. Barcelona is a beautiful city and this is a very stylish and well-located place to stay - but don't rely on the staff for local advice, take a good up-to-date guidebook instead!

<Title>“Great Hotel - Great Location - Good Value”
<Content>After reading reviews here I stayed at the Hotel Jazz on a family 5 day break at the start of August. The Hotel is in a prime location, 3 mins walk from Las Ramblas, It is in a quiet location. Staff were helpfull and replied to my emails prior to departure, very prompt check in. There are security guards that are always on the entrance and a safety deposit boxes in the rooms. The Hotel is modern, and has excellent facilities. Rooms were cleaned and striped every day (although sometimes not until after lunch). The bathroom was all modern and spotless. Our room was on the second floor and had a mini juliet balcony, which was nice, the air con worked well, the room was always cool. There was some slight noise from the rumble of the subway, but it was nothing more that the sound of faint rumble about every 20mins. Hardly noticed it, and after being in bars near the hotel it seems to be a common occurance, so dont be put off by that. The pool was an excellent extra and should be the main attraction. After a day out sight seeing there was nothing better than to get back to the hotel at about 5:00pm and sit by the pool till 8:00pm. There are sun beds and they provide towels around the pool (added bonus). The slight downside to the hotel is that the bar closed at 11:00pm so you couldn't get a night-cap when coming back later, but apart from that it was excellent. It is just like the photos on the website. Highly recommended.

<Title>“As good as the hype”
<Content>Just returned after 5 days at the Jazz and it was as good as we expected. Ths staff were polite and helpful, the room was very good, excellent air-con. The roof-top pool was very welcoming after a hard days sight-seeing and the breakfast was plentiful. We did notice the noise from the metro when we were in the restaurant on the first floor so I would advise requesting an upper floor. No real down side and I would certainly stay there again.

<Title>“Loved it”
<Content>Can't believe that this hotel is only at No. 6 in the ratings. it's one of the best hotels I've stayed in - deserves more than a 3 star rating. All the previous reviews have said it all really - but all I can add is that it's certainly somewhere that I wouldn't hesitate to return to. That's as good a review you could give! Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Planning the return journey as we speak!

<Title>“Better than the name!”
<Content>Walking down the street adjacent to the hotel I was a little unsure of what Hotel Jazz would be like. The name hardly gives it away! - But to my surprise, it was a really contemporary hotel in a brilliant location. Not too close to Las Ramblas (and the tourists) but still only 5 mins walk away. Close to Modern art gallery and all the swanky shops too. We stayed in a lovely room with plasma TV's, marble bathroom and comfy bed. Staff listened politely to my Spanish and spoke English when necessary. Brilliant hotel. Highly reccommend it.

<Title>“Fantastic location, good hotel”
<Content>Stayed in the Jazz Hotel for 3 nights in July, this is my 2nd time in Barcelona and I must say the location is excellent. Its right in the heart of the city and 5 min walk to the metro(Catalunya station) and nearby to Ramblas. The hotel was a wee bit hard to find as the its main entrance is not on the main road and you have to keep an eye out for it!(well I must say i arrived quite late and i was dead tired). Staff was friendly and accomodating, requested a room on the higher floor and they were more than happy to give me one(perhaps the hotel wasnt full). The room(6th floor) Fair sized room with ample space, has got a LCD TV, in-built radio and room safe. The decor was nice, nothing spectacular but for a 3 star hotel its superb! Bathroom was good as well, good shower and huge mirror. Service was good but only gripe was there was no ironing board/iron available and you had to get housekeeping to do it for you for a princely sum of 4euros per item! Its nice and quiet, didnt really notice the metro rumble till my last day, and only when i was in the bathroom. The pool is tiny! i never had the chance to swim in it but it looks much bigger in photos but a guesstimate would put it at approx 4m by 2.5m(being generous here) Comparing this to the Vincci Maritimo Barcelona which i stayed in previously, i still prefer it to the Jazz as the hotel room was much larger and bathroom was much better shame about its location though. Cant comment on the food but breakfast was priced at 13euros though. I suggest grabbing a bite elsewhere for breakfast! All in all this a great hotel to stay in, especially because of its location!

<Title>“Great location, modern hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the Jazz hotel in June for 3 nights after reading the great reviews on trip advisor. The hotel is in a great location near the place de Catalyna at the top end of La Rambla. We were on the 7th floor and could hear very faint sounds of the metro below now and again but this did not disturb us at all. The beds were very comfortable (two singles in a frame) the room large, clean and trendy with a flat scrren TV and air conditioning. The bathroom had with a large mirror and marble effect tiles and sink. Our rate included breakfast which was a continental with good selection including cereals, toast, cakes, cheese, meat, rolls, pastries, fruit juices and COLD sausages, mushrooms and tomatoes. We were able to order eggs to be cooked however not at the weekend. All in all we had a great stay in a great location with great breakfast. We did not use the pool or sun deck but both looked in good condition.

Rooms are clean and tidy with all mod cons - nice bathroom with poweful shower, good air conditioning and very large double bed. The rumble from the underground was noticeable, but a bit like the rumble of thunder, certainly not obtrusive or disruptive. Overall an excellent hotel.

<Title>“Fantastic Place to Explore Barcelona”
<Content>We spent the first week of our honeymoon at the Hotel Jazz and we had a fantastic experience. The location is perfect - between the touristy hot spots and the neighborhoods of Barcelona. We stayed in a "Junior Suite," which had a nice living area. Also, we were in a corner room, which had views out of two walls. It looks like all the rooms have the mini balconies - sliding doors and railings, but not big enough for anything more than leaning out on. The staff was not overly friendly - we didn't really rely on them and they let us go about our business. I wouldn't say they would be a great resource. The actual pool on the roof was quite small, but seemed commessurate with the other hotel pools we saw in the city. However, the rooftop deck was great - great views and plenty of chairs for laying out in the sun. During the week it was deserted but on the weekend there were a fair amount of people there. All in all - stay at the Hotel Jazz if you get a chance.

<Title>“Very good location”
<Content>12th July - Just returned from a five night stay at Hotel Jazz, Barcelona, and were more than pleased with our choice, having picked it after seeing reviews on trip advisor. Barcelona is a lovely city with plenty to see and do. The hotel was a two minute walk from the Ramblas and the excellent eating places. The orange turistic bus stop was across the road from the hotel, so we got picked up there and dropped off there too. The hotel was very clean, bedlinen and towels were changed daily. Spacious rooms and very good airconditioning. Staff were very helpful. Definitely recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Modern, Good Location, Excellent Staff”
<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Jazz in the middle of June of this year and had absolutely no complaints. We got an inside room so found it very quite but consequently without a view. The rooms were spacious, very modern and clean. The roof top pool was a very nice place to relax for an hour or two. Staff had excellent English and were very helpful in ordering taxi and providing directions. Location-wise it was ideal - a 5 minute stroll to Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. It was close to shops, bars and restaurants. I’d have no hesitation in recommending.

<Title>“Fantastic”
<Content>We chose this hotel after reading the reviews here - and we weren't disappointed. Our superior room was exactly as the pictures on the website. It was spotlessly clean and very chic. The terrace pool was great for an hour or so chill out and to catch the last of the sun at the end of a long day sightseeing. The staff were friendly and helpful and spoke fluent English. We didn't eat dinner there - but the breakfasts were good. Finally the location was perfect - we were offered a room overlooking the patio which was on the inside of the hotel and lovely and quiet. Leaving the hotel we were a two minute walk from Catalunya Square and the start of the Ramblas. We couldn't have asked for a better hotel and definitely recommend it. Next time we go to Barcelona this will be our first choice.

<Title>“What a deal!”
<Content>This was the most modern and largest room of our 25 day tour of the Med from Spain to Turkey. Certainly the best deal at only 100 euro + tax! I believe we might have hit a special, but I still would have paid more if I knew just how nice and clean this room and hotel really was. Great location and only a very short walk to the main square and La Rambla. Free internet access was a great touch and well appreciated. Staff was helpful and kind and did not have an attitude as I had previously read. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Barcelona.

<Title>“Good hotel, but don't mix business with pleasure”
<Content>My husband and I stayed 3 nights in a Jr. Suite. The room itself (fifth floor, 506) was very cool...very modern and stylish. Since it was a corner room, lots of windows with views onto the busy streets of Barcelona. Excellent bathroom (seperate shower & tub, towel warmer, etc) and the two flat screen TV's were a nice touch (if a bit small). My husband was disappointed with the business services. The wi-fi in the room didn't work, and the staff was totally clueless when we asked for assistance. There were only 2 computers in the biz center, and they were always being used. My only complaint is that the hotel is built right over the underground subway, and even on the 5th floor we heard some rumblings. And of course, being in a big city, the noise from the traffic outside is unavoidable Overall, a cool, chic hotel in the middle of the city for a reasonable price. Just don't try to get any work done :)

<Title>“Fantastic hotel....Fantastic city!”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here for our 20th Wedding Anniversary. The hotel had organised for flowers in the room and champagne as soon as we arrived. (This was at my request). The room we were given was fantastic as it had a bedroom and sitting area with a plasma tv in each area as well as a huge kingsize bed! The hotel is just off Las Ramblas and is in an ideal poisition to explore Barcelona, which has everything. At the end of our 3 night stay we were very satisfied and would definitely return! The only slight downside (as we got up late) the cooked breakfast was cold, but, once we realised this (and at our request) the kitchen cooked fresh on the 2nd and 3rd mornings... We returned home with plenty to talk about including room 606!!!

<Content>I stayed in Hotel Jazz for two nights at the end of May and found no faults whatsoever. The staff were extremely helpful, helping out with a tricky request in advance of our arrival, and the hotel itself is very elegant, and in a great location for those on a short break. The room was very comfortable and quite spacious, full of nice bells and whistles, with the bed a full seven feet wide, while the roof-top pool and deck provided a perfect place to unwind in the warm evenings. A great hotel at a good price. Enjoy!

<Title>“Terrific Location, Wonderful Staff”
<Content>Our adventure started out at the Hotel Jazz in Barcelona and I must say it was the beginning of a great first time trip to Europe. We were a group of twelve to stay at the Jazz and for several months I had been in touch with the staff making arrangements emailing back and forth. They responded to my requests quickly and efficiently, even helping me arrange a car service from the airport to the Hotel. I had never been to Europe and didn’t know what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms were modern very nice, comfortable and clean as was the buffet breakfast. On Saturday night the soccer team won a championship and there was a major parade that started at 12:30am and lasted until 3:30am. Good example of how good the soundproofing is - people were screaming - fireworks - drums, etc., and despite it being only 1 floor beneath us we only heard the muffled booms of the fireworks. When we opened the balcony doors it was incredibly loud and fun to watch. We were at the hotel the same night the as the previous Philadelphia, PA reviewer. They are absolutely right about the sound proofing. We were also on the second floor overlooking the start of Las Ramblas when the party started. The hotel staff was knowledgeable and very helpful. Though the language might have been a difficultly it was not. The staff did their best to communicate with us and succeeded beautifully. Acknowledging us each time we entered or left on our excursions to the streets was a very nice person touch. When asked, they suggested places to visit, things to do or made dinner and show reservations for us and their suggestions were right on. Each time I asked where was this place or that place they pulled out the map and gave us excellent directions. The location was just down the street from Las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya, a short walk with plenty of shops along the way. Great Location! While in Barcelona don’t miss taking the Bus Turistica on a tour of the city. Pick up a two day ticket at Placa Catalunya; see the Segrada Family Cathedral and all the other wonderful sites of Barcelona. Overall it was a spectacular stay. I must say that my experience was an excellent one and I would not hesitate to stay at the Hotel Jazz again or recommend it to anyone. We also loved it!

It is always clean and the room service is very good.It was hard to leave but great to go back to after seeing the spectacular sites.The bar area is nice and has computers with internet you can use.it has a great view from the roof and a swimming pool which unfortunatly we didnt have time for but it looked very inviting.The best bit would be walking inside Hotel Jazz while people are watching and you can show off by walking into a hotel fit for the queen.But we heard that if you are staying on the bottom 4 floors you can feel the underground trains going underneath but we were on the higher floors so we did not experience that.I know that if you go there you'll love and have a great time.:)

<Content>Stayed in the Hotel Jazz for two nights in April on a weekend break. Having booked on the internet and seeing photos my expectations were high and I was worried we were going to be disappointed when we arrived. I need not have worried, the hotel was amazing! Situated about a two minute walk from La Rambla, it was central to most things. The hotel itself was immaculate and had a feeling of relaxation as soon as you walked in. The hotel staff were extremely helpful with providing directions to tourist attractions and advice on where to eat etc. If I was to visit Barcelona again I would definately re-book this hotel.

<Title>“Beware the unnecessary music!”
<Content>The best thing about this hotel is that it is all so new (assuming you're not into 'character' of course!). Everything works and is clean and modern. The beds are large and comfortable, the sheets and towels are still bright white, there is no noise transmitted through the walls from other rooms, and the showers have plenty of water pressure. I asked for a quiet room on a high floor after reading comments about the underground and they obliged - top floor facing inwards (not onto the busy street). You could (believe it or not!) actually still hear the trains on the 7th floor, but it wasn't that obtrusive. It could well depend on which side ofthe hotel your room is. However, the first 2 nights we were there I had to put up with incredibly irritating piped music coming from somewhere, stopping in the very early hours (about 3am) and starting again at about 6am! I thought it was coming from a nearby apartment block or bar (and so nothing could be done), until on the last night I discovered that it was the music the hotel plays around the rooftop pool, continuously and for about 20 hours a day!!! On our last night I phoned down to reception when we got back to our room (about midnight) and asked them to switch it off, which they did within 30 seconds. I can't really fault them for that. And, for once, it didn't resume in the morning. So when your lying in bed at 1am unable to sleep because there's an irritating musical hum coming from nowhere, try the pool!

<Title>“It`s a cracker”
<Content>Having just returned from Barcelona and the Hotel Jazz (19/4/05), I can only go along with the other reviewers comments. I arranged a trip to Barcelona for five couples, all friends, the hotel lived upto all expectations, Very modern, lovely rooms well furnished, LCD tv and a super bathroom, free safety deposit boxes and plenty of wardrobe space. Rooms have patio doors but no balcony, just railings, so you can open the doors and savor the sounds and smells from the street below. Go out of the hotel turn left and across the road is a bar, not as narrow as it looks for it opens up at the back. Food and drinks very reasonable. Hotel staff were ok. Breakfast was expensive at 13euros plus tax per person, best go out, some nice places do breakfast, orange juice,bacon sandwich and a coffee or tea for 3.20 euros. But as for the hotel, for a 3star its worth 4+ stars of anyones money.

The rooms were fantastic, we were upgraded to a suite - 2 beds, sofa bed, 2 flat screen tv's, walk in shower and bath with shower. There was a safe in each room and also a reasonbaly priced mini bar which we used to store our own drinks. There is a really nice decked rooftop pool area, we had a hot day and all the subeds were taken very quickly but there are plenty of tables and chairs to use. Hotel staff were very helpful, recommending excellent restaurants. Only draw back, like most European hotels, there was no hot drink facilities in the rooms but other than that 100% recommendation on stlye, quality and service.

<Title>“Fantastic hotel, unknowledgeable staff”
<Content>We just came back from a week in Spain, staying 3 nights at the Jazz Hotel after reading the reviews here. The hotel is fantastic. Great location, a few minutes walk from Placa de Catalunya where you can either head down Las Ramblas or head up Paseig de Gracia. Rooms were beautiful, chocolate brown walls, wooden floors, state of the art bathroom. If you can get a reasonable price for this hotel, then definitely book it. The staff were not that great though. They were unable to answer most of my questions. When I asked if they knew where a certain street was, they just shrugged and pushed a map in front of me. It turns out the street was only 2 blocks away. Don't rely on them for dining recommendations - best to go explore for yourself, there are lots of good restaurants nearby. We would definitely stay here again -but make sure you ask for a high floor, as even on the 5th floor you can still hear the rumble of the metro below. Also, before we went I was rather concerned about safety, but we encountered no problems at all.. we kept our money in our front pockets, only took what we needed and kept an eye on our surroundings at all times. You will see plenty of tourists there who take no precautions and will be much easier targets for the crooks. So go enjoy, Barcelona is an amazing city.

<Title>“Great Service from a super hotel”
<Content>Picked the Jazz from the recommendations on this site and stayed 3 nights from the 15th March. Given the previous comments I emailed the Jazz prior to our arrival requesting a room above the 4th floor. We we got their we were pleasantly surprised to be told that due to our email we were being allocated a junior suite on the 6th floor at no extra cost. The suite was fantastic with an enormous bed, lounge area, two LCD TVs and a big bathroom with seperate bath and shower. The Jazz is ideally situated close to the centre of Barcelona minutes away from the top of Las Rambla and the Placa De Catalunya where the airport Aerobus drops and collects you. We never used the bar or restaurant in the hotel so can't comment, but they looked ok. I think because just stepping out the door you found dozens of bars and restaurants the Jazz facilities are rarely used. Step out the Jazz and turn left and in front of you is the bar D'or which is great and is open long hours, but just one word of warning, if they offer you a large beer decline, or you will get an enormous glass containing approx 1.2 lit. You have to be very thirsty to finish it !

<Title>“Fantastic Location”
<Content>The hotel is perfectly located for all the tourist attractions. A few minutes walk from the main street, las ramblas but no street noise. Lots of little cafes and bars located near by. I didn't eat in the hotel and found a fantastic place for breakfast just round the corner. Rooms are very modern and spacious with an enormous bed, lcd TV and tasteful decor. Very sleek bathroom and power shower Staff were always helpful and the bar is a good place to chill out. I was on the 6th floor and there was a distant rumble of the metro. it didn't disturb me at all

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel”
<Content>This hotel is in an excellent location and is very modern and stylish. The double beds are absolutely huge and very comfortable. The bathrooms are very sleek, modern and immaculate. For those of you who know of the Hotel du Vin chain, this is quite similar in its minimalist modern style. The rooms have plasma television screens with a good range of satellite channels. Breakfast has a good selection of colds meats, cheeses, fruits, cereals, many types of bread, rolls, croissants etc. The Jazz bar is very funky. I am writing this review from one of the free internet stations in the Jazz Bar. You can even print things out free of charge. With regard to the noise that others have mentioned. We are on the seventh floor. You *can* hear a slight rumble, but it is not really intrusive and certainly did not prevent us from having a good nights sleep. However, I can imagine that if you were on a lower floor possibly you may hear the noise more. To get past this, ask for a room on the seventh floor! The staff are very friendly and professional. I would say this is a very underrated hotel. The quality suggests a higher rating than the 3 stars it has been given. I would definitely come to stay here again.

<Title>“Good, but a caution...”
<Content>I like the modern decor, and the location is excellent. The roof-top swimming pool is a priceless option on a hot summer day. Friendly staff. Unimpressive breakfast and zero atmosphere in the adjoining lobby area, but so what. The construction quality is rather shoddy, and the rooms can show obvious signs of damage (big patch in bathtub, wall lamp partly pulled out) after just one year of operation. The first time I stayed there just after the hotel opened, we were on an upper floor and had no problems with noise, though one could hear muffled street sounds in the background. The second (and probably last) time I stayed there, I was on the second (lowest) floor, and the metro was hugely bothersome and impossible to ignore. I could feel the vibrations in the walls!! I can confirm, the Barcelona metro stops just after midnight and starts at 5:30 am. Stay at this hotel. But get a room above the fourth floor!!

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel for two nights and can honestly say you couldn't get a better location. The decor and room standard of the hotel was very good but the downside was that we had to wait 4.5hrs for our room with no offer of an upgrade or any compensatory drinks. That put a damper on the trip and think that if they improve the service it will be a great hotel for anyone visiting Barcelona.

<Title>“Excellent hotel!”
<Content>Hi, I just came back from a short trip to Barcelona and we stayed in the Jazz Hotel. It is a very nice hotel, very trendy. The people at the reception were nice, I asked for a room on the top floor because I had read some reviews and it mentioned the noise sometimes. The receptionist immediately called the cleaning personnel and they arranged a room for us on the 7th floor, the highest you can get! The room was really fantastic, a huge bed, flatscreen tv, a fully equiped bathroom (Bath, toilet, bidet, towel warmer, shampoo, soap, shower gel, a comb, tissues, razor, toothbrush, toothpaste,...). No noise, only in the far far distance, you could hear some cars and sometimes the metro. I can imagine that it would be disturbing if you were sleeping on the 1st floor. We did not try the breakfast. The swimming pool was empty, which is quite normal in february. The weather was really nice though, but 15 degrees is a little bit too cold to go for a swim outside! The hotel is very well situated! A 3 minute walk to Plaza Cataluña, which is really the place to be if you are a tourist! 0.5 minute walk to Plaza Universitat, 4 minute walk to Las Ramblas! I think the best thing to do is to take the bus A1 to Plaza Cataluña at the airport and step off at Plaza Universitat, which I think is the 3rd stop. It takes about 20 minutes to get to Plaza Universitat. It's 3,60 € per person. We took a taxi to get back to the airport, which takes about 10 minutes and it was 17 €, which is not bad either. Tip: on Plaza Cataluña, you can find the biggest information center in Barcelona, it is under the Plaza Cataluña. There are 3 types of tour busses that you can take: * red bus: drives you through the north of Barcelona, with several stops at the most important things to see. * blue bus: this one takes you through the south of Barcelona both are 16 € per person/day * orange bus: we took this one and it was really great, it takes you to the most important places to see in the entire city (so both north and south), they give you a free pair of headsets so that you can listen to some historical information in the language of your choise. This one was 17 € per day/person and I would really recommend this one. Nobody seemed to have noticed that for only 1 € more, this bus takes you to both north and south, as there was a long queue for the red and blue busses and no queue for the orange one. You can hop on and hop off wherever you want, whenever you want (the bus comes every 20 minutes). Be prepared that Barcelona is quite an expensive city and the people of Barcelona don't seem to be able to speak english. If you speak english, they answer in spanish and quite rude. But as soon as you start speaking spanish, they are lovely. Have a nice stay in Barcelona!

<Title>“Brilliant”
<Content>We stayed for two nights in the Hotel Jazz, our room was not ready when we arrived so we were immediately upgraded to a suite, fantastic! The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful, the room was spotless and we had no problem with noise of the metro. Best of all the location, 2mins from Las Ramblas, perfect, would definately stay here again.

<Title>“Excellent”
<Content>Having been to Barcelona before and stayed in a 4 star hotel, I would say this is 10 times better. Stayed here for a 5 days from the 9th Feb and we were very impressed, it was a very clean, stylish hotel. The rooms were very modern and spacious. The location was excellent, a few minutes walk from La Ramblas, very near shops, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. The staff were very helpful and polite. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone, and we will definately be going back!!

<Title>“Great Place, Great Location”
<Content>Well, where to start? Firstly the check in went smoothly as expected, staff friendly and helpful. Decor stunning, made our way up to the room and found it to be very clean and with some of the nicest decor I've ever seen! Don't worry too much about the noise of the underground, although you are aware of it during the day it makes little or no difference to your sleep. You are slap bang in the heart of the city of course some noise can be expected. Again the location is the biggest selling point of this hotel, 2mins walk from Las Ramblas, but plenty of shopping en route. I would deffo stay here again, with out a doubt.

<Title>“Great!!!!!!”
<Content>What a find! The Hotel Jazz in Barcelona is perfect, great location,great decor, great staff, lots of extras in the batthroom like shower gels , razor, toothbrue,shoe-shine-excellent. Staff are very friendly and you never had to to wait around for your room to be cleaned. Very quiet, no problem with noise from Metro, we had a beautiful room on the seventh floor, our friends on the sixth and they had no problem with noise. The hotel is literally three minutes from the Ramblas and Square Castaluyna. The airport bus drops of in the square,cost 3.45 euro, very good value. try the D,or opposite the hotel for excellent coffee, pastries for breakfast and very good bar food at great prices, for a city the prices are brilliant, great Chinese restaurant to the left of the hotel- meal for five cost 45 euro and that included 2 bottles of wine. The bus tour of the city also great value and an excellent way to see the city and decide exactly what areas you would like to visit. Have a great time and enjoy the Jazz, you will not be disappointed.

<Title>“First Class”
<Content>Top class contemporary hotel...would recommend it to anybody. Stayed here for four nights in late January....perfect location, and the rooms are just really cool. LCD TV's, big bathrooms, can't wait to go back. Only rated 3 star because it doesn't have a restaurant....they serve breakfast for an additional 13 euros which we didn't have because there are plenty of other places around the area. Not your choice if you need Butlers and all that, but if like me you want a top value for money, smart hotel, centrally located, you ain't gonna do better than this. Looks like a great pool on the roof too, although bit cold to use it in Jan.

Staff very friendly. Breakfast not so good. Only isue with noise was that we were above the restauraannt. Go for higher floors!

<Title>“Excellent Hotel”
<Content>Before we stayed here, I read all the reviews posted and decided that the best bet was to ask for a room on a higher floor to avoid the noise form underground trains. When we arrived we were given a room on the 7th floor anyway so no need to ask. Sitting in the bar on 2nd floor the noise from the trains was evident, but not overpowering. Ask for a room on a higher floor but don't worry if you don't get it. Other reviews mentioned the street noise, as far as I could see all the rooms had windows that opened into a central courtyard. With the window open you can hear the street noise even on the 7th floor. However close the window and it was completely silent. All rooms have Air con so there is no need to have the window open. Right thats the practicalities out of the way. The hotel it's self was very central and really well presented. The style is contemporary but not minimalist. The beds were huge and very comfortable. I have stayed in many mid range hotels in cities, and for the rate this has to be the best. Do yourself a favour and stop looking for a hotel in Barcelona, you have just found it!!!!

<Title>“Great price, great space”
<Content>I stayed here with my daughter 12/24/04-1/1/05. We had a room on the 7th (top) floor, so the subway noise was not noticeable, kind of a low rumble like a truck passing every once in a while, and you had to really listen for it. The room was spacious (by European standards) and modern, with a flat-screen tv and free Internet (both wired and wireless) in the room. The closet was large and had lots of drawers. There were also two free Internet stations with a printer near the bar on the 1st floor. There's a nice terrace and small pool on the roof, and the pool was filled and open (though not heated) and looked pretty inviting even though it was December. The address is a block and a half NW from the Placa and the Ramblas, you couldn't ask for a better location. The breakfast was basic and overpriced (what hotel buffet isn't?), but convenient. I though the staff was helpful and well-informed. The price was right too, 100 Euro for two people for most nights, 180 Euro for the New Year's Eve weekend nights, puchased directly from their web site.
