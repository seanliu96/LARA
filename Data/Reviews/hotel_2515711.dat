<Title>“Very dissappointing”
<Content>The location is ok. For $196 a night I expected more. The ugly: $22 to self park in a dirt lot $15 buffalo nuggets at the bar that made Mc'Ds look good 2 inch gap under the joining room door which allowed noise and smoke to enter our room No refrigerator in the room Wi-Fi is not free in the room Noise from airport Pool closed at 5pm on Sat night $7 domestic beer Staff was indifferent Save yourself the trouble and $ and book somewhere else.

<Title>“Thank you to Nicolas from the Lost & Found and the entire staff.”
<Content>We had a great experience and enjoyed the view of the marina from our room. While there I lost my driver's liscense and two days later I realized it was missing. I phoned the hotel and was connected to lost and found and left a message to please return my call. My call was returned promptly and Nicolas said the liscense had been found. He sent it overnight to my son's home and it arrived by FedEx by 10:30am. I am so grateful for such good service and that Nicolas followed thru as he said. Thank you so much Nicolas, it made the remainder of my trip much easier. I will always remember your kindness and when visiting your city in the future I will be staying at the Sheraton SanDiego Hotel & Marina

<Title>“Great view, terrible airport noise and bad service”
<Content>This is definitely a case of the good, bad and the ugly. One one hand, the hotel is located immediately adjacent to the airport, which creates a really terrible situation for many rooms which are subjected to ongoing jet noise. The side of the hotel which faces the airport and the eastern most wing is close to the point of takeoff on the main runway ..so the jet noise starts very early in the morning (6-7AM) and continues to late at night (11-12pm). If you really want peace and quiet, don't choose this hotel!!! I have stayed at airport hotels in other parts of the world, and this is the worst example I know of. The one saving grace for this location may be a view, if you happen to have a room facing the bay, you can enjoy a nice view of the marina and downtown San Diego skyline. There are numerous other service issues which plague this hotel, ranging from inadequate attention to staffing at the front desk (particularly for Starwood Preferred guests) which lead to overly long waits for handling any issue, problems with daily room service for upkeep of rooms, and problems with card key access to the rooms. It turned out that I needed to get my room key cards reissued every day, since almost every day they stopped working for unknown reasons. Security finally decided to change the entire lock on the door to solve the problem! Most of the staff are in need of additional training. For club level guests, morning food service is monotonous and only of average quality.

<Title>“Suitable for a stopover or a longer stay.”
<Content>This is a very nice property close to the airport and by a marina in lovely San Diego. My husband and I have stayed here on previous occasions - usually overnighting before a cruise. This trip we spent 7 days at the hotel with a room overlooking the marina. Previous reviewers are correct that there are two distinct properties so advised to check which one is most suitable. As it is a little out of the downtown area - you either need to rent a car (but be forewarned overnight on site parking is $22.00 per night) or take the shuttle to the airport which runs frequently and is 7 minutes away and then catch the 992 city bus which takes you by the cruise ships and then turns to downtown and the trolley connections. Its fun if you don't mind public transportation and for $5.00 you can purchase a day pass which you can even use to get to Sea World/the wonderful Zoo or Mission Beach. The service at the hotel is very good - the front desk personnel were always friendly. If you have a breakfast package you do get a breakfast buffet daily. The staff there varies and the service isn't great. But for OJ, coffee and a croissant its fine. The main hotel has a beautiful pool and complete fitness centre. The other hotel has a pool but the fitness centre is undergoing renovations and will be reopening in the future. All in all this is a great spot for visiting San Diego and area. If you can get a reasonable rate and are staying long enough to get the special breakfast buffet its a good deal for the area.

<Title>“Beautiful Property!!!”
<Content>I work for Sheraton Hotel myself, and I absolutely loved this hotel..its in a such a beautiful location, the view from my room and plus from the entire hotel was amazing! I was upgraded to 12th floor with the club lounge access which was fantastic with a great breakfast every morning. Elsa, from the club lounge was so friendly and nice. The service was outstanding. Helpful staff and very accommodating. Mark (i believe his name was) from the front desk was very friendly, had good sense of humor and extremely helpful. I will definitely come back if I ever visit San Diego again.

<Title>“Great staff and lovely facilities”
<Content>I travel to San Diego often on business and finally settled on the Sheraton Marina as my home base when in the city. The staff has always treated me well and I look forward to my visits as this has become something of a second home for me. I could stay at another Sheraton in the downtown area, but I really like coming out onto the balcony and either looking out over the marina, or the city lights, depending on which side of the hotel I am on. The standard king size rooms are more spacious than a number of the other San Diego hotels I have stayed at and the beds are quite comfy. I feel more like I am on vacation, not working, when I walk into the room. Although the restaurant doesn't ever seem to crowded I really like the food; the pork loin, ahi stack and scallops are my favorite.

<Title>“Disappointing”
<Content>We called on Saturday a.m. to see if there was any way we could check in at noon since we were finishing a 200 mile relay race and were looking forward to showering. The person who answered the phone was very rude and said, "you booked through Priceline, so we won't do any special favors for you." I wasn't aware booking through Priceline made you a second class citizen! The fun continued when we realized the hotel had booked hundreds of college students who ran up and down the halls at all hours of the night. The guys were urinating off the balcony into the pool below, and throwing cups of beer. I also found our bathroom was not clean, and the hotel was dated. The location is nice (view of Marina), but I won't be staying here again.

<Title>“Very nice - had a great time.”
<Content>Our room was very nice. We enjoyed the balcony overlooking San Diego Bay. We stayed in the Bay Tower versus the Marina Tower. We didn't realize they were two separate buildings when we booked. We looked forward to the Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel but it was in the Marina tower building about half a mile down the road. There was Starbucks in the rooms with the coffee pot - single cup brewer. They offered an option to go green, not get fresh towels etc. everyday and we received a $5.00 coupon for use in the hotel restaurants and Starbucks. Overall we enjoyed our stay very much. Very easy access to lots of attractions: Old Town, down town area, Balboa park. There is a great trolley service that runs all through the city around $35 for the day. You can get on and off all day long. Well worth the price.

<Title>“Good location and good views!”
<Content>I just returned from staying at this hotel with a friend for one night. The hotel itself is very nice and the rooms are quite large with very comfortable beds. We did not use any of the hotels amenities such as wi-fi or the pool, so I can't say anything about that. The only area that should be pointed out to those looking at staying here is that it is very close to the airport. When the airport starts operating about 6:30 am you can really hear the jets taking off and landing. So if you are a light sleeper or want to sleep late, you may want to consider another option.

<Title>“Great Hotel BUT”
<Content>We like sheratons this one was good because you can seer as you land,but thats the problem if like us you get a front room(not facing the marina they are noisey. I love planes but sometimes when the noise is constant it was a bit too much..We had one meal in the hotel overpriced so was breakfast,if you are English the meals are a bit daunting.So just walk out the back of the hotel and find the little cafe good food (not great) and cheap.We went into town for our evening meals some very good places.Our 4th visit to San Diego hopfully not our last.

<Title>“I love this hotel!”
<Content>This hotel is amazing! Great value too. The only downside is the cab fare to get to/from the city. It's a little out of the city. But, it made it all the more better! It was such a quiet location. Nice spot to watch the yachts sailing the waters on sunset. The rooms are lovely and spacious. But the pool and spa area is FANTASTIC! Would highly recommend to anybody thinking of staying here.

<Title>“A Splitted hotel”
<Content>The hotel had the advantage of being on the marina, near the airport with free shuttle services to the airport. You might go to airport and then take chattel to down town and metro The hotel had two building that at least 7 minutes walk, be careful at the time of booking. The hotel is an average hotel. No personal amenities like tooth brush and no complimentary water on arrival as in most 5 stars hotel. There is a few computers in the lobby with free interent The chain in general adopting strange policy of not crediting points for booking done through travel agents, which will discourage me from going to such in the future. I contacted the manager to see if there is any flexibility in the, matter and to discussed with priority club, I hope the issue will be solved

<Title>“Sunny Southern Cali!”
<Content>PROS...This hotel is very close to the airport. It's actually the first hotel you see when you look up walking out of the airport. The hotel has two towers...I stayed at the marina tower (the first stop). Check in was easy, there are computers and free wi-fi in the lobby. The walk to the elevators is not long, and the elevators move quick. The hallways are clean, and the rooms are nice. There is a balcony attached to every room. The rooms are a little small, but they are clean and bright. The bathroom is cute and clean as well. The beds are so comfy and the blackout curtains really help when you need rest. The pool was nice and heated; there are towels that can be used outside. I did not use the fitness room. I felt safe at this hotel. CONS...if you don't have a car...be prepared to catch cabs or the free hotel shuttle to the airport where you can get a $5 bus pass and ride all day. There is a bus (9..?)that will take you downtown and you can catch any bus from there. The hotel is walking distance to the marina (behind the hotel) and across the hotel you can cross the street and sit and view the water. Thats it! Nothing is in walking distance...except this small grill in between the marina tower and the bay tower. Food in the hotel is very expensive! I had a breakfast for $26. No fridge in the room and nothing within walking distance...be prepared to spend quite a few $$$ on hotel food...or be patient waiting on a cab or shuttle/bus to other dinning options. I would stay here again! P.S. The easiest, safest, and most exciting way to see San Diego is to take the Old Town Trolley Tour! Love it...had a good time!

<Title>“Decent stay @ great price”
<Content>Decent stay, great price I stayed here with my husband for a quick weekend house-hunting trip. I got an amazing deal on Priceline, so I guess I shouldn’t be TOO picky… The hotel is VERY close to the airport which is very convenient, and luckily no airport noise that I noticed. The desk clerk when we checked in was very friendly and efficient. He upgraded us to a suite with a view, which put us in the Bay Towers, a separate building a little bit down the road. What he neglected to tell us was that we would be charged $22/day for parking – we found out when we checked out. He also didn’t tell us that Wifi is $11.95 per day… We chose the Bay view over the marina view, and enjoyed the view from the balcony. The room was large, with a sitting area with a couch and chairs and a desk area. It was also very quiet, even though we were next to an elevator. I found the nautical theme everywhere a little tiring – a little cliché and doesn’t really convey “luxury” to me. The bed placed diagonally in the room also seemed odd. That said, the bed was very comfortable, and the pillows were great – I slept very well here. The bathroom was abnormally small for the size of the room. I kept thinking if they had placed the bed horizontally instead of diagonally, they could have made the bathroom bigger. The towels were of decent quality, and the shower was ok, though not enough pressure for my taste. Overall a decent stay, but would not stay here again if I didn’t get a similarly low price.

<Title>“Nice hotel at a distance.”
<Content>The hotel's location is about 20 miles from downtown San Diego (Old Town). The hotel's surrounding is very nice and peaceful. Upon checking in, we were asked whether we wanted a marina or bay view. The mistake we made was requesting for marina view. The view that we got was just a portion of the marina with some boats parked at the dock. Would recommend choosing the bay view as it's a bigger view of the Pacific Ocean. The hotel has a nice swimming pool. Self-parking is a bit expensive at US$22 compared to other hotels in the area where they charge about US$16 to 18. The room is a standard-size room. The overall room was clean. Without a private car, I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay here as the location is quite a distance.

<Title>“Stay somewhere else”
<Content>If you're coming to the San Diego area and you'd like a hotel near the airport, rental car agencies and fun activities, stay somewhere else. This hotel had all 3, BUT- My room chair had stains all over it, the white bed linens were littered with long dark hairs, $22 a day to self park, I can hear the sliding patio doors of the abutting rooms (great when trying to sleep), I can hear everyone walking above me and down the hall past my room, the wifi is 11.95 a day ( the ramada right down the street has free wifi), miserable front desk help, I hear planes taking off and landing (otherwise great location). Gives Sheraton a bad name. Or maybe Sheraton gives Sheraton a bad name. I don't think they give a D about the average customer. Except the bell boys. Those guys were great. By the way, I was staying at the second rate smaller one a little further down the street. Book yourself and you'll find out.

<Title>“We wish we were back at the Sheraton Marina Hotel - the Marina Tower! Great 3 day stay!!”
<Content>We travel alot and have experienced many hotels....we loved our 3 day stay. The king size bed with the most luxurious linens must of been just one of the reasons I slept like a baby, not to mention how quiet the rooms are. We used our beautiful sunny balcony to enjoy evening wine and views of Marina. Enjoyed runs right out the door onto pathways - rented bikes from hotel too!!! The lobby is airy and had great views of harbor - excellent Starbucks in lobby and room. Even getting off the elevator was a treat - views from both directions and just so bright and airy. We had two nights booked at Omni hotel and are here now. Such a disappointment compared. Gaslamp area and Loudest room ever - even on 18th floor and Omni does not live up to it's reviews that describe a positive place - people should try the Sheraton for a good experience!!!

<Content>Hello, My family had a wonderful experience at this hotel. The location was great, close to the zoo and La Jolla. A huge thank you to Nicolas Osorio Casanova from the lost and found department who found and sent back my hair dryer. My only complaint was the wireless, the code was annoying, it would not say logged into your devices, you had to reenter the code everytime you used your phone, ipad, mac, etc.

<Content>I was at a convention and booked a room through my organization. I had a good rate and booked the lowest priced room. I also have special needs and asked to be near an elevator. My room was comfortable, a beautiful balcony with a view of the Coronado Bridge and the bay with sailboats. San Diego is quite a magical city to begin with. I went to sleep in a bed that felt like I was on a cloud, I seriously wanted to duplicate it at home! There were thousands of people at the hotel, but in my room it was absolutely quiet! I was so amazed. I have traveled around the world and slept in everything from 5 stars to pensions, this was like a home away from home.

<Title>“Lost and found”
<Content>We left our cell phone charger in the room, I called the hotel Lost and Found dept two days later and spoke to Nicolas, who was very courteous on the phone, identified the item right away without any further description from me, and promptly had the item shipped back to our house. Great lost and found efficiency and honest housekeeping staff. Separately, however, I must point out that a young male employee who worked at the SPG Platinum and Gold check-in counter was rather less courteous, and did not have good grasp of how to treat loyal SPG Platinum guests, repeatedly failed to impress me with his attitude.

<Title>“3 1/2 Stars Tower vs 2 Stars Tower vs 5 Star Lounge”
<Content>I was at this hotel in March for a business conference with functions in the hotel. There were about 130 participants at the meeting including clients. We knew going into the weekend that the hotel was sold out the night before the meeting began but at the last minute the hotel determined they did have some rooms for the few of us and the clients who were checking in early. Here is where the tale of two towers begins..... The hotel has 2 "towers" as they call it and the majority of the group was checked into the Bay Tower. I got a room in the Marina tower along with 2 others. Usually when a hotel has 2 towers you assume they are in the same building just using separate elevator banks and at opposite ends. However, these are really two completely separate hotel buildings separated by a 5-8 minute walk outside. (Two of my posted pictures show a view from my room and the lounge and the view from my Marina Tower room looking at the Bay Building so you can see the distance.) Note that the hotel does provide free shuttle service. You can see the map of the buildings and layout on the SPG page for the hotel under "Meetings & Events" and then "View Floor Plans & Capacity Charts." I asked the front desk staff who checked me in what the difference was between the two towers and she said "Well the rooms in the Bay tower are generally 30% larger." That may be true but some extra space is all you will get and it's not worth the trade off. Because I was a Platinum member after asking "Well check me into a room YOU would prefer..." I was given a room in the Marina Tower. As we met for dinner that first night naturally everyone asked how comfortable the rooms were and for the three of us in the main Marina tower (the main hotel building/entrance) the rooms were clean, renovated, and just fine. (Pictures of my Marina Tower room are posted) However, I heard nothing but bad comments the rest of the weekend from any meeting participant that was over in the Bay Tower. Distance was a problem but they commented how the hotel was old and run down, bathrooms were not as clean as they could be. They really had a completely different hotel experience than anyone who stayed in the Marina Tower. It's also not a quick trip to get between towers should you have a short break in your meeting and want to "run back to your room." When booking rooms on the hotel website you do choose which tower you would like a room in so BEWARE. In my opinion, if you are not staying in the Marina Tower, do not stay here or at least be prepared. The unexpected highlight was the Club Level Lounge (Marina Tower)! I have also posted pictures of the lounge. Many people who go to the lounges can tell you that most of the time, it's just a sleeping room on a standard floor at the end of the hall with some sofas and chairs in it - small, cramped, dark and not relaxing at all. Maybe there are some cold drinks but it's really depressing and pretty useless. However, the lounge here could not be more enjoyable. As I arrived at the hotel at 11am (and room not available) I asked to have access to the lounge as a Platinum member. The lounge is the entire top floor of the hotel. It's almost all windows with 2 TVs, lots of workspace and comfortable chairs and sofas, and times where food is provided. It's bright with lots of light and comfortable. Internet is also free in the lounge. It was really relaxing and what a great place to work especially since I couldn't check in until 3:30pm. I didn't mind working with a great view of the Marina and Bay. In regard to hotel location - It's DIRECTLY across the street from the airport. Yes it's a short commute from the airport but you can't walk to ANYTHING around there. Look this hotel up on the map before you book so you aren't disappointed.

<Content>Stayed here with at a conference. Rooms are new, clean, large, nice views of marina or city. Staff was friendly and competent. Poor shower pressure but otherwise a comfortable room. Very nice, new conference areas. But if I was returning for vacation, I doubt I would stay here. Simply too far off of the beaten path. I am sure there are comparable hotels in areas with more attractions.

<Title>“Great service, a bit islolated location”
<Content>Overall, I experienced a great stay at this hotel during a recent conference. The staff was helpful, by room was clean and comfortable and the food during conference was great. The only negative was the relatively isolated location. I am a big fan of walking, and you really needed to take a cab to get to town (although it is an easy walk from the airport). The hotel itself is clean and up to date. I was given a small suite with a little balcony where I could see downtown and the water through the trees (I was on a low floor). The bed was the usual very comfortable sheraton bed, and the linens were clean and fresh. Lunch at the hotel restaurant was tasty (I had a nice seafood cobb salad), but everything on the menu is $15-$20 for lunch before drinks, tax and tip. There are no other options to dine nearby, other than walking to the airport for fast food. The other hotel facilities were good. The gym contains several bikes, treadmills and ellipticals, as well as weight machines. The pool looked great. Lots of places to sit. There is a very nice club level lounges, with a great view. The lounge included cold breakfast choices each morning (cereal, oatmeal, pastries, fruit and cold cuts). Unlike some other Sheratons I visit, there were no hot choices. There is a free shuttle from the airport, and it is only about a 10 minute walk, so I did not experience parking. It looked like overnight parking was around $20. The property itself consists of several buildings, so the experience might depend on which building you end up in. The main tower houses the restaurant, bar, lounge and a much nicer gym than the other tower. The other tower is not right next door- it is a bit if a hike. There are also some annex buildings where the rooms have exterior corridors and doors. The overall value varied. My conference rate was over twice the auto club rate I paid the final night., so check around for deals.

<Title>“Relaxing Retreat on the Marina”
<Content>OVERVIEW OF BRAND Sheraton is the “flagship” brand of the Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) family of hotels as it has the largest number of hotels. As of April 1, 2011, all Sheratons must have a club lounge that is open on the weekends. They also have a computer/WiFi area in the lobbies known as “Link@Sheraton.” Hotel bathrooms are stocked with “Shine” products. SHERATON–SAN DIEGO MARINA This Sheraton opened approximately 40 years ago, and this was my first stay. It is located next to the airport, and it was renovated approximately 6 years ago. The hotel consists of two buildings: the main hotel with a conference center and the Bay Tower, which is 7–10 minute walk away. Both buildings have a “Link,” a fitness center, pool access, and restaurants. However, the main building has more and bigger of everything; and the only restaurant in the Bay Tower has limited hours and closed for lunch. The only Sheraton Club Lounge is on the 12th Floor of the Main Building. THE ROOM The rooms and hallways reflect its location on the Marina with lots of blue, pictures of boating, and nautical flags. The standard/deluxe room has a 37” LG LCD flat-screen TV, a coffee maker (Starbucks coffee), bar fridge with sensors (i.e., it’ll charge you if you pick it up), and an iron/ironing board. Most rooms have a balcony/patio, but you may want to ask to make sure. Most rooms also seem to have nice views as it’s on a narrow island and no other tall buildings are close by; views may be of the bay, marina, downtown, or airport. SPG Platinum Members receive free Internet in the room. Otherwise, Internet in your room will cost $15–19 for 24-hours. They have a “Link” on the first floor of both buildings, which offers free Internet for all. GYM AND POOL Both buildings have a gym and pool. However, the main building has more pools and is close to many activities that would be fun for children (e.g., an area with Ping Pong tables, and a massive Pirate Ship). The gym is also larger in the main building. SPG SPECIFIC Only the main building has a Club Lounge, which is open all day. The Lounge overlooks the Marina and is very nice and comfortable. There is a computer, a flat screen TV, and a fireplace. The Lounge fridge is stocked with bottled water throughout the day, but no soft drinks or coffee like at other Sheratons. The Lounge has breakfast (Monday–Friday = 6:30–9:30AM; Saturday & Sunday = 6:30–10:30AM) and evening appetizers (Daily = 5:00–8:00PM) with a cash bar (average price for drink = $9.00). I am not sure what the Platinum Amenities are as I wasn’t offered any (I assume I’ll get 500 Starpoints). MY RATING This is a really nice Sheraton. The rooms are comfortable, and the views are amazing. Although it is showing some wear and tear (e.g., the lamp shade in the room was beat up and the carpet by the balcony got wet due to a rainstorm because of bad weatherproofing), it’s still in very good condition. My main reason for giving this hotel 4 vs. 5 stars is because of the inconvenience of the Club Lounge. There should be a mini version of it in the Bay Tower just like there are “mini duplicates” of everything else given the Main Building isn’t convenient to get to. Although you can drive to the Main Building or take a Shuttle, that may not work if you are in a rush and/or just want to get a drink to take to your room. Notwithstanding this limitation, I actually think this is a great Sheraton. There are other nice Starwood Hotels closer to the Convention Center (e.g., The W and The Westin–Gas Lamp District), but unless you need to repeatedly go the Convention Center, then I’d opt for this Sheraton. It’s close enough to the downtown action, but serves as a nice retreat from your busy day. The pools and the views are very relaxing—especially if you are having drinks from your balcony while watching the sunset.

<Title>“Beautiful location and great staff!”
<Content>I recently visited for a conference and was enchanted by the beautiful city of San Diego. We were lucky enough to stay here and had a wonderful time. We arrived early in the morning and expected to stow our luggage and go until check-in, but the staff found a room for us. All the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Bryan F. at the Tapatini was very charming and one of the hardest-working guys I've seen. The location on the Marina is lovely. It is a jaunt to downtown (about 2.5 miles), but it's a pretty walk. The Old Town Trolley does make a stop here in the morning and is a great way to explore the city. There is also a car rental place not too far. I would certainly return to this beautiful hotel anytime.

<Title>“great stay”
<Content>I was a little worried due to the varied reviews of the property. I had a great experience all around, particularly in all of the areas that seemed to have been problems for other visitors. It might have been the time of year, though as I know busy seasons tend to show in the service one receives. Hospitality was professional and friendly, room was clean (I immediately checked everything that other guests had reported problems with - bathrooms, carpet, linens, which were all spotless). Room service was prompt (even faster than they promised for one dinner on a Friday night!), food was good. I upgraded to a Club room which was totally worth it. Beautiful view and room, great Club food and drink, along with ambience of the Club. Again, may have been time of year because everything was quite smooth and nice.

<Title>“Terrible hotel for a conference!”
<Content>This is not a good hotel to hold a conference. It is convienent to the airport but once there you must take an expensive cab to go anywhere. The hotel food is expensive , $10.00 for a bowl of oatmeal! If you want to eat anywhere else, you must take a cab. It is NOT close to any other services. Internet is ONLY available for a charge of 11.95 per Day in your room. The lobby does have free wireless but only had about two plugs which was very inadequate for 1000 peopke attending a conference. I would not reccommend holding a conference here - you may pay a little bit more to be downtown but you will not have to take a cab and you will have better food choices

<Title>“Ok but ensure you stay in the Marina Tower not the Bay Tower”
<Content>We got to the Hotel to be told we were staying in the Bay Tower. Didn't realise the hotel was split into two towers 5 minutes walk away from each other. Check in was painless and the room was clean. It looked over the marina and airport. Wasn't too noisy. We took a look at the Marina tower and the Bay tower is definitely the very poor relation. The Marina Tower had everything from a bar to 2 restaurants, a Starbucks, to a patio where you could enjoy a coffee looking at the marina. The Bay Tower had no bar open during the day where you could sit and enjoy coffee and enjoy the view. We were gutted especially as we were staying for 5 days. You will need a car to get anywhere from here. There are no shuttles into town. You can only book excursions from the Marina Tower conceirge. We didn't pay for the Internet but took advantage of the free wifi in reception, which was good enough for a Skype call. $22 for parking each day was a bit expensive but not as much as other hotels in the area. In summary. Stay in the Marina Tower. If you stay at the Bay Tower do not visit the Marina Tower. You will just get upset.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>The hotel was wonderful. A beautiful water view. It is close to Symphony Hall and the location of the San Diego Opera. It is about 2 miles from center city where there are lots of things to see. You must go to the San Diego Zoo if you have children. Our children live in San Diego and this hotel is a good place to stay and get around the city with a car.

<Title>“Great room convenient to airport”
<Content>We got a great deal on this hotel for last-minute travel to San Diego. We were pleasantly surprised by the beautiful harbor views and the crisp, clean, nautical themed rooms. Although our room faced the parking lot, the balcony was nice in the mornings to get some sunshine and fresh air. One night we returned from dinner to our room smelling of cigarette smoke. When my husband opened the sliding door to see if it was someone outside, the smell came rushing in. Since it's a non-smoking property, I called the front desk and they immediately sent up security. The gentleman was there in 2 minutes and agreed that the room was not suitable. Within 5 minutes of my initial call they promptly moved us to another room on the opposite side of the building. Excellent customer service from a rather irritating situation!

<Title>“Great room with a view”
<Content>The rooms were nice, the views even better. We had a room that had a view of the marina and the San Diego bay cityline. The nighttime view of the city lights was great. Rooms were well appointed, comfortable bed, clean updated room and bathrooms, even have Peter Thomas Roth bath amenities (as a woman, I appreciated this very much! ^_^) It was a short trip to get downtown, SD Zoo and Seaworld and not too bad to Coronado as well, where we had dinner plans one evening. There is also a hotel restaurant for convenience. Across the hotel is a walking path by the water which was also nice. The area has restaurants and bars within walking distance and is also by the airport (which is good for plane watching or aviation photography -my fiance enjoyed it) Overall it was a great place to stay. Nice, clean convenient and parking was not far nor crowded and it was fairly cheaper than downtown hotel parking. I would give it 5 stars except the room we had was a bit small. King bed and furniture with one large suitcase had us walking over our stuff to get to the bathroom. But traveling as a couple, I wasn't bothered much by it.

<Title>“Beautiful views, nice location...”
<Content>Right next to the airport and situated on the bay this hotel has picture perfect views of the city from one side and views of a marina and Point Loma peninsula on the other when you stay in the main tower. The rooms are bright and clean, the decks offer great views, the pools are large and inviting, and the location is a short cab ride to the city. The in-room dining choices are limited, but service is fast. There's a bar restaurant in the lobby that offers decent food at decent prices. There are conference facilities in this hotel, so if you're looking to avoid corporate crowds this may not be the place for you. Overall I was very happy with the four days I just spent here and want to come back again to see more of the city.

<Title>“Convenient location - if have car - terrible hotel service”
<Content>We stayed in the "Bay Tower," which is a separate building, around the corner about 1/2 mile from the main building. The Bay Tower used to be a Ramada...and still looks like it. We were unable to check in early, were told they put a pending on our room to clean first, so we could check in after flying for 8 hours, and would call us. They never called, so we checked in at 2:50 pm, only to be given a room we did not choose or pay for. After arguing, they moved us. Then, cleaning service did not come the next day while we were out of our room between 9:45am and 3:15pm. I called guest services to alert of this - did nothing except bring up fresh towels. Then, cleaning service called us because we had a do not disturb sign on the door after 3:15pm when they wanted to clean. Housekeeping also banged on our door three times the morning of check-out. The hotel charges an arm and leg for each LOCAL phone call, do notice the little sheet of paper near the phone explaining this...something I did not notice. They charge for the Internet - two prices, daily, and charge for the self parking. The bar charged $70 for 5 beers and two, small bottles of water. The in-room convenient prices were equally as expensive. The room was their deluxe king, on the 8th floor facing the bay. Nice view, nice little balcony, which was the only thing we enjoyed - although the weather was unseasonably cold, extremely windy and rainy. The bed was uncomfortable and the furniture looked old and dingy. I did ask for an adjustment on the bill, but guest services would not budge and did not seem to care at all. I also used the spa at the main building. They gave me a key to a locker that didn't work. After fiddling with it for 5 minutes or so, I asked for a new locker and explained the lock was malfunctioning. The staff person said, "yes, a work order has been called in..." I explained she should not have given me that locker then. She didn't seem to care. I was the only person in the spa. So, I have stayed at the Loew's Coronado for the same price and had much better service and rooms. I chose to stay here for a more convenient location. Not worth saving the 10-12 minute drive. Yes, I am particular and have not a problem paying for good service and amenities, however, my experience was definitely poor and worth giving a head's up to others.

<Title>“Beautiful area, unhelpful staff”
<Content>I was disappointed with my hotel because I specifically paid extra for a high-level room with a king sized bed and a great view, but when I arrived at the hotel, I was told that there were no more King suite rooms available and since I pre-paid through another website, the hotel was not able to refund any of my money as they were down-grading my room. The hotel was happy to offer a king suite in their second tower, but this tower was over a 5 minute walk away with none of the amenities. I was staying at this specific hotel because I was attending a conference and wanted to be close to the events plus the hotel amenities. The hotel placed me in a handicap room with the promise to upgrade me when another room became available, but that never happened. The hotel and surrounding area was beautiful, but it was very secluded. The airport was minutes away, but all of the other sights in SD were at least a $15 cab ride away and the food in the hotel was very over-priced. The walls in the rooms were also paper-thin. I was woken up one night by my neighbor's snoring.

<Title>“Great hotel!”
<Content>We reserved this room on the backside of our vacation to Maui. After a sleepless night at the Hampton Inn, we happened to drive by the Sheraton on the way to the airport early for our flight to Maui. Noticing how very close it is to the airport, we decided to book for our return. Upon arrival, we only had to wait about five minutes for a shuttle to the hotel at around 10pm. Their shuttle operates from 4am until 12 midnight. We were checked in and in our beds by 11 o'clock. We realized that their restaurant didn't open until 6:30 a.m., and we needed to leave for the airport early the next morning. So, we ordered our breakfast by leaving the menu tag hanging on our door to be delivered between 6 and 6:15 a.m. At 5:58 a.m. it was cheerfully delivered hot, and as ordered with a newspaper. We arrived downstairs a few minutes before seven, and were picked up by the airport shuttle within minutes. The bed was very comfortable, bathroom super clean, and room very quiet with a view of the harbor.

<Title>“Bad experience”
<Content>Me and my boyfriend were there from the 23rd to the 26th of Febuary 2012. We were not satisfied with this hotel because we got there with high expectatives due to the brand name of Sheraton and the price of the room, just with this you would expect a quality and clean room. 1. We arrived to the room we were assigned and it was dirty( it wasn't clean from the last stay of unknowns) 2. They immediately changed us to the room in front. The bathtub was dirty, the sheets were brownish in some part and the bathroom was full of hair( this just one more time gave the impression that the hotel WAS NOT CLEAN. 3. They moved us up to a Suite( which was even smaller than the regular guest room) and what we do recognize is that they gave us free breakfast for both of us for the 3 nights we were there. Overall I would not recommend this hotel. Not such a good location wither because you must have a car to go to the center for dinner, lunch, any other activity you want.

<Title>“Great stay!”
<Content>I really enjoyed my couple of nights here. I stayed in the Bay Tower which is the smaller hotel approx 10 min walk from the Marina Tower. I was on the 7th floor with a stunning view of the marina from the large balcony. The rooms are very big and nicely decorated (30% bigger than Marina Tower rooms I was told). Bed was super comfortable. I walked through the Marina Tower which is a much bigger hotel. The lobby is more impressive and the bar/restaurant there was more happening, plus there is Starbucks there...the Bay Tower just has a bar/restaurant. I was more than content with the Bay Tower though! I reserved through the Sheraton website and got a ridiculously good deal, $130ish. I paid 4 times that much for one night at a hotel in Santa Monica! Location: it's a bit far from downtown, but if you love to walk, as we do, it's fine, plus you are walking by the water so it's really pretty. A cab to the zoo cost $20 incld tip, cab from the Gaslamp was $15 with tip. Given the great rate it made sense for us to stay a little further out and take the occasional cab.

<Title>“Nice rooms, Horrible service”
<Content>I came here for a conference in March for 3 days. The central reservation center made in error in my reservation and did not book the room for the last night of my stay but instead reserved the room for the night of my departure. I discovered this upon my arrival to the hotel. The check-in staff informed me that they were sold of out of rooms for the last night. The hotel manager on duty then said all Starwood hotels were sold out in the area and that it was up to me find my own accommodations! So basically I took it upon myself by calling the Starwood main reservation line and after basically a half hour of being placed on hold and the run around, I was placed in another nearby Sheraton. I was therefore displaced from the hotel where my conference was and had to find my own transportation to the conference. This inconvenience is only magnified due to my overall dissatisfaction with the service (actually lack of) that the hotel staff here provided. To top it off, there is no WiFi in the rooms and to get internet is through an ethernet cable which is $12 per 24 hours and I got overcharged for using the in-room food bar. The rooms themselves are nice. I was in the Bay tower. In-room coffee maker, flat panel TV, The whole complex is huge and there is a free shuttle from the airport to the main Marina tower and between the 2 towers. The airport shuttle runs every 25 minutes which is an eternity when you have just come off a long flight. Basically one person's bad experience..would not recommend or recommend this hotel. Each guests experience is different. Mine just happened to be bad.

<Title>“Great Resort Like Property”
<Content>This property is beautifully maintained! From the outdoor grounds to the club floor, everything was clean and looked fresh. The hotel is broken up into two buildings. The Marina Tower being the "main" tower with restaurants, pools, gym, tennis courts, Starbucks and club lounge. The Bay Tower is about a 5 minute walk along the marina and while not a huge deal it would be a little inconvenient if you were wanting to be close to the action of the hotel. The property sits on the marina and across the street from the airport, BUT this is not a typical airport hotel !! It is somewhere between hotel and resort property probably partly because of the expansive grounds and being on the marina. The rooms in the Marina tower are a tad on the smaller side, but have balconies and in excellent condition. Rooms in the Bay tower are a bit larger. The higher floors have wonderful views no matter which building you are in or which direction you are facing. Even the lower floors I imagine would have nice views as there is nothing around the immediate property but marina or bay. Full Starbucks in the lobby is very convenient for morning nibbles or whatever coffee concoction you like best. There is also a full service restaurant with a very nice breakfast buffet. Equally enjoying is the club lounge on the top floors which is a wonderful place to relax and watch the sunrise over breakfast or the sunset over appetizers and drinks. The front desk agents we encountered were very friendly and helpful, even when we asked to check in at 9am. Although a room wasn't immediately available, it was shortly thereafter and well before the normal afternoon hotel check in time. The restaurant waiter we had was also very attentive and friendly. And I have to give a big thanks to the club lounge waiter who was equally attentive.

Just a great Welcome experience. Our room overlooked the Bay and it was quite spectacular both by day and night. The hotel offers a nice fitness center and swimming pool areas with Hot tub. Our room was very comfortable, plenty of room to relax. All in all I would love to stay again and hopefully will. Great getaway weekend.

<Title>“Great Sheraton Airport Property-stay without hesitations”
<Content>Stayed at this property for one night with my wife and two small kids. We booked connecting rooms and paid for the upgrade to the Club Level Floor. Airport Shuttle was waiting for us, with a very helpful and pleasant driver. Shuttle runs to and from airport every 15 minutes. Check in was flawless, quick and painless. Our club level connecting rooms in the Marina tower were great for our family. Typical Sheraton rooms and exactly what we expected. One bonus are that the rooms come with a balcony. Our rooms overlooked the Marina and we really enjoyed looking at the boats and people watching from the balcony. We used the main pool just below the restaurant. It wasn't too warm that day outside (60 ish) so actually my kids used the pool while we sat and watched. We ordered room service delivered to the pool deck and it arrived quickly and was quite tasty. As mentioned in other rooms, food and beverage are pretty expensive, and there are not any other options within walking distance, so plan ahead. The upgrade to the club floor was worth it for the appetizers in the evening and the nice breakfast spread in the morning. Only downer is that this Club level does not offer complementary adult beverages, but rather a cash bar. I was hoping the cash bar prices would be a bit less than the regular bar, but they were still on the expensive side. With that being said the staff working in the Club Lounge were great. We enjoyed our time in the lounge. Took a cab into San Diego proper for a few hours....15 bucks each way, so reasonable if you are not wanting to rent a car. I would highly recommend this airport property if you have a lay over or early flight. It was a great station for us to stay at for the night. One other note, we were not bothered by airport noise, but our room faced the Marina and not the airport. Stay here without hesitations. This is a nice property with an excellent staff.

<Title>“Very nice hotel, but pricey”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel in February for a conference that was being hosted in the main building. The hotel was quite nice and the staff was very courteous. The rooms were beautiful, modern, and very well appointed. I was quite comfortable staying here. Location is a bit of a challenge; it is a beautiful location tucked in the middle of the bay, but it is somewhat inconvenient if you want to be able to walk anything. You basically need to take a taxi or a rental car anywhere you want to go; this can be marked in contrast to previous stays I had in Mission Beach/Pacific Beach where I was able to walk from my hotel to any number of stores of restaurants. The only other issue I could see here was price. The food available at the hotel was quite good for a series of hotel-based restaurants. But, they were very overpriced. Unfortunately, there just aren't many options there in the vicinity so unless you want to drive into town (or take a taxi), you are pretty much stuck with spending quite a bit of money on food at their selection of restaurants.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel!!!!”
<Content>The hotel was extremely clean. The entire staff was polite and courteous. Our room had lots of chrome fixtures and there wasn't one fingerprint or smudge anywhere. The view of the bay was great. We usually stay at the Radisson for the sleepnumber beds, but this was better than I thought it would be and the bed was very comfortable. We will be back.

<Title>“Cute room, GREAT view.”
<Content>I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews on this site but I have to say our one night stay was FANTASTIC! Our room was facing the marina and the sunset on the patio was BREATHTAKING. Our room was 2 queen beds and left very little room for extra bags or stretching room but we made do. The room itself was very clean and had very nice furnishings. Some have mentioned the proximity to the airport, the only time I noticed this was when I was in the hot tub and I could hear planes fly over, when I was in my room I never would have known I was near it. The grounds a beautiful and the staff was very attentive, they even let us check in 3 hours early. The one thing I would like to mention is Nicholas in lost and found. He saved me BIG TIME. I am from Alaska and I somehow left my big winter parka in my room. I had a flight out the next day and called frantically to the hotel, even though it was after hours Sue transferred me to his extension telling me to leave a message and she would contact him directly letting him know I needed assistance ASAP. Sure enough within minutes of leaving a message I received a call back. They had my coat and would be able to FedEx it to me in the morning. He went above and beyond standard customer service.

<Title>“Good for me”
<Content>I went to San Diego for a conference at the convention center and stayed at this hotel for four nights through hotwire. As a huge fan of public transportation and walking, I tried to walk. It is 3 miles one way and it ook me a full one hour, so I stopped doing this after a day. You can hop in the free airport shuttle and take mts992, which costs only $2.25 and just a few minutes to downtown, although you need to walk additional few blocks to the convention center. Upon the recommendation from this site, I requested a room with a downtown view, and the staff gave me a room at Bay Tower (about 1000 ft from Marina Tower). I found out that I could not see the downtown. The next day, I requested a room to Marina Tower to be near the airport shuttle without any preference to the view, and I was given a room with a beautiful downtown view. From the experience of staying at both towers, the room at Marina Tower was smaller and was okay since I was alone, and I presume that even numbered room at Marina Tower: harbor/airport view odd numbered room at Marina Tower: downtown view even numbered room at Bay Tower: airport view odd numbered room at Bay Tower: harbor view. The staff were very nice. I did not have the privilege of using free wifi in the room, but I saw people with status get it. There are a few computers in the lobby and the connectivity was good. I have no particular complaint against the hotel and I would stay again.

<Content>The hotel is in a wonderful location but the hotel and rooms need to be updated. The rooms have some wear that is visible but the rooms are comfortable. I have stayed there twice and found some staff to be very helpful and others not so much. I would recommend the hotel as long as you go on Priceline or Hotwire and get a good price.

<Title>“Tired Facility”
<Content>Positives: -Airport Access -Marina Location -Lobby Free Internet Access -Balconies on rooms with chairs -Comfortable bed Negatives: -Run down room -Run down airport shuttle -Expensive (overpriced) on-site dining I got a really good rate at this facility, but upon check-in and seeing my room I quickly checked availability at other options. Seeing as how I was only destined to sleep a few hours over two nights at this hotel, I elected to stay. The rooms were outdated, especially the bathroom. Lights above the mirror were about 5'8" high, which wasn't conducive to a slightly taller person who has to shave. Fixtures were rusty, shower curtain was too long (about 4" on the bath floor, inside the bath), and the sink was once-overed with crud collecting against the wall below the mirror. It was pretty much unacceptable and if I had arrived at a decent time or normal state of mind I would have definitely requested a room change. The on-site dining charged resort rates for food, which I feel based on the overall condition of things is overpriced. I did not order any of the food. At one time this may have been a 4 star facility, I would now rate it a 3 star facility operating at about 2.5 stars overall. The staff was overall friendly and helpful, although upon arrival it was like pulling teeth to ask for a king instead of the two twins they had me booked in. He tried not to change me, but in a courteous and professional manner. I would not stay at this hotel again, however I think it is a fair value at a 3 star rate for a big hotel.

<Title>“Excellent one night stay but annoying parking lot.”
<Content>Nice hotel with a great harbor view. I stayed at the other tower down the island and it was annoying looking for parking then being told that I have to drive down the island to another tower and park there again. The key did not open the gate..etc..but lets not get into that. I ended up parking on the street and saved $25. Hotel was modern with balconies and looked renovated.

<Title>“Good marina location”
<Content>I am ambivalent about this hotel, mainly because of the service. Aside from the pleasant gym attendant and waitstaff in the restaurants, the other employees were less effective than automated voice response units. They did get their jobs done, but offered nothing without prompting. Otherwise I enjoyed the marina location. It's a nice area for walking and the pool was great. The marina tower room was fine. The club breakfast had a good selection of items. This is a good option if you're arriving on a late flight and just want to jump on a quick shuttle to your room. By the way, I didn't hear a single plane during my stay. A helicopter once while outside, but otherwise no excess noise at all.

<Title>“Excellent experience, even when they were challenged by the San Diego blackout.”
<Content>I cannot say enough good about the Sheraton Marina Bay in San Diego. We were there for the graduation of my son from USMC boot camp, and the lights went out all over the entire city that afternoon. Literally, no one had power. We were there with our younger children, and I had so many concerns over where we would feed them, if we would even be able to check into the hotel, etc. The temperature that day was around 100 degrees. Well, we got to the Sheraton, and the line to check in was long because they only had 2 computers working off generators and all these people were trying to check in whose flights had been cancelled (it's right by the airport). The staff were walking around handing out water bottles to all of us and light sticks because there was no power in the rooms. The cold water was such a blessing and I just thought the light sticks were such a nice thing to do. Then, if you can believe it, they had a cold buffet set up in the dining area that evening that had cold cuts, cheeses, pasta salad, green salad, etc. I was so relieved to know my kids would get to eat! They had very few lights on, but the servers were friendly despite the circumstances they were working in, and the presentation offered was amazing considering they only had a short time to put this together and make sure their guests could have something to eat. I felt taken care of. Really. Of course the rooms had no lights, but it was clean and comfortable. The sun had gone down and we had a nice breeze from the bay through our balcony's sliding glass door, so it actually was cool in our room by the time we went to bed. The power came back on around midnight thankfully. In summary, as a mom being away from home in a city I didn't know with no power, with my young children, I can't say enough about how well taken care of I felt by the Sheraton. I felt safe and was just so pleased with how gracious all the staff was under such duress themselves.

<Title>“Thanks Mr. Casanova and Sheraton”
<Content>Stayed recently at the Sheraton Marina in San Diego for a conference. Pleasant place to stay. Good conference facilities. Nice amenities, place to walk. But what really left me feeling good about the place is this: In a hurry to catch my plane after the conference, I left behind a dresser drawer full of clothing. Because of my schedule, it was more than a week before I realized where I had left it. When I called, Mr. Nicolas Casanova from Lost & Found tracked my clothes down for me and returned them to me intact. Way to go Sheraton. I won't forget it.

If you are going to be in the San Diego downtown area for longer than a couple of days sign up for www.car2go.com . There are 2 of their cars parked right next to the hotel and they can be used on a moments notice.

<Title>“Great Stay!”
<Content>I wasn't expecting much since it was a hotel near the airport, but the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina is a great place to stay! The hotel is beautiful--has a nice pool, jacuzzi, and fire pits right by the harbor. The views from the room were nice as well. The room was clean and stylish. We could hear the airplanes taking off every once in a while from the airport, but it didn't bother me a bit (and I'm an extremely light sleeper). Upon our arrival, the valet were very helpful and answered our questions about where to park. Susanna from In Room Dinning was so nice when she brought our breakfast up the next morning! (The front desk had forgotten to give us our F&B discount card upon arrival and she said no problem she would take care of it and she made sure the bill was adjusted). The concierge (can't remember her name, but she had brown hair) was really helpful as well and printed off directions to five different places for us. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Recent conference stay unfortunate”
<Content>I attended a conference there recently. The conference was in the main tower, even though I had a reservation there, I was put in the Bay tower (an old Westin) that is located at a separate location. I am not sure how far it is, but it was a very long way back and forth in the rain. I ended up spending almost 3 hours waiting for the shuttle (supposed to be every 20 minutes) during the 2 days. One evening it was raining and i waited for 40 minutes. No wireless internet in the room. It did have wired that i didn't use. One hour limited wireless in the lobby. My spouse tried to eat there one evening and couldn't even get anyone to seat her. If you have to be there for a conference -think twice about accepting a Bay tower room. You are somewhat isolated at this property. Not much close by. I would not stay there for a vacation without a vehicle. The main hotel looked nice when i walked through the lobby to attend meetings. The food at our conference was average. One evening we had a dinner for 250. The food was cold. Not warm, cold.

<Content>I visit every year for a conference. The experience is almost always excellent. This time was no different. The rooms are sparkling clean and well-stocked. The restaurant and bar are lively and serve great food. Their meeting facilities are outstanding. The proximity to the airport makes this a very convenient hotel. The distance from the city center means you always have to cab it there rather than take a leisurely stroll.

<Title>“Good Conference Location”
<Content>There's many things I like about this property. There are a few negatives. Positives First: - Love the location, close to airport but with a harbor/bay view - My room (on 12 floor) had a balcony facing the water which was very nice. - Club lounge on the 13 or 14 floor is very decent. The evening snacks are great and tasty. Examples include fried chicken. The breakfast spread is adequate. Bagels, eggs, oatmeal, fruits, small selection of ham and cheese, juices, tea/coffee. No hot breakfast. The views are phenomenal. The sitting is comfy. - The rooms facing the bay (ie. with the view are great) - Its a very short drive to the Gas Lamp Quarter; maybe 7 minutes or less. Its literally two minutes to the airport. - Rooms are not luxurious but very comfortable. Decor is reasonable, in blue. Negatives - the hotel does not have good restaurants. The restaurants share one kitchen, and depending on your luck, the wait and service for food can range from 5 to 25 minutes. Its a big drawback. Having said that, the service, when you do get it, is reasonable. The waitstaff try very hard to please. The fitness center is reasonable with a wide range of equipment. There are decent pools, but I didn't get to use them. All in all, I would stay again, as long as I am not counting to eat at their restaurants. There is a starbucks at the property.

<Title>“A reasonable airport hotel”
<Content>Convenient for the airport, though plane noise is not too noticeable in the guest rooms. Clean room, if in need of renovation (though the check in staff implied it had been recently renovated). Definitely worth staying in the main tower. If you want more than a standard airport hotel, this is not for you. The restaurant was the disappointment. The staff wearing badly coffee stained shirts, the food average, with little attention to detail (e.g. The soup comes with biscuits still in plastic packets) yet relatively high priced. Few alternative options in the area.

<Title>“Convenient to the airport, but won't select for a stay in the city.”
<Content>My expectations were not too high. I selected this hotel because it was convenient to the airport. I had stayed at this hotel many years ago for a large conference. I was pleased to have an upgrade into an executive suite as an SPG Platinum member. As is typical of large hotels, it was a long walk to the room. The room was old but had been updated to meet Sheraton standards. The club floor lounge was very large. The food was limited. The staff in the club lounge was very attentive.

We had a room overlooking the marina and the sunset from the balcony was fantastic after a busy day seeing the sights. Staff were lovely and helpful, rooms were nicely furnished and close to the airport. We had a car so found it easy to drive around from the location. We didnt eat at the resort but enjoyed heading into the Gaslamp District as there was so much on offer.

<Title>“Great Conference Hotel”
<Content>I stayed here for 3 nights during s conference - stayed in the Marina tower. The bed was very comfortable and I had 3 great nights of sleep which is highly unusual for me. I loved the city/bay view and I never closed the drapes . The sunsets and sunrises were amazing. What impressed me the most was the staff. Every single persons greeted me sincerely - from the front desk to the maid on the 11th floor, to the wait staff during the conference luncheon to the guys packing up the conference chairs . The customer service training at this to hotel really shows - but the sincerity was amazing. The employees honestly seem happy to work here - every single one. Room for improvement: better transportation downtown for those of us who didn't bring a car. The city bus stop was way too far away and there wasn't enough info for us to figure how how to get to downtown ourselves. This hotel will feel isolated for those who like to walk to restaurants etc.

<Title>“Disgusted by the "Green" Treatment”
<Content>I stayed here with my husband for a conference, and while the hotel was pleasant I was unhappy with several features, especially the "green" housekeeping option. When I signed up I understood we were just foregoing having our sheets and towels changed daily, but instead we discovered we received NO housekeeping services whatsoever -- including replenishment of our in-room coffee and shampoo. I also was surprised that despite our reservations far in advance, we were assigned a room literally in the basement. We had a nice little patio with a couple of chairs, but the view was of a wall below the parking lot. The day of our departure I received an email offering me a view for an additional substantial daily charge (which I declined), and then found that other people at the conference enjoyed lovely views at no additional cost. There's also no wi-fi in the rooms -- and hard-wire Internet costs about $12 a day. Finally, access to the hotel is poor without a car. Even the Old Town Trolley comes by only once in the morning and once in the evening. There must be better deals in San Diego, and if I were not attending a conference there I'd certainly find them.

<Title>“Fabulous hotel, space, value & service”
<Content>Stayed 2 nights pre-cruise with a group of 70 at this hotel. Whole group thrilled with hotel. Service in restaurant superb. Ronnie Hophman (Food & Beverage Manager) was very professional and helpful. Brian, waiter, went out of his way to be cheerful and went teh extra mile to do things for us. Alex, another waiter, leaped out of nowhere to help when my husband choked (badly) on his coffee. He was fabulous. Front desk staff very good. Rooms spacious and lovely. Beds VERY comfortabel. I slept 10 hrs!!! Turn right out of hotel, go to water. Turn left and walk a ways. YOu will come to Island Prime, a restaurant that has Happy Hour prices and $5.00 appetizers (REALLY good) 3.30-5.30 pm. A lovely walk along the water. San Diego is lovely. Must go to zoo also. Cheers Barbara Seagram

<Title>“Service and attention that exceeds most Sheraton properties”
<Content>The Sheraton Branded hotels can have a wide range of service and quality. The service levels offered at this hotel is much closer to what you would expect at a St Regis property sans butler of course. Staff and management do an OUTSTANDING job of providing excellent personalized service at a large high volume hotel. Location is great if you have a late flight in or an early flight out. You can return your rental car and walk back to the hotel with ease (avis is a bit more than the others). I havent tried the restaurants in awhile so i cannot comment on the food quality but everything else will exceed your expectations. TVs are flat screens with HD content. I prefer the Marina tower over the Bay tower the rooms may be smaller but it has a much nicer feel. The valet crew are fast and efficent. The only area for improvement for me is the front desk can get quite busy and I hate waiting in line to get my room.

<Title>“Great location near the water”
<Content>So close to the airport without the feel of an "airport hotel". Stayed in the Marina tower and loved the nautical decor. Walk along the harbor right outside and in fact spotted dolphins swimming in the harbor on our walk over to the Starbucks in the Harbor tower. Pool at the Marina tower was small but nice.

<Title>“Nice Hotel, Location Worked for Us. $22 Parking.”
<Content>We spent a week at this hotel in late Jan. I was very concerned about the location prior to arrival due to the proximity to the airport, however, it turned out to be a great location for us. Rent a car and you will be central to everything San Diego has to offer. Going down town to eat got old quickly due to traffic and crowds and we found ourselves spending more and more time in the Point Loma, an area just north of the hotel. The whirlpool was very nice and big, 10 people can comfortably fit. The room was nicely decorated and the beds were comfortable. It's not a Westin heavenly bed but it is far from the low end. There is airport noise but it's mostly during the day when we were away so it's not an issue. Our room was overlooking the marina (away from the airport) so the other side might be different. $22/day parking is very high and you have no viable alternative. It was interesting that long term airport parking in the area was $10/day. My one complaint is the price of parking. Seems very excessive and should be included in room rates. Internet was only free in the lobby. The 4 lobby computers were in good condition and provided fast access. We checked weather and "sites to see" in the lobby prior to leaving for the day. Overall we had a great stay and would consider this hotel if returned to the San Diego area.

<Title>“Great for short stays or if you have a rental car”
<Content>The Sheraton near SAN provides a nice play to rest for short trips in the area. While there are not many restaurants/services in the surrounding vicinity, the hotel provides several options including a gift shop and two restaurants with overpriced, but decent food. The breakfast buffet - while limited in choices - had a nice sampling of fresh fruit. We enjoyed playing ping-pong in the recreation area and found the pool and hot tub to be a perfect end to the day. We also loved our time by the fire pit, finding it especially satisfying after a dip. The room itself was nicely appointed and very comfortable. Service was excellent and the free shuttle bus to the airport prompt and convenient. Stay here for short trips and when you need a good base for jumping off into the San Diego area.

<Content>I stayed at the hotel for 3 days and had an incredible time. During our free time, we hung out at their bars, especially Quinn's. The drinks were great, service was exceptional, and the manager is super friendly. We had a great time hanging out at Quinn's. We took advantage of the hotel's beautiful pool... they have a very large pool area that never got crowded. I look forward to my next visit to this hotel!!!

<Title>“Great Escape”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here while on a trip out west. Fantastic location,and amazing views of the harbor and of the Naval base across the way. Durning the afternoons you could see the helicopters performing manuvers and all kinds of fun stuff. It's a short cab ride into the city, we always hit the Gaslamp when we go and this time we caught a Padres game too. If you have a little bit of time also check out Old Town for some amazing food and drinks and then head over to Coronado to check out the hotel and go to McP's pub for a few drinks. McP's is incredible, SEAL and miltiary memorabilia all over the place, as this is a favorite hangout of the locals from the base we're told.

<Title>“Mediocre at best.”
<Content>The view was lovely and the staff was very friendly. With that said, the building was a disappointment. Wifi is only in the lobby. The building was dated! The keys were sporadically working in our room and the pool. The bar was extremely overpriced compared to the rest of San Diego. The rooms were overpriced as well. We appreciated the shuttle. The parking fee of 22.00 is overpriced. Other places near there do not charge.

<Content>I am in this hotel every month for three days since December. I usually dread the idea of staying in a hotel and don't sleep well. However, my experience here has been far above anywhere I have stayed and I look forward to each stay. I actually sleep well and enjoy my room, and truly enjoy the views from my window! The staff are great, and the food is really good. Great atmosphere.

<Content>The hotel looks it is trying to be a luxury hotel but the towels were small and not very thick. As others have said, you must take a cab everywhere. It is the hotel Holland America uses but I'm not sure why when there is a Holiday Inn half a block from the cruise terminal.

<Title>“Great view, dirty and cold room”
<Content>We only stayed at this hotel for one night because we were visiting Sea World the next day. It is very close to Sea World and close to lots of fun areas and the view is wonderful. The room itself needed a little bit of TLC. There was lipstick on the window because someone had kissed it and there was mold in the shower grout. There was also hair on the floor. It didn't have a central heating system- only a wall unit and the wall unit was filthy and didn't work very well. We called the front desk and they didn't seem too concerned with fixing it. We waited 30 mins for someone to show up and eventually just gave up and went to bed. In the middle of the night the smoke detector started beeping because the battery was low. So that was fun too. :)

<Title>“Comfortable But Noisy”
<Content>THE GOOD Customer service at the Bay Tower was fantastic; we arrived a few hours before scheduled check-in but were allowed to check-in early. Front desk staff was very nice and accommodating. Harbor view was beautiful and the room was clean and comfortable with a nautical theme. The bathroom was a bit disappointing—it looked tired like a bathroom from a 1980s family home. Still, it was manageable and everything worked fine. THE NOT-SO-GOOD Only two major complaints about the Bay Tower: the location and the noise. I booked on Priceline thinking it would be closer to Gaslamp; *technically* we could have walked there, but it would have been quite a hike. Since we didn't have a rental car (and didn't want to pay for a taxi), our exploration radius was very limited. And since we were in our room much of the time, we noticed that it was quite noisy. You could hear every sound from the hallway from quiet conversations to people dragging in from the clubs at 2-3am. And since we were there over New Year's Eve, we also heard several boisterous groups until around 4am. Unrelated: could not access free wi-fi. Decent stay overall, but probably would not stay again.

<Title>“This is an airport Hotel”
<Content>Please don't get me wrong, but this airport Hotel is just that. Simply put, it is a good choice if you are having to spend the night before catching a flight or arriving a day before a cruise and nedd a place to stay overnight. There are much better choices for spending longer in San Diego,, especially if you don't want to have to rent a car. It is located near San Diego Airport but just a bit too far from the Gas Lamp district to hoof it on foot. This about a caution about location rather than the hotel itself.

<Title>“A Perfect Stay”
<Content>We stayed here for one night before an early flight. We chose this hotel because it was close to the airport. For an airport hotel, it does not seem like one at all. The hotel is really beautiful, warm and welcoming. The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. We checked in early and received a room upgrade since we are Starwood Gold Members. The suite was spacious, new and comfortable. It had a King bed and a Queen size pull out sofa, plus a full size bar and two balconies facing the marina. The bedding was perfect. The bathroom and room were updated. The pool was heated and the jacuzzi was nice. The restaurant has good food and not too pricey. We ended up taking a later flight and we had complementary late check-out at 4:00pm because we are Starwood gold members. There is also a complementary airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes. Overall, it was a great experience.

<Title>“A great stay at the Sheraton!”
<Content>Just got back from staying 4 nights at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We didn't want to leave! Yes, this is a hotel across from the airport. No, it does not feel like it! The location actually couldn't be better! Not only are the views breathtaking, but it's so close to everything! Seaworld is 10 minutes away. The zoo is 10 minutes away. Coronado is 10 minutes away. Downtown is 5 minutes away. We did not hear the airport noise unless we opened our balcony and we faced the airport. The service couldn't have been better. The valet was quick and friendly, the concierge and check-in staff were also super helpful and friendly. We loved that there was a full Starbuck's on site. We went to starbuck's every morning and got coffee and they have these awesome breakfast sandwiches (bacon, egg and cheese, etc). Nice to get a quick cheap meal before heading out for the day. I go running almost every day while I am there. I love running by the water and seeing the beauty of Harbor island. Great area to run! Did not use the fitness center on this trip, but have used it in the past and found it to be quite nice. One pool is heated and even though it was December, we saw people swimming in it. Very nice pool! The room was great! A perfect size for my husband and I, plus our 2 year old and his pack-n-play. Bathroom was nothing special....Not too fond of the stark white tile, but it wasn't horrible. Amenities were nothing luxurious either. Bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. Overall, the room was probably 3-4 star (mostly because of bathroom), but I felt the Hotel and location and views made this more of a true 4 to 4.5 star property. For the price....$120 a night.... this is a top notch hotel in San Diego! You would expect it to be more expensive. Love that it isn't!

<Title>“San Diego Bay”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel Christmas Eve while visiting the Rock church and the Zoo. Just a few minutes drive from the Zoo. I booked the room on a last minute deal and got the room for 1/2 price. This is a fantastic place! We choose a Bay view rm. It had an awesome view of the city and was spectacular at night. Our rm. was also awesome, with a balcony overlooking the Bay and city. We were able to leave the slider open at night. Bath rm. was exceptional and the bed was perfect for a good night sleep. They also provided a coffee maker with starbucks coffee, (not often seen in a hotel rm.) They also have a Starbuck in the lobby,(I didn't have to drive for my morning fix!) The only negitive was the parking lot. Paid $10 per day and had to walk past the paved lot to a gravel lot way to the rear of the building. Sort of what you might expect at a truck stop! I left only because of the loudness of the airport and the smell of jet fuel in the morning.

<Content>Spent 3 nights in room 726 in the new tower. Terrific stay. Beautiful terrace overlooking the marina. Very nice room with very clean lines. Great shower. Concierge was very helpful. Housekeeping was top notch. Great hotel on the water and within a half a mile of the airport. The planes can be loud but the sight of them taking off and landing so closely was a fun aspect of our stay. Top notch exercise equipment in 24 hour gym. Self park was $22 a day but easy. We'd very likely stay here again. Nice, large waterfront pool as well.

<Title>“this is a motel at best”
<Content>We travel a lot and this is the worst *4-star* we ever stayed in. We arrived around 10pm and were assigned to the Lanai area, which turns out to be just a fancy name for a motel (or even worse -- at least a motel won't charge $22 per day for parking). Sink doesn't drain water. Half an hour after calling front desk for locking the minibar (as we have a small kid), nobody showed up. When we called again, they said it was already done! Unbelievable. Constantly loud noise from airplanes. And when we looked at the in-room breakfast menu, someone already checked items for us! Apparently they didn't bother to check and replace it. This is a bad spot on our otherwise wonderful holiday vacation. Don't book this hotel.

<Title>“NO HOT WATER, INTERNET BROKEN, WACKY A/C”
<Content>I am not one of those hotel guests that ever complains about a hotel, and I stay in about 30 nights a year. However, I feel compelled to write about my recent stay at this hotel. I never had an unplesant experience at a hotel ever. It all started the day after I checked in. That morning I had NO hot water. None whatsoever, not even warm or room temperature water, just COLD water. I took a nice cold shower! Then I went to the front desk and I got moved to a new room on the 6th floor. I was staying in the Bay tower. Then the water in the new room was not working either.I was then moved AGAIN to a new room, finally to room 697. Finally I got working hot water. The mechanic said the entire wing of rooms on the 6th floor lost hot water due to the line going into most of the rooms. The first night during my stay I couldn't sleep at all, The A/C in the room kept turning off when the room temperature reached 65. It's hard for me to sleep in complete silence! I need the A/C to stay on! I never experienced a hotel's A/C system that doesn't let the customer keep the thing ON! The next day I had to call a mechanic, and he eventually performed some "super duper" A/C thermostat tricks and found a way to put the system to 60. and it stayed ON and cold, finally! Why this hotel doesn't let guests have this simple ability is beyond me. The fun doesn't stop here, the next night in my stay I couldn't get the internet to work on my computer. I called tech support. The mechanic had to come to my room and replace not just the cable cord, but the modem to! Who knows why, but after they replaced all of the defective equipment I finally got online. However this hotel is special! You get to choose 2 speeds! One is the regular speed at like $11, and other is an absurd price of $20 (high speed). I opted for the regular speed and took a chance. BIG MISTAKE! The speed has been the slowest speed of ANY hotel I have every stayed at! It was slow, almost like dialup internet access slow. It was probably like DSL or slower. It was sad. It was so sloooow I got so frustrated I turned my Android phone into a mobile hotspot, and guess what my Tmobile data speed was much faster than the hotel's internet speed, This hotel needs just to offer one speed, and get rid of their slow speed. However with all of the negative experiences I had at this place there were some positives to note: PLUSES: Room services, it was pretty tasty and I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail, and spicy buffalo wings. However, the chicken tenders tasted like cardboard, it was horrible. View: it's gorgeous. I felt so relaxed and peaceful here. And I enjoyed watching the christmas boat light parade as well. Room itself and bed: the bed was pretty comfy, and the room was appointed nice. I used the mini bar a lot, and thought it was convinient even though it is pricey. Anyways I am rating my stay only 2 stars because the negatives of my experience far outweighted the positives. I hope this hotel fixed their hot water issues, and also please fix your ridicolous internet speeds and only offer 1 speed. And let guests FULLY control their A/C. Thank you.

<Title>“A good basic hotel, with a great location”
<Content>Good location, at 10 minutes from the airport by walking. Comfortable and with a nice view. There is some limitations however to access this hotel by public system transportation, you must walk a good distance. Complimentary shuttle services are good reliable option. Showers lack of hot water at some hours during the morning. Also there is not free internet at the lobby, where most hotels do. The have a good green campaign which they also reward in beverages. The best option to stay next to the airport.

<Title>“Much better than the reviews.... Good business/meeting hotel”
<Content>I was staying at the Sheraton Marina hotel on business as I had to attend some global company meetings there so I did not have much choice on the location however I did want to make sure I had the right room (following the reviews of this site). I can confirm that I stayed in the Marina Tower (which is the main hotel where the Spa and Starbucks are) on the 11th floor in a delux room and it was perfect for one. The room was a little on the small side but I had a kingbed and the room was well equiped with all the normal extras including a Starbuck coffee machine. Check in was efficient (unfortunately check out was slow with what appeared to be a trainee...). Used the spa a couple of times (early in the morning) and had massages with Gary who was great! Meeting room facilities were good and the catering for the meeting was above average. Overall a great business hotel (apart from lack of wifi in the room...)

<Title>“Sheraton plus”
<Content>The check in was lovely. Arriving by the airport shuttle was a fantastic surprise (we had not asked at the time of booking - while at the airport we seen the 'sheraton' labelled shuttle free YES) lovely. The hotel lobby was so nice and open and fresh. The lady at the desk was wonderful. Really polite, and offered tips on our stay - what we were doing and went out of her way to help us with our check in. When I asked about allergies and restaurants, this lady went out of her way to provide us with the most accurate answer possible. Further since we were on our anniversary, and booking in early (which was some 5 hours earlier due to an earlier flight than expected) this lady checked and re-checked to give us a lovely king bed room (not queen) :)- it was appreciated. The staff overall were fantastic - the layout of the hotel was lovely. Would stay again

<Title>“Nice Hotel; Great Location”
<Content>This is a nice hotel, five minutes from the airport, with clean, large and comfortable rooms. The location is between the marinas and the bay with great views from every room. A group of three guys stayed there for the weekend that the America's Cup 45's were racing in San Diego bay. They were very accommodating and gave us a room on the eighth floor, overlooking the bay so we could watch the races from the balcony. There was plenty of room for the rollaway bed they provided free of charge. We had breakfast in the very nice restaurant down stairs, and while it was $20, the food and service was good.

<Title>“Nice hotel, close to the airport, great service”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at the Bay Tower of this Sheraton over the week of Thanksgiving in 2011. The hotel is nice, has a lot of space, and is quiet. The rooms are basic but nice, including a couch and coffee table area to sit (Tip: The Bay Tower has larger rooms than those in the Marina Tower, which don't have the couch and extra space). The bathrooms need some updating: there's no fan and the sundries are generic. The views overlooking the marina are nice. The hotel is very close to the airport and is convenient for that reason. The service at the hotel was great. Anything we needed they brought immediately and were very accomodating. They unfortunately do not have cribs available if you're travelling with an infant, as we were, but that's a specific need. Overall, not a luxury hotel, but an affordable and decent place to stay.

<Title>“The Place You Want To Be When In San Diego”
<Content>Awesome locale on the marina located literally across from the airport and the Oil Lamp District and Old Town within sight. Beautiful, balmy weather for a stroll along the marina. Rooms are top-notch and excellently maintained by a professional and engaging staff. Wonderful amenities such as the excercise room and pool, club lounges, and superb restaurant. Outstanding conference rooms available with a well-trained and equipped staff to help make for successful conferences. Though close to the airport with hotel shuttles available, be sure to rent a car and visit the many wonderful sights that San Diego and outlying areas have to offer. The Oil Lamp Disrict. Old Town, Sea World, San Diego Zoo & Wildlife Park, the Birch Aquarium at Scripps, and more!

<Content>Having lived in San Diego for years before I moved to Chicago, I know this hotel very well. Traveling on business, I have stayed here a few times over the past years, and never once been disappointed. It is an excellent place for a business meeting or conference, and located so very well to jump in a car or a cab and go out for dinner and a relaxing evening with family once the meetings are done! Superb service makes it such a joy, and you don't have to worry about doing good business while staying at this hotel, and also having your family very happy to be along, too!

<Title>“Got married here, they gave us a free room, called it a "suite"”
<Content>So there is nothing really WRONG with the individual pieces of this hotel at a glance.... The premises are nice, the rooms are clean, it's close to the airport. BUT, when you start adding it all up and looking at it as a total package, that's when the criticism comes in... I married my wife here in August 2011. Overall, I was very happy with their wedding packages. For only 105$ per person we got a great buffet dinner, 4 HOURS OF OPEN BAR (yay!) and someone who somewhat was a wedding coordinator. I really have no complaints about the wedding stuff. Everything went great, the staff were very helpfule with the setup. The only thing is that some stuff went missing, but that could have been our guests for all I know. Or an honest mistake, and could have gotten thrown away. The room they threw in was really two adjoining rooms and they just opened the door. Hardly a suite by any definition. They were nice rooms, but not a suite. If you get married here, make sure to dicuss that. The nice thing is that we ended up with a view of the bay. Either side of the hotel is not bad, pretty much all the views are good. Also, they charge for parking. If you are the bride and groom, you can get comped, but they will charge all of your guests, and parking is not cheap. If you get married here, they have some pretty good opportunities for photos. We took ours with the San Diego skyline in the background. If you are NOT getting married here then this hotel is ok if you are on business and have a car. Like I said, rooms are clean, etc, but there is not a coffee shop nearby, or a breakfast place, and room service is expensive. If you are in SD to have a good time, I'd suggest staying in Little Italy or the Gaslamp. The Gaslamp will be noisier, but is closer to fun bars/clubs. Little Italy is also fun, but a bit quieter, better for a family. This hotel is 3-5 miles from the Gaslamp and harbor tours, not great if you are here trying to see stuff. But if your goal is to be close to the airport, and you have no desire to leave the room, this hotel might be right for you. Even though room service is expensive, they have alternate options for dining close by. There are some restaurants on harbor island that are withing half mile to a mile away. Email me with questions, I know lots about this stuff!

<Title>“Fantastic vacation”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here as starwood members for five nights seeking romance, great location, and a beautiful hotel. This location was excellent right near the airport BUT we did not here the airplanes once. We were upgraded to the club core lounge and our room was on the top floor with an AMAZING view of the bay. Do not listen to the reviews below, this was a beautiful hotel, great location to see sites and right near the gas lamp district. We did some sight seeing to Disneyland (1.5 hour drive) and safari (45 minutes). The hotel is right near the zoo, balboa park, and sea world. I'd highly recommend a car. The hotel was incredibly clean, the staff was wonderful, especially the concierge who helped us plan day trips (thank-you Chantelle). We are 100% satisfied and so thankful for an amazing and romantic getaway!

Never saw the maids but rooms were cleaned efficiently daily on our 4 night stay. Restaurants were a bit pricey but the food was very good. The property has excellent views of the marina and property is located to downtown. Great Experience.

<Content>This review if for the Bay Tower. The Bay Tower has it's own check in desk and it is located around the corner from the main towers. The rooms are fairly large for a standard room and my room had a large balcony facing the bay. It is located across from the airport but I didn't seem to notice the sounds of the planes. It's about a $12 taxi ride to the Gas Lamp District/Convention Center.

<Content>LOVED the Sheraton San Diego! Each room had a small balcony with two chairs and a table. Mine overlooked a marina and San Diego Bay! WONDERFUL! All the accommodations were great. Food was good, staff excellent. The conference rooms were neither too hot or too cold (first time ever in my experience) but were "just right". The doors to individual rooms did not SLAM every time someone came or went (but closed well) as in most places, and the curtains truly did keep out the light and the noise. I'd go back in a minute.

<Title>“Beautiful views, inconvenient location.”
<Content>I will definitely remember the gorgeous view of the marina at night, sunrise, all day long. The free shuttle to the airport is great, and from there, you can catch the $5 all-day bus that goes all over the city. Being close to the airport is important, because this place is not close to ANYTHING else. Plan to bus or taxi everywhere unless you have a car. The taxis are not cheap in SD, and public transportation is slow and circuitous. There are several hotel restaurants, with about the same food in all. We thought the place was rather pricey for being so isolated, but this is an expensive town.

<Title>“Ok, but not worth the price, and certainly not for leisure travelers”
<Content>Look, this place is nice, and the staff for the MOST part is friendly, HOWEVER, if you are not staying here for business, i recomend you do NOT stay Here. The biggest problem i had/AM HAVING, is PARKING. Okay, so in san diego, you can expect to pay for parking almost everywhere, including hotels with high rates like this place; im not going to hold that against them. What i WILL hold against them, is that on the third night i was here (today actually) we left to go to Sea World and to sight see, and came back exhausted, only to find out the side of the parking lot that we had been parking, at (WHICH WE HAD TO PAY FOR MIND YOU)was closed for some highly irritating event. we ended up having to park on the other side furthest from our room, and while the walk was not too horrible, it was not short either, and add to that being exhausted, and having to park in a crappy place after paying a fairly high amount for parking ($22 PER night), i was NOT happy. But what ensures that i will NOT stay here again, is that NOBODY SAID OR POSTED ANYTHING...ANYTHING about this event, and about that portion of the parking lot being closed. And if they did it must have been like a few minutes before the event. Certainly not the night before, not on their website, and no one at the front dest brought it to our attention, at any point. Had we been informed we would have at LEAST been ready to walk a bit and plan accordingly on our sightseeing trip. Add to that the parking staff outside taking an attitude of hostility to us when we inquired as to why we could not park where we had been, and why nothing had been posted about it. Very rude. We did not as a result bother going out to eat, out of worrying about dealing with parking...great way to end a trip. Im not a person who generally holds hotels to unreasonable standards, but for the price paid, and the parking that i paid for (even if just self parking), i think i should have been informed somehow that parking would be a mess on my last night, so i could have planned accordingly and i dont think i should have had to have delt with snotty rude parking attendants. When the manager was approached about the parking situation, he told me quite clearly that parking PARKING SPACES ARE NOT GUARANTEED...but said he THOUGHT there should'nt be a problem. I honestly think it is unprofessional for a hotel to not know its own capacity, or amount of people coming to an event. The manager did offer to valet the car free of charge, bit it still put a cramp on our trip All in all the place is NOT worth the price paid...they charge for virtually everything, and paying for self parking does in no way (unless you pay more for valet) guarantee a spot...something that was not made clear at booking. If you are here for leisure they will not care about your experience. Their special events clearly are more important than the experience for an individual average joe guest; i dont hold it against them; they are a business and big events make them money, but just be aware of this. For the price, unless you are here on Business i would not recomend staying here. The location IS good (if you have a car) but again parking isn't guaranteed even though they do charge you. Check-in staff are very friendly and helpful but the parking staff is hit and miss. The main reason i cant recommend this hotel, is because its lack of consideration of guests who pay for parking, by failing to inform them clearly of events that may cause issues leaving or arriving

<Title>“Wish our 2 Nights were 20 !”
<Content>We were attending a family wedding, and our room had been established for us for One night, we added a night to just relax after the wedding and take in the beauty of the area. Upon checking in, actually I asked for a convienent choice of rooms (handicapped). I was given choices, and the one I took without hesitation, was downstairs; with smooth step out on the patio/lawn & harbor view, which brought you to a concrete walkway. It was totally an awesome experience, at that particular location. Ate at the Buffet for Breakfast; excellent, with numerous multiple choices. Good Table service, for approx. 20 of us seated. We also went into the special, separate Bar area to have a drink, and take in the elevated night time view of the harbor. Everything flowed. The staff was excellent & helpful. We spoke with various groups of folks, especially one Educational Youth Group, well groomed...enjoying their stay also. Just an overall happy experience for everyone. Oh, I almost forgot, we spent an entire afternoon sitting around the beautiful pool with other family members....another lovely experience. We went into the gym area, excellent equipment. Entire Parking VERY full, but with our handicap plates, were able to park convienent to our room. [It Was a weekend!] Easy access to downtown San Diego; the Harbor; Beach Cities; of course, the Airport is across the road (but not a noise issue). And just being ON Harbor Isld. is a pleasure in itself. Would definitely repeat our visit/experience. Having good weather doesn't hurt either !!

<Title>“Great place to stay for MCRD graduation”
<Content>My son graduated from the Marine Corps on Novemeber the 4th. I scoured the internet looking for the best deal for the whole family to be able to go. I was concerned when after much comaprison shopping I booked a flight and stay at this hotel with savings of over 1,100 for our party! (What was I going to get?). When we landed I saw our hotel. It is very near the airport and also very close to the reason for our trip Marine Corps Recruit Depot. We stayed in the bay tower portion of the hotel. The lobby was clean and desk help was exceptional! They informed us that the package we booked included breakfast all the days of our stay as well as a free shuttle to and from MCRD This by itself was a fantastic bonus! We asked for a higher floor and rather than bay view, we chose the marina view. Decorated in a nautical theme; the rooms were very clean, the beds comfortable, had an amply stocked mini bar and a large balcony to enjoy San Diegos beautiful weather and watch all the boats sail. The hotel was close enough to either take a taxi to Old Town for some sight seeing (which we really enjoyed)..or rent a car..which we also did..and took the short drive over to Coronado Island had some fantastic pizza, a little shopping and played on the beach. After graduation my son was never so happy to see a soft bed or hot tub in in his life! We really enjoyed the nice pool facilities. In short our trip was great . We got a great price on a clean comfortable room in San Diego near everything we needed to do and wanted to see!

<Title>“It is what it is, an expense account hotel near the airport”
<Content>We were in San Diego for a conference which was held at the Sheraton. It is a large, sprawling hotel (> 1,000 rooms) with a couple of towers and a sprawling ‘resort’ wing called Lanai . There is also a second tower (350 rooms) which is about a 10 minute walk along the marina from the main hotel. We were put in the ‘Lanai’, a wing that if you squint your eyes a little you would think is a Mexican Resort Hotel complete with aqua painted pools, palm trees and outdoor type ‘hall ways’. The main difference from Mexican resorts are the hot tubs associated with each pool and reliable hot water in the rooms. Our room was nice enough, it had been tastefully updated in the last several years so everything, except the bathtub, which hotels seem reluctant to update, was new. The tub was a little worn and corroded around the drain. The marble sink counter was also stained, a problem I have seen in other hotels with marble counter tops. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet except when the folks upstairs were moving around. In the tradition of expense account hotels things like WiFi and internet ($20/day) and parking ($30/day) cost extra not to mention the exorbitant cost of the contents of the mini bar, the restocking fees of the minibar and the fact that you can’t use the minibar fridge for your own stuff. In addition the restaurant/breakfast buffet were expensive for what you got. That said the service was great, check in was fast, there is a shuttle that runs every ten minutes from the airport. If you are just flying in and out to a conference and you are on an expense account it is a great place to be. If you want to see the city, which is definitely worth seeing, then this hotel is definitely a bit out of the way, about a $15- 20 taxi ride. Public transportation in the vicinity of the hotel is negligible. The waterfront tourist attractions are about 3 miles away but there is a nice wide promenade type sidewalk between Harbour Drive, a main thorough fare, and the water if you are up to walking. So it wasn’t a great location for a spouse along for the trip as was our case. The hotel also seems to be a bit of a staging place for folks who are going and coming from cruise ships. Probably it works well for them. I will definitely return to San Diego with my wife but next time I will stay on one of the many downtown hotels where we can really enjoy what this fine city has to offer visitors.

<Title>“This really should say : SHERATON AIRPORT HOTEL”
<Content>If you are looking for a family vacation resort, this is NOT for you. You have to drive through the airport to get to this hotel, which is IMMEDIATELY adjacent to the airport. We made the mistake of not carefully studying the map before booking this hotel. With that said, we got a Marina suite, which is very spacious, comes with 2 large flat screen TVs, 2 closets, but the bathroom was EXTREMELY small. We have 2 balconies that faces the harbor, and the view is breathtaking. Nothing is walking distance from the hotel, so you would have to drive or take a shuttle. The upgrade to club access is well worth it since they do serve breakfast and afternoon snacks. You do hear planes flying above as they takeoff and land, but it's not overwhelmingly disturbing. The sleep quality is poor. It's the type of mattress where as soon as you get on or off, you can hear the springs compress or decompress. Overall, although this hotel is "cheaper" than the other Starwood hotels nearby, considering it's close proximity to the airport and what you are getting, staying at the W, Westin, or US Grant will get you more bang for the buck.

I recently stayed at your hotel for one night, but when checking out to catch the flight to my next destination, I forgot my blue tooth device and charger, still plugged into the wall. I realized it upon arriving at my next destination and immediately called your Security / Lost & Found Department. Nicolas very kindly retrieved my "left behind item," packaged it up and sent it to my home, after allowing me to select the mode/cost of delivery which would best suit my needs. Thank you, Nicolas, for going above and beyond! I can't tell you how impressed I am, nor how many people I shared my story with! Keep up the excellent service!!

<Title>“Close access to the airport”
<Content>The hotel itself is rather nice. The only bummer is location for tourists. To use public transport you first get the hotels shuttle to the airport and then transfer to the local bus which can be time consuming.

<Title>“Great location and service”
<Content>This hotel is beautiful, if you want to relax, it's quiet, the marina is beautiful, and the best thing if you want to explore San Diego's attractions, everything is within walking distance. We took the boat cruise for see lions watching and it was really nice! One beautiful beach is 5 min from the hotel, but you can enjoy at the pool if you don't feel to go anywhere. The staff is friendly and helpful. We will stay again for sure here.

<Title>“Lots of hidden gems - great meeting hotel”
<Content>This was my second stay in the last two years and though I'm usually not a huge Sheraton fan I really like this property a lot. Both times I was there for conventions and as others note the hotel is across the road from the airport and a ways from downtown. Since my partner and I walk this wasn't a huge issue. We simply walked the couple of miles downtown, a lovely walk, and took taxis to Balboa Park and Old Town. Within walking distance of the hotel are two restaurants, C-Level and Island Prime, that are consistent winners for us. On to the hotel. Check-in was a breeze. We arrived almost two hours early and just walked into a room, very nice. The property includes a few different buildings and I think may include some longer term and time share units in places. The Marina Tower is in the main part of the hotel. The Bay Tower is a bit of a stroll across the marina. We've only stayed in the Marina Tower and have been glad we did given its proximity to the restaurant, etc. We've eaten at the restaurant, service was good and food just ok. Quinn's, the on site tavern and eatery seems to have better food and has a decent selection of draft beers and nice ambiance (overlooks the marina and pool, or you can watch sports on any of a number of tvs). There are 3 tennis courts that we used every day and in two visits I don't think I've ever seen anyone else use them. Good condition, decent courts. There are two swimming pools and two hot tubs. We tended to like the smaller hot tub near the tennis courts. Unfortunately both the pools and hot tubs close at 10pm. The first time we stayed here, just over a year ago, that closing time was strictly enforced so even though we were a quiet couple in our 50's just relaxing we got chased. This time when 10pm and the guards rolled around we were sharing the hot tub with a pretty rowdy group of Canadians who successfully lobbied for one more 15 minute round in the tub. I thought it was an improvement for the guards to give folks a break. Re the rooms, they're very comfortable, not new but not run down either. The bathroom was nice though we had an issue with the bathroom sink draining slowly. We reported it and it was fixed immediately - then we were given a $50 "experience adjustment" credit for our trouble. We used it at the gift shop. Frankly I attribute that to the power of media like TripAdvisor - to avoid a bad review, and sure enough here I am recommending the hotel rather than whining about a slow sink. A couple other gems here - there are two fire pits by the marina that are just plain cool, and rocking chairs suitable for just relaxing by the fire. This property has lots of spaces for couples to just drift hand in hand. The grounds are well maintained and it's an expansive property. We took cabs to Balboa Park and Old Town, about $15 each way each time, and walked downtown. Other friends at the same convention also walked downtown - though all of us are walkers, we're also all in our 50's and 60's so don't be too afraid to take it on. Leaving - nothing is easier. Free airport shuttle. Oh re the meeting rooms, etc., standard hotel issue. With the exception of the main banquet the food was unremarkable, however, at our main lunch banquet everything was a notch above usual conference food (a wonderful tomato cream soup served hot for example). When you're traveling with the love of your life it's easy to find things to enjoy, and with the combination of this hotel and San Diego we had a wealth of wonders to choose from.

<Title>“As expected....”
<Content>Sheratons are usually quite good, and this one lives up to expectations. The rooms are nice and most have harbor or marina views. The airport is convenient. Negatives are expensive parking and limited internet connection. There is free wifi in the lobby, but wired internet connection in the room (and not free). I didn't consider the hotel restaurants to be anything special, but excellent dining is available short driving distances away. While the hotel is quite nice, I consider it to be overpriced, as are the other hotels on Harbor Island. A good place to stay, particularly if you are on an expense account:-)

<Content>The SHERATON SAN DIEGO HOTEL & MARINA was the venue for a recent conference that colleagues and i attended. This hotel was first rate in all aspects and the staff were attentive and helpful at all times. The catering was superb and the bar had a lively and comfortable atmosphere, one of the best! If you want a trouble free enjoyable stay then this is the place to go.

<Title>“You're in the Ourskirts Conventioner; Deal With It”
<Content>You are going to the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina only because your company sent you there for a convention or meeting. You arrive and discover it's a friendly place with great accomodations and you are near the aiport. How convenient. But you are dismayed to learn you are away from the action of lovely San Diego and restricted, for meals, to the hotel's two restaurants -- a pub that is reasonably priced but cacaphonous and crowded and a luxurious but overpriced restaurant. You would like to see the sights of Dan Diego but you dont want to rent a car because your down time is restricted to evenings and periods when you are not in convention sessions. Here's how we dealt with it. 1. We requested the pub menu in the restaurant, so we got less expensive meals in refined surroundings. 2. If you are willing to stroll, you can go to three other resturants at the marina. We recommend the closest one, Island Prime, particularly its less expensive wing, Level C, It has a great view of the skyline and the service is friendly. They have a good wine tasting option and the Mud Pie ice cream is to die for (and big enough for six people). 3. Downtown San Diego is a $15 cab ride away including generous tip. But the best option is the inexpensive one. Take the Sheraton Shuttle to the airport and ask the driver to leave you at the MTS bus stop. The 923 bus goes to downtown San Diego ($2.25 per ride, $1.10 for seniors over 60). Once downtown you are in the Gaslight District and you can connect to other buses, including ones we took to Coronado and Balboa Park. 4. We loved Balboa Park. You can spend a whole day there at the zoo and museums. If you want to stretch your legs there are trails alongside. The whole experience is better than Epcot in our opinion. (For lunch try the Japanese Garden restaurant. Teryaki meat, fish and vegeratian over rice are yummy. $11 each with drinks) 5. The Gaslight District has terrific restaurants. A local shopkeeper recommended "La Strada" 702 5th Street and we had a great meal. The linguini with clams was fabulous. 6. Take the 201 bus from downtown to Coronado and stroll around the Del Coronado Hotel, a national landmark.

<Title>“Beautiful Shoreline Hotel”
<Content>My husband, son, and I stayed at this hotel over July 4th. It is just a few minutes from the San Diego Airport, but not in direct line with the runways, so there was no jet noise. It is also right on the water, and with a room facing the water, we had a fantastic view of the fireworks that night. It had easy access and was convenient for driving to other areas of San Diego. I especially liked the way the room was set up. The bed FACED the windows instead of being sideways to the windows like in most hotels, so you could sit in bed at night and look at the lights. The room was spotless as was the rest of the property, and the landscaping surrounding the hotel was very nice. If I remember correctly, there was also a sidewalk between the hotel and water that you could walk around the marina on. Depending on when you stay, and if you have AAA or some other discount plan, you can get a reasonable price for this hotel. At other times, the price can be double. We are going on a cruise in December and I was anxious to book this hotel again for our pre-cruise stay. However, there is a convention going on that week and when I first checked it out, the price had skyrocketed. The second time I checked, there were no rooms available. The only reason I am giving this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is not within walking distance to restaurants, and the hotel restaurant is pricey, as expected. We did go ahead and eat breakfast at the restaurant which was excellent, but again, it was not a "breakfast included" type of hotel and the cost for breakfast was about $15 per person, I think. But as I said, I did love this hotel and would stay there again. And for those who aren't budget minded, this is definitely a hotel you will love.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights for business conference. Rooms were spacious and ours had small balcony with seating for 2. Beautiful views from room, we were on the 11th floor. Sheraton's have the best beds and bedding. Slept like a rock (or baby, whichever your view) each time. So comfy. We were in Marina tower which is great since it's the first one the shuttle driver stops at. Great to have free shuttle from airport to hotel. Water pressure in room needs some work but overall not bad, just not great. Check-in staff were really nice and allowed us to check in early, we were really excited as we only had the afternoon to be real tourist. Down side to this hotel and location - there is nothing around it - no restaurants, no public transportation. If you wanted to go anywhere you needed to use taxi's and they were expensive. The public transportation in SD needs help. We use the trolley (train) and bus system. Neither transportation types were user friendly even with assistance from transportation employees. You definitely need a car if staying here. Would be a great hotel if you wanted something close to airport or cruise lines. Ate lunch in restaurant on site one day and it was expensive for ok food. Had dinner in bar/grill one night and it expensive and better than restaurant. There is a deli within walking distance at the marina that does a great job of making sandwiches.

<Title>“tired hotel next to airport”
<Content>My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at the Sheraton while attending a conference. After a 60 second drive from the airport (yes, it is that close!), we checked into our room on the 9th floor. The lobby of the hotel was nice, although very busy with people attending a variety different conferences. The hallway to our room was scattered with leftover room service items. Our room was small, which was fine. The bathroom was recently redone. It sadly had no place to hang towels so when finished with them, we just set them on the floor. The shower curtain smelled like mildew. All the rooms have small balconies with a view of the water or downtown but if you open the balcony door you are bombarded with sound of jets landing and taking off. The outside of the property was nice, with several pools and a walking path. All in all, it is a very average convention hotel next to the airport.

<Content>Stayed here recently and found everything thing to be very nice. Easy shuttle pick-up/drop-off at airport, very friendly staff, clean room with a great view of the harbor. I have stayed here in the past for both business and quick San Diego weekend getaways and have never been disappointed. Will definately stay here again, especially when chartering a boat as it is a short 3 minute walk to the docks.

<Title>“Too many extra costs”
<Content>I will try to be objective and review this hotel fairly, though I was quite annoyed at how much this hotel tries to rob you at every opportunity. The check-in staff were polite. We were informed on check-in of a $30 a night parking fee (our stay was 4 nights), and when I inquired about how to access in-room internet they told me it was $19 a night for high speed internet. High speed internet was crap, it was less than a quarter of the speed of the internet I got at the Trump in Las Vegas. We were given two vouchers for complimentary breakfast for our stay, for which we were very grateful, though once we were seated in the restaurant and given menus we weren't quite sure what we were allowed to choose from. This was soon cleared up when someone came and took the menus back and said that we could only eat from the buffet. After eating the 'buffet' once, we decided not to use the second voucher. The room also has a fridge, but only for the rip off minibar, you weren't allowed to use it. Not only did it quote exorbitant prices on the mini bar it also had a RESTOCKING fee in the fine print. How does get buggered sound? I'm not going to pay $5 for a small drink and then pay you 20% extra just to restock it. The room itself was reasonable and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was a bit grubby though In all honesty I probably wouldn't have paid attention to this things had the hotel not been charging me extras at every opportunity, I found myself picking on things in the room just because they were being cheap. What sort of hotel doesn't have complementary in room internet these days??? Given that the last day of our USA trip was to be spent at this hotel before we drove to LAX, we decided that with the $30 parking fee and $19 internet per day in our room we'd be better off just finding a cheap room in Anaheim on our last nights stay so we were closer to the airport on the last day. We checked out early even though we had already paid for the room for the night and spend what we saved on ridiculous fees on a room in Anaheim.

<Title>“Not the best stay I've had”
<Content>I spent 3 nights in the Lanai section of this sprawling hotel. Problems began with the inadequate map and directions i was given for finding my room. Then the closet door was off its tracks and hard to open and the bathroom fan was incredibly noisy. The sliding glass door to the balcony was also very hard to move. The finishing touch was hair all over the bathroom wall, apparently from a previous occupant's hair drying session. I was there for a meeting (great conference facilities and excellent food) and got charged $100 for an early checkout when the meeting ended early. I never saw or heard another person in the wing I was in so I don't think there was a great demand for rooms. The sign saying I'd be charged $25 if I stored personal items in the minifridge added to the overall impression that this hotel does not go out of its way to make guests happy. Don't expect free internet or a welcome bottle of water.

<Title>“Very accommodating, clean, right on harbor.”
<Content>My wife and I have stayed here a couple of times during a business convention I had. Great location on the harbor. Both times, we got a room in the bay tower, harbor side, high floor. These rooms are equipped with balconies that overlook the harbor and the air force base. The sound of the helicopters didn't bother me at all during the day, but I did hear some people complaining about it. I found it very interesting to watch their training everyday. Nice rooms and very clean. Some need updating but clean nonetheless. Grounds are easy to get around on and there are little cafe's and bars and breakfast places within and around the hotel. The staff is very accommodating and prompt with special requests. Just a great place in a great city!

<Content>I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference. My options were to stay in the main hotel where the convention center is, or stay in the tower. Knowing that I would be sitting all day at conferences, I chose the tower which is a block away. I was very happy with my choice. The rooms are updated, modern, and clean. The staff, from the bellboys to the front desk, are friendly and helpful. Great experience overall.

<Title>“Marina Sheraton - one of our favorite hotels”
<Content>We have stayed here often; and still choose it because of the beautiful views from all sides. The club level Yacht club is amazing; bright and welcoming for breakfast with views of the city and the bay, the bridge to Coronado, and flights arriving to the nearby airport. At night the city is lit up like a jewelled necklace; very pretty. The rooms all have views; our preference is an end room with city view becuase we love to watch the planes arrive flying low over the city. Great area for walking around the marina; or riding bikes. It is quiet and beautiful and you can walk a mile or 8 miles; all in a safe and pretty area along the water. The food at club level was very good, attractive and crisp fruits and veggies; pita chips and hummus, small empanadas; well planned. You can order a cocktail in the club which is a plus in a place with as good a view as this I love being able to have a nice drink before going down to dinner. As usual great bed & bedding - which is why we stay with SPG. overall it is always a great experience here.

<Title>“There are much better options”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this Sheraton on the last night of our trip to San Diego, before flying out the next morning. During the previous four nights of our trip we stayed in a WONDERFUL hotel right in downtown San Diego. The price of this Sheraton vs. the downtown hotel were virtually the same, so I expected the same quality hotel & experience. Boy, was I wrong. First of all, the Sheraton is out on Harbor Island, a strip of land that is apparently still being deveoped for tourists and doesn't contain much of anything except for a few hotels. We were dropped off at the hotel by a cab driver around 5PM and literally felt STRANDED for the rest of the evening. There are two restaurants inside the Sheraton, both of which are offensively overpriced. We left the hotel in search of food, and after walking over a mile, found a gas station-like store that sold prepackaged sandwiches. We trudged back to the hotel and reluctantly went to the cheaper of the two restaurants inside. We both ordered $16 hamburgers. That would be $16 each. The food was average at best and the service was neglectful at best. Definitely a frustrating venture. Secondly, I'm still confused about this hotel and what part of it we stayed in. The main entrance of the hotel is beuatiful and plush looking. When we checked in, we were instructed to follow a long hallway to the right. At the end of this hallway we stepped into an elevator foyer that looked completely different from the main part of the hotel. The carpet and wallpaper were old and discolored. It was like we all of a sudden were transported to an old motel. Once we reached our floor, it still felt like a motel, not a "nice" hotel - the hallway smelled stale, and there were several room service food trays laying throughout the hallway. Without even entering our room yet, I felt ripped off. I was immediately wishing we had just booked another night at our downtown hotel that was GORGEOUS and equally priced. Along the same lines of this confusing split-personality of the hotel - there are two pools outside. One is luxurious and updated. The other, right next to it, is older and smaller. Our hotel key would not allow access to the nicer pool. We were apparently relegated as "second-class" and were only allowed key access to the smaller pool. This was all VERY confusing and practically embarassing. There were no signs of explanation as to the difference between the two pools that were RIGHT next to each other. I will say that the room itself at the Sheraton was very lovely. It actually felt updated, clean, and new. I loved the color-scheme. Because there was NOTHING to do on Harbor Island, we just got in bed early and watched t.v. for the rest of the night. Overall, I would NOT recommend this hotel if you are in San Diego for more than just a layover. If you do not have a car, cab rides to and from downtown are about $14 each way. Although that is cheaper than a hamburger on Harbor Island, it is not worth the price just to get far enough away from the hotel to find something to do. There are PLENTY of hotels in downtown San Diego that are the exact same price and are INCREDIBLY nicer. Bottom line, this Sheraton isn't terrible, but you can do much better.

<Title>“Close to the airport but not close to anything else”
<Content>This was a nice hotel that is conveniently close to the airport. They even provide free shuttles that leaves pretty much every 15mins. I stayed at the Bay Tower overlooking the bay. It was fun to see the aircraft carriers and military aircrafts on Coronado island. The noise is not too bad. Rooms are fairly modern and spacious. The main Marina tower is good with a full Starbucks. Service was fast and efficient with Taxis always available. The gym and pool was in good shape. The Bay Tower seems dated and more cozy compared to the Marina tower. The hotel is good for a quick stay in San Diego but if you're staying more than 3-4 nights I would suggest you stay downtown as there are more things to see and do. They should look into a shuttle service for quick downtown trips.

<Title>“Post Cruise hotel....near airport, but not much nearby.”
<Content>If you are looking for a lovely place to relax for a DAY in San Diego with immediate airport access, you cannot beat this hotel. It is not cheap, but if you are on business or booked at in conjunction with a cruise or something else, it is worth the money. However.... besides the lovely location and the beautiful walk along the harbor, there is really NOTHING out here and it's a cab ride to any other interesting parts of San Diego.

<Title>“Great for a conference - very good for a stay”
<Content>I went to the Disaster Recovery Journal Expo in San Diego and decided to stay at the conference hotel so that I could pour myself into bed every night! On arriving in San Diego we waited for 30 mins for the shuttle to the hotel, but it never turned up - it was 11 PM though. We ended up getting a cab, not realising it is VERY close to the airport! The cab took us to the wrong section of the hotel, so after a bit of a walk we ended up in the main part of the hotel. Check in was quick and easy, but when we asked about food and drink they told us that the bar was about to close but you could get food there. We therefore skipped going to our rooms and had a few pints of Blue Moon and a steak burger and chips. Apparently since the recession hit there are very few hotels with 24 hour bars in the States - very frustrating! So at midnight I went and found my room, which was on the 11th floor and fell asleep. In the morning I took stock of the room. Two king size beds (nice, just for me!) smart decor, flat TV, coffee maker and reasonable bathroom - shower over bath. Nothing fantastic but all new and stylish. On opening the blackout curtains I had an interesting view of the airport, the carpark and alot of the marina. I love boats so I was happy. You could see a couple of battleships and an aircraft carrier from my room. There was also a little private balcony which was fab for smoking cigars on and for sunbathing - great suntrap! It is MUCH less noosy than one might expect. We had booked club rooms which meant that we had breakfast in the club lounge included. This is great since you get a good continental breakfast in the lounge, which is nice and relaxed with an AMZING view across the marina and out towards the sea. It is quite difficult to actually find and access but worth it when you arrive. One very good thing about the club lounge is that you get free wifi (you only get wired internet in the rooms) so I chatted to Mrs M-B and the kids via Skype and could show off the great views too. The club lounge is quiet and relaxing and if I was not at a conference I would have chilled out there most of the time. We din't eat in the hotel other than on the first night at the sports bar, but we did order many drinks from there. Annoyingly they do not deliver drinks to the outside flame pits where you could chill out in the sun - we had to constantly try and carry trays of drinks through doors and down stairs. They also don't allow glass outside, but we didn't find that out until the last day! The hotel is not exactly in the centere of town but it is very easy to get a cab to where ever you wanted to go, although they did add up eventually. It is nice and quick to get back to the airport (5 mins). If you have things to do, such as conferencing, or sitghtseeing, then this hotel is great. If you booked it just to chill out in the pool, I suspect that you would be a bit bored after the first day. Hopefully I will come back to San Diego, but if I was given the choice and I was a single traveller I would stay at the W Hotel which is more central and funkier.

<Title>“nice hotel near the airport”
<Content>6$ cab ride or free shuttle to airport. Hotel is redone and nice. I was there for conference but saw children and families, navy personnel, weddings, functions and a whole mixture. Nice pool and great fitness facilities. 15$ cab ride to Horton Plaza or Gaslamp area. Conference facilities good. And the staff ... very good in comparison to other Sheraton's this one's a keeper.

<Title>“Great meeting experience”
<Content>I was an attendee at a meeting at the hotel last week and had a great experience. I have stayed at other Starwood products in San Diego previously but never this Sheraton. I thought the Banquet staff were both warm and attentive. All of our needs were met and exceeded in a way most hotels do not. The hotel planned a boat outing for us one evening that all of our attendees greatly enjoyed. My guest room had a small balcony that overlooked the marina, and I enjoyed the view and weather very much. Hotel has all the typical Sheraton amenities like the Sweet Sleeper Bed and Link in the lobby that allowed our attendees to stay connected for free. Great experience for our group event.

<Title>“A very nice hotel.”
<Content>The rooms are very spacious. The bathrooms are a little small but still nice. Just two small things I noticed when we got to our room. There was silverware outside our room and a little hair in the floor and the side of the bathtub. A little more attention to detail by housekeeping would take care of this. Love the balcony with table and chairs looking out over the water. Overall a nice hotel.

<Title>“Very mixed experience”
<Content>We have stayed in this hotel complex twice, and have had very "iffy" experiences here. The property is really well situated if all you care about is being close to the airport, but is poorly located if you want to do anything other than hang around the hotel complex. Both times, our rooms were in serious need of remodel - especially the bathrooms, which were just plain old and yucky. Our most recent stay found us stuck on what amounts to the basement level of the Bay Tower, a building which is completely unacceptable in every way. While the staff, both at the Valet Desk and the Front Desk, were pleasant, they were entirely unhelpful in every respect. The one, hugely Bright Spot was a young Bellman who not only helped us with our luggage at 4:30 AM, but unexpectedly drove us straight over to the airport, rather than making us wait for the hotel's airport shuttle service to get started for the day. Had it not been for that wonderful surprise, I would have given this hotel an even lower rating.

<Title>“Nice if you stay in the main tower!”
<Content>This property has 2 towers about 5 blocks from each other. The Bay Tower has some nice ocean views but it appears to be their overflow hotel and too far from all the amenities of the main building. It looks like they put their guests who have booked discounted rates in this tower. The rooms are big with flat screen tv's, but the bathroom was filthy. Hair in the tub and toothpaste all over the wall. I booked this room through Priceline which includes it with the downtown hotels. It is not a downtown hotel. It is an airport hotel with about a 1 hour walk into the downtown. I walked it! The main property has a nice lobby with lots of free internet stations, a Starbucks, nice dining areas and a beautiful pool.

<Title>“Great hotel for plane watchers”
<Content>I got this hotel on Priceline and was at first annoyed since its included in the downtown area but its all the way over by the airport. But turns out the views from the hotel are great, it looks like its been relatively recently renovated as well. Get a room on a higher floor, half the hotel faces the harbor with great views of Coronado Island and downtown as well as the airport. The other half faces the Marina. I'm a travel nerd so I like watching planes land and had a great view of the runway. Beware of parking since you have to at least pay the self parking rate of $22 there is no free parking around there. Also the rooms have wired internet not wireless.

<Title>“Great Value but can't walk to downtown”
<Content>This hotel always offer great rates and if you are looking to stay near sea world and the bay its a good location. If you are looking to indulge in the nightlife of the gaslamp district you are better off at the W, Hard Rock or the US Grant hotel. This is primarily a tourist hotel for families or a good place to stay if you have a flight out the San Diego airport. The hotel is starting to show its age and is need for an update.

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton due to a conference my wife and i wanted to attend. When registering we paid for a room on a higher floor that promised a view of the harbor and city. When we checked in we were told the rooms were being cleaned and they would call us in a couple of hours to check in. We went site seeing and came back SEVEN hours later, the check in was busy and finally got the bell captain to help us. We were informed they didn't have a upper floor room and we were placed on tthe "fourth" floor - which actually was the 2nd floor overlooking a beautiful gravel roof overhand! Complaints went unanswered until 3 days later when we were finally given a rate adjustment back to the convention rate. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!

<Title>“avoid marina view low numbered rooms”
<Content>I found the rooms to be clean and well serviced, the food as reasonably priced as you would expect and the staff generally personable, but, reversing stacker trucks emptying vehicles and and trash at 5 am wasn't on. You know the sound beep beep beep, on and on... Check in staff asked what i wanted them to do about it! Stop it was appropriate, but they had the glazed expression of those whose neckties were stopping the blood flo to the brain. If you stay here don't take one of those rooms ( i was in 1000 on 10th floor). Check your bill on exit too, both me and a colleague had unaccounted items on the bill. ( it was a convention with a full house so perhaps they should be allowed leeway , but keep a check)

<Title>“Poor value and even poorer service”
<Content>Stayed here for a business trip. Found out after I checked in that parking is $22 per day, added to the room; valet is $30. The main parking is quite far from the entrance - all side entrances are looked and you must walk all the way to the front to enter the hotel. Must use room key to enter and exit parking area. When checking in, your credit card is authorized $200 more than the cost of the room for "incidentals." No exceptions. Not told this in advance either. The hotel staff is less than helpful. Try asking for restaurant recommendations or what to do in San Diego. Better off asking for help from locals outside the hotel. My room, at a conference rate, was $169 per night. Not bad for San Diego, but what do you get? An armchair with a ottoman next to it, a small dresser, a huge with no drawer, two nightables, a small TV, and a very small bathroom. The closet is teeny tiny as well. And no free WI-FI - you have to pay an extra $12 bucks per day. At check in the desk clerk wanted to give me two queen size beds with a city view. Hello...my reservation was for a KING size. What do you know, one was available with a marina view. For that price, it darn well better be a marina view. Will I be back? No way.

<Title>“In every way, an awful place...”
<Content>I had one of my worst hotel experiences at this hotel. Lured by the mention of "billions of dollars in renovations, I expected -- for the money I spent per night, a luxury hotel experience. Let's start with the bathroom - very cramped and the "soaking tub" was a small plastic molded tub that only a child could bathe it. The light switches were put in very crooked. There was, I think, a hole in the wall that had a weird, hand cut plastic sheet over it. It was not enitrely clean and neither was the rest of the room. Weird bed layout had your bed FACING a huge mirror which mean you had not chocie but to see yourself everytime you glanced up from a book if reading in bed or when watching TV. I always test the honesty of hotel staff but leaving a dollar bill on the floor. In the hunderd times before that I had done this, the bill was always neatly placed on a piece of furniure. Not this time. Trash was not removed from my room, and it was very clear from debris on the rug that it wasn't vacuumed. The direct line to room service often did not work; they did not answer, and the front desk would say they would call me back, which they only did 50% of the time. The food was barely passable, and I stayed at a 4 Season in April that charged LESS for really amazing food with such gracious service. I approve of adding a percentage onto the bill automatically so wait staff can be properly tipped, but why was there also an additional $3 food delivery charge added on to the obligatory 16% tip? They advertise their link in service as being this great benefit, but what it means is you need to spend $18 a day for online service in your room or you lug your computer down to the lobby with the worn furniture to work. The ballyhooed TV wake up service did not work at all; thank God I set up a back up with my iPad of I would've missed meetings. I stay at different kinds of hotels -- a month before I stayed at a comfort inn near Olympia, WA, and had a MUCH better experience for MUCH less money. if you are looking for a quality experience, do NOT choose this hotel. They should be ashamed of allving this a luxury hotel.

<Title>“Experience varies”
<Content>This was a great stay, the reason why there are so many mixed reviews is when you get here, you think the hotel is only the one in the main picture; HOWEVER, there are really two hotels here, and your experience will vary greatly depending on which tower you are staying. The main one is clean, spacious, and staff is friendly, I can't speak for the other one, but just read some of the reviews and you'll get an idea. The tower I stayed in had great facilities, room was large and the best part was the views from the balcony, SPG status gets you the floor second to the top and free internet which is wired not wifi. Lounge is on the top floor and key card is needed, status gets you free breakfast, otherwise it's like $14, pretty basic, all continental mostly, cereal, fruit, muffins etc. no hot food. Getting down to the gaslamp cost exactly $13 from the hotel, it's not that bad, but there isn't really anything around, the Westin is a better choice if you want to stay downtown, it's probably a 5min walk to the gas lamp from there. Overall, I was very satisfied with the stay, facility was great, clean, quiet, and spacious, staff was friendly and attentive and the shuttle comes and goes very often, just remember, your stay depends on which tower you stay in, I believe mine was the marina tower and the iffy one is called the bayview tower. You should definitely ask where you'll be put before confirming.

<Title>“Next to airport- literally.”
<Content>This hotel should be a 3 star. The rooms, bed/linens/bathroom- everything are average. It felt like we were driving to the airport and bam -we were at our hotel. Yes we could see planes taking off out our window- so if you like planes this is perfect. I had to request a new room because our bedspread was stained and there was mold in the bathtub. Second room was a downgrade but at least it was clean and they gave us a breakfast voucher. Great bargain if you get it on priceline- but don't buy the rack rate. Overpromise, underdeliver. Btw- Coffee was stale in the room.

<Content>This is the second year my sister and I have stayed in the hotel. Have always found the staff very helpful and they take the time to greet ,make you feel welcome.During this stay San Diego had the power outage. It lasted from about 10 hours. The staff went into motion to see everyone was comfortable during this time. We had breakfast every morning in the resturant. Was greeted by Ronnie who was the resturant manager, he took time fo ask about our visit and let us know about things in the area to do. We also requested the same room we had as the last visit. They did everything to accomdate our stay. Great Hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>“Average but with Security Concerns”
<Content>I stayed at this property on a business trip for a conference. The room was fine and, were I not working most of the time, I might have been able to enjoy the small balcony. The bed was not particularly comfortable and the use of a bottom flat sheet that slipped up from the end uncovering the scratchy mattress pad underneath made for poor sleep quality. The shower was OK - the water was hot but the water pressure was not great. The staff as part of the conference was very good and responsive. My biggest complaint is that I came back to my room one evening to find the door open. I decided to go in when I saw that a light was on but was certainly concerned about the possibility of an intruder. I called the front desk right away and they sent up a security guard. I checked and it did not seem as if anything was taken. The security guard took some data from the door lock and confirmed that the last key used was from housekeeping. I was just fortunate that my room was a bit further down the hall that a passer-by didn't take advantage of the door being left open. This is a huge concern for me and while the conference customer service was good and the room was OK, it is unlikely that I will stay at this property again unless I have to for business reasons.

The hotel is close to the airport, but you won't notice. The hotel was very clean and the staff was super friendly. Breakfast was one of the best we ever had. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to San Diego.

<Content>Thie hotel was very well-equipped with restaurants, spa services, and a great gift store. Beautiful walking areas all around the hotel, in the marina and bay area. My room had a nautical theme that was sweet. Bed was comfortable and cozy. Couldn't get WiFi working, but took it as a sign that work should be done for the day, as I had been up for almost 2 days on this trip! The air conditioning was on full blast and it couldn't be adjusted. When I called to inquire about it, they were quick to handle the situation, and brought me complimentary fruit tray as apology for the half hour intrusion. The service man was wonderful, friendly yet professional and very thoughtful. Great location for airport convenience, bad location for downtown convenience.

<Title>“A lovely hotel but miles from the centre of town”
<Content>We booked here, via a 'travel' website which said that it was 5 minutes from Gaslamp. No such thing!! To get into the centre of San Diego we had to catch the hotel bus to the airport and get public transport into town (and do the reverse to return). The hotel, like any big chain, is comfortable but impersonal and staff weren't very sure about whether the trolley tour stopped at the hotel or when. Given that it's a daily occurence (at 9.50am for the Bay Tower) I thought this was rather strange

<Content>Be carefull which tower they put you in -- they are about 1/2 mile apart -- one has every facility you could want --the one I stayed in the "Marina" was lacking in almost every regard. Good room and good location but that is it. No decent restaurant. No wi-fi in the rooms, no decent place to sit and get a drink. Gift shop is minimal and generally closed. I would not stay here again.

<Content>I had selected this hotel because of the close to airport location and thought we might have a nice view. We were just returning from a cruise and wanted a day to sight see in San Diego. We were on the marina side so the view didn't turn out as well as I had hoped. The room was nice and we spent quite a bit more time in the hotel than anticipated because my husband was not feeling well. We had to walk quite a way to find something to eat and ended up at what was really a coffee shop. Overall, I thought it was a nice hotel.

<Content>We were on the 10th floor - with wonderful views of the marina and the city. other rooms had views of the marina and the ocean. we were very happy with the quality of the room and the service. free internet in the lobby, however $26 parking each day was fairly hefty. only 15 minutes away from san diego zoo and around 15 minutes - the other way to sea world - great location and very easy to get around, especially with a GPS - we drove from san francisco to san simeon to anaheim to san diego - the roads are very well sign posted and the main attractions are easy to find. the prices in the hotel restaurants are very pricey - but nothing is close by - you have to drive to get to a cheaper place to eat. Spend more time in san diego - go and see the city, as well as the zoo, safari park and sea world - san diego is a lovely city and worthy of a day or 2 just getting around in the city.

The arirval at the hotel was perfect. The lobby was beautifully decorated and prepared for our conference. The rooms were nicely appointed: refreshment centre, T.V nautical theme room and very comfortable. Concierge team member very accommodating. The Director of Front Office was very cordial and engaging; thank you Daniel. Though the airportis close to the hotel, you felt as it you were in a resort. The hotel does a great job creating a sense of relaxation and comfort with its surroundings. The guestroom keys are made from cardboard........WOW that is what you call "Taking care of the environment". Thank you everyone for a FANTASTIC experience. I will be back

<Content>One of my favorite San Diego hotels. Friendly staff. Easy to find. Assessable parking. Nice bar and restaurants. Nice Executive Lounge. There are two hotels on the property. About a 5 minute walking distance apart. One tower is the "luxury" tower, has all the amenities and fill up fast. The tower tower is more secluded and has a better view of the San Diego Harbor. Ask which tower you will be put in. Both are a short car drive or bicycle ride to the main Port area.

<Title>“Rooms could use an update”
<Content>Stayed here one night through priceline when the stay for my conference ended elsewhere. The main issue with this place in the rooms. The first room I was given had stained carpet, peeling wallpaper and was just not that clean. They were gracious about moving me and the second room was better but there was still a very large stain on the carpet near the bed. Overall, the rooms are decent but could use an upgrade and good cleaning. The location is OK - especially if you want to stay near the airport. It's on a Marina which is nice and you can walk out into a park that is attached. This is not a place that is convenient to downtown however. Count on cabs (which are not that cheap there) to get anywhere else. I asked about public transportation options but there really isn't too much around. You can walk to downtown if you are a walker and ambitious. There is a pathway.

<Title>“Service and parking sucks”
<Content>They pretty much charge you for everything. You have to go through a gate to park which hardly ever worked and constantly had to get new keys made because of it. The parking is $11 a day which is almost more then any airport you go to just to stay there. Also at 7:15 we wanted to play ping pong and the manager there told us they can't give us any paddles because it's past the time. I clearly told him most of the people staying here don't get back till around this time and he refused to care. This was a great location hotel but not even close to worth it for the price. I rather have stayed at a less nice place for better service.

The staff was friendly and helpful, and I really like the $5 reward per day for participating in the "green" program! If you want a nice view, request a room on an upper floor. Noise from the airport is noticeable regardless of which side you're on, but quiets down by 11:00 or so each night.

<Title>“Nice Location, Bad Customer Service”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel & Marina (Bayside) for three days attending a conference at the hotel. My first night in room 1167 I discovered the thermostat did not work and air conditioner would continue to blow cold air. I made it work by turning the unit on and off several times during the night. The next morning on the way to the conference, I mentioned the problem to the Front Desk and they advised they would send Maintenance to fix the problem. I returned to my room at lunch and found the thermostat was displaying in Celsius and the unit was blowing heated air (as in furnace). I called Guest Services who reported that Maintenance reported the problem as fixed. Guest Services scheduled a second visit from Maintenance and I went back to the conference. I returned to the room at dinner and found no evidence of a visit from Maintenance. I contacted Guest Services who advised they had not heard back from Maintenance and would send someone right away. I advised I would be back in the room around 8 PM and if the problem was not fixed the problem would be escalated to the manager. I returned at 8 PM and the problem was not fixed and the room was super hot. I contacted Guest Services who advised Maintenance was on their way. Fernando from Maintenance quickly arrived and within five minutes determined the unit was broken and would only blow heated air until it was repaired. Fernando contacted the Front Desk and advised them to move us to another room and send a bellhop up to assist in the move. I waited 30 minutes (sitting outside on the balcony to stay cool) and no bellhop. I walked down to the Front Desk and spoke with the manager Dana over the phone. Dana guaranteed the bellhop would be up quickly to assist us and she was researching ways to properly compensate me for my unnecessary troubles. We received a call from Sue at Guest Services asking how our new room was (by calling us in our old room?). We advised we are still waiting on a bellhop and keys to the new room. Sue advised she was working on a compensation package for us to make up for the full day off troubles. Thirty minutes later, I went back down to the front desk and received the keys to room 1172 and I moved myself into the new room. I did meet a maid as I was transferring to the new room that was sent to clean my old room (???). We never saw a bellhop, Sue from Guest Services never called back to offer compensation and Dana the manager never called back to offer compensation. During checkout, I had to argue my point as to why the hotel should remove a charge for a movie rental never finished in the old room. A few days prior to this I stayed at another San Diego hotel during a widespread, 12 hour power outage. I experienced better customer service from that hotel, under the worst of condition compared to the Sheraton Hotel & Marina under the best conditions.

<Title>“Haven't Even Stayed Yet And Already Not Sure I I'll Like It”
<Content>I'm starting this review at 2-stars, which may change depending on how our stay goes. Yes, that's right, we haven't even stayed at this hotel yet, but the experience thus far has not been very good. I called the hotel a week ahead of my scheduled stay (9/21/11) to make a request for a "great room with a great view." Simple enough, right? First, let me tell you why I made this seemingly simple request. I'm planning on proposing to my girlfriend while in San Diego, and, of course, I want everything to go well...everything from the hotel to the restaurants to the proposal itself. I want it to be an experience. So I called up Sheraton reservations and was told that I would need to speak to the front desk reception, as I booked through a third party (Priceline). After being connected to the front desk, I explained that I am proposing to my girlfriend and want to get the best room for this experience. The woman I was speaking with seemed to care less. Don't get me wrong, she did the minimum of what she was asked to do, but she showed no real care. She explained that I was currently booked in the Bay Tower and could only stay on a floor no higher than the 4th. Really? She went on to explain that if I wanted a higher floor I would have to pay $20 extra per night. Ok..if that's what it takes, no problem. I mentioned to her that I had read lots of reviews saying the Bay Tower was not preferable and the main hotel was much better. She admitted that the Bay Tower was kind of far away, but it was quieter and the rooms were bigger. Ok...sounds fine, but I told her that I was concerned because of all of the reviews. So I asked what she would prefer if she were receiving a marriage proposal...which tower/room/view would she prefer. All she said was it is up to me what I want to do and she will make the request. This was less than friendly or personable, and it showed a real lack of caring. At any rate, I agreed to pay the $20 extra per night for a Bay Tower room "above the 4th floor." I made a request for room on the 10th floor with a good view...so let's see if I get it. I hope the concierge is more caring and sincere, as I plan to ask him/her to have champagne waiting for us upon our return to the hotel after I propose. I will stop the review here for now. I really hope I can come back to this review and put 5 stars on this upcoming stay. Wish me luck!!!

<Title>“Great hotel lacking in customer service”
<Content>This is a great property and I'd definitely stay here again. Offers 3 pools and decently sized rooms with balconies. Our view of the marina was beautiful. Some reviewers complained about the location, but it's nice not to be in the downtown area(scuzzy, with lots of homeless!! --- I know they have to live somewhere, but when you're traveling with family you do not want to deal with that element.)  My main complaint with this hotel would be the lack of customer service and their VERY STRONG air freshener. Certain people in my party loved it, but it was definitely not allergy friendly. It had me wheezing before I even completed the checkout process and I had a headache for the rest of our stay. Got up to our room, we decided to order room service and relax before heading down to the pool. I called room service four times and called the front desk, but nobody picked up! I started pushing other buttons in an attempt to ask about room service or other dinning options, but again no answer. The only people that did answer were the valet and they had my car waiting for me proptly every time(good job valet! That was the best service we received while there) I called and asked for two extra blankets, several hours later they never came. After making a follow up call(which AGAIN was not picked up) I went downstairs and requested the two blankets in person. Eventually they sent up ONE blanket.  My room was also charged over $50 in minibar charges for items that were never removed from the fridge. Called to have it corrected, was told someone had to come check the fridge before we checked out, but no one ever came, we waited over an hour for a person to come up!! Finally went down and was told by the desk that they already reversed the charges... So why on earth didn't any staff member bother telling me this??? Because of the wait we ended up being late to our next destination.  Great hotel, bad customer service!!

<Title>“Great Customer Service”
<Content>I recently stayed at this hotel for my cousin's graduation from Marine boot camp. The hotel offered a free shuttle to the Recruit Depot. This weekend had a large power outage, and the hotel staff were extremely friendly and offerred free waters and snacks. The room was newly remodeled and very clean. If you stay here, eat at C Level- it's a great restaurant within walking distance (.3 miles?). Great hotel!

<Title>“A great place to get stranded”
<Content>I was stuck in San Diego during the big power outtage and after rushing over from the airport I was met with a huge line out the door of this hotel and only limited power from a generator. What could have been a long miserable experience was instead a really nice stay at a great hotel! The staff all pitched in and passed out bottled water, kept everyone informed and even made sure there were a few emergency power receptacles for people to charge their phones. It looked like they had practiced for ths type of event because everything went so smoothly. Since the rooms had no power everyone was given a glow stick when the checked in and with an open sliding glass door looking over the bay I got a very plesant night of sleep. The restaurant fed everyone with the limeted cold food they had like salads and sandwiches, but most importantly, the bar was open and they had plenty of cold bottled beer on hand! This would be a great hotel to stay at normally but even being "stuck" there was a pleasure because of the helpful staff.

<Content>First class hotel and great accomodations, the room was very comfortable. The view of the bay and marina was spectacular, very nice pool, nice restaurants if you don't feel like going out. The one down side was the cost of parking at $22 per night but we will definitely stay again because the location is worth it.

<Title>“Money not well spent on multi-million dollar remodel!”
<Content>We won't be back to this hotel. We stayed in the Lanai building in what they call a town house. It has two levels. Upstairs bathroom and main bedroom. Downstairs, bathroom with no bath or shower. Sofabed plus rollaway was for the children. The furniture was insanely heavy to move around which you have to do if you want to pull out the sofa! So once the sofabed is out you have virtually no room to move. The most interesting mistake is the way the balcony is designed. There is a great view of the harbor, BUT if you sit on the chairs on the balcony you see the railing of your balcony instead of the view....How dumb is that? Who got paid to design that? Plus it takes forever to get to the building from the lobby and the final part is really ugly.

<Title>“Handled conference and Black out well”
<Content>Attended a conference of 450 people for FMA. The hotel staff were gracious. On Thursday night when the "big" power outage occurred, they kept one elevator running in each bank of elevators, moved up our social from 6:30 to 4:30, had food and drinks, ice water and ice for over three hours on the lawn for our group. Quickly rechecked in folks who were planning to leave that night but needed to stay an extra night. Provided candles for us to continue to enjoy the evening outside and lit the fire boxes. Overall, the staff handled everything very well including the long lines that formed once everyone at the airport decided they were there for the night and quickly converged on the nearest hotel. They kept the kitchen going, providing what food they could under the circumstances. The true test of a hotel is putting them through a crisis such as the regional black out for almost 12 hours. Good job!

<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton in San Diego in August. The rooms have a natical theme and are very nice. We had a view of the harbor and the city!!! The pool area is great. They had bikes you could use for the paths that were along the waterfront which was alot of fun!! We needed a refigerator in our room and they had one sent up immediately. Would definitely return again.

<Title>“Not bad..”
<Content>We have stayed at the Marina Hilton before but this time we were assigned to the "Tower". This was a former Westin that was added on the Sheraton. They are actually a good 10 minute walk from each other. That really is the only bad thing. The rooms and service was good but there is only one restuarant and the service there was not good. I would reccomend the hotel if you are planning to eat out for everything. Also when you get a room at the Sheraton ask if it is at the main hotel or the tower. Big difference..

<Content>We arrived at the hotel during a mojor power outage and cannot believe how quickly they had everything together that they could do to make it as easy as possible to check in. They did little things such as having bottles water for the guests standing in line to check in and set up a dinner buffet so people could eat during the outage. Staff also handed out glow sticks as the rooms were dark. I would suggest you give them a try as just a wonderful staff and nice hotel.

<Title>“Not of Sheraton Quality, beware there are two towers!”
<Content>The Bay Tower is the pits. First, it suffers from the Holiday Inn look. If you book with your SPG points, you will get placed in the cheaper Bay Tower, unless you complain. Rooms suffer from echos from the parking lot (design flaw - big time!). The Bay Tower also has rooms that overlook the bayside, but the road noise is loud, and every voice or music echos up to the balcony and into your room! Lacks minimal things like toothbrushes, robes, and slippers (not like other Sheratons I stayed at!). No refrig - unless you ask? Coffee maker did not work, minimal tea selection - cheap, cheap. Loud lobby area which looks cheap as well. I don't think they offer any upgrades for Gold/Platinum members since it appears all the rooms are the same. It's not worth the 10 K points, maybe 7k at most. The Marina Tower maybe better - well, at least looks better from the lobby/drive up area! If you are paying "big bucks", I would recommend looking elsewhere, but don't stay in the Bay tower!

<Title>“Unbelievable service during the San Diego blackout”
<Content>I was ASTOUNDED At the service and amenities the Property and the Service staff provided during the recent San Diego blackout. This was not a planned emergency - all of the sudden the power went out. The team at both locations were friendly, hospitable, went above and beyond to ensure the guests were taken care of (water at the front desk, glow sticks to help see, etc). They put out a buffet that was INCREDIBLE given the circumstances. When you have emergencies like this, you really see what the team is made of and the level of service that the hotel provides - and this one is TOP NOTCH!! Thank you all!

<Title>“Awesome Staff!”
<Content>When the power outage hit San Diego I was in the airport and I did not want to sleep on the airport floor. Quite a few other people had the same idea and we all headed for the Sheraton. When we got there they had a generator powered up and the entry way was well lit to welcome us. Someone was handing out water bottles to the long line of people and assuring us they had room for us. Someone else quickly figured out that the Bay Tower had availability and took a bunch of us over there in the shuttle bus. The front desk staff was hand running credit cards and writing down the room numbers on a piece of paper. Every staff person was friendly and calm. Upon checking in we were handed glow sticks so we could find our way around. They told us they had a dinner buffet set up in the main hotel. Ever staff person there was working efficiently and with a smile on their face. The food was very good and the service was excellent. All this without electricity. It was obvious the hotel staff were prepared and trained for this kind of crisis. If they weren't they sure faked it well. I was so impressed with every staff person I encountered and want to thank them for making what could have been truly miserable, something quite nice.

<Title>“Great in all respects”
<Content>Stayed 13 nights whilst visiting San Diego. My wife and I live in England now, but she is born and raised in San Diego. Stayed in the Bay Tower as opposed to the main building, The Marina Tower, it was much quieter & all facilities from the main building are just a short stroll along the marina pathway. All aspects from housekeeping, dining to facilities were excellent. Be prepared to pay for parking $22 per day. This seems to be the norm throughout.

<Content>I was so pleased with my stay at this hotel. I loved our view, our room, the staff, the pool; I can't say enough good things. I got a great rate from priceline.com and it was worth every penny. I got this room for my boyfriend for his birthday and we had such such a memorable time. We sat out on our balcony, drank champagne and enjoyed the stunning view of the marina. The bed was incredibly comfortable and it was difficult to get out of bed in the morning to make it for the breakfast served up on the top floor at the club lounge. The pool next to the marina was very enjoyable and we even mosied over the hammock for a relaxing siesta. I would definately go back and recommend it to people visiting!

<Title>“DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR LUGGAGE”
<Content>Checked in on Sept 1 after waiting about 20 minutes in line. Went up to our room on the 6th floor & put the key in the door, opened right up, walked in & saw a laptop & luggage on the floor. We left the room immediately. We went downstairs & asked for a manager. They told us it'd be about 10 minutes and offered a front desk clerk offered to help. I explained what I concern was. What they did for me was "upgrade" me by giving me a room 1 floor higher & gave me free breakfast. I didnt want/need an upgrade, I wanted this to be noted & addressed by the manager, not to be 1 floor higher & offered the same breakfast 3 days in a row. Had I not already paid for the hotel through Priceline, I would not have stayed there. I made sure we left our valuables in the car. I will not be Priceline'ing a "4 Star" hotel in the SDdowntown area again.

<Title>“Would not recommend this hotel!!”
<Content>Location of hotel is very inconvenient for activities. Sheraton should provide a shuttle to downtown area and other places, not just the airport. Unable to walk to anything and felt like they know that and therefore charge outrageous prices for drinks and foods. Room was just okay. Cleaning Service was extremely slow and hallways were not always clean.

<Content>I stayed at this hotel for the first time with my wife and small children for an intended 5 day stay in San Diego to visit the tourist spots. Unfortunately, my kids became very ill the 2nd day of our stay so we needed to leave and head back to Los Angeles. The hotel was fantastic about our circumstance refunding the remaining days of our reservations with no penalty and allowing for a very late check out. Although I probably would select another hotel next time better suited for families, it was obvious that this is a very good business hotel and I will definately be returning. Also, a big thank you to Julia and Hayley for their great service on that troubling Friday morning.

<Title>“Don't book here. Huge disappointment!!!!”
<Content>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BOOKING...... PROS: Good location if you want to be isolated from just about everything. Few restaurants near by but for most part downtown area I hear is better for lodging. Yes there was only one good thing about this hotel. CONs: Initally everything seem to be quite nice. Shuttle personel was wonderful. Check in was very slow. We walked up with two ppl in line waiting took about 45 mins to get to us. Wanted to get a service performed from spa only to find that they didn't have a full time employee on staff who could complete my request. I was livid... Had to attend the Marine graduation looking not up to par with my norms. The actual room was something you can see at a Motel 6( please no offense meant to that franchise). This goes for the hotel rooms in the Lanina side. The worse looking rooms I ever seen at a Sherton hotel. OMG please dont let me get on the pricing there. It is true they have a price on everything to have a refrigerated in your room of what you think is a 4 star hotel that cost is 15 bucks/ day to have handy. Prepostourus!!! THE HOTEL WILL NICKEL AND DIME YOU AS STATED IN OTHER REVIEWS. THEY PURPOSELY DO NOT HAVE VENDING MACHINES SO YOU ARE SOME WHAT FORCED TO DRINK FROM THE OVERLY OVER PRICED MINI BAR! JUST THINK IN THOSE LATE HOURS WHEN THE THIRST BUG HIT YOU YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE YOU HAVE EITHER A BOAT LOAD OF MONEY STASHED AWAY FOR THE MINI BAR OR STOCK UP ON YOUR FAVORITE NIGHT TIME SNACKS AND DRINKS BEFORE COMING BACK TO HOTEL PREMISES AND REMEMBER THAT FRIGs are 15 bucks/night to have in room!!! CRAZY RIGHT! same thing I said. The front desk associates (one for sure) was totally clueless about shuttle times etc. At this point I am boiling over! The ball was def dropped at this Sheraton! Please do not let the location fool you! At any rate we didnt have to pay for a couple of nights for all the aboved inconveniences!

A fridge in room would be a great addition. Nice pool and hot tub area. Larger bay tower facilities available to use to all guests. Five minute walk away. There is no bar and grill that is open all day in bay tower. Opens periodically in the evening. Bus stop is a ten min walk and its only ten minutes to downtown. 15$in a cab to downtown. The extras in this hotel are very expensive. Parking $20 per night,movies,mini bar etc. Removing points for no wifi in each room and the lack of a always open bar/grill. Wifi only available in lobby.

<Title>“Nice Views, Poor Service - Bay Tower”
<Content>I stayed in the Bay Tower for a friend's wedding from August 25-28. First of all, they messed up the reservation I made through Hotels.com. I specifically requested the Bay Tower, but for some reason gave me the Marina Tower. Luckily, they were able to put me back in the Bay Tower. This also happened to my friend. The rooms themselves were clean & pretty spacious. They had nice views of the water and the marina. The service at this hotel was horrible. The night before I arrived, I called to ask if the workstations had MS Office. They could not provide an affirmative answer. Only after I tweeted SPG did I get a firm answer (which is "yes" by the way). Every time my friends would call the lobby, the phone would ring endlessly -- literally. Sometimes, they wouldn't answer. I also signed up for green service, meaning they don't clean your room unless you specifically ask. Well, on Friday night, after I got through to the lobby after at least 8 rings, they said they'd remove me from green service and get my room cleaned on Saturday. Well -- that certainly didn't happen. That was just me. My friend, who was getting married, had a cocktail hour at BTL, the lounge in the Bay Tower, on Friday night. They tried to close early on her because they were shorthanded and the bartender had to get home to attend to a personal matter. I feel sorry for the bartender, but this is my friend's wedding! They have the reception in this very hotel and have a bunch of family/friends staying here. Provide a little service! The Marina Tower pool area is much larger and nicer than the one at Bay Tower. If you like to run, there is a nice path right outside the Bay Tower right by the water that you can run. Overall, if you don't mind shoddy service, this hotel will do.

<Title>“Nice, conveniently near airport, but hold onto your wallet!”
<Content>The staff was welcoming, and the hotel was nice. The room was a great size with balcony, and overall a decent place to stay (there are 2 hotels and we were at the marina side). During the day it was a little loud, but this is to be expected being near the airport. My biggest gripe about the stay was being nickle & dimed for everything. Make sure to read the fine print! Two things to be aware of: 1) Not only are the items in the stocked fridge overpriced like usual, you will be charged a 20% stocking fee and taxes on top of the listed price. So a can of Coke listed at $4.50 is really $5.50. 2) It's pretty archaic to use anything other than your cell phone these days, but use the phone in your room at your own risk!!! My wife was feeling under the weather so she stayed in the room while I took my daughter to check out a college she is interested in attending this fall. My wife wanted to check on us but couldn't find her cell so she used the room phone instead...her 2 calls that went straight to voicemail cost us $30!!! I can definitely afford to pay the $35.50 here, but it's the way we were charged that doesn't sit well with me. Charging 12 pack prices for a single can of soda and feeling obligated to add a re-stocking fee and tax on top seems ridiculous. And although the card next to the phone says in small print that direct dialed calls will be charged AT&T operator assisted prices, they forgot to mention "bend over and look out!" But if you don't use the room phone and make sure to read all of the fine print, it was a decent place. We didn't get a chance to use the pool, but we looked at the pool area and it looked nice and was clean. Although I wouldn't rule it out entirely, we probably won't be back and will check out another property next time we're in town.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>My friend and I stayed at the Sheraton Harbor Island using a coupon deal for one night. When we arrived at the main hotel, we were told we needed to go to a different tower down the street. I found that odd since the main part of the hotel is where all the restaurants and large pool is located. However; when we arrived at the Bay Tower we were greated by valet and proceeded to check-in. Our room was on the 9th floor close to the elevator overlooking the marina. I like to have a refrigerator I can use when I travel so I was disappointed the room only had a mini-bar. We were hungry but there was no restaurant in the tower so we walked a few yards to a deli down the marina. Our room had two double beds, nothing special and not very comfortable (in my opinion). The bathroom was small but when we requested extra towels they were delivered immediately. We spent the afternoon in our private cabana at the pool which was fantastic. The only issue I have is in talking with some children in the pool, found out they and their family of at least 12 people, were "pool crashers." Apparently that location is a regular spot for them! Later in the evening, we attended the Dive-in Movie at the pool which was fun. I thought the noise from the airplanes (right across the marina is SD airport) was very loud. Nothing special about the room. It was decorated in a nautical theme. I might stay here again but am concerned about the price especially since overnight parking is $30!

<Title>“Great place for the family!”
<Content>We decided to stay here because of the positive comments we read and it did not disappoint! We were impressed with the spaciousness of the room and my daughters (5 and 3 years old) immediately went out on the balcony to check out the view. I recommend requesting the Marina view in the upper floors. The only downside to this stay is the cost of parking which is $22 per day or $30 for valet. Also, we were here during the weekday and found it difficult to find parking so I can't imagine how it would be on a busy weekend. Overall, it was a fun family trip...pool was nice, clean, and warm. They have a fitness room and small gameroom for table tennis and pool. Oh, forgot to mention that they give you an option to be "green" by opting out of getting room serviced in exchange for $5 voucher which we used for Starbucks...totally worth it since you can call housekeeping anytime for more towels or amenities.

<Title>“Wouldn't come back, but not all bad”
<Content>My son and I decided to book a last minute "staycation" in downtown San Diego for a night so we could enjoy some relaxation by the pool. We booked on priceline and got the Sheraton SD Hotel and Marine for $81, plux tax, approximately $95 - NOT BAD! If I had paid the $169 rate plus tax, this would have been 2 stars for my liking. Valet - very nice and quick, but $30. Seriously? Are we in NY or SF? You can self park for $22. Check-inand Room- Again very nice, but slow. Although, the girl was new. Because I am a Starwood preferred guest, we were upgraded to the 10th floor overlooking the Marina and the pool which was excellent. The room was adequate the balcony was wonderful. I loved waking up in the morning, reading the paper and sipping on coffee while the sun broke thru the morning cloud layer, truly a fabulous way to start the day! I will say it was a long walk to the ice machine and there were no robes (which is unusual for preferred rooms in most hotels) neither were a big deal. Pool - It was right on the bay and in my opinion beautiful. Not because the pool is that great, but because how can you not love being on a pool, with great weather and on the water? From a nine year old perspective, "it sucked". Although, he seemed to enjoy it from the first two hours. But, soon became bored because there was no deep water, slide or other attractions to keep him busy. There were mostly younger kids here, but for a one or two night vacation, perfectly adequate for any age. Pool side service - Was sporatic. It took about twenty minutes to get a menu (2pm) and another twenty to come back for our order. But, once we ordered, the food was very quick and the service was friendly and very accomodating. The food is a mixed bag, my sons pizza was $12 (I think) and was a medium cheese pizza which was way above the standard I am use to for hotel pizzas. He ate half for lunch and the other half for dinner. GREAT VALUE!!!! I ordered a a lemon drink which was awful, but I ordered it that way, so my bad. I was hungry and ordered the fish burrito which was terrible, I couldn't eat it. In all fairness, I was raised in SD and we are home of the Fish Taco, so I should have known better. Oh well. Game Room - Game room, hmmmm. Not exactly what we expected, but turned out ok. The "game room" was a room inside the gym that had a wii in it with not really anything games other than the standard package. Also, the parents need to be in the room supervisng the kids at all times (I get that), but wasn't really how I wanted to spend the day, so we moved on to upstairs. This was FABULOUS! My friend joined me at the bar for a glass of vino while my son played the complimentary Xbox with kids that were coming into the lobby (he was 10 feet from me). This entertained him for two hours and he made new friends. Tapatini Tapas & Martini Bar - I have mixed reviews on this. Scott was attentive and was good with all the clients. There seems to be a mix of regulars here which is nice. They come in for dinner and drinks from their boats. My one complaint which is HUGE is the food. Scott recommended the beef skewers, which I was not in the mood for. His second recommendation was the scallops. I should have known better not to order a scallop tapa from a hotel bar - dumb on me. The scallops were good size, 3 on the plate with I believe walnuts and currants on the bottom, a ton of them. It was super sweet, totally gross and the scallops were rubber. I took one bite, disgusting. But, I took a sip of wine and tried another small bite - even more disgusting. The scallops sat in front of me for an hour until I paid the check. Really? I put my napking over them and my fork and knife, isn't this a subtle enough hint to take them from me and maybe ask me if I want something else? Guess not. My son was having such a good time with one of his new friends I asked them if they would like dessert. They both ordered the apple tart and Hagan Daaz icecream. They were like $11 or $12 each. I'm find with that, but neither of them had more than a bite of the tart and said it was too much crust. I tasted it, yep, not awful, but definitely not worth the money. I didn't complain about that either. As long as my son is happy, I am happy! Here is the funny thing though - when I said it was time to go, neither the new friend or the friends dad thanked either Alec or I for the dessert or said goodbye.....really? Here is why I probably wouldn't stay at the hotel again, but only because I am addicted to my computer and the internet. No wi-fi in the rooms and you have to pay $11.95 to be tethered to the desk to get internet there. The positive is it is absolutely free downstairs and it is very good and a wonderful seating area that even provides computers. If you are on vacation here, this should not be a drawback. Overall, service is 4 stars, food is 1 star and location 3. Happy travels!

<Title>“Nice grounds and view, somewhat isolated”
<Content>We were excited to stay at the Sheraton--the clip they had on their website where they were featured on the Today show made the place look fantastic. We were a little disappointed, though. Our first room was so far away from the lobby, and we had a baby and all our gear to haul. The room itself seemed a little shabby. The pool areas, view of the marina, and the grounds were very nice, though. Our second room was easier to get to and had a better view. We had to wait in line for quite awhile to check in/out and it seems they could have used more staff. I did like their on-site laundry facility and computers/printer/internet access. Overall, I thought the place was a bit pricey for the amenities.

<Title>“Nice Hotel, Family Oriented”
<Content>This was your typical Sheraton. Seemed to be more geared towards families. I was upgraded to a nice room but I could hear everything from the hallway and from the room next to me...not just muffled noises but their actual conversations. The bed was comfortable and I had a nice view of the pool. There was a Starbucks on-site, as well as, a free shuttle to the airport. That was a nice touch for my morning trip back to the airport. Overall, I'd say this was a typical Sheraton but due to the issues with noise, I will likely not stay here again. There are some fantastic hotels in the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego.

<Title>“Impressed”
<Content>Stayed for 4ngts as part of a California vacation. Initial thoughts were it was too far out but soon realised that this was very much a positive thing and that the hotel is actually central to all the major tourist attractions as you really need a car to do all. We booked the Club Level which I would highly recommend. You get a beautiful room on the top floor with amazing views which ever side of the hotel you are on. You also get access to the Club Lounge giving complimentary contintental breakfast. Free bottles of water, snacks, free Internet access and printing. Our room was very close to the airport but had excellent soundproofing so we were not disturbed by it. Hotel feels and looks clean and contemporary with a nautical theme present. Pool also nice but no shade so didn't use. Staff were helpful and pleasant. Overall excellent value for money and would definitely stay again

<Content>On family holiday driving through California and passing San Diego for a few nights decided to try Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina as recommended whilst staying at a Westin hotel. Booked through Expedia and just a couple of points as I thought it was one hotel from the photos on the Sheraton and Expedia websites. On arriving at the marina tower 1380 Harbour Island Drive was advised we were booked (and had booked) in the Bay tower passing Carbrillo Isle Marina 1450 H I Drive. On arriving at the bay tower little dissappoined, as I viewed it as a different hotel , about 400 metres plus entrance to entrance bay tower to the marina tower. Booked deluxe room, but I found to be ordinary type room. Bay tower only 12th floor are suites. Buffet breakfast very ordinary in the Bay tower. Also should have checked fees as 22 dollars per day parking, close to airport and informed by reception car park run by different company to Sheraton and fees not negotiable for those staying at hotel (cost me 66 dollars). Good location for old town. I'll give Sheraton a miss on my next visit to San Diego!

<Content>Although we stayed at this hotel for 1 night, it was an amazing experience.The hotel is very close to the airport and the views are awesome. Select a room with a city, marina and a bay view and watch the view from a higher floor. The hotel staff are friendly and this is undoubtedly one of the best hotels we have stayed in recent times.

<Title>“Decent SD Hotel near airport and marina. Beware of extras!”
<Content>Sheraton Marina is a decent property--know that is a large hotel, with two towers and a Lanai building-think lots of guests, weddings, events and two packed pools. Location is great--very close to downtown and the Gaslamp, also very convenient to Point Loma and even Sea World in Mission Beach/Bay. We were upgraded by the friendly SPG front desk to the Lanai property. Our ground room had a nautical motif--room was adequate, seemed clean and we had a small (dirtier) patio. There was no wireless internet in our Lanai room. Beds were comfortable; room was slightly loud--our unrelated connecting room had some loud moments. Room service meal was good, came quickly and overall staff was attentive. One thing to warn potential visitors: we did incur numerous extra charges. Internet was ~$20 per day per device. Thus, with two computers and logging in both days (via hardline ethernet), charges were over $80 incremental to our room rate. Throw in $22/day self-parking fee, a decent but overpriced restaurant, and good, fast room service (and a late-night minibar $16 beer), our extras doubled our room rate. Obviously, not specifically the hotel's fault: they were clear about these fees up-front. But, if price is a factor and you have certain expectations of how you stay at hotels, then consider these extras. Overall, a decent hotel in a great location.

There always seemed to be someone greeting us in the lobby which was a nice touch. Rooms were clean and well kept. I'm hoping that our company books San Diego as a business meeting again so we can stay there soon. Great job all around!

<Title>“Picturesque resort in a convenient location”
<Content>We were in San Diego for the Americas Finest City Half Marathon and 5k Run and had a room on the ninth floor of the Marina Tower. The room was clean, nice and decorated in a nautical theme. Harbor Island, Point Loma, the marina and the airport could be seen from the balcony. The hotel is very convenient, located adjacent to downtown and the airport. The hotel staff is friendly and courteous. The hotel grounds are nicely maintained and landscaped and the pool areas are very inviting. The only thing I did not like was the $20 charge for parking. The hotel has facilities for conventions. It was the host hotel for the marathon expo and also had other events at the time so it was very busy. After paying the $20 parking fee, were had much difficulty finding a parking spot, day and night. Other than the parking hassles, this is definitely a recommended hotel.

<Title>“Beautiful location...”
<Content>I was initially surprised that we were so far away from the heart of San Diego. Turns out our location was great. Everything we needed was on the property, and just a mile away was an entire shopping center with Trader Joe's and plenty of little restaurants. The kids loved their choices of pools too. The hotel restaurant was outrageously delicious. My complaint would be that the rooms did not feel so clean. I noticed there were dogs in other rooms and our carpet felt a bit dirty. I did not allow my kids to sit on the floor. Also the restroom had some issues, which the hotel plumber was fixing for quite some time. The hotel was nice enough to compensate us slightly, but it was still a little gross and inconvenient. Overall, I think it's at a wonderful location and I would go back in a heartbeat. The views were spectacular.

<Content>What can I say of a place where, from the very beginning to the end, everything was absolutely perfect? We stayed for 5 nights after a wonderful bargain booking made last april with Expedia. We were in the club lounge at the 12 floor with the possibility to have a great buffet breakfast and an every afternoon Hors d'oeuvre. The room (double queen) was clean and comfortable for a party of four like us (with two young kids) and the view from it gorgeous over the Bay and the pool. The pool is also a plus and really relaxing with its spa. We really enjoyed our stay and we'd like to be there again sooner or later. The only thing I can say could have been better.....is that maybe 20 dollars a day for the parking it's a bit expensive......

Other issues: - On several occasions, I was unable to reach anyone at the front desk. - For early risers, you should know that the restaurant only opens at 6:30. - The morning staff at the restaurant weren't very friendly. And they didn't appear to be too happy to be there.

<Title>“not for the price”
<Content>My girlfriend and I spent 4 days here and were underwhelmed.No perks to speak of.A very basic room with minimal towels,soaps,shampoos,etc. If you left a half used bottle of shampoo or soap they would not replace it until it was gone.We actually hide the toiletries in our suitcases so they would replace them for the next day. Everything was extra.The newspaper was added to the bill even if you didn't want it.There was only 1 free hour of internet use and then internet use was charged to your bill.But the biggest ripoff was the parking.they charged 30 dollars a day for parking.and there was nowhere else to park(no on street parking available) . The bathroom fixtures were all rusted at the connections and half the rooms light fixtures were not working.All in all,not worth the price.

<Title>“A large hotel with good customer service!”
<Content>Generally we stay away from larger hotels as often they lack the personal touch, but that was not the case with The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. Friendly front desk reception, reservation, good maid service & attentive restaurant wait staff. Rooms are nicely decorated and were clean. We did have an issue with a sheet, but called room service and they responded immediately. Common areas of the hotel are well kept, the grounds were beautifully landscaped, nice view of the harbor and yachts, clean and inviting pools. Hotel location is good, near airport, car rentals and near to downtown. Close to harbor areas, beaches, Old Town, Gaslamp District, I-5. If you have a car you will need to use hotel parking, either self parking or valet, from $22-$28 daily rates. Otherwise you will need to rent a car or take taxi. Public transporation is not close. No stores, shops and restaurants within walking distance but hotel does have several good restaurants including a Starbucks. Hotel is quiet and relaxing and we enjoyed our stay and were not disappointed in our choice. We would recommend this hotel and would stay again in the future.

<Title>“Almost a "5", and Dog Friendly, too!”
<Content>We drove to San Diego for a few days, and we brought our well behaved spaniel. Simply a perfect place for a getaway. We had a wonderful view of the harbor, and an extremely comfortable room with a king-sized bed. We paid the extra $40/day Club Fee; well worth it for the view from the 12th floor, the quiet, and especially the club access--free breakfast buffet (not cooked), free hors d'oeuvres in the evenings, free water bottles and free internet access. The area is right across from the airport but surprisingly quiet, and there are beautiful walking paths all around the harbor for a happy dog to enjoy with her family. Our only negatives are the $22.00/day parking fee (apparently average for the area) and the fact that they Locked Up the Walkways in the evening, (a security issue?) so after the pleasant evening walk, you have to walk twice as far just to get back in. All-in-all, a really nice place.

<Title>“Not terrible, but wouldn't go back.”
<Content>Sheraton wasn't terrible, and probably a great deal if you have kids, but we won't be back. Housekeeping service was uneven-one night we returned to find no soap refills. Another night we returned to find no coffee refills. These were too minor to complain about, but definitely a deterrent to returning. Room was in the bay tower, with a view of the hotel lobby. We would have complained if we weren't out sight-seeing most of the day. Front light in the room's foyer didn't ever work. The bed was incredibly uncomfortable (even for two people with different body types and bed preferences), and the room's AC never operated correctly. We woke up every night to turn it down further, after kicking off the blankets, but it never cooled down enough. Shower was incredibly small, even for a tub/shower combo. We have a standard size at our apartment, and this was perceptibly smaller. Housekeeping apparently washed around our items on the sink, rather than removing from the sink area, washing, then replacing. Front desk didn't pick up for several minutes when we called at 10 pm for a wake up call. One of us is a Hilton Diamond member and was unpleasantly surprised by the front desk never asking how the stay was going or how the room was at checkout--which is standard for Hiltons.

<Title>“Isolated and Overpriced”
<Content>We just stayed 5 nights at the Sheraton San Diego on the Harbor and it was not worth it. Everything was overpriced (bottle of water in the gift shop was $4, omlet at their restaurant was $17, parking was $30/night). Since we didn't have a rental car, we felt isolated. There is nothing around there but the harbor. The only decent restaurant on the island itself is Island Prime / C Level (which is about a mile walk from the hotel). We were unable to take a taxi since we had a 6 month old. I rented a car for each day that we wanted to travel somewhere, then returned it the same night to avoid paying the $30 parking fee (zoo and sea world). The room was decent, but the goose down in the pillows and bedspread were shedding everywhere, creating dust in the room. We had a nice view from our balcony of the harbor. If you don't have a car, I suggest the gaslamp district. If you're more into Sea World, then stay around mission bay.

<Title>“Kids LOVED this hotel !”
<Content>We stayed in the 3-story non-tower rooms and was pleasantly surprised. I guess if I didn't have a beautiful view of the Marina it would not have been so nice. Mind you, our last stay in San Diego was at the Hyatt Mission Bay. The rooms were clean however wish the beds were queens vs. full size. My 8 and 6 year olds LOVED the pool and nightly movie. They also loved the WII room in the fitness room which was a nice touch because it allows parents to workout while the kids are safely playing in the WII room. Kids also played ping pong and pool. There is also a nice walking trail along the Marina. Although we didn't do any water activities, it was all there conveniently located on the Marina. We did do the Pirate Adventure Tour and would recommend it to families with young children. Cost was $30/adult and $26/kids. We are Starbucks addicts so we loved the on-site location. We ate at the breakfast buffet and it was actually pretty good except NO pancakes or waffles, which my kids were disappointed with. Otherwise, a nice selection. The free internet access area was great providing guests free use of about 10 computers with big computer screens. Overall, my family really enjoyed our stay here and would definately choose to stay here again.

The rooms were clean and well equiped and the view across the Marina was fantastic. We ate breakfast at a small cafe on the water front just under the hotel which was very good value. The hotel is VERY close to the airport but we did not hear any noise from there at all.

Our room was beautiful, clean, large and over looked the San Diego Bay. Our room had two comfortable queen beds,4 feather pillows, large flat screen TV, desk, extra comfy side chair,and coffer maker with Starbucks coffee. We had a patio with table and chairs. We checked out the pool, small but clean and lots of lounge chairs. Across the street nice sidewalk beside the bay for a long walk was great. This hotel is close to downtown for great shopping and restaurants but not to close for to much traffic. I will recommend this hotel to our friends and stay here again.

<Title>“A mixed bag”
<Content>Booked here for two nights. Arranged a club room but wasnt entirely sure we got one as it wasnt on the club floor and we had to ask twice for confirmation of the club lounge detail/arrangements. Big luxurious and very busy with holiday makers and conference guests in full turnout. Although hard to find real fault, we didnt really enjoy this hotel. Found the restuarants and bars very expensive and the staff not particularly helpful. Location mixed. You cant walk into town from here and next time we'd pick a hotel which is closer. That said, we did go sailing on a yacht in the harbour and the Sheraton was ideal for that. VERY close to the airport but to be fair we didnt hear noise. Very plush but lacks the personal touch

<Title>“Great hotel”
<Content>We stayed with our three year old for three nights. We ended up originally in the marina tower and decided to switch to the lanai section. I know some reviewers didn't lime this section but we loved it. We had a wonderful view of the water and were right next to the Pools but the best part was no elevators to deal with which was a treat with a three year old. Room was super comy and nicely decorated. Starbucks was right there which I liked. The only thing I didn't live was the cost of parking but the service and everything else was great.

<Title>“Overall good, would stay again”
<Content>Just returned August 16th, all in all this hotel is good not quite up to the Sheraton standard though, the rooms are clean the bathroom could use a fan, and it would have been nice to have a fridge in the room, the beds were comfortable . We had a room in the Marina tower which is the bigger of the two towers we had a room facing the city/Airport which at first I thought might be an issue (noise from Airport) but actually it was not an issue you do hear airport noise whilst sitting on the balcony but when you close the door you don’t hear anything, the walls had good sound insulation which is good because I’m a light sleeper and I did not experience any problems. Food is fairly expensive here we booked a package through Allegiant Air and received breakfast free everyday which was great you had the choose of buffet or menu breakfast it was good, we ate in the bar once food was ok! There are no restaurants close to the hotel so if you don’t eat at the hotel you would have to go downtown which is a 10 minute drive away, if you don’t have a car like us you can take the hotel shuttle to the airport then take the bus to downtown a little inconvenient but it worked. The pool is very nice lots of chairs to lounge around on they do have a pool bar which is convenient the staff do walk around to take orders, I found the food here a little greasy for my liking. The hotel does have lots of conferences here but it did not affect us to much they have a big conference centre so they are really well take care of over their own side of the hotel. The hotel front desk staff we found to be very unfriendly it seemed like they were going out of their way to help us, on the over hand housekeeping went out of their way to help you and were very friendly even though English was clearly their second language. Parking your car here is expensive $25 a night and more for valet parking however most hotels charge the same rates. It would have been nice if they had a shuttle that took you to the downtown area where you can pick up a bus or the trolley system which is very easy to get around on.

<Title>“Beautiful rooms - BUT -”
<Content>Check-in was 3 pm, BUT - we could not get into our rooms until after 5. They said it was not yet cleaned. Door to mini-bar was ajar and nothing was cold. I reported this right away, but nothing was done about it and they still tried to charge us on our final bill. Appears this hotel is understaffed although rooms are beautifully appointed. Very near the airport and if plane noise bothers you, I would stay at another Sheraton as there are several in San Diego.

<Title>“Some pros and some cons”
<Content>I stayed here for a conference. The hotel seems to be able to handle a large number of guests; there were 1,000 present at the conference and also some little league baseball teams. The lobby, business center, and fitness center never seemed crowded, but the Starbucks had long lines and the pub restaurant was busy, understaffed, and hot. I stayed in the Marina Tower. Check-in service was prompt, courteous, and friendly. I can say the same for the parking valet and concierage. My room was very clean and comfortable.The bed was great, and room service was reliable. Unfortunately I was unable to get a room with much of a view, but the 5th floor was quiet and I was never bothered by noise from the airport or other quests. Also, the conference facilities were great with prompt attention from the tech team. So on the plus side--very nice room, clean and quiet, and overall wonderful service. Now, the cons--as noted by other reviewers--the hotel is isolated. If you want to see San Diego, you will need to rent a car, and if you rent a car, you will have to pay the outrageous (in my view) parking fees--$22 per day for self park, $28 for valet. I would prefer to stay some place where I could walk to restaurants and shopping. Secondly, in-room internet is costly, although wi-fi is free in the lobby. Finally, the food and drinks in the on site restaurants were mediocre and way over priced, and the restaurants and bar always seemed to be understaffed. I spent two nights checking out restaurants in the Gaslight District. I would recommend taking a cab rather than driving, as parking was scarce and very $$$. Also, the evening scene there is not very family friendly. Try Fred's for Mexican or one of the reasonably priced Italian restaurants.

<Title>“An Average Three Star”
<Content>This is an old tired property that tries to pass as a 4 star hotel. The Lanai Building portion of this property offers a two star experience. Seriously, the folks at Starwood need to downgrade to a lesser brand and lower the rates. On the positive side, the staff was friendly and helpful and the lobby was well appointed. The problem is the room, hall ways, elevators look and feel like a Motel 6. If you are paying less than $100, then you are getting value for your money. There are much better options closer to downtown.

<Title>“Don't Bother”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton because an annual conference I attend had booked this place. It was not out of choice. The rooms did NOT have wifi. I verified this w people in both towers there for my conference. The hotel is also out of the way unless you have a car and then the parking card readers are shotty. When you call the valet for help you get an attitude as if the issue is your fault. Icing on the cake for me was finding my room door left open by housekeeping the final day there. When I spoke to the GM about that and my broken faucet he told me my bill would be adjusted. Not so much. Love San Diego but next time I will be at the Hyatt or Marriott.

<Title>“No Redeeming Qualities”
<Content>Check-in took 45 mins., then my room wasn't ready at check-in time, was offered a room in another bldg. "right next door" or a two-hr. wait for my room. The bldg. "next door" is actually about 1/2 mile away and has very limited services, internet service is really poor and only available in certain parts of the hotel, no pool, no coffee shop (when I asked about a Starbucks in the bldg. they referred me to the in-room coffee). There is a shuttle between the main hotel and the satellite hotel......but it takes you to the main hotel via the airport!! Very poor service all-round and obvious it starts with the management. By the way, this hotel is right next to the airport so you will need earplugs if you still decide to give it a try.

<Title>“Our anniversary get away.”
<Content>This trip was a gift from our children and spouses for our 40th Wedding Anniversary. Don't let our age bracket influence you in a negative way. We saw all different ages that stayed here and everyone seemed to be smiling. The room was large and very clean. No complaints at all. The Sheraton is about one mile from the airport and consists of two separate buildings, a five minute walk between them. We were told upon arrival by a cab driver that the Marina building was for the younger crowd and the Bay Tower building was a little more relaxed. The only complaint we had was the Starbucks was in the "other" building. We didn't rent a car the first two days. By the third day, we rented a car as the cab rides were getting expensive. There's a lot to keep you occupied: Old Town, Balboa Park, Coronado Island, USS Midway, San Diego Zoo, Littly Italy for dinner, Boat rides, Seaport Village to people watch and coastal drives. Oh, and Tijuana. Keep an open mind and enjoy the vitality there.

The gym is SMALL compared to the size of the hotel so very crowded. The bar/restaurant is average. Service is decent but food was average. Internet is $18 and self prking is $22.

<Title>“You've got to be kidding”
<Content>We booked this hotel via Priceline.com for $85.00 per night. When we arrived, the parking attendent checked his list and we were told to go down the street to the Sheraton "Bay View" to check in. Right away, I was dissappointed as I wanted to stay at the Sheraton "Resort" with nice pools and a marina to walk around. Since I belonged to their points club, the desk agent gave us an upgrade to a higher story room where the views (which were absolutely beautiful) would be better. It's a good thing that the patio had chairs as the room itself was a dive. Barely a 2 star place. Upholstered sofa and two chair/hassocks were stained and filthy, the aircondition duct was hanging down from the ceiling, walls so thin I could hear the people in the room above us going to the bathroom. Self-Parking was $28.00 per day; Valet was $32.00 WiFi was $17.00 per day. THe next day when checking out, I wanted to speak to the Manager - unfortunately, another desk agent told me that all the management people were housed at the "Resort" The best thing was Deana at the front desk - a real people person with excellent skills.

<Title>“Nice property, service needs refinements”
<Content>Okay, so we got to the hotel early and we didn't really expect our room to be ready yet. They offered to call us when it was ready but we waited to 3PM, check-in time, and there was no call. Back to the long line at the desk. Long since there was only one person waiting on guests checking in. In fact, we rarely saw more than one or two people at the reception desk, therefore there was always a long line of tired travelers. Our room was still not ready so we were given a room with the city view, which is very nice but faces the airport and freeway so is substantially noisier. Back to the line for another 10-15 minute wait. Can we wait for our original room, we ask? There was no record of our original request. Okay, so we head out for dinner, the parking gate was not working properly. Back to the line. They explained there's something wrong with the computers and to just use the assistance button at the gate. Later after dinner, can't get into our room. Back to the line. My husband gets two new cards and we are assured they work. Breakfast in the club room the next day. Can't get up with our cards. Back to the line. Computers still malfunctioning and we still can't get out of the parking lot, the lot for which we paid $22/day. My recommendation, Mr. Manager, hire an IT person and some more desk assistance. The bar in the hotel had some very good drinks, food and service. Although when people were 3 deep at the bar, the bartender had to leave the bar and find someone to help him. You guys could use an extra hand at the bar, too.

<Title>“Nice property-just be prepared for terrible customer service”
<Content>Overall large rooms in the Bay tower where we stayed-( called in advanced and requested this tower as per other reviews here) Got a great deal through price line, HOWEVER- they treat you like you shouldnt even be there. Treated the " Gold" customers as such, but the " price line" was not only brought up to me, but the front staff were quite snobbish. While the restaurant and cleaning staff were fantastic, the desk staff should be run through a course again...it was quite brutal. Sure glad i dont ask alot of front desk staff....will never stay at Sheraton property again. The location, while it may seem far away for visiting, was actually very easy to get to local attractions-Zoo/Seaworld, etc....expensive parking but it is becoming normal at higher end hotels. Overall I'd recommend if you get a name your own price...but I wouldnt pay full price for this hotel. I got it for $100/night BTW

<Content>Got this room expecting greatness, unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. Elevator had rotting wood in it, paint falling off. Bathroom light wouldn't turn off, didn't have a fan, and had mold growing on the ceiling! Room was nice, but didn't have a fridge, had unreasonably priced items in a stocked fridge. Room service was unreasonably priced! Had to pay for parking @ the hotel - 22$ a day-to-day no validation. Bed was uncomfortable! Bed had plastic or something on the mattress that made us sweat! Only thing that was nice was location and view, otherwise poor place to choose!

<Title>“Hotel and location more oriented to business clients but clean with large rooms”
<Content>This hotel is more oriented towards the business traveller, evident obviously by the location by the airport, but also the excessive internet and parking charges. The parking charge is $22.00, per night! How ridiculous!! The internet was about $11.99 per 24 hours, but you could get two free hours if you were near the lobby, or in the foyer of the marina tower there were PCs and I think you could get on them for free. Excessive extras I believe. Despite this, the hotel has very big, nice rooms. We were in the Bay Tower, with a view on the bay side which was really nice. The balcony gets some sun around the middle of the day. It is too far to walk into the city, so a taxi or drive yourself. We drove, and got free parking in the gaslamp district, but it was on a Tuesday night and I believe free parking hard to come by at the weekends. Gym free to use. Really nice hotel, nice pool, but just a bit far out and with the extra costs on an already expensive hotel.

The only negatives were (1) location: the marina is very isolated and you need a car or you need to take taxis (2) the dining options were not very good. Overall, however, an excellent property.

<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton for the 4th of July weekend and found it to be the perfect location. The hotel is very large and has 2 large buildings that surround the marina. We had a bay front balcony that provided us a beautiful view of the San Diego Bay and an unbelievable view of the holiday fireworks. 4 simultaneous displays from one side of the bay to the other. It was amazing! The staff, the room and the amenities were very nice and accommodating.

<Title>“A nice way to be introduced to San Diego”
<Content>I liked that this wasnt right in the city, we had a rental car so that was okay for us, as I couldnt do alot of walking anyways. Be mindful its right near the airport, though it didnt bother us. We got a concierge room it had a balcony and beautiful view of the San Diego skyline. Behind the hotel is a nice marina view. Outdoor pool looked nice but we didnt get a chance to use it. Stay in the Marina tower, its definitely better situated. The concierge lounge had a complimentary continental breakfast which was perfect, included hardboiled eggs and oatmeal with usual continental fare. Appetizers from 5-8 were just so so - asst of nice cheeses, nice croissant sandwiches, but only two hot items, one was cheesesticks that were not very appetizing, I liked the mini egg rolls. The attendant there was very slow, I had to find her to give my drink order. We also bought a AAA package which included the self parking fee and gave us $50 food and beverage credit which made this a great value overall. You cannot walk easily to downtown from here, but their restaurants appeared to be quite nice onsite. I was a bit perturbed at checkout, she wasnt very nice, there was an error on my bill, she did end up taking care of it, when I thanked her she didnt even respond, I was about to complain to her manager but I had one foot out the door so I chalked it up to her having a bad morning and let it go. I found it very clean and comfortable, but would probably stay closer to the city on my next visit.

<Title>“Great View”
<Content>We spent just one night in the Bay Tower, 7th floor overlooking the marina and it was perfect. My 15 month old son loved looking at all of the boats, airplanes, and sea gulls. We were pleasantly surprised around 9:45p.m. to hear fireworks (I'm assuming from Sea World?) and so we rushed to the balcony and had a great view of that. Parking ($22 self-park) in the Bay Tower lot was easy and convenient.

<Content>Stayed for a week with my 20 year old daughter. We stayed on the club floor which was nice especially for breakfast daily, and ability to get bottled water anytime we wanted. Although we didn't spend a lot of time at hotel, when we did we enjoyed it! Favorite staff member....Scott, the bartender at Tapatinis for sure! He was entertaining and pleasant. We took advantage of the "green room" choice and instead of housekeeping we received $5.00 every day under our door to be used anywhere in the hotel. We still asked for extras of anything we ran low on, and always received what we needed. Only complaint is that parking is a little high.....$22.00/night is exhorbitant! and $28/night for valet was out of the question for us.

<Title>“A Tale of Two Towers”
<Content>Stayed 4 nights here the last week of July. This is a very nice hotel with two towers that are very different from each other. Depending on your tastes and needs it is important you are given a room in the appropriate tower. The main tower is called the Marina Tower. This is where you will find the main lobby, bars and restaurants. This is also where you will find Starbucks (open 5:30 for us early risers). The main pool is here as well. This is also where you will find the majority of the noise and commotion associated with a large resort like hotel. The smaller Bay tower is located a 5 minute walk away. It too has a bar and restaurant and pool, but everything in the Bay Tower is on a smaller scale. I found it to be perfect for my needs. The rooms are large and well appointed. I found my room to be clean. I asked for a higher floor and was placed on 11. My room looked down on the Marina (lots of sail boats) and also had a view of the adjacent airport. I spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the marina and airport activity. The opposite side faces the bay and some might prefer that view. If you are worried about sleeping noise the airport is quiet at night and I slept very well. I made the walk between the two towers several times a day and found that I enjoyed it very much. Had the weather been bad I might not have felt that way. I did rent a car while here and found the hotel close enough to all the attractions. You can self park your car if you want to. The Bay tower is much closer to the car park. There are 2 restaurants off the hotel property which are walkable. The first is The Lighthouse and it is very good (I highly recommend it and you will need a reservation). The second, The Boat House, is closer but I found the food and service to be terrible. This is a very nice hotel which can offer two different experiences at the same time. Just choose the tower which fits your needs and you will be happy.

<Title>“Well appointed, well out of the way”
<Content>This hotel is great for a one night stop over to or from the airport. The rooms are well appointed and to the usual Sheraton standard. Internet access is extra but there is free wifi within the confines of the business centre (next to the bar). The hotel is a long way from San Diego centre though (over 2 miles and a $10 taxi ride to anywhere of signficance - although if you're on a budget you can take the free 15min frequency shuttle to the airport and then the Holiday Inn shuttle to the Holiday Inn which is at least walkable to the USS Midway and beyond that Seaport Village and downtown). The main disadvantage I found was that I was located in the annex which is a LONG way from reception (especially if you have bags etc). Obviously, as the hotel is near the airport there is some plane noise though I slept soundly.

<Title>“Very nice hotel”
<Content>We just stayed at this hotel this past weekend it was 3 adults and 4 kids (ages 4, 10 & 13) and we got an amazing rate by calling the hotel directly, and using our AAA discount. We got a rate of $119/night per room, non-refundable. They had a huge lagoon-pool overlooking the beautiful Marina. Both sides of the hotel overlooked the Marina so all rooms probably have a nice view, and the hotel and rooms were all newly renovated/updated in a nautical theme. The lunch in the sports bar off the lobby was good and the staff was helpful and friendly. Although you do have to basically drive through the airport to get to the hotel as its right in the airport area and seemed to be mainly a hotel fcatering to business travelers. If you want to go anywhere you do need to drive, but its very close to evreything - about 10 min to the Gaslamp Quarter, Old Town, etc.

<Title>“No service”
<Content>This is my second stay here and love the location. First time I was here our family loved everything about the hotel. Room was clean and well maintained, view was exceptional, and staff very pleasant. This time, the complete opposite. Room is dusty and dirty. Air conditioning unit sounds horrible with water sloshing around inside of it. Called front desk twice and was assured they would send a technician. Departed room in morning for day out in SD sunshine. Returned to room to find the a/c unit had not been touched. Received no indication, note, message, or anything that would indicate the issue was even being addresed. Poor service and unacceptable for a room they charged $250 a night for. Will avoid Sheraton from now on. Too bad because this can be a great hotel, given the right circumstance.

<Title>“Great access to airport - but feel like you are far away”
<Content>Given its proximity to the airport - you can call it an airport hotel - but it is nothing like an airport hotel. On the marina - spread out - large pool, etc. I found it very convenient for a conference I was in San Diego to attend (ADA). Loved the proximity to the marina for my morning run. It is not near the Gas Lamp/Downtown area - so you will need to cab or shuttle to get to other places. I was in the tower closer to the lobby - which I would reccommend as it looke like the other section of the hotel was a hike.

<Title>“We found our annual vacation spot!”
<Content>We have been going to San Diego every year for 18 years. We never had a place to go that we could look forward to the next time we go, until this year. We stayed on the 11th fllor of the Bay tower. My family had the marina side. We absolutely loved both views, but I am partial to the big ships so we were on the bay side. The view was spectacular from both sides. The employees from management on down to the bus drivers that drove you from one hotel to the other (free) were all so friendly! The restaurants in the hotel were very good. Wonderful breakfast buffets as well! The rooms were decorated as such that we had never seen. Fresh and lively, but relaxing and comfortable. We loved the red, white and blue! Poolside movies for the kids on weekend nights are fun! I don't usually add so many exclamation points, but they deserve them! I do suggest you bring over the door hooks for the bathroom, as there are not enough to hang towels. You can get those at the dollar store. We will be back next year with our grandkids to join our family for another week of fun and relaxation. Maybe we will see you there! I give this hotel 4 and 3/4 stars. They lost 1/4 points for lack of bathroom hooks. If you don't go there because of that, then nothing will make you happy! Try it and I know you will enjoy your stay as much as we did!

<Title>“Nice hotel”
<Content>This is a very nice and clean hotel. It is right on the Marina literally accross from the street from airport, yet we didn't hear any noise. One of the quiter hotels even when busy. Water views on both sides, so no matter where your room is the view is nice. Near downtown and the Zoo. However it is pretty far south of the nicer areas like La Jolla and Del Mar.

<Title>“Awesome Hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the San Diego Marina Hotel for two nights while visiting our daughter. The Sheraton’s location is just beautiful. The hotel and the rooms were outstandingly clean. The staff was very welcoming especially to our granddaughter with us. Their hospitality and genuine customer care was so refreshing. We got in very late, because of airplane problems, so it was so nice to have the staff so accommodating and pleasant. The pool area was wonderful, we used the larger pool all the time but there even was another pool at the hotel. Great pool games for children. The food was excellent, breakfast and eating lunches at the pool (they even had steel drums playing one day, which was great). While all the staff was friendly, Ronnie, the food manager, was awesome! He is probably one of the nicest and friendliest people there. Thanks Ronnie for making our stay at the Sheraton so memorable. We highly recommend this hotel and we will be back again to stay.

<Title>“Beautiful location”
<Content>Stayed here for a conference so this review won't speak much in terms of value since the company paid and I'm not sure how much the room was. But in terms of location, it was great! Great jogging/biking paths from the hotel to Seaport Village (3 miles) and downtown (worth the walk if you don't mind walking). I rented a bike from the hotel (great deal!) and biked all around Sunset Cliffs and Pt. Loma (~5 miles to the Pacific coastline for amazing views!). My room itself wasn't the best. It was ground level and hence, had to have my curtains drawn all day, leading to a dark and dreary room. The pool was nice, with hammocks, and a recreation center. Not many breakfast/snack options though. Starbucks had the monopoly there, but there's also a sandwich/cafe shop midway between the Bay and Marina towers. Excellent location for taking in the beautiful coastline, both night and day! Convenient location for me due to the conference, but also convenient for exploring all my favorite spots downtown, all managed w/o a car!

<Title>“I stayed here for Comic Con 2011, I won't be coming back to it.”
<Content>I booked this hotel for 2011 Comic Con for $200 a night. If I had to give it a review it would be more like 2.5 instead of 3. It wasn't the best I've stayed but at the same time it wasn't the worst. A few of my thoughts: 1) The major perk of staying there is that it is close to the San Diego International Airport. The hotel does offer a free shuttle from the airport however when I called the customer service representative stated that it runs every 20 minutes. It took them longer than that. The hotel that I stayed while in San Diego previously they told me that their shuttle would be there in 10 minutes and that they were leaving so I didn't have to wait that long. 2) When I arrived at 3pm there was a line of 4 people. There was two people assisting other people and about 20 minutes later somebody came to assist. Thankfully, I am a patient person. I was told from a phone call from me that I could add $20 a night for breakfast, internet access and hor d'oeuvres so I paid additional money to get that. 3) I really loved my room. The bathroom was perfect for 1 to 2 people but it would be crowded for 3 or more people. The bed was comfortable. The view of the marina was nice and I did get an upgrade with a balcony. The big screen was nice and there was a lot of room for my clothes (a closet and drawer set). There was a desk and chair. The coffee pot for two cups is a nice touch. I wished there was a refrigerator and microwave. 4) The thing that irritated me is the fact that the hotel DOES NOT have wifi. I was told at checking out that it is something they are working on getting but it's something that they have been working on for 2 years. There is a dial up connection. On Thursday night when I tried to get the dial up set up the cord was frayed so I requested to get a new one. It took three phone calls to get them to bring me up a new one. That is unacceptable customer service. I also called because the hair dryer wasn't working. That also took three phone calls. I didn't get any of this fixed until Friday Night. 5) The breakfast they serve was very basic. Everyday I was there they offered: A) Turkey, Ham, Swiss & Cheddar Cheese. B) Hard boiled eggs C) Muffins, Croissants, White & Whole Wheat Bread, Bagels (There is a toaster) D) Decaf & Regular coffee, Tea, Orange Juice, Grapefruit juice and two others that look suspicious to me. There is sugar and artificial sweeteners. E) The waiters were very personable & helpful. F) The $20 extra I paid for included breakfast and hor d'oeuvres. The snacks was only for between 5 - 8pm. The snacks was basically the same as breakfast except they had small size burritos and cheese quiche. I only went there twice and it was good but it would of been nice to see them spice things up a bit. 6) It was convenient to have the shuttle to get to leave for the airport on Sunday. However, to take a cab to downtown San Diego will cost you about $30 round trip. For Comic Con there was a shuttle to get to the convention center which was free but to get back to the hotel you really need take a cab especially if you are staying out late. It was very easy to catch a cab at the hotel because there is a stand for them and the valet escorts was very quick to get me a cab. 7) The heated pool and hot tub is clean and very comfortable to go swimming in. Overall, it was good but not excellent. I am planning on going to Comic Con next year but next time I will stay in a hotel that is closer to the convention center which means I will have to pay more money but it would be worth it due to the near $200 I spent on getting a cab back to the hotel.

<Title>“You Kidding? Not worth the value AT ALL!!!”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel for one night, and we definitely will not come back again if we are paying for the hotel. My first impression of the hotel was poor service combined with inefficient hotel staff. The receptionist Juan was checking us into the hotel, and he told us our room was "not ready" and all the other "ready" rooms were full. This is totally unacceptable, given the fact that we were checking in 12 midnight, which gives them 12 hours of room cleaning time and the hotel is only 12 floors tall. Afterwards Juan's manager gave us this room on the first floor, which was really the basement because the lobby is on the second floor. Our room had traces of insects, because the first thing i found was a dead bug on my pillow. Although the room looked clean, you never know what is on the carpet. On the next day we took a walk around the marina, and the only good thing about this hotel is the view (which we didn't get, thanks to Juan and his manager) and the presence of a Starbucks next to the lobby. We are truly disappointed with Sheraton with this stay. I thought an elite international hotel chain like Sheraton could have done better with their customers. We paid over $200 for our room and we didn't expect poor service and a basement room with dead insects. I have stayed in other Sheraton hotels and the rooms and service are on a higher level. Stay away from this Sheraton.

<Title>“Amazing Resort hotel, great for business too”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here 7/17/11 for 4 nights. The location is perfect, across the street from airport, but on Harbor Island. It is a beautiful location and great walking along the bay path in front of the hotel. The hotel has a free shuttle to the airport. This is a 4 star very upscale resort on the bay. The lobby is very nice and great for people watching. We are Starwood Gold members and there is a separate check in for SPG members. There are 2 pools, boat rentals out front, ping pong tables, a spa, modern gym, and a cool area called Microsoft link in the lobby. The rooms are very nice. If possible, upgrade to a concierge room and you get a great breakfast and nice light dinner! The front desk staff and managers are awesome, they were very prompt on a few service request items. I love when they answer the phone from the room...hello Mr.... Downsides are parking price (save money on this...hint...check out SAN airport parking off site rates). Internet is NOT wireless in rooms. If you are flexible on your dates, they have great rates many times. Check on Sheraton web site or Kayak. Enjoy your stay. We are returning next month!

<Title>“Best Hospitality and Service I have ever experienced Anywhere! I will never stay anywhere else in San Diego!!”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina for my middle daughter's wedding in San Diego. I stayed with my wife and yo ungest daughter while my oldest daughter and her husband joined two days later. Because this happens to be a very busy time of year for the hotel and it was a very special occasion for me, I wrote an email to the General Manager of the Hotel asking if they could assist me in some special requests. Please bear in mind that I do not hold special status at Sheraton so it wouldn't warrant special service ordinarily. Much to my amazement and pleasure, I receiived an immediate response from Scott Hermes, the General Manager (who was also off that day) and also his Executive Assistant Helga Crum that they would work to try to accommodate my requests. They provided me with significantly more than I could have asked or even expected! A large room with a view together with a location within the complex that I had asked for and to top it off, they sent a note with a gift of wine, cheeses and fruits to welcome me to their hotel! They contacted me virtually every day via phone to see if I had everything I needed and offered even more assistance. This all came from the senior management of the hotel! And, just so you know it wasn't just the management that provides this service, the room service meals and personnel were equally pleasant, the food was great, and the smiles abounded. In addition, the maid service was timely and exceptional. When we needed extra towels and hangers, we received those with the same smile and immediacy of time. The front desk was more than courteous and helpful regardless of which one helped you and the valet parking made an effort to know who I was and which car was mine. Many times they welcomed me back by name. An exceptional hotel with very exceptional personnel. This is obviously a top down personification. If the management is first class, the people will be as well. This made a first class room that much better than any of their competition. As a senior executive, I travel extensively worldwide and have well in excess of 2,000 room nights over the past 10-12 years (yes, you read that correctly) and even with status at other properties, I have NEVER experienced the service, hospitality and genuine customer care that I experienced at this hotel! I can tell you that not only will I ONLY seek out this hotel every visit I have to San Diego, but because of this team, I have become a Sheraton Evangelist all over! I can't thank Helga enough, nor Scott enough! They are by far the best I have ever seen! And because of the service of other members of their team it reflects their value and class of care from the management on down. It may be a four star hotel, but in my book it was at least 5 stars! Thanks again Helga and Scott!!! You're the best!!!!

<Title>“What a disappointment.”
<Content>I booked a "deluxe" room for 4 nights for a special trip with my 10 year old daughter with a very helpful and nice phone representative of the hotel. I was told I would be on a high floor with a marina view room. When I received the e-mail confirmation I responded to confirm marina view and received a response in the affirmative. The day I arrival I called to verify marina view. Again I was told yes. When I arrived it was a parking lot view with a view of the city in the background. I complained and was told they didn't have another room. The clerk was rude and not helpful, I was treated as below her and not worth her time. At one point when I turned to get my wallet my daughter says she rolled her eyes. The clerk and the manager kept arguing that I was given a great view. Only if you like to hear and watch the traffic. The room itself was fine, nice bed but far from "deluxe." There is no sound proofing between the rooms. I could hear every word of the person next door on the phone. On Saturday night at midnight we were awaken by a drunken party next door. My daughter wanted me to explain what "playing quarters" was. The excessive load cursing, screaming and load music was unacceptable. At one point they ordered 2 bottles of vodka from room service. They were delivered and more beer was ordered. The hotel was helping create the problem not solving it The room was full of people like a frat party. It took 6 calls to guest services before anything was done - over an hour later. Each call the person on the phone was annoyed that I was calling. The location was great but not worth the price or the things my daughter learned from the strangers next door.

<Title>“Annual 4th of July Visit was Awesome!”
<Content>My wife and I got married at the Sheraton on 9/19/98 and have been going back ever since. Now we have two beautiful girls and have started a tradition of staying at the Sheraton (4-5 nights) for the 4th of July to enjoy what the property has to offer and the Big Bay Boom fire works show. This trip we had issues with our rooms we had reserved a year in advance with confirmations check-ins 6 months, 3 months and 1 month out the day we did check-in on July 1st. After trying to resolve the issue at the front desk with no resolution, my wife asked to talk to a manager. Daniel Ader was very receptive to our issue with our room. With a busy 3 day holiday weekend Daniel went above and beyond customer service to upgrade us from what we had reserved. By jumping through hoops to help us out we had one of the best times with our family and friends while staying this past 4th of July weekend. We also would like to thank a few others for their customer service, Lea, Jamie from the shoreline (pool bar & grill), Jake from the spa and Francisco our waiter for dinner at the Harbor’s Edge. We didn’t get the names of the two employees who manage the kid activities/games but they also did a great job as well. Our girls look forward to the games at the pool and love meeting the other kids that participate as well. We are looking forward to next years visit to the Sheraton.

<Title>“Very disappointed”
<Content>So disappointed...this was our final hotel in our family road trip down the California coast starting in San Francisco, passing through Carmel, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles and ending in San Diego at the Sheraton Marina. We had fantastic experiences in the other hotels - the Westin in San Francisco, Carmel Valley Ranch in Carmel and W Hotel in Westwood Village, LA were stand outs for service, hotel locations, facilities and all had their own unique wow factors. The Sheraton Marina had none of the above. We stayed in the second, smaller and definitely second rate Bay Tower. The rooms were fine apart from the noise of the ice machine across the corridor all through the night. It was unclear just how close the airport was from the web site (literally behind the hotel), so noise levels were unexpected. The lobby staff were miserable, we were never greeted with a smile and when I called guest services with a query about coins needed for the laundry, the guy said he didn't know and left it at that! Great training and service (not)! The public areas need serious upgrading and the bar and restaurant area was uninviting and dead most of the time. The pool was appalling - small with a bar area that was closed when we were there and seriously out of date. We felt like poor relations to the guests in the main tower where lobby, bar and pool areas were far superior. Not sure if the staff also felt miserable to be working in the second rate tower, but their indifference to service and general apathy was very disappointing after the high standards we had experienced through the rest of our trip. There were however 2 excellent restaurants a short walk from the hotel with incredible views of the San Diego sky line and marina (particularly at night) which I would highly recommend - The Lighthouse and Island Prime.

<Title>“Fantastic location and views”
<Content>Our family (incl 3 kids 16, 14 & 9) enjoyed a great stay at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina in San Diego. The views across to the city and out over the marina are fabulous and the hotel provides excellent seating areas to allow you to enjoy the views. The pool is a bit small for the size of the hotel and wasn't particularly clean but that was the only negative point that we found. The rooms are of standard size and are quite basic but are in keeping with the prices. The staff were very friendly, particularly the breakfast and bar staff. I recommend trying to upgrade to a Club Level Room as the views from the Club Lounge while enjoying an early evening drink and complimentary snack are well worth the extra. We wish we had allocated more time to stay in San Diego and we will definitely be back one day.

<Title>“over priced”
<Content>We stayed at the marina tower for 4 nights.... nice hotel. BUT.... local calls were $2.00 each time. and the sports bar downstairs was way too overpriced. Also, there is really no form of transportation other than taxi and a complimentary shuttle to the airport. So, every time we wanted to go anywhere we would have to add at the very least $30 to our day out just to get to and from anywhere. I would never stay there again. I would chose somewhere closer to downtown or even on Coronado Island... at least you can take a bus or walk to a restaurant. we felt forced to eat at the overpriced restaurant at the hotel because we didn't want to take a cab every time we wanted to eat. Another thing... my husband called front desk to ask where the nearest liquor store was. they told him he'd have to cab it to the nearest one which was 10 minutes away. Well... our last day there we went walking and bought a sandwich at their deli in between the bay tower and the marina tower. (by the way great sandwiches for a great price) turns out, they have wine & beer right in that deli. So FYI for those staying there..... the deli in between hotel was awesome!!!! they also had breakfast there for under $8 per person. Can't believe we found all that out on our last day!!! Hope we have saved a few $$ for all of you who are staying there :)

<Title>“San Diego Sheraton Marina”
<Content>The hotel was nice and clean. During checkin I found out the room had one king bed. I requested a room with 2 separate beds as there were 4 of us (2 adults and 2 kids). They said that is an upgrade and the cost is $20/day extra. They also charged $22/day for parking which I felt was high. During checkout there were several charges amounting to almost $30 which I could not recognize. It turns out that they have sensors on the snack cabinet and by merely opening the cabinet, they charge you even if you did not use any of the snacks. They took out those charges without any fuss.

<Title>“Nice Hotel”
<Content>We took a family vacation and booked 4 rooms for 4 nights. Was a little disappointed we were not in the marina tower, since obviously we were going to be there awhile. The marina tower has the outdoor firepits, large pool and outdoor bar. The pool in the bay tower is very shallow. Also, we were booked on the second floor, which was really ground level, when asked if we could all be moved to a higher floor was told it would be another $20 per night, per room. Not worth it. Staff was friendly and when I lost my phone in Quinns the first night was relieved when it was returned to me the next day!

<Title>“Wonderful accommodations...we won't stay anywhere else in San Diego!!!!”
<Content>We visited the Sherator San Diego Hotel & Marina for the first time recently. We stayed for about 11 days, and had an incredible experience. The hotel is beautiful and accommodating and the entire staff was very pleasant and helpful. We visit each year, and this facility far exceeded our expectations. We will be back here every year!

<Title>“Excellent hotel, great location”
<Content>Can't say enough good thngs about the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. I stayed with my husband and 2 year old son in the Bay Tower for 4 night July 6-10. Had a wonderful room facing the harbour. We loved being able to watch all the boats move about the harbour and had a great view of the Carl Vinson and Midway aircraft carriers. Rooms where spacious for a hotel room and had plenty of room for a crib. Also, absolutely no airport noise during the overnight hours. The grounds and buildings are clean and well kept. Everything, in my opinion appeared to be fairly modern and up to date. The pool at the Marina Tower are amazing and loved the poolside service. Being from Chicago the rate for valet ($28 a day) seemed more than reasonable and the valet staff was quick, friendly and eager to help or offer directions or recommendations. If and when we return to San Diego we'd definately stay here again. Thank you Sheraton for a great experience during our short California vacation.

<Title>“Once was enough! Poor customer service and overpriced!”
<Content>We were disappointed in our recent stay at the Sheraton San Deigo Hotel and Marina. We looked a pre-paid package that included a 3rd night free and 2 free breakfasts in the Bay Tower at least 6 weeks prior to our stay. When we arrived at the Bay view tower (which did have a nice view) we were told that the hotel was oversold and they could accomodate us in the Marina Tower. We had already unloaded the car and stood in the lobby ready to check in and it was the Bay tower we wanted. The Marina Tower is really quite separate from the Bay tower; like at one time they were different hotels?? Eventually the room we booked was magically available. Our 2 complimentary breakfasts however were not. Considering the adult breakfast buffet was $19 per person and the kids $11 each, we wanted to make sure that was covered. Again eventually the complimentary breakfasts were provided. The Room - The room was ok, not great and certainly did not feel newly refurished. There was a yellow stain the wall and the bathroom was old other than the newer facets. The beds were comfortable. We never had enough towels/washcloths for all 4 of us and they never replaced the shampoo or soap without a call down to the desk. The view was nice. The Staff - was not very friendly and the customer service was poor. Other - Parking is $22 a day. The lounge/dining room was WAY OVER PRICED. In-room internet was $11 a day. We go to San Diego every summer and we will not be returning to the Sheraton.

<Title>“Meh!”
<Content>Just a typical hotel. Tons of weddings going on so lots of drunk people stumbling around the lobby. Also, we stayed in the Bay Tower facing the airport...bad idea. Planes start taking off at 6am so if you like to sleep in I suggest staying on the other side of the the Tower. Also, the breakfast buffet at a Holiday Inn Express was better than this one. And for $19 per person I expected alittle more. My husband asked if they had any everything bagels. The hostess said "No we don't but everybody asks for them" WOW...just wow. It's very clean and very average. I guess it's good for families and weddings. Also $28 for overnight valet parking ($22 for self park) and $18.95 for one day of internet access. Just crazy!

<Title>“Outstanding service, our whole famly will be back next year!”
<Content>My girlfriend and I got the room as a gift from my Aunt and Uncle for the 4th of July weekend. We had no problems checking in, it was quick, easy and the lady who checked us in was very nice!. We absolutely loved the nautical style of decor considering we both work at a yacht club. That might have been the best that we've ever slept, the beds and pillows are out of this world comfortable. Rooms were clean, new furniture and a nice flat screen TV. We are so incredibly pleased with the fact that the WHOLE entire hotel is pet friendly, which we have a 5 month old puppy who loved the stay as much as we did! We had only a couple issues that were resolved very professionally. Parking is $22 a day which we didn't realize until we pulled our car in a parked, the hotel paid for our first night as a courtesy. We also had a small dining issue and the F&B manager Ronnie Hauptmann completely took care of us and went above and beyond to make sure our experience was amazing. The stay wouldn't have been as enjoyable without the care that he gave us! Very professional, courteous and hospitable. The front desk employee named Pedro gave us complimentary breakfast after we had a bad experience with the hot tub, again went above and beyond to make our romantic stay pleasurable. I spread the good word to our family who will all be staying there again next year! Again thanks to F & B manager Ronnie Hauptmann and guest service employee Pedro for taking the extra step to make our stay exceptional.

<Title>“WARNING - OVERCHARGED”
<Content>The hotel itself is OK, particularly if you are in the main tower, but management and staff are untrained or liars. Upon checking in I asked if there were any view rooms in the main tower or suites available (as a Platium guest I get a free upgrade). I was told that only rooms in the other tower were available. So off to the car and the other tower where we went to a room with virtually no view and strong cigarette smell. I made a quick call to a manager and was told there were view rooms in the main tower or I could choose a suite for my free upgrade? Back to the car and the main tower...getting exhausted now. Finally they overcharged me $184 versus my confirmed rate of $109??? Worst of all was the treatment I recieved from the Manager (Dena) when I called to get this corrected. First she treated me like I was lying (forward me your confirmation!), then she tried to explain that it was just the taxes etc... When I interupted her to explain it was not the taxes she became enraged that I called her lady and not by her name, sorry I forgot. There was a huge toyota meeting and they were treating those people like royalty and everyone else seemed to get second rate treatment, I heard that from other guests as well at the bar, not professional (I believe that is why they were holding extra rooms in the main tower?).

<Title>“Ideal hotel for super early flight departure”
<Content>Seeking a hotel in close proximity to the airport with reliable shuttle service, we chose the Sheraton across from the airport on Harbor Island. Unreliable taxi service from hotels further afar in the past made this hotel an easy choice, its shuttle begins operating at 4:45a.m. We booked a standard room in the Harbor tower and were in no time checked in by friendly staff, upgraded to a 10th floor room with balcony and a beautiful view of the comings and goings in San Diego Harbor. The room was very large, well appointed, brightly lit, spotless, including the carpet which appeared new. A super large king bed with soft sheets and good pillows made for a good night of sleep. Airport noise was not audible at all, but walls do not completely muffle very noisy Vacu-flush toilets in adjacent rooms. A 48" flat screen TV, safe, stocked mini-bar, and a coffee maker with Starbucks coffee packets, desk and a comfortable seating group rounded out the amenities. Not quite up to par was the on-site restaurant which is really a dimly lit bar with tiny round tables, more suited to have a drink than to have dinner (the actual restaurant area is roped off and set aside for breakfast use only). Wanting to have dinner we chose from the limited menu a light meal which was tasty and met our needs. Danny who wears the hats of bartender, waiter, busboy and does everything but prepare the food he serves with a smile as well. Only one other person ate in the restaurant, which may be an indication that other nearby establishments on Harbor Island are a better dining choice. Nevertheless, the hotel perfectly matched our needs, and should we have another flight at an ungodly early hour, we will stay there again.

<Title>“Relaxing Memorial weekend”
<Content>Great hotel. Stayed there before. Fairly excellent location. $10-$12 cab ride to most everywhere one wants to go--Old Town, Sea World, Downtown. Right on the water at the marina with a nice pool and outside setup. $22 a day for parking is a bit stiff if you have a car, but it is understandable being so close to the airport (they don't want airport parkers). Starbuck's on site makes coffee choices numerous and easy. One restaurant is on the spendy side, the other is a bar scenario and a welcome respite at the end of the day. Free wireless in the lobby and a big bank of computers for free use just beyond the lobby.

<Title>“Nice view of downtown skylight”
<Content>Use price line bidding and got this hotel. Not much of a saving using price line. There are two towers for this hotel, one is the Marina Tower which is across from the airport. This is the main tower with all the amenities, large reception area, free computers, larger pool, spa, etc. We pulled to the front of the Marina Tower and the bellman checked the guest list and told us we were at the other tower, the Bay Tower. It was efficient and we didn’t have to get out of the car. The Bay Tower is ¼ mile around the corner from the Marina Tower. It’s doesn’t have the glamour lobby. There was only one computer in the lobby. It has a small outdoor pool next to the parking lot. It feels like lower class in the Bay Tower. Parking was $22/day. The room key card worked fine for the parking access. The front desk staffs at the Bay Tower are efficient, but indifferent. They’re not rude but not friendly either. They’re just doing their job to check you in, check you out and answer your questions. The hallway was dim, not brightly lit. The room is renovated and spacious. Each room has a wall to wall balcony, great view of either the harbor/downtown or the marina with boats. We did hear the airplane noise and it woke us up early in the morning. No need for wake-up call. Firm bed and king size pillows for king size bed. Sheets are winkle free. There is mini bar and you’ll get charged if you removed an item, even if you replace it. There is no fridge in the room. The bathroom was small but it has everything we need. The hotel is in Harbor Island, away from the busy downtown, yet it’s very close to it. It has a great view of downtown skylight at night. . It’s also next to the airport so we can hear the airplane noise from our room. It’s also close to Balboa Park, the Zoo, Sea World and other attractions. There is only one restaurant near the hotel. There are no other restaurants and stores near the hotel. It’s kind of isolated. This is a great alternative to staying at downtown or hotel circle or mission bay. Short drive to attractions on local road, no need to use the freeway and stuck in traffic.

<Content>Stayed here the last night of our trip to fly out early the next morning. Check in was easy, and the agent was very helpful. I asked for a map to Enterprise so my husband could go drop off the rental car, and she called Enterprise and arranged for them to pick up the car for no charge. The room was comfortable and clean. The bathroom is small, but we were only at this property for one night. Airport shuttle was easy and complimentary. Great value if you book online and prepay.

<Title>“VIP Treatment - what a hotel stay should be”
<Content>I try to get out on occasion and "visit" San Diego so I don't forget to enjoy the beauty of my city. I had a Staycation at this hotel over the Memorial Day weekend. There are so many great hotels in San Diego and I've had some great stays in other cities as well. I travel a few times each year for business and pleasure - and I can honestly say that this was the best overall experience that I've had. The staff was wonderful. My great experience started at check-in and didn't stop until check-out. The room was quiet, comfortable, and the modern design was so beautiful. The view of the marina was breathtaking and got better with the sunset. I enjoyed lounging by the pool and taking a stroll on the grounds. The dinner from Harbor's Edge was so good and the view of the fireworks at Seaworld after dinner from my balcony as fun. The next morning I capped off my stay with a breakfast (outstanding) and a few spa treatments. Every person that I came in contact with responded as though I was the most important person in the hotel I have plans to return for a personal stay, as well as to bring an event there so everyone can share the experience.

The staff was extremely helpful. I requested a roll away for one night and it came within a few minutes...I was amazed at the quick response. The exercise facility is state of the art!...not your usual cramped little hotel room converted into an exercise room. I left something in the room when I departed. I called back 2 weeks later and the staff gladly mailed it to me at their expense. I'll definitely be back!

<Title>“Very enjoyable stay”
<Content>Our airline's flight and hotel package offered several hotel choices. We liked the look of the Sheraton and marina, but were aware that it was some distance from the downtown area, so we had to factor in extra cost for cabs and plan our days' events. The hotel is basically across from the airport. We heard planes now and then, but it was not disruptive at all. Check-in was very efficient, and extremely friendly (thank-you Dinah!). Arriving in the morning, we expected to check our bags, and get our room later in the day, but we got our room right away. We were offered our choice of the two buildings, and picked the main one, knowing the rooms were smaller but it had more restaurants etc. We were asked for our view preference, and chose the marina view (gorgeous). The room was a decent size, very nicely furnished and clean. The beds were extremely comfortable, and had beautiful linens. We opted for the 'green' choice and didn't have daily housekeeping but towels were replaced upon request. This gave us a daily $5 voucher towards food/beverages, which we used for our morning coffee at Starbucks (located in the lobby). Our package also included breakfast, which is pricey in my opinion. If we had paid off the menu for our breakfast, including a fruit bowl (delicious), juice, coffee and main item, the price per person would have been at least $30. Without having a car, we had breakfast every day at the hotel (food and service were both excellent). Be prepared to drive or take cabs to get around, as there is very little in the immediate area within walking distance. We weighed the option of renting a car vs paying cab fare to get around. Daily parking at the hotel is $22. Added to the cost of car rental, and not being familiar with the area, we decided to travel by cab. Allow (pre-tip, round trip) approx. $30 to/from Old Town, $56 to/from Coronado (hotel Del Coronado), $25 to/from downtown/Gaslamp Quarter. With only 4 days, and much on our agenda, we didn't have a chance to spend time at the pool or use any of the other amenities. Quinn's sports bar was a nice place to end our day (kids are allowed, even though it's called a bar). There is a free computer area for web-surfing, email etc., and for printing boarding passes (note - in-room internet is $11.95/day). Since our room was included with our airline package, it's difficult to rank the value, but while we were there, the 'walk-in' rate was $199/night. We did not use the mini-bar or room service. All of the staff that we met - front desk, concierge, restaurant, bar, valets, cleaning - were extremely friendly and helpful. All in all, we were very pleased with this hotel and I would definitely recommend it.

<Title>“Good Base of Operations for SD”
<Content>Had no idea that this was an "airport" hotel until we arrived. Right across the street from Lindbergh Field. That was fine though as the hotel had a nice resort feel to it. Self Park was 22.00 and valet 28.00 or so. Couldnt find a spot so we went with Valet. Service was prompt when we called for our car. We were assigned on the 11th floor of the Marina tower which is the main building with the lobby and restaurants. The floor said Starwood Preferred Guests floor. Thought that was odd, but as an SPG member it was nice to have a high floor. There are 3 separate towers and are actually spread out along the marina. the view of the SD skyline was great as well as the runway at the airport. Im a fan of the romance of planes coming and going so it wasnt too bad. The sound proofing was good as we didnt here to much from the airport. Room is standard size and we had a double. Bathroom was really small with combo shower/bath. TV was also on the smaller side of 32 inches. Room service was available 24 hours and a late night burger after a wedding hit the spot. Hotel caters to the convention/conference crowd. Still felt very welcomed by the staff upon arrival. Access to Downtown/Gaslamp was about 10 minutes and the beaches are another 15 minutes or so. Would rather stay in Gaslamp area next time we are in town. Not a bad choice though if you need to be near the airport and close to attractions.

<Title>“Wow!”
<Content>This property is very good. We enjoyed two nights in a double room in the Marina Tower, overlooking the pool and the marina. There is an in-house Starbucks (I'm an addict-so this was quite convenient) We enjoyed the food and drinks from the sports bar, the outdoor firepits, the walks along the harbor, and the peace and quiet. Even though it's right across from the airport, the plane noise was negligible. We were able to purchase tickets for the Old Town Trolley tour, picked up right at the hotel (at a decent hour, I must add). Truly recommend the experience this hotel offers.

<Title>“Wonderful View, great location”
<Content>This hotel is right on the harbor and the view is great. We walked along the water and looked at all the boats/yachts. We were there for 5 days. The restaurant is great, food is good, service was good. The ice cream store became a daily stop for us; also ordered a picnic lunch for one day which was great. The only downside was that we agreed to go green when we checked in which we understood to mean that sheets would not be changed every day. That was fine - we don't change them at home every day. But as it turned out, they didn't do any housekeeping at all. We had to call everyday to have them pick up garbage and bring clean towels. You would think they would vacuum, dust, clean the bathroom, change the towels, empty the wastebaskets. So if you don't care about any of that then go green - we won't do it again! Other than that, it's a really nice place to stay. So because of that, I gave them a poor grade on cleanliness - it was very clean when we checked in, though.

<Title>“Never go back”
<Content>I am a Starwood Gold Member and I was extremely disappointed by our stay over Memorial Day. When we got to the hotel we were directed to the Bay Tower which I later found out was a Raddison just recently purchased by Sheraton. While the rooms were big with great views the noise level at this hotel was terrible. We virtually got no sleep while we were there. In addition I did not find the staff there were very accomdating or friendly. Would stay at the Westin gaslamp in the future or elsewhere.

<Title>“less than stellar experience this time around”
<Content>The hotel itself has really cool nautical decorations and I love the fish tank in the lobby. Our room was located right over the pool and it was really really loud due to some music that was being played at a high volume the whole weekend. We asked to be moved to another room, but they wouldn't move us, even after repeated requests. The food in the hotel restaurants was quite expensive, which we expected, but the quality did not match the price. It was greasy and made us feel kind of ill. The best part of the whole experience was when we rented bicycles and rode around San Diego. There is a deli the concierge recommended that was in walking distance...DO NOT GO THERE...rude staff and disgusting food!

<Title>“In need of help!”
<Content>I would like to have one of your managers noted for having done a great job in helping a customer in trouble. I came in from out of state with nothing but debit cards and did not notify my bank. I therefore was unable to get any cash out of any atm machine. When I asked for help, everyone told me sorry there wasn't anything they could do to help me. When I asked to speak to a manager, along came Jonathan Flores, who patiently listen and said that he could help me out of my dilema. I was so relieved. I was able to catch a Padres game and my stay here with you went from a nightmare to a pleasant, stress free vacation. So please extend my sincere appreciation to Jonathan Flores for being such a professional and caring part of your fabulous organization. Sincerely, Mr. Rolando C Salas

<Content>Stayed here with our college age kids for spring break. We were placed in the older hotel, which some think of as less desirable than the newer one, but we loved it. The rooms were large and spacious and we had a view of the bay. Very nice.

<Title>“San Diego... a hotel experience not to be missed.”
<Content>This hotel is great for business and individual travelers. It is close to the airport but you do not have the noise of the planes and it offers many amenities for all to enjoy., The staff and service in all departments is wonderful...Most of the employees have been at the property for many years and it has a family feel to all that they do. The food is excellent and a good value for what you receive. All the rooms have a water view..but of course the higher the floor the better. The property is close to downtown and a cab ride away from many activities other restaurants or shopping areas. The meeting space works well for business but it is on the far side and does not bother any of the individual travelers. I would recommend this property to anyone looking for a all around good experience while visting and staying in San Diego .

<Title>“Sue offered her personal items to make up my mistake, BIG thanks!”
<Content>I am so impressed that "Sue from Chicago" was my angel for offering help last weekend, San Diego Rock and Roll Marathon event. I was unpacking my gear and realized I had two left shoes. Not what I want to realize at 5pm the day before the marathon. I called the hotel line and got "Sue from Chicago" to ask about internet connections so I could locate a Target or something. Sue asked my shoe size and offered her shoes if they were in her car, and could I wait 10 minutes for her break. She met me in the lobby and had actually taken them out of her car. I was so impressed that an employee would offer something of thiers for my event. I want to give a shout out to Sue, and I LOVED the bedding. Two down pillows and two something else pillows. I love down. San Diego. Late check out request. So, this was a great experience for me with the customer service. A bed is a bed, but Sue, you made my evening with your offer and follow up. And the hotel was great.

<Title>“All the extras really add up”
<Content>Although the hotel was nice and clean and comfortable, they really nickel and dime you for everything, so I would not recommend staying here. You have to pay a ridiculous nightly rate for parking ($22 to $28 per night), you have to pay for internet access and the food in the restaurant is exorbitantly priced and not any better than any other restaurant. They also had the nerve to tell me that I could not feed my baby her baby food at breakfast because it was "outside food." Really? Were they going to go in the back an puree organic sweet potatoes for her to eat? Probably not.

<Title>“Very impressed with the efficiency of this hotel!”
<Content>Was looking for somewhere to sleep near the airport and booked into this hotel at the last minute. I was extremely impressed with the property and staff. Check-in took less than 3 minutes for my 2 rooms - I've never run into front desk staff so efficient (but still friendly). The hotel is clean and well taken care of. Rooms are reasonable size, beds comfortable. Soundproofing must be extensive, as planes flying directly overhead were almost completely unnoticeable. Great views from the balcony as well. Excellent shower - the best I had on the trip! No problems with this hotel and I would not hesitate to recommend it to others.

<Content>We are writing this letter to thank you for the voucher we recieved for a stay at your hotel. This allowed us to be away for a night to enjoy each others company and remind ourselves why we are together and how much we love each other. Our son Erik was born almost eleven years ago he has a diagnosis of Tetrasomy 18p, this entails an array of disorders. He has overcome many challenges that most cannot imagine, we have become quite familiar with many specialist, Doctors offices, Emergency rooms, special programs, school meetings to help Erik become as independent as possible. He has been our number one priority and has never been without us at any time over the past eleven years. It was the first time we have spent one entire day alone with no children during that time. We cannot describe how wonderful a day we had we would like to thank UCP and the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina from the bottom of our hearts and may you recieve many blessings.

<Content>After having been to San Diego on several prior occasions, I was hoping that my group would be staying at the Manchester Grand. Upon arrival at the Sheraton, I was pleasantly suprised. The nautical decor at the hotel was beautiful. Full service Starbucks, restaurant, computer area, ping pong tables, fitness, pool, club level lounge - everything was great. The club level lounge offered breakfast, hor d'euves, bottled water, beautiful view and clean decor. We had a room with two double beds. Not two queens which was interesting. Very enjoyable stay overall! Beautiful marina views.

<Title>“Booked on Priceline - Excellent Value”
<Content>We decided to take a long weekend trip to San Diego to visit some friends that live in the area, and booked this hotel by selecting a 4-star "name your own price" deal on Priceline. I believe we only paid $95 per night. Overall, for $95 a night, this hotel was excellent value. We had a nice large room, with a balcony overlooking the marina. The room was spacious, clean and had been renovated, although the hotel itself is quite old. We ate the breakfast buffet which was also good. PROS: - Excellent value @ $95 per night when booking on priceline. - Good breakfast buffet - Great location (close to Downtown and the Airport) - Nice, clean, spacious rooms CONS: - Older Hotel - Rates may by higher when not booking through priceline

<Title>“Definitely 4 star”
<Content>I stayed here one night on a business trip. Got a great rate compared to the downtown hotels. This is the only hotel that is at the entrance to the airport, so if you want an airport hotel, this is it. It is also right in the middle of the marina with boats and beautiful views in every direction. Check in was quick because it was late night. Got upgraded as a SPG member even though I was paying a very low rate. The room was bigger than average because of the curvature of the room. Exceptionally clean with 42" flat tv and nicely decorated. King bed was big and comfortable. I only heard one plane before I dozed off, but the room is sound proofed well. The lobby is bigger then most hotels downtown. It has a great social/computer center with free Internet and computer use. There are two restaurants and two different bars, and a full service Starbucks. Although the prices for food in the bar were high, I think they are on par with most 4 star hotels. While the menu had some high priced items, there were many items in the $12-16 range. Although parking is $22, this is the same if not less than what many 3 star hotels charge downtown. I have paid as much as $36. Since there are dozens of hotel choices in the downtown area, this hotel only makes sense for me if I don't need to get around the city. Although only 2 miles from the heart of downtown, it is on a peninsula and a little detached from anything other than the marina and airport. On the other hand, it's location provides great views, particularly at sunrise and sunset while viewing the big city in the background.

<Title>“Fabulous!”
<Content>This was our third stay at this great hotel and the service was even better than ever. The location is perfect for us, within a few minutes of all the great San Diego beaches and parks. From arrival to check out the staff could not have been nicer, they were very warm, genuine and welcoming. Especially Chris at the front desk and the servers in the club lounge and the harbors edge restaurant. We enjoyed great food and a lovely comfortable room with gorgeous views overlooking the Marina. Our toddler was mesmerized by the amazing yachts in the marina and the beautiful aquarium in the lobby and our tweener loved the 'link' in the lobby. Our favorite spot was the firepit by the marina, the perfect place for sunset.

<Title>“Lovely Hotel and Staff”
<Content>We were a bit apprehensive after seeing the Trip Advisor reviews and ratings, but this place was really very good. We knew about the $22 a day parking charge, but beacause we got a good deal on the room, overall it was still an inexpensive four star hotel away from the city centre. The staff were lovely, there are complimentary newspapers, and the room, although not massive, was comfortable for two, and the beds/pillows are divine. There are seven free computers in the lobby for guests to use - brilliant ! On the down side, my wife thought the spa to be overall lacking in facilities, the maid forgot to service our room on the second day, and it isn't really within walking distance of alternative eateries, so you'd need to use your car. We ate in the Boathouse Restaurant about a mile away on Harbor Island and the food/service was fantastic (but not cheap).

<Title>“Nice hotel, a couple of problems”
<Content>Overall this hotel and experience was nice. We did run into a couple of problems that will have me looking elsewhere to stay next time even though we are SPG members and try to stay at Starwood properties when we can. The first is the pricing in the restaurants. Obviously all hotels charge a premium but charging $8 for a kids meal which consists of a stale Smuckers Crustable? Second is the parking situation. At $22 a day, which again we realize parking is always going to be high and we spent $22 at the next hotel we stayed at on this vacation, although that was for valet parking. The lot that you park in is a dirt lot that is easily 1/2 mile from your room while they are allowing non-guests to also park in the lot for a fee which makes it even more difficult to find a spot. On check out when we mentioned the parking lot issue the SPG desk clerk acted as though she had no idea what we were referring to and really didn't care. If your room is near the pool be aware that it is very loud. We had to finally call at 11:30 to ask them to turn down the music which they did but it was amazing that they let it go that long.

<Title>“Great location & Great Price!”
<Content>We love staying in Mission Bay when we come to San Diego but wanted something different. I got a good deal on hotwire. Location was nice. Next to the airport but the sounds weren't too bad like other peoples comments. (and I'm a light sleeper) We stayed in the lanai section and loved it. It was a 3 story building next to the main hotel. Loved the 2 pools and view from our room. We had a view of a pool and marina. It was also close to the parking lot and didn't have to deal with the lobby area. We even watched the fireworks from Seaworld from our hotel. Parking is alot but you pay that at most 4 star hotels. The only complaint I had was the bathroom was very small. The door would hit you when you were sitting on the toilet. When you have small kids, that's not fun! Was also hard getting into the shower/bath if the door was open. Loved the starbucks and computer lounge area in the lobby.

Not happy with the service. The hotel is in an isolated area with no cafes, resturants, you are forced to eat in their extremely expensive resturants, not good for family with budget.

<Title>“Very Clean. Not a 4 star.”
<Content>Stayed with my family over an early Spring Break in April. This is not a true 4 star. It felt like a 3 star. Not plush in any way. Very basic. Plastic cups in the bathroom. Nothing special. Though the hotel is nice and clean. It is an uneventful place to stay. It is walking distance to some good restaurants. But you have to get in your car to go to any other fun places in the city. Parking is $24! My 7 and 5 year olds enjoyed having the marina to look out to every morning. Other than that, there was nothing for them to do in the hotel. As the weather was drab. We stayed in the new building. I was told the older building had more to it. Starbucks and such.

<Content>Perfect! The beds were comfortable, and I was able to sit on my private patio in the sun. Although it is not downtown, it is very close! A trolley shuttle runs in the morning and a free airport shuttle is available too! Free internet in the lobby means keeping in touch and you can look up things to do. The pool area was beautiful. The only issues were an ill informed concierge, and they did not restock the minibar. The restaurants in the hotel were very good, and I especially enjoyed the Tapa/Martini bar - ask for Scott! ;)

The rooms were natical themed and very comfortable. Went with friends and they came to our room that night and we played cards and had a bottle of wine and cheese my daughter had sent me for mothers day thru room service. It was fantastic. Then when it was time to hit the sheets I was double impressed. The sheets were so nice and new. They were like sleeping in brand new sheets for the first time. I was overly impressed with the Sheraton. Definately would re-visit. Debbie Schlotbom

<Title>“Really good, except for the major headache”
<Content>My boyfriend and I booked a trip out to San Diego - first time in CA for both of us. The hotel was super close to the airport and the continuous shuttle (runs to and from both Bay and Marina Towers every 15-20 mintues) was great. We used that everyday to get to the airport and pick up the city bus. The room was very nice and clean, and the view of the bay/downtown from the Bay Tower was AMAZING. The voucher for refusing room service is a nice deal. We were never bothered by any airport noise. The big problem we ran into was on our third night there, the room key stopped working. We walked down to the desk and were told that there was a problem with our enitre floor's keys and they would send someone up. Not exactly sure why they didn't have someone stationed on our floor to let everyone in if they knew there was a problem. Fifteen minutes later someone finally showed up to let us in. Meanwhile, a couple down the hall had no problem getting in their room - so much for the entire floor having problems. We were told it would be fixed. The next day we were getting ready to leave in the morning, trying to catch the city bus on time. I forgot something in the room and ran upstairs to grab it. But the key still didn't work. We spoke to the front desk and the lady there was surprised we were having problems. Obviously didn't get the memo from the other front desk people. When we returned that night, the key still wasn't working. Again, the front desk seemed totally unaware that there was a problem. Luckily the replacement key we were given worked for that night and the next night too. Overall, a really nice hotel - with using the shuttle to get the bus at the airport made it easy to get downtown. Would have given it four stars, but being locked out of your room three times isn't much fun.

<Content>I was little nervous about the hotel when reading all of the negative comments. I went there for 4 day and 3 nights for work/leisure with family. Check in really quick and the front desk was very courteous. Room was very clean and the view was good. Some airport/airplane noise. They could use better quality of toiletry. Bed was fantastic!!!! Somewhat of limited parking...parked in the dirt parking 3 out of 4 days but it was only 20 yards of extra walking. Ate at Quinn's...good service and decent food. Went to Starbucks for 2 breakfast/coffee....employees need to stop yawning when working the cash register (both days). Otherwise, good hotel and good employees!

<Content>The hotel is clean, up to date and very close to the airport (but not in the flight path so not too much noise). The price seemed high, but then again everything is outragous in CA. We were at a conference and the hotel did a good job putting it on. Had one lunch in the bar and it was tasty. It is fairly close to downtown (about a $15 cab ride to Petco Park). The exercise room was as good as gym.

The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful. The bayside view was wonderful. The location is great and getting to the main attractions is easy. I would strongly recommend this hotel to others and definitely plan on going back. I am VERY critical when it comes to hotels so trust me when I say this is well worth the money.

<Title>“Bay tower is average, very far from San Diego city, airport noise is loud!”
<Content>Upon booking with Sheraton, i read reviews on here and specifically requested that we be booked in the main tower. Alas, we were in the Bay Tower... Which looks extremely old and run down in comparison to the main tower. We never went to the main tower, as we had to drive to get everywhere anyway, so can't really compare. Upon arrival, got told that our prepaid booking was cancelled, but luckily they reinstated it fairly quickly and upgraded us to a high floor. That was quite annoying, but not their fault, more my travel agents but oh well. Guest services staff were lovely. Room was comfortable, not outstanding, but ok. View of marina was pretty, but this was overshadowed by the constant planes that were overhead. Was not told that we were so close to the airport, nor so far away from downtown. MUST have a car if staying here, otherwise it would be annoying to get anywhere! A huge plus is the business centre that has free unlimited internet, which was a godsend after a week and a half of expensive internet. You have to log in each hour, but its worth it! The gift shop was cute, and had some cool stuff. Overall, not sure i would choose either of these Sheraton's as they are too far away from the city centre for my liking....

<Content>Awesome staff. Great location! We stayed in the main building and it was beautiful. The rooms were clean and very tastefully decorated. It's next to the hotel, but we never once heard the planes. My only gripe is the parking fees. $22 a day for self-parking and $28 for valet. We decided to valet since there was an event going on when we arrived and self-parking was pretty full. The valet service was awesome. We would call down before leaving the room and our car would be waiting for us when we got to the front door. Just wish they could give hotel guests a break on the parking fees.

<Content>I recently took a day trip with friends and we stopped into the spa at the Sheraton for massages and some relaxation, and it was amazing! The staff was extremely helpful, the spa director personally came out to greet us and ensured we had any and everything we needed through the afternoon, the front desk attendant was extremely pleasant and helpful and the masseuse (I had Gary, highly recommend!) was spectacular. After my hour massage, I was so relaxed I didn't want to get up! Afterward my friends and I hung out by the hot tub and pool for the remainder of the afternoon which was great to continue our day of relaxation. The hot tub was spacious and the pool temperature was just right, plus, not too mention the great view of marina...it doesn't get much better than that! All in all it was probably one of the most relaxing days I have ever had and I can't wait to plan the next visit.

<Title>“Nice view, but remote”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton with my wife and two daughters (ages 6 and 3). From reading other entries, I realized that I should request the Bay Tower, which I understand the rooms are a little older (although recently renovated) and a little bigger. We stayed on the eight floor, which had a great view of San Diego Bay. Our stay included the weekend, so we had a great view of the boats traversing by. One factor to consider is that the Bay Tower is approximately a quarter mile from the main facility at the Marina Tower and Lanai areas. I didn't really spend time at the other areas, but I heard that the amenities (business area, resturant and pool) may be a little nicer there. We wanted the bigger room and the view. We did have breakfast at the restaurant at the Bay Tower. It is buffet-style with the basic bacon/sausage, eggs/omlette, potatoes. There are also breakfast pastries, oatmeal, cold cereal and fruit. It is nice, The cost is what you would expect from a place higher-end hotel like the Sheraton. The pool area at the Bay Tower is a little small. There is also a hot tub. If the pool area is of particular interest for your family, I'd suggest staying at the Marina Tower and/or Lanai. Because of the weather, we didn't use the pool. Location is a bit remote. Hotel is right across the entrance to San Diego Airport. I could see how it would be convenient for a business meeting with people flying in from across the country. However, it is 10-15 minutes away from Horton Plaza/Downtown/Gaslamp District. It is about the same distance to Balboa Park and and the San Diego Zoo. As such, you will need vehicle transportation to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city (and pay for parking at most places along the way). Self-parking was $22/night. You use your room key to get in and out (so make sure you have it). It is commeasurate with the downtown hotels. I'm note sure why it is so expensive, but make sure that you factor that into your plans. The Wall Street Journal and USA Today were available in the lobby. In all, we had a good stay at the Sheraton. We really enjoyed the view from our room. However, the location is a bit farther away if you were expecting to be in the heart of the action in San Diego.

<Title>“Indifferent”
<Content>Stayed here en route home and needed to be near airport for a 6 am flight. Arrived late, area didn't seem very safe and wouldn't have walked around alone. Hotel slightly jaded, room fine but reception area and restaurant shabby. Food indifferent, wine expensive, Shuttle service to airport only runs from 6 so no good for me. Was told a taxi would be no problem but in the event had to wait 20 minutes and ended up running! With retrospect I'd rather have paid a little more and stayed in a better hotel where I'd have felt safer, enjoyed the evening more and got a taxi with no problem the next morning

<Title>“No longer barefoot”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton on a business trip (although i did have a couple days to play). This was my first visit to San Diego and your Hotel made my stay all the more fabulous. The room was kept clean throughout my stay and all of the staff were helpful and pleasant. I flew back to Sacramento and realized i left a rather expensive pair of shoes in the room. I called and left a message for "Lost and Found" and withing a few hours Nicholas had returned my call and got the ball rolling to get my shoes back to me. Within 3 days i had them back. It was just one more wonderful experience that your hotel provide me with. Thank you Nicholas.... Thank You Sheraton. Ayren

<Title>“Great View - Far Away”
<Content>I've stayed at this hotel more than a few times, using Priceline of course. Even though it seems its close to downtown, it really isn't. It is however across the street from the airport, so it would be very convenient for someone just flying into the city for the first time. The hotel is clean, has a beautiful view of the San Diego bay, and the staff is pretty nice, but at times non existent. The rooms are pretty nice, and they make you feel like you are staying on a boat (very nautical). The only issues with the hotel is that the parking is fairly expensive ($25 a night), even though its nowhere near downtown, so why charge downtown prices?! I would still stay there again, and that's because of the value your getting compared to the costs that you pay compared to hotels downtown, but then again you have to take a little value away for location.

<Title>“Does Not Cater for Children”
<Content>Quite a nice Hotel in a location that is betwixt and between. Not really within walking distance of any facilities (cafes, shops etc) but has a beautiful outlook over the Marina. Very handy to the airport though, if you are flying in. Our room faced the Marina so aircraft noise was not a problem. May be different on airport side. The TV selection is skewed towards business with very few Childrens channels. Glad we had a room at the main building as the other section was quite a distance. Must mention Rocio as she was a standout server.

<Title>“San Diego Harbor island ROCKS! Top of the line service!”
<Content>Best 27 anniversary we have experienced. We arrived on Friday evening after driving from Arizona, and from that point on it was just perfect.. We were greeted by a very professional friendly staff and went on up to our room. We proceeded out to the balcony to enjoy a beautiful view of the boats and the bay.. We were very tired and ordered room service the gentleman was so friendly and the food was delicious, in fact we ordered room service a few more times during our stay and had coffee and desert in the hotel restaurant and every time it was excellent our stay was so enjoyable and the room was so clean and everything was so perfect always want to stay with Sheraton the staff that was top of the line this Sheraton was on harbor island drive. I would choose this hotel over any other when in San Diego....

<Title>“Sacrifice convenience for quality”
<Content>I stayed here for the weekend with my 10 year old daughter. I got a good rate for the hotel for under $100 a night at Priceline so I thought. First of all from the reviews I expected the Marina Tower to be a better fit so asked for an upgrade and got one from the desk agent at an unexpected extra $20 a night. Now the Marina tower is nice because it has a restaraunt, bar, starbucks and heated pool along with full service gym. However if you want a bigger room and in my opinion better views stay at the Bay tower. They have a basic lobby but if you don't need all the ammenities I previously mentioned then that place is probably the better location. The bay tower is serviced by a free shuttle. I would stay at the bay tower next time. As far as transportation service. My daughter and I relied on public transportation. The shuttle takes you to the airport where you catch the bus. Since we relied on public transportation this place was not convenient. If you plan to travel the same way choose a place closer to the hub of transportation (downtown). I rented a car the last day and found free parking on the pennisula. This is closer to the bay tower and is a cheap way to park your car. Be advised there are only about 15 free parking spaces that are 3 hour time limit but free all night after 11. All and all the hotel is nice but I wouldn't stay here if you plan on exploring San Diego. We had a "Go Card" so that is what we did. I would like to thank "Angelique" at the front desk for her professional and kind service in dealing with the charges for my room. Noise is not an issue. PLenty of computers at business center so WIFI is not necessary

<Title>“Nice hotel”
<Content>I booked a room through Hotwire and stayed one night at this hotel in San Diego. It is conveniently located near the airport and offers a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. My room was spacious and had a nice view of the bay. Overall it was a pleasant stay. The only negative I saw was the hotel has two separate towers, the Bay and Marina Towers. My room was located in the Bay tower which is not connected to the main hotel where most of the amenities are located. It was a 3-4 minute walk to the other tower where the pool, main restaurant, Starbucks and fitness room were located. This ended up working fine for me as I was only staying one night and just walked to the main area, however if I was booking a longer stay I would request a room in the main tower. The only other negative I saw was the bathroom was a bit on the small side and had peeling wallpaper. It really needed some refreshing.

<Title>“Nice hotel. Management could use an attitude adjustment.”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sheraton for a little vacation in San Diego. The location was a bit of an issue at first because we thought it was going to be downtown, so it was further away than we thought. We fell in love with the view from our room and the girls at the concierge helped us rent a car so we could get around the city better. The beds were comfortable and our room was always spotless when we returned from sight seeing. It was also nice that there was a Starbucks in the hotel. Our only issues with this hotel was the overpriced, poor quality breakfast buffet and the unhelpful, rude hotel manager we had a run-in with. I have been all over the world and stayed in a variety of hotels, the breakfast buffet at the Sheraton wasn't even comparable to a continental breakfast at a Holiday Inn. Poorly cooked eggs and rotten fruit cost us $19 each! The other issue with the manager happened on friday night (April 8th). We were looking for parking and could not find any on one side of the hotel and the other side was blocked. We were exhausted and just wanted to get to our room. We asked a valet what the problem was and we were informed that there was a large wedding the next day that required the whole other side of the parking lot. We asked if we could valet for the same price as regular parking (Reg is $22 and Valet is $28), he said he would have to ask the manager. We pulled over and waited for a decision. The manager on duty came to our car and rudely informed us again of the wedding and that he would not valet our car for anything less than $28. We asked what we were supposed to do and he condescendingly told us we would have to park in employee parking that was very far away from the hotel and unpaved (it was raining so it was a big muddy mess). My boyfriend expressed that this was unacceptable and as guests we should have parking close the hotel. The manager then yelled at him that we would have to park there or not at all and there was nothing else he could do for us and walked away without another word. Like I said I travel quite frequently and have stayed in 5 star hotels and no-star hotels and I have never had some speak to me the way that manager did (I wish I could remember his name). Sheraton should take more care in training their entire staff to meet the needs of their guests, especially their managers. Overall the staff was very friendly and helpful, but one bad seed can ruin a nice evening.

<Title>“Perfect”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina for two days. We were leaving on a cruise and wanted to spend a day exploring San Diego. The hotel has a shuttle at the airport. It runs on a continuous loop. There is no need to call the hotel to arrange pick up. The driver was very nice and offered some advice about things to do in San Diego. We stayed in the Marina tower in a club level room. The room was nicely appointed. The shower had plenty of hot water. The bed was comfortable. We had a very nice view of the marina. I enjoyed having my morning coffee out on the balcony. We enjoyed the club lounge. There were hot appetizers at night and a continental breakfast in the morning. There is a computer in the lounge with free internet access. Be prepared to wait in line as there is only one computer. The pool area was fantastic. After a day of airline cancellations and delays it was so nice to relax in the hot tub. We even made friends with another couple who was going on the same cruise. I would recommend staying at this hotel. It was wonderful experience. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. We will absolutely stay here again if we travel to San Diego.

<Title>“Overpriced Airport Hotel”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Sheraton at the Marina (in the Marina tower) for a conference, and even if I had another conference at this hotel I would never stay here again. I paid almost $300/night to stay here and it is only worth $90. This hotel is directly across from the airport, meaning that you are kept up all night and early morning by the booming of planes taking off and landing. I reserved a high rise water view with a king bed. While I did receive a high level room with a view of the water, the water was across 2 parking lots and a street, and again right next to the airport. Not a relaxing view. On top of that I got 2 small double beds instead of a king that would in no way fit 2 adults. When I asked at check-in I was told that even though I had reserved my room 3 months before, they overbooked and were out of the rooms I had reserved. They did not offer many any compensation. There is no wireless in the rooms, and if you would like to use the plug in it is $13 day. Since it is across from the airport it is also near absolutely nothing, so unless you want to eat overpriced mediocre food at the hotel restaurant you will need to pay an expensive roundtrip cab to for all your meals or activities. I also tried asking the concierge about getting to downtown and what to do and was met with a snide comment about taxis being outside. The positives were that the rooms were kept clean, the bed was comfortable (if only one person slept in each bed), they had a good hair dryer, and their was a complimentary van to the airport (although not to downtown which would have been highly desirable). Overall I would NEVER stay at this hotel again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It is highly overpriced and marketed as a resort hotel on the water when it is really an airport hotel surrounded by streets and parking lots with a nearby boat marina and Naval facility.

<Title>“Great Hotel - wonderful view!”
<Content>This was a wonderful hotel. Very clean, very comfortable beds, nice staff. Had a great nights sleep each night. We checked in and the package we bought included a free upgrade and free breakfast. The front desk person was nice and very accomodating. We got 7th floor, king bed with a view of the bay/pool. Very nice! You can hear the airport a bit, esp. early in the morning. If you are a light sleeper, you may mind this. We got our breakfast vouchers with no problem. The breakfast buffet they had was great quality and Luis took wonderful care of us. Absolutely no problems at all. Location was good for us. We had a rental car and I think that is a good suggestion for this location. I do agree with most - the parking is crazy....$22 per night. I think if you are a guest there, they should cut you a bit of a better deal. We justified it with the free Breakfast. Pool was good. We layed by it for a few hours one day, but was too cold for us to enjoy it much. There were kids enjoying it, though!! Overall, we had a great experience!!

<Content>I am coming to the Sheraton April 12th on a business trip with my husband (HIS trip) I am just coming to get away and enjoy this beautiful hotel. Swimming, running trails, spa, workout room and restaurant. I noticed our reservation said two double beds :( That is NOT good for time away with my sweetheart without kids. I called reservations and they cannot switch me. They are all booked up. I LOVE and use Trip Advisor ALL the time and hope management will see this and possibly help this desperate wife out. We will enjoy our stay either way but was hoping to make in more memorable!

<Title>“Nice stay in San Diego”
<Content>My husband and I made our first trip to San Diego this past weekend to visit our son who is in the Navy. We made our reservation through Expedia and I have to admit I was a little skeptical because I had never reserved a hotel that way but I must say that we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is at a great location, beautiful views and friendly staff. Our room was very comfortable. I read a couple of reviews last week that said the close proximity to the airport was a problem because of noise but my husband and I did not experience any noise problems at all. We had a marina king room and loved the view. Overall, it was a great experience and we would definitely stay at this hotel again.

Right next to the airport, down the hill from the Zoo, a nice walk to the ships/museums, right next to entrance to I-5, and what a view of the boats. My kids loved this place and the wife loved having coffee and cocktails on the balcony.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel, location & rooms, but don't open the mini bar!”
<Content>We booked the Marina Tower because Trip Advisor rewiews advised against the Bay Tower and we couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel room, the beautiful property and the views! One negative I'll mention is that our stay was pre-paid as part of an Expedia package, and for the very first time in my life I didn't ask for a copy of the folio when we checked out. I'd taken a $10 container of nuts from the mini bar but was in the room when the lady came to check the mini bar, so felt it was understood what I had used. Usually they record what you've used and give you a receipt but she didn't. Well, you can imagine my surprise when my credit card was billed over $64! Accounting told me that the items in the mini bar are sensored, so if you remove an item (to read the label in my case) you will automatically be charged for it. Apparently the 'sensors' are to stupid to know when you've replaced the item back in its place. Anyway as a 'courtesy' I was credited back for the other 3 items I had been charged for - wow thanks guys. The nuts ended up costing $13 because they also add tax and a 'service charge' so be sure to add 30% to the listed price. Okay - lesson learned - it's great place to stay but don't open the mini bar!

<Title>“Very Comfortable”
<Content>My husband and I stayed for (1) night before our cruise ship sailed. We checked in very easily and were given a Marina king room on the ninth floor. The view of the city skyline and marina were wonderful. The hotel, in itself, is nicely decorated and the rooms are nautically themed. It was nice to have a small balcony to sit and enjoy the views (and watch our cruise ship pull into the port terminal at 5:30 in the morning). Beds are very comfortable and the room was clean. Only complaint would be the slow service in the lounge restaurant and the distance to the Gaslamp district. LONG WALK!

<Title>“A drive to downtown....... but wonderful views”
<Content>Disappointed at first not to get bay views promised but reasonably easy change to bay tower building. After a false start with a marina view and faulty cold water tap, ended up in a comfortable room with stunning bay view of San Diego Downtown across the bay and particularly attractive at night . Noises of revellers nearby were audible in hall but not in room. $22 dollar charge for parking should be obvious when booking and certainly should be mentioned at check-in. Didn't happen with us. Probably not the hotel for you if you want to experience Gaslamp nightlife. We were told it's difficult to get cabs back at night. There are however 2 restaurants at Spanish landing, 15 minutes walk away and the hotel is well placed for exploring the area in general.

<Content>I stayed in the Marina Tower for 5 nights for a conference. The location is directly across the street from the San Diego Airport. The rooms are well appointed and cozy. My room had a small balcony which was nice to let fresh air in. Some nights I could hear planes fly by, but not more than a couple times. The bathroom was clean and the huge showerhead was like rainfall. Starbucks coffees and teas in room. The grounds are well kept, it was nice to walk around the Marina when the sun was out. I ate at the Harbor's Edge Restaurant as part of the conference. The breakfast buffet was great - eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, FRESH fruit and more. Had lunch there a couple of times, too. The burger was alright, nothing special. They give you your condiments in individual jars, which was sanitary, but I felt like I wasted a lot of it. The biggest con about the hotel is how nothing is included. Self-parking and internet add a significant amount to the price of the hotel.

<Title>“Wow! What a week!”
<Content>I have read some of the reviews below and was flabergasted to read that their visits were less than expected. I found just the opposite to be true. I believe that the service was one of the best that I have ever experienced. Everyone that I spoke to were in the business of sales which is why I was there. The smiles from the front desk down to housekeeping were a refreshing sight day to day. I was there for 6 days and never found it to be anything but this. After returning to my home I realized that I had left articles of clothing in the dresser. I immediately called and was treated pleasantly and very attentively by Sue Seirres. She was going to follow up and check the room herself but in the mean time she would transfer me to Security. At this time I met Nicolas Osorio. What a kind and very friendly voice. He as well was going to go check the room himself and would phone me back. He returned my call in less than 30 minutes and had located the items. He said that he would Fed-X them to me the next day (Saturday the 5th) But then he realized that FedX does not ship on the weekends, he called me back immediately and said they wouldn't go out until Monday. How nice was that?? I received the items this week along with a letter NOT a note from Nicolas. He wanted me to let the hotel know that the box arrived safely more specifically my 'lovely purple sweater'. he knew that this was the item I relished the most. He felt his kindness in his words of the letter. A special thanks to Nicolas and the rest of the Sheraton employees. Oh, and by the way Sue did follow up and called me shortly after Nicolas did. I travel a lot with my company and I do believe that this was the best accommodations that we have had in many years. (including DisneyWorld). Thanks Shearton for treating your guests like family.

<Title>“Very nice hotel on the Bay”
<Content>We enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton. It has a nice ambiance with the sailboat theme in the Bay Tower. It was great to have a view of the bay and a nice balcony to enjoy it on if we wanted to. We didn't notice any airport noise. The room was also set up in a unique way compared to other hotels with the bed angled outward/diagonal which gave it a more homey feel than a hotel - random thing, but both my husband and I noticed and commented on it. The parking is easy, but a little pricey for being an outdoor lot. It was really a quiet, homey hotel and I would stay there again. You do have to drive to get to the heart of downtown, but being on the water still makes it a good location.

<Title>“Noisy , nice hotel”
<Content>You would think with the airport nearby that the sound of the planes would be an issue. I wasn't . What was annoying was the noise coming from the other rooms. I could hear people using the bathrooms, flushing toilets, taking showers, and opening and closing the sliding doors, and talking. This was surprising for me. Usually, such 1st rate hotels are constructed better than this. The hotel is spotless, the staff pleasant and helpful. I did not like the idea of paying for internet access in the room. I do not feel like lugging my equipment down stairs when I want to check email. To do any kind of work, I would have had to camp out in the Lobby all afternoon. And lets not forget the parking fee. $22. So lets see, No Free Parking, NO Free Internet Access in your room, and if you are in the smaller hotel, only a cafe/bar to dine in. Will I stay here again....probably not. Would I recommend, again, probably no.

<Content>This Sheraton is located on Harbor Island along with a smallish Hilton. There are marvelous walks (jogs) to be had along the yacht harbor waterfront. Views of Pt Loma and down to the Coronado bridge are spectacular.

<Title>“Bay Tower was Very Nice”
<Content>Customer service was friendly and very good in the Bay Tower. The rep greeted us warmly and upon hearing our stay was a part of our anniversary trip, she congratulated us and proactively provided us with complimentary breakfast vouchers (which included a nice buffet of eggs, meats, breads, fruits, steel cut oats, yogurts, cereals, coffee, etc.). Her generosity was not solicited or expected but was a real treat! The lobby was clean, bright, and candles were lit in the evenings. To us, these efforts indicate that the focus is on making a customer’s stay as enjoyable as possible – something we appreciated. The spacious room was nice and clean and decorated with a nautical theme that included vibrant reds and blues. We were allocated a room on the marina side and the views were quite serene and pleasant especially in the morning – the Coronado bridge, ships, and bay were nice to view . A few things to note: internet in the rooms is not included and neither is self – parking for $22. Parking we can somewhat understand as that is typically part of a nicer hotel stay but we feel the rate is rather elevated. The internet fee, however, is in our opinion outdated and unnecessary. We would venture to guess that a charge for the net may result in loss of business. Also, the refrigerator in the room is for their food and drinks only. Do not remove any of it to store your items as some sensor will automatically charge the removed items to your bill. Just some info… Overall, we would recommend this Sheraton because of the friendliness and customer service, clean and spacious room, and nice views. We would stay there again.

<Title>“ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! Talk about hidden fees and bad service!”
<Content>My husband and I decided to do a quick weekend vacation to San Deigo. We used Priceline's "name your price option" and this was the hotel that was chosen and we paid through priceline.com. We went to check in and it was clear that the Front Desk could care less about her job and she handed us a key packet. We then soon find out that pricing is $22 dollars PER DAY for parking in their lot (and that is "self park"). Then, we realized that there are two 'towers' and the front desk associate never told us where we were suppose to park, which tower the room was in or how to get there. We finally found the room, got settled in, and pulled out the laptop to look up ideas for places to go, only to find out that it costs 12.95 PER DAY to use the internet in your room. Seriously, what hotel does not have complimentary internet?! Hole in the wall hotels even do!!! On the morning of check-out we got a bill under our door. The bill showed a $16 charge for "Other Hotel Charges". I called down to the desk and explained to the front desk lady that we paid for this room on Priceline so we should not have any charges on the room. She precedes to say that even though we paid for the room and tax through Priceline, we still had to pay some tax to them as well. I was a hotel manager so I know this was bull, but just to make sure that it wasn't some weird CA tax, I called the Holiday Inn down the street from the Sheraton and asked if there would be any additional tax charges if I booked my room online, which they obviously said NO. So, I went down to the desk and spoke to a different person and explained that we should not have any room/tax charges because we booked it through Priceline. She took the receipt, did some stuff on her computer, and handed us a new receipt with the charges taken off...without saying what those charges were actually for. The only think I could think of is that they try to stick you will just another hidden fee and try to pass it off as "tax". And, guess what? It doesn't end there..... We get home and look at our bank statement and it shows that 16 dollar fee CHARGED!! We were furious. We called the front desk and they transferred us to the accounting department. The accounting department said that they would send us a new receipt showing the "breakdown" of why we were charged, but that there were 3 people ahead of us so the email probably wouldn't go out until the next day! Are you kidding me?! Wow. We have a trip to San Deigo planned for March with family and friends and we will definitely be staying at the Holiday Inn.

<Title>“Acceptable when nothing else is available, but avoid the Bay Tower”
<Content>The Sheraton here is a standard run-of-the-mill chain hotel—decent, but nothing special. Not my kind of hotel, but acceptable when there's no better choice. I stayed here because everything else was booked because of 2 conventions in town. But my biggest beef is the deceitful "bait & switch" I was subjected to! After checking into the main lobby, I was told my room was in the Bay Tower just 5 minutes' walk away. There was a pretty map of the "property" showing the two towers and the surrounding pools, so I got the impression maybe it's just one of those large resort-like properties. Well, it turns out that this is literally down the road, several commercial property blocks away, in what is a second-rate motel that was probably a Ramada Inn-level place that they bought and are selling as part of the Sheraton. The gym and pool is a joke, the lobby is not a place you can comfortably hang out in, there is no coffee kiosk or Wireless Lounge like in the main building—but you pay the same price. The so-called view is over a parking lot towards the harbor—facing the naval base with turbine engines that go on till late at night. The one good thing if you have an early flight out is that it is literally next to the airport. If I had to stay here again, here's what I'd do next time: 1) Make sure my room is in the main "Marina Tower"—not the second-rate "Bay Tower." This matters to me because I like easy access to a coffeeshop downstairs, and a better gym and pool and hangout areas. Not that it's not a good place—but I'd rather stay at a Double Tree then, and pay accordingly and at least have warm cookie instead of those sensor refrigerators you're warned not to use or touch. 2) If I get stuck in the Bay Tower again, personally, I'd prefer the room to face the Marina instead of the harbor. Yes, the Marina side is the airport side, but I find the plane noise isn't as loud or aggravating as the non-stop turbines from the Naval base.

<Title>“A Very Nice Facilitiy”
<Content>My wife and I visited the hotel in January 2011 and we were very pleased. What a beautiful place for a weekend outing. We certainly enjoyed all the amenities. This place is well kept and the rooms are spacious and beautiful. All new carpet, furnishings, big flat screen TV and great restaurant inside the complex. The front desk personnel were most helpful and very professional. We felt very fortunate that we landed this place. It sets on beautiful Harbor Island and every room has a beautiful view. The room fee was reasonable,however I am never pleased when I have to pay for parking my vehicle at the facility that I am staying at. The parking fee is $22 per day. The pool area is lovely and well kept. Harbor Island is a great area to run, walk, ride bikes and a great view of the downtown area. Thanks for the fabulous weekend.!!!!

<Title>“Read "TERRIBLE" and "POOR" Tripod reviews BEFORE you book it!”
<Content>This hotel needs to get their Customer Service "wake up" call before they realize that they have certain memebers of staff giving a proper grief, attitude and generally speaking bad customer services to their paying and valuable guests. Sadly enough I know Sheraton for the better, but this stay was a major let down! Horrible experience! We made a mistake by booking this hotel based on the Excellent reviews and we never dreamed of that we would have to agree with lots of people who rated this particular hotel as Poor or even worse Terrible. Our check-in was awful, the receptionist wasn't interested in us at all, and although they have plenty of rooms available on both sides of the hotel (the main big building!) the receptionist didn't even bother to ask us which side we would like to have, ie. Marina view or the absolutely fantastic views of the city, which we didn't get. The Concierge staff were most of the time playing with their mobile phones while we were there, only when you let them know by calling them they would respond to you and then they will acknowledge you. The soap and shampoo were unreplenished and heavily underestimated, and we were left the dirty glasses in our room for days! We have to contact them several times for the soap and shampoo and it arrived there several hours later! When you go half way around to World on a holiday of a lifetime the last thing you need is to be annoyed and frustrated with the basic, small things issues and problems which shouldn't have happened in normal circumstances and with professional members of staff. Some of the staff appeared to us as either new and unsufficiently trained, or just not happy with their job or whatever else is in the background. The room service was slow, and once they appeared they were even slower as they had a new guy in the room service departpment who was to receive his training - in front of us in the evening! This was a horrible experience as we have just landed after a very long flight! Unfortunately the senior member of the room service failed to spot this and unfortunatelly we were left with no other option than to participate in that Circus de la Room Service! Once we finished our meal we called the room service to pick up their trolley, they just told us to drive the trolley out and leave it there, which stayed there for the whole night. They first picked up the trolley in the morning in front of our door. However, once they've picked up the trolley, another room service attendant hours later came to our door banging and asking us for the trolley from a previous night, to our great astonishment! We've told him that the trolley had been picked up by someone else. He was very grumpy in his search for that trolley and he didn't even apologise to us for the disturbance he made. He walked away muttering something to himself. Shocking experience! Chocolate from the mini-bar incident: Wow! This episode is a top notch of BAD Customer Services!! Honestly! WOW! On our 1st night we took a chocolate from our room's mini-bar, and to our great astonishment, the chocolate had expired MONTHS ago! Clearly we were not happy with it, and on our discovery some other products had been expired too! As the mini-bar in the rooms is touch-sensitive, we had try to communicate this to the room service and the front desk, but without any success! So, a trip to the reception in a middle of a night was needed to try and get another chocolate from either them or room service or something like that. The night receptionist failed to understand what the problem was, she wasn't interested in our problem what so ever!! We have explained to her that we don't want to be charged for it so if she can make sure of that, and if we can get someone to replenish other products from the mini-bar asap. Our request fall on death ears, the girl just didn't have a clue what I was on about, and she kept asking me to comeback tomorrow to the reception or to get hold of someone in the room service, but first the following day?!?! She had a proper attitude, so it was best to leave the argument there. Oh my God, the following day our HORRIBLE customer experience continiued!!! WOW!! Someone from the housekeeping came banging at our door, and we have asked her to comeback later as it was very early and it was a proper inconvenience. She spoke very limited English so clearly she did NOT understand what we were telling her. As soon as we realized that the lingustics are the issue we have tried to simplyfy our message to her. Then she walked away. Not even half an hour later she came around again, the same housekeeper, claiming that the room service send her. We didn't want her in the room at that time as we were still asleep but we felt that we didn't have a choice as she muttered something to us that she is busy! WOW! Like we care?? What a stressful event. And yet it did not end here. We have struggled to understand to communicate to her what the problem was about the mini-bar as it is was very obvious to us that the night receptionist did not tell her the whole story! Shocking. So, we have spent good 15 minutes explaining to this lady that we didn't touch or eat or drunk ANYTHING from the mini-bar, she claimed that we did as it was missing, and then we told her that she must seek that missing chocolate bar from the reception!! She was very suspicious, and she muttered something to herself, something which we didn't understand, in Spanish! She was visibly upset about the whole thing although we have tried to explain to her in a very plain language so she did understand what we were telling her. Then all of sudden she started to complain to us that she doesn't understand English very well, and that she will send someone else. We felt sorry for this woman in a way, but we were upset at the same time about how this could have happened, this great misscommunication between the departments. This housekeeper sent from the room service wanted to charge us for the expired chocolate from the mini-bar. No one ever came later on to replenish other expired products from the mini-bar and we have never ever touched that mini-bar again. We never received a call or any message of acknowledgment from anyone from anywhere from the hotel, so we were left in uncertainty about the whole mini-bar experience until we have received our final invoice where we have registered that they did not charge us for the mini-bar products. Awful experiences, constant frustrations, desperation, bad customer services and what else not!! Soon after this room service left our room we were to go to bed again, however that wasn't possible as another housekeeper kept knocking at our door to clean the room although we did have a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door!!!! She came around twice and she realized we were not up then she said she will come back later. She too muttered something to herself and appeared not to be happy because of our presence in the room. The same incident happened the following day too. Awful! On a check out from this hotel the lack of same interest for the paying and valuable guests like us was the same as we entered the hotel, awful, nothing, appaling! Even when we stayed at the 2 or 3 stars places the members of staff were very warm, hospitable, very friendly and kind to us. The room we had didn't have the city view and that was a major let down, although we must emphasize that the rooms are lovely (in the main building!). I can follow to some extent what other critics wrote about the design and furniture of this hotel, however, our main objective and at the same time a total FAILURE of those were lack of friendly and welcoming stuff, appaling customer services and never going and extra mile for a customer!! A major disappointment, frustration, desperation and what else not! We made a major mistake by booking this hotel! The room and the building is nice, they even have Starbucks there which I was quite pleased about it, the area, the lobby is okay and the views around the hotel are nice, but what's the point when you have your holiday and mood ruined by rude members of staff with a proper attitude and no clue what so ever??!! It is a real shame as our money will now go to someone else instead of Sheraton in San Diego! If they don't appreciate your business, well, there are plenty of other competitors who will do anything for you and your valuable revenue!! You don't travel half away around the World on a holiday of a lifetime to get crappy and appaling customer services and attitude, that's just plain WRONG!! :(( And if you're lucky you'll get one of those PR-letters from the Management saying how surprised and sorry they are about your experience and how they hotel pride itself to be the best and blah blah blah, and they will just wish you all the best! What a joke! We won't stay there ever again until the things change DRAMATICALLY for the better, obviously!! Sheraton other places maybe, but this one, no way! One girl from the Concierge and one guy from the Starbucks were the only people who smiled at us once and that's about all the smiley and happy faces in Sheraton we've got during our several days long stay there!

<Title>“Nice place, friendly staff”
<Content>I recently stayed here for five nights and overall, was very pleased with the hotel. Yes, the hotel is not in the downtown area. But, there are two buses that stop a five minute walk away that go directly to downtown. As well, there is a nice walking path (that is safe) that is about 4 km to the heart of the city. I only took one cab the entire visit. There are lovely running trails right out of the hotel.The gym was fantastic as well. The staff at the front desk were very helpful and polite. I also found the service in the bar area to be superb. Room service was expensive, but that is to be expected. The room was spacious and clean, although I could not be given a king bed because I had made the booking on priceline. I would advise anyone who is a light sleeper to choose to stay on the marina side. The side that overlooks the city is closest to the airport and was quite noisy on my first night. But, the front desk let me change rooms after the fist sleepless night. There were some cons to this place. The hotel is promoting this "green" concept that is supposed help the environment with reducing waste with washing of linens. If you sign up for this program, you get a five dollar voucher to use at the hotel in return for not getting your sheets and towels washed. I felt this program was pushed on me and I felt bad declining it. What they do not mention is that "going green" means that housekeeping doesn't even enter your room for your stay. My garbage was loading up and I put them outside of my room to get emptied, only for them to completely disappear. As well, there are complimentary teas in the room that would normally be topped up if housekeeping was in daily. Because they weren't, I had to get my own tea from Starbucks which was how I ended up spending my five dollar voucher. I'm all for going green, but I believe this is just a ploy for the hotel to save money on staff and cleaning rather than saving the environment. All I was left with was a dirty room with an unmade bed. I will not be doing this initiative in the future. I will just ask housekeeping not to change the sheets and keep my towels on the racks. My second complaint was when I switched rooms the first night because of the airplane noise, I ended up being in a room that had a door directly connecting my suite to another suite. I could hear practically every breath of the people next door, some of which was quite embarrassing. Make sure you request a room without a door connection in it. It is really kind of archaic and I did not feel safe as I was travelling alone and the door only had a cheap looking lock on it. All in all, I paid 75 dollars a night for the room. I got what I paid for. Nothing more, nothing less. I will say that the staff were great!

<Title>“Excellence base for a weekend getaway”
<Content>Great Hotel for the money! The front desk personnel is very helpful! Hats off to Melissa and Blanka at front desk for going the extra mile and making our weekend extra special. We stayed at the bay tower, the balconies and the rooms are a little bit bigger I noticed. Excellent view either side of hotel. Rooms need an update, but kept very clean, so you really don't care. Maryann B. in the spa is excellent! She really knows what she is doing! I did the Reflexology and she was the very best! We live in Vegas and go to all the strip hotels for spa services. She is really awesome! Service in the resturants is top notch. Very helpful, Rebecca at the breakfast buffet gave some really nice suggestions and directions! The breakfast buffet for the price should have made to order omelets and waffles. Miss that! Dined in the Harbor View for dinner, Service was excellent and prompt, but for the price and quality of food I would look into one of the more upscale Gaslamp district or some of the fresh fish resturants just down the street. The Hotel is situated on it own Island kinda (park like) Great neighborhood. Overall this hotel is great for a nice quite upscale getaway! I would recommed this hotel!

<Title>“Always a relaxing stay prior to a long business trip.”
<Content>I fly out of San Diego once a month for overseas business trips. These flights often encompass two days for me to get to my destination, and I've found that getting a room near the airport prior to a departure is the best way to rest up prior to one of these lengthy trips. After trying a few different downtown hotels in San Diego I've finally settled on the Sheraton Marina Hotel. Aside from the being the closest to the airport, it's also the most relaxing. I've never had a bad sleep there, and in fact I always leave for the airport very refreshed. I've come to feel so comfortable with the Sheraton Marina that I've even stayed there a couple times when it didn't involve business. It's become my hotel of choice whenever I'm in San Diego.

<Title>“The hotel & staff were great but...”
<Content>The hotel was very nice. The staff were friendly, especially the Shuttle Driver, Shane, he was very respectful and sweet. My only complaint was the location and the limited transportation options. The only options were cab or shuttle services. Car rental parking was excessive. No access to any of the public transportation services. No hotel shuttle services to local attractions. You can only use the shuttle service to go to/from the airport, it did not take you anywhere else. I have stayed in other hotels in San Diego that offers those services and close to public transportation.

<Title>“Not normal sheraton quality (bay tower)”
<Content>This tower is fairly average. The view and location, however, are outstanding! Restaurant is more like convenience cafe (very small and limited menu). Beds suck (guess they haven't upgraded to new cozy ones). Toilet paper and tissue are cheap and scratchy (details that add to feeling of "nice detail" or "am I in motel 6?"). Front desk staff was friendly but a bit too much to the point for my taste (I like the "is there anything else..." and other courtesies). Took 3 calls and 2 visits to front front desk (over 4 hour period) to get corkscrew and room service menu delivered (I called guest services made my request only to hear "allow me to transfer you to room service"...did this 3 times...never got connected. Just wonder why he didn't send it up..?) Room service and bar staff are super friendly and food was tasty.

<Title>“Excellent hotel, with a very courteous staff”
<Content>Excellent first rate hotel with a very courteous staff! we checked in for our anniversary in Octoberr and were told that the hotel was overbooked - and that they did not have a room in the bay tower that night - however they did find a last minute accommodation for the night and then upgraded us to the penthouse suite for the next 2 nights - it was excellent service all around after that. The front desk went out of their way to make this happen and they had no incentive to do it for us - they could have very well given us another room - I believe the person on the front desk that night was Eduardo (but I do not recollect his name). It was a 2000sq ft penthouse and the huge balcony has excellent views of the San Diego skyline. the marina is just steps away from the hotel and you can plan to watch a romantic sunset by the oceanside in rather silence. also, we were given free parking and breakfast vouchers for all 3 days of our stay - now that was surely a royal treatment. Thanks for making it a special vacation for us! We left a small bottle of champagne as a token of appreciation!

<Title>“Sheraton's name and motel 6 quality”
<Content>My family just stayed there for 2 nights and I would never come back to this hotel. My decision to stay in this hotel was base on the beautiful photos from their website but be carefully, there is a bait and switch, when we arrive the hotel, we were sent to another property called "bay tower". The stuff was nice and friendly and when I asked what's the difference between "bay tower" and main hotel. I was told "the room here is 35% larger than main hotel". After we got into the room, we turned on the heater and we all fall asleep until we waked by cold. The heater is not working. called the guest service more than 5 times and no one pick up the phone. I had to go to front desk and tell them that the heater is not working. Almost 1 hour later, a engineer came and fixed the heater. When I asked him to make sure the heater won't break again, he told me to call guest service again if it breaks again. Around 10:30pm, we found that there is no hot water in the bathroom. called guest service more than 5 times and finally somebody picked up the phone and told me that she will send a engineer to my room to check out. more than 30 minutes later, no one shows up and nobody picks up the phone call. Went down the front desk and was told "the boiler is broken and engineer is working on it. no ETA'. we waited another hour and went to bed without taking shower. On the second day, I requested to move to the main hotel. The lobby is beautifully and full of guests and activities. The restaurant is great and feels so warm. After we got back to our room around 8;30pm, we found that the heater is NOT working in our room. called front desk and was told a engineer is on the way. 45 minutes later, no one shows up and I went down to the front desk and was told there were 5 more calls in front of me and their engineer is working very hard to fix the issues and I have to wait. Another 30 minutes later, a guy came in and fix the heater. (not sure if he really fixed or not, before the fix, the temperature shows 65 and after the fix, the temperature shows 71 max. We set it to 74 but never exceed 71) I requested to talk to their manager but was told that the manager was too busy and I only can talk to him after middle night. I was offered one day free parking because of above horrible experience.

<Title>“Staff embodies San Diego's friendly vibe”
<Content>Checked in during holiday week to find (it seemed) 1/2 the population of Nebraska ensconced in the hotel before the Holiday Bowl. Posed no problem for the staff, who were uniformly friendly (unstuffy), upbeat and knew how to do their jobs. Received a great rate so immediately upgraded + $20 to try Club Level extra amenities - between that and all the folks running around in "Huskies" t-shirts - felt like we were on a cruise ship, very family-like feeling given it's a hotel (a place where a bunch of strangers stay together). Afraid this happy vibe might evaporate if Huskies loose ;-) Very comfy 12th floor room with balcony overlooking marina. Surprised at absolutely no airplane noise. We found everything we needed was readily at hand. Hotel has distinction of being turbo (or some new green technology) powered and liked the little touch of being able to skip room service and be green (on a day by day basis) in return for a $5 or 500 Starwood miles credit Best - very interesting location on busy harbor - nice if you like boats (of all shapes and sizes) and Navy helicopters. However, Harbor Island location is not central/downtown. And there are no public transportation options to nearby downtown. Also enjoyed staff's mix of professionalism and genuineness. Odd quirks: Trouble getting to Floor #1 due to obscure elevator bank for that purpose and no (little) signage. Floor #1 is for pool, gym, etc - its elevator bank is located far away from main bank of elevators but no signage at main elevator bank to this effect. Rode up + down main elevators for a while (where there is a floor #1 marked on the panel) but it would not stay lit . Needless crazy making when a few clearer signs would help. Though a nice idea in theory, hors d'oeurves offered in Club Level evening reception Tues-Thursday (gratis though bar charges for drinks) were marginal, a polite word for almost inedible. I have a caste iron stomach and they gave me indigestion! Hope the hotel will review the quality of the fare.

<Title>“We loved it!”
<Content>Beautiful property, very good maintained, we loved the maritime design of the rooms. Lovely little balcony with the marina view made our evenigs perfect. ( plus a bottle of califorian red wine ) :) Flat screen TVs, the best beds I have ever experienced on my US travels. Nice bathrooms too. The location is not quite central but I think there is a shuttle to the city ( we had our own car ) The hotel is perfectly clean. Minifridge, Coffe maker and great starbucks coffee instedd of the cheap coffee you alwas get in a hotel. Staff were nice. The property is located just next to the airport so if you are sensitive to airplane noise you better think twice about staying there. On the other hand, being an aircraft fan as I am, you will appreciate the close view to the starting and landing aircrafts from your balcony. There is no noise though if you keep the balcony doors closed. Bad things - 22 $ parking charge a night. No complimentary internet. Quite a distance to the city. However, we had a lovely 2 nights stay there and we will definitely stay there again while visiting San Diego next year. Highly reccomended!

<Title>“Wonderful hotel, albeit a bit isolated”
<Content>The Sheraton Marina was a fabulous hotel. Our room was huge, the decor and condition of the hotel was wonderful, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. We had one small complaint (our peek viewer in the door was reversed - you could not see out of the room, but those in the hall could peek in - the thing was installed in reverse!) but it was fixed in minutes. And close-by the Boathouse Restaurant, recommended by hotel staff, offered great food and very decent prices. Hotel car parking is very pricey, but we dumped the car and enjoyed the neighbourhood. That's the one thing you must remember. The Hotel is too far from downtown to walk reasonably, so a tixi ride is a must if you want to go there.....and you should. San Diego is a great city with lots to see and do.

<Title>“Great for families with Children - very pleasant stay”
<Content>We just got back from San Diego and stayed here for 3 nights. PROs 1. Very close to all major attractions (Zoo, SeaWorld, Gaslamp/Downtown) -- not close to Legoland 2. Very clean, excellent service at Check-In, Resteraunt, Housekeeping 3. Breakfast is pretty good with a nice buffet spread - very good service at the restaurant 4. Great location for evening - you can walk to most places in Downtown within 15 minutes 5. Rooms are all suites, which are roomy and let you wind down after a long day 6. Hotel is open to letting you use their fridge to store stuff (even though they have a minibar service) 7. Room includes a Microwave 8. Free 2x Waters per room per day 9. Very quiet rooms CONs 1. Parking is $23 a day, so park on the street if you can. Also parking is on the 11th Floor which means you have to drive up and down 4 floors each way. Parking is very tight spots. 2. Check-in on the 12th Floor and you use a different elevator to go up to your rooms, which means that you have to take a minimum of 2 elevators to get your room

<Title>“Very Disappointing, will never stay here again”
<Content>I stay at the hotel for 4 nights as I attended a conference that was hosted at the hotel. When we arrived in my room I found there was no Safe in the room, called reception and they sent security up to check but he also could not find the Safe, I then asked to be move to a room with a safe and they said it was not possible to do a room swap, yet 10 mins before when I check-in the person at reception gave me a few room that I could choose from. I found the hotel to be very average considering it should be a 4 star hotel. They don't even offer free in room internet, yet I stayed at a 3 Star Holiday Inn in New York and they offer it.The only good thing I found was the GYM. Now I needed my final invoice and I have been trying for more then a week to get it. I cannot believe this sort of service from a Sheraton hotel. Due to teh fact that I went on business I cannot claim the stay back from my company was I have not recieved my invoice yet. Unbelievable. Will never stay there again.

<Title>“Now that is Service!! Thank you Erin from the Front Desk”
<Content>Erin from the Front Desk/Guest Services is the bomb diggity! I called in to make a special request on Thanksgiving for a loved one that was spending the holiday far from home and by himself because he was working. I contacted the hotel in hopes of surprising him when he checked in at 10pm for a holiday treat. Erin made it happen! Not only did she find pumpkin pie and send it to his room and made an adorable card she made his holiday special and memorable! Now that is what I call service! I have worked for upscale hotels (different chain) for years and wish I had more employees like Erin and the crew she enlisted to make a special Thanksgiving for a loved one that was far from home. Thank you Erin!! Happy Holidays to you!!!

<Title>“Pretty good for what I paid”
<Content>My wife and I stayed in the Marina Tower on Saturday November 20th. We thought it might not be too busy on the weekend before Thanksgiving but it was quite full. We got this hotel for a priceline bid of $65 and given the choice between the second floor or paying $20 for the top floor we opted for the top floor. The view of the bay and city skyline from our room was incredible. There was a storm passing that night and we got great pictures of the city with the changing weather. Being close to the airport we could hear the jets taking off but we brought a fan with us for white noise and had no trouble sleeping. The room was average sized and the bed was a bit firm but not overly so. The bathroom was clean and the only thing missing was a vent fan. The balcony had 2 chairs and a small table. Although I hate to pay for parking, from previous stays around downtown San Diego the $22/day fee was par for the course. The parking lots are off to the side of the main enterance and can get congested at times. The overflow parking is not paved and was a bit muddy during the storm. Overall it was a good value for what we paid. We only left the hotel to attend a football game at Qualcomm Stadium and had no trouble getting to and from I-5. With this in mind not being close to restaurants, shops, etc. was not a big issue; but, would prefer to stay in downtown within walking distance of the Gas Lamp Quarter otherwise.

<Title>“Overall - a nice experience!”
<Content>We booked the hotel through Priceline and were a little nervous after reading these reviews, especially once we found out we would be staying at the dreaded Bay Tower. However, my wife and I had a wonderful time (even though it rained) and realize that some people will simply never be satisfied. Below is a breakdown of the pros and cons. Pros: •Beautiful lobby in Marina Tower •Excellent and helpful staff. Special Kudos to Scott and Bryan at Tapatini bar. We had a great conversation with them and they gave us some great advice on restaurant choices (don’t let this review add to your narcissism Scott  ) •Excellently maintained grounds. We didn’t mind the 5 minute walk from the bay to marina Towers and enjoyed “peeping” into the yachts in the harbor. •Fairly close to Gaslamp (but still need to drive or take a cab). •Comfortable bed! •Nice balcony – we were able to sit outside, watch the planes take off and land, and enjoy a bottle of wine. Cons: •Bathrooms in the Bay Tower are VERY small and have no exhaust fan. •Walls are thin and you can easily hear what is going on in hall and other rooms. •No free internet access in room…Really? It’s 2010. You can pay for access, so it’s available…but not free. How about joining the 21st Century Sheraton?? •The Harbor restaurant was WAY overpriced for the décor. Does anyone really want to pay $30+ for dinner and sit in a restaurant that looks like an outdated Long John Silver? Obviously not, I saw maybe 2 couples eating there the entire time. Overall, I would recommend the hotel although I would probably stay somewhere in Gaslamp for my next trip. Don’t buy the horrible reviews you see here – some people have impossible standards.

<Title>“Excellent Customer Relations Response”
<Content>We booked with Priceline and were concerned that in consequence we might get shunted out to the Bay Tower. I emailed customer relations in advance and requested a specific room type. Received a pleasing response stating that the hotel would be happy to provide me with the requested room. Allocated a delightful room in the main building with beautiful views across the Marina. The room looked as if it had recently been refurbished. It was modern, spacious and clean. Restaurant was expensive but the food was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina even though the weather was terrible!

<Title>“Bay Tower Customer Service”
<Content>I and my son stayed in the tower one night. Nove 29-30 part of a wedding party.( I have a receipt.) My Rep. was Kory. Her attitude and disposition was terrible. I was sent to room 388, I opened the door, a man jump from the bed. I went back to Kory and told her there was a man in our room. Her answer was, you are the only one booked in that room. I am telling her there's a man there and she's insisting no one should be there. Our room #194 had no exhaust in the btroom and there was mold at the top of the shower. At check out I bought the issue up and was told about security, computer mix-up and such. Too much information. She never apologized. It seem the problem was my fault. Will never stay there again.

<Title>“Don't let them put you in the Bay Tower!”
<Content>Booked this and was excited about the property... but got there and learned that there is a nice building and a junky building. What it looks like is that the Sheraton bought a competitor and then send their lower-paying guests to that building. Leaky faucet in the tub, antiquated tube-televisions, grubby elevators, and minimal services. If you are willing to get up and walk the to the other building, you can use their nice pool and their spa and their large gym and their pool table and their ping-pong tables and their fountains and their aquarium and their beautiful wood panelled lobby and their in-house Starbucks and their sculptures and their artworks ... but if not, you get the lame pool, no spa, a gym with old equipment, and a white no-frills utilitarian lobby.

<Title>“Not a good experience”
<Content>We stayed for one night at this hotel and that was enough. From the start of our arrival the parking was a nightmare. Checking in was a bit long but quick when we finally got up to the counter. Our first room was on the 4th floor on the end over looking the jacuzzi. The room was large but that is all the goods things I have to say about it. There was a huge red stain on the carpet when we walked in. The people in the room next to us were so loud we could just about hear their whole conversation. I called the front desk and requested to be moved. They told us the hotel was sold out. So I decided to take a towel from the bathroom to close the gap under the door that adjoined the rooms. There was a huge black hair on the towel so once again I called and requested to be moved. They told us to come back to the front desk and they would have another room for us. Our second room was on the 3rd floor and we had a lovely view of the parking lot. The room was much smaller than our first. We immediately noticed there was black hair all over the bathroom floor. We had problems with the shower working correctly and had more water coming out the faucet than we did the shower head. It took a good 10 minutes for the shower to drain before the next person could shower. We were unable to find the TV remote, after calling the front desk it took them 30 minutes to bring us a new one at 1:30AM. To top things off a car alarm starting going off at 5AM. Needless to say this was the worst hotel experience. I booked the room through priceline which was the first mistake. They were not helpful in resolving the issues after we returned home and said there was nothing they could do. I've emailed the hotel and no response. I was given the name and number for Riquel and have called and left her 3 messages with no response. There are plenty of other hotels close to the San Diego Airport and I would caution you to stay here.

My son loves planes so we could occassionally see planes flying by without the noise I would have thought there would be. They also had a great breakfast buffet and the kids ate free! Now that is a great deal! We loved playing at the pool. We had wished there would have been service still at the pool for drinks and food. Overall we loved our stay at the hotel. Fun memories with a hassle free stay.

<Title>“far from enchanting and a trap for folks without rental cars”
<Content>the hotel has two towers: the nice "marina" tower and the stepchild "bay" tower, a five minute walk between the two. the hotel is a cab ride from everything, poorly appointed and has minimal ammenities. twice, i've stayed here for a conference held in the marina tower. both times, I booked the conference tower and was - without any notice - moved to the bay tower. so I have to either hoof it to the marina tower or wait 15 minutes for a shuttle. not ideal and not what I reserved. customer service when I complained about the switch today I got a "we're sorry" and the manager tried to shift the blame to me for not booking with the conference block. no offer for free in-room internet or anything else. when I tried to order delivery for dinner, I found there was no directory of delivering restaurants and no phone book. I got a phone book and made some calls but no one delivered to this location. upon calling the front desk to request options, I was told to go online. (she assumed I was paying $12/day for in-room internet). when I explained I had no internet, she told me to come to the lobby and use their computer. really? ammenities 1 vending machine in the whole hotel, overpriced mini-bar or over-priced gift shop. you can't walk to anything so they have you at their mercy. "free wifi" in the lobby? yeah, but only an hour and you have to agree to pay for overtime when signing in. wifi in room? nope, but you can pay $12/day for wired service. bottom line if you've got a car, you might be fine here. if you're walking, you'll feel trapped and taken advantage of.

<Title>“excellent customer service”
<Content>I recently stayed at this hotel and have to say it was one of the nicest stays I've had in San Diego over my last 8 years of visiting there monthly on business. Ive stayed in a little nicer hotels but the customer service and staff far out weight the luxuries of a very select few I have visited. I cant say enough about the staff, managers, waiters, and bartenders at this hotel. Its hard to find a hotel staff who treat you like your on vacation as cater to your every need. Keep up the good work and ill be back soon and suggest you to all my traveling companions.

<Title>“Nice Stay... could be better”
<Content>My stay here was just fine. It was not great it was not horrible. I can say what I did not like most about this hotel was the fact that it does not have wireless in the room. What year is it? Seriously.... wireless should be standard in all business hotels. The room was fine... it was not bad, it was not amazing. The location, while has some great views... is so far away from the city. Its not within walking distance of anything... beyond the airport. The gym was really nice and the pool looked great. Would I stay here again... it all depends. If my event was at the hotel, I guess I would stay here again. Thus I say I would recommend this hotel. However, would I choose to stay here again, no.

<Title>“Two Hotels, One Name”
<Content>I was a bit confused when reading reviews for this hotel prior to my trip. My hope is to ease this confusion with my review and photos posted. The Sheraton is actually two hotels, one call Marina and one called Bay. They each have separate check in desks, separate parking lots and separate facilities. The hotels are connected by a sidewalk that takes an adult walking quickly 6-7 minutes from one location to the other. The Marina appears to be the newer of the two and offers upgraded facilities. The pool, whirlpool and fitness room are far superior to the Bay hotel. This hotel fronts a very upscale marina. pricing for items like food reflect this. Saturday brunch was $19 pp, more in line with upscale hotel pricing but delivering basic offerings. The airport is just across the street, convenient but also noisy from 6am-9pm. The Bay hotel offers larger rooms, but is a more sterile and noisy inside. Make sure to get a room viewing the bay not the airport. Stayed five nights and prefer the marina location. Self parking at $22 is another way to get more money from guests. It is not well guarded at the Bay hotel.

<Title>“Nice hotel with GREAT staff!”
<Content>We took our 3 yr old to San Diego the last week of June and stayed at this hotel. Hotel is adequately furnished. The hotel staff was excellent, always accommodating and helpful. We requested a refrigerator to store my son's milk, etc. It was promptly provided. A couple of months later the hotel charged my c/c for the fridge and removed it once I complained that a charge was never communicated to me. Very happy with their service.

<Title>“Steer clear of this Hotel”
<Content>If you want a hotel that will nickel and dime you to death than this place is for you. $18 a day for in room internet access is robbery, hell Motel 6 offers free in room internet. Sure you can use their "Internet Lounge" in the lobby for free if you don't mind the lack of privacy when trying to conduct sensitive business matters. No in room refrigerator, oh sure they could bring me one for $15 a day; wow the operating cost might be all of .50 cents a day, what a joke. Let’s talk mini bar, I know only the truly desperate use these things but $4 for 4oz bag of pretzels, $24 for mini bottle of wine, really? If you bring a car they will be charging you $28 a day to park it there, insane. My room did have a nice view if you don't mind the sliding door rattling from who knows what all night. I fixed that with the notepad from the desk stuffed in between the sliders, nice. You may be wondering if I notified the staff, well no they probably would have wanted $ to look at it and the note pad was the only free thing in the room. When I made my reservation I requested a king bed (traveling with my wife) but when we got to the room it had 2 twins. I called the front desk to ask for room with a king and was told they are all booked but should have something the next day and they would call me to get me into a different room, needless to say I never got a call oh well probably would have wanted more money for that as well. I had a standard room where I got a conference rate of $200 a night (regular rate of the street is around $250) There is absolutely no way I would pay that if I was making the trip on my own dime. One last thing, if don’t mind taking a cab everywhere you go or taking the hotel shuttle to the airport to catch a city bus than you would be happy with the location because there is absolutely nothing within walking distance of this place. You’ve been warned.

<Title>“Excellent location!!!!”
<Content>I booked my stay through Priceline and have to admit that I was somewhat hesitant after reading other reviews. However, I found my stay in the Bay Tower at the San Diego Sheraton to be extremely pleasant. All staff members were friendly and helpful. I had a room in the Bay Tower looking out to the bay. The view from my balcony was incredible and the room was nice and the bed extremely comfortable. Steve in the Bay Tower Lounge was great as was Lucia who I saw each morning in the Bay Tower restaurant while I was having breakfast. Both these employees are definitely an asset to Sheraton. I would definitely stay at this hotel again when I visit San Diego on my next trip.

<Title>“Great Hotel with a great view!”
<Content>I spent two nights at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina, recently during the American Society of Anesthesiology conference. I didn't get to spend too much time at the hotel or in the room due to my commitment with the annual conference, but I do have to say that I was very pleased with my stay. I liked my room very much. It was very nice and comfortable. My view of the San Diego harbor was superb. It made me miss living in California. Also, it was a very easy and convenient shuttle ride to and from the hotel. On my last night, before leaving back to Miami, I stopped at the Tapatini bar inside the hotel's lobby. I met a very friendly and personable bartender by the name of Scott. I got to talking with him for a while and I was very impressed by his recommendations of appetizers, tapas and specialty martini's they offered. I really had no idea that they offered such delicious drinks and food at this fun and reasonably lively bar. Overall, I had a very pleasant stay there in San Diego at the Sheraton Marina.

<Title>“Had to contact the front desk three times before we were moved to a decent room.”
<Content>We booked a room here for our anniversary. We got it through priceline, which we've used before with great results. We were very disappointed with our room. It smelled like smoke, there were cigarettes on the porch, one of the paintings had been ripped off of the wall, the sheets were stained and it looked like the room hadn't been cleaned in a long time. I called the front desk and explained the situation. I was told the hotel was at capacity and they didn't have another room we could stay in. My husband and I sat in the nasty room for a while debating whether or not to stay there. We decided that we would rather stay somewhere else. I called again and was transferred to a department that wasn't even open that day and got a recording stating that I should leave a message. I was really mad at that point and called on last time before going to the front desk in person. Finally this woman helped us and magically found a decent room (what happened to being at capacity?). This fiasco wasted almost two hours of our time. The hotel is really outdated, the fitness room isn't great and the "spa" is a joke. There are much better hotels in town for about the same price. I wouldn't stay at this Sheraton ever again.

<Title>“Very pleasant stay”
<Content>Stayed in the Marina Tower [more convenient, in my opinion, to the hotel's services, including its airport shuttle, than the Bay Tower] for 2 nights 10/15/10 and 10/16/10; beautiful views of Downtown from the small but adequate balcony. Room was clean and had all the amenities needed, but not luxurious. Common areas of the hotel are nicely decorated, and the staff at check-in was quite cheerful. One plus is the free airport shuttle, which one can use to connect with Metro bus 992 to get downtown. One note: since the hotel is isolated on a small spit of land [the marina], there are no restaurants within walking distance, which the Sheraton's restaurants capitalize on [high prices], so expect to pay $16 for a hamburger or $38 for an ala carte strip steak.

The front desk staff member surprised us by providing wine and dessert in our room to promote our anniversary stay. The hotel is located with 3 miles of the Gas Lamp area and near many wonderful restaurants.

<Title>“Great Hotel, Great Amenities, Great Location and the Best Customer Service Ever!”
<Content>From the moment I called for reservations, I felt like the staff were good friends . They strived to please us, and demonstrated above and beyond customer service. Our guest service agent, Roseann Schaefer, listened to my requests and needs for accomodations due to a recent illness and major surgery. She is awesome, and the best guest service agent we ever talked with ever! I will come back to this hotel just because of her! That's how great she was to us! She upgraded our room and had a fruit plate delivered to us upon check in! Every employee we encountered during our stay was so friendly and helpful. The concierge happily answered questions and offered to arrange for rental car, provide tickets to attractions at a discounted price. We have never encountered such excellent customer service at any other hotel ever, and we frequently travel! Way to go, Sheraton! The fitness center is a dream come true, with top notch new, smooth Life Fitness machines. This is our fav hotel in San Diego, and we will return again and again. Thank you, Sheraton, for a wonderful stay, beautiful views, comfy accomodations, super staff and great location! Don't miss the all the yacht lights reflecting on the water at night! Stunning view from the balcony at night in the Marina Tower. We're already planning another trip here! Hint--request the Marina Tower with views of the bay and marina. Views are great!

<Title>“One of the best hotels we ever stayed at with the best customer service.”
<Content>We were visiting our son in SanDiego and chose to stay at this hotel. The great service started with Lauren the consierge who helped us get the rental that we wanted. It seems that the rental agency we went with didn't have the car we reserved. Lauren was terrific in getting us a car. The second person that made our stay awesome was Julia at the front desk , our stay was actually in two parts and she booked the second part (with upgrade) for us. These two were the most helpful. We definately will be staying at this hotel again!!!

<Content>Our townhouse room over looking the ocean a big plus, well maintained and clean hotel. The Marina breeze is energizing and the view is beautiful as you enjoy a wonderfully tasty breakfast the Sheraton offers for $19 per person. It’s a great place to go for a central location near beaches, downtown nightlife and the airport for commuting. I love to go there very relaxing! It's incredible the unique variety in resturants to fit any size budget.

<Content>this is one of the best location & hotels in San Diego. there are a lot of nearby places to visit & good restaurants to try out. It has two towers, so it has 2 pools that can serve both sides of travelers in case it gets really packed in summer time. though the room services are below average where they don't answer your call or not bring items up to your room even you tried to called 3 times. other than that, it's a good one.

<Title>“Nice hotel but.......”
<Content>We spent two nights prior to boarding our cruise ship. We liked our room very much. The view of the harbor was great. We saw our cruise ship dock the day we boarded. The reason for our visit to San Diego was to visit the Zoo. We had been there years ago but couldn't wait to see it again. The zoo didn't disappoint. The only down side was the cab ride back to the hotel. Our driver took a number of back streets adding more than $7 to the fare compared to the cab ride to the zoo. When we arrived at the hotel I wrote down the drivers name and license number. At this point the driver became very apologetic and said we didn't need to pay for the ride. I paid him what we had paid for the morning cab ride minus the tip. I reported his name and number to the hotel. Bottom line, watch the cab drivers in San Diego.

<Title>“The best of the best!”
<Content>SERVICE, SERVICE, SERVICE!!! Did I mention the service? This was my first stay at the Sheraton, and it will not be my last. I simply will not stay anywhere else in San Diego. There was a problem with my reservation, and Brian at the front desk had it fixed within two minutes! The staff was amazingly attentive, yet not intrusive. I have found the balance between the two is a very thin line. The Sheraton staff walks it beautifully! If you have an opportunity to stay, I highly recommend the Bay tower with a bay view! My wife accompanied me on this trip and we thoroughly enjoyed having coffee on the balcony and watching the sailboats run in the bay. GORGEOUS!!! We have found that most hotels have hard bedding that makes for rough sleeping. Not the Sheraton. My wife and I found the bed to be surprisingly comfortable. The mattress was soft, with plenty of support. I can sum it up by stating: Stay here, you will not be disappointed!

I don't think there is a bad view from any room!! It was close to the Gas Lamp area, but definitely not walking distance, that is the only bummer... but a really quick drive, plus it is super close to the airport!

<Content>This is a good hotel with nice and updated rooms, great view and good swimming pool. There are 2 major problems with this hotel. There's nothing you can do walking, so if you plan to drink some wine and have dinner in town you would have to take a cab. The 2 nd problem if you're driving are parking fees 22 for self parking and 28 for vallet. If you think you did a good deal, wait for the bill after you check out.

<Title>“Was not as reserved, it was just, ok.”
<Content>We reserved our room at the Sheraton San Diego hotel, at the Marina address. This was the better of the two towers. When we gave the taxi driver the address and he took us to the Marina Tower, the bellman redireced us the the older, and being worked on tower. We found out later that there was a teachers convention in town and they had changed our reservation without our consent to the older tower. The old bait and switch routine. The pool was closed for renivation and the front of the Hotel was being painted and sand blasted. We thought we booked a 4 star hotel, I would rate the tower we stayed in a 2.5 star at best. We started to call price line and complain, but I don' t think this was Priceline's fault. We hold the Hotel responsible for changing our reservation to the lower price spread.

<Title>“Not a value for a money definitely”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel for about a week and I rate it as poor because of a service. I mean rooms are nice and clean, hotel has a pool and fitness center (I did not try those), but…I had number of issues with a service. Firstly you will be required to pay for every single service you get – no free Internet (it costs almost 20$ a day! Crazy), no free breakfast and even I had to pay for my package handling! For a hotel that costs 200$ a day that is NOT acceptable. Also during a check out I had some objections on invoice I got. I was told that they will sort it out and let me know on email. Guess what – they charged me anyway without giving any information! This is not a 5* hotel service. It is a money printing machine.

<Title>“The Service made this stay”
<Content>I stayed for a conference and over four days was treated professionally and warmly. Yes the bathrooms are small, and as the restuarants seemed to be served from a central kitchen, food was not as hot as it could be. BUT the staff is what makes this hotel worth it. And to those reading this, this is not just a "gushy, sentimental" review. I have worked hospitality and know what true value is. It's not always the size of the room but whether the staff is there for you when you need them. Thank you to: Anika @ check in who patiently helped me find a suitable room. Shane (shuttle driver) whose warmth has added to this hotel even in his first month there. Hayley and Brett whose kindess cannot be compared (you know what you did). Max (security) whose compassion and professionalism in a diffcult situation spoke volumes. and John (waiter at Harbour's Edge breakfast on the 21st) whose sunny disposition did alot to offset the cloudy weather. You all made my stay. Simone Brown (Toronto)

<Title>“Ignored!”
<Content>This hotel has ignored all of our attempts to contact them via telephone and email regarding the missing items from our room. The morning of our checkout I was packing the suitcases for our flight and noticed that our big shopping bag of clothes and souvenirs was missing. Nothing else was touched in the room and I quickly deduced that housekeeping could have picked it up thinking it was garbage. I immediately called the front desk in horror thinking it had gone to the dumpster and perhaps they could retrieve it before the inevitable. The front desk person was very defensive of the housekeeping staff and told me in a surly tone that this was a matter of security and that I shouldn't assume anything. Security came to the door and took all of our information citing they would begin an investigation and that they needed to review all the risk management strategies or something to that effect. I told them what I thought about it being a possible mistake by housekeeping given he fact that there was also packaging material from my now sobbing 8 year old son's souvenirs in the bag as well. I asked them to please go and check the garbage, but the gentleman just pursed his lips and gave me a blank expression that I could only deduce was that it "ain't gonna happen." They left the room and promised to call us and give us an update on the following Monday. After my phone calls (that magically go to voicemail) and email, it has been a month and there has been absolutely no response or contact. I am extremely disappointed with this lack of response. Shame on you Sheraton for such poor service (no service) after an emotionally upsetting violation of trust and promises. drsean Victoria BC

<Title>“Okay but could be better”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton for a conference. The hotel lobby is lovely and the view of the marina is very nice. For the most part the food at the hotel was good and there is a Starbucks right in the lobby. The service was good. However, the room and the bathroom are tiny. Upon arrival I noticed that the towels in my room were dirty so I asked for a new set. The new set had old stained spots on 2 out of the 4 towels brought. The faucet in the bathroom had some sort of a problem because there was only hot water or cold water but you could not adjust for warm. The hotel is far away from pretty much everything. We walked around for about a mile and couldn't find even a convenience store. The hotel parking price is obscene ($22 per night) and parking is not easy to find in the lot.

<Title>“Pleasant hotel, good facilities but a bit of a hike from downtown...”
<Content>Some great aspects of this hotel, free computer and print facilities in the lobby, on site starbucks and a relaxed friendly atmoshere. As you would expect everything was nice and clean. As some of the other reviews say, this hotel is a bit out of town, we walked it a few times and it took approx 45 minutes to walk. Typically, we walked out for dinner downtown and got a taxi back to the hotel (approx $15). If there was a regular bus service available, i would have marked the hotel as a 4, as the location does limit your options. This would be fine if staying for a couple of days or only for a conference, but on holiday you want to get out and about as much as possible!

<Title>“I Never write reviews but I just have to say something”
<Content>I travel weekly for business and needless to say have been in hundreds of hotels but the sheraton on harbor island has some serious problems.... The gift shop is vertually never open, always a sign saying they will be back The lobby bar in the west tower has limited operating hours. Also it has 2 large screen tvs but durring my last three visits over the last 3 weeks it hasent had service. What is wrong with this place that they cant get there tvs up and runing to watch a ball game. The sugested 5 minute walk to the other tower to watch tv and have a beer is the last thing I want to do after traveling all day. The check in process is painful. waiting endlessly only to get a trainee...every time. Must not have good employee retention if they have such a steady flow of new desk agents. Finnaly...the shuttle! No where near as frequent as stated, I may just be really unlucky everytime I try to catch a shuttle but never less that 30 min from my experience. There are plenty of great hotels in sd, this isnt one of them. Ive had it and will have my secratary book rooms elsewhere .

<Title>“Pleasantly surprised”
<Content>We booked the Sheraton through Hotwire. After discovering our mystery hotel, we looked up the reviews on Trip Advisor, and had some concerns... However, I have to say we enjoyed our 3 night stay. + Our requested crib was delivered to our room before we arrived at the room. Granted, we checked in @ the Marina Tower and had to drive over... + Our toddler was able to watch airplanes and the SeaWorld fireworks show from her crib. This was definitely a unique experience. Our room faced north in the Bay Tower. The windows are floor to ceiling. + The pool has towels - it's in a big wooden box. + Close to the attractions we visited (SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo, Coronado) but you do need a car. It's next to the airport, and I didn't see any restaurants you can leisurely walk to. +/- In room internet is rather expensive, but there is free Wifi in the lobby. Also a big plus is that there is a guest PC for use in the lobby with a printer. - The check-in process was confusing... We parked and checked in @ the Mission Tower, which is the first Sheraton you see from the airport. We were re-directed to to the Bay Tower... had to repark. - Parking is expensive ($22/night)

<Title>“Awesome trip”
<Content>I stayed there on a business trip for the week of 8/23/10 for 4 nights and I just wanna say thank you so much Warren for your warm hospitality and personal touch by having David taking me to the train station on my way out. Great location by the harbor was very relaxing, staff was just absolutely on top of everything, and awesome food was served in our daily meetings. Please say thanks to the kitchen and banquet staff and keep up the good work. Thanks again and that’s my new destination to stay in San Diego from now on.

<Title>“The service was 4 star and the view from our Marina Tower terrace was beautiful”
<Content>My husband,myself and fifteen year old son spent 3 nights and had a great stay. All the staff were very friendly and accomodating. The valet staff always gave us perfect directions, the desk staff and the restaurant/bar staff were also very attentive.The hotel is very clean and has just had a renovation. Rooms are very clean and housekeeping service was very conscientious.The pool is very relaxing and has a bar/resaturant outside. There was a good mix of family and business clientele. We stayed at Marina Tower because it was closer to restaurants/pool. The Bay tower has larger rooms but is a 5 min walk along the harbor and is quieter.The entire hotel has a resort feeling to it and is a very relaxing atmosphere. There are a lot of paths to take scenic walks/jogs around the Marina and Harboutr Island.Even though hotel is 5 min from airport we were never bothered by planes overhead. The hotel is a 10-15 min drive to Gaslight/Balboa Park and Zoo area. We were very happy that we stayed on Harbour Island instead of downtown San Diego hotel as we really felt like we were at a resort ans could still get into town easily. This is one of th the best values I have ever had at a hotel and would highly recommend it.

<Title>“Terrible location”
<Content>Went for a conference which was fine, but as far as doing anything else.... stay elsewhere. It's a taxi ride or bus ride to go anywhere interesting. There's nothing to eat there but barely adequate food from overpriced restaurants with surly staff. We took the hotel shuttle and 2 busses to get downtown and then took the train to get to old town... it just takes too long to get anywhere if you don't have your own vehicle. The hotel gets a "C+", the restaurants and location get an "F"

<Title>“Very very nice”
<Content>Stayed five nights and thought this was a great place (Bayside); enjoying the views of the water and airport. Very convenient to airport and only 10 minutes via cab to the downtown area (although we had a car and also traveled to other locations, with easy access to the freeway). The business center was good and internet generally reliable. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. As for the business meeting, the staff and service was outstanding (easy to eat too much because of the great quality and variety of choices).

<Title>“Wonderful!”
<Content>I spent two nights at the Bay Tower (purcheased through Priceline), Aug.20-22, and was pleasantly surprised! First, I must comment on the level of service all around. From front dest and room service to shuttle and valet, the Sheraton staff was wonderful! Kudos to everyone working Bay Tower that weekend! The hotel is conveniently located near the airport, and pretty close to downtown (about a $12.00 cab fare), yet the setting by the marina and bay give one the feeling of being in a private oasis. I had a sixth floor room with a view of the harbor (and airport) and despite the fact I could see planes taking off, it felt very peaceful. Saturday night I was even able to watch the fireworks at Seaworld from my (nice sized) balcony! The room itself was spacious, comfortable and very clean. The only negative remark I could make is that the size of the bathroom was a little small, not that of a four star hotel. Both mornings I used room service for breakfast and the meals were great, delivered timely and fresh. Coffee in the room is Starbucks and delicous and super easy to make. Directly across the street from the hotel is a walking path along the bay. It's lovely and is a great place to unwind and watch the boats and take in a terrific view of the San Diego skyline. I also walked over to the Marina building checked out the lobby, pool, grabbed an ice tea at the Starbucks and sat on a veranda there for a bit - very pleasant! I would absolutely stay at this property again and hope to return soon!

<Title>“Good location, pricey parking, nice hotel bar, good pool, decent service.”
<Content>Reading the reviews here before going scared me a lot since we had booked a room for four days using priceline. The pickup from the airport was smooth and sure enough we were put in the bay tower which I had heard was worse than the marina tower. We had several air crew in the shuttle with us and they were directed to the marina tower so we felt a natural discrimination towards us the priceline customers. oh well. The bay tower was not bad surprisingly enough. It was a very pleasant less than 5 minute walk from the marina to the bay tower and our room was on the 10th floor with a nice view of the marina. Seriously, sitting outside on the balcony in the morning and drinking my coffee was a nice start to the day. We did not interact with the staff much other than to call them to get the times of the shuttle which they were always happy to give. This brings me to the transportation part of the review. Parking fees were 22 bucks a day! But this is easily discernible well in advance and anyone with a modicum of sense would do their research before going. We did a decent workaround - rented from hertz every day in the morning and returned in the evening. It cost us $10 more every day because of the $10 fee per rental but you are saving about $12 a day for the parking so in total a win. The shuttles from the hotel drop you to the airport and then you can take the car shuttle from there to the car lot. Summary: great location (everything in san diego we saw was close by), good transportation to the hotel, worth the money from priceline bid.

<Title>“Good Hotel but Hallways Stink”
<Content>The arrival experience was great and the parking guys did an awesome job (even during night and day). We were coming there to spend the weekend with the kids and go to Seaworld. The Hotel looks nice, has a business feel to it. Room service was good - the server again was very nice. It is apparent that these guys spend a lot of time on training on customer service as you can feel it all around the Hotel. My only issue was the smell in the hallway. We were in Room 1163, the hallway smelled like someone crapped on it. It may the old carpet and someone steaming it, but other than this minor item the stay was very pleasant and enjoyable.

<Title>“Amazing bay and marina views!”
<Content>We arrived at San Diego airport at 22:30 and I was concerned that checking-in at this time would be a problem, but it turned out to be a breeze at Sheraton. The hotel is a 5 minute taxi drive from the airport - perfect if you have an early flight to catch. My partner and I were greeted by very friendly staff who upgraded our room upon check-in. Our room was in the Bay Tower, which is only a scenic few minutes walk along the marina from the hotel's main building, the Marina Tower. We were on the eighth floor and had the most beautiful view of the bay. I'd consider going back for the view alone! We stayed for four nights. Unfortunately breakfast was not included in our rate and the room service menu in our room didn't exactly offer the most tempting prices, so we didn't experience any of the food on offer. We did however make the most of the Starbucks located in the Marina Tower - a great way to start the day. The main purpose of our trip was San Diego Comic Con. Regular free shuttle buses operated throughout the event, stopping outside both towers and taking us right up to the Convention Center. This hotel is perfect for anyone going to the convention who doesn't want to pay the high rates of the Gaslamp hotels, but also doesn't want getting there to be a hassle.

<Title>“Good Location, Bad Parking”
<Content>Got a great deal on this hotel $89/night after the hotel agreed to beat the price located on Orbitz.com. Hotel was conveniently located near San Diego airport and a quick drive to downtown, Point Loma and Old Town. Hotel located along harbor and there is a nice walking path which my toddler loved strolling on and looking at the boats. Room was cozy buy clean and had a nautical theme. Had a great computer center. I hate paying for parking and self parking at this hotel was more than $20/night. This was only palatable to me because I got a great rate for the room. Despite paying an arm and a leg for parking the self parking was not convenient. Returned late one night and the only available parking was quite a walk from the hotel entrance. Overall a good hotel except for the parking rates.

<Title>“Great Views of the Bay and the City”
<Content>At first I was disappointed to be so close to the airport and not within walking distance to downtown. However, it really is a lovely hotel (nautical theme throughout) and kind of away from the hustle and bustle. The views are incredible. A few restaurants are within walking distance which is convenient as well. This would get an even higher rating if they provided a shuttle to downtown!!

<Title>“Great place!”
<Content>Had an awesome overnight stay! The rooms are spacious, staff is rushed but friendly and accommodating. I think most rooms have BEAUTFUL views of the marina plus balconies. Although it is near the airport, it does not feel that way at all. Location: Close to airport but only a 5 minute drive to downtown, not bad at all. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when traveling back to San Diego. The executive management staff is SUPERB and very customer service oriented. Club rooms are special as they have additional amenities, however, the evening service is not around on Fridays...only for breakfast, which I found slightly odd. All in all, a very pleasant experience and worth getting a rez here!!

<Title>“It is ok, don't stay in the back hotel”
<Content>This hotel is right near the airport but planes are not bothersome. There are two hotels, the bay and the marina. We were stuck in the back hotel. You have to walk 5 minutes outside to get to the other hotel. Fine in the daytime, not well lighted at night. I would not want to be a female walking alone here at night. The front hotel seems to have all of the staff. I saw two people working at the front desk at the back hotel in the two nights we were there. Not one other employee anywhere. Parking is a challenge. Not much of it, spaces are very small. Balconies are nice - we had someone empty what we think was a cooler over there balcony onto ours. Everything was wet, out table/chairs, window, patio. Called to let security know - no one came up. Front Desk took some money off for the inconvience. We used the pool in the front hotel. No towels anywhere. Finally found some in the fitness area. The whole pool area had used towels everywhere.

<Title>“Bay Tower - NOT a 4 star hotel”
<Content>I booked the Sheraton Harbor Island through Priceline for under $80 per night. Having read all of the negative reviews on here beforehand, I was very disappointed to find out we were booked into the Bay Tower, but thought I would give it a fair chance. The Bay Tower is, at most, a 1/4 mile away from the Marina Tower. Bay Tower has its own separate lobby. For all intensive purposes, they are 2 completely separate hotels that simply share the Sheraton name. For Priceline to allow the Bay Tower to be booked as a 4-star hotel is disappointing and frustrating. I'm sure there are different qualifications for what makes 4-star vs 3-star vs 2-star, etc. But for me, a 4-star hotel should make you think things like, "This is nice", or "This goes above & beyond a normal hotel", or basically, "Wow, this is fancy!" Sheraton Harbor Island Bay Tower sadly did none of those things. The Marina Tower, from what I saw, appeared to be a nice, newer, sleek-looking closer-to-4-star hotel. It's a 5-10 minute walk from the Bay Tower. The Starbucks in the Marina Tower is quite nice, and therefore very busy. If you choose the hotel's Green Option (of declining daily maid service), you will get a $5 coupon under your door each night, which can be used at Starbucks. So that was nice since it pretty much paid for a drink each morning. The living space in the room was average. Since it's literally across the street from the Bay, it had a nice balcony that looked out onto the Bay. The Bay-View has ships & military boats go by, vs. the Marina-View, which just has boats parked there. However, if you pick the Bay-View, there always seemed to be a lot of loading/unloading/work going on in the mornings since the loading docks are on the first floor, directly under the balconies. This causes a lot of noise (ie, not very relaxing), especially if you're on the lower floors Bay-view side. The room's decor itself was ok, nothing fancy at all. The couch looked quite worn. The bed was firm, bordering on hard. Pillows were very thin, even when double folded. The clock radio was cheap, as in $10 Radio Shack cheap. No iPod or auxiliary connection that I would expect a 4-star hotel to have. The bathroom really showed the age of the room. The wallpaper was borderline gross in places and should really be replaced straight away. The shower was weak in terms of pressure - it could not shoot to the back wall. But it did stay hot for a long shower. The towels were your basic white hotel standard-issue ones; i.e., the ones that are barely long enough to wrap around my 36-inch waist. I have nicer towels than this at home! And only one towel hook/hanger in the bathroom. The TV was pathetic. A 4-star hotel should not have an old 27" old CRT TV. This was the TV my brother had in high-school in the mid-90's. Also, our TV had an annoying habit, when the balcony doors were open, of switching itself back to the Hotel Menu channel randomly every couple minutes. The problem went away when the balcony doors were shut. Very odd. There is a $22 per night parking charge to park in the lot in front of the hotel. I wasn't that upset about the fee since most hotels - and everywhere else - in San Diego charge you for parking if you're anywhere near the water. I think it's fair to say that you really need a car if you're going to stay here for any extended period of time. Taxi charges will add up quickly. Because for the most part, you're really in the middle of nowhere in terms of shopping/places to walk to. There is a Fresh & Easy about 5+ miles away in Point Loma, but alas, there is no refrigerator in the room. On to the positives - the view obviously is great on the Bay side. The gym area downstairs was free to use. Again, dated machines but free is nice and unheard of at most hotels. The employees were all very nice and helpful. There is free wi-fi in the lobby. There is also a "business center" with 3 computers and a printer that are free to use. The room itself though feels outdated and not very professional at all for a "business center", but again, at least it was free to use. All in all, the Sheraton Bay Tower felt like a hotel from the Hotel Circle that had simply been placed in Harbor Island. It felt much more like a 2- or 3-star hotel. Nothing left me saying "Wow this is fancy". Even having paid a discounted rate, I still felt disappointed about the hotel experience. I would not stay there again.

<Title>“Didn't sleep well here”
<Content>We checked in and were put in a back building which is 3 stories tall. Were told it was a King bed but it was two doubles. A brief delay and visit to the front desk got us on the top floor (3rd) and a King bed. The air conditioner is motel style (not central) and is a unit near the sliding door. It is loud. L-O-U-D. I couldn't sleep at all the first night. Also this place is across the street from the San Diego International Air Port. You can hear every departure (they start early and so will you!). We had a view of the Lanai pool--seemed to be the place to make out. Kids enjoyed the other Lagoon pool and hot tub. Ping Pong tables are situated in the "Game room" which has two ping pong tables and a non-functional coin-operated pool table. It is very hard to enjoy this specific area because it is situated near a HVAC intake port which sounds, oddly, like a jet engine. So, if you are hard of hearing, stay here, it is a reasonble place with nice people working here, good service in the main restaurant and I enjoyed the waffles while my kids had plenty of choices in the buffet. Cost $50 for breakfast. The food and parking in all these touristy places is way overpriced so be prepared and get over it. I was happy with the valet service--very quick. We got this place on a hotwire rate of $100 per night, but looking back would have paid extra to have a quieter place. Bring earplugs just in case.

<Title>“The Missing Teddy Bear Comes Home”
<Content>What a wonderful stay. I wish we could have had more time to enjoy the hotel. My family which consists of my husband, two teenagers and a 10 yr old had a blast during the week of Comic-Con. Check-in was speedy and seamless. Check-out was just as well handled. We had found a discrepency on the bill and the counter check-out staff fixed it right away. We were given a spacious room for the 5 of us but one of the teenagers had to sleep on the floor anyway. The cleaning staff was gracious enough to make sure he had clean linen every day and we had plenty of coffee and towels for all of us. The best thing of all was getting my youngest childs Teddy Bear Back. Apparently the bear had been covered up in the bedding and inadvertently left behind. We didn't notice until we were several hours away. My child was beside himself. He said with huge allegator tears running down his face, "Mommy I need Henry. He keeps the bads dreams away". As you can probably guess I felt his absolute vulnerability and terror at that moment in time. The realization that for the first time in 9 yrs he would not have Henry to fall asleep with. I called the hotel and the security staff put housekeeping on the alert right away. We didn't hear anything for a day. I called the next day. Still no Henry but assurances were given that people were looking for the bear and someone would call me as soon as it was found. Day 2 we get a call. Henry had been located. Housekeeping had washed the bear and was waiting for a trip home. The next day the manager FedEx'd the missing companion to Oregon. We received Henry 3 days later. Clean and well travelled, into the very happy waiting arms of his life long companion. My son learned a valuable lession during those "Henry-less" days. #1 He could sleep nightmare free without Henry. #2 Never forget to look in the blankets at a hotel before declaring "I'm all packed lets go" and #3 It was sure good to get Henry home. Thank you to the unnamed manager that sent our Henry-The Teddy Bear Home.

The location is very convenient to the airport and right on the water. We were able to rent a jetski right at the hotel. The view of downtown San Diego at night from our balcony was amazing. Great pool, tennis courts, fitness center, pool table, ping pong table-lots to do for kids and adults both! We will definately stay at this hotel again next time we are in San Diego!

<Title>“Hotel fine once there. Reservation process sucked”
<Content>We traveled to stay at this hotel as part of a baseball tournament where this hotel was one of the host hotels and we were required to stay there. Once there, the hotel was fairly decent except for the "car alarms" that go off on a nightly basis. Not sure why that is but, we suspect the proximity of the naval base? Nobody's gps's worked properly in the area either which we were certain were a result of the naval base. If staying here again, I would highly recommend the Marina Tower over the Bay Tower. Bay's nice but, Marina's where it's all happening. Restaurant prices were horrible forcing most to find food elsewhere........AND, the Bay tower could really use some laundry facilities.....especially if their going to be the host hotel for a baseball tourney. The worst part of the entire trip was the entire reservation process where the resey's were made back in March and apparently this hotel/chain is not set up for this type of venue as our resey's were a complete nightmare from the beginning. The hotel staff once we arrived was very accomodating to insure everything was in order and we got everything fixed. Kudo's to Blair & Brett for all of their help and excellent professionalism however, BP a supervisor back at the main office (you know who you are), NEVER fulfilled his promises nor even replied back to repeated emails asking for help. This after spending a fair amount of time on the phone with him to rectify everything. Give that guy a demerit...........The hotel itself is in a great location with a great view of the harbor. They should really step up to Queen beds (in lieu of doubles) cause you have the room to do so and doubles are rediculous for couples traveling with kids or players. We especially liked the overall locale of the hotel and it's proximity to many of the featured area's: Sea World, Zoo, Old Town, Little Italy, Coronado Island, etc....... And it's a HUGE SECRET that I'll share with you here.......Between the two towers and closest building to the Bay Tower, there's a MARINA DELI on the back side of the building that serves wonderful bfst & lunch for extremely reasonable prices. They also have quite a few ammenities should you need drinks, snacks, beer whateover. Too bad we did not find it till the last day we were there but, a fantastic breakfast was had by almost our entire team and priced as it should be. There's also laundry facilities there but, do not believe they are suppose to be available to anyone aside from the members of the marina........but, it's there and nobody is spose to talk about it. Just this little fact will enlighten your experience immensely while staying at this portion of the hotel. Would I stay there again? YES, with a much greater knowledge than the 1st time. Enjoy.........(would I try to get resey's every fixed again with BP...................NO!)

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>I was very disappointed by the poor service. It seemed like they did not have enough staff to start with check in. At times there were long lines and 3 people working. Check in seemed to take much longer then other hotels I have stayed at like Marriott. Now I realize my disappointed, use to staying those hotels, this was a differt culture. I did not feel like the staff really care about the happiness of the customer. I was use to being able to check in early with out a problem and not being charged $10.00 per hour for late check. Check in was 3pm. My room was not available until 4:30. I was offered accomdations for my bags until a room was ready, but felt like this was not something new.

<Title>“Nice But Pricey Resort”
<Content>I was in San Diego for the Comic-Con, and the Sheraton Marina was the only hotel left with rooms, so it wasn't my destination of choice to begin with. That said, it's a very pleasant resort hotel, with a wonderful view of the marina & a very nice swimming pool. I wish I had time to check out the amenities like the spa and the free bikes, but we were only there for 2 nights. Luckily, they are pet friendly, and our room's patio opened right out onto a green space, which was a plus. The real draw back was that everything else in the hotel was VERY expensive. A room service breakfast for 2 came in @ $60! And the service at the Harborview Restaurant was agonizingly sloooow, despite almost no one being seated for dining. And you're given a choice of either parking yourself for $25 @ day or valet for $28. Really? Oh, and they charge you $20 @ day (not 24 hours, mind you--a calendar day) for internet access.

<Title>“Hotel was near perfect for us”
<Content>Booked the hotel through Priceline for $104 and was then prepared to be very disappointed after reading all the negative reviews here. However, the hotel far exceeded expectations. Despite what another poster mentioned, I thought it was a perfect hotel for a family with young children. The location was quiet and serene, there were many amenities at the Marina Tower, they even had movie night at the pool one evening. The front desk associate was extremely helpful. She helped to get us into a double/double instead of the king we had been booked into and she even moved us from the Bay Tower to Marina and to the 12th floor! Thanks so much for your effort Samantha. The only complaints we had are 1.) Yes, the parking is extremely overpriced at $22. 2.) The large pool at the Marina Tower was closed an entire day for "Servicing". The smaller pool was open though. Seemed odd since I recall other reviews in previous months stating the same issue. I wonder if it's not really a servicing issue, but that they just don't want two pools open at the same time on a weekday since they would have to staff them both.

<Title>“This was the worst and most expensive hotel stay in memory.”
<Content>San Diego in July. Crowded, crowded, foggy and cold. We booked a room for our last night in town as we had a 6:30 a.m. flight. We asked for an early check-in. Got there at 12:15 and were not allowed in our room until 4:20 p.m. The front desk staff was rude. The room was incredibly expensive and our card was charged $50 more than we were quoted over the phone. All in all, our stay there cost $400 (after I complained and got the $50 taken off our bill) for 16 hours of time, only 12 hours of which were in the room. Oh yeah and they flunked wake up call too. Fortunately we woke ourselves up and made the plane. Total rip off!!!

<Title>“Very Nice, Clean, Bad Parking”
<Content>Got a special rate through USTSA. Marina Tower was very nice, clean. It smelled brand new. Rooms were very quiet; didn't hear noise from neighbors only airplanes as it is very near airport. Beds were very comfortable. Parking was very inconvenient at $22/day ($25 if you get valet). We had to park far away in a dirt lot. It is kind of out of the way from stores, and restaurants. It was excellent quality for the discounted $114/night we paid.

<Title>“Pleasantly surprised”
<Content>Got this through Priceline and was worried by the awful reviews, expecially of the Bay Tower. So when we arrived and were told to head to the Bay Tower, we asked to be moved to the Marina Tower. Although the hotel was fully booked for a convention, the front desk agent happily accomodated. The room had been recently renovated, new carpets, etc., with a very comfy bed. Best of all was the great view of San Diego from the balcony. Pool is nice but busy with kids, and pool service is reasonably priced. There are a number of computers on the main floor with free internet access. Starbucks opens early and the hotel restaurant had a great inexpensive buffet dinner. Concierge was hit and miss. Overall, we were very pleased with the hotel. We never did see the Bay Tower so cannot comment. Parking at $22 / day is outrageous for a hotel so far away from downtown. There is not much around but do but try the "Island Prime" restaurant just down the road. You will need reservations. We also tried the Boathouse..take a pass on that place. Best evening in San Diego was at Henry's Pub downtown. The band Flock of 80s was playing up a storm and the beers were flowing nicely. Just don't eat there.

<Title>“Great location for Seaworld and the Zoo”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights. Paid $74 a night plus taxes on priceline. Hotel is located on Harbour Island near to the airport. Didn't really notice the noise at all. There are two parts to this hotel, the Marina Tower and Bay Tower. Make sure you stay in the Marina Tower as this is main part of the hotel. We got an excellent view of the Marina. The hotel pool is really nice and there is also a nice walk along the Marina. Seaworld and the Zoo are within a 15 minute to the hotel. My only gripes would be the cost of parking which was 25 dollars and the long check in that we had. The room is really nice and modern, however the bathroom was really small. The hotel is not within walking distance of Downtown and you need a car to get around! Overall if you can get a good deal I would thoroughly recommend it.

<Title>“Good Solid Hotel. Spotless. Attentive even during a conference of 800!”
<Content>We experienced no difficulties or hassles when checking in. There was a conference during our entire stay which did not prove to be anything more than a delayed wait at the elevators in the early morning. Pool was clean and staff was very attentive- thanks Stephanie! Beds were comfortable and rooms were spotless (and I'm an Italian wife-clean freak type) . Been to San Diego three times and this hotel met all of our needs (Starbucks too!) Will return!

<Title>“Great Hotel - Comfiest beds ever”
<Content>trip advisor was such a great help to me that I just had to write a review. The beds are so soft that I wanted to take it home with me. Many people said that and they were right. The view from the Bay Tower is amazing but realize that the Marina Tower (which is short walk from the Bay Tower) has all the ammenities i.e. Restaurant (very over priced of course - Quinns - but they have great burgers), Starbucks, lagoon-like pool. For us it was perfect to go next door for all of that and tip toe back to our quiet lovely view. Staff was very nice and the rooms are big and very clean. Do yourself a solid and give it a try. P.S. We went for Comic Con and it was a very short shuttle trip - good stuff.

<Title>“At a discounted rate, good 3 star hotel”
<Content>Priceline categorizes this Sheraton as a 4*, but as we often find with Priceline, it's really a 3-star for older Bay Tower building. The hotel is split into 2 locations around the corner from each other surrounding the harbor marina. Separate parking, separate check-in. While the Bay Tower is older, it has been recently renovated. It is quite clean, bed comfortable, good sitting area and offers the usual amenities expected of a Sheraton. Each room has a balcony. The hotel is across the street from the airport, so expect air traffic noise, but the marina is quiet and provides a pleasant view. We could also see the SeaWorld fireworks in the evening from the marina side. Although the hotel was very, very crowded with weddings, families and other groups over a Sat. stay, the pool area was not very busy. The pool bar was not open, which was an inconvenience. Parking, self or valet, is an extra $22. per day. The location is on Harbor Island, 5 min. drive either way to downtown SanDiego or Point Loma. We were satisfied with the hotel as there were few choices in San Diego for that weekend and Priceline was a good value.

<Title>“Bay Tower - Staff could not care less...”
<Content>I reserved two rooms for a 3 night stay at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. Our party was relegated to the Bay Tower, which was an older building, sadly in need of a face-lift. Very disappointing in appearance, cleanliness and amenities. What was truly surprising was the "couldn't care less" attitude shown by the staff. We would have to call the front desk numerous times to get even the most basic things [eg. previous occupant had left the room safe locked]. The gift shop was open for only a few hours over the entirety of our stay, which was unfortunate given that the hotel is isolated from any stores. The business centre's printer didn't work, which staff knew about but didn't bother to post a sign, or even tell any of the guests who were attempting to use the equipment. I run a health care service organization and it is abundantly clear that there is a lack of oversight on the part of management. A very poor effort on the part of Sheraton.

<Title>“Customer service is fabulous.”
<Content>We got a really good deal during our stay so we didn't pay the usual crazy resort price (thank you Hotwire). I have my hang ups with the roads in San Diego so finding this place wasn't the easiest thing but upon arrival I felt comfortable. We stayed in the Bay Tower, which I admit must not be as great as the main hotel, but for the price we paid, we didn't mind. This hotel is not really in a good location. It's right across from the airport, noise wasn't a problem but still, really? It's also not close to any restaurants or shops. We had to drive out for dinner and San Diego road's are not my favorite. But service was fabulous. The staff is excellent, quick, and friendly. They give really good advice about the area and the hotel amenities.

<Title>“Tale of Two Hotels, One Reservation and a $400 per night bill for a run down property.”
<Content>As an SPG fan, this was disappointing. Firstly, they have two properties. One is a hotel, which they call the 'Marina Tower' with nice lobby, flat tvs and restaurant, etc and then they have another called 'Bay Tower' which is more like a run down apartment building/crackhouse/dorm that they like to shuttle you to and call it 'an upgrade' and that they 'have bigger rooms' and so on. Liars. It is horrible, run down, CRT TVs and cream whitewashed furniture. The other tower has Flat TVs, lovely showers and you are on the Marina, not overlooking the Airport, which is the Bay Tower view. Add this to the fact that it is $300+ per night, charge $25 per night for self parking your car, $13 per PC for internet per night and this is a $400+ per night stay and honestly, a joke. Even sitting in the restaurant for breakfast and all you see is stains on the windows that block your view of the harbor and make you ask yourself what else in this hotel isn't clean. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else when you are in San Diego. This hotel is overpriced (with internet and parking it was $400+ per on a weekend) for the quality and they bait and switch. None of which are qualities that I will patron and I will never, ever stay here again. This has tarnished my opinion of this brand. It should not be a Sheraton, but perhaps a Four Points.

<Title>“a vacation saved”
<Content>I am sending this email to recoginize one of your employees. This employee saved my family's summer vacation. Originally our plans were to stay at a La Quinta Inn in Oceanside and go to Legoland. Upon arriving in Oceanside, we realized our view was the rooftop to a Gentlemen's Club. On top of that we were misquoted on the ticket prices we were going to pick up at the front desk. This threw our plans off because we like many families are on a budget. We ended up changing our plans to come to the bay area. My in laws are live abords in Harbor Island. They offered us to stay there, but with a growing family, the space is a little tight. So we headed south to hotel circle. They were booked! The Ramada had a few rooms left but they were smoking rooms. My husband is a smoker so we thought we could handle it. We spent the day at the beach and went to the Ramanda room late evening. That was the most disgusting experience of my life. Not only was the stench overwhelming but we found rodent feces in the bedsheets. At this point we were totally exhaused and headed back to the boat to try and get some sleep. As were were pullling into the harbor we decided to check availability and pricing at your Sheraton. That is when Melissa Hernandez waited on me!! Not only did she find my family a room its was also affordable. Our vacation was saved. We were prepared to come home the next day. We had a great room, beautiful view, and great service. Employees like Melissa will keep your customers coming back. If there were any negatives, I would say parking charges are excessive, and the girl who checked us out was not too polite. Other than that, Melissa Hernandez was a Godsend to my family and we will return to the Sheraton! Sincerely Joanne Greco

<Title>“Disappointing at best.”
<Content>We arrived at the hotel our room wasn't ready and it was 2 hours past the projected check in time when we finally got to our room. The front desk staff had a line several deep and only one person at the desk. She was extremely pleasant and did her best to service everyone. The phones were ringing off the hook and she was trying to focus on each customer, management should really consider getting more help during peak times checking in and out. Our room was dissappointing at best, the view was great, we were on the harbor side, this however was the only highlight of our room. We went out to enjoy the balcony and had only one chair. We called twice before someone arrived with a chair, it was dirty and we had to clean it before we could use it. Our room had several non working outlets. Traveling with 2 other young woman all with cell phones, laptops and other electronics to charge, this was a huge problem in our room. I called twice before an Engineer came to our room, he said he had to get a tool, left and never returned. At that point we gave up. You have to question the decision not to offer wireless internet. For a hotel not to offer free Wi-Fi or at least offer it as an amenity for a fee is sad. This was a business trip and it made it very difficult to work as well as my 2 travel partners. The wire service was for one computer only and a huge inconvenience to be trapped at the desk. The beds were comfortable and very clean. The housekeeping staff on the 4th floor were very pleasant and worked hard to service the rooms. We love San Diego and will be back but not at this hotel.

The bed and pillows were unbelievably comfortable... so comfortable my boyfriend and I ordered room service so we can could stay in bed a little longer and eat out on the balcony. We were also surprised by a $50 credit to use for food or beverages. Absolutely No complaints about our trip.

<Content>The room was nice, the bed was comfortable and the view was beautiful. I was however, disappointed that there was no refridgerator in the room except the extremely expensive mini bar filled with candybars. I have a 2 year old and had to turn the mini bar around to keep him out of it. Also, I did not appreciate having to pay $22.00 a day for the priviledge of parking my vehicle there. I never saw anything in the advertising advising me of this fee when I was searching for a hotel in San Diego.

<Title>“Good experience....”
<Content>Upon checking in, I requested to have the two rooms we reserved side by side. The front desk was able to accommodate us and placed us in the Marina Tower. It was a 5 minute walk (or 1 minute drive) from the Bay Tower (the main tower) but we didn't mind since the walk was right next to the water and was very refreshing. Plus, I hear the rooms in the Marina Tower are bigger than those in the Bay Tower. The rooms were quiet, a good size, and beds were very comfortable, but the couches in both rooms need to be replaced or reupholstered because they were obviously worn out. The bathrooms need updating and a good cleaning! The views were beautiful, especially when sitting out on the balcony. Only 2 things to complain about...parking is expensive, $22/day and there was a $100 hold for each room placed on my card for 48hrs after checking out that I wasn't informed about when I checked in or checked out. All in all, needs some TLC but hotel staff was polite and enjoyed our stay.

<Content>I had a wonderful stay last week at your hotel. From the entrance with the sweeet aroma to the staff at the front desk to the housekeeper on the 6th floor. My stay was great. I would like to mention Keri & Brett at the desk, Victor and the Chef in the restuarant with the buffet style set up. I can not forget Estella B. and Natalie M., in the begining Ashley Eng helped with the arrangements long distance in planning, coordination and implementiing everything we could think we needed. The special touch was the fruit basket I received in my room from Natalie and Estella, that was the icing on the cake. The bedding was so very comfortable every night, I recommend that everyone mention receives a raise or day off for a job well done. Sincerely, Major Mary Brookins United States Air Force Nurse Corp

<Title>“Never again!!!”
<Content>I am so not happy with this hotel. The first time I stayed there it was perfect! The second it was awful! I stayed here for a wedding for two nights and might I mention I was the make-up artist for this wedding as well as the bride's brothers girlfriend. Everything was beyond screwd up. They put us all in the different towers and when I checked in I had them fix that and put us all in the same room. It also took 40 min to check in. And then they stuck me in a room with no A/C. Might I mention I live in San Diego and i was only staying here for the ease of getting the bridal party ready. So I was stuck sleeping in 80 degree heat! When I called they said in the morning they would fix the room since they were booked and could not switch me rooms. In the morning they came in and decided to start fixing it at 9am and when I told them at 10am I would have the bridal party coming in and needed the A/C fixed. They told me it would take longer and we would be without A/C. So finally they switched me rooms. And Frita the person in charge didn't even want to comp the night stay let alone give me a discount on the room. So finally they changed me rooms. I had to go down for the keys and I had to move my own luggage since the bell hop never made it up with my keys or to move my stuff. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone!!! Please dont stay here let alone block rooms for an event.

<Content>I often stay at Starwood properties and therefore selected this Sheraton based on trust and previous experience. I was however disappointed with the level of service as this particular property. Many times people would try to contact me at the hotel and no one would pick up at reception. In addition when I tried to contact someone at reception it took a few calls before anyone picked up as well.

<Content>We have stayed here with our dog 5 straight summers. The headline says it all. 113 in Scottsdale, 70 in SD. We love the Bay tower marina side views, sunrise and sunset off the corner of the room's balcony, just a little direct sunlight at each end of day on the balcony, but sunny view on marina and water all day, simply idyllic. Great, inexpensive restaurants nearby, like Point Loma Seafoods, Pomodoro. Great workout facility. We'll be coming back every summer.

<Title>“There are plenty of other hotels by the sea”
<Content>When I checked in, I was surprised to learn the hotel charges $22/night for parking. This charge was not clearly disclosed prior to check-in and comes across to me as tacky. On the third night of my stay, I came back to my room to find my keycard did not work. I headed down to the lobby and learned the hotel staff had mis-booked our stay and believed we had checked out that day. The staff member who assisted us seemed friendly enough, and assured us that the problem had been taken care of. Yet the very next morning the hotel folio had been slipped under the door and showed us checking out that day! I'm tolerant of one such mistake, but after an issue has been brought to the staff's attention and the same mistake is made the following day, I made the decision to never return to this hotel. To top it off, since the hotel staff messed up our check out date, we did not receive housekeeping during part of our stay. All in all, it was a disappointing experience.

<Title>“Good but not great”
<Content>The down side: Rough start with shuttle and check in. After waiting 30 minutes at the airport, I was glad to see the shuttle arrive. Unfortunately, the shuttle didn't stop but continued on. Finally took a taxi as I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes. On check in, the attendant asked if I was standing in the right spot (how would I know the shuttle didn't stop if I wasn't in the correct pick up place??). Room wasn't ready even though it was after 3pm. Was told they would call me when the room was ready. After 2 hours, I stood in the check in line again to inquire if the room was ready. Yes, the room was ready. I did get a call 30 minute later that my room was ready. Had a package sent to the hotel which the hotel staff stated didn't arrive. After phone calls to my secretary and delivery service verifying the package did arrive at the hotel and was signed for by the hotel staff, the hotel was finally able to locate my package. Package arrived damaged but I don't think that was the hotel's fault. I was charged a $5 "handling fee" which I thought was tacky since they obviously didn't handle the package effectively. Positive: Except for the transportation and check in process, the rest of the hotel stay was uneventful. Room was clean. Bed comfortable. Nice view of the bay. Wait staff in the restaurant was friendly.

<Content>My first time in SanDiego, CA. The environment was simply breathtaking! I enjoyed the views, the service, the courtesy of the workers, and the assistance received as needed. The weather was simply perfect, in the 60s, coming from an almost 100 degree environment. The hotel was clean, the food was good, and I enjoyed the vouchers too. Thanks for good customer service, way to go! Hope to be back. JA

<Title>“Great hotel with a magnificient view!”
<Content>I stayed in the west tower of the Sheraton Marina San Diego for three days. Very attractive and clean room. The front desk is really helpful, the staff always try to help you! The view of the sea is incredible! Be sure to book a bay, not marina, view in the west tower (the east tower has not been renovated to my knowledge). Nice complementary appetizers for happy hour in the lounge where is available a free internet desk!

<Title>“Other than weather enjoyed San Diego”
<Content>My only complaint would be when I checked in I was advised that I had booked a room with a king size bed (not the double I thought I had). I wasn't going to let that bother me; besides checking in on July 4th before the fireworks > well I was in a hurry to see the amazing show. Now that I'm home and reviewed my confirmation I did indeed book the double > given that I have confirmation of same you would think the front desk would also and not make it like its my mistake if thats all they had left; the hotel was packed due to the long weekend. I found the hotel very clean and other than the minor mix up with the front desk (seems to be a problem with this hotel given the other comments) I enjoyed my week. The weather was totally unexpected; but not Sheratons fault. I met some friendly locals who were as surprized by the cold weather as I. I loved the location near the airport. Also had a great view of the Navy base. If back in San Diego I'd stay here again; but bring my confirmation in order to avoid check in mix ups.

<Title>“Not what I expected with a 4 star hotel”
<Content>Upon check in, The desk person wrote my rm number illegibly on my key packet & gave me incorrect directions to my rm. Wandered a few floors trying to guess what my rm number could be. Called the desk & they told me they couldn't tell me my rm # over the phone-I'd have to trasp back to the front desk with all my luggage to find out. AC didn't work in rm- it remained 73-76' despite the thermostat being set at 65. Reported this to front desk with no response. Food was mediocre & I didn't get the right items on my order. I never got another pre order breakfast slip after the 1st day. My room cleaning got skipped 1 day. When I called to report it, there were no offers to rectify it, so I had to put forth the question of at least getting some new towels. No map of the hotel grounds in hotel info booklet. I had to wander around to find the entrance to the fitness center ( which was only on the outside), etc. Never found what would be considered the Business center Outside staff were very attentive- about the only plus for this hotel.

<Title>“Nice hotel but isolated from resturaunts/entertainment”
<Content>The room was pretty clean except for a few long black hairs in the bathroom which shouldn't be there for a hotel of this level. The location is isolated from entertainment. It is located right on the marina which is very nice. If you want to go anywhere it's gonna run 10 dollars minimum for a taxi to grab a bite to eat. Also, you'll pay $12 a day for internet in your room. And $12 if you take a drink from the minibar.

<Title>“The Bay Tower is not where you want to be for a conference”
<Content>We were in town for a conference and were put in the Bay Tower when we made our reservation as if it would be a good thing. While I am sure the Marina Tower was 4 star the Bay Tower was lacking in the amenities. The pool bartender Anthony whined and complained that he had to work when the sun finally came out. He told us our beers were $4 each but when he took the money inside for change he kept a $4 tip for himself. The bar should have been able to take cash. The one restaraunt had very limited hours. The shuttle buses were very slow between buildings and on the day we presented this made things difficult getting equipment back and forth. The view over the Marina was lovely but I would have rather had the convenience of being in the main building for our conference. The food at the conference was really done well. After putting many of us in the baytower they should have made a morning coffee cart available to us in the lobby so we could get some while we waited for the shuttle. I would only recommend this if you were in the Marina Tower.

<Title>“Rediscover?....recommend Rethink before deciding to stay here”
<Content>Every aspect of the hotel was a disappointment. Hotel is across from the airport and convenient but so is the Hilton. This property was remodeled but is poorly ran and highly inefficient. I waited nearly a half an hour to check In and was only sixth in line. Upon arrival, there was no one at the front desk and after ten minutes, someone came from the back room and after that, another one for spg guests. The spg gold/platinum person was so slow that the regular person was averaging 5:1 over the spg gold person. As a platinum, I gave up and joined the regular line. After you get the keys and a parking pAss to pay 22 dollars to park in a dirt lot, I was left to my own to find the elevators. There are many elevators and most likely, you will end up o. The wrong elevator like I did. I guess this is how they greet guests or show them the workout room by lugging their luggage in a quest for the room. I have stayed at every star wood property in San Diego and this is by far the worst. They even give you one less in room coffee pack than all of the other Sheraton properties. The rooms are nice with warm rooms nut a lot of hall noise and is not quiet. Also, if you are friendly like me, prepare yourself to be ignored when greeting hotel employees with a friendly hello...I greeted two folks and neither responded. I don't think this property is very kid friendly although they have A pool. To my platinum colleagues, the only amenity the property offers is points so do not expect anything else. This has to be my 45th starwood stay this year and by far the worst...so no need to rediscover or even return.

<Title>“Credit Card Nightmare”
<Content>I stayed four nights for a business conference. Check-in was terrible, and I found out two days into my stay that my credit card was charged double the intended amount, This was a major inconvience (it was the only money I had). The hotel manager provided accomidations for me to eat the rest of my stay. I am back home and my credit card issue is still not resolved. I have several overdraft fees along with checks that did not clear. I missed a whole day of the conference that I was supposed to attend, tring to resolve the problem with the front desk. I was so upset my blood pressure was elevated, and I had to take medication. This was a nightmare. I can say that the view from my room was very nice and the bed was comfortable.

<Title>“Enough with the texting!”
<Content>We just finished our stay at the Sheraton and we were very pleased with the hotel and service. Our only complaint was that the pool attendants spent more time texting than playing with the kids. The two helpers called the kids over to play a golf game that took about 4 minutes and then the helpers sat back down. I asked if the helpers were going to play a game with the kids and they said in about an hour they would maybe play another game. It would have been nice if the helpers could have played tag... with the kids.We have stayed at several beach hotels that have been kid friendly and fun for the kids. Sheraton didn't go the distance and the kids have asked not to return to this hotel. They said it was boring and there was nothing to do. I do not recommend this hotel if you have kids.

<Title>“Loved our stay, pity about the weather!”
<Content>Loved our club room and the club room facilities - breakfast really good in wonderful surroundings, although hotel very busy due to 4th of July weekend. Ideal position for travelling about (and also watching San Diego Bay fireworks!). Pity Sheraton couldn't do anything about the weather (colder than Scotland!) Would thoroughly recommend the hotel and its facilities and would visit again if in California.

<Title>“Not Happy With the Management”
<Content>Check in took over 30 Min. We checked in on Friday before the 4th of July holiday weekend. You would think they would have more than one person checking in, but she was very nice and did apologize for the wait. The room was great with a wonderful view. 4th of July fire works were amazing! We stayed three nights and never had any hot water. Other than that we enjoyed the room (bay tower 4th floor) . Checking out-not so great! The rate we were quoted when booking the room was some how changed to $50 more a night. The manager on duty did NOTHING to change my rate and said that's what it is and offered a print out of the rate SHE has. After checking out I spent 45 min on the phone with cental reservation, who were the ones I booked my stay with. Come to find out when I called to confirm my room and rate 4 days before some how the rate was changed. I was told to call the mgr and they will fix it. I called to speak with the same mgr I spoke with when I checked out and she said sorry it's still $50 more a night and I must have changed something when I called to confirm. Hummm...wouldnt I know that? And no, I didn't change anything. She said she couldn't help me and would have to speak with her mgr and would return my call the next day. Mind you all of this is still being done on my vacation. Back at home the next day, I still haven't heard anything. I call the same mgr at the hotel and asked her why I haven't heard back from her. She said she will go ahead and correct the bill since she doesn't want to go "round and round" with me. Pretty shady considering she told me she couldn't make any changes the day before. Hopefullly when the bill comes in it will have the correct rate quoted charged. If it wasn't for the rate issue and the way the management handled it poorly, I would have gone back.

<Title>“Disappointing”
<Content>We stayed for the July 4th weekend. The hotel is okay.. It's not luxurious or fancy and it didn't really meet our expectations - especially at the price ($229 + taxes + $28 parking each day). We stayed in the Bay Tower and had an amazing view for the fireworks - that's the best part. The bathrooms are clean enough but not well maintained... Iron spots/rust in the tub..grungy corners.. just generally looking a little old and worn. For the price, we hoped for a really comfortable, clean, superior hotel experience. That's not this hotel. We also had problems with housekeeping.. We left Saturday at 9:30 to visit Old Town and came back at 2:30 and they still hadn't cleaned our room.. but we had to put our son down for his nap so we couldn't wait for them to clean it then.. and housekeeping leaves at 4pm so we didn't get our room cleaned at all. (Should have requested the $5 "greener" credit for that day in hindsight!) The parking fee is ridiculous too.. like everyone else says. Unless we want the amazing 4th of July fireworks view, we won't be staying here again. There's a slew of other hotels downtown that are cheaper and/or able to meet our vacation expectations.

<Title>“Plastic in the food & Bed Bugs!”
<Content>What was supposed to be a fun family vacation mixed in with some work turned out to be a hue disappointment. When I booked the room I was presented with photos and reviews of all the outstanding renovations. When we arrived we were quickly told we would be a the “other” tower. The bayside tower was not what we had seen or booked. Not wanting to make a big deal about it we checked in. It took 25 minutes before the desk answered my call to bring up our luggage. By that time my husband had self parked our car, gotten a coffee and made his way back to our room only to have to turn around and go get our luggage himself. We went to meet my sister in law who we were traveling with who was in the Marina Tower for dinner. We went to Quinns as the other restaurant was not open?? In our order of fish and chips we were served a piece of deep fried plastic that was still attached to the fish. My husband nearly choked on it thinking it was a bone! Our waitress did her best but she was missing in action most of our meal. When the Manager did come over he offered to comp the dish. Unfortunately, not wanting to make a scene in front or our 2 small children we said okay. Needless to say, the meal was ruined for everyone and no one finished their meals. $90.00 for food no one could eat and service that was unacceptable. We went back to our hotel and the next morning my husband woke up with a huge bug bite on his leg, when we pulled back the sheets on the bed bugs flew out. We were able to catch one to show to the Operations Manager and bug guy. My husband still has the bite on his leg and it’s been over a week we have been home. We were moved to the Main Tower and upgraded to a mini suite with $100 Sheraton money but we were paying $300 a night to get fed plastic and to get bit by bed bugs!!! Unacceptable. I would not and will not recommend your hotel to personal or business travelers.

<Title>“Nickled and Dimed”
<Content>This Sheraton is a nice hotel with a nice view, but the rooms are too small. We stayed here as part of a wedding party; otherwise, we would have gone somewhere cheaper. They didn't give a very good group rate. Of course, parking was $20 plus a day, but that is becoming more common. The annoying fee was to have internet in your room. It's free in the lobby but not in your room. At over $200/night just give us internet access please. also, you couldn't put your own drinks in the firdge; otherwise you were charged. They have mini fridges to rent, but it's another fee. Food and drink was over priced for the value. Our air conditioning didn't work in our room, but we just left the window open and enjoyed the breeze. Amazingly the gym was free and that's awesome!!

<Title>“Club benefits a joke-10 people in line for breakfast & staff clears buffet”
<Content>This was the worst Starwood Preferred Guest experience I have had. The designated reception counter was cold and uninterested in being helpful. I was traveling with my son and Grandsons and although we took 2 rooms for 2 nights after a booking error in the secondary building the only rooms we could get were on the club floor. They were lovely rooms but the $50 surcharge/per room for the club was a joke. Breakfast was served until 9:30 and when they ran out of food(coffee, toast, cream, milk, etc. at 9:15 they were reluctant and slow to replace and then at 9:29 with 10 people in llne they cleared the buffet. The computer did not work and the staff was unhelpful, indifferent and dismissive. Very disappointing.

<Title>“This was the worst experience I have ever had at a Sheraton- which is my preferred hotel”
<Content>I have not only stayed at various Sheraton location, but I have also stayed at this one and I was truly disappointed. Where should I start. I understand going green, that means no changing of the sheets and towels on the everyday basis. That does not mean no housekeeping at all. No garbage being taken out, no dishes being removed from the room. No housekeeping at all. Next, the restaurant and bar is being serviced by one-person when their is a convention in town- really- one person. I waited almost 20 minutes for a bell-hop to come and pick-up my luggage. No- wife in 2010 when you are paying over $200.00 a nite - unacceptable. Cheaper hotels have free wife. Lat but not least. I needed to fed-ex something back home and you have to go over to the first tower to the fed-ex location to pikc-up the boxes and then just because you are in the second tower you must pay an additional $10.00 to ship- just because I was not in the main tower- aren't you all the same establishment- just different towers, I cannot believe just because the hotel chose for me to stay in the Bay Tower instead of the Marina Tower that a delivery is going to cost me an additional $10.00. I was very unhappy with this stay and based on the traveling that I do for business and pleasure I need the Sheraton to look into these areas for improvement as well as classify the difference between going green and shortage of housekeeping service. I also forgot the main desk mixing up a delivery package between my co-worker and myself- thank goodness we knew each other to make the change. Or my package would have went to another customer. I also attempted to call the front desk on (2) occassions and the phone rang no less than 15-20 times before someone answered. I was truly disappointed in the service at this hotel on this occassion.

<Title>“Secondary Location, Crazy Add-On Charges, Plastic Cups, no SPG benefit”
<Content>Against my better judgment I booked this Harbor Island property which is well away from where the center of San Diego's enjoyable nightlife has relocated. The staff was pleasant in every way, but too many things weren't great, for example: * despite paying $279 my room looked out on a gravel rooftop * there were plastic drinking cups (think Holiday Inn) in the bathroom * no wireless Internet and $18.95/day charge to connect * $22 for one night to park my own car in an uncovered lot * $21 for a breakfast buffet * no acknowledgement for being Starwood Gold, and no benefits offered With taxes, the Internet, parking and my typical buffet breakfast the tab for one night was $355. Sorry, but that's way too much for just an average property in a secondary location.

<Content>Sheraton Harbor Island Drive took my breath away the moment I stepped into the lobby and then again the moment we got into our room. Everything about the room made me comfortable. I loved the white comforter. So clean,thus when its very white and remained white, you know the hotel actually is very clean. Very white towels, white sheets--just made me feel right at home.

<Title>“Great location but disappointing in many ways”
<Content>While the location was great and the views from our room were terrific, there were several disappointing features: 1. No WIFI in the hotel rooms - hard to believe that there is no WIFI in hotel rooms -- people were huddled down in the lobby to gain access to the only free Wifi in the building 2. Nickel and diming attitude - children's tv channels which are normally part of the standard cable channels at a house or hotel - here Sheraton wanted to charge so that my daughter could watch the Disney 3. Concierge - turns out that Sheraton has "outsourced" its concierge to Expedia...so tix to Seaworld instead of being at the best possible price (which is normally what a concierge would work hard to do), were charged at Expedia rates which equalled highway robbery (20-25% more than buying the tix ourselves) 4. Website of hotel boasts of kayaking -- the kayak facility is seasonal and wasn't open 5. The bicycles available for hotel guest rental are old, worn, and barely functional 6. A Club dining room with NO hot water or amenities after hours..all they had was a refrigerator with water bottles and a bowl of sad-looking fruit...and NO wifi up in the club room either In all a lot of small details that added up to a disappointing "resort" experience...

<Title>“It was ok”
<Content>I went on priceline put in a bid for a four star hotel for $100/night. I really didn't think I would get anything, but this came in. I was pretty excited at first, until I read the reviews. I figured for what I paid a night it would be worth it. They put us in the marina tower, and just like the other reviews, this is a bit older tower and not as nice as the main one but it had great views! The beds are comfortable and clean. The only wierd thing is the towlets have the loudest flush I have ever heard. You can hear when other rooms flush them too. We had a little airplane noise, but not too bad. We ended up falling asleep on the balcony one night, it was very relaxing. We had a car and the location was perfect for us, since we spent alot of time cruising the bay. All in all, if you can pay $100 a night like we did, it is a great value.

<Title>“absolutely perfect! beautiful hotel and lovely staff”
<Content>Just returned 2 days ago after spending our last 6 nights of Californian trip at the Sheraton Hotel and marina.I cannot believe the negative reviews because we thought this was the best hotel of our trip!!The whole hotel has a wonderful ambience,beautifully decorated and the beds are so very comfortable.We were upgraded to the club floor so could have breakfast every morning in the club lounge with its panoramic views of both the marina and the San Diego skyline.There was no airport noise in our room when the balcony door was closed plus the planes do not fly at night so can`t imagine how people could be kept awake!i can`t recommend this hotel enough and will certainly recommend it to anyone going to San Diego.

<Title>“I loved this hotel.”
<Content>I am so surprised as I read some of the previous negative reviews. I stayed here for 6 nights and thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The hotel is conveniently located to many of the tourist sites which made it easy to tour after our conference. The service at the restaurant was excellent. The waitstaff was prompt, attentive, warm and friendly. They made me feel like they really cared whether I enjoyed my meal or not. We used valet parking and received our car within minutes of our request. The valet staff was courteous and again friendly. In fact every hotel staff person that I dealt with was extremely helpful. Everyone greeted me when I passed them and always looked me in the eye which made me feel like they were really focused on me. The ambiance of the hotel was lovely. The comfortable seating areas in the lobby were great for socializing and relaxing. There were computers available for guests which helped me a great deal. The decks and patios were lovely to sit on to gaze at the beautiful view of the marina. In the evening it was so nice to sit outside at one of the fire pits and relax in a rocking chair in the cool San Diego night air. My room was on the ground floor which made me a little nervous because of the sliding glass door. Therefore, I didn't open the drapes. I would have liked to have let light in but it was too easy for anyone to see inside the room since I faced the parking lot. I would have preferred a view of the marina and a room higher up. However, the room was clean, comfortable, quiet, and had a cheerful decor. I was surprised that being so close to the airport, I rarely heard a plane. Maybe being downstairs was a plus! I enjoyed my stay here and would love to return.

<Title>“Disappointment in this Sheraton property”
<Content>Staying in the Bay Tower. Hotel parking is very limited and costly. The room was nice until you start to hear the noise around bedtime. Toilet flushed like a cruise ship and you could also hear the bathroom noise from other guests. Airport noise was not too bad, not much can be done about that. I have stayed at other Sheraton properties and have been pleased with the hotel. This property to me does not measure up to the name. Staff was nice at both towers and friendly, no complaints there. They should not charge for internet use. Other lower priced properties don't charge. I was very disappointed about the $11.95 fee.

<Title>“WOW! We sure enjoyed our stay at this hotel! We will be coming back! They Love Dogs Too!”
<Content>My wife and I booked at the Sheraton Harbor Marina Tower (the largest of the two Sheraton's on Harbor Island). We got the "Romance Package" and stayed in the Marina Suite. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious, very clean and had a picture postcard view of Downtown San Diego. We were even impressed that we barely heard the planes taking off and landing at the San Diego Airport which is just about 1/4 mile away. The bed was very comfortable. We slept so well. Also, the newly decorated room was very nice. Probably most important for us was that they welcomed our dog with no added charge and no fuss. Sure they wanted us to be responsible for our little guy, but it was nice that we felt welcome. There was even a very nice restaurant on the island called the "C-Lounge" that welcomed him on their patio. The view of the city at night was breathtaking from the restaurant's vantage point. Now back to the Romance Package, it was a great value. The complementary "breakfast in bed" EACH DAY was impressive. We ordered off of the menu what we wanted and had deliciously prepared FULL breakfasts delivered to the room both days we stayed there. Then on our anniversary night we got a complementary bottle of champagne and 6 huge chocolate covered strawberries. Finally, they offered us a very late checkout of 4pm, which we gladly used. We enjoyed every minute of time just relaxing on one of the two balconies overlooking the city, sail boats and Navy ships on the bay. The only downsides were that daily self-parking was $22.00 and in-room high speed internet was $11.95 per day (up to $18.95 for super fast internet). NO WIRELESS IN ROOM, BUT FREE WIRELESS IN THE LOBBY. This is pretty steep compared to other properties we've stayed at. But we felt that, given the total value of the package we booked, it was ok. WE WILL BE BACK and I heartily recommend this property for your next vacation! We did not experience any of the negatives in service mentioned by other folks who stayed here.

<Title>“This hotel has gone downhill in the past 2 years!”
<Content>This hotel had many problems. No one answered the phone--operator, room service, guest service...NO ONE! They have NO towel bars in the bathroom yet encourage going green and reusing towels--that can NOT be hung up! They had an earthquake and we were swaying on the 8th floor, but when I went down the elevator to find out if we might be evacuated as they were 2 months ago the staff said they NEVER evacuated! Lying to guests is not good customer service--and they had no idea what to say to all the concerned guests!! The consierges were wonderful and the restaurant staff, but the rest of the hotel NOT too great!!!

<Title>“A shaky mix of positives and negatives.”
<Content>Let me start by saying I am not normally the complaining type, after spending 17 years as a travel agent - - I've seen my fair share of hotels and know stuff happens when travelling and you need to just roll with it sometimes! We just returned from a 3 night stay at this property, at which I'd reserved the AAA 'Hot Deals' rate which includes an upgrade to a deluxe room and $50.00 food/beverage credit per day. I printed the confirmation which stated our rate of $159.00 per night was for a room in the Bay Tower, along with the upgrade/credit Terms associated with that AAA deal. When we arrived, I was given the keys to a room in the Lanai section of the hotel (basically, out in the boondocks .. obviously an older part of the hotel and on the ground floor). I asked about the Bay Tower room on my confirmation and was informed the hotel was100% booked and it was all they had. I could check the next day for an upgrade. It was somewhat late (9:45pm) and we were exhausted - - so we went to the room. It was clean, and decorated in a crisp nautical decor .. but the ceiling seemed lower than normal, giving it a cavelike feel and the windows opened up to the back of the green tarp surrounding the tennis courts and a rooftop full of steam vents, etc. peaking over that. The extremely bright lights of the tennis courts were a nuisance. The showerhead was impressive looking.. the size of a dinner plate! ...but the water pressure was pitiful. I couldn't believe we'd paid $159.00 .. plus $22.00 parking and taxes, amounting to about $200.00 a night - for this! I've gotten some pretty decent rooms through Priceline for less than half that at other hotels. Ugh. The next morning, I went to the front desk and asked to be moved. They had a room available in the Marina Tower, 7th floor...which sounded like a drastic improvement over the room we spent the night in. My husband and teenage daughter were off taking sailing lessons in the harbor for Father's Day .. so I decided to take the room and move our stuff so they could be happily surprised at the end of their day. Silly me, I asked if there could be SOME sort of compensation .. perhaps a comp. day of parking? .. for my troubles and the fact that we were actually downgraded instead of upgraded - - but the gentleman said the parking is separately owned and he couldn't discount it. Terrible customer service, in my opinion. After getting all of our belongings into the new room, I noticed the air conditioner was not working! Aaaggghh!!! I called maintenance not once, but twice .. and after 2 hours of waiting - - the guy arrived and quickly fixed it. At that point I was just relieved to not have to move again. LOL. Now for some positives .. the hotel itself has a very appealing ambiance with the nautical decor and gorgeous views of the water, boats, etc. The pool area is nice as well, with rock work and waterfalls and daily activities for the kids. The restaurant food was good, although pricey ($68.00 for breakfast for the 3 of us, $20.00 for a plate of chicken nuggets/fries and a soda) and is set along an expansive wall of windows overlooking the harbor as well. There's a Starbucks in the lobby, so at least there's an option for something less expensive. The rooms are comfortable and fresh, lovely views (from the tower rooms..haha) but be prepared to hear the sound of jets taking off at the airport which is in very close proximity. The Fitness Center is large, lots of equipment. And next to that are a couple of ping pong tables .. which people seemed to be enjoying every time I was in the gym. The parking lot is also a big negative. WAY too small for such a large property. If you go down one aisle and can't find a spot, it is blocked on one end and you have to actually back up to exit to look down the next aisle! Two out of the three nights, we returned after going into town - - only to find NO parking available except for way out on the Lanai side of the hotel. We had to walk all the way through that section to the Marina Tower to our room. Shoulda stayed in the cave, I guess. Last, but not least, when we received our bill on the last day - - the $50.00 per day food/beverage credit was nowhere to be found. I had to stand in line at the front desk in order to have it adjusted. She apologized with a smile and thanked me for staying with them.

<Title>“I was rather disappointed by this hotel...”
<Content>I was rather disappointed by this hotel. The location and views were great but that is were the positives end. The bed was very comfortable, but there were what appeared to be blood stains on our sheets. The cleanliness of the hotel I would say to be below average and our shower curtain was also stained pink at the bottom. But, the worst aspect of the hotel had to be the noise. It was the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed at. I felt like I was in a college dorm again. I don't know if it was the guests that were there when we were or that their walls and windows are paper thin, but it made for a bad stay.

<Content>I travel a lot for work and it's always great to have excellent customer service. And, from time to time, you will cross path with an individual that truly cares about their job. Lorna Alagar at the Sheraton Hotel & Marina in San Diego, CA will make you feel great about your day and your visit. She took a terrible day that I was having and turned it around into a positive. Her calm demeanor and professionalism is impeccable. What a great asset to this hotel. Thank you Lorna Alagar for simply just being you. See you soon!

<Title>“I doubt that I will ever return”
<Content>I am a pretty seasoned traveler and have stayed in dozens of hotels in the last 10 years. Sheraton San Diego had the distinction of being the first hotel that I ever found a live bug (identified by my 11 year old cousin) crawling in the bedding and also the first where I found hair in the bathroom AND no soap when I entered the room. We got our breakfast comped because of the bug incident, but not much was done about the hair other than it was cleaned while I was gone. Room was actually nice, front desk personnel very friendly, but those two incidents stick out. I must also say, although this has little to do with the hotel, that I was disappointed with Priceline because this is listed as a downtonw/Gas Lamp hotel, and this is hardly the case. It is a $12 cab ride to that area.

<Title>“Nice hotel - but no WIFI in room”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel June 2010 for a conference. The hotel is nice, and the staff is extremely helpful, especially the woman who helped find my reservation when it was spelled wrong. However, for the price, I expect to have internet access in my room without paying more. The hotel charges $11.95 / day more to get a wired connection in the room. The only place to get free WIFI is in the lobby, which if you're in the Lanai building, is a walk through the other building. The Lanai building is an older building, and quieter than the other towers. The sliding glass door, out to the balcony, is very nice and quiet. Overall, it's a nice hotel near the airport, but the lack of wifi makes a business trip difficult

<Title>“Nice and quiet for being by an airport”
<Content>This is a nice, quiet and clean hotel close to airport. A little further than I wanted from the things we did. There is no trolley stops at or near this hotel, so you would need a car or take a taxi. It is approx. 3 - 5 miles from downtown gas lamp quarters. If you rent a car be prepared to pay $28 a day to park it at hotel, a little pricey if you ask me! No restaurants or shopping within walking distance. Hotel restaurant very pricey! When we checked in there were dirty dishes outside the room on the floor from previous guests that stayed there for 4 out of our 6 days there, complained three times before they finally picked them up. Overall hotel experience was great! If you drive to downtown be prepared to pay $20 to park. Seaworld is great, but spend the whole day as there is alot to see and do. Do not waste your money on the zoo. Definitely go to the USS Midway Museum. If you have a rent car to to LaJolla Beach and see the baby seals that hang out there.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>I was originally concerned with this Hotel because it was so close to the airport but it was beautfiul, spacious and had a perfect location.. When you got to hotel it was very big and felt more like a resort than a hotel. We had a great view from our room of the marina. We stayed in the Marina tower, which is newer and everythign seems to be in this section. (Starbucks, Restaurants, gift shop, pools, gym) Rooms were totally updated, with nice bedding and very clean. I would def stay here again and recommend to a friend. If you are debating this or right downtown, this is a really nice hotel, cab to downtown is $11 and you have more room and a Big pool. I dont think you will get that downtown. Also "The Link" which is there computer/social area is fabulous!

<Title>“A comfortable and clean hotel”
<Content>I booked this hotel for the night of our arrival into San Diego as we were landing late in the night. The shuttle was easy and the hotel is across the street from the airport. It is a large hotel that is clean and upper scale. The rooms were comfortable and the beds were really nice. I got a great rate on this hotel of $120 through the hotel's website, which I thought was a deal, especially since is was not through priceline or expedia, etc. I woudl stay here again for sure.

<Title>“This Sheraton Rocks!”
<Content>I had the best stay here. Really comfortable bed and beautiful view of the bay (city view). They have an excellent green option - for each day you forego maid service, you receive a $5 certificate to be used in any of the restaurants. They have bikes to rent for $7/hour and you can ride along the water on the bike path right into downtown. Takes about 20 minutes to get to Sea Port Village by bike. The staff are super friendly. You will love staying here!

<Title>“Great Place to Stay”
<Content>My husband and I recently booked this hotel thru a Priceline special for $99 a night when most four star hotels were charging $250 per night due to the marathon. We were very pleased with the choice. The hotel is a short cab ride ($15) to the Gaslamp area. There is a nice shuttle to pick up/drop off near the airport. We didnt stay in the main tower but this wasn't a problem as we still had a pretty view of the marina, and a huge room. The room was clean, nicely decorated, and very comfortable. While it is close to the airport this was not a problem as the airport seems to be situated near most everything so the noise would have been a factor anywhere. I only heard the planes a couple times and it never bothered our sleep. We enjoyed our stay!

<Title>“Best place to stay for GATOR by the BAY always Mother's Day Weekend.”
<Content>This was the second time we have stayed at this Hotel. It is across the steet from Terminal 2 at the San Diego Airport and they offer a free shuttle. Since it was our Anniversary we decided to stay two nights. I must have mentioned this when I booked the hotel several months in advance. We arrived back to our room about 10 PM on Friday night after attending the The Gator by the Bay Festival. Much to our surprise and delight the Sheraton remembered our 32nd Anniversary with a very nice bottle of wine, a large attractive bowl of fruit with about eight different kinds of fruit. Then to top it off , the most beautiful 8" designer type Anniversary Cake. It made our whole weekend. This hotel would also be a great place to stay if your taking a cruise out of San Diego. They have incredible views, to the east is the famous Coronado Bridge and Coronado Island and to the West is the Marina both with beautiful views of the San Diego Bay. The pool area is really nice and we enjoyed spending the afternoon in the sun and water. Oh yea, and the beds are sooo comfortable. A great place to stay and we will be back.

<Title>“Nice Airport Hotel”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here for Memorial Day weekend. We got the hotel through a blind bid on Priceline and would have preferred a more downtown hotel (as the bidding area includes both the Downtown and Harbor regions) but at the end of the weekend were very pleased with the Sheraton. We checked in on Saturday evening and were very happy when the woman checking us in gave us a marina view. The hotel was bustling with activity and there were a lot of people using the internet access in the lobby and the Link access they had with a few computer terminals. We walked around the hotel and down the marina a bit and saw the two pools - one of the pool areas was showing The Little Mermaid which was a good idea if you had kids. I believe they have movie showings throughout the summer on Fridays and Saturdays on large screens outdoors. The room was nice with a very comfortable bed and a flat panel TV. The bathroom was on the smaller size but perfectly adequate. There was a balcony with a few lounge chairs that gave us a view of the marina. The hotel is a block away from the airport so if you have a morning or evening flight and want a hotel right near the airport, this is your choice. For the most part we really enjoyed the hotel. The only issue we had was that the parking area is very limited and we had to park in the back area and our car ended up pretty filthy because the back lot isn't paved and is a dirt lot. Considering the parking is $22/night it would be nice if they would at least pave the back lot so I'm not forced to get a car wash after staying there. Also, if you don't have a car you're somewhat limited in places you can go on foot. Overall this is a pretty good hotel and we'd be happy staying here again.

<Title>“Definitely not Starwood standards”
<Content>I have spent 6 nights at this hotel for a conference, and I have to say that the quality of the service is very poor. I had to change my room as the first one had not been cleaned (hairs on bathroom's floor, sticky desk), check-in was very long, room was "cleaned" at 3pm, free internet access not working properly etc.... The hotel offers you a voucher if you decline the cleaning for environmental purpose but most probably it is more a question of lack of staff. The hotel is located very close from airport, so convenient for one night but quite far from dowtown.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel, Unfortunately Away from All the Action”
<Content>This is definitely a beautiful 4 star hotel, probably good for conventions or business meetings. I was lucky enough to get the last room in the Marina Tower; I probably would have left had I been booked in the Bay Tower... I hate that "Annex" concept where they have those overflow bldgs that have none of the amenities and niceties of the main bldg. Luckily the lady at the check-in desk saw my face when she said Bay Tower and quickly made the adjustment to the Marina Tower with no complaints. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. My room was small, but very pretty, with gorgeous harbor, bay, downtown views and a balcony! The property was lovely. But huge minus for the location, unfortunately. I was expecting this to be walking distance to the gaslamp and other parts of downtown San Diego, but this is really better described as a very well done airport hotel (the airport is across the street). I'm a walker, and downtown San Diego is such a great walking area, but I had to get in my car to go anywhere. And speaking of car, I thought $22 for parking was quite steep considering the fact that we were not in the heart of downtown to begin with. So,mixed reviews on this place. It's pretty and will prob work if you're a business traveler or looking for something convenient from the airport. But, if you're looking for a place that's in the heart of it all, this is not your hotel.

<Title>“Nice hotel complex”
<Content>Very good hotel, just a few minutes from the airport. Make sure your room is in the main Marina Tower. The room itself was nice, contemporary style, with a balcony facing the water. Good service and prices. I don't think there was any wi-fi internet in the room but I might be wrong. Food in the restaurant is ok, try the seafood salad sandwich. The shuttle bus didn't run as often as I expected. Convenient ticket check-in kiosk in the lobby will save you time at the airport (security lines are long). For a nice dinner with view, try Bertrand at Mr. A.

<Content>Hi, I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights . The dance festival used this hotel as the host hotel. I enjoyed the great location, free airport shuttle service, good food and the free internet use. The hotel also offers green incentives. I chose njot to have my sheets changes everyday and I received a $5 coupon for any restaurant in the hotel - very worth it!!! The staff was friendly and the spa area was quiet and relaxing - just what I was looking for.

<Title>“Don't stay in the Bay Tower”
<Content>We stayed in the Bay Tower because it has larger rooms and we needed a rollaway bed. The front desk gave us wrong directions to the I-5. We opted for the green option. That apparently means that you don't get any service at all. We didn't need our towels laundered every day but we did need toilet paper and soap. That took us about 30 minutes after my daughter found a cleaning person in the hall. We went over the the main hotel in the evening and found the Tapatini Bar (lobby bar) to be a great place for a drink. Scott is a great bartender and very good at making martinis. We can't say the hotel was all bad but if we stayed again, we would stay in the Marina Tower.

<Title>“Who Ever Said Business Couldn't Be Fun?”
<Content>My husband and I along with several colleagues stayed here for a large software conference in May 2010. What an experience! The first impression left by the front lobby and the staff of the front desk was incredible. Staff members were extremely helpful, courteous, and friendly. The check-in process was a breeze, and our wishes were accommodated. Our room was impeccable as well, and had a stellar view. We rated the beds "very good" only because there is no bed like home; they were very comfortable and inviting. Housekeeping was efficient, friendly, and also accommodating to our needs. The "Green Choice" program offered by the Sheraton is a fabulous idea and is beneficial to the environment while also making the guest feel like they're getting a bargain. I love that there was a Starbucks inside the facility. We tried Quinn's, and enjoyed it, but more, really enjoyed several meals at Papanani's, a little deli/eatery located between the two towers (the prices were very low, food was excellent, and the ambiance was incredible). Additionally, half-way through the week, we found that we had to extend our stay a day; the hotel was very accommodating and gave us the conference rate for the extra day. Parking is a little steep for us East Coasters ($22/day), but we found fairly cheap fares in the shuttles and vans available to hotel guests. Very conveniently located across the interstate from the airport; however, while inside the hotel room itself, we could not hear planes taking off and landing. The SheratonLink in the lobby offered free wireless internet and plenty of cozy seating areas for those who didn't want to pay for in-room services. For our first trip to California, we were very impressed, and would highly recommend the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for business and pleasure.

<Title>“A room with a view”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina for one night prior to our cruise. It was great to have a shuttle from the airport to the hotel although it took a while for it to come even though the hotel is fairly close to the airport. We stayed in the Bay Tower with a view over the harbour. The rooms were large although not in perfect condition. This hotel is a reasonable distance from town. (Approx $15 by taxi). This hotel was fine for one night but you really require a car if staying any longer.

<Title>“Poor location, nice hotel for conference”
<Content>This hotel is a decent one for a conference- good amenities, close to the airport. Not great food onsite though and getting to downtown or any other parts of San Diego required a cab ride and some time. Beautiful views of the marina and the bay from many rooms. There are actually two buildings, about a five minute walk apart - we were not told this when making our reservation and ended up not staying where our conference was. This wasn't a difficult problem as it was a pleasant walk, but would have been difficult for people with difficulties walking or getting about. The staff were pleasant and helpful. Rooms were standard and clean.

The professionalism, thoughtful solution, and time that was freely given to my situtation was remarkable. I want to say thank you to Warren, and his administrative assistant, Hilga. Your the best!

<Title>“Big Fat Disappointment”
<Content>If you really want to see San Diego and all it has to offer, don't stay here. The description the hotel website gives is a fabrication. There are 2 parts to this hotel- the "hotel" and the "motel". After thinking we were staying in a 4 star hotel with a view, we ended up driving up to our room with an outside door in the motel portion and had a view of a fence and if we looked up, the airport. SUPER disappointing. The girl that checked us in was unfriendly and unwilling to move us or ensure we would get moved the next day. The hotel did move us after the first night, but the view was still not great. The rooms are just ok, but not 4 star quality rooms. It is about a 10 minute drive downtown. There is very little to do in the area where the Shearton is located, yet parking costs $30 per night. San Diego offers SO much... do not stay here. Stay downtown or on Coronado. I was willing to lose my money on our room at the Shearton just to get the heck out of there.

<Title>“Wished I could have stayed longer”
<Content>We had a little extra time on our vacation, so we booked a weekend through Hotwire and took our chances. I wasn't real thrilled at first to be booked into this hotel becuase I had stayed here twice before for conventions. The first one I got a room miles from the main tower right next to the swimming pool pump room. The second time I got a room overlooking the parking lot. I was at a convention then, so it wasn't really a big deal, but this was a nice getaway with my hubby. Thanks to other reviews, I knew to ask for the Marina Tower with a Harbor view. I did not use the automated check in system just so that I could request a room with a view. The check in chick was really friendly and gave us a room on the 9th floor facing west over the harbor and marina. The sunsets were fantastic and hubby and I even ordered room service one night just so we could enjoy the view. The room was decorated in a red, white and blue nautical theme. It was very tasteful. We had breakfast one day in the restaurant. It was really nice and we had a nice window table by the marina. The hostess was super nice and our waitress was very efficient. The price was less expensive than I thought it would be. There was a rude dude at the table next to us watching sports on his laptop and talking on his cel phone. We asked him nicely to turn down his computer or use an earpice. He continued to talk on his cell phone. I can't believe these kind of people, but it isn't really a reflection on the hotel. All of the hotel staff seemed exceptionally nice. We even observed some staff trying to help out the UK guests in accomodating them with additional nights and telling them what parks and other places were offering free or reduced admissions for them because of the volcano and ash that caused them to have to stay longer. All in all, I wish I could relive my weekend again in exactly the same way (minus the rude dude at breakfast). The only thing I didn't like was having to pay for parking. I was prepared for it as my reservation clearly stated the price of parking. $22/day isn't bad if it's a covered parking garage, but for a parking lot it's kind of steep, especially when we had to park way out in the dirt/gravel. Five stars all around except for cleanliness and that's only because there was a large urine stain on the down blanket of one of the beds.

<Title>“Great venue, pleasant staff, wonderfully comfortable beds”
<Content>We stayed for 1 day en route to a Panama canal cruise. Having read some negative reviews prior to leaving England, we booked in after a 23 hr journey with trepidation! Ok, so the reception seems understaffed & checking in took 20 minutes - but, our room was fine, the view was onto the tennis courts, we thought it may be noisy as it was on the ground floor near the swimming pool - it, was so quiet and the beds were soooo comfortable. In fact the only disruption we had was from noisy americans laughing outside the door at 3am! The food in the bar area was good as was breakfast and the staff so pleasant and helpful, particularly the waitress at breakfast, who went to great pains to introduce all those going on the cruise before we left the restauraunt. Overall we were impressed & thankful that the negative reviews were unfounded. As it is so near to the airport, would definately stay here again and hope for a room on a higher floor .

<Title>“A wonderful hotel with beautiful views of San Diego”
<Content>We visit our children in San Diego once or twice a year. It is late when we arrive and we love to stay at the Sheraton Bay Wing for a night or two. We ask for an upper floor for a better view. You can see the city lights, cruise ships, the Coronado Bridge , military ships and so much more. The rooms are nice, and very clean. We have always had very good service with a smile from all the employees. The only down side is, if you don't have a car, it is a bit of a walk to the wharf and town. However a cab ride is only about $15.00. The hotel food is quite good and room service food is very good with prompt service. We will continue to stay there every time we are in San Diego.

<Title>“Good location, great staff but a little bit shabby.”
<Content>Recently stayed in Marina Tower on the 6th floor for a week. Location was excellent and taxi's to most attractions such as Sea World, Zoo, Gas Lamp are approx $15 each way. The lobby and grounds are immaculate and first impressions are excellent. Check in was prompt and efficient. The room was a good size but it felt a little shabby due to scuff marks on walls, stained grout around shower, stains on furniture, rusty fire sprinklers, etc. There wasn't one single issue that was enough to complain about, but combined they did take the gloss of the early impressions of the hotel. I also noticed numerous stains on the carpet in the hallways and the ice machine on the 6th floor was out of order for the duration of our stay. I'm not a big fan of Starbucks, but I was glad it was there as the restaurant has a fairly limited breakfast menu and is a little expensive for it's standard. Quinn's pub is a nice place to have a quick meal and a drink. The reason we would return to this hotel is the staff. As it was our first time in San Diego we availed of the concierge desk on a few occasions. The ladies on the desk are fantastic and seemed genuinely happy to help. We would rate the hotel a 4.0 based on our experience. If a little more time was spent ensuring everything worked and was clean the rating would be a 4.5

<Title>“Really nice hotel.”
<Content>We purchased two rooms through Hotwire at a very good price. We were very pleased with the quality of the rooms. We stayed in the Bay Tower. We had a lovely view of the marina. The room was very spacious and pretty. The bed was great with wonderful bedding. In other reviews some stated the hotel was not close to anything. We found it to be within ten minutes of the Gaslamp District and Petco stadium, and a straight shot from our hotel. Also within walking distance of our hotel was a superb restaurant called C Level, which was located on the water. It is so easy to get around San Diego and we loved overlooking the marina from our balcony. Very very close to the airport but the airport is very close to everything else too!

<Title>“Convenient Location, Decent Room, a Bit Over-Priced”
<Content>This hotel was sufficient for the needs of my wife and myself, but given the price and my wife's SPG status, I would have expected better. We were placed on the 4th floor above the pool, in which we experienced loud enough pool noise to require earplugs to sleep. Although not pleased, we were leaving on a very early flight, thus our decision to stay at this location. The bed was comfortable and bathroom sufficient, but service was lacking. When we asked the Concierge about the airport shuttle, they said we could catch the first shuttle with no problem. As it turned out, we had to wait 2 shuttles before we could get to the airport. The pool area might have been nice, but we did not have time to enjoy it.

<Title>“Exceeded my (high) expectations!!”
<Content>My husband, son (7) and I had the pleasure of being guests at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for two nights pre-Panama Canal cruise at the end of March (March 26-28). This was an extra special trip for my husband's 40th b-day. ALL the Sheraton staff (kudos to the manager, Keri Robinson, in particular) went above and beyond to make the stay so special for us. The views from our balconies (yes, two!) were superb. Dining at both the pub/restaurant and the Sheraton Dining Room within the hotel were excellent. I think the Pub/restaurant was a very good value for the $. Some reviewer noted a lumpy bed. Well, not in the room I had. Yummo-- I slept like a princess. The staff was always wearing a kind smile, but not in a fake attitude way that you sometimes encounter at hotels. If ever in San Diego again I will definitely stay at this hotel. Although this hotel is often overlooked by cruisers for a prestay visit, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. Cabs can take you anywhere you want to go pretty quickly. Also car rentals can be found super cheap if you do comparison shopping. The parking was a little high, but the place is well worth it in my opinion. ~ (Parking fees are clearly stated on the website so I don't know why people on here complain about not having prior knowledge of it. Any hotel is not resposible to post all fees with "neon" signs. Potential guests need to take resonsibility and be proactive in ASKING about fees and/or looking for a fee chart)~

<Title>“Best place I've ever stayed at.”
<Content>We stayed in the main part of the hotel. We left on a cruise the following day. We had the most fun here. There was 11 of us. We stayed on the fourth floor and I booked the rooms through priceline one month prior to trip. I got them for $75.00 per night per room. The staff was great, food overpriced, but they did offer parking while we were on the cruise for $10.00 per night. I would stay here again and again.

<Title>“this hotel was horrible”
<Content>Okay, maybe not the absolute worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I stayed there because my conference was in the hotel. I didn't see any cockroaches. There was no green water coming from the faucet. It has an excellent view of the harbor. And it is very close to the airport. But this hotel was not good at all. First off, the bed was lumpy, which made it hard to sleep. Also problematic for sleeping was that the walls were so thin you could hear anything and everything going on in neighboring rooms, even coughs. This hotel really needs to invest in some soundproofing. The hotel is not within walking distance of anything. You need to take a cab to get anywhere. It wouldn't be so bad if the restaurants in the hotel were really good...they are not horrible but not places I would want to eat every meal for five days. There was a sound akin to that of crickets in the vent. I called the reception to get them to fix it, they said they would come, but never did. I called again and still no action, then gave up.We had to call the reception to get the bathtub unclogged. They did eventually come and got it cleared but the drain was still pretty slow and got worse as the week went on. About half the times we called the reception there was no answer. The concierge was not that helpful. I stayed in the hyatt near the convention center during an earlier conference and oh how I longed to have been staying there as our taxi passed it on our way to restaurants. Anyway, I would suggest staying somewhere else. This is a pricey hotel and from what I gather, you are paying for a nice view and little else.

<Title>“Don't pay full price, and try for the club room.”
<Content>I was here for a conference but found a cheaper rate on expedia for the club room. The breakfast includes hot/cold cereal, fruit, toast, bagels, juice, coffee, pastries. And there is an evening reception which includes veggie platters, fruit, crackers with dips, cookies, free soft drinks, cheeses, and 2 choices of hot appetizers (pot stickers, chicken nuggets, mini sausage rolls etc). Also there is free wireless in the clubroom and a computer with free printer. My hotel room was on the small side so the clubroom was nice to escape to. Downsides of this hotel are: not many close dining options, very few TV channels, small rooms, and not worth paying full price for. I would say this hotel should more accurately be rated a 3* so if you come expecting (and paying) more, you might be disappointed. I have stayed in Fairmont and Pan Pacific properties that have the little details which are worth paying more, but this Sheraton is worth paying a 3* price.

<Title>“Good stay at Sheraton Hotel and Marina”
<Content>This was my second stay at the Sheraton, having once again won the room on Priceline with a 4* bid in the downtown area. I was extremely happy when I arrived at around 11 AM and was immediately given a room. While I was in the Bay Tower last time, this time I was placed in the Marina tower. I was placed in a corner room on the 12th floor. I found this room to be a little smaller than the Bay Tower room, but perhaps a little better appointed. The shower and sink were quite nice. This tower also had much nicer grounds with a nice pool and spa area. The restaurants on premises were, as usual, pricey though had a good view. The on-premises Starbucks was a nice breakfast option if you didn't want to pay for the highly priced buffet breakfast. This hotel also offered some nice services. They have a free airport shuttle that runs on a constant loop about every 20-30 minutes. You can call for the shuttle, but I think it will just show up ... funny thing ... if you do call and select the option for the shuttle in the phone system, it will kick you back to the menu. There is a Microsoft center in the lobby offering free wi-fi and a few free computer terminals with printers. There is a charge for internet in room. The biggest negative for this hotel is probably its location if you want to do anything downtown. I saw a trolley stop, so that may be an option, or you could also take about a $10-15 cab ride downtown.

As for the facility and the room it's about what you expect from the Sheraton brand. I'd stay there again.

<Title>“Drive on by and stay at the Hilton down the road!”
<Content>Great views from the upgraded rooms. Garden views are of the airport rental car lots. Lovely facility. Problem is that they want your money! It costs $22.00 to park you car everynight and then you get to walk a half a mile to get to it. There are 10 channels on the TV and nothing you want to watch. Of course the bars are open ready to accept your money. We stayed 2 nights at $130 (+22.00 FOR PARKING). When we asked to add another night, we were told that it was $299.00 and there were plenty of rooms available. Staff recommended that we check Expedia for a cheaper rate. We checked out and went to the Hilton right down the road. Rooms and Beds way more comfy there. Same views and much nicer staff. Try the Hilton first!

<Title>“Nice view, very close to the airport, spacious rooms, great breakfast”
<Content>The hotel was chosen because my wife was attending a conference there, with activities during 4 consecutive days. It is located just a few minutes from the airport and the hotel has an eficient shuttle service every 10-15 minutes to and from the airport. Rooms at Bay Tower are kind of 30% bigger than those at Marina Tower. We had 2 double beds. Great breakfast. No free internet in rooms, just in lobby. The shuttle can take you to the airport where there is a bus line to downtown reached in 10 minutes. Beautiful ambience. Nice decoration. Spacious. Some noise from helicopters of a Navy base at the other side of the bay.

<Title>“Save an hour of your life, take a cab... not the shuttle!”
<Content>I stayed here recently for one night. The hotel advertised a free shuttle bus to/from the airport. I assumed that the shuttle would constantly be coming around and after 30 minutes of waiting.... I called. The lady on the phone said the shuttle would be there in 8 minutes. 28 minutes later, the shuttle arrived. Not being familiar with the area, I didn't realize that the hotel is practically across the street from the airport. A little too far to walk with luggage, but a cab couldn't cost more than 5.00. If I had to do it again, I would spend the 5 bucks and get an hour of my life back. I try to stay loyal to the Starwood properties and usually am upgraded as I've been a Platinum member for a few years now. No luck here... My room was about as standard as it gets.... although at check in It was noted I was "upgraded to a higher floor"... WTF? The room itself was "average" . Clean and what you would expect from a Sheraton. The room had a very nice flat screen TV, but despite being HD capable, none of my channels were in HD. Kind of a waste. My trip was very short... One day and I spent most of my time away from the hotel. I noticed a bar/pub type place that seemed popular and a very cool salt water fish tank that was HUGE in the lobby. In all, my stay was what I would expect. Nothing special and earns the "a-OK" rating from me

The service at the restarurants was generally very good and most of our waiters we very good with our 4 year old daughter. We were there for Thanksgiving and the Thanksgiving lunch/dinner was excellent. We loved San Diego it's beautiful.

<Title>“Do not stay here”
<Content>I stayed for two nights at this motel and experienced terrible service, especially for a very expensive motel. The worst part was that we left a package to be shipped FedEx over-night back to us at the front desk. I have done this many times before at other motels without incident. The day after we arrived back from our trip we expected to receive our package but did not and could not find any indication it had been shipped by the motel. I called to find out if the Sheraton had shipped the package and they said they did not know if they still had the package (!60 lds and large) and the Sheraton claimed they could not find out if they still had it or not. I did get a call back hours later but they just said they could not find the package and to wait until tomorrow. We needed this package quickly which was why we shipped it over-night. I also expect a motel to be able to check and see if they have or do not have a large package. I am still waiting to see if we get our package back.

<Title>“Worst customer service ever experienced at a Starwoods Resort”
<Content>Upon check in we were told we could've upgraded our room for $20 on-line, but at the counter it is $25 and then the next front desk told us $50 - sounded like a scam. We decided to eat at the restaurant and stood at the counter forever - wait staff all tried very hard NOT to make eye contact so they were not "stuck" helping us out. We ended up checking out early and booking a new hotel. Upon check out we again waited while the bell boy finished chatting with a friend to flag us a cab. When cab arrived, no help with bags and he went back to visiting with his friend. A lot of work to do at this hotel to bring customer service level up to the Starwoods standards they are known for.

<Title>“NICE BAY VIEW”
<Content>I booked it from Expedia for 100 something a day. I didn't know there's actually two hotel one is the Bay tower and the other one is the Marina Tower. We end up in the Bay tower. The room is big with sofa and a little desk table. the bed is really soft but the washroom is a bit small and not that clean. No fridge just a mini bar and it has a sensor on it...don't even open it. We're in the 11th floor and from our balcony we could see the fantastic view of the Marina and Downtown. It was nice after few months of winter in Canada. Transportation: we didn't even rent a car. On the first day we just hop on the trolley come in around 8:52AM and 9:52AM and this will bring you to the Seaport Village. You can also walk but its about an hour to the seaport village. Cab is about $15 one way including tip or a bus Route 992 I believe takes you to downtown. FOOD: we didn't eat in the restaurant, we eat in a small deli located between the two tower it's called papananni's I believe. or we just eat in the Seaport village. You can buy drinks in the delli as well. There's some drinks at the gift shop as well at the main lobby of the hotel. over all it was a great city and we will come back again.

<Title>“Good place to just sleep. Close to airport.”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina with a friend. The rooms were clean, and the bed and pillows were super comfy! Slept well the 3 nights I was there. The fitness center is nicely equipped, but the location was kind of weird to me- had to go outside and walk under the foundations of the hotel to get to it. I found it kind of creepy and scary when I had to go there by myself one night to get to the lone vending machine (which is next to the fitness center.) The rooms have complimentary Starbucks coffee. They also have a mini-bar/refrigerator in room which is on sensors and costs an arm and a leg, so don't even open it up!! (And don't move anything inside it, or you will be charged.) There were no vending machines around to purchase drinks, so you are stuck drinking water from the bathroom sink, or paying for a drink out of the mini-bar or one of the restaurants. (Hint- the fitness center does have a filtered water dispenser, so take an empty water bottle with you, and fill up in there. Run on the super nice treadmills for a few minutes if you don't want to feel like you are stealing! LOL) Showers were warm and felt great. There is supposedly a "spa" in the fitness center. Didn't see it. Think maybe it is just a room where they do facials ($95 for one hour) and massages with appointments. Location-wise: it was very close to the airport, and there is a shuttle that runs from the airport to hotel (and back) every 15 minutes or so. My friend and I were on a tight budget, so we thought we could walk most places from the hotel (the Gaslamp District, Balboa Park, etc are about 3 miiles away), but that's simply not feasible. Luckily, cabs are waiting for you at the hotel, and most downtown locations are within a $10 cab ride. Make sure you take the number of the cab company and a cell phone with you, though, because you can't just hail a cab when you are ready to return to the hotel, since they don't patrol the streets just looking for their next fare. You'll just need to call them, and they'll send out their next available ride to pick you up. The fare starts when you get in the car (not when you call.) Be sure to ask the concerierge where the closest X is before you just get in the cab and go. My friend and I wanted to go to IHOP for breakfast one morning, so we just jumped in the cab without researching the location. $20 cab fare later, we showed up at IHOP. Which, of course meant that we had to pay another $20 to get back. Most expensive IHOP pancakes I ever had! :) We would have been better off ordering room service and paying the $16 for 3 pancakes. I would really recommend renting a car and traveling up to La Jolla to visit Torrey Pines and the coves and beaches there. You can do a 12 hour car rental if you don't want to pay the $22 overnight parking fee. I'm starting to digress here, so let me just summarize with this: If you are looking for a clean comfy place to just sleep and take showers, this is a great hotel. If you are one who likes to use up everything that a hotel has to offer, this will probably end up being a very expensive vacation for you. Either way, it's in beautiful San Diego, and that's all that matters!!!!! Have a great trip~

<Title>“Stay Away! Highway Robbery!”
<Content>TRAVELLERS BEWARE! This hotel will charge you for absolutely everything. Parking is $22/Day. Internet is $20/Day. A rollaway bed is $20/Day. This hotel charges absurd amounts of money for what other hotels provide for free. Sign on hotel entry doors state "that the area, meaning the hotel, has cancer causing chemicals with some California State law number. .Absolutely true! I WILL NEVER EVER STAY HERE AGAIN! Do yourself a favour and don't waste your money.

<Title>“Great Hotel and Location Don't expect SVO or Gold member perks”
<Content>Stayed one night for a memorial service at Point Loma. Hotel was great and location awesome. Room was clean and comfortable. Only complaint was asked for a late checkout and was told 2:00 pm anything after that would be $10 per hour and I can't offer that either. What ? why even mention the $10 and I can't give you that? My buddy who isn't even an SPG member let alone an SVO owner or Gold member get's a 4:00 pm checkout and I'm offered a 2:00 pm checkout like they we're doing me a favor. Stored my gear in his room instead. Very disappointed in how they treated me as an SVO owner with Gold membership. If you go here don't expect anything different than the non SPG membership, let alone SVO owner would get. Not sure I'll be back based on that alone. Great hotel otherwise.

<Title>“Very average hotel by Sheraton standards”
<Content>It's hard to appreciate the qualities of the hotel when all you see is what they don't have. We arrived in San Diego in the late evening and decided to go downstairs to eat. Normally, there is a folder that has the hotel amenities to include the hotel restaurants. Not there. The next day, we went to Phil's BBQ (Very good), but I wanted to write down the address. Looked for a pad and pen that normally comes in the room. Not there. In the morning I went to take a shower and after I dried myself off, I looked for a towel hanger... not there. Service was very good though. The people were very helpful and made us feel welcome, it's just too bad there was so much to focus on what was missing.

<Title>“Near the airport, but otherwise inconvenient; extra charges abound....”
<Content>The hotel is clean and modern, but the location is very inconvenient for business in downtown San Diego. As others have noted, it is a good $15 cab ride away from anywhere. As seems typical for a Sheraton, nothing is included. Internet? $$$ (Nobody could give a reasonable explanation as to the difference between the basic and enhanced version!) Breakfast? $$$. Apart from that, they seem to take advantage of their captive audience by inflating the charges for everything on offer. For a quick stay before flying, sure, but otherwise there must be better choices around.

<Title>“Everything was great, until...”
<Content>We spent one night at the Sheraton at the marina in San Diego. We booked the room through Jet Blue vacations and got a lovely room with a great view at a great price. We enjoyed a delicious lunch at the 'casual' restaurant/bar where the service was attentive and the prices were comparable to our NYC area. Back to the room to relax and turn in early--we were headed for the border and a Baja adventure early the next morning. I turned down the bed and was quite distressed to see a BLOOD STAIN on the white sheet. Not terribly large, but quite noticeable, about the size of a dime. I called the desk to request that the bed be re-made, and a housekeeper arrived a while later--with a new sheet. When I asked her how this could possibly happen, she suggested that the morning housekeeper may have cut herself and bled on the sheets. When we requested that the ENTIRE bed be re-made, she provided us with new pillowcases as well. Absolutely no attention was paid to the blanket, mattress cover or the duvet. When we again asked for the entire bed to be attended to, she muttered something about the hotel's policy to save water; and then, when pressed for details, seemingly forgot how to speak English. We were too tired to request another room, had only a few hours before our early morning departure, so I thought that a Trip Advisor review would be more effective than just complaining to the management. This is the second Sheraton "adventure" we have had in the last few years. It will be the LAST.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel with most comfy beds”
<Content>My husband and I took a quick get away to San Diego for my birthday and got a great deal on Priceline for this hotel ($79 per night). We stayed two nights. Check in was a little slow, only one gal working the desk, and she said we were in the far away building but I asked to be in the Marina tower and she accommodated me (I did mention I was a Starwood member but not sure if that helped). Our room had two doubles but that was why we got the $79 price but it was ok. The beds were extremely comfortable. I'm not sure about everyone complaining about the noise and weight of the comforters but I was very comfortable and warm (but not too warm). Our room had a balcony that overlooked the marina and pool. There was plenty of storage in the room for clothes between drawers and the closet. There was a work desk with data ports for working but we set up a bar on the table. The room was a tad tight with the beds and furniture but was very doable for just two in the room. The bathroom was of good size and had a large vanity. The shower had good pressure and plenty of hot water. The amenities were nice. We ate breakfast in the restaurant and it was expensive and the service was very slow and the food was warm. Next time I might eat breakfast elsewhere. We almost had dinner in the sports bar but it was just too expensive for foo-foo-ish bar food so we took the car out of parking and drove to downtown to eat. Self parking was $22 per day, ouch. And being on Shelter Island, you pretty much had to drive everywhere else to eat or have drinks if you didn't want to pay the prices at the hotel. Internet in your room was like $14 or you could go down to the lobby for free wifi or use their business center. We did not use the pool or fitness center. We did take a taxi downtown one night and that cost was about $18 after tip. I really like this hotel but it's too far from downtown. It's really close to the airport, though. If I needed an airport hotel I'd certainly stay here. But next time I think we'll stay downtown.

<Title>“Convienent But Not Impressive”
<Content>Spent 5-days at the Sheraton for a combination trade show and time off with wife. Found the hotel for a good rate. Not disappointed but nothing exceptional. The hotel is right across from the airport. It is on a little island that is mainly marinas and though very close to lots of airport activity, you get a great sense of being away from the hustle and noise. You can see water regardless of where your room is. Our room looked out "front" from the older tower (there are two actual hotels in the complex). On the 3rd floor and we looked right across a small bay at the end of Coronado Island and the Navy facilities. Very pretty and relaxing. We had a small balcony and spent several nights enjoying a cocktail before bed looking out over the water. The area was very good for long walks along the water with great paved trails and landscaping. Great for walking and running. We walked to several local restaurants on the island and always felt invigorated. the rooms are in big need of renovation. We were in the older tower and you could tell. From what I understand the newer tower had just gone through a renovation and the older tower was next. Could not be soon enough. The room was loud and 70's throughout. The bathroom was dingy and needed updating badly. Housekeeping was very good and not saying the rooms were dirty - just older. The location deserves a little better hotel. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Location is great for any business near the airport or downtown. I had a convention and was within a 15-minute cab ride of the conventions center and the awesome old district downtown. If you can get a cheap rate, this is not a bad place. If you are looking for more upscale, keep searching.

<Title>“Nice Views, Nice People, Absurd Fees, Poor Value”
<Content>If you're looking for a value, don't come here. I booked a room at about $165.00 a night, thinking that was a decent rate for the area. However, once I got here, I was getting soaked left and right in absurd fees. Some good examples are $22/day for parking, and for breakfast, your only option is one downstairs restaurant with a lovely $17 egg dish!! On top of all that, I had to pay $18/day for high speed internet! In this economy and competitive market, I find it ridiculous to go to a hotel and have to pay this for web access. The views are very nice, but the location is basically right on top of the airport, so be prepared to listen to take offs and landings on a regular basis. And if you don't have a car, there is really no way to walk to an affordable local restaurant or store. On the plus side, all of the staff here were very very nice and friendly. My views of the harbor were great, and there are some good walking/running paths around the hotel and harbor. The room seemed to be renovated and updated, and was clean and comfortable. If this location can get with the year 2009+ and offer a nice breakfast buffet, free internet, and free parking, I would probably stay here again. Right now, no way.

<Title>“Great Views and Fabulous Stay for our Anniversary”
<Content>We got this hotel from Hotwire. After the name was revealed, I came to Trip Advisor, read the reviews and thought my anniversary trip was doomed. Of course, since I could not cancel it, we went and our experience was GREAT! We stayed in the Marina tower and the 8th floor. Our check-in was great! The customer service was excellent. The woman that checked us in told us upfront about the parking fees. She gave us alternative ways and costs to travel, let us check in at 11:00 am, and gave us a room with a great view! The concierge was fantastic. She suggested a great place for us to have lunch outside the hotel. The hotel was clean, beautiful, and quiet. We travel almost every weekend on business, so we know great hotel service. I was very pleased with the Sheraton. They treated us like we paid full price on the top level. I look foward to going back again.

<Title>“Horrible Customer Service & Price Gouging”
<Content>Stay clear of this dump if you want to be ripped off with horrible customer service. We stayed on Xmas Eve and were hit with a $22 parking fee, even as a guest at the hotel. The hotel is next to a noisy airport so I guess they think all their guests are business travelers who don't care about parking fees since their company will pick up the tab? But we were just regular tourists. So I walk in the room and find an open can of Diet Pepsi inside the mini frig. I called the front desk so I wouldn't be charged and she asked "did you move ANYTHING in the frig?" I said, "Yes, I moved some stuff around to fit in our own snacks from home". And she said we'd be charged for everything that was touched, because it's all sensored. WTF? She insisted with her snotty "tough luck--you will be charged--nothing I can do" attitude until I asked to speak to a manager. The manager said they would waive the mini bar charges. Well gee thanks... A week later, when we checked our credit card, it was all screwed up with charges that weren't removed from the mini bar and charging us twice for parking @ $22 a night (when we were only there 1 night). It took 4 phone calls to correct our bill. Idiots! Another issue was the loud rumbling noise from the airport, not to mention their heaters in the room. It sounded like a freight train. Oh, and breakfast...Their menu prices are outrageous! Two (2) lousy pancakes are $15 bucks!, and that doesn't include anything-no egg, no bacon, no juice--just 2 pancakes. We have traveled the world and stayed at some beautiful high class places, but this hotel truly was the pits. I would never, in a million years, go back. The employees were so rude--maybe they were all pissed off that they had to work on Xmas?

<Title>“Not a 4 Star Hotel....at least the Bay Tower where Priceline guest stay”
<Content>I was pretty concerned about staying at this Hotel after reading reviews from other guest. I was a Priceline guest and was placed in the Bay Tower. The hotel staff offered me an upgrade to the Marina Tower or a higher floor in the Bay Tower for an additional fee which I declined. If you’re looking to be within walking distance to the downtown area or Gaslamp district, this is not going to be your best bet. The room was decent size and nicely decorated but this hotel is definitely not a 4 Star Hotel. I’ve never stayed in a 4 Star hotel that had carpet stains in the lobby and in the rooms. Maybe they should use their $22 per day parking fees and hire a carpet cleaner for the hotel. Overall this hotel did have a bed, bathroom, and working shower but definitely not a 4 Star hotel by any stretch of the imagination.

<Title>“Took the dog and all went smooth”
<Content>Great views , great service! I had my doubts about bringing our German Shepherd on her first hotel stay but I could not have asked for a more lovely experience. All the staff were flexible and kind. We stayed two nights and on night two , noisier people moved into the room next to us and I knew our dog might bark so they quickly moved us to a beautiful more remote room, not an upgrade but just as equally as nice a room as we had before. THe views are spectacular from the high floors. The beds are super comfy and the elevators were super fast unlike what I had read in others reviews. The food was great, better than I expected. It was a perfect stay and I will definetly be going back for more trips since my son lives nearby. I would recommend trying for the rooms on the upper floors if you appreciate the good views. The room we had facing west had a bit of jet fuel smell since the jets take off with their tails aimed right at the hotel sliders. The view was so nice though , shutting the door stopped the smell from coming in and subsequently all jet noise as well. The room facing East had no residual jet fuel smell. It was fun watching the jets take off and land. I would recommend this hotel to couples and couples with kids , people of all ages and people with friendly , well behaved dogs.

<Title>“Convenient to Airport but Not Much Else”
<Content>We booked this hotel a bit by accident, but got a pretty good rate. I reconfirmed directly with the hotel by email, requesting the main tower, ocean view. We did get main tower but view of downtown which was OK. Room was pretty standard with the Sheraton beds, which were a pleasure to sleep on. On 2 nights, the fire alarms went off in the middle of the night - with guests piling out into the parking lots. 25 minutes later we were allowed back in. Fire Dept. took 15-20 minutes to get there. Not so much as an i am sorry from hotel management. Some guests were demanding compensation. The hotel was busy with some Navy function going on and some conferences. We did not eat in the hotel but did stop for drinks in the lobby bar. What we like: the pool and hot tub which we used, a Starbucks on site but too busy with long lines so did not stop, convenience to airport. What we did not like: the parking lot for guests as we must be after thoughts for or the hotel as general visitor parking is same lot. We could not find a stall one night because the Navy guys took every space. Were paying $22.00 a day for??? The lot was gravel where we ended up parking. Overall the stay was OK but we would not stay here again. Other than proximity to the airport it is not convenient to anything and is on the dead end peninsula from the airport. It is not 4 stars no way but is a solid 3.

<Title>“If you are attending a conference here - stay somewhere else!”
<Content>Overpriced rooms in horrible locations for conference guests and poor customer service. Showed no consideration towards me as a lone female business traveller. Paid conference rate (only $10 less than rack rate) and dumped in a ground floor room looking out onto the parking lot with the taxi rank directly outside my window. Asked to move rooms (based on my safety concerns) and was told there were no other rooms available even though there were plenty still advertised online. After much discussion got moved to another room (still ground floor) but at least this time without the taxi rank infront of the window. Requested breakfast to be delivered to my room, waiter refused to leave it outside the door as I had to sign for it, no bathrobes are provided in the room so had to answer the door in my pyjamas. Am glad I hadn't already got into the shower before he came as there would be no way i'd open that door in just a towel. Placed a do not disturb sign on my door, and was awoken by a phone call at 9am from the cleaner asking what time I was planning on leaving so that she could clean my room. The next morning she just walked into my room without even knocking, luckily I was already dressed.

<Title>“Wonderful Weekend”
<Content>I found this hotel through Travelzoo and booked it through Starwood which I think is the parent company. I got a great deal and was able to pick the Marina tower on a high floor. I read the reviews and I was worried that I wouldn't get what I had booked but that was not the case. The person checking us in was very friendly and helpful! We got a room on the 11th floor facing the marina and bay. It was beautiful! The room was very well appointed and appeared to be recently re-decorated. Some of the reviews had mentioned that they heard the airport noise and people above and below but we did not find this to be the case at all. It was very quiet. We stayed the weekend before Thanksgiving and I had asked how full the hotel was and the desk person said it wasn't full. We had a wonderful time and enjoyed going for a jog along the bay in the morning. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and would definitely suggest the marina tower.

<Content>Stayed there again last September for a conference. I was given a room in the Bay Tower this time, and was a little worried because of some not-so-good reviews. My room on the seventh floor was large, clean and had a great view of the Bay. I had large palm trees swaying back and forth right off my balcony, which made it a little more serene. Although I had to walk to and from the main hotel where the conference was taking place, I enjoyed the surroundings and peacefullness.

<Title>“Clean but noisy and shifty”
<Content>I stayed with my friend and toddler over Thanksgiving weekend. We were lucky to get a room in the newly renovated building. The room was clean and the view of the marina was nice. This hotel is very large and on this weekend was playing host to a lot of soccer teams. Kids were running up and down the halls until late at night. Apparently this hotel also allows them to stay in rooms without adults as we had the pleasure of rooming next to a few of them. When asked if they could keep it down we got knocks on our door with the subsequent sound of feet running away a few times. To get to our room we had to walk by the hot tub which, though large, was packed with teenagers every night. We didn't care to use it but if you do this may be important. My biggest concern was that upon my return home I discovered missing clothes from my luggage. Clothes that were packed in my suitcase the day before checkout but prior to the last room cleaning. I did not think to look through my luggage again on checkout day. The hotel couldn't do anything for me when contacted by phone and they did not respond to an email. I understand locking up your valuables when you travel but if a traveler has to worry about their clothes a hotel has a serious problem with its staff. Also, there is a $22/day parking fee. They do tell you this up front but in case you weren't paying attention to the details. All in all, no matter how clean the rooms are or how nice the view is (and that is not guaranteed) the stress of wondering when the kids are going to quiet down is just not worth it. And certainly not at the added cost of missing luggage.

The change to the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina helped to make our make our vacation a very enjoyable experience. We had a room with a bay view and with the great weather during our stay just great. To be able to see all the ships coming in and out was a new experience for us. Our friends that traveled with us just kept thanking me for making the change. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and made sure we had all we needed. Thanks again, we had a great time.

<Content>The front desk clerk had an attitude. The valet was condescending and dismissive when I asked him when my car was going to be parked. It was just sitting there and was almost scratched by a big SUV. This occurred at the bay tower. The room had an excellent view of the bay but there is no insulation between floors and walls. You hear EVERYTHING from the people above and the neighbors next to you. This is not a place you would stay on vacation. It's convenient if you have a business event because you are minutes from the hotel. The sofa was dirty and stained.

<Title>“Great front desk staff. Great Location. Great View. Great Value.”
<Content>It's a little far from San Diego downtown, but the views (especially if you can swing a Bay View room) are gorgeous. We preferred staying at the Bay Tower instead of the Marina Tower because it gave us a small hotel feel. The Marina Tower is good if you want ambience for business meetings. Nice, clean, comfortable rooms and a super friendly staff made our stay great. Highly recommended. The one reason to take away any points is the over-priced parking. Sheraton needs to reconsider this unreasonable surcharge.

<Title>“Good value for money”
<Content>All in all a good value for money hotel. We had been travelling for 15 hours straight, so it very nice to know that the hotel was only minutes away. The downside is that you can hear aircrafts taking off from around 6:30am until late in the evening - but I do not think that there are many places in San Diego where you are unable to hear the aircrafts. That aside, the location is actually fantastic. ½ hour stroll and you are in town. Excellent walking or running along the front of Harbor Island. Not too many other amenities, a couple of restaurants, hotels and some small shops. The hotel itself (Marina) was very nice. The room was an adequate size for the family. The extractor fan in the bathroom could be made a bit quieter though. Good amenities. Excellent room service meals. Good restaurant and even a Starbucks (if you like that sort of thing). Staff were very helpful. Swimming pool was a bit cold for my liking, but the jaccuzi made up for that.

<Content>Stayed two nites in Marina Towers (there are two at this property) which had been updated recently. I was leading a two-day conference at the hotel. The rooms are nicely updated. Comfortable bedding, adequate counter space in bath, big shower head in bath (no makeup mirror) and flatscreen TV. Starbucks in the lobby a bonus. Conference room for 25 people had no windows and was dated--not that clean--I had to ask them to vacuum the room. However all request were promptly addressed. The conference breakfast and lunch buffets were very good--fresh food, good choices, good presentation. Great conference staff. Hotel Bar--one dinner--the service on the food was very slow and the food was basically marginal grill fare. Minutes from the airport--would recommend for that reason.

<Title>“Sheraton Marina needs to learn the meaning of customer service!”
<Content>My husband and I went to the Sheraton Marina to celebrate our anniversary. When making our reservation, I was told we could check-in as early as noon since the hotel was not full. We arrived at 3:00pm (1 hour before check-in time) and were told that our room was not quite ready yet. At 4:00 I went back to the desk to remind them we were waiting and they again said our room was not quite ready, but we could switch to a room with 2 smaller beds if we wanted. We finally were given the keys to our room at 5:00 after spending 2 hours waiting in and around the lobby! I wished they could have told us the room wouldn't be ready for 2 hours when we first arrived, and we would have left to do something fun. The next morning, I called the front desk to ask for a late check-out and was told that they could not do that. I reminded them that they kept us waiting when we checked in, and they said we could stay 30 minutes longer. I was very surprised that they didn't even give us coupons for a free drink at the bar to make up for our inconvenience. If they gave us a coupon for free breakfast, I would have been completely satisfied, and I wouldn't be writing this! Other than that, the room was nothing special, except that we had an amazing view of the nightly fireworks at Sea World. The breakfast buffet was delicious, but expensive. San Diego has so many lovely hotels that I don't know how the Sheraton will stay in business if they treat their customers this way!

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel, Very nice but $$$ Parking”
<Content>landed a room here for 2 nights from Priceline for $75/night...place was really nice, and i loved having the Starbucks inside...good news we were put on a high floor, with a Marina view but bad news is we got stuck w/ 2 double beds...of course that's to be expected when booking through Priceline, but my wife and I got over it. It was way nice for the price, so no complaints there. The rooms were very nice, but the room we had was somewhat small. Maybe if it was a king bed it would've felt roomier, but compared to our previous hotel it was a bit tight, but not bad for the 2 nights we were there. The hotels in a very convenient spot to the airport, and is somewhat centralized with the beaches just a few short miles away, and the zoo/downtown about the same distance in the other direction. The beds were VERY comfortable I will say. Out of the 3 hotels we stayed at during the week of our vacation, the beds here were our favorite. I gave this hotel a 4 out of 5 stars because: The 3 biggest downfalls for us was the cost of parking, no free Wi-Fi in the room, & no fridge...for $22/day you'd think you'd get valet, but no valet is $28/day. It’s really pointless to pay for valet when the valet parking lot is right beside the standard lot. I know paying to park is pretty standard in SD, but $22/day is just getting up there. You'd think for that kinda money to park they'd at least give you free Wi-Fi in the rooms, but only place you're getting it is downstairs. For us, using Skype and talking to family on the webcam is quite pointless downstairs in front of everyone! Lol Far as having no fridge, well, you get the mini bar area in the room which costs $$$$ plus it's not even cold so. Not to mention if you DID get caught putting anything in there, they charge a $25 cleaning fee. When traveling I always like having a fridge, but I bought a cooler I brought with me just incase I ran into a room w/o one.

<Title>“Not for families with young children”
<Content>I was very disapointed in our stay at this hotel. We booked because of the 3 pools, one being a kids pool, and for the water taxi to Seaport Village. Come to find out upon check in that 2 of the 3 pools were closed and the water taxi didn't really pick up at thier hotel! They also had over half of thier elevators under construction, resulting in 10 minute wait to get to and from your room and there are no childrens TV channels offered(nickelodeon) unless you want to pay.

<Title>“Best french fries at Quinns!”
<Content>Stayed two nights here for the DEMO tech conference in September. Room was mid-sized (if size is a priority, try the Sheraton Suites Symphony Hall) but very comfortable. The wired Internet cost $12 a nite and was on the slow side (maybe I'm spoiled with Verizon FIOs at home), which did impede my work. Amenities were great. Each of the two towers has its own, huge gym (very modern equipment) and pool. I had a burger and fries at the bar, Quinns, and I must say they were very good, esp. the fries (fat, creamy, semi-skinned wedges with just the right amount of seasoning). Location is pretty - right on the water near the airport and rental car places - and great if you want to spend a dirty weekend with a sig other and only occasionally emerge to take leisurely walks along the water. You do need to cab into downtown for a broad food selection, though.

<Title>“Very nice and convenient”
<Content>My colleague and I enjoyed our 4-night stay here. Right next to the airport, free shuttle, but no noises. We had very good view of the bay, airport and downtown. Coming from Boston, a walking city, San Diego is even better. Seaport village was great walk enjoying the Midway, artworks, marinas with expensive yatches, shopes and very good, romatic seafood restaurant. We walked the gaslamp quarter with restored architecture of the old buildings, restaurant-lined 4th, 5th & 6th streets sining while people watching. All these for $10 & $15 cab rides from the hotel. Sea world is also $15 cab ride away. Don't do the zoo, we were disappointed. We thought San Diego is whole lot better than LA, San Fran or Sacromento. The hotel Quinn sport restaurant served very good foods. I liked very much the Pacific seafood chowder, baby back ribs and grilled salmon. We were filled at full buffet breafast. Per the rating above, we had problems with the waiter at the Harbor edge restaurant for buffet breakfast. The man had attitude as if we shouldn't be eating any food at all. He acted as if he did not want to serve OJ and coffee. He served as he attempting to kick us out. It's a $21 breakfast buffet after all, not $5. We enjoyed the meal but did not come back for second breakfast.

<Title>“I was checked in someone else's room by mistake and entered while they were there.”
<Content>After entering an already occupied room with my children (that were worried entire trip if this would happen to us) we had to go down with the ONLY working elevator in that wing of the Marina Tower that took about 15-20 minutes. This time we were given another room. When we went up our key didn't work. While we were going down on the elevator we saw our luggages going down too. The bell boy said it's because he was given yet another wrong room number. After spending over an hour of going up and down finally we settled. The room was nice with a great view. However we were so tired of all this that basically we couldn't do much that day. Now I wouldn't be so upset if they offered something to make up for it however no such gesture was made. They did not even apologized properly. We stayed there numerous times for the convenience of water sports and the view. If I was managing this hotel I would do everything to make up for this sort of inconvenience, So great hotel with not very polite staff. Parking is very expensive. Also for a pet friendly hotel it is strange that she was not allowed at the very casual patio style restaurant by the pool. Because of this we could never dine with entire family. By the way the food was so bad (curry chicken) that I got sick to my stomach. At another trip my husband ended up having the same result with anothert dish. It was surprisingly quiet since it was by the Airport. However since our room was at the end of one wing. We either had to walk a long way to get the main elevators or wait for the only working elevator at our wing that wasted a good chunk of our trip.

<Title>“Enjoyable stay with great views”
<Content>We recently spent three nights at the Sheraton with a room in the Bay Tower. After reading the previous reviews, I had hoped for the Marina Tower, but we had a great rate per night and ended up in the Bay Tower. The shuttle at the airport was prompt, and check-in was a breeze. We were upgraded to a room on the 9th floor in the Bay Tower and the views were great. We actually enjoyed staying in the Bay Tower because it was very quiet, even though we spent a lot of time over at the Marina. We never even saw the pool at the Bay Tower. The fitness center at the Marina is great and the pool is a nice size. There is food service poolside, and our waiter was very good. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, but went to Papanani's every morning next to the marina and enjoyed the views and a good breakfast. We really enjoyed our stay, and there were only a couple of problems. Sheraton needs to change their comforters. They are so HEAVY. It reminded me of a visit to the dentist when they put the lead apron over you before they take x-rays. I can't believe Sheraton has not addressed this. Also, there was a lot of dirt on the decking around the pool. Other than that, we had a very nice time . We would definitely stay here again with a good rate.

<Title>“Okay for couples but not families....”
<Content>The hotel was okay but not as great as some of the reviews I've read. First of all, no kids cable channels(Cartoon network, Nickelodeon, Disney) available which made the evenings a little boring for the little ones. Fortunately, we had a room on the seventh floor with a great view of the harbor and the swimming pool. The swimming pool is very nice and the pool area is relaxing. The food in the pool area is surprisingly good but a bit pricey. But hey, you're on vacation. Also, there wasn't an arcade room which my kids keep asking for. Again, not much for kids to do. The complaint I keep seeing is the Parking. Yes, it is expensive with $22/day for self parking or $28/day valet parking. I opted for the valet parking for the duration of my stay (5 Nights). I soon found out that the valet parking was costing me much more than $28/day with the constant and expected tipping whenever you need your car. If you wanna save, don't go this route since the self parking is a very short walk to the entrance. Overall, the hotel was okay. Didn't expect it to be so close (practically next door) to the airport. I would not stay here again when I cime back to San Diego.

<Title>“Do not stay in this terrible hotel!!!”
<Content>This hotel experience was absolutely terrible. We were staying in the Marina tower for a wedding at the hotel. Upon arrival we were put on the fourth floor, which is fine, however the room window faced a brick wall with very limited light and no view - this is fine for a business trip, but not for a vacation at a hotel that brands itself as a "hotel and marina". This was also the only room in the hotel with this view. I went down the the lobby to request a room change and the hotel staff said they would not change it. I asked to speak with a manager and the front desk manager, Lynne, told me that it is against their policy to change people's rooms regardless of reason. I was not asking for a better room, nor was I asking for a higher floor, simply another (equal) room on the same floor. She said that they had none available. That is fine, but there was no offer of another room on a different floor. I asked for the courtesy of being moved to a different floor and was told they would be happy to upgrade me at no fee however they had no king beds available on any other floor for the weekend. I found this hard to believe, so I came back again and asked if I could be upgraded to another room if I paid the difference - suddenly a room was available. This simply revealed a blatant lie by the hotel manager, Lynne, which I do not appreciate. When I pointed this out, she said that she could not accomidate me at the same rate. I very much wanted to enjoy my vacation so I agreed to pay the extra money to move, however when we went to the new room it smelled strongly of smoke (in a smoke free hotel). I asked to be moved again and was told no, and asked for it to be cleaned to get rid of the smell. They sent someone up, but it did not help and the smell did not go away all trip. Lastly, housekeeping did not come to make up the rooms until at least 5pm each day, which is when I called the desk and demanded someone be sent up to clean the room. As a person who spends more than 150 nights per year in hotels, the service and hospitality at this hotel is among the worst I have seen, and the hotel management, especially Lynne, is an embarrasment to the Starwood brand.

<Title>“Spectacular view”
<Content>Upon checked in, they gave us a traditional room wth a parking lot view even though we paid for a water view room through an online third party service. My spouse called CS then eventually went to the front desk & spoke with a manager. After an hour of "this & that," they transferred us to a different tower, and gave us a bigger room with a beautiful view of the bay & marina. We are very delighted. We don't have any complaint about the service since they brought our luggages to the new room, and the staff are friendly & helpful. The only set back was the parking which is $22.00 per night for self-parking & $28.00 for valet. And, also the beverages in the room were pricey, $5.00 for a small bottled water, and $7.00 for a bottle of Gatorade. My suggestion is bring your own beverages. And, most of all, spend a full day or two in Balboa Park. We will, for sure, next time we go back.

<Title>“No complaints - Enjoyed my stay”
<Content>We stayed here for 4 nights in August, and I have to say it's a nice hotel. Our room was on the 10th Floor in the Marina Tower overlooking the Bay/Marina/Pool. Every room has a balcony. The other side of the Marina Tower faces the parking lot/downtown. If you're not on a high floor you will not have any view at all. The other Tower was down the street, appeared to be a totally separate hotel and probably was at one time. I used the free internet in the lobby a few times as I forgot my laptop. It was tough to find a computer that wasn't occupied, they were only a few of them and they were busy pretty much all the time. But it was great they had computers for their guests, it was a nice touch. The location was good, but we were glad we had our car for the short drive to Gaslamp, Little Italy and other places downtown. Although this hotel is very close to the airport we hardly ever saw or heard any planes at all. I was pleasantly surprised and would stay at Sheraton again.

<Title>“Great way to end our summer”
<Content>We got a great rate for this hotel and stayed for 3 nights (August 9-12). We had a low floor room with a partial view of the pool. We initially started with a room facing the parking lot but after a quick stop at the desk, we were transferred on the other side with the pool view. The staff is friendly and corteous. Rooms were cleaned meticulously. Best thing about the hotel? starbucks in the lobby (for sleepless parents like us). We had a great time lounging around in the pool. They also have a great fitness facility with lots of activities for families. They rent out bikes, lend out ping pong rackets, a tennis court and everything you could possibly think of. I was able to use their spa service and had an excellent massage. They offer facials too and all services priced reasonably. Their spa is not really the type of spa that you go in to relax but it has more of the fitness club feel with showers and sauna. Hopefully they have a real spa lined up in the future. The only thing I could complain about is the Harbor's edge restaurant, for some reason, someone overlooked the fact that there are no ramps to get to the dining area. This restaurant is off of the main lobby of the hotel and only has steps to lead down to the tables. The hotel must have been aware of this oversite because all the staff are always kind enough to offer to lift the stroller for you. They also forgot to put down a ramp to access the main pool on the marina tower so you have to go around and take the elevator down. By the way, did i mention $22/day for parking? we didnt mind since it's like that pretty much anywhere in San Diego, for the rate that we got, it's still a deal. Other than that, it was a great stay and we will definitely be back.

<Title>“Can't Imagine Staying Here By Choice”
<Content>I used Priceline for two nights in San Diego at two different hotels. Got both for around $70, one at Hilton Gaslamp (which was GREAT) and one here. First, it has been noted in the reviews that they treat Priceline/Hotwire customers differently. I also found this to be true -- and I think it is a silly way to do business, since we are more likely (in my opinion) to go squawk about our experiences on the internet. But anyway... Yes, we were placed in the Bay Tower, which they called the West. We were on the fourth floor -- which was really the third -- and we overlooked the parking lot. Lovely. Yes, there was some water and city views beyond, but with the parking lot three floors below it is hard to enjoy. Tried to take a dip after check-in at 8:30 PM... all towels gone and the pool a bit murky. The room looked nice, but had a few issues. One, there was no information in the room about the hotel services, cost of internet, location of amenities -- nothing. We had to call to find out about all of these things. Do they charge for the coffee and tea? I still don't know. Though I do know that if you put personal items in the minifridge they will charge you a $25 cleaning fee. Really. Two, and I have not seen this mentioned here before, but the duvet, while attractive, weighed about two hundred pounds. The only way I can imagine sleeping with it would be if the room was ice cold --- which brings us to problem three. I set the air conditioner on the coldest possible setting and it was still relatively balmy in there. Could only sleep with a sheet, and it was very hard to sleep. Four, the toilets flush with incredible force, which is fine... but you also hear all the toilets flushing in all neighboring rooms. All night. Five, of course, the parking is a racket. The existence of this hotel would make me nervous to do Priceline for San Diego again. And finally, I didn't take it seriously, but the Bay Tower really is far, far away from the Marina tower. I think it is disingenuous for them to both be a part of the same hotel since they are so separate. It's misleading and, I think, borderline deceitful.

I can assure you!!! This is the Society's third San Diego meeting in the last twelve years, I doubt if the members will ever vote for THIS hotel again, my wife was terrified here on the 11th floor at 4 am. We are 75 and 76 years young and my wife could never make it down 11 flights of stairs, she is.afraid to go to sleep tonight on this 11th floor.

<Title>“Excellent hotel”
<Content>We spent only one night nut it was enough to say that it's a very nice hotel...The hall and the rooms are very elegant, although not roomy. Increible sightseeing, on one side there is the bay and on the other side the ocean. There is a nice outdoor swimming pool and internet point in the hall.The location is a good for the airport (walking distance) and the bay, but few miles away from San Diego city center. The price wasn't bad, 120 $ for a two double beds room. There is the possibility to park the car, but it's not cheap. It's a very nice hotel, which I'd recommend if not full price

<Title>“Excellent Experience after some Tweaking”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina for three weeknights in July. We had an awesome experience but only after we did some tweaking of our room location. We booked through Hotwire at a rate of $114 and upon arriving at the Marina Tower (there are two towers - the Marina and the Bay - around the corner from each other) the valet politely informed us we were in the Bay Tower. After reading the previous reviews we expected this as it appears the Bay Tower is used for their Hotwire and Priceline customers. We arrived in the beautiful Bay lobby and were informed our "standard" room was either on the first floor in the back of the tower facing the marina or on the second floor in the front of the tower which was level with the parking lot. We choose to look at the first floor room and found a very large, very clean room with floor to ceiling windows that didn't open, a walkway right outside the windows and a beautiful view of the marina. The second story room, although we didn't go into the room, had a balcony but looked right onto the parking lot and then the bay. We didn't like the idea of feeling trapped with windows that didn't open, the lack of privacy with a walkway just outside the windows or staring at cars so we asked for a room higher up. We were informed we were only entitled to a first or second story room and that we'd need to pay $20 a night (plus taxes) to move up. We decided to upgrade and asked to be moved to the Marina tower. The Bay Tower's rooms are large, the pool is very nice, and there's free wi-fi in the lobby, a breakfast room and a business center. The two towers are about a 5 minute walk around the marina and is quite lovely. Perhaps in bad weather it would not be so pleasant. The Bay Tower is a lot quieter if that's what you are looking for. The Marina Tower is where the action is. Our Marina Tower room was on the 9th floor overlooking the pool and the marina. FABULOUS! The small balcony was wonderful and when we closed the sliding doors we could barely hear the airplanes. The room was large (not quite as large as the Bay Tower), very clean, beautifully decorated, and with a good sized bathroom. We enjoyed Happy Hour and a beautiful sunset at the Shoreline Restaurant next to the pool, then dinner at Quinn's, the pub that overlooks the pool and marina. The pub had decent prices and good food and wasn't dark like you'd expect a pub to be. There were two billiard tables for their customers to use. There are two pools in the Marina tower, the main one which is large and next to the Shoreline and the other is smaller and quieter. There are hamocks to relax on and rocking chairs around a fire pit. Harbor Island is flat so it's great for walking and running. I rented a bike one morning ($7 an hour, 4th hour free) and totally enjoyed riding along the water to the Star of India, USS Midway and Seaport Village. I felt very safe as I never had to be on the road with the cars and it only took 25 minutes to get to Seaport Village. The $20 upgrade was well worth it as we loved our room and the view it offered. The elevators were slow, in fact two of the days one of the elevators was being working on but we didn't mind much. We enjoyed the free US Today newspapers and the Starbucks coffee and tea in the rooms. Parking is $22 a night but it seems to be the going rate in the downtown area. We've stayed at other downtown hotels and have paid that amount and more to park. If you don't have a car taxis are readily available (at least at the Marina Tower, I'm not sure about the Bay Tower). Being right next to the airport would be very handy if you have an early morning flight as the Sheraton has a free shuttle, doesn't feel like an airport hotel and yet you are so close. The only negative thing I can say about the Sheraton was how they initially made us feel since we booked with Hotwire. My husband and I have booked a number of hotels through Hotwire and never before have we been made to feel "cheap" or told " . . because you booked through Hotwire . . ." Our past experience is that if a hotel has available rooms it will upgrade us at no charge and there's never any mention of who we booked through. It appears that Sheraton sets aside the least desirable rooms for their "cheap" customers, in fact the entire first floor of the Marina tower had different lighting and lower ceilings than the other halls. I think the only windows that don't open are those on the first floor on the Bay Tower so that's why they are given to the Hotwire and Priceline customers. All in all, a great experience and we will come back.

<Title>“Very comfortable with GREAT views!”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego for five days in July as a quick summer get-a-way - I do love this hotel because of the location by the marina and it has more of a resort feel. Being close to the airport was no issue at all - I did't hear any planes! Some say it's too far out but it's only a $8 - $10 cab ride to downtown... we had a rental for a few days though too. Room very nice - clean, modern, bright colors and the bed comfortable. We had a room up very high up facing the marina and overlooking the pool. We enjoyed nice sunset while sipping a beverage on the patio. They have a fabulous pool and hot tub and the food was great at the restaurants. We found Quinns to be somewhat "cold" in feel and atmosphere but the other restaurant was great!!! Plus, they have a huge Starbucks on site. We enjoyed some delicous tapa's one night as well sitting a the lobby bar over wine. We enjoyed out stay and would definately recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Title>“Better than expected!”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews on here, I was skeptical. I was booked here for 8 days via work for a conference and it probably would not have been my first choice, that being said, if I was returning to San Diego and had a car rental I would certainly return here again. There are two towers, you want to be in the one with the main lobby and restaurants attached, the other is a short walk away, but still it is a walk. My room was actually in the Lanai wing wich is a 3 story area. I was skeptical of it based on the condition of the hallwyas which are open to the elements, but the room was wonderfully clean, nice bedding and pillows. Colleagues on the first level of the Lanai however reported a musty smell in their room and where nicely moved up to the 2nd floor which was fine. The "fancy" restaurant was a little overpriced, the pub, tapas bar, and outdoor pool bar all had decent food. You definitely need a car to stay here, even the other restaurants on Harbor island are a decent walk away. That being said, if you have a car it is easy access to Point Loma an downtown San Diego. You can get to the Gaslamp, Little Italy, Hillcrest, Convention Center, Harbor attractions and zoo with lots of ease. You can also hop on I-5 quite easily and get any place else you might need to go. There is a fee for parking, so be aware of that. The overall vibe of being right on the water is very nice, I chilled out on the hammocks, near the pool and even near the fire pits outside at night.

<Title>“Cant be beat for the Fourth of July!!”
<Content>Nice place, staff was cool. But as mentioned before here this is not a 4 star hotel. Three or 3.5 maybe. Dont get me wrong it was cool but not for the regular price. We got an $80 rate via priceline. If your there for the 4th of July it cant be beat, FRONT ROW SEATS! The pool was great. My biggest complaint was the out of this world parking fee of $22 per night. Prices for room service and the pub were pricey.

<Title>“Great Hotel on the Marina”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina and enjoyed my stay. I attended a conference in one of the two hotel towers. The rooms were comfortable and had a great view of the Marina and the pool area. The walk in the morning from the tower we stayed at to the one the conference was in was short and was along a beautiful walkway right by all the yachts. The only problem is that it was far from everything and would require a taxi. I took a taxi on one of the days and stoped by the pier to catch the double decker bus for a tour around town, that was fun and very informative!

<Title>“Nice Hotel but Not a Good Location for the Leisure Traveler”
<Content>Although we are San Diego locals, we'll occasionally spend a night downtown and play tourist. We use Priceline to save money and always get right downtown Gaslamp - until now. This time our bid "won" the Sheraton Harbor Island. For our purposes, it couldn't have been a worse location. Not only were we not within walking distance of anything but we had no public transportation options other than a taxi at $25-30 round trip to the Gaslamp. As an added pleasure the hotel charges a $22 to self park. A great example of going broke saving money. Having said that the hotel would be great for the business traveler who just needs an over night stay or has an early morning flight. We stayed in the Bay Tower and our room was clean and nicely updated. We had a harbor facing room which is also the side of the airport. I was concerned the flight noise would be a problem but it really wasn't. I will say though that the toilets flush with such force they could wake the dead! Upon checkin we attempted to get the Marina Tower as it is clearly the better tower in terms of things to do within the hotel but the Front Desk Clerk would have none of that. To her defense, they were full with a teacher's convention but she could have handled our request in a better manner. The Bay tower does have its own pool and fitness center both of which we took advantage. We hit the pool around 4:30pm - the pool attendent was gone as were all the pool towels. The fitness center was capable - the equipment was fairly new and there was enough variety to get in a decent cardio or weight workout. Would like to recognize the Valet attendent who took care of us when we were looking for cheaper parking options. We told him we were not going to park in the hotel and would move the car somewhere else after checkin. After getting settled, we went back down to get the car and he moved it to a free spot that opened up directly across the street. Nice Service!

<Title>“The good start to our too short 4th of July weekend”
<Content>The Sheraton Hotel & Marina exceeded my expectations. We arrived on a 12pm flight and I was worried we'd be waiting around until 3 or 4 to check-in. I had called ahead a couple days and spoke with Melissa. She informed me we could use the pool and enjoy the hotel while we waited if our room was not ready. We were allowed to change in the Spa area and let our kids swim a while. I rented a large blow-up alligator for an hour ($7) that was their highlight. . .we only had it an hour before I received a call on my cell phone that our room was ready (it was shortly after 1pm!) I was very happy for the early check-in and even more happy to find we'd been upgraded to a two-story townhouse room in the Lanai building. The pool rental place let us return the gator and said we could return later to use up the remain hour I had paid for. There were a few downsides. After swimming a bit we arrived to our room barefoot and found the floor was quite damp. I can only imagine it had recently been shampooed. The doors to the outside had about a 2" gap between the bottom and the floor, plenty of room for bugs and such to crawl in but we were lucky and had none. Then there were two balconies. . the wood in dire need of staining and new chairs (current ones were old and dirty). Other then that we enjoyed having the downstairs for out two six yr olds on the pull out couch with their own tv, and my husband and I upstairs in a comfortable king with our own tv. There were two bathrooms, one with a shower/bath, also a coffee maker up and downstairs, and a small fridge and sink. This came in handy when we purchased some grocery items & beverages from Papanani's Deli, located between the Marina and Bay Towers. I highly recommend stopping at the deil. . the hotel charges $6 per bottle of beer and at the deli you can purchase a six-pack for $9, along with tasty sandwiches, cereal, and many other items at a fair price. The kids LOVED the Marina tower pool and the entire family enjoyed the Club Lounge on the Penthouse floor. The lounge was beautifully decorated and a decent variety of snacks in the evening and helpful lounge attendant (wish I had gotten his name - very nice). The breakfast also served in the Lounge the next morning was nicely stocked and plenty of room/quiet while we enjoyed the start to our day. We only stayed one night here (the hotel was full the 3rd & 4th) and after checking out we headed for the US Grant for 2 nights and off to Sea World. All in all we would definitely return to the Sheraton. (hopefully to dry floors, updated balconies/lanai's, and new doors that closed securely).

<Title>“Great Trip”
<Content>My wife and 5 years old just completed a 3 night stay at this hotel. The room was perfect, overlooking the 4th of July fireworks. The service was beyond finer hotels we have stayed at. Everyone was calling me by name, which I think is nice and personal. Whoever is running this hotel is doing a great job and deserves Kudos’s. I can't wait to book another stay.

<Title>“Fine with a special rate - not convinced worth paying more”
<Content>I stayed a night in the Bay Tower, which seemed to be poor relation in terms of facilities, but was quite OK. I had a pre-paid rate of around $100 and would've been disappointed had I paid more or had had to pay for parking, a better view (mine was fine though, from 4th floor across the bay, from a wide balcony) and the other add-ons (see other reviews on this unsavoury aspect). The TV includes Showtime, but a very limited range of other cable channels (presumably to encourage guests to pay for their own movies etc). The room decor was superb - modern red-white-n-blue paintings; long sofa and expansive desk; footstools and coffee table. If anything, there was too much furniture in the room, but the bed positioned on a corner was definitely an interesting feature and helped give the room a different feel. A stray face-cloth from a previous guest and a faulty constantly-flashing message light on the phone [which the front desk tried but failed to correct, and then failed to follow-up with maintenance] were aspects that would have annoyed me had I been paying full rate, as would the absence of a Guest Services Guide (the tv-based version being unavailable). The ground floor pool was disappointing, failing to take advange of the hotel's position on the bay [it could've been anywhere in any city] and the pool area wasn't kept clean.

<Title>“Good but nothing special”
<Content>The location is convenient and the staff are nice enough. Note that parking is around $20 a day. The nautical decor is very clean an fresh and suites the destination well. A couple issues worth mentioning: there was an unpleasant smell in the hallways... Not sure if it's what they use to clean the carpets or something else. Also, there was only one elevator in operation for my wing of the hotel. It sometimes took 15 minutes to get down to the lobby do to this fact. The hot tub was not hot in the morning... Definitely less than 100F. I would stay again but only with a nice discount.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel - but not for per diem rates”
<Content>This hotel is a 10 minute walk from the airport and a Sheraton shuttle arrives every 15.' The room was apparently deluxe, and seemed standard for the chain. Really beautiful view. Nice bed, very clean room with great housekeeping. What soured the 7 day stay was being declined on access to SPG lounge for continental breakfast because we are gold and not a platinum members, and no upgrade without payment of 28,000 points in a 1/2 empty hotel. The restaurant continental breakfast was 17.95 each, and a single Mojito ( a common drink) was 10.89. No accessable fridge, as any personal food would be removed and a $25 service fee applied. So no milk and cereal. No lower priced food nearer then the airport. so, we used the hotel to sleep and enjoyed leisurely meals in the city.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel---- great location”
<Content>My husband and I went out to San Diego for a week for R&R before he started a new job. This hotel was excellent.. The rooms were very clean and service was exceptional . The staff from the Pool waiter (Rob) to the Breakfast omelet man(Horatio) where very friendly and helpful. The fire pit at night by the bay was very relaxing with a glass of wine. I used the fitness center three times and everything worked and was in excellent condition.We ended up touring every morning, it is only a 10 minute ride to the zoo, old town, mission and ocean beaches, gaslamp,and sea world. We also hiked at Torey pine state park and visited La Joella . One day we drove to the dessert and hiked Palm oasis canyon hike and hike at state park in the mountains where the Ceder fire was still very evident.. The hotel was so centrally located to everything. The only thing we didn't do was go to Mexico.. They said it was too dangerous there for Americans. I would highly recommend this hotel.. now it's back to work in Pittsburgh... It was JUNE GLUME in San Diego but we had a great time.

<Title>“Couldn't have had a better stay”
<Content>We visited the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for the second time (June 20 - 24) and stayed in one of the charming Junior Suites in the Bay Tower. We had a wonderful direct view of the bay and all rooms in this tower come with a balcony and view of either the bay or the Marina. We consistently found the rooms to be maintained well, kept clean, the staff polite, friendly and very accomodating to special requests. This was our wedding anniversary and the Management Staff made it a special event. Now, iff the weather had just been as nice as hotel, this would have been the perfect visit. Be prepared to pay for parking.

<Title>“Incredible Experience at the Sheraton San Diego!”
<Content>I was completely impressed with the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina! I felt like I was staying at an exotic resort, but in actuality I was a stone's throw from the hustle and bustle of downtown San Diego! The staff was friendly and hospitable. They also informed me the hotel just went through a $35 million dollar renovation, and I could DEFINITELY tell! Each room had a beautiful view and incredible mahogany furnishings. I would without a doubt recommend the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina to anyone traveling to SD!

<Title>“Nice place, near the airport”
<Content>Stayed here for 2 nights to end our California vacation. Staff was very friendly. I requested an early check-in, and also requested the Marina tower (thanks to tips from TripAdvisor). Both were granted immediately with no questions or hassles. The Marina tower is definitely the place to be ... restaurant and nicer pool are there, although I did hear others say the Bay tower rooms are larger. Our room was about what we expected ... very clean with a great view of the pool and Marina. The beds were a little smaller than what we're used to however. My kids loved the large pool and hottub ... the pool is much larger and nicer than I would normally expcect at a hotel. It was cool during our stay, so the outdoor heating kiosks in the pool area were also nice. The hotel is also very near the airport. I returned my rental car the night before we checked out. The airport car rental return is literally across the street ... I walked about a quarter mile back to the hotel. The only negatives to this place are the cost of parking ($22/night) and the prices at the restaurant. The breakfast buffet was $22 for adults and $10 for kids. The only other place to eat within walking distance is a small cafe between the towers next to the marina, and they only serve breakfast and lunch. Also, no frig or microwave in the room, so it's difficult to bring your own food. Overall, however, this was a very nice hotel.

<Title>“Great hotel with great price”
<Content>I stayed here recently for a week long conference at the Convention Center. I also brought along my 3 yr old son and a girlfriend. We all found this hotel to be perfectly suited to our needs. We were in the Lanai Tower, which I know many have criticized. We were more than pleased with it. Honestly, the ONLY drawback was the condition of the carpet outside in the halls...but come on, what do you expect when it's open to the elements? Our room had recently been re-done (it was evident) and it was immaculately clean--I'm a complete germaphobe, so this should carry some weight. We also had access to a separate pool and hot-tub, which we all used and enjoyed a lot. As far as getting around was concerned, we did rent a car for the week so that we could visit San Diego attractions, such as the zoo and Sea World. Although $22 a day for parking sounds steep, it really isn't, considering it's $10 an HOUR in most San Diego locations. And a shuttle came promptly to the hotel every morning to go to the Convention Center, so that was super convenient, as well. Would definitely recommend this hotel to a business traveler (nice lobby internet/computer hub, too) or a family traveling with young children. Very, very pleased!

<Title>“Convenient for an early morning flight”
<Content>I got a room upgrade at the time of check-in. Our reservation was for the Marina Tower, lower floor, balcony, with limited view. the room we were given was on the 10th floor, facing the marina, a pretty view. we stayed only one night, mainly because we had a 6:35am flight. The hotel provides shuttle service to the airport that starts at 5am. It was a bit rushed for us, traveling with two young children. The room was nice, bright, and cozy. my main complaint, and unfortunately it would cause us not to stay again is that the blanket is made of some material that you can hear when the person's moving, and my kids' did a lot of tossing and turning, so i didn't get a good night's rest. We had dinner on site, forgot the name of it, it's the casual one. the food was good, so was the service. Even though the hotel is right next to the airport, we didn't hear anything from take-off or landing.

<Title>“BOOK IT - Exactly as pictured on website!”
<Content>We just returned from a 4 day stay in room 555 at the Marina tower. It was exactly as pictured on the web site - very nautical and appeared to be recently remodeled. It was very clean and quiet. The room was a little smaller than a standard room but had a wonderful balcony with table and chairs. The bathroom was spotless and had been remodeled in the latest "spa" style. Our beds were extremely comfortable. We had a Starbucks in the lobby - a great convenience! But also discovered "Papa's" restaurante on the walk over to see the Bay tower. It is a GREAT little inexpensive place to get your breakfast or lunch. It even had a really nice outdoor seating area that was directly on the marina (we will definitely make this our breakfast place on our return trip). Don't bother with the hotel restaurant for breakfast - way overpriced. The food in the sports pub was awesome and a very comfortable space for gathering with our family for a drink - it has a great view of the marina. The hot tub pa and pool were beautiful. Unfortunately, the spa was not open during our stay. The only disappointment was how the staff handled the situation with the spa.They kept saying it was open - when it wasn't and never apologized for the inconvenience. They also had two fire pits with rocking chairs around it which were a huge hit with guests at night. The Bay tower is much smaller but a more direct view of the bay. It just didn't have that "vacation resort" feeling as much as the Marina tower. Free shuttle service was very efficient and reliable. The view from the hotel is spectacular and location to the airport couldn't be better for travelers. Overall, it was a fabulous stay and I will definitely return again. PS- this room was booked through a 3rd party internet company and I paid $79/night - a GREAT deal for such a beautiful spot. In a phrase.....Book it, you'll love it!

<Title>“Bad Customer Experience from Booking Rep”
<Content>I haven't stayed here yet but I decided to book elsewhere because of the bad experience from a booking representative at the hotel (Dena Crump). On the spg.com website, they advertised they will match the price +10% off if their price is higher than somewhere else. I had found a lower price on Expedia and was able to get this deal for a Club Room from spg. However, when I tried to book 2 more Club rooms Dena refused to honor this price, stating that the price on the web site is $99 for a basic room, the price for the Club Room is $50 more, which is the same as the price on Expedia. I repeatedly told her that spg.com states a price of $209 for the Club Room, it doesn't state $99 + $50 for the Club Room. She refused to acknowledge the price posted online. I could have booked the rooms on spg.com and appeal to spg for a price match but I was fed up with this booking representative that I decided to just cancel and went somewhere else.

To get to some of the rooms requires a long walk and you'll need your key to get back into the hotel. Food is only fair, but staff is courteous. $12 per day charge to park your car.

<Title>“Relaxing Stay!”
<Content>I stayed in the Bay Tower for one night, booked by a travel agent for a conference I was attending. I really enjoyed my stay. I arrived at around 10 AM due to an early flight having worked through the night before boarding the plane. I was planning on just checking my bags and going out to explore the city. Amazingly, they had a room available and I was laying in the bed within minutes of arriving. It was great to spend the day resting. The room does have an interesting layout but it works well. Room feels spacious and was quite clean. One of the unique aspects is that each room has a balcony. Mine faced the marina and airport but I still appreciated the fresh air and sunlight. Loved the pool with the best aspect being that some of the lounge areas are semi-covered in case you do not want a lot of sun. I was able to comfortably nap by the pool without fear of burning myself. It is only a mile or so from the airport but I was not bothered by any noise even though my room faced the airport. If you are a light sleeper, it may be an issue for you. Try asking for a room facing the harbor. This location is not ideal for tourist activity. It is about a $15-20 cab ride to the Gas Lamp District if that gives you an idea. The staff were very friendly and eager to please. They were readily available with dining or entertainment options. I had a great stay at this location and would consider staying there again. However, if I was in San Diego to have fun and see the sights, I might find something a little closer to the action.

<Title>“OK Room, Great Club Perks”
<Content>I've stayed at this Sheraton a few other times all in the Marina Tower, after a large charity event I coordinated in May of 2007 and again in May of 2008. The first room I stayed in was a Marina tower deluxe room with a great view of the marina. That was my favorite of the 3 I have been in, especially after the long night before. It was great sitting out on the balcony with a cup of coffee. Stay 2 was a also a deluxe room, and just as nice, although the view of the parking lot wasn't as nice as that of the marina. If you are staying for leisure, I recommend paying the extra for a marina view. I think it's worth it. During stay 3, we were given a club room, but ironically I enjoyed the deluxe rooms better. We originally reserved a king deluxe, but upon arrival were told we were upgraded to a club room. However, they gave us a double bed room. I just think it's strange having an extra, empty bed there. They must have been remodeling as well, which I hadn't seen any signs of in my previous stays. They were redoing the wallpaper on the floor we were on, which is fine, but there weren't any "pardon our mess signs" or taped off areas, so it just looked a little shabby, unlike the rest of the hotel. We did get a chance to have breakfast in the club lounge and that was fantastic. The lounge is beautiful and the breakfast was nice, albeit it being a hyped up continental breakfast. Overall, I've been pretty happy with Sheraton hotels. I recommend getting room service and ordering their seafood melt sandwhich. mmmm. This particular hotel has great catering and an executive chef, and I have been pleased with the large scale events I have held there as well. The staff are very courteous and attentive. Oh, and it's GREAT having a starbucks in the hotel as well. :) I'm hoping next time I have a chance to enjoy the hotel's other amenities.

<Title>“Nice relaxing stay near San Diego airport”
<Content>I stayed overnight at the Sheraton Bay Tower (the smaller Sheraton) which is about a 7 minute walk from the Sheraton Marina. I took the convenient shuttle from the airport which was literally just a 5 min drive to the hotel. The shuttle runs approx every 25 mins. I stayed in room 917, which was a King size room with a large balcony. The room had a pleasant nautical theme with reds, blues and white. The bed was very comfy with white paneling around the bed. The room was outfitted with a sofa and armchair, a table/desk with two cushioned chairs. The minibar was one of those annoying electronic sensor types. There were small touches; grey marble counter tops in the bathroom and leather pulls on the dresser drawers that gave the room a luxurious feel. The balcony looked over the Navy base across the water with downtown San Diego in the distance. The only problem I had with the hotel was that I could hear the toilet flushing from the rooms above and beside mine, granted the toilets had a powerful flush. I noticed a large number of airline crew were staying at the hotel. This was my first time at a Sheraton and I would say it’s comparable to a Hilton but not as nice a Hyatt (which I normally stay). I did enjoy the in-room Starbucks coffee and tea selection. Although I did not try, the hotel did not seem accessible by public transport. I took a quick $12 cab ride to San Diego downtown. Overall, I enjoyed the stay and would recommend this hotel to everyone.

<Title>“Couldn't believe our luck”
<Content>We flew in from the UK to LAX then drove down to San Diego, it took about 23 hours so we weren't impressed when the check-in guy told us we were not going to be in the main building but had to go to the Bay Towers (we had lots of luggage and very tired kids at 4 and 12), but it was the first time I'd booked on Hotwire so wasn't sure what to expect at $90 a night, he told us we had a nice room on the 12th floor with a good view so we repacked the car and drove the short drive to the correct building, we headed striaght for the elevator and were a little surprised to not see a button marked "12", just 1 thru 11 and "P" which we imagined to stand for parking, but we pressed it anyway and were astonished the doors opened on the penthouse level and our "room with a good view" turned out to be the Sunset Suite with a private roof terrace that was even bigger than the room. We could not fault the hotel in anyway, the staff were friendly and enormously helpful and the pool and fitness room were excellent, and all for 90 dollars a night, congratulations Sheraton and god bless Hotwire...

<Title>“Don't get pushed to the pink palace!”
<Content>We stayed 2 nights at the Sheraton overlooking the harbor. Nice room. We booked on Priceline & maybe that's why we were next to the remote elevator. Only one of the two main elevators was working so the remote was much more active than usual, but it wasn't too bad. Our room did have a great view and the staff, particularly the parking valets were very friendly & helpful. Parking is $20/day or $28/day valet. We chose valet and only tipped once when we left ($20, he seemed happy, I hope they pool).

<Title>“Hotel Was Great, Easily Surpassed Expectations Based on Prior Mixed Reviews”
<Content>My girlfriend and I spent 6 nights at this Sheraton property for a conference downtown. The reviews were mixed so we weren't sure what to expect. However, after spending nearly a week there, we had nothing to complain about whatsoever and really enjoyed our stay. First, I'll address the negatives from other reviews. We found the staff to be very friendly. The concierge was very helpful, the front desk upgraded us to a 9th floor marina view even though we got a great deal via a Priceline bid. The restaurant staff was solid too. (Scott, the bartender at the lobby (Tapatini) bar was excellent). Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and had smiles on their faces. The airport noise did not bother us. When we had the balcony door open we heard a few planes during our stay, but not too many and it wasn't that loud. Unless you plan on staying on the property all day, this really shouldn't be an issue. The hotel is right by the airport, so it is not as central to attractions as it could be. We knew this going in and planned on using cabs to get downtown (both for our conference and to eat in the Gaslamp District and check out Seaport Village). The parking rates are high (more than $20/night), so we figured a 10 minute cab ride downtown (about $10)would be worth it and it was. There is a cab stand at the hotel and that way you don't have to worry about parking, etc. We did stay in the main (Marina) tower. The Bay tower is about a 5 minute walk down the marina, so I can understand why people staying there would be a bit inconvenienced, as the main restaurants are in the Marina tower. About two-thirds of the rooms are in the main tower. The hotel was renovated in late 2008 and it really looks great, inside and out. We had a great stay. While the Bay tower might be too far away for some (the PapaNani's deli is a hidden gem for good casual/cheaper food and snack and is located on the path between the towers), the other complaints about this property seemed unfair, at least based on our 6-night stay there. We would definitely come back, even if we had a car and had to pay $20-$25 a night to park it (we are talking about San Diego after all, parking is never cheap in places like that).

<Title>“Comic Con 2007”
<Content>I spent 4 nights at this hotel as part of Comic Con 2007 (Comic Con is a citywide conference which pretty much sells out every hotel room in the San Diego area.) Upon arrival parking was relatively easy to find as it is adjacent to the hotel BUT the parking lot was full, so once we found a parking spot, we went through the nearest hotel entrance we could find and it was a very long TIRING walk to the front desk. The front desk staff was very courteous and cordial and check-in was speedy. We were checked into a room in the Marina Tower (the main tower) and we were VERY disappointed. We had requested a room with a King bed but were checked into one with two beds instead. The room was very basic and it was quite noisy, as well. IF we had stayed in this room for the duration of our stay, I would have been thoroughly dissapointed. The following morning we received a call from the Front Desk stating that if we desired we could move to a room in the Bay Tower. We packed up our things, drove to the other Tower (it IS necessary to drive between the Towers...too far to walk) and boy, were we pleased. The Bay tower has quite the resort feel to it and it is adjacent to the Marina (not sure about the Marina Tower as our room there faced the main street) The lobby was very elegantly decorated and the rooms were very large and cozy and were decorated in a tasteful nautical theme. It was much quieter in this Tower and the vibe was much more laid-back than it was at the main tower. They should be two different hotels!! My advice: Stay at the Bay Tower unless you are there overnight on a layover and only care about the bed... Also for those attending Comic-Con, this hotel is located at a very good location. The Comic-Con trolly makes pickups right outside the main entrance, and the Comic- Con room rate was very reasonable, as well. All in all, I would stay here again (but only in the Bay Tower!! :) )

<Title>“Great location and hotel!”
<Content>We really enjoyed are stay at the Sheraton. We got a great deal though. I don't know that I'd want to pay $200 a night, plus parking and internet though. We stayed in the Bay Tower. It is like another hotel, seperate from the Marina Tower, and has it's own check-in desk. There is quite a bit of distance between the 2 of them. The bay tower is smaller than the marina tower. There was plenty of parking at the Bay Tower, and it was $22 a day, or $28 for valet. The room was nice enough, and we had a great view of the bay, downtown, and Coronado Island. I would say this tower has a better view. The beds were comfy, and they had lots of comfy pillows too. The bathroom was small, but the shower worked well. Towels were not the best. The internet was $11.95 a day, and it was on the slow side. The mini-bar is expensive and if you move something in it, you will be charged, although they did take the charge off my bill, with no problem. Being close to the airport, I did not hear the airplanes at all.

<Title>“Great hotel but a few notations”
<Content>The Sheraton is literally across the street from airport and by most accounts is a higher end hotel with business personal in mind but Sheraton is actually a gem for families as well, now, there is the main hotel building which sits across the airport and harbour overlooking boats, and then around the corner the bay tower which is in my opinion the better option jutst based on the fact it overlooks the ocean! So nice the balcony i great, pool hot tub although not working properly as far as heat during our stay was impeccably clean. Free starbucks coffee in the room and the beds you cannot beat.......you need a car if you want to go out to eat or sightsee. The hotel does charge 22 a day for self parking but truth be told all hotels in this area do that. The only complaint i have is the bathroom is very small and was not very clean hair on the ground tub was not as clean as i would have hoped....but the room itself very clean.Beware no fridge no microwave and the in room mini bar is ultra sensitive so dont touch it or the sensors charge your room for snacks you didnt eat....but they were gracious and quick to take off the charges that were invalid. I was able to do early check in and front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Thanks for a pleasant stay love the Sheraton...

<Title>“wouldn't stay again”
<Content>Very close to airport which was helpful. Checked in at Marina Tower. Young guys standing around that let customers also stand around. Room in Bay Tower which feels like staying at a budget hotel. Scratchy old generic white bath towels. Only enough for one shower (one set each). Nice bath products. Bathroom clean but so crowded. Small bathtub. I did like the bed and there were lots of pillows. View of the marina which was nice. We didn't mind the airport noise because we are pilots of a small plane, but it was frequent and loud. Not sure a non-pilot would be happy with that. No WiFi in the tower. Had to use an ethernet cable with my laptop. $12/day for internet that is slow. Couldn't watch internet videos because connection so slow. That really annoyed me. Restaurants had pretty good food but average service. Overpriced for what you get. Either lunch or dinner always $45 or more without liquor. Conference facilities fine. Long walk between the two towers which is nice for the most part. I will be back in SD for another conference in Oct. and will not plan to stay here.

<Title>“Very Happy”
<Content>I got the room through Hotwire for about over $100 a night. I was a little concerned before the stay due to some pretty iffy reviews on Tripadvisor, but my wife and I both came away very happy. The rooms are very clean and brightly decorated. Someone commented how the color scheme gave her a headache, but I liked the bright blue nautical theme and it fit well with the hotel. We liked the location. The views are great, it's close to the airport and all the major attractions, and there's a walking/jogging trail right outside. Of note, there's FREE internet available in the lobby. They don't seem to advertise it, probably because they want you to pay for it in the room, but it's there. The only negative, which is probably true of all the major hotels in the city, is the outrageous $22 per day parking fee.

<Title>“Adequate”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel for a meeting. The room and the facilities are nice. Be aware though that the hotel has 2 towers and they are NOT close to one another so if you are staying for a meeting ask to be in the tower where the meeting rooms are ( I believe it's the Marina tower). As far as airport noise I didn't hear it. I walked from the hotel to downtown, it's a 45 mins easy walk, there is a nice sidewalk that goes all round the bay, lots of people jogging and riding bikes so pretty safe. Didnt eat at the restaurants or used the pool, but my room was right in front of the pool and looked nice. You can walk to the hotel from the airport, it's right in front of it, 5 min walk. I didn't have any luggage with me so had no problem, but the hotel provides a free shuttle back and forth from the airport, but again it's extremely easy to get to it just by following the sidewalk.

<Title>“Nice, but so, so loud”
<Content>So much noise at this place, not just the airport noise, as noted and thus expected, but also from the marina, dozens of boats running all night. If you are so fortunate enough to be upgraded to a "marina view" room, refuse it, it is some sick joke or curse which Starwoods must be playing on its most valuable customers. Freaking miserable to stay here, absolutely miserable - bring ear plugs, good ones. The room is otherwise fine, though, and the service friendly. If they would put in a decent sized bathtub and then make thicker doors on their marina view rooms it could be quite a nice place. As it is? Don't stay here. The fitness center and outdoor area are, by the way, absolutely baller.

<Title>“Very nice hotel, but service levels going down”
<Content>The rooms at this hotel have recently been renovated, and are quite nice. The location across from the San Diego Airport is very convenient, and it is a 10-minute ride to downtown, the Gaslamp District, and to the Convention Center. Also a great location if you are visiting the Navy facilities on Pt. Loma. I have stayed at the hotel a number of times over the past 12 months, and generally have had a very positive experience. The exercise room is terrific based on the facilities found in most hotels. There has, however, been a distinct downgrade in the level of service provided. Specifically, the restaurant no longer offers menu service for breakfast - it is buffet only. The buffet is probably better than average, but it is getting a bit pricey at $21.00 per person. We gave up the convenience and went elsewhere for the ability to order off the menu, and at least attempt to stay within our per diem limits. The hotel has also discontinued the newspaper service, so no more USA Today at the door when you get up. To be fair, free copies of newspapers are made available in the lobby area, but you are out of luck if you like to have a cup of coffee and browse he paper in your pajamas in the morning. I also did not receive a bill under my door at the end of my stay. This may be because it would not fit under the door with the new carpet in the room, or it may be an additional cutback in service. It was unclear to me which. Parking is also getting pricey - $22.00 per day to park your rental (or personal) car. The soundproofing is good. Aircraft departing were not terribly noticeable.

<Title>“The Good, the bad and the ugly”
<Content>Stayed here for a work conference. I was in one tower, my co-worker in the other. We immediately compared rooms. The good: I enjoyed my room in the Bay Tower. Huge comfy bed. The bed was at a strange angle in the room, but it worked. Adequate bathroom. (loved the full size hairdryer.. didnt get to use it tho, since I brought my own) The shampoo/conditioner and body lotion was nice and stocked daily. The balcony to the marina was beautiful.. but bird poop on the railings and chair (i did not sit outside) The airport noise did not bother me at all. Work conference had sessions posted in both towers... so lots of walking (short 3-4 min walk) was nice. In between the two towers was an amazing little deli/store called Papa Nani's. Lifesaver to those on a budget! They offered breakfast, lunch (hot and cold sandwiches) and assortment of salads in addition to sodas/juices/beer, snacks and small toiletry items. Wonderful and friendly staff. They even popped popcorn in their microwave for you to take back to your room! The hotel shuttles were fast and friendly drivers. And the main lobby (marina tower) had a pleasant smell that reminded me of Hollister store - but not overkill. There was even lemonade available when we checked in . The bad: No fridge and no microwave. There was a mini-bar but I did not dare touch anything inside (outrageous prices) There were no vending machines but an overpriced gift shop was available. The solution? PapaNani's (see above) The Ugly: The internet in the business center went down on my final night (friday.) I could not check airport schedules or email family or work. Front desk responded by saying, "IT went home at 5, they'll be back monday morning." So basically internet down all weekend? The front desk staff did offer to check on airport schedule for me. And there was a computer in lobby which allowed for guests to print their airline boarding passes. Overall, my stay was a great one. I did not have access to a car, but you can take free shuttle to airport to board the city bus #992 (i recommend a $5 all day pass) and make as many transfers as you like to get to where you want to go. The concierge was helpful in helping me get to Coronado for the afternoon. I did not eat at hotel.. since conference provided some meals..but for snacks I definitely recommend Papa Nani's deli. Thanks for a great stay!

<Title>“Bad location, def NOT 4*”
<Content>We got 2 rooms from Priceline. Since PL group downtown and harbor island together, we got this hotel which is on the harbor island, middle of no where. If you're looking for a downtown SD hotel, don't book thru PL. By the time we got there, they told us our rooms are in Bay tower. It's even farther down away from everything. The rooms are decent, with the marina view, which is ok. The Bay tower doesn't have anything in the lobby, except for a small sitting area. It definately doesn't feel like a 4 star hotel. Like everyone else said, $22 for self park is too much. We had valet, which is nice cuz they kept your car there at the front the entire stay we were there. We were bothered by the airplane noise, it's actually quite loud. Don't book this hotel unless you want to be next to an airport and nothing else.

<Title>“Basic three star with some nice marina views”
<Content>This is a very ordinary property with some pretty marina views as well as an airport very close by. The staff was actually a huge turn off at check-in. An employee, Lorna, who was checking me in informed me that she could not give me credit for our hotel stay with Starwood because my husband's last name was different from mine even though we were both staying in the room.She was actually quite assertive and almost provoking an argument at check-in about it but I just didnt,have the time to answer. Further, the bellman had to tell her that my husband was actually there and that he had seen him because she wanted him to personally come to the desk when I was checking in. I have stayed many times at St. Regis and other Luxury Collection properties and neither of these things has never been an issue. I really was too busy with the meeting I was attending to spend time on this so I had to let it slide and take care of what was there for. Room service was a little better than a three star. I would only stay there again if I had a meeting on property.

<Title>“Great value at $99 a room. Beautiful room and view.”
<Content>If I'd read the reviews on this site I would never have stayed but having missed my flight, I just wanted the closest hotel until the next day - and at $99 I thought it would be average. I got a beautifully appointed room and very nice bathroom. Great bed, desk, flat screen TV, coffee maker and a beautiful view of the marina. Despite other reviews, once the sliding door was closed, I couldn't hear the aiport. At the $99 rate I got which was available on their website as well as hotels.com this was a killer deal and I was very happy. Shuttle to and back from the airport was good also.

<Title>“Better than expected”
<Content>My boyfriend and I wanted to get away for my birthday, so we chose to go to San Diego since we had a great time there on our anniversary. After booking our room on Hotwire, I read a few reviews on the Sheraton Hotel and Marina on Yahoo, Hotels.com, and here on TripAdvisor, and was filled with great remorse for agreeing to book a hotel without knowing the name of the place, so I must admit we had low expectations for our stay. However, as soon as we stepped out of the car, we were treated with respect, which was surprising since we are in our early 20's and aren't ever taken seriously, and the staff was very friendly and professional. The front desk was very slow and very busy with a whole line of guests, but the receptionist was kind enough to upgrade us to a Deluxe Room in the Marina Tower, which had a beautiful view of the marina and the city lights surrounding it. However, the walls were so thin, you could hear the conversations in the hall and in the room next door. Despite this, and the fact that the airport is a half mile away, I very rarely noticed the noise of the planes, unless the balcony door was left open. Our room was smaller than I had expected, and the color scheme of dark blue and bright red gave me a headache, but as mentioned before, the view was beautiful. It seemed like the hotel was understaffed, especially since it was a weekend. We called for room service, and were placed on hold for at least 5 minutes. It then took over a half hour for them to just send up tea, and about 10 to 15 minutes for towels, and when we called valet to prepare our car, they did not answer the phone a good portion of the time. The pool area was beautiful. We went swimming during the night, when there weren't any pool attendents, but that didn't bother us. What did bother us was the fact that the bottom of the pool was falling apart. There were little pieces of plaster that would stab your foot, and big chunks of plaster missing from the ground. If you plan on going out of the hotel to sight see and what not, then this hotel is just fine. But if you want to actually stay in the building to relax, this might not be the best place. Sometimes it would reek of chemicals in the middle of the night, mostly in the hall, when there wasn't any cleaning going on. And despite the slow service, the staff was consistantly friendly and professional and very sincere about any of the delays they were having.

<Title>“Beautiful view of Bay - great hotel.”
<Content>We arrived on a cool, windy, crisp day for a three day stay - the sky was gray blue and we were able to upgrade in the bay building to the 10th floor (the view of the bay was incredible from the balcony). The main restaurant and gym is located 5min away in the marina bldg - exit the hotel and it's a strait shot along the marina/water/boats which was a very pleasant walk. The harbors edge restaurant had great food and great waitors. The only issue I had was when we first checked in and was given the choice of valet parking and "self parking". The staff made self parking out to be free, and unfortunately we found out on our last day that "Self Parking" is $22 a night. This was quite a deflator, as our long weekend at the Sheraton had been perfect to that point. I would understand a flat fee for parking, but robbery is how i feel this played out. When i asked the customer service lady about the charges she tossed away all responsibility by saying "the parking service isn't a part of the sheraton". Maybe this should be the first statement out of their mouths when a guest checks in so they can find somewhere less expensive to park. Or maybe the Sheraton should just offer free self parking.

<Title>“Avoid It Like The Plague!”
<Content>Stayed for 3 nights for a conference. Very close to the airport and you could hear the airport noise almost non-stop. When complained, I was told by the lady at the reception that this was the first time she's heard of such a complain. Well, she must not have worked there very long! In addition, there was also constant construction noise from 9 - 5. Apparently renovation was being done on the 10th, but could be heard on all floors. The shower was moldy. The bed was soft and lumpy. The carpet made you want to keep you shoes on 24/7. On my last day, they checked someone else into my room. Their explanation for the mix up was that the housekeeper informed them that I had left. Never mind that my luggage was still sitting in the middle of the room.

<Content>My husband and I stayed here for one night. We upgraded to a club level room and thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary club floor appetizers in the evening and the buffet breakfast the following morning. We had a room overlooking the pool, marina and bay - it was fabulous. Our room had recently been remodeled and it was great. The bed was heavenly - very comfortable. The hotel is right near the airport, but it must be pretty well sound-proofed, because we were not at all bothered by air traffic noise. We would stay here again.

<Title>“Two hotels on property - not equal in quality - be aware.”
<Content>There are actually two hotels on this property - one is the Bay Tower and one is the Marina Tower. I was unfortunate enough to stay in the Bay Tower. Stayed three nights. Checked in just before midnight the first night. I got stuck on the ground floor to begin with. Then, I was not notified that there would be an additional charge for parking a car during my stay. After fumbling around in the the parking lot, I finally had to go back in and ask and found it was $20.00 additional per night. That was my first disappointment. A 4 start hotel and you have to pay for parking? After I got to the room, the bathroom floor was filthy. Covered with hair - disgusting. This is a 4 star hotel? We got up the first morning to some wonderful in room coffee, left a tip for the staff and went about our day. We got back late that evening and the room had been cleaned. All's well. We needed to connect to the internet to check e-mail. It was a $12.00 charge per day! We got up the next morning to discover that our coffee had not been replenished. Not a good way to start the day. We returned around 6:00 in the evening and wanted to sit by the marina and have a cocktail. We found out to do that we would have to walk 5 minutes to the other hotel or walk 10 minutes the other direction to a resturaunt. This is a 4 star hotel? We did our thing and went out for dinner and returned later that evening. I wanted to get soda from a machine only to find out there were no soda machines in the building - you had to call room service or take one from the mini-bar - a 12 oz can for $3.88? I could by a half a case of 12 oz cans for that. Got up the next morning to discover that the maid neglected to replenish the soap in the bathroom. And, did I mention that this is a 4 star hotel? Save your money. Holiday Inn Express does a much better job for less money. Over priced but still available soda machines, usually free parking, free high speed internet, clean rooms always replenished. This place is a HUGE rip off. Did I meantion that this is a 4 star hotel? They did comp me the $63.88 for the parking and soda from the mini-bar, but I will not be too quick to stay in a Sheraton again any time soon.

<Title>“Burglary in the parking lot. Sheraton takes NO responsibility”
<Content>My car was broken into at this Sheraton property. The cost for repairs was over $2500. Sheraton employees acknowledged that this is a 'high crime area.' And they knew that a rowdy bunch from a wedding party were causing trouble that night. Yet they provided no security to prevent the burglary. Although the lot has a Sheraton sign, and the parking is paid on the hotel room bill, Sheraton claims the lot is owned by a company called 'Mile High.' After repeated inquiries, both Sheraton and Mile High have failed to take any responsibility for my loss.

<Title>“Standard Hotel But Served its Purpose”
<Content>I stayed here for 2 nights when this hotel had a great promotion, so I feel I definitely got my money's worth. I don't like the $20 daily parking fee but that is pretty standard in large cities in California (San Fran hotels can charge up to $50 a day!). I had a marina building room, 6th floor, facing the marina. Nothing too exciting but better than looking at a parking lot on the other side of the hotel. I never went to the bay view building but I think that the views in that building are better since they are on water vs the marina building being surrounded by boats. The hotel is well taken care of- the pool, fire pits, and restaurants looked very nice though I didn't patron any of these. I did use the fitness center- which is one of the better hotel gyms I have used- spacious with everything a gym should have, with newer equipment The Starbucks in the lobby was very convenient, as was the computer center in the lobby where I printed out my boarding pass for my flight (no charge). The room could have used a fridge and the phone in my room had a horrible connection (even just to the front desk was just static) but besides that, no complaints.

<Title>“Awesome Experience”
<Content>My friend and I stayed here while attending Comic-Con this summer. I was apprehensive, because I had heard horror stories regarding hotel rooms booked through the official Con site, and our flight was arriving at 10 AM, a whole 5 hours before check-in. We decided to head to the hotel early anyways, to see if they could at least hang onto our luggage for us. I really shouldn't have worried. Even though I arrived at eleven, they were able to check me right in. They even let me change the room to two beds instead of one! The room was gorgeous, overlooking both the pool and the ocean. It was clean, it was trendy, and it had a minibar which was a fun perk. My only complaint would be the scratchy towels. At one point, I actually opted to air-dry. We ate in both the pub and the Harbor Side restaurant. The food was excellent in both places. It was a little on the pricey side, but that was to be expected. The pool was great, too. I don't know if it was open all night, but I was down there about midnight and nobody bothered us. We stayed five nights altogether, and I was so bummed to leave. I would love to go back sometime.

<Title>“Run-down and noisy - Beward the "Club Floor"”
<Content>Expect smallish rooms that are badly in need of remodeling. Shower is just a trickle, carpet is worn, TV is ten years old, etc. I paid extra for the club floor, on the top two floors of the hotel. However, my room overlooked the service area for the tent they had erected for a conference. There was noise of forklifts and trucks all day. I went to sleep to the sound of backup alarms every night. The club itself is physically attractive, but quite a rip-off. Don't expect free self-service drinks as in most such places. Everything is brought by a waiter. Alcoholic drinks are at regular hotel bar prices. Non-alcoholic drinks are free, but then they make a big show of presenting a zero bill on which you are supposed to include a tip, so unless you want to be a jerk you end up paying a high price for your free drinks. Breakfast and evening snacks are sparse and tired-looking. The location of this hotel is great. There's nothing here that a little demolition wouldn't fix.

<Title>“Nice view, 'average' Sheraton”
<Content>We have been to San Diego many times and tend to stay on Shelter Island - but things were pretty booked, so we opted for the Sheraton on Harbor Island. I had been there before for business conventions (just during the day, but was not booked into the Sheraton) and it had been fine. We stayed in the 'bay' tower, which is a bit of a hike from the main hotel [You may want to ask which building you are in prior to arriving]. The room was 'ok', a bit worn ... slightly noisy when the neighbors got loud. The view was wonderful, but make sure you get the bay side, not the marina side. We arrived real late (due the the flight) around midnite - major disappointment was that there is no room service between midnite and 6am, so we had to scrounge the fast food places a few miles away for dinner. There is a small restaurant and bar in the building, but they did not seem to be open late either. We did try room service prior to leaving - the waiter was extremely nice, the food was average. Staff was nice, but sometimes the 'operator' would take 2 minutes or so to answer, even during the daytime. Could be due to the fact that they were having a large number of weddings there for that weekend, which may have absorbed all of the staff time. Maybe the main, vs. the 'bay' hotel property has less issues. Although they have one free computer in the lobby for internet (it worked about 90% of the time), it was a drag to have to pay $11-$12 per day for internet access in the room. Seemed that there were a number of 'per day charges' (parking, etc. - which they seemed to waive for us as we are Sheraton club members - bet we did pay about $10/hr 'late check out' charge [it was our choice to stay later, due to a late flight back and they were very up front about the cost]). Although the hotel is right across the road from the airport, we did not notice a lot of airplane noise, which was very surprising. As we left, the staff even brought our car around, even though we did not 'valet park' - a nice touch. We might stay again, but would if our preferred hotels on Shelter Island were not available.

<Title>“Nice hotel, good location depending on what you want to do”
<Content>I attended a conference here (again) and invited my sister for a getaway. As such, I booked the Bay Tower to be a little removed from the large conference chaos. The main building is probably a nicer hotel and with more restaurants and facilites, but the Bay Tower served us well. First, room 1188 was VERY spacious, with two queen-sized beds, good closet space and drawers, in-room safe, iron/ironing board, in-room coffee maker, and other amenties typical of a business class hotel. All rooms seem to come with a balcony -- absolutely delightful with morning coffee or a cocktail in the evening. The housekeeping was generally spotless. The staff was very helpful, friendly, and courteous throughout, and there is a concierge desk. This room overlooks the marina (which was lovely) and airport (which we find interesting, and were not at all bothered by any airport noise.) Odd-numbered rooms look over the bay and downtown in the distance. There is a complimentary internet access terminal in the lobby, and (I think) free wireless internet access in the public rooms. While the larger main hotel has larger pools and more restaurants, this place was a nice respite. The Bay Tower pool is large enough to paddle around in, and the facilities were quite nice with chaises and garden plantings. There is also a hot tub. Since it was on the far side of the hotel complex, it seemed less crowded than the main hotel pools (although the pool by the lanai rooms is also less crowded.) It is a reasonably short walk to the main hotel when you want more options for bars and restaurants. There is also an outdoor casual cafe operated by the marina along this walkway for coffee, sandwiches and casual breakfast and meals. You can book various harbor tours, fishing boats, bicycles, etc. in this area, although not part of the hotel operations. The location of the hotel is what you make of it. It is near the airport, with a complimentary shuttle. The hotel is not on the beach, but you can get to many beaches by car. With a car, it is also reasonably convenient to the zoo, Fashion Valley shopping center, etc, with easy access to Hwy 5. Compared to staying downtown, it was reasonably easy to zip around, unless you wanted to be right in the Gaslight Quarter or Old Town, but these areas are still very do-able from this hotel. The hotel provides excellent driving directions to many attractions and interesting areas. Harbor Island is not that large, but provides a nice venue for walks, bike rides, harbor viewing, etc. If you want to be on the beach, the historic Hotel Del Coronado is a lovely place (been there, done that,) but it is often overrun with tourists just walking through. The beach is very nice, and there is much to like about this charming hotel and area (including the hotel shops,) but the Sheraton may be more convenient if you want to get around to the zoo, Sea World, aquarium in La Jolla, hiking in Torrey Pines, etc. You can still go to the beach in Coronado (Imperial) without staying at the hotel. Frankly, if the beach was a priority, going up the coast to La Jolla or Del Mar might also be an option. But if you want a convenient location for general running around, the Sheraton is pretty good. There were some downsides that we could easily overlook. The tub had been re-done, but the covering was peeling. This Bay Tower hotel has very little in the way of a bar or restaurant (it was open at lunch, but often looked closed;) and generally less impressive than the main building. But again, when a large conference is swarming, you might want to be in this somewhat-removed location. The mini-bar has one of those annoying electronic systems. This meant that when we took a bottle of wine out to see what kind it was, we were charged (but the front desk very quickly reversed the charge when we pointed out the problem.) Finally, I still find it annoying when a hotel of this calibre charges for in-room internet access. There is a parking charge of $20 a day for self-park, $26 for valet, but it is reasonably convenient, and there are few hotels around that don't charge for parking in such prime areas. The hotel itself does not have much around it for dining, i.e. very little option to walk to other than hotel dining. However, with a car, much is possible, and/or a quick cab ride away. 'Strongly recommend that you try Miguel's for Mexican in the nearby Shelter Harbor area. You might be the only tourist in the place -- very full of locals. Not far from this restaurant, there is also a Von's and TRader Joe's to supply your excursions. Ask for directions. So: I'd be happy to stay here if a conference booked into this hotel again, or if I was generally touring the area. I can also see it as reasonably convenient for families who wanted to do a lot of touring in the area, assuming the room rate was acceptable. But if I really needed to be on the beach or have a greater number of cafes and shops to visit by walking to them, I'd go elsewhere.

<Title>“Careful”
<Content>Booked a 3 night downtown 4 star hotel via Hotwire at the Sheraton. Arrived late in the day after traveling from the East Coast. We were shuffled into the bar as they were still "preparing" our room ? Eventually the bar closed and we moved to the lobby area still waiting, only to eventually learn at 1 AM (4AM our time) that there was no room being prepared and there were no rooms available in San Diego?? In fact our only choice was to drive 35 miles to another Sheraton property in Carlsbad for what was left of the night. Not a great start to our vacation and we felt we were misled (if not repeatedly lied to) and taken advantage of as our trip was prepaid via Hotwire. We kept Hotwire informed and they made contact with Sheraton and have worked out compensation. Kudos to Hotwire!. Sheraton needs to work on their process and management teams communications. We will avoid Sheraton in the future. We did return to the hotel for nights 2 and 3 as we had prepaid. The hotel is nice enough, close to the ariport and a huge marina sits along side the hotel. Hotel is a car drive or cab ride to any downtown locations. Pool area was nice and the Sheraton did attempt to recover witha nice marina view room and breakfast. Be careful when booking this hotel and actively confirm and verify your arrival. If you really desire a downtown hotel near attractions this is not the hotel for you.

<Title>“Sheraton is average”
<Content>In general, this hotel is OK. Tim Clark and Michael (outside) and Stacy (at the concierge) were the most helpful and friendly!! They deserve a raise :) The room was average, I was in Marina tower, 5th fl. The shower curtain liner was had mold spots (gross!!), the wood on the sink was peeling off, the trim around the closet had many black scuff marks and the carpet in front of it had a few stains. The bed skirts had white stripes that were not part of the pattern -( almost like when you do your laundry and paper is in there and it sticks to your black shirt out of the dryer). The telephones did not ring- (yes, I checked, the ringers on BOTH phones were on high) and the bedside phone allowed you to hear a person, but the person you were [attempting] to speak with would not be able to hear you. I tried to tell someone about this EVERY day for the 4 days I was there...they sent someone up to my room at 9pm on the last day- just as I was falling asleep. I called the front desk to ask what the deal was and they stated "we tried to call you, but when we got no answer, we thought something was wrong" - ya think??? How many days had I been requesting the phones to be fixed????? Geesh! In the bar, the bartender Chandra was either having a bad day or was just overwhelmed with the amount of people trying to get drinks or food. SUGGESTION: get her someone to wait on tables!! They offer free internet, but after 3 days of being unable to coneect, and again, talking to the front desk - rather than trying to fix the problem, they kept referring me to the business center in another part of the hotel. I was assured each day that it would be fixed...on the 4th day, Stacy from the concierege desk actaully came over and watched me log in. She then worked a little magic and within under 1 minute, I was good to go. The conference I was there for was great and the ball rooms and meals during the conference were a perfect setting for the function. In general, good venue for large groups and the rooms are simply a convenience - I would not stay there on a vacation, though....

<Title>“Not worth the $$”
<Content>I was anticipating my two night stay here at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina, but now regret my decision to stay here. I generally enjoy my stays at Starwood hotels as I am a Platinum Preferred, however, I will never spend a night at this particular hotel. First the good -Plenty of on site parking -Free airport shuttle -Friendly desk staff -Great views of downtown from the 7th floor balcony Now the bad -Poorly maintained room (missing granite piece in bathroom, filthy light fixtures, hole in the wall near door (not caused by door). -Parking, not mentioned in my itinerary is $20/night, $26 for valet. -No WIRELESS internet, you can connect to the all but high-speed for only $12.95/24hrs -Half eaten items leftover in the "Refreshment Center" For the rate I paid, the room left quite a bit to be desired, if you don't need to stay near the airport, less expensive alternatives should be considered

<Title>“Like Motel 6”
<Content>I called the hotel the day before we were to arrive to let them know we would be arriving late and that we needed 2 beds. The receptionist was very helpful and said I will note that in your file. When we arrived the next night they had no record of me calling and only had a king bed available for myself, husband and two kids. They said we do have a room with two double beds available in our west hotel. Thinking it was of the same quality I said sure. Our bedroom stunk, there was mold on the ceiling above the shower, the bathroom light didn't shut off, and there weren't fixtures around the bathroom lights just lightbulbs. We complained to the main hotel the next am and the gave us free breakfast vouchers and said they would move us if a room became available. I called later in the day and they still had no rooms available for us to move to in the main hotel but said they could move us up to the 10th floor in the west hotel. So when we checked in later that night the room on the 10th floor wasn't available. I went to the main hotel to talk to a mananger and he said there is nothing we can do we have no rooms available. I asked him to refund my money and he said he would.... We will see. Don't stay in the west side it is like Motel 6.

<Title>“Failed to deliver!”
<Content>Waited in a very long and slow queue at check in (only two desk opens) only to find they had 'deleted' our reservation (made months ago) and could not provide the interconnecting rooms requested . Eventually got rooms allocated only to find that one of them had a flooded bathroom (from a leaking toliet - nice!). Moved rooms (with an apology) to then be woken at 4am with a fire alarm (and evacuation) apparently caused by a leak. it was quite clear staff did not know what to do which was not reassuring and there was no communication. We actually had an enjoyable stay in spite of these factors but you were definitely left with the impression that this was a hotel failing to deliver on the basics and one where client care was almost non existent.

<Title>“Nice hotel in good location”
<Content>My boyfriend and I recently stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed our stay. The staff were lovely, check in was very quick and the hotel itself is well presented and clean. Our room was average, exactly what you would expect from a Sheraton, lovely big comfortable bed, adequate bathroom but spotlessly clean and a small balcony over looking the harbour and downtown San Diego. The pool is lovely and not busy at all as this seems to be mostly a business hotel. We didnt hear any noise from the airport at all. There isnt a great deal else on Harbour Island other than the other part of the Sheraton, a Hilton and a fantastic restaurant called Island Prime which is always pretty busy so book first, it has excellet views across the bay of downtown. We went into the gas lamp quarter in downtown 2 nights as it is only a 10 min taxi ride and there are some great bars and restaurants there. Try The Ivy Hotel, it has a rooftop bar with huge fire pits where you can sit outside overlooking the city. Back to the Sheraton though where there are two bars, one is Quinns which has pool tables and tv's etc and the other is the main hotel bar which is nice an relaxing with the most friendly bar staff. You can take your drinks outside by the fire pit which over looks the harbour, its so relaxing. Overall a lovely hotel in the ideal location as its only 10 mins drive to Seaworld, La Jolla, Coronado and Downtown. Finally.....you must visit Hotel Del Coronado because it is beautiful and has so much history, plus they serve an excellent lunch, in fact if you have more money just stay there instead!

<Title>“Nice Stay”
<Content>Okay, as a San Diego native, there is no question that the Sheraton still retains that California feeling. In fact if you take your self (Walking) outside of the hotel and to the East you will see an amazing view of downtown that even I did not know existed. In fact, you usually have to go to to the other side by way of the Coronado Bay Bridge to enjoy such a view. Minutes from the very best of San Diego: Balboa Park, San Diego Zoo and Gaslamp Quarter. I find at times that the hotel transported me to circa 1970's, but the pool and grounds more than made up for this. I do agree with the other reviewers: For a grander experience, the Marina Tower has exceptional service and closer to the middle of all of the action.

<Title>“A wonderful Stay”
<Content>My family loved this hotel. We had 3 rooms with great views of the Marina. The rooms were spotless, older but very comfortable. We had our 1 year old grandaughter with us and the hotel went out of their way to make it a good stay for her, the crib was great, we were able to rent a refrigerator, the pool area with toys was perfect. The airport being so close did not impact us, the noise was minimal. We all loved the pool area after sightseeing all day. The employees, all of them from parking attendent to the front desk staff, the maids and waiters and the concierage were friendly, well informed and great at their jobs. I have absolutely no complaints and am planning another trip there soon.

<Title>“Got a great deal”
<Content>I booked this room without knowing its identity, on Hotwire - only paid $129/nite plus the $20/nite fee for parking-still quite a deal compared to their published rates-after I got the name of the hotel, I quickly checked reviews to find some negative comments about the hotel - I called the hotel directly- and worked with them on getting the Bay Tower - which the rooms are Larger ( or so I am told)-----and honestly, they gave us a Bay facing room on the 7th floor - we watched three sets of fireworks on our patio the night of the Fourth, and it was a great view......I would say to just be sure about which building you want to be in when you make the reservation...for us, a larger room was more important than the larger pool area that the other tower offered....the experience was a lot better than I expected, given the online reviews that I had read in advance of getting there - yeah, their computers were not working when I tried to check in, but , that wasn't so bad - we just left our luggage and checked in later.

<Title>“Tricky Tricky”
<Content>Upon arrival at the Sheraton which looked beautiful as we pulled up to it, we realized that since our room was booked in the Bay Tower, we were not staying at the Hotel we pulled up at. We were to continue down the road to another Sheraton. The Bay Tower wasn't too bad but definately not as nice as the main sheraton. The front desk seemed very excited to tell us about the beautiful view of the Bay from our room, which it's true, we could see the bay...but the ugly parking lot was in between us and the bay. The room was clean but didn't seem to be up to par with other Sheraton's we've stayed at prior to this trip. On our confirmation email, it stated to please enjoy the Continental Breakfast which at any Best Western or any other cheaper hotel/motel...translates COMPLIMENTARY! Wrong we were, The set up was like that of a help yourself complimentary station with the typical muffins, fruit, oatmeal, and coffee. EXCEPT we were charged $3.00 for a coffee that we poured ourself ( had we known, we could have just made coffee in our room with the provided coffee pot). There was a starbucks at the main Sheraton but we would have had to walk quite a distance or get in our car just to get a cup of coffee. The muffins were $3.00/ea. and the banana's were $1.50/ea. Which seemed like such a rip off...I mean we were spending $200/night and they had to charge us for a banana! On the day of Check out we got our bill slipped under our door and it had five (5) addit'l. charges. We inquired what these were at the front desk and they said that we ate the food out of the mini fridge. in the room, which we didn't. It was over $30.00 in charges that kind of just looked like service/tax fees had we not looked into it. They quickly got rid of the charges without any questions. Interesting enough our friends who were staying at the hotel too recieved charges from the fridge. which they had not even opened either. What a scam...had we not questioned it...they would have made an extra $30.00 off us...for nothing.They obviously do this often for they didn't even question our us about the additional charges they just removed them. I'm very dissapointed in the Sheraton, I thought that name stood for QUALITY ....this one proved that wrong. We also wanted to grab some food and a drink and since the bar at our Bay tower was closed at 9pm on a Friday night, we had to drive over to the Main Sheraton ( kind of a pain) we went to the little lounge and ordered drinks which took over 35 mins to get from the time we ordered...seriously are they trying to drive business away on purpose? We had some friends with us that had children , which the lounge said it was acceptable for them to stay until 11pm. We ordered food (which was okay...not bad but not fabulous) we then sat there waiting and waiting for our check. Our server was nowhere in sight, we finally asked a different server if we could please get our check, all of a sudden our server appeared with the check and told us that we needed to get out of there because it was past 11pm, well we would have been out of there by 10:30 had she not dissapeared on us. That was very poor service and unprofessional on her part. So to sum it up...we woudn't not stay there again. There were way too many scams and things that kind of blind sighted us. Perhaps the rooms at the Main tower were nicer but that's a chance we're not willing to take. If you decide to stay here....beware!

<Title>“Pretty average”
<Content>Better than a Motel 6, but not by much. Like most people, I stayed here for a conference. Had my company not been paying for it, I would not have chosen here and would not return here. I also would encourage my company to choose another place in the future. The room was pretty basic, not uncomfortable. It looked a little worn, but was clean enough. It's pretty obvious that a large amount of people come in and out of the rooms for big conferences. There was nothing outstanding, worth mentioning about any of the rooms (I saw several) or the hotel in general. It's right on the bay, and literally across the street from the airport. Despite my expectations I did NOT hear the airport, armed services or bay while in my room. My understanding is that may be a unique experience. The bay might have been a nice view, but it was very cloudy the entire time I was there. A lot of the rooms had pretty big holes in the wall from fixtures being moved or removed. Many walls had stains and a lot of the furniture was pretty scarred. This was stuff you had to look for, but it was apparent they had made no attempt to cover most of this. I had trouble with my bathroom door not closing tightly. Pretty basic room, modern decor with a comfortable enough bed. I'd recommend not going here, and if you are doing a conference, try to find another place.

<Title>“The place to be pampered”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for one night (Marina Tower), 5 July 2008 and never wanted to leave. The grounds are gorgeous, with flowering trees, palms, fountains. The valet staff, bell man, front desk staff were all very gracious and accommodating. The lobby looks like a palace and there are big pumps of delicious scented lotion in the lobby and huge candles that make the place smell gorgeous during the day - then they light them at night. There's a Starbucks right in the lobby. There is a place to log onto the Internet or connect your laptop for 45 minutes for free, and the computer speed when there were only a few people on-line was lightning quick. It felt very luxurious sitting there checking my e-mail with my Starbucks! Beautiful lanai out back, with rocking chairs, deck chairs, Adirondack chairs to look out over the marina , places to eat your lunch outdoors - plus fire pits at night. The pool is WONDERFUL and there's a jacuzzi pool too. Our room was on the 9th floor with a panoramic view towards the marina and the sunset . King-sized bed and pillows were very comfortable. I've read complaints about airplane noise, but once we slid the balcony door closed, we heard no airplane noise at all and slept like babies. Nice big tub. Very clean room. I loved the mandarin & mint shampoo and lotion! I would warn against opening the mini-bar; of course we knew the snacks were expensive, but didn't realize everything's computerized and motion-sensitive, so when our teenager jokingly picked up the mini-bottles of booze, the charges went right onto our bill. Although - the front desk staff removed the charges with a smile when we explained. You also are warned not to put any personal items into the fridge - again the motion dectectors will know you did it, and there's a $25 charge. Checkout was at 12:00, but our flight was not til 5:00pm, so we asked if we could stay a little longer. We were granted a 1:00pm checkout, plus after that, you can leave all your luggage and even your purse with the bellman, and go use the pool for as long as you like, without needing a room key. We took the dry cleaning bags for our wet suits to put in our suitcases later. There is a spa/fitness room where they'll give you all the swim towels you want and give you a place to change back into your dry clothes - and I have to mention: the "restroom" in the spa was amazing. Scented candles, and cupboards full of lotions, hair products, razors, deodorant, robes and slippers, the works! - for guests. There is also a steam room and of course a shower area and lockers. What a great way to wait for our flight! When you are poolside, there's a litlte cabana that rents big, fun floaties for $7/hr, and sells sunscreen, waterproof cameras, etc. . There is a fresh-water cooler for free, plus there are staff who walk around very courteously asking if you want to order drinks and/or lunch, which you can enjoy right there in the sun. A little cheaper place to eat: Just a 2-minute walk to the left side of the marina is a little sandwich/burger shop right on the dock that sells sundries and some groceries, probably for boaters who need to restock. They have great ice cream and are very polite and friendly. Places to sit inside and outside. This hotel could not have been more heavenly. We got a great deal on [--] (around $125 for the one night, one king-sized bed plus a roll-away bed for $15 for our son). I'd never want to stay anywhere else in San Diego.

<Title>“Sheraton --Bay Tower”
<Content>We came for a Conference with a discounted rate, so I'm not sure if the two towers command the same room rates. The Bay Tower worked very nicely for us, but it does look like an older property re-branded as Sheraton. Our room looked onto the Bay and North Island-a very excellent view, no noise from airport. Between the two Sheraton towers is a good outdoor deli that serves the boat marina. It gets all the Sheraton guests for breakfast and lunch at cheap prices. Restaurants: The restaurant at the Bay tower is almost nonexistent. The restaurants at the main tower are deluxe, with terrace dining. Pool: Not too special at the Bay tower. The pools(two) at the main tower are deluxe/ resort oriented, with live entertainment and waiter service to the pool chairs... Lobby: At the bay tower, nothing special. At the main tower--Wow! lots of activity, fancy. Room: clean, good bed, couch, tv, mini-bar--don't touch it., bathroom clean. Parking: We got a special rate, but any charge is too much. After spending much time on the balcony soaking up the view, we would have been happy, but then we walked over to the main tower----WHAT is this !!... Is this the same hotel !!? The main tower has activities, live entertainment at the pool, lounges, Starbucks --I hope they charge less at the Bay tower! On the island, there are several restaurants within walking distance---besides the deli next to the hotel, there is the Boathouse restaurant with good prices, and Tom Ham's lighthouse, and Island Prime restaurant. By car, the Star of India/ Embarcadero/Coronado Ferry and Harbor Excursion is about 5 minutes away.

<Title>“Great Experience”
<Content>I saw a lot of negative reviews on this hotel and knew that it was built many years ago, so we were dreading having to deal with a run-down property in dire need of a facelift. We decided to make the best of it because we were attending an event that was within easy walking distance. I have to say that we were very pleasantly surprised. Everyone on the hotel staff -the front desk clerk who gave us a harbor view room, the chambermaid who went out of her way to chase down an item I needed, the waitress in the huge dining room - was courteous and professional. Our room, though not particularly large, was nicely decorated in a subtly nautical theme in warm wood tones, navy and cream. Of course, the little balcony and view of the pleasure boats moored below helped a lot! The spotless bathroom was well-lit, and had a granite countertop with a basket of toiletries and a curved shower rod, indicating it had been updated fairly recently. The only meal we had in the hotel was breakfast. The food was okay, but personally I don't think a totally basic breakfast for two should cost over fifty dollars. The only other amenity we used was the wi-fi in the lobby, which was available to hotel guests. Much appreciated. We liked the location, which is near Little Italy and other attractions of downtown; we didn't notice any noise from the airport which is very close. Although the hotel is large and shares many features of a corporate chain, the warm welcome and pleasant attitude of everyone we dealt with gave it a very personal vibe.

<Title>“No Guarantees Here!”
<Content>I reserved a room with a view over the phone and was promised a nice room one month in advance. Upon arrival we were told, "we can't guarantee rooms, but you can have one on the other side, the view of the airport is beautiful". Maybe someone should remind these beautiful minds what the definition of a reservation is! No effort was made to accommodate us, and our trip was ruined. I hope this doesn't happen to others, they are taking advantage of people who don't want to look like schmucks and complain!

<Title>“Not so great”
<Content>One of the few hotels with vacancy the day before we left. My wife booked it as it was lots cheaper than whatever else she found. I'm not sure what it cost, but will keep that factored in for the review. We stayed in the Bay Tower, which is a good walk from the Marina Tower. The rooms were not too small (I heard they are bigger than in the Marina Tower), but not what you would call large, either. There was a very comfortable king bed, tv, table, sofa, dresser in the room. Ironing board, coffee maker (single serve packets - they had 3 each day for us), and in-room safe were the amenities. There was a small balcony that you could sit on. In our case, we had a beautiful view of the airport to enjoy. You coul definitely hear them taking off every few minutes if the door was open. If the balcony door was closed, it was very hard to hear the planes. Room service pricing was reasonable, food was average. Our room was clean and comfortable. The Bay Tower has a small gift shop, medium sized restaurant (seemed to be dinner only), and conference rooms. The lobby was not welcoming, and if you didn't order room serrvice, then you are a hungry person. You can hike over to the Marina Tower, which definitiely has a nicer lobby. On the way to the Marina Tower, you will pass a small coffee shop with sandwiches and muffins (if you need a quick bite and dont want to hike all the way to the other tower). The Marina Tower lobby has a restaurant, sports bar, gift shop, wireless area and lounge. This lobby is decently appointed (much better than the bay tower). You can rent boats and seadoos just outside the marina tower. Overall, this is a decent hotel if you are looking for a relaxing trip, and the room is just to sleep or hang out in. I would recommend the marina tower for the lobby and its facilities over the bay tower, although i hear the rooms are smaller in the marina tower. We drove from L.A., and that airport frontage road is a real bear to navigate through to the hotel from the freeway. Getting out from the hotel to downtown San Diego was a real time killer. On the other hand, getting to Sea World or the harbor was pretty easy. If you are going for a value-based weekend, then this hotel might be okay with you. If you are going to San Diego as a destination vacation, you really owe it to yourself to look harder and find somewhere else.

<Title>“Not new but definitely OK”
<Content>Before my attending a meeting at this Sheraton, I read the reviews posted on this site. After being there for 5 days, I have a better understanding of what it is about. As a disclaimer for this resort, I learned that it has been here for 40 years. With that said, you can look at areas of the hotel and see 40 years, and then others are as new as what you would find from a new construction hotel. This is how I break it down: THE LOBBY AND EMPLOYEES The lobby was beautiful and spacious with all the amenities you would expect from a finer hotel. There was a bellman stand and staffed concierge. The employees are top in serving your needs. Good hires that work with sincerity. There is a bar and restaurant in the lobby area that are both nice. ROOMS: This is a problem. There was a constant joke about the rooms being similar to a road side lodge. They are small. The bathrooms have been updated and were clean, as were the linens. The beds are comfortable and the room was satisfying overall, just nothing fancy or trendy. Be advised, not all rooms are interior corridors. You might need to be specific if you don’t' like your door opening to the outside. Some colors and décor are showing age. EXERCISE ROOM: I have yet to find a hotel/resort exercise room than can accommodate everyone that is trying to exercise at 6 AM. It could have been larger. All the exercise equipment was tops, just limited. There was plenty to do to get a full workout. It is San Diego and the weather was beautiful. Many, including me, ran along the coast on concrete path. POOL: I believe there were three total. I saw two. Both of which were very nice and bigger than normal. There were plenty of chairs to satisfy anyone wanting to sit by the pool and bake. The pool was even depth all the way across. MEETING ROOMS: It was evident that when this resort made upgrades it was done to the meeting facilities. Really nice in every way. LOCATION: This was good and bad. If you are flying into San Diego, you could walk to and from this resort. Literally across the street. The resort sits on the water and there is a very nice running path that is next to the water. The Sheraton is to two separate buildings. I was in the main building but guess it is a good 10 minute walk to the other. There are a couple restaurants within walking distance, but it is a 10 minute cab ride to the Gas Lamp district. Overall I would stay here again. I am big on service and effort and this property exceeded my expectation on both. I guess it depends on what your plans are. This was my fourth trip to San Diego in the past 4 years. With that said, I have stayed in 4 different properties. The other three were in and around the convention center. If you are looking to get away and simply relax with comfortable amenities, then the Sheraton is good enough. If you want to go to San Diego and walk to places, you should choose another place.

<Title>“DO NOT STAY HERE!!”
<Content>We stayed here for the Rock & Roll marathon. It was the worst experience ever! OVER PRICED AND DIRTY! On our way up to our room after checking in, we got stuck in the elevator for an hour (3 adults and 2 kids under 4 years old). My wife and my son did not want to get in the elevator again. We asked to switch to a room on ground level the next day and they said we were supposed to be checking out, but we had one more night left. It was even written on our room key that our check out date was the next day. Finally got that settled. They were supposed to credit my sister-in-laws room $50 for the elevator incident, but charged her $50! If you rent a car, $20 a day for parking in a dirt lot with not easy access to the hotel. Each day we had to talk to a manager, each time a different manager. NOT WORTH IT! The Hilton in La Jolla is much better!

<Title>“Sheraton SD Marina = DISAPPOINTING”
<Content>I am going to be honest----The Sheraton Hotel and Marina was a disappointment ---- especially if you are staying in the BAY TOWER! Location is next to airport, views are not impressive and not within walking distance of anything! We were dupped when we first arived at the Marina tower parking our vehicle and entering the lobby to check in. We were impressed with the decor and it felt like a fine hotel but were told that our room was in the BAY tower and was a 1/4 mile away. OK? we thought as we repacked our car for the drive over. When we first arrived the service level dropped by 10 points and had to ask more than once for a bellman. Entering the lobby you can feel the difference in the two towers--Marina was grand and the Bay was bland! In fact the BAY tower felt as if it were a former lower budget hotel rebranded as a Sheraton. The room was not impressive as the decor was a blue and red natical theme---yuk. There were no robes and a small bathroom with a cracked toliet that leaked. The location of both towers are adjacent to the SD airport and isolated from downtown. You would have to use a taxi or your own vehicle to go anywhere. If you do stay at the Sheraton Marina make sure you get a room in the Marina tower; our friends did and were happier than we. If you want to experience SD you would be better off staying downtown were you can use the trolly to explore the city. We paid $229 a night and felt we could have done far better elsewhere and we did----we moved to the Hard Rock for the last half of our trip.

<Title>“Nice hotel, but noisy and fridge taboo”
<Content>I stay at the Sheraton in May 2008 at the Bay tower. The hotel locates in a very beautiful location with a fantastic view. There is a nice path for jogging/walking and that is very nice and enjoyable. However, the nice view has a price to pay as it is far from downtown. There is no store nearby to buy personal items. No easy public transportation is available, except taxi. The parking fee at the hotel is quite high, about 20 dollars/day. It is also very noisy as the San Diego airport is nearby. You can hear them almost all the time. If you are a light sleeper, that could be a problem. The hotel has internet connection but for a fee if you use it in your room, but you can work at the lobby for 1hr free of charge. The one that I dislike the most is that you cannot use the hotel's refrigerator for stocking your drinks. The hotel will throw your stuff away and charge you 25 dollars each time for the rearrangement of the fridge. We pay 300 dollars/night and cannot use the fridge. Saying that, I really enjoy San Diego. The city is very beautiful and is a good place to visit. Next time, I would choose the hotel inside downtown that I could enjoy so many beautiful things nearby.

<Title>“Nice Location”
<Content>Stayed there for one night with my then 10 yr old son in between visiting Sea World and Legoland (!!). We got a good deal thru the Sheraton rewards program. Check in was very quick and easy. Front desk staff was very helpfull. The standard room was a little small, but it worked for the two of us (would not work for the whole family of 4, however!). Nice view of the harbor - several stories up so that we did not get much noise from the pool area. Very comfy beds! GREAT POOL FOR THE KIDS!! Shallow, warm with lots of statues spurting water! Inner tubes and floaty things available pool side. Drink service from the pool bar very slow. Room service was fast and tasty. Lots of kid friendly pay-per-view movie choices, but pricey. The Disney channel or Cartoon network would have been nice. The breakfast buffet looked a little exotic(and pricey) for my 10 yr old, so we opted for the local Denny's instead. Overall, great for the one night stay.

<Title>“Nickeled and Dimed”
<Content>We stayed here for Gator by the Bay which is located right outside the hotel, so the location is great. There were about ten of us from the same area staying there. The room was fine but customer beware of charges that sneak up on you. A member of our party rented a car through the hotel, was not informed of the need for a parking pass, and the hotel tried to charge him $40 to get his car back out of the lot the next morning. He refused to pay it, and they sold him the (ridiculously priced) $20 a night pass they should have told him about in the first place. It costs $12 to hook up to the internet in your room and you can't use wifi because the hotel has somehow blocked access to unsecured networks. You can see them on your laptop, but can't connect. A salad with moldy tomatoes wasn't taken off the bill in the hotel restaurant until we went back and complained, even though the waitress had been handed the moldy tomato before the bill was produced. The bottle of sunblock that costs $10 at the deli down the road costs $15 at the hotel, Miller Lite is over $5 a glass (Miller Lite? Good grief!), and don't take the offer of a refill on your soda unless you want to pay full price for another one. The front desk is understaffed. The airport shuttle is great and, strangely enough, free? What were they thinking? I think I'll probably skip Gator by the Bay and just go to other festivals. This was too much like being a captive money machine for the Sheraton.

<Title>“Some highs, some lows -”
<Content>The hotel is a bit outdated and needs refreshing, but the room was quite comfortable and the view wonderful. Obviously being near the airport has some advantages and quite honestly we didn't hear the planes at all. Our biggest complaint was the $12 charge per day for the Internet. That was outrageous. When we complained we discovered that our convention had a deal on the Club rooms with complementary breakfast and afternoon snacks with free Interent for about $20 extra. Given the $12 charge this was the right deal for us on this trip. However, I agree with another writer that they should be specific about the parking cost and the Internet and include it in the price...it was simply ridiculous and started us in a bad mood upon our arrival. The staff has been quite cordial and the Club Floor a delight. I'll check out the pool and facilities tomorrow. By the way, our Club Room was no different than the original room we were offered. If you want to be near the action, this is not the place to be. It is quite far from the Convention Center, Gaslight area etc. We rented a car so it wasn't a problem for us.

<Title>“Pretty View, Close to Airport”
<Content>Had a lanai room that overlooked the marina which was really nice. The HVAC system is the type that comes on only when you are in the room so getting it warm enough when you arrive late is a challenge. The hotel seemed to be very heavily staffed with people to answer direction questions which was handy. Service in the restaurant is very slow, they seem to bring things then disappear and the restaurant wasn't very busy. Didn't get the chance to use it, but there was a lovely pool. Plenty of sidewalk and walking areas for a good walk and there were tennis courts. The meeting facilities were very good for the conference that we attended although the rooms were generally kept very cold. The exhibit hall in the basement felt a little cramped. This is out near the airport, not near downtown. It is about a $15.00 cab ride to the Gas Lamp district.

<Title>“Long on Price. Short on Service”
<Content>Understaffed check-in desk at peak time (7 pm) $20 self-parking includes very poorly lit parking lot and a long walk (the hotel was all too quick to point out that it wasnt their problem because the parking lot is managed by a third party). Valet is only $6 more (plus tip). Ignored by wait staff when attempting to order in the sports bar in the lobby. In their defense it was understaffed for the number of people in the bar, but they did wait on someone else first who came in after I did. The room was clean and comfortable althought the "lanai room" I had was downstairs and had no view. Avoid these rooms if possible. For the price ($189 per night) this could have been better.

<Title>“YET AGAIN...Rotten Experience!!!”
<Content>Here we go again....I thought I would give this hotel ONE more shot after writing my last negative review and I have even stayed there TWICE since the last review. I always start with the positive things...some of the staff (Dinah at the front desk, the cleaning staff, and the staff in the Club Lounge breakfast and evening drink area are EXCELLENT!!!!) were just down right wonderful! After my past experience with miserable staff, I must admit these few folk should be given gold stars! They were extremely helpful and always friendly! Again, the view is great and the gym is excellent and their staff is so pleasant (you should move them to the front desk!!). Now the real reason for the negative review... FIRST, the parking here is horrible! There is one lot that is closest to the hotel which seemed to be closed for the whole 2 weeks! There are a couple of cars parked there and there is no construction. So you have to park out in a dirt lot and walk through a dimly lit parking lot to get to the hotel. It's worse that there was a huge conference going on, so you have even less parking! Half the lot is used by valet parking and is NEVER full! So if you are paying $20 a day to park, I don't really expect to have to walk at night across a dimly lit lot that seemed quite far away! SECOND, I had the same problem as one of the previous guests with the smoke smell. I came back to my room one night and there was a VERY strong smell of cigarette smoke in my room. I opened the balcony thinking maybe it was there, but it wasn't from outside. I called down and security came up and said that it was probably someone walking by a vent smoking and it came into my room. Isn't the hotel non-smoking??? And it didn't go away and they told me that if I could see a guest smoking that I can report it...so should I have gone knocking on all the doors hoping to catch someone in the act?? It never got better, so they moved me to another room....exactly what I wanted to do...pack up my things at 10pm and change rooms! THIRD, the rooms are very tired. For such an expensive room, you expect better than 2-star hotel quality. The sink backed up constantly and even worse when you could hear another room running water it would come up in our sink! FOURTH, there was a big party going on one Friday night down in the parking lot tent...no problem, but if I close my windows I shouldn't feel the whole room shaking on the 12th floor! I called down to see when it would stop and they said midnight! I went down to ask if they could maybe turn the bass down...no chance, but there were 2 employees at the desk. As I walked off, one said to the other in a short tone, "What did she want? She's already called down once about that." Wouldn't you think that after a long week of work that you should be able to sleep before midnight? I think this will definitely be my last stay at this hotel. I am a Starwood fan, but this one does NOT fit the standards of even their lower star hotels! I am going to have to switch to another brand when staying in San Diego from now one so that I don't have to write another one of these reviews!

My husband and I selected this property because we wanted to take our dog along and I wanted it to be in proximity to the hotel that was hosting the conference. This place was bad enough that we might have to leave the dog at home next time! First, the buildings are tired and decrepit. There was a crack in the sink, the light fixture in the bathroom took two or three minutes to warm up enough to provide light, and one of the bedside lamps required a phone call to maintenance on our first night there. Some of the staff were nice enough, but several were downright surly. When my husband went back to the front desk to find out why we were only given a AAA discount for one night of our stay and why we had been charged twice for one movie, the desk clerk tried to rescind the discount for the one night we had received it! We did have a nice, albeit expensive meal seated out on the patio behind the lobby. However, none of the staff could figure out how to light the propane heaters during our meal so I had to go into the gift shop and buy a jacket for each of us for dinner. There is a charge for the internet in your room and for parking. Corporate America's mantra these days seems to be to hook you with the promise of cheap prices and then burn you once you commit. In Corporate America's mind, the old bait and switch still works. Charging $20/day for a guest to park at your hotel is an outrage. What did they think? That we wouldn't be bringing a car? Tell us the real price of staying at your hotel and charge us that price and then we'll leave satisfied. However, tell us one price, load on the extra charges and we're not likely to return. It must be something about the Starwood properties...I haven't had a very good experience with any of them. I should have stuck with my initial plan of staying at the Omni downtown. For an extra $60 a night, we probably would have had a dog friendly room with much better service.

<Title>“very nice hotel, good experience”
<Content>Stayed here for one night as the Westin Horton Plaza was booked and I also wanted to be close to the airport. This hotel is literally across the highway from the airport, a 5 minute cab or shuttle ride (although the shuttle takes time waiting for others). They have constructed the hotel so that all rooms face the bay or marina and none is facing the airport. I heard absolutely no airport noise. Check in was fast and friendly, stop to greet the numerous and fabulous fish in their tropical tank. I felt the hotel was in pretty good, if not excellent, shape. The room was nice and spacious with a little balcony with a table and chairs. All standard SPG amenities are to be found as well as Starbucks coffee pods for the automatic brew. The shades are perfect for blacking out the room and the bed was standard (i.e. excellent) SPG sweet sleeper. I had a beer and empanadas at the bar, nothing special, in fact the empanadas were a bit dry, but I didn't complain since I was tired arriving at 9pm from NYC. The hotel restaurant and lounges were plenty busy and people were smiling, not sure if it was the Final Four or the food. There were plenty of weights and machines in the gym and it was not crowded for a Sat morning when there aren't too many people awake at 0700. The pool was nice and heated and would be very nice on a hot day. Signage to the gym could be improved as they get you in the right direction and then cease to exist, leaving you (me) wandering the floor hoping to trip into the gym. The location is good if you want to be close to the airport, but I can see how it would be a pain for those hoping to see San Diego. It's only 5-10 minutes to downtown, but this means a $10 cab ride each time you go in and then have to return. Walking would be a nice choice if you have 30-40 minutes, but there's a sidewalk along the bay with a great view.

<Title>“Cockroach in our room”
<Content>We just came back from staying here because we had too. First, we tried to cancel our room and move but note that you have to cancel a week prior to your stay. The hotel charges you for your whole stay a week prior to your stay. Second my husband was speaking at a conference there at the hotel. I should of know at that time this will be an interesting stay. It started out that I thought they had 24 hour shuttle service to the hotel. They don’t!! We got in late waited for the shuttle as instructed when I called to confirm my resevation. They did not bother to tell me that it does not run after midnight. They were aware that we were checking in late. We took a taxi over to the hotel. No big deal it was 7.00 with tip. It took less than 5 min. We checked into our first room at 12am and it smelled like a bar with horribly stained carpet. Looked like someone spilt bleach all over the floor. My thought was to try to cover up the smell of a bar. We moved at that time to another room on the 12th floor. Security was nice and helped us move. We moved to the "new" room instantly and there was a cockroach in the bathroom. Security was still there and took care of the cockroach but they could not move us again because of the conference was taking up the whole hotel. We tried to move hotels but we would still have to pay 250.00 a night (we were there for 4 nights). The next morning we woke up to another cockroach in the bathroom. We let them know they explained that happens at times. Yuck!!!!!! We are paying how much a night!!! Housekeeping can in a great job of cleaning and we did not see another one. The third night the whole room filled up with cigarette smoke at 3am. Someone down below us was smoking in the bathroom and because at night the circulation slows down the cigarette smoke went into our room through the vent in the bathroom. Again called front desk no one came up or even got a call from anyone that they even cared that we could smell smoke. My husband is sensitive to cigarette smoke and it was irritating. Again when we check in they made us sign that we will not smoke in the hotel or on the balcony but no follow through. The next day during the day I went down a spoke to one of the front desk people. He stated he would give us a comp day for the unconvinced of the cockroaches and smoke. An hour later he called and could not comp a whole night so he credit our portfolio with just 100.00 credit and a pass to the club house for Hord’oeuvres and breakfast. That was really nice of them but we had dinner and breakfast at the conference provided for us. I don’t think this was fair but what else you are going to do except let everyone else know that it may look clean but know this hotel has a problem with cockroaches and let others make the decision to stay here. If you do make a reservation check out that you cannot get out of your reservation if you do find a cockroach. The positive thing is the pool was really nice.

<Title>“Stay here only if you have no other choice”
<Content>I am writing this as I sit in my dingy hotel room waiting for my TV to "warm up" so I can catch the news/weather. I turned it on about 20 minutes ago and it is still not playing. I am in the Linai section of the hotel - which is probably the older section of the hotel - if that is possible. My room is available to anyone that wants to walk up to it becasue my door leads to the outside. I asked several times for a room change but the hotel is booked becasue of the conference that I am attending. I explained to them thaht as a single female I feel very unsafe. The staff was nice but unable to change my room which I can also hear every plane that takes off. Make sure you pack your sleep aid! I was really excited to see San Diego but the hotel is so far from downtown that I might as well be in middle America. If you have to stay here - try to stay in the main section of the hotel - it might be a little nicer. I am stuck here for a conferenc with no other choice.

<Title>“Nice Place”
<Content>Very convenient for the airport and easy access for the city bus lines if needed. Great views of the bay and the sail boat harbor. Sort of out of the way for the city proper though as its too far to walk. Room was perfect. No complaints. There are really two hotels here or at least two distinct buildings. Enjoy yourself.

<Title>“Not the best choice in San Diego”
<Content>I recently went to a conference at this hotel and found it adequate but not inspiring. As others have pointed out, this hotel is very isolated. It would definitely not be my first choice if I were in San Diego on vacation. The cab ride into town is about $12 each way. That adds a hefty price to the cost of a meal. We took the cab on the first night but then explored Harbor Island on foot the second day. There are 3 other restaurants on the island - one is exorbitantly priced and the other two are average quality seafood restaurants (the Lighthouse at the very end and the Boathouse). They are an easy walk from the hotel. Regarding the quality of the hotel: We stayed in the West Tower (the smaller of the two) which was a 7-10 minute hike from the conference facilities. The walk was pleasant, along the marina and provide a little exercise at the start of the day. The first room we were assigned was facing the airport (marina side) and that's where you could hear every plane take off. We quickly changed to a room facing the bay side, which was much quieter. The view from the balcony was quite nice and peaceful; you could see the Coronado bridge and downtown San Diego. In the room, the furnishings were typical but the bed was not comfortable. After 5 nights, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The bathroom toilet flushed with a very loud noise (kind of like the newer toilets on an airplane) - not a big deal until your neighbor flushed there's in the middle of the night and you heard it in your room. The other complaint is the inconsistency of the shuttle bus. It was great to have a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel; but, the shuttle was supposed to take you from one building to the other. There was no schedule so you could wait quite a while for it. Generally we walked but later at night, we didn't want to walk in the dark along the water so we waited and waited.

<Title>“This hotel has nothing going for it”
<Content>I just returned from a conference at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. Frankly I'm amazed at how high it rates on TripAdvisor. Either the staff is being paid to write trumped up reviews or the folks who visit this hotel just don't get out much. For reference, I was in the East (main) tower. On the positive, the restaurant and bar side of the house did a superb job. The food was great and the wine list was even better. That's where the positive comments end. First, the location. For someone visiting San Diego, you either want to be downtown where the action is, or far enough out that you can get free parking and drive to the local attractions. The Sheraton has neither. It's not walking distance to ANYTHING. Someone in the elevator who did have a car commented that the valet charge was $29/day. Further on location, forget having a quite night's sleep here. To the north is Lindberg Field. To the Southwest is North Island, a major US Navy air station. To the Southeast is the main Coast Guard station. Between the civil, military, and coastguard planes and helecopters there's almost no time of the day when there isn't a loud drone or roar occuring with great frequency. My room was small and old. The fixtures in the bathroom were at least 30 years old and one of the tiles in the floor was completely detatched - I could have dug it out with a pocket knife. Bathroom fan - forget it. The sliding door to my balcony fit so poorly that wind blew freely into the room. The noise from the aformentioned aircraft combined with the drone of the air condition units that my room overlooked made sleep an impossibility. One of the few redeeming features might have been the Starbucks. I went in one morning and ordered a Syrup Cream - a fairly standard menu item. The people working there didn't have a clue what I was talking about. When I pointed out that it was a standard Starbucks menu item, they pointed at their menu board and managed to get out enough broken english to tell me that they only knew how to make what was on that board - nothing else. As for process and procedure - the hotel was pittiful. Hotel guide book (binder) in my room was so incomplete it was all but useless. It gave menus for the main restaurant, but not the other two. There was no map of the complex so for the third restaurant that was in the west tower, I didn't even know what it was or where it was. It mentioned the pool, but didn't give the hours. When I pointed these items out to the concierge (two of them on two different locations), I was given the same stupid response - "Perhaps they did it that way because they want you to come down and interact with us!".

<Title>“Major Disappointment”
<Content>I was assigned a room in the Lanai section of the hotel. It's not in the main hotel building. The rooms in that section are old and gross. The first room that I was assigned had a really loud fan in the bathroom and the room had not been cleaned. I checked in at 9pm. The shower had been obviously been used and there was still trash in the room. The second room I was assigned had been cleaned, but the bathroom walls and ceiling were moldy. The vanity was stained and chipped. I stayed at the hotel for 4 days for a conference. During my stay, I found centipede-like bugs in my room twice. For the price the hotel charges for these rooms, I would have expected something nicer. The only thing redeeming about my stay was that the staff was nice. I would definitely not recommend this hotel.

<Title>“great staff, dirty hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this hotel for business reasons. The hotel staff was fantastic, although the girl at the front desk who checked us in wasn’t the friendliest person--she wasn’t too bad. The bellhop who helped us with our bags was really nice, and later during our stay my friends and I used the concierge several times and were treated great. They were very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. Also, the valets were great--giving us bottled water every morning to take on our sightseeing trips, great ideas on where to shop, etc. I loved the lobby, there was a Starbuck’s (a real plus for me), a nice gift shop, and there was a beautiful aquarium, also a really nice area for business—computers, etc. All in all the first floor is great. Now on to the guest rooms--the rooms were a bit shabby. The bathrooms were small. Everything was in need of paint and wallpaper, and they really need some new soft beds. Ours was as hard as a rock! So while we were not too impressed with the rooms, on the plus side--they had Starbuck’s coffee in the room, also a nice little balcony with 2 chairs so that depending on which side of the hotel you were on, you could enjoy either a beautiful sunrise or sunset. We had a city view and loved it. Be advised though of the airport noise, it can’t be avoided, but it does stop between midnight and 6:00 am.

<Title>“Probably one of the worst places to stay in San Diego”
<Content>Only stayed here because a conference I was at was here - otherwise if this is YOUR money and you are on vacation, please do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere. First off, this property is ooooold compared to other major hotels in the San Diego area, the rooms in the marina tower are tiny and the while the front desk tries their best to trick you into staying at the Bay Towers (about 1/2 mile away) where the rooms are supposed to be 30% bigger, those rooms are even OLDER (if you can believe it). It's like stepping into a run down 1980's movie set. And while the rooms are bigger, the furniture size didn't increase and the room is poorly laid out so that you have big blank spaces of wall and carpet where there really should have been something else. First floors in the Bay Towers where I got shunted too (after expressing obtaining a reservation for the Marina Towers) faced the parking lot so any crazy person could just cross from the parking lot into your room if you left the balconey door open. Surprisingly enough someone in the conference said that the hotel cleaning staff or room service had come in, unlocked the balconey door and not fully closed the front door - how scary is that??!!! Front desk was rude too - when I pointed out that I had PAID for a reservation for the Marina Towers she said - sorry they had given up my room and there was no choice. I wasn't late or anything for check in. I was shocked! Parking at the Marina Towers is a bit nuts if there is a conference in town, they are doing some sort of construction on the parking lot (what I'm not sure - since i never saw anyone actually doing anything) but it's basically a dusty dirt lot with very NARROW parking spaces. There is not enough parking in the self lot (again if conference in town which usually there is), so you see lots of cars just circling around stalking people. Also it's not a very close walk from the self parking lot to the Marina towers. The parking at Bay Towers is a lot better - but then you're away from all the action. There is no gift shop yet at the bay towers (they're building it) and I didn't remember seeing any business center either - remember everything is really headquartered at Marina Towers. The good news at both towers. 1) Noise - while you're pretty much right next to the airport the noise inside your room is pretty much not there 2) Parking - it's $20 but for in and out privileges so that's not too bad for hotel parking. Good luck for anyone risking a stay here on their own dime.

<Title>“A Joy Ride for your Expense Account”
<Content>My husband had a business meeting in San Diego and asked me to join him and make it into a mini-vacation. Arrangements were made by his associates at a special rate; hence I can't quote the usual price of this room. However, I would consider it to be run-of-the-house and standard. That said, it was fine. This should be considered a business hotel, rather than a vacation property. The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina is one of two in the area in close proximity to Lindbergh Field, the San Diego International Airport. It is so close that one could practically walk there from the airport. We rented a car, though the hotel provides shuttles. The drive to the airport from the hotel is probably no more than five minutes. Though the location makes for a convenient launching point for San Diego activities, visitors should keep in mind that planes fly low over downtown San Diego creating a frequent roar of jet engines up above. The airport appears to close about midnight and not reopen until an early, but not unreasonable time the next morning. The planes are heard and seen from the hotel but didn't create a problem for us; they might for some. The hotel has over 1,000 rooms, all having balconys. Our room was what I would consider of an average size with two double beds and was comfortble enough for our adult daughter to spend two nights with us. It was tastefully decorated and all furniture, bedcoverings, etc. were crisp and clean upon our arrival. However, the view from this room was so enchanting that even a lesser appearing room would have gotten a thumbs-up here. The hotel faces San Diego Bay and our room had a glorious view of the city skyline and a great expanse of the bay. The room's small balcony with its table and two chairs was a class spot to enjoy your morning coffee while viewing the many sailboats and other vessels passing by. And as if to complement the daytime view, the San Diego night time brought on the city lights and a mad search for the proper camera exposure to capture them. The room was equipped with a television, clock-radio and a very simple little coffee maker that was fine for tea but questionable for coffee. For that ,management apparently wanted us to go into one of the hotel's restaurants. The room was also Internet equipped and the user would be connected for $11.95 a day. There was a stocked refrigerator in the room carrying sodas ($3.00), small waters ($3.50), Rice Krispies Treats ($4.00) and the like, "all prices subject to a 20% restocking fee." We passed on this little Sheraton moneymaker. We were all thankful for our cellular phones here because Sheraton fiercely guards outgoing calls from its rooms. They charge $2.00 for access per local call, up to 60 minutes per call with .10 per each additional minute beyonyd that first hour. Toll free calls will set you back the same as above. Want operator assistance, or making a credit card call? It's all the same to these folks. If you need to call long distance your prices will be that much higher. Bring your cell! The hotel has a few restaurants and we dined at Quinn's, a casual sports bar offering adult sandwiches (no pb&j on the menu, though I am certain they would oblige if requested) such as the marinated skirt steak on a ciabatta roll which I had and a very fat pastrami sandwich selected by a friend. They had a wide assortment of appetizers and some nice main dish salads and the requisite soup for a seaside community, clam chowder. Prices were about what you would expect in a city hotel, with the chowder at $8.00 for an average sized bowl. Food was well prepared. As a full-service hotel, in-room dining is also offered, but be prepared for the food prices to be pumped up with Sheraton's version of thinking of its patrons' comfort (tongue in cheek here). The in-room menu reads "For your convenience a 19% service charge and a $3.00 delivery charge will be added automatically." However, if this is not a determent then a very nice selection of foods is offered. Aside from a bank of computers in the lobby available to guests without charge, we did not use any of the other commercial offerings, but I did investigate what was available A "Smart Office" is set up with a computer, printer, speaker phone, scanner, fax etc. at $75.00/hr. This room is described as being appropriate for small meetings and interviews and has a capacity for up to four people. They have a spa and fitness center for a $10.00 daily fee for hotel guests. Various spa treatments are available and the center is equipped with cardiovascular equipment and body machines. Neither a hair salon nor manicurist was in the list of services. There is a small store selling the usual hotel merchandise and snacks but don't expect to find any semblance of solid nutrition (a bagel, for instance) there. Again, they want you in their restaurants so they can sell that bagel for $6.00. Everyone we met at this hotel, from check-in personnel, to wait staff, to maintenance, was extraordinarily nice. Apparently Sheraton takes the time to select and train its people and it shows. No complaints there! Beware of their parking arrangement. They charge $20/day for hotel parking, more for valet. An adjacent open lot charges $4.00 per hour and the charges just keep accruing. Check before you park so you won't be surprised. In conclusion, this is a pleasant place to stay, especially for the business traveller. The property is smart, food is good, and the location is great.

<Title>“Excellent! Superb service.”
<Content>I absolutely loved my stay here. Some have noted the proximity of the airport. This did not bother me. What makes this hotel one of the best i've ever stayed at? it's the people. the service was beyond compare. for example, i arrived after 24 hours of travelling to find that i hadn't booked to arrive that day but the next day. however they assured me they'd take care of me, and gave me a room - at the special conference rate, which they didn't need to do as the special rate actually only started the next day. everyone referred to me by name, and when i returned from sightseeing or shopping, the concierge would ask how my day went. little touches. my wish was their command (or so they made me feel)... there was a one cup brewer in my room to make a cup of starbucks coffee if i wanted. there was a beautiful airy breakfast room, with a view of the harbour, and the friendliest staff starting your day with their smiles and upbeat service. to me this matters a lot. i never take the US style customer service for granted - if you've lived or travelled in europe you'll understand. the bed must be mentioned. i have never slept on such a comfortable hotel bed before - with a choice of pillow types and the most comfortable linen and duvet. i took a taxi downtown, but figured out how to use the bus and trolley system for getting around and back to the hotel... which saved a lot of money. i attended a conference here which was great fun and the hotel, once again, made it memorable.

<Title>“Liked this Hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina from 12/25-12/31. In general, we were very pleased with the hotel. From the outside, it looked very nice. It was very close to the airport, so that was convenient as well. We did frequently see and hear planes going overhead every few minutes. It didn't bother us at all, but others might be more sensitive to that. The plane noise never disturbed us during the night either. The hotel room was nice. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The rug seemed a little bit worn, but that wasn't a big deal. We had a balcony over looking the pool area. In the evening, they often had hot cider in the lobby. I thought that was a nice touch. The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was the computer availability. It was great that they offered free internet use, however, they only had about 6 computers for hundreds of guests. Most of the time they weren't even all in service. That was frustrating! Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel. It was clean, conveniently located, and affordable. If we head back out to San Diego in the future, we will definitely consider staying here again.

<Title>“Not great....”
<Content>I suppose my expectations were a bit high, but I was pretty dissapointed. I was here for a conference at the hotel, so didn't have to worry about traveling away from the hotel. On the positive, the shuttle from the airport to the hotel went fine. It was only when I got to the hotel.... First, the guy who checked me in didn't ask what kind of room I needed and I ended up in a room with 2 small beds rather than 1 king. That's the least bothersome aspect of my experience, but still slightly annoying considering everything else. When I got to my room (which was in a great location overlooking the pool and marina) I searched high and low to find the information binder so I knew how late the restaurants and pool were open. I finally called the front desk to ask for one, and the one I got had whole sections missing! They must not pay attention to these things.... I also asked for my desk chair to be replaced because the chair was so gross I didn't want to sit on it. The seat and back were full of stains and other grime, and there was grime on the armrests. Gross. The housekeeping lady gave me a little hassle about the request, but ultimately got me a new chair, which was slightly less gross than the first one. I did find out how late the pool and hot tube were open, by the way. The hot tub was not nearly as hot as it should have been, and the nasty smell of cigerette butts all over the ground around the tub took much away from the experience. The shower also wasn't great. The shower head was old and difficult to change the stream. The string that goes across the shower to hang wet clothes was completely missing. My final complaint: who hangs mirrors (or other glass) over the bed in an earthquake zone?????? I've only been living in an earthquake zone (San Francisco) for less than 2 years, but even I know better! Bottom line: The hotel is decent, and at first glance the room is nice. And the room was quiet, which is definitely important. However, I think what makes a nice hotel (especially for business travel) is paying attention to the details. This hotel does not pay attention to the details, and the overall experience of staying here reflects that. I'm glad I wasn't paying for this room, and unless required for work again, I won't stay here again.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>I just spent a few nights at the Sheraton Harbor Island and had a very nice time. The Hotel lobby was very nice and the staff VERY helpful. The rooms were nice, but could use a little updating, but overall quite nice. The pools looked great, we only ate at Quinns, the food was good (its like a sports bar) but it was quite loud. Overall we had a great time and would definitley go back.

<Title>“Awful”
<Content>I just got back from four nights at this hotel, and it was terrible. When I checked in, the room I was sent to was not clean. It clearly had not been vacuumed in some time, and there were shoe prints in the dirt on the bathroom floor. The woman at the front desk was very nice, and I switched to a different room. It turns out the second room was on the "airport" side. Clearly the noise would have been less had the sliding door to the balcony sealed, which it did not, letting in breeze, noise and airplane exhaust. When I asked in the morning if I could switch to the other side, I was told I had been moved up to a "deluxe" room, as though I was lucky to be there. (It was the same size room, two floors up. "Deluxe" must have meant "vacuumed".) The burger I ordered medium well from room service was completely raw inside, the shower only gave lukewarm water, dishes piled on carts in the hall remained there all day, and the room was never vacuumed through my stay. If I had not been staying for a conference, I certainly would not have stayed. It is a shame- I have stayed at the same hotel several times, beginning nearly 20 years ago. It is a nice property, but there if I wanted a hotel where you feel you have to wear your shoes all the time, I would have stayed somewhere cheaper.

<Title>“Don't stay here - too noisy!”
<Content>Horribly noisy hotel. You would think that a hotel across the street from the airport would have noise remediation but the walls were even thinner than usual. The decor is nice, and the staff is friendly and efficient, but you will not get any sleep here. The views of the harbor from both sides are utterly destroyed by the noise of the airplanes. You also hear everything your neighbors are doing (I mean, EVERYTHING). Not pleasant. My room smelled of body odor that wasn't mine. I was not able to get any sleep at all. Most egregious was the energy-efficient thermostat. You could only manually get the fan to blow on high for five minutes, then it switches automatically to "auto." So, no hope for white noise to drown out the other noises.

<Title>“Newly Renovated Waterfront Hotel”
<Content>This is a large scale Hotel on the Marina at Shelter Island. It has a blue white and red nautical motif in the large lobby complete with massive salt water aquarium. There is an open wi-fi area overlooking the boats/marina,and several different types of flavored water greeting the arrival of its jogging clients. The food at the lobby bar is basically pub type fare. The rooms are clean and bright with flat screen tv's and baconies with great views. In my opinion this is one of the nicer sheratons. It has an incredible fitness center and large pool area.

<Title>“Outstanding!!”
<Content>Stayed four nights for a conference. The hotel is directly across Harbor Drive from the airport. There was some airport noise, but from my room it was minimal. I highly recommend that someone planning to stay here sign up for the Starwood Preferred Guest program as they seem to provide a whole floor for members. I really liked getting the two liters of complementary water every day--beats paying the normally exhorbitant prices! They also had coffee and tea in the elevator lobby on this floor. A nice touch. I stayed in the East tower in a corner room furthest from the airport, which partly explains the low aircraft noise. I had a balcony overlooking San Diego harbor and was able to watch the sun set over Point Loma as well as watch ships coming in and leaving from the Pacific. Pretty cool. Beds were very comfortable, the cleaning staff wonderful and the downstairs staff very friendly and approachable. Parking is a bit steep, but I believe it is true anywhere downtown. Took five minutes to get to the freeways, maybe ten to get to Gaslamp Quarter. Overall a great stay and I highly recommend it!

<Title>“"This is not a soccer hotel" our daughter said!”
<Content>Our family travels to San Diego frequently for Club soccer tournaments. Usually, we stay in "Hotel Circle", since we usually are travelling w/ 16-20 other families & those hotels usally offer the best group rates. THIS year though, we were fortunate enough to get a competitive rate here at the Sheraton ($120 a night + tax) and loved it! Some of our team had the cottage style rooms facing the small marina. This is great. for those families that don't like the feel of a large hotel. We were lucky enough to have a room on the 7th floor with fantastic city views, views of Coronado bridge, the cruise ships, the harbor, the aircraft carriers, and incoming planes! yes, there was some slight noise from planes taking off but since we usually stay in chaotic hotel circle, this noise didn't bother us & our 9 yr. old daughter was entertained for hours watching planes land and take off. The front desk was very helpful. The concierge was even better! The girls there helped us find a nearby restaurant that wasn't over run with tourists & could handle a crowd within an hour. They called ahead & made reservatiosn for us twice, were very knowledgeable about locations & streets and were quick to hand us detailed maps & highlighted our driving directions. We highly reccomend the main restaurant for breakfast especially...that was the only meal we ate there & it was really fresh and worth the hotel price. It felt very decadent over looking the marina. Served on contemporary dishes, it made the toast even look gourmet!! It was great tasting, very fresh and the service was friendly. We definitely will return to this hotel in the future. Tcleary

<Title>“Great for a priceline deal!”
<Content>After bidding $90 for a 4 star hotel in downtown San Diego, I was a little concerned that we would get a pretty lousy place. I was very surprised...first of all, they put us in the West Tower, which is farthest away from the airport. The room had a beautiful marina view, and the furnishings were great. The bed wad very comfortable and the room was good sized. I would definitely stay here again, especially for the price.

<Title>“Great Hotel!”
<Content>We recently stayed 5 nights at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. It was our first trip to San Diego and this hotel was responsible for us falling in love with the city. The concierge was very helpful in sending us out on day excursions based on our interests and overall the staff was very friendly. The breakfast buffet at $20 was worth every penny - the food was fabulous and the view of the bay made it even better. The pool, the hot tub, and the workout facility were all top notch. If you are a jogger, you will love the scenic trail that will take you all the way downtown with a harbor view the entire run. Will definitely stay at this hotel in future trips to SD.

<Title>“Excellent hotel”
<Content>I stayed here three nights after a cruise. Was given room 5207 in the Lanai area. This is a four storey building connected to the East Wing and has its own pool and hottub. This is a very nice hotel. The gardens and pool areas are beautiful. You have the marina on one side and the harbour on the other. A free shuttle takes you to the airport and from there you can take the bus downtown. The walk to the airport only takes 5 - 10 minutes. I paid US$119 per night for single occupancy (total $402.86 including taxes) . Lobby has free internet computers. Buffet breakfast was $21. Expensive but excellent. I would certainly stay here again. andrew

<Title>“All around great hotel”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from a four night stay at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We had no trouble locating the hotel shuttle bus at the airport and were assisted with our bags by a very friendly and helpful driver. Upon reaching our reserved room in the east tower we discovered that we were not given the king bed we had requested. A call to Thomas at the front desk was all it took to be reassigned a beautiful 7th floor room in the west tower. My husband and I expected a certain amount of airport noise but we were delighted to find that the room was actually quiet and peaceful. The room was very clean, updated, and comfortable with a fantastic water view. One morning we enjoyed the delicious breakfast buffet overlooking the harbor and met with friends in the evening on the outdoor patio for drinks and a light supper. Service seems to be a priority at this property, both in the restaurants and the hotel itself. The shuttle drivers were exceptional, very informative, and cheerful. The desk staff and even the housekeepers always greeted us with a smile. We felt as though we were special guests during our stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

<Content>we stayed here for 5 nights [tue to sunday] in oct07 and loved it. got a room in west tower on 7th floor. had a view of the bay and planes landing [no the noise was not that bad!] staff was GREAT in every way. internet in lobby free for 45 minutes each time you log in, lots of people use it. pool and hot tub were very clean,etc and felt great. ate at the sports bar a couple of times and service was very good and the view of the boats was nice. ate breakfeast at a local deli called Papananis between West and East towers every morning with the "locals". Very good food and good prices. Was a great way to start our day. Parking was $20/day with in/out access. The parking was billed on our room bill. Booked thru Expedia and room rate was discounted a LOT because we stayed 5 days. We were VERY pleased with the 5 day rate! Hotel is so close to attractions that driving was never a issue as in 20 minutes we could be to most trourist spots. We would come back anytime!!

<Title>“Nice but,,,,”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in Sept. The hotel is across from the Airport. We stayed at the West tower, newer than the East tower but it show's it's wear. I received a reduced rate due to a Conference at the hotel. The view from the hotel is great! A bit loud starting @6:30 A.M. this is when the planes start taking off from the San Airport, from the West tower is is tollerable. Upon arriving they put us in the East tower, even though I had a King bed in the West reserved, I said OK as long as I could get a King(none avaialable) we ended up in the West with a king. The room was OK, but stains on the Carpet and the bathroom was not cleaned(not good). Went to the front desk, told them they said they would take care of it(they never did), The next day(evening) we came back to the room finding the lock on the floor, it feel off the door(it is the security lock that is swong over, not the main door handle lock. This was fixed in about 1 hour, they used platic inserts to fill the stripped screw holes and bigger screws. The bathroom had tiles missing and plaster on the floor. lighting is terrible!!! The good: resteraunts are excellent and the View, The bad: you are stuck in the middle of Harbor Island, you will need a cab to go to Old town, or gaslamp($15) each way, it's worth it. We the consumers are paying allot for rooms that are below par,,we should complain!!! I did send them an email,,,but no reply yet.... The Sheraton is squizing every dollar out of this place!!!

<Title>“Very nice”
<Content>We were invited to an event that required spending the night. We were very pleasantly surprised by how nice the property is, especially for the price. We were automatically upgraded to a suite overlooking the marina. Our room was spacious, the bathroom was on the smaller side & we had a flat screen TV. The room was clean & staff was courteous. We didn't experience too much airport noise even though it is in close proximity. If we'd paid more I would have expected a lot more.

<Title>“They should rename to Airport Sheraton”
<Content>I stayed two nights at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. They should rename this hotel to the Airport Sheraton because you are RIGHT NEXT TO THE AIRPORT. Don't get me wrong, the hotel was nice inside, but if you are outside by the pool or restaurant, you hear the planes taking off every couple of minutes. I mean LOUD! They had a jamaican band playing by the pool to drown out the airplane noise but it still was LOUD. Not very relaxing by the pool. And if you have your balacony door open (which I like to sleep with the door open at night instead of air conditioning), then expect the noise from the airplanes. The hotel lobby was nice, the bed was very comfortable and the concierge level was nice too. Not excellent but just nice. I wouldn't stay here again. It would work more as a business hotel close to the airport but definitely not a weekend pleasure trip.

<Title>“Not what I had hoped for.”
<Content>We stayed at this Sheraton in Aug 2007. I do not think it is as nice as other Sheratons we have stayed in. The place is huge and upon first entering our room everything looked clean and very nice. After taking a shower I was disgusted to find I picked up hair balls on my feet walking from the bathroom to the bed. Quite a chunk of hairball, I might add. Sometimes a "rotten egg" odor would come from the bathroom and hang around for about 15 minutes. I assume the order came from the sink drains or bath drain. We could hear every word the people in the adjoining rooms were saying. Oddly, we could not hear the typical banging of hotel doors. The elevators worked very well. This is a huge hotel and whoever takes care of the elevators should be congradulated. The self parking worked ok. I believe it is $20 per night. The parking attendants let you in, then let you out. This is fine in a location where parking fees are normally steep anyway. The hotel looked very clean and we had a balcony room on a high floor with a good view. A few days after we checked out I received a master card charge for about $4.50 for a bottle of drinking water we did not open in the room. All in all, I will go back to staying at the Best Western on Harbor Drive. The parking there is free, the quick breakfast there is free, there are balcony view rooms, I can pick up the same hairballs on my feet, and I have never been charged for services I did not order. And the Bestwestern is probably half the price.

<Title>“Nice Hotel...if you get a good price!”
<Content>Had a nice July stay at this hotel. We received a very good rate and stayed in the West Tower. I would not recommend the West Tower for families with young children. The walk to the East Tower does get old for the little ones. The East Tower has a much nicer lobby and is generally the hub of this hotel. The pool area is much nicer in the East Tower. The West Tower is a bit of a walk from the East Tower and it might as well be called a completely different hotel. The rooms are bigger, but the West Hotel does not have the more "upscale feel" of the East Tower. If you are a family traveling or have folks in your party with mobility issues....definitely request the East Tower. You will find the nice restaurants, lounges, pools and other amenities in the East Tower.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>I have stayed at this property several times and each time my stay has been great. I have not had any trouble with airport noise and the accomodations are far superior to what I would expect of a Sheraton. Every hotel staff person that I encountered was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel highly. If you are not traveling for business, the location is a bit secluded and you will need to take a cab into the downtown area as it is several miles to walk there and you would need to walk on a busy street. If you rent a car, the parking fees at the hotel are a bit steep as well. Overall, excellt experience!

<Content>The Sheraton Hotel and Marina was a wonderful hotel. It is located close to the airport so it was quick and easy to get to after our flight. There were planes flying overhead, but it didn't bother us. The hotel is in a great location. Downtown is 5 minutes away and the 1-5 is 5 to 10 minutes away so you had quick access to all the major attractions (ie Sea World (great) and Coronado Island (lovely)) The rooms are well designed and maintained and the best part is the Sheraton sleeper bed.

<Title>“Customer Service Lacking, lovely hotel grounds”
<Content>This hotel is perfect if you're traveling for business and attending a conference. It is far from perfect if you are traveling for pleasure/vacation. My boyfriend and I were visiting San Diego for a wedding and decided to book through hotwire.com. We landed the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. I had read reviews on trip advisor that the west tower had bigger, updated rooms but was further from the action and that the east tower was closer to everything but with smaller "lanai" rooms. When we arrived at the hotel (east tower) we were told that we were actually staying in the West Tower. I asked to be switched to an East Tower high room but was told that the hotel was overbooked and I should be happy I even have a room! (Nice, right?). So we drove over to the west tower, parked the car ($20 per night!), and unloaded our bags to find out that we were actually staying at the east tower. So we had to gather our things back to the car and drive over to the east tower where we were basically ignored to find our way to our room without any help with our luggage. The lack of organization and service was very disappointing. There was a large Enterprise convention going on at the hotel and it seems the staff was too busy helping those on business to help us out. We were given a subpar Lanai room on the 2nd floor with a less than stellar view. There is no safe in the room and water is $4.00. The room itself was standard. One of the restaurants was closed while we were there for the Enterprise convention. A cab ride to the Gaslamp district was about $15.00 with tip. The pool at the east tower is really nice. We never had to worry about finding a lounge chair and the view of the harbor is beautiful. At check out we were charged for 4 nights of parking even though we only had a car for one night. Ultimately I felt that the money we saved by booking through hotwire would have been better spent on a hotel closer to downtown. I will not stay here again and do not recommend it to travelers. I would recommend the hotel to people looking for a conference spot.

<Title>“Disappointment at the San Diego Sheraton Marina”
<Content>This hotel's location so close to the airport creates way too much noise. Being on the waterfront with all the beautiful boats was nice, and the resort is physically attractive, but it is isolated from the city, and the constant airplane noise was really intrusive. Flights began before dawn, waking my spouse; I woke at 7:30 when the hotel staff began leaf-blowing in the parking lot under our window. The lobby restaurant in the East tower had fine views, but their prices were steep and the food was good but not great. The breakfast buffet was much better than dinner and offered some unusual touches: cheese blintzes and a multi-layered egg torta with several fillings. Good stuff. The staircase between floors was ugly and institutional, making it easy to opt for the elevator, even to go down just a single flight to my son's room. It's a shame they are stuck with this mixed bag of a location: a pretty marina and swimming pools, but an ugly, noisy airport right across the way.

<Title>“Best Hotel Experience Ever”
<Content>Long story short I loved my stay so much this is what I emailed to Sheraton directly: I recently stayed at your hotel for a 5 night 6 day conference that was taking place at the San Diego Convention Center. I must say that this hotel is the best hotel I have EVER stayed in my entire life. I've stayed at a many places in New York, Rome, Chicago, Florida, Newport etc everything from the Millineum in Manhattan to the Ritz in Sarasota. From the moment we got there by the Sheraton airport shuttle our stay was magnificent. I brought my girlfriend with me on this business trip because I had a feeling it would soon turn to pleasure. Everything about your hotel is fantastic. The gigantic pool(s) is amazing and the courtesy of the serving staff out there is impeccable. Particularly a guy named Steve working at the Shoreline resteraunt. That guy had the whole place smiling and laughing. The Harbor Inn Resteraunt breakfasts were some of the best Ive had in awhile. Quinns was excellent. The best martinis and the food was great. The room was perfect maid service perfect. The ladies at the Concierge Desk were the most polite people I think Ive ever met! They were such a great help! Overall, my girlfriend and I could not believe the outstanding service that we were experiencing for 6 DAYS IN A ROW. Everyone of the employees was so nice from the gyms guy giving me towels to the wait staff at Harbor Inn to the front desk. Even the security officers asked us if we were alright and needed anything. If I was a freaking millionaire I would live at your hotel. When I come back to San Diego I am DEFINITELY staying at your hotel. Freaking amazing. Your star rating should be waaaaay over than what it is on some of these websites. Thank you for such a great experience. I will never forget it...END MESSAGE. Overall if youre going to San Diego and you book a room here be sure you book it in the East Tower on a high floor. Once you get that covered trust me you'll have no worries the whole time you're there. This hotel is awesome.

<Title>“Great Hotel!”
<Content>Took husband and teenagers to LA for vacation and visited San Diego for 2 days as a side trip. Got excellent price $119.00 night through Sandiego.org....but you have to call into their 1-800 number to get the rate. Stayed in East Tower which was very convenient to everything....The West tower requires a shuttle to get to everything. Beautiful pool area. Was worried about how close the airport was but did not notice air traffic at all. You are not within walking distance to anything at all; that is the only draw back but you are only 3 miles to downtown, gas lamp, etc. Room was very nice...but they do not have refridgerators or microwaves....kind of bare basics but didn't mind for the rate that we paid. Would definitely stay there again and all common areas were beautiful!

<Title>“Never Again!”
<Content>This was quite possibly the WORST stay I have ever experienced and I've stayed in some crap hotels that had a friendly and more knowledgeable staff than this joke of a hotel, not only was our room not ready when we arrived at 6pm, I was treated rudely by the front desk clerk and then he dismissed me to help someone else who got into their room right away. For $509.00 (tax included) a night I expected better service. When my room was ready my room key was tossed on the counter and we weren't even told how to get to it which tower or anything. We then called for a vending machine location were sent on a wild goose chase, never did find it. We called the concierge for a taxi and were told they had them on call and one would be, well we ended up driving our own vehicle, no taxis were available. The laziness of this staff was astonishing! No one at this hotel seemed to be friendly, willing to help or even apologize for their lack of quality service. I will never return to this hotel until changes in staff manners & knowledge of the facility are finally a part of this hotel.

<Title>“Comfortable stay”
<Content>Stayed in West tower, which had large comfortable rooms. We were originally meant to stay in the East tower, but they could not give us adjoining/ adjacent rooms.This building seems much quieter than the east tower, which was perfect for us. The pool was smaller than the other two at the east tower, but always quiet- no fights for a sun bed! Although the hotel is situated near the airport, we were not bothered by aircraft noise at all.The restaurant in this building served excellent breakfasts, and the staff were very attentive. The restaurants in the other buildings were much busier. Room service was fast, efficient and good value for money. We did not have a car during our visit, so had to travel everywhere in taxis. These weren't too expensive, but were our only option, as the hotel is quite a distance from anything. There is no safe in the room, although safety deposit boxes are available at reception. This hotel was not cheap, but we would stay here again if we wanted to be near downtown San Diego.

<Title>“Nice place for a vacation.”
<Content>Pretty decent overall. Very attentive staff. The room condition was great...everything was nice and neat. I had a lenai room but it looked directly at a fence surrounding the tennis court. Self parking is $20/night which i thought was steep. Hotel is not within walking distance to anything so it is somewhat like a resort for someone who wants to hang out at the hotel pool and see other San Diego sights by car. The property has a very large feel to it as well.

<Title>“Nice place overall”
<Content>We stayed in a lanai room in the East Tower and it was beautiful.....better than I expected. We were close to the pool and marina - nice view from our balcony. Walking by the water was nice, although you can not walk to "town" or another restaurant. The only negatives for me: can not buy wine/beer in their little gift store, no room safe, had to get in car to go anywhere ($20 a day parking).

<Content>My Sisters and I and all our kids and GrandKids stayed at the Hotel for two nights. We had a great time. We spent most of our time in the pool. The food and parking was expensive. We had ground floor rooms all together. Great trip.

<Title>“Brilliant views”
<Content>Our stay at the hotel was wonderful, I booked a room offering limited view and was placed on the 16th floor overlooking the harbour with all the small private boats and charters - definately more than a limited view. The hotel is clean and well kept with friendly and knowledgable staff. We were located in the main building which is advertised as being closer the airport and so may have problems with noise but this was definately not the case, plus this part of the hotel has the most features. We walked to the other building, about 5 minutes stroll and found it to be more sub-standard and looked aimed more at conferences. I would defaintely stay here again, we paid $100 a night which is my view was a bargain. Louise Rogerson

<Title>“Nice Hotel Close to the Airport”
<Content>I attended a conference in the East Tower but chose to stay in the West Tower for the larger nicer rooms. Our room in the West Tower was indeed very nice and quite large, with a nice view of the harbor. The walk to the East Tower is not bad, but it gets kind of old after the second day. The East Tower has larger and nicer pools, dining, and bars, so I would probably stay there in the future, although the West Tower was very quiet. Best part of the hotel is a 5 minute ride (actually less) from the airport. Also nice is that it is a great place for a morning jog around Harbor Island. Worst part is that the on-site restaurants are very expensive and you have to take a cab to go anywhere off the island (actually the city bus passes right in front of the hotel if you are really trying to get downtown cheap).

<Title>“Fine, if you know what you're getting”
<Content>I bid on a 4* hotel on Priceline and received this hotel. Like other reviewers on Tripadvisor, I agree that it is a 3*. We had a room in the East Tower on the 10th floor. The view of the harbor was very nice. The hotel is full service, with several restaurants and a very nice pool. The location is ok. You can't walk to anything, but it's a short drive to many of the attractions in San Diego. However, the room was definitely 3* quality. It was very basic. The toilet seat was peeling, and there were stains on the carpet in the hallway. We were given a club level room with access to the club lounge, which was very nice and elegant with great views. It is located on the top floor and offered breakfast and evening hors d'oevres to club level guests. However, even there, the fabric on some of the chairs was peeling. If you come here expecting a 4* hotel, you will be disappointed. However, if you expect a 3*, it's not so bad.

<Title>“Very good stay”
<Content>After getting this hotel via a Priceline bid and reading the reviews..I was expecting to hate the property. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Originally assigned to the West Tower (told this by the shuttle driver)..I decided to ask for the east tower based on the comments here. I went to the SPQ desk at the east tower and was given Room 706 . It was on the smallish side..but clean with a great marina view. I felt the staff was professional and accomodating and would not hestiate to stay here again.

<Title>“Great hotel for our purposes”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel last week and booked our room through the sandiego.org customer service line at a very reasonable rate of $129 per night. This rate was available only through sandiego.org phone line and not on their website. We loved the location, the room (West tower) and the pools. We thought that everyone was very friendly, helpful, and went out of their way to accommodate our requests. One of the employees told me that Sheraton was trying to change their image via a new training program for all employees and that one of their goals was to accommodate guests' needs, etc. My sister is a Starwood preferred member and had us upgraded to the Starwood floors (9th and above?). We really liked the West tower as it was less hectic than the East tower during check-in and in the evenings. The restaurants were good and no more expensive than other hotel restaurants. You can hear planes take off as you're next to the airport, but this did not interrupt our sleep, as planes stop flying after midnight or so. We would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Business Hotel”
<Content>I stayed here on business and saw many other business travelers on a conference. I would not recommend this hotel for a family vacation spot. It is literally located 5 minutes from the aiport by shuttle, so you will hear the airplanes landing and taking off all day and night. If you stay here ask for a room with a pool and marina view if not you will be facing the main street with a parking lot view - not pretty at all! I would also ask for a renovated room - the pictures on their website are not like the room I stayed in. My room was very outdated, the rugs needed to be change - dirty and stained. The bedding felt old and the room had very bad lighting. This hotel needs a lesson on cleanliness. I found hair on my bedsheets and in the tub. Also, some type of bug was crawling in the bathroom - yuck! This hotel is also about a $12 cab ride to downtown San Diego where all the shops and eateries are.

<Title>“nice hotel”
<Content>Stayed here for a conference, so my company paid for it. It was great for that purpose. The bar at the hotel was a fun hangout, and the place had great views of the marina. If I was just here for a vacation with my wife we would have stayed somewhere by the beach since my wife likes more boutique style places (and we did actually move to a hotel in la jolla after the conference was over). The reviews here seemed very accurate. pros - big chain hotel, great amenities. I got lucky and had a great view on a high floor of the bay. location wasn't bad, about a $15 cab ride to gaslamp district where most of the nightlife and restaurants are, $15 cab ride to old town for some authentic (in a touristy way) mexican exploration. i think they charge 15 or 20 bucks to park or something like that, but i didn't have a rental car. the hotel has a shuttle that runs to/from the airport. that was nice. cons - i asked for special request of hypoallergenic bedding. they offered to remove all feathers/down and put in an air cleaner in the room. when i got back they had switched the pillows on just 1 of the 2 beds, and stuck the comforter in the corner behind the chair. there were several feathers on the carpet in plain view. well, at least they tried! another thing that bummed me was no free internet and i couldn't get wireless in my room (well, company paid so no big deal) oks - right next to the airport but i didn't hear any noise (i'm sensitive to noise).

<Title>“Most of the stay was good, however...”
<Content>First off, if you book through Hotwire or Priceline, they'll try to put you in something called a "Lanai" room. From all I've heard, you'll want to avoid these rooms...so I called and pleasantly asked to be moved to the west tower....and I was accomodated. That was definitely pleasant. Not pleasant?? 20 bucks for parking. Any great deal you think you're getting because a little less great after that. Overall, the room was nice. The main issue was that I could hear people talking in an adjacent room until after midnight. Since the walls to adjoining rooms were concrete, I have to assume it was a person either above or below me...either way, it was distracting and limited my sleep. We STILL paid 110 bucks for this through Priceline...and if I would have had earplugs, it'd definitely be all worth it.

<Content>Overall it wasn't a bad stay. You are very close to the airport but you don't hear the planes. Room was clean, bed was comfortable. Balcony was small but would fit two chairs, small table. Pool was okay, could have been nicer. Restaurant had good food but for the price you can find better. I would give this hotel a solid 3 stars. Definitely not a 4 star hotel. Would return if the price was right.

<Title>“Pleasantly Surprised”
<Content>Based on previous reviews, when I discovered that this was the hotel assigned to me by Priceline...I was scared! However, I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was smooth. Stayed in a room in the east tower adjacent property. The adjacent section seemed to be a little older then the main lobby building but definitly nicer looking then the outside of the east tower. Room was not extravegant but clean and modern looking. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Sunday brunch was amazing! I'd go back just for the brunch. Walked all around the hotel and the grounds are very nice. Tennis courts, two pools, work out room and a game room kept my kids busy. I actually wished we were staying more then one night so we could enjoy the facilities more. Hotel is right on the marina so you get to enjoy the boats and the water. Excellent location, easy to get to Zoo, Gaslamp district, ect. I would definitly stay here again.

<Title>“OK Stay”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton for 5 nights in May. I was able to book two rooms via Priceline for a good price. When we pulled into the front of the hotel, a valet had a list of all reservations & directed us to the West Tower. This was helpful, as the East Tower's self parking lot is a dirt lot located about a 5 minute walk from the hotel entrance and it would have been an inconvenience to take the kids & luggage out & back in. The West Tower was about a 3 minute drive and located in front of the Marina & Harbor in the back. The check in went smoothly. The staff was helpful and was able to accommodate our need for connecting rooms (one room w/ handicap access) & waived parking fees since we had a disabled car sign. We were given a newspaper every weekday morning and not charged. Both rooms were clean and decorated with the nautical theme. Although the West Tower is away from all the amenities, it had it's benefits...such as larger rooms for the kids to run around, less foot traffic then in the other Tower, further away from the airport , beautiful views & parking (on pavement not, dirt) located in front - never had trouble finding space. We took a look at the East Tower and were annoyed that we couldn't find a space and then, had to park in the dirt lot. It seemed the majority of their guests stayed there since there was a large influx of people going in & out. For us, we didn't plan on using the pool or eating at the nicer restaurants so the West Tower better meant our needs. My only complaint was there was no laundry facility at the West Tower. I would classify the hotel as a three star only because there were standard features missing. Both rooms secondary locks were not working as well as a peephole that had a paper rolled into it. One of the sliding closet doors was not secured at the bottom, which caused the door to swing. For some reason the message light kept blinking. Overall, we enjoyed our stay there and would return. Just a helpful hint for those looking with families looking for a quick meal, you may want to drive to Point Lomos neighborhood (around Nimitz Way & Rosencrans St) about a 10 minute drive to find McDonalds, KFC, Vons, Dennys,Walgreens & cheaper gas stations. We were driving downtown in the evenings for food and encountered traffic so it would take as 20-25 minutes to get downtown and finally, stumbled on this street.

<Title>“There are better hotels in the area”
<Content>This hotel was troublesome from the beginning. Not everything that went wrong was their fault, but they couldn't make anything right. I went there with a colleague to attend a conference. This is a large property and we were put in rooms at opposite ends of the complex. A walk from one end to the other took 17 minutes, mostly outdoors. This wasn't a hardship because the weather was beautiful, but it made it tougher to meet up for breakfast or classes. The problem was that when we checked in, they couldn't find two rooms for us that were closer. The complex consists of several buildings. The East Tower is the most centrally located. There are Lanai rooms that are at one end, and then far away in the other direction is the West Tower. The rooms in the West Tower are bigger, away from everything else, and non-smoking. The conference center was closest to the East Tower. The rooms weren't particularly clean. My colleague's room had a nasty-looking stain on the bedspread. My room had a big stain on the carpet. The rooms that I saw didn't have safes or refrigerators but they did have coffee makers. There was noise from the nearby airport but I expected it to be worse than it was. The staff were uniformly friendly and smiling, but generally not helpful. As a second example, the person at the desk in the West Tower offered to make a dinner reservation for us at a restaurant in the Gaslamp district on a Friday night, but she told me that the restaurant was sold out. We drove down there anyway expecting to find another restaurant, but the restaurant that we wanted was happy to seat us right away. As with so many things, they might not have been responsible but it seemed like they had a hard time doing anything that was actually helpful. None of the doors which were supposed to automatically lock at night ever actually locked. Guests have an odd habit of defeating security measures and maybe that had something to do with it, but apparently the locks weren't working. In reality, we didn't suffer at the Sheraton. The food was good, the drinks and tapas at the bar were generous, and the staff was friendly. But there are so many nicer places to stay in the area that I'd pick someplace else unless there was a really good reason (for example, a conference on the property) to stay at this Sheraton.

<Title>“I agree, not 4 stars”
<Content>We got the room for a decent enough rate through priceline, so I can't complain too much, but the 4 star properties we've had in San Diego in the past for a similar rate were so much nicer, that I felt compelled to leave this review. Like the previous poster, we too were given a room in the West tower. There's nothing else over there, and the East tower is a good drive away, so we never enjoyed any of the hotel amenities. That being said, you don't feel like you are anyplace special, because you basically have to go to another hotel to enjoy restaurants, bar, spa services, etc. What's the point of paying for them if you have to go somewhere else to enjoy them? The view was nice when we first checked into our room (harbor, Coronado bridge, a bit of the city) but we were moved around midnight thanks to a plumbing problem, and the new room looked out onto the marina and airport. Still decent, but not nearly as nice. The room was spacious and comfortable, decorated in a nautical theme, which was fitting, but the bathroom was tiny, the towels coarse, and the pillows old and lumpy (glad we brought our own). My beef with the hotel is this....while I appreciate that they moved us to another room after trying to repair the plumbing problem, I felt it would have been a nice touch for them to do more than continually turn our message light on at odd hours for us to call and let us know they were sorry. On both nights I was awakened by the blinking light, so I call only for them to say they were sorry. It was annoying to say the least and if you are going to keep calling, at least get it right and remove the charges for the internet (that we reserved in the first room) but were unable to use in the second room without me having to continually remind you. I feel the service feature of the call was poorly handled and was really more of a procedural annoyance than a measure to ensure my true satisfaction.

<Title>“Four stars? I don't think so”
<Content>I was checked in on the West side building instead of the tower building. The lobby looks more like a 3 stars trying really hard to look nice. The ground floor king bed room that I was given looks old and tired. One of the lamp does not work and while the room is spacious, there are not enough furnitures to fill the room so it looks a bit empty. Asides from the amenities, it is not much better than the average Four Points. The Westin Horton Plaza is a better value and location.

<Title>“We enjoyed this hotel”
<Content>We stayed here for three nights as a family of 4. We were located on the 11 floor of the main tower. Yes, the room was pretty small by most standards, but we managed just fine with 4 people and 4 suitcases. We were living out of the suitcases as we were changing hotels 3 times in total for this trip. The beds were very comfortable. The view was of the marina and the pool - very lovely. The airport was RIGHT there. My husband was bothered by the planes one morning, but we didn't notice them other than that. It was a very convenient location for touring SeaWorld, the Zoo, Downtown. The club lounge was one of the best I've experienced at a Sheraton. The staff were VERY friendly and attentive. We went for breakfasts, but not in the afternoons. We ate at the bar when we arrived the first night - the fried calamari was excellent! Service was very good and friendly. We really all enjoyed our stay here.

<Title>“ok place”
<Content>Stayed for over a week here on business in February 2007. The hotel is split into two towers. Most of the activities are in the East and unfortunately I was in the West. There is only a short walk between them though. Hotel is very very close to the airport and as a result, I found it quite noisy because you could always hear airplanes taking off. Room was fine, a good size and was clean but looked like it could do with some renovation especially in the bathroom. Room service was good and the staff were generally very good.

<Title>“unless your company is paying, its a ripoff..”
<Content>I stayed here with my husband (who was attending a trade show held at the hotel) for 4 nights. I read the reviews before going (tagging along for a cheap vacation to San Diego) so I had my expectations set low on what appeared to be a place that gouges for everything. I wasn't disappointed. We rented a car for 2 days so we could get around for 2 days on our own. If you stay at this hotel, you either need a car or get taxis if you want to get away from the hotel. We valeted the car for literally 1 hour when we checked in. Then we went back out for dinner and then self-parked the car overnight. When we got the hotel bill at the end, they of course were charging us $24/night for the entire stay (i.e. valet price for 4 nights). My husband on checkout told them we only had a rental car for 2 days and valeted the car for an hour and self-parked overnight. The 'resolution' to this apparently was to charge us ONLY for 2 nights of self parking. It was my husband's company paying the bill so I stayed out of it, but if my money was paying for this, I would have argued more at the front desk. That was the only mistake on the bill we had. The room we got on checkin had double sized beds and we requested king size bed and had to pay an extra $50/night for that. That bumped us up to the Club level room and gave us a city view which was nice. We got free contential breakfast and evening horderves and free internet for that $50 as well. The breakfast was nice (but they normally charge $12/head for it which again was nuts when no hot food was included). The horderves was also normally charged $12/head and again, was not worth the price. It was nice, but we got there one night during the last 45 minutes of it and hardley anything was left and they didn't refill anything. I rented a bike one day (which was $7/hour) and it was nice (a way to get some exercise and away from the hotel). The pool was outside and kind of chilly to go into so didn't get to try it out. I would never stay here if I was paying with my own money. They overcharge for everything and its obvious they know most people staying here don't care cause an expense account is probably paying the bill. The room we stayed in was clean and nice, but as other reviews have said, the walls are thin and we did hear noise often from the room next door to us. I once heard someone listening to their voicemail through the walls, which seems to be a sign of thin walls!

<Content>The hotel was a nice hotel in a good location between the marina and San Diego Bay. The hotel should do a better job, however, in letting people know that this hotel is actually divided into two separate towers which are almost a mile away from each other. The room I stayed in was clean and well appointed. The bathroom was a bit dated, but otherwise it was a good room with a balcony overlooking the marina.

<Content>I stayed with my Dad on a quick visit to see my son in the Navy. I booked on-line $109 + tax and was trully surprised at the hotel. It is a 3 star and really nice. The pool area is wonderful and ALL the staff were so nice and pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel and would book it for my next stay in San Diego. We were given non-smoking and 2 double beds with lots of pillows and a small balcony over looking downtown San Diego. The parking was $17/24 hr, but I was expecting this. They do take pets less than 70 lbs for no additional fee and my dad has a 7 lb companion, so it was great!

<Title>“You get what you pay for!”
<Content>My family and I have just returned from a five night stay at this hotel. I made the mistake of booking this hotel using one of those discount internet services. First and last time I'll do that again. I had put in a request for a 4-star accomodation thinking I would be given a reservation at either the Omni, Hyatt or Intercontinental hotel as shown in their example. But , no...it was the Sheraton Marina and Harbor instead. I was both surprised and disappointed. First of all, this property is NOT a 4-star accomodation, and this booking service should not be falsely advertising it as such. We arrived at almost 1am after a late flight. I had previously called the hotel to request a late arrival guarantee. Don't know if it was the late hour or the fact that I had booked through a discount broker, but the room we were given was on the ground floor. Not only did the noise of the airplanes from the nearby airport wake us up througout the night , but there was also heavy foot traffic outside our door in the busy hallway. One night , we had to listen to noisy teenagers out by the darkly lit pool area off our patio until midnight. Ditto on the self-parking situation. I think that $17 is ridiculous! (To valet park, it was $24 per day.) The lot was dirty, far away and very poorly lit. We were also double-charged by the hotel for the entire stay. Someone else with the same common last name must have gotten free parking! You had to give the lot attendant your room number along with your last name each time you left, so I'm not sure how the mistake kept getting made. Even as we left the lot for the last time, it happen again! Back to the front desk to clear it up. Lastly, the condition of the room was not that impressive. Certainly not 4-star standards. Ants in the bathroom and NEVER enough towels. Three out five nights I had to request (by note and phone) more towels and toiletries to the housekeeping staff. I reminded them that there were four in our party and not two. No newspaper on the first morning as well. San Diego and its weather was great however! The kids had a blast visiting all of the attractions. Also, note that there didn't seemed to be any reasonably priced restaurants on Harbor Island. A Von's grocery store was also a few miles away. Note there's no refrigerator or microwave in the room either. The location of the Sheraton worked for us, but the entire trip I felt deceived by the fact that I had basically stayed at a 3-star accomodation but thought I was paying for something much nicer. I guess in this situation the old adage, "you get what you pay for" holds true. Next time, I will book my hotel directly and not blindly through a discount hotel broker.

<Title>“View is to die for!”
<Content>Stayed two nights for my Mom's birthday. Check-in was fast and we were up to our 11th floor room in no time only to discover one king bed instead of our requested two doubles. Back to the front desk, I explained my situation and got the icy-cold "I couldn't care less" attitude. They said they would send up a rollaway as there were NO other rooms available. The view from this room was fabulous. Really enjoyed having a balcony... room was clean and fresh and appreciate the morning newspaper. Bottled water was complimentary, nicer than average toiletries, comfortable bathroom with good water pressure. Parking is an outrageous $17! I knew that going in from reading other reviews, but the kicker is the only spaces available were on dirt! So much for my nice clean car, it was toast by the time we left. Also upon check out they charged twenty bucks for the rollaway and REFUSED to reverse the charge even though I requested two beds and no charge for the rollaway was ever mentioned at the front desk. Let me tell you some of the employees here have a serious attitude problem. Overall I would probably stay here again based on the location, nice room and beautiful view.

<Title>“Wow, great hotel!”
<Content>I loved this hotel! Ample parking is a good starting point. Location - near airport - is convenient for the business traveler, but the beautiful views of downtown San Diego and Coronado make it a great place for holiday makers alike! My room was very beautifully equipped and decorated, bathroom was nice. Really, me and my girlfriend really enjoyed our stay there! Complimentary internet is offered in the lobby, which is great! Pleanty of restaurants and there's also a pub! Three swimming pools, one heated, gym and tennis fields. What could you ask more from a hotel? Maybe not the best hotel in San Diego, but a good 4* indeed! Rating? B+

<Title>“Not as good of a deal as you think...”
<Content>If you are looking for a good deal costwise, don't stay here! We stayed at the hotel during the first weekend in March because got a good deal on Hotwire.com ($134/night). The biggest problem with this hotel is its location. It is located directly across the street from the airport-at times it was difficult to sleep because we could hear planes flying overhead. Its also located away from all of the major attractions, so if you don't have a car, you end up spending a lot of money on cabs. If you do have a car (we rented one for the weekend), you end up paying $17/day to park at the hotel. After paying for transportation, it didn't seem like a good deal at all. The room we stayed in (in the East Tower) was clean, but extremely bare. It clearly had been updated in several years. We did use the spa, which was small, but the service was great. All of the employees we encountered at the hotel, from the front desk to the concierge to the spa staff to the staff at the main restaurants were exceptionally friendly and offered prompt service. The staff was the best part of the experience.

<Title>“Great service!”
<Content>I was thoroughly impressed by my stay at this hotel. The location was very simple to get to from the airport (I could see it upon exiting) and our room had a nice little view of the harbor and boats. It was right off the main street that skirts the harbor and made for easy access to downtown (we had a rental car) and Rt. 5 (the highway that seemed to take us everywhere we wanted to go). The service was impeccable. From the woman who checked us in, to the woman who brought the room service, to the bar tender, to the concierge, to the woman who served us during our business lunch... everyone was friendly and efficient. They brought me things before I knew I needed them. Having the sports bar downstairs was a welcome addition when we came back after a full day and wanted a quick beer. The bar tender allowed us to sample the 2 local beers we were trying to decide between. The room was clean and large enough for 2 of us by far. The internet access in the lobby was also helpful for a quick email check.

<Title>“Great place, but a little bit expensive”
<Content>I have my first trip to San Diego this Feb. for a conference. The conference is held in Sheraton Hotel and Marina. I requested for a kingsize-bed room while I made reservation, but I got a twin-bed one. Though not in my expectation but it didn't bother me. The view is great, I had a harbor-view room and the sunset is gorgeous. Downtown view is also available since i have a room in the 7F. The room is just ok, have most basics you may need, but don't expect for a very luxurious room. Decoration is simple but a little bit dated. Bed is quite comfortable. Staffs are quite friendly. I had twice in-room dining, the waiters are very polite. Front desk is also good, provides useful information. I had a dinner in the Harbor's Edge, and enjoyed it very much. The only problem with this hotel is its food. They are a little bit expensive, though I was not in a tight budget, I still feel expensive. I have no idea in Parking since I didn't rent a car. If you wanna stay here and take buses to downtown, you should take route 992 but not route 923. I made a mistake and it almost killed my legs to find the route 923's stop.

<Title>“Lovely common areas, dirty rooms”
<Content>This was one of the worst hotel experiences in my life. This hotel has two separate buildings, the east and west towers. When I checked in at the west tower, the clerk was uneducated in the hotel's computer system. As the west tower is the less busy of the two, there was no one to help him and we had to wait about 30 minutes to complete the check in. This would have been nothing more than an annoyance, but the check in was not correct. When we drove to the other building to go to our room, we discovered that our room was in the old section of the hotel, about a 1/4 of a mile walk through a maze of hallways in the hotel complex. I am not exaggerating. I counted steps. I booked my travel through Priceline as an experiment, a mistake that I never will repeat. This hotel was listed and promised as a 4 star hotel. The hotel clearly treats Priceline customers like second-class citizens, but Priceline does not warn you of this fact. When we finally arrived at out room, the carpet was dirty, not just worn, the bathroom was rusty, vents were missing from the closet doors and there was one bed, although the check in clerk had supposedly booked in two queens. The room was a step down from a Motel 8. To the bellhops credit, he switched our room to an "upgraded" room for free, and he at least tried to help. We moved rooms to the main tower and were greeted by dirty (stubbed out cigarettes) hallways and our room was again dingy with beaten up furniture, a desk that was literally falling apart, lamps that had no working bulbs, etc. After settling in and unable to find a floor vending machine for a bottle of water, I decided to pay the $ 4.00 for the hotel's room bottle, only to find that the bottle had been previously opened! Yuck! I called the front desk to assure that the water would not be charged to me, and she comped me another bottle, but the fact that the bottle was not checked should tell you the level of cleaning in the hotel. In addition to the gross room, and I swear to the big G on this, our toilet actually backed up. I believe that the hotel maintenance staff knew that there was a problem with the toilet before we checked in because the lid was not fully on the toilet when we got in the room. All in all this was a disgusting experience. If the room had not already been paid for through Priceline, I would have switched hotels. I WILL NEVER STAY AT A SHERATON AGAIN.

<Title>“A pleasant experience all the way around”
<Content>When we arrived at this hotel, we were pleasantly surprised. We had just come from the Westin Bonaventure in L.A. and after staying in that run-down hotel for the majority of out California vacation, we wished we had stayed in San Diego the whole time! The lobby is nice and fresh and the check in staff was very helpful. At first we were put in a room without much of a view and all it took was a friendly call down to front desk and they happily moved us (we did check in on a weekday so it may not have been very booked). The view wasn't perfect because of how the hotel is angled, but it was nice. The room was clean and the bathroom wasn't huge but it was nicer than at the Bonaventure. I can't remember what the name of the room was, but it was on one of the top two floors, so it came with access to the penthouse club, which served breakfast in the morning and hors d'oeuvrs before diner (but get there early!). The internet access seemed a little pricey at $15, but I think there is free access to internet in the penthouse club. The bar there is nice and friendly. I met a lot of nice people while staying here and I had a blast.

<Title>“Very pleasant first time stay”
<Content>The hotel is located directly across from the airport. Parking choices are Valet $24/day or Self-Park (uncovered and short distance) for $17/day...both can be charged to your room with in-n-out privileges. We checked in very late - and our options were 2 beds in the "main" tower - or - a king (what we requested) in the other tower. We were tired - we took the 2 bed room in the main tower. It worked out - our room had a balcony that overlooked a harbo where MANY boats are moored (sp?) It overlooked the outdoor pool and walking trail or sidewalk. It was a very nice view. I think we were in room 1034. Our room had a connecting door to the next room - you could hear people loud and clear in the morning. I'm not sure if they were extra loud or the walls were paper thin (or the noises came through the clearance below the door). The bed was SO comfortable - it is my 2nd favorite bed behind the "Cloud 9" Westin bed in Oklahoma City. Bathroom was up to date and clean. We didn't try internet access. The magazines in the room were helpful - it even had a coupon for Harbor cruises that helped. The concierge (sp?) also has coupons and maps - stop by to see him/her. We stopped by the bar for one drink - it seemed nice. We didn't use any othe shop/cafe/restaurant in the main tower. The "other" tower was just 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile down the road - I'm sure it would have been fine. We did not use a taxi - but the concierge mentioned that it would cost @ $10 to go 4 miles (one way) over to the Marriott hotel (where our friends were) by the convention center. There are some parking meters near the tourist spots - they tend to run $.25 for 12 minutes - and there is a parking garage by the Nimitz aircraft carrier museum. Just thought I would toss that in in case you are trying to decide whether to rent a car or whether to take a taxi to your locations. We would definitely stay here again. We felt like we got a good price for the type of accomodations we received.

<Title>“What a view!”
<Content>Well, I used to live in San Diego, so I can honestly say this is a good central location, and a nice way to experience the look of San Diego...by staying at this Sheraton. The price was reasonable, the room had a great bay and city view, and there are very nice restaurants that are walking distance. The only complaint I would have is...that the carpets seemed old and dirty...more of an old motel carpeting than a high-class hotel. Time to give the maids a break and actually break out the funds for a thorough steam-cleaning! Everything else was top-notch, and we had a great time!

<Content>This was our second time to stay at the hotel and have no complaints at all. The hotel is wonderful. We do stay in the West Tower and get the harbor view rooms. You can't beat the view! The city in the background and the sail boats in the harbor. The walk to the East Tower is nothing. We love it here and when we visit San Diego again, we will stay here. We got our room direct with the hotel and used our Entertainment card.We paid $179 a night for a Deluxe room, High Floor, Harbor View. You can't get a better deal in San Diego!

<Title>“Definitely deserves a return visit”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for a 5-night stay during a conference held at the hotel in October. The hotel is located on Harbour Island and comprised of 2 towers: the East Tower being the larger and original tower; the West Tower being the smaller but newer tower. After reading the review on Trip Advisor, I made sure to request a room in the newler West Tower. (It turned out to be the better choice since the conference was held in the same tower!). Here's a run-down of my experience: Shuttle - very prompt and efficient. The shuttle runs regularly between the 2 towers and the San Diego airport (5 minutes away). I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the shuttle also drives guests to nearby restaurants on the island and if not available, the bellboy will drive you in the hotel's fleet of Town Cars. Check in - I arrived at 11am on an early flight in and was expecting to have to stow my luggage in storage until the standard check-in time of 3pm. They, however, had my room ready and upgraded me to a larger deluxe room on a higher floor. Staff were very helpful and courteous. Room - paid $259 USD / night which included the buffet breakfast (more on this later). The room had 1 king bed, a sofa, and desk. The room was extremely spacious but the washroom was a little cramped. Room was spotless and had a balcony overlooking the harbour. Housekeeping came daily and was finished before 11am. West tower - newly renovated but while it was the farther tower from the airport, you could still hear the planes coming and going. The West Tower has only 1 restaurant and a small gym but it is much brighter and quieter than the East Tower. The East Tower is a mere 5 minute stroll along the marina or a 2 minute bus ride. Seriously, people who say the walk is long must not get much exercise! There is also free WiFi access in the hotel lobby but you must have your own wireless-equipped laptop to use (otherwise, head to the web bar in the lobby of the East Tower) Gym - very small but was never crowded. Equipped with 1 elliptical machine, 2 treadmills, 2 exercise bikes, free weights, and mats. Water cooler provided, too. Breakfast buffet - trek on over to the East Tower for the buffet. It's well worth the $$!! Plenty of fresh fruits, cereal, hot foods, and a made-to-order omlette bar. Location - very convenient...a 10 minutes ($15 USD) cab ride away to Horton Plaza in the downtown core. Beautiful views of the downtown skyline and marina. Overall, I would return to the Sheraton. Excellent service, great quality, and not outrageously expensive prices.

<Title>“Hotel refused to give us a Non-Smoking Room! Priceline buyers beware!!”
<Content>After bidding on 4-star downtown San Diego Hotels on Priceline, our bid was accepted by the Sheraton on Harbor Island. I requested Non-Smoking rooms with King Size Beds, and called the hotel a week in advance of our arrival about this issue. Upon check-in, we were informed that Priceline rooms are strictly Smoking Rooms with two double beds! Our rooms were in the "Lanai" section, a three story older part of the hotel. We had a pool view, not a harbor view as we had hoped. Aside from the heavy smoke odor, the room was very nicely furnished. Beds were comfortable. We slept well, and were not awakened by airport noise (the airport is accross the street from this Hotel). The main Hotel Lobby is very nice, complete with a large aquarium, and free Internet access. The Concierge was helpful, and all of the staff we encountered were friendly and efficient. We would have preferred a Hotel located closer to the Downtown attractions, but Priceline includes Harbor Island in it's Downtown Hotels.

<Title>“If you are looking for quiet, don't look here”
<Content>I am a local San Diegan and had planned a birthday Saturday for my husband. We rented a sailboat out of the Harbor very near the Sheraton. The plan was to go to dinner after sailing and spend a nice evening at the Sheraton. A friend of mine had worked there for years when it was called the Sheraton Grande. I attended her wedding there years ago and it was lovely. Apparently they hotel forgot to upgrade. We only spent one night, but believe me that was enough. It was difficult to book only one night, Saturday night. So when I got a rate of $259.00, I took it. The hotel is an older style and must be at least 45 years old. The ceilings are not very high and the lobby is modest for a Sheraton. Approaching the front entrance, loud pop music was playing. Almost like the hotel was going for a Las Vegas feeling. Our room was modest and it appeared all the rooms had a nautical theme, which was fine. The room had a magnificint view of The San Diego Bay. The trouble started when we found our room and noticed we were located closed to the elevator. The hotel being so old, every time the elevator went up or down, we heard it. When the elevator stopped on our floor, a bell rung. That was't a problem until we wanted to get some sleep. We went to bed about 11:30 p.m. but did not sleep. Apparently there were three or four funtions at the hotel. From around 12:00 until 2:15 a.m. the functions ended and throngs of people got in the elevator and went back to their rooms. When they stopped on our floor, the bell would ding and drunk loud guests would proceed to exit the elevator and yell and sing right at our door. I woke up at least ten times. At 2:00 am, we almost packed our bags and went home, since we live locally. The Hotel is so old, you can hear when anyone in the area flushed their toilet. The toilet sounded like an airplane toilet, does the job great but you'll know the habits of everyone in rooms around you. If you can avoid the hotel do it. Even though the view is spectacular, you'll have to catch up on your sleep it you don't.

<Title>“Nice Business Travelers Hotel”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel in Mid-September for a conference. Arrived on a beautiful Saturday afternoon well before the 3PM check-in time and was able to get into my room immediately. I found the rooms in the West Building to be very nice and much nicer and larger than those of the East Building. The room & bathrooms were clean and well laid out. Although you have to walk a short distance to get to any conference events, the views of the city and bay more than make up for it. It is also much quieter in the West Building. I did notice that if you leave your sliding door open or ajar that it will effect the operation of the air conditioner. My wife and I thorougly enjoyed our stay.

<Title>“Better than I was prepared for . . . (in some ways)”
<Content>I have to say I was VERY nervous about staying here. I had been reading reviews for months. We were there for a conference so we had no choice in hotel location. I did request the East Tower, which is where everything is located. The other tower is a far walk away. We were given the tower we wanted and every employee was VERY nice whenwe were making these reservations. Upon arriving we were greeted very professionally and pleasantly. They take your bags to your room, you have no say in this. We were there four nights for the conference and the only complaints I can come up with are the food prices are outrageous for breakfast. If you are preparred to spend $20 for three little kids to have a bagel and share a juice, then no worries. Room service for kids for dinner is EXCELLENT. They have $5 - $6 choices ranging from burgers, quesadillas to chicken nuggets. It was great. The pool and landscaping is so beautiful. You will enjoy your surroundings. My only other complaint is the odd behavior of some staff. MANY times we had knockings on our door, only to have an employee quickly open our door (before time even allowed us to get to the door) and they would pop their head in to see if anyone was there. (Not good if you're in the shower) Always with a weird excuse too. One person was holding bottled water, seeing if we needed replenished. (at $4 a bottle, no thanks) And doesn't housekeeping note these things when they come through???? Another employee came in with a clipboard. When I asked what he wanted, he stated "never mind" and left. Another woman entered with two towels draped over her arm. (Again, doesn't housekeeping do this?) We were beginning to put it together that they knew there was a hotel full of conference attending folks who wouldn't be in their rooms and the employyees were going around swiping things. It's not the most positive conclusion, but it's the only one we came to. Over all, the hotel is beautiful, the pool clean and the empoyees we dealt with were friendly and helpful. Food pricey and a few weird experiences. Just be careful . . . . . Hope this helps a little.

<Content>My wife attemded a conference here so I tagged along for the two night stay. Once you accept the fact that this is a corporate hotel and that it's close to the airport for a reason you can enjoy it for what it is. It has three nice pools, good restaurants, a beautiful view of the harbor, a nice walkway between the two towers, clean and comfortable rooms, plenty of outdoor seating, good service and it's close to downtown. What's not to like?

<Title>“Avoid this inhospitable hotel at all costs”
<Content>Worst hotel experience ever. A security guard came to our room for a noise complaint. So, we closed the balcony door which had been open to allow fresh air to come in. Next thing you know, no less than FOUR Harbor police cars are dispatched to the hotel. Apparently our next door neighbor complained that we were shuffling cards too loud. We were not loud at all. We are not partiers! The lobby has music blasting at all hours of the night and due to the location of the hotel, airplanes flying nearby from not only the San Diego International Airport but also North Island Naval Station in Coronado across the bay, and a friendy game of cards gets us kicked out of this hotel! We were in the west tower (you have no choice when checking in which tower you get) and the guest rooms in this particular building must have paper thin walls (which is a shame because the hotel itself is pretty nice). To add insut to injury, the front desk refused to move us to a different room or refund our money and we couldn't even check out properly because their "system was down". Fianlly, I contacted the Guest Experience Supervisor and while he was courteous, he said there was nothing he could do for us.

<Title>“Pretty Good!”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at the Sheraton during the middle of the week while a major conference was going on at the hotel. Our room was on the tenth floor of the East Wing looking over the Marina towards downtown. Pluses: 1) Spectacular view of the San Diego skyline and wonderful location along the marina! 2) Very comfortable beds. 3) The lobby is very nicely designed with a feature called Yahoo Link. PC workstations are clustered in groups around comfortable chairs and tables. High speed broadband service is free along with wireless access if you bring your laptop. Yahoo Link adjoins the Aroma Cafe where snacks and beverages are available. The idea is to create a place to "meet and greet" and hangout. 4) The fitness center is equipped with all new Lifecycle treadmills, bicycles, etc. The facility is spotless and well air conditioned. 5) The lagoon style meandering pool is very nice and in certain places very compatible with lap swimming. Minuses: 1) Room decor in the East Wing needs to be updated. Furniture isn't bad, but the table and floor lamps look like something out of the Victorian past. Previous reviews refer to a nautical theme in the West Wing--hardly the case here. 2) High speed access is $11.95 in the guest rooms--it's still a mystery why upper scale hotels charge for internet access and value hotels don't. 3) Parking is expensive everywhere and no less so at the Sheraton. Overall, I would definitely stay again!

<Title>“Loved the Sheraton San Diego (Harbor View)”
<Content>Only spent one night in San Diego and was glad to have chosen such a wonderful place. The view from our West Wing hotel room was spectacular! We had a beatiful view of the Coranado Bridge and downtown San Diego. The large king size bed room was recently redecorated in nautical colors. The location was central to just about every point in the city. Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who is a first timer to San Diego. The bonus is that its just off North Harbor Drive and the airport.

<Title>“Not worth the money, even if you get a bargain”
<Content>We got a great deal on the hotel for labor day weekend and the best part about the experience was the view. We got an awesome view of the marina and the lanai pool. However, only 1 elevator out of 2 was working the whole weekend and we either had to take the service elevator or walk all the way down the hall if we wanted to go up to the 5th floor. Otherwise, the wait was like 10 mins. Totally ridiculous. The internet is NOT part of your stay which is so cheesy because the Days In gives it to you for free. We argued with them because when you log in it appears you don't have to pay by entering your hotel room number but we got billed $12 a day for the internet and we only logged in for total of 3 hours over 3 days. Finally, the valet guys were all really nice but the parking was sooooo expensive. $16 a day and we did self parking and husband would drop off/pick up in front of the hotel and the valet guys were really nice about it. We didn't know there was a fee for parking and you are not close enough to park anywhere else so totally not worth staying at this hotel. You can do so much better for the price. The bedding was comfortable and they have nice goose down pillows and comforters but that was it. Shop around..don't come here if you don't have to.

<Title>“Not bad for a Priceline find”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the West Tower from 8/24-8/28. The hotel had a large, recently renovated room with a nautical theme. Overall, the room was comfortable (esp. the bed)..however the bathroom could have been cleaner...the floor of the tub looked dirty. The other thing was there was no safe in the room...which I found to be odd. I normally like to place my valuables in the safe while I am visiting a city...it just makes easier for me. The room was facing the bay and it was definitely a beautiful view. We did not get to try any of the restaurants while staying here. The parking charge was ridiculous...$16 for self park and about $22 for valet..The one night they had a sweet sixteen and a weddding...therefore the self parking was full to capacity and the valet parking had a really looong wait. As for the airport noise, I did not hear even one while at the West Tower. However, the one afternoon we went to the East Tower and I noticed the airplane noise there. The front desk was helpful and friendly...but there was always a wait...I think they need to hire more people. It seemed as though the front desk was dealing with quite a few unhappy guests (one customer was being overcharged and another was a bride and groom who had made a reservation for five rooms and they messed up their reservations.) On our second night there, we had a problem with the bathtub...after showering, the water was not going down. We called the front desk and they sent someone up. After a half hour of using a wet vac to un-clog the tub (which caused the room to smell like a sewer from some reason), the man said it was fixed and that he would send someone up to clean the mess made in the bathroom from the wet-vac. My husband and I waited a half hour and then needed to call the front desk to find out where the cleaning service was (he still needed to shower as we were trying to make our dinner reservations), they assured us someone would be right up. We then waited another fifteen minutes...but there was still no cleaning service. Once again we called the front desk and they assured us someone was on there way...a few minutes later someone arrived to clean the bathroom. However, after my husband showered, the tub was clogged again. Since we did not want to go through what happened again, we asked for a new room for the next day. The front desk was more than happy to move us to another room. However, in this room the main light wasn't working..but it was not a big deal...the bahttub still looked a bit dirty. Overall, the hotel experience was okay for the price we paid on Priceline....if I had paid full price for this hotel, I would have been furious.

<Title>“Enjoyed my stay”
<Content>We just came back from our 4day trip to S.D. Our stay at the Sheraton was good. I checked in early to get a good view, but since we requested two adjoining rooms they could'nt accomodate us with a better view unless we separated (understandable). We stayed at the east tower. All the restaurants and the main pool are at the east tower, just nice. The pool side food is typical of hotel food pricey and not that great. The hotel has updated its look in some areas and some are desperatly asking for help like the arcade. My sister stayed in the west tower. Rooms are renovated and seem larger. If your not traveling with family, stay there its more quiet. Overall we enjoyed our stay, Im not a big winer.

<Title>“Very Nice”
<Content>Stayed at the Sheraton on our last leg down the coast for 3 nights. Had a deluxe room on the 9th floor with a great view. Room was large and comfortable, especially the beds. Bathroom was o.k.; clean, but could have been cleaner (tub). Air conditioning wasn't as cool as we would have liked it. We were able to regulate it ourselves, but it didn't feel that much cooler; but it was very quiet. We were in the West Tower, but ALL the action is in the East Tower. It is a pleasant 3 minute walk along the Marina. But after a few drinks, we had to walk ALL the way back. They have one restaurant in the West Tower. Had breakfast there one morning; it was our last. Poor service; ridiculous prices -- $4.50 for a glass of orange juice. We enjoyed the East Tower, especially Quinns (sports bar); good atmosphere. If we stay here again, we will request the East Tower (less walking). Found the desk staff at the West Tower friendly; helpful. Overall, this hotel is o.k. We would stay here again. It does sit next to the airport, but you truly are not disturbed by the air noise. In fact, between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., the air traffic stops. We liked the location, and it really does have wonderful views.

<Title>“Nicer than expected”
<Content>My partner, son and I recently stayed at this Sheraton. As I fly often out of San Diego Airport, I often had seen this hotel which is located just across the street from the airport. From that distance, to be honest, it looks like a big 1960-ish (not too attractive) building. So, I must say that I had low expectations of the hotel when I decided to stay there. I thought it would just be a cold airport hotel where people would stay only for the convenience of the airport - not as a destination hotel. I am happy to write, however, that the hotel is much, much nicer when you are in it than how it had seemed from a distance! The service was very good (the valet parkers, the registration, bell-hops) and the views from the windows on the seventh floor were really beautiful. From one side you see the skyline of San Diego and from the other side you see the boats in the harbor/marina. The food there was also very good. My only complaint was that the overnight parking fee is quite high. We didn't hear any airplane noise, even though we were just minutes away from the airport. We just had the basic room, so that's what we got. It seemed like it had recently been renovated and was very clean and nice. The square footage seemed a little sparse (the room was kind of narrow shaped). Had a nice little balcony from which we could see the boats too! All in all, a fine place for a night or two.

<Title>“pleasant stay”
<Content>My wife and I stayed with our one year old daughter for five nights August 2006. We booked through priceline and were very pleased with the hotel. We were placed in the west tower in a second floor room overlooking the swimming pool. The room was clean and a good size, with a small balcony. The hotel is very close to the airport and anybody wanting an early night or a long lie in might be disturbed by airplane noise or the noise from the swimming pool-which was quiet after 10.30pm. The hotel is on Harbor island - it's easy to go for a stroll from the hotel along San Diego Bay with lovely views of downtown. It's too far to walk downtown, but it's only a five minute drive away. We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant one morning- it's a fairly standard breakfast buffet and relatively expensive at $19 but was done well. Car parking is $14 a day. I called the hotel to request a crib the night before we arrived and was told that availability could not be guaranteed. However, on arrival a crib was available and there was no charge for this. In summary the hotel is a good choice for a family vacation in a good location as long as you are not upset by a small amount of noise from about 7am until 11pm

<Title>“Had a great time at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina”
<Content>My family and I just returned from our San Diego vacation where we stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. After reading some of the previous reviews, I had mixed feelings going into this trip. However, once I arrived at the hotel, all my concerns quickly disappeared and our stay was completely enjoyable. We stayed in the West Tower and even with 2 children (we had a king room with a rollaway and a crib) were were comfortable and had ample room. Our room faced the bay which was the best free entertainment. My 2 year old had a blast letting us know anytime a helicopter or airplane took off from North Island or a large ship was passing by. We could also see the Coronado Bridge, downtown San Diego and Point Loma from our balcony. We were also treated to fireworks being setoff near the bridge a couple of nights. The hotel has 3 lovely pools, a small one at the West Tower (with bar/food service), the larger "main" pool and another small pool at the East Tower. The "main" pool has poolside dining with waitstaff service. The food was good although typicaly priced for hotel food. It arrived quick, hot and with a smile from the server who checked on us frequently to make sure things were good. They also accomodated substitutions for the ingredients (ie: chicken for shrimp on the salad). They also allow (and sell) pool toys which was great for my kids. The walk from the West Tower to the East Tower was pleasant, with beautiful views of the harbor. There's a great little deli (Papanani's) along the way which was open for breakfast, lunch and dinner until 8pm. They serve the best tasting ice cream! Also, another poster stated there wasn't a game room/arcade as advertised but there is one, tucked away off the "main" pool, near the spa entrance. The one downfall I found at this property was the $16 to self-park your car (you really need one, the hotel's not downtown or walking distance to public transportation) in the parking lot directly in front of the hotel. But. there are no other parking options available so as a hotel guest, you are stuck with the fee. Overall, this hotel was comfortable, roomy and very accomodating to my family and we would definitely stay here in the future.

<Title>“Great Location (surrounded by water)”
<Content>Had a wonderful time at the Sheraton Hotel in San Diego (near the airport--Harbor Island). You can actually see the hotel from the airport but the flight patterns at the airport keep the noise away from the hotel. The hotel is not new but is in reasonably good shape. We had a room looking out over the yacht harbor and the harbor and it was just beautiful. We upgraded to the Club Level and this gave us a very nice breakfast at the Penthouse level and a 5pm reception (free food but you had to pay for drinks--pretty chintzy). Easy to get downtown via cab to the gaslamp section so really can do without a rental car unless you want to go sightseeing outside of San Diego. The location of this hotel was the best part. We enjoyed the view and the ability to walk along the harbor and enjoy the views.

<Title>“The WORST for the money!”
<Content>Our experience at the Sheraton was terrible. We had upgraded to a "deluxe" room when we made our reservations. Our family of four was put into a cracker box size room ( told "all rooms are the same size") with a Motel 6 bathroom, no, sorry Motel 6.... worse.. ( cracked toilet, mold in the grout line of the bathtub and not just a little! A sink that when you turned it on the faucet would break off and again, small, small) The AC was not working, the fan made a terrible noise. They nickle and dime for EVERYTHING...local calls $2.00 a minute, internet usage fees, parking $16.00. They even wanted to charge $25.00 to put a frig in our room) At $200 a night...are they serious? What made it all worse was the insincere smiles from the maniquins at the front desk who could have cared LESS about our experience. Needless to say after one night ( booked for four) we checked out. Found a LOVELY Best Western. The Island Palms and for the same rate checked into a beautiful marina side queen suite, full kitchen, huge bathroom, seperate bedroom. No fees for parking, free wireless, beautiful grounds and pool. AHHHHH now we could enjoy our vacation and we did. Sheraton? Just say NO!

<Title>“Very nice”
<Content>We stayed here for three nights at the end of June 2006. Overall the experience was very nice. The best was our view from our balcony over the boats in the marina. It is very close to the airport, but the airplane noise did not bother us. The pool was clean and not too crowded. The beds were very comfortable, bathroom was clean. Location was perfect for us seeing the sights of San Diego. If I had negative comments, it would be that the carpet seemed old and daily parking was expensive ($16/day, just add it to the rate of your room to make yourself feel better). We did not eat at the restaurants, due to the fact we were looking for cheap eats. I would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Nice hotel, friendly staff!”
<Content>We stayed here July 1 and 2, 2006 and had a great stay. We spoke to quite a few employees asking questions about renting bikes, restaurants, etc and everyone was very friendly and helpful. We even got lost downtown looking for a restaurant and I called the hotel for help ... the girl gave me directions and was really friendly. We stayed in the West Tower, and I guess the rooms have been recently renovated (see pix). I thought the rooms were really large and you can see the ocean from bed (we had a bay view). The bathroom needed a bit of updating but the room itself was quite nice. We ate at the Harbor's Edge which is in the East Tower and had a lovely lunch - service and food were good. The calamari was so yummy and tender! We spent our pool time at the West Tower pool though ... the East Tower pool was too crowded with too many kids for my taste. The West pool is more low-key although it also has a bar/food service counter. We would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“WATCH THOSE "LITTLE EXTRAS!"”
<Content>Our family stayed at the Sheraton because my husband was a speaker at a conference there. We got a reduced (conference) rate and I have to say it was a fair price for the value. Their beds are terrific! Even the rollaway bed (an additional $20 per day) is terrific! It was very quiet, and I always appreciate that. The morning coffee and tea setup on each floor was nice. We were annoyed at the $16 per day parking fee. Seems like conference participants, in particular, should be able to park for free! We could not afford to eat in their restaurant, and the prices of bar drinks was out of sight in comparison to other area restaurants and bars. One morning we had no water at all, and one of the two elevators was out of order. Check-out took forever because of a $100 billing error. Management finally removed the five $20 "extra" fees because they could not provide proof of what the fee was for. We didn't appreciate them trying to get away with this. The location is splendid. Others on-line have complained about the airport noise--it did not bother us at all.

<Title>“Great Service”
<Content>Just stayed at the Sheraton Marina April 18-April 20. Got the room thru priceline and must agree that at $110, it was worth it. Read thru the preceeding threads and decided to book a room at the West Tower. The rooms are brand new and very, very large. We requested a high room and we overlooked the back of the hotel towards the marina. It was very comfortable. Service was excellent. Checked out the east tower and felt there was alot more activity going on. If you want calmness book the West Tower. It is however about a 1/4 mile between the two towers. We walked there for the pool during the day, but my son went down to the jacuzzi at the West Tower at night. The breakfast buffet at $18.95 was not worth it. Also it is $16 for self-park with in and out privileges. Close to the airport and downtown, but nothing else within walking distance. I loved the views from the room and would definitely return for a short visit.

<Title>“Not bad at all, but make sure you book through Priceline”
<Content>I don't know what the going rate per night is for this hotel, but I'd imagine it's close to $200/night. However, it can be had for approximately $90/night through Priceline. My wife and I got a room at that rate and just spent 5 nights at the Sheraton last week. Overall, I don't really have too much to complain about. The rooms were quite small, but definitely sufficient for 2 people on vacation. You are very very close to the airport and can hear planes taking off on a regular basis during the day, but you get used to it pretty quickly. Overall, the hotel is somewhat noisy. Our air condition made a racket at night and the walls are somewhat thin. Parking is a total rip off--$16/night for "self parking". But if you get a deal on the room it's easier to justify this. You really do need to rent a car as it doesn't seem like there are many public transit options in San Diego, so the parking can't be avoided (there's nowhere else nearby to park). The pool at the hotel is quite nice and very large, and the location of the hotel on the marina is nice as well, and you're just 5-10 minutes from downtown. Also, the lobby is impressive and they have computers set up where you can get online for 30 minutes if you are a guest. Concierge was very very very helpful and the staff are all quite nice. In my opinion, this hotel is a bargain at $90/night. At the full rate, not so much.

<Title>“Not bad, if you get it at a discounted rate.”
<Content>The lobby was nice, when I first walked in. The registration desk people were very friendly at check-in. I ended up in the East Building in the North Wing. The room wasn't anything spectacular, just a regular room. The worst thing that I experienced there was that, despite the scalding hot bath water, when I changed it to shower it was adequately warm, although I had it all the way hot. Self-parking is $16/day and valet is $22/day. They figure they can get you there, since the hotel isn't really close to downtown. I thought that having free internet access, for hotel guests, in lobby was great. The buffet was pretty good at $18. Not like we had any choice because the average dish was $14 (for french toast, pancakes, omelettes, etc.) What would you choose, considering you could get all-you-can-eat for about $4 more? A no-brainer there.

Be sure to book a bay, not marina, view in the west tower (the east tower has not been renovated to my knowledge). Nice complementary appetizers for happy hour in the lounge.

I did not experience any of the airport noise. The hotel staff was extremely polite and professional at all of our company functions. Room rate was $199 which is high - but not for this part of San Diego. It would have been nice if there was a beach, but this is a "marina" hotel.

Finally moved to west tower where the rooms were new so much better but plumbing was being renovated - so inconsistent hot water and broken taps and loo plumbing. Plumbers and random people constantly walked in during the day to fix these. Overall if we had paid $99.00 a night - great but the price we paid we expected a lot more. Service did not make up for the hotel condition either - would def not stay there again.

<Content>Stayed in the West Building at $229 (convention rate) and found all new carpet, paint, paper, and furnishings. Small bathroom, but huge, comfortable hotel room. Surprised that bathroom light fixture is mounted so low that it's impossible to see mirror without ducking (I'm only 5'9"). Very pleasant, attentive desk, bell, and parking staff. Internet service overpriced - try to buy wireless service provided by the marina outdoors - it works from many hotel rooms.

<Title>“Exceeded expectations”
<Content>We brought our entire company (28 people) to this hotel for a weekend stay. No one had any problems or complaints. Beautiful property, great location and excellent service. I would highly recommend this hotel for family travel as well. Anything you want to do in San Diego is just 5 minutes away and being next to the airport was not a problem. The view from either side is spectacular. The best hotel experience I have had in San Diego.

<Title>“Excellent! I loved it”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights for Christmas 2005. Pros: 1) Very quick check-in. Requested for a high floor, 2 double beds, and facing the marina, and got it! 2) Very plush, clean, comfortable beds with 4 pillows (on each double bed) 3) Great views from the balcony 4) 5 free internet access/computers in the lobby: very nice modern setup with flat screen Sony monitors, free printing; also a lounge area with flat screen TV. 5) Large swimming pool, usually almost empty each day we swam; nice adjacent hot tub. 6) Convenience store at the lobby was great and essential 7) Laundry facilities!! very nice surprise; washer and dryers definitely helped during the trip 8) Lobby was nicely decorated with grand christmas tree + aquarium 9) For a hotel located right next to the airport, we didn't hear any planes at all! (except for loud next door neighbors) 10) Never pay anything above $99 for this hotel. It is priced right at $99/night. Neutral: 1) Had the christmas buffet dinner, and it was definitely bland. Alcoholic drinks were weak. Should have gone to a restaurant in the Gaslamp District for much less than the $122 we were charged at the hotel. Cons: 1) Gym/health spa was closed & under renovation. Website was not updated until my day of arrival, so I could not fully complain. 2) Parking is a mess at times; no free spots, so you circle around and around and wait and wait 3) Thin walls- loud people in the rooms next door can bother you 4) Small bathrooms 5) No wireless internet; pay for ethernet access

<Title>“Awful”
<Content>I stayed at the West Tower for 6 nights last week and had 5 different rooms due to the renovations. I spent the week sharing the evevators with hotel staff and hoping it would stop on my floor. I was very disappointed with my stay. The West tower also only has 1 restaurant. I would definately not recommend the hotel here in the near future and avoid a room by the elevator at all costs as you will be stuck listening to them day and night.

<Title>“your standard business hotel”
<Content>stayed nov 20-23 for a conferance, great bed, standard hotel ameneties. What bugged me about this room is there is no mini fridge and no in room safe. These i consider critical for a business hotel, and just what i would expect for this level of hotel. besides these issues an uneventful hotel eitherway. Also this hotel is within walking distance of the airport terminal,(no kidding).

<Title>“Better than expected!”
<Content>My wife, our 2 1/2 year old and myself stayed here back in late August for a late summer mini-vacation. Since we arrived on a Sunday night for a Mon-Tues stay, there were few 'tourists'. We basically shared the hotel with 850 members of a conference being held at the hotel while we were there. Based on reviews on 'Trip Advisor', we selected this hotel as part of our AAA packaged vacation (it included Sea World admission). We requested a East Tower (Main Tower) room with a view of the marina (see photos). Since we were there over a work week, we basically had the breakfast buffet to ourselves and all of the conference members had come and gone by the time we came downstairs. Close to Sea World, Zoo, Downtown and across the street from the airport. Location is great and sure beats the 'Hotel Circle' area (noisy freeway traffic at all hours). And a much better view! We were met by a nice, helpful staff and will enjoy a return visit to the hotel in the future. By the way, if you have kids, they'll love the huge fish tank in the lobby.

<Title>“Hotel Under Renovations”
<Content>I recently completed a stay at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel And Marina. This hotel is current undergoing extensive renovations. During our stay, there was loud pounding and jack hammering from 8:45 AM to 6 PM on a Friday and Saturday. The hallways also smelled like carpet glue and the elevators were used for construction. This construction is very disrupting to a guest expecting a relaxing weekend at a four star hotel. The hotel does not disclose the construction on their website and only informs guests about the renovations at check-in. I would not stay at this hotel again, while it is under construction.

<Title>“Nice room - your typical, generic hotel”
<Content>My company was hosting a conference in both Sheraton hotels. Upon checking in, they had my reservations wrong so my suite was not available. They placed me on the 8th floor with a view of the marina, and enjoyed it so much that I decided not to change. Absolutely loved the view, and being able to keep the patio door open 24/7 enjoying the perfect weather. As far as the conference goes - the hotel messed up continously, so I would not recommend hosting one there. Otherwise it was your typical Sheraton with overpriced food, and a few glitches here and there (like the parking) but for quick travlers who want to be near the airport, it's fine. There was a new, swanky Marriott and Hyatt just a few miles away, in downtown S.D., but I'm sure their prices would be beyond what my company deems appropriate.

<Title>“Nice stay for $200 a night”
<Content>We made reservations for the club level which included parking and breakfast. My husband travels alot and is a gold almost platnuim starwood member. They were remolding the club floor so the upgraded us to a two room suite with two full baths and three tvs. They gave us breakfast buffet at the resteraunt which was excelent with waffles and omlets made to order. That alone would be $30 a person plus $ 14 for parking. Almost everywhere in San Diego you pay to park. I was suprised we did not have internet service which is usually on club floors. After speeking with the manager they let us use the business center for free. I would recomend booking a club room cheeper then all the extras all acart. We stayed 5 nights with close acess to zoo, sea world, downtown events. We did not have any problem with plane noise, my son 8 liked to see the big ships comming and going everyday and the pool was fine to relax after outings.

<Content>Stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina for a long weekend. The hotel is very nice and directly on the water. The rooms was a lot smaller than I expected, a bit cramped (forgot what tower we were in) but still nice. The staff was very accomodating and friendly. The hotel is expensive though, but would go back find I found a good a good rate.

<Title>“Pleasantly Surprised – Awesome Stay!!”
<Content>After reading all the reviews we were very hesitant about staying at this hotel. We had tried Priceline for the first time ever and for $111 we got this room. We usually stay at Lowe’s Coronado retreat, but now that we have a baby, we are trying to save some money. We loved our stay here. The room was super clean and had an awesome view of the harbor. We slept with the balcony door open. Our room was on the seventh floor of the West Tower. It was a nice room (bathroom a little small- but who cares with the view we were given- we didn’t come to bath). The West Tower we are told is not as nice as the East Tower, but we had a great time. We had dinner at the East Tower. Our son was hypnotized by the huge beautiful fish tank in the lobby of the East Tower. The staff was super friendly and helpful. We found the bellman to be the most informative. We just found the whole experience to be a surprise, we expected bad and we got great. We never heard planes, we didn’t have a bad room, we just had a great experience!

<Title>“Very Nice but Very Noisy”
<Content>This was a very nice hotel. Our room did not overlook the ocean but instead the airport. Airplanes take off from 6:00 AM until 11:00 PM. They are very close and very noisy. Pools were very nice and the conference areas were nice as well. The rooms were good and the beds were very comfortable. Charges for everything from fitness room to delivery of room service (thought that is what room service is for). Stay was not great but very nice.

<Title>“Better than we expected”
<Content>After reading the reviews for this hotel in the weeks leading up to our vacation in late August, I was terrified about what we would encounter. However, since my expectations were so low, due to the other reviews, we were pleasantly surprised. Our check in was very easy with an attentive valet and pleasant front desk staff and the Bellman, Andy was very friendly and quick! (our bags were in our room within minutes of our check-in and even then he was apologetic about the "delay") Self-parking fees are steep, but we never had any trouble finding a space close to our room and our Key Card actually worked, for the whole six days. We were given a room in the East Tower, right over the pool, which could be noisy if the window was open, but it was great for our daughter to be so close to the pool. We only ate in the bar, for dinner, which wasn't any more expensive than any other hotel food. Our room was clean and we had no complaints about the service or our stay. As we had booked our trip through Expedia, we had a nice stay for the price we paid for high season in San Diego. The only complaint we had was that there were very few restaurants close by. It would be tough if you were staying for a conference and didn't have a car. All in all, it was a nice stay at a nice property.

<Title>“This is not a four start hotel..”
<Content>The Sheraton is a convention hotel. I and felt like I was just part of their massive operation there.. and as soon as I got there I had to deal with extras that I was not interested.. like the automatic registration for this and that... The first morning I got 3 wake-up calls at 5:30am which I did not request... they even thought it was funny. Its a pity because the area and sorrounding environment is really nice!

<Title>“Hey - It's a Sheraton! By the Airport! It's Nice!”
<Content>Stayed at the Sheraton Towers Marina for two nights - August 19 and 20. Make no mistake, this can be a very busy place. Especially in August as folks make one last getaway before the start of school, etc. We reserved a nice "cozy" room on the Club Level that had a fantastic view of the harbor and downtown from the 11th floor. Staying on this level also gave you free self parking and a very nice continental breakfast each morning. Worth considering if you compare to their other room rates where these two items could run you an extra $30 to $40 per day. Rooms were very quiet considering you are less than a half mile from the airport. The location is great - you are really only a 10 minute drive from Old Town, Downtown, Sea World, Balboa Park, and other locations. Two lowlights - check-in on a Friday evening (about 6pm) with only one clerk at the desk. It took forever - what were they thinking about staffing on one of their busiest nights of the summer! The other issue was the A/C in the room - it only runs on AUTO mode, so it can be a real sleep stealer if you are a light sleeper. The staff was all very nice and the grounds are certainly pretty. We enjoyed our stay.

<Title>“Good Value for Tourists”
<Content>We stayed the west tower, which after reading other reviews looks like we lucked out! Although the east tower (the main building in all the photos) has the nicer pool, the west tower was bright, clean and quiet (and has a fine pool and hot tub). Check-in was easy and we were given a very nice, clean (over-sized) king room with a couch and balcony overlooking the bay. We are starwood preferred guests, so we may have received an upgrade and didn't know it. The Sheraton Sweet sleeper beds are heavenly and sooo comofortable. The bathroom was nice, a little small, but still fine. The room did not have an alarm clock...which was weird, but the wake up calls were fine. We did not hear any commerical planes from the airport (which is very close)...by the pool you can hear the navy planes from across the bay. I ate breakfast one day in the restaurant, $18 for a waffle & OJ - so we went to a denny's on pacific highway (very close) for the rest of the week. This was a great location with very easy acces in minutes (literally like 5) to downtown, balboa park and highway 5 if you have a car. They charge $16 for parking a day -- and the gate didn't work right the entire time we were there. (Its $22 a day for valet) I got two days removed by pushing their service guarnatee back on them...and they easily agreed. The bell staff was nice, although we prefer to just wheel our own bags. The elevators at the parking lot end of the hotel need some paint, but it looked like they were in the process of fixing them. We ended up here on a deal from a travel site - and we would stay here again, but we would definitely request the west tower!

<Title>“We Loved It!”
<Content>I was very impressed with the hotel. We were there on our honeymoon Aug 15th-20th and had a great stay. Maybe this is because I asked for a nice room at check in? We were in Lania room 5320 of the east tower with a lovely view of the pool and harbor. The spa staff is rude so I didn't book with them, but there is a spa on every corner in San Diego. I recommend Elaine at the Meridian for hair and make-up. I would give the hotel 3-3 1/2 stars. We wanted a clean and safe place to stay and this fit the bill. The key card readers on the self parking gates do not work. This is not a big deal as all you have to do is take a ticket and tell the gaurd your room number when you leave. We had an excellent time with parking. We got a spot directly in front of the elevator to our room the entire stay. The hotel also has a fabulous location. Request the east tower with a pool view and you'll be happy here. :) I only wish my camera had picked up the view in the background.

<Title>“Could have been worse, but definitely could have been better...”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton in July. Pros: -The hotel itself is attractive. -The bed was very comfortable. -Our room was clean. (This was the only reason we didn't attempt to find another hotel.) -The pool and hot tub were large and nice. -We had fun playing pool at the sports bar, which is even family friendly. -We had a beautiful view. Cons: -The rooms are worn and outdated. (We changed rooms twice to compare both towers.) -The bathroom was small and unappealing. -The hotel is not far from downtown, but it's still distanced from everything. -The valet was the worse! No one opened my car door for me, or even assisted us with our luggage. Maybe they were busy, but this was not a good impression. Maybe we are just to picky, but there are so many beautiful hotels in San Diego and this was not one of them. For us the actual room we stay in is most important, and this Sheraton offered nothing special in their guest rooms.

<Content>I stayed at this hotel over the 4th of July as was moderately satisfied until about 3am on the first night when I was overwhelmed by a strong methane smell, the hotel said it looked into the problem but the smell got progressivly worse as our stay went on. The hotel expressed concern but did little, if anything, to fix the problem. There are many nice hotels in San Diego and I would strongly recomend avoiding this one.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>We recently stayed here from 7/27-7/30. The room is adequate, but small. If your troom overlooks the marina and pool as ours did, you have a beautiful view. The pool is very nice. There is a reasonably priced restaurant adjacent to the pool, Waterworks. It closes by 4;30/5:00. It would be nice if it stayed open later so that families could enjoy it for dinner as the restaurant in tne hotel is pricey for kids and the pub appeared loud and not kid friendly. The hotel is in a good location...near the airport (you don't hear the planes in your room and they are not offensive if you're outside) and close to downtown...we were probably 10 min from Petco Park, 20 from the zoo and 10 from old town. My only complaint is that they charge $16 to park your car...you are their hostage as there is no where else to park. This was unacceptable to us and after complaining they removed three days of parking. Also they failed to deliver extra pillows and blankets and we received a $50 credit.

<Title>“Sheraton not a 4 star hotel”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and marins in San Diego. I paid for the club level rooms which included free breakfast in the executive room and free parking. The room faced the marina and bay. Room is small and lacked finer comforts. A basic room, not worthy of a 4 star rating. Small closet and one dresser. Below the room are the loading dock for hotel and parking lot. I was on the 11th floor and every morning, we heard trucks loading and unloading supplies. They were errecting a tent and we heard every hammer and truck. Airport noise is almost non-existent but truck and motorcycle noise was constant. If you are seeking a view in this hotel, ask for side side facing downtown. More scenic and quiet. Parking is a nightmare. Key cards did not work for self parking. I attempted to enter lot late at night and key card did not open the gate. Several cars behind me caused a mini traffic jam while I had to reverse. Found a attendent to assist me. The lot is huge and very dark. Not safe for a woman alone to park a car alone. Paths to the hotel are not marked and we stumbled through bushes and a unexpected 5 foot drop trying to find a side walk. Valet parking, a $8.00 additional charge is almost a necessity. WE complained about parking at desk but clerk did not seemed concerned. No method to test key card until you try to park. To late! Internet is available for $13.25 per 24 hours. Wireless service not available. Outside eating opportunities are very limited. The pool in east tower is very nice and quiet. Overall, service is very good and employees will assist patrons. This is a convention hotel, not designed for families and tourists. The west tower would offer a better view of the bay. Not a four star hotel. Club level rooms not worth the extra money.

<Title>“Beautiful scenery”
<Content>We spent 3 nights at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We stayed in the East Tower (the West tower looked nice, also). The hotel is situated on Harbor Island, where there is a marina with yachts, boats, and sailboats. We had two rooms, both were very clean and well-stocked with towels, soaps, shampoo, conditioner, coffee & creamer. It also had a hair dryer and an ironing board with iron. The beds were very comfortable. We had trouble figuring out how to set the alarm clocks, so we just dialed the automated "wake-up" call, which only took a few seconds. We also could not find any pens in the room to write postcards, but did find some next the the pay phones near the lobby. We also had some trouble with the air conditioning controls. The thermostat had a setting to run the fan low, medium, and high. We turned it on high, as we like the humming sound when we sleep. However, it would turn on for about 10 seconds, then shut back off. The room temperature was comfortable, but we couldn't get the fan to stay on. The hotel restaurants were somewhat pricey for us, considering we had children. They offered a breakfast buffet for $18.99 per person. Our children are too old to be offered the children's prices, but also not big enough to eat $18.99 worth of breakfast. Instead, we bought pastries and bagels from the cafe, and that ran about $20.00 total. There were only a few restaurants on Harbor Island, so bring a car or your walking shoes, because you may have to walk about 1 - 2 miles. Even though this hotel is very close to the airport, we didn't notice a lot of noise. Occassionally we would hear a plane flying by, but it wasn't very loud. It was actually a bonus, as we ate at a restaurant down the street late on evening, and the view of the planes flying over the bay was beautiful. The service we received at the check-in counter was average. We paid for our 2 rooms weeks before our trip (via check). However, their records didn't show our room as being prepaid, so they asked for our credit card. I was very concerned that they didn't show us paying $1400 and told them we had a cancelled check, but they didn't seem concerned or even try to help. They just wanted our credit card so they could check us in. After more discussions, I finally got the name and extension of a person in accounting to talk to. However, I could not get ahold of this person and left voice mail. The next day, I still had not heard anything, so I went to the check-in desk and found out it was taken care of. I think they could have at least called us and told us they fixed the accounting error, or apologized. But at that point I was happy that they agreed that we did indeed pay for our rooms already. The concierge was extremely helpful in helping us plan a sightseeing tour. She had very much information and was very knowledgeable. Since there is no beach on Harbor Island, we went swimming the the hotel's pool. However, the evenings were cool, and we didn't realize until the last night of our stay that there is a whirlpool just a little ways down from the outdoor pool. Once we found that, we spent the evening in there. The hotel also says they have a game room. However, all we saw was a couple ping-pong tables, and couldn't find the paddles or balls. We would stay at this hotel again, mostly for the beauty and the comfort. All the other things didn't really matter, because we were there to sight-see, not to spend the day at our hotel.

<Title>“Very Poor Value. Definitely not a repeat.”
<Content>Unfortunately we booked through Expedia and was originally booked at the Hampton Inn. Somehow we got bumped(!) from the Hampton and moved to the Sheraton. Actually we were happy about it because we thought it was a four star hotel and that we had been upgraded. Ha! For the money this was the worst place we have ever stayed. Room was average size with a very small bathroom (I think they reserve these rooms for Expedia, etc., it was very worn with stains eveywhere including the hallway. First floor with no view at all. $4.00 bottled water, and no refigerator. The breakfast buffet was $20.00 and parking $16.00 a day. We parked in the handicapped parking where there is no charge but the staff charged us anyway assuming that we parked in regular parking though it never registered through our card which you use to access the regular parking lot. By the way, a cheeseburger costs $13.00! We highly recommend travelers to San Diego (a beautiful city with tons to do) choose another facility. I checked with Consumer's Report when we got back to Dallas and sure enough all Sheretons are rated very low as far as value goes and the number of problems encountered.

From the time I stepped off their airport shuttle service and entered the front door to the time I exited the door and returned to the airport they were highly attentive, responsive, and helpful. The shuttle driver even helped me carry all of my recently purchased items into the airport ticket line. I would definitely return to this hotel whether for an event or an individual leisure trip.

<Title>“Watch out for the "Lanai" Rooms”
<Content>We stayed for 2 nights during a recent visit to San Diego. Given the price we paid, I was disapointed to be given a room in the "Lanai" section of the hotel which appears to be an old, converted motor lodge. The rooms were old, musty and overlooked the airport runway (constant noise from 6:00AM - midnight). Overall the lobby, tower rooms, and pool area were nice, but I would recommend avoiding the Lanai section.

<Content>I just returned from a stay at this hotel and we enjoyed our time there. We were in the East Tower on the 10th Floor with a city view. We have stayed at this hotel before and always try to request a city view room and view of the airport. This may sound strange to some people, but we actually consider it a plus that the hotel is right across the street from the airport, as we enjoy watching the planes land and take off and noise does not bother us. The lobby is nice, with a nautical motif and large fish tank. The one thing I found "funny" is that our room decor did not seem to complement the nautical theme of the lobby. I almost felt like I was in two different hotels going from the lobby to the guest floors. The room was what I would call fairly generous in size (at least compared to some other cities). Since the hotel was nowhere near capacity during our stay (in fact is was empty the first 2-3 nights), the casual cafe/coffee shop was not open for breakfast. Only the main dining room was open. When a conference group came in during our 4th day there, they opened all the restaurants. We really did not utilize the dining options. For the first 3-4 nights we were there, the main pool was closed for repairs, but the smaller pool was open until 10pm. The healthclub also closes at 9pm. The hotel offers both valet and self parking. I would definitely plan to stay at this hotel again.

<Title>“Hotwire patrons beware”
<Content>We stayed here around Christmas. Got a special on Hotwire, which seemed like a good deal at the time. However, we were placed in one of the "Lanai" rooms, which is basically a sprawling, 2-story complex of dark, musty rooms with a hallway open to the elements. Think of this as 3rd class in the Titanic, assigned to the common riff-raff who try to save a few bucks. Not much better than a roadside motel. The room was adequate, but nothing special. The grounds themsevles were well maintained, and had a great pool and marina area. Good location near downtown. No airport noise to speak of. However, If I were to ever stay here again, I'd definitely want a tower room.

<Title>“Good View and Location”
<Content>We were here for a conference Jan 30 - Feb 1 , 2005. We stayed in the West tower (the smaller one) which had less amenities (smaller pool, less restaurants) but seemed less busy (reception less chaotic) and I prefered it to the East tower because of this. The pool at the West tower is fantastic looking though. Our room faced the harbour which was a lovely view and quieter than facing the marina. Marina facing rooms also face the airport and a busy road. The harbour facing rooms don't hear any airport or traffic noise. All rooms have nice balconies. The room was standard corporate design and needed redecorating to modernise the curtains and wallpaper. The beds and bedding were really nice and comfy. The room/plumbing were quiet. The location is great. Easy to find your way back to as you follow airport signs! Close to the highway and central to many attractions. The self parking is easy (charge). There's a nice walk along the harbour, and along the marina between the 2 towers. I probably wouldn't stay here if I was paying for it myself, unless there was a good deal on. After the 2 nights here we moved to the Empress Hotel in La Jolla, a smaller hotel.

<Title>“It's good to be G.O.D.”
<Content>We spent two nights here during the week between Christmas and New Year and at checkin found that I was G.O.D.: The Guest Of the Day. The staff greets you by name, you get to park right out front, we were upgraded to a small suite and breakfast was thrown in. Not bad on a $129 rate with a $25 credit to be applied to services (which, perhaps because of my heavenly status, was unused and thus deducted from the bill) for a nice hotel. We were there during the start of the horrendous rainy spell they've been having in Southern California and one day was a bit of a washout, so we shopped. The other was bright and sunny and although we didn't swim, the pool area looked clean and pleasant. We had no airplane noise from the airport: our room - on a Preferred Guest floor - faced the sea, not the airport. The room itself was fine - the balcony large enough to sit outside (on the good day) and the location of the hotel - near the airport but in the harbor - makes access to San Diego and the surrounding areas easy. My interactions with the staff were all friendly and helpful and the hotel is maintained in spotless condition. The lobby and other public areas are - as mentioned elsewhere in these reviews - spectacular. The only fault I found was the hotel's Club Lounge - it was overrun with guests, mainly families with children; seemingly unmonitored by anyone other than the beleaugered waitstaff and the breakfast offerings were minimal. I would urge anyone to consider this hotel if they want to be downtown (or close to the airport) without being downtown. I am a Starwood Platinum Guest and have stayed at perhaps one-third of Starwoods worldwide properties. The San Diego Sheraton is one of the better SW hotels in this category.

<Title>“had a merry Christmas”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton Christmas Eve and Christmas before heading on a cruise. Everyone was friendly, helpful and courteous. Upon arrival we upgraded for $20 since I had read the tip at Trip Advisor. We had gotten an excellent holiday discount on the net from the Sheraton, so we paid very little for such a nice room on the 10th floor. The Christmas decorations and music were lovely. The redecorated restaurant had a special Christmas menu. Someone who has a lot of money might expect a much fancier place. The hotel was perfect for two teachers, a teenager and a retired couple. We felt pampered.

<Title>“Don't bother”
<Content>I visited San Diego for a conference and the conference was held at this hotel. I didn't have a choice of hotel so I stayed. Some of my colleagues stayed at the "overflow" hotel, which was the Westin and that hotel outclassed the Sheraton in every sense of the word. The Westin is comparable in price and in the middle of downtown... a much better choice! The lobby of he Sheraton was constant mayhem for the five days I was there (Saturday through Wednesday). The service at the main restaurant was horrendous and a hostess was never to be found. The menu is the same in the other restaurants in the hotel and also the same for room service... so much for choices. PLUS... There are no mini-bars in any of the rooms! The concierge and front desk staff were very helpful, as were the business center staff. But the business center is not open very late. The hallways smell like a toilet when the staff is cleaning the rooms... although they are very friendly and accomodating. The location is what is also one of the worst aspects of this hotel. It is an airport hotel... if you are going on vacation, you DO NOT want to stay in the airport hotel. A cab to the gaslamp quarter or to Sea World is about $12-$15 (with tip) and to the border of Tijuana, a cab will cost about $40. The trolly is nowhere near this hotel so you would have to take a cab to a trolly stop to try to save money on getting around.

<Title>“Just another airport hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this hotel Oct. 4-8. We booked through Hotwire and were given a complimentary upgrade upon check-in - we ended up on the 5th floor of the west tower with a view of the marina. The pros: friendly staff, comfy beds. The cons: a boring and nondescript property - if you just need a bed near the airport - this would be a fine choice. We did not have a car - my husband taxied back and forth to the convention center ($11-$13 each way) and I took the complimentary hotel shuttle back to the airport (a 3 minute ride) to catch the city bus ($2.25 fare) to downtown. Harbor Island is not a place you will find much to do - if you were to walk to the downtown area, it would be about 3 miles. Airplane noise was constant, but only heard by us when we had the balcony door open. The west tower was a short walk to the east tower - which is where the main lobby and restaurants were located (west tower had one expensive Italian restaurant). Overall, the west tower seemed to be the neglected step sister - the pool and grounds were nothing more than plain. If you do end up staying at this property, an independant deli exists between the towers, and you can pick up sandwiches, wine, pastry, coffee, etc.. for a fraction of the cost the hotel will charge you. Simply put, there was nothing special about this place, but nothing to complain about either, considering we payed $100 a night.

<Title>“Good memories from San Diego vacation”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton Harbor Island the last week of September 2004, in the East Tower. We booked through Expedia and upgraded our room when we arrived for 20 dollars per night (we expected to upgrade from the most basic room that a travel package would give you). We had a 10th floor room overlooking the marina and the pool--and a little bit of the harbor could be viewed. We were very pleased with the room and the service. All employees were very friendly and helpful. The room was spotless. The pool was very clean. We were surprised that we did not hear any airport noise whatsoever! We walked down to the west end of the island one evening and had fun watching the huge ships in the harbor. This hotel is very close to downtown (at the most, 5 minutes drive time--you could probably walk there) and Point Loma. We rented a car and parking was 18 dollars per night, but there is no place in San Diego where you don't have to pay to park, and this was a very secure, guarded lot. There are a lot of areas in San Diego where we visited and parked our car and worried about things being stolen from it, but Harbor Island seemed a very secure place where you could walk around at night and not be concerned about personal safety. We have absolutely no complaints and would stay there again.

<Title>“Never Again”
<Content>I stayed here because it was the location of our convention. The bed wa comfy, but there was one problem after the next. Remote didn't work, Shrek 2 was corrupted and overlaid with porn (a negative?), the first minute of a local call cost $13.00, and the shower curtains are cheap. It's as if the hotel couldn't decide if it wanted to be high class with its 'service promise' or a budget hotel where all the added expense is nickled-and-dimed out of you: phone calls, parking, health club access, etc. The room had stained carpets and felt dingy. I'd choose not to stay here again, and I'll probably skip all Sheratons. One star performance: Chris, the bartender and server in the italian restaurant onsite, is great. I was shocked to find great food and service in this restaurant with the days of disappointment experienced at the hotel.

<Title>“Beware the "Lanai Rooms" adjacent to East Tower”
<Content>We were given a "Hotwire Special" room: a dark, dank first floor room in the "lanai" area of the East tower. The room had a lovely view of a...wall..., was dark and dreary, and most importantly, had a bad mildew/mold odor. They could not/would not relocate us that night to a habitable room, so we were walked to a motel. They seemed to know right away what we were talking about with the mildew/mold complaint. Why are they assigning guests to rooms with that kind of problem? We came back the next day, and were given a better room and a food credit to use at the hotel. The main East tower pool was cold and did not appear to be heated. The room was adequate in size, but not spacious. This new room had no airport noise, and a nice view. The views from the upper stories are the best thing about this hotel, including its waterfront location. No in room safe, robes, minibar, newspaper, or other amenities common to that type of property. We had to laugh...the room cards STILL didn't work on the parking gate! Unless you can get a really good rate and guarantee a decent room, there are better values elsewhere. If you do encounter a problem, speak up immediately and insist it be corrected, or at least that you are offered something under their "service guarantee."

<Title>“Nice Hotel, Fabulous Destination”
<Content>This hotel was great. We stayed five nights in mid August of 2004. The pools were great, the lobby beautiful, and the restaurants delicious. The room was pretty standard, however it was nice to have down pillows and a real comforter, not just a bedspread. The staff was awesome! Although, there were a couple problems.. forgotten hairdryer in the room, no newspaper, and one night the neighbor's alarm went off for about two hours. The good news: Sheraton was more than apologetic.. they gave us $50 off our bill and two free lunch vouchers (a $20 value). This treatment was a nice surprise and much better than just a "sorry". We'll definetely stay there again!

<Title>“very pleased”
<Content>My family had the pleasure of staying at this Sheraton for three nights this mid August. It was the last stretch of our first vacation to California. We had a fabulous time and that included our time at the Sheraton. Upon checkin we were greeted by a very friendly attendant who offered us the option of city or bay view which was very much appreciated. We chose the bay view which also overlooked the pool area and we found it very lovely. The hotel had all the amenities we could have wanted...from a nice restaurant (a bit high, but what hotel restaurant isn't), a beautiful view, take-out food restaurant, beautiful pool area with pool bar, a lounge,a fitness center, my son had a private tennis lesson and it even had a laundry room which was so much appreciated at the end of our trip! The location was very centralized to access all the tourist areas...from la jolla to coronado, downtown to old town, it was all very easy to get to from the Sheraton. The only thing I was kicking myself for was booking my return trip back to Boston from Long Beach, while we could have (should have) left from San Diego....the airport was right across the street! Which by the way, we could hear no airplane noise as the room doors were so airtight. I would definately recommend staying here and hope your stay and service provided to you will be as pleasant as ours. We encountered none of the problems of the previous reviewers. Just a note, we did stay in the east tower.

<Title>“Sheraton San Diego--A Split Personality”
<Content>From 25-28 July my family and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel And Marina. While our stay was comfortable, the fact is that this property has a split personality; the East Tower has the lion’s share of facilities/amenities while the West Tower (where we stayed) is the poor neighbor. The West Tower of this property does not match it's sister tower. The hotel’s two towers separated by over 400 yards (a 5-10 minute walk); while I have experienced similar “sister” properties, this is my first experience with a hotel that has such disparate distance AND quality levels between segments of its property. The West Tower’s facilities included a 3-meal restaurant, pool/spa, and gift shop. It lacked the following amenities offered in the East Tower: 1. Concierge service 2. Casual Restaurant/Tavern 3. Lobby Bar 4. Fitness Facility 5. Comprehensive Business Center 6. Pool Restaurant The West Tower just exuded an aura of neglect—the building exterior is in need of refinishing, and the hallways, especially adjacent to meeting spaces, had a musty odor. The pool area was neglected for much of the day—in several instances, the pool towel supply was exhausted and repeated calls for replenishment for not heeded. The sole bright spot was that the rooms in this tower are comfortable, nicely furnished, and larger than those in the East Tower. There was no mini-bar (West Tower mini-bars had been discontinued), no bathrobe, and no comprehensive Business Center in the West Tower. One (1) of our two (2) phones was not functioning, and building maintenance had to be called to fix it. The second morning of our stay we discovered that our in-room coffee supply had not been replenished. Finally, our room had no phone books. All of these oversights were corrected in a timely fashion, but they added to the effect that you were staying on the “wrong side of the street.”

<Title>“Wonderful hotel”
<Content>This property is now my first choice in San Diego. I just returned from a two-night stay at the Sheraton Shelter Island (East Tower) and I couldn't be happier. From the minute the smiling Samantha checked us in at the front desk, I knew my experience was going to be good. The room was more than adequate, the view spectacular, the staff uniformly charming and accomodating. I used the concierge to book dinner at Red Tracton's in Del Mar. I used guest services to purchase passes for the zoo. I used the safe deposit box in the lobby. My every contact with the staff was met with professional, friendly and gracious service. I travel frequently for pleasure and I've stayed at some of the most highly regarded resorts in this hemisphere. This hotel property well deserves the four-star rating. The professionalism of the staff would actually put it in the five-star category, at least for me.

<Title>“Very nice hotel”
<Content>After having read all of the negative reviews of this hotel before our trip, I felt compelled to share my opinion. My family of four just completed a 10 day California coast vacation which ended with two nights in the West Tower, 7/28 and 7/29. We loved it. We had a room on the 10th floor overlooking the marina and the airport. Terrific view. Personally, I love to watch the planes take off. But, since there was very little airplane activity between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., we were able to sleep with the balcony door open and let the cool, fresh San Diego air into the room. The noise was not a problem. We did not use the West Tower pool, but the kids loved the pool at the East Tower with its volley ball net and basketball hoop. Yes, it's a 5 minute walk from one tower to the next, but it's along a beautiful marina. What's not to like about that? A lot of reviewers have complained about the parking situation. Well, our room key did not work in the parking lot the first night, but the attendant was very helpful and let us out without a problem. I got another key from the front desk the next morning and it worked fine. I saw it as a very minor inconvenience. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants. With all of the great restaurants in San Diego, why would you want to? Take the short drive to Seaport Village, the Gaslamp Quarter, or Old Town. We did have breakfast at the deli along the marina one morning and it was fine. We are looking forward to our next visit to San Diego and we would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Depends on room that you get”
<Content>I have stayed in both the east and west tower. The east tower has the updated standard room that you see at most sheratons. Small but modern furnishings with great beds/bedding. Great for business traveler. Parts of this tower have been renovated and some have not. The concierge lounge with free breakfast was in an outdated area and was unappetizing (but great view). Make sure that you do not get rooms on corner with trash dumpsters below. The noise no matter how high up you are will wake you up. For a more relaxed and leisurley stay, you might request the west tower. If you do make certain to request a renovated room. The rooms on floor 6 on airport was nice with view of harbor, and was charming. Do not (surprisingly enough) stay on the top level. Theses rooms are OUTDATED and musty. Beautiful skylights as you walk down the hallway with nice sconces on the walls but be prepared to better see the dirty stained carpeting. When you get off the elevator it is dark and the furnishings stained. In the rooms, you have a jetted tub but it is a very old model and I was frightened at what might be in the jets. Most requested rooms are the rooms with view of the navy pier. Less noise from airport. But stay higher up so that you do not get noise from parking lot or street. The fitness center was ok even though there was a fee but there is also a nice jogging trail around the dock. Beautiful. Good restaurants in both towers. If you want a hotel convenient to airport this is great but with all the nice hotels in San Diego I don't think that I would choose this one again.

<Title>“Very bad hotel, very bad location...”
<Content>My wife and I just returned from a terrible, noisey, and unfriendly stay here. We booked through an online travel site and got a decent rate of about $110/night. Because we booked through the internet discount site, the hotel was very rude to us, treating us like second class citizens. They actually said if we wanted a decent room (and not the one on the first floor facing the parking lot) that we should re-book our reservation through the hotel. (even though they knew we had pre-paid online which wasn't refundable) The air-conditioning turns off every few minutes and you must get up to turn it back on, all NIGHT!! When we complained, the front desk was extremely unapologetic and truly didn't even PRETEND to care. We heard many other guests complaining and some checked out early as we arrived. We are frequent travelers and have never been treated so badly. There is also tons of airplane noise as it is directly across from the airport and there is NOTHING within walking distance. You must park your car in their lot which will cost you $16/day for self-park, $22 for valet. My other complaint was that concierge recommended bad restaurants to us. In fact, we showed up at one and left as it was a total tourist trap. That really annoyed me. We informed them we were food lovers (we live in NYC and are used to great restaurants--not fancy necessarily---just great food) and we were sent to overpriced, bland places filled with travelers. Everything about our stay was very disappointing. There are much better hotels for the price. I suggest going to stay in a better area where you can walk around and not be constantly alarmed by the planes flying constantly overhead. Stay somewhere where you will be valued and appreciated.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay 6/22-6/27”
<Content>Room was smallish but comfortable in the East Tower. The view was excellent. We watched a Naval aircraft carrier on maneuvers our last day there. The balcony just fit the two chairs and small table. The room was clean and suited our needs. The upside to this hotel was the excellent service, the pool, the view, and the comfortable bed. The only downside to our stay was lack of hot water and water pressure during peak times. It wasn't cold, just luke warm. And the food is okay but you could do better elsewhere. Parking is expensive. $16 for self park, $22 for valet. I would recommend bringing your cell phone or using the lobby pay phones if you don't upgrade. $2 charge for local and 800 number (that's each call). Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton and would recommend it.

<Title>“Great West Tower location!”
<Content>I just returned from two nights at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina. When I was told my room was in the West tower, I was a bit concerned after reading the reviews here. However, I couldn't have been more pleased. My room was on the corner of the top floor (12th). It had floor to ceiling windows on two walls with a huge (larger than the room) rooftop patio which I entered through a french door. The patio had two sun lounge chairs, a glass top patio table with four chairs, two additional chairs with a small table, and a potted palm tree. The patio overlooked the wedding garden, pool, marina with boats on the right and across the water to the left was the military helicopter pads and ships. Across the water I saw a fireworks show one evening. The patio area was perfect for enjoying breakfast and the wonderful San Diego weather. When inside the room I didn't hear any airport noise. Rarely outside did I hear airplanes. The interior of the room had plush down comforters and pillows on both beds with soft sheets. The bathroom was large with marble floors, walls, and glass enclosed Jacuzzi tub and shower. The bathroom also had real plants. The sink counter area was large. I heard no noise from any other rooms, never even heard or saw another guest on my floor, though I know there must have been some, since housekeeping was cleaning rooms besides mine. The only negative things I noticed were stains on the carpet, the ice machine on my floor was broken, and I had no remote for the television. These were minor details easily overlooked with the many benefits of this room. I looked forward to returning to this room at the end of each day, and would love to return to this room on another trip!

<Title>“west tower”
<Content>We were at first disappointed when the shuttle driver told us that we were in the west tower, because of the reviews I read here, but our room turned out to be beautiful, we had a great view of harbor, and did not hear any airport noise at all. (we were facing south) They did try to nickel and dime you for everything, and we did not use the gym, because they charged you $10 to do so. What we did for a car rental was use Enterprise, they came and picked us up, and there is free on the street parking right in front of the hotel, in which there were spaces available even during Memorial Day weekend. We used our car for the day, and then turned it in that night (Enterprise allows you to turn it in right there at the hotel) and did not have to pay the ridiculous amount that the hotel wanted for parking. There is a store about a block down with a deli and cheap breakfast, where you can get drinks for your room. Only other complaint was at times there was little hot water.

<Title>“A motel with a view”
<Content>Beware the "west tower" if you're unlucky enough to be booked at this hotel. This Sheraton is basically a high rise motel with a good view (from some rooms). The scoop is there is the main building and a separate "tower" -- which is essentially another hotel taken over by Sheraton several years ago. The condition of the west tower is poor and the room decor and amenities poorer than poor. My room was so dirty I had to wipe obvious foreign matter off the walls with a wet towel. When I objected at check in to being placed in this Siberia, I was given the brush off and told the West tower was "better" because it used to be a Westin -- huh -- maybe during the Carter administration? Also, if you're attending a convention beware the check out -- there's a shuttle bus but it fills up quickly, leaving people with flights to catch walking the mile to the airport. Finally, if you're not into $20.00 breakfasts, you have the choice of a grim little deli nearby. Nothing, I repeat nothing, is within walking distance of either Sheraton tower.

The service was fine, but the prices in the restaurants were so high we went to other places for meals.

We bought a "vacation package" from Hotwire that included this hotel and airplane tickets from San Jose, CA.The staff was all helpful and pleasant (except for one instance described below). The main complaint I have is that I was expecting a 4 star hotel and what I experienced was a 2.5 star facility. We were given a room in the "West Tower". This seems to be the older and more run down half with these deficiencies:1) the single small swimming pool at this tower was not heated and too cold to swim in 2) the room did not have a fridge (had to pay $16 to have one brought in to our room)3) the hotel does not have a VCR even to rent4) our "upgraded" room ($20/night extra) showed signs of age and had elevator noise5) the tub was clogged the first day (they fixed it and gave us a pancake breakfast)6) bathroom light bulbs were burned out our whole stay7) the parking (extra ~$16/day) had a gate entry that never recognized our key and the exit was often delayed with a line of cars8) the elevator closest to our room was very run down, scratched, dingy, but functionalAs a final complaint: We went to the "East Tower" to go swimming since they had a nice large heated pool unlike the "motel" pool at the "West Tower". When we finished swimming, we could not find a bathroom or dressing room of any type to change in. When we asked the fitness center attendant where we could change she treated us like we were'nt even guests. She asked what room we were staying in (what does that matter?) and when I told her we were in the West Tower room 795 she said we would have to pay a fee to use the fitness center dressing room. I told her that was ridiculous and she suggested that we walk through the adjacent restaurant and into a single bathroom and change there.... we were treated like second class citizens. When reading the Sheraton hotel description you sure don't get the glaring distinction between the towers.Again, my complaint is that I was sold a "4 star" hotel and what I got was much lower than that standard.Al Tadros

<Title>“Wonderful Experience”
<Content>Having read some of the complaints here about the San Diego Sheraton Marina Hotel I must admit I was a little nervous, having booked there thru Hotwire. My family and I arrived on April 8, 2004 for a six night stay and right away we knew this was going to be a great vacation. We pulled up to the East tower where we were told by the valet that our reservations were at the West tower, a block down the road. We were offered a room upgrade for $20 a day to the 11th floor (which we accepted) with a wonderful view of the marina and the surrounding San Diego area. Everyone at this hotel bent over backwards to see that your stay was exceptional. Our room looked across the Marina at the aiport, which though busy was not a distraction nor did it interfere with our sleeping. The room was clean and comfortable and again the service was exceptional. They do nickel dime you a bit especially with the parking fees but hey, everthing is more expensive in California. Overall we would not hesitate to stay at this Sheraton again.

<Title>“Too Isolated, Too Noisy, Bad Parking, Bad Choice”
<Content>My wife, two kids (ages 7 and 3), and I stayed in the East Tower from April 6-9. We upgraded to the 15th floor Club Level (the highest floor on which their are lodging rooms), free self-parking (normally $16 per night), and free continental breakfast (normally $11.95 per person). The hotel is on a man-made island adjacent to the airport. With the exception of a walking trail around the marina, the hotel is not walking distance to anything. The room itself was fairly small (approximately 10 feet wide and 20 feet long (including the bathroom)), furnishing nicely and in good condition (except for some mold on the ceiling above the shower/tub). It had a sliding door leading to a small balcony with a view of a good portion of the marina, and further away, downtown San Diego. We checked in at night and the view of the city lights was very nice. However, within a matter of minutes we were assaulted by the noise of airplanes taking off, seemingly directly over our room. The airplane noise decreased after 10 p.m. but during the night the air conditioning system made a loud metallic kicking noise when it turned on. The aiplanes returned at about 5 a.m. We could also hear a lot of motorcycle and other fast moving vehicle traffic from the street below. On our last night, we heard a child crying all night in the room next to ours. The self-parking is limited to those spaces farthest from the hotel; the spaces that are near the hotel are reserved for valet parking. The first night I had to hunt for about 10 minutes to find a parking space, and it was about 250 yards from the lobby. I found slightly closer parking spots for our second and third nights but they were still unacceptably far away. The continental breakfast is a buffet on the Penthouse level. Each day the selection was the same: nice pastries, bread for toasting, dry cereal in individual boxes, Yoplait yogurts, and fruit salad (watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, strawberries, pineapple, and a few blue berries). To drink, there is coffee, tea, milk and orange juice. There are about 10-12 tables, all of which have table clothes and a view of the marina. There were usually two waitresses, but their job is to clean up and keep the buffet stocked; they do not serve food. There are much better places to stay in San Diego. I have stayed in many hotels in San Diego, including the Sheraton's West Tower twice (it is better than the East Tower), and the Sheraton Suites (nice rooms but weird lobby and inconvenient loaction). If you want to be near the airport, in addition to the two Sheraton properties, there is also a Hilton (I have not stayed there). The convention center is not very far from the airport and there are many hotels near it. If you want to be able to walk to the beach, you need to choose a hotel in a different area of town. If you want to go to Sea World or the Zoo, there are also better places to stay. In sum, there really is no reason to stay at this Sheraton, it is noisy, the parking is bad, and it is not near anything other than the airport.

<Title>“Loved the Sheraton”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diegofrom 3/25/04-3/31/04. We booked through a discount website and got an incredibly low rate ($94/night).After booking the trip, I read the reviews that had been posted and began to get very nervous about our choice. When we arrived, we went to the East tower, as it is the first one you come to. Before we even got out of the car the valet checked a list he had and told us that we were in the West tower, right around the corner. We were told at check-in that we had a limited-view room. We opted to upgrade for $20 a night to a room on the 9th floor with a gorgeous view of the bay and the navy base. (We really enjoyed watching the navy ships and cruise ships come and go.) The hotel was great. The room was clean and all of the employees were very pleasant during our stay. We had room service three of the nights and it was very good.We were told at check-in that they were having problems with the keycard access to the parking lot. They said just to take a ticket to enter the lot and then throw the ticket away. The card worked fine to exit the lot. We didn't find this at all inconvenient.While it was slightly annoying paying $16/night to park, when combined with our nightly rate, it was still much cheaper than published rates for this hotel.The only complaint we had was the airconditioning in the room. It would shut off during the night and the room would get too warm. This meant getting up and turning the unit back on. There is a small deli/store located at the marina between the East and West towers. We had breakfast there each morning. It was very good.The location of the hotel was very convenient to all locations. We will definitely stay here again.

<Title>“No complaints here”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Resort from March 19-March 24 and were thrilled with our choice!!! We had booked at Sheraton.com and had a great rate! We were on vacation for the week and stayed on the 11th floor in the west tower. We coudn't have been happier with the view of the naval habor with the carriers and other boats going by. The staff was friendly, courteous and we never had a problem with parking, the taking of the ticket was quick and easy. Being located on Habor Island Drive was an easy access to everything we wanted to do, although if staying here a car is a must. We had a great deal with a convertible for 12 days with Budget with unlimited miles for $250!The rooms were large, spacious, well cleaned while we were there and the front desk employees were friendly and helpful. When we arrived we did go check out the east tower, which I thought had a nice lobby and outside area. We never had time to go to any of the pools although they looked very nice.When going back we will stay at this hotel again!
