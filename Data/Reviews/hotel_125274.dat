<Title>“"Little" Gem in Midtown - not for the Closterfobic though”
<Content>The location is fantastic! One small block away from the 6 train which can get you almost anywhere with transferring stations really close by. The beauty of this neighbourhood is that it's not really a touristy spot, you get this local city feel. However, when you walk 4 small city blocks up, you're near all the big shopping stores near Heral Square. Korea Town is also just 2 to 3 block away! You get the best of both worlds. Hotel Lola itself has a nice modern lobby, dark with sexy colors. You always want your staff to be friendly, Lola does well! Lola is also very clean. I had a standard room with a queen bed. I don't know about the other rooms, but as other reviewers say, the room is quite small so better put that in your expectation. My girlfriend and I walked in, there's about 5 to 7 feet of hallway before you hit the bed. The bed has about 2 to 3 feet on every side of it and that completes the room. The bathroom can pretty much only be used by 1 person. Talk about utilizing New York real estate! But for the price and value of the area, this can all be enjoyable. I don't know if they offered breakfast, because we were always on the go, becasue of the cool spots and eateries around here. If you want more space, you're probably better off in another hotel. If you want great location and a descent environment, Lola fits the bill!

<Title>“Hip Midtown digs that had mom delighted and the tween giddy”
<Content>I took my almost thirteen-year-old to NYC for the first time and chose Hotel Lola because of its great location. It turned out to be the perfect choice. We had a lovely room, a suite really with a living room and then two sliding doors between the main room and the bedroom. The decor was sleek. The service was great. And we could walk to Central Park and 5th Avenue as well as the West Village. My daughter could not stop talking about how cool it was and I loved the low key feel. The relaxing vibe of the music and the dim lighting was a welcome treat after a day in the city!

<Title>“Buyer beware of tiny rooms”
<Content>I booked a larger size queen room for two nights through a Sherman's travel deal and received a certificate for a free upgrade when I posted a notice that I was traveling here on linked-in. When we arrived, they didn't have an upgraded room available, so they gave us breakfast vouchers instead. But then when we went to the room it was the tiny-small queen room. When I went downstairs to notify the desk that they had made a mistake, they said they didn't have any larger rooms available that night. But they did offer to put us the in the king suite the following day. The staff were helpful and responsive give the situation, but it was frustrating to have to switch rooms. The decor of the whole place was great, but my husband and I couldn't pass by each other in the room. We had to climb on top of the bed to get around. I don't know if I would stay here again unless I could guarantee that I got the larger queen room at least.

<Title>“Would stay again, but...”
<Content>I'm a New Yorker who now lives in the burbs. I have been trying out various hotels because I need to be in town for business a few days a month. Hotel Lola filled the bill in terms of location for my needs.The location near the 28th street subway and being mid way between my uptown clients and downtown friends is perfect. And near Grand Central - equally perfect. No room service doesn't bother me since I spend time with friends and eat out while I'm in the city. And there is a 24/7 deli on the corner of Park and 29th street, and you can get coffee and breakfast in the lobby restaurant starting at 7am -- and the lobby bar serves up a nice nightcap. And no bellman didn't bother me since I only have a overnight bag. What I didn't like were the elevators that needs to be wiped down and the 'do not disturb' sign had a pair of handcuffs and a heart and says that 'I'm tied up right now'. It's cute but the humor isn't for everyone and I felt it cheapened my business stay and the hotel quite frankly. I'm no prude but it's cheap humor and made me feel like I was in a hotel that some paid for by the hour. But hey, maybe I'm not the audience they are after and others love it. For my nickle It was a bad attempt at being 'edgy'. I was prepared to pay for their internet service however I was not prepared for the sign-in process not to recognize my name and room number. I also wasn't prepared for hanging on the phone for their tech guy who wasn't there. I lost patience for this problem being this is 2012 and free internet is everywhere - I got dressed and got to the office I work out of instead of what I wanted to do which was work from the room until check out. The room was okay - pretty much true to the pictures. The bed was fantastic with tons of pillows and I slept like a baby which I rarely do when I'm not home. The lobby is overly dark as are the rooms. Lighting is not Hotel Lola's strength. Check in process was easy and the people at the desk are very nice. Would I stay again? Yes. But I will deal with the internet thing when I check in! This hotel is no frills but has heart and great value for NYC standards.

<Title>“Absolutely Beautiful”
<Content>Hotel Lola was absolutely amazing. When we arrived we were greeted by the frendliest staff, and given a key to our room with no hassel and no long check in lines. I was taken back by how quaint, clean and modern our room was. This was me and my girls very first time in New York and Hotel Lola absolutely exceeded our expectations! We had an awesome view of the city, and Lola was so close to everything we literally had New York right at our finger tips. The concierge was extremely helpful, and house keeping was always on time. All in all Lola was excellent in a safe neighborhood and provided us with all the space we needed. For a first time in NYC we had a great time and Lola was simply " the icing on the cake!"

<Title>“Love NYC- Hotel Lola the good and Bad”
<Content>I was surprised that there was no one to help with my bags, after I got my suitcase up the stairs and to the main desk. I was given my room card and told to go up to the 12th floor, no one escorted me up there. I was happy with the room, although the air con was blasting and my remote control did not seem to be working. I went down to the reception to find out how to turn the air con down and sort out the remote as there was no hand guide in the room. I was informed there was no hand guide and someone would come and sort out the air con. I eventually sorted the air con out myself. The same day I went down to reception to ask them to book a taxi for me, I was informed it was very expensive and told to go out of the hotel and turn left and hail one. I explained this was my first time in NYC and would prefer some help. I was told it was easy and I would be fine. I left and went to try and hail the taxi.15 mins later I had no luck, a porter from the Roger hotel came to my rescue. All in all this is a beautiful hotel, I think the management need to look into customer service a lot more. Saying that, I don’t have a bad word to say about the ladies who cleaned my room. They were so polite and so kind, a lovely young lady from Florida and a lady who is originally from Eritrea. Thank you for the lovely chats and for making my stay so pleasant. The lady on the concierge who every day would mark my map and tell me what subway line I needed to get on to help me around. Thank you.

<Title>“Convenient to MSG-Trendy With Good Service”
<Content>The hotel staff was very welcoming and the decor was trendy. The price was great-we took part in their opening special and stayed one night for less than $200 total. We had a problem with our room, and we were switched without hesitation, and given two free drinks and breakfasts. The room was a good size for the city, and the bed was very comfortable, as was the temperature. The view was unattractive, but we didn't care. It was quiet. It's an easy walk to Madison Square Garden, and close to the Breslin, which we loved. The bartender was lovely, but the bar is a little small.

<Title>“good location, nice rooms”
<Content>Spent Christmas week in NYC, staying at the Hotel Lola- formerly the Hotel Thirty Thirty. Our room was unusually large by NYC standards and very clean and comfortable. We had a corner room with two windows that were decorated very well and had multiple blinds for light/privacy. The hotel is very close to the Empire State Bldg which was very helpful when navigating around- you just had to look up to find your way back. It was a five block walk from Penn Station.The lobby is rather dark but as it doubles as a martini bar I guess it's understandable. We really loved the concierge- he gave several excellent restaurant recommendations and had theater tickets if we had wanted them. As noted, Internet is not free but there is a coffee shop around the corner that has free WiFi.

<Title>“This place is a sham.”
<Content>They gave me a room right next to the elevators that made noise all night long. The room was stuffy and hot. Beware because wifi is NOT included and they charge $14 a day for it. The windows do not block out the light from neighboring buildings and possibly reveal everything to those nose neighbors. All this and the front desk people were rude. Well the concierge was nice. This hotel is a total ripoff and you are better off staying at a place that is 10 -15 dollars more for a better place.

<Title>“Great Location; Very Clean Hotel; Kind Staff”
<Content>We arrived late on Thursday (3/8) night. I had read online that rooms facing 29th street were loud, and requested a room that did not face 29th street. Unfortunately, there were only three rooms left in the hotel at that point, all of which faced 29th street, but we were kindly upgraded to a king bed in a VERY CLEAN handicap-accessible room (544)- it was very spacious. We could hear some street noise throughout the night, but earplugs from a local drugstore solved that problem very quickly. From a tourists perspective, the hotel has an amazing location at 29th and Madison. We were easily able to see areas north of the hotel on Friday (such as MOMA, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Grand Central Station, Times Square and the Empire State Building) and areas south of the hotel on Saturday (the High Line Park, Ground Zero memorial, Wall Street, Brooklyn). The hotel lobby is very trendy and has a nice bar (caveat- cocktails are $15/each). We were treated very kindly and very warmly by all staff, including the front desk, the bartender, the concierge, and the maid service. For those who care, the hotel does not have room service or a door man waiting to greet people. Starbucks, drugstores, small grocery stores, and many cafes are all within 1 or 2 blocks of the hotel. Prior to our trip I read a few negative comments about the hotel. I did not find these to be true- our hotel floor did not smell of smoke, and we did not see any evidence of bed bugs.

<Title>“Small but great location”
<Content>We stayed 5 nights at Lola. The standard rooms are really small, but the Junior Suite we booked through Jetsetter was fine. The Suite consisted of 3 separate rooms: a sitting desk area, bedroom, and bathroom. All the furniture and furnishings were updated and modern. The location is great, at 29th and Madison. It's only a block or two to the subway (6). The service at the hotel is fine, without being anything special. We had a billing issue, but it got resolved. One of the housekeepers was very helpful in getting our room cleaned quickly when it had been overlooked at 5 PM one day. I'd probably stay here again, but only on a discount rate. We paid $200 a night, including taxes. I probably wouldn't pay much more than that for this hotel.

<Title>“Great Location, helpful reception staff”
<Content>Second time staying here, having stayed in Oct 2011. At that time, they were nearing the end of their refurbishment, which was all finished by this visit. First room was a standard room, and was clean and looked fresh, however, with this being New York, not as big as being used to UK based rooms - this is standard for NYC. Following a visit to front desk, and a request to upgrade and a returning customer, we're moved to a bigger suite on 5th floor - this was a big room! Was a disabled access room and was given a discount on the upgrade as I had stayed there previously. As this room was disabled access it was as big space, with plenty of wardrobe space and a large bathroom and shower. I would recommend LOLA as a great location, with access a few blocks from Empire State and shopping on 5th. Room was clean, and on both my stays, following a request at front desk I have been moved rooms, with the manager remembering us from our visit in Oct, which I thought was great customer service.

<Title>“Stylish hotel with a great location”
<Content>I'm a former New Yorker who came down for the weekend and stayed at Hotel Lola. First off, the location (in the Flatiron District) is great. It's a block from the 6 train, and very convenient to Penn Station. Short walk to the Empire State Building, great local restaurants, but not nearly the tourist mob that's near Times Square. The hotel has undergone a stylish renovation, and the lobby is sexy and elegant. We stayed in a king bed room on the 9th floor. It was on the corner of the building, with two large windows. For a Manhattan hotel, the size was generous, though the bathroom was pretty tight. As mentioned, the bed is like a giant marshmallow. Liked the fluffy down comforter; slept like a baby despite the noise from the traffic (unavoidable in midtown; bring earplugs if you're sensitive). I didn't use the wifi, but I agree with other reviewers that in a high-end hotel it's tacky to charge for it. Desk staff was friendly, and there were no hassles. We traveled here on a Jetsetter deal, which was an excellent value, but it's harder to judge how good a value this hotel would be at full price.

<Title>“Had a great stay in 2009 and going back in 2013”
<Content>Hi I stayed in this hotel for 7 days in Feb 2009 and found this hotel to be great, it was called thiry thirty hotel, the rooms are your standard hotel rooms, they are not apartments so no kitchen facilities. So you will need to be eating out if you stay here. The room did have a bath and as you do lots of walking in NYC the bath was a great feature for tired legs at the end of the day. For the price we paid it was worth the money. It is in easy walking distance to everything, times square, empire state, central park, serendipities :) I found the staff friendly, and the house maids at the time were lovely as my mother wasn't feeling the best one day and the housemaids kept checking in on her, which was lovely. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in new york for a hotel style room, I am heading back to NYC in Feb 2013 and will be staying again at the Thirty Thirty Hotel, now known as Hotel LOLA.

<Title>“It was OK! Well located though....”
<Content>My girlie and I had a great weekend at Hotel LOLA in Feb. Its location was amazing close to everything we needed and the room was just the right size. Our only upset was the fact that we didnt have free wifi in the hotel. It was for sale a $20 a day. That was very disappointing since wifi these days comes at all accommodation facilities and is provided in coffee shops everywhere. I think it should be included in the your nights stay and be free. My only other upset was the dark lighting in the hotel even during the day. I am not sure if they were trying to hide something but, it mad us feel unsafe and wondered a few times if we were in the right place. Overall, it was location exactly were we needed everything and I would stay there again if the price was right :o)

If they made available free wi-fi at least in the lobby, it would be perfect, but I'll be definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Title>“Not 4 stars”
<Content>Let me start with the no's in order of occurrence: No bellhop to help get bags up the entrance stairs No one to help open the entrance door which awkwardly has to be pulled while balancing bags No information in the room on the hotel. Mmm how do I order breakfast? Answer you don't. No room service. Info in the room would have been helpful to let guests know what nearby options were. No room snacks or water. No glasses to drink tap water - yes there were some plastic disposable cups stacked in the bathroom. Eeew, sorry, I for one don't like aerated bathroom cooties on a drinking glass. On the pro side, this hotel is good value if you are ok with the 3.5 star experience. The foyer is glam and gorgeous and the room decor is equally contemporary. Loved the comfy beds. The bathroom was mod, although the tile grout could have done with a good scrub to remove what looked like rust stains. Wireless Internet was available . In summary, this hotel was a place to sleep and not the boutique experience I had hoped for.

<Title>“A nice surprise”
<Content>Really enjoyed our one night stay here. The price could not be beat--$134/night. I upgraded to a deluxe room which was worth it since it gave a bit more space. Rooms were clean, modern and the bathroom was huge. Location was nice too and within walking distance of many restaurants. There was a private event going on in the lobby/bar upon first arrival so the bar was closed to guests. Lobby was nice and definitely going for the W concept of a local place to hang out but this hotel seemed to be more inviting than a W. I would definitely stay here again but I am sure prices will go up.

<Title>“Great value for the location”
<Content>I am from NYC and was back for a 5 day visit. I know this area as being a great location for the city, but was unfamiliar with the actual hotel itself. When I booked it, the name was Hotel Thirty Thirty but then changed names to LOLA. I booked a single room, figuring it would be all I needed. The single room in this hotel is DEFINITELY only for one person. It had room only for a twin bed with a tiny desk next to it. Everything else was built into the walls to conserve space. If you are claustraphobic, not a great choice for you. But it was perfect for what I needed- a clean modern place to stay. The lobby is in the center of the hotel, with no windows and very dark. Nice modern furnishings though. The hotel was very crowded and the front desk always had a line, but the staff were ok. The one exception was when I was trying to get internet access for my room. There is a cost for this, about $13 or $14 per day, but I could not even get a signal long enough in the room to even pay for it (thankfully because it would have been a waste). The man at the front desk told me that "obviously the internet reception would be better in the lobby" and to call their technical support team. I sat on the phone for 20 minutes with technical support, through router re-boots, etc, and it turns out that there just wasn't a strong enough signal in my room or in the lobby. I did need to get work done so had to go elsewhere to get a connection So overall, this place is great if you are trying to get an affordable hotel while staying in NYC (which is mostly impossible) and do not need to get work done via internet access. I would only get the twin room if you really don't care about space.

<Title>“BED BUGS”
<Content>BED BUGS Room was so small that it was impossible to open bathroom door, as it would hit the bed. If you are overweight, good luck getting in there. We had heat on full blast but the room was still freezing cold and just did not get warm the whole two days and nights. We had booked a cruise, so had booked 2 nights pre cruise and two after the cruise. Spoke to the manager and he kindly booked our second stay in a larger room to accomadate our 6 suitcases. Wish he hadnÂ´t been so kind as the larger room was big, but infested with BED BUGS, and freezing as well. By the third email sent to the manager he replied that he had investigated the room and found no evidence of bed bugs. He is wrong, we are bitten from head to toe and the itching is still unbearable ten days on. Have taken pictures and they say more than a thousand words. There were no bites after our 5 star cruise ship, this is from Lola. Not enough to paint and put new sheets on the bed to call a hotel refurbished.If the manager had just promised to rectify the situation by fumagating the room and refunding the two out of four nights, I would not be writung this review. Once home in Iceland, we had to wash EVERYTHING out of the suitcases and are still worried that they we may have brought them home with us. DISGUSTING and distressing. I am contemplating a lawsuit, have traveled the globe from one star to five star in four continentsr and this is the only time in my life I have encountered these horrible creatures. Hotel Lola, 4 star, what a joke.I read other reviews from other guests and apearantly we are not the only guests to have encountered these not so posh hotel guests, the bed bugs Only wish I had read the reviews before booking Lola. The manager can deny all he wants, the proof is clear. The staff were polite and friendly. The hotel appears to be very clean, but that does not change the fact that lurking in the shadows are disgusting bed bugs.

<Title>“will be staying again”
<Content>This hotel is amazing, from the minute we walked in to the minute we left there is not one thing we could complain about. The lobby is luxurious and perfectly set out, the hotel staff are amazing, the bell boy was a bit rude but he was the only person we came across that had a bad attitude. The rooms weren't huge, but you are in New York City and don't spend a lot of time in the room anyway, but they were modern, you could easily move around and they were clean. The beds were to die for, so comfortable, I had an undisturbed sleep every night. My boyfriend even wanted to find out where the duvet and pillows were from it was that comfy. We were impressed with the newly refurbished, clean bathroom and the huge TV and complimentary IPod docking station. We had breakfast in the hotel one morning and it was lovely, the food was hot and there was a lot of choice. I would definitely recommend the "Bread & butter" deli on the corner of the entrance on 29th street, we ate there every other morning. We could not fault this hotel at all, we have been home one day and already booked in to go next year. The location is close to everything, about 2 streets away from the empire state but its not too near all the hustle and bustle. If you are looking for a hidden gem in the centre of Manhattan that is luxurious value for money, stay at LOLA!

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>We stayed here for my 40th birthday me my husband and two other couples. The staff were very helpful and accomodating. The room granted was small but definately served its purpose as we didnt spend long in there. The only downside was we were next to a resident who screamed all night, and whom had police officers at her door on one of the days. We were in 802 i think. All in all i would return and absolutely loved new york including the quaint little irish bar across the road

<Title>“Great location, OK hotel”
<Content>We originally intend to stay 5 nights but a change in schedule meant we could fly out earlier & it took real effort to alter the booking, I finished up phoning 3 times from the UK. Arrived on the Friday night & an OK small room so next morning we asked about paying for an upgrade when we returned as we were going to Washington for 1 night. The front desk said we needed to ask when we returned, which we did not nothing was available so another night in a small room. Next day we did manage to upgrade to a much bigger room, however a few quibbles. No light or bedside table on one side of the bed so we both couldn't read in bed. Only just enough wardrobe space, a very small bathroom & the shower ran onto the floor of the bathroom. No tea or coffee facilities. A final one, why do so many hotels not have coat hooks on a wall, when you come in all you want to do is hang up your coat, not even any for towels in the bathroom. There were, however, many positives. A great location with different subway stations nearby, easy to walk to Penn station for our train to Washington & to visit friends in New Jersey. We liked the bar & had a couple of drinks there. The front desk staff were always very helpful. Final plus point, we ordered an early morning taxi to go to JFK, we had a stretch limo for the same price. We would recommend Lola but be aware of its limitations.

<Title>“Hidden Gem!”
<Content>We recently spent a week at the newly refurbished Hotel Lola, having read reviews before we set off we were quite apprehensive, but we had nothing to worry about. As soon as we arrived we were met by friendly reception staff who proved to be helpful throughout our stay, as did the concierge who was a fountain of knowledge and extremely helpful. We had managed to book a junior suite at a bargain price and wow what a lovely room it was, a huge king size bed and a great sofa bed, both exceptionally comfortable, both with a large flat screen TV. The bathroom was well lit and the shower was good. It was ideally situated in the middle of Manhattan, a 10 min walk to Madison Square Garden, the same to the Empire State building, just off Madison Avenue and close to 5th Avenue it was perfect for shopping as well. There was a lovely Cafe over the road, plenty of restaurants and a corner/shop/deli where you could buy New York Cheesecake at midnight if you fancied it! The suite did not have a kettle it only had a coffee machine and we had to ring reception for refills. A minor discrepancy but we liked our coffee.

<Title>“Great Hotel in excellent location!!”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel couple of years ago and was happy then but after the renovations and rebranding was really pleased to find this has made a good hotel, great!! Modern rooms with big comfy beds, spacious shower rooms, flat screen tv and ipod alarm clocks. Clean, tidy and with good service. Fabulous reception with bar and restaurant. Reception helpful and extended all our rooms until 1pm on checkout day without any extra charge!! Hotel is opposite a great Irish bar and has starbucks on the corner. Its situated 2 mins from Empire State Building and a 5 min walk from Macys / Madision Square. Also found a great little coffee / cafe place 1 min away, good for breakfast / lunch. Room prices were good. Overall a great hotel, in excellent location!!!!

<Title>“Would recommend to anyone! Great location !”
<Content>Stayed at the hotel Lola for 5 nights mid feb. Weather was fab. Nice clear cold days great for photos! Room was by far spacious enough for the time we actually spent in there. Only downside was that the shower leaked so we had to use our towels we were given to soak up the water. Definate safety hazard, floor became very slippery once it was wet. Bed was very comfortable and nice tele. There was a safe in the room which was free of charge. We had a room on the 9th floor (903) which had a breathtaking view of the empire state building. Overall we had a great time and wouldn't hesitate staying here again. Only other thing was that there was a alight smell of smoke throughout the corridors which wasn't pleasant but wasn't a problem once in the room.

<Title>“Comfortable. Convenient. ChiChi!”
<Content>First â€“ full disclosure. I did not pay the currently listed price of about $200 per night tor s single room at the Hotel Lola. I responded to an online offer for about $100 per night. I could have stayed at another hotel in the area with a shared restroom and free Wi-Fi â€“ but I was drawn in by the hotelâ€™s transition (I booked it when it was still Hotel 3030) and hotels were not cheap over the Presidentâ€™s Day weekend. I was in town for one purpose â€“ theater â€“ and more specifically â€“ to see Carrie the Musical! Commendations: It was a very comfortable room. It was smallish â€“ yes... but big enough for me and my one piece of luggage (carry on!). I got a room on the third floor facing the back of the hotel... nothing spectacular but a large bathroom with an of so comfy and soft bed. The space/electric heather warmed the room just fine overnight (it was near freezing for my long holiday weekend stay). There were drawers galore to stash my stuff â€“ I like to put my things away and feel more lived in... even for a few days. There close included an ironing board (did not use it â€¦ and where would I have put it... maybe it was bed sized) and iron. I did not expect that. The N/R subway line are just a few blocks (3 â€“ 10 min. walk) away at 28th street allowing me quick access to Times Square and the theater I came to see. There were not a plethora of eateries in the vicinity â€“ mostly knock off perfume shops, a few corner delis, and a bar/ bistro across the street. Tips and words for the management: The idea of a desk or chair that really couldnâ€™t be usedâ€¦ wellâ€¦ itâ€™s a nice thought and makes real the promise of a desk and workstation. But there was no way I could have pulled the chair out and sat in it and worked at the desk. The char was up against the bed â€“ curse of the small room. Okay management â€“ is 2012. Who travels with less than 3 or 4 devices that have to be charged at night? I did make this trip without my lap top but I did need to charge my IPhone (good thing there was an I-compatible clock radio that would charge it â€“ if I were not an IPhone owner I would have needed another plug that was not available). One plug was available on the desk â€“ that was taken by my Kindle Fire (I did not pay the $14.00 per day internet fee â€“ I instead camped out in McDonaldâ€™s and Starbucks for my heavy internet stuff â€“ both are near the subway entrance). Suggestion â€“ power strip or how about a multi-plug adaptor in one of the drawers? I am thinking this has to be an anomaly. Warning â€“ this get a little yucky. I came back after my first day away and after the room had been cleaned to find razor stubble still in the sink (which by the way is tiny and too close to the wall to put your face over and spit into or wash). It had not been cleaned. And the toilet â€“ had dried urine and a few hairs (yes mine from you know where) on the rim. And... hey â€“ Iâ€™m a guy who doesnâ€™t always aim correctly at night and the floor still had evidence of my nocturnal miss. I photographed them (attached) and the next day notified the management. Returned the second day after the room had been cleaned â€“ the sink was clean but the toilet was unchanged. Really? Even after I told you the toilet, sink, and bathroom floor had not been cleaned? Iâ€™ve emailed management and Iâ€™ll update with my reply. Overall: Good stay. Quiet. Comfortable. Elevators were always available. Staff was attentive (other than the bathroom thing). Subway is easy to get to (3 blocks one way and 4 blocks the other way).

<Title>“Trendy Friendly With Some Small Issues but Overall GREAT!”
<Content>First let me say it's all about location and this is a pretty damn good location. I walked to Grand Central Terminal every day (12 blocks) and it was 8 minute walk to Penn Station and 14 min walk to Times Square. I got to the hotel early and they made an effort to accomodate me before check-in. The staff is great. The lobby is "cool" and the bar looks nice though I didn't use the bar or the restaurant. I went to my room to crash and when I entered I was a bit shocked. I know hotels can be small in NYC but this was smaller than a dorm room. They call it a "single". It's a "bed" which is built into some drawers and then a bathroom with a closet. I passed out on the bed and realized being 6 ft tall -- my feet hung off the bed. I went to the front desk and the young lady promptly upgraded my room so I could spend the next five days with my feet ON the bed. I got a nice, small room with a queen bed and it was on the 9th floor. The water pressure is pretty good in the shower. The maids were prompt and thorough. The one complaint - when you sit on the toilet - your knees pretty much almost hit the wall. Its funny because you have to move the garbage can around in the bathroom just to use the bathroom because it's always in the way. The large tv was great. There was an iron and board. The heart worked well. Some floors, like 10 where the ice machine was located, ALWAYS smelled like smokers paradise. Not sure if people were allowed to smoke but I guess that doesn't stop people. The place was a GREAT value at the special rate I got for their remodel special. If you can get this hotel for a reasonable price....this IS the place to stay. Thanks Lola!

<Title>“Excellent location and price, few downsides...”
<Content>This is one of the most reasonably priced decent hotels in Midtown Manhattan. Short walk from the green, yellow and orange lines of the subway, with excellent connections to most places. The hotel is very clean, well-maintained and decorated, relatively quiet. Lobby is very impressive, tall celling, has almost the feel of a interior of a cathedral. The service is very good, the personel is friendly and helpful. There are a few drawbacks that prevent me from giving it 5 stars, though. First, there is no coffee maker in the room. Surprisingly, there is no coffee in the lobby either. So to get a cup of stimulating liquid, one needs to go outside to one of the many coffee shops around. Second, the airconditioning units in the rooms are located in a recessed area in the ceiling. That serves a very good purpose if the room needs to be cooled down, but to raise the temperature in a cold winter day, it takes a long time, especially if you are sitting at the very small desk to work on your laptop and expect your feet to be warm. Finally, the soundproofing of the rooms can be improved, although I did not have problems during my stay. Despite the drawbacks, the hotel is a good value proposition for the area and is recommended.

<Title>“Couldn't have asked for better!”
<Content>With a quick business trip in NJ, was thinking of spending the night in Manhattan. The grand reopening rates at the Hotel LOLA made me decide YES! Formerly the Hotel 30 30, this refurbishment significantly upgraded this property. I had a single room, and the website states the rooms are small (approx 125 sq ft), however, plenty spacious for one person. Room was clean, bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was stocked with all of the required amenities. My reservation request of an upper floor was honored, and the front desk staff was friendly and accommodating. The rooms have a European feel. The location of the Hotel LOLA is close to several subway lines.

<Title>“Trendy new hotel in a great location.”
<Content>We got a great deal on this hotel using Jetsetter. It was our first time using the site, so we weren't sure what to expect. What a pleasant surprise. Hotel LOLA was trendy and comfortable. Very close to the Subway and a short walk/cab ride to the East Village. The room was large for New York standards. We were on the 10th floor, which I think used to be a smoking floor. The hallway smelled of stale cigarettes, but the room smelled fine, so it wasn't a problem. The staff was always friendly and helpful. There is a decent gym and a business center, and a cute bar in the lobby. I would stay here again.

<Title>“Nice hotel, great price.”
<Content>I booked a special re-opening price offer and on arrival I got up-graded to a good sized room. It's a nice hotel in a very central area, not too far from anything. It's very clean but has little character. The lobby is fairly dark with a purple theme and "cool" wallpaper music, doing it's best to give the hotel a "boutique" feel. Staff were all very pleasant. The fan in the bathroom didn't work and the shower controls are not set up right. My room was very noisy, like sleeping on a plane and it had a lovely view of the back of the next building. Overall it was OK, and I'd stay there again, but only if the price was right.

<Title>“Great re-opening deal”
<Content>We got 30% off our room as the hotel was reopening after being renovated. The hotel lobby is really nice, dark lighting and trendy. Staff were friendly and polite. Room was spotless with comfy queen bed and big hd tv. Nice bathroom - shower only though. Location is ok, in midtown so accessible to both uptown and downtown and very near to Lexington avenue line 6. Nice restauarants nearby too eg umi sushi on 31st, Penelope on lexington, 2nd avenue deli downsides were that the room lacked a few amenities that you might expect from a 4 star hotel, eg no fridge, wifi is $14 per day! But apart from this we had a great stay

<Title>“Girlie Weekend In New York”
<Content>My daughter and I stayed in the Hotel Lola from 9th February to 13th February for a girlie weekend in the Big Apple. The position of the hotel is excellent for getting out and about - just a few blocks down from the Empire State Building. The reception and bar area were lovely - if a little on the dark side - drinks at the bar were, however, expensive. Our room was adequate - a bit on the small side and the one thing that we really missed were tea and coffee making facilities especially as the bar does not serve coffee. Overall it was comfortable and clean although we arrived back one afternoon at about 4.30 and the room had still not been made up even though we have been out all day from 8.30 in the morning - the maid did knock and offer to make the beds etc but we were ready for put our feet up for a while. On our departure the bellman was extremely helpful - taking care of our suitcases for us, organising a taxi to Newark airport and carrying out two very heavy cases to the taxi for us. We thought the position of the hotel was excellent for sightseeing - we did most of our sightseeing on foot as we didn't want to miss anything! All in all we would recommend this hotel - taking in account the comments above

<Title>“Great Property in a Nice Neighborhood”
<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Lola during a recent weekend visit to NYC. The staff is very well trained and quite professional from the front desk to the bellmen. The lobby and rooms are well appointed and very hip. The rooms are clean and very functionally comfortable. The neighbor is centrally located to the major business districts but as tourist attractions. However, it is tucked between Madison and Park Avenue South in a more residential area giving one a more relaxed feel to the visit.

<Title>“A great start to the holiday!”
<Content>We stayed here last week (feb 12) for my fiancees birthday and loved the hotel! We flew in to Newark Airport and it was easy to get across to Manhatten (Airtrain from the terminal to NJ train station then a train to Penn Station. Trip took no more than 30 mins...then a 15 minute walk to the hotel.) Location is right in the heart of Manhatten, 5 minute walk to Empire State and 15 to Times Square. Some lovely restaurant/bars nearby too. The room was lovely, with a huge, although unheated bathroom...but the massive walk in shower made up for it. The staff were friendly and helpful and the manager even arranged to have some birthday flowers delivered to our room while we were out!! The only negative was that reception was a bit slow on arrival, but on the whole I would definately recommened it.

<Title>“The time of our lives!”
<Content>We arrived at Hotel Lola by Taxi from JFK. All taxi's are priced at $55 + tip and toll charge from the airport and takes about half an hour. We got into the lobby and instantly felt comfortable, with the relaxed atmosphere it had. The reception was very helpful before directing us to our room. People are saying that the rooms are very very small. Although they werent massive there was enough room to move about and make plenty of mess with all of the shopping. The room was very modern and clean and cleaned daily by the maid. The room also had a great view of the Empire State Building A special mention should go out to all members of the concierge who were particularly helpful throughout our stay as well as helping us find a lost bag in TGI Friday's at Rockerfeller Plaza. The location of the hotel was perfect with just a short walk to the subway stop on 28th which linked with Grand Central, where you can pretty much get a train to anywhere or if not will take you to Times Square where again there are plenty of trains! After the first couple of days we found that the Subway was a lot cheaper than the taxi's. One down side to the hotel was that there was no free wi-fi, however with Starbucks seeming to be on every block in New York, you could go to anyone of these to access the net. Overall we cannot wait to go back to New York and will definately stop at the same hotel!

<Title>“Good value”
<Content>Stayed in Oct 2011 during its final phase as hotel thirty thirty - lobby renovation was just wrapping up. The room was small but comfortable - not altogether unexpected for NYC. Nice modern finishes - great air temperature control including a great fan that worked as white noise for heavy sleeping. It was only after a couple days that I realized it may have been better to stay closer to Herald Square -- this location felt about 2 blocks outside of a great zone. But still had nice options within walking distance for breakfast, late night, etc. Also within a few blocks of the subway which was great. Had no issues at all with check in / check out, noise, crowds, etc. Bid this hotel on priceline so was nervous about it initially, but pleased in the end.

<Content>This hotel was perfect for us! I was concerned about finding a hotel in a safe area, and as a female, I definitely felt safe walking around this neighborhood and staying in the hotel itself. The hotel was very affordable, the room was a nice size and decorated modernly. The main lobby was beautiful, and the staff were very polite and welcoming. The hotel is in a great location, it is close to the Empire State building as well as a subway line. The only concern that we had was that our air conditioner did not work well in the room, but even with that tiny problem, we were still very comfortable. We would stay here again in a heartbeat!

We were given a lovely room on the 12th floor with wonderful views of the Empire State building, the hotel also kindly gave us a complimentary breakfast. Rooms are compact, but are very clean with nice shower and lovely comfy beds. Great central location to get to see all the New York has to offer, would definitely reccomend this hotel and would stay here again.

Surprisingly there was no information in the room about the hotel: Wifi access, facilities etc - this would have been very helpful to have. I had a few issues during my stay and reported these to a very nice receptionist. She assured me that a manager would email me however I have still not received any communication which is a shame.

<Title>“For that price- will be back soon..”
<Content>I was very impressed when entering the hotel. The lobby was modern, and had a very nice atmosphere. Check in went smoothly and the staff were friendly. The room was renovated and looked great- however, it was a bit small, but I assume that's normal for NYC hotels. Room had bed, desk, chair, closet, safe, iron and iron board. We asked reception for a fridge, and a guy brought us a fridge (think they are used to it). Only some rooms have coffee makers, so if wanting a coffee maker you need to request that type of room when checking in. The bathroom was pretty big (loved it). In the basement there is a small gym, but a pretty good one- all new and good equipment. Location of the hotel was PERFECT! We had a starbucks just down the street, and the hotel was located close to the subway, and with walking distance to some of the main tourist attractions. Only negative thing is the price for wireless- WAY TOO EXPENSIVE- We bought wireless one day and the connection was so SLOW- it was useless.. You are better off going to starbucks and use their internet. Don't pay for it at the hotel!! Overall impression: Will def. come back again. We used the special offer on trip advisor which gave 25% discount so the price were 115 or something per night.. GREAT value for money.

Had a bedtime drink in hotel bar a beer and a glass of wine 21 dollars, but went to a lovely little pub crooked knife just across the way for a few drinks and lovely food and free wi fi! Loved new York and will return for longer next time. Jane

<Title>“Location & ambiance 2nd to none!”
<Content>Obviously location is excellent for those of you who have been to NYC - for those of you who haven't been, just trust me! This place was spectacularly clean & modern - maybe the cleanest place I've ever stayed in in Manhattan.

<Title>“Great deal and super stylin'”
<Content>Had a great stay at Hotel Lola in NYC last week. Got an amazing deal (right off of their website), but wasn't sure what to expect. The hotel was very hip, and my room was gorgeous - I was thrilled! A couple of notes - the main entrance is on 30th, and there's no coffee maker in the room (but that's a good excuse to get out and enjoy some nyc coffee). LOVE the tv (and listing guide, so handy) and the iPod alarm clock - such a nice bonus! The bed was really comfortable! Super close to everything! A quick walk to Times Square, and shopping all around. Their team is really great, helping me organize a car to the airport in no time! Thanks for a great stay, I'd definitely return!

<Title>“NYC Boutique Hotel - LOLA”
<Content>If you stay at Hotel lola and dont like it frankly theres somthing wrong with you!! THE HOTEL Before we left I was reading reviews from people complaining about th smallest details I did wonder if I would notice such things that they mention such as ->"The lobby is too dark" -Its a boutique hotel what do you expect? ->"The shower leaks" - if thats the only thing you can complain about dont bother complaining - thres a shower mat - use it! -> "The rooms are small"- I mean come on, really!? The Hotel is located in midtown manhattan - and for the record theyre bigger than some NYC Appartments! We stayed for 6 nights for my husbands 30th birthday.There was a lovley little note on arrival and some cute little cakes. The room was completley adequate, beautifully decorated. The bed is soooo comfy the TV must have been 50" with all satalite channels. The shower was fine, the drainage was fine, everything was good. The Hotel has a gym in the basement and a business centre which is great for printing airline boarding passes etc NEARBY HOTEL LOLA The official hotel entrance is 29/e29th but you can also access the hotel via the old "Hotel 30 30" entrance on 30/e30th street. The Hotel is situated perfectly for the subway, you can walk to times square in 20 mins casually via lexington or park av. There is a lovley little irish pub/restaurant opposite the hotel on 30th street called th crooked knife - great atmosphere, full of local new yorkers on a fri and sat, great food and great prices. There is also a great family run patisserie if you walk to the left from exiting on 29th street that you can buy hot food if your too tired to eat out. They have salads, pizza, chinese menu's - you name it theyve got it (this was a godsend as after a hard days shopping you sometimes dont feel like getting dressed up!) You have macdonalds across the road on Park Avenue and a great diner called Moonstruck on east 31st/Lexington - Proper american food - pancakes/maple syrup etc GETTING AROUND Cabs - Crazy drivers! From the hotel it will cost around $6-$8 to get to times square - not very expensive t all - but dont forget to tip them properly otherwise theyre likely to run you over! - No joke! For 3 days you can buy the bus hopper tour (from madame taussards in times square) i would highly recomment it - it basically 3 days free travel around the city, we jumped on and off where we needed to go with shopping bags/food etc and as a bonus heard all about the city from the tour guides. They run uptown, downtown and midtown every day. In with the price you also get a selection of tours for free, we did the statue of liberty and the Empire state and also got a 90min cruise around manhatten island - Amazing value for money! Subway - is quite confusing but then again I get confused on the London underground which my husband tells me is dead easy! SHOPPING Everywhere you turn theres a shop of some kind. Main shopping areas are 5th Avenue and Lexington but we found pier 17 wich is lower manhattan at the south sea port. Youll get som great bargains down there on A&F, uggs , Victorias secret etc - would highly recommend. And the bus hopper stops right outside! ALL IN ALL The Hotel is fantastic, bar prices a little steep, but hey your on holiday right? The Location is perfect and if your a fan of the kardashians, the hotel across the street, the Gansvelt - Kim Kardashian lives there! We saw her in the now in the highest heels you can imagine!

<Title>“Christmas get-a-way”
<Content>We took a 4 day 3 night trip to New York for the holidays. Hola Lola provided a great location, great service, and clean rooms. Everyone talks on here about how small the rooms are, but they are not as small as you would think after reading reviews. The rooms and hotel are newly renovated with a very modern look. Bed was very very comfortable, 42" LCD TV, new walk-in shower, The service was friendly and very helpful with directions and things to do within the city. I am not sure when we will visit NYC again, but when we decide to we will book our room here again without a doubt. Give the place a try..you will like it and you won't break the bank staying here either.

<Title>“Good location”
<Content>This used to be called the Thirty Thirty Hotel and indeed was when we booked. We were not advised that the name had changed so it was a bit of a surprise. Hotel has been refurbished and is very much in the style of other Barcelo hotels that I have stayed in - quite dark inside. This is fine for the reception but I personally would have preferred more light in the bedroom. On entering the lobby (either from 29th or 30th) you can see that it is quite stylish. You are not bombarded with bell boys like other hotels I have stayed in - something I find refreshing as I like to be in charge of my own cases. If you do need assistance it is at hand. Check is went very smoothly - the receptionist was very pleasant indeed. My daughter (who lives in NY) met us at the hotel and I told the receptionist it was her birthday. Quick as a flash they got her a little box of chocolates which I thought was a lovely touch. The room itself was quite small but as we were only sleeping there we decided against upgrading. Bathroom very compact with only a shower - albeit a very large one and mirrors are the non steamy kind which is very useful. Our room faced other buildings and was quite adequate. Air con/heating very efficient and nice comfortable beds. We did not eat there or use the bar area as we spent all our time out and about. The hotel is within a minute walk to both uptown and downtown 6 line - fantastic! Also dotted about the hotel are some really good cafe/delis. No charge for leaving bags after check out. Would definitely return here again. Oh one final thing - I had terrible trouble with my GHD hair straighteners - they just wouldn't work! I would advise anyone who needs these (as I do) to invest in a currency converter which should make them work - we couldn't get one at all whilst at the airport or in NY.

<Title>“Lola helped us out when we were stuck!”
<Content>I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this hotel!! We were booked into another hotel in the area and when we showed up the night we had booked they told us we didn't have a reservation and we couldn't stay..even though they had free rooms. We wandered around and came across Hotel Lola! We thought it was going to be way out of our budget but we just needed a place to stay for a couple of hours so we went inside anyways. Shelley was working reception and she was an absolute delight!! She had one room left and was happy to give it to us for the night - the rates were even in our budget!! She processed us through super fast knowing we just needed a few hours sleep before we had to get up at 5am to move on to our next spot. The room was fantastic, beds were comfy, our wake up call came on time and we couldn't have been happier. I highly recommend checking them out!

<Title>“Great Hotel and Location”
<Content>We spent 2 nights here and were impressed with the reasonable rates. The room was plenty big (superior queen) and the bed was super comfortable. Best of all it was CLEAN! Restaurants across from hotel entrances on 29th and 30th street were very good. Yes, lobby does need better lighting (especially if you're over 30 years old). Coffee in the room would also be a welcome addition. We would definitely stay again.

<Title>“Exellent trip”
<Content>This was my first trip to New York in january 2011. This hotel was thencalled HOTEL THIRTY THIRTY! I went with a group of 10 collegues. I loved the location of this hotel, it was very close to maddison square gardens, about a 5-10 min walk from grand central and a 15 min walk to times square. The hotel had not been renovated like it is now, but I still thought it was lovely then. Our room was quite small compared to some of the other ladies we were on the trip with. We did have to move rooms due to the toilet flooding in the bathroom, which wasnt really the highlight of the trip, still the staff were friendly and helpfull. They were also evry happy to keep our luggage stored until we needed to leave. I would definatly recommed this hotel!!

<Title>“Great stay at LOLA, Jan 2012”
<Content>This hotel was a brilliant base for our trip to NY - it is a prime location to get to the Empire State Building and Times Square - amongst others, Great pubs and restuaruants around - check out the Crooked Knifepub directly opposite. Hotel room was very small - but for the amount of time we spent there is wasnt a issue - it was spotlessly clean, newley decorated and when it came tochecking out they were very helpful in arranging bag storage ad taxi booking for the airport. Nice bar downstairs(if you have a torch lol) where we had the odd nightcap. I think they call it atmosphere.... - but it wasnt cheap for drinks. We didnt try the restaurant. Biggest downside of the room was the lack of coffee making facililties - and the name change from Hotel 30 30 to LOLA..... whats that all about ?! I would definately go back to this hotel - for the price we got a great location, a super comfy bed and a clean and warm base which allowed us to have the best trip ever. thanks x

<Content>Room on 10th floor constantly smelt of smoke. On the first morning of my stay I had no hot water in my room till 8:30am. When I called reception to report the issue they could not have cared less! I was late or my first business meeting. No tea or coffee facilities in the room. On the whole,great location, good price but very low quality.

<Title>“Pretty swish hotel in good location”
<Content>Hotel LOLA? It was called the Thirty-Thirty when I stayed here back in October. Stayed six nights. Pretty swanky place really, although the reception area is a bit soulless. Got a decent-sized double room (decent-sized by NYC standards I believe), with an impressive view of the Empire State Building. Only complaint I could make was that water leaked under the shower door on to the bathroom floor every time. Just a bit of a nuisance more than anything. Everything else was fine. For the price you pay here it would want to be. Didn't try the bar or restaurant while I was there so can't comment on that. The $14 a day they charge to use the wi-fi service is a travesty however. There's a Starbucks around the corner that's free, so don't dream of paying it, no matter how desperate you are to check Facebook. I also experienced a bit of hassle trying to organise an extra night's stay there. It seemed to be virtually impossible to contact the reservations department from the reception desk. I eventually managed to sort it out, but would have been quicker just booking online. Big selling point for this hotel has to be its location. Right in the heart of midtown, within walking distance from many major sites, like Times Square, the Empire State, etc, and only a few quick subway stops from downtown. So you get what you pay for really.

<Title>“Thirty Thirty or Hotel Lola???”
<Content>Had a name change since I had booked it & not all signage has been changed (emergency signage still said Thirty Thirty) cab drivers had trouble as well (then again they didn't have a good command of the English language anyway) We had 2 rooms booked and paid the extra $20 when we booked to be upgraded and both got a junior suite which had plenty of room, seperate bedroom (1 room had a sliding door from the lounge room to the bedroom) our room was more open but a definate seperate lounge area.Arriving at 11am we were told our rooms were not ready which we knew that checkin was 4 pm so that was ok, they then said that 1 room could be ready in 20 minutes as it was being cleaned when we checked in. We went up to the room 20 minutes later to leave our bags, the room hadnt been cleaned but the cleaners phone was plugged in charging the TV was on, all the cleaning things were in the room except the cleaner, we waited 15 minutes and no one turned up so we left & just told the front desk. Both had 2x 42" flat screen TVs in the rooms, 1 in the bedroom & 1 in the lounge area. Large bathrooms although the finishes are not good. Our shower door refused to close & stayed open about 2 inches so the water would splash out, our daughters room didn't have a door on it and the floor got very wet, their bathroom also had a terrible smell of sewerage. Raw holes around the sprinkler system in the ceiling looked terrible too. Housekeeping I think just do a quick pullup of the beds & change the towels as our bins had not been emptied and the carpet in parts was not vacuumed. Desk staff were pleasent and informative. Wifi is a ripoff at $14 a night, most of the other hotel have complimentary wifi. We had a breakfast package which was average. No mini fridge either which was not good as our daughter had her 1 year old daughter with her so we needed to keep milk & food cold, not fill the sink with ice, by the way, ice machine on the 10th floor runs out very quickly only other place for ice is the bar. Don't buy a drink at the bar, way overpriced....Bourbon & coke=$16.33 only 4 blocks to subway and only a 15-20 minute walk to Times Square.

<Content>The interior design of the hotel is outstanding, but if staying for a few days it can get a bit clostraphobic. The hotel says it's non-smoking, yet it reeked of cigarette smoke on the 7th floor in the corridor. The rooms didn't smell though. Location - we found it very good, close to empire state building, and we walked to Madison Square, Rockefeller etc

<Title>“Pleasantly surprised”
<Content>Stayed for one night on January 9, 2012. Booked a room with 2 twin beds. Room was very small as expected but perfectly functional. In fact, the bathroom was quite spacious! Very quiet that night on the 5th floor even through the room was next to the elevator. A few minor flaws: a little too much light comes through the room darkening shades. The bathroom shower partition doesn't extend far enough, and no matter how careful you are, water gets on the floor. This could be a problem as there is no clothing hook in the bathroom. Also, it would have been nice if the hotel phone number was on the phone. The beds were very comfortable and the room was spotless. The staff was friendly and helpful. Just a word of caution: the lobby/lounge, although quite lovely, has a very strong perfume/incense scent. Being quite sensitive to scents of all kinds, I had to dart through the lobby to the elevator. It would have been nice to be able to sit awhile and enjoy the updated decor. For the great price I got, I'll be back again!

<Title>“Thirty Thirty now Lola still a good value”
<Content>Thirty Thirty has unexpectedly changed its name - including on the outside entrance. Inside it is still clean, comfortable, and at this winter time an excellent value. The rooms are clean and functional, though they have no extra amenities such as robes or coffee makers. If you choose a bigger (slightly costlier) room, it is much pleasanter than the tiny cell-like rooms, but (like any New York hotel without double-paned windows) you may need earplugs or white noise (i.e. the fan) to sleep. There is a for-pay "business center" (computers and printer) with airport info, a lobby bar, and a decent restaurant/cafe with extended hours that you can access from the lobby.

<Title>“Bed bugs”
<Content>The hotel was changed to hotel Lola, they said they tried contacting all their guests to make them aware of this change. I was not contacted. To have a drink in the lounge is very expensive. They never had any information about local information in rooms. Was just out of date letter suggestion for the new year celibrations. I asked at the concerge for information but she was too intrested in selling tickets for attractions. Do not supply free Wifi it's $14 per day. We had bed bugs in our room they were coming out of the air vents. In our bed and floors and also bathroom. The room window never closed correctly and was a draft. We never had a kettle to make tea or coffee. The hotel looks really nice inside and also the rooms but because of the problems have effected the over all experience.

<Title>“Great stay”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel with my boyfriend for 5 nights and it was great. The location was great, room was a bit small but nothing to worry about. Staff were all friendly and very helpful. Only thing that annoyed us was when we were checking in and they asked for a credit card and form of ID she swiped the card and as she gave us the room key she then decided to mention that they had taken a $125 deposit incase there was any damage to the room, we had no option to pay by cash (which we would have preferred) as it can take up to 5 working days for the money to be refunded onto the card once checked out which is no use as we took that money to spend while in New York. Apart from that everything was great, we found this delicious pasta pizza place just on the corner of the street which the hotel was on. I would certainly stay here again and recommend to others.

<Title>“pleasantly surprised”
<Content>We got a great price for this hotel, @ 99/night and having read other reviews on how tiny the rooms are, we opted to upgrade to a Superior Queen suite for an extra 10/night. We also made a mention that we were light sleepers and asked for a quiet room. It was definitely worth it. The room wasn't huge, but spacious enough not to feel claustrophobic. The bathroom was amazing. The decor was modern and fairly clean. Our room was on the top floor which made it very quiet, but you do hear as people walk by. The view wasn't worth mentioning because we looked out directly into another building. The location of the hotel was by far the best feature. It is right off Madison and Fifth, but on a smaller street so its quiet. For cheap eats, you also have Korea town 2 blocks away which is open all night long. Parking is also located about a block away for a hefty 50/ every 24 hours, but you get a slight discount from the hotel. Overall, I liked this hotel quite a bit, but whether I come back again or not will depend on the rate we find.

<Content>This hotel is located on a quiet New York Street between 30th and 29th off Madison avenue. The hotel is warm and welcoming and my husband stated that on check in the young lady could not have been more welcoming and helpful. We had a lovely large room with more than enough space to accommodate our needs. Actually our shower was so large we could have slept there and still had room for our luggage. The big treat was the bed. The mattress was the most comfortable hotel bed that I have ever slept in ever. Nice job. Great hotel definitely worth a visit. Thank you to all for a superb short visit. Super job housekeeping.

<Title>“Check-Out Nightmare”
<Content>Got a great price (for Manhattan) at this hotel ( about $170night) in November . Not greatest location but if you like walking it's good. Nice room, new reno ,modern, paid extra $30 per night for bigger room, extra space nice for luggage. Terrible view, most rooms we saw look into courtyard surrounded by buildings. Staff friendly. Upon check-out we spent 1 hr arguing at front desk because they over charged us , luckily we brought all our email correspondence otherwise they were not listening, they were making stuff up, made us feel like thieves! When we finally left we were to told a manager would call us, no one called. I wrote them, no one called. I called them, they didn't know anything about it but assured me someone would call us, no one called. I would not go back

<Title>“Better than expected and fantastic location!”
<Content>As with many reviewers, I also had mixed feelings after reading some other people's reviews. But overall, I thought that mostly people complained about very minor things and don't focus on the important things. My two requirements are that the location is good and the hotel is clean - of which this hotel met my needs. The location was really fantastic - very central and lively - many restaurants around and close to shopping district. As for cleanliness, well the first set of towels we had in our room had a funky smell, but we requested new ones and they were very prompt in giving us replacements. The staff is very nice and helpful. Most notably the concierge was quite helpful. As for style, the hotel itself is modern and chic and the rooms are the same. Also for those who are very picky, there were a few minor faults: the window did not lock...which to me is a small security issue as we were on the 12th floor which is the only floor whose window has a ledge. Also, the shower doors don't keep water in. So we had to keep towels on the floor to soak up the excess water. They also had an iHome in the room but it didn't have working batteries. You know, if there is going to be an amenity, it should at least be ready for use. All minor things which did not interrupt our stay at all! Admittedly the room was smaller than we expected. The bathroom was VERY small. The sink, toilet, and shower were squeezed into one tiny space. In the end, the room was manageable, and as I said, it was clean and the location was excellent. In comparison to price, we paid $228 per night (not including internet at $14 a night) which included a discount with AAA card and their holiday rates. Compared to other hotels we were looking at which received far worse reviews than this one yet had the same nightly rate, we were satisfied with what we got. I would stay here again.

<Title>“Hotel Lola - great value, great hotel”
<Content>Couldn't believe this was our hotel when we arrived, mainly because it's rebranded as Hotel Lola and the outside only says 'Lola' so frankly could have been anything (!). But also our room rate was almost a budget rate (having shopped around to find something cheap but not hideous) so we had low expectations and were pretty impressed by what we found. Check-in went smoothly, considering we were still convinced we had the wrong place. I had requested a quiet room having read some Thirty Thirty reviews. We were on 6th floor but facing away from the street so didn't suffer from traffic noise. Our only gripe was that there was no plug in the bathroom sink. Apparently this is a problem when shaving (ask boyfriend, not me). Reported this to reception but was not resolved during our stay. Otherwise room was tiny but very nicely furnished (we had a standard queen). Bathroom spacious and actually pretty chic. Has obviously been refurbed recently. Oh, also liked the BIG telly. Have stayed in Hotel DuV and MalMaison and Lola is nowhere near that standard but it's way above average in terms of trendy decor and fittings, and overall quality of the rooms. We really enjoyed our stay. I expect the room rates will go up now that they've had a face lift, but if they carry on doing great-value special offers then we'll definately be back.

<Title>“Redemption...”
<Content>In September, my fiance and I travelled to New York to get married, having read "VERY" mixed reviews about the Hotel Thirty Thirty, we were rather apprehensive as our arrival drew nearer. Upon entering the hotel, we were greeted with a 30 foot corridor of plastic sheets (think of the scene from ET, seriously). The entire lobby was a construction site, the hotel was clearly being rennovated, we were not informed of this prior to our arrival, however, I appreciate that things like this are necessary, it also shows the hotel is doing well financially if it can afford an upgrade of this scale. My wife and I were fortunate enough to be there during the completion and the lobby was stunning, oozing cool and very modern. The room we were given was of a very high standard, if a bit small, on the Wednesday (2 days after our arrival, we were staying for 7 nights) we returned from our wedding ceremony to a soaking wet carpet patch as the Air Conditioning was dripping, we were offered another room (exact same standard), I politely hinted that two hours ago my wife and I had just got married and that this was a bit of an inconvenience and could potentially spoil the moment. The hotel manager escorted us to another room, two doors away, which was three times the size, apologised for the trouble, and gave us a small wedding cake as a gift. My wife and I were more than satisfied with how we were treated and felt that the hotel had completely redeemed themselves. The rest of our stay was fantastic, the extra room made a massive difference to our comfort, I would definitely return to the Hotel Thirty Thirty, I'm not a materialistic person in any way and can appreciate that things go wrong, it's how the problem is managed and rectified that means the most to me, in this case, it was handled very well. I believe that other people would let this ruin their trip, for example, the condition of the lobby on arrival, the wet carpet, and the inconvenience of moving room. However, the condition of the hotel, from value for money, cleanliness, location, rooms, and as a whole, is 4 star.

<Title>“Great hotel, don't listen to the haters!”
<Content>We stayed here on 26th December for 4 nights. Our travel provider originally offered us a hotel close to Time Square. Unfortunately they let us down at the last minute and offered us the Lola instead. After reading some of these reviews I didn't hold out much hope... However, we were pleasantly suprised! Upon arrival we were offered a free upgrade to a superior room on the 11th floor with a view of the Empire State Building. The room was a generous size, clean, with plently of storage and a super comfy bed! Staff were also very helpful. The loby has a chic feel and a bar with a lovely Italian barman serving cocktails The hotel is perfectly located, only a few blocks away from the Empire State, Macy's and the Flatiron Building.The Subway is also really close. Starbucks is on the corner, great staff and free WiFi. For a quick bite to eat try Bread and Butter which is just across the street. The food is amazing! Don't listen to the haters! We enjoyed our time staying at The Lola and were actually glad we didn't stay in Time Square (it's crazy busy). The little things people are complaining about are so insignificant it makes me chuckle :)

<Title>“Great stay in December!”
<Content>My mother (46yrs), her best friend (49 yrs) and I (26 yrs) stayed at Hotel 3030 or the now Hotel LOLA for five nights from Dec 8-13. I booked the executive jr suite with a king size bed, but the staff accommodated us and switched us to a two double bed the following morning since my mom's friend was driving me nuts complaining about the pull out bed and roll away bed. It made a huge difference to us, albeit a double bed was a bit tight for me to share with my mother. The trip was for some vacation and to visit NYU and Columbia for graduate school. Rooms were large and clean but remember we had the suites which were pricey, but worth it since I wanted my mom to have a great NYC experience. Beds were very comfortable. Staff was very accommodating. They switched us rooms, second room didn't have a coffee maker and they brought one up upon request, and they stored a fancy cheese my mom bought in their refrigerator for 4 nights. Bellboys had thick accents, difficult to understand but helpful enough. Not amazing, but good. Did not have breakfast at hotel so I can't vouch for the food. Hotel has two entrances, one on 29th and one on 30th. Near 6 train, and a 10-15 min walk to other lines. Next to Madison ave and Park ave. If you are sensitive to noise ask for a room on the back of hotel on 29th. 30th st is more noisy. We were on floor 2 and we had minor noise, but I'm not sensitive to noise. It's NYC, noise is to be expected. It's not like you're going on a country cottage getaway! Overall I could not have been happier with the hotel. Just wish I could have moved it closer to the 1 train. :)

<Title>“Bed Bugs - Dont be fooled by grand opening specials”
<Content>This hotel claims to be a 4 star but this should really be 2. Both wife and I woke up with bites on our legs and I had one smack dab between my eyes. We bought our own sheets from Macy's from that point on as it was too late to get another hotel. They will try to scam you on internet use, so we ended up going to the starbucks for the free wifi. Concierge had no clue about the city and were not very helpful in giving tips other than what we could read off a nyc brochure. Pictures look great and definitely the lobby is trendy and chic. However, it is not really renovated as the towels still smell like smoke. Would not stay here again, as there are plenty of hotels in the area to choose from. Try another one....

<Title>“So near and yet so far”
<Content>Please note that this hotel has just changed name and is now the Hotel Lola. The construction and name change were under way when we were there. This is a small hotel with a convenient location with good food available at a market up the street and with helpful check in staff. The concierge were cold and obviously more interested in selling their packages and tours than in legitimately answering our questions or giving us personal recommendations. The room was very small but adequate. The new lobby is very dark and claustrophobic. The most aggravating thing about our stay was that I couldn't get a real drinking glass to save my life. All the drinking glasses in the room were the squashy plastic in a bag kind. I had a beautiful bottle of wine in the room and I wasn't about to drink it from a squishy plastic glass. There is a bar in the lobby with loads of glasses out on display and I asked the bartender if I might borrow a couple and he flatly refused saying that there were only 30 in the entire hotel and that there was no way to accommodate me. I offered to pay for them if i didn't return them and still no go. I spoke to the lady manager the next morning and was assured that my "special request" was going to be difficult to grant since they have no room service facility and this was going outside of their process, however, she would make the arrangements for me. The bartender was not advised and again my wish for a decent glass was refused. The night manager that evening was in a very long (over 30 minutes as I never saw the end of it) and obviously unpleasant transaction with someone at the front desk and I was unable to get him to help that night either. Overall the poor service tainted what could have been a comfortable and pleasant stay.

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>My mother and I stayed at the Hotel Lola for 3 nights (Dec 13-16th). While the location is good, it is an extremely noisy part of town. The room was clean but small and beside an elevator. Make certain you ask not to be beside the elevator. Some staff have a little to be desired. The Hotel has 2 entrances (29th and 30th) and one evening I was "ordered" by a bouncer at the door to walk around the block and enter the 30th St entrance because there was a private function going on in the lobby. It didn't matter that we were guests. To top off our stay, the concierge arranged a taxi to the airport for us. Upon arrival at the airport we were surrounded by police and told that we were in an illegal taxi and that the concierge and the driver had an arrangment.

<Title>“Great experience and value”
<Content>My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights. I found out about Hotel Thirty Thirty, now Lola, through trip advisor but had been visited by one of our friends recently. Although a little hard to find, the hotel itself is in a great location. Only a couple blocks from the subway and a few stations from grand central. The lobby and bar was as chic as it can get. Luckily we were there on the weekdays, but on one of the nights there was an event which they sectioned off the majority of the lobby. We stayed in a superior queen which was small but still comfortable for two. Room and bathroom was clean and simple. Not a lot going on as with all modern decor. As for service, we didn't get much of a chance to use the hotels services as we were out almost the whole day and would return late at night. We also didn't do housekeeping since we had a lot of belongings all over the place. It was nice being able to leave our bags at the hotel when we arrived before check-in and as we checked-out and had a lot of time until our flight. The only reason I gave this review 4 stars was the smell of cigarettes that was present on the 5th floor as we stepped out of the elevator. We couldn't smell it from our room but it was just a little irritating coming back after a long day greeted with this. They stated that this is a non-smoking hotel but since Lola is also a service apartment, I don't think the tenants care. Overall, we had a great stay here but I'm not sure if I'll be returning. This was my first time in New York so I'm eager to experience a new place next time.

<Content>I just stayed here for two nights mid-week. They've just completed their lobby renovation and it's pretty swanky. The room was nice as always. I'm there for work but the location is convenient to just about anything. The lower floor can get a bit noisy as it was for me, but otherwise a great hotel.

<Title>“Some initial bumps, but ended on a HIGH NOTE: GREAT Customer Service & Staff; Beautiful Room!!!”
<Content>I checked in for a single room at the Hotel Thirty Thirty. Luckily based on reading other's reviews, I knew that the hotel had changed its name to the Lola Hotel. FYI, you can also access the hotel off of 29th street as well. The hotel is a beautiful modern boutique hotel conveniently located near the Empire State Building. It's in easy walking distance to shopping (Macy's, Lord & Taylor), Times Square, Grand Central Station, Bryant Park, and Union Square (all about 10-15 minutes walking). The staff here are nice and friendly, from the front desk to the very helpful bellmen. Check-in went smoothly, but some issues came up after arriving into my room on the 5th floor. The room itself was modern and beautiful with a large flat screen tv, great linen, and down comforter. The hotel is itself is completely nonsmoking. However, I later found out that through no fault of the hotel's, there were some permanent residents there that may be smokers and thus the smell of smoke permeating my room on the 5th floor. I was only there for one night and was going to put up with it, but the customer service staff said that they would have housekeeping spray the room and put in an air purifier machine to help, or that if I could wait for another room to be cleaned I could switch rooms. I told them if they could do the first option, I would stay in the room that I had. I thought both options were great - I've had other hotels tell me that there's nothing they can do... Unfortunately, there were some cleanliness issues in the bathroom, which I later discovered. So I called up the front desk again wondering if it would be possible to switch rooms. They said they were happy to do so with the caveat of a wait which I was totally fine with. When I go downstairs to leave my luggage and check back in with the front desk, to my vast surprise, I was upgraded to a much larger room on the 12th floor. The manager/front desk rep(?) was so kind and even gave me a little sweet treat to boot for the inconvenience. I totally was not expecting this at all. The upgraded room was very spacious, modern and beautiful. Most importantly not a hint of smoke and very clean. While the initial start-up was a bit rocky, the hotel and staff more than made up for this with its customer service and friendliness. It is a rare treat for the hotel to go above and beyond in remedying some initial issues without any prompting. I cannot say enough about their thoughtfulness and consideration! I would highly recommend staying there!

<Title>“Amazing transformation...”
<Content>Hotel thirty thirty was in the process of transforming itself to hotel Lola during our stay. We witnessed the signs get changed, the press function held in the very stylish new lobby. The rooms were very nice. We were given a bigger room when we checked in for free and it was a comfortable size. The renovations look great. The room was clean, always serviced nicely and the hotel staff were very attentive and helpful. NYC is a hard place to find good hotel rooms, however this was a pleasant stay. The location is very central yet it's extremely quiet duringbe night and feels very safe any time of day or night. Highly recommended! I'd stay here again no questions asked.

<Title>“Really enjoyable stay”
<Content>Absolutely loved this hotel. Two of us stayed for 5 nights. We opted for an upgrade on the website if a superior room was available, and got this for only $10 extra a night between the two of us. Beatiful hotel, the lobby is stunning. Hotel has now changed name to Hotel Lola. Room was spacious, clean and nicely designed. Really good shower and really comfortable bed. Our remote to the television didnt work, we told reception and it was fixed immediately. Location was perfect, we walked everwhere. So close to 5th Avenue, Broadway, Times Square, Empire State Building etc. We used the concierge, Jennifer, a couple of times and she was exceptionally helpful and friendly. One of the reception staff was rude, but everything else was just perfect. Wouldn't have changed a thing and would recommend to anyone.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>I booked this hotel on the internet and didn't know what to expect. What a lovely surprise. The lobby and bar area are beautiful and the room was really nice although very small - apparently to be expected in New York. The staff were absoloutely brilliant in all aspects and couldn't have been more helpful. The beds were the most comfortable I've ever come across and the only thing I would have liked was coffee making facilities in the room. This was a surprise visit for my sons 21st birthday and we both loved the hotel. I would certainly recommend it and would return to stay again.

<Title>“Great hotel excellent location - change of name was confusing for the Taxi Driver!”
<Content>Unfortunately our first impression of the hotel was not too clever. I had left the address in the boot of the cab and told the driver we were going to 30 30 expecting him to know where it was! He didn't so after assuring my wife I was not a complete idiot (a tense moment or two in the rear of the cab) I texted my son (no internet as roaming costs too expensive in the US) in the UK to get the address. He googled and texted the address 29 East 29th street. That got us close enough for the driver to type in Thirty to the Sat Nav (cheating for a cab driver surely?) to take us to the front door. He then paced up and down the street looking for the Hotel which for some reason had changes it's name to Lola 3 weeks earlier. Question / Idea for management - e-mail to tell customers BEFORE they arrive! Anyway having finally found the place - we loved the hotel. Staff from check in to concierge and domestic staff were very keen to help. Very central - 20 minute walk from Time Square, 5 minutes from Empire State Building and just befor Christmas only a 10 minute walk to Maceys (might have been better for the wallet if it had been 30 minutes!) We were allocated a minor suite and having asked for a "corner room" we were allocated room 838 - good size (I was expecting smaller) but discovered it was for disabled customers. We had 3 "complaints" about the room: 1) Nowhere to hang longer coats (a requiement in December!) 2) Nowhere for toiletries - everything was squeezed into the back of the sink and kept falling off (NB management there is space for a small shelf to the left of the sink which could do the job 3) The shower curtain (clearly there for the potential customer requirements) meant that however we showered water leaked onto the floor. Cleaning staff supplied extra towels so we were not bothered but it was a niggle and should be looked at for a more permanent solution Howeve having said all that - whilst these comments stopped us from giving 5 stars - everything else (recently refurbished) from the fabulous bed, quiet air con, big flat screen TV was top quality. Finally a word of warning for anyone looking to eat near the hotel. We ended up at the back of the Hotel (E 29th Street) where we found a nice looking Italian - cant remember the name - but avoid it like the plague! Food was OK (carbonara too salty) and the waitor looked down his nose when my wife asked what Chicken Parmigano (?) was - however the unforgivable things were: Waiters trying to up-sell "specials" which cost significantly more than many other dishes When we asked for prices of these they conveniently did not know! 4 drinks (2 white wine and 2 Bud) cost the same as the food we ordered!

<Title>“Good location only”
<Content>Now that its name has changed to Hotel Lola, my best wishes go with it..This hotel is for business travellers who has 1 luggage, definitely not for shopcoholics, there is no ramp at front & back of hotel, 1 has to carry luggage, shopping bags over flight of steps and into Lobby. Our room was small & clean, does not have much storage space for the 2 luggage bags plus hand-carry luggage. No thermostat in room to control room temp. it was extremely hot & uncomfortable during the Winter night (I dare say under such situation, Guest will check out in no time during Summer period) Front desk staff & concierge were helpful. Other than its strategic location, walking distance to Time Sq, Broadway, 5th Av and 28th St subway station on Line 4,5 and 6, this hotel has not much to offer.

<Title>“Pleasant & quiet stay in a bustling city”
<Content>In november I stayed here for 4 nights while being in New York for business. There was a lot of work going on in the hotel lobby but it didn't impact our stay. The lobby is quite dark & modern: depends on your taste whether you really like or hate it. We got nice rooms on the 10th floor, in a quiet spot of the hallway. I specifically asked for that, because when you're close to the elevator, you might hear the elevator and the ice machines all the time. The cleaning staff was extremely friendly, as was the front desk. The check out procedure took a long time due to the system, but fortunately we were able to check out the night before an early departure. The location is great, close to metro stations and the Empire State Building. Regarding NY prices, you get good value: nice room, very clean and a great, comfortable bed. We didn't use any breakfast or dinner facilities: plenty of good places in the surrounding.

<Title>“It is now Hotel Lola”
<Content>We just returned from 4 days in New York City staying at the Hotel Lola, formerly Hotel Thirty Thirty, in mid town Manhattan. This was our first stay, but it will not be our last. The staff was exceptionally helpful, from the front desk to the concierge to Salvatore, the delightful Sicilian bartender. Our room had the most comfortable bed either of us have ever slept in, and had been very nicely renovated. The color scheme is dark and sophisticated in the lobby, but our room was airy and bright with a lovely bathroom and great shower. The hotel does not have a restaurant, but we were given recommendations to several nearby reasonably priced and very good restaurants. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is we would have liked a coffeemaker in the room. Because there is no restaurant, there is no room service, so the only way to get coffee was to get up and dressed and go to the Starbucks on the corner. Not the worst thing in the world, but we really hated to get out of that amazingly comfortable bed!

<Title>“Hotel Lola”
<Content>We checked in on the night the hotel changed to Hotel Lola. Seems that the hotel has had a bit of a facelift, however, the new decor is very dark. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The room was small, but very clean (no bugs or creepy crawlies) and as this was just a place to drop after days of sightseeing, not a problem. The bed was probably the most comfy hotel bed I 've ever slept on. The location of the hotel is ideal, fairly central in Manhatten and a stones throw from the Empire State Building. The restaurant downstairs does a great Eggs Benedict! On the negative side, even though we were on the 11th floor the street noise was incredible (could do with double glazing)....oh, and no kettle!

<Title>“Hotel Thirty Thirty now Hotel Lolo”
<Content>The experience with this midtown (30th and Madison) New York hotel was off from the beginning, when we arrived to find the name had changed, without the hotel notifying us before arrival. The lobby is dark with a pseudo-chic, nightlife vibe that is particularly off-putting if you're not a night life kind of person, not to mention the incongruity of the dark lighting and pulsing techno-pop music at 7 am. The concierge didn't seem to know the first thing about the neighborhood and it was impossible to get online to get information because their wi-fi service didnt support my Macbook, according to the service. (My buddy in a different room had the same experience.) Multiple attempts over several days failed to correct the problem, so I was off-line the whole time. Neither my friends nor I could use the internet on our iPhones either because their wi-fi service blocked it - at least on our iPhones. Again, there was no help in correcting this from the staff. The housekeeping service was clearly lacking, as we found upon check-in with a dirty bathroom floor - I'll spare the details. On the up side, we were upgraded to a larger room upon check-in, which was great. But, I won't go back again despite the fantastic location.

<Content>When we arrived at the hotel (Thirty Thirty now Lola?) we were pleased with the location, the lobby was very nice with a bar...Service was courteous and friendly. They allowed us to check in early and leave our luggage after check-out which was extremely helpful. The only negative thing we have to say is BUGS!! Roaches in the bathroom!!! OMG... Bathroom is not very clean either! Dark carpets O_o Wonder what was hiding! The good news is that we didn't find any bed bugs after a thorough inspection :)Sorry but wouldn't go back for those reasons...Great location though.

Staff are friendly and helpful, esp. the bell man. Most importantly, it is centrally located and less than two blocks from the metro. It is extremely easy to get uptown and downtown. How can you beat their rate ($200+ p/n) for a midtown NYC hotel! I would definitely stay at Hotel Thirty Thirty again. To hotel mgr: Pls clarify your hotel name to either "Hotel Thirty Thirty", or "Lola" and include your super dated elevators in your renovation. It would make the transformation complete.

<Title>“very good hotel”
<Content>This hotel was very good . Stayed there with my brother November 27 2011 for two nights. We had a suite that was a complimentry upgrade from the hotel. Always as good start. Checked in without a problem and enjoyed the location. I ripped all the bedding off to search for bb and found nothing. In fact the matress was very new looking and super comfortable. I would definatly recommend this hotel to my friends and will stay there next time in nyc. I should mention we got a great deal through travelzoo and 2 nights tax in was 300$ which makes it a cheep hotel by nys standards.

<Title>“Recently renovated”
<Content>Stayed for 1 night in Nov 2011. Despite what others are saying, I found the room and lobby to be quite clean (I believe they recently went through some renovations). Room was typical NYC size, bed was comfy, clean and no signs or bed bugs before and after my stay. The hotel charges and extra $15 per day for internet access.

<Title>“Should they charge extra for the cockroaches”
<Content>I have stayed in many hotels over the years, and have never complained- this is the first time, and I intend to make this feedback known every place I can think of on the internet. I travel for 3 weeks all over the US at least three times a year from overseas. I arrived at your hotel as the last leg, found steps that made it really hard to get my heavy two pieced of 3 week luggage up stairs, with no bellman in sight. I waited 15 minutes in the rain, and proceeded to drag them myself. After waiting in line over a half an hour to check in, I asked a concierge if you had laundry facilities in the hotel ( washing machine and dryer) When she told me that you did not ( and that was OK) I asked where the closest Laundromat was. She took 10 minutes to look it up, and told me an address miles away. Imagine my surprise later in the day when I took a walk and found a Laundromat 2 DOORS AWAY FROM THE HOTEL! I did not have adequate wireless access, and I need it to work- I checked this at booking. After about 2 hours on the phone with support I was told to move rooms. So at 11:00 pm after hours on the phone with your internet people and front desk, a very long day of meetings, with an equally long day ahead, I had to pack up my international luggage and move ( a porter had turned up to give me a key, but I was not packed up yet, and there was no room in my room for him to wait around, so I had to drag everything myself- I am a fairly small woman with 3 weeks worth of luggage: personal effects and business materials). When I got to the new room , which was definitely worse than the original, I found that the wireless access was no better there, so I waited another hour for someone to bring me a cable connection. So, at about 12:00 midnight I began to do the work I needed to prepare for the next day's meetings. In the new room, the towels were stored on top of the toilet ( there was not towel rail), and the shower door could not open more than half way without bumping into the toilet- good thing that I am fairly slim, or I would not have managed to get in or out! Finally, and WORST OF ALL on the last day, since my flight was out of JFK at midnight, and it was pouring rain, I decided to stay/pay for another half day, to get some rest and pack in the afternoon before my final meeting and an 11 hour international flight. I found a cockroach in my room, waited half an hour for 4 members of staff to crowd into the room moving the furniture looking for the bug, which they did not find. I then emptied all my suitcases looking to see if the cockroach had got in there. I did not find it. An hour later as I was getting my suitcases repacked, I found a cockroach ( the same one? a friend?) killed it with my boot, and called maintenance to come take the carcass away- that took another half hour. By then, needless to say, I got no rest, and found it preferable to go out in the rain to staying in the room with the cockroaches. I was horrified to find that despite all this, I was still charged $100 for that lovely???? afternoon!

<Title>“DonÂ´t book, they will charge even if you cancel the reservation”
<Content>In Aug 2011 I booked a room from Thirtythirty for 6 nights in October. In early September I cancelled the reservation, and immediately also got a confirmation of the cancellation, incl. cancellation number. But what happened in October? I got info from my credit card company, that 3030 will charge my credit card for the amount of 247,82 US dollars. I have sent the hotel three different e-mails, using their general e-mail address as well as the one which they use for reservations. No answer, nothing. IÂ´m starting to lose my hope for the refund.

<Title>“Above average room, below average service.”
<Content>Arrived to find that my room wasn't ready several hours after check-in time. Waited an additional half hour. Service at the front desk was spotty at best. It seemed as if the people at the desk had no idea how things worked. Front entrance was being repaired. No notice was given and the 29th St. entrance made no reference to being the Thirty Thirty Hotel. Very sloppy in my opinion. Room was clean and the maid service was extremely professional and diligent. At end of stay, concierge wouldn't call a cab. Insisted I go out to Madison Avenue to get a cab. Took over 30 minutes to finally flag one down. I think I might try a different option next time.

<Title>“Small but great location!!!”
<Content>My husband and I booked Hotel Thirty Thirty because my father had stayed there and recommended it. It is a verrrry small boutique hotel about 5 blocks from The Empire State Building. We took the train into Penn Station, which also was about 5 blocks away, from MA just for one night. The location is great no matter what you are looking to do. My husband had never been to NYC so we did all the touristy things and it was prime location. We stayed in a room probably the size of a jail cell but the bed was super comfortable and the room very clean. My only issue was that when I was ironing he couldn't walk around the room because the ironing board did take up alot of the room. Few tips: Definitely ask for more towels before you check in. Bar/Restaurant in the hotel closes early but the Crooked Knife across the street had great food and cocktails and are open late!!! All in all I would stay there again. If you've stayed in NYC before you know that for room and space you are going to PAY for it. For the amount we payed I was pleased. Value was great!

<Title>“Manhattan requires money or patience...”
<Content>..sometimes both. Hotel thirty thirty is a work in progress. We got it as a good deal (for a midtown Manhattan hotel) through Priceline. Pros: Hotel was located perfectly for shopping 5th avenue or zipping to Time Square or the village (east or west). Walking was possible, taxi fares were modest (for NY) and subway lines were convenient. Rooms were clean. Bathroom was stylishly appointed and useful. The bathroom was huge (1/2 as big as the room). Front desk people were helpful and friendly. Cons: Rooms were very small, but you find similar at the Waldorf for 3x the price. We could hear the different couples next door even for a low-level modest conversation. The lower sash of the room's dormer window did not mate with the upper sash very well, leaving a gap that fingers could fit through. Fortunately, there was a heavy drape over the window and the weather, though cold, was not frigid. The hotel is a work in progress - it used to be the Hotel Lola. The entrance on 30th street was closed and we had to roll our carryons to 29th street to use the temporary entrance. One of the three elevators would occasionally be out of service, although waits did not become extraordinarily long.

<Title>“I'd return”
<Content>I stayed at the Hotel Thirty Thirty (on 30th St. NYC). It's also got an entrance from 29th and from there is branded "Lola". Nice spacious lobby. Had a room on the 7th floor - modern, new and clean - but the noise from the traffic during the night caused us to ask to move room (first time ever). The staff at reception were are very helpful, and were aware of the fact that Friday and Saturday nights are noisier. The next afternoon was assigned a room on the 11th floor facing a different direction which was very quiet. If returning to Manhattan - I'd definitely consider this hotel again.

<Title>“Poor service”
<Content>I stayed five nights at Hotel Thirty Thirty. The room was clean but incredibly noisy with the sound of the airconditioning (even switched off!). I was over in New York on business. On my second day, the internet wasn't working. On my fourth day, it is the lock on my room which wasn't working. I travel frequently and understand that things can go wrong now and then but my main complaint concerns the very unhelpful attitude of the staff at Hotel Thirty Thirty, verging, in some cases, on plain rude. I don't know if it's down to bad training or that there is such a lot of traffic that they simply don't care, in any case, I will not go back!

<Content>Very good value in great location on 30th st. near 5th & Park Ave. Extremely helpful & accommodating personnel during afternoon check-in & check-out but taciturn personnel in evening: No tea pot or info re: ice, not even a sorry. Service personnel: nice & helpful. Would have appreciated e-mail alert about closed 30 East 30 entrance. Folks with kids: watch out for that heavy mega door on 29th. Fingers could get caught on right side of slow-closing door if exiting. Rooms are small but new & adequate. Courtyard side: very quiet. Noisy AC/heater turning on/off was remedied by adjusting to constant on. Lobby: new & attractive. Fridge was furnished upon request. Will stay there again unless rates are raised after transformation to Hotel Lola. But would really appreciate that tea pot!

<Title>“50/50”
<Content>Stayed at a Renovated Standard King room. It had a good size, specially for a NY Hotel, and an AMAZING bed. The room was really quiet and had a good iof the Empire State Building. The decoration was sober, which I appreciated. The shower was also great, strong, but the bathroom got flooded every time I took a bath, which was annoying. Bad housekeeping, they would only make the bed, put new bath products and fold the towels. The trash wasn't emptied for 3 days. Good location, not too central, walking distance to various attractions and the subway.

<Title>“Name Change Coming - and Still Good”
<Content>I stayed at the hotel for a few days at the beginning of November 2011. I found it humorous that the 30 East 30 entrance is not in use, due to ongoing construction, and you have to use the entrance at 29 East 29th Street. At least the new hotel name won't be Twenty Nine Twenty Nine!! It will be Hotel Lola, or something like that (not sure why). I don't know when new management took over, but the renovations in this rather old hotel building, I think, have been quite successful. The entrance hall to the lobby, and the lobby itself, have a clean, "industrial" look to them, with a dark tone and interesting interior decorating touches. I liked it. The hallway on the floor where my room was also was redone in this style, with an interesting rug. The room, too. I think it took a bit of time to come up with the decorating scheme and the care in executing it should be acknowledged and complimented, considering the modest cost of accommodation. (The hotel isn't in the Times Squire area, but a short taxi ride - or, better yet, - a stroll, can get you there in about 20 minutes, I think.) I particularly liked the manual chain-driven unique shade that lets light into the room while maintaining privacy, and the inner window shade that really did keep the room dark when it was light outside. What I didn't like was the paucity of lights. A wall switch at the entrance door allows you to turn on the ceiling hall light. Too bad there isn't a ceiling light in the room itself. You have table lamp options. Once you turn them on, you have to go back to the door to turn off the hall ceiling light. I'd suggest trying to see if lighting could be added to the room ceiling, with power coming from the source that provides electricity to the TV opposite the bed. A nice-appearing conduit going up the wall to the ceiling center wouldn't be an eyesore, and would benefit guests. Maybe it could be operated by a "remote", as is the TV? Another thing - the "armoire" - an attractive metal industral-type unit, is practical, witha built-in safe, place to hang clothes above and some self-closing drawers below. Though I found it useful, it's location made it hard to access (a niche in the wall). I think it could be turned 90 degrees and might be more accessible that way. Also, the room itself is quite small and there is no place to put valises. A small storage unit for this, maybe two levels, could be placed in the corner of the room where the window wall and TV wall meet. There is room for this, I think. It would be a great advantage to guests who have to take care not to stumble over their open valises. Still, all in all, a good value.

<Title>“Plenty of pros and cons”
<Content>Well, I didn't do a whole lot of thinking before planning an extended weekend in NYC for my husband and myself the exact same weekend as the NYC marathon. Needless to say, hotels were at a premium. After searching high and low for anything under $400 a night, I stumbled across Hotel Thirty Thirty. It was far more affordable than anything else available, and was in a fantastic location, so I quickly booked a package that included free wifi. We arrived to find the entrance closed due to construction, so we had to haul our luggage around the block to the opposite side (usually that wouldn't be a big deal, but pregnancy has made everything more tiring.) On the 29th street side, there is nothing identifying the hotel as Thirty Thirty, only Lola (I'm still a big confused as to which name they're going with, received info with one or the other throughout our stay.) We arrived and checked in and were surprised to find out just how small the rooms were. Overall, it really was fine, especially considering how little time we spent in the room, but it was surprising at first glance. We had just enough room to stash our bags and still have room to move around the bed. I suspect a great number of NYC hotel rooms are even tinier, and based on size, I'd have no qualms about staying here again. The room is cute. Decently decorated while not making the room look even smaller. Bright and fresh. What was less acceptable was the fact that the bathroom clearly hadn't been cleaned before our arrival. The toilet wasn't flushed, there was quite a slew of curly gray hairs, a wet soap outline on the sink, other spots. Gross. And the location is truly great. We walked all over Manhattan from our hotel. Fabulous. We did hop on the subway multiple times, but never directly from or to our hotel, so I'm honestly not sure how close it is, though it really can't be all that far away. It had been explained to us that we had to agree to charges and sign in to use the free wifi, but that the charges would be wiped from our account upon check out, as it was included in our package. Unfortunately, our room was utterly devoid of even the faintest wifi signal. We mentioned it the morning after checking in and the hotel did offer to move us to another room, but at that point we were all settled in and I didn't relish the thought of having to pack everything up, so, we sucked it up and did without our free wifi (they did offer us a complimentary breakfast in the attached restaurant one day to make up for it. It was far from the best dining experience of our lives, but I don't remember the name of the restaurant, so I shant be reviewing that.) We were also there during the time change. We arrived in our room the night before to find a reminder to change the time on our own time keeping items, and noting that housekeeping would change the clock in our room. No one every bothered to change the time in the clock in our room. We managed to get along just fine, but I find the lack of followthrough irritating. On the whole, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if it was wildly more affordable than anything else available, but only if it was much, much more affordable than any other option.

Nothing is cheap in NYC, and neither is this place, but it's affordable and near major attractions (and just a few blocks from Grand Central Station!). Highly recommended!

<Title>“Left before the snow!”
<Content>We stayed here for 4 nights in October but left a day before the snow came. Two days earlier we were dressed in t shirts soaking up the sun in Central Park. We found the hotel very good and in a great location. It was easy walking distance from Penn Station and the transfers there from JFK were very quick and easy. The building work commented elsewhere seemed to be completed when we arrived but the lobby was closed off during our visit. This meant that for the last two days we had to enter and exit via 29th Street. This wasn't an issue for us but might have been for new arrivals as the entrance is not marked witht the hotels name but mysteriously is named Lola! We had breakfast and lunch at Bread & Butter deli on corner of 29th and Park. The choice here was excellent and good value, the reviews I have found of this place do not do it justice. Would avoid the bar opposite the main entrance as expensive and rude staff. But would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay again for a future visit to New York.

<Title>“Excellent location, but still needs the final finishing touches”
<Content>Hotel is located in a great part of town, just near 5th Ave. I am sure the hotel is going to be wonderful when it is completed but please note they are still working on the finishing touches, so it isnt perfect, and there is visable construction going on. I am not sure if the room rates were less because of this construction, but it did seem to be very good value as location and room size are excellent. Perhaps the cost will go up when it is complete. BAthrooms were also really nice and spacious. The lobby looks great, and even though the construction work was going on, it has all been kept very tidy and presentable, and i was never disturbed by any noise. They do need to sort the issue with the 'residents' as the smoke does cause a problem in the rooms. I hope they can get this done as the hotel shows real promise, but at present this really is a flaw.

<Content>Went to NY for a weekend getaway and we booked Thirty Thirty for a few main reason. Price, location and reviews we read. It didn't disappoint. We informed them we were on our anniversary and they upgraded us to king size bed for free. Room was clean, modern and lots of space. You can tell the lobby is new and modern. Needs some more lighting though. ONly downside is internet. Don't understand why hotels in NY don't provide free Wifi. Location is great. There is a really nice WineBar across the street that my wife and I would hit every day after our long walks and right before dinner. Its small, cute and nice selection. Overall you can get wrong with this hotel. Totally recommend.

<Title>“Awful staff”
<Content>We will not be returning to this hotel simply because of the staff and the service in this hotel. The rooms were modern and more spacious than we were expecting, and the location and price very good for NYC, but the level of service from the staff was appalling. We will find a hotel which has staff which display more courteous and helpful attitudes. An example: Upon check out on the 16th we asked to keep our luggage at the hotel as our flight was not until 6pm. We were told to speak to the bellman for this. We asked to do this and he said 'how many bags?', we said '4' and he said 'what, all these bags?' as if this was unreasonable. The bellman, a middle aged Indian man, then asked us how we were getting to the airport and we said a taxi. He then laughed in our face and proceeded to lecture us about how expensive it will be and that we should book his service at a fixed price of 90 dollars. This was a Sunday so we expected no traffic and we were going off an estimate that a taxi would cost roughly $65 from our guide book, which turned out to be accurate. This man then proceeded to rudely try and harangue us into using his service after my saying we are not interested several times. He then muttered under his breath about us as he took our bags into the holding room. It felt like we were being harassed by an unlicensed taxi service provider at an airport, certainly not what we would expect upon checking out of a Manhattan Hotel. This man was obviously only interested in booking a car for us so he could earn a commission rather than actually doing his job. Upon collecting our bags the man then removed them from the room an placed them directly outside the holding room and watched us move the bags down the stairs on our own, not offering to help despite seeing us struggle. He then hovered next to us while we were getting organized, and when I said 'thank you', he then asked for ' a fee for the service. I do tip generously for these kinds of things, but this man deserved nothing and his attitude is the worst i have ever encountered from any hotel staff in any country. He moved our bags a total of 5 meters, in and out of the room. We tipped him $2 simply so he would leave us alone. I would also like to point out that there was no bellman in sight upon our arrival at the hotel, or if there was a bellman, they made themselves scarce and did not help us with our baggage. Steer clear of this hotel if you expect to be treated with courtesy.

<Title>“Decidedly Average”
<Content>I stayed here with a friend recently and was not overly impressed. The beautiful leather and marble lobby wasn't indicative of the rest of the hotel. The room was easily the smallest room I have ever stayed in. When the door was opened to enter, it barely cleared the first bed. Suitcases had to be stored on the windowsill in the bathroom. No tea/coffee facilities in the room. No glasses to drink from, only plastic tumblers. My cousins tried to make contact with me at the hotel but when they tried to leave a voice message on the room phone, the recording informed them I had checked out. In actuality I had just arrived. They then spoke to a receptionist who said she would leave a note under my door. I never got that note. When I inquired at the front desk, I was told nobody had called. I am a former Hotel Manager and I felt the Thirty Thirty fell down on a number of aspects. On a positive note the concierge was particularly helpful, storing our luggage and organising our transfer to the airport. It is also in a fairly central location, just a short walk from Time Square. Overall I'm not sure I would stay again.

<Title>“boutique feel for good price - but reconstruction ongoing”
<Content>Stayed here twice in August/September 2011, so I can make some conclusions. First stay: considering the relatively low price (for NYC) that I got through internet booking, I could not believe my eyes: freshly renovated, spacious room with very contemporary furniture, two (2) flat-screen TVs, coffee maker, extra chairs and conference table (yes, there was space even for that - that's also where the second TV set was, the first was of course in the "sleeping area")... simply heaven. Second stay: My favorite booking site offered slightly higher price this time (still well below 200 dollars a night), but having the previous experience, I did not hesitate. While the room had the same furniture, it was very small (it was difficult to walk to the bathroom - so little space between the bed and the wall), there was no coffee maker, and of course only 1 flat screen TV. There was no indication of room differences during the booking process, so I tend to think I was simply lucky the first time and got a room in a different category. A chance to get lucky for anybody :-) PS: There was a big and messy reconstruction ongoing at the reception area during my stay. Perhaps that also contributed to the good price - I cannot imagine the price will stay that way forever. If it does, this hotel would be one of the best deals in NYC.

<Title>“Excellent choice and will return”
<Content>For a single traveler like me, I found myself liking to Thirty Thirty Hotel. It is central in downtown, close to hot spots and Korean Town. Korean Town is a must for food wise when you are around the area. Hotel looks dark from the outside but the room inside is pleasant, equipped with modern furnishings and elegant bathrooms. If you are a single traveler, you can request for a single bed and its cheaper than the standard room rate. I booked this room at very last minute and I arrived at Penn Station, which was convenient. Finding a right hotel in NYC can be quite stressful, not to mention, some people can scam you off from listings in craigslist. I will be back soon to stay here. FYI, they do not have certain amenities like 4-5 star hotels do.

<Title>“Great value and location.”
<Content>Stayed in this hotel October 2010. Found it very last minute after arrival in New York after our previous arrangements fell through. (cautionary tale about booking through Craiglist not included) Hotel room was spacious with a large king sized bed, a couch, TV, wardrobe, and bathroom with a spacious shower. Price was very reasonable considering the first night we arrived in New York we paid double the amount to stay in a hotel room that literally had a queen sized bed with standing room around the bed which made up the rest of the room. Room was clean and new. Overall very happy with the room and service of the staff, who helped us in a rush to flag a cab and negotiate a fixed price to drive us to the airport so we didn't get ripped off.

<Title>“Great stay”
<Content>Spent five nights in NYC and stayed at the Hotel Thirty Thirty. Tiny room, surprisingly large bathroom, and all of it very newly redone. Very clean. Smelled of smoke, but whatever--not bad enough for me to do anything about it. We were only in the room to sleep, so none of that mattered. Housekeeping did leave a vacuum cleaner in our room one day and the next a bottle of cleaner and a cloth, but again, didn't bother me enough to do anything about it. Bellmen/concierge very friendly, front desk people slightly chilly in their handling, but it was fine. Great location. Zara's is a good place to sit out and watch the world go by over a poor cup of coffee for $2.50. Crooked Knife across the street had great food and friendly staff. Price of Hotel Thirty Thirty was good for NYC and I would absolutely stay again. THE most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept on.

<Title>“Good, but they were renovating”
<Content>A bit disappointed about our experience since they were renovation. We got a small room, but it was brand new and modern. But very small and it almost didn't room our suitcase. We also paid full price although it was a construction site. Close to fifth avenue and Empire state, so it was very central. The breakfast cost us 40 dollars for plain breakfast for two and two orange juices-over priced. But I think when they are finished it will be a great hotell, and we will probally revisit.

<Title>“Smokers Paradise!!”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at this hotel in September 2011. We moved rooms 3 times, our first room was on the 7th floor as you came out of the elevator the smell of smoke hit you. The nearer we got to our room the smell got worse and when we entered the room it smelt like an ash tray. We went down to the front desk and the night porter came up and agreed that our room smelt of smoke, we unfortunately couldn't be moved as the hotel was full. When we spoke to the front desk in the morning they said it was because a resident lived in the room next door so the smell was coming from them but they couldn't do anything about it. We asked to be moved and we were then given a room on the 4th floor which had no safe in, we then moved again two rooms down and this was ok until our last night when my partner tried to find her PJ's and they were gone!!!! When we checked out we did ask that if any were found if we could have them back!!!??? The hotel will be nicely decorated afer the refurbishment but it did look like a builders site in the lobby but apparently the refurbishment will be done soon.

<Title>“Renovation in the lobby but otherwise excellent!”
<Content>I stayed here for two nights- Sept 29- Oct 1. I got in at around 11pm and renovations in the lobby were in full swing, and I was prepared for the worst further inside. To check in, the manager had to take my credit card and ID to a back room (because the reception area was full of workers, and covered in a tarp) and I wasn't really sure what was going on. I think he could tell I was confused/frustrated because I ended up getting an upgrade to an AMAZING room. Once upstairs, I found the hallways clean and nice, my room was also fabulous (renovated, clean, smelled fine, lots of space) and for my entire stay the staff was friendly and accomodating despite the somewhat hectic lobby atmosphere. Managers were helpful and answered all my questions, my luggage was able to stay in the hotel for the day after we checked out and sight-saw. Not only this, but the location is great, two blocks from the subway. Would definitely stay again.

<Title>“Smells badly”
<Content>I wasn't bother by renovations, decor, location. I can deal with all that, renovations don't bother me at all, and I knew the area already. I checked in a room on the 6th floor, but didn't spend 10 seconds there. The smell of cigarette smoke was awful. Front desk even told me: "previous tenants at this room actually smoked in there, and there is nothing we can do about it". They offered me a room on the 12th (highest) floor. Better, but still smelly. Complained once more, nothing happened. The smell got worse and worse through the end of the evening. At the lobby, the front desk told me "There might be a smoker using the bathroom vent for this smoke". And then again, from a different person at the front desk: "yeah, we get a lot of complaints about the 10th floor, but never heard of a smoker on the 12th floor. I'll Go check it". No help, nothing. If you are a smoker, that's the perfect hotel for you. For those that still look for the "non smoking" signs, stay somewhere else.

<Title>“Great hotel, great location, great price”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at Hotel Thirty Thirty for a few nights on a vacation in June. Overall, we had a great experience. We arrived at the hotel around 11am (moving from another hotel) and were hoping that the hotel would store our bags until we could check-in. They ended up having a room available and let us check-in right away! We stayed in the standard renovated king and we were very surprised at the size for the price (we may have gotten a good deal because we booked close to our travel date and it was in the middle of their renovations). The room was clean and spacious and gave us plenty of room to spread out. We were on the inside of the hotel, so the view wasn't good, but we weren't expecting a view with what we paid. There was some construction noise, but it didn't bother us. The location is fantastic - we felt very safe walking back late at night and were only a few blocks from the metro. Our flight didn't leave NYC until night and we were able to store our bags at the hotel so that we could do some sight-seeing our last day. We really appreciated this amenity! We would definitely recommend stating at Hotel Thirty Thirty.

<Title>“The Best Value in NYC”
<Content>My wife and I just stayed at Hotel Thirty Thirty. We have stayed there before but have not visited in a few years. The Hotel is under renovation and although there is work going on in the Lobby, we were not disrupted in any way. The staff has remained the same over the years and the familiar faces and friendly people are part of a great team. The room was fabulous, a Jr. Suite, brand new very designer furniture, the bed was super comfortable and they use duvets instead of traditional linens which my wife prefers the euro linens that they use, much cleaner than blankets. The carpeting is not the typical busy type but again tastefully unique. The bathroom was also spectacular, all brand new, plenty of shelf space to place your stuff. There will be a new bar added to the lobby, we ate at Zana. the attached restaurant and the meal was also very good and not too expensive. The neighborhood is great, I prefer the Murray Hill location just off Madison.

Reception area was under contruction, we were not affected by the noise. The staff was indifferent. Internet very pricey but a search revealed Google WIFI free of charge. All in all, would not go back but it was just about OK. Expensive for what it was!

<Title>“would stay again to see the finished product”
<Content>i was dissapointed to arrive and see the construction but in the end while it took away from the wow factor it did not affect me at all. I felt more sorry for the people working at reception because it was loud! When i checked it at about 7:30 at night the poor gentleman at the reception was overwhelmed as many check in were taking place and the phone was ringing non-stop. I was surprised with how large my room was. the reno's were fresh and really great. the bathroom was huge as well. Again i was disappointed to find a rubber glove in my bathroom (that remained there for two days even after i mentioned it to the front desk, i eventually took it too the front desk) my shower curtain was also in a ball on the floor(though was fixed quickly once i went to the desk, though they never took that glove) there was a weird smell in the hall that did permeate the room, like cigarette smoke. I was disappointed with housekeeping, my toiletries were not refreshed (or picked up off the shower floor) the towels were only kind of folded. my bed was really comfy and the room really quiet, except for the a/c. all in all i have stayed in much worse, the location was also great which is a huge plus. though the $13 for internet is a little steep, especially if they want business travelers who must have access. I would stay again if only to see the completed reno's!

<Title>“not for us !!!!”
<Content>after travelling for 12 hours, all we wanted to do was get a shower and change clothing. we arrived at the hotel and was told our room wasn't ready for 2 hours. we left our cases and went for a wander round. we arrived back to be told it would be 10 minutes. 40 minutes later and i got called to reception with 'COME'. (receptionist could not speak or understand english at all. it took 5 minutes to spell my name out.) which didn't amuse me one little bit. we finally got to our room. small, couldn't get the case in. we had to throw our cases over the bed and go in one at a time because of the gap. the room was clean, bathroom was nice but flooded when we had a shower and was not impressed with the frosted window. surely, if i can see the man on his pc opposite then he can see me sat on the toilet. felt a little uncomfortable espeically at night with the light on. towel rail also hanging off but nothing done about it even though clean towels were put on it everyday. air con was very loud so couldn't have it on at night. didn't feel safe in that area at night time. the only plus was concierge staff were lovely and very helpful, we never saw anybody on our floor and it was quiet apart from traffic outside and close to empire state building (30 minute walk to time square). still some work being done in reception. would i recommend this hotel- NO. would i stay here again- NO !!!!

<Title>“Great hotel, will be staying again”
<Content>We got a room on 9th floor, with a view to the Empire State Building. Room was very nice looking and had good size, with a comfortable bed. Very clean. They were doing construction work in the reception, but this never bothered us. The a/c in our room was extremely noisy, we had to keep it off during the nights to get some sleep. Nice looking bathroom, only negative thing was that when showering the water flooded the whole floor, even if we tried to cover the gap under the shower doors with towels. Anyway, this isn't a dealbreaker for us, and we will return to Thirty thirty at our next trip! Hotel had a car service that took us to JFK at same rates as taxis.

<Title>“Wonder why I keep going back.”
<Content>It must be inertia. You find out you're going to NYC and you need a room. No time to search. So you go with the default position. The Thirty Thirty. I like the location, but these days, that's about it. The renovations have been going on so long it's like they'll never end. Every time I check in, there's a problem. Last time, they sent me to a room that was occupied. I opened the door to find a terrified woman screaming. The time before, the sheets were dirty and the ceiling leaked. The time before that, even though I had confirmed twins, I had to sleep in a queen sized bed with my 15 year old. The internet is outrageously overpriced. There's no room service and the concierge spends more time booking cab rides (to make commissions) than he does much else. Next time, I'll spend the time and find something better.

<Content>My wife and I went May 2009 for 5 nights. A great little hotel, nice clean rooms..not big but not too small. When you in Manhattan you dont spend much time in your room anyway. The location is ideal for seeing the City as you pretty much bang in the middle of the main part of Manhattan and can easily walk most places from the Hotel. Near to lots of good restaurants and a short walk to 5th Ave where you can get anywhere in the city quickly.

<Title>“Excellent”
<Content>We stayed here over Christmas 2009 (I cannot change the date above) and it was super! It is in a brilliant part of town, easy to access all the main places and quite cheap and easy to get a taxi to Central Park on Christmas Day. Just a couple of blocks from the subway (which is also cheap) and opposite a super restaurant where we had Boxing Day supper. Because it is mid-town it is lovely and quiet at night and is just down from the Empire State Building (where we found a super steak house!). The staff were friendly and helpful. The restaurant isn't part of the hotel but was open on Christmas morning and was brilliant - lots of food and not too expensive. Our room was huge (but I paid extra to have the space) and the only thing was that the heating didn't always work but the staff came to fix it each time. The room was lovely and clean, had a safe, sofa, TV and a super big bathroom (but no bath). It was excellent value for money!

Enough room for a single bed, desk, wardrobe, lovely bathroom with a shower and ample floor space. Currently there is building work going on in reception but didn't affect me. The lifts are slow and the internet in expensive but they are the only criticisms

<Content>This was a father-son raod trip to catch 3-baseball games. The 30-30 is ideally located 10 minutes walk from Penn Station. We are twenty minutes walk from Time Square and other sights. The rooms are small-ish but comfortable and redecorated as a boutique hotel. Price is competitve for Midtown Manhattan. Staff are attentive, courteous & fairly prompt. We got stuck during Hurrican Irene scare that shoutdown the city. We couldn't leave NYC as planned & asked to re-book for one extra night; they gave us a 25% 'Storm' discount, plus free internet and complimentary breakfast. That was nice. They appeared to be pretty much prepared for the worst of the hurricane with letters sent to each room with advisories and warnings. We were secure in that fact. I would recommend the Thirty-Thirty and I will return.

<Title>“Great Location in Manhattan”
<Content>We picked this hotel because of its location. It is very close to subway station 28th Street and also 33th Street and Penn Station. Via these stations you can reach nearly every tourist points of Manhattan. Even the hotel is considerably new, there was a renovation going on while we were staying. I'm curious about the result of this renovation. Rooms are not very spacious but with two large luggages and one medium size one, we managed to fit :) There is also a radio which you can use your Ipod, which is a cool thing from my point of view. Staff are kind and helpful. If the reason of your stay in NYC is vacation, this is the hotel you should stay.

<Title>“Tempted to keep this gem a secret!”
<Content>My son and I spent 3 nights at Hotel Thirty Thirty (08/21-24) and other than an obnoxiously loud a/c and sub-par wi-fi that was not complimentary, I have nothing but good things to say. Our room (standard renovated Queen on the 9th floor) was surprisingly large by NYC standards, extremely clean and (with the a/c thankfully not needed) very quiet. The bed was quite comfortable and had six pillows (SIX!) which we appreciated. There was room enough in the room for a large dresser, two night tables, a reading chair and a lamp. The closet was large enough, there was an electronic safe that came in handy and the bathroom was smallish but well appointed. This spring I traveled for a few weeks in Eastern Europe and had no problem finding free wi-fi even in the most remote towns. For some reason, this was near impossible in NYC, other than in a Starbucks. After 2 days of not being able to access my emails, I decided to give in and pay the $14/day fee the hotel charges. Only problem was, I could connect from the hallway but lost the network the second I walked into our room! The very courteous staff immediately removed the charge from my bill at my request but I couldn't help but think they should a) fix the issue which has been brought up on this site often and b) offer complimentary wi-fi. As for the a/c, we thankfully didn't need it but this thing is LOUD! I'm used to noisy window units but didn't expect it from this sort of system. Definitely wouldn't be fun to be there during a heatwave and have to use it. But these are minor irritants. All in all we are happy to have discovered this gem in Midtown and won't hesitate to return and recommend it.

<Title>“Good value hotel-good location, decent rooms”
<Content>I have stayed in ThirtyThirty several times over the past few years - quite basic but in a good central location, rooms are ok - small but comfy and clean. Recently the rooms and hallways have had a makeover and look nice and fresh, the lobby was still being refurbished but wasn't an inconvenience. Good hotel for a base for exploring NYC.

<Title>“Amazing location, comfortable room, great value.”
<Content>My girlfriend and I just spent 3 nights at 4 days in New York City. The location of this hotel was more than we could have asked for. We ate at many excellent restaurants in the area, including the crooked knife across the street. The desk let us check in many hours early and leave our bags for many hours after checkout. Our room was on the 12th (top) floor and had a great view of the Empire State Building and midtown. Unlike previous reviewers, we had no indication of any smoke near our room. My girl said that on her trip to the lone, overworked ice machine on the 10th floor, she encountered a thick cigarette smoke smell, however. Unfortunately for us, the lobby was still under renovation. It is sure to be impressive when it is done. We will return to Hotel 3030 and certainly recommend it.

<Title>“Wonderful, quiet...we'll be back”
<Content>Our trip started w/ need to change our reservation, which couldn't be done via the internet. An email to the hotel took care of the change very easily. We arrived early and were simply hoping to check our bags at the front desk until check-in time. Not only were we allowed to check-in early, but we were given an upgrade and the front desk person even called housekeeping to ensure the room was ready. The room was fantastic and very quiet. The bed was great! Even with the construction going on and the elevators out of commission once in a while, that did not dampen our enjoyment of the hotel. The restaurant adjacent to the hotel, Zana's, was fabulous! We will definitely be back!!

<Title>“Super clean and new furnishings in room but undergoing renovations”
<Content>Got a superdeal on a family room (largest room available, with 2 double beds) on TravelZoo last spring for a room in August--4 nights. Arrived at 2:30 pm and was told to come back in an hour--but we had plans to go to the evening program at MOMA so didn't get back tll 11pm. Took us to the room with our luggage and requested fridge in tow--but there was only one double bed. The room we reserved was not available. Called them from room #1 and they sent us to a room no one could locate. All this made more difficult by the fact that only 1 of 3 elevators was operable. (They indicated they had called for repairs, the repair man had come, but then they broke down again. ) We were then offered a room with one bed and one sofa bed which we rejected. Then the offered us 2 rooms which worked out better as we now had 2 bathrooms to get ready in. We didn't get the rooms until midnight!! The process took an hour!! The room we had on the second floor was very large, with a separate sitting area with two chairs, a desk and a third chair and 2nd television. The bath was large, with an undercounter sink and plenty of space for toiletries--newly tiled huge shower--no tub. The room colors, including the bath--gray. Nothing on the walls--basically no color in the room. Didn't go up to check on the other room. But did go to the 10th floor to get ice; ice machine wasn't working. Went to front desk and was told to go next door to the restaurant. The next evening I was going to go get ice again but elevator problems and the renovations in the lobby made that task less than easy. The staff was super friendly--couldn't have been nicer and they apologized for the room problems we had upon checking in. This hotel just has a few kinks that need to be worked out. It is located on E. 30th between Madison and Park, so is only a block from the south to north bus line on Madison. It is 12 blocks south of Times square and 3 blocks east. We were able to walk with our luggage from Penn Station to the hotel (we are in our 50's). The beds were the best of this 3 week trip.

<Title>“Great little find..and I emphasize "little"!”
<Content>After much hunting for the lowest priced hotel in NYC...I found the Hotel Thirty-thirty. Before booking, I read a lot of the TA reviews..and it seemed good for our needs. My husband and I arrived on a Saturday around 4pm...we checked in quickly and efficiently and were given our keys. I had booked a Queen Renovated Room...we got to our room on the 7th floor---it was certainly compact--but it did have all that we needed. We knew we'd really only spend time in the room to sleep and change clothes--we really were on the go the entire 2 days. The room has all new carpeting-and it fully renovated--new bathroom--with an odd shower--only 1/2 a glass wall--you kind of have to be careful not to soak the whole bathroom! There was quite a bit of street noise--even on the 7th floor--could hear sirens--loudly---but it's NY--so you adapt. The hotel is located in a quiet area--away from the city hustle and bustle--and we liked that feature. There are many restaurants nearby..and Times Square is walkable, if you like to walk. My only realy complaint would be that the internet kiosks in the lobby were not complimentary. We wanted to print our boarding passes--and the minimum charge was $2.00--and the desk didn't have change!! At any hotel--they ALWAYS print your boarding passes for free! Also, we had a very early morning flight-and we asked if we could get a cab --and the front desk clerk only offered to get us a hired car---so we hailed our own 1/2 block up the street. But, overall, we were pleased with our stay at the Thirty-Thirty--and would return--especially for the good rate we got. (Booked directly thru their website).

<Title>“Always communicate if your hotel is under construction!”
<Content>I was looking for a good deal at an hotel , not too far from NYU. Thirty Thirty is definitedly very well located , in a cool neighbourhood. Rooms are small, very small but comfortable and a nice design. Staf is friendly and easy going. In the same street you have few nice bars and restaurants. Hardly acceptable is that no one communicatd on the major construction going on in this hotel. Didnt find anything on the hotels website, neither on Expedia, where i booked. Assume it will become only better, but nevertheless..

<Title>“We loved it!”
<Content>This hotel was perfect for our trip to NYC. The bedrooms are cozy - think luxurious minimalist. Of course, if the price was a bit lower it would have been even better but I would pay that price again. It was conveniently located in Murray Hill - Midtown, or as we like to call it Curry Hill! Lots of great Indian restaurants in walking distance. The concierge is the person to speak with about city information. The folks at the desk seem to focus on the reservations and room information. We had a standard queen room and the bed was super cozy. The hotel staff will also upgrade your room if available to a higher floor to get you again from the street noise. That is what we did - and I didn't hear any noise. Enjoy!

<Content>We had a tiny room with two twin beds and (omg, are twin beds really this small??) it was quite cramped in the room. However the bathroom was quite large (in comparison to the small sized room). For the price and location near times square, you really can't beat the deal. Two thumbs up.

<Title>“Frugal yet very clean, comfortable, and modern”
<Content>"Frugal" means economical -- it doesn't have to mean "cheap." This is a hotel for travelers who just want a clean room, a comfortable bed, and space to shower, change clothes, and repack your stuff. Decor was utilitarian, simple, non-flimsy, and contemporary. Everything worked (shower, TV, toilet, thermostat). Other reviews report that the building is being renovated, and if so we were fortunate to have been lodged in a room that was relatively fresh and undamaged. We thought our bed was particularly comfortable. My only warning to fellow travelers concerns the HVAC. The central air conditioning is loud. In fact the whole floor thrummed with the sound of a massive compressor. I heard it in our room and in the hallway and everywhere I went. If this constant vibration were accompanied by rattles or buzzes it would have been a problem, but the deep hum of the ventilation system, while making quiet conversation difficult, did not keep us awake. It actually served as a white noise that made rest easier for me. There are almost no frills. Amenities include one limping ice machine on the 10th floor that serves the whole building, plastic cups in the bathroom, no-name toiletries, basic cable on the TV, and a moderate wardrobe that serves as the closet. Our room also came with a safe and an ironing board and a hair dryer. Room for improvement would include more hooks for hanging towels and clothing. Staff was friendly, though very busy. When we checked out, the staffer at the front desk offered to store our bags for us, assuming we were off to spend more time in the city before departing. When we return we will take advantage of this in our plans. I reserved this room at a frankly suspicious price and feared for the worst. Instead we were thrilled at the value we received.

<Title>“Exceptionally nice room, ideal after a long flight from the Mideast"”
<Content>I've been a repeat customer at Hotel Thirty Thirty since September 2008, when one of my daughters got married nearby at the famed Little Church Around the Corner. This time I had just landed at JFK after a long flight from Cyprus with my young cat. I was immediately offered an upgrade on a high floor (Room 1145). This was actually a small (but not too small) suite with a nicely proportioned bedroom separate from the living area. It appeared to have been newly decorated, in stylish but low-key colors and furnishings. It was comfortable, spotless and notably quiet for mid-town Manhattan. Desk and housekeeping staff were helpful and friendly throughout. In my experience the wall-mounted TVs are new and always work well. Amenities include iron and ironing board. This is all very good value and I look forward to returning. I'd consider it for a long stay -- potentially a true home away from home.

The hotel room was on the small side but that's not a big deal when you're out exploring. Restaurants near are excellent (try Wine:30 or even the restaurant in the hotel). I would definitely go again!

<Content>We stayed at Hotel Thirty Thirty for three nights in august 2010 and we enjoyed it a lot. The room was tiny but enough for us. The staff was really friendly and the concierge gave us very good help with tickets and tips. The location is great, close to Empire State Building. Only negative thing is that I sent an e-mail to the hotel in advance, and I had to send another three emails to get them to answer. From my first mail to their answer it took about 2 months.

<Content>Went on my first visit to NY, after much research on Hotels decided to give this one a try wasn't to sure at first since it didn't seem to close to Times Square but the price was right. It is only a 5 min cab ride from Time Square and 10 min from Central Park, walking distance to The Empire State Building and 15 train ride to China Town. Their sevice is great and the hotel very clean. I will definitly stay here again on my next visit to NY.

<Title>“Good sized room, very weak internet”
<Content>Arrived early and my room was ready--very nice. I'm a nonsmoker and they put me in a smoking room, but I didn't mind (lots of other folks might, I suppose). It was good sized and the location's super. Paid a high price for extremely weak internet (13.95) but the front desk clerk was able to put in some access codes to allow me to also hook up my smart phone on the first night. When I tried to do the same on the second night, the much-less-helpful clerk told me I would have to pay a second $13.95 to hook up my smart phone, which I declined to do because the internet was barely useable anyway. The restaurant that you access from the lobby isn't actually associated with the hotel so you can't bill to your room. Had a plumbing issue on the first night and the engineering guy arrived very promptly (10 minutes) to fix it.

<Content>I was looking for a reasonably priced hotel near Chelsea, and was very happy with this one. The room and bathroom were beautifully remodeled. The front desk was efficient and helpful. Location is good - fairly close to subway, near Madison Square Park. It is air conditioned, which is essential for a summer room in NYC. The only negative was the view from the room into a courtyard of other buildings. But with the curtains closed, the place was perfect.

The room were were given was a small room with a normal double bed even though we booked a queen size bed. Advised reception and without delay transfered us to a room with the queen size bed. Spacious room, good size tv and lovely shower area.....obviously this was one of the room that had been refurbished. Lovely staff and very helpful infact the whole city was the same generally.

<Title>“OMG was my room SMALL!”
<Content>I just got back from a business trip to NYC where I stayed at the Hotel Thirty Thirty. My hotel was booked through a website that advertised the room as a Single/Double. I was assigned the "comfort room" at the hotel. Now, I've stayed in NYC many times and understand the "NYC size" of hotel rooms. But this was literally the SMALLEST room that I have ever stayed in my life. It was a single bed + 2 ft wide and a single bed + 4 feet long. There was a bathroom which was nice, but the room was downright claustrophobic. The air conditioner worked well, but it was extremely loud. Internet was for a fee. The hotel was updated and the rooms appeared new. But the size was a huge negative. Especially since the rate was still $200+ per night. Thus I would highly recommending that you have two guests, even if you are only alone if want to stay here.

<Title>“All that is 'needed'”
<Content>Just got home from a quick 36 hour weekend getaway to NYC. I probably spent a dozen hours looking for the right hotel room. I was treating my mother to a little vacay after she retired from 30+ years of nursing. I didn't have big budget and needed a room with two beds. That's a challenge in Manhattan. I found the 30 30 on Expedia and then made my booking from their website. Very easy to navigate and great cancellation terms. Two days before leaving for New York, I noticed the price had fallen from $179 to $139. I cancelled my original reservation and rebooked at the lower rate. What a deal! The entrance is nothing special and the lobby is sufficient. They are still in the middle of the building overhaul. I expect this was an apartment building, turned condo, turned hotel. Our double twin was not available, but they upgraded us to a King Suite. Small consolation. The room (423) was directly across from the elevator. Didn't bother us much. LOCATION: So that hotel is a great location for some and not so much for others. I can't stand Ties Square or busy tourist sections of midtown. This hotel is in Murray Hill, on the lower east side of "Midtown". It is quiet(er) and has a more authentic neighbourhood feel. The 33rd and 28th street subway stations on the 4,5,6 line are within two minutes walk. The Starbucks (always a big selling point for this country boy) is around the corner at 29th and Park. BATHROOM: Very clean, nice toiletries, good light, hair-dryer. Dislikes; no bathtub and plastic cups for drinking glasses. ROOM: Modern and spacious (at least ours was). Nice bed linens and very comfortable pillow top king mattress. New paint and carpeting. Some "IKEA-like" furniture. Great blinds for half shade and full shade - nice to sleep in with. Mounted flat screen television. Not sure what kind of channel selection it got, we never turned it on. Ironing board and iron in the closet. Laundry service apparently available. No minibar or refrigerator. Not much of a view, but who cares, you don't go to New York to look our the hotel room window. RESTAURANT: some semblance of a Greek, Spanish, French, Italian (Mediterranean I suppose) thing in the lobby. Had potential, but Gordon Ramsay would throw a fit at the decor, confused menu and service. I think some rooms included breakfast there. INTERNET: Available for fee throughout the building. Better yet, go have a martini in the restaurant and ask the bar tender for the "ZANA" wifi key. Will I return? YES. Location, price and value is exceptional.

<Title>“Pretty average!”
<Content>We got an incredible rate for this hotel becuase of a friend, so I hate to fuss about it. But honestly I would have been dissapointed had we had to pay more. The rooms are nice, good-central location, but the front desk service ruined what was nice about the hotel. When we arrived the person that checked us in barely spoke to us, no "how are you" " what brings you to NYC", etc. He asked my name and then handed me a key and said our room was on the 9th floor. You know it really doesn't take a lot to give good customer service, and it's really dissapointing when you don't get it! Also, charging $14.95 per day for internet is just absurd! We stayed at two other hotels during our trip to Boston, NYC & New Orleans and they didn't charge for internet. And I know that a lot of hotels around the world are now offering it for free. So to me charging that amount was lame and just a way to make a few extra bucks. So I have to say that I wouldn't return to this hotel and probably not recommend it to anyone, unless you're getting a really good rate.

The restaurant across the street was always busy but we never found time to visit...next time. The hotel staff were very friendly and when our room's AC broke down, the repairman was so apologetic and he fixed it within an hour. Don't hesitate to book here. It is within a short walk to some great attractions and with Macy's down the street...no complaints.

I was shown a very large room on a high floor, but the bathroom hadn't been cleaned so I was immediately given a different one, which was large, clean and comfortable, with the bed being especially comfy and the bathroom well-equipped. I slept well, opened the blinds in the morning and found I had a great view of the Empire State Building. The hotel seemed to have everything I needed, but my stay was too short to try out most of the services.

<Title>“we will not be back”
<Content>Stayed here last october thought it was great until they tried to charge me again for my stay 3 months after my trip!!! when I tried to sort this out the accounts manager was so rude it was unbelievable. I got most of my money back and I wrote to complain however 6months on and I still haven't heard from them so I wouldn't reccommend this hotel there are lots of other great places to stay in NYC. New York was fantastic the actions of the acounts manager rather spoilt a special trip.

<Title>“Very comfy beds - nice room”
<Content>We stayed for 1 night at the hotel, and it was very nice. This hotel is somewhat pricier than the hotels we usually stay at - but we used the current promotion they have. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a superior room on the 10th floor. Just wonderful. The beds are wonderful, sheets to comfy, and satin-like sheets. The hotel is currently undergoing re-construction but we were not hassled by this. A few things in the room was not completely finished, but it was minor details. Just across the street is a very nice wine bar/restaurant "30 Wine", which can definitely be recommended. Very nice food. Only minus: wifi ought to be free - costs are 14 USD for 24 hours.

<Title>“would not return”
<Content>the room was hot, very noisey, could hear the bar party till 3AM and garbage trucks every night, there are amenities if you consider a blow dryer an amenity, they did not have enough towels, no counter space and the lighting was terrible. Too expensive for what we got. Would not recommend.

<Title>“Insolvable and Permanent Secondhand Smoke”
<Content>Part of the hotel seems actually to be low rent housing. Some of these permanent tenants smoke, and poison the non-smoking hotel rooms. The air not only reaks, but physically hurts your stomach and throat. It does not get better after time. The front desk knows about the smoke, isn't surprised when you complain. Apparently, "There is nothing [they] can do." The smoking tenants have lived there for 15 years.

<Title>“Good business professional's hotel but not if you need to exercise”
<Content>Stayed here one night while on a business trip. The check-in line was moving a bit slowly while I was there but the woman checking me in seemed to be doing her best to stay friendly. It was odd that it was only 1 person that could do the checking in. + well-decorated lobby & my room & bathroom were, too + updated flatscreen TV + good desk chair - I was surprised that they charged that extra fee for wifi. - No fitness center. If I wanted a workout I had to get some pass and go blocks away to get it done. - hallway and/or room had a little cigarette smoke stench to it (and I don't smoke) The size is bearable/maybe slightly more spacious for a NYC hotel/business trip. It'd be cozy for 2.

<Title>“It all comes down to creatue comforts & personal touches...”
<Content>The main purpose of my trip was to celebrate my 30th birthday in New York and having been to New York before, I wanted to stay somewhere in Manhattan that would allow me to walk to most places of the places I wanted to visit or have quick subway access. I chose Hotel Thirty Thirty because it fulfilled this criteria but also the price for the room was just within my budget and the positive reviews I read on Trip Advisor suggested this would be a wise choice. Sadly, it wasn't the experience I had hoped for - having stayed in New York before, I was expecting a certain standard (and such, had paid for it too) but the hotel did not reach that standard. On a basic level, a hotel in New York needs to be in a good location, have a comfortable bed, a good shower and perhaps a TV if you are travelling alone (it is nice to have some background noise!) Whilst I was never going to be spending my whole trip in my room, it was important the room was comfortable and suited my needs so that I could get on with enjoying the city. I was staying in a Classic Single room and was surprised at how compact it was. A simple L shaped room meant there was barely enough room to move from bed to door without carefully negotiating the suitcase which had to be put near the door each time I was in the room to allow me to move about. Having stayed in NYC before, I knew the rooms were small but this room was very small and though I asked to be moved to a bigger room a few times, staff told me there was no chance of this happening but did offer to move me to another Classic Single which I saw and realised my current room was in better shape. Perhaps what annoyed me the most was the manner in which staff told me and the fact that I was staying five nights, a little empathy would not have gone amiss. Anyway, here are the positives about the hotel: - Location - Comfortable Bed - Good shower - Good TV in room - Ipod dock - Iron/Hairdryer Essentially, this is all one needs from a room but unfortunately, the negatives overrode these benefits: - Cleanliness - I thought the standard of cleaning was below par - my room was only deep cleaned once in my stay, the rest of the time, given a cursory wipe and new towels plonked on the toilet. I also complained about ants as a bread roll was thrown behind a sideboard by the previous tenant to which the receptionist tsk tsked in agreement but failed to get it dealt with and it stayed for the duration of my stay (though the ants did lessen) Air conditioning - Was very awkward to operate and at one stage was switched off by a cleaner/visitor to my room which meant I had to figure out how to operate it. It was also changed to heat mode which in the baking heat of June led to a very uncomfortable night and it was only in the morning that i realised that the setting had been changed to heat rather than cool (and i hadn't altered it in anyway before this point). - Wi Fi - I think it is very cheeky to charge $13 a day for Wi Fi seeing as some hotels give it for free. I understand from a business point of view that the hotel needs to charge but did feel that if if one is staying longer than three nights (which I was), this should be offered at a reduced rate or made complimentary. Plus, those computers in the lobby that charge 25 cents a minute and demand a $2 minimum will quickly eat up your money! - Staff- I found the staff were polite and perfunctory but not willing to help out further. Not only the bread roll incident but when I was asking to change my room, the receptionists both shook their heads and said no, without offering any reason (ie the hotel is full or I need to pay more), it was just not possible. Another occasion, I asked for the quickest route to an address I needed to get to and the member of staff told me he didn't know (fair enough) but made no further effort to help me find the answer. Information - Simple things like how much phone calls cost, how to work the air conditioning etc had to be asked. A simple information pack/binder in each room would have helped a great deal and meant I would be able to find out information more easily without asking staff. Also, there was a notepad with a single sheet in my room which i used and this was not replaced which was rather annoying as I needed a pen and paper when using the phone and constantly had to keep my own to hand. Honestly speaking, Hotel Thirty Thirty is not a bad hotel but I didn't feel like a valued guest nor did I feel that hotel was value for money. I would only recommend this hotel for a one night stay or if you get a room for a very good price (ie something you would pay for hostel). If you have a little bit more to spend or can stretch your budget, I would hold out for a deal with a boutique hotel or a chain which at least will have the most basic of creature comforts as standard. A real shame as this hotel has character (there are actually residents who live in the hotel) and a shabby chic which is quite endearing. Also, though I didn't mind the renovation, I would have probably gotten annoyed if it had been nearer to my room. Maybe I was expecting too much but I didn't feel i got value for money. Still, it didn't affect my trip too greatly but it didn't add to it either and for that, I am giving it average!

<Title>“Disappointing”
<Content>Service sucked. Our room did not get cleaned. When we called down for fresh towels we never got them. We were promised a queen size bed and they gave us a full size bed. We were also disappointed that the room lacked basic things such as a cup to drink water out of. Location was good but other than that it was not worth the price.

<Title>“Excellent Location! Helpful Staff! Walk to the Long Island RR & Penn etc”
<Content>We stayed here for one night, June 17th and did use our Travel Miles.It was a good value using our miles. We live on Long Island,NY And did a little getaway, We needed NYC to get re-energized. Got into NYC early @ 10:40 AM the room was ready!! A short walk from Pen Station. LIRR. Got to rest in AM. WOW. We thought they could hold our bag, but were so thrilled the room was ready. The concegiere was so helpful, he booked our entire stay, our wonderful night out to Dune Park & printed us a map with subway connection. The subway is short 2 blocks away. You get a cab ($5) on the corner uptown on Madison. We did our up town tour of Trump Tower, Central Park, Rockerfeller Center etc. Then downtown (on Subway) to Union Square. Farmers Market & Fishes Eddie. The cab took us back in a down pour, the thunder echoed in the city. A fun stay I feel I was gone a week. The room was a tiny room, SO WHAT. There were residences So WHAT You are living with the locals.Its not the Palace. All new paint, shades, new tile & carpet,LG flat screen. Double crisp white sheets,great pillows & great new bed! Perfect for one night. I would have liked a coffee maker. It was $1 at the deli on the corner.

<Title>“Clean, Modern, Helpful Staff, and Excellent Location”
<Content>Stayed here with my husband for a short vacation in the city. I get to NYC a few times a year by train so the hotel's location close to Penn Station was amazing. The hotel is on a great block with excellent restaurants. I recommend the Crooked Knife for dinner (across the street) Wine 30 (across the street) for appetizers and cocktails, Keko Cafe (30th and Madison) for breakfast, and Butter and Bread (29th and Park) for a market and a la cart food. Hotel staff were very friendly and made good restaurant recommendations. Hotel is still being renovated so we were disappointed that our first room on a partially-renovated floor smelled of old cigarette smoke and new paint. The staff was quick to give us a new room on the 8th floor that was clean and renovated. I was impressed with how quiet our room was. We couldn't hear street noise or noise from the hall/neighboring rooms. Of course the rooms here are small, this is NYC, so don't expect a lot of room to spread out. I have recently stayed at the Sheraton in midtown and the Waldorf Astoria and I prefer Hotel Thirty Thirty because you get simple, modern style in a great location for a really reasonable price.

<Title>“I'll be back because of great service!”
<Content>I have been staying here at a completely remodeled, modern hotel since June 1st and will continue until August. I came with 7 luggages and few bags, so I had to discuss my needs with the hotel management beforehand, and they have been courteous all the times. I learned that this hotel have different room sizes that meet your budget needs or travel needs. I got the spacious one including business desk with Internet connection at an affordable rate in NYC. I asked for a fridge and they sent one in immediately. Also they threw in Nespresso espresso maker, which brought to my surprise. To sum it up in two words: Style and Value!! PS: I love the upper wall color: chartreuse - pretty! And shower is awesome!

<Title>“Tiny Tiny Room”
<Content>Stayed in this hotel for 2 weeks in august with my partner and our 8 mth old Daughter. Well from the onset the staff were extremely rude, we arrived late a t night after travelling for 8 hours and were not given any help with our luggage(which was a lot of luggage) When we arrived at our room it was a box! The bathroom was nearly bigger than the room. We told the hotel we were bringing a travel cot and also rang ahead to make sure the room would be big enough to fit one and we were assured it would. What a joke! The cot was litteraly stuck i between the door and the bed, to get out of the room the cot would have to be moved every morning or climbed over, the buggy and most of our luggage had to be kept in the bathroom and the air conditioning made so much noise we were kept awake most of the night, would not reccomend this hotel to anybody.

<Title>“First Timer in the Big Apple!”
<Content>Stayed here earlier this month, June 01 to 03, 2011. The location of the hotel was great, a couple of blocks away from the Empire State Building. The general area is quite safe and is also near a subway station which is helpful if your coming and going to JFK. Stayed in the 9th floor and did not encounter any noise from the renovation work being done. The room I stayed in was newly renovated and clean, though very small; thus if you have a couple of luggage on-hand, your world will definitely be a lot more smaller. one big drawback is NO INTERNET CONNECTION!!! You have to go to the lobby and pay-up around USD 13++ for a 24-hour connection...and that's per device...so its I had to choose, laptop or iPhone. I was told that the rooms in the second floor had internet connection in the rooms, but the floor had a lot of on-going renovation work, and will be noisy. There is also a nearby mini grocery to buy some bottled water or soda. Pros: 1. Location, location, location. 2. Helpful staff. 3. Safe and comfy. Cons: 1. No internet internet connection in the room. 2. No Business Center.

<Title>“Would definately come back”
<Content>We booked this hotel because it was the cheapest hotel in the area of the city we wanted to stay (cheap being a relative term for NYC). I loved it & would go back in a heart beat. My husband & I stayed in a double occupancy room which was very small. The size of the room was not an issue for us. The entire hotel is being redone & is almost finished. Everything in our room was brand new - the walls, the carpet, the tile, the bed clothes, the furniture, etc. - and designed quite tastefully & modern. My only complaints all deal with temperature. We couldn't find anything in our room that let us control the A.C. Were we able to control the A.C we probably would have kept the room about 5-10 degree's cooler. Also, it took the hot water int he bathroom to heat up. We learned this quickly so got in the habit of turning the water on about 5 minutes before we actually intended to get int the shower. Oh, and ome more downer - the room lacked some "norm's" like a fridge, microwave, & cups. Cups would have been nice. All in all, I would definately come back. The pillows were divine - :0)

<Title>“Modern, clean hotel. Great Value.”
<Content>This is a super clean, comfortable modern hotel. Almost ALL rooms in NYC are SMALL. Everywhere. Not just at this hotel. I've stayed at the Best Western in Times Square. The rooms there were tiny too. But not new and nice like these were. The remodeling is done. There are all new beds with down comforters, furniture, tv's, bathrooms, you can't get a better value for your money. I looked and looked. If you need space then pay $100 a night more and get a bigger room in another hotel. But this is NYC. You need a place to sleep and shower. And you will do it here in an all new, clean, comfortable room. You must read other reviews with an open mind. Most of the things they complain about were petty. If they don't apply to you then forget them. Keep in mind, this is a 'budget' hotel. Most people book it because of the price. If they really wanted luxury they would stay someplace else. See my pics and judge for yourself.

<Title>“Everything you need for a trip to New York.”
<Content>Stayed for two nights in early May - my second trip to New York in the space of five weeks. I was looking for an alternative to the disappointing Hudson Hotel. Although it is undergoing renovations at the moment, Thirty Thirty is clean, not noisy at night and the new rooms are small, but well equipped. Breakfast is good value in the restaurant next door. There's no bar in the hotel, but plenty in the neighbourhood, and the location's central too. Good value - I'll be back there for my next trip to New York.

<Title>“Friendly staff, nice room, great experience”
<Content>Having read a lot of reviews on here I was kinda worried about what to expect but seriously all of the negative stuff written here - I've experienced none of it at all during our 10-night stay. Check in went quite fast, our suitcases were taken upstairs to our room. The corridor (3rd floor) told us that they were renovating as yes, there was plastic one the floor and a slight smell of paint, but besides that, it didn't make our stay less convenient. the room was clean & clearly recently renovated. We got fresh towels every day, the room was made up every day and everything just looked and smelled fresh. The room was pretty small, yes, but hello you're in New York! If you want a spacious room you gotta book a room in one of those chain hotels, paying triple as much as we have done. Only small thing that kind of annoyed me was that the cleaners took our plastic water cups but always seemed to forget to replace them. Oh and it kind of surprised us there were on coffee/tea facilities. You'd think they would put those in after renovations. The road is quite noisy at night (we had a front room), but with some ear plugs you'll get a good nights sleep as the beds are really comfortable. We had a couple of questions throughout our stay and the staff at reception or the concierge were always helpful & friendly enough. Our card demagnetized once, but after a trip to reception we were back in the room in a flash. Our air conditioning didn't seem to turn off at all; trip to reception and a serviceman was up with us within 2 minutes! Check out was quick and easy and one member of staff called us a taxi and arranged for us to travel with to fellow Dutch women who were on the same flight. Are suitacases were stored for us as we had a late night flight. Location was perfect, quite a few subway stations nearby. A lot of attractions like the Empire State Building were within walking distance. And Penn Station and Grand Central were only a few blocks away as well. All in all a great stay.

<Title>“Not the best place in the city”
<Content>We checked into the hotel on May 29th. The staff were very cooperative about storing our bags until the room was ready. After a long day of trolling the Midtown section of NYC, my husband returned to the room first. I followed about 20 minutes after. When I opened the door to the room, I was greeted by the worst cigarette stench that I have ever encountered in a hotel. It was like a wall of smoke. I immediately returned to the reception desk and requested a change of room. They were very quick to agree to a room change. This room also smelled of smoke, but it was not as overpowering as our first room assignments. I was chastised because my husband took a shower in the first room and I was told that there was no housekeeping staff to reset the room, even though as we were departing the first room, a housekeeper was on her way into the room. Another note, we booked a standard queen and it was the smallest room we have ever been in. While the hotel is currently being refurbished, these rooms are very tiny. This room would be suitable for a single traveler, but not a couple. Thankfully, it was only for two days. The location of the hotel was very convenient, though. The evening desk staff was surly. I would not recommend booking a standard queen for more than one person. Also, one should be very tolerant of smoke smells as they permeate the mattresses in our rooms on the third and fourth floors. Overall, not a great experience and we will most likely not return.

<Content>Overall I was disappointed with my three night stay here. Although they offer the rooms at a 25% discount due to their current renovation, I wouldn't stay again. It's a 2.5 star at best. There is no doorman, no one to help with luggage, service at the font desk was poor and the rooms were tiny. I could barely fit between the wall and the bed & there was no where to store my luggage.They had also changed my reservation to a room that I didn't book - which I complained about upon checking in & the attendant 'magically' found me the room I had booked. I asked for a comment card upon checking out to leave feedback & they didn't have any. I did however write a letter to the manager and never heard back. The only positive of this hotel was the comfy bed!

<Title>“You Couldn't Pay Me To Stay Here Again”
<Content>This was my 4th time visiting NY City, this time I came with my 19 year old son, and two of my friends. I made my reservations on January 11, 2011 for a stay 5/20/11 thru 5/24/11. Due to travel changes, my son, who has never been to NYC was arriving several hours ahead of me, so I called the hotel before I left, to confirm my reservations for a double twin room, and that they would let my son check in without presenting a credit card, as they had all my info and would wait until I arrived to present the card, they reassured me that "everything is in order." NOT!!!! He got there and had to present his Visa debit card, which tied up his personal checking account funds, and instead of two twin beds, we were given a really bad room with a queen bed. When I got there and tried to straighten things out, they wouldn't let me remove my son's card as the guarantee card, and they could not change our accommodations....I booked this trip more than 4 months ago and can't understand how we couldn't get the accommodations I reserved....for our inconvenience, they agreed to not charge us for the first nite if we stayed with them for the duration and keep checking daily for new accommodations....which never happened....and they were kind enough to give us a fold out cot that was unbearable to sleep on (it was half the size of a twin bed) we ended up putting the mattress on the floor, which was very gross. But wait, it gets better....when we checked out and I went to pay the bill....guess what....nobody made notes on the account, and even though I had a signed itinerary by the supervisor the front desk person would not credit me for that first nite....said I had to call back at 0830 to speak with the supervisor....which I did and he never returned my calls....needless to say, I got very irate. I just spent 4 nites in a room without any ventilation, mold on the bathroom walls, a view of a brick wall, and carpet I wouldn't walk on without shoes, but had to throw a mattress on to sleep....and she couldn't honor the credit? I kept showing it to her....she kept asking me to describe the man who signed it....my reply was that I had seen thousands of people over the last few days, shouldn't you be able to recognize your supervisor's signature? She then proceeded to tell me how difficult I was making her life.....HUH??? Her's??? I am still waiting to hear from the supervisor....wonder if he will ever call? I travel A LOT....domestically, and internationally....this was by far the worst experience of all....even with the low expectations I had when I booked the room. I booked this inexpensive room so that I would have more money to spend on all the attractions NYC has to offer, so I wasn't expecting the Ritz, but I was expecting to get what I paid for.

<Title>“Perfect for the price! only one negative”
<Content>We went to the hotel thirty thirty from may 15th- 19th. We got to the hotel at 1030 and we thought that our room wouldn't be ready, which was fine. the front office said that they could get us in with an early check in. We got to our room and it was very small but extremely nice and renovated. the bed was amazing!!! The only complaint that I have is that we were there celebrating my girlfriends birthday and I called and let them know twice that it was her birthday and they said that they would make her feel at home. There was no treatment that made her birthday any more special. We didn't want an upgrade in our room just something nice like a happy birthday card or a flower or anything like that would have been nice. Other than that the hotel was great.

<Title>“Great location, great price, would highly recommend!”
<Content>Stayed at the Thirty Thirty for 4 nights in May 2011, check in was speedy and staff were extremely helpful. After reading some of the reviews on here I was slightly worried about staying here, however I would highly recommend and would definitely stay again. Yes the rooms were small, but you are in New York so this is to be expected, and how much time are you spending in the room anyway! We were staying on the 12th floor and it was extremely quiet, we didnt have a very good view from the room, but this didnt matter. Rooms, were cleaned thoroughly everyday, with fresh towels etc and the bed was very comfortable. The location of the hotel is great and is within walking distance of all the main attractions. Would also higly recommend the Crooked Knife restaurant over the road from the hotel, delicious food at great prices. If you are looking for a centrally located hotel, with great prices then you could do a lot worse than the Thirty Thirty!!!!

<Title>“Really cute hotel- but a lot of construction”
<Content>I really loved the hotel and even though the room is very small, it is great decor, and the location is even better. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. One thing to know now though, if you have a reservation on the third floor especially, there is a ton of construction which can not only be loud, but there is currently a lingering smell of paint that made me a little dizzy and sick when I was in the room. My colleague had a room on the opposite end of the hall and she didn't experience it as severely as I did. Also they do validate parking one block away for 30 dollars a night which is nice for that part of New York. Overall I would love the hotel once they are done!

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel,even with small room”
<Content>I booked this Hotel on the web,purely by chance,i am so glad i did.It was a wonderful experience.My bedroom though being a wee bit on the small side,their again,are`nt most hotel rooms in New York,the room could`nt have been any cleaner,the Bathroom was spotless,bright and good enough to eat your dinner of the floor,shower was excellent,but oh ,the bed linen was so crisp,clean,white,bed very comfortable,turned back every day.The room attendants,and housekeeping, manager were totally friendly,polite and chatty.Reception staff were totally welcoming,courteous,friendly in an Irish kind of way,and Robert,i hope that`s his name,as i have kind of forgotten,the Concierge,could not do enough for you if you asked for information,he gave me great information.I only stayed 3 nights,but i have absolutely no hesitation in saying i will give them 10 out of ten,and also its only a 10-15 minute walk to 5th avenue,take a rest in Madison Park on the way.Great location to most of most of what you want to do in NY.Oh by the way the staff love Cadbury`s Chocolate.I did`nt eat in the Hotel,but it has a lovely Restaurant and Bar.I would highly reccomend this Hotel,as when i will go back to NY,i will stay in it again,without any second thoughts.Pricewise it it expensive as all New York Hotels are in Comparison to Ireland and England,small rooms also compaired to what we are used to,but you are in NY after all.Go to it and enjoy it as i did,and i was a single traveller.

<Title>“Good location”
<Content>This hotel is greate value for money and in a great location between park and madison aveu, close to 5th for shopping, with loads of food places min from hotel, however central park was about a 20-30 min walk. The hotel had good customer service with vary helpful and friandly staff when wanting information about the local area or when needing a car to take you to the airport. The room was clean but vary small with a sigle wardrobe which might have been ok, but with only 4-5 hangers to hang your cloths was not good, there was 1 large window in the room but the room was still dark so had to keep the light on when in the room during the day, the room i was staying in did not have a view (as it was over looking the roof top). Although the hotel was great value for money and would be a good hotel for many people, I personlly will not be staying at the hotel when in new york.

<Title>“Beds like cement, radiators that wouldnâ€™t shut off”
<Content>The customer service was fine, as was the location. We had three main issues. 1. The bed was hard as a rock (The room was tiny but to be expected in NYC) 2. We asked for the heat to be turned down but they said it was not possible. The room was so hot we had to have our window wide open to be in the room. 3. The room service continually ignored our Do Not Disturb sign and came into our room. I have stayed at many hotels in NYC and while this was not the worst, it wasnâ€™t one of the best.

<Title>“Great Value For Money!”
<Content>Sam's welcome was really good. The bed was to die for...........so comfortable! The breakfast was great, far too much. We didn't expect a safe in the room. Of course the rooms are small, look at the location! The shower temperature was cool to tepid and the internet wasn't free...about $14.95 (only negatives here). Great location for sightseeing, shopping etc. I would recommend this hotel. We even went back for dinner!

<Title>“Terrible Experience!”
<Content>As I was travelling with my 75year old mother we had booked a twin room, when we arrived we were 'upgraded' to a 1 bedroom & living area with a couch, I was told sleep on couch or a roller bed could be brought in! Corridor carpets were covered in plastic which made a noise when walked on, builders were in rooms with doors open sawing, drilling & creating dust that got everywhere. I spoke to another guest who was being moved to another hotel & was told by woman receptionist that I had spoilt that guests experience of the hotel. I asked to speak to the manager at this point & was told that she was the manager. We decided to find another hotel that was not a building site, could accomodate our needs & allow us to speak to other guests! The two reception staff we spoke to were unhelpful, churlish & belligerent not the customer service we were told to expect in New York. The bell boy was the most helpful pleasant person we could find at this hotel & we wish him luck.

<Title>“Excellent customer service, comfortable beds”
<Content>I stayed at the Thirty Thirty hotel for two nights this past month and was surprised with the great level of customer service. Upon arrival, I waited in line for 10 minutes, and they upgraded my room because of the wait. The rooms were a nice size and the beds were very comfortable. The staff had great recommendations for bars in the area and saved me money on parking (they offer a discount!) They are still undergoing renovations until the Fall, but I would recommend this hotel to my friends.

<Title>“Great hotel, great staff and location - shame about the renovations!”
<Content>My mum and I stayed at Thirty Thirty Hotel 2 weeks ago. Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist, however we were allocated a double room even though we had asked for twin beds. We returned back to reception where she was very apologetic and sorted a room out for us on the 9th floor (which was a twin!). The room itself was lovely and had just been renovated - the bathroom was huge! However a design flaw meant that you had to put a towel on the floor right by the shower otherwise it would flood the bathroom. The screen is not long enough. The bed were very comfy and the room itself was small but large enough to move around it and drop off shopping. The in-room safe was very handy, and meant we could lock away valuables without worrying. Plenty of lovely soft towels in the bathroom, however we did run out of toilet roll twice as the roll was never replaced, we had to go down to reception to ask for some. The only major downside was that the room right next to us was being renovated - resulting in being woken up by the contactors around approximately 8.00am - 8.30 am each day (apart from Saturday when they were not there). We did not feel the need to complain as we were up and about by then anyway, but if we had wanted a lazy day this would have been very annoying as they were loud. There was plastic sheeting covering the floor and lots of plaster everywhere, so we tried to avoid walking round the room in our shoes. Having said this, the workers were always gone by the time we got back to the hotel in the evening so we could sleep. The location of the hotel was ideal - only 2 blocks to the nearest subway and right close to the flatiron building and the empire state building. There is a great japanese supermarket on the corner of 28th St and Park Ave which we visited many times for water and great fresh snacks. The pizza kitchen on the corner of 30th St and Park Ave is also mega tasty. Our favourite place for breakfast quickly became Tasty's one block west - their pancakes are so good!! The hotel is in a brilliant location which we could not fault. The conceirge was very helpful and organised transport back to the airport very quickly and efficiently. We were able to use the Internet for a small fee (min $2.00) to check in online the night before we left. We were also able to store our luggage for free once we had checked out as our flight was not until the evening. All of the staff were very friendly and let me use my phonecard downstairs on their phone to call my partner who had been takento hospital in the UK as it did not work in our room. We bought different cards which did work in the rooms, and we were not charged for use of their phone which was great. Overall, we had an amazing time in New York and our hotel played a big part in this! Would definately go back, and hope the renovations are over by then!

<Title>“Decent location, very small rooms!”
<Content>We booked the family suite online directly with the hotel. When I checked in, I was told we had reserved a standard room. I insisted we had the family suite. I then asked how many beds in the standard room, one queen. Four people sleeping in a queen for several nights isn't going to work. Thank God for confirmation e-mails! The girls let me pull up my e-mail confirming my room! They then gave me 2 std rooms for the price of the family suite. Zana is great for breakfast. No coffeemaker in the room, but 2 coffees to go @ Zana will run you $5.50. Concierge was very helpful with reservations and general information. The family suites are under complete construction, so call the hotel before booking!!

<Title>“No way as bad as recent reviews suggest.”
<Content>I have just stayed at this hotel for two days and don't agree with the recent reviews although we had a few niggles too. The check in was efficient and professional with two out of the three in our group being upgraded by the young lady that served us. The rooms were clean and tidy. We did get woken up early one morning by the contractors but the hotel staff were apologetic and made an effort to compensate us with a reduction on the room rates and a complimentary breakfast. The staff explained that they had asked the contractors not to start work until 9AM but that the contractors just ignore the hotel staff (I suggest the Hotel Management get a bit tougher with them). One or two of the staff were a bit rude but I think that's typical of New York in my experience.

<Title>“Still just adequate though renovated”
<Content>For my fourth and final stay at Thirty Thirty I was given a newly-renovated room. It was pretty odd. Previously I had stayed in rooms with queen beds and the size of the rooms ranged from small to astonishingly small. This room was actually fairly large but had only a single bed. What was really odd is that it's a day bed and it was not particularly comfortable. The bathroom was very stylish but the shower stall does not close all the way and water gets all over the bathroom when you take a shower. It was nice to finally have a room with a desk and a chair. Previously the televisions were tiny but the new room had a huge flat screen. No coffeemaker, though. I am not sure if they decided not to have them anymore, or if this was an omission of some sort. The room did have a sort of unfinished air about it. Still fine if all you need is a place to sleep, though the bed was less comfortable than in the pre-renovation rooms.

<Title>“Sorry but the bad reviews are right... stay away...”
<Content>I visited New York on the 1st April. Having read the reviews on trip advisor was concerned and informed Virgin of the bad reviews on here. Virgin were very professional and said they wanted me to go to the hotel and see for myself before being moved... Please see hotel metro for brilliant hotel to stay at when visiting New York. Back to the thirty thirty.. on arrival was not greated by ay conceirge although they seem to boast about there brilliant customer service. On being greated by receptionist I found her to be very cold and unfriendly, The Reception lobby because of the refurbushmets had yellow tape over parts of it being decorated not very welcoming. Carpets are covered in plaster etc from the builders. The manager was informed of my concerns before arriving so you would expect good service? The room we were given had a flashing light the smallest bathroom i have ever seen and 1 queen size bed. Despite being informed that we needed twin beds.. Please dont ruin you chance to see this fantastic city by coming here. We were much more comfortable with th Hotel Metrol. Pay a little more and stay somewhere nicer,,,

<Title>“great hotel”
<Content>We had to stay there for three days , we stayed on the 8th floor , it was a very nice room and very clean too bad in the morning around 8am, it was so noisy outside from the contractions workers that came to renovated one of the room by the end of the hall, they were yelling and doing the working at the same time , i was so pissed about that because come on now we were on vacation. The night staffs are very nice and helpful , except the morning staffs , at the front desk are ignorant should be fired esp the girl with the long black hair. the man and the doorman at the door in the morning and night are very nice and helpful. It is a very modern hotel with a really good deal , very decent size for a room hotel in new york city , and a trendy bathroom, they cleaned our room everyday . Great location to go to times square , macy's or etc. Will come back to this hotel again.

<Title>“Staff just don't care!”
<Content>I stayed at the thirty thirty in 2005 and it was fine. However I returned in March 2011 and could not believe how rude and ignorant the reception staff are. The night staff are great. And the guys who store our luggage etc were really nice. BUT, the day reception staff were unbelievably rude and unhelpful. We had several issues during our stay. The room they put us in (supposedly an upgrade) was nice enough but within two minutes of unpacking we could hear very loud drilling from the room above. This continued for a while and we went downstairs to complain. The woman on reception did not seem at all surprised (given the previous reviews this is obviously an onging issue which the hotel forgets to mention!). She said there were no other rooms available until the next day. No apology just a rude response. This was a very special holiday for us and my boyfriend had requested by email that a bottle of champaigne be in our room on our arrival as a surprise for me. Despite this being confirmed via emial there was no champaige. When I asked about this, again there was no apology and a different woman on reception even questioned if we had made the request in the first place. Basically calling us liars as we could not remember the person who had confirmed the request. This however is the email my boyfriend received to confirm that his request for a bottle of champaigne was received. "Hello, Your reservation is confirmed for arrival 22nd March and departure 27th March for a Superior Queen Room. A special request is made on your reservation to make your stay a memorable one. We look forward to having you stay with us. H O T E L 3 0 3 0 Reservation Department 30 East 30th Street I New York I NY I 10016 W. 800. 804.4480 F. 212.651.3883 www.thirtythirty-nyc.com" Unfortunately we did not have a copy of this to show the woman on reception and were therefore basically called liars! It was a real shame as it was something my boyfriend had planned as a surprise. Although they really didn't care about that! New York is an amazing and memorable city, please do not spoil your stay in this great city by booking to stay at this terrible hotel. The day staff on reception just do not care about residents enjoying their stay, they are rude and clearly have a lot of complaints!

<Title>“WORST SERVICE EVER!”
<Content>I just walked in to the hotel to make a reservation for next week. The girl behind the counter had zero personalilty and zero customer service skills. It's a hotel, I'd like to reserve a room for next week. She acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Then informed me I could make a reservation online and gave me a card with their website information. Hello, I'm in the hotel, why can't I reserve a room now? She told me I could and would hand me the hotel phone to do so ... WTH!?! What is your job exactly?? Then I said I would be bringing my dog with me and if that would be noted with an online reservation. She said they didn't allow pets. I said their website clearly says they do: "Pet Friendly Policy: Hotel Thirty-Thirty is proud to be a New York City Pet Friendly Hotel. There is a $100 deposit per room that is refundable upon check out." Another girl behind the counter said the hotel changed their pet policy starting today. Really, Thursday, March 24th, 2011 no pets?!! I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Title>“RUDE IGNORANT STAFF”
<Content>We arrived at the Hotel on 13March. Having booked 2 rooms for the family On 14th March, the day after arrival, Reception told two of our party that they had to move from the 5th floor as it was being renovated, but no room was ready for them to move to...so they packed up and waited for another room. One of our party left something in the room and asked reception could she get it, the girl at reception told her that someone else had checked into the room that afternoon...Even though we were told the WHOLE FLOOR was going under renovations We (on the 6th Floor) were woken up on the 15th March at 7.50am by hammers and loud noise outside our door. They were now Renovating the 6th Floor and had began the process with us still on that floor. The hallway was torn apart, carpets taken up,rooms empty, dust and builders everywhere. NO ONE bothered to notify us that this was happening on the 6th Floor Also! We went to reception and then we were moved, again we had to wait for a room to be ready. We were moved from the 6th floor to the 4th Floor where we could still hear all the building noise through the rest of our stay I can safely say that if I knew this was going on we would have changed hotels and had a more comfortable trip. It was also quiet embarrassing in the fact that I recommended this Hotel for the family trip!! We spoke to the Supervisor, Cathia, she was pretty ignorant and dismissive ... I work in the Travel Business and i can assure you I WILL NEVER EVER book any of my clients into this hotel. Even though it will be a nice LOOKING hotel when its finished there is no atmosphere here, the staff are among the rudest i have met in the WORLD but they really have only followed the lead from their ignorant management Do yourself a favour and DO NOT STAY HERE. Pay a little extra and stay somewhere better. Let me Recommend the Wellington Hotel or the New Yorker Older but much better atmosphere and fantastic Staff

<Title>“Never Ever Again!!”
<Content>I always try to put a few good points first in a review - the only 1 I can think about was when we left. This was without a doubt the worst hotel I have every stayed in! My recomendation to you is stay anywhere else, I would think a hostel would be better than here. A few of the negatives - reception staff rude and abusive, I booked a non smoking twin and got a smoking double which was 1 of the old staff rooms with a tatty kitchenette, toilet flush on its own every 5 mins, cracked and stained shower, the cleaner had passed out ouside her room and thrown up due to her being drunk (what a welcome home!) had to bribe the reception staff to book us a taxi to the airport, no NYC knowledge at the conceirge desk, had to pay them to look after our suitcases on the last day. Lukily we only stayed in the hotel for a very short amount of time but I wanted to warn other people never to stay here no mater how cheap you get it.

<Title>“Incompetence”
<Content>I was booked into the 30 30 forthe night of Tuesday March 15th . When I arrived at approximately 4:00 PM, I was informed that they were overbooked and referred me to th Milford Plaza near Times Square. As it wq over 20 blocks away yje clerk provided me with a $10 bill from petty cash for a cab. Unfortunately It proved almost impossible to get a cab at that hour and 4 with lights on bypassed me. When I finally arrived at the Milford Plaza, the fare was &10.80 which I paid. The Milford was a total disaster which I shall cober in a separate review, It was filthy and packed with pot smoking kids . I would rate it One star above the Hotel Pennsylvania. The room was as bare as a prison cell. To read < the only comfortable seat and adequate light were sittin on the WC and the WC hada continuous leak with an inch of water on the floor. I did NOT have a good experience. I regard the staff at 30-30 as incompetent and the staff at Milford as even worse.

<Title>“Great location, great service, great stay!”
<Content>We booked online and it seemed too cheap to be true (840 dollars for 6 nights in NY)! When we arrived we found that the hotel had been renovated and was in fact more beautiful than it's website suggests. Our room was big by any standard -even though it was in the back- and huge by NY standards. My father-in-law was originally given a tiny single but staff were lovely and transfered him to a standard room the second day - much smaller than hours but in the front! The service was great - rooms were cleaned everyday, staff were very polite and helpfull- and the location was just perfect for NY, central, close to many tourist attractions and Times Square and a very very short walk from two subway stations. Will definitely return if we can get as good a deal as we did this time. Great value for money.

<Title>“never paid so much for so little, not in Paris, London, San Francisco - anywhere.”
<Content>I stayed here based on the largely positive reviews on this page. I greatly regretted the decision. The largely negative reviews on Yelp are far closer to the truth. This is an awful hotel. Although the location is fabulous, the rooms are exceedingly tiny and unattractive, and the service is so deplorable it is insulting. Do your pocket-book and your self-respect a favor and stay elsewhere.

<Title>“Great Hotel Will Be Back Again”
<Content>This was the first time to NYC. The hotel is in a good spot, not too near the noise and crowds but not too far either, you can walk in to Times Square in 20 mins. The empire State Building in only a few blocks away and so is Macys. The staff are very helpful ans as for the Manager Steve he is the best!!!! Thanks for a great stay Hotel 30 30. We will be back again one day.

<Title>“Good location, good value”
<Content>In short: a good value hotel (compared to other Manhatten hotels at least) located in the middle of most things you would want to see in New York. Main gripe: being charged for the internet ($14 a day - this is not a small fee as claimed by the website!). It also didn't help that the internet once purchased was very slow. Pros: -helpful staff -location -value -spacious room, good bathroom -good bar opposite Cons: -loud air conditioning/heating -hot water not quite hot enough -had to pay $14 a day for slow internet

<Title>“wouldn't stay here again”
<Content>Having stayed at 30 30 in 2002 we persuaded friends who wanted to stay in Times Square to stay here as we liked it so much last time. We were so disappointed - stayed for 5 nights and our room was not serviced for 2 of them. The room is very small and dark and bed was small. Sure there are better places to stay for the same money.

<Title>“Great simple hotel in the heart of the city”
<Content>Booked with Virgin on a special deal. Its a clean simple hotel, minimal frills but you dont go to NYC to stay in the hotel. Check in was prompt and efficient. The room was an Ok size with a decent bathroom. All very clean with maid service daily. This hotel has a great location to tour the city. Its near a couple of subway lines which was a great way to get around. Only a few blocks from the empire state and Macys. Its possible to walk up to central park from the hotel. There is a lovely little shop/cafe/deli across the road that does good breakfast for a very reasonable price.

<Title>“there are much better, cheaper hotels in New York compared to this one”
<Content>Grey concrete tiled and low lit decor in reception reflect the personalities of the reception staff who seem to know little or nothing of the city/ area they are in. Rooms are tiny with a sink in the bedroom and tiny shower with loo in the "ensuite". Carpets are filthy and there is enough mould on the shower sealent to start a new planet. The windows are paper thin (as are the walls) so little or no sleep is guaranteed. The heating of the rooms is hit or miss so if you do choose to stay here best come prepared. It's very expensive compared to higher spec hotels and should only be listed as 2 star rating at best. Oh, and don't be fooled by it having a gym as this is 3 blocks walk away!!!

<Title>“Thank you 30.30!”
<Content>We arrived early on a Sunday hoping that we'd be able to check-in ahead of the scheduled time. But due to the impending snowstorm they'd had more rooms to clean than to check-in to, so we checked our luggage into the storage room and went out to explore the city. The hotel is located in between Park & Madison on E 30th, 2-5 blocks from the subway, 3 blocks from the Empire State Bldg., and close to lots of other conveniences. The hotel staff is super nice and accommodated our wait with an upgrade to a king suite! The room was nice and had a fully tiled charcoal slate bathroom, but no microwave or fridge. Right across the street is a really cute spot, Wine:30. The service is great and they have a great variety of wines. We stopped there a couple times and never wanted to leave! We had a great trip and Thirty Thirty is part of the reason!

<Title>“Very happy for the money we spent.”
<Content>I stayed here with my girlfriend in the week running up to Christmas. We enjoyed ourselves. The rooms are definitely small, but we found we didn't spend much time in the room. The TV is very old fashioned. The hotel is tidy, the rooms were kept clean by the housekeeping staff. Staff were friendly and helpful. It was a good base from which to explore New York The bed is very very hard, but that suits me! For the money that we spent, I left feeling happy with the hotel. The location is good and I would recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Not for us - 2 star hotel at 3 star prices”
<Content>We stayed here for three nights and started looking to stay elsewhere on our first night. Our room was extremely small. It faced the street so was very noisy all night and at 5 am when the binmen come daily. It was a clean room and even though like most people who go to New York they don't spend much time in their rooms I found that my husband and I were tripping over each other and things when we were in at night - and we are both small people! What I didn't like was that the basin was right next to the bed with the shower and toilet separate. There were no facilities to hang your wet bath towels in the shower room and no where to put your face towels by the basin so you had to put everything on the floor to be taken by the maids every day to be washed and have fresh towels daily. The price we paid was Â£125 per nights so it was probably average for Manhattan but I would probably call this a 2 star instead of 3. There is no free internet. They have 3/4 terminals in the lobby which you feed in $1 notes continuously ($1 buys you 4 mins internet time). We found a different hotel in the end that was cheaper and a lot nicer and moved.

<Title>“Amazing price, great location, very nice room”
<Content>For the money, I was amazed at what a great place this was. The room was very clean, fashionable enough, small-ish but not tiny. Great location, an easy walk from the cheap bus pickup/drop-off spots. The only hiccup was checking in. They were having computer problems, so I waited longer than I would've liked. Maybe 15 min. But they bumped me up a room grade, so that made it all better. Overall, I expected much less than I got. An excellent deal.

<Content>We spent 7 days at the hotel 3030 and it was the best trip thanks to the staff! They helped us with our directions and were always willing to spend a few moments with us everday. They got to be like "our family" after awhile! The location was perfect for our visiting and the bar they have was wonderfully peaceful to end our day in. Thanks so much for all of your help and hospitality! Next visit to NY we will for sure stay again at the 3030!

<Content>I stayed at this hotel for one night Jan 5, I booked a superior guest room through the website for a really good price... when i got there, they gave us an upgrade to a junior suite for free! The room was nice, it was on a higher floor, rly quiet and clean.. the only thing was the bed, it wasn't really comfortable, but the overall experience was absolutely positive! Very friendly staff, great location, lots of places to eat around there.. I would recommend it!

<Title>“Excellent central location, nice hotel - recommended”
<Content>Having read the reviews previous to the trip i felt well informed. We arrived early and the room was not ready. Not a problem we checked in our luggage and hit the city. The location is very near The Empire State, Grand Central Station (the lower level food hall is a must) and the lovely Chrysler Building, its also close to 33st Metro station. We ate a lovely breakfast at the Pershing Square, situated on Park Ave opposite Grand Central Station, its under the bridge and is tradional inside, only a 5 min easy stroll from the hotel. We had a large healthy breakfast for $14 and this kept us going for a good part of the day. From there it was easy to jump on the metro and head either south or noth. A must is an evening trip to the revolving restaurant / bar at the top of The Marriot Hotel in Times Square, It opens around 5:30pm and takes around an hour to complete its circuit. Lovely to sip a cocktail and watch the world go by. We visited the Theatre's themselves for our tickets and ended up with a real bargain, and less commisions to pay to the touts. The Crooked Knife across the road was a great way to finish off a busy day - margarita's at $4 you couldnt go wrong! AND not far to stroll home. The Staten Island ferry is free and frequently crosses, from there you can get a view of the Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty, but it does not land at either SOL or Ellis Island, but well worth the trip if you are short on time or the queues are long for the other ferry. We didnt eat at the hotel, we used it purely as a base. It was clean and beds were very comforatable. We had a the family room which was large. The only gripe was we couldnt adjust the heating. Bathroom was modern and had a nice shower. Complementry safe if your room is good but was not fixed into anything - so was portable! I would be happy to stay at this hotel again and recommend it. Free wifi would be a huge help to the tourist and seems odd that they dont do that. $2 for 2 mins is available on the lobby computer which is ideal to check in for your flight home and the print it thrown in for that as well.

<Title>“You get what you pay for -- I'd stay here again!”
<Content>After staying at a fancy hotel the night before (on my company's dime), it was pretty tough to adust downward, lol. But this is the kind of property I seek out when traveling alone or with my family -- good location, fair price, not too fancy. And that's what you get at the Thirty Thirty. It's solid. Was very happy to see the 6 train is only 1 block East -- that made getting around so convenient! Straight up to 86th St. stop for the Met, woot! Lobby is cavernous and chic. Check-in was smooth and unremarkable. Room was predictably small and bare-bones, but it met my needs. I really don't see why they won't spend an extra few bucks per room to add some art over the bed or get a nicer window-covering ... I had an dingy, old-school vinyl shade that refused to roll back up after I pulled it down for privacy. Ah well, street view was nothing to write home about. Tiled bathroom was clean, towels were soft (not scratchy, yay!) water was nice and hot with good pressure. Who gives a rip if the sink is outside the bathroom? Not me. And yes, I could hear street noise, so I picked up some earplugs at a nearby drusgtore. BRING YOUR OWN if you think you'll want or need them -- earplugs are $$$$ in NYC! Couldn't find any for less than $6; would cost $2 at home. Grrr. Thrilled to see Cosi one block away on the East Side of Park Ave. For the uninitiated, Cosi is a great little chain joint that makes fantastic sandwiches, salads, soups, pizzas and breakfast stuff. I miss Cosi so much, so when I come to NYC or Philly, I eat there as much as possible. And it's cheap too! Breakfast including coffee for about $6 and lunch would top out at $15 (my yummy soup/salad combo was $11). The only issue I had was that the front desk/concierge refused to print my boarding pass, which IMO is a bit ridiculous. Their 'business center' with computers and printers charges a per-minute fee -- how much you wanna bet Web access would be slow as molasses? I was in a bind amid the blizzard paranoia and desperately trying to make my flight on time, and it irked me that printing boarding passes isn't considered common courtesy these days. It takes only a few minutes. But I guess with a cheapie hotel, it's to be expected. I got a January special (30% off) so I paid about $150 including taxes for the night for a standard room with one queen bed. I'd stay here again, but I'd try to get an even lower rate if possible.

<Content>I went to NYC to visit some friends and do a little shopping. I picked the hotel based on location and price, the staff were friendly and helpful, service was fast and the room clean and pleasant. The only downside was the sound of the traffic made it hard to drift off to sleep for the first few days other than that, for the money you can't really go wrong.

<Title>“Would do it again for the price.”
<Content>TRAVEL TO AND FROM LGA On our way there, we took a shuttle to Grand Central Station which cost us just under $20 each, and waiting at Grand Central was another shuttle that took us directly to our hotel for free. On our way to LGA we took GoAirLink which was over $20 each, but took us directly to the airport without much hassle. AREA: We were close to 2 subway stations and 5th Avenue/Madison avenue which were nice to walk down. Also, there is an expensive restaurant right next door and directly connected to the hotel which offered breakfast from 7am. Many convenience stores to pickup water from. As we were told we probably shouldn't drink the water from the hotelâ€¦ which isn't the first time in our travels that this has happened. STAFF/AMENITIES: Everyone was very friendly and helpful! The hotel has 5 computers with printers for use. The fee is 25 cents per minute. ROOM: We booked a Superior Room (2 nights with taxes and everything came out to $300) which housed a comfy Queen bed, 2 chairs and a closet/drawer combo. The washroom was large and stone-tiled (it was nice). The bathroom also included a medicine cabinet which allowed me to store my items. The room itself was clean and, coming from Toronto, it was standard hotel size. The room had a CD player and the TV had a â€œcomputer inputâ€� if your laptop has an output of course. If I was going to say that anything was lacking was that I wish they had a movie channel to order from and a mini-fridge. What the rooms do not offer is protection from sound! We could hear people stomping around upstairs, and we could hear the people very easily from the hall. CONCLUSION I got the impression that the hotel tries its hardest to provide good customer service and even though there are certain structural disadvantages (i.e., iffy drinking water quality and sound), they make up for it with the larger rooms and other details.

<Title>“Okay for a one-night stay. Could use some improved smoking regulations.”
<Content>We booked this hotel on a great deal through Priceline, and after looking at some of the more negative reviews, we weren't sure what to expect. Initially, we were pleasantly surprised with the room (a standard guest room). It seemed clean, spacious enough (we're former New Yorkers-- the bathroom was huge!), and the fixtures were more updated than the picture on the website would indicate. However, when we came back for the evening, the room reeked of smoke. We definitely would have asked to move if we were staying more than one day, and I believe they would have accommodated us. I'm not sure if they have non-smoking floors or just non-smoking rooms -- clearly, someone nearby was smoking-- but I can't seem to recall any signs indicating that our room was non-smoking. I know the hotel can't necessarily be blamed for other guests' behavior, but perhaps some more stringent policies (signs or bigger signs in rooms/floors) would be helpful in enforcing this. The other deal-breaker for me was that the bed was, as the cliche goes, hard as a rock. I tossed and turned all night. (I'm in my early twenties and really not a picky person with regard to firmness, but this was just not comfortable). Upon checkout, staff was extremely friendly and seemed genuinely disappointed that our stay wasn't what we expected, so perhaps they will be open to improvements in the future. If you're looking for an affordable place to crash for a night or two, Hotel 3030 should be just fine, but don't expect to get the most amazing sleep of your life or to have a completely smoke-free environment.

<Title>“Not very impressed”
<Content>Booked this hotel through Priceline on a recent trip to New York. Fortunately the trip was quick and I spent very little time in the hotel. The "Motel 6" style hotel is located on one of the quieter streets in midtown with good access to the subway and not too far from Penn Station. The lobby is unimpressive. I was kindly offered an "upgraded room" on the second floor when a room on an upper floor was not available. The room was a reasonable size. Two double beds were second rate and the couch (pull-out) had seen better days. A tiny add-on closet wasn't long enough for overcoat and would certainly not be large enough for multiple occupants. There are certainly far more comfortable places in the city at the star-level listed.

<Title>“Excellent location and a great start to our honeymoon!”
<Content>We were booked into Thirty Thirty on the advice of our travel agent and without having seen tripadvisor ... so having subsequently read up on the mixed reviews we were holding our breath a little - but need't have worried. Knowing we were on our honeymoon they upgraded us to a frankly huge room upon arrival, probably a little bit in recompense for not having the flowers and champagne I had asked for ready. Otherwise they were very friendly and helpful - the doorman even managed to get us a limo ride to the airport when we left. The location was spot on - we were able to walk to most areas and the subway was very handy. The room was a little tired - but did I mention how large ours was! There is no restaurant or bar and we tried a variety of local cafes and bars - we found The Crooked Knife opposite to be lively and well priced. All in all, I'd very happily go back again.

<Title>“A truly unforgettable and magical trip for our first experience in New York”
<Content>Myself and my family stayed at this hotel to see in 2011.I already had read the reviews from tripadvisor about this hotel before booking,so knew it had a good reputation before arriving.On arrival we were met by Vicki,a lady who was very pleasant and helpfull.On the other hand however the concierge and most of the reception staff were not,and we had to work most of everything we asked them out for ourselves.We stayed in a Quad standard room which had plenty of space with an extra room on the bedroom.The bathroom was very clean and all tiled with a large walk in shower.The room was comfortable and accomodated the four of us very comfortably.Not much of a view but like others below have said,you really are in your room just to sleep and wake up in.Most of the days we had breakfast at a small deli around the corner called 'Tasty'.The food was tasty and it was very clean with friendly staff this set us up for the days venturing out into the city. We got a 7 day pass for the underground and local buses from the subway just around the corner on 28th street.We payed $30 each for this but was well worth every penny as we used the underground every day to see all sights we wanted to,very quick and easy to use to get around the city. Eating out at night is the only difficuly i would say,if your not sure where to eat,restaurants are few and fairly far between, although one night we went next door to the hotel where there is a restaurante, you get 15% off every main meal if you are a guest at Thirt Thirty,this is great for the first night to sit and get your barings.Lovely food and friendly staff. We did most of all the sightseeing we wanted to in our 5 day stay here along with the tour around central park.Originally we wanted a traditional carriage ride but instead had a park ride from one of the guys who rides on a bike and takes you around the park,this was cheaper and gave you an hour with a tour of where all the celebrities live which is far more interesting.The horse and carriage ride is $75 and is only 15 mins long!this was an eye opener when we found out. We saw Times Square on New Years Eve but came away at about 4pm,crowds of people were over whelming and suffercating to say the least even at this time.Some people stood their for 13 hours and you phisically cannot move.It is unpleasant and you cant see anything due to the sea of people infront of you. Overall it was a fantastic trip and i will be going back for sure.

<Title>“Good hotel, good location, good price.”
<Content>Before booking this hotel I was a bit worried as had seen some reviews that were less than favourable, however a colleague had stayed here before and said it was a really good hotel and location. I didnâ€™t have any issue with the hotel at all and actually found the rooms to be really nice. I loved the bathroom in our room, really large walk in shower and decorated really well. I think we had a slightly larger than standard room as we did have a separate section with desk space so for rooms in New York it is probably bigger than I was expecting. We didnâ€™t really have a view from the room, however as there is so much to see in New York itself why would you want to sit in your room looking out of the window? My experience with the staff/reception was very good and the rates we found on line were very competitive. As it is quite a large hotel you donâ€™t get the same kind of service in the smaller boutique hotels but on the whole we had a pleasant stay.

<Title>“Good choice for visiting New York on a medium budget”
<Content>My wife and I spent four days visiting the Big Apple just before Christmas. We knew that the city would likely be at its busiest with just one week left to Christmas. We chose this hotel for its location (in the heart of Manhattan only three blocks from Penn Station between Park and M adison) and a very reasonable price. Although the rooms are rather small , they offer everything that one would need. The rooms were clean and there was usually plenty of free coffee to brew a cup when you needed it In addition we appreciated the helpful hotel staff at the reception. There is a restaurant which is accessible from the hotel entrance but seems to be separate fro m the hotel. We had coupons for an "American Breakfast" which was included in the accomodation price. Unfortunately there was little choice among the food items we could chose for the breakfast covered by the coupon. the coupon and we certainly did not appreciate receiving a bill that only specified "tip US $ 4" after we had already given a generous tip on the day before.

<Content>We stayed for 1 week this Xmas and had a fantastic time. The hotel is perfectly located in Midtown so everything is very accesible (shopping at Macy's, Empire State Building etc). The hotel was by far the cheapest for the area and had a 20's feel about it. The staff made us feel really welcome. Nothing was too much trouble and my husband and I felt spolied rotten! The room was really comfortable and the bathroom was huge. I would highly recommend!

<Content>Never having been to New York we took a chance on staying at Thirty Thirty based on the price and location and were really pleased with what we found. All of the staff at the hotel were very friendly, professional and helpful. The hotel was spotlessly clean and we were very pleased with our room. The location is near to the subway, about 5 minutes walk to Empire State Building, 10 minutes walk to Macys and about 20 minutes to Times Square so ideal for people who want to see the sights.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel”
<Content>We travelled to New York to celebrate my fiance's 30th birthday. We booked through Thomas Cook which we would never do again as they did not send the hotel our reservation (and it took them two days to sort it)!! The hotel staff went out of their way to sort the problem and gave us a room anyway. On the day of his birthday they sent flowers to the room and gave us complimentary breakfast which was lovely. All the staff were friendly and helpful and couldn't do enough for you. The hairdryer in the bathroom didn't work properly so I told the reception but wasn't expecting much to be done about it. The maintanence guy came straight away and replaced it with a brand new one. Our trip to New York and the hotel were amazing and we can't wait to go again.

<Title>“Central location, great staff”
<Content>My last stay (of many) at the 30/30 was brief, but made pleasant by professional employees, particularly Alya, the front desk agent. She couldn't find my reservation which certainly makes one nervous - but made a couple of phone calls and figured out they had spelled my name incorrectly. She apologized at length (not a big deal to me, as long as I had the res!) and put me in a great room. With respect to rooms - there are LOTs of different configurations - but all are clean and comfortable. Rooms are a little dark, so request one with a window that gets light (some windows face a very close brick wall). They don't slip your final bill under the door, so plan on a little extra time at check out if you want to walk away with the final bill in hand. The restaurant attached to the hotel isn't owned by the hotel, so no room charges and a $5.00 deposit if you want to take that wine glass back to your room, but good food and pleasant staff. There was a $13.95 'internet billing' fee on my final bill - no clue what that's for - you might want to check yours. All-in-all, a great place for both business and leisure travel.

<Title>“An extraordinary hotel with EXTRAordinary staff!!!!!! Five stars!”
<Content>We were greeted by very friendly staff who accomodated us, as we needed a larger room due to my husbands disability. They did this with no problem. And when we got to our room, they had flowers there for our honeymoon. Vicky went out of her way to make sure we were happy. The room was absolutely wondeful as was the concierge. He answered any questions we had. Also, the bellman went out of his way to help us get a taxi, as far as going up to the next block to see if he could find one. Our room was very clean, our service was impecable. Diana was wonderful and if we needed anything, she was quick to get it. The staff was extremely friendly and kind. The restaurant next to the hotel was great as well. The staff at hotel thirty thirty made our honeymoon more memorable and for this we thank you!! Kathleen and Alan

<Title>“Good Location For The Price”
<Content>Can't beat the price for Manhattan, but you get what you pay for. They spent all their money on the common areas and not refurbishing the rooms. If you are looking for a low cost option in the city with rooms that are a bit outdated, this is a good choice.

<Title>“The Good, The Bad and The Ugly”
<Content>The Good: The location. Close to subway stations. A couple of restaurants and a Starbucks are just around the corner. Sam and Carlos were the two employees who were nice and went out of their way to help out when problems arose. The Bad: 3 out of 4 nights we did not have hot (only lukewarm) water when it came time to shower. We had to call down and complain every night. We were told that it would be fixed "in a few minutes" which turned into at least an hour. The hotel was also kept an an extremely warm temperature. Luckily, we could open our windows and let some fresh, cool air in. One day we left very early (6:30 am), when we returned at 2:00 pm, housekeeping had still not visited our room. We mentioned this on our way out at 5:30 pm. When we returned at 9:30 pm, housekeeping had still not been there. We called down and they sent Carlos up to our room with an armful of clean (?) towels. The Ugly: This hotel has permanent residents--69 is what we were told. Our floor--the 10th--always smelled of smoke. It was a constant. Again, the only reason we survived was that we could crack our windows and get fresh air. It was so awful in the evenings. I felt as though I was stepping into an ashtray every time we returned from an outing and walked into the dank, stinky smell of cigarette smoke. Disgusting. On one occasion, when we once again had no hotwater, we asked to speak to the Manager. We were told he was off for the holiday. We asked to speak to the manager on duty and we were told there was no manager on duty. We asked to speak to whomever was in charge and we were told that no one was. Hey...who is running this place?

<Title>“Clean, good location, helpful staff, big room, good value”
<Content>I booked quite last minute and was recommended thirty thirty by a friend. It turned out to be one of the only available hotels in my price range when I booked and we were very pleased with our booking. The room was spacious with a comfortable and clean double bed, tea making facilities and a large standalone TV. There was a separate shower room (excellent shower) and a dresser. I was surprised at the amount of space as I had heard NY was notorious for tiny hotel rooms! The location was good in the sense that the room was not noisy at all so we were not kept awake at night. Nearby was the empire state building and Broadway/ 5th Avenue and being midtown, it was convenient to walk uptown and downtown so we were able to go by foot everywhere (although cabs are really cheap anyway). The staff were very friendly, especially Steve the assistant manager...really helpful. No complaints at all except perhaps the rooms were quite hot and stuffy at times...Would definitely return and had a great time in NY- which is also down to the choice of hotel.

<Title>“Grate choice, Grate value”
<Content>Grate place for the money. Very very clean w/ large renovated bathrooms. The only problem we had was you could`nt controll your own heat. The room was alittle warm so we had to keep the windows open..( the only thing that is keeping me from giving it a 5 rating) Front desk staff was very friendly and the maids were very good. We will stay again.

<Content>My best friend and I checked in to Hotel 3030 on 8 Nov 2010. Great location. We stayed for 3 nights. It was my birthday and they gave us a free room upgrade which was really NICE! During our stay, we asked concierge for directions and they were really helpful. Special thanks goes out to hotel staff DENNIS, who was really sweet to guide us to Bowery - the pick up point for our NYC 1 day tour! Would definitely stay at 3030 again Deborah Lee & Lai Mun Yee - Singapore

<Title>“Ideal hotel for a short stay in New York”
<Content>Stayed at the Hotel Thirty Thirty for 3 nights at the end of October with my husband and my sister and brother. When we arrived at the hotel we were really impressed, the reception area was lovely and had been very tastefully decorated for Halloween. My husband and I had been upgraded and our room was lovely and spacious with a seating area included. My brother and sister shared a twin room which included a kitchen area. Everyone in the hotel was lovely and helpful and the bar/restaurant attached was great, I recommend the cocktails! The location of the hotel was ideal, a two minute walk to the empire state building and not too far from Times Square. When I return to New York I would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Great Staff, Plain Jane Rooms and Decor”
<Content>Stayed at Thirty Thirty 11/06-11/08/10 with my 12 year Granddaughter for her birthday. Very pleasant staff, easy check in, Location just ok, a little to far east for me. The room was clean but very small (even for NY) and very sparsely decorated. Our room had 2 twin beds (comfortable) with a night stand in between, no type of dresser to store anything in, the TV is mounted in the corner towards the ceiling the smallest screen I ever seen in a hotel (I travel frequently everywhere) maybe a 19 inch,hope you have good eye sight. The window had just a white pull down blind-no type of valance or anything, only two pictures one behind each bed, the longest wall in the room had no pictures, bathroom small and dim. The room reminded be of a college dorm room. These things maybe petty to some but will probably prevent me from staying again, unless it was a great bargin, certainly not at $250 per night.

<Title>“Excellent guest service with a great location”
<Content>We got to N.Y around noon and didn't expect for them to check us in right away but they welcomed us with smiles. Especially, Katia at the front desk was very accomodating and friendly. We immediatly felt like at home and made our stay comfortable. The room was spacious and clean! The bathroom was nicely designed and modern. We couldn't believe the location! We took a train to Jamaica from the airport, then connect to subway, and 5minute walk to the hotel. Even though it was raining, we had no issues getting there. Katia gave us all kinds of helpful maps so that we can go and browse the area. When we were leaving the room, one of housekeepers was cleaning a room on the same floor. She came out to greet us and told us "Have a great day and a safe trip back home!!" We are from Boston and we know how big city hotels are like..but this was a nice touch! It meant a lot to us. Thank you everyone at the hotel. There is also a nice restaurant on the 1st floor. We didn't get to try it this time but we would definitely try it next time we visit.

<Content>we stayed at the thirty thirty in october 2010. on arrival the lobby is very very dark. check in was quick and easy. our room was a standard double and was pretty basic, the bed was comfy and clean and had 2 bedside tables one of which had the coffee maker on the bottom shelf which was a bit of an hastle, it had a small built in wardrobe with in room safe but there was no other furniture in the room, could have done with a chair at least. we paid extra for wifi but it was only about $14 per day, the hotel itself was clean and every staff member we passed including the maids greeted us with a smile and hello. if your just wanting a cheap clean base its ideal and the location was good near empire state building and 5th avenue.

<Title>“Small, but spiffy, and a (mostly) great customer service mindset”
<Content>Pros: Incredibly convenient location, great staff, comfortable beds. Cons: Booking snafu caused "broom closet upgrade"; usurious rates for internet access; dour restaurant staff The last thing I look forward to when checking into a NYC hotel after a 5-hour flight (coming from the West Coast) is a hassle with my room. Unfortunately, that's what happened when my room was given away, and I was reassigned to a lower-category room (note to everyone: avoid getting room 608--literally a largish mop closet!). Thankfully, a very understanding and ready to please Alya (I hope I got her name right) worked to make things right by changing my room the next day to the proper category (still a smallish room, and I'd had larger MidTown hotel rooms, but hey...this is Manhattan-whatever). She also smoothed things over with some complimentary breakfast vouchers for the restaurant next door. As for the breakfast. The connected restaurant is called Zana. The breakfast was good (meat/eggs/juice and/or beverage, or a more continental style option), but the deadpan, emotionless waitress who's face droops when she sees a voucher in your hand was a bummer, despite her nearly $2.00 "service fee". :( I don't know whether the hotel owns the restaurant, or they just partner--they are connected via the hallway in the front entrance. The room I was moved to was an updated, but obviously older room in an older Midtown Manhattan building. The room was clean, orderly, and uncluttered. The environmental controls worked sufficiently, and I used them to cool the room (we had high 60s/low 70s most of the days, and at night (high 40s made the heat welcome). Three elevators speed you to your floor of choice, which was nice. The location is conveniently located between Park Avenue South and Madison Avenue. One to two blocks east or west gets you to subway and bus service, and taxis were readily available, with decent restaurants in close proximity. Within 5-7 short blocks north and south, an enjoyable walk with shops and Madison Park can be had--I suggest you do that at least once (going to the Shake Shack is in itself worth the walk!). I enjoyed a nice sub-10 minute walk to my client in a relatively safe, clean neighborhood with lots of tourist "eye candy" (Empire State Building, Flatiron District, New York Life building, etc). Professional and pleasant bell, desk, and door staff, and all with great attitudes salvaged this business trip experience for me. I'd consider another stay at the 30 30.

<Content>Spent a week in Thirty Thirty late august. Had a great stay, the staff was very nice, especially the front desk. My room, a Standard Guest Room, was a bit smaller than I expected, but not a problem at all. Had a great view of the Empire State Building! Room & bathroom got cleansed every day. Bed got made, fresh towels. And dont forget the sound proof walls and windows. Dont believe the stories about loud AC's! Try to book the hotel via an agency. It will save you money. Subway, about 5 min away. Dont forget, yellow cabs are cheap in NYC! Starbucks, Diner, etc right around the corner. Close to 5 av, Madison & Park Avenue.

<Title>“Great for a rough and ready weekend on a stag/hen do or shoppint”
<Content>This hotel is in a very good location - right near Madison Avenue. However, not a lot of other good things about it in my experience. The rooms are average - the AC was too loud to leave on and sleep. No facilities other than a lobby and 3 or 4 small lifts; the restaurant is a separate business next to the hotel (though accessed within lobby/entrance). This hotel would be fine if you intended to spend most of your time elsewhere; not suitable for a business stay or if you're looking for even modest comfort.

Do not expect room service or a fancy in bar service, any way we were not in New York to stay in our room but the room, location and front desk service is more than what we expected.

<Title>“good once room sorted”
<Content>Arrived here on the 14.10.10 we had booked a room for 3 adults, at reception we where informed that none where available so did we mind a roll away bed, not knowing what this was we said ok. where very shooked when a camp bed arrived that wasnt long enough for an adult, reception said that there was nothing they could do until tomorrow, so we put the mattress off the camp bed on the floor for the night ( not the way you want to spend your 50th birthday). The next morning we left our bags at reception while we went out for the day, on return they had moved us to a very nice room with the right amount of beds. The hotel is well located to get to everywhere, and the bar over the road does great cocktails. It would have been great if reception had unbrella we did ask as it was pouring and by the time we got to a shop to buy one we where soaked to the skin.

<Title>“Adequate if all you need is a place to sleep”
<Content>I stayed here while attending a meeting about a block away and will be back for several more two-night stays over the next several months. The room is astonishingly small. There is very little room for anything besides the bed itself; there is no dresser,desk or chair and the sink itself is in the room since the bathroom is about the size of a phone booth (remember those?). But the room was clean, the bed comfortable, and the staff friendly. The neighborhood is nice, a short walk to the Empire State Building, walking distance to both Penn Station and Grand Central, near the subway, less than a mile from Times Sq. The hotel was booked and paid for by my host and it was fine since all I was doing was sleeping, showering, and getting dressed. If I had a week's worth of luggage or was traveling with my wife, the small size of the room would have been a problem. The staff were very friendly and pleasant.

<Title>“Expensive for what it was”
<Content>Spent a couple of nights here in a small room with no view (then again, we booked late). I'm not sure why NYC hotels have to hike up their prices so much. Anyway, we came back a day later to see if they had a room free and the concierge just shook his head and said 'fully booked'. We went round the corner to the Hotel Roger, where we hadn't stayed before and though they were full too, the girl called two hotels for us and found us a room at the Vincci Avalon. Here the room was awesome - three times the size of our Thirty Thirty room, only two blocks away and much less expensive. Surely the Thirty Thirty concierge could have rung around for us? All I know is that next time we'll be staying at the Vincci Avalon or the Roger.

<Title>“Total let down for my daughters suprise 40th birthday present”
<Content>My daughter and I shared a twin room end of Nov/Dec 09. The room was so small with innadequate storage space - not enough wardrobe space or 2 people and we were tripping over our cases all the time as there was nowhere to store them. The room was very hot which meant that we had to have the window open alnight. As a result we were kept awake most of the night by a generator from an adjoining building!. Lots of dust under the bed which indicated that it had'nt been cleaned properly for quite sometime. The only good thing I can say about the room is the bathroom, it was very clean and spacious. These things aside, I did not expect luxury, but I would expect courtesy from the staff at the hotel. I found the staff to be unhelpul and to put it bluntly, miserable!. It was hard to get a smile out of them and certainly not a "hello" or "goodnight". If you asked them for advice this was not forthcoming - much easier to ask a friendly New Yorker on the street.. The location is good, just round the corner from the Empire State Building and within easy walking distance for Macy's etc.. I was very let down by this hotel particularly as I had saved hard for a year to give my daughter a suprise 40th birthday present. This said, It has not put me off returning to N.Y as it is such a fantastic, vibrant city with very friendly and hospitable people. I am now looking to return with friends asap but unfortunately not to this hotel!.

<Content>Located in an ideal base. About 35minutes walk to Times Square. Hotel very modern, clean and rooms just what is needed. Air conditioning works fantastically well, which is needed when theres a heat wave. Rooms very clean, but a little on the small side. Lots of towels given and cleaning products. No fridge in the room, but ice machines available. Room service, slightly over priced but nice non the less. Lots of places to eat, in and around the hotel though. Very quiet area and close to most things, either walking distance/public transport. Would recommend to anyone, a lovely stay. Would definitely go back!

<Title>“Good location, friendly staff”
<Content>My fiancee and I booked this hotel through expedia and got a great rate so it was definitely value for the money we paid. The hotel is in a good location it is only a short walk to MACY's and the Empire State Building. The hotel staff were very friendly, knowledgable and efficient. The down sides were 1. The room was small, it had no wardrobe or safe, the only furniture was 2 bedside tables. That said staff were helpful and assisted us to get a safe that was stored in the reception area. 2. The overall cleanliness in our room was very good with the exception of underneath the bed which was full of dust and looked like it had not been clean for a long while.

<Title>“Tatty, tiny rooms.”
<Content>First impressions of a lovely lobby and good location just set us up for a huge disapointment when we got to the room! Even for NYC standards the rooms were tiny, I just about found enough floor space for a small back pack and carry on suitcase. No desk or other furniture and just a TV attached to the wall made for a depressing experience although the bathroom was modern. Corridors were run down and seemed quite sketchy in places, I wouldn't have been too happy staying here on my own especially having noticed one of the rooms taped up with what looked like crime scene tape! Great location with fab little bar opposite but would not stay here again, it's not even cheap. Have stayed in the Hilton Garden Inn (W35th) which although also with small rooms was far better value and similar location.

<Title>“Very Nice Boutique Hotel”
<Content>For our annual trip to the US Open tennis tournament in New York we booked a room for four nights (09/02/10-09/06/10) at hotel Thirty Thirty. We were not disappointed, quite the opposite, as we were pleasantly surprised. Thirty Thirty is a very nice boutique hotel at the corner of 30th Street and Madison Avenue and a convenient walk to Penn Station and/or Grand Central Station. Check-in by Julio was very pleasant and efficient. We were upgraded to a very nice room on the fifth floor. The room was a large corner room and appointed with all the necessities such as a hairdryer, iron/full sized ironing board and flat screen TV. I had requested a refrigerator for the room and once my request was confirmed by Julio, a refrigerator was delivered to my room within 10 minutes of my arrival. As we were celebrating our anniversary, upon our return after a long day at the Open, a bouquet of fresh flowers was in our room, accompanied by a card from the hotel manager. A very nice gesture! Each night I phoned the front desk for a wake-up call and each morning precisely on time, I received the call. Each day we asked for some information, directions or recommendations from the front desk staff and were always treated courteously and efficiently. Check out was pleasant and efficient. Most importantly, my bill was exactly what I expected. We are avid travelers and have stayed in hotels ranging from stilted tree lodges in Africa to five star hotels in Europe. We would not hesitate to book Thirty Thirty again and recommend it to other travelers.

<Title>“Have no complaints!”
<Content>Having read some reviews I was very wary of what to expect, so was pleasantly surprised to have a nice friendly welcome and a small but clean, comfortable & functional room. The hotel is ideally situated with the Empire State Building, Macy's & the Museum of Sex (worth a visit!) just around the corner. No tea, only coffee supplied in rooms, so that a small minus!

<Title>“small but comfortable rooms, good location, competitive price”
<Content>We had a bedroom with two twin beds which was very spacious and clean (incl. Flat-TV, hairdryer, wardrobe, etc.). Nice bathroom with modern shower (easy walk-in). The hotel has obviously been refurbished. The hotel is conveniently located in Midtown Manhattan between Madison and Park Avenue at 30th East. Short walk to next underground station. Penn Station is about a 10min walk. Many stores (Deli's, breakfast bar, Starbucks, etc.) are located around the corner at Park Avenue. Will definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel and Excellent Location”
<Content>After reading other reviews about this hotel i was a bit worried on what i would expect on my arrival expecially after buying my partner this trip for his 30th birthday but can honestly say this hotel was fantastic with a fantastic location in NYC. The staff were very helpful and friendly. On our arrival we were upgraded and had the most amazing sized room, with an enourmous bed! The hotel staff did everything they could to make sure our stay was great. Only a couple of blocks away was the Empire State and a Subway station just round the corner. Everyone is quick to write a review if the hotel hasn't met their expectations and that's why i wanted to praise this hotel for making our stay in New York an unbelieveable experience.

<Title>“Perfect on a budget, but with location and service”
<Content>I can't begin to say how much we appreciated the quality of service, and the location of this hotel. From the nearby subway stop, it is only about 10 to 15 minutes from any major attraction. From the day of check-in to departure, we were treated like we were truly welcome. The guest services associate/greeter (Vickie) made us feel so welcome while we waited for our room. She must have spoke with us for about 20 minutes just to get to know us. It was very nice. She wwas so friendly. We were 3 hours early to check-in, and the agent at the desk did made every attempt to get us in and off to our first NYC attraction. We were in our room 2 hours before she said we could be because she quickly radioed the housekeeping department to alert them we had arrived. It was a great example of customer service. Also helping us was the concierge (Judy), she took all the time we needed to help us get going in the right direction. Another huge plus was the attention given to my wife by the sales director (Kerry) When I mentioned it was her birthday, and her first time to NYC, she upgraded our room to a larger room with a king bed. This was done even though they were at a very high occupancy, and probably could have made more money by selling it to someone else. When we were leaving the hotel on departure day, and asked if we needed a cab to the airport, the bellman ran out the front door and all the way down the street to the corner, which had to have been over 100 yards away, to hail a cab quickly for us. It was something to see. Last be not least, our room attendant, which I wish I had her name, was without question the most appreciaitve person I have ever met in the service industry. Upon our departure, she came up to us to personally thank us for staying with them and allowing for her to take care of us. She went on to say that if she doesn't take care of people right, they won't come to stay, and she would have no job. I didn't know what to say, I was to busy "picking my jaw up off the floor". This lady was the most sincere person I have ever met. Without a doubt I would return. Thank you "Thirty Thirty" for helping make my wife's first NYC visit a very special one. You may not be a 5 star property, but you make up for it with 6 star service, and enough amenities at a very fair price for your area.

<Title>“A fantastic hotel....”
<Content>After reading some of the negative reviews, I was a bit anxious about my stay here, but I can honestly say that the hotel was fantastic. We couldnt of asked for a better location...5 minutes away from Empire State Building, 10 minutes away from Times Square, and some great views of the city (we were lucky to get a view of the Empire State building) We were welcomed by the friendly maid (floor 12) as we found our room, and our room was always clean and fresh each day. Top stars for the maid. The staff were friendly, the lobby was lovely and the Restaurant was great value. We were not disturbed by the traffic, and our room was a reasonable size with a kitchenette for storing drinks in the hot weather. All the staff were friendly, and I would definately recomment this hotel, and will definately plan to stay here again. Thank you Thirty Thirty!

<Title>“Good location”
<Content>Went for my partners 30th (thirty thirty) great location, just around the corner from Empire state and central for shopping, 5th ave etc and sight seeing. Walked to all the major sites from here. A good pizza restaraunt on the corner. Coffee machine in room, free safety deposit, tv. Not sure what people are complaning about. When you are in NYC most of your time is spent away from the hotel! It was clean and modern. A good location and somewhere to sleep. Would stop there again, without doubt.It had a quiet bar downstairs, ideal for a quick drink on way out / in. Only gripe i had is that they never had any money in reception to change a travellers cheques, which i found odd??? My first time in USA so would advise just taking a credit card next time. Macys change them for free, or there is a bank nearby.

<Title>“Yes the rooms are small, yes its quite pricey but this is NYC!”
<Content>When booking this hotel we were looking for a room plain and simple - did it deliver Yes! Sure the room was very small we were allocated one of the corner bedrooms which were the smallest of all the rooms in the hotel judging by the floorplans displayed for fire safety - but it did exactly what we needed ie. to provide us with somewhere to sleep while visiting the city. Hotel is in a great location only 15 minutes to Flat Iron, Empire State and Grand Central Station so we found it perfect for getting around. Its also has a lot of amenities nearby including a great deli just on the corner opposite the hotel (great for breakfasts!) and also a pub across the road. Only downside to this hotel was we were put next to a service room which must have had some machinery running (aircon?) as we did have a lot of noise - but then again for the rate we paid for the room in a bustling city what can you expect? Would be tempted to book direct next time as not sure whether booking through expedia led to us being allocated the smallest room.

<Title>“How could other reviewers be so off???”
<Content>On the positive side the lobby is modern and well designed and the staff were friendly (but not very helpful). The rest of the news is horrible. I don't know if other reviewers stayed in the same hotel as we did. The worst was a noxious chemical smell the permeated the room making it disgusting to be in. The front desk staff were sympathatic (although the maid said she couldn't smell it while neighbors complained of the same thing) but not helpful. The rooms were dirty, with nasty carpets (we felt we needed to wear shoes to go to the bathroom), wallpaper was falling off the walls, and a small air conditioner (circa 1970's) blew in hot air all night (making the room in the upper 80'). The electric cord from the AC snaked around the room on its way to the outlet. Common hallways were missing ceiling panes and had burned out bulbs. Not only was internet expensive, but the iceing on the cake was the $2 they wanted to charge to print out my airline boarding pass! In summary, I would never return to this hotel -- even it were were free. If you must stay here request that you are NOT be on the main hallway (rooms 413-433 or 513-533, etc.) as these rooms have a window (in which sits the AC) that only face a wall a few feet away and the window can't be opened.

<Title>“Relaxing and comfortable stay!”
<Content>Check in was very easy especially with their park and stay special. Even though you can't access your car with the package it was convenient to just pull up and have valet take your car for you. The staff was very polite and kept the line moving fast. The room was a decent size for the price in Manhattan with a large bathroom. Only complaint I had was when I wanted to watch tv late at night. The tv was a nice flat screen but was mounted on wall up by ceiling and faced straight out, hard to see lying in bed. Check out process was just as smooth as check in and car was brought to us within minutes. Would recommend a few nights stay at the 30-30!!

<Title>“Terrific, personal yet sophisticated in a great location.”
<Content>The hotel is located in a terrific area near plenty of restaurants within walking distance. The lobby is smartly decorated and the staff at the front desk could not have been any nicer. In fact, one person went out of his way to help with directions, tips and even remembered my name (in New York!). The rooms were comfortable with very soft beds and fine cotton sheets...the kind of bed you want to sink into after a long day. Everything was spotless. A very good value in a great location!

<Title>“Could not have been better”
<Content>This was a great little hotel. The desk staff was helpful, the room was clean and large enough (by NYC standards, of course), the lobby was lovely, there was a bar next door we didnâ€™t try (but had great happy hour deals posted) and a great little bar across the street that we did try and loved (The Crooked Knife). Additionally, the hotel was well located--we walked to the Empire State Building/Herald Square/Macyâ€™s (we were only in town for one day on our way to the airport, so we werenâ€™t really sightseeing). We would definitely stay here again, especially considering the great price. Check out Brasserie Les Halles around the corner--friends took us here for dinner, and it was fantastic.

<Title>“Perfect place if you need quality and you can afford a medium budget.”
<Content>Thirty-Thirty Hotel is a great place if you want a clean bed, a great staff, security and a comfortable place to sleep and you donâ€™t want to pay much. The bathroom is very clean and you get clean towels, soap and shampoo everyday. It has a great location because it is near subway stations 28th or 33rd Street from lines 4, 5 or 6. It is located between Madison and Park Av., very near from 5th Av and the Gran Central Station. Itâ€™s not a luxurious place, but you will really get a very good quality-price relation. Staying at 30/30 Hotel allows you to move freely along the island using the subway and if you have a good health and youâ€™re fit you can also walk the streets surrounding the hotel and discover small and beautiful places that might not appear in your guidebook. We (Alfonso and Gabriela) definitely enjoyed our experience at 30/30 Hotel and will gladly stay there if we ever go back to New York City.

<Title>“excellent location and very comfortable”
<Content>We settled on the 30 30 after noting it was one of the budget hotels used for years by Virgin holidays and booked direct with the hotel. It was much cheaper than many others nearby and with teenagers we could neither afford nor did we care to stay anywhere too plush! We had a family room with 2 queen beds and a pull down sofa and it couldn't be faulted. We took advantage of the inclusive breakfast everyday in the adjoining restaurant and it was made freshly to order and delicvious, although there were only 3 things to chose from so we got a little bored towards the end of our stay. The reception staff were very helpful and very friendly. As a clean base to stay with sufficient room and a great location and excellent value for money it was faultless. Well done thirty thirty.

<Title>“Amazing holiday, no complaints.”
<Content>Hotel was all we asked for very good value for money, somewhere to sleep and wash inbetween sight seeing. Was a very clean and comfortable room. Staff were extremely helpful when we had questions, and concierge sold us an amazing deal to the Greyline sight seeing tours which got us four tours and a ticket to either the Empire state builing or Rockefella. The tour is a must to get a good view of all of New York and very interesting with all the local guides knowledge. You never get bored because everyone knows something different. My partner has done the same tour twice now and the two were completely different. Was quite a walk to Times square but very close to Empire state building and The Flat iron building. Would definitely visit New York again and stay in this hotel. We had an amazing holiday and are still having the holiday blues a year later.

<Title>“The staff at Thirty Thirty Hotel is accommodating and the rooms are a bargain for NYC”
<Content>We were greeted warmly by the staff at Thirty Thirty Hotel every day of our vacation. Our room was clean and quiet. While the room was not large, it was comfortable. And, the price made it an excellent value. The staff brought the pack and play for our 20 month old son to sleep in within an hour of request. We were there during the heat wave in July. The air conditioner did pretty well considering how obscenely hot it was. The hotel is an easy walk to Penn Station and not too far from Grand Central. It is also convenient to the Empire State Building. There are a number of restaurants within a couple of blocks which we enjoyed. The restaurant across the street (the Crooked Knife) has nice pub fare. We also enjoyed Les Halles on Park. We will definitely stay here again when we visit NYC.

<Title>“Watch the 'bait and switch'”
<Content>Don't ask for a room with a view, they are like a Motel 6: small bed, 1 plastic chair and one small TV mounted to the ceiling. . .period. Our 3rd try for a room at this hotel landed us in a 'Superior Queen' which amounts to an 'average' room: bed, desk with chair, upholstered chair, medium TV in cabinet, and night stands. It was sort of clean, tile grout in bathroom floor/shower wasn't clean. Lobby nice - modern. Starbucks on one corner, subway on the other, easy walk to Empire State Building - good location. If going to JFK airport, don't let hotel call you a cab -they will call a 'gypsy' cab for $60.00 whe a 'yellow' cab is $45. We stayed 4 nights in the 'superior' room. If you pay more for a higher end room (near the elevators with no views) or negotiate a better room, you'll like this hotel. If you don't, you will feel like you are in a youth hostel. Also, avoid the kichenettes - funky not in a good way.

<Title>“HARD HARD beds in walking distance to most things”
<Content>The beds were HARD AS CEMENT. Be sure to request a room AWAY from 30th Street or you will be up all night. First night we spent in a room the size of my bathroom at home right off 30th Avenue and didn't sleep at all. We asked to switch rooms in the morning and were moved to a bigger room with kitchenette but the bathroom was tiny. If you need a lot of room to stretch out...don't pick this hotel. It was clean, front desk was friendly, price was right, close to subway. If you're not picky, this place is probably ok. You also had to pay by the minute to use the internet in the lobby. Breakfast is included but they charge you $3 gratuity before you leave.

The staff went above and beyond (Vicki and Sam) and the only complaint that I have was that the A/C in the room was very noisy. Everything else was how I expected it to be and the lobby was decorated very well. It was definitely a hidden gem! Now if I didn't leave my cell phone chargers in the room in my rush to check out...

<Content>Nice hotel. Staff very friendly. Room was ordinary but clean and had enough space for both of us. Close to the Empire State, FlatIron ... we were on the 10th floor, 30th street side and we could see the Empire ... I recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Excellent mid town location, great girls weekend away”
<Content>This hotel is not in the hustle and bustle of it all, but for my first time to NYC, being in a central location is key. This is an excellent location if you plan on doing things like Statue of Liberty Cruise, Ground Zero Museum/Workshop, Times Square, Tours, Broadway...because you're in the middle of it all. Approx a 15 minute brisk walk to Times Square, or hop on the subway (nearby stations) and be there in 5 minutes. The room we had (2 girls) had two twin beds and was long/narrow. Definately not an exceptional view, but we got it for about 160-170 a night which was a great deal at the time for NYC. Some rooms in the hotel would have a nice view. Although the room was small, there was plenty of space for our luggage and shopping finds. The bathroom was spacious, and well lit. I felt safe at this hotel, it is not in a shady area. The lobby was impressive. There are two entrances, which is great depending on what direction you're travelling. Staff were friendly and helpful, they were able to change our room due to the original assigned room being a handheld shower (possibly wheelchair accessible?). They were knowledgeable about local area/restaurants. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes in the area. The onsite restaurant was delcious and had a great atmosphere (I had some sort of pasta dish with truffles...mmm). There is paid access internet, great for looking up things quickly. Expensive to use, I can't remember exactly how much. Great stay at thirty thirty overall.

<Title>“Great hotel, see Empire State from your room!”
<Content>I stayed here in August 2009 for a few days on a family holiday, my family of 6 ranging from 18-60 we all enjoyed our stay at 30 30. Whilst we was staying at the hotel the night porter had left/been fired and an American women was going crazy about how they wasn't anybody was on duty and we was going to get robbed, which obviously she was over reacting and nobody got robbed or even worse more! The room I had had was spacious with two single beds, view of Empire State which was very impressive!, a wardrobe and a kitchenette. I only used the fridge in the kitchen but I'm sure the rest of the things worked fine and was very well kept and clean. Also the bathroom was clean and spacious. The location for this hotel was fantastic as alot of tourist attractions and restraunts was in walking distance. I would recommend a little Mexican/Spanish cafe/shop about two/three blocks up from the hotel when you come to a zebra crossing it's on that corner. We went here everyday for our breakfast as we found it great as it had a shop where you can get your ceral and fruits or if you fancy a hot breakfast had a cafe style for this, also alot of locals go here too. (sorry for the really bad description I am writing this a year later) When I do return back to New York I would come back to this hotel.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel”
<Content>I arrived on Friday, July 26 and was able to check in early which was great - since it was nice to refreshing up before we left to roam around NYC. Right from the beginning, the hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating - especially George. On Saturday evening, we arrived late back at the hotel (10:15 pm) for dinner (kitchen closes at 11 pm) and we were able to get a fabulous meal prepared for us at 10:45 pm - (thank you to the kitchen - we were incredibly hungry and food was yummy). While the rooms seem to be different - i had no complaints about mine - only issue being the TV (for two days could not figure it out) but you really only go to sleep in your room. There are great restos around the neighbourhood - and would highly recommend - Wine on 30 - it is a small but fabulous local wine bar - where I had one of the best nights in NYC - the guests were great to chat with and the owner was an awesome host. For my future trips to NYC - I will definitely return to the hotel - as it is in a great location, staff are excellent - but not so much the conceriege who really was not helpful in providing information to Penn Station. But we found it anyway!

<Title>“Quiet, Comfortable Room -- A Good Value”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at Hotel Thirty Thirty in a standard room (#610 with queen bed) for a weekend night and had a positive experience. The hotel's staff was friendly and helpful; the room and bathroom were very clean; the air conditioning worked well; the bed was comfortable and had good quality linens; we didn't hear noise from other rooms, the hall, or outside. The only negative thing we noticed was that the carpet in the room was ugly and stained in at least four different places. For $150 per night (including taxes), we found Hotel Thirty Thirty to be a good value for NYC and would stay there again.

<Content>I have stayed at this hotel several times and the staff is friendly and helpful. There used to be a few unfriendly employees but they are not there any more. The staff have gone out of their way to be accomodating. The hotel has been remodeling it's rooms and bathrooms and they are roomy and nicely decorated. The hotel is conveniently located to everything I need - business and restaurants. I will definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Mixed Reviews”
<Content>I had very mixed reviews about this hotel. I had 2 bookings, one by myself for 5 nights where my stay was very average and then another booking in a different room with a friend which was good. My first room, although it was a non-smoking room, smelt strongly of smoke. The room next to mine had someone smoking in it 24/7. I had to go to the pharmacy and buy deodourisers. Also the tiles in my shower were mouldy and I had to wear thongs/flip flops in there which was dissappointing. The bathroom was also tiny and the wash basin wasn't in the bathroom but in the bedroom which I didn't like. The room was however clean and not at all noisy. I did ask to change rooms on the second night but as it was summer the hotel was booked and they didn't have a room available for me. The second room that I stayed in with a friend was clean, had nice shower tiles where I didn't need to wear thongs/flip flops and it had a huge bathroom, it even had a bath! Also no signs of smoke. If I had stayed in the second room the whole time I would have thought this was a great hotel and recommended it but maybe not worth the risk. Apart from the room, the hotel front desk staff were very nice and friendly, always willing to help/offer suggestions of places to go. Also, the woman at the concierge desk was extremely thorough when booking my shuttle which I really appreciated.

<Title>“Nice Stay”
<Content>We arrived at the hotel around 3:30pm on Friday, July 16. The hotel was on 30th Street, between Madison & Park Avenue. I mainly stayed at this hotel because they are 1) pet friendly, and 2) Four blocks from Madison Square Park (which had a doggy park area). Nice hotel, the walk to the park was easy, the hotel itself was impersonal, but the check in was fast, we did not have to wait. We were given Room 408, which was very big in my opinion, and the bathroom was HUGE!!! We faced 30th Street and at night, I only woke up once hearing sirens, but it wasn't on 30th street, it was most likely Madison or Park. 30th Street was quiet in the evenings. The hotel had an exit out of the back onto 29th street and a short walk 4 blocks down to Madison Park with the dogs every morning, noon and night â€“ was very nice! The park itself was very nice and the doggy area was stocked with water and plastic bags for you know what! New Yorkers pick up after their animals! What I liked about the hotel: 1) Pet Friendly! Not fees, however, they do have a 2 animal maximum, but my dogs were very small, so they allowed all 4 and I truly appreciated that! 2) Large Room (# 408 was anyway) 3) Nice beds, comfy, (pillows were really fluffy) 4) Walk in closet 5) Huge bathroom with window and shelving. 4) Valet parking -- $30 for passenger cars, $35 for SUVs (relatively cheap in NYC) 5) Close to 28th Street Subway (Green line # 6 train) What I did not like: 1) Elevators (very small and cramped, very warm) â€“ but I have to say I never waited for an elevator 2) Lobby was impersonal, huge, but impersonal 3) No business center that I saw, computers you had to pay for Overall, nice hotel, good check in, good check out. Staff helped get my suitcases and belongins and get downstars. The battery in my car, since it was parked and not moved all weekend, went dead, so they jumped it for me without charging and got me on my way.

<Title>“The Hotel Thirty Thirty is a find!”
<Content>We are so happy to have found this perfectly located hotel for our recent trip to New York to celebrate our mom's 80th birthday. It is equidistant between Times Square and the downtown neighborhoods (Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side) we were interested in visiting. Every staff member was pleasant and accommodating. The beds are utterly fantastic: great mattresses, sheets and pillows, and down comforters. Another huge plus is the fact that although you are in the heart of Manhattan, the block is very quiet. I usually try to stay on a high floor whenever I visit New York, to try to get away from street noise, but at this hotel we slept like babies even on the second floor. You will love this place.

<Content>I am a New Yorker and there frequently. This trip I needed a hotel, this was mentioned and it was perfect. Like most boutique hotels, as in Europe, it was small, huge bathroom and the beds amazing. When you are in NYC, you are not there to stay in your room !!! Transportation so close by. We went from City Hall, to Yankee Staduim, to Park Slope in Brooklyn w/o a blink. This was a very special trip for my grandson as well as myself. I cannot thank the people at the hotel enough. Thank you. SAP

<Title>“Hotel Thirty Thirty saves grandmother with 3 tired grumpy teenagers”
<Content>I checked in in the afternoon after a long Amtrack ride from New Orleans. I had made reservations for myself and two teens, but at last minute, my 18 year old grandson decided to come. The staff at Hotel Thirty Thirty was great; changing my accommodations to a larger room at no extra cost. The staff was professional, efficient and extremely friendly, as was housekeeping. Overall, my experience at Hotel Thirty Thirty was 100% satisfactory. Oh, did I forget to mention the great breakfast, not a continental breakfast, but a choice of several full breakfasts. I have already recommended this hotel to several friends and will be returning myself in Dec.

<Title>“Excellent Service; upgraded for anniversary”
<Content>Anniversary was a success because the staff was so helpful and kind. Made online reservation mentioning "anniversary." Least expensive hotel with a higher rating. When we got there, we were upgraded to a large corner sweet at no extra charge. Maybe it's because NYC is a place for romantics, but when we used the buss word "anniversary" it seemed as if everybody in town was interested in helping us, the flower shop customers for picking out what women want, the hotel concierge for the best restaurant, the desk clerk with a vase for the flowers, and so on. Even the restaurant next door said we could cork our own special wine at no addition charge if we BYOB. Nice place; memorable experience.

<Title>“Excellent value on summer holiday weekend”
<Content>Stayed on July 4 and 5 and found rate on hotel website for $99/night, which is excellent for that section of Manhattan (Entrances on both 29th and 30th Sts between Park Ave and Madison Ave). Though not what I thought would be the best feature of the hotel, the air conditioning was ACES! Each day the outdoor temp was over 100F and our room faced west. After full days of being a tourist, the room was ice cold when we walked in. That in itself was worth the money. The room is small and although I had read that in other reviews (and had decided that I could live with it) it was noticable that a chair would have been more relaxing to watch a little TV instead of trying to prop up on the bed. Also, eating a sandwich on the bed while trying not to make a mess would also have been avoided if there was room for a small table. They lose a little credit for a dirty shower. On the first evening that we were there, my wife and I both showered and the label fell off the conditioner bottle and landed on the floor. That label was still in the same spot on the floor after maid service that day. I didn't think much of it at the time, but later wondered what other obvious dirt had been left by the maids. Don't let me comments about the small room or one missed label on the shower floor mislead you. If you can get this hotel room for $140 or less per night, you can't go wrong. It is two blocks from the #6 subway and four blocks from the N, Q and R lines. There is a Starbucks on the corner and little restaurants within a block or two in any direction. I was more than happy with my stay and will highly consider Hotel ThirtyThirty the next time I am in New York.

<Title>“Great location for exploring NY city”
<Content>This hotel is in a great location and for New YorK prices, it's good value. The rooms are clean & comfortable, though not much in the way of charm or character, but as a base for exploring it's pretty much ideal. Remember to take your shower cap, as they don't supply them. We didn't eat in the restaurant here as the service at breakfast time wasn't the best and it put us off. However, the bar & restaurant across the road called The Crooked Knife serves great food and service with a smile, which makes all the difference. We ate there 3 out of our 6 nights in NY, and the staff even remembered us when we returned. I would definitely recommend eating and/or drinking at this bar & restaurant.

<Title>“Great hotel, great location, ideal for solo traveler on a budget!”
<Content>I stayed at the Thirty Thirty while attending a conference at the Javits Convention Centre (half hour walk, or 5 minute cab ride). I was so pleased with my accomodations and would recommend it to anyone! As a single female traveler, I had my apprehensions about staying alone in the city, however, the location of this hotel is perfect and completely comfortable! It's close enough to all major tourist attractions (walking distance if you're up for it) and yet it's in a quiet/pleasant enough street/area that you're not bombarded with crowds and too much foot traffic. The Empire State Building is right around the corner, there is a fantastic deli right across the street where you can literally buy all of your meals. The hotel is clean, the staff are friendly, and the other guests were decent. I had a single room with a twin bed, which was small, but so cozy! Yes, the toilet WAS located in the shower, but for some reason this was not even a problem. There was a TV, room for my luggage, two windows, decent closet, and a big window ledge where you can also store a bunch of stuff. I was extremely comfortable the whole time. The maid service was excellent...the entire hotel is clean and well-maintained. I can't say enough good things about this place! Particularly because it was my first time traveling alone to the city and there were so many factors to consider...I'm glad I made the right choice, and I am definitely recommending this hotel to anyone I know going to NYC. It was affordable and so practical. Needless to say, when I return for the conference next year, I'll be staying here again.

<Content>I have stayed at the 30-30 in 5 different occassions during the past 10 months. I have always enjoyed the service I receive from the personnel, the doorbell, front desk, maid service and management. Always willing to help. The hotel is located walking distance from NY Penn Station, if you need to take a train, and two blocks away from the subway station, which is perfect for my needs because from here I can get very easily to my meetings or to Newark airport. The rooms are clean with confortable bed and pillows. The only thing I would change is to have a small desk or table in the room as to work more confortabily. This hotel offers a very good balance of price-benefit.

<Content>We had two twins rooms. They were clean, small but adequate and the beds were comfortable. The air conditioning worked well, when we realsied we had to turn it on! We had the breakfast options which was good value, not that exciting but we appreciated the free refills of tea each morning. The biggest point has got to be where the hotel is situated, we walked two blocks to 5th avenue our first morning and there in frount of us was the Empire State building - wow! It was also well situated for all the shopping we wanted to do and eating out, shows etc. Hope you go and have a good a time as we did.

<Title>“very good customer service”
<Content>I really enjoyed this hotel. They had excellent customer service. I booked the hotel on Priceline and it booked me for a standard. When I called I needed a bigger room to accompany 3 people. They went ahead and put in the system that we would get a family room. When i showed up they didn't have any family rooms available till the next night so they gave me a superior with a roll away. They didn't charge for the roll away and were very reasonable with the price. i was very impressed by this! .... excellent customer service especially the hispanic lady who worked at night! she was awesome I don't remember her name though. room was better than expected from reading all the reviews previously. but bed was very hard.... but after being out all day seeing sights it was pretty comfortable with us being so tired....... i would stay here again because they were sooo accomodating :)

<Title>“Great Stay at Thirty Thirty Hotel”
<Content>Our stay at the Thirty Thirty Hotel was booked by a Travel Agent and the accommodation was a double room. As we were staying for 5 nights we asked for and paid for an upgrade to a larger room. The Hotel Manager took us to see the new room and was most helpful. We were delighted with the room, we had an extremely comfortable, king-sized bed, a desk, a sofa, two tvs, and a most beautiful, luxury black granite bathroom with a double shower. There was a coffee maker with complimentary sachets of coffee, creamer, sugar and biscuits, but being mainly tea drinkers we bought tea bags and long-life milk and used the coffee maker to boil water. The hotel was quiet and the room very clean. It was the perfect location to explore Manhatten and we walked for miles, however we used the subway to go further afield and also the blue tour buses on four occasions to have guided tours of uptown and downtown Manhatten, early evening Manhatten and Brooklyn by night and a 2 hour river cruise around Manhatten from Pier 42. Thank you to Thirty Thirty, especially the Hotel Manager, for making our New York stay so memorable.

<Content>If you paid $120 or less, than it is a great hotel. I paid over $220 due to last minute planning, and a great value it was NOT! If you DO reserve in advance, it seems you can get the hotel for little over a hundred, which I would say is fair. The service is good, but seems a bit understaffed and is always busy. But they DO try to accomodate your requests, so I'm okay with that. The room is clean, but absolutely no thought or effort went into making it look nice. None whatsoever. The room is also VERY tight (standard), and you can't even open up your suitcase without completely blocking the entrance. No place to store clothes, nothing. Everything is absolutely minimal. The bed is good, slept well, but the windows were not too effective in blocking out outside construction early in the morning. What irritates me is that when I reserved the room from expedia, they charge you $16 more to include breakfast which is only $12.95 (before taxes) if you choose to just buy it there. WTF is that all about. Don't know if that is the fault of Expedia or the hotel, but if you're paying out of your pocket, be aware. In regards to the quality of the hotel, I think the following states it best: As I was going down the elevator, I met one of the people working at the hotel (cleaning or maintenance staff). The person asked me how I was enjoying the hotel, and I said everything has been good so far. As the person got off the elevator, the person joked, "yeah but it could be better, right?". Heck, even they know it's not a top notch hotel (or anything close). Again, for the right price, it is good for what it is, but don't expect too much. In fact, don't have any other expectations at all. Just a good night's sleep. But hey, you're in NY. You should be outside anyways.

<Title>“Great location, nice hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel 3030 for 5 nights in June and had a very pleasant stay. The hotel was in a great location and our room was clean and the kitchenette was a nice suprise. The staff on the front desk varied but most were friendly and helpful. The bed was not the best but after a long day exploring manhattan you will fall asleep in no time. The breakfast was not great with only 3 choices. A very good hotel and would definately stay again.

<Title>“Best location ever - disappointing room”
<Content>We've stayed at the Thirty Thirty hotel for 6 nights in May and it was our second booking at this hotel. Location... of the hotel is perfect - you cannot be better located if you want to discover Manhatten. If you walk out of the hotel and turn left, you are already in front of the Empire State Building and if you walk one block more you are standing on 5th Avenue. Cleanliness... is okay. Could be better when it comes to the towels, but the room & bathroom were always clean, which is very important in my opinion. Service... wasn't satisfying at all. The reception stuff is not that friendly except the lady at the concierge. The concierge could reserve tables at restaurants and give information about the city, which was great. As we checked out, we paid cash - as I returned home I had to notice that there was a pending security deposit of the whole amount on my credit card, which was unnecessarily blocking my limit! Very rude... as a guest I have the right to be informed about it, but I wasn't at no time. I've called the stuff there and had to sent them an E-Mail. After one day, I called again to ask if they could already solve it - the answer was very unfriendly, "no, I had no time to do it until now"... totally unacceptable! I filled out a servey of the hotel online back home and received at least an E-Mail of the hotel manager, appologizing for the circumstances. Value... is I have to admit unbeatable. The rates are fair - you get more, than you pay. Rooms... were kind disappointing this time. We stayed at Thirty Thirty last year in April and had booked a Standard Room. This time, we booked a Superior Room as we found a great offer on the homepage of the hotel. Unfortunately, the Superior Room was very tiny, it was dark and moreover, the first time I've flushed the toilet there was a huge pluggig - not very Superior Room if you ask me. Last year we booked a Standard Room we even had a kitchenette in it! So the relation of the room categories is not very comprehensible. Sleep Quality... was good - the beds were very comfortable and we slept very well. In summation, the hotel is good value and best location ever, rooms & service are average. I hope I would help you with this review as I am reading a lot about hotels on tripadvisor.com!

<Title>“The Thirty Thirty is a real find!”
<Content>I am always looking for a great price on a NY hotel without sacrificing the qualities important to me. The Thirty Thirty was a very nice surprise. The location on E 30th between Madison & Park is terrific. The lobby is beautiful, the staff very helpful and friendly and the adjacent restaurant is nice with open patio seating. The rooms are tiny, which is why you can get a great deal. But I had an adorable sweet little bedroom of a room with upscale linens, feather pillows, a very clean upgraded bathroom with a shower massage showerhead, nice soaps - all the things I like - for $155 prepaid in advance including all taxes! That cannot be beat. The manager took the time to inquire whether I was satisfied as I was checking out, a nice touch. I am recommending this hotel to all my friends and will definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Students safety”
<Content>My daughter is doing an off campus program with other students from Savannah School of Art and Design (SCAD) in New York City ,staying at Hotel Thirty Thirty. First, our welcome reception was not good. The students had pre arranged the hotel with the organizers from the school's administration office at (SCAD). When we arrived at our assigned room, it had one double bed for 2 students. We call front desk and they continued to question if we were sure there is one bed. We went down stairs and the front desk manager went up to check (guess they did not believe us). The next day my daughter and roommate were moved to a different room at her request. What really disappointed me with this supposedly "safe" hotel is that on Friday morning, my daughter came out the bathroom; with her roommate sleeping, to find 2 gentlemen in their room that was assigned by front desk. What a careless mistake. My daughter informed Front desk immediately. I have come to the conclusion that front desk did not follow the correct procedures in moving their registration to the new room. Since wish, the General Manager and I have had a discussion, and he reassured me he would call my daughter and offer her and her roommate dinner. He did not called, but my daughter called him to decline the dinner and have free internet for the duration of her stay instead. This was granted. Since which, I emailed the general Manager about how poorly this situation was handled by his front desk manager Katya and himself. Another disappointment was the professors were not informed; like I was made to understand by the General Manager, my daughter informed them. The General Manager promised to follow up with me and to date June 14 Th 2010, I have not heard from him or anyone from the Hotel. I am disgusted and feel that the school needs to revise the Hotel they use for there off campus program, for the safety of their students. This could have been an unfortunate experience, but thank God it was uneventful.My daughter was shaken up .Nevertheless; the girls seem to have decided to continue the program ,this is their last week and my daughterâ€™s last stay there ever. Safety of the guest should be their first priority. This experience has not convinced me. Avery Emery (Bermuda)

<Title>“Depressing decoration good location expensive bill”
<Content>This hotel is very well located, at 10 minutes by step from Times Square. The bed is comfortable and the household is made everyday. But sometimes the towels were dirty with stains of coffee or gaps. The room is very small and the decoration is depressing, it's dark, with little equipments. If you are courtyard side, the view is not pleasant. The air conditioning is too noisy and if you stop it, you will miss air! The internet access is charged. To finish, at the check out, my bill was with an amount of 1,052 $ for 6 nights but at the end the hotel took 1,440 $ on my banking account! So, foresee 400$ more! We never know!

<Title>“Great Location, good value for a city hotel”
<Content>We checked in before midday on a Saturday and the hotel staff at the front desk were smiley and helpful. We checked out on the Monday and left our bags with the porter until around 3pm. The hotel has an entrance at the front and the back - it is a 2 minute walk to the nearest subway and there are often cabs passing. It is a short walk to the Empire State Building and we walked to the hotel from Penn Station. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and nice. The only thing that doesn't work (mentioned in another review) is the duvet sandwiched between 2 sheets on the bed...these should be changed to use either blankets with sheets or duvet covers! There are no tea and coffee facilities in the room (not an issue for us). I thought the wifi was very expensive at $14 per 24 hours. I would stay here again definitely.

<Title>“Excellent Service - delayed delivery FOUND!”
<Content>Dropped into NYC after the NY Bar in Albany. This is a great location, close to the subway. Large comfortable bed and awesome value. Was expecting a fedex package to arrive at the hotel but the snow storm hit which delayed everything. Hotel staff received the package and sent it across to CA for me. Was an important package, much appreciated! Andre Simmons (from Hotel 30 30) went what I believed, to be above and and beyond his duty to help me out. Will return just on that basis. Thanks.

<Title>“Stylish appearance but a total disaster”
<Content>In the week we spent there we had all kind of problems: wireless did not work, the room safe did not work, the lock did not work, etc... in general the hotel had the appearance of being nice and stylish but I think it has been remodeled very cheaply: every morning I could hear the shower of the next room, the sound insolation was really bad. The staff would finally work things out but in many cases I found certain reluctance to help. And even though I am not picky at all, the cleanliness of the room was questionable: a couple of times I even found two pillows on the floor, an evident sign that they had just barely done the bed (and forgot two of the pillows on the floor) and that's it. The bathroom was dirty. From my experience in NY, there are indeed better deals for this prices.

<Content>We just love the warm friendly atmosphere - it's like a small town hotel with the sophistication of a big city hotel! The rates are easy on the budget without sacrificing quality - way ahead of other choices in this price range! The "breakfast included" package is a great deal as you can then skip lunch (or just snack) and save your appetite for one of NY's fabulous dinner restaurants! The staff is very accomodating and you feel like they actually care that you enjoy your stay with them! The location is great - walking distance to many of the city's attractions.

<Title>“Over priced for what hotel has to offer”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel from April 26th to May 6th. Paid â‚¬2000 for a 10 night stay and feel the hotel is way over priced for what it has to offer. Will not be staying again and would not recommend it. Paid extra for a superior room as having looked at pictures of standard rooms and previous reviews on TA I wanted to be able to have some space in the room. Good points: clean room, location of hotel, helpful concierge. Bad points: booked a 2 bed room for me and my elderly mother. At check in I was advised only 1 bed room available but another 2 bed room may become available. In the 10 nights we were there we had to sleep in the same bed. Reception never contacted us to move us to a 2 bed room. At check in asked TWICE about breakfast (which was included in our rate) and was told just walk into breakfast room but I knew there was something about vouchers from a previous post on TA and the following morning en route to breakfast room asked again and was advised we needed vouchers!! How the vouchers worked was not explained to us, the breakfast staff had to explain it to us. There is no information in the room to tell you anything about the hotels facilities, any hotel Iâ€™ve ever stayed in, in any country and other cities throughout America have an information booklet in the room. I only found out there was an ice machine on my floor as I could hear it from my room every time someone used it. No pay per view movies â€“ there was 1 or 2 nights we returned to the room relatively early and would have liked to watch a movie but this is not available at this hotel! Loads of news and weather channels are! Even though there were 2 windows in our room and 4 lamps the room was very dark and the lighting even in day light was very poor. Breakfast â€“ when breakfast is included in the rate you have to choose between 3 types of breakfast â€˜within the boxâ€™. The service was a joke. After the second morning of breakfast we would have not continued eating there but we had paid for it so we had to eat there. The staff kept getting the order wrong most mornings, eggs wouldnâ€™t be cooked the way you asked for them, ice when you asked for no ice, tea wouldnâ€™t be given etc. Breakfast every morning was a frustrating experience. Every morning the â€˜service taxâ€™ bill would be placed on the table in a black wallet, one morning we left the money on the table before they produced the black wallet. We were waiting in the lobby for the elevator when the waiter came running up to us waving the black wallet in the air shouting â€˜you didnâ€™t payâ€™. We stood there in complete shock and informed him the money was on the table. At this time I am waiting for a reply from the hotel as to why there are 2 different transactions on my visa card from the hotel on 2 different dates. I have emailed and rang but no response yet. I notice they are very quick to answer peopleâ€™s reviews on TA. Will be returning to NYC next year with my husband and will not be staying at the 30 30. Spend your money elsewhere in the city.

<Title>“Excellent location, great value”
<Content>My sister and I stayed at the Thirty Thirty Hotel last weekend. We were in town for a concert and got a special rate through the band's fan club, so maybe I'm biased by the low price we got ($169 per night), but I had a fantastic experience with this hotel. Our room was clearly upgraded from what we had expected or booked; we had a king-sized bed, a desk, a sofa, two tvs, more space than we needed, and one of the most beautiful bathrooms I've ever seen. I guess we just got lucky, but it truly was beautiful, especially considering the price and location. Every person we encountered was polite, courteous, and helpful. We really enjoyed how easy it was to walk anywhere- the location can't be beat. I will definitely stay at this hotel for my next NYC weekend getaway!

<Title>“An Unexpected Gem”
<Content>I travel to NYC at least twice a year on business and frequently tack on several extra days as it is one of my favorite cities to visit. The expense of all of those extra days on my own dime can add up pretty quickly, so I am always on the hunt for an inexpensive hotel so that I can spend more of my hard-earned money on great food and shows and such. This was my first visit to Thirty Thirty Hotel. I was really impressed from the moment I walked into the beautiful lobby. A couple of other reviewers felt it was dark, but the vibe I got was more "swanky modern". Every time I passed a hotel employee in a hallway or the lobby, they always greeted me and had a smile on their face. Not something you expect from a hotel that is relatively inexpensive. As one normally expects in a town like NYC (or Chicago), the room itself was small, but more than enough room for me and my partner. The bathroom was of average size, but there was a bathtub, which you don't often find in a lot of NYC hotels. Although they did not provide a luggage rack, I simply used the ironing board as a perch for my suitcase inside the closet, which was very large by most standards. The TV was rather small, but when you are in a fab city like NYC, you probably shouldn't be watching too much TV! I tend to sleep in rather late and sometimes do not leave my room until 2pm. Often this means that housekeeping has to skip my room (which does not bother me). I was surprised (and very pleased) that on the two days I did not leave my room until late afternoon, my room had been cleaned while I was out. One of my favorite things about this hotel is the location. You are less than 4 blocks from two different subway lines, which take you just about everywhere you might want to go, mostly without a single transfer to a different train. The only downside is that internet in the room is wires and is $15 a day. If they added free wireless, that would be perfect. One wonders if those reviewers that had complaints might have somewhat unrealistic expectations because I have nothing but good things to say about this wonderful hotel.

The hotel is located on a really good location so you don't need a car to drive to many of Big Apple's attraction! I liked the restaurant 'Zana' which is right next to the hotel. The stuff over there was superb too,the food was excellent! I would definitely recommend both places to a friend. I'm going to be back there for sure on my next visit to NYC!!! TONI

<Content>Stayed here from April 15th - April 19th. When we arrived we were welcomed with a hello and a smile and was told loads of people couldnt get to them due to the volcano. Only one room was ready so we dumped our bags and went out. Went to the empire state building which was like a 5 min walk...maybe not even that! Then went on a tour bus around new york which was brilliant! The beds in the room were so comfy! Just what you need after walking around New York all day & all night! The hotel has a bar/ place to eat & a gift shop. We didnt use either of these. The gift shop was expensive. $14.99 for a 1 <3 ny tshirt...when i got mine for $3.99 down the road. We went to watch the New York Yankees play too. I would recommend this to everyone! Its so easy to get to Yankee stadium too! I would stay here again due to its brilliant location and comfy beds!

<Title>“Kinda disappointing”
<Content>I'm actually in my hotel room right now. Traveling on business, I think I have one of the small rooms mentioned in a previous post. The lobby is quite nice but it seems to end there. Check-in took a little while as they only had one person at the front desk. The room is small but that's OK, I'm in NY and its to be expected. The hotel is older and hasn't been well cared for. The room is very bland, you can hear everything going on outside. There is a nice desk in the room but the internet cable is at the nightstand near the bed. Now Im sitting in a chair, next to the bed to get the internet after spending $14 for access. The tv is small (20 inches or so), the grout in the bathroom is dirty (just shows the long term neglect) and the room is just plain sterile feeling. I would think there has to be better places to stay for the same price. At least cleaner and more orderly.

<Title>“Good hotel, could've been better”
<Content>3030's Lobby was a welcome sight, nice and contemporary with plenty of staff around, a few couches and a nice row of payphones and computuers to access emails and make calls handily. We were happy to be there until they told us they were overbooked and thus could not give us our queen bed room (which we had pre paid for over a month in advance), instead we were offered a room with two single beds and told to come back to the lobby the next day to switch. We accepted this and went upstairs to our clean and tidy room. The location of the 3030 is great, close to everything you will want to look at in Midtown and handily near Penn Station. The second day we went down to the lobby to get our room swapped to the one we booked. We were told to go get our things from our other room, bring everything down to the lobby, check out - and then they would re-check us in again to the new room - and we could take our things back up to the new room. We were only there one night and were more interested in seeing New York than mucking about with the hotel, so decided to just tough it out with the two single beds instead of wasting our time going up and back again and again. Thirty Thirty was a good hotel, I would recommend it to people as apart from our room issue there were no other problems. Having said that, I doubt I will stay there again, we got a special deal but had I paid full ticket price I would've felt a little let down - even if they had've got my room booking right.

<Title>“Great Location, very comfortable stay, Friendly staff”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at Thirty Thirty for 1 week, our flight had been delayed so we arrived close to midnight, tired and cold.. The front line staff were very nice to deal with - we even got upgraded for free which was awesome. We stayed on the 12th floor - nice clean comfortable room, king bed. There wasn't a view apart from onto other rooms and fire escapes but thats why you get out and about in New York! We didn't have any trouble with noise at night although the heating and airconditioning unit was a little loud. The best part of thirty thirty we found was the location...right around the corner from the subway plus some really good restaurants and cafes in any direction (esp californa kitchen on the corner which we ate at a number of times) there is a drycleaner and a tailor directly across the road - which we also used - reasonably priced. Walking distance to Empire State Building. There is an excellent deli/ shop 1 min walk away with the yummiest takeaway foods (hot sandwiches, salads e.t.c). This was our 2nd visit to New York but our first stay at thirty thirty and we found the location so great with so many great places to eat and shop at within walking distance that we will definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Good hotel, close to Empire State Building & 5th Avenue”
<Content>We have just returned from a short break to New York and stayed at this hotel. I travelled with my husband and two daughters (aged 21 & 18) so we had one double room and one twin. We were on the 6th floor and our daughters' room was at the front with a view to the street below. Ours was at the side and looked out onto a brick wall and windows of the next building, but this didn't really matter as we weren't in the rooms much due to sightseeing, shopping etc! Our room wasn't very spacious but was adequate and the only storage was a small cupboard for hanging clothes plus 2 drawers. The bathroom though was huge with bath/shower, WC, sink and shelves. Our daughters' room was more spacious but with a tiny en-suite, though they didn't mind. However they had hardly anywhere to put clothes - only a small cupboard with hanging rail. They therefore lived out of their suitcases, but it wasn't a huge problem as we were only there 4 nights. This was our first visit to the States and we had heard about the friendliness of the visitor service sector. However, our check-in was not particularly friendly - we received rather abrupt service from one of the lady receptionists. Other than that, the Reception staff were generally happy to help and answer questions, give advice etc. I would be happy to stay at the Thirty Thirty again as there isn't anything really negative to say about the hotel. The beds were comfy and the showers lovely and powerful. The only downside was the lack of clothes storage in the twin room - it would have been nice for the girls to have even a small drawer unit in which to put a few things. That said, it was close to several attractions - 5 mins to Empire State building/5th avenue, 10 minutes to Macy's. Good diner just around the corner for breakfast (called Tasty's). The hotel does have a restaurant but we chose to go out for our meals.

<Title>“Clean, well located and great value!”
<Content>We have just returned from our stay at thirty thirty and a fabulous time in NYC. We wanted to stay in greenwich village but just couldn't warrant the extra cost so on fellow tripadvisors advice we opted for hotel 30 30 which was fantastic value for money. it is in a great midtown location, easily walkable from times square, Macy's, penn station etc but not too in the midst of all the action of times square. it has bars and restaurants nearby and plenty of delis etc (bread & butter on park ave was a fabulous 24 hours deli/cafe serving pizza, paninis, pasta, salad bar etc etc). 28th street metro station was just 2 blocks away on park ave and other lines were within walking distance to reach other areas of manhattan. our room was a spacious double with a view of the empire state building. the bed was comfy with an excellent bathroom. overall, a fantastic stay at thirty thirty and would highly recommend it. just one very minor point - some posts have mentioned a coffee maker in their room. unfortunately we didn't have this and it would have made our stay perfect. even a coffee machine in the lobby would have met our morning caffeine needs!!! happy travels nathsal

<Title>“Enjoyable Stay”
<Content>I want to share that we enjoyed our stay in New York, the hotel 30 30 was perfect. Great location, friendly staff, nice room, fantastic maid service every day, friendly staff, anything you needed or wanted, they was there to help and sort. Staff helped book trips, show us the way to places and accommodate everything you needed. We was wary after reading some remarks of this hotel from other reviews but I dont know why some people leave such remarks, it was great and ideal for the price we paid. Would recommend hotel to anyone and also stay here. Great location to access NY and the attractions.

<Title>“Great Hotel & Great Location!”
<Content>Hotel Thirty Thirty is a great hotel - and great hotels can be hard to find, especially in New York City. One of the best features of this hotel is the spacious rooms. My boyfriend and I had plenty of room to lounge, get ready in the mornings and do some work on the computer - without tripping over each other! NYC hotel rooms can be extremely tiny with barely enough space for the bed, this is definitely not the case at 30/30. There was even a separate area with a couch, TV and desk! The hotel is located in a fantastic location, right of Park Ave. Conveniently located between two popular subway stations, which makes getting to virtually every part of the city a snap. Plus, itâ€™s close to Time Square â€“ a short walk â€“ but not smack in the middle of the chaos. The staff was very friendly and helpful; providing maps of the city, subway advice and help ordering dinner. Overall a great NYC hotel experience! I would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“it's all about the room at the 30-30 -- some suck, others are great”
<Content>I love the 30-30, preferentially stay there when I'm in NYC, which is a couple times a month. Here's the little secret: it's all about the room you get. The petite rooms are horrible: tiny, barely enough room to turn around in, make budget rooms in european hotels look large. If you pay the extra for one of the bigger rooms, the hotel is great. Quiet, comfortable, etc. And location can't be beat: walking distance from penn station, subways on both sides of the city in easy reach, across the street from a great pub. Just get the right room or don't complain ;)

<Title>“I had a wonderful time!”
<Content>The hotel was in an EXCELLENT location to get around. Within walking distance of many attractions, subways, taxis etc. I had everything I could have wanted in my room - bathroom, hairdryer, internet access, TV, safe, fridge, coffee machine etc. I found the staff very helpful and nothing was ever too much trouble. There is always someone around the lobby to help you. They also have a tourism desk which is very useful. There is a restaurant in the hotel which I did not try. There is a 24 hour deli across the road that has a wide selection. I used a taxi from LGA Airporti which cost about $30 and took less than 30 minutes (this included paying a toll). There is a bus that does it's rounds (cheaper) but takes about 90 minutes. The hotel is older and has been done up but I had absolutely no problems and would go back again without hesitation.

<Title>“would stay their again”
<Content>my daughter and i was welcomed with a warm friendly smile and was always greeted in the same way every day. staff are really friendly and if you have any problems with your room they were dealt with quickly and efficiently. i had read a few negative things about the hotel and staff but our stay was a very positive one, and the central location of the hotel made it an ideal place to stay whilst visiting new york. I would use the hotel again. This was my first visit to New York and if you have never been i would highly recommend Century 21 for great deals if you are shopping for designer bargins, also book the Woodbury Common shopping coach trip, you need a whole day their, take loads of money, it is so worth it. Also enjoyed dinner at Ruby Tuesday`s in Time Square. My only disappointment was with Hard Rock Cafe, the menu is not vast and the food wasonly just ok. We saw West Side Story which was great and we were advised to ask for PLUM DEALS when booking ticket, we got $91.50 seats for $60.00.

<Content>I booked the 30 30 through the internet and got a great deal. At the rate I got, all the features of the hotel were excellent. For the price they list, I would still consider it a worthwile stay. I booked a "petite single", and it was really not very big, but had a very comfortable bed, two windows, and a very well equipped bath with a great shower you could invite friends to! Nice decoration, nice staff and service, I will surely come again.

<Title>“Enjoyable Stay at this Pet friendly hotel”
<Content>My stay at pet friendly Thirty Thirty was very enjoyable. I stayed 4 nights in a single petite room on 11th floor and it was the perfect size for me and my small dog to rest our weary heads after exploring New York City. The room is very small, but it had a nice slate bathroom, 2 large windows, and the housekeeper was super friendly and she did an awesome job in cleaning my room daily. The location can not be beat. The short 15 or 20 minute walk to Greenwich Village was very enjoyable. Times Square is even closer than that to the hotel. The staff was awesome. They greeted us warmly every time they saw us. My only small complaint (and it is nothing major), but I wish the hotel had a ramp so that we can wheel our luggage right in instead of carrying it up three or four steps. I am already planning on when I can return to NYC and I will definitely stay at the Thirty Thirty again!

<Title>“This hotel was an oasis in the desert.”
<Content>We spent this past weekend in NYC and stayed at this hotel. I booked it through cheaphotels.com, so we weren't exactly certain what to expect. The price for the days we were there was exceptionally inexpensive for NYC, so we decided to give it a try. The hotel is very contemporary, the lobby is beautiful, and the rooms were all we could have asked for. The only down side to our stay was that it was very warm outside and they had not turned on the a/c yet, but we were able to open the windows and were comfortable. We have not one negative thing to say about this hotel and would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Nice Hotel”
<Content>For a budget New York hotel we found the Thirty Thirty very good value. Staff were pleasant, room was small but clean and adequate. Who goes to New York to stay in there room? It had a view of the Empire State Building which was a bonus. Didn't witness any of the things which feature in the bad reviews for this hotel. Maybe some people were expecting the Waldorf!! The only thing that would have improved it was a late bar. There is Zizzi's which is joined on but it closes about 11pm. I've lways wanted to see New York at Christmas time and the Thirty thirty was a great base. Close to Macey's and the Empire State building and a short taxi ride to the Rockerfeller Plaza which at that time of year is well worth a visit and an even shorter walk to Times Square. Cant wait to go back to New York and would happily stay at the Thirty Thirty again.

<Title>“Thirty Thirty Fire & Ice”
<Content>My stay with Thirty Thirty was for five days and was my second time visiting NYC. Given I was out and about most of the time I really just needed a private room with a bathroom and this is what you get. A petite single room is a room with a single bed - the hotel should specify that it has a single bed when booking (I checked everywhere and this was not mentioned) - very concerning for someone who is 6'2. Reception staff were initially welcoming and mostly helpful wherever possible. Only downfall was that they did not have umbrellas to provide guests with - and with the crazy weather that NYC has been having, a bit poor. I was generally pleased with my room except for two things. First was the paper thin walls. I could hear the guest in the next room snoring - grose! I used earplugs for that. The second thing I felt a bit helpless about though, the first morning I woke up in the morning with a itch on my leg, unfolding the covers of the bed revealed a cockroach running within the sheets! This made me feel extremely uneasy about how many other roaches might be close by!! Having not wanted this to ruin my stay in NYC, I decided not to throw a tantrum but instead be more civilised and mention it in my review.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>Great modern hotel a stones throw away from empire state. We had a twin room was spacious enough has mini kitchen with all appliances needed and complimentary tea/coffee restock every day. We had a great nights sleep every night-which was 8 in total. Staff were friendly enough and helped if you needed. Read somewhere about dodgy lookin people hangin around the hotel and something about perminent residents who live on top floor causing problems however I did not notice this and am askin myself if this actually true...think it may well be very picky people that spent far too much time in the hotel observing like an M15 spy...god ur in new york should only be in the hotel to sleep!lol for people with walkin problems or older guests it is quite a walk to times square etc so mayb would suggest somwhere closer. However we at 26yr and 53yr took 15mins. If ur lookin for total luxury stop bein tight and shell out the extra cash on a top notch hotel rather than complain on here and put other normal folks off a decent clean hotel.

<Content>I reserved months in advance. They only had a smoking room when I arrived. I'm in it now, as I write this on my iPhone. It's tiny, gray, and has a view of a wall. The remote control doesn't work. There are no cups. There's a coffee machine, but no coffee. When I spread my arms wide, I can almost touch opposite walls. There are much better hotels in ny for the money. Go to one of those.

The hotel's location is a bonus it is central to all the sights and subway stations. :-)

<Title>“would never go back”
<Content>Stayed in the hotel 4 nights Feb. When we arrived we were given 2 twin rooms-we had booked 2 double bed rooms. Ok I thought we can deal with this we are still in new york on the trip of a lifetime what does it matter, when we got to the rooms I was disappointed- room 602-I had a tiny cupboard with a rail to hang some clothes, no table, no chair, no drawers to put clothes so I slung a load of things outside the cupboard which I had no space for and got some sleep as it had been a long day. The room although shabby didnt appear very dirty so I just told myself we only need to sleep and shower in the rooms we will be out most of the day. Got up at 8, flushed the toilet and stood at the sink cleaning my teeth, it suddenly dawned on me my feet were wet-Iooked down and realised in horror that the toilet was overflowing at an alarming rate, I phoned down to reception and waited whilst chucking every towel and bed linen I could find down to try and soak some of the flood. I then phoned reception again as no.one had arrived, they finally stopped the flood which at that time was heading to the corridor, and covered under my bed and under half the other bed in the room. I then realised it had gone into the clothes cupboard and soaked everything on the floor-this wouldnt have been so bad if the water wasnt BROWN and every towel and linen I had thrown down had gone brown too. The guy came to soak up the water and begin the clean up process, another member of staff then says oh rm 17 flooded 3 days ago. I was so upset at the start of my nyc adventure I went down to reception and asked pls cd I get a new room, I got no apology and a sour faced receptionist who told me they were full and to try later!! I appreciate they may have been full but an apology would have been a gd start. Without wanting to spend a day of the 4 we had moving hotels I went back to the room asked the guy cleaning to give me 30 minutes, I packed my dry stuff up and stored in my friends room. I took all my disgusting stained clothes to the cleaners opposite the hotel(a fraction of hotel prices by the way) and we went off to begin our hol. When I got back to the hotel I was then given another room- it had a bath plus shower, double bed and plenty of drawers etc for storage-and I felt much better :) My friend remained on floor 6 where someone died the next day and he heard them outside his room talking about putting down talc for the smell(I can only assume this was a live in resident as the maid would have found a holiday maker before the smell). I began to think floor 6 was one to avoid ha ha. I love new york and cant wait to go back, the hotel is in a good location and I slept very well but apart from that I couldnt stand never quite feeling clean in the hotel and would never go back. There are hotels everywhere. I always read TA and guess either I was unlucky or the other guests were lucky-whichever way you look at it its too much of a risk for me to rely on luck for the feel of a clean room and a bit of storage.

<Title>“Good value, good location -- recommended”
<Content>My wife, daughter (14) and son (10) stayed in a Deluxe Family Room on the second floor and â€“ after having seen some REALLY small hotel rooms in NYC â€“ we were delighted by how big the room was. Two double beds, and a sleeper sofa â€“ and still lots of room to walk around with the sleeper open. Very high ceiling. Nice bathroom (with a great shower). Near the elevators but couldn't hear them. Only minor complaints: needed more places to lay out clothes (we pretty much had to operate out of our suitcases) and toilets really should have lids. We had two separate requests to the front desk â€“ for extra towels, and later for extra blankets â€“ and response was prompt. Concierge desk very helpful too in helping guests plan their excursions. Location is great. Away from the main Manhattan noise but you can quickly get anywhere. (Subway two blocks away will get you up to Grand Central in no time.) Short walks to MSG, Empire State Building. Park just down the street at a Rapid garage on E. 30th and get a Thirty-Thirty discount. We did their "Sunday NYC" special and got free breakfast at the adjacent Zana's cafe. (Not just muffins; but choice of eggs, pancakes and french toast.) It may not be an elegant 5-star but you can do MUCH worse. We would certainly stay at Thirty-Thirty again.

<Title>“Just what you need - Good Hotel”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and it was ideal. The bedroom itself was a little on the small side but for the amount of time your in it, it was very comfortable with a decent sized bathroom! The location was excellent! When you stand outside the hotel go left cross two streets and look right, and there in front of you is The Empire State Building and 5th Avenue - which if you walk all the way up takes you to Central Park and all the mains shops I.E Tiffanyâ€™s, Prada, H & M, Gucci - the lot! No downside to the hotel at all except I like a good cuppa tea and there was no tea & coffee facilities in the room and the maid comes very early.

<Title>“Great location and a great place to relax”
<Content>I visited New York City for 5 days in the middle of January, and all I wanted in a hotel was warmth, a comfortable bed, and a close walk to a subway stop. Hotel Thirty Thirty had all three. Since there were only two of us, the size of the room wasn't a problem at all. I booked a Standard room with a queen-sized bed. The room and the hotel were clean, not a problem there. The staff was very accommodating as I arrived in the city early in the morning, and they gladly checked to see if I could check-in early. My last day, they were also happy to store my baggage past the check-out time before my flight in the afternoon. The feel of the hotel is trendy, but simple, without being pretentious at all. It's in a great neighborhood with the Empire State Building only 2 blocks away. I didn't feel unsafe at any time. I made a booking only a week and a half in advance and was able to get a reasonable rate because of their different specials and packages. I would absolutely recommend this hotel to my friends.

<Content>I booked this hotel for $96 on quickbook.com and wasnt expecting very much. When I checked in, the room was very shabby and beat up. The room had a lingering odor of cigarette smoke and body odor and must. The remote control didnt work and i was unable to hook up to the internet, which is via an ethernet cable for $14.99 a day. Luckily, I was able to upgrade to a much better room on a higher floor. The difference between rooms was night and day. Lovely bed, large room, clean smelling and a nice slate shower. I am booked again in March for $96, but i am thinking very hard if I can bear to stay in the lower quality room. I think for the extra money, I will stay at a different hotel with wireless free internet.

<Title>“great price,great location,small roaches.”
<Content>hotel thirty thirty is in a great mistown manhatten location.it's a great place if you dont plan on spending much time in your hotel (why would you in new york?) I'm sure our experience would have been better ,but we asked for a smoking room when we arrived so we were moved to a tiny shoebox of a room;made all the more cramped thanks to the many cockroaches already occupying the space. The room was cleaned daily to a decent level. Would be happy to stay there again mind you as it was cheap and central.

<Title>“Ideal for City Break, value for money, good location”
<Content>We booked here because of location and value for money. We wanted to spend our $ on the sights of NYC and not on our accommodation. We stayed here 4 nights last week. We were not looking for a luxury room or hotel. We spent 95% of our time in NY City enjoying the sights. Room was smaller then the average UK hotel but it did not spoil a great trip. Bed was large and comfortable, Shower and bathroom were fine, coffee maker was ok, TV fine. The hotel staff and concierge were very helpful. We booked an airport transfer for our return trip which was actually $30 cheaper then our taxi on arrival. Left luggage very useful for last day check out and no hidden charges. Hote is ideal for sight seeing, 10mins walk from Empire State. We also walked to Madison Square Garden, it was a good 20 minute walk but meant not queuing for a taxi or the subway after the game which was extremely busy at the end. We didnt eat at the restaurant in the lobby or have breakfast there so we cannot comment on that but there are plenty of choices outside the hotel.

<Title>“I would go there again”
<Content>The hotel was quite near a subway station so you needn't take a cab to get there. When we arrived the stuff at the reception desk were very polite and helpful. I booked a standard single room which I knew it would be small but I really didn't mind that at all because I was happy to see that it was spotless and very clean! It had a comfortable bed, a nice (not small) bathroom and also a nice view to a back yard but I love this New York look! It was being cleaned everyday, the cleaning stuff were also very polite and discrete. The location was fantastic, within 5 mins walking I was under the Empire State Building. There are some good places to eat around it and a lovely restaurant for breakfast (or meals) right down the hotel (Zana's). The area was safe. Overall the hotel complemented to a wonderful stay in New York. I would definately recommend it. Plus, if you book early you can find a good price, it was 40% off when I booked 3 months in advance.

<Title>“Great location and helpful staff”
<Content>Very satisfied. The best about this hotel is certainly its location. Close to Penn Station, subway, major attractions in Manhattan, Staff is quite helpful and friendly. If you have to checkout but still have time to roam, you can check-in your luggage at the front desk just for a tip. Nothing special in the hotel itself though =) But who cares? It's New York!

<Title>“Basic, clean and good value”
<Content>I was worried about some of the reviews I read here about this hotel. I stayed 4 nights in a single bed room. Yes, the room is small but it was fine. It was clean, comfortable, QUIET, and very good value. It contained a slate bathroom, a closet with a safe, an iron and ironing board. I'd rather have a room for sleeping and showering and spend my money on entertainment in the Big Apple! The location couldn't be better. Quite safe. You can stroll to Grand Central. Subway is 2 short blocks away. I will stay here again.

<Title>“Good value for weekend in Manhattan”
<Content>My husband and I went into the city to celebrate an anniversary. The hotel is within walking distance of Penn Station which is handy since we take the train a lot into the city. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 10th floor. The bedding was light but warm - no bedspread. They could use new blankets, however. The towels were white and fluffy. The room was clean, but could use some sprucing up - paint, etc. The window could be opened which was nice for fresh air which we like at night. It was quiet. As we entered the room, we could smell smoke which was covered over by a canned fragrance. I would expect that a non-smoking room would not ever have smoke. In addition, a guest three doors down the hall, came out of her room, smoking. She was gathering her cats who were in the hallway! The soap didn't lather well and the toilet itself was very low with no grab bar for older travelers. Breakfast was included in our reasonable Sunday night stay.

<Title>“Hotel Thirty Thirty Is My Second Home.”
<Content>Iâ€™m a frequent visitor to NYC and have stayed at a few different hotels but have to admit that Hotel Thirty Thirty has been my favorite â€“ hands down. Between its convenient location to its affordable rates and excellent staff, it makes staying elsewhere not even an option. The Location is within walking distance to The Empire State Building, Macyâ€™s and many other stores for great shopping and dining. I have always compared rates prior to booking and have yet to find a better rate elsewhere, especially in the Midtown area. The rooms are both spacious and extremely clean. Beds are comfortable and my favorite is the newer bathrooms. The staff was very friendly, providing quick check innâ€™s as well as check outâ€™s. They are very accommodating to your needs and making you feel at home. With being a frequent visitor I have grown to have a very good relationship with the staff as well as Hotel Manager Steve. Steve has gone above and beyond making sure I was completely satisfied every stay. Overall Iâ€™m a very big fan of Hotel Thirty Thirty and will continue to make it my second home with every visit to NYC.

<Title>“Very good location, would recommend”
<Content>Me and my girlfriend stayed at the thirty thirty hotel in New york between 19-24th december 2009. The hotel is very clean, the rooms are small but it is new york. We got a very good deal on the hotel and it was well worth the money. Reception was very helpful and when we had a problem with the heating in the room they fixed it in minutes even though it was 12am. The hotel is situated 5 minutes from the empire state building and close to the subway (but we tended to walk everywhere so that we didnt miss anything). There are restaurants near by but didnt got to any so couldnt comment. There are many cafes,food stops close to the hotel e.g. wendys,subway,dunkin doughnuts,burger kuing etc. New York was amazing and would recommend it to anyone. The thirty thirty was a decent hotel very well placed for all the sights and for the money i would stay there again, its not 5/4 star or anything but it is clean, friendly staff,and a great location. I would definatley stay here again.

<Title>“Hope to stay at the Thirty Thirty again - really soon!”
<Content>I'v stayed four times at the Thirty Thirty four hotel (last time was in May 2009). The staff has always been very friendly, especially the concierge is very helpful. The rooms are clean and although the size of the rooms we got in those four times differed quite a lot, they were all spacious enough for the couple of hours you're staying in the room. What I absolutely love about this hotel is the location, ESB is just around the corner (just like a lot of shops to fullfill a substantial amount of your shopping needs), and you can either walk to Central Park or even Greenwich Village. The hotel also delivers great value for your money. Hope to get back really soon!

<Title>“poor treatment from front desk”
<Content>On Dec. 29, myself and wife arrived at the hotel from Philadelphia. We had stayed the prior year and had a nice time. When we arrived we waited approx. 1 hr. which I could understand because of the time of year. When we got up to the room it had two single beds. I went downstairs and spoke to a young lady at the front desk and told her I had requested a room with a queen size bed. She told me nothing was available. I returned to the room and gave the good news to my wife. She spoke to the manager by phone. She (manager) said a request is for a room not for any particular bedding and she stated I had requested two double beds. My wife gave her the confirmation number and a copy of the request printout. The manager said if it's that big a deal she'll give us a room with a queen bed and huffed off. My wife thanked her and we moved. My only concern was what is the purpose of filling a request if it doesn't mean anything. It was our last time there only because of the treatment.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel & Location”
<Content>Stayed here 24th, 25th, 26th & 27th over xmas, great location. We had room 1205 top floor, had an excellent view of Empire State, room was smallish but had an excellent bed which was cjhanged every day with clean fresh sheets, TV plenty of storage/wardrobe space, a safe,a nice clean toilet shower and sink area. Room was walm and cozy and after all your only in there to sleep. Note the electronic door swipe keys seemed to pack up if throuigh the day you had been sight seeing and have gone through an xray or scanner machine like the one at the ferry crossing point for the SOL or for the rockerfeller anyway just bob down to reception and they re-programme it. Breakfast next door was v good and the brasserie opposite was great, hunt round though, eat off the normal tourist routes or do what we did, turn right outta hotel and go to Susies Kitchen on the corner, eat at the Green Delis the food is excellent. One more piece of advice if you are using the cabs, write down the hotel address on a piece of paper and keep it ready to show the driver to avoid confusion of the address. Ignore th bad reports about the Thirty Thirty its an excellent 3* budget hotel. We will be back Shaun & Kim from Market Weighton England

<Title>“Excellent location!”
<Content>Stayed here on advice from travel agents who said it was popular and in the main area of New York. on arriving here, we noticed the Empire State Building just round the corner (2 blocks). It is walking distance to Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, Central Park, Broadway, and the UN HQ The facilities are ok, to be honest New York is about location, not little things like the size of the soap etc! The room services, staff and other areas of hotel are decent. There are shops just outside the hotel where u could buy groceries and snacks if u prefer to eat in (cheaper option) Overall, i would stay here again or at any other decent hotel in the area. Never underestimate the importance of the location!

<Title>“Excellent location, clean, friendly, great vlaue. You just have to stay here.”
<Content>We booked into the Thirty Thirty hotel after being given a choice of hotels through our travel agent (as we had won our trip through a competition). This was our first trip to NYC so we wanted it to be special. After booking I read some of the awful reviews that this hotel has had on here and we very disheartened. Fortunately the reviews seemed to get better towards the end of 2009. Ignore the bad reviews, they do not represent this hotel whatsoever - some people are too fussy. When we arrived we were greeted so warmly and promptly. The hotel is very clean and the lobby is comfortable and modern. Staff are always on hand to answer questions. The lobby has Internet access and laser printers so you can print out your e-tickets should you forget (as we did!!) Our room was on the 9th floor and had a view of the Empire State building. We had 2 single beds but there was plenty of space to store luggage and unpack clothes. The bathroom was very clean, and there were stacks of clean towels and shower/shampoo/soap that were replaced each day. We left a $3 tip each day for the maid which is very reasonable for such good standards of housekeeping. There was also an LCD tv in the room with a good selection of news channels. Onto the location, which is why we picked this hotel. This hotel is just perfect for location. 4 minutes walk from the subway on 28th street (the hotel has an entrance on 30th and 29th street [front/back] which makes things so much easier) and there is a 24 hour Duane Reade pharmacy and McDonalds at 28th Street too. A walk to the Empire State or Macy's takes about 6-8 minutes depending on how busy the pedestrian crossings are. You can walk to TImes Square and Rockefeller Centre in about 20 minutes but the subway was so much quicker. Buy a 1 day fun pass for $8.25 and you can take unlimited trips all day with no worries that you'll run out of credit. If you're looking for a cheaper hotel that doesn't compromise on convenience, style, quality and service then this is it. It provides a perfect retreat at night for getting rest, not much noise from traffic and plenty of hot water, towels etc. I will definitely be staying at 30 30 again should be get the chance to go back to NYC.

<Content>Arriving from a mid evening flight to JFK at Penn Station, the 30 30 is only a 10 muniute walk. Checking in was easy and the staff were very friendly. Although having requested a Twin Room, Sean (My 18yr old Son) & I were disappointed to find a Double bed instead....but your Double Beds are Huge - so this really wasn't an issue! We were just grateful to get our heads down after our flight! The adjacent diner was great value for money, serving breakfast through Evening Meals and comfotable Bar area, very clean and tidy and the Staff were very friendly and interested in our visit. We had a very enjoyable stay and I would definitely recommend this Hotel for location and value for money.

<Content>I would highly recommend this hotel - not only is it in a fantastic spot in Manhattan (walking distance to 5th Ave and the subway etc) but it's neat, tidy and a decent price. Our room had 2 single beds inside, I must admit it was much smaller than I expected, but it didn't bother us one bit - we're in New York, if you're going to spend extended amounts of time in your room, then you're crazy! So the tiny room suited us because all we did in there was sleep. It was clean and comfortable and was within our budget ($1000 for 5 nights - booked on expedia). I highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again.

<Content>Was given an extremely large room (corner room) w/ own sofa & table tv etc..although lighting didn't seem adequate enough for such a size. The decor is neutral and minimal even when you walk to reception and rooms but it was good that 24hr reception was available. The bathroom was probably really nice once renovated but is now in need of a spruce up. Location wise nothing much exciting to look around- lots of factory second outlets and souvenir shops. A good 15-20min walk to times square but subway is just around the corner. Not bad but would probably stay in Soho next time round. :)

<Title>“Nice surprise: clean and comfortable with good service”
<Content>In early November, my friend and I stayed two nights in Hotel Thirty Thirty, a small boutique hotel, offering sleek accommodations in a quiet location. What a find! Around the corner from Park Avenue and one block from the subway, we were able to metro to the museum district and Greenwich Village with relative ease. Times Square was nearby too and we felt it was safe to walk back to the hotel after a show and dinner. Hotel staff offered exceptional service. They were courteous, knowledgeable and efficient in helping me with accommodations and in directing me to the subway. The hotel lobby had a hip, minimalist design; the room was well-appointed and clean with comfortable beds with white down comforters and a small green velor couch to relax on after a day of walking and sightseeing. The bathroom was roomy and had wraparound tiling and simple lighting. Concierge service was immediately available on Sunday morning and held my overnight bag for me while I had breakfast in a nearby restaurant. Good value for small hotel. Recommend the hotel place another waste basket in the room near the desk. Also on the green front, recommend offering re-use towel program.

<Content>I stay at this hotel every time I travel to New York. Going elsewhere is not an option for me. The rooms are always clean, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I have never been disappointed when I stay at the Thirty Thirty. It is also located extremely well, being within walking distance from the Empire State Building, Times Square, 5th Ave, and Penn Station where I enter and depart the city. There is even a bar / restaurant connected to the lobby which is not common in every NYC Hotel, and there is a 24 hour food and convenience store right across the street for anything you might need during the night. I fully recommend this hotel to any NYC visitor, wether it be for business or pleasure.

<Title>“3030 is just great for the business traveler!”
<Content>I chose Thirty Thirty for my business trip to New York City mainly because of its great location and highly reasonable room rates. I was pleasantly surprised by the what the superior rooms had to offer at such a cost. The superior rooms are clean and big and equipped with all the basic amenities you would need, including free hi-speed internet connection on LAN. In sum, Thirty Thirty is sheer value for money and centrally located - near the crossing of Park Avenue and Madison Avenue - and so at a walking distance from the best restaurants and food joints - Italian, Indian, Chinese... not to speak of the attached diner that offers free breakfast to hotel guests and open till 11 pm for dinner. I would rate it higher than other high-end as well as low-end hotels like the Radisson or La Quinta in and around the same area. I stayed here for 10 days or more and would love to go back. I would recommend this to both the cost-conscious business traveler as well as the holiday maker on a tight budget.

<Title>“the room was shockingly small-no closet space, no sink in the bathroom, no free wireless internet”
<Content>just horrible. i walked in and when there were steps leading up to the reception area (ie no ramp) and no doorman let alone bell staff, I knew I was in trouble. The lobby and front desk staff were friendly so I thought that maybe my first impression was wrong. However, when I walked into the room and saw that the bed was the room, I was shocked. The sink was not in the bathroom, so when you are done using the toilet, you have to walk out to the room and if you forget to bring a towel with you, you have to walk back to the bathroom. The set up reminded me of a hospital room. Besides that, the housekeeping staff did not clean up the room until 5pm. We left for the day at 11am and thought that when we returned at 5, the room would certainly be ready for us to use. We were greeted by the maid who was embarrased and told us to go downstairs and report our complaint. When we finally got in our room, we wanted to find a restaurant on the net only to find out that we would be charged $14.99 a day to use their cable connection. Next horror occured about 8am when a man entered the room without knocking. Luckily, we heard him and yelled for him to leave. I assume he was a housekeeper. Just an overall, disappointing and horrific experience. I would not recommend this hotel to my worst enemy.

<Title>“perfect for the price”
<Content>myelf and my husband stayed there november 7th till 12th. After reading the previous reviews i was nervous about what was ahead of me in this hotel. Quite the contrary, the room and bathroom, while very small were clean and suited our needs perfectly. Who goes to NYC to sit in the bedroom!!! If you are realistic and not expecting a 1st clas hotle then this is a perfect location for your trip to the big apple....

<Title>“Look elsewhere”
<Content>Don't bother with this hotel. We stayed here after a New England cruise and were VERY DISAPPOINTED. My understairs cupboard is bigger!! There was no-where to put your suitcase, no drawers, no chair, not even a plastic glass for water!! The room was depressing as well as being tiny. The desk staff were nothing short of rude in fact the only helpful and pleasant person we dealt with was the bellboy. To add insult to injury it wasn't cheap.

<Title>“A lovely hotel in a great location.”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews on here I was slightly worried, I needn't have though. The Thirty Thirty is a nice hotel in a good area of Manhattan, close to local shops, bars, restaurants and subways, what more do you need in New york? 4 blocks from the Empire State Building, 1 block from the subway, dry cleaners, pub / restaurant and hairdressers across the road. The staff were helpful and friendly and the rooms, which were not massive, were nice, clean and presentable. The bathroom was massive and was clean and modern. I would recommend California Pizza Kitchen on the corner for food, which was superb. All in, we had a great trip to New York and the hotel was everything we needed and would not hesitate to stay here again.

<Title>“Great value, perfect location, you don't need anything else when in a city!”
<Content>This is a great find - please ignore the other reviews- they worried me unnecessarily. We had an enjoyable 5 night stay the first week of Nov 2009. > Bedroom: We booked the basic double. Yes it's small (but we're British so used to things being small!), but absolutely fine! Very clean, big bed (must have been at least a king), lovely linen, spacious fitted wardrobe, lovely bathroom with bath and shower. Bigger than our bathroom at home! > Location: perfect. We walked everywhere!!! Even back from the Guggenheim to the hotel (60 blocks away) - the Empire State is virtually at the end of the road so this became much like a homing beacon for us. Having walked most of Manhattan, I wouldn't have stayed anywhere else. The street is amazingly quiet for being in the centre of everything. We slept really well. And we also felt really safe - it's not in a dodgy area or anything. > Concierge: Really helpful - cant fault the service > Breakfast - we ate 3 times in the adjoining restaurant. $13 for a full breakfast with coffee & juice. Lovely, but you are paying hotel prices. We went twice to Jimmys Cafe just 3 mins walk away - on Madison Avenue, around 32nd street. $9 for full breakfast with coffee & juice. I would def stay here again, although New York is probably only a one time visit. If you want to laze around in a luxury hotel with a relaxing lounge/bar/swimming pool etc, then don't stay here. But then who would pay for a hotel like that in New York when you're out all day, seeing...New York! I don't go for budget hotels, so trust me - if you want to see New York, stay here and you'll sleep well after all that sightseeing!

<Title>“not for tall people”
<Content>the hotel is centrally located so most of the attractions are easily reached by foot.2 minutes from a subway station numerous yellow taxis though if needed.we checked in to the hotel at 11pm at night.found the receptionist pleasent and efficent.found our room and was horrified at how small the room was for 2 people let alone 3 people. the 2 single beds were child like in size.for anyone over 5 foot 10 inches your going to have problems with the bed size.the couch bed that was used by my 12 year old son reasembled a hospital trolley and was very uncomfortable.there was very little light in the room .the room had a good bathroom though with an excellant shower.not much storage space for clothes.it was well decorated.when went to finally settle down on the first night we found one of the beds broken.it was soon fixed though when we reported this.on waking up on the first morning the view was of a brick wall .hardly any natural light could get in and part of one of the windows was held together by gaffer tape.certainly not a family hotel freindly hotel.luckily only spent four nights there .apart from its location 2 minutes from the empire state building this hotel has no other redeeming factors.

<Title>“VERY Average Hotel”
<Content>The hotel was very average. When I arrived at my non-smoking room, I was overwhelmed by the stench of old cigarette smoke. I confirmed with the desk that it was in fact a non-smoking room. I went to hang my clothes in the closet, only to find the source of the smell--two large bags of garbage. I stopped by the front desk to request that it be removed while I was at dinner. Of course, after returning 3 hours later, it still had not been removed. Also, the shower is old and dirty--bring shower shoes! It seems that they put enough money in the lobby to make it look nice enough--but that is where the upgrades ended.

<Title>“This hotel is well below average”
<Content>The room i stayed in had so little space, the (single) bed had about 2 ft around two sides and the other two were up against the wall. The wet room shower had no shelving to hold toilet articles, and the wardrobe was miniscule. The experience was depressing and a huge disappointment considering the amount levied for a night's stay was USD 243. My colleagues' room was not clean and there were peanuts on the floor from the previous occupant. Try to avoid this hotel.

<Title>“Great hotel, great price, great location.”
<Content>I stayed at hotel Thirty Thirty for 4 nights. I travelled with a friend and 2 teenagers. This hotel is great and I would definitely stay there again. I was so worried after reading previous reviews, but i can say there was nothing wrong with the hotel. Because of the great location we were able to shop, drop off and shop again!! We had a double double room, which was a spacious room with 2 double beds. The bathroom was very modern. The room was clean and decor ok, not amazing just basic, but what more do you need for a 4 day trip. Trendy reception area. The toilet was blocked around 3.00am in the morning and within 5 mins someone came to our room to rectify the problem. The hotel staff at the reception, and concierge were plesant and extremly helpful. The only thing is the restaurant in the hotel is a little pricey $5 for a 1 liter bottle of water.

<Title>“Nightmare in Midtown”
<Content>Arrived late evening. Reception looked promising and almost boutique. Had booked a standard room at USD 209 a night. The room was awful. One third was taken up by a corridor behind the bathroom leading into the bedroom which was just big enough from the bed. The room smelt so bad that I didn't even bother venturing further. Receptionist agreed to upgrade me to a larger room. The room was sizable but decor was tired with some wallpaper coming away from the wall. Two televisions, one missing part of its front. Sofa looked dirty and floor had remnants of cashew nuts which had been dropped by a previous occupant. Floor was uneven whilst wardrobe, bedside table and other occassional furniture neither matched nor was in good condition. Bathroom was highspot with modern tiles and decent walk in shower but, even after washing, a few minutes in the dirty bedroom made me feel unclean. Nether cheap nor cheerful. Not a hotel to which I will ever return.

<Title>“Great hotel - Ignore the negative reviews”
<Content>After winning the hotel on Priceline, I was a bit worried about my stay after reading the negative reviews on Tripadvisor. Luckily the hotel was much better than expected. I canâ€™t comment on the regular rooms as we were upgraded to a deluxe room since there were no non-smoking, king-bed rooms available on the night we arrived. However, the upgraded room was excellent, very spacious for a NYC hotel. Everything was clean and comfortable, albeit a bit dated. There was no in-room safe. The bathroom was possibly the highlight of the room, very clean, stylish and modern. The location was convenient, near several subway stations (nearest was 28 St and Park Ave for the 6 Line, also 28 St and Broadway for the R and W) and is only a short walk to several restaurants, 24-hour pharmacies, and the Empire State Building. Essentially anywhere in Midtown Manhattan is within walking distance (i.e. a ~20 minute walk). I had very limited dealings with the staff, so I canâ€™t comment on them beyond saying that I found the service adequate. All in all, our stay was trouble-free with nothing to complain about. I booked through Priceline so the price was excellent. At their regular rates, there are better hotels though.

<Title>“A great hotel with great staff”
<Content>We just got back from our first trip ever to New York. We stayed at Thirty Thirty at the recommendation of friends. We were apprehensive a bit after reading some of the reviews on here. Were they ever wrong! The hotel was lovely as were the rooms and the staff. The rooms were spotless and the housekeepers always pleasant. Everyone was so friendly throughout the hotel and they were always willing to help with a smile. They was even a manager in the lobby at check out who went out of his way to inquire about our stay and to offer help and asked if we needed assistance with anything, even though we were checking out!! We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially if they want a conveniently located hotel to all the sites and shopping. We will definitely return.

<Title>“Excellent location”
<Content>We have just returned from a 4 night stay in the Thirty Thirty and were impressed by the hotel especially as there have been some questionable reviews on here. We were upgraded on check-in to a superior room. The room was big enough for us and our suitcases. It was basic but clean. The only negative being some noisy fans outside the window (we were in a room at the back of the building). Also, the staff were helpful with any questions we had. The best thing about the hotel is the location. It is within walking distance of the Empire State Building, Macys and Times Square. It was perfect as a base for our trip and I would recommend it to anyone on a budget looking for a New York hotel. Going for a cheaper hotel meant we had more spending money for shopping!

<Title>“Good location, bad service”
<Content>The good thing: it is indeed very close to Empire State Building, Times Square is within walking distance etc, and the nightlife bars are great. On the downside, the room (single) was the smallest room I've ever been in (and being often in Paris I know that rooms there can be rather small, too): and the staff was quite unfriendly. Couldn't find my luggage, charged me for internet access (the freaking room had space only for a bed, no desk to even put a laptop on!). The worst thing was the combined toilet-bathroom-shower: Imagine a room about 2 mÂ², where one corner holds an toilet seat, the other holds a tiny tiny sink that is about the size of my hand, and the shower is - the whole room: there is a drain at the bottom of the floor, you just shower right there. Great way to start the day, I tell you!

The room was modern, clean and had lots of room. The bed was so comfortable it was hard to get up sometimes. The bathroom was a good size with a large walk in shower. It was also really quiet, once in our room we didn't hear any noise. The location was great, only a few blocks from the Empire State building, bars and the most important thing - shops!!! I would def go back here again!!

<Title>“The 4 things you need to know about this hotel”
<Content>Ok, lets cut to the chase- there are 3 things you need to know about this hotel that are deciding factors. Please read the whole critique because the 3 aren't disqualifiers for everyone- you decide they are. I just stayed at this hotel for 4 nights & was very skeptical of the star rating (3-star hotel), but NYC can be so expensive, I ran with a 3-star. I traveled with a friend, so we had 2 beds in a room. Here is what you need to know: 1.) Rooms are small 2.) the A/C unit is built into the window (no issue there) but when its on, it sounds like a 747 (if noise is an issue, sleep with it off) 3.) only place to put the TV is up about 9 ft from the floor, so when you're lying on your bed, you're looking up. 4.) the beds were small- dont know? Queens? They felt like singles. I kept thinking I was going to fall out- I'm used to Cal Kings. 5.) I'm mentioning this because I tend to check online the day before I leave (I hate checking in at the airport)- main gripe was the cost to print out a boarding pass- it took 30 seconds, ending up costing me $6 since the printer ran out of paper, so it would cost you $3, which its only $3, but that is just plain dumb (give us the convenience!!!) Now- was the hotel quiet? Yes. Never once heard anyone, nor did anyone wake me up. The hotel staff was amazingly polite and courteous and even helped me with finding locations I wanted to go. Cleaniness of the hotel was top notch- maid service extremely well. The bathroom is enormous. The location was perfect- close to everything- really probably the best location and right in the middle of it. A stone's throw from good bars and excellent restuarant. So location is probably one of the best in Manhattan. Would I stay there again? Definitely. I got a great deal on Priceline and it was a steal compared to the $400+ rooms I was seeing. I'd rather spend my $ elsewhere and this was the place where I would.

<Content>My husband and I booked this hotel based on recommendations from friends. After reading some fo the reviews after booking I was extremely worried. Overall it was a very good experience. Our room was small but clean and the hotel was extremely convenient both for walking and for taking the subway! Hotel front desk staff were not overly friendly especially since I made numerous trips to reception to have my room key reactivated. Our room was considered to be superior. Which I foudn rather amusing as it was not special in any way. Overall it was a great price and great location. I would recommend this hotel to other budget conscious travellers.

<Title>“kicked out of room when hotel overbooked themselves!”
<Content>I was on a business trip with two colleagues and the trip was for two nights. After our first night, the hotel called to say they had overbooked themselves, a large group was coming in, and at least one of us would need to vacate our room. The hotel did nothing to help us find alternate lodging. When we got back to our rooms, our bags had basically been packed for us, and the rooms were ready for new guests. They ended up putting two of us in a room with two twin beds (that were hard as concrete) and then did nothing to compensate us for their horrible screw up and handling of the situation.

<Title>“as a person that has travelled to many cities worldwide this was by far the best”
<Content>Myself and my 12 year old son arrived at the thirty thirty hotel for a week long stay and we were greeted with the utmost respect and professionalism after a long flight from London.Whilst there we stayed in a suite which was both very comfortable and kept immensley clean on a day to day basis, the hotel's ammenties were superb as were the staff. The thirty thirty hotel is actually based in the centre of Manhattan which is very close to all the top tourist attractions such as Times Square, Central Park,the Statue of Liberty to name a few but unbeliveably the Empire State Building is at the end of the street from the hotel, no more than a 30 second walk. I would recommend this hotel to both family and buisness needs as we gathered very early on that Wall street and the Buiness distict are only a very short distance too. The food, breakfast lunch and dinner were also excellent and the restaurant staff were also impecable. HIGHLY RECOMMENED!!!!

<Content>had read many reviews on this site prior to my trip to New York and was a little anxious about what to expect. well i would like to say i had a fab time in NYC and the hotel was a wee gem. The room was big, spotless and even had a view of the empire state building. The beds were soooo comfy and i got great sleep the full five nights i was there. Seconds from leaving the hotel you are in the heart of everything. The reastaurant/bar attached to the hotel does amazing breakfasts, was too busy shopping to come back for dinner but would fully recommend. The staff were very helpful and answered all my quieries. So if you are going and you are considering this hotel i would say go for it....which leaves you more money for shopping. LOL When returning to NYC i will defo use this hotel again.

<Title>“Good location but small, old room”
<Content>Let me start with saying that it's not really bad it's just not really good. The hotel has a good location, not far from subway, empire state building and not really a bad walk to Times Square. The only real problem was the room. It was small, old and smelly. I was traveling by myself so I got a petit room. The website warns you that the room is small but you can't imagine what small is until you get there. There was one twin bed pushed in the corner. The room had a smell to it like animals or something. The TV was real old and the A/C worked but was loud. Basically the room was just old. The bathroom was one open area with a tiny sink mounted in one corner with a pull out mirror. A curtain came down the middle of the room to create a shower and the toilet was in there with you. There were lots of strange stains on the ceiling and the tile looked old and dirty. I'm not real picky about places to stay and I guess there was nothing really wrong. I just left thinking that I never wanted to stay there again. Of course the other bigger rooms may be better or nicer.

<Title>“Thirty Thirty Hotel is/was the nicest place I've ever stayed in 40 years of traveling:”
<Content>To All NY Tourist or Business Travelers: My name is G.D. McCamey, and I am so excited about writing about 30-30 Hotel. Obviously my stay with the Hotel was perfect. My wife and I enjoyed some of the superior treatment we've ever received. First, management was fantastic, really enjoyable men/women to talk to and share any needs or fears you have at being in NY for the first time. I cannot describe how helpful management was, and not to leave out all the other employees who were super nice, for the sake of a better word. Let me say, I had my fears about being in Ny for the first time, but after several hours at 30-30, I felt like I was home, actually, safer. The staff gave me a room with a tub and shower as I was having some surgery and needed to soak in warm water for 30 minutes each day of our 8 day stay. The bathrooms were very nice, and the beds comfortable, quite and comfortable. To my surprise there was a safe in the closet where I was able to keep my money, and some medication for after the surgery. Little safes I could put my things in and install the combination that my wife and I were the only ones who knew it. That one feature was worth staying at 30-30, but there was more. Elevators, and several eating places across the street, in 30-30 was a nice restaurant. However, since my wife and I would be there 8 days, we needed a place for quick less expensive meals, and we found that place 1/2 block from Hotel Thirty Thirty's front door. A nice deli run by Italian family that made delicious lunches for less then $10. for both of us. Now in NY, where cigarettes cost over $10./ pack, those were inexpensive and delicious means. The problem I had was my wife kept asking me to finish her mean as it was too much for her to finish. All my life I've been told you have to be careful in NY, for it's a dangerous place. Let me say this last thing. I went down to smoke at 1:30am., 3:30am. and again at about 5am. as the surgery kept me awake with a bit of pain. I found I enjoyed standing at the door of the Hotel so much I was going down just to see the people walk by. I felt so safe that my wife and I walked from 30-30 to the doctor's office, from 30th. to 69th., leaving at dark and walking feeling as safe as if I were back in Arkansas. However, transportation is no problem at 30-30, for a taxi arrives at the door with no less then 2 or 3 minutes all day and night. There are buses, or the subway nearby. I loved the location of 30-30 Hotel. Now, this I want to say, for before we left we read some of the peoples comments who say they had stayed at 30-30 in the past, and they had some negative points in them. I was kinda worried, but let me assure you, I'm 65, I'm particular and very honest, I'm not saying anything here that is not true. I found nothing, nada,, nothing negative to say about my stay at Thirty Thirty Hotel. Even the gym for guest of 30-30 treated us special. I could not work out, but my wife did, and I was treated like royalty while I waited for her. You are right in the middle of everything, we walked to at least 10 places that tourist would want to see, and remember, I had a double surgery and was still able to walk to see the sites with no problems. The price was surprisingly inexpensive for a Hotel of that quality. Oh, I told you I felt safe and I did, but even though the whole area appears safe, there was always a member of management, or an employee at the door as well as a doorman. We decided they stayed there just to make sure their guest would have no problems, directions, ect. I told management I was coming back to NY as soon as possible, for I enjoyed it so much. Chinatown, the harbor, Statue of Liberty and we just happened to be at 'Ground Zero' for a Sept. 6, special service and memorial for those lost on 9/11. It was a special moment for both of us. If you are a country person as I am, and have never been to NY, experience it. It will be well worth your time. Make your stay at Thirty Thirty Hotel too, you'll be glad you did. God bless!

<Title>“** MICE RESIDE HERE ***”
<Content>When we arrived our first impressions were it was clean, the room was lovely and spaceous and it was in a really good location. We spent only one night there but were very shocked to discover they had mice. We went out and on our return we were horrified to find mice had eaten into some confectionery which had been left in one of our bags. I SAW THE MICE RAN ACROSS THE ROOM and called receptionist to complain about this in the hope they would give us another room. The receptionist didn't seem to care. She told me they were fully book hence could not offer us another room. The only thing she could do was send the porter up to have a look. Yes, the porter came up about 5mins later with his dustpan and brush asking "Where is it" We explained it appeared it had gone out via under the door. He did not seem in the least bit surprised there were mice running around! He then left. I assume he thought we had captured this vermin and were holding onto for him. We were disappointed as no one bothered to contact us to apologise for what had happened. We checked out the following day but left our luggage in storage, how silly of us. After we collected our luggage, we were shocked to find mice had now bitten through one of our bags and had tried to nibble at the cover of a plastic container containing chocolates within the bag. We feel the hotel needs to improve it's customer service. I was unimpressed with the way we were treated by this hotel, would never stay there again and would like to make anyone staying there aware of our experience as we would hate for others to have their holiday ruined by this. I would like to say one thing though, that is it's a lovely builing and it's in a lovely location

<Title>“Excellent value, friendly service in midtown Manhattan”
<Content>I had to extend my visit to New York last May after a traffic accident in which I was knocked down by a car in Brooklyn. Fortunately, I was able to get an excellent rate at Thirty Thirty that included breakfast. My petite single room on the 12th floor had everything I needed, and the windows facing south and east gave great light and views. I also appreciated the hotel's pet-friendly policy because I could have my daughter's cat as a companion while she was out of town one weekend. I had previously stayed at Thirty Thirty and recommended it to friends who came to the city last December. I'll be back myself in October '09 and probably again at Christmas..

<Title>“Oh Dear, What a Poor Hotel!”
<Content>The title says it all! My wife and I stayed here at the end of August 2009 on the last leg of our honeymoon. The hotel was a real disappointment. The reception area looks the part but the staff were not particularly friendly or forthcoming. The corridor to our room smelt awful, a musty cross between stale air and hair removing cream! We realised that the standard room was obviously going to be small but by New York standards this was tiny. We just about had enough room to fit our suitcases at the foot of the bed and squeeze around. The sink (which I will return to) was actually located next to the bed - although some may say this in an en-suite! The bathroom was okay consisting of a toilet and shower, it could have done with some decorating as the grouting between tiles looked worn and contained black bits. On our first night my wife tried to use the sink but to find that the water would not go down the plug hole. Using my best plunging skills I managed to use the plug to empty some of the water, however upon doing this we were greeted to a surge of black soap scum, muck and hair rising from the plug hole which was frankly disgusting. This mess took an eternity to sink down where it came from! How the previous occupants of the room or cleaner did not notice this is incredible. To give the hotel credit the following morning the reception immediately got the handyman to fix the problem. The location of the hotel was great. Being on 30th Street meant it was two blocks away from the subway and very close to 5th Ave, Madison Ave and the Empire State Building. On our checkout the concierge tried to arrange for us to use their transport to LaGuardia Airport costing $45 dollars and insisted a cab would be as expensive - there not. Our yellow taxi cost us $25 - so beware! At the end of the day the standard rooms were very basic but we were not in the hotel much but it was not somewhere you would want to get back to in a hurry!

<Title>“Fantastic hotel remember it is 3 star rated”
<Content>The thirty thirty hotel is a great hotel. I was so very nervous about staying here, after reading all the reviews on here about the hotel. We were on the 9th floor in room 917, this room is just what we needed, somewhere to sleep, shower and get ready to go out. It was cleaned everyday, we were left with new towels and bed linen everyday. To me it was perfect(in fact I have stayed in the Savoy hotel in London and this was close to matching it). The hotel staff were so helpful to us. We arrived before we could check in they then told us to leave our cases and have a first look at the city. This was great as we got our first taste of the big apple. The location of the hotel is great, in the middle of everything. I felt safe walking to the hotel late at night. At the end of our stay the hotel provided a private taxi for us to take us to the airport, this was provided by the hotel at a fee of $25 each, saving us money. The only negative thing I can think of is that the air conditioning was a bit loud but hay at least it worked as it was very hot during our holiday. All in all the thirty thirty hotel is a fantastic hotel and made my first holiday abroad the best holiday ever, thank you thirty thirty

<Title>“Do NOT stay here. $417/night dingy, miniscule rooms, dark rooms/halls”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel because there was nothing left in the entire city for a 2 night stay and our original hotel lost our reservation. The ONLY thing this hotel has going for it is location. The lighting in the rooms is so dim I had to put my makeup on by the window. everything is just cramped and sub par. I forgot my shampoo and when I got in the shower there was HALF a bottle of hotel shampoo. YUCK! I carry pepper spray when I travel and this was one stay where I had it in my hand every time I left my room. Prices were sinful!!!!!!! for what you recieve. Never again!

<Title>“Great location, know what you reserved.”
<Content>This hotel is in a great, fairly quiet location, a mix of restaurants, small shops and many apartments, close to Empire State building, Union Square, Grand Central station, and 3 blocks to subway for trips to all points of Manhattan and other sites in NY. Front desk is helpful, but be sure you know what you reserved. I found a Labor Day special on the internet, standard queen room and included full complimentary breakfast at Zana's restaurant next door. The porter took us up to our room only to discover it was two twins in a room smaller than a college dorm room. We said no and the porter called the front desk, then put my husband on the phone. It took some wrangling but after showing them our printout of our reservation they put us in an upgrade king room, telling us that was for one night and we'd have to move the next day. Next day arrived and different front desk help told us to keep the king at no extra charge. Typical amenities, a few toiletries, hair dryer, iron and safe. We seemed to be in the minority of English speaking guests. Most were Eastern European including Russian, Czech Republic, German etc. Loved the laughter and congeniality present in the lobby and in the two working elevators. (a third did not work) Porters and other help were pleasant. The staff at Zana's next door was excellent and we enjoyed three breakfasts (after returning to the front desk for our free vouchers). We had beautiful weather and they opened their front windows so our table felt like it was outside but with the comforts and quiet of indoors. If you want to be in the midst of noise/hustle/bustle of Times Square, this is not the hotel for you. If you need a great base for sightseeing, it's great. Enjoy your trip to New York, wear comfortable walking shoes!

<Title>“Brilliant Stay - Exceeded our Expectations!”
<Content>Myself and my Girlfriend stayed in Thirty Thirty for 5 nights the first week of September 09 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We had read reviews and were dreading going but i must say we thought the place was Fantastic and find it hard to understand how anyone could have such a bad time here. The room was larger than expected with a large bathroom with lovely big shower, a digital TV with 28 channels, safe, phone, air con etc. We were surprised at how nice it was for an 3* NYC hotel. The hotel was clean and inviting, with pleasant enough staff who fielded any queries we had the best they could and we felt very secure and safe. We got our room cleaned twice and it was spotless after the cleaners had been in. The LOCATION is BRILLIANT - just off the main avenues (5th & Madison) so nice and quiet but 5 mins walk to Empire State - less than 10 mins to Macy's and 15mins to Time sqaure - we walked to and from times square a few of the nights and felt totally comfortable in our surroundings. 2 streets down is the 28th street subway which you can connect to any part of the city from which we thought was excellent - $2.25 fare. Overall we would recommend this hotel to everyone - we booked our room on a summer sale week with 40% off so the value for money was outstanding. We feel a holiday is only as good as you make it yourself and we fully believe Hotel Thirty Thirty helped us have a wonderful week in NYC.

<Title>“Alot better than expected”
<Content>Got to say pleasently suprised by hotel. Had read some reviews before going and was worried about what we might get. So after our vist felt it only fair to make a comment. When we arrived I asked for rooms next to each other, receptionist could not accomodate this at the time but said she could sort out next day. The room my husband and youngest son got was fantastic, 2 big windows, coffee machine, cooker etc. My room was very small for 2 single beds and looked on to next building. Having said that the bathroom was big and it was only for 1 night. All linin very clean as were both rooms. Day 2 went to reception and although we did not get rooms right next to each other we got one down the hall on the same floor, so the boys fot the great room and my husband and I got the other one which was a double. Big enough for what we needed, again clean, although the shower not as good as in other room, but we had more space between out window. The location of the hotel was great 3 blocks up and to the left and you were at the Empire state building, so fantastic. Hotel staff nice and the girl in the bar was very good and remembered our drinks every time we wnet in. Nice place outside to sit and eat/drink ( although we did not eat in hotel)Lots of good eating places around about and I found the deli at the end of the street to the right coming out of the front door, which was recommended by someone on trip adviser. A good little italian also around the corner going left out of building then right, looked run down abit but food great and nice people. I would definately recommend the hotel

<Title>“Brilliant location”
<Content>I visited New York with some extended family and we stayed at the Thirty Thirty Hotel. We were dropped picked up from the airport by some friends and dropped off to the hotel. My first impressions were that is was an average hotel. The service was good, and we had no problems with the staff or reception. The lobby was basic with one or two gift shops inside. We had two rooms, each with two single beds. The rooms were a simple basic size, slightly small, but could fit a wardrobe, two beds and a bedside table in. The bathroom was a nice with a decent shower and a lot of space. As we went during July, the temperature was boiling, and unfortunately the windows didn't open for safety reasons I presume, but we would leave the air con on during the day which would leave the room cool for night time. But the locations was the best part of the hotel, we were a five minute walk from everything and there were tons of cafes and coffee houses nearby to get breakfast in the morning. Overall, the hotel was average, with nothing to boast about, but the location was perfect. After all, I feel that spending time in New York isn't about which hotel you stay at, and as long as I had a decent place to sleep at night, it was a good deal.

<Content>We read the reviews before we went on holiday and was scared at first, but the hotel was absolutely fine! On arrival, the staff were really nice & welcoming. The hotel room was very clean & there was absolutely NO insects! The beds were comfortable & t.v. was good (had many channels). The hotel was very central. Within walking distance to Times Square, Empire State Building, Central Park and Madison Square Gardens. Do no listen to the negative reviews! This hotel was brilliant for the money we paid!!!

<Title>“Cockroaches”
<Content>DIsgusting. Stayed there this summer during part of our honeymoon. On entering the room for the first time knew we'd made a mistake. Tiny room and really noisy ancient air conditioning that did not work and could not be turned off. TV remote would not work. Carpet had not been vacuumed, thick dust on the windowcill. Toothpaste splashes all over the tiles around the bathroom sinks, dirty floor tiles and grime around corners of bath. The final straw was the cockroaches - in the bathroom, in the drawers of the bedside cabinet and on the window. The only good thing is that they were baby cockroaches. Feel sorry for those staying there this month as they'll be fully grown now! Doubt the hotel will do anything about them. Would never recommend it. In fact this has made me never want to go back to New York!!

<Title>“Water rained through the bathroom ceiling”
<Content>Stayed for 6 nights, chose the hotel because of its location despite the mixed reviews on TripAdvisor. First night we were told on arrival that the type of room that we'd booked wasn't available, therefore we'd been 'upgraded' to a bigger room. The room was nice and spacious...however we were also told that we would need to check out of the bigger room in the morning and check in again to move into the room that we'd actually booked. Overheard other guests at reception being told the same thing, so wonder whether this is done regularly so that when you see the room you actually booked, you might then want to pay the extra to be put back into bigger room. On our last night, the guest in the room above us took a shower, which caused water from their bathroom to rain through our bathroom ceiling. Rang reception to inform them, were met with a very unconcerned response. We were told that they were fully booked when we asked to change rooms, and offered a free breakfast in recompense. Will be trying to receive a refund for our final night. Personally I feel that there are likely to be hotels in the area offering better value for money and service than Thirty Thirty Hotel. We would not stay there again.

<Title>“more service, please”
<Content>Stayed six nights at the Thirty Thirty in July 09. Our "family deluxe room" was really nice - big and spacious and a great place to come back to after walking the streets of NYC all day and night. We got a good deal when booking (40 percent off), but if we had paid the full price, we would have been downright disappointed. Mainly because of the extra amenities most people expect nowadays. Traveling with two teenage boys you need Internet-acces ... but here they charge two dollars (to be fed into a machine in the lobby) for just a few minutes, and it's just not good enough. The charge for Internet-acces in the room was ridiculously high - and not worthy of a hotel like the Thirty Thirty that presents itself as a modern and trendy hotel (which in many ways it is - but people's expectations are different now compared to just a few years ago). Moreover we experienced a couple of times where messages left at the reception at night was not passed on to the manager - the Internet-machine ate dollars without giving access, we had to put a bit of pressure on to change the check-out time from 11 to 12), so all in all there's a bit to work on for the management in that respect. The location of the hotel is okay, but not great. There's a couple of nice sandwich-places in the area and a store that's open day and night on the corner - and the Empire State Building is just a 5 min walk away ... but if you're looking for a bit more NYC-action this area might be a bit too quiet for you. All in all our stay was successful, but the general service at the hotel needs to be improved.

<Content>We enjoyed staying at 30-30...the location can't be beat. It's a value in such an attractive part of the Big City. The rooms are small, rugs a bit frayed , AC noisy ...and external (outside)noise levels are quite highas well, but that's the city. The staff was very attentive and all equipment was in working order. The hotel runs value days that are very competitive. My cousin always stays at 30-30 when she's in town and I truly value hger opinion.

Room 1004 was a good size for 2 of us. view from window wasnt great but what do people expect in new york?! staff would bend over backwards to make you happy from conceirge who spent all day searching for vegetarian restuarants for us to the manager who always had time to stop and ask about our day even at midnight when we were slightly worse for wear. only problem was a carbon monoxide alarm that beeped 2 days in a row but was sorted promptly with maintenence and manager responding to our call. would definately stay here again if returning to new york! felt like a 2nd home! my only request would be tea and coffee making facilities in room as i was gasping for a cup of tea on our arrival.

<Title>“fantastic hotel/ great location”
<Content>This was our first holiday as Mr & Mrs we wanted a hotel that was almost in the center of everything so we chose the Thirty Thirty located close to the subway for quick travel & central for walking around, in my opinion the best way to see & experience New York is by foot. The hotel was fantastic very modern, clean & the staff were great always smiling & very helpful. The room was a good size, clean & comfortable. Wil definatly be returning to New York & will certainly be staying here again. A good piece of advice for anyone going to New York & wanting to see the sights is to book everything before you go saves you so much time not queing, also you can get a city pass which is definatly worth buying is a book of tickets for Empire State Building, Guggenhiem Museum, MOMA, Statue of Liberty or Circle Line Cruise, The American Museum of Natural Histroy & The Met Museum. If you go to the natural History Museum i would deffinatly recomend the Hayden Planetarium it was amazing. Its also worth buying a Metro card for your stay you can then hop on & off as you please great value for money. Before we went i booked a photo tour with marc Samuels were he takes you all around New york or any place you want to go for 2 hours & takes photos of you so you get pictures of both/all people together the pics are fantastic & worth every penny, if anyones intersested his e-mail is (-----------) website is www.phototrektours.com we also booked tickets for a Yankees game which was a brilliant experience we got our tickets for that from allstar tickets e-mail: (------) Mike Fassio delt with ours.

<Title>“excellent location, good value for money”
<Content>Our room was quite large, perhaps it was because we had a family room. It was very clean, nice cotton sheets on beds. Plenty of coffee making products replaced each day. Best of all was the location. We got weekly subway tickets and went everywhere although we didn't want to get off the bus in Harlem. A guided tour there would have been better. Go on the Statten Island ferry, it's free and you get good views of the Statue of Liberty, plus Manhatten skyline. Would definitely recommend hotel and stay there again.

<Content>We were somewhat worried about staying in this hotel after reading about the rat infested rooms but it was not that bad! The reception staff, especially the young Polish woman, were extremely helpful especially when given a complicated request. The location is great - walking distance to many attractions (Empire State Building, Times Square) and close to the subway to access any areas further afield. The worst thing was the room - it was very small and scruffy needing redecoration. The bathroom was better with high quality towels, a good hair drier etc but had a weird smell. The filling breakfast was included in the price and served in the very nice bar/restaurant on site. I would definitely stay here again but would be more demanding about my choice of room.

<Title>“Home Away from Home at Thirty Thirty”
<Content>Unless you are very wealthy -- and few of us are -- just thinking about booking a hotel room in New York City can be depressing. This is the land of $300 a night, tiny, tiny mousetrap hotel rooms that try to make up for what happens behind your door by having an opulent lobby. It's not opulent, but I like the lobby at the Thirty Thirty Hotel. It is contemporary and functional. And, like the hotel itself, it has everything I need at a price I can afford. Get one of the King rooms if you are traveling with your spouse and what you will have is a home away from home getaway spot with a really comfy bed, high-end bedding, lots of light when you want it (and total dark when you want it) a nice seating area and desk and a really cool bathroom. Love the baths here. Marble and glass showers with fantastic shower heads. Nice soaps and great lotion, too. High--end products at a budget price. So relaxing at the end of a hard day of being a NYC tourist. It's not the Ritz. But its not supposed to be. The Thirty Thirty is in a neighborhood with lots of delis and family owned restaurants and little cafes and standard issue Starbucks nearby. It is really close to the sights, like the NY Public Library and the Empire State Building. And it is right on a subway line that takes you anywhere you want to go. There are also some highend restaurants close by on Park and they make for a perfect special night out for you and someone you love. But at the end of the day, you'll enjoy coming "home." The staff is not at all intrusive but there is always someone around who will say "hello" or offer help if you need something. There's a great little restaurant right downstairs that serves everything from a cheap and filling breakfast to late night eats and a night cap. There's no free internet service. But you can pay for it in your room or go down to the communal pay stations in the lobby. I have stayed here three times now; once with my daughter when she was a teen and interviewing with colleges, once alone on business, and most recently with my husband when we attended a convention. I always have a complaint about something. But honestly, I cannot say anything bad about this place. Each time, the Thirty Thirty was the perfect spot.

<Title>“Great value and location for 1st time NYC”
<Content>From reading the rest of the reviews I think this hotel must be in the process of being renovated. For the price that we paid ($119 per night) this hotel was a great. Our room was small but we had a closet with a safe in it, had an ironing board and iron and we had a flat screen TV. Our queen bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and the room was cleaned everyday. Our room was on the back end of the hotel away from the traffic which probably helped keep the sound down. The hotel staff were not really friendly but they weren't rude either....didn't really add anything positive or negative to our visit. The hotel is about 3 blocks away from the subway 6 line and was 2 blocks away from 5th Avenue. The area around the hotel felt safe and there was always plenty of traffic. Unless its during rush hour time you will be able to easily flag down a taxi. Check out my profile for a video of the room that we stayed in. We were not impressed by the restaurant across the hotel name Crooked Knife. They had the best deal for Miller Light taps and margaritas but their food was just average and we found better food easily elsewhere. I would suggest going there just for drinks and skip eating there.

<Title>“If you like rats”
<Content>It was still bearable until one day, I heard the paper bag containing my breakfast for the next morning rustling at the side of my bed. Yes, there are rats in the room (or at least one). The access cards to the room often fail to work, the rooms are tiny and not made up when we're back late (11pm). All these are still bearable. But NOT sharing the room with rats that chew through and things and probably run around the room.

<Title>“Great Service and Location!”
<Content>My wife and I had to book a hotel room in NYC, and chose Thirty Thirty Hotel, when our flight was cancelled and could not be re-booked until the following day. We were obviously tired and stressed from being a the airport for nearly 8 hours waiting as the flight kept being pushed back until it was cancelled that evening. Once at the hotel the front desk manager was very helpful and friendly. In our conversation, I told him what had happened that day and he expressed his apologies and offered a free room upgrade to a small suite. He wanted to make sure that we enjoyed our stay and was determined to give us a nice relaxing night's sleep. The room was very clean and the bathroom was a dark slate stone throughout and was also pristine. The only aspect of the room that was not up to date were the old CRT style tvs and the lack of an MP3 device plug in on the clock/radio. However, please remember that this is a 3 star hotel, which I would say is the best appointed/styled 3 star I have ever stayed in. Furthermore, you cannot beat the location in Midtown Manhattan! The "Little Curry" Indian district is just blocks away, as is the Empire State Building, not to mention countless other places to see. There are plenty of food/bar locations within a block, and the bar/restaurant in the hotel looked very nice, but we did not try it as they stopped serving food at 11pm. Overall, we were very pleased with our experience and would definitely stay there again given the chance. The fact that an employee actually paid attention to our story of being stuck at the airport all day and decided to act on it by giving us an upgrade stands out as reason alone to stay here again. They had no reason whatsoever to do so, other than he thought it would make our stay more enjoyable given the circumstances. That type of quality customer service is something to be practiced more often.

<Title>“Very pleansantly surprised by the hotel and value”
<Content>I booked the smallest room possible a day before I traveled to New York for around $100. Needless to say, I was quite worried about the condition of the hotel. However, I was very surprised to find the staff courteous, the location fantastic, and the room was spacious and very nicely kept. The staff actually gave me a complimentary upgrade to a junior suite that had a full sized sofa and master bath. Everything was a great value and it comes with complimentary breakfast. There are lots of places to go nearby as well. The only thing lacking was Wifi in the rooms, but they do have signal in the lobby plus free wired connection in the room.

<Title>“Worst Hotel Ever”
<Content>For my first trip to the big apple we decided to go with the thirty thirty hotel as it was right in the centre af manhatten . When we arrivied they gave our key but when we got to the room they had already booked someone else in it , what a great start to the holiday when we eventually got a room it was the worst room i had ever seen the shower had brown marks in it and the shower was rusty . and all the floor had craks in it . Not what you want after a 7 hour flight . The next day it got even better !, we left the room at 11.00am and when we arrived back at 5pm our room had still not been cleaned , we saw the maids coming round so went out for another hour but when we arrived back at 6pm still nothing had been done no clean towels or anything . On the other hand NY was amazing would defientley go back but would never return to the hotel

<Title>“I thought it was bad, until it got worse!”
<Content>The customer service is terrible, but because the location is great I could have overlooked this. I went up to my room (in the very furthest possible corner of the hotel) and the wardrobe smelled; the toilet had brown stuff leaking from it; the shower leaked when turned off and had little pressure when turned on; the bed was as hard as a rock; there was no iron or ironing board and when I requested one at the front desk, they brought the iron to my room and said they couldn't find the ironing board. Finally, one hour before checking out, I was greeted by a ROACH about FIVE inches long!! And, I'm not exaggerating. It was as big as a mouse and less timid, as it ran around the room unbothered by me trying to get dressed and get the hell out of there as fast as I could. The location is fantastic, but everything else was horrible. I will never go back.

<Title>“Terrible service and a huge disappointment”
<Content>Very disappointed in this hotel. Unfortunately, if you look at their website, the rooms do NOT look like that in reality. We first checked in a room that was horribly small with a very loud air conditioner and barely enough room between the bed and the wall to walk by. No storage, no desk nothing. We asked to be changed and were and for the time being, although not the cleanest, it was ok. The location is outstanding, but that's about all the hotel has going for it. After 3 nights, our soap had never been changed, no additional shampoo or conditioner, and the counter had not been cleaned in that time because the soap used on day one was still stuck on the sink. Add to that we had no handtowells or washclothes as they 'wouldn't be available until after 8pm'....what??? And then when we asked for some to be sent up 'after 8pm', they still negelected to do it. I am deeply disappointed and would really steer people away from this hotel. You can do much better, trust me.

<Title>“excellent hotel, clean, friendly and comfortable with superb midtown location”
<Content>this is an excellent little hotel situated two blocks from the empire state (5 min walk) the location means easy access to all of midtown (15 mins to times square, 20mins to 5th Avenue - the shops - tiffanies, A&F, etc) the hotel its self is clean and comfortable. Staff were excellent and very helpful - you can book all the local trips, etc with the concierge and a great rate. The only slight negative was that the room we stayed in was small and didn't really have a view, well it did - the back of an adjacent building. But who goes to NYC for a big room with a view? We slept and showered in the room and it was more that adequate for such tasks. It was clean with all the amenities you'd expect and fresh towels, etc were provided every day. Iâ€™d strongly recommend this hotel for most types of tourist. I travelled with my girlfriend but would be suitable for all kinds of travel. Strongly recommend - excellent stay.

<Title>“Hotel OK, but in fantastic location”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews here, I was a bit concerned about this hotel. However, the staff were friendly when we checked in and out and the doorman helped me with my luggage and got us a taxi on the way back to the airport. The room itself is very small. I am 5'6" and my toes were hanging over the edge of the bed when laying down. My brother who is a bit taller had his entire feet hanging out of the bed! The room was tiny, but the bathroom was massive. They could have cut the bathroom space by half and increased the bedroom size easily. However we weren't too bothered about the size as we were only using the hotel as a base to store our belongings and sleep. The room also had a safe which was handy and was cleaned and the beds were remade daily. The location is excellent. It is only four blocks away from the Empire State Building, and most tourist attractions are within walking distance. However if you wish to go a bit further, 28th Street station is right there at the end of the street. Park Avenue South has loads of handy little shops, like Starbucks, Subway, McDonalds and a branch of Duane Reade (which is like a cross between Superdrug and a newsagents) which was really handy for odds and ends. 28th St station is also on Park Avenue South. Also from Park Avenue South you can see the MetLife building and Grand Central Station. On the recommendation of reviewers on here, we visted the Crooked Knife restaurant and bar. So glad we did, as it is an amazing place. Really homely atmosphere, very cosy and the food is amazing. The staff were very helpful and the service prompt. We also visited the California Pizza Kitchen which was also excellent, quite cheap and tasty. The desserts are amazing - particularly the sticky toffee pudding with ice cream. So while the hotel isn't exactly amazing, if you only looking for a place to store your belongings, rest your head and be near the centre of things, this is a great place to stay. I would definately stay here again. It is not a luxury hotel, but then it does not claim to be.

<Title>“Good Clean Fun!”
<Content>I was frightened at first after reading some of the terrible reviews about the 30 30. My friend and I arrives June 11th and were quickly given the key to our room on the 8th floor, and we soon went down to the 6th floor to visit a friend who was staying at the hotel with us. We had a quaint two twin bed room with a large bath, while our friend had a larger room with a queen and smaller bath. Both rooms were CLEAN! We had a very pleasant housekeeper who replaced out towels and made out beds daily. The front desk was prompt when we locked ourselves out of the bath room and replaced room keys at no charge if they were either lost of forgotten in the room (note that the replacement of a key imprints a new code so don't try to use the old key at a later time, it won't work). This is a great place to stay if you are planning to visit the city. Clearly, this is not the Waldorf with 24 hour room service, a spa, or any other luxury one might pay for. But that's just it, this is a clean safe hotel with a great price and location. If you require more you will easily find it in NYC, but not at this price.

<Title>“Do not stay here”
<Content>This hotel had mixed reviews but we thought it couldn't possibly be that bad - it is!! The first room we were offered was filthy, and not just housekeeping issues - it needed new carpets and re-wallpapering to remove the stains of previous occupants. Did you know they let 70 of their rooms to "tenants"? These appear to be people who are a bit down on their luck and by some means have electcted to live in this establishment. Check out the front door of Room 1228, it looks as though the authorities have attempted forced entry on more than one ocassion. Eventually, after inspecting a further four rooms we upgraded to a deluxe - we had to pay extra, plus tax of course. This was a smoking room, but at least we could recognise the smell in this room. Staff not too friendly, apart from Joanna the Polish receptionist who was very helpful and concerned for our plight.

<Title>“The Price Matches the Hotel”
<Content>We just got home from our 2 night stay (5/29-5/31). The lobby & hallways are not as trendy as shown, but were clean and nice. Our room (mini - king suite) was very clean and the bathroom was large & modern. The bed was extremely comfortable. For a suite it was on the smaller side. The receptionists could have been friendlier, but it didn't ruin our stay.

<Title>“Adequate facilities, front desk staff need more customer focused training”
<Content>My wife and I have just returned from a four night stay at the Thirty Thirty Hotel. From the time we booked in until we checked out the front desk staff, concierge and doormen excepted, were curt. On two occasions our electronic door key failed and we had to ask them to recode them. They did so but rather begrudgingly. On another couple of occasions we asked for some small dollar bills change so that we could use the internet facility, both times we were told to go to the restaurant because they didn't carry change. Please don't be fooled by the photographs of the rooms. We were in a room on the twelfth floor next to the elevator, it was basic very small but adequate. If you are looking for something on a more grand scale from our experience you won't find it at Thirty Thirty. Location was good with easy access to 5th Ave and Broadway although Times Square and the theatre district is quite a walk away.

<Content>have stayed here 3 times before, small rooms basic but thats all you need in New York. this hotel is just around the corner from the empire state building. my 1st trip to New York i stayed in The Plaza on the corner of 5th ave & central park ave where most movies are filmed over looking centrel park, the rooms were bigger but 4 x the price & other than 5th ave it was to far away from resturants etc which tend to be mid town. there is a lovely resturant in the thirty thirty, also a lot of dinners around the thirty thirty for breakfast. i would recommend get a cheaper hotel like the thirty thirty & spend the money upgrading you flight.

<Title>“Underwhelmed by the Thirty Thirty”
<Content>I had booked the Thirty Thirty hotel as a treat for my mother's 65th birthday. The hotel website gave the impression of being a 3*+ boutique hotel and I took the pictures and blurb at face value. I wasn't expecting the world but I thought I had landed a great bargain and somewhere we would look forward to returning at the end of our long days exploring New York. Unfortunately, we were in for a real disappointment. The lobby and service are fine. Nothing special, just OK. The area where the hotel is situated isn't too bad although it's not that great. It's a five minute walk from the Empire State Building although the approach from Fifth Avenue is rather ropey with run down shops with graffiti. All acceptable up to this point. The real horror story was our room on the third floor. The walls were scuffed and dirty, the twin beds (two singles) were adequate, the carpet looked dirty and the air conditioning unit was extremely noisy. The porter who brought our luggage up to the room hurriedly pulled down the (dirty) blinds in the bedroom and bathroom to mask the hideous outlook from the windows. The lighting consisted of a neon light in the corner of the room and a table light. This made the small room look and feel dingy. There were no tea or coffee making facilities (is this not standard everywhere in this day and age?) and internet access was not free. The (tiny) wardrobe was not a full size and there were only four coat hangers. The only plus was the bathroom which was an adequate and was clean. Certainly not a hint of luxury or a 'wow' factor. Nor was it a relaxing haven at the end of our days. That's what you really want on holiday, isn't it? And we didn't want to pay the earth - we shouldn't have to to get the basics. Other contributors have suggested what great value Thirty Thirty is. I beg to differ. Value is when you receive fantastic service or a wonderful experience at a really good price. The price here is not exorbitant, but it is expensive compared to the overall service and quality of the hotel. You are left with a feeling of dissatisfaction when the overall level of service is poor and you are paying for it. And you don't always want to complain when you are on holiday. Although I do hope this review is a warning to others who are tempted to stay at the Thirty Thirty. I left with a sense that I had been let down and what should have been a special week for my mother was spoiled by the standard of the hotel. Someone suggested the Thirty Thirty is effectively good quality student accommodation and it certainly has the feel of student digs. I would recommend paying a little more and paying for the basic services expected in a hotel - tea and coffee, cleanliness, space - rather than suffer here. It's the little things that can let down a holiday - in this day and age internet access should be free in hotels. There should be tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. The adjoining restaurant was hopeless for breakfast but there are plenty of other options so that didn't really bother us. The Crooked Knife restaurant opposite was worthy of mention as being a good bolt hole for the evenings when we wanted something quick - first night and pre-theatre. I had e-mailed the hotel several weeks before our holiday to say that I was bringing my mother for a special birthday treat and to confirm we would have a twin room with two beds. I did not receive a reply which I guess should have been a sign that all was not well with this hotel. I would definitely not return to the Thirty Thirty and I could not recommend the hotel to anyone, other than perhaps back packers or students who are looking for a base from which to explore New York City. It is on a par with a good hostel rather than anything approaching 3* even city standards. A shame, because I was hoping that I had hit upon a gem!

<Title>“Don't Worry its perfectly good.!!”
<Content>i stayed in the 3030 with my mum for one week between mar30 and april6th 2009. after booking this hotel and reading some of the reviews was a little concerned but figured it couldnt be all that bad as im not that fussy!! and i was Right. the hotel was less that the estimated 45mins from airport. lobby was impressive ans reception desk was staffed by two. arrived in nyc bout half 4 in the evening, no line to check in but a few gathering in lobby. staff were friendly on check in and very efficient. a smile from a new guest goes a long way remember,. location of the hotel is perfect for sightseeing. we had good weather and walked EVERYWHERE: got two taxis for the entire week and both were at night. the room was small but clean and bathroom was very clean and shower was huge. well stocked with toiletries and clean towels which were replaced every day. bar downstairs was good for simple tea and toast breakfast and waiting staff were very friendly every day giving us the table we liked best to look out the window at the morning pavement activity. Gift shop downstairs makes it easy to buy the magnets and postcards so you wont have to carry them around the city with you!! no problems with this hotel during entire trip. would def stay there again and have recommended it to people here since my return. good for the traveller who wants a good location for sightseeing,(empire state building was bout ten minute walk, and you can get the sightseeing bus from there if your doing that, central : about the same distance from central park as to statue of liberty/ellis island-we walked to both) shopping, evening entertainment (broadway was a ten minute walk to see mamma mia. ), restarants and coffee shops all within seconds of a walk. beds comfy, can self control temp in rooms, plenty hot water in shower(didnt run out all week), if you want a bed for the night to enjoy the city , this is your best bet, but a romantic trip may want somewhere else if you want chocs on your pillow!! enjoy new york cant wait to go back.

<Content>After having booked this hotel through a travel agent we were in fear and dread after reading reviews that labelled it the hotel from hell. But in fact it is a great little hotel for those who want a convenient location, good neighbourhood services like coffee shops, delis and restaurants before or after a frenetic New York day. The rooms are small but most people are only in the hotel to sleep. Our room was spotlessly clean, with towels etc changed each day, and lobby staff were extremely helpful. We would stay there again.

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel and Great Location!”
<Content>We stayed at the Thirty Thirty Hotel over the Easter Break, on a girls weekend away. The location is brilliant, central but on a quiet street. We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly, and as we booked when their summer sale was on it was incredibly good value. On our first night they did not have a standard twin room available, so we were upgraded to one of the superior rooms for the first night - a nice bit of luxury! The standard room was fine as well - definitely a bit smaller but all we needed for a few nights in New York. Very clean, maid service every day if you wanted it and overall a great bargain if you can get a discounted rate like we did.

<Title>“Great hotel - both location and price wise (for New York anyway)!”
<Content>Thirty Thirty is ideally located - its about a 5 min walk to Empire State Building and roughly 10-15 mins walk to Times Square. The hotel itself is on a fairly quiet street and was very clean and staff were extremely helpful. We arrived early at the hotel and our room was ready so we checked straight in. We had a superior room - which was a decent size with dressing table area, 2 armchairs and a nice modern bathroom with shower and bath, also coffee making facilities and cd player. Our friends had a standard room and theirs was much smaller with literally a bed and wardrobe so would definitely pay extra to upgrade to superior room. There is a good bar across the road "Crooked Knife" which was always busy, with good priced drinks and food, also there is a California Pizza Kitchen 2 mins at end of the road. We got cabs down to Greenwich Village and they were only $8 - 10 so this gives you a kind of idea of the good central location of the hotel. All in all, I would say that this is a good clean hotel, with good facilities and an ideal location. It was also reasonably priced compared to some other hotels (with less glowing reviews!) that I found. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others.

<Title>“Great base in NYC”
<Content>I went to NYC for a 3 night break with my boyfriend in February. We found Thirty Thirty online and was easy enough to book. Was a little concerned with some negative reviews we read but figured the last place we'd be in New York was in the hotel! Our flight was delayed from Heathrow and we were concerned that the staff would think we weren't going. A quick phonecall rectified that and when we checked in many hours later than expected there were no problems. Staff were friendly and polite. We had booked a superior room and it was just what we wanted. A big comfy bed, couple of lounge chairs and a little table with a TV. The sink and mirror was in the main bedroom and the toilet and shower found in the en suite.There was a hair dryer, ironing board, iron and free safe in the room also. It did however smell of cigarette smoke (we wondered whether people were actually living in the hotel and if it was filtering through as we never saw anyone smoking). The walls were on the thin side but didn't bother either of us as we wanted to be up early to see the sights. The hotel was centrally located with most things within walking distance. To walk to the end of the block and look up to see the Empire State Building was amazing. We did avoid the restaurant attached to the hotel after reading some reviews on here, and was spoilt for choice for good cheap food. Please go and eat at The Crooked Knife opposite thirty thirty. The atmosphere in the bar was great and the food was reasonably priced and tasty. That and the bar staff will make you any cocktail you want. There is a concierge based in the hotel's reception area who is available for those who are unsure what they want to do. We didn't use him as we had a guide book and did a lot of research before we went. We paid the basic $45 plus tolls and tips from JFK in a yellow cab and the hotel booked us a cab for our return trip so we knew how much time we had left in the city. Our suitcases were kept in the storage facility and the bell hop was polite and helpful. Overall, a great trip. Would go back again definitely.

<Title>“Great location!!”
<Content>Stayed here for four nights in Feb/march 2009. The hotel is about 3 minutes walk from the Empire State building and ideally located for reaching everything on foot. The hotel itself is clean, well presented and 3 star is about right. Four nights for Â£300 in heart of NY is great value. There is a pub opposite called the Crooked knife where the atmosphere is great and food very good. It seems to be used by all sorts on their way home from the office. They put complimentary spicy chicken wings and bowls of home made chips on the tables on a thursday and friday between 5 and 7. They are delicious! My only moan about staying here was when I used the porter to order a taxi to get to the airport. He was very polite but he obviously has a thing going with his mate who turned up in his range rover and took us to the airport. he was not a licensed taxi driver and in hindsight, I should not have got into the vehicle. Fore-warned is fore-armed! Other than that, highly recommended and when I return, I shall stay here again.

<Title>“Comfortable and ideally placed midtown hotel”
<Content>We had 4 nights here and it was just what we wanted. There was nothing spectacular about the hotel, but it was clean, the rooms were small but perfectly adequate and the staff helpful . We were actually upgraded for the first night from the standard room. Although the more expensive room was bigger, we found the bathroom was smaller than the standard. Plus, the standard room was quieter through being on the side of the building. It was in a good location for walking both up and downtown - based on Thirty and Madison we were very close to the Empire State, Times Square and Grand Central. Suggest getting the bus into town from JFK - $54 dollars return for 2 is great as this takes you to Grand central where you transfer to car to take you direct to your hotel and they pick you up from the door for the return. If your going to the theatre, suggest 39 Steps - they've turned it into a comedy and its fantastic. Also try the rooftop bar on 230 5th Avenue - brilliant views of the midtown area. Best grub - they were all good but particular metion must go to Grimaldis pizza just across the Brooklyn Bridge and Tortilla Flats in Greenwich.

<Title>“Excellent Location, very clean -would recommend and will def stay again”
<Content>Excellent Location -clean, comfortable and cosy rooms. Walking distance to Times Square, Grand Central Station & Empire State. Staff helpful and not in your face which was great! Really good restaurants and bars in the vacinity -our favourite was Crocked Knife (directly opposite) and Foley's which were vibrant, friendly and great value for money. Dont listen to other reviews -especially if you want to use the room as base and get out and see the city! The Hotel was great and perfect for our needs -will be going back and would recommend!

<Title>“Ideally located”
<Content>We stayed at thirty thirty for two nights at the end of March. The hotel is ideally located to explore Manhattan fully. The Empire State Building is no more than a 10 min walk as is Grand Central Station & Madison Sq Gardens...if there is a negative to be noted it is the attitude of the staff on the front desk. I am kinda thinking they may have flunked out of charm school...but do not let this put you off the hotel is great with a lovely bar/restaurant directly opposite called the Crooked Knife...food was lovely there and reasonably priced. Subway station on 33rd Street just around the corner opens up the whole of Manhattan but we walked to most places...Central Park 30 mins....Times Sq 15 mins.

<Title>“Hotel Thirty Thirty is conveniently located and accommodating”
<Content>The hotel is located just off Park Ave, where you can catch the subway to anywhere at 28th Street. My room was a standard in the back, in the corner on the eleventh floor so I had a great view of the New York Life Building from my window. The room was small, but clean. I brought my own travel coffee maker, there wasn't one in the room. TV mounted up high on wall, which I don't care for, but when in New York, it doesn't matter. I didn't purchase the hotel's internet access (expensive) but was able to connect via wireless to one of several unsecured networks. Comfy bed, nice bath. No vanity, desk, or table (except night stands.) Booked on Hotwire for $97 plus taxes/night.

<Title>“Excellent location and a decent place to stay”
<Content>So long as you don't have expectations that the Thirty Thirty will somehow add to the experience of your stay in NY, this is an acceptable place to stay. Reading previous reviews, we made sure we booked a larger room and also confirmed this prior to arriving. We paid about $170 USD inclusive of taxes and breakie... and I wouldn't really want to pay more. Our room was large with a king bed, very modest - only 1 mirror, no in-suite bar, no coffeee-maker, but there was an iron. Front-desk staff rather surly, but with some charm and smiles we had them helping us out with early check-ins and an extra breakfast. Room cleanliness, despite other reviews, was actually fine. We heard several complaints from other guests about errors with bookings and very small rooms. The hotel attracts budget travelers --- english blokes drunk in the hallways, school groups, europeans, and young couples. It is a very European-feeling hotel - including the electro-pop trash music blaring over breakfast in the cafe. Advise getting a larger room, confirming your reservation in advance and only stay if the price is right.

<Title>“rename this hotel dirty dirty”
<Content>We booked this hotel for the location and on the recommendation from the travel agent .We had been adivsed before we traverlled and wished now that we had changed the hotel. We were given a room at the back of the hotel ,it was very very small and dirty .with wall paper hanging off, frayed carpets, scuffed skirting boards ,and the bath room was no better. Nothing about the hotel felt clean and the staff weren't very helpful. This was the worse hotel we have ever stayed in and for the price we payed we would of got a five star hotel in the uk .

<Title>“Like visiting a railway station with basic accommodation”
<Content>We only stayed two nights while we were waiting to visit relatives in Upper West Manhattan. I have never seen such an enormous reception area, so underused and so unfriendly - a few uncomfortable chairs along one wall and that was really it. We waited nearly a quarter of an hour to get booked in, as there was only one man on duty and the gentleman in front of us had a problem. There was no friendly New York welcome, as we had from our taxi driver (please note those who paid more that it should only be $45 plus tolls from JFK). Our room was small and the bathroom tiny with the washbasin in the bedroom!! Not great if you prefer to clean your teeth in private. On the plus side, the sheets and towels were changed for the second night. It was just about OK but we wouldn't go there again. The cafe next door served expensive breakfasts but we opted for the convenience.

<Title>“Disappointing”
<Content>We stopped here 2 nights and had similar experiences to other recent reviews. Positives - great location for Empire State and Times Square. The room was small but actually clean and although showing signs of ageing, was adequate for the price paid. Disappointing aspects were the restaurant / bar attached to the hotel where the staff added 50% service charge to the bill. When challenged they said it was an error with the calculator and accepted the standard 15% that we were prepared to pay. Having read other reviewers comments since returning, I now wonder if the calculator excuse was genuine... the reception staff and the Bell hop were unhelpful. They were only keen to quote their own overpriced means of transport to get around the city. We were quoted $120-140 for a transfer to Newark when a yellow cab (who the hotel said wouldn't do it)quoted $70. When the yellow cab turned up, the Bell Hop tried to talk the driver out of taking us in favour of his own transport. We had to load our own bags on and he then had the cheek to demand a tip and then attempted to increase the fee we had negotiated with the cab driver. To say we were furious was an understatement. Our yellow cab driver was so embarrassed and apologised to us, as visitors to his beloved city. That restored our faith with New Yorkers and was given a generous tip! Our impression was that the staff at the hotel merely saw us as cash machines. We could not recommend this hotel to anyone who values customer service.

<Title>“A convenient base for exploring NYC. Basic but adequate.”
<Content>This hotel is fine as long as you're only using it as a place to sleep and wash before heading out for another adventure. As tourists, this is all my wife and I were looking for and this is what we got. Yes, the room was tiny but as long as the bed was comfy, which it was, we didn't need much else. The sink was also in the bedroom not the bathroom!!The hotel is conveniently located for access to the flurry of activity that is Times Square and also far enough south to take a strole to the more characterful downtown. The staff weren't the most helpful, it must be said. When I asked the concierge to contact our transfer company I was told that the hotel didn't 'deal with that provider'..... 'So then what are you for?!' I thought. So, in summary; has all the basics but only the basics.

<Title>“poor service”
<Content>stayed here with 7 friends for 5 nights...got a great deal in Jan when booking. all i can say is that we're all glad it was so cheap! rooms small which is fair enough but the bathroom was grubby in our room and our friends'.service was terrible.if you are requesting something like towels/extra blanket be prepared to ring reception 3 or more times. service in the bar next door was worse. we were there 3 times once before heading to the St.Patricks parade and twice in the evening for late drinks..on all occasions the service was incredibly SLOW. unbelievably slow...so frustrating to have ordered a drink and watch the bartender go back to her friend at the end of the bar and continue her chat!

<Title>“You get what you pay for....”
<Content>I am in NY frequently for business and have stayed at this hotel twice in the last few months. The location is great, the service is non-existant. The front desk will do pretty much anything to avoid conversing, let alone helping. I had an "executive suite" both visits. The lighting in the rooms was so bad, I had to take a shade off a lamp and carry it from room to room. This is one of the dirtiest hotels in NY, that I have ever stayed in. Both of the bathrooms had a mildew problem and the dirt and dust in the vents above were shocking. Carpet and furniture is quite worn. I will admit I did get a screaming deal on these rooms, but I will pay more in the future to sleep in a clean and safe environment.

<Title>“Don't trust in this hotel”
<Content>This hotel is incredibly terrible! First of all, I booked a standart room with my boyfriend and when we arrived our room was occupied. Instead of giving us a better room, they gave us a SINGLE ROOM, with a single bed for two people, after being exhausted of a long trip. The joking hadn't finished there. I'd never seen so terrible service. The doorman spent all the time looking us while we were carrying our bags. The attendance was totally stupid and inneficient. In the last day (thank god!), we paid the "good price" hotel in my boyfriend's credit card. However, surprise! My credit card, that i used for booking, was charged too, without my authorization. I saw that some days later, when my bill came and I was in my country. No receipt for this fee, no information, nothing! How can we stay in a hotel that we can't trust? You'd better pay some cents more and have no headache later, that's my advise and what i learned.

<Content>A good deal all things considered. The hotel was great - the restaurant however was awful. Prices on the bill were higher than those on the menu and a service charge for a party of two? Scandalous. The server probably needed that extra money to buy charm lessons.

<Title>“Only if you get an Excellent Deal”
<Content>I stayed at Thirty Thirty for eight nights in February. I spent the first 4 nights in a Standard Room (I was in town for a conference) and the next four nights in Superior Room (once my partner joined me). Appearance: The hotel is not rundown, but it is worn looking. It needs cosmetic attention â€“ new paint, the carpets need to be professionally cleaned, etc. Also, some of the renovations were not well done â€“ for example, the seams of the baseboards donâ€™t match up. Itâ€™s not as though these things are going to make or break your stay, itâ€™s just a small thing you notice when you realize how much choice there is for hotels in NYC and you wonder if you made the right one. The bathrooms in both rooms looked to be â€œnewlyâ€� renovated â€“ within the last 5 years â€“ but it looked like there was mould on the floor of the second one. The rooms look okay, but they are completely lacking in character. I wonder who the â€œdecoratorâ€� was â€“ there is no art on the walls (maybe thatâ€™s a good thing!) and my first room, because it was small, felt very institutional. Size: The Standard Room I was in was pretty tiny. No sink in the bathroom â€“ it was beside the bed. The tv was hung on the wall, so the only way you could watch it was by lying in bed. It was an outward facing room on the 10th floor, so there was constant night traffic sounds. By comparison, my Superior Room was inward facing on the 12th floor â€“ terrible view, but very quiet as it cut out the traffic noise. I felt very confined in the first room, even for as little time as I was spending there. The Superior Room was twice the size of the Standard Room, so you didnâ€™t feel like you were suffocating. [And because I donâ€™t know where else to put it, the lock on the bathroom door in my first room was faulty and I actually got locked in it for about 5 minutes one night following my shower. I was able to work on the lock and jiggle it free, but I had terrible visions of having to scream for help in my towel â€“ I stopped shutting the door after that!] Cleanliness: Well, I was most thankful not to see any bugs after some of the reviews I had read. The beds were made and towel were restocked, and, happily, the carpet was vacuumed, but other things were missed. The coffee maker in the room, for example, wasnâ€™t cleaned. We drank coffee before leaving and my partner left his coffee cup on the bedside table with about a quarter inch of coffee in the bottom â€“ it was still there when we came back at 11 that night. If this is outside the scope of their cleaning, fine, but most hotels are usually more thorough when they clean the room. Also, I found that the cleaning varied by floor and by night, so it seems to depend on who is working. The 10th floor was cleaner than the 12th in terms of the housekeeping. But, the 10th floor also smelled like cigarette smoke. Staff: The people at the front desk werenâ€™t unfriendly, but they werenâ€™t particularly friendly either â€“ although this varied among the person working. They answered questions, but with a couple of them it felt like an inconvenience when you were asking them. By comparison, I stayed at the Chancellor Hotel in San Francisco last year and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. When thereâ€™s so much choice for places to stay, something like customer service can really make a difference. The manager was unhelpful/ unfriendly when we asked him a question. BUT, I was able to check in early on the Saturday I arrived, so that was really nice. Location: Pretty good location. Right near the subway (Park) and there are 3 deli/groceries nearby, which are open late or all night. If youâ€™re walking back from Time Square late, stick to Madison or Park and 34th, some of the other little streets arenâ€™t well lit. That said, at no time did I feel uncomfortable or unsafe walking alone. We ate one breakfast at the hotel restaurant. It was a little pricey in comparison to nearby places, but the food and service were good. Price: In a way, if price is an issue for you too, it all comes down to this. We got fantastic deals. I paid $104 per night for the Standard Room and we paid $118 per night for the Superior Room. If I had paid anything more than that, I would have been really upset with the hotel. Our rooms were booked in December. The website prices for the same rooms are currently more than double what we paid and I canâ€™t imagine paying that much for what we got. But, maybe they save the really nice rooms for people who pay more! Would I return? Probably not unless I got the same deal and then only in the Superior Room as the Standard Room was way too small.

<Content>Our room was updated, very clean, and the location was good. I do recommend this hotel and plan to stay there again. The only negatives are 1 - that one of the front desk clerks knew nothing about the vicinity, and 2-the attached restaurant is overpriced and the breakfast muffin was very dry, and 3- trash pickup & horns after midnight (take ear plugs as I would recommend for any NYC hotel).

<Content>I stayed here for 3 nights in Feb. 2009. The hotel is excellently located and very accessible to the subway. My room was quite small however it was clean and met my needs just fine. I had limited dealings with the staff, just check-in and check-out but found them to be pleasant. My only complaint was that the bathroom smelled of cigarette smoke which seemed to come from the ventilation. I appreciated having wireless internet in the room. I would stay here again on my next trip to NYC.

<Content>I stayed in Thirty Thirty last year and although it's not the Ritz, we found it clean and comfortable. the rooms aren't huge but we were hardly in them as there is so much to do in the city. The staff were polite and helped me to organsie a transfer to the airport on my departure. The bathroom was clean and a decent size. On the ground floor was a really nice pizzeria/restaurant. The location is excellent- walking distance to the Empire Stares Building and Central Park. Don't hesitate to book if you want a good value central hotel.

<Title>“Clean, centrally located hotel I would definitely recommend”
<Content>Our room was small but that's what we were expecting - the main thing was that it was clean. We were provided with a safe which was great for storing passports and currency. Room was cleaned/tidied every day, although we had to ask for some things to be replenished at reception, eg loo roll and shampoo. But overall we were really impressed with this hotel, especially as it's so close to the main attractions, especially the Empire State Building and Macy's. Also close to subway routes, and a 2-minute walk from the fabulous Les Halles brasserie. I'd definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Great staff, definitely a good hotel, don't worry!”
<Content>I first booked the Hotel Thirty Thity because I wanted somewhere in Mid Town but at a low price, yet still offering nice rooms! From the website I decided just to go for it, as I couldn't find any better offers, and it looked absolutely fine to me. Holidays in New York are never all about the hotel anyway! I later was browsing through trip adviser, reading some reviews to check out what people thought. Although the good were good, the bad seemed very bad, this left me feeling pretty worried. When the taxi pulled up to the hotel I thought what is all the fuss about, Maybe the awning over the front door was a little tatty, but apart from that I could see the Zana restaurant looked nice and the souvenir would be the perfect place to pick up some camera batteries. The crocked knife across the road I saw immediately, it really is across the road and is great for a quick beer, as is Rosie O'â€¦ on 46th street. The hotel entrance seemed like any other nice hotel and the internet was perfect for checking in the day before we left. When we checked in everything ran smoothly, and I pretty much decided only fuss pots complained on trip adviser, We had a family room and it was pretty big. There were even two armchairs at one end! The Plasma scene TV and the coffee machine in the room were great. And the big bathroom with the huge shower was great. The Hotel Thirty Thirty was fine, and if you have booked here you really do have nothing to worry about. If its lush awnings over the doorway you're after, maybe don't come here but for a great hotel, close to fifth ave and many tourist hot spots it's great. There is a good doorman who takes care of your stuff on your last day to, and gets you a cab to the airport. The people on reception are great to, they even book your tickets for you! They got us SATC tours for the same day!

<Title>“Would stay at this hotel again”
<Content>Me and my boyfriend have just returned from a long weekend in New York and stayed at the Thirty Thirty. The taxi from JFK was $55 which included the toll and a tip. When I booked the hotel I asked for a quiet room on a high floor and we were pleased to have been given a room on the 11th floor which was very quiet and had a large bathroom with a shower and a bath. The bed was very comfy and the room was cleaned daily with fresh towels etc. On checking you need to either give your credit card details or $50 dollars and this will be refunded when you check out (as long as you don't use the phone or internet). We arrived at the hotel early, check in is at 3pm so we left our bags with reception as we wanted to explore the city. The hotel is 2/3 blocks away from the Empire State building and Maddison Square. It is a really good location. There is a nice restaurant/bar across the road called the Crocked Knife, the food is reasonably priced and the staff are friendly. On checking out we left our bags with the porter as we didn't need to leave for the airport until 6pm. The porter also arranged for a taxi to pick us up ( a black one not a yellow cab), this was $60 which incuded a tip. It saved the hassle of hailing one from outside which you could have done. I think this service is done on the side though, so you may have to ask about this away from the reception staff. Overall we would stay at this hotel again for its price and location.

Staff were friendly and efficient , had a problem with a toilet cistern which flushed itself randomly this was fixed promptly and we were offered another room if it couldnt be fixed quickly.Room was on small side but more than enough space for me and my shopaholic wife to sleep and store our ever expanding purchases ,other than sleeping or getting ready to go out didnt spend much time in room as so much to do and see.Room had cable tv ,coffee perculator, hairdryer and iron/board. Maid service daily.lots of places to eat at , loved a little place called Tasty on Madison ave less than one minute walk , breakfasted ther daily and planned our day. Holiday was to celebrate my 40th birthday, i was expecting a lot from N.Y. and it didnt let us down,was a holiday of a lifetime .fave places top of the rock ,central park ,statue of liberty and the soho and greenwich village areas. Top tip wear comfy boots!

<Title>“Yuck”
<Content>The only positive thing about this hotel is the location. The rooms are very small and smell awful. I had to keep a candle burning just to mask the smell. The beds are small and uncomfortable. The bathrooms are tiny and dated. Nothing about the room felt clean. The front desk personnel are unfriendly and inept. They checked me into a room that I was to share with a co-worker and it had only 1 bed. When I brought it to their attention, they said I was mistaken. They finally gave me another room which had 2 beds but was just as small and smelled just as bad as the original room. Be sure you go to the front desk to check out in person since apparently this is the only hotel left that doesn't do an automatic check-out and slip your bill under the room door. If you fail to check out in person by noon, they will charge your card for an additional day. Keep your fingers crossed that their computers aren't 'down' when you go to check out. I will never stay here again nor will I recommend it to anyone I like.

<Title>“Very Noisy! Will Never Stay There Again”
<Content>During my first visit a few weeks ago, the fire alarm went off for 45 minutes at 1:00 am on a Saturday. (There was no fire or even smoke anywhere in the hotel, the desk staff told me the next day.) It went on and off for an hour after that. On a second (and last) visit, there was construction going on in many rooms of the hotel. I was moved when I complained, but the second room was next to another room next door to construction. At this point I gave up and moved to another hotel the next day. The desk personnel are pleasant mostly, but a balding guy (Kyriades ?) is kind of dim-witted. Perhaps a full barrel of caffeine would improve his level of alertness.

<Title>“"Excellent Location"”
<Content>Arriving at the airport we were approached by quiet a few drivers looking to take us into the city in there private shuttles. The airport advise you not to avail of these services. After a long flight from dublin with a five hour delay i wasnt bothered who took me and my family to the hotel. I asked one of the drivers for his I.D and he showed me. He charged 15 dollars each( there was 5 of us) , so altogether 75 dollars, 90 with tip. His shuttle car was very comfortable and got us to our hotel in 45 minutes. HOTEL First impressions of the hotel are poor. Looks quiet run down from the outside, but so are most old buildings in New York. The reception is very nice, very clean and spacious. A porter took our luggage off us straight away and waited with us until we checked in. Check in went smoothly. We were ask to produce our credit cards as a holding fee for any extra charges, which is normal in any hotel. However we didnt have credit cards and were asked to give 50 dollars instead per room which was refunded at the end of our stay. The porter kindly brought our bags to the two rooms we had booked for the 4 nights with a tip of 5 dollars. ROOMS Myself and my girlfriend were given a small but comfortable double room (404), with a front facing street view. The bed was extremely comfortable. Bathroom was very clean with a good shower. This room was perfect for the both of us. Towels were provided every day and room was cleaned everyday if need. We left the do not disturb sign on the door one of the days while we were out in the city and room wasn't cleaned. Our fault nobody else's. My parents and brother had a triple family room on the 11th floor (1138) This room was excellent. Sofa bed as you entered the room with a dressing table and tv, all in a separate living area. Bedroom was opposite with a plasma tv on the wall and a cd player beside the bed. Bed was a super king bed, huge!!! Bathroom was really nice and modern, standard of a 5* hotel. Breakfast in the hotel is terrible. Service was very poor. Plenty of little diners on maddison avenue to eat instead of here. We ate out every night in different restaurants, plenty to choose from. The closer to time square the more expensive it is to eat. Across the road from hotel is the crooked knife bar and restaurant. This was nice but there is nicer out there in the city. Was great for a quiet drink (pint miller 3 dollars)!!!!!! If you want to see all of manhattan make sure to do the hop-on hop- off bus. It will take you around the city up town and down town, were you can jump off at any stop. Buses pass by every ten minutes for you to jump back on. Stops at empire state, time square, china town, greenwich village, soho, ground zero, central park and many more. On our return to the airport we made the mistake of booking a car and driver from the porter and were charged 110 dollars. We all wanted to travel together in one car. The yellow cabs will take you to and from the airport for 45 dollars flat fare. I would recommend this hotel as a base for your stay, great location, great bed, great family rooms!

<Title>“Reserved at first...!”
<Content>After reading other reviews I went to New York with doubts about my hotel booking! When arriving at the hotel I wasn't too keen on the up keep of the street but the hotel did stand out. We where placed on the 6th floor into a spacious room, only problem was there was no storage and the bathroom was awful! The room was spotless, don't get me wrong and it wasn't small but it looked nothing like the photo's and was going by all the bad reviews I'd read previously. The location of the hotel is good (not for Central Park and your feet!) and I felt really safe walking around at night. The beer we found to be expensive but at the bar across the road (Crooked Knife) has Miller on tap for $3 so that was the drink of choice! In the end I sent my partner downstairs to chat up the receptionist and get our room changed as I couldn't take it anymore! They where every helpful and we moved within minutes of letting them know our issues (the dreaded bathroom!). The room they moved us too was great, a lot bigger and a great view of the Empire State Builing - I was as happy as anything! If all the rooms are similar to the one we stayed in then I would recommend the hotel highly. We didn't have tea or coffee facilities but a Starbucks and Subtletea round the corner was just as easy and the bathroom was small but so clean and had plenty of storage. All in all, (in the end) I was pleased with the hotel, I suggest if you have any problems with your room, ask to change, as we where there for a week it was definately worth it!

<Title>“Worst Hotel I've Stayed At”
<Content>Can't we give a ZERO star rating????? I understand that New York hotels are supposed to be small, but this was ridiculous. The hotel's website should be banned for false advertisement. The room smelled like sewage, the windows didn't close properly (my stay was during a snow storm!), the room was quite old, and the front desk was TERRIBLE! The hotel's employees are unfriendly and they seem quite depressed (somewhat how the room made us feel). Also, the website had a special of free breakfast at the restaurant next door and the front desk girl (named Daniela) did not fix the problem and was rude on top of it all. Don't be fooled. The room/hotel is NOT worth it.

<Title>“brilliant location, good room, bad service”
<Content>we went at the end of jan this year, the hotel was a really good location literally 4 blocks from empire state building, 2 blocks from a subway, right on 5th avenue and loads of eating places around us, however, we walked into the hotel after being on a high from a very easy trip through and was confronted with a not so nice surprise from the reception, in a very harsh tone she said we could not have our room unless we paid $250 each person for the room charges, we didnt know this so we refused and she said 'no dollar no room!' again we refused and she slammed the key card on the counter, this was a not so nice start to our hol room was ok, dont expect views, cleanliness was good, location excellent though

<Title>“New York, New York! Yeah!”
<Content>A well located hotel on 30th Street, Manhatten. The rooms were basic, but clean and pleasant. No bath, to the dismay of my good lady, but a very good shower. There are really no other facilities there, pay-per-use internet and a conceirge, but that's about it! The lobby was overly modern ( and overly big), in stone cladding, with helpful reception staff. Use it as a base, not a destination, sleep then get out into the city!

<Title>“Hotel Thirty Thirty - Would use again!”
<Content>I did have some concerns about this hotel prior to my stay on 19th January 2009. But upon my return, I can happily say it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience! I had emailed the manager in October 2008 asking for a room upgrade & he agreed to upgrade my room to a superior room for free. When I arrived at the hotel to check in, they had no notes of a room upgrade. Thankfully I had brought the email with me, and after speaking with the manager our room was upgraded to a deluxe room,....FREE OF CHARGE! The room was outstanding. We had 2 double beds, a sofa, desk & chair & a massive bathroom with double shower. The heating is noisy & on the first night it did wake me up when it kicked in, but after that I simply switched it off when we went to bed. It worked very well & our room was always lovely & warm. The maid service was impeccable. We had clean towels every day & at no point can I complain about the cleanliness. We also had the New York Post left outside our room everyday which was a nice touch. The room was very quiet & we had a front facing room, but couldn't hear any noise from outside. The large lobby had 3 computers & payphones so it was easy to keep in touch with home. The staff in general were very nice, but one of the porters seemed to take it very personally that we didn't book our return car to the airport via him, but instead via the reception desk. The car cost $73 but the service was fantastic. We also had to pay a deposit of $50 upon arrival at the hotel which we hadn't previously been made away of. The location was excellent, 10 minutes from 5th Ave & about 20 minutes from Times Square. The Crooked Knife opposite served excellent food at very good prices. I am already looking at going again next year & would use this hotel without question!

<Title>“Great Hotel, Great Value!”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at the Thirty Thirty Hotel in Jan 2009 and we were very impressed with the place. After reading a number of mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. We arrived VERY early (10 am) and the front desk attendant, Daniela, was outstanding... she offered us a room right away even though check in wasnt for several hours!! We happily accepted it and once we arrived at the room, I was somewhat shocked at how small it was, but I didn't come to NY for the hotel room... The bathroom was nice and spacious. Throughout our stay, our room was made up daily and we were given fresh towels everyday =] LOVED THAT! When we requested an ice bucket for our room, it was taken care of immediately... we had no issues AT ALL staying here and I would absolutely return, we got an incredible deal for a hotel that was VERY VERY close to everything- walking distance to Times Square and great shopping!!!

<Content>Group of us went to this hotel for a New Year Break. Rooms varied from small to a cupboard. Bathrooms varied too. Clean rooms, beds comfortable, service Ok but one porter a bit too ready with his hand out! Little storage space and nowhere to put bags. Desk servcie good and helpful . Heating very noisy!! Bar restaurant attached is expensive, try Tasty across on Maddison, great breakfasts and good service. Lunch good too and not expensive. The Crooked Knife opposite is good for Dinner, good food good service. The hotel is well placed for Metro and walking in Manhatten. Ok but could all do with a refurb!

<Title>“Basic NYC hotel, perfect for location not for luxury!”
<Content>After reading reviews I was very worried our travel agent booked us this hotel as part of our honeymoon package within our budget, to the caribbean and new york! However we did say we wanted luxury in the Caribbean and budget hotel in New York. The hotel's standard rooms are small but for 3 days we only spent a few hours in total in the room asleep. Out from breakfast til the evening. Because you are so close to everything - we would drop off our shopping and pop back out again. If you are looking for luxury and views then don't stay here but if you want an easy base away from the noise, hussle and bustle and traffic then STAY here!

<Title>“Fantastic Location”
<Content>We stayed in this hotel over New Year. We found the staff to be polite not that we had much to do with them as we only spoke to the desk when we checked in and out. The doorman was always friendly. The room was not the biggest and was at the back of the hotel so no view, but we went to New york to see the sights not sit in our hotel room. The room was cleaned every day nice clean sheets and towels and the bed was comfy. The location of this hotel was brilliant we walked everywhere didn't need a cab or the subway. we went right down to battery park and right up to Central park it was all within walking distance. walking around we saw all the sights and came across things we wouldn't have seen had we taken cab's everywhere.If you want a great breakfast visit the Murray Hill Diner on lexington Avenue 34th Street. Fantastic holiday brilliant location now planning next trip. wouldn't hesitate to recomend this hotel to anybody who just want's a comfortable place to lay there head after a busy day sight seeing and shopping.

<Title>“Nice Hotel, Excellent Value”
<Content>We stayed at the Hotel 30 30 the weekend of Dec. 12th. We booked a superior room through the hotelâ€™s own website and paid $171/nt plus tax (avg for 3 nights). I have done my fair share of traveling and stayed in a wide variety of â€œaccommodations.â€� I can whole-heartedly recommend this hotel for those on a â€œbudgetâ€� in NYC. In fact, the rate we paid for this particular weekend at 30 30 was far less than comparable hotels like POD and LESS than hotels which appeared less aesthetically pleasing AND didnâ€™t even have a private bathroom (i.e. Americana, etc.). Iâ€™ll comment on the things that I find important for a budget traveler in NYC (bc I doubt those agonizing between the Ritz and Four Seasons are reading this review)â€¦ and like others have said, who goes to NYC to sit in a hotel room?? Location: Superb!! Just a couple street south of Macyâ€™s/Empire state area in Midtown. It is on a quiet street 2 blocks (<5 min walk) to a subway station â€“ the green line, 2 stops form grand central, 10-15 min total to times square). There are several places to get breakfast/coffee close by, including starbucks about 20 ft away. Great location! Rooms: We had a superior room which wad a desk, chair, wardrobe w safe and a decent sized bathroom with shower/tub combo and sink in the bathroom itself. The room was small but nicely appointed, modern and CLEAN. The bead was very comfortable and the linens were quite luxurious for a 2 star hotel. There supposedly was internet in the rooms, however ours did not work, and even a call to the service provider never resolved the issue. This was my biggest negative of the hotel. The only other complaint is that in our particular room, the head of the bed was directly in front of the door, which made the hallway noise a bit loud in the mornings. Not all badâ€¦ got us up and out of bed (talking 8-9 am here). Put a towel down the last night and didnâ€™t hear a thing. The temperature was very comfortable, your could easily open the windows if needed and there was a heater in the room. Of note, I feel that the website very accurately depicts the hotel. Service: We found it to be friendly. Check in/out went smoothly. They even recommended some good restaurants to us. The maid service did a good job cleaning everyday. Had to ask for more towels onceâ€¦ did have to wait almost 20 minutes for themâ€¦ so average service. Overall, considering the price we paid and the price of other similar hotels, I feel that Hotel 30 30 is an excellent bargain. It is a nice hotel with an excellent location. It is clean and safe. I recommend it for anyone in the sub $250/night range (at least in mid dec). Biggest negative was that the internet did not work in our room.

<Title>“What a disappointment”
<Content>We were visiting NY for my husband's 50th birthday and the recent reviews of this hotel gave me hope that I had nothing to worry about. The reality was different. We were in a tiny room at the back of the hotel which I'm sure was only meant to be for single occupancy. There was hardly room to move around and the bathroom consisted of a shower and toilet with the washbasin in the bedroom. The bathroom also reeked of stale tobacco smoke (obviously used by previous occupants to avoid the smoke detectors in the bedroom). There was no rack to put baggage or chair for clothing - we had to use the tiny available floorspace.The housekeeping was poor, insufficient towels, bathroom supplies etc. For 2 days the water in the washbasin ran brown, leaving a sediment in the basin. I understand that work was being undertaken in the area surrounding the hotel but the water in the shower was unaffected! We had to buy bottled water for brushing teeth. The staff were very indifferent about everything we mentioned and said there was nothing they could do. We did not experience any of the helpful, friendly staff mentioned by others except for the very helpful porter. We were just glad to be out so much and not have to spend any time in the room as it did not lend itself to relaxing after such active days. The only plus side, the bed was comfy. At least NY was worth it - the hotel I'm afraid, a big disappointment.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>The room was basic, but we didn't go to New York for the hotel! We had a comfy bed ,wardrobe with a safe and a bathroom half the size of the room. It was clean and tidy. The hotel had internet access and the rooms were very warm, we slept with the window open a jar every night. There was no sirens going all night like some of our friends experienced in other hotels. The hotel was in a great location and we could walk to the empire state building, Times Sq, Macy's and Madison square garden. I would recommend this hotel to family and friends and I would stay there again without hesitation. If you want a large room with great decor and all the comforts of home and you intend on staying in your room for some time then this isn't the hotel for you but as a base it is great!!!

<Title>“Thumbs Up for the 30 30”
<Content>I have just returned from a stay from the 30 30 and all I have is good comments. I can't understand why some people complain, is it because they are used to 5* but booked a 3* - I think that might have something to do with it! I would definately stay here again, the rooms were clean, definately not small, towels changed, bathroom cleaned and beds made up every day. The staff could not have been more helpful, especially when we had checked out and were waiting to come home and my phone battery dies, I asked the reception staff if they would mind charging my phone, not a problem. Ok, so some staff are not English/American, however how many hotels have you been to in the UK that have a full team of local staff? The restaurant attached to the hotel, Zana's is ideal for breakfast, however I would definately suggest the Crooked Knife across the road for an evening meal or even a pre/after night out drink. Ideally located for the subway, 3 blocks up around the corner, 5 minute walk if that. Macy's, Empire State Building and much much more all within walking distance. As a Travel Agent in the UK I would definately recommend this to my clients as a clean base for those on a budget looking for a comfortable and ideally located base with friendly staff. After all who in their right mind comes to a city like New York to admire the hotel room, certainly not me, life is too short to worry about silly little things, get out there and see what this city has to offer and believe me there is everything. Again I stress that if you are a usual 5* or deluxe guest you may find that this is not quite your standard.

<Content>After reading some of the reviews I was a little worried about Thirty Thirty - I was so pleasantly surprised with this hotel. Our room was fantastic (the deluxe with two queen beds), bathroom was huge and clean and the staff very pleasant. The location is brilliant - we literally walked everywhere. Very close to the subway too. Great little Mexican place called Dos Caminos just a few blocks away on Park Ave - it was fantastic. Cute pub across the street too - Crooked Knife. Not sure where some of the other people who have reviewed this hotel were staying - we loved it and would definitely return.

<Content>My intial thoughts were good, lobby was nice and clean but at check in the staff member who spoke broken english tried to tell me my reservation was for the following day. after several minutes explaining I knew when i was supposed to arrive I took out my receipt which showed I was correct. she then stated that she would have to charge me and additional $10 because she had to change the date even though to no fault of my own or the hotel web site i had booked through... the only people that had the wrong date was the 30-30... the other staff member seemed to be on the phone with a friend and was loud and unprofessional. the bell man was excellent however... over all it was fine the rooms were small although clean, shower was very hot, beds and numerous pillows were comfortable. location was good in midtown close to time square or greenich village if you go the other way.. staff not very helpful (besides bellman) with questions about places to eat.. etc.... bartender at attached resturant was nice and outgoing

<Title>“brilliant family room”
<Content>We visited New York from england for a 5day visit in september to celebrate my mums 50th. We had booked a family room so that we could all stay together. On arrival the check in was great, doorman took our luggage straight up to our room. The family sized room was great!! compared to some other photos I have seen from other rooms im sure its triple the size! We had two double (if not king sized) beds, two tvs (one facing towards the beds, the other facing the lounge area) A sofa, an arm chair, and two large windows overlooking the street below. The shower was quite large, although the temperature seemed a little annoying to get right. Lots of wardrobe and draw space which is good if you're on a longer visit and want to unpack. However the room we had did have an ironing board+iron, coffee machine and a safe.

<Title>“Loved it!”
<Content>After reading some of the other reviews about the Thirty Thirty, I was pretty worried about my forthcoming visit! However, I had nothing to be worried about! We stayed for 5 nights from November 11th. We arrived tired after the flight from London to a very warm welcome, and we were able to check in early. Our room was big - we only booked a standard room, so maybe we got lucky. It was very clean, with a big bathroom, a kitchenette, tv, safe, hairdryer etc etc. There was daily maid service, and all the reception staff that we dealt with were friendly and helpful. I didn't notice any of the dirtyness or bad smells that others had commented on! The hotel is also in a great location. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others!

<Title>“Absolutely fantastic”
<Content>Stayed at the Thirty Thirty hotel with my boyfriend for 5 nights from 10th November to 15th. On arrival we found the reception staff to be very welcoming, helpful and friendly. After booking in we went to our standard room and from reading previous reviews on this web set I was hoping that the room would be ok. We had requested to stay at the front of the hotel and this request was honoured. On arriving at the room we found it to be extremely clean, yes standard in size but going on New York standards the room was large. We had plenty of space for our suitcases and shopping bags. The room had a large double bed, side lockers, large lamps, TV and very modern paintings. The bathroom was fine, toilet, sink, and shower, again standards size but no issues here. The room was cleaned on a daily bases with towels changed. Mid week the sheets etc were changes from the bed. Each morning we had a paper deliver to the room, this was no extra charge, and standard to the hotel each other guest received this also. When we asked for directions to tourist attractions we found the reception staff to be absolutely fabulous they were so caring in making sure we got to were every we wanted to go. Also there is a restaurant across the road from the hotel I had also read about this in previous reviews but I strongly recommend this restaurant. ''The Crooked Knife'' the food here was beautiful, we dined here three out of the five nights, value for money, quality of food and service was second to none. There was also a small bar attached to the restaurant so you could go for a few drinks here after dinner if you liked. This was my first time in New York and after booking the hotel and reading reviews I was nervous about the hotel but honestly I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel or staying here in the future.

<Title>“Brilliant”
<Content>we would return; We stayed at this hotel from the 5th Nov 08 and after reading the reviews was a little worried but on arrival we knew we had nothing to worry about. Reception area was very clean and had useful info in the lobby area, the staff were extremley helpful throughtout our stay. Our room was small but this is what i expected of new york, the bed was comfy and large, we had a tv, safe and chair and the bathroom was clean, we had no problems, our view was of thirty street not much to look at but your never in your room really. The location of the hotel was great 2 minutes to 5th Avenue and a ten minute walk to times square- we went to madisson square garden to watch the joe calzaghe fight while we were there and the hotel was perfect for this it took us 5 minutes to walk. Gordan Ramsey's restaurant is a must for New York we found this fantastic value $35pp for 3 course in the maze section. We ate at Crooked Knife accross from thirty thirty had 2 courses and that came Â£75 nice but it just didnt compare. overall i found this hotel and new york great!!

<Title>“Delighted”
<Content>My girlfriend and I stayed at Thirty Thirty for 5 nights in Oct.2008. We had booked a Premium king room through the hotel website. ( I think the Premium King is only available directly from the hotel ) Room was spacious- more like a suite than a room. Sofa bed and king size bed. Bedding was lovely. We slept with the window open and found it very quiet. Room was clean and temperture was not a problem. Bathroom was very modern though lighting was poor. Staff were friendly. Location was good. We were delighted with our room and would recommend the hotel to others.

<Title>“They 'Lost' our booking and left us stranded”
<Content>Thank goodness we called... We booked two rooms for a recent birthday trip to new york, and sent an email to the hotel to add another room, only to have a reply sent to us saying that they would not honor the reservation we already had. They had lost it! We expected an apology and some attempt to make amends but were treated with disinterest. Although they had some rooms left, they expected us to pay a premium rate for a last minute booking. Disgraceful. Avoid at all costs.

<Title>“Not really that bad at all.”
<Content>After reading so many negative reviews we were very unsure about staying at this hotel. Thankfully our stay was not bad at all. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Clean towels everyday and if you needed anything else you only had to ask and it was there. Standard rooms would not be a good idea, very tiny indeed. We upgraded to a superior and it was worth it for the extra room you got. Two things with the room, the aircon unit was extremely noisy there was no way you could have slept with it on, thankfully the weather was not that hot, and the bathroom was quite small and dated. Plenty of places to eat and drink within walking distance. The Crooked Knife across the road was great. Very friendly and reasonably priced. Shame its not open for breakfast as Zana's, attached to the hotel, was overpriced. We would not stay there again purely because we prefer to be based closer to Broadway and Times Square as there is more going on in the evenings. During the day you practically walk everywhere or get the subway. On our last night we had dinner at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant The London. Fantastic and well worth the expense! We love New York and can't wait to go back again!

<Title>“Location is all it has going for it!”
<Content>I too had read the reviews on this site and was hoping and praying that my experience would be a good one. UNFORTUNATELY, my luck was not in. I can quite happily accept a small room - which this was, but the room was horrible. The lobby, lifts, corridors and rooms all smelt of insect repellant. The carpet was soiled with goodness knows what, the bed sheets were torn, though clean and the doors were hardly secure. The air conditioning did not work and the room was freezing, my friends room on the other hand was boiling, her air con did not work either. We were on the 7th floor and did encounter some of the "residents". I did not stand barefoot on the floor at all during my stay and left all my clothes in my suitcase. I met an American guest in the lift whose room was on floor 2 - he said his room was nice. This got me thinking - are rooms allocated per nationality, age, appearance? I hated everything about the interior of this hotel and would not kennel my dogs there. The location was good but i'd rather have had a bit more of a walk and a pleasant room for my money. New York is fab and I can't wait to return - but definitely not here - good luck if you're booked in.

<Title>“We were a bit worried about this hotel”
<Content>We were a bit worried about this hotel after reading some of the reviews. On arrival we were looking for the miserable staff, but found them all fine. Our room was a bit small, but had everything in it, shower room with basin and w.c. clean towels each day and complementary toiletries. We had a safe, hair dryer, iron and board. Beds very clean and comfy. Room overlooked front of hotel. Only woken once by refuse collectors. We were looking for the cockroaches, but couldn't find any. Plenty of mosquitos though. We had to buy a spray and use it 3/4 times a day. Found if you keep fan on in the room it kept them away. We were lucky with weather (9 - 15th October) so we had no complaints at all. Great time altogether. Look forward to our return next year.

<Title>“absolutely fine!”
<Content>As you may have read previous reviews i was very nervous about my stay at the thirty thirty hotel! i read horror stories of rooms being dirty tiny nd arrogant staff so you can imagine my relief when myself and my partner where greeted by very friendly staff escially at the door! we was shown to a room which was wrong ( i wanted a smoking room ) so we asked if we could change and receptionist was more than happy to change us, apologising to us for the mishap. once settled into our standard room, which was the right size for us, nice comfy double bed clean sheets with duvet covers lol, no cigarette burns anywhere lol and our socks were defenetly clean from walking around the room, i wont lie it wasn't a massive room but spacious enough to fit 2 suitcases endless bags of shopping lol and enough hangers to hang clothes. Bathroom was a normal size with a large shower bit, clean and maids changed towels and sheets every day. We had a view of the main street and we could see the empire state building!! We was only there 4 nights which was perfect location for us, five minutes from empire state building little more a stroll nd you're at macys little more nd its times square!! PERFECT LOCATION felt safe walking at night time there. My overall experience was positive, felt the staff was friendly enough and the room was clean and reached my expectations. If you feel the need to moan for size of the room not being to your standards why book into a 3 star you cant expect to have a royalty type of room!! and belive me im picky if there was anything to complain about i would written an even longer review!! obviously if you are looking for a honeymoon i wouldnt suggest this hotel because it is basic and i know i would want something a little bit fancier but for a quick getaway its great!!

<Title>“Could be OK but staff ruins it!”
<Content>economy lobby and ok rooms aside, this hotel which wants to be hip and cool is ruined by an unfriendly staff that does not really speak english. what happened thanks to the sub-par staff? - i was told that I could park in front of the hotel, yet my car got towed and impounded. - a hold was put on my card for a week's worth of nights instead of three. - and the hold stayed on my card for about three weeks!!

<Title>“Love NYC”
<Content>My Partner and I visited this hotel in Dec 2006 and we would not hesitate to return. We went for a short 4 day break mainly for shopping purposes - well it is NYC :o) The hotel staff were very helpful, and were more than happy to move us from the 4th floor to the 2nd floor due to my fear of lifts! NYC wasn't really the place to got with this fear was it, but hey ho!! The hotel is located 5 minutes away from the Empire State Building and approx. 10-15 minutes walk from the glorious Macy's. The area of this hotel was perfect for us, it was close enough to a few main hotspots and only a short taxi ride away from 5th Avenue and Time Square. When we visited this hotel the USD was approx. $1.96 : Â£1 so you can imagine my excitement at visiting Macy's and Tiffany & Co with the rate this good :o) The retaurant, which was attached to the hotel was acceptable although nothing spectacular. Personally I would recommend looking through the restaurant guide in your room and ringing up to make reservations with them. Don't get me wrong, I struggled with this to start with, as I am used to going on package deals, so this for me was an adventure!! However, I am so glad that we reviewed the restaurant guides as our two evenings out were fantastic. We did the World Yacht cruise one night, to see the sights and to enjoy a three course meal. Another night we visited Bobby Vans Steakhouse, which was fantastic. It was full of excitable American locals and the food was beautiful. Once finished, flag down a taxi right outside (be prepared to stand in the road to do this!!) and away you go back to the Thirty Thirty! We definitely want to go back to NYC and would easily go back to this hotel. If however I can overcome my lift phobia - I may be brave enough to visit a high rise hotel in Time Square :o)

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of August the hotel is in a great location and if youâ€™re going to sight see and shop then it is more than adequate for your needs. The location is fantastic itâ€™s within walking distance to the Empire State Building, Bryant Park, Grand Central Station, Madison Square Gardens, Macys, Times Square and the theatre area. The room was clean but very small (you almost don't have space to put your luggage), a bit shabby and the view from the room over looked an office block. The bathroom was clean but also very small and it needed updating. The beds are small two, but comfortable. There was no drink making facilities in the room. The bedding and towels were changed daily. The reception was nice and big, the staff were ok some were not over friendly or helpful. The porters were great and very helpful with your baggage and were able to answer your queries that you would have asked at the front desk one I must commend is Mohammed. There is a little restaurant to the left hand side of the hotel and there is a small cafe attached to the hotel we didnâ€™t try either. There is an excellent restaurant opposite the hotel the Crooked Knife and if you walk a block there are bars, restaurants and clubs.

<Title>“Awful property!! Website not realistic!”
<Content>This hotel is absolutely disgusting. We booked online directly with them and the pictures of a standard room on their website are NOT AT ALL what you get upon check-in. The room was tiny, with ripped and dirty carpeting, chips all over the walls, a broken TV and smelled awful. We went downstairs and complained and the front desk would not waive the cancellation fee if we left so we were forced to stay one night. We were upgraded for that one night and the suite was ok, but still not nice. We left the next day without another hotel room confirmed and this was when the UN was in session mind you so we really took a risk not finding alternative accommodations. But that is how BAD this place is. I would rather sleep on a park bench than set foot in this filthy hotel room again. Avoid this hotel!

<Title>“Dirty Thirty”
<Content>Myself and my partner stayed here for 5 nights and at first when we walked in reception was quite nice the staff we ok but not over friendly, but on entry to our room we were very disapointed the headboard had a big cigarette burn in it, the carpet was so dirty that our socks was black, the bed clothes did not smell to good and the sheets were ripped, our view from the room over looked an office block, we did not complain as we were only there for a short break and did not intend on spending it in the room thank goodness!! On our last night we came back a bit earlier to find cockroaches running around the room this was the final straw and did take this further. Will definatly be going back to New York but would never stay in this hotel even if it was for free!!!!!

<Title>“Pay for the Executive Rooms and you won't be disappointed !!”
<Content>I have stayed in this hotel on three occcasions now, all for business, in three different class of rooms, one thing can be said for the Thirty Thirty, you get what you pay for !! With this hotel, if you stay in the standard rooms then be prepared as they are not great, very small and a bit shabby and please don't even contemplate the single rooms, couldnt swing a cat and not for those who don't like small spaces. They have some hostel rooms still in the building, a condition of its change of use to a hotel I believe, I had one opposite me on my first stay, not a nice experience, music and shouting and some smelly neighbours. Noisy air con too and the bathroom, though clean, needed updating, you also need to mind your head on the tv!! However, having stated the bad, on my next stay I was in an Executive Room and could not believe it was the same hotel. 7 foot wide bed, huge living area with large sofa and a bathroom, all slate, to die for. A shower big enough for a rugby team.!! The photos on their web site definately show the better rooms. If you want to stay in a great location then I would recommend this hotel, as long as you pay the price for the better rooms. There is a small cafe attached to the hotel for breakfast or you can walk a block for loads of other places, there are bars, restaurants and clubs within 200 yds.

<Title>“Very Good Location”
<Content>This is a very expensive hotel for european patterns, as we check its amenities. But, as we are in New York, not a bad deal at all. The location of this hotel is great. You can walk everywhere any time day or night, as you feel absolutely safe in this area. We are not very far from the Empire State Building, Bryant Park, Grand Central Station and the cinemas in 3rd avenue, which was great to relax one of the two nights we stood there. The room was very small, you almost don't have space to put your lugagge, but the bathroom was very large and clean. Beds are small two, but very confortable. The noisy generator was a problem, but we were so tired we slept all night. The staff is great and they were very helpful. All travellers have a great base to explore NYC from here. We stood in another hotel a few days later, cheaper and more confortable, but I still loved Thirty Thirty for its location and definitively would come back.

<Title>“mmmmm, its an 8 pinter”
<Content>After a gallon of ale you might appreciate it, hopefully its like a fine wine - it will get better with age! Originally booked into the Holiday Inn with b&b and a gym - then told we had been double booked and they upgraded us to this [--] - same amenities - minus b&b & gym!!! Hotel Thirty Thirty, more like Hotel Zero, Zero! Reception staff unhelpful - no restaurant, no bar, no nothing.... Not a complainer - anyone who's been to the Brighton House Hotel in Skeggy - knows exactly where we're coming from - oooh the memories.... Good location - no complaints. Went for New Year - Times Square - very disappointed. Will read the reviews before going next time!!

<Title>“An absolute dump!”
<Content>I would not recommend this hotel to anyone! The hotel Thirty Thirty was the final destination for our honeymoon in August 2008 and was a great disappointment - so much so that we left after 10 minutes and checked in to a more reputable establishment! On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by drunken homeless people sleeping in the window bays. The bell boy proceeded to show us to our bedroom, as we approached we noticed that the door on the room opposite ours was hanging off its hinges and gusts of wind were coming from the room. On entrance to our room we were shocked to find that the room was filthy and the bed was stained . The thought of undressing or even unpacking was unbearable, therfore we left the hotel. Cleanliness is obviously not a priority at the Thirty Thirty Hotel

<Title>“Good location”
<Content>Let's be honest,, New York hotels are way over-priced for the quality you get. So, with this in mind, for the European travaller thsi hotel is expensive. For New york it's not a bad deal at all. The rooms are small but clean and the top element is the location on a quiet street beside Park Avenue. We walked nearly everywhere and were very happy here. If you want luxury though, look eleswhere and ...bring your credit cards!!!

<Title>“Zero Atmosphere”
<Content>Disappointing. It looks great on the website - very trendy - but in reality it's cold with zero atmosphere. The lobby has an industrial feel. The rooms are drab and poorly maintained, furniture has been thrown together without much thought. It is, however, clean and the location is good - if you're only staying for a night or two it's fine, but if you're staying any longer you may want to find somewhere with more character.

<Title>“Great little Hotel”
<Content>After reading some of the the other reviews I was a bit nervous about our stay at the 30/30( especially as we had already been to Vegas and Mexico and had fantastic hotels on this trip) I can honestley say I had nothing to be nervous about - I will admitt the rooms are not exactley large but plenty big enough for what we needed a large wardrobe , comfy bed (clean and with a duvet!!) and large bathroom - The room was extreemly clean (as was the rest of the hotel) and very modern -please see photos. Location - Fantastic - walking distance to the empire state, and the Grays tour bus (5min walk tops). On route to these you will find a great little deli/italien/bakery all serve great food (on madisson ) It is alsp walking distance to Time square/ madison sg /Macys etc - a walk we did several times !! (8-10 ) Like I said we walked back late at night several times and felt perfectley safe at all times. any questions please ask

<Title>“Very Trendy Little Hotel”
<Content>Upon arrival at The Thirty Thirty hotel in New York, we were checked in and in our rooms very fast which was good when you are only visiting for a few days to see all the sites. The room was so tiny. It had two twin beds in and there was hardly any room for both of our suitcases. The bathroom was also very small and the wardrobe was barely big enough to fit a couple of coats and tops in. We basically lived out of our suitcases as it was easier that way. There was a TV in the room too which had quite a few channels on if you wanted to watch tv, but no drink making facilities. The room was a little tired, but we were not there to see the room but the city!! The hotel is in a good location, right in the middle of Manhatten. It is only two blocks away from the Empire State Building and the main street to walk to all the shops and sights. I thought that the hotel location was great as we got to see everything in 4 days that we had intended on seeing as it was so central. The staff in the hotel were lovely, which is not so typical of New Yorkers and they changed the bedding and towels daily. There is a little restaurant to the left hand side of the hotel and they do great cocktails! The breakfasts are amazing too and great to set the day off before a day of sight seeing of the city!! The photos on the website do not typically reflect what the hotel looks like exactly. It is quite trendy, but just a litlle tired thats all. Tips - Go up the Empire State Building in the day and up the Rockafella at night. This way you get to see a better view of the Statue of Liberty in the day and then see the Empire State all lit up at night. The lift in the rockafella is made from coompletely glass and the light show on the way up is fantastic! We went in November when the Christmas decorations were up, ice skating in Central Park and at the bottom of the Rockafella is a must. Also a ride round Central Park on a horse and carridge. They are expensive but you have to do it. The Staton Island ferry is FREE. We did not know this and the lady in the information kiosk was very rude when I asked where we needed to go and pay. This is worth doing just to see the Statue of Liberty up close. Ground Zero is very errie but its nice to go and pay your respects to all the people who lost their lives there. The photos and storey all hung up are so sad. The Sex and the City Tour of the city was also very good for all fans out there and we also did a movie and tv tour of the city too. Think they only cost us about Â£20 per person which is nothing for a couple of hours out of your day. The main bar in grand central station on the top right of the main staircase do really good cocktails too and very strong!! hehe The revolving bar at the top of the Marriott in Times Square is great too, on the drinks mat there is a map of all the sights you can see out of the windows. The drinks are pretty expensive in here but worth the view. We got a table reservation at The Rainbow Rooms to in the Rockafella centre. The food was out of this world, although very pricey, but hey you only live once!! Alll in all the short city break was amazing, we got to see everything we wanted and this had part to do with the hotels location. You are also not that far in a taxi either so didn't cost a small fortune like we imagined it would!!

<Title>“Great little Hotel!”
<Content>After booking the Thirty Thirty we read some of the trip advisor reviews, along with many positive ones some of them were negative but we decided to take a chance. How happy we were that we did. This is a great place in a fab location. We booked two rooms at the Thirty Thirty, one superior and one premium. Both rooms were good size and we weren't squashed at all. Clean, stylishly decorated and the bathroom was huge and gorgeous. The staff were friendly and couldn't have been more helpful in lots of ways. in giving directions or advice on places to eat or holding onto luggage etc. They were brill. It was a great start to our holiday and we would definitely stay at the Thirty Thirty again.

<Title>“The Best Hotel in New York!”
<Content>In my opinion this is the hotel to stay at if you go to New York. Reasonable hotel rates, two blocks from the subway so easily accessible, excellent restaurants in the location especially the Crooked Knife opposite the hotel (don't go next door - think it was Zana - poor food & staff). Excellent florist & tourist shop on the other side. Front desk staff were very accommodating & very friendly - they go out of their way to assist you with your travel plans & any queries you may have. The porters are very helpful with your baggage & may be able to answer your queries that you would have asked front desk....one I must commend is Mohammed who I had alot of contact with & I must thank him sincerely for finding my purse & handing it to Security. I appreciate his honesty. The bedrooms may be on the small size but it really doesnt matter when you spend so little time in it...as long as the bed is comfortable & believe me it is! The bathroom is adequate but again who cares as long as the shower is functioning properly & yep - its super! For me what makes a hotel worth going back to is a comfortable bed & a proper shower - thats what you need & this is what you get in this hotel! (& usually a decent breakfast but like most NYC hotels, this one doesn't provide however there are plenty of cafes nearby & a superb breakfast/food buffet at the end of the road - Suzies) I will definitely be coming back to this hotel in the future after experiencing sub-standard hotels uptown that were not good value for money.

<Title>“ThirtyThirty thumbs down!”
<Content>As a stewardess and IBM employee for many years I've stayed at hotels literally all over the world for years. When I booked 6 nights at Hotel ThirtyThirty in New york through British Airways in June 2006, I thought I got a good design hotel for my $ 200 per night. What I got was a nightmare! First I got a room that was bearely big enough for the very small bed there, and a small chair with a teddybear. (Cute?) There was not enough room for my suitcase anywhere, and The door to the tiny bathroom couldn't be opened completely without knocking into the wall. The obvious smell of homecooking from the room next door, the location in the end of a narrow and dark corridor combined with the view of a dump of a backyard made me ask for another room. Without even trying not to show her annoyance at my outrageous request, I was given a room where the closet was about twice the size of the room. The foldable (!) door to the small, old bathroom was impossible to close or open, so I had to go sideways in and out of it. The small bed had a bedspread full of stains. I should have asked for yet another room, but the receptionist was incredibly hostile, and I was exhausted. So - whatever you do, don't ever stay at this hotel. The location is great, but a think even New york hostels must be providing a more pleasurable stay than I had at Hotel ThirtyThirty in New York. You have been "warned" by Anne E. Beck, Oslo, Norway.

<Title>“Great value: clean, quiet, pleasant room”
<Content>This was my second stay at this hotel in the last five years, and it remains one of the few attractive bargains in mid-Manhattan. In addition to the wonderful location, the hotel remains clean and well-kept (though the huge empty lobby could use a few more amenities). This time I stayed in one of the slightly larger and costlier rooms (since I remembered the smaller rooms as a bit claustrophobic). This larger room was good-sized for Manhattan and would be OK for a couple: serviceable desk, chair, small sofa and arm chair, in addition to queen-sized bed, though unfortunately the vanity-sink was in the room rather than in the bathroom. There were outlets and jacks, but probably no wifi- had no laptop so can't comment on this. There was a coffeemaker (important since there's no room service, just a downstairs bar). Since the hotel has thick walls, and the room was at a corridor's end and faced the airshaft (which means no real sunlight), nights were blissfully silent.

<Title>“Horror hotel”
<Content>I stayed in the thirty thirty hotel with a party of five. The images on the internet display this hotel as light, bright, clean and stylish. However, when my partner and I reached the thirty thirty we were shocked. The staff were extremely rude and almost argumentative as they told us that our rooms were not ready, and that it was in no way their fault. Although non smoking rooms were requested, we were told it was their busy period and so we had to except rooms on the smoking level. On entering our room we were greeted by a dark, stuffy, unclean room, with stained sheets and a dried in sick patch on the carpet!!When we slept at night we were woken up by the cleaners telly at 4.00am. As their living/break room was beside our accomadation, at certain times of the day and night our room became overtaken by smoke. Our friends had to be moved rooms as their WINDOW FELL OUT ONTO THE STREET one night!I could go on forever!!Although, the location is ideal and you are extremely central, I would not reccomend this hotel to anybody.

<Title>“Great base for sightseeing”
<Content>This was a great hotel as a base for sightseeing. Staff were friendly, helpful and polite. Room was clean and comfortable and great walk in shower. There are a number of good authentic New York delis and restaurants close by including "Tastys" and the Crooked Knife (opposite the hotel). I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are looking for a no frills base for your sightseeing.

<Title>“A double size bed in the rest of the States is considered a Queen size in NYC!”
<Content>We booked two hotel rooms; a Queen Deluxe for my wife and myself and a double for our children. The "Queen" size bed was NOT a queen but a double. I complained and was assured I was mistaken and it was a queen. I said it was the same size bed as my kid's room, was told that I was incorrect, that I was definitely in a Queen Deluxe. When I layed down later that night, I knew it was a double as my feet hung over the end of the bed so I called the front desk a second time to complain, was given the same spiel by a different front desk person and told to leave a message for the manager to call me in the morning ( he never did for the remainder of the 5 nights). In the morning, I went to the front desk, complaining of the smaller bed, the manager was still not in and was now told, " A double bed in the rest of the States is considered a "Queen" size bed in New York City." Honest, that was what was said and there were two front desk people there. I explained the headboard in the room was of queen size and the mattress much smaller, argued a bit, demanded either a "Queen" size bed which was what we were paying for or a room with twin beds. No Queen could be found or a twin...we were actually sent to check a couple of rooms and they were still doubles. Finally, I asked if a king size bed was in the hotel and if any were available. Reluctantly, they offered us one. On the positive side, we were not charged for the upgrade but what a hassle to get a larger bed. Also, be aware this hotel was at one time a women's residence and rooms on various floors still are(something to do with Rent Control Laws when the building was converted into a hotel the front desk told me). Some of the doors to these tiny rooms are ancient, quite beat up compared to the "hotel" room doors & in our case, the resident next door to our room, which we paid $350 per night, left her door open so when we passed it was an unbelievable cluttered, messy, space filled to the ceiling with her possessions(literally). My daughter and son-in-law, who have been to New York a few times, thought their room was great and would probably stay again. However, and this being our first trip to the Big Apple, we would definitely not.

<Title>“Great Budget Hotel”
<Content>Like most viewers on this site, my boyfriend and I were quite hesitate about this hotel after booking it from the most recent reviews provided on this site. However, to our relief and surprise this is a great hotel for those who just want a clean comfy place to sleep. It is by no means a full scale luxury hotel like the Ritz Carlton or any of the big luxury hotels in Manhattan as it did not have the amenities or 5-star service. What it did have was an ideal location, very clean rooms, friendly knowledgeable staff, reasonable rooms/washroom. We stayed in Room 1038, with a king size bed and a washroom which was made entirely in slate. Very nice touch on the slate! The room itself was a fair size for a New York hotel, it had two TV's, one in the common area where the door was located with a desk, then another in the bedroom itself. The chairs and sofa in the room was a bit iffy but who really sits or sleeps on those for a long time?! The bed itself was very comfortable and the bedding was very clean. The maid replaced the towels everyday and was very tidy. They provide soap/shampoo/lotion however we just choose to use the ones we brought. The washroom also has a hairdryer so don't bother bringing one. What the room did not have was an in-room safe - which wasn't the biggest deal for us at least. The view for the room was probably the only negative thing about the room but it never bothered us cause we were never in the room for long except to sleep. Oh, and about the cockroaches from other reviewers - in our room this was what I was afraid of most and we did not find a single one. It might depend on the room you might staying in...but ours did not have any or any bugs for that matter. I truly would recommend this hotel for those who are looking to stay somewhere that is reasonably priced in Manhattan. It is close to a subway line (the 6 line), and is minutes from the Empire State Building along with other many attractions. The only thing that it lacked was you might need to commute a bit to find nice restaurants but thats a given.

<Title>“Not Disappointed”
<Content>Bedding was good, room was large, shower was great. Interior room; view or other buildings. Room was a cave, but enjoyed my stay. Wireless internet was extra, but wire connection free. Cable and TV basic. General confusion at times with the front desk, but they gave me a free night, not sure if they know they did it. It may have been on purpose; since they locked me out of my room a couple of times, returned a ups delivery. But they did not say at check out, and I did not ask. But would stay here again.

<Title>“Horrible Noise Night and Day”
<Content>There are a number of decent or good hotels within a block or two of Hotel Thirty Thirty. Why did we make such a mistake and stay at this one!?! They have a restaurant on the street level which has loud patrons in their outdoor cafe at night. There is also a restaurant directly across the street and at its outdoor cafe the patrons are even loucer! To make matters worse, this morning, at 6:30 a.m. Hotel Thirty Thirty had a crew power washing the sidewalk in front of the hotel for two hours!!! The noise made it impossible to sleep. Needless to say, we will be staying at another of the area hotels the next time we return to New York City.

<Title>“Reasonable hotel”
<Content>We booked thirty-thirty on their website and got a superior room at a slightly cheaper rate ($800 for 3 nights), which isn't too bad considering the location in midtown Manhattan, near 2 subway lines. The room was large for New York with en-suite shower/bathroom and walk in wardrobe. Staff were friendly enough, room was cleaned daily to a high standard. Some negative points: - No view from room, as the window looked over the back of other buildings. - Air conditioning is very noisy so we switched it off at night. - No signal on TV and some lights didn't work.

<Content>Our four night stay at this hotel was really excellent. Booked through BA Holidays, it was a very affordable rate <Â£90 per room per night. Great location for a few days touring Manhatten. Room was fine, not massive but clean and the bed was very comfortable. If you wnat an affordable, well located place in NYC, go for the Thirty Thirty.

<Title>“Thirty at Thirty Thirty”
<Content>Thirty thirty was an appropriate choice of hotel as it was for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. Stylish hotel, friendly staff and a convenient location - Empire State Building was not too far from us. We found a great breakfast cafe around the corner from us which served up a typical tasty New York breakfast. A couple of policemen came in for their morning round of doughnuts whilst we were there...I thought this was an urban myth! The room size wasn't massive but then the hotel was just a good base for sightseeing generally. Clean, tidy and good value for money.

<Title>“Excellent !”
<Content>After viewing some bad reports on this hotel, my wife and I were sceptical about staying there. All of the adverse criticisms were all without foundation. The staff were all extremely welcoming, polite, and helpful. The room was a little small, but they all are in New York. However, it was very comfortable and clean, with fresh linen every day. Even though we had chosen a smoking room we didn't feel that we had been consigned to the Leper colony. The reception area was very palatial with three lifts, internet access point, good public lavatories and more than helpful bellboys. We also found the restaurant next to the hotel brilliant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Good quality at very reasonable prices. The location couldn't have better for The Empire State Building, Macys and short cab rides to Times Square, Central Park, Greenwich Village etc. It was my wifes sixtieth birthday treat and all went well, mainly because of this hotel. Period of stay - 04.05.08 - 10.05.08

<Content>Reception staff ordinary. Was impressed with the room, quite spacious. Comfy bed/pillows, in-room safe, good sized wardrobe, desk, chair, new linen, paint, carpets. View was to the air con vents and lower level external roof surfaces - not to worry. A/C worked really well. Coackroaches a problem in the heat!!!! Small but clean bathroom with mini soaps, shampoos provided. Small souvenier shop near reception and small restaurant serving meals and snacks opposite mini shop. No problems with restaurant - nice quick service for b/fast. Will hold your suitcases but for a tip. Internet access in reception/lobby. Nice bright and breezy lobby area. Good value for money for Manhatten. Approx 3min walk to nearest subway, little dodgy around Mad Square Gardens trying to get to NY Penn Rail Station so be careful.

<Title>“A Great Hotel”
<Content>After reading a few bad reports about the hotel I was worried about the sort of place we were staying at. I was very pleasantly suprised how good it was. We stayed in an Economy twin Room, No 1204, it was a bit like a compact travel lodge. It was very clean and had very good shower. We also had a great view of The Empire State Building. The rooms were cleaned every day ( don't forget to leave a tip for the cleaner). The staff were friendly and very helpful which helped as it was our first visit to New York. The breakfast in the restuarant in the hotel was very good but a bit pricey, so in the end we ate like native New Yorkers The deli on the corner of the block to the right of the hotel was very good and cheap, you,ve got to try their bacon and egg bagels. Get a 7 day subway pass as it's cheaper than paying for every trip which is $2 per person. If you go to the Statue of Liberty get there before 8.30am as the ticket que starts early and it guarantees a pass to get into the statue. We had a great time and will definately be going back and staying at Thirty Thirty again.

<Title>“Not a bad choice for the price”
<Content>With a short trip to New York planned location of your hotel is everything. I found the Thirty Thirty on a travel website. Price was about average for NY with not wanting to share a bathroom with strangers. Location was close to the subway and torwards the southern part of Manhattan. The room was small and clean. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The staff was more then willing to help with directions to NYC locations. They even let store our bags after we checked out becuase we had a late flight. Overall for the price and location it is a great hotel.

<Title>“Location”
<Content>I stayed here with my boyfriend in Dec 06 for a city break and a bit of xmas shopping. We stayed for 3 nights which was plenty to get everything done that we wanted. The staff in the hotel were as misserable as anything, but we didnt ever have many dealings with them so it didnt really affect us. The rooms were very basic and in desperate need of a refurb, but we hardly spent any time in there so this was not a problem. The loaction could not be faulted, we walked almost everywhere, it was great. there is a bagel shop just on the corner of the street, so ideal for a quick stop off in the morning to eat on your way. The closest attraction is the empire state building which is about a 5 minute walk. From there you can also buy the city sightseeing bus tickets. We paid $48 for a 48 hour pass, and it stops just outside the Empire, fantastic. You literally hop on and off at your preferred stops to take in the sights and continue with the journey, it saves a lot of time walking, especially if your on a tight schedule. Would stay here agian purely for the location.

<Title>“Cheap and cheerful!”
<Content>Stayed at the Thirty Thirty for 3 nights. We booked a Kingsize bed room through the hotel direct as they had an Early Spring special. The room was a reasonable size as was the bathroom. We had a small 'longe area' with sofa, TV and table as you came into the room, then the bed area with a small wardrobe and another TV!However, not all rooms are the same layout - check them first and some bathrooms are much smaller than others even though you're paying the same price. Also, not all rooms have built in safes although there is a safe facility at the front desk. Friends also stayed at the hotel, 2 children and 2 double beds, with 'lounge area'. The first room didn't have a sofa in so difficult to watch TV - not saying that's what you want to do in NYC but sometimes a bit of down time is required especially if you have kids. Anyway the hotel staff were quick to help out and moved them to another room, which they were happy with. This isn't meant to be a negative review I'm just saying if you're not happy with the room say something and I'm sure you'll be assisted anyway they can. The standard rooms are rather small so I would pay a bit extra for a bigger bed and room. There are no views from the room except onto the main street below or into a type a of quandrangle at the back. But no-one was looking into your room either! There are various 'older' ladies staying in the place but I don't think they're homeless. But they add character to the hotel and are in no way offensive. The location is great as others have said, plus quiet (always a bonus). NYC seems so much safer nowadays. Enjoy walking if able and soak up the amazing atmosphere. If/when I return to NYC I would be happy to stay at the Thirty Thirty. Unless I won the lottery! Give it a go!

<Title>“Great place to stay”
<Content>My friend and I have just returned from our stay in NYC. The Thirty Thirty hotel was great! We actually got upgraded as it was my friends birthday and the room was spacious and clean. There was a maid service every day. We did managed to get a quick glance at one of the standard rooms and although it was quite small it looked clean and tidy too. The hotel staff were very friendly and would go out of their way to help you. There was a porter ready to take your bags and the receptionists were helpful and friendly. We also left our baggage at the hotel once we had checked out and everything was fine. The restaurant 'Zara' next to the hotel was very nice and friendly staff there too; however we prefered to try and see a bit more of New York by trying to go to as many different places to eat as possible. Nothing wrong with this bar/restaurant at all though. I've read coments that there were homless people hanging around inside this hotel... we didn't see one homless person wondering around and felt completely safe at all times (especially as we were 2 women on our own in NYC). Also if you're looking for a cheap place to stay that's comfortable and safe then this is the place to go... I have read many bad reviews on this hotel but am now thinking that maybe these people expected too much of this hotel. At the end of the day it is not a luxury hotel so don't expect it to be... but if you want a cheap hotel that's in a great location (close to empire state, Macy's, short walk to Times Square)... then this is the hotel to stay at! Overall very good!

<Title>“Great Hotel Great LOcation”
<Content>Myself and my partner have just returned from a 5 night stay in the Hotel Thirty Thirty, and throughly enjoyed our stay. After checking in we headed straight to our room on the 6th floor. The room was compact, but clean and comfortable with all the facilities we were after, phone, safe, iron and ironing board, hairdryer etc etc. The bathroom again was small, and the sink was located in the bedroom, but this was not a problem at all. The shower was large, and there was always plenty of hot water. The location of the hotel is excellent, just minutes from the Empire State Builing, and Macys! The nearest subway is on 33rd st, just a few minutes away. This is on the 6 Line, and goes up and downtown, and you can use it to link with the other lines. We did a lot of walking when we were there as everything is so close. Taxi cabs are also very reasonable, so if you're heading out in the evening you should grab one, cause if like us your feet will need a rest at that stage! We loved our stay in this hotel, would definitely go back, and would definitely recommend it to our frineds.

<Title>“Nice Accomodations”
<Content>After reviewing many hotels my boyfriend and I decided to give Thirty Thirty a try for our overnight stay in NY. The price was more fitting for our budget and the location was pretty good for our purposes. The cab ride to the theater was under $10 and there are plenty of places within walking distance to eat and shop. As was mentioned in previous reviews there is a very nice restaurant/lounge inside of the hotel. The staff at both the restaurant and the hotel was very helpful, professional, and friendly. The room was very small, but that wasn't a problem since our trip was only overnight. We had a standard queen room that had a closet with two small drawers and a televison and two nightstands. The room was clean with exception for the carpet that was heavily stained in some areas, but still looked to be freshly vacuumed. The bathroom was very nice and clean. The hotel was quiet and we had a very comfortable evening. If our budget is tight we would definitely stay at the Thirty Thirty again.

<Content>Nice place nice staff and location, Eat across the street, Irish pub two minutes walk, Tube two blocks away Â£3-50 for day ticket, Go anywhere, good underground system, Local bus travel very ropy. If you have a late flight you can leave your cases there all day for a few bucks,there locked away. Don't get conned by the porter, into him booking you a private cab to the airport you'll pay a lot extra, Get a yellow cab, Shuttle Bus or Tube you'll feel better, we'd certainly go back.

<Title>“We had a great stay at the thirty thirty”
<Content>We have just returned from a five day stay at this hotel. We had read the previous reviews so we where very sceptical on arrival........ What a lovely pleasant surprise our room was, yes it was small but beautifully formed!! Fresh linen every day, bed was sooo comfy. Great shower. staff where really helpful & friendly. We also had a small problem with the toilet but it was sorted within minutes of us speaking to reception. We did see a few of the long stay residents but i thought they where quirky & certainly not a problem. We found a really good deli on the corner of 31st & Madison called the times square bagel. Excellent value & lovely chocolate & cheese muffins. The fruit bowls where really good too. All in all, as stated in previous reviews great location. When we come back to new york we will definitely stay at the thirty thirty. Dallas BBQ by the dakota buildings has great food, huge portions, good value & very nice margheritas!!! So dont be put off give the hotel thirty thirty a try ;-)

<Title>“great welcome at thirty thirty”
<Content>Just returned from four day break in New York with my daughter and friends stayed at the Thirty Thirty Hotel. The hotel is idealy located for sight seeing. A few blocks from Empire State Building and within easy walking distance of Times Square and shops especially Macey,s The hotel itself was clean, beds very comfortable. rooms more than adequate for our needs. The staff were helpfull and friendly at all times nothing was to much trouble for them. they even loaned us umbrellas when it was raining we had a fabulous time thank you A realy good welcome was given to everyone they even arranged our transport back to the airport. and let us keep our room on at a very reasonable charge as we had a late flight back I would recommend this hotel to anyone. People who wrote bad reviews about this hotel must be hard to please.I,m glad we gave it a try

<Title>“great location good hotel”
<Content>If you're looking for central accommodation in midtown, a few blocks from the Empire State building, you shouldn't expect the Hilton for under $200 a night. Thirty Thirty hotel is well situated, 2 blocks from the subway, in a nice area with immediate access to many of the big sights in NYC. Macy's is just a few blocks around the corner, the Rockerfeller Centre, Central Park, Times Square all just a few stops on the subway. We stayed for 2 nights in Feb 2008, the hotel room was clean with nice ensuite. The room wasn't huge but who cares when you are there to visit the city and only want a room to sleep / relax for half an hour in. Everything worked fine, except a small incident with the toilet which was fixed quickly by the helpful staff. We did loads of exploring from this place which was an excellent base for getting around the city. In summary, this is a good deal, nice location. If you want luxury then you should look elsewhere and spend more per night. For cleanliness comfort and location this hotel was good.

<Title>“Thirty thirty - better than expected”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews on this site before I left, I was travelling with some trepidation, not sure what I should expect. However I found Thirty Thirty to be a well situated hotel, with friendly and helpful reception staff. The room was smallish (but what do you expect for that rate in the heart of NY?) but clean and had plenty of storage, TV, phone, hairdryer. Bathroom was an average size but OK for just the 2 of us. We only used the adjoining restaurant once for breakfast, as there were so many other places to try, but it was fine and typically priced. Overall if you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel with easy access to all the major sights I would recommend it.

<Title>“dont listen to the bad reviews!”
<Content>Me, my partner and another couple stayed at this hotel for 4nights over the valentines day period. Having been to NYC before i knew the hotels there werent amazing unless you paid alot for them so i didnt go with too high hopes! After reading the reviews i was a bit concerned but how wrong they were! Our room was on the top floor and was an average size, with a spacious bathroom, hairdryer and tv, but the selling point about this hotel was the view!! Looking out of our window we stared straight at the empire state building-priceless! The room was clean and bedding and linen were changed everyday. The staff were friendly and helpful and we enjoyed drinks at the bar. The hotel was no Plaza but hey it was an excellent location and i would definatley stay there again!!!

<Title>“Disreguard the bad reviews, we loved it, now for the truth!”
<Content>I pride myself on reading these reviews before i settle for a hotel, but against my better judgement we booked into the 30/30 because it was a good deal with Virgin, 6 nts for the price of 4. I read all the reviews on trip advisor, and thought oh my god, ranked really low what have i let myself in for. I am going to be very truthful about his hotel, so you 'really' know what to expect, i hope it will help you in making your own informed choice. So here goes.......... On arrival we were met by the doorman who straight away took our suitcases and placed them on a trolley, i went to reception, hubby went to the information desk where all the trips were displayed nicely. On first impressions, i thought it was begining to need re-decorating, and the furniture was a bit tatty, but not to extreme. Everywhere in reception was clean and tidy. We checked into room 902 on the 9th floor, the corridors and carpets were clean, and everywhere seemed very quiet. On entering the room it was freezing, but the windows were shut! I thought my god no heating yikes, but the doorman brought our cases up, gave him a couple of dollers, and bless him, he put the heating on full blast. It temperature control on the wall, so you can turn it up or down as you wish, it got to hot some nights. So heres the description of the room. We had one window looking out onto offices, and over looking the Empire state building. We had a huge double bed/or queen, plus two chest of drawers and table lamps. We had an old Tv which was useless, many channels, but typical USA rubbish on it and useless adverts, the trouble was the ariel, it just didnt work. We had a double wardrobe next to the bed in which it slided across, also another closet with an ironing board and hanging space, plenty of room for storage and shopping, i went with one case and came back with three!!!! The window was a good size has white roller blinds, it can be open, but not very far as you are so high up. It had also a smoke detctor. Nice white ceilings, light beige wallpaper, wine coloured carpet which was dry and clean. In the bathroom it was tiled, it had a sink and a toilet which worked, and a excellent shower and screen, no bath, all tiled to a good standard. The bed had a clean mattress as we checked and clean pillows, maid service was EVERY DAY, so clean bedding and fresh flannels and towels. We actually had a bulb that went in the little hallway, we never mentioned it, but noticed that it was renewed the next day, so very good service. The staff were not Amercian, but they were attentive, and gave us directions when required. They always remembered us, and greeted us at the door and very helpful. It got abit confusing with the west and east getting around, but if you use the Empire state building as a guide, you will be fine. Macy's is brilliant for shopping, pick your 11% discount card up from reception, dnky jeans for Â£20! Central park is about half an hours walk, worth going on a horse drawn carriage, we found the ROCK (rockerfellas centre) better then the empire state, cheaper and you can go to the top and get 360% views and no perspex, so i can recommend that. To see Mamia mia on broadway is a must, and the Liberty helicopter ride is a fantastic experience you will not forget. The only downside to the trip is the New yorkers themselves, i found them very rude, no pleases and thank yous except the older generation. Food shops especially the delis are very good. We ate at Tads near the corner of Macys and 'Andrews', they had good food and very good prices. We experienced minus 7 degrees in the day, had freezing cold weather, sun, wind and best of all the snow. My experience of the thirty thirty hotel and the shopping was absolutely fabulous. May i add that normally i am a 4-5 star person, not a snob, but do like the comforts of a up market hotel, but please believe me when i say we had a truely wonderful stay at this hotel and would return. It was clean and tidy, no frills, basic yes, but had what you needed. You will need to bring your onw kettle if you want a drink, although saying this there is a deli across the small road open 24 hours, so we often picked up a coffee on route. Straightners will work in the rooms but bring an adapter, they do have hair dryers. I also would like to mention about the homeless people that live there, they are not exactly homeless but pay a small amount, they are not rude, dirty, but are very chatty and walk around with slippers on. We spoke to them, and they were very curtious. They do have dogs in the building, but that said, they do in other hotels and in the shops! So it is the norm. I hope you have a great time, and i hope i have mentioned some helpful advice to help you make your decision. Michelle x

<Title>“Excellent Choice”
<Content>Me and my wife spent 4 nights at the Thirty Thirty New York at end of January 08. We read these reviews a few days before we departed and our hearts sank as they were so bad. We even tried to change our hotel, but it was too late. Anyway, in the end we had nothing to worry about. The hotel was clean and smelt fresh. The location and area was great (literally minutes from the Empire State Buiding and about 10 mins from Macys & 15 mins from Times Square/main shopping along 5th Avenue.) The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed in room 443 which was an OK size but it was more than big enough for us and our luggage. As stated by others the shower and bed linen was exceptionally good. Our view wasn't great, but that didn't bother us. The only downsides were a slight draft through the windows and like others the toilet blocked the 1st time we used it - but then again a maintenance man unblocked it within 5 minutes of asking. All and all, this hotel was great and I would stay there again, no question. I hope my review helps put some of your minds at rest after reading some of the not so favourable reviews.

<Title>“Fantastic”
<Content>We read the reviews just before we went and our hearts sank but on arrival we were pleasantly surprised. Not only were the staff helpful and polite but the decor was fresh and airy. Our room (941) was clean, beautifully decorated and well-equipped - iron, ironing board, hairdryer, coffeemaker and masses of storage space, as well a safe. The bathroom was big enough with a powerful and, more importantly, hot shower. Towels and linen were changed everyday and the temperature in the room was easily controlled by a themostat system that you control. For what we paid (Â£400 for 4 nights inc BA flights) we were thrilled. Location and facilities were excellent, the tea place, Subtle Tea, across the street on the corner of Madison and 30th is amazing as is the deli just along 30th street- Cafe Au Bon Gout- is great for quick breakfasts and great service. Zana, the hotel's restaurant, wasn't great but then we'd previously eaten at Cafe Carlyle so the standard set was high. Would we go back? Most definitely-a real find.

<Title>“could be a disaster !”
<Content>My wife had booked the hotel before I had time to check out the advisor so it was with some trepidation that we arrived for a 4 night stay. The upside is location, the helpful reception and concierge and possibly price. Iam told that the hotel is owned by a group of Albanians.The next door bar/restaurant [Zana] is OK but is not good value and the bar service is hopeless. Usual story :waitrons live on tips but it gets tiresome chasing your change all the time.There is a good Irish bar 100yards toward east [Desmonds] and the restaurant over the road [Crooked knife] is better but not really up to NYC standards.The room was small and dirty. Linen service at 5pm. The sheets had not been changed prior to our arrival . It is true that the top floor is residential for retired ladies and it can get a bit odd when they hang round the bar early evening. I can imagine it being easy to get this whole place wrong in one trip and having a nightmare. No Americans work here and it shows.

<Title>“Would never stay there again”
<Content>We stayed in this hotel in October 2007. Our first visit to New York and a belated honeymoon. We absolutely loved New York and will return as soon as we can but just not to this hotel. The main reception area is lovely and can be a bit misleading when it comes to prejudging the rest of the hotel. The reception staff were not at all friendly. We arrived late after a long wait in the airport and there was not so much as a greeting. The hotel room was awful. The picture we saw on the internet had obviously been taken with a very wide angled lens as there was barely enough room to walk along the bottom of the bed between the wall. We kind of thought Ok we are here to see asmuch of New York as possible and not spend time in the hotel room but even so. The room had no view except the brick wall of the next door building. therefore it was dark, very dark. We had to have the light on and the blind drawn during the day as there were workmen working outside. The bathroom had seen better days and the tiles were filthy. We had no towels left for us on two of our days there except a hand towel which we shared after our shower! There was an awful smell in the corridor and in our room. A damp mouldy smell. Our sheets had holes in and the blankets did not smell fresh. So to sum up we would not reccoment it but don't be put off New York was brilliant. Everyone else we came across was friendly especially the taxi drivers. The people we met were so proud of where they lived and quite rightly so. It was spotless and we felt so safe. Hope this has been helpful

<Title>“If you get offered Room 1029, say no! It's hot and it stinks!!”
<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Thirty Thirty for six nights in January. Upon arrival, we gave our reservation number to the guy on reception (I believe the manager) who after looking at his computer appeared a bit flustered. He sent a colleague up to room 1029, who confirmed it was â€˜cleanâ€™ when he returned to the lobby. When we got to the room, our first impressions were good. We had booked a standard room but the bed appeared to be kingsize and the room and bathroom were both of a very reasonable size, although the bathroom in particular needed a good clean and/or redecoration. However, there was a strong smell of air freshener and the room was very hot (reaching over 80F during our stay compared to the 20/30F cold outside). During the week we asked three times for the heating to be reduced (the hotel information states each room has guest controlled air conditioning but there was no control at all in our room). After the third attempt we were given a fan, which was noisy and pretty ineffective. So we left the windows open but as our windows faced another tall building there was no breeze coming in at all. The room was also inadequately lit making it feel even dingier. On our first full day we returned to our room late afternoon to be confronted with THE MOST DISGUSTING SMELL â€“ cheesey/ vomity, I really canâ€™t describe it. We had no idea where it was coming from but it filled the whole room. We opened the windows and brewed some coffee and the smell gradually faded. Then a couple of days later, again late afternoon/early evening I was having a shower when the smell started to fill the bathroom. Luckily I had nearly finished as it made me heave and I could stay in there no longer. The smell was worse in the corner by the toilet, we think it was coming in through a vent in the ceiling. The room next to us was occupied by a woman, who every time we came into or left our room, was sat at a computer with the TV on and her door propped open. There was a bag of clothes/towels outside the door and the bed was covered in more clothes. We assume she was living there, as other reviews on here have mentioned. Our theory about the smell is that she was possibly cooking something in there at the same time every day and that the smell was coming through from her room into our bathroom next door. The smell was apparent in the room at some point each day either when we returned to the hotel or before we went out again for dinner. One evening, it was later than usual and when we went out to eat I had totally lost my appetite as all I could think about was the smell and it made me feel ill. Looking back at our arrival, we now think the staff member was sent up to check for the smell rather than whether it was clean and it explains the overuse of the air freshener. We think we were probably given the room because of some error in their booking system. On the plus side the hotel was well located for the Empire State Building and Maceyâ€™s and close to the 28th and 33rd Street subway stations. The porter Mohamed was very helpful and friendly and the rest of the staff, although not overly chatty, were polite enough. The bed was made every day and towels replaced. Also we used the hotel car service back to the airport which at $70 including tolls was cheaper than the taxi we had got into the city. Unfortunately the Thirty Thirty Hotel slightly spoilt our trip to New York. By the end of the week I was dreading going back there because of the smell. If weâ€™d had another room we could have had a totally different experience but we can only go by what happened to us and we would certainly not recommend the Thirty Thirty Hotel to anyone.

<Title>“Above average hotel”
<Content>Having read some of the negative reviews for this hotel, we were pleasantly surprised. We had a double room and, although not the biggest room we've stayed in, it had a comfy bed, large TV, clean bathroom (maid service each morning with clean towels/mini shower gels/soaps). We also had a filter coffee machine in the room (would have preferred a cup of tea but hey, we're not going to mark the hotel down for that!). Door staff really pleasant, our cases were brought to the room. Expect to tip for everything though! The real positive is the location of the hotel. It is in a great area of NY and within walking distance to most of the major attractions. Zena's bar next door is OK; quite pricey for breakfast, would recommend trying to find the real american breakfast of eggs benedict/bagels etc (there are plenty of cafes to choose from around the area). We would definately stay at this hotel again and recommend it as an ideal central location for a sightseeing break.

The Empire State Building is only 2 minutes away. The staff were very friendly & especially the door staff as they give us excellent tips on shopping and places to eat. The room was perfect. We stayed on the 6th floor. The room was plenty big with a big comfy double bed with lots of pillows and a duvet. The shower was a decent size too. The room was very clean. I would stay at this hotel again if i return to new york for shopping.

<Content>I stayed at this hotel during the weekend of the New York marathon when rooms were hard to come by and were still very expensive. I paid $375 a night plus taxes on top as it was the cheapest I could find for 4 star. I regularly stay at 4 and 5 star hotels and there is no way I would rate this as 4 star. It was absolutely awful and the staff were rude and unhelpful. I really wish I'd checked out this website before going. I wouold never stay here again!!!

<Title>“The more you ask, the better the Thirty Thirty gets”
<Content>Planning to stay at the Thirty Thirty for twelve days I was hoping their Petite Single room was going to provide me with some basic comfort. Upon check-in I was given room 315. It was a very small room which I was expecting. What I was not expecting was the size and condition of the bathroom. I contacted the reservation desk and informed them I needed a larger room with a decent bathroom. After viewing two additional rooms I was given a larger room with a spanking new bathroom. Four days before my departure date I was moved to room 838 which was a true gem of a room. If you are staying at the Thirty Thirty give room 838 a try. The Thirty Thirty meets all the basic requirements of a hotel in New York. The Thirty Thirty is well located between Park Avenue South and 5th, just minutes from Union Square and Grand Central Station. The concierge and reservations staff are moody but helpful (if pushed). On the other hand the support staff including cleaners and maintenance are incredibly helpful and very willing to help.

<Title>“Improved! Surprise, surprise.”
<Content>I have stayed at the Thirty Thirty one time previously and it was horrible. Tight room, dirty and pricey. But due to it being 1 block from my corporate office I decided to give it another try and I am glad I did. Room this time was a Queen, which included a comfortable queen bed, nice desk and a 35 inch television. The room was clean, possibly recently renovated but I am unsure. Bathroom was all marble / slate, very clean and had a powerful shower, much different than the double twin room I stayed in one year previously. It is a bit pricey, $300+ but location is great for me and it was clean and comfortbable.

<Title>“Hotel Dirty Dirty!!!!!!”
<Content>I stayed at Hotel Dirty Dirty for a business trip, my first room smelt of smelly old man. i gave them the benefit of the doubt and opened the window for the entire day, when I returned to the room it was even worse! I went to the front desk and asked to have my room switched. They did accomodate me and found me a new room which is when the trouble started. To begin with the bathroom is so DIRTY! The floors were sticky and dirty and I wouldn't step on the floor or carpet without my shoes on, I even showered with my sneakers on it was that bad. The person in the room next to me listened to his TV at the loudest possible setting and when I called the front desk they told me they would send someone up. Hours later and unable to take it any longer I called the front desk AGAIN! The women came up with security and entered the room in which NO GUEST WERE ASSIGNED and shut the TV off, I was at my door when the women told the security guard that I was a complaining nasty [--]. I opened the door to defend my honor as I am always courtious and polite even when there is a complaint and then I realised they weren't worth the effort. This hotel is run by LOW LIFE, UNEDUCATED people who don't give a damn. I returned to work the next day and had all 39 employees switched to a new hotel.... BE AWARE THE WEBSITE LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE ROOMS, I FELT LIKE I WAS IN A HALF WAY HOUSE FOR CRACK ADDICTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>“Try Elsewhere”
<Content>We've just returned from staying at the 3030. The reception area is functional with no bar and very minimal seating area. Do not think for one moment the reception staff are there to assist you in any shape or form. They won't. We booked a superior room (room 1044) and the room was large. However, on the downside for such a large room the bathroom only contained a shower and a loo. The sink was relocated into the bedroom, it would have been better to decrease the bedroom size and increase the bathroom. For two days towels never arrived in the hotel room. It took three attempts at reception to get towels and hangers delivered to the room. No newspaper ever made it to our bedroom door. A very small closet so don't take too much luggage! As for the potential for homeless residents. Believe me they have people living there. On the tenth floor there were three rooms with fulltime occupants. The room next to ours housed two woman, and the smell of cats and pot filled the hallways whenever we returned back to our room. Then there was the room opposite the lift which the occupant constantly left her dirty laundry outside in a cart, this included revolting underwear and a blood stained bath mats. These were left outside in the hallway our entire stay. We also spotted other ghost like appearances of other woman shuffling around the 10th floor. This doesn't add to the ambience of the hotel and it SHOULD be stated clearly there are fulltime homeless occupants living in the hotel. Chambermaid service is minimal, though the room was clean on check-in the shower and sink were never cleaned during our stay. Water glasses were never taken away and fresh ones replaced. The coffee machine was never emptied and left to stand for days if we weren't using it. We ended up taking our own rubbish out to the street and used a public bin to get rid of our rubbish and this was never cleared away. Just the bed was made. On the upside, the room was quiet and the location is good for sight seeing. However for $2,200 I wouldn't bother going back and would recommend you carry on in your search for a hotel. THIS HOTEL IS NOT TO BE RECOMMENDED.

<Title>“Don't stay here”
<Content>Karen from Atlanta: This was the most over-priced hotel-- about $900 for two nights-- I've ever stayed in. It was awful. There was not one surface in the bathroom to put one item. There was a pedestal sink with sloping sides, and even the toilet top was sloping so you couldn't use that to put your toiletries. I had to put everything on the floor. The room was freezing. They finally brought the temperature above 63 degrees using a space heater. An old copy of the New York Post littered the floor outside our door and the previous occupants bottled water sat on the window sill until I put it out in the hall.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>i stayed here for 3 nights while on a shopping trip with 2 friends. the hotel is in an absolutely fab location. i found the staff very friendly and courteous. the room we stayed in contained 2 queen size beds and there was also a couch in it aswell as 2 teles. it was a big room with plenty of room for our suitcases and all our shopping. the hotel overall was very clean and i would recommend it to anyone. it is only a couple of minutes walk from the Empire State building and the location of this hotel is one of its biggest selling points. When i return to New York i will stay here again. one thing i found with the rooms is that the walls are a little thin, so if you are light sleeper beware or just wear ear muffs. it didnt bother me though.

<Title>“Would not reccommend but good location”
<Content>We actually won our stay here which was good because I would not pay the prices they charge at this hotel. We had an executive room at with 2 queen beds but only on the 2nd floor. The first room we were given looked a bit grotty and the view was of a brick wall next door! We were given the choice of 2 other rooms so we moved straight away and at least had a view of the street. The executive rooms are large but nothing special. There wasn't enough closet/wardrobe space for even 1 person, no bath, only a shower and no spectacular views. On the good side, the hotel is in a good midtown location and the staff were lovely. The beds and towels were changed daily and the engineer on hand for internet cable access and when our toilet flooded it was cleaned up straight away. Unfortunately as a travel agent I would not reccommend this hotel, I dread to think what the standard rooms are like.

<Title>“terrible would never stay here again!!”
<Content>My second time in nyc. Firstly checked in to the hotel and was given single beds the other 2 people we were on holiday with were asked if they wanted single or double beds we were not even asked and we were put on completely different floors. The room when we arrived was very small bathroom was bigger!! the windows simed to let in more cold air then it keep out. the veiw from it was very poor was of a run down building with a nosie lift that went on all through the night. We went to see the staff at reception about changing up travellers cheques and they said they could only change up $100 for the whole hotel a day wich is 253 rooms i dont think so!! we went back later on when the staff had changed shifts and manged to change up a futher $100 the staff were so rude didnt want to do anything to help. at the end of are stay here when we were checking out are bags and we got apporch by a man who wanted to book are taxi for us back to jfk we were a bit weary of this because he wanted to take a $10 depoist off are $60 fair, when we came back to get are taxi the bloke was very pushy saying are taxi was waiting for us we were 15mins early so we could sort are suitcases before we left for jfk when we got outside we refused to get in the taxi as it was not a proper taxi we asked for are depoist back as we wanted a yellow cab he said if we want a yellow cab we got to get one urself he was so rude he put the icing on the cake of are bad experiance of this hotel never again would we stay here. The location of this hotel was pretty good only 2 blokes from macys and 1 from the empire state building but you do need to get a taxi to times square as it is about a 25 mins walk. next time i would retirn to the hotel i stayed in first time i visted nyc!!

<Content>Ridiculous the cost for the experience. Bathroom was not clean was I arrived - past guest's soap ring still on sink, there was a stain on the sheet. The next day when I came back at 3pm, the housekeeper was in my room chatting on the cell phone, floor was not vacuumed and the same sheets on the bed (stain still there) I reserved a double and it was a twin bed room with a kitchen! No hook or shelf in the bathroom. Sent a note to the Manager directly, never received a response. Spend the extra $100 per night and stay at a real boutique hotel.

<Title>“Not great but not terrible”
<Content>Just got back from NYC and a 3 night stay at the 30/30 hotel - to be honest, I was a bit worried about it having read the reviews.....so here's the good stuff; The location is fine - right near the Empire State and within walking distance to the shops. There's a fab little deli called Miss K's where you can buy just about everything a minute away from the hotel We found the staff very nice and helpful - they booked us a cab back to the airport and helped with all the queries we had The bathroom was very roomy and the shower was fab. OK now here's the bad stuff; The room was tiny - we couldn't walk around the bottom of the bed as it was right up against the wall. There was no aircon and the windows were nailed shut so it we very stuffy I was really surprised at how much this hotel has been slated - it's a cheap, budget hotel in NYC so I don't really know what people expect! Get out of your room and explore the city!! We'd stay here again....

<Title>“Basic, Clean, Great Location”
<Content>Was worried when I read other reviews about this hotel but was pleasantly surprised on arrival. The hotel has a large foyer and 3 lifts which were all in operation. Reception staff were friendly to us and gave us good directions to places. The rooms are really small but having stayed in New York before its normal. Everything in the room was clean and the bathroom was lovely. The maid visited everyday and cleaned the room well and had fresh towels every day. The location was great could walk to lovely restaurants bars (Crooked Knife) across the road gorgeous food and great cosy atmosphere. The empire state building is just around the corner and the subway is within easy reach. I would definately stay here again, only grip is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room.

<Title>“Pretty Good Value”
<Content>We stayed for eight nights on a group booking numbering 30+ people. Single and double rooms. Nice big foyer, Three good sized lifts. Our room was adequate (for UK readers think Travel Inn), no chairs, desk or coffee/tea making equipment. Interesting that no-one mentions the excellent quality bed linen or the quality flannels and towels that are changed daily or the duck down and feather pillows. By the way, do remember to leave a dollar or two on the pillow each day for the maid? Don't forget its how the staff make up their wages. I know it seems alien to us Brits, but when in Romeâ€¦ One of our group did encounter the famed Thirty Thirty mouse, but after a call to reception, she was moved immediately. Of the rest of the group, nobody else had any noticeable problems that I'm aware of, that were not overcome by a chat to the very helpful reception staff. Breakfast in the cafe/bar adjoining the entrance to the hotel was very pleasant. But we got charged different service charge each of the three times we used it. Just down the road in one direction is Miss K's 24hr deli, and at the other end is Susies deli, where you can buy an amazing range of food and eat on the premises if you wish. Basic but good. For an evening meal there is a very nice pizza restaurant opposite Susies, which is very affordable. But for a real treat, go to the Oyster Bar Restaurant in Grand Central Station. My one lasting impression is something the hotel can do nothing about. The incessant noise of this part of New York. Would I stay there again? Probably not. But on balance, I think you get what you pay for.

<Title>“Loved NYC - hated this hotel!!!”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel for a week as were in new york for a wedding, and from the moment we stepped in the place it was awful. Rude reception staff and the most small room i have ever seen, we were struggling to move round in it. It looked and felt dirty and not even a proper window, half of it was a piece of cardboard as they had not replaced a broken window pane. we complained and the hotel solution was duct tape. we were freezing most of the week from this but hotel was too full to give us a new room. The pane of glass was eventually replaced ater 6 nights!! no good to us as we were leaving anyway. The hotel looked nothing like what it did on the website and was very expensive for what it was. my advice......pay slightly more stay elsewhere.

<Title>“below average -far better places and value elsewhere in NYC”
<Content>I stayed here with 2 others for 4 nights in October. Ill try to be as honest and fair as I can from a British point of view... Location - I guess it depends what you are looking for. We were there for shopping, the location is ok for Macys, 6th Ave etc. But too far for heading to Times Square of an evening. We walked it and it was a good 25-30 min walk each way. Also the area where it was located didnot feel the safest when walking back late at night, very dark with a lot of strange people loitering around. As we were 3 young women we wouldnt stay there again as safety is one thing I will not compromise on. There was very little in the way of restaurants, nightlife etc close by. Hotel itself - the rooms really are tiny. True that you dont go to NYC to sit in your room and to be fair we only really slept there but still, a little more room would have been nice, we kept crashing into each other and into things. There was nowhere for us to unpack or put our clothes or shopping. No mirrors anywhere(!!!) apart from a tiny one in the bathroom. No cups or glasses if you wanted a glass of water and not enough towels, we repeatedly had to call front desk for more. When we complained, we were told that we needed to make a list each morning of what we wanted and hand that to the maid?! Which annoyed me as these are basics things you expect in a hotel. Only one plug socket which made charging things/using hair appliances hard. The room was never cleaned properly and on our last day we started to notice a lot of flies. My final and main warning would be for people to beware of the concierge guy there. He will try to trick you and fleece you as much as he can - for example he told us that to book a taxi back to JFK airport would cost $100! Luckily I have been to NY many times and know that is costs around $50 at the most, but I have no doubt that others will have fallen for this. We got the impression he was scamming to pocket some of the money on taxis/attractions himself. If you want to book anything talk to the guys at reception, they booked us a cab for $50 in the end and when he found out the concierge got pretty intimidating over it all. I think in all reality this is a 2* hotel. Not dire but certainly not what the brochure leads you to believe. Think average, basic and cramped and you ll be on the right track. I would recommend the Hilton Garden Inn off Times Square which i could not fault when I stayed there and it is not too much more expensive!

<Title>“Can't complain!!”
<Content>Me my gf and I stayed at the 30-30 for a weeks holiday in sept. Yeah, the room was small but you sleep there so don't see it for 8 hours as you're eyes are closed!! Fairly clean, maid service daily, sure they forgot the towels one day, but a call to reception and they were bought up to us. Not overly expensive, but not cheap either. The best part is the location, three blocks from the Empire State Building!! So, overall absolutely no complaints.

<Title>“We lucked out in the end, but don't book from the website!!”
<Content>We booked on a summer promotion...the pictures on the website showed a beautiful room with a large window, etc. WELL, the 3 of us get there and they tell us that the confirmation # the website gave us was invalid and that the only room they had was a SINGLE. We're taken up to a dingy hallway with stained carpets...the room is the smallest hotel room I had ever seen!! The toilet was clogged and when the maintenance guy came up he found A KNIFE was what was clogging it! Nice first impression of NYC!! lol. The shower was terrible and splashed all over the room (there was a curtain, but nothing more separating it from the rest of the bathroom). One of us slept on the bed and the other 2 slept on the floor (one beside the bed and one in the hallway - that's how small this room was.) Anyway, the next day we're moved into a slightly better room with 2 beds (think HoJo quality) but are then informed that the fire code wouldn't let us put a cot in there (which we had requested and paid for!). Another friend at the hotel complained for us and we were upgraded to a GORGEOUS room with a queen bed, glass table and marble bathroom. I wanted to take the bathroom home with me - that's how nice it was!!!! Bottom line, this is a great hotel if you have the $$ to spend, but if you're on a budget, you'll get stuck with something not worth your money. The customer service was like a yo-yo, but the location was great.

<Title>“Save Your Money”
<Content>We stayed at the Thirty Thirty for 3 nights at the end of our holiday. Firstly we were moaned at for being dropped of at the wrong door! The rooms were not fit to be called hotel rooms by todays standard. Having stayed in New York several times before. One of our 2 rooms didn't even have the wash basin in the bathroom it was so small! We were on a 4 centre holiday and the accomadation was booked as a package, we didn't have any problems or concerns with any of the 3 other hotels that we stayed at. I would seriously advice you to save your money and give the Hotel Thirty Thirty a miss.

<Title>“No customer service here”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for business related travel and was told the rate was exceptionally cheap for NYC, which I found hard to believe (it was still almost $300 per night). I found the rooms to be small, cramped, stuffy and overpriced. The beds are comfortable but very small. The fixtures were old and outdated in the bathroom, and any type of standard electronics I had to charge (cell phone, ipod, laptop) kept falling out of the [only] plug in the wall! As for the staff, I called ahead to confirm my reservation and was put on hold several times, to then be given attitude by the reception staff who could not find my reservation due to their misspelling of my name. Upon check-in was a similar experience- the staff seems dour and totally uninterested in helping out guests or going out of their way in any sense. I also had to book a cab for the airport the next morning, and that in itself seemed complicated (and overpriced) - I probably would have been better hailing one on the street. After returning home, they had the wrong name on my hotel bill and I called to ask if they could send me a new one, to which again I was given a lot of attitude; my sense of the staff overall was rude and uninterested in any type of customer service. I will say the hotel is centrally located and within walking distance to subway stop, Grand Central, and other points of interest, but that is about it.

<Title>“Okay but great location.”
<Content>This was just an okay hotel.To be honest ,we were going to this hotel with trepidation after reading some of the reviews. So here is the honest truth. You wont get help with your luggage and contrary to another review ,the lifts were fine.Spacious enough for 2 people and 3 large suitcases with room left over.Our standard room was small and old fashioned but spotless. Plenty of hot water and clean towels. Not a lot of wardrobe space and hangers .We had it cleaned and received clean towels everyday for the week we were there, But if you are in New York,surely this room would only be for sleeping? Only problem was the AC went like a train so couldnt be used in the night.The location was excellent ,3 blocks form Macys and another 6/7 for times square.Most of the reception staff were nice,one or too rude ones but didnt have much to do with them. Dont expect too much and you wont be surprised.One tip:Use your conceirge. We had 2 that told us a lot about trips and restaurants that we would'nt have known about before we came.Cafe and restaurant ,Zana ,beside it and great bar "The Crooked Knife" right across the road which serves lovely food and nice pleasant staff.So overall the room was basic but small and the location was excellent. Find the nice staff and stick to them.They booked reservations for us no problem. If you have a early check out time but late flight then they will let you keep the room for 50 dollars plus tax which is great.

<Title>“One moody member of staff but a GREAT stay!”
<Content>Upon arriving at the hotel we were told by a very unhelpful member of staff that our double was not available and that we were to have a twin instead. No problem apart from the attitude! Thirty minutes later and we enquired (with a different member of staff) as to when we could change rooms the next day? The very helpful staff member checked the system and said we could change now and did we want any help with our bags! From that moment on our stay at the hotel was superb! All the staff (apart from the one) were very friendly and helpful towards us throughout our 5 day stay. The rooms were clean and comfortable (if a little small). A great hotel, great location and we will be staying there again if I can ever afford to go to NYC again!

<Content>After reading some dreadful reviews for this hotel, I was pleasantly surprised by our great room. It was a standard twin room and although a bit small had very, very comfortable beds, huge TV, lovely bathroom with clean towels & products everyday. We also had a filter coffee machine. The hotel is in a great location and has a really good bar/restaurant. Also there is a fab pub right across the road that does really good food. We found the reception staff very friendly and helpful and a porter helped us with our cases. I would definately stay at this hotel again.

<Content>The hotel will do for a cheap weekend stay on a budget, we did not have any particular issues with the hotel itself, our room was clean and comfortable a bit on the small side perhaps but I did not expect a large room in New York. The hotel decor was very bland and the staff were bland the hotel food was quite high priced and bland, but as others have said you don't go to Manhattan to sit in your hotel. The worse thing we found was the location apart from the empire state it was quite a way from anything, we had a hard job finding a nice resturant to eat in on foot. We did enjoy having our coffee outside on some table on the pavement and watching the world go by for a bit

<Title>“Oh dear...”
<Content>Paying Â£136 a night for one standard room for two adults, we thought we would be ok. How very wrong we were. No one at the door to greet us or help us with our baggage, very cold reception staff too. The hotel lobby reminded me of a basement or the entrance to a London tube station - garish lighting and grey brick walls - were they trying to recreate a minimalist look? Took the lift [which looked liked it should belong in a hospital] to the 10th floor and stepped out onto a dull corridor and found our room which was right next to the noisiest air-conditioning unit ever. The room was disgusting, about the size of a large car, stains on the carpet, it smelt awful, the bathroom couldn't even fit one person in it. Nowhere to put any belongings. We asked to be moved to a different room, they gave us one of the same size. The main room was smaller but at least the bathroom was bigger. However, the bathroom was so dirty you did not want to walk bare foot in there - other people's hair on the floor. The conditioning unit in the room was very noisy so we could not have it on during the night [despite it being august]. During the nightwe woke up to the most appauling smell, it was horrendous. The next day it got worse. Whilst getting ready for going out for the evening my daughter went to the wardrobe and a MOUSE ran from under her bed and down a hole beside the wardrobe. She id not tell me about this until later that evening, she was worried about my reaction, but when we returned at 11pm we went into out room to find the radio playing full volume. This was it. I went downstairs to complain and as I was waiting for the lift, the mouse ran down the corridor towards me and into another room - FOUL! I was furious, went to speak to the front desk and their reaction was 'all hotels have mice'. After a lot of arguing we were, thankfully, upgraded to a nicer room, although they were reluctant and refused at first because we hadn't paid for a better room. The staff were rude and unhelpful. The decor is dull and drab, the carpets are filthy and the whole place smells. And it's in the sleazy area of town...DON'T DO IT!!!!!!

It's a complete dive I have stayed in better hostels in Australia and the location is not great yes it is round the corner form the Empire estate building but youâ€™re only going to visit that once better off staying on 7th near Times Square. The hotel room we got was shocking very tiny room No cover on the duvet and the room smelled of old cigarette smoke and dampness. We paid for a double but all they could give us was a twin and they were not apologetic at all and no help with our bags.

<Title>“Excellent hotel and location”
<Content>I am surprised by some of the negative reviews left. I stayed at the Hotel 30-30 in Feb/March 2007 and thought it was excellent â€“ very clean and modern and better than we expected. Iâ€™ve been looking at returning next year. The location was great. People have complained that itâ€™s not central and you have to walk far to get anywhere. Thereâ€™s no such thing as central in New York â€“ itâ€™s a big place and you have to be prepared for walking or using public transport. This Hotel is around the corner from The Empire State Building and 2/3 blocks from 5th Avenue. It was walking distance to a lot of the main tourist attractions including Macyâ€™s and Times Square. Thereâ€™s a subway/ underground just around the corner and lots of bars and restaurants in the immediate and near vicinity. The Hotel itself was very pleasant. We had a lovely room. My boyfriend and I paid a little extra for a Superior room and were very happy with it. King size bed, great shower and lots of room. There was no view from the window but if you want views â€“ go to the Empire State Building. The staff were nice - they arranged us a taxi back to the airport, which was cheaper than the one we caught there and carried our bags to the car. We had a lovely meal in the restaurant one evening. Excellent quality food and wine, although a little expensive. Overall this hotel was an excellent base from which to explore New York. Good location and great room â€“ a very modern hotel.

<Title>“No problems here”
<Content>We stayed here on our first vistit to NY. The Hotel room was a descent size and was very clean. The locatoin is great, just around the corner is he Empire State building (go to the top of the Empire, the view is breath taken). Also very close to shops Macy,s, Maddison Square, and subways. The hotel staff were polite and helpfull. Just on the corner is a cafe called Miss K,s they do the best coffee and very cheap and its open 24hrs!. dont listen to all the bad comments, it amazes me what some people expect for this amount of money. Enjoy NY it is great, we are returning this Oct, but the THirty Thirty was fully booked so we are stopping at the Milford Plaza.

<Title>“Average Thirty Thirty”
<Content>I stayed here in May of 2006. The hotel was about 3 blocks from the Empire State Building and about a good 20 minute walk from Times Square. It wasnt very central at all and involved alot of walking to get to certain attractions. The hotel itself was okay. It was your basic average hotel. It was a cheap hotel and I paid for what I got. It was clean but basic - ideal if you are looking for somewhere just to put your head down at night and then get up and out again to see attractions the next day. The staff were friendly enough. There was no air conditioning so if you are going in the hot months I wouldnt advsie this hotel as it got very warm at night.

<Title>“A Basic Stay”
<Content>I visited New York for a short break with my boyfriend. The Thirty Thirty Hotel was simply a basic, clean hotel to sleep but not good for much else. As we spent more time out of the hotel/room, the lack of facilities & attractive interior made no difference to us, although the wall view from our room wasn't exactly great. Our double room was pretty basic, nothing fancy at all, it was also quite small. It did however include a double bed, a huge TV (too big for the room) a coffee machine, sink & shower room, can't remember if it had air con. I would say that it is probably a bit pricey for what you get. There is a small bar & that's pretty much it. I cannot comment on the food they offer as we didn't eat at the hotel at all. The location was probably the best feature, it is walking distance from The Empire State building & quite central to other attractions by a short taxi ride.

<Title>“loved the hotel but not the booking agency”
<Content>I booked our room through NewYorkcity.com (BAD IDEA) and the recovery tax and surcharges alone were almost the price of the room itself, a whopping $146.64 for two nights , the recovery price I think was for my jaw dropping on the floor. It was highly deceptive because in my opinion it was not spelled out up front how much the recovery charges and taxes would be. I would not recommend booking with them to anyone. The hotel itself was in a safe area near subway lines and Penn Station. It was a long walk from Penn Station but dooable with minimal luggage. The hotel staff were exceptional in answering questions on how to get to and from New York City interests. I would definately stay here again but book with another site or deal directly with the hotel. Nice hotel, great location, with lots of good places to eat nearby.

<Title>“Great Find!”
<Content>The rooms at 30-30 are a bit small but I didn't go to NY to stay in my room. I experienced a great nights rest in the VERY comfortable bed and a nice hot shower every evening and every morning. The restaurant off the lobby served very tasty meals and nice cool Mojitos! Just what I wanted after being out on the town for 10-12 hours. The bathroom did not have any counter space so I made my own with the ironing board---worked great! I guess my only complaint would have to be the lack of a coffee pot in the room, but really there are lots of great little coffee shops right outside the front of the hotel where you can sit and read your paper (they deliver each morning) and watch the people in the streets walk by ---around the corner on 5th Ave. The staff was friendly (by NY standards) and accommodated my needs and requests. All in all, if you just need a bed and a shower ----- 30-30 will fit the bill perfectly. Oh, and the location is quite in the thick of things or nearby with a short cab ride. I would stay again.

<Title>“Great location, comfortable, clean and went back 2 weeks later”
<Content>I am very surprised by the few bad reviews I have read. I wanted a basic but comfortable hotel in a good location to start a tour of the east coast. Hotel Thirty Thirty was exactly what I wanted and the location was even better than I had hoped for. I stayed one night in single room, then booked a twin room for two weeks later. I booked a single "petite" room online and paid $139 for one night. As a lot of the reviews have said the room was small, just room for a single bed, bedside table and my bag, but it was clean, cool (great in july) and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom again was small (basin, toilet and shower cubicle) but was functional and fully tiled in grey slate which made it feel almost luxurious! My room looked into the court yard area and so was quiet, also a bonus in NYC. I was so pleased with the hotel that I booked another night with a friend at the end of the tour ($250). Again this room was smallish (two single beds, two arm chairs, a small desk and tv cabinet) and the bathroom was clean, bright and had a bathtub as well as a shower. The toilet blocked soon after we arrived but the maintenance guy came and fixed it within 10 minuste of us reporting the problem. My friend booked another night and checked into her single room at 10am and again had no problems. The location was execellent; a few blocks from the Empire State Building and subway, with a few delis and reasonable restaurants around for food and refreshments. I would not hesitate to reccommend this hotel to friends or even to use it for business purposes.

<Title>“Hotel from Hell”
<Content>Well, My company booked me here not knowing anything about it, hoping it was a nice "boutique" hotel. A Motel 6 would have been a giant leap forward compared to this. The Lobby is innocent enough. The first room was all marked up with scratches, gouges in walls and doors, etc. It was so small it had no closet only a small bed and small window with aircondiitioner unit from the 1960's in it and looked out on constuction site all of 25 ft away. It was so dark and clautrophobic that I began to hyperventilate. They gave me a room a tiny bit larger (without window a/c) but like the first it had no bed spread, bed skirt (showing a very old and soiled looking boxspring), no towels in bath, stuff in toilet too. I have to say, even their maid (who was v.nice) was appalled when she came to try and correct it. I managed to stay one night with help of sleeping pill and made my escape the next AM. I couldnt even use the shower-the place just gave me the creeps. There are many other inexpensive options in NY-dont bother with this one.

<Title>“Good value”
<Content>Great location - could walk or get the subway to everywhere we wanted to go. Couldn't swing a cat in our room but who wants to swing a cat when you're in New York - the hotel room was just somewhere to sleep. Bed linen and duvets were excellent. Beds were really comfortable. Housekeepers were friendly and helpful, as were the valets. The Front Desk was a little inconsistent ranging from unhelpful and a little surly to extremely helpful. Zana, the restaurant attached to the hotel, was a lifesaver after a busy day in New York. Food, cocktails, wine and service were all good at reasonable prices. Didn't see other rooms but if you're a business traveller check that you'll have a desk and a chair. We just had two twin beds. Overall, very good value for the location provided you're not expecting to spend too much time in your room.

<Title>“Downright creepy”
<Content>I just stayed at the hotel for a business trip - I travel to NYC frequently for business. We paid $295 plus taxes for our rooms. I felt like I was in a surreal movie set at the hotel. The staff was not friendly, as has been mentioned, but not rude. The doorman did watch me struggle up the stairs (no ramp) with my bags and didn't even hold the door for me, but I could deal with that. I had a larger room on the 12th floor that had obviously been updated. My bathroom looked fine - the only real complaint I had about that was the lack of adequate lighting - fairly tough to put on makeup for a business meeting in the dark - but it was OK. Close to the elevator on my floor was someone's personal room - they didn't seem to have AC so they had the door propped open with an umbrella. The contents of that room were just filthy - they also had a piece of paper taped to their door saying do not disturb and keep quiet. Very bizarre. The was quite stark and the chairs were stained. Ugh. We also met up with the old lady who seems to live in the place. This is just not a good business hotel. The restaurant doesn't even open until 8 am, so a normal breakfast meeting is out of the question. As a frequent visitor to the city, I would definitely recommend looking elsewhere.

<Title>“It's location is it's best feature”
<Content>They say location is everything and this hotel certainly has that. I'd read all the reviews before I booked and was dubious, however my sis had stayed there and had found it fine so booked on her recommendation. The immediate area isn't the most salubrious, scaffolding on a lot of the buildings, however, no noise so wasn't a problem. The hotel lobby is vast, unwelcoming and the staff were fine, but not what I'd call overly friendly, more businesslike. The room was a standard one and was very tiny, barely any room for hanging clothes and with your suitcases on the floor made walking around a little tricky. However, it was clean, the bed comfortable and the bathroom adequate, I didn't go to New York to stay in the room so basically fine. The restaurant adjoined to the hotel was a disappointment, we ate there once on our first night, too tired to trek around for anything else. The food was poor and not good value for money. We sat at the Crooked Knife across the road each night and had a drink before bed, a nice little place to chill at the end of the day. All in all, not a bad hotel, but not a great one either, if you want a hotel with clean rooms, comfortable beds and a really great location then the thirty thirty fits the bill. I'd certainly stay there again.

<Title>“Not reccomended”
<Content>I reluctantly read previous reviews of this hotel after I had made the booking and was convinced that it would not be that bad - WRONG. We arrived at the Thirty Thirty at 9pm on a Friday night after travelling around America for 3 weeks staying at various priced hotels so thought I had an idea of what to expect. The first impression was the bell man who let the door go in my face whilst we struggled with our cases, then the arrogance of the front desk clerk, who was neither welcoming nor pleasant. We asked for an ashtray to go with our smoking room (naive to think one would already be there?!) at 10pm and again at 11.30 - this still hadn't arrived the next morning. When we questioned why we had a kitchen in our room (practically next to one of the beds) we were advised this was a mistake and we should have been allocated a room without - we packed our cases and were allocated a different room when we returned from our day out - this was possibly the smallest room in the world. If you sneezed on the toilet you risked fracturing your skull on the sink. The Hairdryer didn't work, nor did the electrics - the sockets of which were hanging out the wall. Not wanting to make a fuss we left it and just stayed there the night thinking we would put up with it. Then in the middle of the night the toilet started flushing itself every 3 minutes and the air conditioning started revving like a motorbike. We were then allocated our third room where the bathroom was bigger but there was no natural light as our room backed onto a courtyard with the adjacant building. The sockets were still hanging off the walls and we couldn't get the shower to work but luckily we had a bath. We gave up in the end and just stayed in the room for the last 2 nights. I've never complained about a hotel room in my life and definitely always chose an easier life than to moan about things but I would warn anyone about booking this hotel. The location is good but it's seriously outweighed by the numerous bad points. There are plently of other hotels in the surrounding streets at similar prices so opt for them. The hotel lobby is very deceptive as it is quite impressive but all that changes when you enter whichever room you are unlucky enough to be allocated. Like the people before me have stated, I too have stayed in a range of hotels from budget motels to 5* complexes and expect to at least have a clean, functioning, safe room whatever I'm paying - not at Thirty Thirty!

<Title>“Great location, spacious executive king room for NYC”
<Content>I'd seen several reviews saying this hotel was dirty, etc, but I didn't find that to be true. My executive king room was almost a suite with a separate sitting area w/desk , tv & sleeper sofa. The bathroom was quite spacious (although it only had a large shower) with modern decor. The bed was very firm, nice white linens, lots of fluffy towels (except for the last night of my stay when the maids apparently accidentally locked the bathroom before finishing restocking). A few negatives: the first day the hallway reeked of cigarette smoke (not true on later days), the dark tile and dim lights in the bathroom made it impossible to put on makeup in there, maid service didn't clean the coffee maker once during the 4 days but they did restock the coffee. The staff was helpful the couple of times I asked for anything. Except for some very early morning construction going on at a building next door, the room was quiet and well-insulated from traffic noise. The best feature of the hotel is its location: lots of excellent restaurants within a 3 block radius, subway only 1 block away, short walk to Madison Sq. Park, Empire St. Building and lots more. I definitely plan to stay there again when I take my family.

She dont speak (just stares at you!) even when you say hello. So does the Staff, very ignorant. Except the Croatian Girl, she was very friendly and warm. But i wouldnt recommend that place to anyone. Im sure there are better hotels in this pricerange!

<Title>“Terrible staff...”
<Content>Mmmmm, the 30-30 hotel. Well as the ad's say "it does exactly what it says on the tin" and nothing more. Good points are its location, and this is probably its ONLY good point!. Its five minutes walk from Times Sq and two minutes to the Empire State Building. Bad points, I'd have to mention (like other reviewers) the staff. I've never met a more unfriendly staff anywhere in the world. The receptionists where unfriendly, cold & unwelcoming despite a warm "Good Afternoon, its great to be here" from myself and my son. We asked about various tour's, taxi's, places of interest's close to the hotel to be met with a look of 'WTF are you bothering me for?'. Things didn't get any better when we went to our TINY, SMELLY room. I mean, this was the smallest, meanest hotel room imaginable, but the safe worked and was free. The hotel as a small, dull and poorly stocked bar. But when we stayed (Feb 2006) we were served by a friendly Croatian girl who gave us a few laughs and a few good pointers to NYC. If your looking for a hotel with a good location and someone just to get some sleep after a day's touring the 30-3o will do the job. But the room we stayed was a dog box, don't expect friendly staff and even a half friendly hotel. Arrive, see NYC and go!.

<Title>“Location Location Location”
<Content>If you are looking for a place at a fair walking distance from Times Square, Central Park, good shopping places, good restaurants...then choose this hotel. LOCATION VERY GOOD!! We stayed in a standard room. We requested for a twin bed, but they did not have such for our stay. A great thing was, they made one for us! Another problem we had was already when checking in...they did not see our reservation...so we waited for our room for awhile (we reserved through a web-site...) After travelling for more than 12 hours (+jet lag from Europe) you appreciate getting your room fast to relax and get feet up. At the moment they are building next door, so the banging in the morning starts at seven. When the construction is over, the hotel will be a great place to stay. Our room would have been very quiet without the construction noise in the morning. The air-conditioning system is placed to the window (as usually in NY) and this would make sleeping close to the window very cold during cold weather. During our stay the days were warm, but nites were quite cold, so we tucked a blanket on the air-conditioning for night-time. Bathrooms are VERY roomy and clean. Rooms are rather small, but if you travel so that your hotelroom is only for sleeping and not spending time, the size is convenient/adequate. -Married couple in their thirtys, Scandinavia-

<Title>“No atmosphere and rooms decor dirty”
<Content>No you don't have to be snobby to see that you are not getting what you are paying for. My fiance and I were very disappointed as we paid for an upgraded hotel as it was a trip that we wanted to spend a bit extra to have an added bit of luxury and which we paid for but we did not get value or an upgraded room. The first room (whcih were supposed to be upgraded rooms) were dirty in the decor and smelled. We were eventually changed to another room which was ok but the air conditioning unit was blasting outside the windown and you couldn't open the window for the noise and fumes. Besides the rooms the hotel had a terrible vibe, there was no New York Manhatten atmosphere. We made a decision to move to another hotel as this was a vacation where we wanted to leave thirty thirty hotel behind us and we enjoyed the rest of our stay in New York.

<Title>“Perfect. Anyone who say's this hotel is no good is a snob!”
<Content>I don't understand some of the people on here! My girlfriend and I have just returned from a trip to New York and Hotel Thirty Thirty was the perfect place to stay! Ok the staff weren't over friendly, but check in was really quick and the porter took our bags to our room. The room was a nice size, bed was really comfortable and you've got everything you need! Empire State building is on your doorstep, there's a deli 1 min away (if that), 10 mins walk from Time Sqaure, your practically as close to everything you want as you could be! Ok its not the Plaza or the Hilton, but it was very clean and we were given fresh sheets and towels everyday. At the end of the day who the hell goes to New York and spends most of the time in the hotel? YOUR IN NEW YORK. the hotel is just for spending about 7 hours in just to sleep! And to top it all off the hotel provide a car service back to the airports for $60, which is alot cheaper than a cab with a running meter! And ours was a limo! Anyone who say's this hotel is no good is a snob and are obviously not seeing the main point of going to New York for a trip....to see New York! Not to spend the whole time in your hotel! If I go back to New York I will definatly be goin back to Thirty Thirty.

<Content>we booked on the hotel web site & confirmed twice by email that they would keep are room as a late arrival as our flight did not arrive until 23.30. All was confirmed that this was not a problem. we arrived very tired with a 1hr delay at the hotel at 02:30 to find they had no room for us. .they put us in a cab to another hotel for the night and told to come back in the morning. They honoured our booking for the further 4 nights but the staff did not make feel us they had done good of the situation and a sorry was not given. Would not recomend. hotel is clean and basic.

<Content>The room looked pleasant enough but reeked of cigarette smoke (no non-smoking rooms available) - apparently the staff like to use the guest rooms as their private lounge area. It took 3 calls (and an hour) to the desk to get a sleeper couch made up - the worst mattress ever - you could literally feel the springs through it. Some of the staff members were rude to the point of nasty. Watch the billing carefully when you check out. Overpriced and a total disappointment. I definitely would not stay here again.

<Title>“Gross. Just Gross”
<Content>I arrived for check in at Thirty Thirty knowing it would be a step down. The price was great--under $200 for a single (which could be a twin bed) but the location is good, other hotels owned by the same owner are great, and a good value (On the Avenue, for one). The hotel is dirty--the front doors are dirty, the lights in the lobby are caked with dust--the hotel, while design to feel upscale, actually feels like it was designed as a contest for a cable TV show. Anyway--I checked in, took my key and went up to my room. It was a tiny roomâ€”but thatâ€™s ok for NYC. I quickly noticed the bed looked unmade. The pillows were wrinkled, like someone had been there and left, just pulling up the covers. Nothing was tucked in. I pulled back the sheets---thinking this might just be the way housekeeping does things at Thirty-Thirty--low and behold the sheets were not clean, clearly had been slept in and there were a couple hairs in the bed, which I looked for knowing this would be the tell tale sign (I travel a lot). Ok, fine, gross. I went downstairs, got a new key, went to the next room. When I arrived at the second room a bad sign--the carpet in front of the door to the room had something on it, looked like sheetrock dust or dried bread, but darker. The door in the narrow hallway next to the room was blocked partially by a walker--what a senior would use (clearly a senior was in the next room which was also so small their walker didn't fit?). I opened the door and saw the comforter on the floor and the ironing board out and bathroom lights on. Another dirty room. I went back to the lobby and told the same person at the front deskâ€”he contacted housekeeping via walkie talkie. I asked for another room---he said they were sold out and asked me to have a seat while housekeeping "verified" that the rooms were in fact dirty. He said if so, they would clean one. Keep in mind, I've just flown 8 hours, it's 6:30 at night and no, I really don't want to wait. On the one hand--these things happen. On the other hand--gross. Two dirty rooms, a dirty lobby, an overall cheap wannabe international hostel feeling. The hotel is not "Premier" or "chic" as the website claims, it is a poor excuse for a dolled up mess. If you want an affordable hotel and are 23 and donâ€™t care about anythingâ€”this is the hotel for you. Otherwise, it. Oh--after waiting a half hour, I called another hotel, got in, dropped off my key with the same front desk guy (who was overwhelmed with a line of customers while his colleague was on a smoke break on front). Good riddens.

<Title>“Pleasant Experience”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews of this hotel, I was slightly worried that it would be a dump with rude staff who have lost your reservation! Not true. The staff were very helpful, the reservation was fine and the room was great. New Yorkers aren't as immediately friendly as some folk; there is very little eye contact, but don't mistake this for rudeness. We stayed in a standard room with two larger-than-single beds and a large bathroom. Everything was spotless and we had maid service each day with clean towels and new toileteries. It's a great location too, right in the heart of things without the nightmare of Times Square. It was very noisy (the windows don't actually seal like our double glazing) with sirens, honking horns and bin collections at all hours of the night but what do you expect? It's like that everywhere in NYC unless you stay on the 40th floor. Bring ear plugs. There are a million and one places to eat within spitting distance too. There's even a new tea shop opened at the top of the street! But don't expect a decent cup of tea the whole time you are in NY unless you like it weak and out of a paper cup. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone who wants a nice, reasonably priced, clean hotel in a good location.

<Title>“Poor service and overpriced”
<Content>This hotel is one of the worst I have ever stayed at. The standard rooms do not have air conditioning! The website says it has all the amenities... in the US... AC is not an amentity... its STANDARD!! By US standards, the rooms are very small. The hotel staff was rude and incompetent. For the price they are charging, there are MUCH better options in the city! With the accomodations and level of service provided this hotel should be priced much lower than it is.

<Title>“Good value, good location”
<Content>This hotel is located within easy reach of Penn Station, 34 St Subway and 33 St PATH, and all the shopping around 34 St. Leaning slightly to the East it's a little less polished that other parts of Midtown, but it really is well situated to act as a good Manhattan base for business or pleasure for the budget minded traveller. My room was on the small side, but was clean and had a comfy bed. The only problem I had was the fact that there was no spearate heating in the bathroom and the week I stayed saw temperatures dip to -15, so showering in there in the mornings was refreshing to say the least, not helped by the, fine looking, but freezing, granite floor and wall tiles. I had no issues with the staff, they were polite and efficient, not offish in any way. My remote was broken on arrival and they had a engineer up to fix it within 5 minutes. For the price I paid ($148 per night which is very reasonable for Manhattan)), I thought this place more than hit the buttons.

<Title>“excellent location!!!”
<Content>Stayed at the thirty thirty for 4 nights and i loved it. It was in an excellent location-Walking distance to most attractions- couple mins walk to empire state, macy's, broadway & 5th ave..... . Don't expect any luxury or you will be disappointed- it is very standard. I travel quite a lot and didnt find this hotel particularly bad and i didnt find it dirty as some have said in their reviews and i am known for being very fussy so thats saying something!! The resturant is ok not expensive, average price's for NY. If your looking for some where standard in new york with excellent location this is a great place. I've even booked to come back here for my stay this summer.....

<Title>“Great place to stay”
<Content>This is a great place to stay when on a break in New york. It is well situated for all you want to do, there is a great bar/resturant opposit a 24 hour deli turn left and up 50 yards on the right and they will even deliver to your hotel room for free. Yes the rooms arn't the biggest but if you go New york and do anything other than sleep in you room then you really are sad. The whole place is very clean the front desk is very helpfull and yes we saw a fwe old women about the place but they were always plesent and friendly. You must do the open bus tour in the day and do the night one aswell. We didn' do the empire state building because of the ques but what we did do on the recomendation of our virgin rep was to go the Rockafeller building on 50th street and went to the top of the building called the ROCK. It's not quite as tall as the Empire state but the view is not restricted and it also took us no longer than 10 min to get to the top in a high speed lift, do the helicopter ride(10-12 min) but do book in advance. Get a taxi from the airport at jfk as it will cost no more than $45 to anywhere in Manhatten,

<Title>“No No No, Never Again”
<Content>Dirty. Smelly. Cigarette burns. Small room - need I say more? I only stayed here because one of the other guys in our group found this place, and apparently they had a "special" (it wasn't worth it). I came up for just a night for my friend's bachelor party. The lobby is grey and bland. The whole hotel - not just the rooms - smell like cigarettes. My headboard had a cigarette burn the size of a nickel in it. Our bathroom smelled like body odor. The room was so small the bathroom door couldn't open all the way. The photos the hotel show on their website are apparently just one room, because I couldnâ€™t find a room like it. The whole place is smelly, stained and worn down. For the money there has GOT to be another place in New York that's better. If you're in town for more than one night DO NOT stay here, find some other place.

<Title>“Would never stay here again...”
<Content>Ewww! Yuck!! Wear flip flops in the shower. Don't touch the walls. I work for a non-profit and in an attempt to save money, they put us here for a recent trip. If you only want to save money then I guess you could stay here. But if you want a clean room, don't do it. There were ants in the bathroom. They don't actually clean every day - more like straighten up. I had a room that had what looked like two toddler beds - junior twins? Or maybe they were supersized cots. Not sure. The room was only a little bigger than the beds. This was not a room you could hang out in. Needless to say I won't stay here again. Oh, the lobby was nice. So if you don't mind sleeping there, that was the best place in the hotel. Words I've seen to describe this hotel - upscale youth hostel, Hotel Dirty Dirty, etc. <-- very accurate. I could not wait to get out of this place.

<Title>“Value for money, enjoyed our stay!”
<Content>I also was very scared and aprehensive about staying at Thirty Thirty after reading the reviews on this website, however I am pleased to say everything went well during our stay. We were checked in and in our room within about a minute and a half of walking in the main door of the hotel. I was expecting a room the same size as our beds, and true it was relatively small but we had plenlty of room around both beds plus enough room to store both of our large suitcases and all our shopping. There was a massive TV in the room with plenty of channels which came in handy while we were getting ready to go out etc. Our bathroom was huge with a basin, toilet, bath and shower. It was all clean and tidy. We ate breakfast downstairs in Zana's restaraunt so we could then go back upstairs and get ready for the days activities. The food is nice, I wouldn't say it's expensive compared to eating in a similar place at home in England (it was $12 for a cooked breakfast) but if you're on that much of a budget you can just order toast! The best bit about the breakfasts (according to my mum) is the waiter who's sole job it is to go around refilling people's cups of tea and coffee (because she's a tea addict and it tasted like "normal" tea) her record number of refills one breakfast was 7! Anyway, on the whole we found the Thirty Thirty to be clean and reasonabley priced. The housekeeping staff were friendly and seem to take pride in their efforts and it really showed. (We saw the corridor carpets being hoovered everyday by the way) I would however be inclined to agree that there are long term ressidents in the hotel having bumped into a few elderly ladies in the lifts on various days who did not look up to much travelling but this did not negatively impact upon our stay. This was by no means the most glamorous hotel I've ever stayed in, however we got what we paid for and were happy to compromise somewhere to sleep with more spending money! After all if you're going to NYC to spend the whole time in your hotel rather than just using it for somewhere to have a hot shower and sleep then you're going to the wrong place. But rest assured the room we stayed in had the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in!

<Title>“Loved ThirtyThirty”
<Content>After reading reviews on here for ThirtyThirty, I must admit that we were TERRIFIED about staying there, we were certain that it was going to ruin our trip. I had to email the hotel about our requirements, they were prompt in replying and MORE than helpful, they really were, totally exceeding our expectations! We arrived to the hotel a while before the actual check in time and our room was ready, the lobby was exactly like the ThirtyThirty website shows. The receptionist was very prompt - no complaints! We stayed on the 10th floor, the lifts were quick and clean, the corridor was fine, carpets a little dirty, but who spends time in a corridor? The room was a Superior room and exactly as shown on the website. We had a lovely big queen bed, with sparkling white Egyptian cotton bedding - the bed was SO comfortable, two large bedside cabinets, a desk area and a walk in wardrobe containing a safe. There was a large TV in the room and also a CD player. The bathroom was slate and had sink, toilet, bath and shower - all of which sparkling clean. The room was more than large enough for us two and ALL of my shopping bags and luggage, and believe me there was a hell of a lot! The AirCon was a little noisy but we were able to sleep with it off so not a problem, when we needed the AirCon on, we were awake, so the noise didn't bother us at all. The toilet did overflow once but the janitor was there within 2 minutes of my call to reception and cleaned up the mess promptly and efficiently. Once we requested more towels and within 10 minutes we were provided with an abundance of fresh, clean, white towels. The room was cleaned every day of our stay, the bedding changed and we met the maids in the corridor a couple of times, they were lovely. I particularly liked the location, it's on 30th and Madison, just near to the Empire State, it's far enough out of Times Sq to get a real feel for NY and you get to see so many New Yorkers going about the daily lives, there a couple of fantastic delis around too, well worth a visit! I would however recommend that you don't eat in Zanas restaurant in the hotel, it's weird, it's over-priced and the food wasn't up to much! This hotel is a 3* hotel and is recommended by tour operators for the budget conscious traveller - if you expect a higher star rating, then pay for it! In my opinion ThirtyThirty lives up to this and the service that we received and experienced was first class, it really was. If you just want a clean, comfortable, modern base for your NYC trip, then ThirtyThirty is perfect for that. The website portrays an accurate picture of the hotel. I would definitely stay here again and definitely recommend this hotel as an excellent 3* hotel in NYC. We really enjoyed our stay!

<Title>“Will stay there again - will recommend to friends”
<Content>Myself and my partner stayed there from 11-16th March '07. We stayed on the fifth floor at the back of the hotel. Although the room is compact in terms of size, it was lovely and clean, nice decor, and a really modern bathroom. There was little to no noise, day or night and the maid service were friendly and polite any time we bumped into them. The reception staff were curteous and prompt. The restaurant is very handy, however quite expensive, but there is a new pub directly across the road called the "crooked Knife" with excellent food and drink and friendly atmosphere. its a block away from a subway line and 10 minutes walk from 34th street. We will definitely stay there the next time we go to New York. If you need a taxi, Its cheaper to get one on the street, rather than getting the bell boy to get you one, so dont get fooled by him!!

<Title>“Great Hotel Great Location”
<Content>Stayed at the Thirty Thrity with friends at the begining of March and found it to be a great hotel. It is in a fantatsic loaction to be able to get to all areas of the city with ease. Some rooms are smaller than others but still larger than some london rooms. They seem to be doing the hotel up and we all found the rooms to be clean and tidy and certainly not shabby at all. Houskeeping was not always reliable when asking to make up the room but they always provided clean towels and took away any rubbish. Front desk staff were not overly friendly but always helpful. Have certainly had worse service in bigger brand hotels. Would definately stay here again when in NYC and would recomend it to others. Good value for money

<Title>“Don't go there in Winter!”
<Content>I stayed at the hotel Thirty Thirty for two nights in March. The room was very small, but clean enough. The temperature outside was about 5 degrees fahrenheit, and the temperature inside the room was in the fifties. My bed was sandwiched between two windows, and was swept by chilly draughts all night. The heating wasn't working properly, and was so noisy that you couldn't sleep. And even if you manage to sleep with the heating on, the temperature in the room won't get decent anyway. The staff at the front desk was kind enough to provide me with an electric heater, but this didn't quite solve the problem. Other guests I have been speaking too complained about the same issue. Anyway, if you have a chance to go there when the temperature outside is milder, the hotel is in a great location - just a few blocks away from Park Avenue.

<Title>“Okay...but just okay”
<Content>Stayed at thirty-thirty for one night. The hotel is not what it appears on the website in terms of appearance. The pictures make it seem cool and trendy, which it could be, if it was cleaner. Everything is showing its wear, the hallway carpets are stained, and it all just had a grimey appearance. The check-in person was not the friendliest, but she wasn't rude either. She seemed put upon. We got the superior room, which I'm glad we did. it was oddly shaped and you could tell what the smaller rooms must be liked because the seating area and the sleeping area were weirdly divided, the seating area had a different kind of ceiling and it was higher. The room was long and thin and the bathroom was just what I imagine it would be like on a cruise ship. The door is a shower door, you walk over the ledge of the door to enter and the toilet and shower are there. That step over is very dangerous and could pose a real problem in the dark at night. The entire bathroom is tiled in the same school shower type of tile. It was the weirdest bathroom I've ever been in. And really really dirty, like years old mold, nobody is even trying to remove anymore. The bed was comfortable but the remote didn't work. However, for a cheap price, I'd probably stay there again, if only for a night.

<Title>“Great price, good room”
<Content>If you were to rate NYC hotel rooms on $USD/sqare foot, this would probably be an average-priced hotel. The room was small, but clean and well kept. Bed was comfortable, and I slept like a rock. My room had unique issues with noise in that it was right next to the elevator, so there was a low rumble at all times. Other problems: heater seemed to want to be on high or off; room would have been better suited with a small flat screen, as the TV was nearly over the bed (the rooms are //that// small); TV remote only worked the volume; water in lav ran brown one morning. To those who complain about room service: this is in NYC. Go out and eat. That's where you're going to find decent food. Consequently, I have nothing to complain about. Its 2 blocks north of the 6 train, which is not the most convenient stop. When in NYC, I primarily use the subways, then taxis second, so I would have preferred a bigger line. If you prefer taxis, then the location is fine. Next trip to NYC will find me putting the 30-30 in the "to call" list, but will not stay there if I can find a bigger room at a comparable price.

<Title>“Was not impressed”
<Content>This hotel is definitely not a three star hotel - a 2 star at the most. The photos on the hotel's actual website are very misleading as the hotel is nowhere near as modern as it "appears". The standard rooms are very tiny and the bathrooms are extremely "cosy" to put it mildly. Although its location is good the hotel is not the greatest. They don't serve breakfast before 8.00am which is slightly strange and there is no room service! So if you arrive late be prepared to starve. Definitely not a hotel that is worth the money you pay for it! Would not stay here again.

<Content>reading the reviews before we left i was really worried, i even rang my travel agent to try and upgrade, there was nothing available. so preparing for the worst we arrived and it looked ok from the outside, in we went staff was fine at reception we went up to our room which was on the 10th floor and all my worries was over the room was fairly small but enough room for 3 suitcases and walking around fine. It was very clean and the maid replaced towells everyday. Your hardly ever in your room apart from washing and sleeping, i was really pleased with everything, there is access to computers downstairs in the lobby so you can pre book your outward bound flights, overall all this is fantastic value for money and i would tell anyone who i knew going to new york to stay there.

<Title>“Brown Water in the Shower - White Water in the Sink?”
<Content>This hotel should be ashamed of themselves... When we checked in, there was no one to help with bags, and we had to cart them up the entry stairs ourselves. The front desk was supremely UNfriendly and actually bordered on rude. Then, the bellman did help us to the room, and he was the only bright spot in the two-night stay. The photos online are deceiving... Technically true, I suppose, but deceiving. We had no desk or high-speed internet access in our room. The only "hotel" bar I saw was the restaurant/lounge next door (which had very friendly service and good italian food). The hallways smelled of urine, and it was not clean. I noticed that the maids actually just walk right in without knocking (once while we were sleeping), and then never bother to come back when you've gone for the day (even when we saw her on the way out). There was body hair in the shower to accompany the mold. I suppose that made the (I WISH I WAS KIDDING) brown water that came spewing out of the shower head feel more at home... That doesn't mean you should bathe from the sink, though... That water is cloudy and white. I felt disgusting the entire time I stayed at this hotel. Get all this and more for $229 a night! They should be ashamed of themselves!

<Content>Stayed here solo in Feb 2006; good location, just around the corner from the Empire State; Mid-town means you're in quick reach of everywhere. 5th Ave and Madison Ave are a few minutes from the front door. Room was large, albeit with view over a back yard! The downstairs bar is also not cheap, but a good place to met fellow travellers/natives. There are some OK delis and other bars/restaurants in nearby streets. I would stay here again although I'd like to experience some true NY luxury next time like, er, the Four Seasons perhaps...

<Title>“Trying to give a balanced view of Thirty Thirty”
<Content>Seldom have I seen a single hotel have such disparate reviews on a Hotel, needless to say we were wary but had booked on a friends recommendation so trusted to that rather then the reviews. Hence Iâ€™ll try to give a balanced view. First impressions werenâ€™t great actually, the taxi approached along W30th Street to E30th and itâ€™s not the most salubrious of NY streets. Pulling up outside the hotel past a handful of carpet shops and empty shopfronts under re-construction didnâ€™t add to the experience. Check-in was businesslike rather than friendly, but efficient nevertheless. The room was much as expected, smallish, practical neat and tidy though rather dull and uninteresting. Dashing to pull the blind to see our view, the blind fell off the wall to reveal the backside of some dreary dark buildings ! So not a great start, many people may have been put off, but undeterred we unpacked and never looked back. The blind was soon replaced and once settled in we found the room quite cosy, an excellent bed and shower and bathroom (to be honest theyâ€™re the important things), TV, coffee making facilities and efficient air-con (though noisy). Itâ€™s well located in midtown with (for example) Empire State, Time Sq, Madison Sq gardens, Grand Central, Flatiron Building all within 30 min walk. So the hotel was perfectly OK for what we needed, itâ€™s not expensive for NYC and whilst itâ€™s neither elegant nor plush we were more than content with it. Whatâ€™s close by for practicalitiesâ€¦.. Zanaâ€™s bar/restaurant is attached to the hotel and is a perfect place to chill for a drink or two and the meal we had there was more than OK. Directions from hotel front entrance by Zanaâ€™sâ€¦â€¦â€¦.. Turn left outside hotel and left again and thereâ€™s a decent French restaurant on the opposite side of the road. (1 min) Left outside the hotel and thereâ€™s a good value deli 100/200 yrs on the left (corner of Madison or 5th?). (1 min) Left outside hotel and on the facing corner thereâ€™s a handy shop, also sells food. (1 min) Area between 30th and 32nd streets and Madison and 5th Avenues is an area of Eastern shops and restaurants (Korean I think), many open 24hrs. (3-5 mins) Turn right outside hotel and thereâ€™s a selection of restaurants along Park and Lexington avenues. (5-10 mins)

<Title>“Perfect Location, lovely hotel!”
<Content>Myself and my best friend spent a week in this hotel on our first trip to NY in December and we were not disappointed. The location is perfect for shopping, sight seeing, eating out etc. You are literally a 5-minute walk away from the Empire State Building and 5th Avenue and it is always easy to hail a taxi from outside the hotel. The staff were very helpful when we arrived, they told us that our request for 2 single beds had not come through (we booked on the hotel website) but that if we wished to stay in a double the first night and then switch for the remainder of the week it wouldn't be a problem. We said it was fine we would just take the double room for the week. I was very pleasantly surprised by our room upon arrival! It was much bigger than expected with a big built in wardrobe, a huge double bed with the comfiest duvet Iâ€™ve ever seen on it, a big bathroom, big TV and a separate desk and chair in the corner of the room which was very handy for putting all our shopping on!! There are some residents in this hotel as Iâ€™ve read in some other reviews but these did not affect our stay in any way. In fact, one of them had a cat that would sit outside their room and greet you everytime you went in or out! I am not sure if bigger animals i.e. dogs were aloud in this hotel but we did have 2 cats on our floor which didnâ€™t cause us a problem but if you donâ€™t like animals beware there may be a few about the halls. The only thing that I didnâ€™t like about this hotel was the restaurant. Myself and my friend were exhausted one night after a long day shopping/sightseeing so we decided to just have dinner in the hotel. I was shocked at the prices they were charging and we ended up paying over $100 for 2 starters, 2 mains and 2 cocktails. We went out the following night to a steakhouse around the corner, got all of the above plus dessert and drinks and paid just half that! Overall this hotel was good value, a pleasure to stay in and I would definitely recommend it. I shall be staying here on my return to NY for sure!

<Title>“First "boutique" hotel experience”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Thirty-Thirty over Thanksgiving weekend and found it quite enjoyable. We originally booked the hotel because it was the cheapst room we could find to sleep four-five adults. We stayed in an Executive Queen room which included two beds (one bed was very hard and we later found that it was two box springs on top of each other) and a sofa bed. Some things to have in mind before booking at the hotel. 1) Getting into a refurbished room is key. Our room was very large and actually had a lot of open space. The building looks like it was once an apartment complex so some rooms are very small. Just confirm with the hotel before you arrive about the size of your room. 2) Don't bother asking for a room with a view. There isn't a view from any side of the building. While the hotel loby was kind of "hospital waiting roomish" it was also nicely decorated for the holidays. Probably the best "view" in the hotel. 3) The most luxurious part of our stay at Hotel Thirty Thirty was the shower. The water pressure was great and we always had hot water. Also all of the bathrooms have been remodeled to have granite tiles on all of the bathroom surfaces.

<Title>“Horrible Staff and Awful Rooms”
<Content>This hotel was horrible. I have never dealt with such rude staff in my entire life!!! For one thing, there was never more than one employee on duty at a time. Second of all, we checked in at 5pm on a Saturday night (we were only staying one night). We booked a standard hotel room (two double beds or one queen bed on Hotels.com). The "manager" at the front desk checked us in and told us he was giving us a room with two DOUBLE beds. When we walked into the hotel room it was the size of a closet w/ NO NATURAL LIGHT. The beds were single beds (not double!!!) We immediately went downstairs and asked for a room w/ two double beds or one queen. The manager said that they had plenty of empty rooms but that they would charge us an extra $40 for an "upgrade." My boyfriend and I explained to the manager that we had booked a room on Hotels.com and the room we booked was for two double beds/a queen and NOT for two single beds. The manager was so rude and started screaming at us that he "wans't giving us a free room!" Considering the fact that 1. we had already paid for a room and 2. we had paid for a room w/ two double beds/a queen, we certainly weren't asking for a free room. I asked the manager, why he would charge us for an upgrade if we had originally booked that room and the hotel was half empty? He just said that was not what the computer said and refused to give us the room we had requested unless we paid an additional $40.00. So we eventually decided to pay the extra $40. The room we "upgraded" to was barely an improvement. It was completely bear and there wasn't even a glass to pour water. I was so thirsty and had to lap up water from the sink like a dog!!! I will never, ever go back to that hotel again. When we tried to talk to the other manager about it later that night, he couldnt even get off the phone (he was on a personal phone call) to speak w/ us. My boyfriend called the manager again on Monday and his call was never returned. My experience was "AWFUL!"

<Title>“New Year in New York”
<Content>We stayed here on a New Year break, December 2006. Our room was on the 12th floor and was clearly what you would describe as a 'standard' room. It was small and not exactly luxurious but it was clean and tidy. The hotel lobby was spotless and the building itself was quiet and in an excellent midtown location - a great base for exploring New York. If we were to return to New York we would splash out a bit more and go for a little more luxury.

<Title>“brilliant hotel!”
<Content>Me and my partner went to the Hotel ThirtyThirty in January 07, we found our stay absolutely brilliant! The room was small but clean, which is all you really need, because no-one spends time in the hotel when visiting New York!! The staff were all friendly, which is nice. The hotel has a little bar/restaurant, called Zana's, where we spent some afternoons after all the sightseeing, which was good, staff in there were also friendly. The hotel is brilliantly located, we actually walked most places! Overall, I would advise anyone to stay in this hotel and we would most definetley stay there again.

<Title>“A Weekend in New York”
<Content>We have just returned from a long weekend in New York and had a fantastic time. We booked the Hotel 30 30 through lastminute and everything went smoothly. We chose the hotel because of its location and price, it was about Â£100 per night for four nights. There seemed to be a lot of other English/ European couples staying. The room was not very big and we didn't have a good view, but we didn't go to New York to look out of the window or swing cats around all day. We went out sight seeing every day and walked miles. It was good to get back to a warm and clean room for a good nights sleep. The bed was good, the bathroom was great with a super shower. Cleaned each day with fresh towels. We arrived at 4pm last friday and by 4-45 we were on the 87th floor of the Empire State Building. The location was fantastic. If you want a hotel with room service, mini bar, fancy breakfast etc you won't get it in mid town for this money. We thought it was fine and would recommend it to anyone.

<Title>“Thrity Thirty hotel = great NY experience.”
<Content>Myself and my boyfriend stayed in the Thirty Thirty hotel for a week in mid Decemeber. The check in was extremely quick and the staff friendly. Our room, altough small, was extremely comfortable and clean. The Queen size bed was very comfy. Altough the sink was in the bedroom it did not bother us. There was plenty of space for storing your suitcase and hanging clothes. Rooms were cleaned on a regular basis and the few days we put the do not disturb sign on the door the maids knocked on the door to see if we wanted clean towels. The safe in the room is very helpful and we were pleased to have it. The two times we had problems, one when the safe broke and the other when the toilet became blocked, staff were extremely helpful and sent someone up straight away. The location of the hotel is brilliant. Very close to Macy's and the Empire state building. The resturant attached to the hotel is brilliant for a relaxing drink after a long sight seeing day in NY. No problems at all with this hotel, i would recommened it very highly.

<Title>“A nice hotel”
<Content>We stayed at Thirty Thirty for seven nights and had no problems at all. Our room (802) overlooked the front of the hotel, with a nice view on the empire state building. It's a small room, with a very small bathroom, but has all that you need for sleeping in NYC: it's clean with a comfy bed, a big TV and more clean towels than a couple would need. This is not a luxurious hotel, you won't find any amenities, the corridors could be not as clean as you would like, and you could meet some old ladies in the lobby (what's the problem with it?).. but this hotel has all that you need for a comfort stay in NYC. First of all, the great location, then a good bed, helpful staff (even if the night receptionist could give you some misleading infos -always check in the morning..-), it's in a quiet street and a safe area, and it's very near to metro stops. So, I would definitively suggest this hotel if you don't need five stars. You can surely find better hotels in NY, but you get what you pay for.

<Title>“Most comfy beds! I just love Thirty Thirty.”
<Content>We were concerned about stayting at the Thirty Thirty, after reading some of the reviews. We anticipated the worst (dirty sheets, ragged teddy bear, homeless ladies, closet-sized rooms, surly service) - but upon arrival and until we checked out 6 days later, we had one of the best Manhattan hotels stays ever! The bellman was very courteous - he graciously helped us with our bags and even checked our room, to ensure everything was in order before he left. We stayed on the 12th floor, on the front side of the hotel, and had a great view of the Empire State Building. Yes, the rooms are a bit small, and are basic - the beds, though, are comparable to Westin's Heavenly Beds. I was delighted to see the crisp white sheets, duvet covers - I slept so well during my stay. The white cotton towels are very nice, and the bathroom was, unexpectely, well ventilated. We did come across some of the original residents of the former Women's residence - they were all very courteous and well-kept. The cleaning staff which we encountered were very pleasant, and did fulfill our written request for more conditioner, when we left a note on the bathroom counter. The young lady at the front desk was very helpful in reserving a car for our trip to JFK. For $60 (inclusive of tip and tolls), it was one of the best deals in town. If you get hungry in the late evening, you must try the street food vendor at the corner of 5th and 30th. He serves the best chicken skewers I've ever had - for $2.50/skewer, it was a steal! He usually sets up his cart around 6pm - and in the late evening, there is always a line up of hungry taxi drivers. Location is the best! The hotel is 2 blocks from the 6 subway line, and to the West, 2 blocks from the R & Q subway lines. I love Thirty Thirty - thank you for a wonderful stay.

<Title>“Great Location budget hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel Thirty Thirty at the beginning of December for a girly weekend shopping trip. I was very anxious about staying there after reading some of the previous reviews but was pleasantly surprised by what we found. The hotel is a budget hotel and the rooms are small and cosy. Our twin room faced the front of hotel and it was slightly drafty but this gave the room it's own air conditioning factor and you got to hear the great sounds of the city. The reception could do with being a bit more professional and responsive, but you are getting what you paid for, i can't imagine they are being paid that much to give the service to us. We did also spot on our last day what would seem to be homeless ladies sitting in reception arguing over popeye chicken, and that a few of the doors on our floor were different and looked more like a front door rather than a hotel door. The best thing is the location which you could not fault a few blocks and streets over from the Empire State Building, Macy's and a few more streets up Times Square. The other great thing is the little bar below which I think serves the best cosmopolitans in the city, and believe me i tried a few on our trip. If you more interested in saving your spending money for shopping and sightseeing rather than spending out on a fancy hotel this is the one for you. The rooms are cosy, clean and the beds are very comfortable, especially after a long day of walking around.

<Title>“Never return again!”
<Content>We just spent our 2nd family NY Xmas trip at this hotel for a 2-night stay and 6th visit in Manhattan hotels. What a bad experience. We would not recommend it at all to any one especially any family who needs a little bit more than the strict strict minimum. We were not looking for luxury but only a bit of comfort away from home. I am a 3-4 star hotel (4-5 when traveling south) budget traveller and like to search a lot before I book to get the most out of my money and was reluctant to try this one but was confused by the different opinions. Now I wonder if the great ones were posted by the hotel. That's the reason why I feel that I have to share our experience, a real one. CONS: First the strong air freshener made us uncomfortable as you walk in the hotel and is all over the place. It took us a day to get used of it. We were in room 219 with yes lots of the old ladies of the building who live on that floor. We don't mind about this matter since they don't bother us at all except that I think the hotel neglect this floor cause there are permanent residents and except when we were in the lobby and one of them scared my kids. Bad view, hard mattresses, urine smell, a small TV, oene tiny standing closet, only one tiny garbage bin on the washroom. The hairdryer The next morning only 2 sets of towels were there, the sheets were not changed. The staff are so not happy to see guests. We asked for parking informations when we arrived and they didn't even inform us that you can save 20$ at the one at the corner of 5th and 30th, we saved more than 40 bucks cause the parking guy told us not to forget to get our voucher stamped by the reception to get the rebate.We had to wait 20 minutes to pick up our stored luggages and we were the only ones in the lobby. Now I understand why this hotel is not busy compared to all the ones we stayed in Manhattan at the other visits. PROS: The room space was large enough to move around. Great location but there are lots of other hotels around the block. I know we are only there to sleep but just hope that we can help some families or parties to avoid a bad experience which could make your NY trip less enjoyable cause we love NY.

<Content>Couple - 30s, We stayed for 5 nights early Dec. Hotel was just ok, not worth 200 euro a night. though. Having checked a lot of hotels in NY city on many websites. 30 30 was one of the cheapest. the only good thing about the 30 30 is the location. The hotel could really do with a makeover it is a little tired. Wont be staying there again nor recommending it.

<Title>“too basic for words”
<Content>I recently went to new york with my daughter for a girly christmas shopping trip. We looked at the hotel on the web before booking and I would say that the description should make clear how basic it is. There were 2 beds in our room and absolutely nothing else! We didn't even have space to lay our cases down on the floor. I would describe this hotel as a transport hotel or student accomodation. We fortunately found a much more comfortable hotel nearby for the same price so we moved out immediately. If you want comfort and a bit of luxury don't book thisone

<Title>“Descent Hotel”
<Content>In brief, good hotel and would recommend. However for my full experience, read on: FLIGHTS & TRANSFERS: I have no complaints about the flights we got delayed going out and coming back but that was an air traffic control outage in Edinburgh and Glasgow, so was not BA problem. BA did however, managed to not send one of our cases, which was very frustrating but at least we had the other one. We were told we could spend up to Â£50 for the inconvenience and the case turned up 48 hours later. I had booked Supershuttle through Expedia for transfers to and from our hotel but they are not a 24hr company and had stopped for the night before we arrived. We got a lift from somone offering us a lift in the airport. He cost $50 and was fine, however after reading our guide book it said never to do this and I understand why, you never know what could happen. HOTEL: The hotel was my main concern after reading reviews. The entrance to the hotel is nice, due to our late arrival my girlfriend and I had to spend our 1st night in the hotel sharing a single bed as there were no other rooms, however we were so tired it was good enough. However the single bed was not too small and it meant we had to be cuddle up close, but that wasn't so bad :o) The next day we got a phone call to say our new room was available. The room looks like the pictures on their website, its not big but was good enough for what most people will be using it for, sleeping. We did not unpack our stuff from the cases as it was too much hassle and the wardrobe and 2 drawers were a bit limited but not exactly a show stopper. There was a safety deposit box provided also. Now some reviews said the hotel was dirty and smelly and I can understand what they mean, however do not let this put you off as it is not that bad. The maids come in with fresh towels and make the beds, however I think it was however only once "quickly" in the 5 days we were there, but again not a big problem as it's not as if you are trampling mud into the room. So all in all the room wasn't bad at all. As for the smells, the corridors could smell very strongly off smoke and as we are non-smokers it was unpleasant but once in your room it was fine. The towels were changed daily and bathroom was a good standard. We stayed on the 10th floor and there did appear to be residents (doors were different) but we never heard nor saw them so this was not a problem as some people have reported. So all in all I WOULD recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good base. LOCATION: The hotel is well located, it has a starbucks and McD's round the corner, along with a Duane Reade (like Boots or Superdrug). Your only 2 blocks along and down from the Empire State building, which was really fantastic for views. Macy's is close by (I will detail this later). Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Designer shops and Central Park are all about a $10 cab journey (incl. tip) away or about a 15 block walk. SHOPPING: Main reason for going. Macy's is hell on earth for any bloke and most woman. t is the biggest shop in the world (apparently) and is 18.... Yes 18 floors of hell. My girlfriend is a keen shopper and spent 4... Yes 4 hours in there and we only made it 2 about 4 floors, it then became too busy and by the end of it my girlfriend even hated it. The shop display outside is cool though but NEVER GO TO MACY's :o) I am not a bad shopper but was in a very bad mood by the end of it. A few days later we went to the Good shops i.e. Chanel, Dior, Loius Vitton, Gucci, etc and this was much more pleasant. We did not have loads of money to spend but had saved really hard to have a good time at the shops and my girlfriend did this, with the exchange rate being so good and the pre-christmas sales we managed to get a real Gucci bag tha was originally about $800 for about Â£150 because of sales and conversion. So if you are a bloke and can handle a bit of shopping stick to the designer shops, it is a much more pleasant experience. SITES: When I was in NYC, being a massive Christmas person, I only wanted to see the big Rockefeller Tree. However in my naivety I did not expect it to be busy as the films and pictures you see it never seemed to be, but like I said I was naive and it was absolutely mobbed, the closest I got to the tree was about 50m and I struggled to even see the angel garden, so although it was nice to see the tree I was left a bit disappointed. Bloomingdales has a very cool light and music christmas display which I thought was fantastic. The rest of the sites you knew in NYC were great and will leave you all to discover and experience for yourself. CONCLUSION: Be prepared for a lot of walking and being tired at the end of each day, we got home most days at about 7 or 8pm and that was us done, reading a book, watching a movie or playing a DVD, just to unwind at the end of a day. Highly recommend the hotel for the price and location as well as NYC as a place to visit at least once :o)

<Title>“An okay hotel in a wonderful city”
<Content>Myself and my partner visited New York for the first time this year. We booked the hotel with the thought we would rather have a budget hotel and more money to spend in the city. Having only ever stayed in a 4* hotel I was slightly nervous before we left. However, although the hotel didn't have little extra we all enjoy it did have everything we needed. The rooms itself was tiny, we had a double room on the 7th floor. The only thing that I was really dissappointed with was the shower which i felt needed a good scrub. There is a daily room service which you have to request by hanging a sign on your door and then all that happens is your towels are changed. The hotel is in a good central location near the empire state building and times square- the thing I liked best about the hotel was it was slightly away from the centre which made it that mch quieter- you could still hear cabs honking so I dread to think how nosiy hotels on times square are. With regards to New York itself it is one place everyone should go it was amazing - I reccommend buying a New York Pass as it gives you discounts and lots of attractions and lets you skip the queue in lots of places saving valuable time. Another tip is buying tickets at the main bus station to Newark airport as it works out much cheaper than getter a cab. My final advise to everyone is where comfy shoes I had flats on and my feet are still recovering- we walked all over leaving the hotel at 8am and not getting back to 11pm.

<Title>“Above Average Cost Effective Hotel”
<Content>We were travelling for the first time from Engalnd to New York and didnt really know what to expect. We booked through a travel agents and although they said the hotel Thirty Thirty in Manhattan was an above average 3 star hotel, the reviews we read on Trip Advisor didnt match the opinion of the travel agents. We were expecting a dump...but low and behold the hotel was great. The hotel was in the middle of having some modernisation work done, but the reception area was very spacious and modern (covered in marble and white glittering lights), the staff were very friendly and most helpfull in assisting us with booking tours and trips etc, and the bedroom was attractive and modern. Although on the smaller side (but in no way too small) the standard double bedroom was modern in decor, clean and well appointed; just big enough for two! The bathroom was also of a good size and had a fantastic power shower. All in all the Hotel Thirty Thirty was impressive and very cost effective hotel for the budget concious traveller...would certainly recommend it to anyone thinking of going!

<Title>“Comfortable Stay”
<Content>Myself and my girlfriend have just returned from a weeks visit to New York. We stayed in this hotel (Hotel Thirty Thirty) and we found it to be a pleasant comfortable stay. We were only a 10 / 15 minute walk from Macy's, Times Square, Madison Square Garden. To be fair we only used our room to sleep in and wash but we found the staff to be helpful and the rooms were clean and tidy. Our room was tidied every day. If I was to return to New York again I would definitely consider staying at this hotel again.

<Title>“Not all rooms are created equal!”
<Content>I was concerned about this hotel after reading all the negative reviews, but couldn't find anything else even close to affordable for mid-October. I booked a room that was described as VERY small, and I was worried about the reviews stating that some rooms don't have shower doors and everything would get soaked. I called three times and was assured (laughingly) that "We are a real hotel, of course our rooms all have real showers." I finally reached the manager and he admitted some rooms have only curtains and the water might run all over the floor. !?!!!?! So he switched me to a room with a newer bath with a shower door. It was dingy and small, but clean and very quiet. It was nowhere near worth what they charged, but I was desperate. I think this hotel has drastically different quality of rooms at the same price level and you should certainly ask for a better one, although I had to call numerous times before I got a result. I think it helped that I pointed out how many bad reviews I'd read online. The desk staff are very non-responsive, but if you don't expect much, it's OK. Skip the overpriced breakfast (which several overseas visitors assumed was included) since there are several better places to eat on Madison. The location is great - best thing about it.

<Title>“Underwhelming”
<Content>I checked in very late (11.30pm) and may well have received the last turkey in the shop as a result, but my room (1221, for reference) resembled a hastily-converted cleaning closet. It was stiflingly hot, equipped only with single beds, the Internet connection didn't work, and the metal fixtures in the bathroom were rusty. The only ventilation/heating vent in the room had been largely taped over and when I attempted to raise the above issues with the front desk, I was told that the hotel was sold out. End of story. No doubt others will have better experiences, but I won't be trying Thirty Thirty a second time.

<Title>“Not a bad little hotel at all!”
<Content>My boyfriend and I spent 3 night's at the Thirty Thirty at the beginning of October, and we were actaully pleasantly suprised. We arrived at the Hotel before midday and was told our room was ready (room 1203) the staff were polite (we did have to pay an unexpected $50 deposit) So up we went to the 12th floor to our small but functional room. We were lucky to have a view of the Empire State building so that was a nice suprise. The bathroom was small but with a massive shower and clean towels every day. The bed was big and very comfortable and when the window was closed you couldn't hear any of the hustle and bustle from down below on the street. However, it looked like someone had taken their agression out on the wall as there was a small hole but the fact is we were rarely in our room to notice. The maid service was also good, we left a small tip every day and the room was spotless when we came back, what more could you ask for. Here's my take on the famous 'myth' about old ladies living in this hotel - I didn't see any, the hotel was full of people of different nationalities. The kind of 'hotel bar / restaurant' was a tad on the expensive side and the portions not very big for the money you paid but a nice general ambiance on the whole. The hotel is situated in the heart of Manhattan and we walked almost every where, every main attraction is practically in walking distance, but we did take the subway to go to Ground Zero, Grand Central Park and China Town (which smells horrible!!!) So to sum uf briefly our stay in New York and the Thirty Thiry, we had a great time, no real complaints about the hotel, had lovely weather and would recommend it to others.

<Title>“Loved this hotel and Great location”
<Content>We arrived feeling a little nervous as the write up's had been varied on the standard of accomodation but we were really happy with our room. We had upgraded at a minimal cost directly with hotel and our room had a huge bed with nice furniture and a separate lounge area, the bathroom was really nice and had his n hers basins and the biggest shower ever! The bed was really comfortable and there was no noise at night making it easy to feel safe and have a great nights sleep. There is a small bar / restaurant attached and we loved it! jenny behind the bar was great and made some fab cocktails; she was interesting to talk to and she gave us lots of pointers om where to go. There was a range of guests and some lovely Americans gave us subway tickets to use and we found everyone really friendly and helpful. location wise, this place is spot on. You are round the corner from the Empire State, a couple of blocks from Grand Central station and in the middle (literally) which makes Soho easy on foot and central park pretty easy too. the shopping was AMAZING! I was in heaven and we ate pretty well for relatively little money; drinks were quite pricey but hey we went to enjoy ourselves! We would recommend taking the Staton Island ferry to see the statue of liberty, there are no queues and you get a great view - it is also FREE! The Twin Towers area is very eerie and I found it quite sad but you should go as it is somewhere that I think everyone should see just once. We didn't take pictures but lots of people do, personal choice I guess. South Street sea port has some good shops and is nice to wander round but really your best areas are Soho and the bigger stores - make sure you go to the help areas and get your discount vouchers! Would we go again and stay at thirty thirty - absolutely yes, take me today!

<Title>“Fantastic Base”
<Content>Stayed here on the first three nights of our honeymoon. Fantastic location (just five mins walk from Empire State), and very reasonably priced for a New York hotel. Whilst the bedroom itself wasn't massive, the bed was big and the bathroom was very generously sized as well. Couldn't have asked for more as a base for our New York trip. The bar next door to the hotel also serves a fabulous Cosmopolitan (rumoured to be the best in New York according to the waitress!!). Would definitely recommend this hotel to others.

<Title>“Should be Dirty Dirty, Not 30/30”
<Content>kEEP AWAY,hotel was nothing like advertised on DIAL A FLIGHT website. rooms are tiny, filthy and very poorly decorated and that believe it or not was an upgrade!! Would have been cleaner and cheaper staying in a hostel. In fact one of the many bag ladies hanging around in the lobby told me there was anumber of homeless women who actually lived in the 'hotel '. The manager ridiculed us when we complained so on our return I contacted a National newspaper who sent an undercover reporter to check it out. It was so bad they ran a full page spread on it, comparing photos of what they say it looks like to what it actually looks like. It was by far the worst hotel I or my friends have ever stayed in. Be warned, total rip off , they should pay travellers to stay in it!!!!

<Title>“Thirty Thirty”
<Content>After reading all the bad reviews about this place I was a bit wary. However neither my husband nor I could complain. OK the room was tiny but you are in New York!!! It was perfectly adequate for what we wanted which was somewhere to lay our heads after our days out in New York. It was clean and tidy. The towels were changed every day and for that they couldn't be faulted. So if you are looking for a hotel in a decent location that's not too expensive then this is the place for you.

<Title>“very nice”
<Content>i have read all the bad reviews about this hotel and stayed there only a week ago, it is a very nice hotel, our room was a standard queen room on the 10th floor with plenty of room for two people, comfy bed and nice view from the window. the bathroom was clean and spacious and everything served its purpous. the restaurant next to the hotel is very nice, quite expensive for breakfast however but there are many nice cafes in the area. try Guy and Gallard i think its called on east 33rd its very nice and cheap too. dont worry this is a lovely hotel. my parents room on the 7th floor was also very nice with a view of the empire state building.

<Title>“Ask for an upgrade”
<Content>I have just returned from three nights at the Thirty Thirty Hotel. When we arrived and were shown to our room I was horrified, it was tiny, stank of smoke, had a very small shower cubicle, a t.v. on the wall a double bed and that was about it. I rang down to reception, to ask to be put through to British Airways, who booked this hotel for us, only to be told they did not have a contact telephone number. They the suggested I spoke to the Manager, who after listening to how upset I was, offered me a " complimentary " upgrade. We were moved to the 9th floor, the room was amazing, huge bed, t.v. luxury bathroom, table chair etc. Infact it was hard to believe it was the same hotel. So if you go, remember they do have far better rooms. As for the comments re homeless people, that is in fact not true, there are some residents who live there, and it was used before as a hostel for women. Now however, although there are still some signs around of its past, it is a great hotel, within 3 mins of the Empire State Builidng and all Manhattans attractions. The room we had was exceptionally clean, towels and pillows changed ever yday. Also ask for a late check out as they are more than happy to accomodate. So in summary, after the room change we were delighted, location great, breakfast very good and cheeful staff. Hope you have as great a time as we did.

<Title>“Thirty Thirty me up !!”
<Content>After reading many of the previous reviews we were very worried about our stay at the Thirty Thirty. However we need not have worried at all as this hotel turned out to be a little gem in a big city! Having been to New York before we were already aware that the hotel rooms are always on the small side but lets face it there is so much to do in this city that your time in the room will be minimal. That said our room at Thirty Thirty was still perfectly fine and the shower is great by any hotel standards!. As for the staff we always found them to be very helpful and when waiting in the lobby area also overheard them helping other guests with their needs. The cleaners are also very good. Another point we had been worried about was the comments regarding the homeless women in the hotel. PLEASE DO NOT TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THIS AS WE SAW NOTHING . Finally i think anyone booking a stay at this hotel will agree they are not looking to book a luxury trip, if you are then i suggest you rethink and look uptown somewhere and spend hundreads more $$. However if you are looking for a good hotel with everything you need and above all else a fantastic location from which to explore the city then you need look no further.

<Title>“Loved this hotel”
<Content>As said in other reviews, this hotel is in a fantastic location. I have stayed in NY before but too far upper west, so this location was an excellent choice for me. We paid a good price for a twin room, which was slightly small, but who goes to NY to sit in their room anyway!!?? The bathroom was great with one of the best showers i've ever had in a hotel. The maids where great and the room was spotless everyday. Only thing missing was some tea and coffee in the room - how very British of me! The reception staff truly let down this hotel though which is a big shame - although we were expecting that anyway, after reading other reviews. But considering the more than excellent customer service we recieved everywhere else in the city, it is a let down. Although, the bellboys do deserve a mention as they are very helpful and efficient. If you can get a good price for this hotel, i would highly recommend it.

<Title>“great hotel and location”
<Content>Please ignore any negative comments about this hotel i stayed there for 5 nights from sept 8th this year. for the price you're not gonna get the flashiest hotel in town. the 30/30 is in a great location for all of manhattan, the bedrooms are a bit on the small side but clean, the bathrooms are plenty big enough and modern. i don't know what else you need when you've got the geatest city in the world in your door step. try the bar/restaurant "zana's" for a nice cool beer or cocktails. also turn left out of the hotel and you'll see a deli on the corner that is excellent turn left out of the hotel then a right on madison,cross the road, and near the corner is a great pizzeria, very cheap and the slices are massive. turn right out of the hotel until you get to 3rd av and you should see a bar called "tonic" to your right , a big sports bar with the added benefit of having a roof terrace so for all those smokers out there you can drink and smoke at the same time. enjoy the city,,,,,, its fantastic

<Title>“Can't Complain!”
<Content>6 of us stopped here from 7th-11th September in 3 different rooms and have no complaints at all. The cost of the rooms was pretty reasonable (about Â£200 per room) and they were all clean. The room sizes seemed to vary (we had the smaller one but we were only using them as somewhere to sleep and get changed before going out in the evening). We tipped the chambermaids $1 per day and the room was spotless for the duration. Its in a good location (close to the Empire State and several subways). The bar next to it was ok, and there was a good place to get breakfast across the road called Tastys which was very popular with the NYPD!!! Would definitely stay here again if on a weekend break.

<Title>“Unimpressed”
<Content>I was expecting something much better after seeing their own website and the write-up in the virgin brochure. It said the hotel was newly refurbished. It may have been but the standard wasn't great, and the room we were given was tiny! The bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom. Ok - maybe not that small. We could hear lots of noise from outside through the windows, and although we had a non-smoking room there was definitely a smell of smoke about. I expected more for the amount we paid to stay there.

<Title>“Very Basic”
<Content>Stayed at the hotel in late August. Location is OK, but not great, for a tourist in NYC. Got an 'excutive' room on the second floor - 2 queen beds and a sofa for $240. Mattresses were not comfortable. Bathroom was nice but very small. We found everthing to be very basic - lobby just a big room with nowhere nice to sit down, no room service (ajoining restaurant too pricey for the food and service), no movies in room. The reception staff could not care less - no recommendation on nearby places to eat, no stamp for post card, no help what-so-ever. Finally, our house key and cash (in foreign currency) were 'lost' when our luggage was in storage. We discovered it only after arriving in our home country. The hotel reception, bell boy and affiliated airport taxi company did not want to look for it and did not return our calls. We would not stay there again, and recommend others to look elsewhere.

<Title>“Beware The Thirty Thirty !! Do Not Be Fooled !!”
<Content>Looked good on the website, so we booked for a family trip to New York. How wrong we were! When we arrived and the reception staff were surly and unhelpful, we should have known what we were in for ! We had two rooms on the fourth floor, the corridor of which smelt of Cheap Airfreshener, and Incontinence ! Every now and again you would come across a lingering octogenarian shuffling along the corridor! To add insult to injury the room next door to my in-laws room had a note posted on the door recounting the tale of the most recent residents death !! How lovely.... NOT!! Our room was an Executive Room......... this meant no wardrobe, a damp bathroom, dirty carpet, inoperable air-conditioning, and a funny smell........... all those super executive comforts! We are lucky enough to travel extensively, and have stayed in many hotels in New York. This place was smelly, the carpets had thier own "residents", and it bore no resemblence to the pitures on the website! Low lighting, and camera angles can do wonders........ the words "descriptions", " trade" and "act" come to mind ! The price was 3/4 star, but the service and facilities did not even rate! Smelly, appalling value, and somewhat akin to the hostel that it evidently used to be! Not at all value for money! When we checked out early in the morning, the only person evident was a "bag lady" type apparition, watching the shop on behalf of the only member of staff who had gone to relieve himself ( probably in, or on, the forth floor corridor! ). Worst hotel we have ever stayed in..... take a tip.... just don't go there. It was not at all what we were expecting, very, very disappointing. Happy....... no way! Ripped off..... yes !

<Title>“Very Clean, Quiet Hotel”
<Content>I stayed at the Thirty Thirty Hotel on July 15-16th. I had a great time in NYC and was not looking for a fancy hotel, just a clean, quiet place to stay. The Thirty Thirty was all that and then some. I arrived in NYC rather early and went to the hotel at about 10:00 AM, with only the expectation of placing my luggage in storage until check-in. It turns out my room was ready, so I checked in. It was so nice to be able to freshen up in the bathroom! My room was small (I had reserve a single), but very clean and quiet. I met so many nice people at the hotel; lots of folks from Europe on 'holiday." It created a very nice atmosphere in the lobby area, which was well-lit and full of people at all hours. I would warn anyone visiting this hotel that my room did have what I would call a "European" shower; meaning there was not a formal shower, but a drain in a tiled area of the bathroom that served as a shower. It worked great and I had no problems with it, but if that would bother you, you might want to confirm a full shower before making your arrangements. Overall, a great trip to NYC at a wonderful price!

<Title>“Didn't disappoint, didn't enthrall”
<Content>The hotel was fine and I and my girlfriend were quite happy there for our 3 night stay. It is clean and friendly and the location is excellent for getting pretty much anywhere in Manhattan, north or south, very quickly. Given the tarrif of many other hotels I thought it was reasonably priced. We only really slept there as we wanted to see as much of the city as poss, so did not spend time in the foyer and bar(which is attached but did not seem to be "part" of the hotel) which are a bit impersonal and cold - not somewhere we wanted to remain for long, The room was very clean and well-decorated. On booking I did ask for a queen bed but our first night was on two singles pushed together, but they moved us the next day, which was a hassle but at least they did it. I would happily stay there again.

<Title>“Great Hotel.”
<Content>After reading many reviews for this hotel I was worried. My wife and I had already booked this hotel back in March for our 6 day trip to New York. At one point we even enquired if we could get a better room, they were fully booked. Anyway on our arrival, about 2pm local time, we were issued with our key card and went up to the 9th floor. I wasn't expecting much from all the reviews I have read, but on opening the door I was pleasantly surprised. Ok the room was small, but having stayed in New York before I knew it wasn't going to be huge, it had air con, enough storage, a bit tight but manageable. The bathroom was the size of the bedroom, but all very clean and comfortable. We werenâ€™t planning on spending much time in the room anyway. But the 5 nights we spent there were very comfortable. The hairdryer in the bathroom didn't work, we phoned down to reception and with in 5 minute a guy came up to try and fix it. He couldn't but left us another one. We didn't eat at the hotel as there are so many places within a few minutes walk for breakfast. This hotel has had some bad reviews, but my wife and I had a great time. I would recommend this, accommodation in New York isn't cheap, but this isn't bad for the money and in a great location.

<Content>This was the first trip for my husband and I to New York. We wanted a well-situated, clean and comfortable hotel as a base. Hotel Thirty Thirty was perfect. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful and we enjoyed being able to sit outside the hotel and be served drinks whislt we watched the world go by! We walked to Times Square and the Chrysler Building from the hotel and ate at a lovely French restaurant close by. The Empite State Building is within 5 minutes walk. We would certainly recommend the hotel. Travellers form Sheffield, England

<Content>We stayed in Hotel Thirty Thirty in June, on the basis of other reviews, and were not disappointed. The rooms were quite small (but this seems to be the way in New York) but there was enough room for us as we were only staying a few nights. The bathroom made up for it though, it was huge. Staff were very plesant and helpful, they arranged for us to get to JFK at the last minute. We had to stay in one night due to the rain and ate at the restaurant downstairs - great meal had at a moderate price. The location was also excellent - easy walking distance to Empire State, Broadway and Times Square. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel if you are a first time visitor to New York and want to quickly get your bearings.

<Title>“Zero Zero more like”
<Content>Hello Travellers :-) I wish I'd been a member of Trip Advisor at the time I visited NYC (my fourth trip), where my husband and I took my father (a senior citizen) to NYC In November 2002. Everywhere was booked up at the time, there was a HUGE conference at the time and everywhere was booked, the only place we could get was this (for want of a better word) 'Hotel' and it cost us an arm and a leg for the seven days we stayed. I fear this 'hotel' may have gone downhill since our visit, and we vowed that we'd NEVER stay here again, and try to warn as many friends and people as we could not to book their accommodation here. First of all BE WARNED - this 'hotel' was previously 'The Martha Washington' which was a hostel for women. I can vouch for the fact that there are residents still living in the building, and despite there being a complaint investigated yesterday by a top Scottish Sunday paper who sent a journalist to stay and investigate this accommodation, the Thirty Thirty denied that there was homeless' people living there, which is indeed true, however they did not confirm that there are residents living in the building from previous 'Martha Washington' days who have the right to live in this building. After our journey, we arrived at a busy reception to find that they did not have our room, and my dad was given a rollway bed, which I may add, was at rollaway prices for the week - about $150! We had no iron, but the room was spotless and the bathroom was brand new and ultra modern. There was no tea/coffee making facilities, which was a major disappointment and not good for a hotel that CLAIMS to be 'New York's Best Kept Secret' (as stated on their website). Staff were okay, but there was customers (groups of them) who had major complaints which I don't believe were resolved to their satisfaction. In comparison, our stay seemed okay, but I would NOT at any price stay at this 'hotel' again. I've since been to NYC since, (2004) and am booked up to go again next year, this time to the accommodation which I stayed at in 2004 which I can FULLY recommend to anyone, adults, families, couples etc (Radio City Apartments, Times Square) which costs a fraction of what the Thirty Thirty charges. You should check the amazing reviews for RCA's in comparison to the Thirty Thirty, and it's an room with kitchen or apartment with kitchen, WAAAAY better than what the Thirty Thirty has. I just feel sorry for anyone who is not able to review the Thirty Thirty, because without doubt, rip off prices and accommodation that is NOT as promised on their website is NOT being delivered to customers who are staying here. BEWARE THE THIRTY THIRTY! Good Luck, and happy travels.

<Content>I stayed at this hotel for eight nights during a business trip and it was perfect, much better than expected having read some of these reviews. The hotel was very centrally located and in a safe area. Though my room was on the smaller size, there was a huge bathroom and very comfy bed. The room was exceptionally quiet and clean and the staff very helpful. I was also impressed by the modern decor. Though there was no wireless Internet at the hotel, I was able to pick up multiple signals from the local area. They also offer high speed Internet in the lobby and in the rooms for a charge. I wouldn't expect anything better from a hotel at this price.

<Title>“Good Hotel, Great Location”
<Content>We arrived at this hotel and was really amazed from the outside as it looks really small and not very nicfe, when we got inside the lobby was huge and really nicely decorated. the bar was very nice and the food smelt lovely but was expensive. Our room was a bit on the small side and didn't have any views. The location of the hotel was fantastic we walked from our hotel to everywhere and on average took about 10 minutes to get to lcoal places such as Times Square, Central Park and The Rockafella Centre, the Empire State Building was literally around the corner which was fantastic. We took a cab to the statue of liberty but walked home as it was a gorgeous day it took about 2 hours to walk back but we went to other places such as Ground Zero, and even TGI Fridays. On the whole New York City is a great place to go sightseeing we stayed for my birthday this year and stayed for four days we saw eveyrthing that we wanted to do and will definatly be going back we will probaly even stay at this hotel again as it was very local to all locations.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>The room was clean, the shower was clean, the bed was comfy. I had no intention of spending any time except sleeping & washing in my hotel room once in New York, so the fact that the room was a bit on the small size was no problem for me, I could sleep, I could wash and that's all that really mattered to me, even had take out pizza one rainy night. I didn't have much interaction with the staff, but when I did have a problem they sorted it out straight away (shower handle broke of first day, they had it fixed within half an hour) Would recommend this hotel if its good for your budget, the location is good with loads of restuarants and shops within walking distance, Empire State Building around the corner.

<Title>“Great Budget Hotel - Fantastic location!”
<Content>Hotel thirty thirty is a great hotel its a budget hotel which doesn't mean much when your in Manhattan but good price anyway! The location is great just round the corner from the Empire State Building, Macy's, 5th Avenue, etc. This was my fourth trip to New York and I thoroughly enjoyed the Thirty Thirty. The room was clean but compact had a huge bathroom though! We had a problem with our shower it didn't work also the television didn't seem to work - I called down to reception and then went out sightseeing on my return everything was sorted - FIRST CLASS SERVICE! Reception staff were very polite and helpful - What else can I say - Fantastic!

<Title>“You get what you pay for”
<Content>We stayed at the Thirty Thirty for 7 nights. Found the hotel quite small, this was okay as we didn't really spend much time there. Initially we were assigned to a smoking room, and had to asked to be moved to a non smoking room as the room stank. I was dealt with promtly. Couldn't help but get the impression that everyone on the reception was in training because anytime I had any questions they always had to ask some one else. THe rooms are tiny. There is just enough room for a bed. The bathroom doesn't have a sink, its in the room though. Which I found a great inconvenience and unhygenic. The location was quite good. The bar next door had mice and when I approached the reception desk about the staff were quite unhelpful and more or less sayed that it wasn't thier problem as it wasnt owned ny them but it does open into the hotel. My advice is don't use the internet there, go to a different hotel or internet cafe as the computers kept freezing up and the staff were quite unhelpful. If you are planning o staying here my advice is to pay the difference and book a superior room, they are much bigger and more comfortable. I don't think I would stay here again.

<Title>“Good value, safe hotel for single traveller”
<Content>I stayed here on my own for two nights. The room was completely tiny but clean and the bed was comfortable. I felt safe and secure both inside the hotel and in the general midtwon area, and I was comfortable eating alone at the restaurant in the lobby. I had no problem with noise and the one request I made - for a pillow to be brought as there was none when I arrived - was done quickly and politely. The price was OK for Manhattan on a weekend. I might try somehwre else next time I'm in NY but had a perfectly OK experience at thirtythirty.

<Title>“Good Clean Budget Hotel - what more do you need in this great city?”
<Content>We stayed here the last week of February, our first trip to the US and found the hotel absolutely fine. Staff were helpful (Brits, remember New Yorkers are succinct and don't go for flowerness in their address - however, it doesn't detract from their desire to help). Hotel rooms were clean and tidy and were cleaned every day. We had a little kitchenette with fridge in our room which was very handy for brewing coffee/ storing snacks etc. Great location - less than 10 mins walk from the Empire State Building and easy walking distance to Times Square. Very close to 5th avenue which served as a great map locator for finding other attractions. We found a great deli just a stones throw from the hotel (turn left out of the main door and walk 1 block) where we had our breakfast there every morning (huge meal with toast, orange juice and tea all for around $5 - didnot need lunch). All in all was well worth the money - even managed to catch up on a couple of episodes of CSI before bedtime!!

<Title>“Average at Best”
<Content>We spent 4 nights here and the location is perfect (I used to live in NY so it was a no-brainer) but the service was below average. The internet in the lobby kept screwing up and they said that they didnt own the computers so if we wanted a refund we had to contact the company. It wasn't worth the 6 bucks I lost. The staff was generally unhelpful. and surly - not surprising in NY but this was little much. When out hair dryer shorted out and we called for a new one it never came. The room itself was failry comfortable but the shade had gaps around the side and the spotlight on the front of the hotel was right by the window so the room was never dark at night. The windows weren't very good at sound dampening (not double glazed I guess) and there was construction going on so it was pretty noisy on top of the usual street noise. The bathroom was tiny and tiled in those itty bitty tiles. It needed a good cleaning as there was some mildew in the grout and it grossed me out. A major down point, especially since the sink was in the room not the bathroom. The deal (120 per night I think - a steal in NY) was good and we didnt spend much time in the room so it was tolerable but I think next time we'll just spend the extra 30 or 40 bucks for a nicer room.

<Content>Stayed here 25 th -30th May 2006 Ok so it isn't the Ritz, But we had clean bed linen and towels every day and the room was serviced daily by a very pleasant maid. The desk clerks were sharp with lots of New York 'Savvy' but efficient. Location was great. No problems booking in and very helpful doorman who arranged return travel to JFK. In all a good budget hotel, so the rooms are smallish but for this Brit it was clean...

<Title>“You can get better value for money than this hotel”
<Content>Having stayed at the New Yorker on my last visit, we decided to look for a slightly higher rated hotel. We paid top dollar for the 30/30 hotel and what a complete let down. Don't be fooled by the nice reception area, the place is a hole. Each room look tired and depressing and felt like - what I can only imagine is a prison cell. Bathroom was OK but the room wasn't clean. Our friends room was filthy and even had public hair in the bed! You can even purchase a tacky 30/30 teddy and I would hate to imagine where thats been. My advice to first time new york visitors is stay at the New Yorker, its situated right by Macy's and is in a much better location than 30/30. The only good thing going for 30/30 is a deli close by, but then you have to talk past some really dodgy shops/blocks to reach it. All round terrible hotel that needs to literally clean its act up.

<Title>“Just right!”
<Content>I just got back from an NYC trip with a girlfriend where we stayed at the Thirty-Thirty. After already making the reservation, I had read some disturbing reviews about this hotel so I was very concerned about what we had gotten ourselves into. I am happy to report that we really liked it and would stay there again. The staff was helpful and friendly .... just not overly so, which was fine. Our room was small but totally clean and free of any offensive smells or rodents/bugs. We even had a fabulous view of the Empire State Building! There is almost no closet space but we were only there for four days and didn't care. The only negative aspect was that the bathroom was miniscule! If you are traveling with someone that you aren't 'close' with ... then I wouldn't stay here. We kept joking that you could actually wash your hair, brush your teeth and go to the bathroom all at the same time. But really ... for us it was fine. We weren't looking for 'luxury' - just clean, safe, and not crazy expensive. I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for the same things. The location is really good and we did not encounter any problems or issues with the hotel, staff, etc. FYI.

<Title>“Alright”
<Content>Me and my boyfriend stayed at the thirty thirty for four nights in March 2006. I had orginally booked into Hotel Wolcott but after reading dreadful reviews about the hotel i decided to cancel and re-book this Hotel through Opodo. We were quoted a brilliant price for our stay, which was working out about Â£100 (GBP) a night for the both of us. The pictures of the hotel looked decent, it was in a central enough location so we thought why not!! On arriving at the hotel after 10 hours of travelling you expect to be greeted in a warm welcoming manner but this was not the case. We were welcomed by Daniella who informed us that the price quoted to us by Opodo did not include US Tax of 13% so we were charged an additional $150.00. We were frowned upon because we didnt wish to pay for the hotel by card and choose to pay cash. On going into the room we discovered that our prior arrangement of a double bed was not honoured and we were welcomed by two single beds with a small unit in the middle. Receptions answer to this was come back down in the morning and change over rooms. Dont unpack bags and bring everything down the following morning. On going down to reception the next day we were told rooms werent available. Rather than have all the hassle we decided just to spin the beds round and remain in the originally allocated room. All in all our trip to New York was great, it was brilliant to see and a great experience. The thirty thirty was alright, it was clean, in a brilliant location. I maybe just got the reception staff on a bad day but at the end of the day we are all paid to do a job and courtesy and pleasantries go a long way.

<Title>“Ab Fab!”
<Content>Myself and my partner stayed in this hotel in April of this year. As it was my partners christams present i was abit anxious after reading some of the reviews but there was no need to worry at all. We arrived and we were checked in efficiently, yes the rooms are small but so what there is the whole of Manhattan to see - we only really slept and got changed there! The rooms were spotless and it cleaned daily with towels being changed daily also. The TC is fab with loads of channels. The staff were very friendly towards us - they organised a helicopter ride for us and even searched on google for a restaurant we were looking for (Top of the Tower - over looking Manhattan (great view but pricey) brilliant! It is in Beekham Hotel would def recommend it!!) We had no problems whilst we were there either and the hotel restaurant had lovley food too ( I would recommend Lasagne!!) All in all great trip - lots of shopping to be done - dont forget to get your 11% discount cards in Macy's and Bloomingdales there great you even get discount on sale items! Another tip book your Empire State Tickets before you go on their website in cuts out over an hours queing time.

<Title>“Disappointing and unfriendly”
<Content>We didn't expect to get a big room in NYC, but having booked a superior room advertised as having a small seating area, we expected more than one plastic chair squeezed in to a corner. We found the reception staff to be unfriendly and unhelpful, particularly when we queried a bill of $40 for two phone calls made to a reverse-charges number. (They wouldn't budge and insisted we pay) This combined with a host of little things like the maids using our room to watch Spanish TV while we were out, a dodgy shower, and not having the coffee replaced in the room, all added up to a very disappointing visit. We would definitely not recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>When first booking this hotel I had mixed feelings about after reading some reviews on it but it turned out to be fine. The hotel was basic but clean and room was cleaned every day for the time we were there. The best thing about the hotel is the location its situated four blocks from the empire state and is a ten min walk to macys and bout fifteen walk to times square. The Staff were very helpful when called upon and they hold your luggage if you have an afternoon flight also they offer u a limo and shuttle service if you want to avail of it. There is a small Italian restaurant attached to the hotel but not run by the hotel, menu is not great. Overall I loved New York and would definetly go back to thirty-thirty.

<Title>“We loved it!”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at Thirty-Thirty for 5 nights a couple of weeks ago and we had a very nice experience. We arrived about 5 hours before check-in time and not only they stored our heavy luggage for about an hour before the computer was on but also we were allowed to check in and go to the room at the very same time. We were very pleased. Yes, the room is small, but clean and comfy. Bathroom has very good space and is absolutely clean. Furniture is good, matress and pillows great. Safe box inside the wardrobe, which has very good space. Maids very sympathetic, manager was nice and everybody at the front desk was friendly. When we left, they stored our luggage again, for about 2 hours at no extra charge! Location is very good. 2 blocks from subway station at 28th St. Susie's kitchen on the corner with Park Ave has awesome coffee and breakfast items, as well as nice and healthy choices for lunch. When we come back, we'll definetely try Thirty-thirty again!

<Title>“Better than expected”
<Content>I was so worried about what I would find when I got to this hotel that I had warned anybody who would listen that I would be upgrading immediattely I arrived or going to a different hotel.... I am a VERY difficult person to please and I love my luxury. Not to be found at the Thirty Thirty BUT it is a BUDGET hotel, so I went with much trepidation. The receptionists were nice and helpful, room was small but clean, bathroom (Oh it WAS tiny) but the shower was made up of half the room and very powerful. Room was cleaned daily and beds changed. A lovely teddy on the bed to greet you and a large tv. No storage space but we made do. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and deffinitely believe I got value for money. So close to everything and we felt absolutely safe with the area day and night. The bar staff were friendly and the atmosphere great. I would agree with other reviewers that the porter left a lot to be desired and he was much nicer if he thought the tip was gonna be better!!!!

<Title>“Bad choice for businessmen, below average overall”
<Content>I have been staying here on and off for the past 4 months on business. In general, the hotel is not business friendly. The rooms have no desks, the internet connection ($10 a night, no other packages) does not support anything other than web browsing (pay extra for VPN). I have stayed in 8 different rooms so far. The beds are universally hard, about half the rooms have AC/Heating controls, the others you have to play with the window. Our company negotiated a rate with the hotel for a group of us for several months, but they have recently started to stick us in smoking rooms, claiming that there are no non-smonking rooms even though we reserve weeks in advance. I suspect they are giving the rooms to people that are paying higher rates than our negotiated group rates. Overall, if saving money in midtown is your overriding concern, it is passable, otherwise, I recommend looking somewhere else.

Obviously it must be your luck as to which room you are allocated. my friend and i did not spend a lot of time in the room but it was small but clean. Hotel was in a great location, good place if you are out and about only using your room as a base. Luxury is not on the cards.

<Title>“Good location, hotel iffy...”
<Content>Having read some of the reviews on here before travelling I expected the worst. I travelled with a female friend for a 4 night stay (28/3 - 1/4) and we were allocated an 'upgrade' - a corner room with kitchenette on the 12th floor (#1206). We were lucky because the room was actually a good size, had 2 single beds as requested, and we had a nice view of the Empire State Building too. We requested extra pillows and these were promptly delivered. And I had no complaint over the housekeeping either as our room was adequately cleaned every day. However our stay was not without its problems. There was a huge space under the TV where a dressing table could have been - but there was none, and also there was no mirror at all in the bedroom area. This made getting ready to go out very frustrating as we had to manage with the bathroom mirror! A full length mirror and dressing table in the bedroom were badly needed, rather than a kitchen that we didn't use. Also a bigger wardrobe could easily have been fitted in - it was tiny!!! Also, on our second night our heating stopped working. The weather in New York during our stay was lovely, but by the early evening in our room it was chilly and we wanted a blast of heat, but nothing. We contacted reception and eventually 2 men and a ladder arrived and fiddled in the roof - and it was fixed. But by this time we were under the bedcovers freezing. We then decided a nice warm shower was in order to warm ourselves up and get ready for our night out (and by now we didn't have much time as we were going to a gig). Unfortunately the shower was very cold and we were told the water temp. would be fixed in 30 mins, but we didn't have time to wait so we made do with cold showers and went out feeling decidedly frustrated. I have to say that most nights the shower pressure was dodgy, and at times went down to a trickle before coming back to normal pressure. The location was great though, and the beds comfy. I loved New York and want to return, though next time I would look for a different hotel in the same area.

<Title>“cheap and chic!”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews on this site - my companion and I were a little anxious to say the least. We fully admit to being two young women who live a champagne lifestyle (on a cava budget), and enjoy the finer things in life... However, we decided that we were only going for 5 days, would not be planning on staying in our room for too long and hey - the price was most definetly right! So the Hotel thirty thirty is not the most luxurious i've ever stayed in, the rooms are a little on the small side, but as a previous reviewer commented - our rooms were serviced daily, clean towels, extra pillows as requested and no complaints whatsover. The bathroom is a good size with the essential hot powerful shower and hair dryer - perfect for us girls who need to 'do' our hair everyday! Perhaps we were fortunate - we didnt need to approach the reception staff with the exception with one occasion when we asked them to locate a resturaunt for us - which they did with no problem considering it was not one they were familiar with. We also had the dreaded room beside the lift.... but it was fine, the occasional noise of other residents in the corridor was more disturbing in the middle of the night! All in all, i would strongly recommend the hotel - if your expectations are not too high. It is an excellent central location and would I most definetly return.

<Title>“Good Hotel”
<Content>Just got back from a 7night break with my Girlfriend at the Thirty Thirty. This was my second visit to New York so I knew already that the hotel room wasn't going to be big. The location is good, you are about a 5 minute walk from Empire State building and about 10 minute walk to Times Square. On checking in the staff were friendly and even though we were an hour early our room was ready for us. Overall if you are on a budget and want to stay close to Midtown Manhattan then I would recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Ok hotel, unfriendly staff”
<Content>Having read the reviews on this site I was a bit concerned about the quality of the hotel on arrival. Thankfully it was a lot better than I thought though I agree with some of the comments made. Firstly the staff (especially the evening ones) do seem to dislike being there and being asked to do anything (ordering the airlink/supershuttles to the airport, changing rooms to a smoking room, checking the availability of bigger rooms - even though this would bring them in more money) though I only mean the lobby staff. The staff and food at Zana's are both lovely. I had no problems with them finding my booking at all, which was a relief. The porters can and are happy to order you the airlink coaches even if the night staff try to fob you off to do it yourself. If you are staying in the standard rooms and think the space is a little tight, the beds are moveable and my mum and I found that by moving the beds against the walls and cupboards that this gave a lot more space. The bathrooms are huge in comparison to the rooms and the showers are hot and powerful, fresh towels are provided each day and there are conditioners, shampoos and soaps provided. I would say that the rooms and hotel in general are clean, if a bit scruffier than the pictures make out (why the teddy bears? this rather jars with the receptionists' general attitude to the hotel) Though the cleaners are friendly and didn't try to put back our room arrangement! The tvs are huge and have most of the main cable channels. Although there is no air conditioning the windows are openable and the hotel is warm, meaning you can get the room the temperature you want quite easily. The hotel backs on to an office block, so it's a little like the episode in Friends where joey and his neighbour across the way are singing 'morning's here' through their windows, but I would imagine that most NY hotels have this problem. At least the area is quiet and there is a nice deli on the corner towards madison avenue for snacks if you arrive late evening. I brought a travel kettle with me and Zana's do nice coffees and sell mineral water, so I didn't find the lack of facilities too bad. Yes if you are near the elevators there is a faint 'ping' sound in the background and the air vent from the restaurant is rumbly on and off during the day, but stops about 10 at night. There is a safe in the room which is easy to use. Overall it is a basic OK clean hotel which is a place to crash on a short break for those who don't expect to be spoon-fed. The location is good for the Empire State Building and 5th Avenue and one of the New York Sightseeing Loop bus stops (which I can't recommend highly enough for those on a short visit) and Zana's and the 24 hour deli on the corner make the stay more enjoyable. For breakfast, I recommend walking 5-10 mins to greenley square on 6th avenue and going to the martinique cafe for pancakes. I would stay there again, but only if it were for a few nights. If you've already booked, relax, it's not as bad as the reviews make it out to be, though it's no 4* luxury pad either.

<Content>I don't know how people could think this hotel is dirty. We had our room cleaned everyday. We stayed for 5 days, our first time in NYC. It was a blast and the hotel was in a pretty nice location. The room is not huge, but it's all you need for a trip. The bathroom is really spacious and well maintained. I would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Not Impressed”
<Content>Overall, very disappointing. Website picutures are real but cleverly shot to give impression of good size. Reception efficient but not very welcoming. Rooms are tiny - the smallest I have ever stayed in. Bathroom was as big as the bedroom though. Storage consists of one small wardrobe and two small but deep drawers and no space to store large suitcases (doubling up as storage). If you want a double room instead of twin make it clear when booking. Some rooms are quite noisy. Ours (325) was adjoining the lift entrance and consequently it was noisy all night - made worse by the drone of aircon unit from the restuarant below outside the window. Interestingly enough no aircon in the room. Little in the way of facilities. No tea and coffee facilites in rooms and limited opening hours at the (expensive) adjoining cafe/bar/restaurant - Zana's. Had to visit the deli on the corner of the block and get take out coffees. Whilst the location is great I would not stay there again. New York hotels can be small but there are many that have good sized rooms at the same price as the Thirty Thirty.

<Title>“Thirty Thirty? Dirty Thirty!!!!”
<Content>My girlfriend and I have just returned home from New York this weekend after a 4-night stay at the Thirty, Thirty hotel. I don't consider myself a fussy person nor somebody who enjoy's finding fault in accommodation and moaning for the sheer sake of it but I can honestly say that the Thirty, Thirty hotel is possibly the worse hotel I've ever had the misfortune of staying in! First things first - Thirty, Thirty's website, images and details of rooms are totally misleading - the website portrays fresh, funky, minimalist accommodation where in reality, rooms are sub standard, dirty and very, very basic. The corridor to our room constantly smelt of smoke, the rooms were small, not cleaned properly when booking, the shower was grotty and event the toilet paper in our bathroom was stained and dingy as if it had been dried out earlier that day! We asked to be moved to a different room and were given two rooms to choose from as an alternative - the first, had the delightful addition of a grubby kitchenette which Iâ€™m assuming only added room's somewhat peculiar aroma. The second - an exact replica of the room originally allocated complete with grime and dust! The hotel staff were less than helpful when we relayed our dissatisfaction â€“ it was only the fact that all of Manhattanâ€™s hotels were fully booked due the St Patrickâ€™s Day celebrations that we didnâ€™t cut out losses and find a suitable, more hospitable hotel. In summary, look elsewhere when planning your next NY break.

<Title>“Huge disappointment”
<Content>I have just returned from a 3 night stay in this hotel,what a let down. Last year we stayed there and were very pleased with everything,but this year. Where do I start, the rooms were so tiny and the smell of cooking was awful. The staff were the same, but had forgotten to take their happy pill. Only good thing about this hotel is the location, everything else, forget it. I visit NYC every year, but will never stay here again,there were 6 of us and we were all of the same opinion. Don't bother until it has been revamped and re furbished.

<Title>“Want To Go Back!!!”
<Content>A friend and I, stayed at the 30/30 recently and absoloutly loved it. We checked it out first on this site and seemed quite pleased with the reviews, so we booked it. We stayed for a week at the beginning of March 2006. Check in was quick and easy and we went straight to our room. Although it was small, it was very very comfortable. Came equipped with shower (v.clean), t.v with about 40 or so channels, hairdryer etc. The bathroom was quite big and the shower was great. Though it was small, we did only sleep there so it wasn't a problem. I would definetly stay there again and am planning to go back at the end of the year. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Very Very Pleased!!!

<Title>“Wouldn't make my dog stay there!!”
<Content>I know Manhattan pretty well, and I have stayed in many hotels across the globe. I don't think I am over fussy and I know you have to pay for quality. The ONLY, and I mean only, good thing about this place is it's location. There is nothing else worth writing home about. The staff are completely obtuse, huffing and sighing because we needed to move rooms because we found mousetraps in use, and the whole place stunk of smoke. The rooms were not the ones advertised in the brochures or website - BE WARNED! We have shelled out a lot of money for a group trip for my mothers birthday, and were completely disappointed. For a cheaper place to stay I'd recommend the Cosmopolitan Hotel (10 out of 10 for this place!) or one of the bigger hotels. This is not worth the deal you think you're getting as it's an awful place to stay...

<Title>“Nice, simple hotel in a great location”
<Content>For those expecting to be pampered - don't stay here. For those expecting a good, clean hotel in a great location - stay at the Thirty Thirty. This is a great value hotel. Okay, so the staff don't offer to take the bags to your room and you don't get fawned upon - but i'd take the price cut any day. We had a nice room - not big, but big enough for a couple of suitcases, our shopping and us, clean bathroom with a fantastic shower, and a view over the street. We didn't experience any noise on the street - it was fine. The location is great - 2 blocks from the subway and a short walk to the Empire State Building. Close to shopping too. In summary - if you're in New York to be out and about - stay at the thirty thirty. If you're in New York and are going to hang out in your rooms, and don't want to lift a finger.... look elsewhere

<Title>“Good hotel, Great location, Great view.”
<Content>I stayed at Thirty Thirty for three nights in February, and it was exactly what I wanted. The room was bigger than expected with a big screen tv on the wall. The bathroom had a huge shower, provided all linen needed and everything was spotlessly clean. Loved the teddy with the welcoming note - a nice touch. Reception staff were helpful with any requests we had. There is a really handy 24 hour grocery shop on the corner, about a 30 second walk from the hotel. Subway is also within a block (using back entrance to hotel) and walkable in two minutes. The view - what can I say? I couldn't have asked for better, a tip, ask for top floor (12th) and north facing! The room was really quiet which was good after a busy time sightseeing! I can't recommend this hotel highly enough and would book it in a heartbeat if I was in New York again.

<Title>“Bleak, pokey room, drab outlook, spotlessly clean!”
<Content>Our travel agent had booked through Gold Medal in March for our trip in October. We had paid extra for a Superior Room but surprise,surprise they were full and offered the only room available which of course was TINY with a bleak view. Full marks to the maids though, the room was kept spotless. Horrible manager was in the foyer telling an elderly lady who was obviously living there that they couldn't cater for her any longer! (Couldn't even be bothered to take her somewhere private!). We also heard other comments from him about the Europeans. (Think he is of the opinion that they can stick us anywhere!) He basically couldn't care less as long as they get the money. Location was fine, good walk but kept us fit!

<Title>“What a good choice the Thirty Thirty was”
<Content>Just returned from our visit to New York. This was our first visit to the USA and we were a bit apprehensive. The Hotel was in such a good spot, convenient for all the major sights. The hotel itself was clean and the staff friendly. Although we have nothing to compare to in New York the room was quite small but adequate. The room was cleaned each day and clean towels provided. The bar and restaurant were invaluable because of the weather conditions (26 inches of snow!!) Lovely bar staff and the food was good. Would stay there again.

<Title>“Comfortable Basic Rooms, Unhelpful Management”
<Content>On my first trip to New York, booked via Thomas Cook. On arrival in late evening it became obvious they were severely overbooked and / or had re-sold rooms - we were not alone, with at least another 3 couples in the same position as ourselves. After an hour or so of denying we had a booking and blaming Thomas Cook they found our booking. After another 30 mins they booked us into their sister hotel advising they would have a room for us the next day. We were treated as a major inconvenience and left to hail our own taxi with accompanying luggage to the other hotel. We had to return the next day to book into the Thirty Thirty and thus lost half a day of a 3 night visit due to this. The hotel room itself was fine and location great, but attitude of management was terrible and thus I would always find another hotel before returning here.

<Title>“Super location and cosy room”
<Content>I stayed at Thirty Thirty for four nights in January, and absolutely loved it. I'd read some mixed reviews, but decided to book it because of the good price and location. Thankfully, the hotel was a very nice place to stay, and I will certainly book a room there the next time I'm in NY. The room was a decent size, with a clean, compact shower and toilet room. The coffee-maker was great, and I loved the nice touch of providing a giant teddy bear with a note to welcome the guest! Reception staff were variable, but mostly helpful. It's a very short walk to the attractions on Fifth Avenue, and there's a handy 24 hour grocery shop just across the street. There's also an excellent, reasonably-priced Chinese restaurant a few blocks up on Fifth named "Hunan", which I ended up going to more than once. I'd requested a view and was delighted that the gilded top of the NY Life Insurance building could be seen from my window. The room was quiet, except for one night when I think demolition work was going on down the street - hardly the hotel's fault though. It's also just a short walk to the subway, only a couple of blocks away. I'd definitely recommend Thirty Thirty to anyone, and look forward to staying there again.

<Title>“Oh dear! I should have listened!!!”
<Content>There are so many mixed reviews on here but is it just sheer coincidence most are bad??? One word of advise.......if you're looking for a nice, welcoming, comfortable hassle free welcome to the big apple.....then give the 30 30 a miss!!! We travelled for 15 hours to find our room had been double booked and so the so called 'manager' tried putting us in a room that he even described himself as 'not big enough for a single japanses tourist'. It consisted of on small single bed and he said he would have a camp bed put in the room to make up for the lack of a double bed. Just what I needed after 15 hours travelling. I could go on but I only have a week off work and so I don't think I would have enough time!!! If you insist on going...good luck! If not get out while you can. One good thing though....location!!

<Title>“Not too bad”
<Content>I'd had this holiday booked for the last year and having read a lot of reviews over the last 12 months i really wasn't looking forward to staying there but i have to say that i didn't think it was that bad. Yeah I've stayed in a lot nicer but at the end of the day it was clean. I really don't know what all this "the rooms were tiny" business was coz i stayed in a standard room, 1 double bed and i found it fine. The only thing that really got to me was not having any tea making facilities in the room, as a Brit that didn't go down well, waking up and not being able to have my morning cup of tea!!!! As for the location, i don't rate it that much. If i was ever to go back (would be kicking and screaming mind) i'd go for a hotel nearer Central Park - it had the nicer places to eat and the designer shops too and generally a nicer part to stay in. Oh another tip, if you're thinking it would be great to do Time Square for New Year then think again. It's just all a big hype. I got there at 4pm and i was still 5 blocks away from the action, just stood there with nothing to do, no food, no toilet, no drink, couldn't see what was going on, wasn't allowed to leave and if you do manage to blag your way out then you're not allowed back in. All in all worst new year ever. Think i'll stick to the pubs and clubs next year!!!

<Title>“Thirty OK”
<Content>Hotel is ideally located in Midtown Manhatten. Very close to Empire State Building and short walk to Macy's and Times Square. Service was good. Our room was cleaned promtly everyday without hassles. The bathroom was the only negative point of our stay. Shower had mould that looks like it has been growing for a while. No breakfast is served which didnt bother us as there are enough deli's and coffee shops in the area to grab a quick bite. We took the Super Shuttle to and from the airport. No problems late at night walking back to hotel even though it is in the more quiet part at night. Which is good as its not as noisy. All in all not a bad place to serve as your base while in New york...if you dont mind dodgy bathrooms!

<Title>“This Group Loved it!”
<Content>First, everyone needs to be aware that there are three types of rooms at the Thirty-Thirty: standard, superior and executive. The superior rooms have about 20 more square feet than the standard for $20 - $40 more. Because of the way the building is built, some rooms have a slight curve in them reducing the square footage. (Spend the extra money and ask for superior.) A group of 10 (mostly deaf seniors) booked five rooms for 12/18/05 - 12/22/05. All rooms were superior, some with twins, some with queens. The queen rooms do have more space than the twin rooms. Yes, the hallway carpets were somewhat worn; but they were clean and so were the rooms. Yes, some of the staff was a bit reserved; but most of them were great! No one in our group had any complaint that was not taken care of immediately. One couple's closed captioning on the TV was not working - it was fixed immediately. Another room did not have a wash towel; one was brought immediately. My room didn't have a box of tissues. (who cares? I bought my own). Rooms were kept clean, towels were changed, bed were made, etc. etc. I worked for several months with Kerry in Group Sales and confirmed the reservations with the front desk 3 days beforehand. In short, we all had a wonderful time. I really did not see any basis of any of the complaints posted here UNLESS their expections were higher than they should be. RESTAURANTS: The Dallas BBQ restaurant (several locations) automatically charges a 15% after 8:30p.m. - no matter how many people are at the table. Something, my partner and I didn't notice in the fine print at the bottom of the menu until we got the bill. The service was terrible. The waiter kept pushing the alcoholic drinks. Cafe Guy & Gallard (459 Park Ave South). The food (breakfast and dinner) was good, staff was great with my group. They ate there two times for breakfast. LOCATION: Wonderful!

<Title>“Great place to stay.................”
<Content>Booking late as we did we were prepared for virtually anything. We were going to New York to fulfill a dream and hoped that the hotel would give us a comfortable base from which to explore the city. Had I read the other reviews before booking I might have not taken the risk. Need not have worried however. Arrived Christmas night at 11pm. Speedy check in, courteous staff. Rooms (we had two adjacent)small but clean, great bed, hot shower, big TV ~ who could ask for more. Good job we took travel kettle, none in room - though I gather this is not uncommon. Boxing morning left hotel at 8.30am. Wife made first purchace in Macy's at 9.00am!!! - and we stopped to look at the Empire State on the way. Brilliantly placed for 5th Avenue, Times Square and all their attractions. Close enough to go back for a siesta before venturing out again. Excellent food on site or loads of other options within walking distance. We chose to walk and grab Taxi's ~ cheap and quick. Security very high at Empire State and Liberty Island which slows things down. Americans do love a 'line'. Check out easy and they held our bags in a secure room for half a day. This is a great hotel to explore from. Basic facilities well presented. No pool, no shop, no frills, no problem. If you want more, pay more. Would go again.

<Title>“Not worth the money”
<Content>We stayed at the Hotel Thirty Thirty as part of a package deal with Expedia. We expected the rooms to be small but not as small as they were. We couldn't get a double room when we arrived even though we'd booked one. There was a pillar in the middle of our tiny room and the bathroom was mouldy, so we were moved the second night to a slightly better room. One night we were woken at 4.25am by a fight outside the door and another morning we found broken wine bottles outside the lift. The lobby looks much more promising than the rooms themselves. The pictures on both Expedia and the hotel's own website are obviously of the executive suites not the standard bedrooms. The bathroom was not slate, but old, white and ceramic. The only view we had was of another wall. With our suitcases on the floor at the end of the bed, we couldn't open the door to get out. The only good thing about the hotel was its location as it's only a minute away from the Empire State building and as such is very central. We wouldn't stay there again.

<Title>“Basic but comfortable”
<Content>This was my first trip to NY and booked this hotel on the notion that I would rather have more dollar in my pocket to spend than shed out ridiculous amounts on accommodation. On arrival I thought that the staff could have been a bit more proactive at check-in as I was standing for a while before anyone asked if they could help (they were not busy with other customers at the time). There were no staff to take my bags from me but this was not expected and not a shock. On opening the door to the room, yes it was small, tiny to be exact, but it had a bed, shower and seemed quiet so I had all I needed to have a good sleep and freshen up.I wasnt planning on staying in my room for long. There are shops to be visited after all!!! I had requested a non smoking room but there was a smell of cigarette smoke in the bathroom which seemed to linger. I think it was coming through the vent from another room. There were building works going on nearby but this did not bother me as this was no fault of the hotel and I didnt expect NY city to be a quiet place anyway. After the first night I decided that extra pillows and blanket were needed. A quick note to house keeping was left on the bed and when I got back, my request had been fulfilled. If you are like me and dont expect your behind to be wiped for you then this is the hotel for you. Overall, basic but value for money and very well located to some of the attractions such as Empire state building, Macy's and Times Square.

<Content>Hotl was simple, basic and absolutely perfect for a short stay (4 nights). This was my 5th trip to NYC and apart from the Algonquin, I wouldn't return to any of the hotels I'd stayed at before until now. For bang per buck, this is simply as good as you'll get in Manhattan. We paid Â£99/night which was very good value. Nothing fancy, just a decent hoel in a great location.

<Title>“oh dear”
<Content>after booking this hotel in Jan 2005 as a treat for ourselves all I can say is very disappointing. The rooms are small and very basic and to be honest shabby with dirty carpets, a hole in the bathroom door, blinds at the window all frayed down one side. when I walked in and saw my room I cried. I was moved to a supposed up graded room which was slightly better ie the sink in the bathroom and not in the bedroom but the decor was again shabby. The whole hotel was in desperate need of a refit, the lobby was wasted space with dirty chairs in it and on our last day we had no hot water so were unable to shower or wash. One couple left after one night, one couple had to sleep in a single room as there wasn.t a double room for them even though they'd booked one and many other people I spoke too all said the same ie that it was nothing like the brochure. The only positive thing about this hotel was its location.

<Title>“Not So Good”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for business since it looked nice on the internet and the price wasn't so bad. I usually stay in the 40-50's so, staying on 30th was the furtherst south that I have stayed. The lobby looked so nice on the internet but, when you saw it in person, looked a little tired. I thought that it looked like a "want to be W Hotel". I was a little nervous when the front desk person asked if I wanted a bathtub or shower?? I wanted a non-smoking room but, it was pretty clear that I was on a smoking floor. I also think that people "lived" on my floor, as they had stickers on their doors and were pretty loud. My room was very tiny (even for New York) and I have to be honest, I didn't sleep very well. The blankets on the bed had foam on the underside which was very uncomfortable. I ended up checking out a day early, even though I had pre-paid and took an earlier flight home...2 nights here was quite enough.

<Content>when we arrive we were greeted by the friendly porters and reception staff, checked in, and found our room. The hotel room was small but big enough to throw a few shopping bags in. The bathroom was lovely - clean and we had fresh towels every day. Our room was thoroughly cleaned every day with fresh bed sheets as well. In a fantastic location - minutes from Empire State, and 5th av shopping, and about 10 mins to Times Sq. Also not far walk to Penn Station. The staff at Zanas restaurant were wonderful and the food was fantastic! Were going to New York for a week in March in 2006 and would love to stay at 30/30 again but we couldnt resist the cheap prices of the Pennsylvania Hotel - just hope the reports aint true! Definately stay at 30/30 it was great!!

<Title>“New York New York”
<Content>The thirty thirty hotel was as described. We had a lovely room with a very comfortable double bed which is a must after walking the streets of New York all day sightseeing. It had a desk with 2 chairs and nice bathroom. The room was really clean and there was a daily maid service. Plus it was quite at night when trying to sleep. The hotel is just around the corner from the Empire State which is good because you have to go up twice to get the daytime and night time views of New York. There are plenty of places close by to eat including the normal McD's and Burgerking's. Plus a very close by starbucks. We really enjoyed our stay there. It was deffinately a holiday of a lifetime and you have to remember when visiting New York you hardly spend any time in your hotel as there is so much to do so you don't want to blow your buget on a top notch hotel so the Thirty Thirty was perfect. I hope you enjoy New York as much as we did.

Room was spacious fitted with a large TV facing the king size bed, Coffee maker, radio & Cd player bathroom also very spacious fitted with hair dryer and toiletries, towels changed daily and bed made daily. Location is fantastic and is very close to the main attractions, recommend Tasty's for breakfast, which is a stone throw away. Staff polite and helpful, both checking in and out. Would recommend the hotel if you are looking to go to New York mainly to sight see and shop and not spend all your time in the room.

<Title>“Really good budget hotel”
<Content>I was very impressed with this hotel in New York. I wanted somewhere not too expensive, well located and comfortable and hotel Thirty Thirty was perfect. The room was not huge (althought the bathroom was!)but it was clean, warm and comfortable. The location was perfect - one block from Macys,and the Empire State and 2 blocks from the subway. The only downside was that breakfast was quite expensive. well the restaurant in general wasnt very cheap. Which means you have to eat out for all three meals (not really a problem in New York!) I would definately recommend this to someone who wants convenience and comfort!

<Title>“Horrid”
<Content>Manager, Don, was the ruddest person in New York, cursing and yelling at us for no apparent reason. And there was no one to complain to because Don was the general manager.

<Title>“Don't Bother”
<Content>Don't bother with the ThirtyThirty - its completely overrated. The lobby is not as spectacular as they like to think, its even quite shabby if you look close enough. Its basically just polished concrete, but not even in a cool industrial chic kind of way. Bland. Wouldn't bother with the staff either - rude, rude, rude! You expect this in NYC but having parted with a large sum of cash you expect at least a veneer of civility. When we arrived, a half hour before check-in, we were told the room wasn't ready. An hour and a half later we finally get our room, and when we walk in the maid is still half-heartedly giving the room a once over with the Hoover and making no acknowledgement of us! Plus sides? Good beds, good shower. Its clean, basic, a place to sleep but for the money there are better. Worst thing about this place is it's own opinion of itself. Certainly not as hip as it like to be. Maybe back in the day.... PS - Location also good, but a lot of scaffolding and building going on around the hotel. Stairs up to lobby, bit cumbersome if you have prams, buggies or wheelchair. There is a wheelchair lift but this seems like a major hassle for the staff to use. One nice member of staff was an Asian gentleman who stored our baggage and arranged a cab - the only one to smile.

<Title>“Great Location.”
<Content>We arrived in NYC and checked into the hotel which we had booked online, five hours later, we checked into the Hotel Thirty-Thirty. At such short notice, we ended up paying â‚¬290 average per night, but were happy to. We were in an executive room (all they had left), it was a great size, king bed, a large tv facing the bed and another tv facing the sofa! The desk had internet access available. The bathroom was large, covered in slate tiles, and the shower was huge. Toiletries were provided, and when we tipped a little more, an extra big towel was left! The staff in reception were very friendly and accommodating and the doorman organised our trip to the airport and stored our luggage for us after we checked out. All in all, certainly a hotel I would recommend to friends and it's in an excellent location. A short walk to the Empire State or the subway. Plenty of diners and deli's nearby (I'd certainly recommend Pete's Pizza for a decent slice). The only downside was on our penultimate day. I was in the shower, my partner was in bed watching tv, he noticed a cockroach in the room. He said nothing until we checked out but neither of us noticed any others and the rooms were always thorougly cleaned.

<Title>“Great location & excellent value for money!!!!!”
<Content>We stayed at the Thirty-Thirty in September for four nights and like many others, were fearful of the reviews we had read prior to leaving for New York. It was the first time either my wife or I had been to New York so the hotel was a worry - until we arrived. The Thirty-Thirty is situated no more than a two minute walk from the Empire State, and close to Penn station (subway) which gives access to the whole of Manhattan. We were initially reserved about using the subway - but we should not have worried as it was safe and clean, security and safety were not an issue as there are Police eveywhere! We bought tickets which allowed for 24 hours use of the subway for only $7.00. Back to the hotel, the reception area and staff alike were welcoming and the room was clean and spacious enough for our needs. For us, the hotel was simply a place to sleep after shopping, eating out, and sightseeing. I don't quite understand the complaints that rooms do not offer a view - what do you expect in a city filled with multi-storey buildings? Maids cleaned the room and changed the towels etc daily, it was always clean and tidy. Our room had a tv, hairdryer, wardrobe, telephone tea & coffee making etc. The bathroom was not huge - but large enough for what you would be doing in there. The main attraction to the Hotel is the location - choose it if you want to be central to all of the major sights. If you are looking for total luxury and pampering - why are you looking at a hotel in the budget section? When we return to New york, We will have no hesitation in booking the hotel again. E-mail me if you want to know any more, or see photos of the city. Food portions in restaurants are huge!!!

<Title>“Don't get too excited!”
<Content>The thirty thirty is an initially impressive hotel in a very good location close to the Empire State Building and a short trip from most of Manhattan's places of interest. However our room let things down- it was pokey and the sleeping area was not much larger than the (admittedly quite spacious)bathroom! A few of the fixtures and fittings were worse for wear, the decor was a little tired though tasteful, the windows were a beggar to open and the view was a brick wall. Luckily we weren't in the hotel much, the communal facilities were good and the staff were pleasant. Just average overall but not enough too spoil a visit to a great city, it is a budget to intermediate hotel after all!

<Title>“Poor quality hotel”
<Content>Many bedrooms are very small, without chairs & other normal requirements. Rooms are poorly decorated and some elecrical points in very dangerous condition. Make a big fuss and insist on an upgrade to a larger room with proper seating and more space. the hotel restaurant does not appear to be run by the hotel but by an Albanian gentlemen. generally good food, very slow service (40 mins for main course) and they add 15% service charge to the bill! Not well located for main attractions of Mannhatten but taxi only $5 - 8 to Times sq

<Title>“Very disappointed with the 30/30”
<Content>My husband and I traveled to NYC for a long, much deserved weekend away, the first room we were given was a smoke filled "no smoking" room, we were quickly changed to a new room which at first glance seemed to even be a nicer room. It went down hill from there....the lamp didn't work, one window blind wouldn't go up, which quite frankly didn't matter since the only thing to see was a brick wall. The bathroom tile was grungy and clearly in need of replacing and the most disgusting of all was the fact that the bathroom door had bodily fluids on it. I had to argue with the manager to get her to clean it, needless to say we were not impressed. On the first morning we found it very uncomfortable that we had to walk around sleeping homeless people. Getting a taxi from this location proved to be a daunting task, you are better off walking a block or two then flagging for a taxi. All in all I would spend the extra money and stay in a nicer section of town next time and in a nicer hotel, this one is not it!

<Title>“Best holiday of all time!!”
<Content>I must be honest as we were flying over to JFK I was thinking of all the bad reviews I had read, and I am very pleased to say that we didnt find one fault with the Thirty Thirty hotel. As we entered the hotel we were served promtly and the staff were all very friendly. The hotel is very clean througout and the rooms were great, with a really comfy bed ( which you need at the end of a days shopping!) and a hugh bathroom. All of which is very modern. Maid service was daily so we always had fresh towels. Hotel staff also advised us on things to see and the dos and donts of the city. As for the city itself SHOP TILL YOU DROP!!!! Bloomingdales has everything all under one roof and is great we spent a fortune there. Macys which is only 5 mins walk from the ThirtyThirty is also a big department store and is fab!!! Dont forget to get your 11% off all at Macys card which you can get from the 2nd floor of Macys it really does save you loads of money. If you've won the lottery a trip down 5th avenue would be great but if you havent its still fun looking at the clothes down there and there are some shops that arent so expensive. Times square is amazing and only 15/20 mins walk from the hotel. Empire state building is only 2 mins away from hotel and looks fab at night. Central Park is a bit of a walk away so we got a cab which was only about $7 and well worth it. The zoo is a must see as it has big polar bears , penguins and seals!! I really didnt want to leave the zoo. We also did a horse and cart ride round the park which was fantastic and really romantic as my boyfriend asked me to marry him while on the cart!!!!!!!!!!! All in all we had a fantastic time and i really hope we get to go back one day. If we do the Thirty Thirty is GUAREENTED to be the place we will be staying!!!!!!!!!

<Title>“Basic yet Comfortable”
<Content>We stayed in the Thirty Thirty last year, and it's not as bad as some of the other reviews i've just read are making out...If you want to be waited on hand and foot, have tons of space and to be living it up in the lap of luxury then this hotel probably won't be suited to you. But if all you want is a quiet, clean well located hotel to rest your head each night of your visit, then this will do you perfectly. Because lets be honest...there is so much to see and do in NY you will hardly spend anytime at all in your hotel, and when you do go back there, it's only to shower/sleep/drop of your heavy shopping bags etc... Yes i'll admit, the rooms were fairly small, but if you think of how many people are crammed into Manhatten, you probably won't find many places with lots of space anwyay!!! I've visited a lot of hotels recently, good and bad ones - and i'd go back. Enjoy your stay.

<Title>“Business travelers shouldn't stay here”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel for one week. The location is ok, and the rooms were small but clean. Unfortunately the staff at the front desk were incompetent, except for one guy who was there on Sunday who was pleasant and nice. The attitude of the staff added a lot of stress to my stay (one was very rude although I was very polite to her), plus it was very noisy at night, so I was very tired most of the week. If you're in NY on business this is not the place to stay. Also, there was practically no security at this hotel- one night I came home to find a homeless person in the lobby. But if you're just looking for a cheap place to crash after a night out, then it's probably ok. Personally, I like the san carlos hotel-- it's a little more money, but the location is better and the neighborhood is much more upscale. Plus at the san carlos the front desk staff is wonderful.

<Title>“We're lovin' it!”
<Content>Four of us have just had a fab time in NY (15-20 Sep). The Thirty Thirty rocks, it's in a great midtown location (so close to the Empire State Building) and in fact much better than most average hotels in the UK. The room was a good size, clean and serviced every day. It had a great shower (roomy), big TV, safe in wardrobe - even a cuddly toy! OK, so it's not the plushest of hotels and they don't carry your bags to your room for you but we'd rather save the Â£Â£Â£'s and have more to spend on good times! We recommend that you try out as many places to eat as possible. Cafe 28 on 5th Ave was fab for breakfast - with something for everyone. We didn't want to leave and if we ever get the chance to go back, the Thirty Thirty is at the top of our list!

<Title>“Absolutely Fantastic”
<Content>I've read some of the reviews on this site, and maybe we stayed in a different type of room, or maybe our expectations where not as sky high as these other people, but this hotel was fantastic. Our room was massive, too much space! We had two double beds, although they were not needed. The bathroom was also very big, a huge shower area too! The staff on the desk downstairs were very helpful as I had lost my bags! Overall this hotel was great, it was extremely good value for money and it was far better than the hotel I stayed in later on the trip which was $300-$400 dollars a night. GO FOR IT!!!

<Title>“a small apple in the big apple”
<Content>Stayed at Thirty Thirty for four nights in mid-August. The location is actually perfect for us, as we like walking, and didn't want to be right in the hustle and bustle, but near to it. We were as close to lower Manhattan as we were to Times Square. We walked about 7 miles a day, so it was no problem. The hotel is clean, but sparse. If you truly need customer service, you should not come here; if you need a clean room (though rather small) with good beds (though rather small), with a good bathroom (though rather small), then this place will do fine. It's a couple of blocks from the subway, and there are delis nearby on every corner. Not much furniture in the room, but the TV worked fine. Our small room (10th floor) did have a direct-on view of the Empire State Building. That was cool. Only a couple of blocks away is Broadway, and in the other direction 3rd and 2nd Avenue, filled with restaurants, shops and movie theaters. Save a couple of bucks, and stay here.

<Title>“Very good for what it is”
<Content>My boyfriend made the reservations and we had no trouble checking in, as we called beforehand to let them know that we were going to be arriving late. The only problem we encountered was that while we had reserved a double non-smoking room, we had to stay on the smoking floor. The room therefore stank of cigarette smoke and as it was July in NYC, there was no way the window was going to open and let out all of that nice, strong a/c. Overall, our experience was good. It is a very fair deal for what you pay for and it's clean. One of the big problems with finding a hotel in NYC is that we didn't want to spend $300/night and we wanted something clean, safe and with working a/c. This hotel fit the bill perfectly. I would highly recommend it for other travellers on a budget.

<Title>“NEVER AGAIN!!”
<Content>I read the reviews before I made reservations and saw that they were mixed. But I decided to take the chance. I wish I never took the chance. The rooms are okay, very, very small. There is barely a foot between the bed and the wall on each side. The tv is so high up in the corner of the room it is impossible to watch. The shower head was so high up as well and the shower drainage was awful. The service was HORRIBLE. We had to call numerous times for a rollaway bed and towels. We came back one day and found out that our room had never been cleaned. When I complained to the front desk, her response was that I was giving her too much attitude. I couldn't believe it. We checked out early and went across the street to the Carlton. What a hotel! The service was excellent and the rooms were spacious. Spend the extra few dollars and go across the street!!!

<Title>“Excellent value for money”
<Content>I stayed here with two friends to celebrate my birthday on July 21st for three nights. We had the Deluxe Executive with two Queens which cost about Â£150.00 per night. The room was very large and clean with a sofa and desk and lots of room for us all to get ready. The bathroom was gorgeous with black slate tiles and a good shower. We had clean towels for all three of us everyday although our bin didn't get emptied. Most importantly was the air con which was an absolute godsend as it was a very hot weekend. There isn't a fridge but the staff were happy to provide an ice bucket when asked and ice is available on the 10th floor. They also provided an iron and ironing board when asked and arranged a car to the aiport. There is no restaurant but plently of Deli's nearby. Also a great bar called Houstons on Park Ave. The great thing is the location as the hotel is near nowhere specifically which means its nice and quiet but its possible to get everywhere really easily. Union Square is a 20 min walk and Greenwich Village is a 30 min walk away. The subway is nearby and a cab is only $5 - $6 to get up to Central Park and $8 to get to the Meatpacking District. Room 201 is a great room and although it faces the street it's really quiet. Book via Expedia and you can specify what room you want ie view, quiet etc. Free Time Outs are provided at the desk. Book restaurants and book tables at clubs the day before to avoid disappointment. I would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Great place!”
<Content>After reading many reviews on this forum we stayed one night at 30-30 last Dec. It was much much better than we expected and wanted to thank ppl who wrote reviews about this place and wanted to add to the group. Of course it was a small room, no view. But was clean, comfortable and was a nice place to crash after siteseeing. The staff was polite and its located not too far from all attractions. We stayed 2 nights in NY but 30-30 was only available one night. So we took a chance and stayed at hotel Pennsylvania. Big Mistake!! Sure its right there near all attractions...but the room ----- (althought bigger than 30-30), seemed unclean (carpet, furniture, even bed linen). When I visit again, I will definitely stay at 30-30 although not as close as Hotel Penn to attraction. I had peace of mind there and it was great! Hoep this is helpful to someone trying to decide where to stay.

<Title>“Economical hotel - great for parties of 5”
<Content>June 26 - July 3 ROOM: Myself and 4 galpals stayed in a deluxe executive room, room 503. It was great because hotels that sleep 5 people in one room is extremely difficult to come by in New York. The room photographed really well - I must commend the interior decorator because it is obvious they were working on a budget. Don't expect bedskirts or room service, the latter which is advertised on the hotel's website. The beds were comfortable, not plush but not lumpy either - I have a bad back so this was important to me. Our room was a decent size and served its purpose which was sleep! However, the washroom was tiny fitting only one person at a time. We made good use of the lobby washroom. Initially we asked if we could switch to a room with a larger washroom and they showed us a room on the 2nd floor. Although the washroom was gorgeous with slate colored tiles, the room was smaller, the sofabed looked manky, and the windows opened up to a dirty black top roof. We decided to stay where we were. Note: There is no bar fridge. There is a safe which was bolted to the closet shelf but the closet shelf itself wasn't bolted down. LOCATION: it is on the edge of downtown. We felt safe walking down 30 St. but any more south and it was a bit sketchy. There are 2 24hr delis within a block or 2 where you can get cheap breakfast, pastries, snack foods, fresh cut up fruit and drinks. You'll have to walk/subway/cab it to get anywhere happening. The upside is that the hotel was only 2-3 blocks from 2 different subway lines and because it's away from all the nightclubs/broadway/restaurants/shopping, it was really quiet. SERVICE: the staff were friendly and down to earth - most likely because we were'nt expecting to be waited on hand and foot. Everytime we asked them anything they were quite accomodating.

<Content>We booked this hotel at a reasonable price for its location. It is in the heart of midtown Manhattan, four blocks from Empire State building. The hotel was clean, which is very important to me, and it was comfortable as well. The only downside is that the rooms are small, just enough space for 2 beds and a dresser, although the bathroom was a good size. If you are a budget traveler and dont want to risk cleaniness and location, this hotel is your choice. I had a great first time in New York, I would not be suprised if I come back to the Thirty Thirty.

<Title>“run-down rooms+rude "service"”
<Content>We stayed in New York in early June and had a great time in spite of our very unsatisfactory Hotel experience. As mentioned in other reviews has the Hotel problems honoring and locating existing reservations. Our reservation was made by our travel agent and was paid for in full months in advance. At check-in the reservation couldn't be found, it took over an hour and thereafter we were given single rooms even though the reservations were for doubles. It took us numerous phone calls between the uncooperative hotel management and the booking agency to get us into rooms that could accommodate 2. These rooms are no typical double room, they only have 2 tiny single beds with youth hotel sheets and mattress. Don't be fooled by the pictures on the hotel website. These are NOT the rooms they rent. The the rooms (we had 4 total) that I saw walking down the halls are all very small, not renovated and run down. Our room came with a stove and sink, but no closet. To add to the already negative experience comes: condoms in the hallway and no maid service, we ran out of toilet paper and shampoo! Our trip was partially for business, the advertised in-room high-speed Internet does NOT exist. The hotel openly admits that there is no working Intent access in the room and you're directed to the expensive Internet station in the hall. So if you can, don't stay here, there are better options in New York!

<Title>“A decent hotel with a good location”
<Content>I stayed at the Thirty Thirty with my husband for a week in Apr. 2003 for my 40th birthday. We chose it because he had seen it while there on a business trip the year before and had admired its minimalist lobby. We had a standard room with a double bed. It was small but clean and quiet. The bed was fine, the bedding clean and in good condition. The bathroom was clean too and there were enough towels and they weren't threadbare. Ohter guests were pleasant, we didn't have a problem with drunks in the corridor, rowdies or parties in rooms. My only complaint would be that the room was overheated. We couldn't get the heating turned off so opened the windows instead. As we were on a high floor that didn't let in too much noise. The staff were competent. We didn't have any unusual demands and only asked for help once to locate a church with a lovely garden we had seen while walking in the area but couldn't find again. The front desk clerk located it for us. The best part of the hotel was its location. We walked everywhere, to Macy's, to the Empire State Building, to the NY Public Library, to Scandinavia House, to Times Square and back late at night, to restaurants. There was a subway stop nearby that we used late at night too, without feeling nervous. The area a couple of blocks east didn't look so good late at night but the area to the west was fine. I would stay again.

<Title>“Not as bad as some of the reviews say”
<Content>Stay - Friday 3rd June 2005 - Monday 6th June 2005 After reading the reoprts on this website I was a little concerned about our proposed stay at the Thirty Thirty. I am however pleased to report that we were satisfied with the accomodation provided and would probably stay there again should we return to New York and want comfortable but basic accomodation. The Hotel doesn't look much from the outside and the reception is pretty basic yet clean. We had a standard room which consisted of a queen sized bed, TV, shower, wc and sink. The room was quite small but sufficient for our needs as we spent very little time in the room. The room and corridors at the Hotel were clean and the facilities provided were in a good condition. Our room had an aircon/heating facility but this wasn't really required, eventhough the temp outside was about 92 degrees (the benefit of being surrounded by tall buildings is that there is never any direct sunlight in your room!) The bar/restaurant downstairs was handy for a pre evening drink and the food looked very good. The Hotel is in a very handy location for the subway and walking distance to Empire State Buildings and Maceys. It is not ideal for those wishing to concentrate their time in Times Square/Theatre district though. Would recommned the Grayline bus tours if you want to see as much as possible in a short space of time and also the bar/restaurant in Battery Park for great food and fantastic location looking over the Hudson with views of the Statue of Liberty.

It was hard to watch the TV in bed 'cos it was too high. The room.bathroom were very clean and housekeeping was fine. The location is great for the Empire State Building and Macy's. The subway is very close and there are plenty of eating places nearby (the deli across the street was good for a quick snack). Overall, the room is tiny, but if you just want a base it is fine.

<Title>“Worst front-desk service ever experienced”
<Content>Shocking service. Arrived to be told they didn't have the 2 twin-bedded rooms that we'd booked as 'someone else was in them'. Offered a double bed but this was not suitable for us. Following 20 minutes of argument, they finally offered 2 lower standard rooms. When we negotiated a price acceptable to us, we checked in, only to find that one of the rooms had not been prepared - no bedding, dirty. The other room had no towels, and neither safe was working. It took 3 calls to housekeeping to get this fixed, then when the first room was finally ready we found the bathroom door locked! On three occasions over the weekend our room key cards did not work, and to cap it all off my credit card was charged twice for the rooms. The rooms themselves (once cleaned) were absolutely fine, and we had no further problems, but with so many hotels to choose from I wouldn't recommend this one.

<Title>“Fantastic location!”
<Content>Having read all the reviews on the site for this hotel I arrived panicing that we'd made a really big mistake. However, I was totally wrong! The hotel is in a fantastic location in midtown, only 1 block from the subway. Its clean and tidy and fair enough the rooms arent huge, but you wont be in them for long anyway. Our room was cleaned everyday (including the bank holiday) and we had clean towels provided everyday too. Its right in the thick of NY and for the price we paid I'd definately go back there again. Dont bother getting any wine in Zana's tho - vile!

<Title>“If all you want is a decent bed”
<Content>I got one of the last rooms available, a single with one twin bed. There was no desk, only a small bedside table and the bed, which did have a decent matress. The bathroom is all tile, with the shower, toilette and a sink all in the same room -- yes, the shower head just sticking out of the wall. And the sink was so small I couldn't keep the water from getting on the floor when washing my face. But, that must be better than some, since there are shared bathrooms on the same hall. It was quiet enough I got a good night's sleep, but I won't be going back.

<Title>“Disappointment”
<Content>We stayed at thirty thirty for 8 nights in September 2004. We would not recommend this otel. I don't know the other rooms but our room was small and not very clean. Washbasin was not in the bathroom, it was near by bed in the room. The one part of window near air conditioner was broken and it was closed by wooden plate. All noise from the street are inside the room even we stayed top floor. When we informed staff, they just renailed wooden plate. When I try to arrange a shuttle to aiport from reception desk, they request almost double price. I made a reservation by myself via mobile phone. But, location is good, Empire State building is very close.

<Title>“Can only recommend the 30/30”
<Content>We stayed at the 30/30 with 2 persons in June 2004 and had a great time. Requested a room on a higher floor during booking (via expedia), which we got without problems. The room even had a small kitchen and seemed to be recently renovated, very clean. Housekeeping did a good job. Location is excellent, subway station only two blocks away. Empire State building is easy to reach by foot. Staff was friendly and organised our ride back to the airport. I have absolutely no negative things to say about the 30/30 and can only recommend it!

<Title>“Thirty Thirty not reliable”
<Content>We've just come back from New York. We booked the Thirty Thirty hotel with a company called DialAFlight and it was a package deal. We were supposed to be staying here for 3 nights. We arrived at approx 4.30pm Friday 6th May 2005 at the Thirty Thirty to be told (after a 9 hour flight) that the travel company had overbooked the reservations and that we would have to go to another hotel. The Thirty Thirty did organise another hotel for us but told us to go outside and flag a cab down and didnt even give us the correct address. WE couldnt get a cab so we went back to the manager and told him the least he could do was order us a cab. Eventually he went outside himself and got us a cab!! But we had to pay!! We were really annoyed because we had planned our holiday around mid town Manhatten and ended up on Broadway. The only nice thing was that the hotel we eventually ended up in was much nicer than the Thirty Thirty. They upgraded us to the Penthouse suite on the first day and then we had a standard room the rest of our stay. But I am still annoyed at the treatment we had at first. For anyone wishing to stay in a lovely hotel with pleasant surroundings, great rooms, excellent service from the hotel staff the hotel we stayed in was called On The Avenue, 77th Street, Broadway. Absolutely fabulous. Rooms very clean, plush duvets and pillows/bedding etc. Pianist plays in the lobby few nights a week and the hotel staff will book you a posh cab to take you to the airport on your departure. Take advantage of it, you get a Town Taxi (not yellow cab) for the same price and its a smooth (air conditioned) journey back in a Merc or Limo!!! I hope this helps people and if they want more info on New York feel free to mail me. buckles123@tiscali.co.uk

<Title>“Excellent value in a great location”
<Content>We stayed at Thirty Thirty for 9 nights during the early summer of 2004, and found it to be excellent value for money. Finding a reasonably priced in NY at this time of the year seemed tricky, but after surfing the web we booked at the hotel's own website (early spring) and got a great deal of USD 119 per night for a standard room. The hotel is situated only a couple of minutes walk from Empire State building and you can walk to virtually any of the sights you might want to visit in Manhattan. The room was smallish, but definitely served the purpose of somewhere to rest after a long day out on town. It was very clean, had sparse but stylish decor and the bathroom was spacious and clean. There was no view as we faced the back yard, but we appreciated the complete lack of noise from traffic and saw enough of beautiful views during our excursions in the daytime. This is the place you should stay in if you want a nice and clean place to sleep in, but rather spend your money on shopping and seeing all the great attractions NY offers. No one will carry your bags, but I am very happy to do that myself when the staff is friendly and efficient at checking you in/out of your room.

<Title>“Maybe we were unlucky!”
<Content>First impressions were great, contemporary. Location great, staff very helpful. Sadly though the rooms were functional, most things were broken, the room not very clean, we had a constant stream of small red spiders and beetle type bugs in our room which came out at night and particularly liked crawling on your bed! The room was also very dark with no central light, just one lamp, with an extrememly dark carpet, the room was quite depressing, which was a shame as the rest of the hotel was lovely, maybe we were unlucky with our room, don't have room 1217!

<Title>“The Great Escape!!”
<Content>We booked to stay here for three nights at the end of April and after reading the other reviews felt a little apprehensive. We emailed the hotel to confirm our booking as we had read a lot of people had encountered booking problems. After a couple of confused replies from the hotel we received confirmation. On arrival we were told (along with a number of other parties) that due to them being double booked for the length of our stay we were being transferred to another, more central hotel. The staff on reception were quite frosty and made us feel quite uncomfortable when we asked questions about our new hotel. We were given the taxi fare to the new hotel but it was not as they described 'more central' it was in fact quite a few blocks in the opposite direction! From our limited time in the hotel the only conclusion we can come to is that we had a lucky escape.

<Title>“no smoking rooms availible”
<Content>after staying at the hotel in april i was happy with the room and service of the hotel.for a budget hotel it was better than i expected.the major downside of the hotel was no smoking rooms availible.as new york is a non smoking city it would have been nice to not stand in the street when wanting the odd smoke while in the hotel.there must of been alot of smokers in the hotel that week as every time i went past the entrance there was a gang of smokers having a last smoke before going back to they rooms.as hotel rooms are the only inside place you can smoke in new york the hotel should say when booking that smokers are not catered for. it was a shame because the hotel apart from that was good.i would not stay here again unless i gave up smoking!

<Title>“Bargain hotel, we would stay here again.”
<Content>We stayed at the Thirty Thirty for 10 nights in March, like other trip advisor users we were a little nervous after reading the reviews but we found the hotel to be clean and pretty much like their website; but all hotel websites show the best rooms and make things look better than in reality. Fresh toiletries and towels were placed in our room every day except for one and when we let reception know they were delivered within 5 minutes. Every member of staff we spoke to was helpful and polite. The location was ideal. Most of the places we wanted to visit were within walking distance and the area felt safe late at night. 28th St station was close by and there were plenty of places to get cheap food. We ate in Zanas one night when we couldn't be bothered doing any more walking (bring comfortable shoes) but the bill totalled over $110 for a 2 course meal and bottle of wine for two so we went to cheaper places on other nights. On the last two mornings the people in the room next to us left their dogs unsupervised and we were woken by the sound of howling, (a pet friendly hotel but not pet friendly dog owners). The hotel staff tried to sort this out but hadn't been able to by the time we left. Next time we stay we will request to be away from rooms with pets in!

<Title>“Enjoyed my stay at Thirty Thirty”
<Content>Thirty Thirty is in a good location, 2 blocks from 28th street metro. Smart presentation, adequate facilities - if you don't intend to spend too much time in your room. Internet access cost $1 for 5 mins which is good value. Would have been nice if the en-suite contained a bath to relax fully. As the room compared favourably with others that I have stayed in, the lack of Tea and coffee facilities seemed a shame for someone who wants to stay awake 24/7 !

<Title>“Liked It”
<Content>We stayed in a twin bedded room at thirty thirty hotel. Room was spacious & clean with a nice large bathroom with large shower cubicle & plenty storage/shelf space. The room was cleaned every day & the bedding changed regularly which was good. The view from outside the windows was of an office block which wasn't ideal but your not in the room that long i suppose. It was warm in the hotel room on an evening/through the night and the air con was VERY noisy which made it impossible to sleep with it on! the hotel has a small bar/restaurant attached to it which was good and was reasonably priced - food was nice and razmapoliton cocktails even better. Hotel was in ok location, you can walk to Times Square, Macy's and even central park if you're feeling fit. personally, i would have preferred to be more in times square location, will def stay nearer there next time i go. all in all hotel was good, you are on room only basis, maybe a bed & brekkie would be better but hey you cant have it all. There didnt appear to be that many places that did brekfast outside unless you're into USA style brekkie

<Title>“i heart NY”
<Content>i stayed here with my best friend for 3nights as a present for both our 18th birthdays. the location is brilliant, about 5mins away from empire state building. we arrived at the hotel at 2pm. we were really excited about seeing everything as it was our first trip to NY. check in wasnt til 3 so they kept our bags so we could walk around for an hour. we went to a starbucks and looked at the empire state building and got really excited that the steam coming up from the street that we see on tv all the time is actually there. when we went back to the hotel to check in at 3pm our room still wasnt ready which was a bit annoying because we had been on the plane from dublin and wanted to get washed and changed clothes so we could go sight seeing. we went out for another walk and our room was ready when we got back to the hotel at 3.30pm. we were on the top floor in room 1201 which had 2 single beds and the best view of the empire state building. it was so amazing, we had to fight over the bed next to the window, i didnt get it because i had the window seat on the plane. the bathroom was also nice with a really big shower. it smelt a bit like food at times, i guess there were people on our floor cooking or something, it was really disgusting but we were never really in our room for a long time as there was too much to do. we got shampoo, conditioner, shower gel body lotion and soap and white towels and face cloths. the beds got made everyday when we were out, we left our money and passports in the safe, but all our shopping and cases were lying around the room and nothing was moved. there was a closet at the door with shelves and a smaller one beside my bed with the safe in it. we didnt use them as we were only staying for 4days we just kept our clothes in our cases. the reception area was really nice and bright with some seats, payphones and internet access. when you go in the door from the street there are a few steps before you get to reception which was a bit annoying because we had heavy cases and nobody came to help us lift them. you need a credit card when you check in which we didnt have so they took $50 off us which we got back when we checked out. we checked out early at about 7am on the last day as we had to leave for the airport at 2.30pm and didnt want to waste anytime coming back to the hotel at check out time. they kept our cases for us again so we could pick them up before we left. we were quite worried about getting a taxi to the airport as although there is a flat fare of $45 from jfk to manhattan it is charged by the meter to the airport. the hotel called the bus service to pick us up instead which was only $21 each, which you pay to the hotel and they give you a ticket. we didnt eat in the hotel restaurant, we didnt really have time to eat at all while we were in NY. overall this hotel was really good. i love new york so much we are planning to go back at christmas and i would definately stay here again. its really clean and the staff were quite friendly. New York is fantastic, the best place ever, even better than i imagined, i cant wait to go back there and the location and price of the thirty thirty is brilliant! email me if you need any more info

<Title>“Spot on!!”
<Content>For a budget hotel in a central location you cant beat the Thirty Thirty. Due to the mixed reviews, as im sure were many others, I was a little anxious about my stay here, but I needn't have been. A week before we were due to go I e-mailed the hotel to confirm our reservation, they had us down for a twin room - but with one queen sized bed, I asked if we could have a room with two singles, and a few days later they got back to me and advised me that they would change it, but to make sure we mentioned it upon check in. This we did and two beds is what we got. No problem! We were in a standard twin room on the 5th floor (room 505). It looked exactly as the pictures on the hotel web site. Althought the rooms arent enormous they are big enough to dump your suitcase while you go see the sights. The beds were comfortable and house keeping was efficient. The staff were all as helpful and polite as they could be, even when checking out at 5am!! The en-suite was quite contemporary, the shower cubicle large and fully tiled. No bath, but didn't have time to soak with all those sights to see! As for noise, dirty carpets, bugs etc. as on other reviews, we didnt see any sign of these. (Great little deli on the corner opposite E30th - Miss Ks, v. friendly, good food, cheap beer!! )What more could you ask for.

<Title>“great location, great hotel”
<Content>After booking this hotel as part of a package, I was really worried when I read very negative reviews of it. Realising that you get what you pay for, I contacted the hotel directly and organised an upgrade from a 'standard double' to a 'premium twin room'. We had a great room, and I didn't mind paying the $50 a night upgrade fee, it was well worth it. We had 2 queen sized beds, a comfy sofa, large tv and a lovely bathroom. Everything was clean and well looked after. The staff were friendly and helpful (dealing quickly with any problems/requests) and made the whole experience very pleasant. The location of the hotel is fab for walking up or down town and the subway is a couple of blocks away. Great place to stay and I will definitely stay there next time. If you have any doubts, email the general manager who is more than happy to help out.

<Title>“Wrong Key Right Price”
<Content>This is a "budget" hotel based in mid-town Manhattan, which means you are well placed for walking . Gr8 view of the Empire State Building from room. 5 minute walk to ESB and Macy's. The room basic yet clean. Bathroom had excellent shower and good range of toiletries. Smart Restraunt/Bar incorporated into hotel building has wide breakfast menu and Happy Hour period during early evening. Requested a double yet got allocated two singles. To be fair the Web agents offered no guarantees on this. Service: + Had a problem with the safe and had a maintenance guy come up and fix it within 5 minutes - Checked in late due to delay with flight. Check-in clerk issued us with the wrong key and we ended up intruding on other guests. Clerk was suitably apologetic tho.

Room was not huge, but clean and warm with a great shower. Maid service and fresh towels daily. All staff were friendly and helpful. Location great. Not a huge amount of facilities but we were out from early to late every day so it was no probelm for us. If you are looking for a moderately priced place in NYC this fits the bill.

<Content>My husband and I were transferred here after Christmas 2004 when our reservation at the Carlton Hotel was bumped due to plumbing problems. We were pretty disappointed in this tiny, GRAY room, but the bathroom almost made up for it. It had new fixtures, the walls and floors were covered with slate tiles, and it was very large. It was a little dark though. (Actually, cavelike.) We can't complain much, as the Carlton paid for this room. I don't know what the rest of the rooms at the Thirty-thirty look like, but this room is in stark constrast the the hotel's modern, spacious lobby.

<Title>“Not recommended. There are better places, with similar low fares.”
<Content>Had to stay there for around 3 weeks. This hotel has at least 4 types of rooms - starting with some old tiny holes that look like the kind of lodging if you're an illegal immigrent or a poor student. I stayed in one of these "temp rooms", so they've called it, for one night. The next level had a decent carpeting and a nice bathroom. The staff even fixed the sink after 15 minutes (the water didn't go through). Still - no tables, no chairs. More channels on the TV though... The final destination was a double room (with 2 double beds) which I shared with a co-worker. If you get to get this room, then bless your luck and go there. Staff was young, and 3 of our co-workers had all sort of billing problems, which may, in part, be attributed to all the room and credit-card changes, but only up to a certain point. The main advantage of the place is the gym - which is actually outside the hotel. The guys got a pass to the "synnergy" (hope I remember the name right...) gym, 2 blocks away, which is fully equipped. To sum up - even for the low fare, you can find IMHO better alternatives such as the red roof or even the clarion, in the same neighborhood.

<Content>i have my reservations when i booked for this hotel and after reading the reviews. but, let me tell ya, its a great place to stay within a good budget at a great location. yes, front desk can get a bit grouchy but who is not in NYC. the housekeepers are extremely nice and i got my requests fulfilled everytime. i have been staying in this hotel for three consecutive weeks albeit the weekends. i love it and i would definitely go back there the next time i m in nyc. i have my share of the rooms and if you find some of the floors a bit stinky, that's because there are long-term rentals in there and they cook. so ask for another floor. otherwise, bedroom is just nice, the NY size, and bathroom is clean with great showers, big tv with a comfortable bed and huge windows. don't complain if you are planning to pay within US$85 - US$99, unless you are willing to fork out more or stay far out of Manhattan.

The reception area was very nice and so were the staff,very friendly and very helpful,organised anything we wanted,nothing was a hassel for us or for them. Next door to the hotel is zana a very nice restaurant where you can eat breakfast,lunch and dinner, they also serve tea,coffee,soft drinks and alcohol. There are other restaurants in the area like english or italian or even cuban. There are also Mcdonadls area. The hotel is in a very good location to Bloomingdales, Macys, Times sq and Central park. Taxis are cheap enough if wanted. I'd say the christmas period is the best time to go. I wouldn't even call this hotel a budget one, everything was to our satisfaction. Book it, Pack it and ---- off to the thirty thirty in NYC....you won't be dissapointed!!!!

We arrived at Thirty Thirty, exhausted, Feb 2004, and were told that our booked room was no longer available. There were some others in the lobby with the same complaint. We were told we could go to another Hotel (Holiday Inn Wall St) but we were so dissappointed. Exhausted, we had to find another place to stay. BUT - I must say, the Hotel lobby looked great. Very modern and clean. Staff were polite. And the Hotel was in an excellent location for tourists. We're visiting NY this year again. Is it worth risking a booking again Thirty Thirty????

<Title>“What do you expect!”
<Content>What do you expect! This is a budget hotel - I stayed there between 15th - 23rd Jan in a Superior double room with my partner. The cost worked out at about ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½50 per night each, which is cheap for a hotel in the middle of New York. The room size was absolutely fine, it was actually L shaped and there was plenty of room to get round the bed plus an extra corner with a desk, TV and room for suitcases. The carpet was a dark colour which my partner was a bit suspicious of given that it could have been hiding dirt! But it was fine. The bathroom was a generous size, had a hairdryer and was perfectly clean. It was white tiles rather than the natural stone ones shown in the pic on the website. The staff were very friendly, and when our flight was delayed due to snow they offered us our same room back at $99 for the night (without prompting). They also phoned the airline for us to get an update on our flight time. The hotel will organise a car to the airport - the taxis don't do flat rate fares to the airport, only from the airport ($45 from JFK). We took the organised car which was $60 to JFK, because we didn't want to take a metered fare given the snow conditions could have held us up. I suspect that there are cheaper flat rate cars to take - check out the adverts in the back of the magazines sitting on front desk. The foyer is just as seen on the website - trendy mosaic tiles with minimal furniture. This is a fairly no frills hotel, there isn't a restaurant in the lobby or anything like that, however there is a restaurant right next door to the hotel that you can access through the hotel that does a very nice breakfast (whatever you want... eggs, pancakes, bagels etc). We stayed in room 1215, which had no view because it looked straight onto another building, but there was zero traffic noise so we could have the windows open with no trouble. I suspect it is slightly pot-luck whether or not you like this hotel depending on which room you get, but ours was fine. We decided on a superior room because I could see from the photo on the website that the standard rooms are indeed tiny. It's not that much more to upgrade so I'd recommend doing that if you're worried about space.

<Title>“really good!”
<Content>After reading some reviews here I felt rather apprehensive about being booked into the 'Thirty Thirty'. To my delight my room was excellent! It was spacious, clean, really quiet, and the windows reached from the ceiling nearly all the way down to the floor. It also had a nice large screen TV, and the bed was really comfortable. I've stayed in hotels in Europe that were more expensive but no way near as good as the Thirty Thirty. The location was great. I could walk within minutes to see all of the famous sites. When I'm next in NY I will be definitely booking into the Thirty Thirty. michaelg in Nottingham.

<Title>“No complaints from us”
<Content>I was in a party of two couples from December 4 - 9 December and for a few months before we left for NY I was getting concerned about the number of negative feedback the hotel was getting. I even emailed the hotel a week before we were due to fly to make sure they had our names which were made through a travel agent - I received an email back confirming our reservation. When we got there we didn't have one complaint. The room was large enough for us (although girls not if you are bringing back lots of shopping!), shower was great and the bed was comfortable. The hotel staff were friendly even when we lost one of our door keys, they just gave us a new one.The hotel is in a great location with a good cafe/bar at the entrance. Okay, so it is not a top notch hotel, but it served it's purpose for us, we were out all day and only came back to sleep there. I suppose the only complaint we would have seeing as we are British is that there are no drink making facilities in the room!

<Title>“DO NOT stay here - you've been warned!”
<Content>We stayed here over christmas largely because most places were booked out, also it seemed like a good location and the reviews here seemed mixed but generally ok.... Upon arriving we found the location to be the only good thing about Thirty Thirty! We were assured by the travel agent that our room would have two double beds (we upgraded to 'executive room' for this). When we arrived the hotel informed us that they didnt have rooms with two double beds, despite their room 'photo' on expedia showing two double beds! So we had no choice but to settle for two single beds in a small dingy room with NO MAIN LIGHT. A floor lamp barely light the room so it was permanently in a state of semi-darkness! The shower didnt work properly although it was fixed within an hour of reporting. We moved from this poor excuse of a room on our second day because we saw two cockroaches crawling along the wall by our beds. We were moved to a room with three dogs and two cats for neighbours (a pet friendly hotel is fine, but the pets seemed to be kept at one corner of the tenth floor) The area reeked of pets and there was a soundtrack of constant barking. Our third and final room was better but maybe we just felt a sense of relief as the only thing not working properly was the window (it wouldnt stay open). Throughout these room changes, despite us being polite and respectful, the staff were frosty and seemed put out that we wanted to move rooms due to an unwanted third and fourth guest (cockroach 1 & 2). Like the previous reviewer, we got a taxi back to the airport as the hotel taxi was $15 more. Yes, the hotel is four blocks from ESB & Macys but there are plenty of other hotels in the same area. Please please, do not be fooled by nice pictures of the hotel lobby (it is nice, but that's the only thing that is). I would NOT recommend staying here at all. Unless of course, you like bugs.

<Title>“One of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at !!”
<Content>We have just returned from a weekend to New York, staying at the Thirty Thirty hotel, which I am very disappointed to say, was one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at !! Our room was so dark and dingy, it was hard to tell if it was daylight yet. The safe kept getting stuck, so everytime we needed anything from it we had to wait 30mins for maintenance to come. The reception were very helpful but we would strongly recommend getting your own taxi for journey back to airport as the hotel price was $10 more !!!!

<Title>“Promises Not Kept”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel over Thanksgiving and for the most part it was ok. The room was huge, which is a good problem to have for New York City. The location was pretty much within walking distance of all the major attractions. That is all the good news. The bad news is that I booked this on the internet and the site I used indicated that I would have a view of the city. My room actually faced the roof. I would have a refrigerator. I was told the only way to get a refrigerator was to pay $10. I was told the room had a desk and two phones. The room had no desk and one phone. I was told it had a tub when all it had was a shower. I did consult the front desk about this issue and was told that it was not their problem, that sometimes some of the booking sites do this to get business. I wrote to the hotel regarding this issue and no response within 30 days. If what you are promised and that you do not have a problem with what you receive then this hotel is not a problem. If you have a problem with this, then I suggest you stay elsewhere.

<Title>“Fantastic”
<Content>Having read mixed reviews we were slightly concerned, but the hotel was great, the staff were helpful, the room was very spacious and the location was fantastic. I couldn't believe it on the first night when we turned the first corner and there was the Empire State looming over us. It was a 6 minute walk to the Empire State and about 15 minutes to Macy's. The accomodation was fairly basic, but good value for money, and we would definitely book there again.

<Title>“Don't worry!!”
<Content>We spent 3 nights at the Thirty Thirty at the end of November & thoroughly enjoyed it. I must admit I read the reviews after booking & worried as I had booked the trip as a birthday surprise for my partner but there was nothing to worry about. We had a deluxe room on the 11th floor which was very quiet, clean, warm & comfortable. The location of this hotel is perfect for sight seeing. I would recommend this hotel - the staff were friendly & helpful - Having read the reviews before I went - I was surprised I never heard anyone complaining while I was there!!

<Title>“Nothing to worry about!”
<Content>Ok, so there's lots of bad reviews, but the place is a budget hotel! The room didn't have lots of room, but ample for the 2 of us for the little time we spent in the room. No tea and coffee in the room, but there's a 24 hour deli on the corner of Madison and west 30th for late night coffee (and chocolate fudge cake) and 3 doors up Madison there's a deli called Tasty which does better coffee and great breakfast selections. Hotel has fantastic location in between subway stations and round the corner (sort of) from Empire States. Took 10 mins to walk from hotel to macy's. Yes, the hotel has permanent guests, but that doesn't detract from it at all. It's clean and tidy, with fresh towels and bed made everyday. Staff were very helpful asking for extra towels or to borrow an iron. Yes, the sink was in the bedroom but that meant i could put make up on without having a steamed up mirror from the shower! Would definitely go there again if i wanted a budget hotel!

<Title>“Excellent Hotel”
<Content>Oh my God I was so worried after having read all the reviews about Hotel Thirty Thirty before I left for my trip to New York. I managed to get a last minute deal for me and my friend leaving on 15.12.04 to 18.12.04. When I got to the hotel all the staff were very helpful, the room was very basic but then what did I expect after getting such a bargain!! Lovely sized bathroom, very clean, comfortable beds. This was all I needed seeing as we only spent approximately 5 hours a night in the room, would definately recommend and stay there again!!

<Title>“pleasantly suprised, clean and neat”
<Content>Our tour group was booked at 30 -30 at last minute since our Hotel (Mayflower) is being torn down. I read the negative reviews. The little single room I had was immaculate but small and adequate. The blanket had a top sheet on it already. (I always request an extra flat sheet to put over blanket) The housekeeper introduced herself (Rikki) and as I left my room another housekeeper asked if everything was alright. A pleasant introduction. Body Lotion shampoo, etc, excellent quality. There is no coffee maker and pop, candy dispenser is on 15th floor. There is a coffee shop off lobby and a Starbucks around the corner. I lost my wallet and all my identification at a restaurant in Manhattan and the Manager of the 30-30 was so kind to me and cashed a check for me to get me through the rest of the trip. The bed was comfortable and the only street noises were the cleaning quipment and garbage pickup during the night. My last stay in NY was Plaza Athenee which cost about $300+ per night so you can see my hesitancy to stay here, but the place was just fine. Front desk had wonderful red apples.

<Content>I stayed at thid hotel with my frield and found the twin room basic but spacious for New York. The location is superb ideal for our busy hectic five day stay. Check in was quicka nd efficient and arranged both our helicopter tour and return Airport transportation. We thought it would be basic but for $55 was actually a limo!! Great end to the holiday. We would stay again it was fun, hip very New York and ideal for two girls on the town.

<Title>“Average”
<Content>We recently spent 3 nights at the 30 30. Having read both the good and bad reviews on Tripadvisor we were rather worried. Before arriving I had e-mailed the hotel to confirm what we had requested when booking and also to advise them we would be checking in, we received an e-mail back a few days later and this confirmed our desires. We had no problems at all checking in and as requested we had a non-smoking queen room on the 12 floor. The room was small (as expected) and clean. The bathroom consisted of a shower and toilet but strangely the wash hand basin was in the room next to the bed!! The location of this hotel suited us for the shops and sights. Our room was very quiet and suited our needs. On a negative point, the carpets in the corridors are dirty and really need cleaned/replaced. The hotel is nothing fancy at all but if you are in NYC and not going to be in it long and just looking for somewhere to wash and sleep then it works well.

<Content>We went on 4.11.04 for 5 days. We got to the hotel after a long journey and had to wait an hour for our room. We had upgraded to a Deluxe room and when we got to see our Deluxe room it was horrid - I went to ask the unfriendly staff to move us, they said they had no deluxe rooms left - and after I got cross with them - they all of a sudden found another room! This room was clean, the bathroom you could not move in and for the 5 days we did not have a duvet cover and we could smell pooh!! I would not recommend anyone to stay here, I would agree with the other people - its an expensive hostel!! We felt robbed!

<Title>“Avoid like the plague”
<Content>Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. Just visited TripAdvisor and had to write a review on this one. Stayed there two years ago. A nightmare from start to finish. Reception staff unfriendly, unhelpful and disorganised. Went to room to find a 'woman' (draw your own conclusions) lying on the bed. She didn't do alot for me I have to say, but did give my wife a bit of a surprise. I guess she wasn't expecting us either !!!. Got another room that was so small that we had to put our suitcases in the bathroom. Either there or the hallway. Corridors and lift were filthy and full of kids running around. I later discovered that there were families 'residing' in some of the rooms. They were a carry over from when it was a 'housing' building. Have a look at the different type doors and you'll see what I mean. Were originally booked in for four nights (at not a fabulously cheap rate, I might add). Got out of there the next morning and went to the Southgate Towers (Fab). This place was so bad I would prefer to sleep on a bench in Central Park. I am a very experienced traveller and cannot understand the good reviews for this place. Some people mustn't be used to even a basic level of comfort when on vacation. Avoid like the PLAGUE.

<Title>“Excellent Value for Money”
<Content>My girlfriend and I visited New York between 7th and 11th November spending 2 nights in the Thirty Thirty Hotel and 2 nights in the Plaza. To give an idea of the pricing, the Thirty Thirty worked out at Â£75 per room per night and the Plaza at Â£240 per room per night. Both hotels had had mixed reviews but we had never been to the City and my girlfriend was especially keen to stay at the Plaza. However it was booked for the first night so I took the opportunity to balance the cost out with a reasonably priced 3 star hotel. Thirty Thirty......Excellent Value for money. Clean and Contemporary, ok the bedroom was on the small side but the bathroom was a good size. Staff were helpful and friendly and the location was excellent, very close to the Empire State Building. If you want a good value break in a clean and contemporary hotel, we couldn't recommend this highly enough. Got our rate from a UK website called Metropolistravel. The Plaza....First the good points - lovely looking from the outside and excellent location on fifth avenue and next to Central Park. On arrival, the ground floor and lobby was very grand, if not a little in the past. We were upgraded from our standard room to a fairmont room as it was our first time which was a nice start but when we walked into the room we were very disappointed. The room was a good size but very dated, and the bathroom was small and shabby with cracked tiles. To put it bluntly, the whole hotel needs complete renovation. I spoke to the Front desk manager on departure to express our disappointment, and he was very nice, admitting he dealt with these complaints all day everyday. He said it hadn't been renovated for 9 years, when most hotels get refits every 5. It has apparently just changed owners in the last month and already there are rumours that it will close for a year to be completely renovated - I hope they do this - It desperately needs it. However it sells out every night, living off its name and iconic stature, with people like us handing over our cash! Not good value for money - I would not recommend staying here until its been refurbished. One positive point though, we were given a $200 meal in the famous Oak rooms on the day we left in response to my complaint.

<Title>“Horrible Service, Horrible Hotel”
<Content>I booked an upgraded room on the Hotel Thirty Thirty site due to the "Stay 3 nights, get the fourth free" advertisement. When we arrived at the hotel, the staff was unaware of this and had I not printed off the exact wording when I booked it, we wouldn't have recieved this discount. They were very difficult to deal with and gave us problems during check-in and check-out. I would hate to see what a regular room looks like because the "upgraded" room was a full bed with slight walking space around it. The bathroom door wouldn't even open all the way b/c the room was so small. Other than shampoo, conditioner and lotion, non of the amenities listed on the reservation site were a part of this room. There were unknown stains all over and the smell was musty. Our view looked directly into someone else's room and the shared bathrooms. This hotel reminded me of an overpriced hostel. The lobby was unwelcoming and stark. For $200 a night, I would have rather stayed elsewhere.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>We just came back from this hotel last week, having read some of the comments on this site I was slightly apprehensive. I have to say however, that we had no complaints whatsoever about the hotel, once we had our bearings we felt the location was great and it was easy to walk to various places. Though not all the staff were particularly helpful there was usually someone only to happy to give us advice. We had a standard room which although not big, it was cleaned daily and the bathroom was spotless. I Would definately reccommend this hotel, after all when you are in New York you spend most of the day out and about. You won't be dissappointed if you expect what you pay for, but they do have larger rooms. There was no noise either when we were there and the beds were comfortable.

<Title>“The true scoop”
<Content>So, I read all the review, and to be honest, I was a little nervous about staying at this hotel. I am in NYC every week for business, and I need a hotel that is near midtown, and has reasonable rates. I found this and more at the hotel. First it easier to tell you what this hotel does not have. Do not expect: 1) Iron and Ironing Board 2) Room Service 3) Soda or candy vending machines 4) Ice Machines 5) Coffee Makers 6) Bellmen or Doormen 7) Conceirge Desk 8) Spacious rooms If this is what you want, then stay in the more pricey "boutique" or full service hotels. If you want a clean, quiet, friendly hotel in a great neighborhood, near midtown, then this is the place. I have stayed at the hotel now over 15 nights in three weeks, and it contiunues to please. My only suggestion to the hotel is to provide delivery menu's in the room so you know who to call in the area.

<Content>Stayed at the 30 30 on the 9th September for four nights. The room was teeny tiny and very dark, the view was so awful that I kept my blinds shut the whole time, which made the room seem even smaller. The staff were not very friendly. I felt that checking people in was a bother to them. Also the cleaning staff were very noisey in the mornings and the bed wasn't the most comfortable On a plus side, the room was cleaned well each day and I guess for its price... well, you get what you pay for. The bar downstairs cooks up some lovely food and it is in a great location. Only stay at the 30 30 if you plan to sleep here only.

The room was on floor 12 and was clean, comfortable and everything worked. Also we had a great view of the Empire state building. The location is superb. There is a great deli called Tasty round the corner on Madison Avenue where you can get a good breakfast, cheap. At the thirty thirty it's not luxury, but it's more than adequate for a comfortable stay. I can't vouch for the other rooms but can recommend room 1205 and would stay there again.

The remaining nights at Thirty Thirty were poor - staff were rude and the manager was convenienetly 'away' until our stay had ended. Room was tiny and not particularly clean. Hotel was booked by school tour parties who roamed the corridors well into the early hours. NY was fabulous but 30 30 was not. Avoid.

<Title>“Thirty Thirty a good deal at USD 169 + tax”
<Content>I had the Big Apple Special for three nights which was an executive suite with a king bed (you could also reserve a room with two queen beds) for USD 169 + tax. The room was a very good deal at that price. Friends stayed on the sofa bed for one night at no extra charge. The room was quiet and clean, the bathroom spacious. Except for the fact that the armoire and bed were not designer (as depicted on the hotel's website) I was not disappointed. I'm picky that way but would definitely go back to the Thirty Thirty. I spent the next weekend at Thirty Thirty's sister property, Hotel Habitat, for about USD 102 + tax. My room 1215 was a hole compared to Thirty Thirty, the shared bathroom had mildew and was just as horrible as you can imagine. My neighbors were obviously people living permanently in the hotel. I got some pretty shocking glimpses at their living quarters too.

<Title>“Wonderful trip turned bad”
<Content>Our check-in went okay, except for our disappointment over the EXTREME lack of space in our queen-bed room for our family of 3. There was a very small area in which to walk around our bags, and the front door could not be opened properly b/c we had to stow a bag behind it. Once the crib and small fridge were brought to our room, there was even less space to get in the door, let alone, walk to the bathroom. On our departure day, we paid for late check-out at 5 p.m. We were appalled at the hotel staff for the rude ways in which they invaded our privacy, 3 times, to get us to check out earlier, including a phone call which I rec'd while our infant was sleeping and the mgr. of housekeeping and a male front desk staff member letting themselves into our room while I was nursing our infant. At no time did we cause any problems for hotel staff or other patrons. I forwarded a written complaint to the manager, who did nothing nor did he respond. WE WILL NOT BE STAYING HERE AGAIN, regardless of the lower rates.

<Title>“Hated 30/30 -- Couldn't Wait to Leave”
<Content>I stayed at the 30/30 after having stayed at their sister NYC hotel (On the Avenue). 30/30 was cheaper and closer to where I was doing business. I was booked in for 2 nights. The room was so awful -- even Paris hotels are bigger, freezing cold, tiniest bathroom which flooded after shower -- that I left a day early just to get out of the hotel. It's not worth staying here! One of the other reviewers mentioned staying at the Clarion after his 30/30 room was available -- he lucked out. I've stayed at the Clarion and it's what a hotel should be. Avoid the 30/30 no matter what price they offer rooms for -- it's just not worth it!

Despite a dreary lobby area, our room was ready when we arrived and cleaned with fresh towels etc. every day. Although the room was small you shouldn't need to spend much time in it in NY! It was in a good lication and is a quiet area at night. Also food in the restaurant is very good. Overall, a good budget choice.

The staff was friendly enough - the best guy they have there is the older Bellman who seems to do everything, but he was helpful as they always are when you leave him something. The standard room hasn't enough space to unpack my bags - I'd rather not do it on the bed I'm sleeping in. The carpets were dirty as though they needed a good steamcleaning, if not replacement altogether. The bathroom is clean enough, but they obviously did some butcher job when they renovated it - there is a difference between renovating and rehabilitating. If a clean place to stay is important to you, don't stay here.

<Title>“Reasonable price, clean, nice decor”
<Content>Ive stayed at thirty thirty a couple of times and its a good hotel if you are looking for something on a budget. The first time I was at Thirty Thirty was October 2003 and then again in Februray 2004. In october I was in a large room, the second time the room was small but ok considering the price (around $110). If you are looking for luxury dont stay at thirty thirty, its a nice clean reasonably priced hotel in a good location for Macy's Empire state and the subway. Some of the reviews on this site seem to be expecting the Waldorf, for $100 dollars i dont think you will get much better in NYC.

<Title>“Clean room and shower is all you need in NY!!”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel from 8th to 12th July 2004. I have to agree with other reviews and say that the reception staff are not particularly helpful, BUT the location is excellent, and the hotel is very good value for money. I should think that most people staying in New York would not be spending a lot of time in their hotel room, so you only really need a clean bed and shower and the hotel provided this so considering it's reasonable rates, I would recommend staying at the 30/30 Hotel. However, the noise from the streets below can be a problem so try and book a room on the upper floors. Also, the bar and restaurant are very good at the hotel.

<Title>“Quiet & close to major sights”
<Content>We arrived to find our room was not ready, due to an error through our travel company and not hotel, but while waiting wandered around and hotel was close to shops, Empire State Building etc, we were kept busy. Would say that room was small, but very quiet and a private bathroom more than adequate. Staff at reception were very helpful and the staff in restaurant/bar within hotel were lovely. Did laugh at the "teddy"!

<Title>“We got what we expected”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel Thirty Thirty in New York City 6 nights in July 2004. When we first started searching for a hotel in New York we were of course overwhelmed by the number of hotels we could choose from. Our goal was to find a clean, decent hotel located centrally in Manhattan and we wanted to room to be as cheap as possible and we wanted a private bath and a TV. After searching for quite a bit and looking into the option of using priceline we ended up on Hotel Thirty Thirty. We booked it through a travel agency here in Norway and we had to pay about 6400 Norwegian Kroner for the 6 nights (with todayâ€™s exchange rate that is about 150 dollars pr night including all taxes). I also used tripadvisor.com which is an excellent site where you can get feedback about most hotels in the US and around the world. We arrived in New York City at Penn Station and we took a cab to the hotel. The hotel is located on 30 East 30th street near Park Avenue (only a few minutes walk from Empire State Building). The taxi only took 5 minutes to get there and we paid about 5 dollars. The lobby of the hotel was nice and quiet and the check in was extremely fast. I just had to sign a paper and they swiped my credit card and then we got a non-smoking room on the 11th floor (1141 to be precise). Our room was quite small but nice. As you can see from the pictures there room was pretty naked (pictures can be seen on my homepage gardkarlsen.com. There were a carpet on the floor and the walls were covered with a light wall paper.Apart from the king-size bed we had a chair, a TV that was mounted on the wall in corner of the room, a couple of draws and a wardrobe with about 5 hangers. The TV had lots and lots of channels to offer but I felt like it was like the Bruce Springsteen song â€œFifty-seven channels and nothin' onâ€� :-) One strange thing about the room was that the sink was in the bedroom itself and not in the bathroom. Iâ€™m not sure why it has been done like this but we got used to it :-) There was also a telephone and an alarm clock on the night tables next to the bed. The bathroom was also quite tiny but big enough to room the toilet and a shower. The bathroom was covered with tiles on both the floor and the wall. The shower was a step in type with a glass door. In the shower we found little bottles of shampoo, conditioner and in the room itself we found little bars of soap and moisturizing cream. Our window faced towards 29th Street and the view from our room was not great to say the least. We looked right out on a typical New York landmark I guessâ€¦a water tank :-) But at least we were high up so we didnâ€™t have any problem with noise from the traffic on Park Avenue at night. Location In our opinion the hotel has a pretty good location. It only takes a few seconds to get to places where you can have breakfast. We ended up having breakfast on Suziâ€™s kitchen quite a lot but there were also a Starbuckâ€™s coffee right around the corner and a Pax place near by. There is also a restaurant connected to the hotel (Zanaâ€™s) but I canâ€™t really comment on it because we never ate there. The hotel was also pretty good located when it comes to getting around. It only took us 2-3 minutes to walk to the 28th Street/Park Avenue subway stationâ€¦and once you are on the subway you can reach most places in New York. We like to walk and on our first afternoon we walked to Empire State Building and after that up to Times Square. Apart from this there is not that much more to say about the hotel. They have a laundry service, there are an internet option in the lobby (we didnâ€™t try it out but we used The Log-on CafÃ© across the street from the hotel), and you can borrow an iron in the lobby if you need one. Conclusion I see that there are many different opinions about this hotel on places like Tripadvisor.com. We felt that we got what we expected and I think that the information on the hotelâ€™s website -------------------- is pretty accurate. We got a small, clean room in a hotel that didnâ€™t have much more to offer than a pretty good location. But when we are on a big city holiday we are not really looking for a hotel with lots of amenities. After all most of the day and evening is spent sight-seeing anyway. I would not mind staying there again if we go to New York City in the future and I would not hestitate to recommend this hotel to other people.

<Title>“Good value...”
<Content>As a travel writer, I was hoping to find an economy hotel for my NYC story. Thirty Thirty did fit the bill, and although the room was very tiny (I was traveling solo), it was clean and the front desk people friendly and helpful. My one main concern was the lack of a lock on the front door. I think they should put in a key card system (although the desk is open 24 hours a day), I know as a solo woman traveler I would feel a lot more secure knowing that not just anybody can cruise in off the streets. I had a room with a private bath, the only way I like to travel when I'm alone. I thought the stuffed animal on the bed was a bit strange, as it didn't fit the minimalist decor of the hotel. Oh, well...just an annoying detail. I did spend my last night at The Fairmont Plaza (Mother's Day) in a huge suite overlooking Central Park. I'm so glad I saved that for the big finale of my five night stay! ----------------

<Title>“Not as bad as you expect!”
<Content>On finding that we were going to this hotel I read your reviews this made me not particularly want to go on the trip, however I am glad I decided to go ahead as I found it to be an acceptable hotel. We were in standard rooms which were clean, bathroom small but had everything you needed and had TV with good films. Some rooms had a fridge and hobs (although wouldn't advise cooking as didn't look reliable) but good for storing water etc. Dissappointed as in group of three, all paid the same price, and found 2 beds, and 1 camp bed (camp bed being the more comfortable) A group of friends in another room found that the person that had slept on the camp bed had bed bugs, and been bitten in a line - be warned! Reception was attended by 2 men, whenever I was in the lobby, both were friendly and helpful to exchange travellers cheques (if they had the funds - which wasn't very often) and sent electrician to our room when the safe battery had run out. Location was good, subway easy enough to navigate once you had your bearings. Walked to Time Square and Broadway area easily, Cafe 28 was nearby which served cheap meals during the day. Being in New York you are not going to spend much time in the hotel, however for the time we did we found it fine, and really enjoyed the visit!

<Title>“What a waste”
<Content>Stayed in this hotel for 5 days. Before comin to this hotel, i checked out their hotel's website and read the reviews of people who have stayed there before. I wanted to cancel my reservation striaght away after reading it as most of the reviews talked about bad customer service, double booking and so on, but didn't as i needed to really see for myself what the hotel is really like. When i got to the hotel, my first impression was that it looked nothin like what i imagined or from the website. The receptionist was very rude and cold and she gave us a room which was on the top floor. This is not acceptable particularly as i have told my agency who then told them that my partner is ill and suffers from a stroke before so we need a room near the lower floor. The room was also very small and we could bearly move round. when we went to confront her about the room, she turned around it us saying that a luxury room would cost $100. it wasn't until i presented her with document showing that i have paid $200 did the staff do anything about. There is more i can write about this hotel but imagine yourself waking up at 4 in the morning, with heavy baggage, travelling 10 hours on small and we could bearly move round. when we went to confront her about the room, she turned around it us saying that a luxury room would cost $100. it wasn't until i presented her with document showing that i have paid $200 did the staff do anything about. There is more i can write about this hotel but imagine yourself waking up at 4 in the morning, with heavy baggages, travelling 10 hours on the plane, the last thing you want is the receptionist being rude and being unhelpful. it is up to you if you want to stay in this hotel but i wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is expected the good standards and good customer service.

<Title>“Very good experience”
<Content>I saw the reviews on this web site the night before I was to leave for NYC to stay at this hotel for 5 nights (May 6-11). I panicked a little due to some people's nightmarish experiences. However, when we arrived at the hotel just after 9:00am, we were told we could check in right away, even though check-in is usually at 3:00pm, and our room was also upgraded at no extra charge! Very clean and spacious. We got a room with two twin beds and a kitchenette area for US$119 per night. Excellent value. My only gripe is a small one: the housekeeping got a little bit worse during our stay. The first 3 nights were great, the next two were only satisfactory. I think it's wise to book well in advance at this hotel and avoid the very busy times such as mid-summer and during college spring break. It also seems like a good idea to check in as early as possible.

<Title>“You get what you pay for”
<Content>Booked a 6 night stay in the Thirty Thirty and at first was a little worried after reading the reviews so I emailed them three days before the trip to confirm booking and they replied saying everything was OK. Most negative reviews are due to people arriving to find the room they booked not being available which would be a nightmare so to make sure email them before your trip and print out confiramtion they send back. Anyway, onto the room, WHO CARES, your in New York, it was clean and was kept clean by housekeeping during our stay, it had a bed, shower (which didn't leak!!) and a sink thats all you need. You go to New York to see the sights not the room so those saying it was small etc SO WHAT, get out and enjoy yourselves. People from the UK reading this you will not be dissapointed we were up and out of the hotel at 8am and didn't go back till 9pm, bed was comfortable, clean along with bathroom and shower which was all that I expected. I've stayed in hotels all over the world, even a 7 star hotel in Dubai and although not in the same league you get what you pay for and thats value for money in the case of the Thirty Thirty, check in and enjoy your trip you won't be even thinking about the size of the room when you see how close to everything you are, smack bang in the middle of downtown/uptown, enjoy!

<Title>“worst hotel I have ever been too”
<Content>Arrived at Thirty Thirty after a long flight to find that they did not have my booking. Our friends booking was there but not ours. After about 30 minutes, it was all sorted out. When we arrived at our room, it was the most appalling sight for a hotel that I have ever seen. It was a very depressing box. Nothing at all like the picture. The blinds reminded me of sacks. Our friends had a cockroach in there bathroom. The awful teddies that are left on the bed are revoluting. They try and convince you that you should buy one. Our details off of the internet said that the hotel had a swimming pool. No chance. unless you count the shower flooding your room. My friends and I booked this hotel and then found this web site. We were hoping that the comments were not true. Please listen to what people are saying, this is a truly awful hotel. People who say this hotel is nice have obviously never been abroad or away to a hotel before. We have stayed in America before and the standards were truly superb. The Thirty Thirty Hotel is nothing but a depressing dive. I would never stay there even if it was offered to us free of charge. Be warned!

<Title>“This is a fine hotel - do not worry!”
<Content>I booked our stay at the Thirty Thirty on Expedia and received a great deal - then I read the reviews which were not that great. I was worried and was close to cancelling the reservations - but my husband kept telling me everything would be fine. Turns out - everything was fine! This is a typical 3 star hotel - nothing very fancy. The room was clean and the housekeeping staff were wonderful! So the front desk staff doesn't kiss your feet everytime you walk through the door - if you want that stay at the Plaza. This is an ideal hotel for the NYC visitor on the go - don't be too concerned with the less than favorable reviews - this is a fine hotel.

<Title>“Scammed”
<Content>The stay at this hotel tainted my entire trip. In one instance I told front desk that I was going to get a cab to guardia airport for 6:00am which was around $35US.. he stopped me from doing so and told me to get a "hotel" special car to the airport as it would be cheaper - he quoted $35US for the trip He then called up his "friend" who took me and when I got to the airport quoted me over $US50. I am so angry.. i wrote an email to the hotel asking for the name of a manager but they didnt even reply. I have stayed in hostels in third world countries that were better. For example you would think in a shower in the USA in 2004 that there would be some kind of closed off area so that the entire floor and carpet wont get flooded when you have a shower. Also house keeping like to come into the room escpecially when the "do not disturbe" sign is up. Coming from a traveller who has stayed in some of the worlds most shady places - this would be by far the worst and most disgraceful of them all.

<Title>“Excellent value, great location”
<Content>I too was concerned about the mixed reviews but I had a great experience. We were upgraded to a corner room with kitchenette. Good beds. The location is great, it was quiet for NYC (far quieter than the Hotel Wales on the upper east side), loved the tabloid at the door on Monday a.m. The basics were done with style - you don't need the extras if you are out all day and into the night. Would definitely stay there again.

<Content>We were very cautious after reading the reviews but we were very pleasantly surprised. My mom and I arrived several hours ahead of check in time- the friendly staff not only gave us a room but upgraded us to a kitchenette room. it was clean, and on the larger side for a nyc room. The price was right and this is where we'll stay from now on. And we can bring our dogs!

<Title>“Worst Hotel Experience EVER!”
<Content>I booked the Thirty Thirty after doing lots of research and reserved a deluxe suite; best room they had for five nights. My review is not that detailed because I never got past reception. Arrived straight from JFK after flying from Glasgow via London and was told, and very emphatically so, that I could not have ny room that night but I could come back the next morning and have it then. In the meantime they sent me to the nearby Carlton. I confess, I have never been confronted with such appalling service;or dreadful amnners; three staff on reception, their aveare age must have been 18 or so and none had any basic understanding of manners or customer service. The reason given for the no room for the night was that it had been damaged owing to inclement weather. I asked to see it and was refused. I was told the room was on the second floor; how it got flood damaged from either above or below is not clear to me. Staff would not make eye contact when telling the tall tale and I am convinced the room was given away to someone else. Not what you want to hear after 14 hours travelling. By contrast the nearby Carlton was excellent and I did not go back to Thirty Thirty. For those of you considering booking Thirty Thirty; don't, you'll do much better by the Carlton!

<Title>“Beware room 908!”
<Content>I ended up staying in the Thirty Thirty for one night only because it seemed as if there was no other hotel to be had in New York and my agent had made a mistake with my original booking. When I arrived the lobby was full of students re-packing their bags and there was rubbish and half eaten food on the floor. The two staff at the check-in desk were obviously not happy in their work and could hardly bring themselves to look up from the desk. When I asked for help with a telephone number I was told they didn't have a phone book. My room - number 908 - was little more than a broom cupboard with a single bed and just about enough floor space for a suitcase. The 'bathroom' was a tiled shower room with no cubicle but just a curtain and a hole in the floor. There was a miniscule hand basin in one corner and a loo in the other and to use either after showering meant walking across a soaking wet floor. It's the sort of thing you might expect in a cheap room in the med but not a hotel room in New York! The decor was drab and the room in no way resembled anything that appears on their website so beware!
