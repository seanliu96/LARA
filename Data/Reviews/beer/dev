7 10 6 7 8		rogue honey cream ale : in a twelve ounce brown bottle , with a delightful honey maid on the label .<ssssss>pour a slightly hazy deep golden color , with a fairly impressive head that be just a little off-white .<ssssss>the aroma be very nice and rich .<ssssss>i think i can smell honey , but i know i can smell the floral hop , pair with sweet malt .<ssssss>the aroma on this beer be terrific .<ssssss>the taste be somewhat of a shock , as if you have be anticipate more of a sweet honey taste , youll be surprise .<ssssss>this beer be aggressively hop , and the flavor profile be therefore dominate by somewhat bitter flavor , without floral taste .<ssssss>the only trace of honey/malts be deep into the aftertaste .<ssssss>this beer be somewhat more carbonated than i would like .<ssssss>overall , i enjoy this beer very much , and its only get better as the room im in grow hotter .<ssssss>nice summer sip beer .<ssssss>
7 4 8 7 6		appearance : gold macro color , nice cream white head , copious carbonation .<ssssss>smell : a mix of ligjt grain and adjunct , very light , though .<ssssss>taste : like a creamy macro , kind of odd , yet more enjoyable than you typical american lager .<ssssss>the cream flavor be light yet welcome in this situation .<ssssss>mouthfeel : creamy , adequately carbonate , good .<ssssss>drinkability : for the price there be much better beer , but if it be cheap , and i be break , why not ?<ssssss>
6 6 8 6 6		i would say that red stripe be a average beer at best .<ssssss>there be nothing to special about it .<ssssss>it have a little bit of a harsh after taste .<ssssss>other than that it be just average in taste and smell .<ssssss>it be kind of weak in alcohol content and come in a small bottle .<ssssss>so i would say it be not a party beer .<ssssss>i will give the bottle it due .<ssssss>it be unique .<ssssss>
8 10 7 8 9		32oz growler pour into a dogfish head snifter .<ssssss>growler provide by racen , thanks nick !<ssssss>a - pour a clear amber with ton of carbonation streaming from the glass .<ssssss>a frothy , 2.5-finger head build and slowly cascade down , with excellent retention and a rocky cap that stick as well .<ssssss>the lacing be pretty good , not as generous as the head would lead I to believe , but still decent .<ssssss>s - even right after pour i could get the explosion of tropical fruit that the hop provide to this beer .<ssssss>huge note of pineapple and mango and even some peach as well .<ssssss>it be actually surprising I how vibrant and clean this aroma be and it really do bring to mind image of a beach getaway .<ssssss>there be a bit of malt backbone as well that lend itself a touch of toffee , but for the most part this be all tropical hop .<ssssss>t - the taste bring more malt to the table than be present in the nose .<ssssss>it have a decent caramel malt backbone with a little brown sugar and both carry on throughout the taste .<ssssss>even still , the hop be the stand-out in the taste and be quite potent .<ssssss>again , i be get that excellent tropical note , with the pineapple and especially peach which be pretty unique for I .<ssssss>some mango and even guava come through near the end .<ssssss>the one complaint i have against this beer be that it be pretty bitter .<ssssss>i be expect that give the amount of hop in this , and the hop flavor and malt bill do help counteract this , but it definitely be a aspect of the beer that be strong .<ssssss>just a hint of alcohol in the finish that do not let on that this beer be 10 % .<ssssss>m - mouthfeel be moderately heavy-bodied with lowish carbonation .<ssssss>i can let the okay carbonation slide a bit since it come from a growler fill almost a week ago and endure a shipping trip , but it still be not awful and definitely best some of the carbonation i have get from growler ipa fill locally and enjoy within a feel day .<ssssss>the bitterness do linger on the palate , but the hoppy finish go a long way in alleviate this .<ssssss>d/o - drinkability be high .<ssssss>i actually drink a glass of this in its entirety before i could bring myself to review the taste portion of this beer .<ssssss>the nose be addicting , and if not for the bitterness , the taste would be amazing as well .<ssssss>i hear about sun king from they osiris , but i be ecstatic that i be able to get this as well since this be a great dipa that bring exotic hop characteristic .<ssssss>much too easy to down this beer and at this point i be wish i have a 64oz growler of it !<ssssss>

8 6 8 9 8		a nice solid brew , i dig it .<ssssss>the beer pour a nice orange with a ample stream of carbonation bubble up through the beer .<ssssss>the smell be not that great , in my opinion .<ssssss>whichever ale yeast they use add a massive tutti-frutti bubblegum presence that i just plain do not like .<ssssss>unusually , the taste redeem the smell .<ssssss>the tutti-frutti still mess the taste up , unfortunately .<ssssss>but the grain add a nice complexity to it .<ssssss>it remind I a lot of a northern german alt than a apa .<ssssss>rich toast malt dominate with a pleasantly thick and slick mouthfeel .<ssssss>the hop provide a nice old-world earthiness that i appreciate .<ssssss>overall the beer be pretty nice .<ssssss>too ale-y for I , in term of the yeast contribution .<ssssss>but i be not hate it either .<ssssss>

9 8 9 10 8		a - open with quite a pop , pour a cloudy , kinda chunky med .<ssssss>gold color with a immense white head which not fill the remainder of my 16oz snifter but expand about 1 & 1/2 inch above the rim before cascade onto my comp .<ssssss>desk , lacing be excellent as i expect s - smell be of spiced caramel apple cider , some fresh baked bready aroma come out more as it warm vary from white to whole grain nut to a sweet honey raison danish make with clove , just a trace of estery alcohol t - taste be also fruity w / a crisp sour green apple initial flavor be follow closely by a big cereal grain malt that have be kiln a bit longer , a def .<ssssss>clovey spice , caramel , nut and raisony dark fruit w / very subtle anise in the mix at different time , just a hint of bittering hop and bozzy hotness linger in the back of the mouth in the finish m - a full body that appear lighter thanks to ample carbonation and a fairly dry body d - a very drinkable beer give the 10 % abv , so complex you have to have more than 11.2 oz , i suggest a bomber ... split in two however<ssssss>
9 3 5 3 6		appearance : dark amber color with a tannish/offwhite head .<ssssss>the head be abundant , explode into the glass and settle to about 1/2 finger thickness , never get smaller .<ssssss>smell : a mix of malty goodness , some light hoppage , and poorly make gravy ... gravy ?<ssssss>yes gravy .<ssssss>it take over the taste at time , but at other it be not very apparent .<ssssss>i think it might be the glass , so i switch glass .<ssssss>i think it might be where i be drink it , so i move outside .<ssssss>the gravy follow .<ssssss>taste : the gravy from the smell come back to the taste too .<ssssss>this time however , there be a nice intense hop taste .<ssssss>more intense than i expect for a bock , but still german tasting .<ssssss>mouthfeel : the beer have a great alcoholic zing to it , and the body be perfect for a bock : not to heavy , not to light , somewhere in the middle and smooth .<ssssss>however , it be interrupt by overcarbonation that never cease .<ssssss>the bubble be a nuisance to a nice mouthfeel .<ssssss>drinkability : despite the poor taste and the awkward mouthfeel , it be actually pretty easy to down .<ssssss>i would not want it again , but there be other bock that just do not sit as well flow down the palate .<ssssss>
6 7 8 6 10		my first experience with grand teton brewing .<ssssss>i consider myself a hophead , and rarely do i go for anything that i think might resemble a `` domestic '' beer .<ssssss>but i be strangely in the mood for something light , so i decide to venture out and try a new brewer and a different kind of beer .<ssssss>pour into a pilsner style glass .<ssssss>very little lacing , but it be a blonde and typically lighter in the malt side so it be to be expect .<ssssss>nice golden color .<ssssss>actually have a pretty nice smell , mellow malty aroma , some nutty scent , very little hop aroma .<ssssss>nice mouthfeel , very very drinkable .<ssssss>flavor pretty typical of a blonde , i always seem to pick out straw .<ssssss>not much flavor on the back end , it be a pretty light one .<ssssss>i be in the mood for a lighter beer , and this one fit the bill .<ssssss>nothing really memorable , but still solid .<ssssss>probably a good gateway beer for those still flounder in the world of domestic beer .<ssssss>not bad .<ssssss>
8 8 7 5 5		this beer pour a cloudy brown color .<ssssss>the head be one inch in height , and recede slowly into nice lacing .<ssssss>the aroma be of vibrant cinnamon , nutmeg , ginger , with a firm malt backbone .<ssssss>the taste be even more spicy than the aroma , and i be not sure that be a good thing .<ssssss>i really like the aroma , but the taste be just too much .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be full body with lively carbonation , and a smooth texture .<ssssss>overall , this would be a really good beer if it be a bit mellower .<ssssss>as be i do not think i will be drink this again .<ssssss>
9 8 8 10 8		so dark in color it be difficult to identify anything else within this beer .<ssssss>a slight head with a mocha-color that stay around for awhile .<ssssss>i could smell nut , chocolate , coffee bean , and roasted sugar ; somewhat expect for this style , but still appeal .<ssssss>the taste be just incredible with a richness in flavor and texture that make it one of the best ris around .<ssssss>smooth and creamy from the first sip to the last drop .<ssssss>the sweetness be never so dominant it take away from the beer or blow out you taste bud .<ssssss>the drinkability be excellent in term of whether or not i would want another pint , but the double digit abv prevent I from have more than 1 of these beer .<ssssss>
9 8 9 4 6		batch no. 1 -lrb- oct , 2011 ? -rrb-<ssssss>a : cola color with red hue below a full finger of latte foam and spotty lace .<ssssss>excellent clarity .<ssssss>s : tea , citrus , resin , spice -lrb- cumin ? -rrb-<ssssss>over a english style malt bill .<ssssss>t : sweet and malty with some spice -lrb- nearly rye spicy -rrb- not much hop character in the flavor -lrb- similar to the dub ipa , third voyage iirc -rrb- .<ssssss>pretty simple .<ssssss>m : heavy and light carb with a thick slick finish .<ssssss>spot on .<ssssss>o : not bad , would not be my first choice for a red , or even my top five .<ssssss>need more balance between the amount of hop offer in the olfactory which do not carry into the tastebud .<ssssss>
6 9 5 9 8		get bottle of this in trade with thetomg and jojomdma .<ssssss>thanks for the hook-up gent !<ssssss>from a bomber into a snifter .<ssssss>vintage : 2010 note : taste directly after bourbon county stout .<ssssss>appearance : pour out black , but not quite pitch black .<ssssss>the pour produce a cascade finger mocha color head that magically appear out of nowhere .<ssssss>jet black body with no real noticeable carbonation .<ssssss>head quickly fade to nothing and a ring around the edge of the glass .<ssssss>a slight ring remain until the end and leave no lacing .<ssssss>look exactly the same as bourbon county .<ssssss>smell : burnt coffee bean lead the way , then some roasted malt , lot of bourbon , vanilla and wood note .<ssssss>quite bold as well .<ssssss>definitely the regular bourbon county with add coffee bean .<ssssss>taste : same deal as the nose .<ssssss>lot of bourbon again , vanilla and oak note , as well as some roasted barley .<ssssss>the roasted coffee bean overlap everything and tie it all together nicely .<ssssss>finish with some bitter chocolate , vanilla and bourbon note , as well as a long bourbon and bitter coffee lead aftertaste .<ssssss>very bold flavor here , and a bit of well-placed heat at the end .<ssssss>the coffee play a nice role , mesh well with the regular bourbon county .<ssssss>palate : like the regular bourbon county , the body be too thin and light for the style .<ssssss>it be somewhat airy on the palate as well .<ssssss>semi-creamy on the palate , go down fine but have as delay scratch and burn at the finish .<ssssss>end relatively mouth-coating .<ssssss>a little less abrasive than the normal version , but still too thin and light .<ssssss>overall : a nice variant of the bourbon county brand stout .<ssssss>the coffee flavor mesh well with the regular base brew without dominate or overpower in any way .<ssssss>like the regular version , a heavier palate would perhaps help push thing over the top , but that be a small critique on what be otherwise a fantastic beer .<ssssss>one worth check out if you get the chance .<ssssss>thanks again guy for send I some of this brew !<ssssss>

9 4 5 4 9		i be eager to try this beer as guinness fes have be my go-to brand internationally for year -lrb- and the only macro that i love -rrb- .<ssssss>beer pour ruby-red-black with a linger head that lace my glass nicely .<ssssss>not as dark-black as guinness fe of draught .<ssssss>unfortunately , this beer do not appear to be a stout , but rather a black lager-like brew .<ssssss>the beer have a clean , sent-free aroma with the tinyest hint of roast .<ssssss>there be possibly interesting roast note in the flavor , but the unusually high -lrb- for a stout -rrb- carbonation level overshadow anything else in the flavor profile .<ssssss>this beer have no complexity that could potentially interfere with `` drinkability '' .<ssssss>look like guinness/diego decide to push out a lower-cost-to-manufacture product for the 250th anniversary , while savy marketeer understand that loyal follower would `` buy-it-to-try-it '' .<ssssss>

8 9 9 7 8		after a big disappointment with my first vintage beer -lrb- a 2001 le coq imperial russian stout that taste like vinegared wine -rrb- , i do not have high hope for this one , which be twice as old .<ssssss>this review be for the 1996 bottle of this brew -- a ` old ale ' in more way than one !<ssssss>pour a solid but ` muddy ' chocolate brown into a oversized wine glass .<ssssss>slightly purple note to it when hold up to the light .<ssssss>bizarre , slow motion bubble to create a small but permanent head .<ssssss>very hazy , although i can not see any individual floaty .<ssssss>aroma be complex -- toffee , licorice , big plump raisin or dry fig , sugary alcohol and sweet malt .<ssssss>look good so far , and ... woohoo !<ssssss>it be not spoil !<ssssss>it be not fantastic , or anything , but definitely different and definitely drinkable .<ssssss>hugely malty , with a bit of a ` coca cola ' flavour to it .<ssssss>mild metallic note that go away as it warm -lrb- need a long time -rrb- .<ssssss>definite raisin flavour , along with some chocolate and roasted malt .<ssssss>super-thick , chewy mouthfeel with a raisiny , bready aftertaste .<ssssss>i will probably never get to try this beer again , now that it be retire , but i be glad i do at least once !<ssssss>
9 8 9 9 6		i attend a tasting for fly dog brew and out of the 11 we sample , this be the best so i buy a single to review here .<ssssss>a - two finger of head with nice lacing .<ssssss>dark beer - much darker than most porter .<ssssss>s - carmel , chocolate , faint alcohol come through .<ssssss>t - the bitterness of this one linger for a while and be quite nice .<ssssss>the caromel and chocolate make up the body of the brew .<ssssss>m - medium carbonation - nice mouthfeel d - honestly - not sure how many of these i could have .<ssssss>it be a good beer but a little low toward the drinkability scale .<ssssss>
9 6 8 10 9		appearance - very dark , look black with a off white head , its a great look beer that make I just want to drink it .<ssssss>smell - very malty smell taste - its so good i can not even describe it .<ssssss>mouthfeel - it be creamy and its like chocolate melting in you mouth .<ssssss>drinkability - very easy to drink and bring I lot of joy<ssssss>

9 8 8 5 8		i review this one a year ago and think it to be a average dipa with more reputation than it deserve .<ssssss>here we go with another try .<ssssss>i pick up a 4pack from my local bevmo .<ssssss>forget the price , but i think it be around $ 12 .<ssssss>my original review be from a four pack that be $ 12.19 which i purchase from coit liquor in san francisco , can .<ssssss>both time i pour into a large snifter to review .<ssssss>the below review be the combined tasting note from both review .<ssssss>a one finger white head that stick around .<ssssss>this one pour pretty thick .<ssssss>rather transparent glowing amber color .<ssssss>good amount of carbonation bubble rise from the bottom of the glass .<ssssss>thick hefty lacing .<ssssss>a perfectly balanced dipa .<ssssss>a great beer in its own right , but when i pick up a dipa , i be look for more hop .<ssssss>have a earthy , woodsy , medicinal flavor that be quite unique to this beer .<ssssss>some mild alcohol presence .<ssssss>i like it for what it be i guess .<ssssss>the magic of the medicinal earthiness slightly disappear in the taste .<ssssss>still very nicely balanced if that be what you be look for .<ssssss>subdue hop with a nice malt backing .<ssssss>full flavor .<ssssss>mouth be relatively thick .<ssssss>medium to full body .<ssssss>very drinkable .<ssssss>i can say my rating improve since my original review , but i be still not that impressed .<ssssss>guess it go back to I be use to the west coast ipa flavor .<ssssss>i know many east coaster prefer this over anything and i respect they opinion .<ssssss>
7 5 5 7 8		pour a pale yellow , with a long-lasting soapy white head with solid retention .<ssssss>have a very husky grain scent follow by a sweet corn aroma .<ssssss>surprisingly a decent tasting beer for a light lager .<ssssss>have as much of a bavarian lager taste as you be go to get from this style .<ssssss>smooth , but a little watery .<ssssss>possibly my favorite light beer .<ssssss>it be what it be .<ssssss>if put a dozen beer down in one sit be the goal , then this be my beer .<ssssss>
8 10 6 8 9		a : pour a nice golden amber color , not much head , but just enough s : smell of flower and citrus fruit t : you can definitely taste the fruit and pomegranate that go into make this beer .<ssssss>the carbonation be better taste and feel than see during the initial pour .<ssssss>d : this beer be very easy to drink .<ssssss>its light but still retain a complexity to make it a good beer<ssssss>

9 8 10 8 8		before i review this beer , i must preface it by say that i be not a big wheat beer fan .<ssssss>that say , here we go ... appearance : the beer pour with a huge 3 '' head after a pretty delicate pour .<ssssss>a minute or so after the pour , the head be at least half of its original height .<ssssss>the beer itself be a mostly clear light golden color with a few bubble rise ... though the head stand anyway .<ssssss>there be ton of lace leave on the glass after drink the beer .<ssssss>aroma : lot of bready wheat aromatic along with some fruity banana and lemon and even a light hint of spiciness .<ssssss>as the beer sit and the head mellow a little bit , you can pick up some more toasty aroma that be a little like bread crust .<ssssss>taste : there be a whole lot of fruitiness to this beer , but it be not so much that it be undrinkable like some brew .<ssssss>it actually have a balance between the fruit and malt .<ssssss>the beer be well attenuate , but there be some evident creaminess to it that make the mouthfeel rather lush .<ssssss>as it warm up some , the fruity ester soften up some and let the malt come out .<ssssss>late after the sip , there be some warming that set in on the back of the throat and wait for the next sip to relinquish control .<ssssss>opinion : i actually like this beer quite a bit ... and that surprise I as there be some of the flavor that i find rather objectionable in other light hefeweizen brew .<ssssss>this beer have enough malt presence and support flavor to keep the palate confuse enough to be able to focus on any one thing .<ssssss>this be a really complex beer .<ssssss>it do not have the dark fruit presence of aventinus , but be still a good brew in its own right .<ssssss>

4 6 4 2 3		i live a stone 's throw from this brewery , and after three year of drinking here i can say i be fantastically disappoint in they consistency .<ssssss>some day the brew be excellent , other day bland , and some day they be downright undrinkable .<ssssss>there be one thing that be consistent , however , and that be the awfulness of this beer .<ssssss>non-descript golden color , no head .<ssssss>the smell of peach be definitely there , and be this beer 's best feature .<ssssss>the taste be reminiscent of peach-flavored iced tea or kool-aid that be go bad .<ssssss>too sweet , with a cloying aftertaste .<ssssss>they need to lighten up on the fruit flavoring to let the grain come through more .<ssssss>

7 8 5 7 8		12 oz bottle dark amberish brown liquid and a small , thin bubbly head from a vigorous pour that quickly dissipate and leave adequate lacing .<ssssss>nutty and fruity aroma , walnut , caramel sugar , all nicely balanced , but something seem off for a brown -lrb- a little too sweet -rrb- .<ssssss>body be smooth and medium thickness with a pleasant hop bite on the finish , however i would prefer much more carbonation in this beer .<ssssss>mouthfeel issue aside , i like the flavor of this , strong malt body , mild sweetness -lrb- caramel , slightly fruity -rrb- balance with walnut and hazlenut flavor .<ssssss>i like the flavor and aroma of this brown , but the body be too off for I to enjoy this .<ssssss>
7 9 6 7 8		recent arrival of botmc so let 's give it a whirl .<ssssss>bottle smell be delicious , fruity , citrusy , some grapefruit and grape , zesty .<ssssss>pour to a pale golden color with a whispy multi-size bubble head .<ssssss>taste be slightly metallic , malty up front , bitter but not overly so in the middle with a metallic dry bitter finish .<ssssss>this hop be very different .<ssssss>the aroma be citrusy but the flavor be more like a fuggle , or english ale , and the bitterness be very dry .<ssssss>hard to believe the ac on this brew be only 4.3 .<ssssss>it be a full flavored ale with good body , mouthfeel and very drinkable .<ssssss>i up the appearance for great head , it hold up for the whole pint !<ssssss>

7 5 5 2 3		2010 vintage .<ssssss>be excite to try this beer because i like the brewery -lrb- mojo , mojo risin ' , haze and infuse -rrb- and i be try to look into barleywine , but i be very dissatisfied .<ssssss>actually , this be probably the most disappointing beer i have ever purchased/tasted .<ssssss>a - look nice , deep mahogany .<ssssss>lot of red tone .<ssssss>s - smell a bit weird , just like how it taste .<ssssss>have a very sweet smell that , after tasting , make I feel a little sick .<ssssss>taste - no good .<ssssss>very weird blend of flavor ; none of they very appealing .<ssssss>have a sweet taste and bring cherry cough syrup to mind ... not what i want out of a beer that be a bit on the pricey side .<ssssss>i would describe it as a hodge podge of weirdness -lrb- in a bad way -rrb- .<ssssss>m - not terrible , have a creamy feeling -lrb- kind of nitro-esque -rrb- .<ssssss>d - hard to say because the taste be so poor .<ssssss>i sip only a little at a time and it do not seem to go by fast enough ... final thought : do not bother , seriously , it be not worth it .<ssssss>there be much much better available in that price range .<ssssss>
7 6 4 6 6		it pour a handsome clear dark amber with a fairly thick , if not too persistent head .<ssssss>aroma be fairly strong and malty with a fruity undertone .<ssssss>flavor be fruity and malty , a bit on the thin side .<ssssss>texture be somewhat fizzy and a little watery .<ssssss>nevertheless , it be still palatable .<ssssss>
8 6 6 8 9		the beer pour well and look good in a stein .<ssssss>the beer be deceptively smooth , with just a slight bitter aftertaste .<ssssss>with just a 18 ibu and the lighter 4.5 abv it have great drinkability and be a good `` beginner '' dark beer .<ssssss>so if you have a friend that be hesitant about dark get they on this one .<ssssss>go out and have one for yourself !<ssssss>
6 8 7 9 7		pour into a standard pint glass .<ssssss>pour a pretty dark brown color .<ssssss>when hold up to the light it be slightly transparent and i can see the carbonation bubble that lead to a very small , less than one finger head .<ssssss>the small head that appear be a very light brown to tan color and do not leave much lace .<ssssss>smell be ... .<ssssss>well ... interesting .<ssssss>it kind of smell like my mother in law glaze ham at christmas time .<ssssss>there be a sweet syrupy smell , maybe brown sugar , and really ... like the ham glaze .<ssssss>honey , smoke .<ssssss>taste be really good .<ssssss>this be very unique but pull together quite nicely .<ssssss>sweet taste of the yam and some maple syrup , there be also some honey taste too .<ssssss>i think i should say that i be get some cook -lrb- or fry -rrb- pork fat .<ssssss>i really like this .<ssssss>mouth be thin and the carbonation be medium .<ssssss>body be delicate and the finish be on the dry side .<ssssss>overall i really enjoy this .<ssssss>i like how all of the other `` pumpkin '' beer try to taste like pumpkin pie , but never really do .<ssssss>this one try to taste like the fall or the fall holiday and really do .<ssssss>the smell and taste really do nail the smell and taste i get from the in-law house this time of year .<ssssss>if you love the fall and the holiday this be a must get .<ssssss>
7 6 8 6 6		this be a amber , carbonated beer with modest foam that quickly disappear .<ssssss>peach , peach , and more peach -- it be difficult to pick out any else from the peachy saturated aroma .<ssssss>a decent mouthfeel .<ssssss>the wheat character be definitely present , add some texture to the experience .<ssssss>the flavor be more in the sweet peach department with a dash of holiday spice at the end .<ssssss>sweetness and the extent of the peach be a bit too much for this beer enthusiast .<ssssss>
8 7 10 10 10		pour from a bomber into a pint glass during yet another 18 '' + snowstorm here in the philliy area .<ssssss>attractive label -lrb- i be a sucker for anything with a skull on it -rrb- but no date code provide .<ssssss>a - dark black-brown with a gorgeous tan-colored two inch head which dissipate much too quickly .<ssssss>s - much lighter coffee aroma than one would think .<ssssss>aroma be dominate by piny hop .<ssssss>t - smooth yummy blend of expresso and hop .<ssssss>great balance and smoothness contribute to : m - fantastic creamy mouthfeel .<ssssss>full but not heavy richness to this one .<ssssss>d - definitely not over-the-top like some chocolate or coffee stout and despite the 7.5 % abv , this one go down far too quickly .<ssssss>must find more !<ssssss>
8 9 6 9 8		a : one and a half finger head .<ssssss>leave nice lace .<ssssss>murky and golden amber .<ssssss>s : sweet and pleasant aroma .<ssssss>t : honey be weak however honey , in my experience , rarely can be sense .<ssssss>sweet , spicy , peppery and fruity .<ssssss>m : mild to moderate carbonation .<ssssss>thick body .<ssssss>very dry finish .<ssssss>o : i think i prefer they shapeshifter .<ssssss>saison be tyipically dry however this one be very much so .<ssssss>as saison go though , the taste be excellent , the dryer finish of the honey badger be the only turn off for I .<ssssss>
8 4 9 5 7		pour deep brown , turn black in the glass with a density that a touch light for the bourbon barrel beer , but denser than most porter .<ssssss>the age on this one have thin out the carbonation a touch , but still about a half inch of head , a bit of lacing , and the head linger well .<ssssss>strong sweet nose of vanila bourbon , nearly cold bottle of bourbon in nature .<ssssss>the finish be a powdery cocoa malt .<ssssss>hopefully it open up more as it warm .<ssssss>wow sickeningly sweet combination of sugar and bourbon with chocolate malt mix in .<ssssss>bourbon have just dominate this one and age have mellow -lrb- i assume -rrb- any of porter nature .<ssssss>i feel this porter just wasnt bold enough to handle this much bourbon aging .<ssssss>i should point out ive have issue with infection -lrb- or maybe arcadia just make awful explosive mess of beer -rrb- so perhaps part of the sweetness in here be something similar to what i notice with cocoa loco and big dick .<ssssss>smooth and creamy .<ssssss>this one drink well .<ssssss>medium thin for a bourbon barrel much like the appearance , but do the job .<ssssss>i really like this one .<ssssss>this be a awful awful example but this bourbon dominance here remind I a bit of goose island rare , you know without this be a pappy barrel and the beer base be most likely just a ok porter vs a world glass masterpiece of a stout .<ssssss>it also doesnt have the world class finish , in fact the finish be a touch lack .<ssssss>
7 6 5 7 8		12 ounce bottle from cost plus world market in redland pour be pretty dark brown with a small head that fade quickly not near as good as celebrator to I , but not bad smell be malty and full of sugar taste have a nice finish and be smooth with a little more sweetness than i anticipate could drink a six pack of these if you want to<ssssss>

8 9 6 7 8		a-dark brown w/nice creamy off-white head , decent retention , and lot of carbonation activity visible at bottom of snifter .<ssssss>s-complex multi-layered aroma : fruit note include raspberry , fig , date ; chocolate ; roasty/burnt malty backbone w/hint of sourness that complement the blend of dark fruit and sweet malt .<ssssss>could smell this all day .<ssssss>t & m-light sourness and fruitiness upfront that open up to a malty backbone midway that be balance by a sweet/sour/burnt sensation .<ssssss>the finish be slightly sweet and the aftertaste a little tart .<ssssss>carbonation be on the lighter side , but ample .<ssssss>body a little too light , and balance be evenly distribute .<ssssss>d-shocked I initially since i be not expect the style on the first sip , but it be quite good , refreshing , and even sessionable .<ssssss>i have no idea what the abv be , but i would guess around 5-6 % .<ssssss>
8 6 7 5 9		this be the storied mickey 's bigmouth 12oz bottle .<ssssss>i drink this in high school long before i know how to appreciate beer .<ssssss>i guess the novelty of the bottle be the reason .<ssssss>a pour from the 12 oz bigmouth bottle into my goblet .<ssssss>pale amber straw color brew with a bleched white head of 1 finger that settle to almost nothing quickly .<ssssss>heavyily carbvonate .<ssssss>this be a pretty beer in the sense of most american macro .<ssssss>s crisp clean slightly matly aroma .<ssssss>i be start to like this a lot more than i expect .<ssssss>t : ok here go : -lrb- long pause -rrb- not much here at all .<ssssss>this be more watery that anything else .<ssssss>i do catch just a note of bready taste .<ssssss>no sign of hop at all .<ssssss>m : watery .<ssssss>d : this be extemely drinkable .<ssssss>flow down to the gullet quick as you like .<ssssss>not a quality beer at all , almost devoid of flavor , but again oh so easy to drink .<ssssss>i guess it cater to a certain audience .<ssssss>will buy this again for time i want to slum it .<ssssss>
8 5 7 4 4		thanks to jrallen34 for this .<ssssss>pour a near black with a tan head .<ssssss>smell be initially a good amount of diacetyl .<ssssss>a little bit of hocolate and roasted malt in the background .<ssssss>taste be quite similar wig some butterscotch .<ssssss>taste like a popcorn jelly belly .<ssssss>not particularly good .<ssssss>mouhfeel be medium .<ssssss>drinkability be truly hamper by the off flavor .<ssssss>
5 3 5 5 6		this beer pour thin , with pretty much no head .<ssssss>the color be a pale yellow and the beer seem very carbonated with ton of bubble stick to the glass .<ssssss>the first smell be some what disturbing .<ssssss>smell of rotten wheat .<ssssss>the taste be similar to a cheap light beer .<ssssss>there be a little bit of hoppiness in as it hit the tongue which be the highlight but other than that very light and watery .<ssssss>easy to drink , but not very enjoyable .<ssssss>
6 5 7 8 6		embody the spirit , rhythm and pulse of jamaica ... .<ssssss>the true j' can beer !<ssssss>-lrb- say the bottle -rrb- appearance-into the imperial pint glass -lrb- why not ? -rrb-<ssssss>, yield a dark tan color with lot of foam that stick around .<ssssss>smell-corn and grain mostly , alcohol hit the nose as well .<ssssss>taste-very grainy on the palate , light flavor and alchohol hit immediately as carbonation settle , go down exceptionally smooth .<ssssss>while flavor be light , it also seem distinctive .<ssssss>mouthfeel-good , grainy but not strong , very smooth and light solid aftertaste on the palette drinkability-i be give it a average , because although this be a very drinkable lager it be expensive to get and not drunk all that much .<ssssss>overall-a slightly more than solid lager , it be adjunct fill but still retain a decent flavor and smooth quality and it be distinctive .<ssssss>however at $ 9.49 a sixpack at my local store i can not justify it , a interesting beer to try that should satisfy though , better than bud , miller , or coor and i will be damned if it do not wash down the spicy chicken wing i have incredibly well .<ssssss>
8 6 8 9 8		appearance pour a clear , clean dark crimson with very little head .<ssssss>smell faint malty sweetness and nut .<ssssss>taste very sweet and nutty , with a almost hazelnut character to it .<ssssss>some good lemony citrus come through as well .<ssssss>mouthfeel thick , clean , and wet .<ssssss>sound dirty , but there you have it .<ssssss>drinkability very drinkable .<ssssss>in fact , i drink it faster than i should have .<ssssss>between the sweetness and lemon note , and the very wet mouthfeel , this one can go down quick !<ssssss>overall extremely pleased with this one .<ssssss>have it on tap a few week prior and it be outstanding .<ssssss>better on tap , but very good in bottle .<ssssss>

8 5 6 5 8		-lrb- from note at brewery -rrb- aroma be surprisingly grapefruity for a stout with only hint of the roasted/chocolate character that i would expect to play a more prominent role .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a little to light , lighter so than they porter and seem to be generally lack .<ssssss>flavor be of hop more than they be about the malt and kind of put I off .<ssssss>a totally drinkable and a enjoyable beer , but since i be rating against the style , it get penalize .<ssssss>

7 7 2 5 4		growler ballast point brewing company san diego , can a glowing and clear amber with shades of red throughout .<ssssss>thin white head perch atop with little lacing .<ssssss>not a ton of carbonation or stick .<ssssss>the nose be this beer 's best characteristic .<ssssss>there be a array of citrus note predominantly orange , grapefruit , and mango , along with a punch of melon , yet quite a bit of alcohol be very present in the nose as well .<ssssss>the taste , however , fall away sharply and disappointingly from the vault ground the aroma sit atop .<ssssss>the hop bitterness and some citrus element be here but this mainly consist of palette-wrecking , liquor-like alcohol burn .<ssssss>unpleasant .<ssssss>thin , oily , and slick in the mouth .<ssssss>go down like liquor ; harsh .<ssssss>i would be want to try this beer for a very , very long time .<ssssss>as a huge fan of sculpin , i imagine this beer would find its way in to very similar herald ground .<ssssss>i disappointingly miss it at churchill 's when it be on tap a few month ago .<ssssss>when i get the e-mail yesterday about a new batch of dorado , i rush to the brewery asap and be the first to try the new batch .<ssssss>i even have to wait as they tap the first keg and erase tongue buckler off they overhead board so they could add dorado in its place .<ssssss>i want to like this beer , and i do not .<ssssss>now i be wonder what to do with the last half of a unwanted growler .<ssssss>very disappointing .<ssssss>-lrb- as strange as this sound for a dipa , this beer seem like a perfect candidate for aging .<ssssss>if i would buy bomber instead of a growler , i would cellar the remainder . -rrb-<ssssss>

7 7 7 5 7		a - pour a terrific burnt orange color , with minimal head .<ssssss>very little fizziness , which be surprising give the taste .<ssssss>s - i pour this beer into a brandy snifter on a lark , there be only still a very light scent of hop , and almost hidden note of honey , orange , and even a little pollen .<ssssss>t - the taste be of soda water mix with a lot of meady honey and a note of orange .<ssssss>there be hardly any maltiness at all and only the vaguest notion of hop .<ssssss>i would love to say more , but it be incredibly one-dimensional .<ssssss>m - a little watery , and very fizzy , but with a cloying thickness from the honey .<ssssss>go down easy , and leave just a light hint of honey on the tongue .<ssssss>d - the snifter actually turn out to be a good idea , since this be pretty much my dessert for the night .<ssssss>it be too sweet to be consistently easy drinking and i can not imagine down more than one or two of these at a time .<ssssss>since this brewery be a one-trick pony , they would have be better off use a maltier beer to house what seem to be pretty high-quality honey .<ssssss>
4 8 7 6 5		thoma hardy 's ale - 2007 no .<ssssss>p15601 edition i must say , for all the hype and beautiful packaging i have high expectation for this brew .<ssssss>that be say , i feel somewhat let down and that i be make excuse for my dislikes .<ssssss>it pour with no carbonation to speak of , but syrupy thick .<ssssss>the more time i spend with this one , it remind I more of a wine than a beer .<ssssss>very fragrant with nutty sweet scent that be close to a affligem or ommegang double .<ssssss>sweet , and alcoholic with a tart after taste , but a smooth thick mouthfeel .<ssssss>deep caramel , wood resin and orange spice flavor dominate and be cut with the alcohol .<ssssss>all thing consider , particularly the fondness people have for cellare this beer , i will not have much trouble lay off the rest of the four pack for a few year .<ssssss>

5 5 8 9 9		recommend this beer by the owner at hv bottle shop in durham , nc ... pour a crisp , clear orange color ... head go away almost immediately make the beer appear flat ... smell of distinct , cereal grain and caramel malt ... alcohol smell be prominent ... very bitter for a apa , undoubtedly from the advertised hop balance ... a very crisp drink , especially nice on the porch during a hot night ... the only thing be the beer seem to lack a distinct character ... the malt and hop `` balance '' seem to be compete ... just slightly ... the alcohol smell be pretty strong during each drink ... but all in all , this be a delightful brew ... will buy again , and you should enjoy sweetwater 's flagship beer ... glad its in nc ...<ssssss>
8 10 6 7 6		this be a good beer , certainly overhyped though .<ssssss>well , its hard not to be over hype when its the most hyped beer in the world but what can you do .<ssssss>appearance : nice color , true to style .<ssssss>smell : fantastic , lot of citrus , pine and bubble gum .<ssssss>a little hint of sweetness and no apparent alcohol smell .<ssssss>taste : nice and bright and hoppy .<ssssss>there be a strong piney taste on the finish and not much else .<ssssss>it be decently balanced but could use some more malt backbone .<ssssss>mouthfeel : its a little dry on the palate not as much as blind pig , also it have some astringency that make the overall coating of the mouth not as good as it should be .<ssssss>drinkability : for a double ipa it be fairly drinkable but with the mouthfeel issue that i have with it i think that it certainly be not a everyday beer .<ssssss>if you find this beer try it , but its not the best around .<ssssss>
7 7 4 6 5		it be not really clear what the brewer -lrb- or more likely the marketer -rrb- be go for with this one ... call this a `` single style '' abbey ale seem a confused reference to a enkel , the base beer for a abbey 's other style ... but this be about as far from rochefort 6 as could be ... for full sacreligous effect , pour from a 12oz bottle into my westvleteren goblet .<ssssss>nearly clear rusty copper body with a thin khaki head .<ssssss>decent retention , thin pasty lacing .<ssssss>toast malt and toffee in the nose along with very faint golden raisin and wheat note .<ssssss>a little bland but not unpleasant .<ssssss>flavor go through a unusual progression from initially sharp , vaguely acidic -lrb- from wheat -rrb- and nearly metallic into a increasingly malty , dough-y , and sweet finish .<ssssss>caramel , toast , and a big dose of wheat come through in the finish along with hint of banana and orange zest .<ssssss>thin , fizzy mouthfeel .<ssssss>spritzy but in no way effervescent .<ssssss>very drinkable , but quite unfocused .<ssssss>i would rate this lower if i really think they be try to brew a `` dubbel , '' but as a generic misguided `` abbey ale '' this be more flavorful than much of new belgium 's regular offering for example ...<ssssss>

9 10 8 6 8		back home , we have access to some bell 's beer , but first time cross path with this one .<ssssss>drunk straight from the bottle in my hotel room in east lanse michigan , because drinking beer out of a coffee cup or slurpee cup just be not right .<ssssss>however , stout be like baby , they be all beautiful unless something go wrong , so expedition get the benefit of the doubt on appearance .<ssssss>bottle or no , the aroma isf reakin ' spectacular .<ssssss>deep hint of bourbon , malt , alcohol .<ssssss>i want to snort this beer .<ssssss>despite a excellent , syrupy mouthfeel , there be something vaguely medicinal about expedition in the mouth , so while the taste be not bad , it be not spectacular .<ssssss>yes , i would absolutely do this beer again , but as far as stout go it be not quite up there with , say , yeti or surly darkness .<ssssss>

9 7 6 9 8		big thanks to gawnphishin for the chance to try this .<ssssss>very cool wwii-esque line-art graphic on the label -lrb- depict the brewmaster 's grandfather i think -rrb- .<ssssss>pour from a wax 22oz bomber into my dogfish head shaped pint glass .<ssssss>bottle conditioned i presume consider the enormous heft of rocky sponge-like foam that fill the glass despite a careful pour .<ssssss>eventually it settle down to a messy smattering of light tan suds cover a very dark brown yet clear liquid with very faint rufous highlight .<ssssss>superior retention , sticky thick lacing .<ssssss>roast malt have a woodsy aroma along with faint cocoa and vanilla .<ssssss>there be some caramel as well , though this could be a hint of diacetyl .<ssssss>very rich coffee , light smoke , faint toffee and bittersweet chocolate -lrb- as note by the brewer -rrb- , and a array of well blended specialty malt .<ssssss>dry lightly bitter finish with somewhat grassy hop note and maybe a whisper of citrus .<ssssss>mildly astringent , crisp , though perhaps over-carbonate for the style .<ssssss>unique , bold , and flavorful porter - it taste like some `` imperial '' porter i have have except without the high abv or heavy roast quality , which keep the drinkability high .<ssssss>worth seek out - this would be a regular purchase for I if i live in the region -lrb- especially if i lack access to anchor , deschute , etc -rrb- .<ssssss>

8 6 9 8 8		appearance : the whimsically label baby tree pour out a clouded , very dark brown body with a tall , creep , light beige head .<ssssss>smell : a maltiness that be dark , bready but , when combine with the sweet-smelling and spice aspect of the nose , take on a seasonal spice cake scent .<ssssss>however , the aroma be not , at any point , particularly profuse , kind of mild , in fact .<ssssss>taste : a spicy coating of freshly-grated cinnamon and earthy nutmeg atop oven-toasted bread and lightly roasted grain .<ssssss>sprinkling of sticky dark brown sugar .<ssssss>fruitiness akin to date and prune skin , though there be also a small hint of banana-flavored bubble gum lurk within .<ssssss>a bit more table sugar .<ssssss>pick up a bitterness near the end that , with the aid of a cut vein of alcohol , help to temper the initial sweetness for the spicy finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel : medium-full body and a medium-plus carbonation combine for a somewhat hefty mouthfeel .<ssssss>drinkability : it be nice .<ssssss>a interesting brew that grow on you as easily as farm-fresh baby in a tree .<ssssss>
8 10 7 8 9		a : i would not measure this head be finger , i would do it in mile .<ssssss>pour 12 oz into a 22 oz hefe glass and could not fit it all .<ssssss>the foam be white and creamy look , beautiful .<ssssss>the beer itself though be a little too clear in some part .<ssssss>instead of really dissipate through the beer , the yeast be hang in arm and wisp .<ssssss>s : a very rich banana/clove mix , just about perfect .<ssssss>no hop , no nothing .<ssssss>not even that yeasty smell you get on some hefe .<ssssss>it be a rich , creamy smell , if that make sense , something i would expect from a banana milk shake or something .<ssssss>yum .<ssssss>t : less perfect .<ssssss>still a good banana/clove mix , but i get some off flavor as well , not many , but some .<ssssss>maybe something buttery ?<ssssss>still no hop , but no malt really either .<ssssss>not even a biscuity or wheaty one .<ssssss>this beer be really dominate by the yeast .<ssssss>m : on the thin side of creamy , but still feel smooth as if it be creamy , there be no crisp bite .<ssssss>i wish there be .<ssssss>seem to be almost a winter hefe ... d : great , for a hefe this be very light on carbonation , something that can easily turn I off for drinkability .<ssssss>a good flavor a good everything .<ssssss>
8 7 7 6 9		12 oz .<ssssss>black/brown pour .<ssssss>just off white head .<ssssss>roasted malt aroma , some chocolate , some hop presence .<ssssss>roasted flavor , mild chocolate , could have be more abundant .<ssssss>maybe too much hop in this one .<ssssss>a little light body , but now watery .<ssssss>clean finish .<ssssss>drinkability be obviously pretty high .<ssssss>if you have a choice , get they double chocolate stout instead .<ssssss>
6 4 2 2 4		i would never want to suggest that someone drink natty light , but i must admit that when i be a young lad in college for the first year i have my fair share of this shit back in ' 97 / '98 .<ssssss>i guess if all you have be about ten buck in weatherford , ok pick up a case of this and have a ball .<ssssss>warning : natty must be consume in mass consumption because you for sure want those taste bud to be deaden when this cold gold be pour into you mouth .<ssssss>
6 7 7 8 6		serve in bottle form at na brasa brazilian steakhouse .<ssssss>i hear the owner be portuguese and figure i would give this one a try .<ssssss>smell be light , mostly of roasted meat due to venue but unremarkable otherwise .<ssssss>taste be sweet and with the familiar earthy hop bitterness of stella .<ssssss>its good , a taste i prefer to most macro .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit heavier than common for style .<ssssss>there be a slight heft to the body and carbonation .<ssssss>drinkability be average for style , but it do help to wash down the sausage , lamb leg & chop , filet , chicken wrap in bacon etc i enjoy heartily .<ssssss>not as much as jill enjoy the lamb though .<ssssss>
8 8 9 7 6		pour from 12oz bottle into a tulip .<ssssss>appearance : rich golden-yellow hue with a fair cloudiness to the body and plenty of apparent effervescence .<ssssss>head be two finger of creamy light-ivory foam .<ssssss>a pretty good look package , i would say .<ssssss>smell : fruity with touch of pear and apple and actually a fair portion of hefeweizen-like banana and clove .<ssssss>there be a chalkiness which i like , although there be also a little bit of band-aid encroach on the flavor which do not precisely help it .<ssssss>still , a nice-smelling american take on the tripel .<ssssss>taste : the flavor be ok , but it do not make the best impression on I .<ssssss>fruitiness be a little raw and the band-aid be a bit stronger , plus the alcohol burn be a bit on the strong side as well .<ssssss>some of the flavor profile be ok , and it retain a lightness which be appropriate , but the overall effect be not wonderful .<ssssss>mouthfeel : the reason i buy tripel .<ssssss>merry monk ' ale manage a extremely well-integrated carbonation which turn its somewhat full , sticky body into a deliciously creamy treat .<ssssss>my favorite part of this beer , hand down .<ssssss>drinkability : this beer have a lot go for it , particularly the feel and , to a lesser extent , the aroma ; however , its harshness of flavor really do detract from the experience .<ssssss>i would not go out of my way to have this again .<ssssss>
7 7 5 4 4		thanks to mattafett for this beer !<ssssss>pour from 750 into tulip ; best by sept 2011 date ... a - pour kind of like a hazy imperial red - amber color with tint of light brown .<ssssss>very large foamy , overzealous head .<ssssss>s - smell like natural cocoa mix with a more process milk chocolatearoma .<ssssss>hershey chocolate shaving ... t/m - chocolatey and bitter , but still very alcoholy .<ssssss>perhaps the abv be too high .<ssssss>end with very strong vegetable flavor .<ssssss>can green bean or edemame would be accurate for the linger taste that be less than please .<ssssss>i like the chocolate perspective , but the rest be not my cup of tea .<ssssss>light/medium body .<ssssss>i feel like , the alcohol burn make it sting the tongue .<ssssss>o - be this past its prime , or just be it never ?<ssssss>i do not enjoy this , nor do the other 2 i share this .<ssssss>have too high of hope , but i be still glad i get to try !<ssssss>
7 8 8 6 8		the beer pour a very pale golden color , more the color i now associate with a pale ale or a light american lager , slightly lighter than the typical ipa you find these day .<ssssss>a half inch white head .<ssssss>nice aroma of hop and well hop .<ssssss>not a lot of malt backbone here to balance out the beer .<ssssss>base on the color and the smell , you be hard press to expect any malt flavor .<ssssss>citrusy .<ssssss>bitter hop flavor from start to finish , nothing sweet or malty or caramelly , and nothing else go on to balance out the hop .<ssssss>citrusy throughout .<ssssss>carbonation be nice , but basically just deliver the bitter kick .<ssssss>light beer attitude but with hop .<ssssss>drinkable for sure , and it serve the purpose of provide I with the hop flavor i want that night , but i would have be a fan of more balance or at least something to go with the light hoppy bitter thing .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 9		i think this be a very good beer just not a good example of a oatmeal stout .<ssssss>the flavor have a lot of roasty chocolatey flavor but the silky mouthfeel be not present .<ssssss>a very good session beer with all the flavor you would want i enjoy this beer though and screw guidline , i would have it again .<ssssss>
7 3 5 5 5		sagre be a beer that just didnt do it for I ... .<ssssss>tough on the pallete and nose .<ssssss>the appearance be nice , golden clear with white head that lace on my glass .<ssssss>the smell be slightly skunky and very grainy that have a twang .<ssssss>the taste be similar to the smell very grainy .<ssssss>mouthfeel be affect by the strong grain smell and taste .<ssssss>
5 8 9 8 8		pour brown cloudy with the yeast floasting through , small white head lace , but disappear quickly .<ssssss>not a pretty beer .<ssssss>aroma of carmel sweetness and a touch of citrus hop .<ssssss>taste be good , creamy carmel backbone balance the citrus hop well .<ssssss>mouthfeel be nice creamy and chewey especially for a ipa .<ssssss>i could drink this beer often , i like it very much and as i think it be not pretty i think people need to get beyond that and taste it with you eye shut , very good beer imo .<ssssss>
7 6 9 7 8		a - kind of difficult to build the head but i manage to and it look nice even though it do not last very long .<ssssss>very slightly hazy copper become very hazy with the addition of the yeast .<ssssss>s - sweet cantaloupe which i like but woody hop and brewer 's yeast which i do not as much .<ssssss>t - i be very thirsty can not wait to taste this .<ssssss>sweet red licorice and cantaloupe with with a harsh bitter finish .<ssssss>not really harsh because it so bitter but just ... harsh .<ssssss>not the flavor i usually look for in a ipa .<ssssss>pretty good after-taste .<ssssss>m - good full mouthfeel .<ssssss>pretty high carbonation and dry finish .<ssssss>almost syrupy when warm .<ssssss>d - good .<ssssss>easy and fun to drink .<ssssss>i do not really like it but could probably drink a bunch .<ssssss>after tasting the great brewer 's selection from amb , i be kind of disappoint by this one and the american pale ale from the classique pack .<ssssss>do not think i will buy it again but still think it be a good product .<ssssss>
8 6 9 6 9		12oz brown bottle with no freshness date .<ssssss>golden and completely clear with a thick layer of white head on top , a good look lager .<ssssss>malty sweet aroma with a hint of honey , herbal hop and a fresh grassiness within .<ssssss>fantastic smoothness off of this moderate bodied beer .<ssssss>malty and perhaps a little sweet but more bready and dry hay flavor .<ssssss>some sweetness do come from a remnant spec of honey which also bring a splash of warm alcohol .<ssssss>finish with a clean graininess and faint honey .<ssssss>a tight little bock , oddly i would prefer to drink this beer on a day like today which reach a swelter 90 * f than in the winter .<ssssss>either way this be good drinking here .<ssssss>
8 6 7 9 8		receive as a extra in a trade with masterchiefmd-thanks much !<ssssss>pour with little head , nice light copper color.very drinkable barleywine .<ssssss>low bitterness on the front head with pleasant aroma on the finish .<ssssss>taste very pleasant green remind I of marijuana flavor , or so i have be tell ; -rrb- i could drink several of these in one sit .<ssssss>as a barleywine , this one be a bit lack in body and malt for some ba 's but i will definitely pick up more of this next time i visit friend in dc .<ssssss>
6 4 5 6 5		pour into a pilsener glass .<ssssss>tower white head .<ssssss>beer be a rich golden color with lot of carbonation .<ssssss>this have a very slight skunkiness about it and the hoppiness come on the back of the taste in a muted bitter way that be not integrate with the front .<ssssss>overall the beer be not bad , it just be not any good and certainly not worth import price .<ssssss>it be a boring euro lager with no character or personality .<ssssss>no wonder it be -lrb- or be -rrb- trendy in manhattan .<ssssss>i really have yet to find a green bottled beer that i like .<ssssss>save you money and buy sam adam boston lager .<ssssss>
8 6 6 8 6		pour into a stein with a solid 6 inch of foamy head .<ssssss>the first 2 dissipate quickly , the next 2 take about a minute , and the last 2 hold on for dear life .<ssssss>it definitely live up to the `` golden '' part of its name .<ssssss>nice look beer .<ssssss>smell be not strong , either out of the bottle or the glass .<ssssss>all i can detect be sort of a generic `` this be beer '' aroma .<ssssss>taste , on the other hand , be excellent .<ssssss>at first , it be like take a bit of a really flavorful piece of bread -lrb- and with that head , you pretty much can take a bite out of it . -rrb-<ssssss>the alcohol be present , but balance by a nice sweetness .<ssssss>my only complaint be that it have some hoppiness , but it be concentrate in the foam - the beer itself lack that flavor , leave it predominantly sweet .<ssssss>if the whole beer taste like the foam , it would be truly remarkable .<ssssss>the sweetness be a bit cloying , which hurt mouthfeel a bit .<ssssss>drinkability have nothing to recommend it one way or another .<ssssss>all tell , this beer be on the edge of greatness , but do not quite seal the deal .<ssssss>it be quite enjoyable , but it coulda be a contender .<ssssss>
8 10 9 10 7		wow .<ssssss>as i open the bottle , the grapefruity hop aroma hit I immediately .<ssssss>after i pour it into a glass , i be reluctant to drink it because it smell so damn good .<ssssss>the first sip taste so good that it send chill down my spine .<ssssss>the hop dominate the flavor ; i could not taste the alcohol at all , and the malt add just enough sweetness to balance out the bitter aftertaste of the hop .<ssssss>this be the best beer i have have , but i be a hop-lover .<ssssss>i will definitely have to sample some of stone 's other product .<ssssss>
6 6 6 4 6		not much to say on this one .<ssssss>it be a cheap lager .<ssssss>it look like a cheap lager .<ssssss>taste like a cheap lager .<ssssss>have the mouth feel of a cheap lager .<ssssss>if you pour it into a cheap glass you will discover the head of a cheap lager .<ssssss>for $ 7.99 a 12-pack you can not really expect any better .<ssssss>if you be look for a better beer you will have to pay a better beer price .<ssssss>while i do not enjoy this beer necessarily it be exactly what you should expect .<ssssss>
9 8 5 4 5		pour into a pint glass .<ssssss>4.5 a : pour a dark brown/black like motor oil that have be partially use .<ssssss>can not see through it at all .<ssssss>thick , frothy , creamy head that retain well .<ssssss>4.0 s : pumpkin , pumpkin spice be most intense , follow by coffee and chocolate .<ssssss>hint of earthy hop .<ssssss>2.0 t : typical tasteless stout backbone .<ssssss>taste more like a pumpkin flavored coke than beer .<ssssss>coke that have be open a week ago .<ssssss>there be a little bit of coffee and some chocolate , but not enough .<ssssss>not enough of anything really .<ssssss>2.5 m : medium body .<ssssss>not nearly as creamy as i would have expect and hardly any carbonation -lrb- even for a stout -rrb- .<ssssss>2.5 d : it do not taste bad , but it be boring as hell .<ssssss>at least keystone light evoke some kind of reaction -lrb- kind of like how i would prefer pain over paralysis -rrb- .<ssssss>i must be some kind of genetic mutant .<ssssss>there be no other way of explain why people like this beer -lrb- or most other stout -rrb- so damn much .<ssssss>i think there be a stout gene that allow you to taste flavor in stout that i apparently do not have .<ssssss>
6 9 6 10 9		review from note : p : big head with great white lacing and retention .<ssssss>a cloudy golden yellow color with streaming bubble .<ssssss>s : herb , orange and lavender , spice very evident .<ssssss>t : tart orange with mild malt flavoring .<ssssss>great bubble and a wonderful mix of herb and spice .<ssssss>the flavor compliment each other nicely .<ssssss>champagne like and very refreshing .<ssssss>o : 1st witbier and will not be my last .<ssssss>very impressed with this brew and will enjoy more in the future .<ssssss>
8 9 6 10 8		split with mjyoung .<ssssss>appearance - no foam or head when pour .<ssssss>it appear to have a watery consistency .<ssssss>color be a deep dark brown .<ssssss>smell - heavy roasted barley aroma along with the alcohol smell you would expect from a strong ale .<ssssss>taste - very rich .<ssssss>have smoky and nutty flavor follow with a light alcohol aftertaste .<ssssss>mouthfeel - quite flat .<ssssss>avoid this beer if you prefer a well-carbonated beer .<ssssss>drinkability - smoother than what i expect .<ssssss>a great winter beer in my opinion as i gulped this down after spend time outside in the cold .<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 8		on tap at the black bear bistro in warrenton , va very nice ruby amber color generally a good balance between malty and bitter hop , which be exactly what i want in this style of beer .<ssssss>lack the complexity for a higher rating , but certainly worth drinking .<ssssss>i have also have this in a bottle , much better on tap .<ssssss>
8 8 8 10 7		a : pour a marigold orange and less of a brown ale color as many pumpkin ale appear .<ssssss>s : roasted pumpkin , burnt brown sugar and butter .<ssssss>t : most pumpkin like beer i have drink and i believe i have try just about every pumpkin ale out there .<ssssss>taste like a oven roasted pumpkin with bitterness to boot .<ssssss>butter graham cracker essence with spiciness and a nice smooth finish .<ssssss>m : medium mouthfeel .<ssssss>not as thick as some brown ale , but not water down like some of the shipyard variety pumpkin ale .<ssssss>d : as i think most pumpkin ale should be , this be a nice sipper .<ssssss>i wouldnt drink three of they but that be how i believe pumpkin ale should be .<ssssss>especially at a 9.0 % abv .<ssssss>great job by st<ssssss>
7 6 6 8 7		pour from a bottle into my black butte pint glass .<ssssss>beer pour a transparent ligh amber color with a nice two finger snow white head .<ssssss>head disipate and leave a small amount of lacing .<ssssss>smell be a tad on the sweet side and a little malty .<ssssss>not a whole lot go on in the nose for I .<ssssss>taste be good .<ssssss>toast malt follow by a better than expect hoppiness , provide a bitter finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel be ok , but a bit thin and watery .<ssssss>drinkabilty be good .<ssssss>this would be a easy drinker in session bender .<ssssss>overall , i like this beer , but i do not have anything to compare it to .<ssssss>not sure i have ever have another steam beer .<ssssss>so my rating pretty much only reflect how i feel about the beer .<ssssss>in conclusion , for a lager that be fairly light in color , i be pleasantly surprise .<ssssss>
8 4 8 6 8		taste from 12oz can .<ssssss>pour golden with a one-finger white head that have some stay power .<ssssss>nose be somewhat skunky with some sweet malt and anise .<ssssss>flavor be light with some malt and a very light hoppiness .<ssssss>the body be light with average carbonation and a pretty short finish .<ssssss>despite the lack of any complexity , this beer be actually very enjoyable .<ssssss>
7 5 6 8 8		12 oz .<ssssss>bottle , $ 1.22 at hi-time , a : pour a macro yellow , basically , with a full white head , which have surprsingly good retention .<ssssss>s : very light , with some malt and lime , a bit earthy .<ssssss>t : pretty tasty beer , light biscuit malt open up the beer which end with the kaffir lime , which do not taste artificial , that be surprising in a coor product , a nice complement to the overall flavour .<ssssss>m : light and crisp , watery , but refreshing .<ssssss>d : do not know why they be release a spring beer in january , but i think coor do a pretty good job with this one , a lot better than they winter offering .<ssssss>
9 8 10 8 9		look just about perfect for the style .<ssssss>glowing bronzed orange color , like a sunset , with a glaring white head that be creamy and remain present for the duration .<ssssss>leave big splat of lace as it slowly chill out .<ssssss>aroma be finely balanced between sweet buttery/caramel-like malt and big herbal hop .<ssssss>malt actually remind I of candied popcorn , like fiddle faddle or something .<ssssss>while the taste tread the high wire between hop attack and malt sweetness the same way the aroma do , the hop edge out the malt on the tongue .<ssssss>consider the style , they ought to .<ssssss>and those hop be big and resiny with equal nod to citrus rind and pine tree branch .<ssssss>a minty flavor reign in the otherwise bitter and candy-sweet finish .<ssssss>without feel heavy , this have both a creaminess and stickiness that work well to match the aggressive hop profile and carry the candy-like malt sweetness that ride along .<ssssss>bitter and resiny in a way that inseparably weld flavor to texture , and really help define the beer .<ssssss>feel-wise , it be magnificent .<ssssss>while my description of the taste sound like the description of a big-ass double ipa , it manage to pack in a lot of flavor without go imperial .<ssssss>the sensible abv help with that , and this be basically a all-around excellent , clearly california-fied version of the style .<ssssss>another fine brew from the typically hop-heavy moylan .<ssssss>
6 4 6 6 6		the scent be too malty and coffee-ish for I .<ssssss>it feel very syrupy and thick in the mouth , and the taste be off-putting at first , but mellow out soon after to be sort of refreshing .<ssssss>this be not something i would drink very often .<ssssss>in fact , if it do not have alcohol , i would never drink it .<ssssss>
2 10 4 6 8		i have this beer so many time and never catch a buzz except for walk funny like a stereotypical gay guy you would see on tv .<ssssss>a : its beer .<ssssss>that all i can say .<ssssss>s : everything a beer should smell like .<ssssss>hop , alcohol , barley , and yeast .<ssssss>t : light and very crisp .<ssssss>i actually say `` ahhh : after the first couple of sip .<ssssss>m : crisp , refreshing , light and a bit of carbonation .<ssssss>d : its decent .<ssssss>dont expect to get a `` head buzz '' type of drunk though .<ssssss>its ideal for a cook out where you will be eat and drink a lot but do not wan na vomit .<ssssss>the beer be that nice and light .<ssssss>also refresh after a long day .<ssssss>i wouldnt recommend buy it unless you be outdoors a lot .<ssssss>
9 8 8 10 9		i have it at mac 's speed shop on south blvd in charlotte nc .<ssssss>a - the bottle be hip and cool .<ssssss>the beer have have a light brown color .<ssssss>s - it have a nice clam smell .<ssssss>nothing special t - have a great taste .<ssssss>not to bold but have flavor m - nothing stand out abt the mouthfeel<ssssss>
8 10 6 6 6		appearance : pour a burnt caramel clear body with a tan head that drop to a ringlet and some island and leave a little lacing behind smell : burnt caramel , dry dark fruit and fusel alcohol taste : sweet caramel as you swirl it in the mouth , the beast roar back after the swallow with a gush of alcoholic warmth and hoppy bitterness ; the warmth persist after a few dry swallow as well mouthfeel : thick , astringent and warm ; modest carbonation drinkability : look good , smell great , not drinkable yet ; maybe in a few year after this beast settle down<ssssss>
6 7 5 4 4		pour from a bomber into my deschute tulip ... a - pour black , with a minimal head that fade almost as fast as it appear .<ssssss>s - have a slightly roasty , nutty aroma with hint of dark chocolate and vanilla in the background .<ssssss>t - the taste do not go with the smell at all .<ssssss>it be very thin , and not much flavor at all .<ssssss>a slight roasty coffee aroma , but sadly that be about it .<ssssss>m - as state before , thin and watery .<ssssss>lack in carbonation .<ssssss>o - avoid this one .<ssssss>i pay $ 6 for this bottle , and it be not worth half of that .<ssssss>this beer lack in character , flavor , and everything else in between .<ssssss>i be not try to bash , but this be a very poor porter .<ssssss>
8 5 3 6 6		i drink this one just below room temperature , where i think may beer taste the best and can really show off they flavor , especially pale beer like this .<ssssss>in a pint glass this pilsner be a lovely pure gold transparency .<ssssss>a short head of white foam recede quickly .<ssssss>there be a unusual lack of bubble just a minute after pour .<ssssss>there be maybe a dozen big pocket cling to the side of the glass and little bubble rise only one at a time .<ssssss>nice look beer , love the bright golden hue .<ssssss>smell nice : sweet grain with mild hop .<ssssss>nothing particularly noteworthy .<ssssss>just like the smell there be a good balance between sweetness and bitterness on the tongue .<ssssss>there be a very slight bit of sharp , sour hop but not much else .<ssssss>mouthtaste : flat , watery .<ssssss>i would compare this to budweiser ; blvd .<ssssss>win on color and flavor and aroma be about the same with a little more maltiness to this pilsner .<ssssss>

8 6 8 9 10		i be not a big fan of pumpkin ale .<ssssss>i find they for the most part to be very sweet and over spice .<ssssss>i also find clove to be nauseating .<ssssss>when this be pour into a small glass for I i be very wary .<ssssss>it pour slightly darker than most pumpkin ale and have a spicy chai scent with pertrude clove aroma .<ssssss>taste be out of this world though .<ssssss>somehow the pumpkin compliment the spice and actually be incredibly mellow .<ssssss>very drinkable with little to no alcohol present .<ssssss>the only pumpkin ale that i would recommend .<ssssss>
8 8 10 9 7		i be lucky enough to get to try this on cask at a taco mac stone beer dinner here in atlanta .<ssssss>a : extremely dark brown with ruby highlight around the edge .<ssssss>very minimal head but what be there leave some lacing on the glass .<ssssss>s : smell pretty similar to liquid smoke .<ssssss>you can pick up a bit of the spice from the pepper as well which set be apart a bit for the style .<ssssss>t : peaty smoky flavor with a huge spicy character from the pepper in the finish .<ssssss>you mouth start to heat up quite a bit with every swallow .<ssssss>since i like spicy food this be right up my alley and go perfectly with the hanger steak the chef prepare .<ssssss>m : the unbelievable spicy warmth in the finish and the smooth nature of the beer itself give this one a ton of interest in term of mouthfeel for I .<ssssss>d : the spiciness be great to I for flavor and mouthfeel , but it also cause it to loose a bit here since it be a bit of a sipper .<ssssss>i be really happy i have a chance to try such a rare treat from stone .<ssssss>steve wagner be at the dinner and say that every batch be different since they use pepper from they garden and we definitely get a hotter batch .<ssssss>i be glad we do : -rrb-<ssssss>
7 4 7 6 6		pour a clear orange/light amber with a 3/4 finger white head that dissipate a little fast and leave no lacing at all .<ssssss>smell be a bit of stale wheat and pineapple .<ssssss>almost skunk but it be not really the same smell .<ssssss>kind of that cheap beer smell .<ssssss>taste be not as bad as the smell .<ssssss>still get that cheap taste , especially on the way down , but there be at least a noticeable malt and hop presence there .<ssssss>medium-light body good carbonation , mouthfeel be probably the only part of this beer that i really enjoy .<ssssss>this review be for the version bottled in south carolina .<ssssss>i really need to get down to the brewery and tell they to end they contract because it be not help they from what i have be read .<ssssss>
8 7 5 8 7		hazy yellow with a monster white head .<ssssss>head recede , but do not go away entirely .<ssssss>lot of visible carbonation happen in the glass .<ssssss>most notable in the aroma be citrus zest and unibroue 's signature yeast .<ssssss>coriander also take a strong part .<ssssss>a little too zesty to sit and smell over and over , but still nice .<ssssss>a abundance of wheat malt in the flavour , sweet fruitiness first follow by a tangy hop finish .<ssssss>peppery spice in the lasting flavour .<ssssss>i find it finish a bit on the wet side for a wheat beer , but that do not take away from this one .<ssssss>the body be light and smooth , and it start with a abundance of carbonation .<ssssss>i have find that at about halfway through the glass , the beer be start to feel a little flat , as if the carbonation burn out too fast .<ssssss>a nice easy drinker from unibroue , certainly a good example of the style .<ssssss>
10 6 8 9 9		from the bottle as soon as i pop the cap get a big wiff of sweetness like brown sugar and a strong alcohol .<ssssss>pour mahogany with a light tan head that leave some lacing .<ssssss>aroma the sweetness and alcohol go away out come a sour cherry smell , than chocolate , malt , and spice .<ssssss>flavor a lot better than tha aroma , creamy chocolate dark fruit , molasses , with a nice touch of coffee and a slight bitterness in the finish .<ssssss>that flavor bring the rating up on this beergood beer<ssssss>
7 8 9 10 8		pour a copper orange color , small amount of foam on top that wrap around the edge of the glass .<ssssss>the head do not stick to the side of the glass and quickly run down the side as i swirl the glass .<ssssss>not what i expect judge by the smell and alcohol volume .<ssssss>i make the mistake of pour the `` floaty '' in this , i will know better next time .<ssssss>smell of clove , definitely raisin , fruit , spice , & malty brown candy sugar .<ssssss>if this be even detectable or possible , the beer smell complex .<ssssss>the taste ... ahhh ... the taste !<ssssss>all i can say be , `` wow '' , pretty amazing .<ssssss>detect prune , raisin , faint vanilla , a slight touch of orange -lrb- very slight -rrb- , brown sugar .<ssssss>medium body , creamy smooth finish and a warm down the throat from the boozy character of this high octane seasonal .<ssssss>i really wrestle with age this bottle for a year but could not wait , i love the scaldis brew and do not have the willpower for the aging process .<ssssss>this be very drinkable and on a empty stomach , it be pretty much kick my butt .<ssssss>i could not imagine a bottle bigger than the tiny 8.5 oz ' r it come in .<ssssss>nicely do , i think this just become my favorite christmas brew .<ssssss>
7 5 7 9 9		the only non positive about 312 be it do not give a person much clue by the smell as to what it be about , other than that , this be one good , smooth drinking sessionable beer .<ssssss>very wheaty and you can see this in the glass , all kind of wheat particle float in the glass .<ssssss>very clean , almost sweet , but not cloying and highly refreshing .<ssssss>great beer for the spring and summer .<ssssss>
6 6 5 4 6		okay , this be no dopplebock .<ssssss>it be more like a lager or a weiss than anything .<ssssss>lightly color with a medium head .<ssssss>head retention be fair but not thick as one might expect .<ssssss>i find it disappointing in the fruitiness .<ssssss>way too sweet with little backbone .<ssssss>slightly malty with not much in the way of hop flavor .<ssssss>i be excite to try , but mostly disappointed with the end result .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be a little light , not even really coating the tounge very well .<ssssss>probably not a beer i would order again .<ssssss>although , i probably will give it at least one more go just to be fair .<ssssss>
8 6 8 5 6		one of six stout we share last night at the vine street pub during stout month .<ssssss>pour a creamy black color with a tight , dense light brown head .<ssssss>very mild aroma of milk chocolate , cream and roasted malt .<ssssss>medium body , creamy and kind of bland , milk chocolate and lightly roasted malt .<ssssss>the biggest disappointment of the night .<ssssss>
5 8 5 6 7		12 oz bottle courtesy of tjensen3618 be a recent nhl bif , thanks tyler !<ssssss>pour a very hazy medium gold color with a surprisingly small , lifeless off-white foam .<ssssss>poor retention and zero lacing .<ssssss>nose have a ton of wheat tang and huskiness to it .<ssssss>mix in some bubblegum and banana with a shot or two of alcohol .<ssssss>pretty unique smell brew , not bad at all .<ssssss>kind of a oxidize malty flavor and sweet wheat .<ssssss>somewhat creamy with too heavy of a alcohol presence for a summer brew .<ssssss>almost get cloying , but a little hop bite on the end keep it from be so .<ssssss>undercarbonate , for sure as not even a swirl can not get any bubble to rise to the top .<ssssss>i be really look forward to drink this , my first fw brew .<ssssss>i would like to try it again to give it a fair shake , but this bottle be a bit disappointing .<ssssss>
8 4 5 6 6		i read about the beer and know i would eventually have to try it .<ssssss>i do not realize they only have 3 vintage release of the beer -lrb- the latest be 97 -rrb- .<ssssss>i be 8 year old when this beer be release and the only thing i think maple syrup be for pour over pancake .<ssssss>when i be check out i be ask whether i would ever have the beer before .<ssssss>i say , `` no , tonight 's the night , '' to which the cashier reply , `` it be not one of my favorite , man be it thick ... '' upon return home , i peel off the wrapping and proceed to break the cork in half .<ssssss>i know more trouble be only to come when the cork fall down into the blackness .<ssssss>appearance : this beer look rich , completely dark with tremendous amount of sediment .<ssssss>there be paper-like and fine particle sediment in the bottom and side of the container 's inside , some of which transfer into my glass -lrb- even with a slow pour -rrb- .<ssssss>the beer have a oily halo that be of incredible richness .<ssssss>this fine layer leave on the inside of my glass produce a rusty-yellow glow when hold to the light .<ssssss>i have never see anything like this beer .<ssssss>smell : holy intensity .<ssssss>four out of four people that smell this beer want nothing to do with it .<ssssss>i get strong note of soy sauce , oak , and ethanol .<ssssss>i can not find much of the maple syrup sweetness that i be expect .<ssssss>honestly , i be begin to doubt my purchase and wonder whether i can even move on to the next step .<ssssss>taste : the taste be incredibly potent .<ssssss>i would not call this a bock at this point , i would call it a canvas for maximum yeast fermentation .<ssssss>there be a sweetness that you can taste , but there be so much go on that it be hard to write down any one flavor .<ssssss>i be glad i at least have the ball to try it room temp , but it would be so much easier to drink cooler .<ssssss>the beer be not for the weak , nor for the blind .<ssssss>know what you be get into and read review before purchase .<ssssss>most of these bottle have sit for almost 15 year .<ssssss>mouthfeel : the beer be very thick and a effort to put down .<ssssss>i honestly do not know why this beer be such a struggle , i have have dfh beer that be the upward of 15 % abv and drink they with ease .<ssssss>this beer , however , be a different story .<ssssss>i get a cough syrup-like repulsion that make I cough every time i take a sip .<ssssss>i can see why whiskey barrel aging would add a certain layer of complexity to other beer , but this beer already have a tremendous amount go on and may not have benefit from this type of conditioning .<ssssss>in summary , the beer be try too hard to be a liquor when it just do not have the cojone .<ssssss>drinkability : i think r. kelly summarize this `` beer '' perfectly with , `` my mind 's tellin ' I noooo ... but my body , my body be tellin ' I yeeaaahhhaa . ''<ssssss>for some reason i just keep at it and gladly share with all who come back for more .<ssssss>i may see how this go down with a little temperature modulation , but a food pairing be out of the question .<ssssss>much like harry and dumbledore at the lake of the inferi , we be leave force-feeding each other this horcrux poison .<ssssss>i respect beer and all those that try and expand common conception , but this one do not bring home the goods .<ssssss>cheer .<ssssss>

6 8 6 5 5		pour a cloudy gold in color .<ssssss>smell be definitely all spice and coriander .<ssssss>very strong .<ssssss>taste be not what i be expect .<ssssss>this be far from what i would expect for a celebratory beer .<ssssss>this have a definite band-aid , or paste flavor in it .<ssssss>mouthfeel be crisp and somewhat refreshing .<ssssss>not pleasant to drink .<ssssss>hopefully the next will be back to a powerful stout or a very nice english style old ale .<ssssss>

10 8 10 8 8		in the last couple of year , we have see some potential crack in the armour of this highly hyped monster stout .<ssssss>after a widely acclaimed version in 2008 , some feel that the 2009 be just a sugar and soy bomb .<ssssss>between that and the explosion of dark lord day into a over-sold drunken mosh-pit , some of the gleem have wear off the dl label .<ssssss>while the event still have its problem , i be happy to say that the beer be back with a vengeance .<ssssss>at a glance , dl exhibit its classic quality .<ssssss>every black-hole , light-sucking , bottomless pit metaphor have be use to describe this beer , so i will just say it be dark .<ssssss>very dark .<ssssss>on the pour , a half-finger head try to make a brief appearance , but it be swiftly beat into submission , never to appear again .<ssssss>no lacing , no whisp of bubble , just a flat , smooth , dark surface .<ssssss>the smell lean strongly towards the sweet : burnt molasses , prune and dark chocolate take the lead .<ssssss>a whiff of tobacco and espresso round thing out .<ssssss>there be a little soy and booze on the nose as well , but not enough to throw thing off too much .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be just about perfect .<ssssss>whereas the '09 have a motor-oil consistency that seem to polarize reviewer , the 2010 have a slightly more subtle vinous feel : full and velvety , but not suffocatingly thick .<ssssss>a few sip show that the 2010 dl vintage be not a unbalanced lunatic .<ssssss>instead , this year 's version bring some complexity to the mix .<ssssss>the familiar sweetness be there of course : creme caramel , milk chocolate , and port quality take they familiar role at the lead .<ssssss>however , unlike last year , the coffee flavor be allow to slowly work they way into the mix .<ssssss>by the end , this beer be , in its own freakish way , balanced .<ssssss>do not get I wrong , dark lord be still a very sweet stout .<ssssss>if you prefer a stout that lean towards char coffee flavor , this may not be the beer for you .<ssssss>the boozy finish -lrb- turbo-charged to 15 % this year -rrb- knock this down a peg or two on both taste and drinkability .<ssssss>that say , give its complexity , the 2010 show immense potential for aging .<ssssss>once the booze calm down a bit , i think ultimately this will go down as one of the best vintage of this beast .<ssssss>

9 7 7 9 7		theme of this beer review : brown sugar appearance : the color be a nice brown sugar , with light carbonation and a thin vanilla head -lrb- with wonderful retention -rrb- .<ssssss>it be color lighter than i expect , but be very beautiful .<ssssss>smell : not as pronounced as other quad , i pick up some fruityness -lrb- apple and raison -rrb- and some brown sugar .<ssssss>taste : again the apple and the brown sugar dominate , with a possibility of cinnamon .<ssssss>there be a slight breadiness to the brew too , but only after warm for awhile .<ssssss>mouthfeel : thin to medium body ... it be actually thinner than i be hope for .<ssssss>it coat the palate nicely .<ssssss>drinkability : there be more drinkable quad out there , and i probably will not have this one again .<ssssss>but give a choice between this and 99 % of other beer in the world ... i will take this .<ssssss>
8 8 8 7 10		appearance : brilliantly clear straw yellow , with thick , rocky white head .<ssssss>smell : tangly floral hop aroma , very similar to a pilsner , but with a more prominent malt undertone .<ssssss>also some mild cheese-like note , as well as a touch of bubblegum .<ssssss>taste : initial brief -lrb- very brief -rrb- sweetness , which give way to flowery hop , faint malt , some green apple note , and hint of freshly mown grass .<ssssss>the finish have a very strong saltine cracker flavor .<ssssss>mouthfeel : medium-bodied , moderately carbonate .<ssssss>drinkability : light , low-alcohol , and refreshing .<ssssss>very clean .<ssssss>would not have guess it be a ale .<ssssss>overall : in general , i prefer sweeter , darker , thicker beer than this .<ssssss>so it be hard for I to rate this beer objectively .<ssssss>but it be a good change of pace , and i enjoy the tantalizing hint of sugary sweetness at the beginning .<ssssss>certainly a good , refreshing summer beer .<ssssss>

9 8 8 6 7		label indicate 2005 .<ssssss>let this set for about 30 minute after remove from the fridge .<ssssss>healthy `` pop '' and pour with about a 2 inch pink head into my tulip .<ssssss>nice deep brown color .<ssssss>head diminish into fair lacing .<ssssss>head and lacing be the same for each subsequent pour .<ssssss>nice look beer .<ssssss>the cherry come through heavily in the smell , as well as in the taste .<ssssss>mouthfeel be nice and on the mark for a quad .<ssssss>thick and chewy , alcohol be not very noticeable at first , but begin to assert itself about halfway through .<ssssss>as this warm , the dominant cherry flavor begin to take on a more medecinal taste - cherry cough syrup .<ssssss>at this point , the beer lose its appeal for I .<ssssss>drink the entire bottle become a bit of a chore .<ssssss>score for taste would have mark higher if i have just have a small glass .<ssssss>by the end of the bottle , it be become offensive , so i have to score somewhere in the middle .<ssssss>if someone offer I a 12 oz , or a glass of this beer , i would gladly accept , but nothing more .<ssssss>i would like to revisit this beer again sometime , but only in a smaller portion .<ssssss>
8 5 5 2 4		bottled in 2006 .<ssssss>i let it age for about 10 month before try it .<ssssss>i sit down in front of the projection screen at my house , ready to watch a movie and enjoy this `` supposedly '' delicious beer .<ssssss>so i crack the beast open .<ssssss>appearance : nice half inch off-white head stick with it for a bit .<ssssss>nice dark amberish color .<ssssss>smell : very sugary and alcoholy taste : horrible !<ssssss>nothing but sugar .<ssssss>nothing but sugar .<ssssss>i let my roommate try it just to be safe , and he say the same thing .<ssssss>body : nice and full but the sugar be way too overbearing .<ssssss>i want to say that my bottle be just a oddity but at $ 7 a bottle , i guess i will not know for a long time .<ssssss>
6 4 8 4 4		hahahaha wow , this be a first : a beer whose flavor and aroma be so subtle , that i can not taste they .<ssssss>now , i will admit i do have some allergy/sinus problem , but until this beer this evening , i have be able to taste and smell the other .<ssssss>it be extra weird because i have the feeling that the taste and smell be almost there , but not .<ssssss>i do let the beer warm a bit and still ... .<ssssss>wait - just now , i taste some malt !<ssssss>hurrah !<ssssss>the score i give for taste and smell be where they be since i tasted nothing bad or out of character .<ssssss>and now i do pick up a little malt .<ssssss>pour aggressively give I some off white head that quickly die down and no lace .<ssssss>body be good and so be carbonation .<ssssss>color be a almost clear , nice medium dark honey amber with some tiny bubble trail .<ssssss>finish be , ah , very faint and so , short .<ssssss>
8 9 7 7 7		greet with a strong but not overwhelming citrus aroma of orange and tangerine .<ssssss>but just as impressive be the obvious toast maltiness .<ssssss>taste be different than what i expect ... .<ssssss>not much of the juicy citrus ... just more of a sharp piney bitterness ... also the malt be hardly noticable on the taste .<ssssss>body be medium ... reallly a dry finish to this ... nice enough ... .<ssssss>aroma be top notch ... the rest be fine but not memorable .<ssssss>would purchase again but would not seek .<ssssss>as i settle into this beer the malt re-enter with a toffeeish flavor ... all in all a nice ipa .<ssssss>.<ssssss>as i finish it , it feel more english ipa than west coast<ssssss>
9 10 6 7 7		heart of darkness , thanks to kunzbrew for sample .<ssssss>a black beer with some red glow while backlit .<ssssss>the aroma be huge , lot of chocolate , roasted grain , and raisin in this tan foam .<ssssss>the flavor be of espresso , and bitter chocolate that linger on when the glass be set down .<ssssss>unfortunately the body be too thin and flavor too dry to get the maximum flavor out of the ingredients.a little more sweetness and the body fill out and this one could stand out .<ssssss>but until then ... ... ... .<ssssss>
8 7 8 6 8		a attractive beer with a very dark brown body and a dense light brown head , but the flavor come in a little thin .<ssssss>the aroma have whiff of chocolate and the body be creamy enough to satisfy , id really like to see something a bit richer in flavor .<ssssss>the finish be a little bitter and slightly metallic .<ssssss>
8 7 10 9 8		a : blood red .<ssssss>clear .<ssssss>khaki head that leave great lacing .<ssssss>some carbonation rise up .<ssssss>great look beer .<ssssss>s : a little puzzling aroma .<ssssss>for some odd reason the dominant scent be straight up gummy bear .<ssssss>it be uncanny .<ssssss>then there be a sour scent , slightly acidic and vinous .<ssssss>malt linger in the background , but gummy bear way up front .<ssssss>it make I curious as to what kind of hop they use in this one .<ssssss>-lrb- website say `` classify '' -rrb- t : huge caramel malt taste with heap of hop , eventually the sweetness give way to the copious amount of flavor and bittering hop .<ssssss>the hop be pine all the way .<ssssss>hugely resinous hop on the back of my tongue that stick like glue .<ssssss>very bitter .<ssssss>finish quite dry , a little alcoholic , and slightly chalky .<ssssss>m : quite thick , oily , and viscous mouthfeel .<ssssss>perfect amount of carbonation .<ssssss>this beer pack a pine punch in the face with the most curious and enigmatic aroma i have come across .<ssssss>the aroma have almost nothing to do with the taste , but that just add to the complexity of this fine ale .<ssssss>after drink my first glass of this bomber , i feel like i can scrape hop resin off my tongue .<ssssss>it be hard to imagine what kind of food would hold its own against this monster of a beer .<ssssss>
8 7 8 6 5		mayflower stout have a body that be the darkest shade of brown and opaque at its core .<ssssss>the light brown head be thick and rocky .<ssssss>retention be good and lacing be spotty .<ssssss>chocolate and roasted malt join wood , bourbon and vanilla in the nice .<ssssss>a good bit of alcohol be in there also .<ssssss>i be a mayflower fan , so i be look forward to try this one , but it be not exactly what i want .<ssssss>chocolate and roasted malt lead thing off , and then the flavor move into the barrel characteristic .<ssssss>dark fruit macerate in bourbon , spicy oak and vanilla be all present .<ssssss>the finish be the real problem : it bring more bourbon , but also a ton of heat and harsh alcohol .<ssssss>mouthfeel be good , big , full and creamy .<ssssss>mayflower be one of those brewery that seem to do a good job with the mouthfeel of they beer .<ssssss>too harsh and boozy for I .<ssssss>may benefit from spend a little more time in the bottle .<ssssss>
7 7 8 6 8		i believe this be simply a new label for the beer formerly know as summer stock -lrb- i could be mistaken , but why would they produce more than one kolsch style beer ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>pour a appetizing clear golden hue with a one-inch bright white head that dissipate after a minute or two .<ssssss>crisp , clean nose of very light sweet malt , light floral hop , a touch of honey , and some astringency .<ssssss>palate be subtle , with a bit of a nice hoppy zing mixed in with some light malt , honey sweetness , and a touch of grass .<ssssss>nice medium body .<ssssss>could use a little bit more flavor , but it be still a good summer beer .<ssssss>
7 7 7 9 8		pour out a very deep copper color , a little hazy , but still very nice in term of color .<ssssss>the head that form go up to over a inch , i would guess , then kind of fade back to about a cm , where it stay for quite a while , leave bit of sticky lace all around .<ssssss>by the end of the drink , the head have subside quite a bit , but it be still around .<ssssss>the nose be very pungent , deep , and resinous .<ssssss>it kind of lack the zippy citrus-tinged smell you normally expect from the average ipa , and i actually think i might like that a bit better .<ssssss>there be still the same floral zestiness , but the resinous smell really be impressive .<ssssss>there be also a nice crackeriness to it , a bit toasty , bready .<ssssss>the only problem be that the smell i be enjoy be not strong enough to really impress I .<ssssss>i have to dig deep into the beer to find they , otherwise i be just present with a nice graininess .<ssssss>the taste really shine it up though .<ssssss>right off , i get a wonderful combination of cakey , not sweet , but dense and bready and dry maltiness pair up with a nice , almost spicy , floral resinous hoppiness , and it never stop .<ssssss>you also get some nice woody , leafy note , and a bit of lime , but not the fresh , zesty , bitter peel bit , just some nice lime juice mix in and balance out with a nice kick of sweetness .<ssssss>but the dryness prevail overall , really allow I to taste the nice hop profile and malt profile in this beer .<ssssss>i will admit , that this may not impress a lot of people , it do not have the light , overpower citrus of some of the more beloved ipa , but it have everything that i really like .<ssssss>the body be good , maybe a bit on the thin side of medium , and the carbonation be just a bit annoying .<ssssss>better than average , but not quite as good as it could be for sure .<ssssss>the carbonation just rush along too quickly , almost stinging , and take a bit away from the finish of this beer .<ssssss>but overall , this be very drinkable .<ssssss>a beer that i would certainly buy -lrb- i do not remember the price exactly , but i do not think it be too much -rrb- again if it be around .<ssssss>not a knock you sock off type beer , but one that i could really see myself drink over and over again .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		a - hazy straw / gold color with a huge bubbly head .<ssssss>leave splotch of lace all over the side of the glass as it vanish .<ssssss>s - pear , apple , floral note .<ssssss>a strong vinous character .<ssssss>smell like a white pear wine .<ssssss>nice , but nothing fantastic .<ssssss>abv be undetectable .<ssssss>as temperature rise , smell become even more vinous , almost musty .<ssssss>t - a stong pear , slight date and apple , like a faint granny smith tartness .<ssssss>i find absolutely no negative attribute to this taste .<ssssss>it could be better , but it be very well do as it be .<ssssss>it be very lightly sweet upfront and then it fade off into a mild wine bitter flavor .<ssssss>again abv be mask .<ssssss>flavor become slightly sweeter and fuller as it warm .<ssssss>but definitely good at a wide range .<ssssss>m - thin and a little astringent , but it be very refreshing apart from that .<ssssss>d - would match up with fish or poultry beautifully .<ssssss>would not work as a session beer , and at the price , you would be foolish to use it as such .<ssssss>all thing consider , a very good tripel .<ssssss>i would have again , if the price be not so steep .<ssssss>
8 7 10 9 9		pour a hazy brown amber with a lumpy off-white head .<ssssss>sweet malt be offset by crisp hop together produce a wonderful balance and mouthfeel .<ssssss>sooo smooth !<ssssss>certainly one of the better mcneill 's brew available , and the real label lead I to believe that this one be be export from we lovely state of vermont .<ssssss>snag one if you see it .<ssssss>
6 7 5 8 8		pour a dark brown with ruby highlight .<ssssss>thin fizzy head that leave pretty quickly .<ssssss>thin spotty lacing .<ssssss>smell be of chocolate and maybe some mocha .<ssssss>initially in the taste there be a sharp acidic bite .<ssssss>once past that this be a good beer with a nice mixture of roasted and chocolate flavor .<ssssss>think of eat fine chocolate and follow it with a cheap black coffee .<ssssss>pleasent roasted aftertaste .<ssssss>the acidic bitterness hamper the mouthfeel .<ssssss>it may be because of the high carbonation .<ssssss>either way , the beer be too carbonate .<ssssss>it be also a bit too thin .<ssssss>the poor mouthfeel only detract from the beer slightly as overall this be a above average porter .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		the chocolate be the predominate flavor here , but it only enhance the brew .<ssssss>slightly sweet with just the right level of dark roasted malt and hop to balance out the bitterness .<ssssss>good drinkability .<ssssss>great look head after a agressive pour .<ssssss>
4 6 6 7 5		way overcarbonate .<ssssss>take out of fridge after a couple day and pour carefully down the side of the glass .<ssssss>have to stop a quarter of the way due to to massive amount of foamy creamy head .<ssssss>appearance be a cloudy dirty amber - the most sediment i have ever see in a ipa .<ssssss>smell be not very impressive - make out a unpleasant hoppy smell .<ssssss>.<ssssss>almost moldy .<ssssss>hint of lemongrass , fruit and wet hay .<ssssss>notice a unpleasant `` bug spray '' smell .<ssssss>the taste be of tangerine and grapefruit with a underlie bready malt .<ssssss>nice balance of hop bitterness and malt .<ssssss>the taste be good - but this could have be much better with some heavier addition of aroma hop and a little less haze and sediment .<ssssss>
8 10 8 7 8		pour jet black - rocky brown head aroma really jump out at you - chocolate , licorice , molasses , espresso and over ripe plum .<ssssss>taste big and complex , if a bit rough hew .<ssssss>a impressive stout , but lack a bit of harmony - the flavor compete instead of blend ... k75<ssssss>
9 7 5 3 3		beer ?<ssssss>this taste more like red wine .<ssssss>acidic , somewhat sour , and reeking of alcohol , this beer could practically be indistinguishable from red wine if the taster be blindfold .<ssssss>awful taste .<ssssss>appear great in the glass , a purple and red haze with a nice sustainable head .<ssssss>smell like wine more than beer .<ssssss>mouthfeel be nice for a few seconds but after a while it start to `` eat away '' at you mouth with it acidic complex .<ssssss>after read some review and admire the fantastic packaging , i can say that i be disappointed .<ssssss>practically undrinkable .<ssssss>
8 9 7 5 5		a : nice blend of orange/brown hue , two finger of head that disappear rather quickly .<ssssss>s : spice be dominant , smell like a pumpkin pie , a oatmeal cookie also come to mind .<ssssss>the blend of spice smell as close to pumpkin pie as i have encounter , which be promising .<ssssss>t : first sip be quite a shock .<ssssss>i love a good spiced/pumpkin ale , but this be a bit overpowering .<ssssss>it taste like a extra sugary/spicey pumpkin pie put into liquid form .<ssssss>once the spice die down , come to a more enjoyable malty finish .<ssssss>m : medium body , spice and sugary taste tend to linger in the mouth .<ssssss>d : the mouthfeel be enjoyable , but the overpowering nature of the spice make both my friend and i not want another .<ssssss>overall if you be look for a true pumpkin pie tasting beer , this be you beer .<ssssss>i love pumpkin ale , and southern tier certainly have the blend of spice right , but this one do not taste enough like a beer for I to really enjoy it .<ssssss>
5 7 6 8 5		a - golden in color cloudy thick white head lace out after a while be - yeasty and fruity lite spice t - yeast spice up front finish with a fruitiness m - light bubbly and dry the mouth out d - better then most triple i have have but still not a fan<ssssss>

4 4 4 6 4		i have to drink a `` light '' beer i will go for these .<ssssss>this be you typical tasting light beer .<ssssss>.<ssssss>although better than the other .<ssssss>.<ssssss>especially bud light .<ssssss>not a big fan of light beer ... not much taste , not much anything .<ssssss>i have have these in can also ... not good<ssssss>
6 7 10 8 7		a - rich yellowy straw color with a cloudy , honey character .<ssssss>minimal head that fade quickly to nothing with no lacing on the glass .<ssssss>s - rich , sweet malt be prominent .<ssssss>slight floral hop aroma be there too .<ssssss>smell clean and crisp with no real hint of the 9 % abv .<ssssss>t - sweet and yet slightly bitter up front .<ssssss>malty sweetness follow through the middle .<ssssss>a drier , grainy taste be detectable toward the finish with some subtle tang and spiciness on the side of the tongue .<ssssss>alcohol be surprisingly well-hidden unlike unibroue 's trois pistole -lrb- same abv but much more noticeable -rrb- .<ssssss>m - perfection .<ssssss>not watery , but not overly syrupy .<ssssss>carbonation be dazzlingly refreshing , but it do not take away from the flavor of the beer .<ssssss>
5 6 3 7 5		oly pour out a slightly hazy , but clear and very bright pale straw colour .<ssssss>a nice big foamy head fizz up with gusto and retreat with as much vigor .<ssssss>some thin , sticky lace cling to the glass .<ssssss>very grassy aroma ... follow by some caramel graininess ... .<ssssss>bit of cook sugariness ... smell pretty good .<ssssss>definitely not you stereotypical macro .<ssssss>taste sugary ... .<ssssss>hint of some caramel maltiness and earthy grainy hop .<ssssss>despite the intriguing flavor , the body come off as really watery and thin .<ssssss>pretty smooth and without the tongue numbing crispness of most mass-produced swill .<ssssss>glare shortcoming aside ... this twist on the american macro lager would make for a good lawnmower beer or summer chugger .<ssssss>make for a nice changeup in the macro rotation in my fridge .<ssssss>
7 5 6 8 8		cold spring brewery have finally hit a `` home run '' -lrb- well maybe a triple -rrb- with this item .<ssssss>it be now in a bottle , which when compare to the 16oz can of the past seem to be pretty much the same thing .<ssssss>i look more closely for some good flavor in this gluek offering and find it .<ssssss>the hop seem to shine through in this beer , and at a higher than `` lite '' pour temperature the whole flavor be rather nice .<ssssss>the head stay with the pour , and especially in the new bottom etched cold spring glass .<ssssss>as borat would say , `` i like '' !<ssssss>
5 9 5 6 7		cheer to bitterbill for this one !<ssssss>pour a effervescent mahogany with 2 finger of frothy mocha head .<ssssss>near zero head retention & lacing , nice viscosity to this though s : vanilla , oak , bourbon & cherry up front , nice sour-mash signature t : sour mash , dryness , & a bit of coffee up front .<ssssss>coffee , oaky dryness , a touch of cherry sourness & vanilla .<ssssss>finish sour with a touch of baker 's chocolate , & cherry soak in oak , this just do not jell for I mf : actually a bit light body for a imp stout with a bit too much carbonation drink alright , but do not quite pull together ; this be not in my wheelhouse for the style<ssssss>
6 5 8 7 6		pour from a 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle into a pint glass .<ssssss>a : dark brown to black with a creamy light brown head that go to a ring of bubble rather quickly .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>s : coffee and rub alcohol .<ssssss>t : relatively complex mix of malt , primarily focus on dark roast that yield that espresso coffee flavor .<ssssss>there be a bit of bitter chocolate in there too , with a clear alcohol flavor at the finish to accompany a relatively warm linger .<ssssss>m & d : very creamy and smooth make it rather palatable in spite of the the varnish remover note .<ssssss>the carbonation be light but tenacious and add to the texture .<ssssss>honestly , if the alcohol be not quite so noticeable in this it would really kick ass .<ssssss>unfortunately , it just have a finish like acetone - not my taste .<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 8		pour a two finger , tan , head that retain well too a strong film .<ssssss>colro be a dark leather brown with highlight of blood garnet .<ssssss>a little cloudiness .<ssssss>the aroma be a sweet cream , with some very subtle roasted , toast malt .<ssssss>tandy leather malt mix with lightly smoke but mostly roasted cream and coffee and hint of char .<ssssss>a nice burny feel to the palate mix with a cream and hop finish .<ssssss>

7 6 8 9 9		a - nice golden color great pale white head with nice lacing all the way to the bottom of the glass .<ssssss>s - average malty with faint hop note .<ssssss>t - beautiful taste malt with just a hint of hop bring off a verry balanced beer .<ssssss>m - nicely feel d - verry frinkable only down side be @ 7.50 a bottle at the bottle not a regular session beer but one when i can have it ill definitely drink it .<ssssss>
4 8 5 4 6		appearance : pale lemony yellow colour .<ssssss>high carbonation .<ssssss>reasonable head which disappear quickly .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>nose : grassy , hoppy vegetative arome .<ssssss>very good .<ssssss>very pilsener-like .<ssssss>a refreshing fragrant nose .<ssssss>taste : very disappointing .<ssssss>none of that sharp bite pil front palate .<ssssss>it be rather bland to start off with , then there be only a hint of bitterness before level out to a wishy-washy nothingness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a little flat with a slight thingle .<ssssss>it be a alright lager , all say and do , but when you have get such a huge range of much better pilsener on offer , you would be crazy to pick this one .<ssssss>
8 5 8 4 5		bottle thanks to lauren .<ssssss>pour a dark murky crimson with a very slowly advance ring of bubble , fight they way upward through a thick , dark swamp .<ssssss>nose be a strange collage of burnt brown sugar , leather , fermented apple , sweaty sock .<ssssss>thick flavor profile of massive , wet barrel , wet leather , caramelize brown sugar , finish be all fermented apple and sour cherry .<ssssss>heavy and kind of oppressive , major alcohol heat on the finish .<ssssss>to my friend this be disgust throughout , though i can see the merit in it to a extent .<ssssss>that be say , it be a mish-mash of flavor and style that be not very harmonious or pleasant on any level .<ssssss>i be pretty surprise at how much the brett influence this .<ssssss>it remind I of mckenzie 's barrel work from 2009-2010 .<ssssss>if you like massive barrel influence and slightly sour old ale with burn alcohol heat throughout , seek this out immediately .<ssssss>
6 6 5 4 6		pour from a weird , short , stubby bottle a orange/blonde color .<ssssss>not much of a head , mostly due to low carbontation .<ssssss>aroma be somewhat simple or shallow - not much depth .<ssssss>sweet malt be evident , subtle yeast ester .<ssssss>no hop aroma , no spiciness .<ssssss>flavour be sweet , sweet maltiness .<ssssss>again , some subtle effect from the yeast come in to play , but not in a serious way .<ssssss>none of the linger hop bite i expect at the end of a triple .<ssssss>there be some body , but it feel almost manufacture -lrb- perhaps just base on high finish gravity , rather than any protien from say , unmalted grain -rrb- .<ssssss>a one-dimensional triple .<ssssss>this beer suffer from a few flaw , the first and most obviously noticable be the low low carbonation .<ssssss>obviously these bottle can only handle so much pressure : that be why every good triple out there come in proper belgian bottle , and be aggressively carbontate .<ssssss>the other flaw be that this be a overly sweet , overly simple beer .<ssssss>the addition of some flake barley or malt wheat might have help the body , while better attenuation & more bittering hop would have help that characteristic sweetness from which many american version of this style suffer<ssssss>
8 10 7 8 8		this be a perfect example of the blur line between american ipa 's of the & lt ; 1996 and the apa of today .<ssssss>big in both alcohol and hop this beer make snpa seem like you little sister 's beer .<ssssss>crystal malt provide the body and structure that support the intense centenninal and chinook bitterness .<ssssss>the snappy hop finish be top only by a intense cascade nose .<ssssss>all in all , this beer be typical of the bj 's approach : bigger and bolder than the style call for .<ssssss>

9 10 7 8 8		a most ruby-eyed thankful cheer to a skydoc ... live long and prosper , doctor !<ssssss>app : pompously drain the subtle creaminess afoot with a almost too hectic challenging head .<ssssss>scintillator-light , copper-crystallized pigmentation , lightly suffuse with a oily sediment representation awash in its teem ; it certainly be headstrong !<ssssss>body-strong all the more !<ssssss>i vaguely remember this have a much more yellowish thinness to it , but i top a rest of it last night and it be bright in hue , but not necessarily yellow .<ssssss>cerise , in actuality .<ssssss>all-be-damned .<ssssss>sm : a righteous acidic sensation with ginger note and faint breezy alcohol ; the hop be noticeable as well , and they be hellishly floral .<ssssss>mind you , '' floral '' be dissimilar from `` fruity '' ... and `` fruity '' be mile dissimilar from `` bitter '' ... t : hmmm .<ssssss>i be gregariously think this have more to offer , but this be still a goodly-gathered experience .<ssssss>very lactic , but not as strong nor bitter as i be expect ... the jack d'or from pretty thing , i think anyway , have the perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness ; the imperial saison from new glarus have fairly-decent taste profile , all together be seemingly under-compensated , to say the least ; it be damned good , and damned drinkable ... but not one taste be overpower , and the taste use be not as big and bold and jetting-out as you would of hope for .<ssssss>it be sweeter than virulent or tart and be quite reassuring ; but its aftertaste make up for the lack of bold yeasty , hop , floral , bitter characteristic with this incredibly dry ruffling-kick that leave much to be desire ; basically a sharp , almost pungent aftertaste that i thought be a bit distracting , and disappointing , all the more .<ssssss>mf : hush , hush , i will not tell anybody : lively animated when swarm throughout you mouth , but as i let it swirl around for a bit , these admittedly salty flavour and sensation kick I hard .<ssssss>thin , and almost enjoyable wine-burn ... but what i really get in pertinence to how it feel , be analogically open my gob in the ocean and let the salty mayhem swim in poetically ; yuk !<ssssss>i will sip this one , ha ha !<ssssss>dr : doctor ... this be a lavishly joyful session-beer ... but know that the farmhouse ale/saison be one of my all-time favourite , this be a bittersweet experience .<ssssss>i will gladly drink it again if offer , but i certainly will not be go out of my way to wisconsin just to try another .<ssssss>no , i will leave it to the new glarus fanatic out there to do all the necessary unplugged tracking .<ssssss>thanks again , doc !<ssssss>ader .<ssssss>

7 10 8 9 10		a - one finger of white foam and large bubble on top of a clear , straw yellow body .<ssssss>the foam recede rapidly and leave only slight lace .<ssssss>s - spicy wheat with moderate acidity , both acetic and lactic , as well as some earthy wild note .<ssssss>there be also some banana and vanilla note and perhaps a little bit of earthy hop aroma .<ssssss>t - surprisingly light , clean malt at first with light , clean acidity follow quickly in its wake .<ssssss>the light malt and wheat combine with the peculiar acid quality be very reminiscent of a berliner weisse .<ssssss>this initially clean impression quickly give way to a more funky sort of sourness with some vinegar note and a hint of roquefort cheese .<ssssss>finish with moderate acidity from wheat and bug as well as some vanilla malt note and a hint of grape and black cherry fruit character .<ssssss>all of this clear off the palate fairly quickly leave only a bit of wheat and lactic acid linger in a reprisal of the initial flavor .<ssssss>m - medium body , high carbonation , and a dry finish .<ssssss>d - this be one of the most interesting beer i have have from jolly pumpkin -lrb- and that be say a lot consider they typical brew -rrb- .<ssssss>the weissebier yeast be much less prominent than i expect it to be .<ssssss>while i can definitely detect it in the nose , it be quite subtle in the flavor and the wild character really overshadow it .<ssssss>nevertheless the weizen base add a layer of complexity and the high attenuation combine with sourness create something that would be best describe as a unusually complex and drinkable berliner weisse .<ssssss>it be a bit more subtle than some of jp 's brew , but that may be a good thing becasue it be extremely easy to quaff , and i be really enjoy every sip .<ssssss>
8 8 9 7 9		decent beer , but too much spice in the flavor .<ssssss>pretty pour -- dark amber with a tall but light head .<ssssss>smell like it taste -lrb- spicy and malty -rrb- .<ssssss>feel yeasty or bready in the mouth , and i be look forward to have a pretty long session of these on christmas eve to help I cope with the in-laws-to-be ...<ssssss>

9 10 8 8 7		a - a cloudy luminescent blood orange liquid with a thin but creamy look head .<ssssss>this look like serious business .<ssssss>s - pungent raisin , fruit , toffee , and a strong sour quality .<ssssss>there be a lot go on here and the complexity be great .<ssssss>this smell really really nice .<ssssss>t - raisin , apple , flower , citrus , toffee , and a acidic/sour finish .<ssssss>start out awesome but fall a little short on the finish .<ssssss>m - creamy body with a tart and dry finish .<ssssss>clean with a lasting acidity .<ssssss>d - start out awesome , but the more i get into it the more i start to think of this as a treat beer that be better in small dose .<ssssss>the alcohol be well hide and if this have a stronger finish , then this would be a stunner .<ssssss>
8 8 6 5 6		dimpled glass goblet temp 58-62 a clean , golden amber , off white head , about a finger of lace s apple butter , light malt , baked spice -lrb- this be the best part , it go downhill from here -rrb- t band aid , off note , taste be very brief and fleeting .<ssssss>leave I with sad and confused face .<ssssss>repeat again and again and get the same result , even after let it warm up and develop m it have moderate weight , but the taste sort of ruin it d not cut the ched .<ssssss>it be swing top , so i guess if its under $ 2 its worth it for the bottle<ssssss>

6 4 5 4 7		i give the green can of balashi a high 3.5 on drinkability mainly because it be the only non-skunked beer one can find while sun the day away in aruba .<ssssss>it pour a clear light pale yellow color with a white head , somewhat like a watered-down miller light .<ssssss>the head disappear quickly with little straw whiff on the nose .<ssssss>there be very little , if any , hop or malt flavor or aroma .<ssssss>mouthfeel be not bad , but may have be skewed due to sunny , warm day drive through the desert island .<ssssss>a mouth full of volcanic dust apr jeep excursion make drinkability high for the same reason .<ssssss>even though it do not score overly high , it be still better than water down , sugary rum drink .<ssssss>overall : this one be great when you be sit under some shade enjoy the cool breeze off the water .<ssssss>a earlier reviewer be way off topic in respect to the water , especially since they state-of-the-art de-salination plant be prevalent from most of the non-touristy area .<ssssss>

8 6 6 4 8		on a recent trip to chinatown in san francisco , my brother and i decide to venture away from the typical bbq pork bun on the dim-sum menu , and order the bitter melon and beef .<ssssss>i should have know , be in chinatown , that my western conception of melon as sweet and tangy would be challenge , but i be completely and utterly floor by just how bitter the bitter melon turn out to be .<ssssss>when i say floor , i mean it .<ssssss>we nearly fall out of we chair .<ssssss>b-i-t-t-e-r .<ssssss>when you pick up a bottle of stone 's ruination ipa , you be not leave wonder about the experience to come .<ssssss>not a little type be waste on brag to what great length stone have infuse they ipa with bitterness .<ssssss>perhaps too much .<ssssss>while one do drink a ipa for the bitterness , one should also expect it to satisfy more than a small area on the back of you tongue .<ssssss>not only be the beer not as bitter as expect , but that be the overwhelming taste characteristic present .<ssssss>a good ipa should be bitter , yes , but not a one trick taste pony .<ssssss>i would hope , be so highly praise on this site , that ruination ipa would be more engaging , but i be more or less bore after the first sip , but i guess that be partly the point .<ssssss>the label itself say that after a single taste , even food would turn to ash in you mouth , but i do not know that the beer be include in that ruination .<ssssss>if you like ipa 's , you will probably come upon this one eventually in you search for the best , but i think you will be disappoint .<ssssss>ruination ipa ; well say .<ssssss>

6 6 6 8 6		one of the biggest and world be most reknown macro .<ssssss>that say , it be a clean tasting and refeshing lager when you in a pinch or in the mood for a beer that do not need to be analyze .<ssssss>
7 8 9 6 7		thanks to tyson for toss this in as a extra in a recent trade .<ssssss>i barely have this beer 24 hour before i decide it be time .<ssssss>pour a cloudy , hazy light copper color .<ssssss>this beer be really cloudy , almost like a hefe .<ssssss>the small off white head retreat quickly into the brew .<ssssss>it leave some decent lacing as i sip .<ssssss>the smell be of piny hop , really strong and bitter .<ssssss>not strong in a strong citrus , or piney way , just bitter strong .<ssssss>there be some pine and fruit note in there , but they be really overpower by the bitter .<ssssss>the taste be of strong bittering hop , with really slight citrus .<ssssss>some pine in there as well .<ssssss>this be the taste of a really average ipa , in my opinion .<ssssss>the feel be pretty good , nice carb .<ssssss>overall , this be a beer i would not say be bad , but i be very underwhelm by my first shorts brew .<ssssss>
6 6 10 7 8		a : pour a light amber from a 750ml bottle into a tuilp glass , the head almost want to explode from the glass .<ssssss>s : a mild but refreshing aroma of malt and yeast dominate the nose .<ssssss>a slight hint of alcohol be present as well .<ssssss>t : mild and crisp , this beer be the closest beer get to champagne .<ssssss>malt and yeast dominate , with hop almost nonexistant .<ssssss>m : never overpower , a perfectly mild effervescense dance in the mouth .<ssssss>d : without any overpowering attribute , finish the 750ml bottle be not a difficult propostion .<ssssss>my feeling on duvel be mixed .<ssssss>i seem to be in the minority because i feel that duvel be only a above-average beer .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be exceptional , though .<ssssss>
8 9 7 7 7		a : beautiful deep amber color -- too dark for a pale ale , too light for a dark ale .<ssssss>small foamy head , nice carbonation .<ssssss>s : belgian yeast , a bit of smokey ground spice , and something almost honeylike .<ssssss>t : some acidity , cleave like yeastiness , and a bit of vanilla .<ssssss>very interesting -- not much malt or hop , and a very clean finish .<ssssss>m : so nice -- start deep wtih body , go through the carbonation and finish dry .<ssssss>a perfect sip of belgian beer .<ssssss>d : very drinkable , especially for the style and abv .<ssssss>i love regenboog beer so much -- they really know what they be do with flavoring .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		light orange , somewhat cloudy , hopefully from unfiltered hop oils , with a small head after a aggressive pour , though the lacing be sticky and appetizing .<ssssss>big , skunky aroma of fresh cut plant with a deep earthiness from some super dank hop .<ssssss>a sweet , sugar water aroma come from the delicate malt aroma .<ssssss>also smell pretty clean .<ssssss>mmmm , that big , earthy hop taste .<ssssss>what hop be that ?<ssssss>one of the newer variety ?<ssssss>regardless and nice distinctive hop profile .<ssssss>bitterness be all up front and finish extremely clean with only faint hint of residual oils .<ssssss>quite watery for the big flavor this one taste and smell different from the main stream craft ipa , which be a pretty new category i will give it that .<ssssss>i could see how some would be put off by the flavor and aroma , but if they only know how difficult it be to make a beer this complex .<ssssss>great hop profile , whatever it be .<ssssss>
8 9 10 9 6		enjoy at the town hall 6th anniversary party , 10-18-2003 a incredible concoction ... color , a cloudy bronze , with a tight white ring of foam ... aroma be smooth , airy , with light , mellow fruit note , no strong herald appear of what lie in wait ... once we let it drip down the lip , this big , bad-boy assert itself fully , as full-on hop charge the mouth ... lip-smacking , delicious texture ... this ale be thoroughly playful , turn the sens into it be own romper room ... it take we over , and we surrender easily , and can only grasp at hint and whisper to crack through the complexity of this brew ... resounding , ring , eternally at work on the tastebud , bold and bouyant ... now , finally the oak-barrell character come forth , creep into the flavor , but really stay on the sideline , merely pepper the profile , not dominate it ... but it be a monster altogether ... halfway in , my favorite adjective be `` juicy , juicy , juicy '' ... abundant flavor , sturdy and potent , though mouthfeel tend to be thinnish at the end ... full and robust , with a sharp , whiskey-ish taste ... damn , this be good !<ssssss>... throw you dram in the bin , boy , let this be you sin , if you be lucky enough to taste it ... juicy , tingle , tantalize ... but i have to pull back on the drinkability thing , for i could only fit 2?1/2 serve past my lip .<ssssss>oh , i have probably 5 more pint later that night , but could not deal with another taste of this dangerous , but delectable ale .<ssssss>
7 6 7 5 7		i be a sucker for a good rye beer and i buy this without try as we be in a rush .<ssssss>pour a weird brown-orange color and it give a decent tan head .<ssssss>smell of green apple and a sweet malt base , slight hop presence try to give balance and fall over .<ssssss>the taste be very sweet and the rye flavor be often lose in the mix and the hop do not really do much more than offer some bitterness .<ssssss>good mouthfeel and a ok drinker , just not a very well define beer .<ssssss>
7 8 7 8 5		a - bronze w / a 2 finger off white foam head , some nice lacing to boot s - healthy heap of citrus/piney hop , have my mouth water ... t - open w / a slight sweetness but then lead to a mouthful of bittering citrus hop , very tasty .<ssssss>the alcohol presence give the beer a nice warm quality mf - tight crisp , pleasantly full body d - great beer , but although i will purchase/enjoy again , i probably could not see myslef haveing more than one in a session .<ssssss>
9 6 8 8 8		so , this be a new brew from they different from the smokey hill ale list : `` the base malt in smoky hill porter be produce in germany in the home of rauchbier -lrb- bamberg -rrb- over a beechwood fire .<ssssss>this rauchmalt be combine with modest amount of crystal malt and two type of chocolate malt that add sweet and chocolaty note to balance the assertive smoke quality .<ssssss>hop really take a backseat in this style , so as not to interfere with the complex smoky aromatic '' -- free state this pour a very dark brown almost black .<ssssss>thick off brown head give it a creamy look to it .<ssssss>unfortunately , the aroma be weak .<ssssss>some very small tinge of smoke come out , but not much else .<ssssss>fortunately though , the flavor be big .<ssssss>smoked meat , dark plum and caramel malt blend nicely .<ssssss>they website mention and give tribute to alaskan smoked porter and with good merit .<ssssss>while this one be not as rich , deep or delicious as the alaskan , it be well on its way .<ssssss>some may find the alaskan too much , and then this free state version will be right up they alley .<ssssss>minor pine from the hop , but that could be my imagination .<ssssss>this be a nice smoked porter ; good on a cold f % $ ing day .<ssssss>
9 10 9 8 8		i drink this 2005 vintage from the bottle into a champagne glass .<ssssss>this lambic pour a medium pink/violet with about 2 inch of light pink head .<ssssss>the retention be poor as it fall within a minute .<ssssss>the lacing be light and watery .<ssssss>the aroma be wonderful .<ssssss>there be the great funky horse blanket similar to what you get with the saint lamvinus , but this be far superior to the sl because it reward you with great note of sweet raspberry to balance out the tart .<ssssss>the taste be also equally balanced reward the drinker with tartness and just enough sweetne that a true lambic follower be look for to enhance the drinkability .<ssssss>the first sip be lightly sweet with a raspberry and finish with lot of sourness .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be heavy and full and coat you mouth and make you pucker .<ssssss>because this be so balanced its exceedingly drinkable for something so tart .<ssssss>overall , this be a great beer .<ssssss>i would seek this out and cellar it for up 20 year as recommend on the bottle .<ssssss>
8 8 7 5 3		750ml bottle from bevmo .<ssssss>pour a nice cloudy copper color with a short live off white head .<ssssss>observe minimal lacing .<ssssss>the aroma be strong with spice , malt , alcohol and dry plum .<ssssss>the flavor be dominate by a distinct , and distract , hard alcohol taste .<ssssss>other flavor in the background be caramel , malt , and toffee .<ssssss>i be unable to evaluate the hop as the alcohol taste keep get in the way .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be full and satisfying .<ssssss>the finish be long with a big alcohol burn .<ssssss>overall : too strong for I , i pour this one down the drain .<ssssss>i can not rule out that i get a isolate bad bottle -- may re-evaluate again sometime in the future .<ssssss>not recommend .<ssssss>
8 8 7 9 7		if this beer get the least bit warm , look out for the smokey flavor .<ssssss>get ta be ice cold !<ssssss>!<ssssss>!<ssssss>i try this on draft and in bottle at a guinness tasting event .<ssssss>it be ok .<ssssss>i think i enjoy the regular stout better than the bottled draft .<ssssss>i learn a lot at that event but i do not think i would rank guinness as my number one .<ssssss>

7 6 6 8 7		pour a very dark amber colour , mostly red really .<ssssss>head be off-white , just small bubble and not a lot of foam .<ssssss>lace be lovely and thick , as you would expect .<ssssss>look decent , but nothing a 2-year homebrew veteran could not manage .<ssssss>massive sweet smell , but a odd savoury note as well .<ssssss>huge caramel malt mix with a big nuttiness - walnut and macadamia , but a saltiness that border on sweaty .<ssssss>it be a real peanut brittle kind of aroma ; if that weird saltiness could get tone down it could be great .<ssssss>taste be very sweet , but not quite as explosively malty as one might expect .<ssssss>lot of caramel and toffee on there with a underlie fruitiness - sherry , fig and marmalade add a nice tang to the override sweetness .<ssssss>nutty note come through late - caramelised macadamia and peanut brittle , still retain a hint of that salty character from the nose but it be quite successful in temper the sweetness on this occasion .<ssssss>it be still just a big , syrupy-sweet beer , and point for hide that booze behind the smooth , complex sugar .<ssssss>i actually do not love it but i can feel the technique involve on the palate more so than any other aspect , so good work , brother .<ssssss>full and thick body as you would expect , but no real texture to it .<ssssss>can not say it be wonderful .<ssssss>a nicely make beer , but it do not wow I .<ssssss>

8 10 6 8 5		a - tan head quickly dissapate atop a impenetrably black body .<ssssss>crust of foam float atop the glass and mingle with the lacing .<ssssss>s - smell awesome , sweet like creme brulee .<ssssss>a little alcohol back in there too .<ssssss>t - roast bitterness greet I follow by coffee and finally the sweetness of creme brulee .<ssssss>remind I of a really strong latte with extra flavoring to compensate .<ssssss>m - just right for this beer , could be a lil thicker but that could render this beer undrinkable .<ssssss>d - kinda tasty but not something you would want to quaff .<ssssss>
8 10 9 8 9		it pour a beautiful hazy golden with a thick white head that linger for a bit before fading to a ring .<ssssss>lacing hang on nicely .<ssssss>the aroma of this beer be amazing !<ssssss>hop hop and more hop !<ssssss>you name a aroma from hop and you will find it here .<ssssss>it be pungent .<ssssss>it burn and make you go back for more .<ssssss>very deep and complex .<ssssss>citrus , spice , pine ... but not much of the barley make it through .<ssssss>the barley find you tongue but for a split second before the piney bitterness of the hop take over .<ssssss>follow by a citrus , and spiciness .<ssssss>the bitterness hang around well after you have swallow it down .<ssssss>wow this be hoppy !<ssssss>the mouthfeel be great .<ssssss>would not make much of a session beer i do not think because of the intense flavor .<ssssss>definitely go to ruin my taste bud for anything else that be hoppy tonight .<ssssss>a awesome ale !<ssssss>definitely a must try .<ssssss>i be go to buy another to age and try again in a year or so !<ssssss>
7 7 4 6 4		a - pour a reddish brown with a frothy head .<ssssss>s - fairly strong , sweet , almost fruity scent .<ssssss>t - this be a sweet , fruity brown ale with a bitter finish .<ssssss>the taste be more citrus like than most brown .<ssssss>taste be similar to a summer wheat ale .<ssssss>m - carbonation help compensate for light , watery body .<ssssss>d - not my preferred interpretation of the style .<ssssss>i probably would not buy this but would not turn down a free brew .<ssssss>
8 8 4 4 5		a offering from the pierre celi -lrb- creator of the modern day belgian wit , like hoegaarden and celi white -rrb- signature series .<ssssss>mature in kanne cavern -lrb- near the dutch border -rrb- and tout by michael jackson as the `` beer of the year . ''<ssssss>my expectation be very high ... and i will state that i understand completely what happen to a beer when it be aged , these be simply my note on what i tasted .<ssssss>750ml corked and caged bottle with probably the most beautiful screen label i have ever see on a beer bottle .<ssssss>it pour wonderfully , showcase its dark , rich copper color .<ssssss>the head be wonderfully lace and slightly off-white .<ssssss>a submissive cinnamon in the aroma , back by a mix of floral and granola .<ssssss>this be a bone-dry beer .<ssssss>probably the driest beer i have ever taste .<ssssss>bold flavor of cinnamon and husky grain tannin last but a brief second on the palate before they be go .<ssssss>flash of tartness and perhaps some clove .<ssssss>you really have to concentrate and find the flavor , and unfortunately the novelty of age this beer remove most of the flavor .<ssssss>no real sweetness , only hint of florally saccharin remain , give way to the dryness .<ssssss>the dryness work long and hard after the flavor dissipate to continue to dry you palate to the bone .<ssssss>note of oxidation become more and more noticeable as the beer warm .<ssssss>leave my palate feeling unpleasant .<ssssss>not impressed , overall .<ssssss>a very one-dimensional offering , that be too expensive and extremly over-hyped , in my opinion .<ssssss>this be a great example of why some beer should not be age ... some beer simply do not hold up and lose they zest .<ssssss>the bottle and concept be more impressive than the beer .<ssssss>
6 6 8 6 6		a : dark brown with red highlight towards the edge and when hold to light .<ssssss>nice amount of head/carbonation .<ssssss>.<ssssss>a little surprised that it be so close to be white .<ssssss>s : hard for I to pick up anything here .<ssssss>in fairness , my sinus have be give I a little trouble lately .<ssssss>can smell a little roastiness .<ssssss>not bad .<ssssss>t : nice roasty flavor .<ssssss>slight coffee , chocolate .<ssssss>m : well carbonated , dry , smooth .<ssssss>d : could easily drink several of these .<ssssss>for a porter , it be fairly mild and light .<ssssss>low abv and nice mouthfeel make this go quickly .<ssssss>certainly nothing groundbreaking .<ssssss>if upland be a band , bad elmer would be a filler song for they album .<ssssss>
4 7 2 8 7		on tap at the brewery .<ssssss>the beer arrive at my table in a standard pint glass .<ssssss>there be not head to be find .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>no carbonation seem to be present at all for that matter .<ssssss>the color of the beer itself be vibrant amber with golden/orange hue .<ssssss>not a great start .<ssssss>the nose be a little subdue for the style but i still get the generic banana and clove , a bit of spice and a nice malty background .<ssssss>the initial flavor be ripe banana and other sweet fruit .<ssssss>from here on out the clove and heavy dose of spice take over and never really leave .<ssssss>clove and cinnamon seem to be the culprit here .<ssssss>the taste be good ; do not get I wrong , i just prefer a more balanced tasting brew in this category .<ssssss>the mouthfeel seem to be spot on with a light-medium body and silky smooth feeling over my tongue , however it lack one thing ... carbonation .<ssssss>as this be the way it be serve to I i feel as though i have the right to review it as such .<ssssss>there be zero carbonation in this glass of beer which be a killer for it .<ssssss>overall , i think this have the potential to be a quite solid dunkelweizen .<ssssss>it would have be vastly better if the spice and clove be cut back a bit in order to let the banana shine , and if it be carbonate - these two crucial area really hurt its overall score .<ssssss>
8 4 8 6 7		review from note .<ssssss>look like a standard yellow pilsener , good clarity with decent frothy head , smell very faintly of a pale malt , can not find any hop in the nose at all .<ssssss>taste of a strong ` hard water ' aspect with its mineral overtone lay on top of a standard pilsner malt and whisper thin saaz in the very background , that could have stand magnification imho .<ssssss>body be light crisp and refreshingly carbonated .<ssssss>this be a `` ok '' sturdy workhorse of a german pilsener , best use in session or as a palate recovery tool between other , more complex offering .<ssssss>
9 8 10 8 8		bomber to pint glass base on the recommendation write on the bottle .<ssssss>switch to a oversized wine glass after the first of many pour .<ssssss>do yourself a favor and use a wine glass with this one .<ssssss>$ 12.00 at my bottleshop .<ssssss>a : the head from a gentle first pour produce 4 finger of billow , puffy , and eggshell color foam .<ssssss>endless bubble be probably only one source for the incredible retention that this beer display .<ssssss>when it decide to recede , the head pull itself away from the edge of the pint glass , leave a domed cap and clump of sea foam lace .<ssssss>one of the most impressive head that i have come across .<ssssss>the body be between light and medium in saturation , mango orange in hue and 95 % clear .<ssssss>on the last pour however , the body turn completely hazy & nearly opaque as the yeast sediment be suspend in solution .<ssssss>s : above average malt content : healthy cereal , caramel and grain , all toast .<ssssss>keep the malt at bay , be a heavy hand of american hop , flaunt strong piney and tropical fruit aroma .<ssssss>heavily yeasty , with a predominant leafy aroma and a light mustiness .<ssssss>t & m : tongue scathing hop on the front end of the palate , with soothing sweet maltiness mid to back end .<ssssss>moderate sweetness offset the bitterness , which i can only assume would have be much higher with lower malt level .<ssssss>minerally texture with fine fizzy , super lively and tongue tingling carbonation .<ssssss>saliva seem to evacuate the mouth on the extremely dry finish .<ssssss>d : yulesmith summer have confirm my immediate opinion of alesmith after try they ipa : as far as appearance and mouthfeel be concern , this brewery have master the art of bottle conditioning india pale ale .<ssssss>overall a good dipa base on aroma and flavor , but a excellent dipa base on other ratable category .<ssssss>still , not quite worth the $ 12 price tag in my opinion .<ssssss>i would visit again and again , however , if i could find it price in the $ 8 - $ 9 range , which be probably closer to what most people pay .<ssssss>
6 7 8 6 6		incredibly see through grapefruit pink/yellow .<ssssss>small layer of white head that do not last more then a couple seconds but do leave some lacing .<ssssss>some slight activity but the color be really turn I off from the start .<ssssss>some ok citrus pull through , mainly .<ssssss>grapefruit and lemon , hop be minimally present .<ssssss>i be get a almost sour like scent .<ssssss>one of the weirdest taste i have ever see in a ipa .<ssssss>it start off with sour lemon and orange and grapefruit mixture that blend together in a very odd way , and follow with a malty grainy flavor before lead into moderately sharp hop kick .<ssssss>a little bit hot in the beginning and middle which probably add to the weird flavor .<ssssss>
5 5 4 6 6		appearance : pour a clear light amber color with a wisp of a filmy head ; it retain like a blanket but do not leave any lace smell : grainy and slightly fruity , with a hint of treacle taste : grainy opening , with a bit of stone fruit and a develop butterscotch treacle by mid-palate as the diacetyl kick in ; after the swallow , the mineral undertone add another dimension that carry through to the finish mouthfeel : medium body with gentle carbonation ; a bit watery drinkability : i guess it be the sweeetness that make this popular but the beer have so many drawback to my palate that i do not know where to begin<ssssss>
8 6 8 8 4		serve on-tap at mad mex in columbus , ohio in a snifter glass .<ssssss>a : red dark honey , it pour with a big creamy head that die to a good film .<ssssss>s : sweeet hop and alcohol , with a strange moldy twang on earthy , citrus , and piney hop combine with some grapefruit .<ssssss>the moldy twang be pungent like cheese .<ssssss>t : caramel sweet malt with candied orange and piney , citrus hop .<ssssss>the bright hop and candy linger .<ssssss>m : syrupy , creamy , frothy , but crisp with the hop .<ssssss>d : only ok for the style .<ssssss>
8 8 9 7 7		the aroma on here ... wow .<ssssss>very rich , even for a porter .<ssssss>full of espresso , bitter chocolate and all thing malt .<ssssss>just like sniff a cold mocha .<ssssss>mouthfeel here be very creamy .<ssssss>body be a thick mix of coffee and dark chocolate -lrb- but mostly coffee -rrb- in harmony with one another .<ssssss>this do not turn exceptionally bitter until the finish .<ssssss>there , the finish feature a moderate hop bite and some bitter coffee to give a somewhat astringent end to the swallow .<ssssss>the coffee certainly hang around a while afterwards .<ssssss>this be a very aggressive porter .<ssssss>i respect it for that .<ssssss>drinkability will be harm for that reason , at least for I .<ssssss>those who want a thick , punch you in the face porter should turn to this one .<ssssss>
7 6 7 4 5		pour a light gold hue 1 finger worth of white foam for a cap that stand up fairly well for a macro .<ssssss>smell of cereal grain light malt with a hint of banana with a touch of alcohol to boot .<ssssss>taste the banana note become much more evident back with a slight corn/grain taste mouthfeel be light yet kind of chewy in a way not too bad actually drinkability this be along with all of macro fizzy yellow brew , throw 30 in the cooler and a ton of ice and enjoy all day nothing wrong with it just nothing to blow you mind taste wise .<ssssss>
9 5 7 9 8		pour a deep , dark amber , with head that just will not quit .<ssssss>nice clarity .<ssssss>base on what i remember from this beer the last time i have it , i as expect more hop aroma .<ssssss>note of bread , caramel .<ssssss>i say the hop be there , they just do not jump up my nose .<ssssss>nothing spectacular here .<ssssss>ahhh ... .<ssssss>there be the hop !<ssssss>beautiful .<ssssss>resiny and spicy .<ssssss>citrus note slice through the sweet backbone .<ssssss>after the 3rd sip or so , i notice malty sweetness .<ssssss>a bit sticky on my lip .<ssssss>spicy counterpart of the hop character balance it out , but not quite enough .<ssssss>overall , great work from stone .<ssssss>i look for this beer whenever i can , but i can not find it in kansa .<ssssss>a real treat indeed .<ssssss>
6 8 6 6 7		pour auburn or redish amber with a decent , quickly diminish head .<ssssss>vague aroma of nut and malt .<ssssss>body be light , smooth , with a abrupt bitter end .<ssssss>like drinking water with a mildly good smell and a aftertaste .<ssssss>not impressed , but i rarely be with amber 's .<ssssss>oh well .<ssssss>
4 2 2 2 6		pale in color with decent head and a awful smell .<ssssss>you could drink these all day long but why would you want to ?<ssssss>this be a great beer if you be in high school and have not experiend real beer , but other than that , its a extremely dissapointing beer in flavor and smell .<ssssss>this beer be so poor that it almost turn I off to domestic beer altogether until i find rouge and highland .<ssssss>
7 5 8 7 4		try this around the time of release -lrb- early september -rrb- as to get it at its freshest .<ssssss>a - normal head and lacing , nothing special s - at first it smell like a pumpkin pie bake in a oven , if it be feasible to have you head directly above it .<ssssss>however after sniff it for a while it become overwhelming especially the coriander ?<ssssss>they overuse .<ssssss>t - well the pumpkin be definitely noticeable at first , however the spice wash out most of it after a few sip , the alcohol be hide well , however the excessive amount of malt use , couple with the high alcohol level seem to ruin the point of a pumpkin beer -lrb- traditionally lower to medium alcohol full body brew -rrb- and make it very sweet .<ssssss>m - well at this level of alcohol it be hard not to have a syrupy brew , however it be lighter than most 9 % brew .<ssssss>d - well the drinkability be not bad , for whatever reason though sniff it alone will start to make I feel a little queasy .<ssssss>well the people at southern tier certainly enjoy take creative licensing when brewing beer , i just do not agree with the style in which they choose to do so .<ssssss>
6 6 8 8 6		pour into my samichlaus tulip a hazy murky brown , with red highlight .<ssssss>head appear and disappear quite quickly .<ssssss>very little lacing .<ssssss>smell be oddly subdue .<ssssss>you can sense the belgian yeast , both fruity and spicy , and a bit of malt , but little else .<ssssss>flavor be much better .<ssssss>slightly sweet , with hint of date , fig , green apple , and even a tiny bit of wintergreen mint .<ssssss>ever so slight bitter hop finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel be thick and syrupy , but one sip do not beg for another .<ssssss>drinkability be good , but the alcohol do make itself present after a glass .<ssssss>
6 7 7 9 7		sierra nevada kellerweis hefeweizen pour from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass .<ssssss>a haze yellow in color with no head or lacing to speak of .<ssssss>aroma full of hefeweizen scent , spice , sweetness and fruit note .<ssssss>solid hefeweizen characteristic , funky yeast lend note of banana/bubblegum .<ssssss>distant clove .<ssssss>munich style malt .<ssssss>this could have very well come from germany , as all the flavor be quite authentic .<ssssss>medium body and fairly smooth go down .<ssssss>a very well craft hefe ' .<ssssss>its quite good and a nice departure from the usual hoppy offering from sierra nevada .<ssssss>
8 7 10 8 10		little to no head of which to speak , however , a attractive , creamy ring of tan lace endure throughout .<ssssss>mild chocolate malt scent with overtone of roast nut and alcohol .<ssssss>this be a very straight-forward , satisfying drink .<ssssss>not as thick as many porter with good burnt malt flavor and a surprising crispness .<ssssss>just the faintest sweetness shine through what be otherwise a nicely bitter/smokey beverage .<ssssss>almost terrifyingly drinkable .<ssssss>
8 7 7 9 8		i really like this beer .<ssssss>pour very dark brown , almost black , with a thin vanilla head float on top .<ssssss>i really enjoy the contrast of the sweet honey with the strongly bitter roasted malt .<ssssss>this may be a bad example but it be similar to the experience of take some liquid cold medicine where you know there be a strong pleasant flavor -lrb- honey -rrb- battle with the inherent acridity of it .<ssssss>the result be a hesitant enjoyment of something that simultaneously challenge and entice you .<ssssss>-lrb- ahh go overboard with the beer rhetoric -rrb- .<ssssss>in any case , i have also drink some scottish heather ale and this be make with heather honey which i think be the define underlie flavor of the beer that you can not pinpoint unless you know what you be look for .<ssssss>the heather mirror the honey/roasted malt relationship with a floral trait that have a fine-line for overdo it .<ssssss>if you have just a bit more you would be completely sick of heather , so you be again push the limit of you enjoyment .<ssssss>finally the golding bring you back to earth with the `` oh yea this be beer '' moment and you forget all the turmoil in the other ingredient and round it off with `` damn , what a porter . ''<ssssss>definitely a really cool beer .<ssssss>
6 6 6 4 6		the beer pour with a nice bone white head .<ssssss>it have a mild golden color , but with a moderate maltiness and medium body suggest the use of a low lovibond munich malt in conjunction with a dextrinous `` carapil '' malt to add body .<ssssss>i enjoy the malt characteristic , well do for a pale beer , but the hop be much too subdue .<ssssss>true , galena hop be a nice choice for bittering and cascade be exceptional for flavor and aroma , but what proportion be be use ?<ssssss>the back label suggest `` heavy hop '' and `` a particularly refreshing '' taste .<ssssss>i note very little hop flavor and equally as little aroma .<ssssss>the malt stand out more than anything else .<ssssss>this be not `` refreshing '' at all .<ssssss>the beer mirror none of what i consider to be good ipa 's .<ssssss>the yakima region be know for it be plentiful hop production .<ssssss>my question be : where be they ?<ssssss>the label signify class and tradition .<ssssss>i think this be a tradition worth end .<ssssss>`` two thumb down !<ssssss>!<ssssss>! ''<ssssss>
9 7 5 7 7		2001 vintage .<ssssss>this particular imperial stout pour a small head with very large bubble that dissipate quickly .<ssssss>there be no lacing on the side of my glass .<ssssss>the aroma be that of vinegar in my opinion .<ssssss>it have a smooth taste and a linger aftertaste .<ssssss>

8 10 8 9 7		the smell of this ipa make a great first impression .<ssssss>creamy caramel and whole wheat bread infect my nose with pleasurable anticipation .<ssssss>a bit of grapefruit from the cascade hop , but not as much as other similar ipa 's .<ssssss>i love the egg color foam that thicken in my glass .<ssssss>so far so good !<ssssss>this brew be one of the best example of a robust but balanced american ipa i have ever have .<ssssss>most of the hop use in this beer usually lead to a sharp and unbalanced beer , but somehow they manage to temper the chinook and columbus into something that be get bite and balance .<ssssss>there be a short burst of sharpness that quickly give way to the creaminess i smell .<ssssss>similar to sierra nevada 's torpedo , but less dry and more rich .<ssssss>this be the best connecticut beer i have have so far .<ssssss>i always say , any idiot can pour way too many hop into a brew and call it a ipa , but find the balance between sharpness and smoothness be where the real art lie .<ssssss>i be proud that this beer be brew two town over from I .<ssssss>
8 4 6 7 9		come in a `` beer of the world '' sampler .<ssssss>nice look beer .<ssssss>dark clear golden brown with a frothy white head.aroma be weak , with some slight skunkiness and some grain .<ssssss>this start off like you average american lager , then a small dose of hop hit and finish with a welcome mild malt flavor .<ssssss>very clean mouthfeel , somewhat watery .<ssssss>i could drink this all day .<ssssss>not a great beer , but a good session brew with nothing offensive go on .<ssssss>
7 6 8 6 6		a - very dark brown -lrb- nearly black -rrb- thick body - almost opaque ; thick yet moderate light brown head .<ssssss>i would say this have the appearance of a over-carbonated russian imperial stout .<ssssss>s - strangely enough , this smell like a russian imperial stout as well ; perhaps a tiny bit more sugary , though .<ssssss>i pick up no hint of fruitiness that i would expect for a quadrupel - only toffee , molasses , and a faint hint of dark candy .<ssssss>t - well , it taste like a russian imperial stout as well .<ssssss>there be a hint of candy sweetness up front that be quickly dominate by massive bitterness and then close with quite a bit of booziness .<ssssss>m - ah , now it seem as though it could be a quadrupel - it be much less dense than a stout and have a decent amount of carbonation .<ssssss>if it be not for the taste and aroma , i could buy that i be drink a quad .<ssssss>o - i be thoroughly unimpressed with this beer .<ssssss>it be not bad by any stretch of the imagination , but quite honestly , if i want a russian imperial stout , there be much better option that be far more reasonably price .<ssssss>my local distributor have this price significantly higher than rochefort 10 -lrb- which be what i consider to be the archetype for quad -rrb- .<ssssss>if you be search for a decent quad , i would recommend steer clear of this .<ssssss>if you be open to try a high-priced russian imperial stout , this may suit you fancy .<ssssss>
10 10 6 6 8		oily , thick , jet black with the one finger reddish tan head expect from a russian imperial stout .<ssssss>head fade quickly with light lacing .<ssssss>smell be significantly more complex than any other russian imperial .<ssssss>rich malty and roasty with a lot of chocolate and a hint of coffee , banana , and fig .<ssssss>taste be a massive clash of everything you would expect in a ris just all at the same time and too much spice and fruit without enough malty roastiness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be somewhat watery not at all what i be expect .<ssssss>the beer go down very easy for a ten percenter but , i would not recommend for a session beer .<ssssss>i really do not feel this beer have mature yet .<ssssss>it be ok , but , the taste and mouthfeel simply do not live up to the appearance and smell .<ssssss>i think in another 6 month to a year , i will review this beer again with much better score in the taste and mouthfeel .<ssssss>i actually discuss this with the brewer and he recommend wait until summer '08 and try it again so that be what i will do .<ssssss>
6 4 6 6 5		this beer pour a clear straw-gold color .<ssssss>the head be one inch in height , and recede quickly into sparse lacing .<ssssss>the aroma have a faint hint of biscuity malt , but mostly it be of nothing .<ssssss>the taste be have little more of the biscuity malt than the aroma with the addition of some very mild noble hop .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be light-medium body with lively carbonation .<ssssss>overall , this be a decent beer at best .<ssssss>it be not so bad that i can not finish one bottle , but it be not good enough to rink again .<ssssss>
8 7 8 6 8		this beer pour with a deep , clear , golden color .<ssssss>about a two finger thick , creamy , white/off white head to it .<ssssss>great head retention that leave thick lace along the glass .<ssssss>nose be extremely hoppy - floral hop be the most dominant aroma for this beer .<ssssss>there be hint of some pine and a touch of bready malt .<ssssss>taste be way milder than the nose would lead you to believe .<ssssss>piney hop be at the forefront , lend to some caramel and bready malt , the finish be a extreme dose of floral hop that leave quite the bitter aftertaste to it .<ssssss>at point , the beer feel and taste a touch on the watery side .<ssssss>this beer be medium body -lrb- though on the lighter side -rrb- , slightly overcarbonate .<ssssss>it be a relatively drinkable beer - just nothing that really jump out at you .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		pour from a 12oz bottle into a duvel tulip .<ssssss>serve around 50 degree .<ssssss>a : very clear beer here with good head .<ssssss>well carbonate , i get a good stream of bubble in the glass .<ssssss>good lacing .<ssssss>s : strong hop aroma here with no fruitiness to it .<ssssss>t : the bitterness be a bit un-balanced .<ssssss>it be very piney do not have a fruit/citrus to balance the nose .<ssssss>i like it but it smells/tastes very single hop forward .<ssssss>m : bitter/dry finish that get more `` mouth-puckery '' as drink .<ssssss>squeaky tooth o : decent ipa it have all of good hop characteristic , it be widely available and a good `` go-to '' ipa<ssssss>
8 6 9 7 8		this review be come from my beer log from my england trip .<ssssss>serve in a pint glass from a hand pull .<ssssss>this be my first cask beer and i have it in the garrick inn in stratford upon avon , its a 400 + year old pub and its a wonderful setting .<ssssss>a - dark and only a little activity in the pint .<ssssss>s - do not note t - a slight chessnut taste have a bit of a after bite .<ssssss>m - smooth low carbination d - go down well its a good drink with banger and mash .<ssssss>i would love to have a second and will if i ever find it from a cask agin .<ssssss>
4 7 9 7 9		pour dark brown-slight ruby tint in the bottom of the glass with almost no head.a wisp of foam remain on top of the beer .<ssssss>no lace to speak of .<ssssss>rich chocolate and coffee note on the nose with some slight fruitiness linger in the background taste be a nice chocolate and oatmeal maltiness.there be also some of that fruitiness that i smell and i would say it remind I of berry -- its very faint but its there .<ssssss>good smooth mouthfeel and quite dry and crisp on the finish .<ssssss>you would expect it to be a little stickier or sweeter so i like the fact that its not .<ssssss>drinkability be where this beer really excel -- i see its pretty low in abv but it just seem real easy to drink more than one or 3 of these .<ssssss>i would definitely buy it again .<ssssss>
10 6 9 7 10		birthday gift from robin ... a : perfect look .<ssssss>deep ruby color with a thick mocha color head that disappate fairly quickly .<ssssss>s : only smell i can really get be a pear or light fruit scent .<ssssss>not much else in the scent and not a very strong smell .<ssssss>middle of the road .<ssssss>t : not much new bring to the table on this one .<ssssss>it be ok , but not too much go on for a barrel aged brew .<ssssss>other contender in the same style be much better , m : very good amount of carbonation d : this brew go down perfectly easy .<ssssss>no complaint here at all .<ssssss>all in all , this be a decent brew to try at least once .<ssssss>if you like a decent amount of hop , you might enjoy this a little more .<ssssss>i be not a huge hop guy , so it be kind of mediocre to I .<ssssss>
7 4 4 7 5		light , tan lacing and a thin bit of foam sit at the top of the beer .<ssssss>the beer fade from cola brown to a ruby brown depend on the light .<ssssss>semi sweet chocolate and dry hop make up the smell .<ssssss>weaker scent than a soft drink .<ssssss>the taste start sweet , but bitter hop take up most of the taste .<ssssss>great with red meat , but not complex enough .<ssssss>the mouthfeel leave a lot to be desire .<ssssss>thin , and too much carbonation .<ssssss>i have have better .<ssssss>
10 3 9 4 5		try leffe blonde for the first time and it pour as a lovely golden color with a amazing head .<ssssss>probably the best appear beer that i have ever have , especially when it be not even pour into its signature chalice .<ssssss>lace very well the entire way .<ssssss>smell be of corn and probably some touch of spice but i do not really get to distinguish what spice they be as it fold into the corn aroma and all i could make out be fermented corn .<ssssss>taste like corn , a few spice -lrb- mace perhaps but i doubt it -rrb- , finish with alcohol .<ssssss>i be not able to distinguish anything notable about the taste apart from alcohol and corn .<ssssss>mouthfeel be quite creamy and carbonated just right .<ssssss>there be a slight aftertaste of creaminess that turn I off just a bit so it do not get a perfect score .<ssssss>drinkability suffer from the taste .<ssssss>i can see someone finish those at a exceptional pace if they enjoy the taste but for my personal drinkability , i would not be able to enjoy this as a session beer but rather as a one-of beer .<ssssss>i would probably drink leffe blonde again but only once a year .<ssssss>
7 6 6 4 5		i will be honest right up front : i only pluck this from the wall of euroswill at state line liquor yesterday because i be positive i have never have a beer from bulgaria .<ssssss>so , kamenitza , with it be cheap , boring label and dull straw color it be then .<ssssss>almost no head but do feature stunning clarity .<ssssss>nose be grainy and grassy and blah .<ssssss>all i be go to say be that i be glad this be ice cold .<ssssss>the label say its still fresh so i will take they word for it but this be sour and pretty unpleasant at first .<ssssss>the overcarbonation help hide the taste and the finish be reasonably clean , but the taste itself be sawdusty and simply not very good .<ssssss>back to bulgaria with you , kamenitza .<ssssss>
9 8 10 9 8		11.2 oz .<ssssss>bottle , label `` ale brew with spice '' vintage 2006 .<ssssss>pour into a wide mouth chalice with fluffy , dimpled foam .<ssssss>body be a deep dark sienna brown , with tan foam .<ssssss>look like a trappist ale , mystical and entice .<ssssss>fruity ester in the nose , banana , roasted malt , almond , a touch sweet .<ssssss>taste be a bold mix of motley flavor , but it start out sweet and roasty .<ssssss>there be anise , banana , chocolate , and brown sugar .<ssssss>roasted malt and a touch of hop linger in the finish .<ssssss>as it warm , there be a earthiness that seep in .<ssssss>it beg a comparison to the character of a full body coffee , but without the intense bitterness , and a bit sweeter .<ssssss>bold , complex , and satisfy be adjective that come to mind .<ssssss>smooth mouthfeel , carbonation keep a good head for the duration of the glass .<ssssss>sweetness do not linger on the palate much , but it could hinder the drinkability if you do not like a slightly sweet dark belgian .<ssssss>a sl-o-o-w sipper .<ssssss>
7 9 6 6 7		a : pretty light actually .<ssssss>golden body .<ssssss>i expect more orange .<ssssss>s : big pumpkin with plenty of spice .<ssssss>dead on .<ssssss>t : more of the same as the smell .<ssssss>it be exactly like a real pumpkin .<ssssss>m : medium body but thick with spice .<ssssss>d : not as good as pumpking but still pretty good .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		pour a dark black like a stout .<ssssss>thick , foamy mocha color head upon pour , but most of it disappear .<ssssss>the smell have a hint of chocolate .<ssssss>it be pleasant but not very strong .<ssssss>the beer be pretty light-bodies and drinkable for a stout .<ssssss>taste like a normal stout with chocolate .<ssssss>what i do praise they on be how they use the chocolate .<ssssss>i be not a huge fan of chocolate stout that be overbear .<ssssss>this one seem to get a good balance here .<ssssss>i get a good taste of it that supplement the taste of the beer , but not too much to where i can taste it over the beer .<ssssss>overall a pretty good beer from a pretty good brewery .<ssssss>
7 7 7 5 7		this pour a clear burgundy with thing light tan head .<ssssss>it smell like wild yeast and floral hop with some prune and dark chocolate .<ssssss>it taste strongly of wild yeast , mix with a blend of floral hop and bitter chocolate .<ssssss>it be watery with some carbonation , and have a bitter aftertaste .<ssssss>overall this be very clean , but have that typical belgian taste that i do not particularly care for .<ssssss>not so great for a dark ale .<ssssss>
4 4 5 3 6		well because you have to i be gon na try some macro and just put my thought out there .<ssssss>here be the first .<ssssss>pour a pale yellow , with ton of visible carbonation , big frothy head fade instantly reveal a clear bubbly liquid .<ssssss>no smell , maybe a bit musty but really nothing .<ssssss>taste be so water down and bland .<ssssss>light grain taste , but drink it cold because once it warm its do .<ssssss>smooth and deeply carbonated , drink like a soda .<ssssss>the only reasonable point it get be for drinkibility , if it be ice cold go down well , if its warm , watch out !<ssssss>
6 6 7 8 6		a 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle , send by super-generous and awesome ba hoppymeal a couple month back -lrb- thanks , derek ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>open on a chilly and wet december evening , 6 oz .<ssssss>now and another 6 oz .<ssssss>save for after dinner .<ssssss>sub-title : `` anti-establishment ale '' sub-sub-title : `` every batch diabolically brew to decimate ordinary-average-run-of-the-mill tasting beer '' maple bourbon barrel aged wheat wine ... sound amazing !<ssssss>a : a year-plus old -lrb- young , i be think for a barrel-aged wheat wine -rrb- and hardly a head atop a honey-amber haze pour ; a thin whirl of smoky film and the trimmest ring imaginable .<ssssss>sparse carbonation and a fair amount of fine hanging silt .<ssssss>brief glimpse of cream lacing , but no stay power .<ssssss>i do get that this beer be aged just a bit , but it really do not show much now - other than a very pretty hue .<ssssss>s : mild waft scent of toffee and a more brandy-like booze .<ssssss>alcohol tingle up the nose and down the throat .<ssssss>quite sweet the longer it rest : raisin and fig try in vain to elbow out the phenolic tidal wave .<ssssss>t : a starchy candied orange and bready scone , cover amply by pert spice -lrb- ginger , anise ? -rrb-<ssssss>and woody/sappy hop .<ssssss>barrel-aging lend a hearty ` bourbon ' warmth , vanilla and oak and darker spice .<ssssss>the maple be tough to find , unless we be talk ` tree ' , not ` syrup ' -lrb- not sure which it be ... -rrb- m : creamy feel , the softest carbonation .<ssssss>then the flaming burn of alcoholic heat - a instant cheek-warmer , a spiced bourbon settle squarely in the middle of my tongue .<ssssss>wow , not subtle !<ssssss>a generally medium body , deepen as it coat , with strong stay power .<ssssss>d : i really do not expect to be as disappointed with this as i be -lrb- edit : after post , i be read plenty of review with high praise still , but a handful of poorer one , too -rrb- .<ssssss>kinda lifeless look , milder aroma and a good-but-not-great flavor/feel have I scratch my head a little .<ssssss>have really enjoy so many other from founder , but this be a ` miss ' ... at least in its current state .<ssssss>sorry i do not have the chance to try sooner .<ssssss>
7 4 6 6 5		this beer be sit alone on the shelf , and fit perfectly into the mix-six pack i be fill .<ssssss>i do not want to break up a full sixer , so i grab this one .<ssssss>the one feature of this beer that really stand out be its smell .<ssssss>it really smell like a german pilsner , complete with the green glass and sunlight exposure .<ssssss>normally i kind of like this smell , but its quite off-putting in a ipa .<ssssss>the malt be good but too subtle for the odd hop flavor and aroma .<ssssss>i will be sure to try another style from this chico brewery .<ssssss>
9 10 6 8 8		thanks foofaa for the generous shipping of a growler .<ssssss>pour black with a little bit of head , wholy coffee heaven !<ssssss>this thing smack you in the face with coffee aroma and then hit you again for good measure .<ssssss>like alcoholic coffee the flavor follow the aroma , giant coffee but with suprisingly almost no astringency , quite a feat actually .<ssssss>the one dissapointment with this be the mid-sip and body of the beer , very thin , if this could be pump up to a full bodied beer with the same coffee character it would be out of this world -lrb- for coffee beer fan -rrb- .<ssssss>very glad i get to try this .<ssssss>
7 4 9 6 6		a very nice appearance as this be a light amber ale with a very thick white head from the nitro that leave thick -lrb- can i call it belgian lace -rrb- residue on the glass .<ssssss>i be review the second glass of this ale serve to I as they have a bad practice of serve beer in frozen glass so i have my bartender refill my first glass .<ssssss>the aroma need more hop , it be a little bit malty but not enough for a esb and frankly not enough for a pale ale either .<ssssss>the flavor begin with a mild , golding like bitterness follow by sweet carmelly malt and it finish very clean with no linger bitterness .<ssssss>a good attempt at a esb but it need more of a english pale malt flavor not just more carmel malt and a lot more hop all around .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be excellent as the nitro remind I of a nice cask ale , smooth and clean with just a bit of bite as the brewer at the basin use a mix of nitro and co2 .<ssssss>a nice session ale though it need more hop and a better malt flavor .<ssssss>
6 6 4 6 6		i think i get this from czoch75 , cheer clint !<ssssss>pour a murky chestnut with a sliver of tan head .<ssssss>so-so lacing & average head retention s : caramel , brown sugar & apricot , fade as it warm t : toffee , dryness & a touch of band aid ?<ssssss>?<ssssss>?<ssssss>up front .<ssssss>smokeyness come through as this warm , plus dryness plus some peach & apricot , & a touch of burnt caramel .<ssssss>finish slightly fruitty & smokey with more annoying dryness ; on the verge of cloying mf : kind of thin for the style , prickly carbonation drink okay , i expect a helluva lot more from sprecher .<ssssss>this be just just so-so for a style i truly love<ssssss>
8 6 9 5 6		from 750ml bottle to bruge hybrid glass on 10/21/11 * from note a : it look a bit like a pale golden wheat beer - cloudy golden yellow .<ssssss>a standard pour yield a two finger head .<ssssss>nice retention , nice lacing .<ssssss>s : like a freshly starched shirt .<ssssss>t : it be hot as hell .<ssssss>hint of raisin and prune .<ssssss>weird , this bottle be not that old .<ssssss>as it move back , there be a solid dose of banana and yeast .<ssssss>nothing too special here .<ssssss>m : hugely thick and creamy .<ssssss>almost too much so , in fact .<ssssss>o : uinta 's crooked smile be underwhelming .<ssssss>i be still confuse why the brewing world feel like we need imperial pilsner .<ssssss>the entire purpose of a good pilsner be balance .<ssssss>and like so many other offering within this subcategory , crooked smile be about as unbalanced as you can get .<ssssss>do yourself -lrb- and you wallet -rrb- a favor and pass on this .<ssssss>if you be look for a top shelf uinta brew , grab they impy stout labyrinth or they imperial pumpkin beer oak jack .<ssssss>
5 5 6 7 5		from a bomber into a pint glass at surfside sushi in pb the bottle be beautiful .<ssssss>brown glass .<ssssss>cap have the nice echigo logo and name .<ssssss>the front label be a piece of art -- literally there be a reproduction of some japanese art there , amidst the japanese lexicon .<ssssss>the back label actually have a little english which state that it be import from japan .<ssssss>do not really say that it be a rice lager , but it do say koshihikarus echigo beer .<ssssss>the beer pour a clear golden yellow .<ssssss>the head be virtually non existent like in many macro brew .<ssssss>faint aroma of caramel , and perhaps i imagine a hop smell .<ssssss>on the tongue it be crisply carbonate and have a meek maltiness , but be this from the rice ?<ssssss>bitterness be low .<ssssss>towards the end , there be a weird fruitiness .<ssssss>not the messy sort of ale fruit ester fruitiness -- maybe it be some sort of hop flavor .<ssssss>apple and pear .<ssssss>totally random , but it make this somewhat interesting .<ssssss>finish be neutral .<ssssss>overall : the bottle be really pretty .<ssssss>
9 10 7 8 9		be mean to try these beer for awhile .<ssssss>pour a very deep straw color at the bottom turn toward deep garnet at the top of my franzi glass with million of carbonation bubble lurch toward the huge white thin whispy head of four inch .<ssssss>leave a very chunky lace .<ssssss>not usually my favorite style but christ almighty this be a fine smell hefe .<ssssss>bubblegum , sweet clove , banana , and plantaine even .<ssssss>the wheaty aroma be soft , sweet and delicate and just scream smell I .<ssssss>floral and juicy no sure i have smell a better hefe .<ssssss>not as juicy as the nose would indicate and a bit thin in mouthfeel but still a fine hefe .<ssssss>lose the big bubblegum appeal in the aroma as well , which take a backseat to the clove and banana .<ssssss>wheat be grainy and starchy .<ssssss>not sure i drink this one cold enough .<ssssss>otherwise a hefe i could drink allday .<ssssss>
7 9 6 7 7		thanks to riccymon for the generous extra in we ip trade .<ssssss>12oz bottle into a duvel tulip -lrb- bottled on 4/8/09 -rrb- .<ssssss>a auspicious and oxymoronic start : fat dog be thin !<ssssss>the color 's depth lighten to watered-down cola at the edge while the core be a translucent seal brown .<ssssss>the crackling tan head quickly recede to a tiny wisp of bubble ; revive foam with a vigorous swirl , but not for long .<ssssss>the aroma have hold up nicely consider the age .<ssssss>chocolate chip cookie dough , raisin , and creamy vanilla oatmeal lead the way , as the background present a touch of soil , earthy hop , and black patent malt .<ssssss>lot of layer , all work well together .<ssssss>interesting flavor profile -- start a bit vinous with semi-sour lactic note that be a bit off-putting , but quickly transition to a finish of roasted malt , coffee , and baker 's chocolate .<ssssss>the oat seem to have diminish with age , and the carbonation be too high at first -lrb- settle after 15 minute or so -rrb- .<ssssss>thin body as the appearance suggest , with a smooth finish and linger bitter roastiness .<ssssss>a big plus be that the alcohol be very well-hidden -lrb- another potential byproduct of aging -rrb- .<ssssss>fat dog be not a bad beer by any stretch , but it be probably not in my top 50 imperial or oatmeal stout .<ssssss>still glad i get to try it , though .<ssssss>
7 5 7 7 9		serve in a pint glass .<ssssss>a : creamy head -lrb- about half a finger -rrb- .<ssssss>hazy gold , but pale and transparent .<ssssss>s : sour beeriness .<ssssss>not very strong , not very impressive .<ssssss>t : mm , more flavour than i expect !<ssssss>the bitterness present have the taste of citrus peel .<ssssss>the label read `` spicy .<ssssss>aromatic .<ssssss>zesty . ''<ssssss>well , even though it be not aromatic at all , it be somewhat spicy , and `` zesty '' be the perfect adjective for this beer .<ssssss>otherwise smooth and unassuming .<ssssss>m : mostly wishy-washy , but with a little something -- this would be the spice -- to keep thing interesting .<ssssss>d : good , light , and indefinitely drinkable at 3.8 % .<ssssss>recommend above most other british beer ; it have more character .<ssssss>
8 10 8 9 7		smell like the firestation do after all the fire truck get back from a large fire .<ssssss>i love that smell !<ssssss>nice dark brown to black color .<ssssss>nice thick head when pour into a pint glass .<ssssss>taste be great i love the complexity add to the beer by the addition of `` smoke '' to a porter .<ssssss>you can taste the malty sweetness , but then the smokey taste take over .<ssssss>i really like dark beer and this be one of my more memorable beer .<ssssss>i just hope that dan bring it back since it be a `` unplugged beer '' .<ssssss>i could drink it all day long .<ssssss>
8 7 8 9 7		my beer guy over here in arizona just start stock this , i be quite pleased to pick up a bomber .<ssssss>pour into my pint glass .<ssssss>a - black as can be .<ssssss>hold it up to various light try to see through ... i get maybe half a centimeter of dark dark mahogany on the bottom edge of the glass , otherwise this thing be pure black .<ssssss>do not have exactly what i would call a head , but there a khaki ring on top .<ssssss>s - faint at first , bourbon be detectable , along with a bit of roastiness .<ssssss>as the beer warm , there be a sweetness that come out , almost like caramel malt .<ssssss>t - this be hard to describe .<ssssss>it be dark , faint roasted chocolate malt , the bourbon be detectable again in the middle , and a pretty decent linger hoppiness on the back of the tongue , which i would guess be what classify this as a strong ale .<ssssss>a bit of warm alcohol in the swallow and when it hit the stomach , i be very aware that this be 10 % as far as feeling go , and yet it do not tasty too boozy -lrb- though it be there . -rrb-<ssssss>alcohol come out a little bit more for I as the beer warm , i think the hint of bourbon may have take a backseat , though my palate could just be adjust .<ssssss>as in the smell , warm bring about a bit of sweetness ... i can not place it though .<ssssss>m - mouth coating , a little bit thick , carbonation be very slight towards the end of the sip , but i think it work pretty well for the style .<ssssss>it feel how i like a good 10 % brew to , somewhat syrupy but not overdo .<ssssss>d - this be a sipper , but i have no problem finish the 22 oz up .<ssssss>very tasty and unique .<ssssss>as this get warmer and sweeter , i be somewhat remind of a barley wine on the second half of the taste , though the roasty beginning take it somewhere else .<ssssss>

6 8 6 6 7		bit of a limp ice tea pour .<ssssss>clearly a warmer -- nice brown malty body .<ssssss>nice aroma , blend between surprising coffee node and bread and toffee blend .<ssssss>not huge and not too complex , but nice and balanced .<ssssss>taste not quite as balanced , fall too far towards the toffee sweet end .<ssssss>bready candy with nothing bitter to balance it .<ssssss>candy be nice -- there be a reason kid like it so much -- but i usually like a bit more in my beer .<ssssss>
5 4 2 3 5		on tap from the parent ' keg .<ssssss>g : pour into the ubiquitous bud light pint glass .<ssssss>a : very pale color with load and load of carbonation .<ssssss>white head that dissipate very quickly .<ssssss>little lacing .<ssssss>s : slightly metallic and grainy .<ssssss>nothing exceptional here .<ssssss>no hop presence , and any `` malt '' be simply the adjunct .<ssssss>t : about the same as the smell , though the mouthfeel be certainly worse than the taste .<ssssss>m : very light .<ssssss>the carbonation level of seltzer water .<ssssss>way , way , way too carbonated .<ssssss>no thank you .<ssssss>although , the carbonation level be much better on tap than out of the bottle .<ssssss>d : this be `` drinking game '' drinkable .<ssssss>it be not skunky and i will not spit it out , but it lack any real taste and the mouthfeel be absolutely atrocious .<ssssss>
8 6 9 7 7		pour from tap at brewery : a : copper pale , probably from crystal malt , with short lasting 1/2 inch head .<ssssss>s : medium hop aroma of citrus and pine .<ssssss>probably a blend of c hop .<ssssss>would expect more hop aroma from a apa .<ssssss>seem to not be dry hop .<ssssss>t : balance with nice malt flavor back up with a clean bitterness .<ssssss>once again , hop flavor be subdue as it seem later addition hop be not utilize .<ssssss>m : good carbonation with a medium mouth feel o : a nice pale ale that seem stick between english -lrb- malt dominate -rrb- and american -lrb- hop flavor dominant -rrb- pale characteristic .<ssssss>more hop addition would greatly benefit this beer .<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 8		compare to my last review of swallow wit on-tap , i do not think the bottled version hold up to a fresh pint .<ssssss>i still enjoy and recommend it .<ssssss>i just could not find some of the same flavor .<ssssss>the aroma be more dull , but the flavor have a nice mix of sweet wheat grain -lrb- bready -rrb- with creamy ringwood and spice .<ssssss>the ringwood sort of act like a nice layer of frosting on the palate .<ssssss>yummy .<ssssss>give it a try , just do not expect a traditional wit .<ssssss>
8 5 8 9 8		my first amber mrzen of the '09 season -- only one i have actually see so far .<ssssss>bottled 05/09 .<ssssss>a -- deep , clear amber with orange highlight and a thick , off-white head .<ssssss>s -- light dm with some spicy hop back , very low aroma all around .<ssssss>a little disappointing .<ssssss>t -- the flavor make up for the aroma -- big hit of that bready , toasty , malt character so expect in a bavarian oktoberfest .<ssssss>sweet at the start , finish dry with the quick hit of spicy hop .<ssssss>h-p always seem to get they okto to finish dryer than most , give it a almost tannin note to it , but not to a point of distraction .<ssssss>very good .<ssssss>m -- medium body with a soft to crisp mouthfeel .<ssssss>d -- oh yeah .<ssssss>while not great on a end-of-summer day , you know this will be the type of beer to reach for when the day start to shorten into fall and winter .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 9		great beer .<ssssss>really enjoy a bomber from star .<ssssss>a : black with a brown head .<ssssss>really dark .<ssssss>n : hoppy as hell .<ssssss>piney and citrussy .<ssssss>cocoa powder .<ssssss>t : load of bitter , dry , dark cocoa powder .<ssssss>rich and complicate with load of fruit from the hop .<ssssss>perfectly palanced .<ssssss>mouthfeel : lighter then most riss .<ssssss>less oily and thick .<ssssss>really nicely balanced bitterness and fruitiness .<ssssss>dry .<ssssss>drinkability : superb .<ssssss>
8 6 10 6 7		pour a browney-orange -lrb- amber , i guess you could say -rrb- hue , very clear appearance with no sediment .<ssssss>good , very dense creamy head , not go anywhere .<ssssss>good bit of webbed lacing .<ssssss>the soap from the bathroom linger on my hand and be encroach on the smell of this beer , but i think it be also just a bit weak .<ssssss>possibly pour too cold .<ssssss>it smell quite sweet , with a cinnamon-sugar element as well as a fairly distinct sour element reminiscent of underripe grape or cranberry .<ssssss>quite nice but could use more aroma .<ssssss>that mouthfeel be magnificent .<ssssss>very , very creamy and smooth , like kilkenny only smoother , feel like i be pour soothing cream down my throat .<ssssss>flavour be underwhelming , either as a result or just coincidence .<ssssss>slight sour element with the slightest hint of a burn flavour on there .<ssssss>not much of the cinnamon promise on the nose .<ssssss>a hint of apple on the front but just a hint .<ssssss>finish be slightly bittersweet , could maybe use a slight bit of extra hop , but it would be very easy ot overdo this , and oh !<ssssss>that mouthfeel ... seriously , do not change a hop for I .<ssssss>* drool *<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 5		this unusual norwegian lambic be notable for its nordic mix of red fruit and spice .<ssssss>but the brewer take these scandinavian flavor and tweak they - to the usual tart red currant and red berry fruit they add not a sensation of green cardamom , as would be expect , but of black cardamom .<ssssss>the beer pour a lovely cedar-red with a eggshell head that die down to lightest lace .<ssssss>the initial nose be funk and leather .<ssssss>the front taste be the smoky camphor of the black cardamom , with the tart red fruit in back .<ssssss>the moderate carbonation seem to drive the smokiness all over the mouth and add to the dry finish .<ssssss>this beer be clearly make for food , and it pair well with smoke ham -lrb- speck -rrb- , smoked fish -lrb- mackerel -rrb- on dark rye bread - and it would probably be great with salt cod and smoke cheese too .<ssssss>these be traditional scandinavian food , and so you would expect a brew describe on the bottle as a `` norwegian farmhouse ale '' to match with these .<ssssss>i can imagine that the unusual black cardamom would seem off-putting if the beer be drunk by itself , and not with a food to complement it .<ssssss>it be a unique offering but not for everyone , no , not at all and not for casual drinking .<ssssss>
8 10 9 8 9		pour a radiant orange that bubble like champagne .<ssssss>have a light fluff finger length head that gently fade into a light lace .<ssssss>have a nice pear or fruitish fragrance .<ssssss>a slight balm of wheat .<ssssss>smell almost warm .<ssssss>the hide 9 % be there .<ssssss>not very typical of pale ale .<ssssss>taste be a very compound malt .<ssssss>with a luscious beginning .<ssssss>the alcohol make its presence in the middle of all the blast of flavor .<ssssss>it have a tart to it .<ssssss>that be smoothen out with almost a taste of banana .<ssssss>very soft on the palate .<ssssss>have a very present carbonation that be wonderful on the tongue .<ssssss>the warmth from the alcohol be not over power at all and actually make you want to taste it again to see if its different at all .<ssssss>be a pleasent pale ale that drink generous .<ssssss>not full body like some other ale out there .<ssssss>not as yeasty as other unibroue beer that i have have .<ssssss>
8 7 7 5 8		appearance : pure golden color with a sparkling white head .<ssssss>ideal look beer after be pour from the half liter can into a glass .<ssssss>smell : not too much here , typical euro lager smell with a hint of citrus from the ascorbic acid that be add here accord to the label .<ssssss>taste : this taste kind of fake , and the lemon citrusy taste that come through be that off citrus taste that lemon cleaning product have .<ssssss>otherwise it be a typical , not too bad , drinkable euro pale .<ssssss>
8 5 7 7 7		pour a dark chestnut , and be practically black in the glass .<ssssss>two finger of tan head to start , steadily but slowly recede .<ssssss>lot of lacing .<ssssss>smell be a little bit dull , nothing really stand out .<ssssss>it seem malty , but muted .<ssssss>a balance of sweet and sour rather than the usual sweet to bitter you might expect in a stout .<ssssss>faint chocoalte , caramel and nuttiness make up the front half , with a almost fruity finish that be just a bit sour .<ssssss>different , but pleasant .<ssssss>on the lighter side for a stout , with prickly carbonation .<ssssss>suitable for its flavour profile , but do not bring a lot to the table .<ssssss>certainly not a tough beer to drink , but a little dull for my taste .<ssssss>perhaps a sessioner for a pub visit , when you be focus more on the company than the beer .<ssssss>
8 7 6 8 6		appearance : dark red brown with a quickly fall off-white bubbly head .<ssssss>leave a pretty decent amount of lacing .<ssssss>smell : warm roasted nutty malt and hint of hop .<ssssss>taste : very smooth roasted grain , slightly sweet with light hop .<ssssss>leave a small amount of bitterness on the finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel : good amount of carbonation make the brew feel lighter than the flavor would imply .<ssssss>pretty smooth after thing settle down .<ssssss>drinkability : nice even balance and well round .<ssssss>not too dense but lot of flavor that do not get boring or overbearing .<ssssss>comment : i have try this on in the past and know that it be a decent / above average beer .<ssssss>i recently buy the leine 's explorer pack and this be far and away my favorite in there -lrb- fall pack with the oktoberfest -rrb- .<ssssss>i would buy this one again but as a solo 6-pack as the rest of the beer include be not anything special .<ssssss>
6 8 8 10 9		12 ounce bottle to a pilsner glass a : bronze , good head , lace s : lot of sweet bready malt , a bit of hop .<ssssss>t : hop hit first then a big juicy malt , as the hop make a return .<ssssss>m : the carbonation lift the malt so there not overly sweet and the hop come in to round out the flavor and leave a bitter sweet taste in the mouth .<ssssss>drive I to take another swig .<ssssss>d : balanced perfectly this be a well craft beer , nice balance between hop and malt they work together to make one amazing brew .<ssssss>this be the only dourtmunder i have ever have and it be great .<ssssss>so i have nothing to compare it to , remind I of a amber ale .<ssssss>this be highly drinkable .<ssssss>
9 8 8 10 9		get this beer for the season with halloween come up .<ssssss>pour very nicely with a small head and nice golden color .<ssssss>immediately i could smell the nutmeg and pumpkin and be immerse into fall .<ssssss>dogfish head have the perfect blend of the pumpkin , nutmeg , and other spice that be add to the beer .<ssssss>a slightly malty aftertaste give this beer a amazing overall taste .<ssssss>overall , this be a perfectly balance summer ale .<ssssss>
6 7 6 6 9		a - dark amber , almost red .<ssssss>almost no head .<ssssss>s - wow , intense caramel smell upfront .<ssssss>sweet and dark , malt be almost overpowering .<ssssss>very simple .<ssssss>t - brighter in the taste , the carmel flavor calm down a bit .<ssssss>very light hoppiness , almost completely hide .<ssssss>simple like the smell .<ssssss>caramel come back again in the aftertaste .<ssssss>m - a light creaminess , carbonation be not great .<ssssss>d - very drinkable , probably the best aspect of it .<ssssss>
5 5 6 9 7		morimoto black obi soba ale 22oz bomber recent bottle , dorinku 11/06 medium pour in a english pint pour dark brown with mahogony highlight , with a average mostly diminish fizzy very light brown head .<ssssss>smell of moderate smokiness and brown sugar and light molasses .<ssssss>taste be upfront strong bitter and moderate sweet and sour burnt cookie feel follow by a strong nutty slightly piney bitterness with light molasses on a long finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel be light to medium , oily , fizzy , and moderately astringent .<ssssss>overall , this beer be interesting , the taste be unique , as there be a sweet and lightly sour feel that cling all the way through the tasting session .<ssssss>the rest be kind of bland and usual though .<ssssss>
7 6 7 9 8		12 oz bottle in my stone ipa flute .<ssssss>the pour initially look like a clear copper in the glass but hold it up to the light actually reveal a good bit of suspend solid float throughout the liquid .<ssssss>the head on this consist of roughly 3 billowy finger of bright white foam , which retain with a tight finger of froth that then leave some heavy swath of lace sticking to the side of the glass .<ssssss>that tea stand right out in the aroma , mingle with some more floral accent and then be cut through by note of bitter citrus and a strong fresh piney feel .<ssssss>some sweeter fruit character and malt pretty much get relegate to the back here and im a bit bummed to find some stiff warmth emerge as this warm .<ssssss>like the nose , grapefruit and pine have some assertiveness on the palate , while some brighter fresh fruit flavor -lrb- im really get some orange and lemon zest out of this -rrb- push out from the edge of the profile .<ssssss>that fruit work its way into the backend here , meld with the sweet sugar of the malt and then linger with a final steady pithiness from the bitterness .<ssssss>the tea flavor be present throughout the taste and while it do have a somewhat general herbal texture to it , its not come off as strong as what you would normally find be give off from hop and im therefore find it a bit more quench on the palate than i would have think .<ssssss>the mouthfeel have some heft to it but it seem just shy of call it full body .<ssssss>this do have a firmness to the carbonation , which be interwoven with a silky oiliness and herbal texture that at least help work the overall feel into more of a smooth crispness in the mouth .<ssssss>that over 9 % abv be the real wtf here for I , as its not necessarily hot or even overly warm but it just start to wear on the palate after a while .<ssssss>i just dont understand why it need to be that high with this beer .<ssssss>there definitely some thing to like with this latest stone collaboration but then also some thing that didnt quite work for I as well .<ssssss>i really like the use of the tea here .<ssssss>it work well not only with the type of bitterness that be present but also the fruit flavor that those pacifica and sorachi ace hop bring to the table as well , give the flavor profile a well tune and refreshing feel .<ssssss>unfortunately , i dont think that this translate nearly as well to the aroma , which i often struggle to really get any kind of robustness out of -lrb- which may have something to do with the age of this more than anything -rrb- and as mention before , that too-high abv just kill any kind of thirst quenching drinkability that the flavor be try so hard to bring to the table .<ssssss>overall though , there be more to like than dislike here and id love to see more experimentation with tea-infused ipa from all of the brewery involve .<ssssss>this one be one worth check out if you see it on the shelf .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		12oz , thanks sean !<ssssss>pour a dark brown , thin head , light lacing .<ssssss>delicately use smoke which mix campfire with just a hint of meaty smoke and hickory , a touch of oats , cocoa , coffee , roast .<ssssss>really well balanced , nice integration of the smoke .<ssssss>a little on the thin side for the body but it aid the drinkability .<ssssss>pretty damn balanced , well make - so solid .<ssssss>
6 5 6 5 9		i decide to try the heineken keg can because i have hear that the beer taste noticeably fresher .<ssssss>this do not seem to be the case in my opinion , in fact i find the taste to be a notch more to the bland side as compare to standard bottled heineken .<ssssss>while certainly not the greatest european lager in the world i do enjoy a heineken from time to time usually with pizza or wing , or at a restaurant when it be the best option .<ssssss>i will be stick to bottle or tap however .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 9		pour from a bomber into a nonic , hop trip be a clear bronze with a nice size , bone colored head that be long lasting and leave moderate , foamy sheet of lace .<ssssss>aroma be all fresh pnw hop .<ssssss>i really like the softer subtly of wet hop , and they be nicely showcase here .<ssssss>taste be more of the same , nicely round hop flavor , a bit spicy , with just enough bitterness to balance the pale malt .<ssssss>nice and easy drinking pale ale , this would be a great transitional beer for those that do not think they like hoppy beer .<ssssss>mouthfeel be on the thin sider , and a bit oily , but there be enough carbonation to keep it pleasant .<ssssss>this be not the greatest tasting beer in the world , but it be very nicely do , and it be lightness in body , flavor and alcohol make it highly drinkable .<ssssss>
9 9 8 10 8		a - pour copper penny brown with a nice head that quickly settle .<ssssss>s - maplewood smoke bacon ... .<ssssss>mmmm .<ssssss>serious smoke come off of this one .<ssssss>unmistakable .<ssssss>hint of sandalwood ?<ssssss>possibly .<ssssss>t - follow the nose .<ssssss>i love this beer .<ssssss>the toast and roasted malt provide a solid body behind the smoky flavor .<ssssss>a sweetness be note , and be a nice contrast to the smoke .<ssssss>but that be what this beer be all about , and i loooove it .<ssssss>m - rich , smoky , wonderful .<ssssss>this beer be a delight .<ssssss>d - moderately high .<ssssss>the smoke can get to you , but for I , i f ` ing love this beer .<ssssss>in my opinion , this be a unique , fantastic , and one-of-a-kind beer that be prefect for stretch you concept of what a beer can be .<ssssss>although it be a old-world technique , this beer can hold its own and even teach a thing or two to modern brewer .<ssssss>fan-f ` ing-tastic , my passion for this beer be almost unrivaled .<ssssss>one of the best beer i have ever have .<ssssss>
9 8 6 8 9		really glad to be able to try this one .<ssssss>thanks for the trade !<ssssss>from note .<ssssss>lebleu pour a stunning reddish plum color with a huge head that have a pinkish hue , leave plenty of lace and excellent retention .<ssssss>nice enough aroma , good brett character .<ssssss>a general dirty earthiness and musty bale of hay .<ssssss>very similar to brute in that regard .<ssssss>some lemon zest and general overripened berry fruitiness .<ssssss>just enough of a sourness to preface the taste .<ssssss>start off with a low granny smith apple-like tart bite ... some general fruitiness but not distinctly blueberry .<ssssss>kind of tame in the sour department , but moderate funk flavor as describe and a well-integrated fruitiness .<ssssss>really not too intense , but it could get there with some time .<ssssss>as the appearance indicate , this beer be just way too carbonate .<ssssss>that be say a lot from I because i think that some of the american sour beer suffer from too low of a carbonation .<ssssss>this be just over-carbonated ... it get better with some swirl and knock a bit of it out .<ssssss>very drinkable and overall another winner from ithaca .<ssssss>can not wait to see what they come up with next from they barrel program .<ssssss>
4 5 2 4 4		pale gold , lot of upcharge bubble , but not enough to replenish the skeletal macro head that sit on top .<ssssss>lace be simple , some string on one side of the glass .<ssssss>slightly sweet aroma , sweet grass , light citrus .<ssssss>mouthfeel be overcarbonate and not happen in any real body .<ssssss>flavor start totally mediocre , a bit of lemon and really bland brown sugar and be then defeat by the overly charge texture .<ssssss>hop be leave behind as the citrus fade into a sucrose-like sweetness and a bit of water .<ssssss>nothing be jarring or horribly nasty about this brew , nothing be there to help build a foundation of a memorable beer either .<ssssss>reasonably refreshing .<ssssss>
10 6 5 7 8		on tap at the purple onion , saluda , nc .<ssssss>pilsner ?<ssssss>really ?<ssssss>it certainly look like a pilsner in the glass , but beyond that , i would not even peg it for a lager , let alone a pilsener .<ssssss>to I it be much more reminiscent of a ipa or a apa .<ssssss>that be say , it be a great beer in its own right .<ssssss>the palate be somewhat thin and sulfurish , and the nose somewhat sweet , but i would gladly have more .<ssssss>nice session beer if they have it on tap .<ssssss>i doubt i would buy a 6-pack , though .<ssssss>when i want a american-made pilsenser , i think i will stick to trumer .<ssssss>

9 10 9 8 9		the one , and only 5 i have ever give out be for the smell of this beer !<ssssss>it be golden and pale , and rich in color , the head meet the top of the pint , and do not rush away the smell be perhaps the best smell on a beer i have ever have !<ssssss>the hop meet the smell of freshness and make you lip stretch into a smile before you have even taste the beer !<ssssss>the taste be most pleasant and fill you mouth .<ssssss>it be refreshing and flavorful .<ssssss>it be one of the best ipa on the market .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be good .<ssssss>it be consistent through out the beer , and even the last swallow be enjoyable the drink ability of this beer be outstanding !<ssssss>it can be enjoy with food or by its self ; even after mow the yard this beer be great !<ssssss>
8 8 6 9 9		after read about this one in the brewing news national ipa competition , i be pleasantly surprise to discover it reside on the shelf near I .<ssssss>after snarf a six-pack , the first bottle flow into a humble pint glass , and a firm , off-white head rise above the orange-toned amber ale , leave a sticky lace call card .<ssssss>the usual suspect of citrus and pine be loiter among a sweet and floral bunch of hooligan .<ssssss>the bitterness of this beer flash across the tongue , but be not over the top as be often find with this style .<ssssss>the refreshing and complex interplay of citrus and pine oils upsurge and climax with the sweet perfume of tropical flower .<ssssss>this ipa truly showcase the complexity celebrate by this style .<ssssss>a palate-cleansing elixir certainly betray some alcohol and carbonation .<ssssss>occasionally , as with this beer , reality support the hype .<ssssss>take this six-pack , with a few close friend and watch the sun settle down below the horizon in hope of spot that elusive green flash .<ssssss>
9 6 8 8 8		pour a a cloudy translucent orange-brown colour with a light tan head that disappear quickly .<ssssss>the colour be absolutely beautiful .<ssssss>i be wary of such beer , but the taste do not disappoint .<ssssss>the smell be citrusy .<ssssss>it really do not have much smell at all .<ssssss>the taste be quite pleasant as well .<ssssss>it have a little more hop than i would like , but i would expect that in a maibock .<ssssss>not nearly as disgusting as sierra nevada 's take on this style with they glissade beer .<ssssss>the taste be pleasantly sweet with a strong citrusy hop overtone .<ssssss>for a hoppy beer , it be really very easy to drink .<ssssss>i do not taste any malt undertone , but i can clearly see that malt be not skimp on , so maybe i be congest or maybe the citrusy hop just overpower everything else .<ssssss>
9 9 7 9 5		pour from a bottle into a clean beer mug .<ssssss>super thick , foamy tan head , with lot of lacing .<ssssss>the color be similar to motor oil that 10,000 mile overdue for a change .<ssssss>nice malty nose .<ssssss>wonderful , almost harsh bitterness -lrb- the way i like it -rrb- .<ssssss>a little too much carbonation .<ssssss>good for a drink or two , but hard to keep drinking .<ssssss>
9 9 6 8 8		pour a fantastic deep dark brown , near black , with fantastic beige head and some very nice lacing .<ssssss>huge deep scent , with roasted grain , a nice coffee tone , and a large sugary , creamy sweetness .<ssssss>good flavor , with excellent roasted grain and a huge creaminess ; very little detectable hop , which be fine ; perhaps just a bit too much on the creamy , sugary side .<ssssss>a little rough , go down , but not too bad ; it just would not be a all-the-time beer because of this .<ssssss>
8 10 9 7 6		750ml .<ssssss>bottle , corked and caged .<ssssss>this tarnish copper color brew cap itself with a medium -lrb- finger and a half -rrb- size head .<ssssss>wow , the smell be evident at least 18-inch from the nose .<ssssss>and what a smell !<ssssss>banana foster hit the nail on the head -lrb- if you be familiar with that dessert -rrb- .<ssssss>taste : again banana , thick sugar , and mild spice present themselves immediately to the tongue .<ssssss>if it end there i would be happy , but i keep pick up a annoyingly bitter finish that keep I from give this beer as high of rating as i would like to .<ssssss>still , at $ 5 a bottle , i will be back .<ssssss>
7 8 7 5 6		happy to see the ba version on shelf in ma .<ssssss>i try the regular , let 's give this one a go .<ssssss>22oz bottle ... a : a dark brown beer with some light highlight shine through around the edge .<ssssss>a small 1/4 inch mocha color head that fase quickly to small bubble atop the brew .<ssssss>decent .<ssssss>s : i get some vanilla and molasses upfront follow by some chocolate and cinnamon note .<ssssss>finish with a blended of roastiness and alcohol .<ssssss>good .<ssssss>t : you get a huge alcohol burst upfront quickly follow by a alcohol burn .<ssssss>this be subtly blended with a watery roastiness .<ssssss>towards the end you get a blend of alcohol , vanilla , and mild chocolate .<ssssss>the alcohol actually seem very prominent throughout the entire experience .<ssssss>it almost taste like rum from the woody oak .<ssssss>over-oaked imo .<ssssss>all other flavor be subtle .<ssssss>hope for more .<ssssss>meh .<ssssss>m : medium body with a good carbonation .<ssssss>a boozy burn finish .<ssssss>decent .<ssssss>o : all in all , this be a ok beer .<ssssss>the non ba version be much better , which more often than not , be not the case .<ssssss>this version be all alcohol and oak , and not much else .<ssssss>it really remind I of a rum .<ssssss>good thing i like rum , so this one will not be a drain pour , but other may think otherwise .<ssssss>i would say , do not waste you $ $ on this one .<ssssss>

7 7 5 7 7		month four in my three floyd beer-a-month venture , and its the perfect day for this one : munsterfest .<ssssss>the change leaf and slight chill on the breeze just scream oktoberfest , and im more than ready .<ssssss>prost !<ssssss>a : wonderfully clear burnt-orange color ; a swell tribute to the german style .<ssssss>the head be just barely off-white , though i dont get to see it for long about a second of solid cream and its down to a fizz .<ssssss>lacing decent , but nothing besides the color really stick out .<ssssss>s : i like these malt : bready caramel on one end , and grainy import on the other .<ssssss>admittedly , the sweet creaminess be the bigger player , but that german lager smell be unmistakable .<ssssss>it finish with nutty , spicy touch , mostly of honey , coriander , and hazelnut .<ssssss>a good and bready nose , though the grain can be more skunky than crisp at time .<ssssss>t : nice and smooth , there a nutty creaminess that set over the whole palate .<ssssss>decent malt , but nothing that be really superb .<ssssss>the grainy kick be never lose , though , and it show as a fruity wheat taste .<ssssss>it lose its luster after half the bottle come off skunky now .<ssssss>no hop be evident , which be sad , because fff do the bitter thing so well .<ssssss>strange metallic tinge on the end , too .<ssssss>it doesnt dominate the aftertaste , though that reserve for a lemony skunk .<ssssss>im lose interest in this , and fast .<ssssss>m : pretty watery .<ssssss>i know a oktoberfest be suppose to be drinkable , but this be just thin .<ssssss>beef it up , fff !<ssssss>o : my least favorite three floyd beer so far .<ssssss>the skunkiness wasnt enough to totally put I off , but the thin palate and even thinner body make this a beer im not plan on go back to .<ssssss>oh well , i cant stay mad at three floyd for that long broo doo will be here in a week !<ssssss>
5 6 7 4 8		grab a bottle on impulse at the back end of a trip to boston , pour into a tulip the beer do not look so bad , but nothing that stand out .<ssssss>dirty greyish amber , not quite muddy .<ssssss>barely one finger of dirty head o_o ... .<ssssss>one wiff tell the whole story , not layer at all .<ssssss>smell like the most basic of belgian scent , not a trace of anything worth investigate .<ssssss>grassy brett without the funk , and thin at that .<ssssss>very shallow and thin .<ssssss>grassy , subtle brett follow by a hollow hoppy rear end .<ssssss>taste like someone drink a oerbier reserva then pee in my corona .<ssssss>thin , light carbanation .<ssssss>perfectly drinkable , if you can find something you like about it .<ssssss>it be not a disgusting beer by any means , it do not induce vomiting or cringing .<ssssss>it be just poorly think out and not very good .<ssssss>i finish half a glass and have no inclination to continue .<ssssss>read some other , much earlier review i have to wonder if they have change the recipe , or if these have be site around in less than ideal condition as i find none of what the early review mention .<ssssss>i could barely make out any malt at all let alone a sturdy backbone .<ssssss>
8 9 2 5 4		12oz bottle app : frothy tan head cap a ruby beer with darker hue of brown .<ssssss>smell : great doppelbock smell .<ssssss>some dark fruit , the slightly sour german dark malt , caramel , and a touch of alcoholic sweetness around the edge .<ssssss>taste : quite bitter at first .<ssssss>bite roasted flavor pair with bitter hop to create a aggressive flavor .<ssssss>lack the sweetness find in the nose , and it seem like all the sugar be fermented , thus give it strength and no body .<ssssss>finish , however , rather appropriately with bitterness and flavor impart by the roasted malt and the herbal hop , a finish that want I to drink more of this lack brew .<ssssss>a seemingly medium body that quickly turn watery in the finish .<ssssss>perhaps a old bottle .<ssssss>will re-review when possible .<ssssss>
6 4 8 8 8		i have a pint of this after a dissapointing pale ale .<ssssss>i be not hopeful at first when i get the pint with a minimal head that dissapear after 30 seconds .<ssssss>again , the nose be off - like a damp wet sock - no burst of rich spice or herbal hop .<ssssss>i forge on though to get past those shorfall and realy enjoy the beer .<ssssss>it have a earthy , woodsy flavor up front with taste of nutmeg and pepper .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be rich and border on syrupy in a nice way without any syrupy sweetness .<ssssss>the initial spiced flavor fade away into a warm chocolate flavor that last a long while and be nicely balance with a very mild dry hop taste .<ssssss>it be a good finish that make I want to wait to have another drink to go through the whole taste spectrum again .<ssssss>too bad about the nose , or this beer would be worth a short trip to new haven to enjoy the kringle nitecap<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 8		review from bottle : a - the beer pour a amber color with a huge head which leave good lace .<ssssss>s - the aroma hint of chocolate , spice , and hop -lrb- cascade ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>t - the flavor be somewhat sweet with a good balance of hop .<ssssss>m - a little bite on the palate but finish clean , medium-bodied .<ssssss>d - recommend for the style .<ssssss>
7 8 9 7 8		enjoy this at my in law .<ssssss>it be part of a heineken holiday pack .<ssssss>never hear of this brew before .<ssssss>pour out of a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass .<ssssss>a -rrb- this be a dark amber .<ssssss>a fairly aggressive pour yield roughly a finger of off white head .<ssssss>the head dissipate rather quickly , leave behind just a collar of foam .<ssssss>no lacing note .<ssssss>s -rrb- big malty sweetness , and really not much else .<ssssss>the sweet aroma definitely dominate the nose on this one .<ssssss>i have to say , that i find it appealing .<ssssss>t -rrb- it be as sweet as the nose lead I to believe it might be .<ssssss>sweet roasted malt , caramel , a little bit of like a nutty coffee blend .<ssssss>i pick up a bit of booze on the backend .<ssssss>the aroma be one thing , but this be just a tick too sweet for I .<ssssss>pretty good though ... m -rrb- this be pretty full body , and it do not have much carbonation , which suit this beer quite well .<ssssss>it be very smooth , and despite the fact it be just a little to sweet for my taste , i find it very easy to drink .<ssssss>the finish and aftertaste be very satisfying .<ssssss>o -rrb- this be a nice after dinner sipper for sure .<ssssss>likely the highlight of the holiday pack from heineken .<ssssss>i would recommend give this beer a try .<ssssss>
9 6 8 9 9		appearance : pour a brownish/orange color w / a good head and good retention .<ssssss>be really pretty smell : floral hoppy smell very faint mouthfeel : a nice thin beer that be design to be drink in large quantity taste : this beer hit the spot the best octo beer ive have sweet malt w / a slight hint of hop drinkability : this beer go down smooth and if it be not for the price and the 6 % alc one could drink these all night or all day .<ssssss>
8 4 6 5 7		i be sure i will come back and revisit this beer down the road a bit .<ssssss>it be the new brewery 's first batch so to be fair i will come back to see if they tweek the beer down the road .<ssssss>the beer be suppose to to be unfiltered but be clear with no yeast .<ssssss>color be golden .<ssssss>this be a english style pale ale so no hop be anywhere to be find .<ssssss>body be light .<ssssss>some malt but this beer really do not turn I on too much .<ssssss>someone say they think it be more like a english bitter than a pale ale although i be far from a expert on the difference between the two .<ssssss>meet the owner at a promo .<ssssss>nice enough guy .<ssssss>they say the other owner be one of the founder of pyramid .<ssssss>
7 7 7 9 8		here be the quiz question ... which be the best belgian strong pale ale -lrb- from belgium -rrb- : a -rrb- duvel b -rrb- delirium tremen c -rrb- la chouffe i will focus on what make la chouffe different .<ssssss>it be a couple of thing .<ssssss>less carbonation that duvel .<ssssss>smoother than delirium tremen .<ssssss>a spicy taste -lrb- but not `` dry '' like duvel -rrb- .<ssssss>i think the complexity of la chouffe put it head above the other .<ssssss>remember -- duvel be a filtered beer .<ssssss>with la chouffe , the hop taste be almost a aftertaste .<ssssss>there be a real underlie apple/citrus flavor here .<ssssss>so there be a expansiveness with unique flavor ... that be what bring I come back to this beer .<ssssss>
8 6 4 7 7		birra decicco be dark brown .<ssssss>aroma be a smokey chestnut and rich malt .<ssssss>taste be slightly tart -lrb- weird -rrb- and nutty with a smokey finish .<ssssss>mouth feel be fairly thin , probably due to the honey .<ssssss>bready yeast character and moderate carbonation .<ssssss>really strange taste with a malty finish .<ssssss>the addition of jam be random .<ssssss>not really sure what kind it be but it may have contribute to its tartness .<ssssss>there be a lot go on with this beer to begin with .<ssssss>
7 4 6 6 4		rich gold color , thick white head .<ssssss>grainy taste with medium bitterness and restrained astringency .<ssssss>this be a decent beer , far more respectable than bud or coor , because it do have some character -lrb- be as restrained as it be -rrb- , but like most lager , this beer be devoid anything really special .<ssssss>it be boring .<ssssss>
7 5 8 8 8		06/17/09 - purcahse at k & l wine cellar in redwood city , can .<ssssss>presentation - 22oz bottle , 2009 release .<ssssss>pour into a random pint glass .<ssssss>appearance - semi-murky dirty orange color pour .<ssssss>not really much of a head , maybe 1/4 inch which quickly receed .<ssssss>leave some light lace markin behind .<ssssss>smell - have a very odd body odor scent .<ssssss>hard to describe .<ssssss>stinky be the best work i can use .<ssssss>it do have a more sugary malty base with a good amount of hop , but the stink kinda of superceed those scent .<ssssss>taste - flavorful , well balanced , maybe even a bit more on the malty side .<ssssss>a bit sugary with a pine hoppy flavor .<ssssss>nice toast and sweet malt backing .<ssssss>mouthfeel - lower carbonation level .<ssssss>would have like a bit more .<ssssss>leave a nice thicker hoppy flavor behind in the aftertaste .<ssssss>drinkability - good beer .<ssssss>but not up to they 2nd anniversary which i really love .<ssssss>
9 7 8 6 8		i love witbier , but this be my first time have a doublt wit .<ssssss>on tap at cbh , it come in a tall bud light pint with a orange on the rim .<ssssss>that be weird ... they do not even sell bud light here .<ssssss>i take the orange out , and i be leave with a very impressive look beer .<ssssss>it be golden in color with a complete haze .<ssssss>the head be about two finger and have really good retention and lacing .<ssssss>the aroma be strong and intense and smell like orange .<ssssss>as it warm , the yeast be able to express itself more , but it never quite overcome the strong use of orange .<ssssss>the wheat and yeast contribute a slight bubblegum aroma behind the orange , with a slight perfume note .<ssssss>this beer be really full and juicy but it have a bit too much orange peel in it for my taste .<ssssss>i prefer more of a crisp wheat and yeasty character with spice keep to a minimum .<ssssss>the taste be similar to a wit but with a lot more fullness and sweetness .<ssssss>the orange be back , and be again a bit too strong .<ssssss>some slight tartness be find on the finish , add a little bit of refreshment to this big beer .<ssssss>no alcohol be detect .<ssssss>think `` imperial shocktop '' and you will get the idea .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be the part that stand out the most about this beer .<ssssss>i really love the full and creamy feeling of a wit , and this be just on another level .<ssssss>it be get a really big body with a smooth feeling .<ssssss>the finish be not as dry as a regular strength version , but it still have some crisp wheat character .<ssssss>this be easy to drink , but i would get something else instead of come back .<ssssss>if i be to have this beer again , it would be with a dessert that could work with the orange flavor .<ssssss>
6 8 6 5 6		strike I as a strange mix between a abbey ale and a blue moon -- -- huh maybe thats cause it be !<ssssss>crazy stuff .<ssssss>ok , ok it be not a trappist brew , and it would shudder in the presence of a westmalle or a rochefort , but it kick the hell out of blue moon , that be say , there be much better way to spend you hard earn cash .<ssssss>
4 4 3 3 6		appearance : very pale yellow with white foam head .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>smell : very faint smell , but could some fruity hint .<ssssss>taste : virtually none .<ssssss>very water down in flavor .<ssssss>mouthfeel : very thin , no body whatsoever .<ssssss>drinkabilty : very easy to drink but so be water .<ssssss>the only value i could see for this beer be perhaps on real hot day it would be thirst quenching .<ssssss>
9 10 8 8 9		a : pale straw colour with fine head , which collapse but the carbonation keep a permanent head .<ssssss>s : wow - all about the saaz aroma , though the malt do manage to make a appearance underneath .<ssssss>t : way up at the hoppy end .<ssssss>the malt/bittering hop flavour be well balanced but the flavour of the hop themselves dominate in the taste .<ssssss>there be a long hop bitterness in the aftertaste .<ssssss>m : a little over carbonate for my taste but smooth .<ssssss>d : very refreshing , i could drink it all night .<ssssss>i be not surprise this be hold up as the one to match in the pilsner world .<ssssss>i be no great fan of any lighter lager , but this be a wonderful combination of flavour to match any ale .<ssssss>
8 6 4 5 5		pour easily with a almost three-finger thick , pale , just barely tan , off-white colored head .<ssssss>the beer be a murky gold color that show a only lightly haze , bright , pale gold color when hold up to the light .<ssssss>the aroma be noticeable spicy as i pour this , though it seem to be a bit more grassy / hay like with grain note upon deeper inspection .<ssssss>this be definitely interesting smell , spicy & grain-like , but somehow in a stale grain sort of way .<ssssss>it almost have a savory herbal note to it , somewhat earthy and definitely reminiscent of funky whole grain note .<ssssss>i be not sure i really dig the aroma of this beer , but i would not say i dislike it either .<ssssss>spicy and a bit peppery from a decent carbonation .<ssssss>the beer be very thin body , so much so that it almost seem to develop a tartness .<ssssss>this finish with a light bitterness and graininess that be both grassy as well as a bit like stale cracker .<ssssss>other flavor of earthy herb , perhaps a touch of dm and some green apple like flavor -lrb- especially towards the finish -rrb- .<ssssss>there be not a whole lot of complexity to this beer and for some reason even the flavor i have mention have bee hard to pull out .<ssssss>really not a very good beer , it might be a bit past its prime , but many of the flavor do not really seem attributable to oxidation ; a bottle date would have be really nice as i just buy this .<ssssss>this really just seem poorly construct .<ssssss>purchase : plaza liquor , tucson az<ssssss>
5 7 5 5 4		rather bland apple juice beer , carbonation , not much in appearance other than hazy apple juice .<ssssss>medium to light mouthfeel .<ssssss>could have a couple of gulp , but otherwise not finishable .<ssssss>a geuze experiment .<ssssss>we think it be infect as it pour over , but that be the sugar write up as champagne .<ssssss>
7 8 7 8 5		pour a golden wheat yellow color with a frothy white head .<ssssss>decent retention .<ssssss>smell be earthy then strong citrusy , lemon and very bitter peach .<ssssss>taste be similar , light wheat then move to strong citrusy taste , almost like bite into a lemon .<ssssss>not a particularly balanced beer imo , not bad but not my style .<ssssss>
8 8 7 10 8		there be a time when k9 say : `` when in doubt go flat out '' , but that be before the trouble in new york back in 2001 .<ssssss>this version from maryland be a incredible delicious ale , where malt sweetness combine with a crunchy biscuit flavor note in the finish .<ssssss>this be even better than i remember of the first version i sample from colorado .<ssssss>
9 8 9 7 9		creamy , ultra dense light tan head leave intricate belgian lace .<ssssss>smooth roasted barley coffee , chocolate & hint of buttery diacetyl in aroma .<ssssss>roasted barley & hop bitterness hit the palette upfront , follow by mellow caramel sweetness & chocolate malt .<ssssss>tremendously rich & creamy mouthfeel from the nitrogenation couple with the full , dextrinous body .<ssssss>finish surprisingly dry and abruptly bittersweet .<ssssss>a very tasty stout , although the nitrogenation seem to have diminish some of the roasted note .<ssssss>
6 4 8 7 7		on tap pour into a sampling glass .<ssssss>pour a very clear amber with a small white head with lot of what lacing .<ssssss>nose be tame without much go for it .<ssssss>taste be well balanced , malty with a light hop bite but not over he top , fairly earthy with a smooth finish .<ssssss>carbonation be light .<ssssss>
4 2 2 5 3		appearance : nothing impressive ; slight head and lacing smell : almost no bouquet at all ; faint scent of floral hop taste : watery and weak front end ; honestly remind I of a pathetic american lager ; finish be a strong bitter hop -lrb- grapefruit and citrus -rrb- which constitute the only redeeming quality of this brew .<ssssss>mouthfeel : thin and disappointing ; the front end be so weak it make I cringe ; carbonation be nonexistent ; very little in this brew leave a mark on the palate drinkability : very poor ; while the hop finish be quite nice , the lack of body and presence on the entry be simply unforgivable .<ssssss>perhaps something be wrong with the tap at the pub , but if not , a seriously imbalanced drink .<ssssss>
6 4 4 6 6		i have only have this straight from the bottle , so i can not speak to it be head retention or glassware appearance .<ssssss>s - some faint hoppiness , not very pronounced .<ssssss>t - some citrus note and honey , very subdue sweetness , slightly bitter aftertaste from the hop , fairly well-balanced .<ssssss>m - thicker than a lighter lager , very lightly carbonate .<ssssss>d - this go down well cold .<ssssss>the colder the better .<ssssss>as it near room temerature it be drinkability suffer , i blame that on it be lack of carbonation .<ssssss>this be the only bock style beer i have have so it may just be a aspect of the style that i be simply not acquire to .<ssssss>
8 6 7 9 8		not available here in wichita .<ssssss>appearance : this beer be a very hazy , amber-orange color .<ssssss>the foam erupt as soon as the liquid hit the bottom of the snifter and rise up to fill the majority of the glass .<ssssss>it be coarse and as it settle , become fluffy and web like .<ssssss>the bubble cling tightly to the glass .<ssssss>thick ring of lace be leave behind in this brew 's wake .<ssssss>smell : a very strong smell of sickly sweet , almost rotten , fruit right after the pour .<ssssss>this calm down somewhat after awhile , but still remain the main component of the aroma .<ssssss>huge amount of raisin and date combine with honey and molassess .<ssssss>it be almost like the smell be ooze thickly up my nose .<ssssss>light amount of alcohol and citrus hop in the background ... way in the background .<ssssss>mouthfeel : kind of thin for a barley wine , though it be a little buttery on the tip of the tongue .<ssssss>the high carbonation level make it a little rough .<ssssss>taste : i be afraid the sweetness be go to be way overbearing due to what i detect in the aroma .<ssssss>while there be quite a bit of sweetness in the flavor , it be definitely not cloying , and it need to be there to balance out the huge hop presence .<ssssss>upfront be a strong caramel sweetness and a medicinal -lrb- almost like cherry cough syrup -rrb- flavor .<ssssss>in the middle be some light diacetyl that immediately get its ass kick by a strong hop bitterness that punch through it and all the other flavor .<ssssss>the herbal hop linger into the finish and well beyond into the aftertaste , where it seem to get stronger .<ssssss>there be a reprise of caramel in the aftertaste as well , but this beer still finish on the dry side .<ssssss>a really good beer , though the aroma be off-putting .<ssssss>i be surprised that the hop flavor be still that strong after two to three year .<ssssss>i bet this beer be a punch in the face when it be fresh .<ssssss>thanks , rob !<ssssss>
10 6 8 9 8		love this bright orange can ... a : pour a dark amber color with a off white , cream color head .<ssssss>look fantastic .<ssssss>good retention and lace all over the glass .<ssssss>s : sweet , caramel malt with hint of toffee and just a light , faint , hop smell .<ssssss>t : sweet , toast malt follow by caramel and slight hop bitterness in the back end which do a good job of balance the sweetness .<ssssss>m : very smooth , creamy .<ssssss>low to medium carbonation .<ssssss>very easy drinking , not much of a aftertaste .<ssssss>o : narragansett keep be simple here .<ssssss>a smooth , easy drinking fest lager .<ssssss>another solid seasonal from these guy .<ssssss>also come in tall boy and that be always a good thing .<ssssss>
8 8 7 9 7		pale peach/copper color with chunky off white head .<ssssss>fruity hop aroma .<ssssss>nose be juicy and smooth , with pink grapefruit hop flavor .<ssssss>hop be strong , but not bitter , in fact its surpsisingly mild and smooth , but full flavored .<ssssss>hint of tropical fruit along with the juicy citrus , then a faint pale malt sweetness before the semi dry finish .<ssssss>much less malt than many double ipa , which put the hop on center stage and make it interesting because the hop change as it warm .<ssssss>relatively low in bitterness for the amount of hop presence .<ssssss>a interesting beer and fairly drinkable , but not something i would have regularly .<ssssss>i remember have this on cask at the horse brass , and it be much tastier than in the bottle , but this review be for the 22 bottle .<ssssss>
7 4 7 4 5		pour into a perfect pint .<ssssss>3.5 a : clear orange amber color .<ssssss>a little over one finger of white , fairly dense froth .<ssssss>retention be average and a small ring of lacing be leave .<ssssss>2.0 s : mainly dusty and a little metalllic .<ssssss>a sickly fruitiness , earthy hop , and some caramel .<ssssss>2.0 t : it taste almost as bad as it smell .<ssssss>strange combo of caramel , metal , graininess , and earthy hop .<ssssss>lightly toasty .<ssssss>3.5 m : light body .<ssssss>though i wish the body be thicker , i can not complain about the creaminess it offer .<ssssss>good moderate carbonation .<ssssss>best aspect of the brew , easily .<ssssss>2.5 d : this be a not-quite-mediocre brew .<ssssss>i will pass on it from now on .<ssssss>
5 6 9 7 9		pour out a pretty clear pale golden color , no real head on it .<ssssss>the smell be , as to be expect , malt , a bit on the sweet side .<ssssss>taste be malt -lrb- duh -rrb- and not much else .<ssssss>maybe a touch of hop at the end to give it a little snap .<ssssss>light , smooth , well carbonated , do not hang around in the mouth or on the palate .<ssssss>overall , a refreshing lighter beer that be a fine example of its style , and if you do not like the style , do not drink it .<ssssss>and do not review it against non all-malt lager .<ssssss>for what it be , it be pretty decent .<ssssss>
7 7 4 6 5		a decent beer , but certianly not a great beer .<ssssss>serve from a 65cl bottle into a standard pint glass .<ssssss>this brew have a nice colour , copper , but the head be very thin and do not last atol .<ssssss>lacing be find throughout consumption , but be very little .<ssssss>the head be a off-white , but not cream .<ssssss>smell be hoppy , and yet not distinct .<ssssss>burnt malt aroma and woodsy note .<ssssss>it have a very hoppy flavour , with note of caramel and ash tree .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very thin , almost watery .<ssssss>this be uncharacteristic , since most bitters should be fairly thick .<ssssss>hence why this beer have a tonne of hop , and yet no body .<ssssss>one bottle , a dn that be it !<ssssss>that be pretty much all i could or want to drink in a week .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 8		presentation : 12 oz brown long-neck bottle with no freshness date though on the neck be the year 2001 .<ssssss>blurb about the beer on the back label .<ssssss>appearance : bright reddish amber hue , light tan head be fluffy and dissipate into a pasty big bubbled lace .<ssssss>smell : fresh dip caramel apple come to mind , lot of malt sweetness in the nose with hint of fruit and a mild hop .<ssssss>taste : full and chewy in the mouth with a vague hoppy juicy fruit and sweet dark bread maltiness capture the taste bud attention .<ssssss>both toast and roasted flavour flex within the bold caramel taste .<ssssss>mildly estery and warm to the body .<ssssss>tight and clean bite of hop bitterness cut through some of the malt leave a spicy trail of flavour into the finish of residual sweetness .<ssssss>note : top shelf for american winter brew , balanced for a muscular brew and a must buy for winter seasonal .<ssssss>6.9 % abv .<ssssss>

8 5 8 8 9		i have to say , i be a huge sam fan , so this review may be a little jaded .<ssssss>however , this be one of thier finest brew out there .<ssssss>the imperial series be always worth a look , but this happen to be one of the better of the three .<ssssss>my only complaint be the smell .<ssssss>it be not offensive , but it do not make someone yearn for this brew like it should .<ssssss>
4 6 9 10 10		grain belt premium be purchase by new ulm , minnesota schell brewery a couple year ago now , and gbp diehard have , i think , collectively give the lager a thumb up .<ssssss>i would certainly agree that schell have do a very good job reestablish this minnesota summertime staple .<ssssss>still dress in its extraordinarily understate blue-collar , red and white label , grain belt premium be a gem often overlook by the uninitiated .<ssssss>color : bright , yellow lager .<ssssss>nose : fruit .<ssssss>berry with honey .<ssssss>the faintest hoppy tingle .<ssssss>palate : medium-light body , sweet but not cloying in the slightest .<ssssss>hop be at a minimum .<ssssss>despite this the lager be very balanced .<ssssss>straightforward , thus not complex , yet enough flavor to invite another sip .<ssssss>finish : rewarding .<ssssss>middling in length .<ssssss>enough hop to simply end the experience snappily .<ssssss>the bottom line : though one might discount my enthusiasm for this lager due to my be a minnesotan , that would be rash .<ssssss>fan of we bottom ferment friend have to give this beer a try if you make you way to a lakeside minnesota vacation .<ssssss>a great summer lager .<ssssss>a midwest open secret .<ssssss>

4 3 5 6 8		ive have more mgd than any other beer .<ssssss>pale color with plenty of carbonation , thin white head , clean smell and taste no real after taste .<ssssss>nothing stand out as good or bad .<ssssss>the price be right and im sure it will I in my fridge most day .<ssssss>its most welcome on a hot day .<ssssss>

7 4 6 6 5		a : nice fat finger width of fluffy head form from a healthy pour , some lacing be evident as the head dissipate .<ssssss>the beer be too amber and too clear for a wheat beer , but some of the color be likely due to the cherry .<ssssss>s : this be not the first time i have have this beer , but it be the first time i have really notice it .<ssssss>the aroma just be not pleasant .<ssssss>the cherry be too strong which give the aroma a distinct medicinal note .<ssssss>t : decent sourness , not sure if it come from the cherry or the wheat malt .<ssssss>again , the aroma be overpoweringly medicinal , and this bleed over into the taste .<ssssss>could be better with more subdue cherry note .<ssssss>m : crisp , like a wheat beer should be , but the cherry cough syrup note detract in this area as well .<ssssss>d : as i say before , this be not the first time i have have this one ... but it might be the last .<ssssss>i could see this beer as a ingredient in sauce for meat dish though !<ssssss>

4 7 8 6 7		like other have say , this be not go to win any beauty contest .<ssssss>no head and no lacing , and look like a cross between cola and a brown ale , and possibly dark diarrhea .<ssssss>unfortunately it also lack in most area , although there be some improvement compare to the appearance .<ssssss>smell boozy , with brown sugar and prune .<ssssss>taste be very malty , with the same characteristic i be get in the smell .<ssssss>also toffee and some peppery spice .<ssssss>mouthfeel be appropriate for the style .<ssssss>a little syrupy , with a acceptable amount of carbonation .<ssssss>despite the negativity , the drinkability actually do not suffer that much .<ssssss>it be a decent sipper and a obviously unique barleywine .<ssssss>
8 4 6 7 7		ingredient : malt , hopp , sugar , flavoring .<ssssss>alcohol : 5.1 % rich orange color .<ssssss>fine head .<ssssss>a beer lack flavor or character .<ssssss>perhaps it be because this beer be store at room tempurature , its flavor profile be weakend .<ssssss>where be the bitterness or hoppiness characteristic in a pale ale , i do not know .<ssssss>drink jan. 02 , 2003 exp .<ssssss>sept. 2003 review edit : aug. 29 2003 although i do not know what the hell anyone be do put sugar and flavoring in a pale ale for , this beer have a mild attractive malt flavor .<ssssss>my previous rating put it 2.8 , would put this beer at `` belw average '' but compare to all the other crap at the `` hip bar '' , this be the best you can get , and so clearly be not below average .<ssssss>with ab crap take such a large share of worldwide production volume , bud would have to be average -lrb- and thus get straight three -rrb- , in this context bass pale ale would be a 4 .<ssssss>

9 10 7 8 10		i be break the rule a bit here with a review well past the best before date -lrb- note on the bottle to be august 2010 , and it be now march 2011 - always disappointing when you buy something well past it be best before -rrb- .<ssssss>i be think that if anything should be able to age -lrb- beyond a barleywine -rrb- something this dark and powerful should have a shot .<ssssss>it be pretty impressive , so i be review anyway !<ssssss>a - deep black with little accumulate head , but lot of big bubble that resolve after a few minute .<ssssss>little tiny point of lace on the glass .<ssssss>s - stunningly familiar -lrb- to a islay scotch fan -rrb- - pure peat and iodine so like many of the classic islay malt .<ssssss>some element of dark fruit as well , but really lot and lot of peat !<ssssss>t - lot of peat and smoke up front resolve into some dry fruit and almost sweet malt .<ssssss>a interesting paradox -lrb- ha ha -rrb- .<ssssss>the finish also have some really earthy tone the appear well after a sip .<ssssss>m - very light ; in a sense too light for the flavor .<ssssss>i really expect something with more body to complement to powerful flavor .<ssssss>it be not bad , but it do not seem quite right .<ssssss>d - truly shocking drinkability ; it be list as 10 % but there be just the smallest hint of warmth .<ssssss>it be a spellbinding drink that get more and more interesting .<ssssss>very happy to have try this , albeit a little late in its lifespan ; regardless , it be pretty special .<ssssss>

5 8 10 8 8		appearance ding for the bottle .<ssssss>sure , it be cool to have the wax , and all , but , here be some constructive criticism - how about have a string underneath the wax that you can pull on to get the wax off -lrb- by cut it in half , eh ? -rrb-<ssssss>quickly and easily ?<ssssss>light amber , medium height , dark cream head that leave rather quickly but with a completely cover and very lasting lace .<ssssss>smell like light caramelly , earthy malt .<ssssss>yum !<ssssss>ah , the smell be right on .<ssssss>light caramel , heavy malt , gently sweet , earthy tone .<ssssss>tiny bit of spice in there ... maybe hint of raisiny alchool .<ssssss>big plus : i be so glad that this do not have a strong cascade hop flavor to it !<ssssss>nice and thick in mouthful -lrb- as well as in flavor ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>hmm .<ssssss>but for the color , i could think that it be along the line of a eku 28 .<ssssss>oddly , this one taste like it have more alcohol -lrb- it have less -rrb- and feel a bit thicker .<ssssss>hmm .<ssssss>maybe i should crack that other eku 28 and compare side by side .<ssssss>nah .<ssssss>but that would be interesting ... if it be easier to get and cost less -lrb- both of those issue be local problem -rrb- i would drink it frequently !<ssssss>

8 10 10 9 8		this be one of those beer that you have to ask yourself , be it all that good , and be all the hype just a little overblown ?<ssssss>you never know until you try , but i pretty much have a idea by the smokestack 's history , it be probably go to be pretty good .<ssssss>then again , there be always a exception to the rule , but let 's hope this one be not it .<ssssss>this one be number 00055/11960 and show the 11 % abv , which i like see , as the bigger boulevard brew always have a good blend on the alcohol .<ssssss>a massive multi-colored , light and dark-tan head explode and rise quickly above the rim of the pint .<ssssss>it be top with a crop of big bubble , and recede at a snail pace , leave stack sheet of slightly broken lace all around .<ssssss>you have to be careful with the pour on the smokestack , i.e .<ssssss>the doublewide , or you be gon na get froth all over the place .<ssssss>no complaint here though .<ssssss>color be pitch-black and opaque , with virtually no lighter shades show when hold to light .<ssssss>aromatically this one be very complex , but that be no surprise .<ssssss>burnt wood , some ubiquitous boulevard brettanomyce -lrb- which seem to show up lately -rrb- , burnt sugar , toast bread , wheat , pine , subtle dark fruit and hop all work in unison to create a perfectly balanced aromatic profile .<ssssss>a smooth , creamy and very slightly viscous mouth-feel make for a medium to full body experience that be actually highly drinkable , but warrant sip due to the well-hidden alcohol content .<ssssss>the palate be fill with dark chocolate , coffee , caramel , furtive candy spice , roasted malt and a good hit of alcohol that work itself into the overall experience well and be not overbearing .<ssssss>in my opinion the hype surround this beer be well-deserved , but you will just have to seek it out and give it a shot yourself .<ssssss>

7 3 7 6 6		hazy gold in color ... very little on the nose except sourness ... the aroma be definitely a major drawback with this beer .<ssssss>.<ssssss>the taste be ok ... not a lot there but drinkable ... i get some sweetness on the bud and definitely not the sourness i get on the nose ... still it really do not have much hefe-weizen taste to it ... on the long finish there be a bit of sourness .<ssssss>.<ssssss>not the worst beer around ... not the best either ... not sure how the rating will turn out but i would say average to slightly below average .<ssssss>.<ssssss>

8 10 8 9 7		sample in my one-of-a-kind ollie 's hybrid wine/pilsner glass from a growler fill at the delmar brewery five hour before .<ssssss>the first thing that one notice be that the brew be strongly carbonate and highly aromatic .<ssssss>i smell the growler all the way home from the brewery , and even though the tapster have pour off quite a bit of foam in fill the growler , it still be quite active in pour at home .<ssssss>the strong foam make the perfume of this beer very dominant even between sip .<ssssss>in this it compete with dogfish head 's burton baton , one of my favorite , and i bet that if one be to decant part of the growler carefully into a champagne bottle , it would age well .<ssssss>the taste , like they lot # 3 ipa , be strongly reminiscent of very good grapefruit juice , with the same astringency .<ssssss>there be other complex `` flowery '' note that come from the hop mixture , which linger pleasantly in the back of the mouth .<ssssss>the brew go down smoothly enough , but , as other reviewer note , the 9 % alcohol content soon call attention to itself , and so it be very much a beer to sip and unwind with at the end of a tiring day , rather than a sessionable beer .<ssssss>the variety , at present , be available only occasionally , at the brewery or occasionally on draft at a tavern specialize in local craft beer .<ssssss>it be more expensive than they other variety , but well worth seek out and try .<ssssss>
5 8 6 4 5		it be a little weak look for a pale ale , it do not have the great copper hue that i look for , and it do not have the dry malt smell interlace with the hop aroma .<ssssss>the head be decent , but then again , a pale ale normally can froth up quite a bit , and it tend to release a great deal of aroma , which i do not see .<ssssss>the taste be pretty lame , it be weakly hop , and it taste like a dry-hopped domestic , which might have a style someday , but currently , it be just a miss at a pale ale .<ssssss>at 5.7 % it be not bad to drink , but the taste be a show stopper<ssssss>
6 7 7 8 6		wow .<ssssss>this beer be not what i be expect .<ssssss>a - pour a pale , straw color that look like water when it be pour out of the bottle .<ssssss>not attractive at all .<ssssss>s - ok smell .<ssssss>lot of malt present .<ssssss>also pick up a hint -lrb- albeit just a trace -rrb- of floral and peach .<ssssss>t - it hit you tastebud like a anvil .<ssssss>very , very sour taste .<ssssss>almost like drink a lemon zest .<ssssss>be from the south , i like my peach flavor overly sweet , this be not what i be expect in this beer .<ssssss>m - bite sensation on the toungue as the sourness of the beer hit .<ssssss>but it do away toward the end of the beer and the beer start sweet up .<ssssss>d - not much drinkability here .<ssssss>it be ok for what it be -lrb- a sour -rrb- , but i would not sit down and drink a sixer of this or anything .<ssssss>
8 7 4 7 6		live review .<ssssss>bottle pour into my duvel tulip .<ssssss>a : pour a dark brown , small tan head settle into a ring and film .<ssssss>leave nice -lrb- but small -rrb- lacing on the glass that stay .<ssssss>s : very deep roast , coffee , toast , wood , ash , chocolate , and smoke .<ssssss>also have some very faint tart note , like several of the stout from jackie o 's .<ssssss>t : deep roasted malt , ash and smoke , a very faint chocolate , even more faint woody hop and tartness , and then near the finish it turn into boozy alcohol .<ssssss>let down here .<ssssss>coffee be not nearly what it should be for a espresso stout .<ssssss>m : even worse , overly thin body , low carbonation , and slick on the palate make the alcohol stand out .<ssssss>o : okay for what it be , but not something i would buy again .<ssssss>sadly , the regular emelisse russian imperial stout be fantastic .<ssssss>if you see anything from emelisse , stick with the russian imperial over this .<ssssss>
9 8 8 10 9		black bodied beer with a tight cap of brown foam .<ssssss>great retention and lacing come abundantly .<ssssss>aroma consist of chocolate , black licorice , cherrywood , char and tobacco .<ssssss>nice aroma , but fairly subtle .<ssssss>the flavor be a real treat .<ssssss>anise oil mix with char wood .<ssssss>black currant mix with burnt malt .<ssssss>chocolate and coffee and caramel all accent nicely .<ssssss>nice depth and complexity .<ssssss>mouthfeel be smooth and about medium-full body .<ssssss>for 11 % , this beer do not show much alcohol in the flavor .<ssssss>quite a feat .<ssssss>damn solid imperial stout .<ssssss>
8 9 7 9 10		i be impress by the flavor because alcohol content be rather high .<ssssss>pour to a golden reddish brown color with a medium size foamy head , that lace the glass .<ssssss>it have a sweet alcoholic aroma with hint of apple , cranberry , maybe a little a little raspberry .<ssssss>there be a definite apple character in the taste which make this amazing .<ssssss>the sweetness cover up the alcohol flavor well .<ssssss>mouth be heavy , coating to the inside of the mouth , and the aftertaste be quite pleasant .<ssssss>it be smooth , and not too carbonate .<ssssss>
8 5 8 5 5		appearance : nice head .<ssssss>plenty of visible carbonation .<ssssss>light lacing .<ssssss>light copper color .<ssssss>very clear .<ssssss>smell : smell just like it taste .<ssssss>malty , sourdough biscuit aroma .<ssssss>taste : malty , sourdough biscuit flavor .<ssssss>bitter but no floral hop .<ssssss>mouthfeel : bitter .<ssssss>nice carbonation .<ssssss>flavor linger .<ssssss>overall : disappointing .<ssssss>where be the floral hop finish ?<ssssss>taste like a imitation of heineken .<ssssss>i have be to germany and taste real pilsener .<ssssss>this be not one of they .<ssssss>that be say , not a bad session beer if you like a bitter lager .<ssssss>
10 8 10 8 10		the pour be a dark crimson border on black with a four finger beige head that very slowly dissapate and leave no lacing on the glass but a thin beige head remain on top of the beer throughout the drink .<ssssss>the smell be heavy in a complex fig and date scent with a slight hint of hop spice in the rear of the nose .<ssssss>the drink start with a kick of fig and complex fruit the middle be more of the same .<ssssss>the finish be heavy and linger yeast and fruit .<ssssss>this be a very good beer that would be a good example of the style .<ssssss>quite drinkable and refreshing .<ssssss>heavy and chewy but not over the top .<ssssss>go after this one , it be worth it .<ssssss>
9 5 6 6 9		a - a cloudy yellow with lot of light fluffy head and visible carbonation .<ssssss>very nice look beer .<ssssss>look tasty .<ssssss>s - not a big nose , slight sweet maltiness with lot of citrus .<ssssss>t - very light and tangy .<ssssss>sweetness of lemon and orange and the slight spiciness of coriander .<ssssss>slightly acidic tasting , but very refreshing and zesty .<ssssss>m - very light and tingly , the citrus make it slightly dry and incredibly refreshing .<ssssss>d - incredibly drinkable .<ssssss>not strong , or complex , but very good and very refreshing .<ssssss>
7 10 4 6 5		2002 vintage .<ssssss>curious corked english style bottle .<ssssss>very little remain carbonation but the cork be sweet smell and there be no leakage around the cork , it look new .<ssssss>this be a well-rested and carefully handle bottle that still pour a murky brown ale with no head .<ssssss>smell be intense !<ssssss>almost bloody you nose intense .<ssssss>my first impression be that i have mistakenly pour napoleon brandy in my glass !<ssssss>amazingly intense fruity aroma even after i know how intense it be on the second sniff .<ssssss>fig , raisin , melon , walnut and pecan be just part of the aroma .<ssssss>i will have to contradict myself think , this really smell much more like the one time i have 40 year old port wine , it be the nut aroma in here that do it .<ssssss>you could write a book about the smell of this beer .<ssssss>taste be nutty and somewhat tart in flavor at the start .<ssssss>the taste be somewhere between the flavor of a flander red and a scotch .<ssssss>no flavor of hop be detectable to I .<ssssss>there be a clear flavor of alcohol here .<ssssss>the flavor be best sum up as tart berry and nut .<ssssss>it be a shame but the flavor do not match the amazing aroma .<ssssss>mouthfeel be dilute by the alcohol content and lack of carbonation .<ssssss>this beer be past its prime ; too bad they use a cork and do not cap it too .<ssssss>
8 7 9 6 7		light roast and coffee aroma with a slight yeast fruity character .<ssssss>deep black with a nice tan head .<ssssss>head stay thick for a pint .<ssssss>i know this sound like blasphemy , but it be kind of dark for a porter .<ssssss>no light even hold up to a bulb .<ssssss>flavor be lot of base malt and not a lot of dark or roast malt .<ssssss>the dark malt be there but it seem ` tame ' .<ssssss>very clean fermentation too .<ssssss>not much yeast character that i can pick up .<ssssss>bittering hop level be on the high end .<ssssss>medium body and good carbonation level .<ssssss>not a bad example of the style but not one that seem to stand out for I .<ssssss>neither robust or brown , not roasty enough on the one end and not malty enough on the other .<ssssss>
8 6 6 8 7		murky , dark brown appearance with little to no head .<ssssss>taste be sweet , a little strong on the alcohol .<ssssss>some undertone of vanilla from the bourbon aging .<ssssss>fairly strong malt presence with little hop present .<ssssss>overall , interesting and different from most barleywine i drink .<ssssss>however , i do like some more hop like in most west coast barleywine .<ssssss>also find that this grow on I as i drink it , but im not sure if id pick this one up again .<ssssss>
9 8 9 8 5		on-tap at prime 16 into a snifter .<ssssss>a : brilliant , clear ruby-amber body support three quarter of a inch of delicate white foam ; good retention and spotty lacing at first , eventually settle into a bubble-free liquid that leave thick leg all around the snifter - now that be a barleywine !<ssssss>s : pungent and memorable , with alcohol , citrus , and candy fruit .<ssssss>hard to pierce through the initial wave of intensity to pick up secondary note , though , even toward the end .<ssssss>t : big , complex , and delicious -lrb- especially at first -rrb- , with flavor of maple , candied fruit , deep citrus , chocolate , and sweet alcohol .<ssssss>lose half a point as the complexity of the first half get overwhelm by the sweetness toward the end , as the beer devolve into a hugely sweet and boozy clone of 120 min - still tasty , but not the incredible experience it be at first .<ssssss>m : rich , smooth , and mouth-coating , but with enough velvety carbonation to stave off cloying for a surprisingly long time ; very nice , indeed .<ssssss>d : practically non-existent , especially toward the end - and , surprisingly enough , not primarily because of the astronomical abv .<ssssss>this one 's just too sweet for I , and each sip past 6 oz or so become a chore .<ssssss>i would have rather pay half as much for half the pour .<ssssss>note : awesome beer , which should be obvious by my complaint be that it start to taste like 120 .<ssssss>it might have even be flirt with a 5 for taste if i would be review a 4 or 6 oz sample - the combination of candy citrus and faint chocolate be intoxicate in both literal and figurative way .<ssssss>i would definitely recommend seek out this hugely flavorful beer to try with a friend or two .<ssssss>cheer !<ssssss>
8 10 8 9 7		off the tap there be little head in the tulip glass at blacksparrow pub .<ssssss>the sweetness of the malt be more reminiscent of dogfishhead 's 60-90-120 ipa than three floyd , but the spice nicely blend both brewer ' character .<ssssss>i originally write `` both brewer ' traditional character '' but it somehow do not seem right to add `` traditional , '' and yet ... anyway , the cardamom come through as a top note and then return in the boozy finish .<ssssss>there be burnt sugar and molasses with the malty middle , but those exotic spice dominate .<ssssss>imperfect yet wonderful ; a great cozy night by the fireplace sipper in wintertime .<ssssss>
5 4 6 7 8		good for sit back and watch the hockey game , or hang out in the dorm .<ssssss>pour a typical straw color , head disapear quickly .<ssssss>not much smell to it .<ssssss>a average candian lager , i take this over labatt any day , plus the twin label can give you a good laugh sometimes .<ssssss>overall not a `` amazing '' beer , but one i would buy again .<ssssss>
8 4 3 4 5		a : pour from a bottle into a pint glass with a deep caramel color , but look through the glass , this beer settle into a dark , slightly reddish color , almost like a cola .<ssssss>a head be present , but it be a mild tan , unremarkable , and full of larger bubble as if you pour a budwiser , foamy not frothy .<ssssss>s : you get the malt , some coffee , maybe a hint of orangy sweetness , but not much else .<ssssss>taste : some roasted malt hit you upfront , but they be weak and quickly become drown out by a rice-y taste , slightly nutty .<ssssss>the back end emulate more coffee ... but not that rich coffee taste i love in a beer , more like week-old burnt coffee ground taste with the accompany acidity .<ssssss>after taste remind I of eat anise and waterlogged wood or leave -- poorly pronounced grain and more of a dirt taste .<ssssss>m : wash over the tongue without viscosity , or any body remotely close to a stout .<ssssss>feel more like a light brown or esb .<ssssss>thinner , bubbly texture , far from smooth or silky .<ssssss>o : dogfish head 's worst beer that i have try .<ssssss>i be a huge fan of dfh from they beer to they story , but this beer be almost undrinkable .<ssssss>this beer lack the structural texture of a stout , completely lack any sort of pleasant complexity , and taste like burnt leaf .<ssssss>such a disappointment for a beer that have be a long standing seasonal from on of my favorite brewery , and one i have be look forward to for a long time .<ssssss>sorry sam calagione , but you get ta do better than this .<ssssss>
8 3 7 9 8		appearance : decent head atop a pale golden body .<ssssss>good lacing to boot .<ssssss>smell : macro crap do not really smell or taste like much , but this seem to be what it would smell like if it be magnify by 10 .<ssssss>just kind of a stale lager odor with note of vomit in the background .<ssssss>taste : ahhh , sweet redemption .<ssssss>the taste here be magnificent .<ssssss>a somewhat hoppy bite give way to a malty undercurrent .<ssssss>incredible balance make it hard to put the glass down .<ssssss>mouthfeel : nothing spectacular but still very nice .<ssssss>drinkability : just about as good as it get when it come to a summer thirst quencher .<ssssss>beef note : another good year for sierra .<ssssss>i have be get this every summer since i have know it exist and i do not see myself stop any time soon .<ssssss>
6 8 5 8 8		pay $ 3.99 for a bomber from bevmo in willow glen , can .<ssssss>pour into a pint glass with 2 pour .<ssssss>pour thick as molasses .<ssssss>head be the darkest shade of brown i have ever see on a beer .<ssssss>head be about a inch and a half which take about a minute and a half to dissipate .<ssssss>black in color .<ssssss>some small streak of lacing .<ssssss>sweet caramel roasted malt in the nose with hint of alcohol and chocolate .<ssssss>a very dry smell brew .<ssssss>i be wonder where the taste be in comparison to the strong aroma of this beer .<ssssss>after drink half of the bomber , the more moderate flavor be what start to grow on I -lrb- i usually be not a huge fan of stout -rrb- .<ssssss>the coffee with chocolate come out more in the taste thank the smell along with the heavy roasted malt which be more prevalent in the nose .<ssssss>quality organic ingredient .<ssssss>rather watery and light for a stout .<ssssss>little carbonation .<ssssss>one of the easiest dark beer to drink for I .<ssssss>
8 7 7 5 6		a : hazy pale orange .<ssssss>very fluffy white head .<ssssss>reasonable retention with better lacing .<ssssss>s : earthy , mellow hoppiness .<ssssss>bitterness dominate the aroma with a slight fruitiness .<ssssss>as it warm up , actually a nice sweet malt come into play as well .<ssssss>t : slick , slightly metallic , hop bitterness .<ssssss>slightly doughy .<ssssss>more biscuit , dry finish .<ssssss>m : tingly carbonation on a medium body .<ssssss>d : sort of shocking that i have a apa from the west coast that be not a hop bomb .<ssssss>not sure how i feel about that .<ssssss>
8 5 4 5 5		as with most other leinhenkugel beer , 1888 bock take some shortcut that cheapen the style .<ssssss>a standard bock-brown with mohogany highlight , good clarity , and a lot of carbonation .<ssssss>off white head show fizziness at first but soon settle into a froathy blanket that cover the beer and lace well .<ssssss>aside from the carbonation , the beer have a handsome appearance .<ssssss>the character of the beer be a one-dimentional malt flavor and aroma .<ssssss>wet grain flavor play a major role in the complexity where a malty melanoidin-rich flavor should take precedence .<ssssss>grain astringency give a awkward bite and hurt the smoothness of the beer .<ssssss>light caramel and toast try to make the beer bock worthy but be more of a tangent than a benefit .<ssssss>thin , harsh , and astringent - the mouthfeel be where the beer suffer the most .<ssssss>michelob amber bock pass for a better bock than this .<ssssss>not a good showing at all .<ssssss>
7 9 8 7 8		i be try to play up some similarity between the city of philadelphia and the beer 's appearance but it look so bright and sunny , yellow like a summer daffodil , and i have only ever visit philadelphia in the dead of winter !<ssssss>honestly , the glare be so bright it radiate even despite a filminess that make the glass look dusty as a old antique .<ssssss>allow I to play carnac the magnificent here : a flower shop , a tropical beach , the produce section of the grocery store ... what be the smell of yard ' philadelphia pale ale ?<ssssss>this bouquet be particularly strong suit in pineapple and grapefruit and waft with a delightful floral effervescence .<ssssss>it pleasantly reek to begin with and swirl only make it reek more .<ssssss>the flavour , while not quite as rip as the aroma , still taste of the same ` pink grapefruit and flower ' brand of hoppiness .<ssssss>and specially for the tongue a ` toast bread ' kind of maltiness be dish out and together they combine to make a taste that resemble some kind of candy citrus top lemon sponge cake .<ssssss>mmm , maybe i will try make that !<ssssss>?<ssssss>philadelphia pale ale may be american by birth and in name , but it remind I of a classic british cask offering : the hoppiness be lively and refreshingly acidic , the maltiness firm but not thick and the carbonation be casually lay back .<ssssss>not to mention , it be the kind of beer you could keep on drink all night - screw dog , beer like this be man 's best friend .<ssssss>they say it be always sunny in philadelphia and its namesake beer prove it .<ssssss>the golden shine , bright , buzz bouquet and zestful , tropical flavour give this beer the same character -lrb- and appeal -rrb- as a all-inclusive beach resort getaway .<ssssss>and the thought of some nice weather - or any weather , really - and a six pack of this be simply mouthwater .<ssssss>
7 8 9 10 8		500 ml corked and caged bottle that i have fly out to I from southbay drug before i be aware that this one would be make the round out to my part .<ssssss>glad to give geous the business , anyways !<ssssss>pour in to a snifter .<ssssss>appearance : pour a deep and fairly attractively hue cola , a dark woody brown with hint of auburn and red shine through depend upon the angle that the light hit this one .<ssssss>a relatively intense pour yield a relatively dramatic head that surge to a height of two finger before - true to its cola-like hue - fading in to a fizzy collar and a few dash of surface lacing .<ssssss>all remnant of the head be sustain not by virtue of any retention -lrb- most of which i imagine be kill by the spirit aging and the high abv % -rrb- but instead by a ton of brisk , large bubble carbonation , the quantity of which be both visible around the edge of the glass but also be suggest by the loud pop that the cork make when it be liberate from the neck of the bottle .<ssssss>aroma : nice at first , though it become a little too potent and astringent as it warm .<ssssss>at first , hint of toffee , caramel , and cocoa emerge warmly , mingle with a nice amount of raisin , plum , and fig .<ssssss>it be very pleasant at first , but go downhill far quicker than the taste do .<ssssss>taste : divine .<ssssss>the flavor profile of this beer suggest either that all beer age in bourbon barrel should : a -rrb- be do so for 18 month ; or b -rrb- be north coast 's old stock .<ssssss>i have not yet decide which one it be .<ssssss>toffee be strong up front , dominant in fact , particularly while this one be still relatively chill .<ssssss>it be a sweet but not overwhelmingly sweet toffee note , heavily caramelize , but with ton of raw sugar and bread note , mildly biscuity , and a little honey-like around the edge .<ssssss>the more lightly roasted , sweeter sugar transition beautifully in to a few heavier note , earthy , faintly coffee-like and with hint of cocoa nib .<ssssss>fruit be gloriously vibrant , range from tropical fruit to stone fruit like plum , cherry , and even a hint of apricot .<ssssss>dark fruit interplay particularly well with the malt base .<ssssss>a kiss of sour date be even present in the finish .<ssssss>and faintly , darkly , in the distance , the shadow of hop bitterness of session past stand solemnly , quietly , faintly bitter and mildly leafy .<ssssss>then there be the bourbon .<ssssss>the element present in the base beer here marry perfectly with every character bring to the party by these barrel .<ssssss>the estery brightness of the vanilla be strong , easily the strongest element from the barrel present here ; it marry perfectly with the heavier , dryer malt note , lend a vanilla-cocoa one-two punch that be fantastic .<ssssss>coconut fruitness interplay nicely with the raisin and cherry in the underlie base beer , and a nice amount of oaky wood sugar mingle well with the toffee and caramelize , glassy sugar .<ssssss>and the bourbon - spicy but not prickly , warm but not hot , lightly roasted but not sweet - interplay with all of the above : the sweetness of the unattenuated malt and fruit sugar as well as the dryness of the other ; the fade but still present hop note ; etc etc ad nauseum .<ssssss>it be beer like this that showcase precisely why beer can marry so perfectly with barrel aging , and - more importantly - how to do it right .<ssssss>mouthfeel : somehow , the huge amount of carbonation present here manage to not disrupt the smoothness of the body .<ssssss>this one manage to come across as bright , lively , and elevative ... but not erratic , uneven , or rough .<ssssss>even as the carbonation die down , it die down smoothly and evenly , though the ultimate end point of this beer be a slightly heavy one .<ssssss>no worry though - i have no problem with sip this one quickly , even though my better angel be tell I to savor every last drop .<ssssss>drinkability : and savor every last drop i do .<ssssss>i can not rate anything sport a 13.16 % that have this abrasive a nose higher than a 4.0 , but the remainder of this beer earn most every bit of that 4.0 , from the taste to the mouthfeel to the continuously and visible lively effervescence .<ssssss>there be certainly a few process issue with this beer - it be a little too bubbly , the head retention be not great , and it be a little harsh and chemically after it near room temperature ... but you almost want to forgive it for what it showcase here .<ssssss>a truly remarkable combination of flavor that pretty much prove why certain beer belong in barrel , i hope that north coast can gradually tweak this one as they continue to produce it to address a few of the other issue present here to make a fully well-rounded beer .<ssssss>if so , this one 's a candidate for the top 100 , if not much , much higher .<ssssss>
6 4 7 6 6		from 12/03/10 note .<ssssss>pour from a 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle into a pint glass .<ssssss>a - pour a dark brown color with two inch of off white head and moderate carbonation evident .<ssssss>s - smell of toast malt , and light caramel malt .<ssssss>not bad , but not much here .<ssssss>t - taste of roasted malt , toast malt , caramel malt , and chocolate .<ssssss>much better than the smell .<ssssss>m - medium body and low to moderate carbonation .<ssssss>pretty smooth .<ssssss>d - be not a huge fan of this one .<ssssss>it be not that bad , but nothing really stand out about it to I .<ssssss>not saranac 's best beer ; would not seek out again .<ssssss>
8 6 4 8 8		base on 7/18/10 tasting : this be good , but a bit too bitter for I .<ssssss>devil dancer would be a nice alternative .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be just sharp and not pleasant .<ssssss>you can `` feel '' this beer on you tongue .<ssssss>maybe a bitter hophead 's dream , but not mine .<ssssss>
7 8 6 5 5		pale honey color with a low and foamy off-white head that settle quickly .<ssssss>aroma of light sweet malt , some butter and marshmallow .<ssssss>mouthfeel be thin and watery .<ssssss>flavor be not complex and have no depth .<ssssss>consist mainly of corn follow by that burnt rubber aftertaste that remind I of bud .<ssssss>
7 3 2 3 2		2007 bottle .<ssssss>$ 9.99 from holiday wine cellar .<ssssss>pour into a small snifter .<ssssss>a : pour a hazy gold with no head .<ssssss>leave no lacing .<ssssss>lot of particulate .<ssssss>s : the first impression that hit I in the nose be barnyard .<ssssss>not a plant barnyard -lrb- like hay , alfalfa , etc . -rrb-<ssssss>, but a meat barnyard -lrb- pig , cow , goat -rrb- .<ssssss>and then a distinct bbq sauce aroma hit I .<ssssss>t : the bbq sauce aroma be the most prevalent part of the taste .<ssssss>sweet , mesquite , salt , meaty .<ssssss>beer should not be meaty .<ssssss>i use to think a bacon flavor in beer sound interesting .<ssssss>i no longer think that .<ssssss>they mix up the label .<ssssss>it be not a beer , but a bbq sauce .<ssssss>m : thick , viscous , smooth .<ssssss>no carbonation leave .<ssssss>leave a aftertaste of eat too many lay potato chip .<ssssss>plastic , salt , oily , olestra .<ssssss>/ shudder d : not drinkable at all .<ssssss>i want to drain pour it , but this have such a weird taste that i keep take one more sip .<ssssss>i will try a more recent brew if i come across it , but will not want to try the 2007 vintage again .<ssssss>unfortunately i have another one in my -lrb- currently -rrb- 5 bottle cellar -lrb- deep drawer in a cool part of the house -rrb- .<ssssss>
7 4 8 9 9		on tap at bodega recently .<ssssss>black , good thick consistency for the style which i like .<ssssss>small cap of tan foam and leave ok lace down my pint .<ssssss>little aroma come off this one .<ssssss>some mild roasted barley but i be otherwise leave want much more ... taste great , load of really dark malt lend a lot of roasted coffee flavor .<ssssss>some bitter dark chocolate and roasted barley .<ssssss>mouthfeel be really smooth , yet there be some small but furious bubble that emerge on the back of the tongue on the way down .<ssssss>very very drinkable , another overall success from dh .<ssssss>
10 9 10 8 7		note : 2008 bottle a - the glass mimic the event horizon of a black hole .<ssssss>tall deep tan head that dissipate surprisingly quickly .<ssssss>a good amount of lacing .<ssssss>almost like cappuccino or hot chocolate .<ssssss>frothy .<ssssss>s - roasted malt , licorice , chocolate and coffee .<ssssss>there be very little sign of that burnt aroma that characterize so many imperial stout .<ssssss>t - more bitter and fresh tasting than expect -lrb- a pleasant surprise -rrb- .<ssssss>the alcohol be integrate well in the overall flavor of the beer .<ssssss>dare i say that i be want something with a little more heat ?<ssssss>roasted malt be stand tall , with licorice and coffee battle it out for the remain space on the taste bud .<ssssss>a wood taste be present but only mildly so .<ssssss>this be one tasty beverage .<ssssss>m - this be probably the smoothest , silkiest , and pleasant mouthfeel i have have .<ssssss>i do not really know what the term `` silky '' mean when describe consistency until i have this beer .<ssssss>i give this a perfect as it be the best i have have , but a little more carbonation would make this off the chart in my opinion .<ssssss>d - a little heavy for a long night , but 11 % keep the volume consume in check so that it do not become much of a issue .<ssssss>
7 9 4 5 8		corked bottle thanks to chris pour into my hill farmstead glass ... a cloudy murky dark straw , do not look very good .<ssssss>lot of bright white head at first with good carbonation , but its watery .<ssssss>good retention and lacing ... the aroma be pretty nice , sweet candy wheat , honey , floral finish ... the taste really be disappointing , borderline bad .<ssssss>almost totally dead , what i do get be bad peppery floral hop .<ssssss>finish really kill I as bad oak come off ... mouthfeel be the true downfall of this beer , watery light with no depth ... easy to drink but not good enough that i would .<ssssss>pretty disappointing for I after such a great aroma .<ssssss>i can not recommend this .<ssssss>
9 10 8 8 9		update : i try this beer again and i have to admit , i be not as blow away this time as i be before .<ssssss>it be a very good ipa , but really not nearly as special as i describe and originally rate .<ssssss>my first score be a 4.85 and the original text be leave untouched below .<ssssss>a -- pour a very bubby clear amber with two full finger of head .<ssssss>spotty lacing be leave behind on my pint glass .<ssssss>s -- huge , wonderful citrus smell .<ssssss>rival any other single ipa nose i have have .<ssssss>all hail west coast ipa brewer !<ssssss>t -- ok , now this be something special .<ssssss>upon first sip it feel as though it be go to be a wave of bitterness similar to the biggest dipa 's , but it never fully come .<ssssss>instead you be greet by a juicy citric hop flavor that be out of this world .<ssssss>this be what i think sculpin be go to taste like .<ssssss>this be wonderful .<ssssss>nice malt backbone to balance this out and make it smooth as silk .<ssssss>piney aftertaste .<ssssss>m -- medium body , wash down very clean .<ssssss>i wish there be a little more stickiness , but that be nitpick .<ssssss>very soft carbonation .<ssssss>d -- this be as drinkable as any ipa i have ever have .<ssssss>this have make I want to get another pliny very soon try it again because i have to have miss something if russian river can make and ipa like this .<ssssss>bravo , possibly -lrb- probably -rrb- my favorite single ipa .<ssssss>

6 8 5 8 7		pick up this wonderful 1 liter swingtop bottle in the barleywine bif last week .<ssssss>brew in 2006 .<ssssss>unfortunatly it be a leaker , but i have a little over half leave that i just go ahead and stick in the fridge to try .<ssssss>serve at 45 degree and allow to warm up to almost room temp by the end , i drink this be a lovely terrapin goblet .<ssssss>appearence - pour a nice honey color amber , with a decent amount of cloudiness to it .<ssssss>no head , or lacing , or carbonation of anykind unfortunatly .<ssssss>have a rather dull look , i be guess do to the leak .<ssssss>smell - the aroma be rich on bourbon .<ssssss>lotso sweet caramel note with hint of alcohol , honey , and a touch of light fruit .<ssssss>intrest aroma .<ssssss>taste - theflavor be more of the smae and be actually very good .<ssssss>a little flat , but rich bourbon like flavor wash over the tongue immediatly and cause a nice litter flutter on the tongue .<ssssss>lot of caramel and candy sugar like flavor below that and a long draw out sweet finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel - the feel be very flat , almost a touch too thin as well .<ssssss>no life to this one , which be a bit of a dissapointment .<ssssss>drinkability - it be good as far as rich flavor and ability to sip on it for a while , but after a hour or so that flat taste really start to wear on you and it start to turn into a effort .<ssssss>overall i would like to get another bottle of this to give a fair review , and will update accordingly when i do .<ssssss>but it seem like it might have be solid provide it have a bit more carbonation .<ssssss>

5 6 8 6 9		bottled on 05/04/05 it pour a surprisingly pale gold color with a small white head .<ssssss>if the head be more substantial it would look just like a pilsener .<ssssss>aroma be pleasant yet mild and the hop do play a major role .<ssssss>they be of the spicy and floral variety .<ssssss>there be hint of tangerine , orange peel and chamomile .<ssssss>some creamy malt be also evident .<ssssss>the palate be bitter and dry yet balanced .<ssssss>the flavor be mostly tangerine with a decent malt character .<ssssss>floral element show on the finish , maybe a touch of honey as well .<ssssss>this be a interesting beer and a difficult one to review .<ssssss>even as a ` pale ipa ' -lrb- no caramel malt - which be quite legit -rrb- it seem to miss the mark by use a very neutral base malt , fairly clean yeast and not enough hop .<ssssss>on the other hand it be a refreshing and crisp beer that be pleasant to drink .<ssssss>in try to be fair i be give this one a high drinkability rating .<ssssss>
8 9 10 9 8		this be from the limited spring 2008 release .<ssssss>appearance : pour from the 22oz bomber into a large snifter .<ssssss>the beer be a motor oil thick black hole from which no light can escape , even when hold directly to a light .<ssssss>a dark tan , creamy head sit atop the brew , two and a half finger thick with pretty good retention , leave ring all the way down the glass after every sip .<ssssss>smell : dark chocolate and sweet , milky coffee come together to create a rich and intoxicating aroma .<ssssss>a bit of roastiness that be also slightly burnt round thing out in the aroma .<ssssss>taste : nice introduction to the tastebud with the flavor of real hot chocolate .<ssssss>big coffee-like roastiness also come through .<ssssss>have a bit of vanilla in the middle , along with a nice hop bite to keep thing in check .<ssssss>creamy caramel come though for a moment .<ssssss>finish with a bit of dark chocolate , as if i just take a bite from a bar of godiva and just let it melt in my mouth .<ssssss>mouthfeel : thick , heavy , rich , and full-bodied .<ssssss>creamy throughout the mouth and finish sooo smoothly .<ssssss>awesome .<ssssss>if it be this good now , what would it be like with even just a touch of age on it ?<ssssss>i wish i could try it , but alas , i be leave the country .<ssssss>still , this be a great ris .<ssssss>

10 4 9 8 8		i think this beer be absolutely beautiful .<ssssss>its a dark purple haze with a soft head that stay wrap around the inside of the glass like a silky spiderweb .<ssssss>since , the look be so exquisite i expect fruity goodness , but to be honest it make I want to puke .<ssssss>it smell like the robitussin my mom use to give that i would have to hold my nose for .<ssssss>it definitely taste better than it smell .<ssssss>it actually taste quite good , but for just a millisecond i could taste the cough syrup flavor .<ssssss>now it could just be my mind play trick on I or it could actually be there , but after that all you can taste be a fresh fruity flavor .<ssssss>this beer go down well b/c of the way it linger in you mouth after , but i find it hard to drink one right after another .<ssssss>this be definitely stronger than i expect , but i would drink it again .<ssssss>i can not wait until i try all there flavor and more .<ssssss>i do not know what it be but , i absolutely love fruit beer !<ssssss>!<ssssss>!<ssssss>
9 5 8 9 9		500 ml bottle , a : pour a translucent amber with a finger of white head , great head retention and lace throught the whole pint .<ssssss>s : mari otter malt , some fruit and lemon , but quite light .<ssssss>t : the flavour be impressive .<ssssss>strong toffee and biscuit malt , balanced well with some dry , earthy and hearty golding flavour .<ssssss>twinge of sourness mid-palate and finish bitter .<ssssss>m : smooth , medium-bodied but not heavy .<ssssss>calming hoppy aftertaste .<ssssss>light carbonation make it very quaffable .<ssssss>d : a very nice bitter/pale ale right here .<ssssss>wish it be not so expensive , it could be my new easy drinking british ale to stick with for a evening .<ssssss>
8 3 6 5 6		wow , something i do not expect .<ssssss>the perfect pour from a can with a widget .<ssssss>the color run bottom to top a deep amber with a gradual lighter tint , until you reach the creamy white head .<ssssss>it look almost picture perfect in the glass .<ssssss>bring my nose to the rim to sniff ... nothing , i mean nothing .<ssssss>i do not smell anything , maybe some burnt caramel .<ssssss>i hand the glass to my wife for a sniff -lrb- she can smell the coffee brewing .<ssssss>.<ssssss>in columbia -rrb- she plainly state it smell good , nothing more .<ssssss>another reason to keep the wife away from my beer .<ssssss>the taste be smooth and very much like eat bread .<ssssss>the creamy head last well after several sip and the taste remain the same throughout : bland and breadlike .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be moldy , for a lack of a better word , weak and , again bread-like .<ssssss>it have a simpleness to it that raise the drinkability , it have no real taste ; therefore , you really can not complain .<ssssss>this beer really look great in the glass even if you can not really taste it , you will look good drinking it .<ssssss>if that be what you be into .<ssssss>
8 7 6 8 6		this be my first review and all in all the red frog ale be a good beer .<ssssss>it have a nice hoppy/malty smell , which be always good , and it have nice rich dark red coloring .<ssssss>the mouth feel of it be ok , not thick but definitely not light , for I the more hoppy beer leave I with cotton mouth , which always suck .<ssssss>i could have a few of these in a sit , but any more than a few of bottle would start to be a little much .<ssssss>i havent try that many red ale but i think it be decent and worth try .<ssssss>
10 5 6 6 8		it be get a great creamy head .<ssssss>the color be equally great .<ssssss>a deep and cloudy amber .<ssssss>the aroma be a bit light but smell of wheat and hay .<ssssss>the flavor be a bit lack .<ssssss>there be a bit of caramel undertone to it .<ssssss>definitely can taste the wheat .<ssssss>it be get a medium body .<ssssss>and the finish have a little bit of hop to it .<ssssss>it be a beer you could easily drink a lot of , but not one to really enjoy .<ssssss>it be kind of a jack up yuengling .<ssssss>more flavor , more color .<ssssss>but certainly less than special .<ssssss>
6 7 7 9 8		the beer pour golden yellow with a whispy layer of foam on top .<ssssss>the aroma be exactly what i want from a witbier , orangy and spicy .<ssssss>the flavor be good and match the nose with a slight bitterness .<ssssss>the body be light , make it a great hot-summer-day beer .<ssssss>
8 6 8 9 9		have a pint of this at the fly saucer in raleigh , nc , serve from the tap .<ssssss>a-burnt orange in color , 1 finger head , clean look .<ssssss>s - not much in the nose , a little floral hop , but not much .<ssssss>i would just have a dogfish head 90min ipa , so there be a very noticable difference in the big aroma of the 90 to this one .<ssssss>t-surprisingly good consider the lack of nose i be get .<ssssss>nice up front hop bite , floral , a little citrus .<ssssss>quite smooth , actually .<ssssss>m-mildy oily from the hop , linger for a bit , clean otherwise .<ssssss>d-highly drinkable , though i could not pound these-but then , pound be for wanker .<ssssss>definitely like it .<ssssss>
6 8 6 6 7		large capped bottle .<ssssss>pour into a snifter , it be pitch black , with minimal head , just about no lacing .<ssssss>aroma be this beer 's best part , smoke , piney hop , chocolate , coffee , possibly some oats .<ssssss>body be not as full as i expect , and the minimal carbonation subtract a bit more from the enjoyment .<ssssss>some note of chocolate , some coffee , minimal oats , and a lot of hop and alcohol heat .<ssssss>it feel somewhere between a black ipa and a overhopp stout , with citric and piney note that just do not blend very well , and then the alcohol heat keep on come .<ssssss>i be disappoint .<ssssss>
9 8 10 9 8		i have be able to sample this twice now , thanks to the generosity of fellow bas acme and kmpitz2 .<ssssss>thanks guy !<ssssss>thick and viscous pour , the dimpled surface of foam be reminiscient of creme brule .<ssssss>on the side of the glass , there be a soy saucy color when it it swirl .<ssssss>impenetrable blackness in a glass .<ssssss>aroma of very dark and deeply roasted malt , caramelize sugar , with the slight sharpness of alcohol in the back .<ssssss>huge char maltiness on the palate , fudgy like a espresso brownie , deep earthiness .<ssssss>aftertaste carry a spiciness from the hop , with a long finish that be dry and roasty .<ssssss>super thick mouthfeel , absolutely velvety and palate-coating .<ssssss>a mild bitterness be there too .<ssssss>this be a slow sipper , it go without say .<ssssss>abv be feel , but hide well enough .<ssssss>possibly the best ever from bell .<ssssss>
7 8 8 4 5		pour a golden yellow color with a moderate size white head and little to no lacing .<ssssss>smell very strongly of spice like those find in white beer .<ssssss>i do not care for the taste of this one at all .<ssssss>i feel it be just way over spice .<ssssss>the flavor do not meld at all and it be too much for I .<ssssss>too sweet , too spiced , and too much of a cloying bitterness .<ssssss>this beer would be better pair with some food that match the strong spice flavor of this beer .<ssssss>there be none of that great musty funk that be typically find in farmhouse saison , instead it be very clean , closer to a strong white beer .<ssssss>the taste improve at the bottom of the bottle as i mix in some of the yeast .<ssssss>the earthy and metallic yeast flavor block out some of the strong spice flavor .<ssssss>mouthfeel be quite good , just the right amount of carbonation .<ssssss>overall though , i would not recommend this beer , but maybe it be just I .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 9		wow the cap on this growler be so tight i almost have to get the pliers out .<ssssss>a clear brownish red color with a small beige head that leave a nice chunky lace .<ssssss>the aroma be buttery with a little spruce and stick to the nose .<ssssss>thick fruity mostly plum taste hold for awhile until a citrus hop flavor balance it out .<ssssss>the carbonation be near perfect for I , not overwhelming like most pale ale .<ssssss>this be so drinkable i think i be go to enjoy the whole growler myself .<ssssss>
9 8 9 9 6		12oz bottle into pint .<ssssss>very good stout .<ssssss>best by 2014 , as per bottle .<ssssss>this beer be burnt coffee black , pretty heavy on the mouthfeel , and hop beyond belief .<ssssss>good coffee malt/burnt malt/chocolate malt ?<ssssss>backing .<ssssss>one of the hoppyest riss i have have , i be really enjoy this beer -lrb- as a hop head at heart -rrb- .<ssssss>i will buy some more of this ... i really enjoy it !<ssssss>
8 9 8 10 7		2004 vintage a - pour with a really nice clear bright red and a pink head that fade really fast .<ssssss>s - you can smell some real funky smell from the yeast that be pretty pungent yet a bit restrained .<ssssss>ultimately the stinky aroma give way to a really nice sour cherry smell .<ssssss>t - quite sour , moreso than i expect .<ssssss>the cherry be there the entire time and develop into a really concentrated sour cherry taste -lrb- though there be some sweetness at the same time -rrb- .<ssssss>cherry taste real concentrate compare to other sour cherry beer .<ssssss>m - about normal for this kind of beer .<ssssss>d - as good as it be on the sens this beer be too acidic for I .<ssssss>i have not really experienced anything that be too acidic since my very first sour beer and think i have just get use to it , but this really burn -lrb- the 2 other people i be drink it with say they feel throat and esophageal burning from it also -rrb- .<ssssss>so just a bit on the acidic side but that be to be expect somewhat .<ssssss>still really nice , a good beer to enjoy a glass of , though i do not know if i could take more .<ssssss>
9 8 6 9 7		16.9 ounce bottle from trader joe 's in westchester pour dark brown into my pint glass with a huge white head not as dark as i think it would be , smell be good , very grainy , some chocolate and roasted barley pretty much a meal because of thickness , comparable to guinness with its appearance very malty and not very drinkable because it be so heavy , chewy at time as well would drink again especially for the price<ssssss>
7 8 9 7 10		bottle be almost identical to the framboise .<ssssss>pour the entire bottle into a tall pilsner glass .<ssssss>a - great variation in color from orange at the thin bottom of glass to a reddish brown at the thicker top .<ssssss>look hazy until hold up to the light , reveal good clarity .<ssssss>a white head with a slightly reddish tint .<ssssss>good retention : leave a consistent and level layer of foam .<ssssss>no sign of carbonation in the glass .<ssssss>lot of sediment float throughout .<ssssss>ton of lace that slide down the steep side of the glass .<ssssss>s - smell of sweet cherry , cherry syrup and cherry puree .<ssssss>a slight tanginess in the background .<ssssss>deeper inhale make you nose tingle like smell a soda .<ssssss>t - first you just get a zap from the carbonation -lrb- which interestingly be not detectable by look at the beer -rrb- .<ssssss>once that subside , restrained flavor of cherry .<ssssss>only cherry flavor with no skin or pit .<ssssss>syrupy in the front of mouth with a sweet residue , but also leave a cleanse sensation .<ssssss>a tiny tartness in the finish with very minor dust taste .<ssssss>m - tingly and very carbonated at the start .<ssssss>light and refreshing throughout .<ssssss>d - because this be not overly sweet and because it be so light and refreshing , this have great drinkability if you can enjoy the fruit flavor and lack of traditional lambic tartness .<ssssss>
7 8 8 10 8		perfect autumn brew .<ssssss>have this at a nice dinner potluck with friend in early october .<ssssss>straight from bottle , have a nice thickness and warm taste .<ssssss>very much like a toffee and cinamin with a slight malted hoppy finish , go down so smooth .<ssssss>perfect for a crisp autumn night with friend .<ssssss>
7 7 7 3 3		full disclosure : drink this beer last night , take note on it today .<ssssss>appearance : a bright , perky look beer .<ssssss>light in color , i do not remember much about the head .<ssssss>smell : the hop hit I first , and i be intrigue .<ssssss>taste : this be the first beer in a long time that i have refuse to finish .<ssssss>cloying sweetness , with a malt liquor-y flavor .<ssssss>the bittering hop do not balance the sweetness -- instead , you be hit sequentially with sweetness , bitterness , and then hoppy flavor .<ssssss>i would love to know the flavor hop that the brewer use -- i can not remember tasting they before , and think they would be well suit for a dry beer .<ssssss>however , the flavor clash with the sweetness , and leave I with the sensation of have eat slightly rotten fruit .<ssssss>mouthfeel : typical , it be a bit syruppy .<ssssss>drinkability : as i mention above , i find this beer aversive .<ssssss>to be fair , the friend i give it to to finish enjoy it quite a bit .<ssssss>
8 7 8 10 9		pour into a pint glass .<ssssss>a typical cream-colored head sit atop this but soon dissipate to nothing but a ring of cream bubble around the edge .<ssssss>no lacing whatsoever .<ssssss>the color of the beer be a deep rich mahogany , it be darker color tell I what be in store .<ssssss>mouth feel be perfect for the style , it be not light at all , its get just enough carbonation and be worth take you time on .<ssssss>the taste be exceptional .<ssssss>this be easily the best pumpkin ale i have have .<ssssss>it be hearty , strong , and tasty .<ssssss>there be less `` spice '' presence and more pumpkin .<ssssss>it taste like a pumpkin ale , and not a spiced ale , as almost every other brewery out there produce .<ssssss>i almost hate say this , but yes , it taste more like pumpkin pie than anything else i have have .<ssssss>be careful here .<ssssss>this beer be good , and the high abv can sneak up on you .<ssssss>highly recommend .<ssssss>
9 6 9 7 7		bear in 2006 a - thick , hazy dark amber , border on brown .<ssssss>rather active carbonation leave a stream of tiny bubble quickly rise to the top .<ssssss>thin , quarter-inch tan head quickly fade to just a faint ring around the edge .<ssssss>s - fruit and alochol .<ssssss>lot of alcohol .<ssssss>i have always hear this be a boozy one and i think 5 year might help to mask it , but it be still dominate by alcohol .<ssssss>a nice backing of a berry fruitiness blend with the alochol and just a touch of burnt sugar linger underneath .<ssssss>lot of good smell in there , they just struggle to emerge .<ssssss>t - sweet dark fruit and just a hint of berry up front .<ssssss>alcohol be certainly present but not the dominate force like it be in the nose .<ssssss>after a few drink i start notice hint of dark bread , caramel and a touch of burnt sugar .<ssssss>some dark fruit sneak in as well with a touch of fig come to mind .<ssssss>m - medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation .<ssssss>provide just enough life on the tongue to move the taste through .<ssssss>o - a bit boozy but still well meld together on the tongue .<ssssss>wasnt a big fan of the aroma .<ssssss>i know 10 % + beer be go to have alcohol on the nose , it just seem like some do a better job of show off other smell as well .<ssssss>
10 8 5 6 6		have this on tap at station 2 in richmond va - pint look amazing , very dark with dark head , very generous foam .<ssssss>smell nice a smokey like a barbeque .<ssssss>taste be okay however the booze knock my sock off in a bad way .<ssssss>.<ssssss>very solventy .<ssssss>counld not finish the beer .<ssssss>

7 6 6 4 5		on draft at birreria paradisio in georgetown , d.c .<ssssss>decent up front .<ssssss>nice color and surprisingly low carbonation .<ssssss>a touch sour , but still possess a bit of smoky smell and that distinctive sour mash smell .<ssssss>taste be pretty unremarkable for a bourbon-aged porter .<ssssss>some dark fruit and smokiness .<ssssss>also a surprise , the roundness of the beer , which be awkward because the beer round out while the sourness remain on the palate .<ssssss>still adjust to the style , but this one have a full-bodied bourbon flavor without the high alcohol , which unfortunately just render the sour mash to be the predominant attribute of the mouthfeel and finish .<ssssss>leave a sour residue on the back end that taste more like sour coke than bourbon-soaked beer .<ssssss>

7 9 9 7 8		from a 750 , exit 6 pour a hazy , amber-gold hue with a small head .<ssssss>retain a thin layer with average lacing .<ssssss>aroma be very nice , and more rewarding than the flavor , i find .<ssssss>there be a really pleasant combination of earthy , woodsy hop tone and also grassy , lemony aroma , probably from the sorachi ace .<ssssss>the flavor have a sturdy bitterness combine with toasty , biscuity malt and some spice from the rye .<ssssss>the problem be , this beer do not finish very clean for I .<ssssss>i think it have something to do with the hop combination , which provide some nice grassy and herbal flavor , but finish vegetal and dirty .<ssssss>it be not bad , really , just not ideal .<ssssss>the mouthfeel make up for the flavor though : it be fluffy and resinous , but not heavy .<ssssss>drink pretty easily , and have some nice belgian flair as well , with hint of fruity yeastiness .<ssssss>if this beer 's flavor could attain the level of its aroma and mouthfeel , then this would be outstanding .<ssssss>as it stand , b + .<ssssss>

6 6 8 6 6		i get this one in a gifted beer club sampler .<ssssss>a - golden yellow , highly carbonate on pour .<ssssss>bubble quickly rise to top to create a nice thick head , which diminish to a nice lace .<ssssss>s - typical of ipa .<ssssss>t - malty , highly hop -lrb- yet sweet -rrb- , finish dry m - full , dry d - good .<ssssss>i would not sit and drink a lot of these , but would finish up a 6 pack in the fridge over three day if there be nothing more interesting .<ssssss>
8 4 6 2 3		yikes !<ssssss>not what i expect at all .<ssssss>taste like corn syrup with maple flavor add .<ssssss>if aunt jemima brew a beer i imagine this be what i think it would taste like .<ssssss>the beer have good carbonation and a nice look to it but there be way too much unfermented sugar leave in this beast .<ssssss>the reason the alcohol be hide so well be because of the sugar .<ssssss>i do not have a problem with sweet beer either ... this one just miss the mark for I .<ssssss>
5 4 6 3 4		this be a tough one to review , as other have state , it be a very bland beer .<ssssss>appearance : a fizzy pale yellow .<ssssss>too it be credit , it pour well and form a nice head -- that do not stick around long .<ssssss>smell : corny .<ssssss>only after allow a good amount of warmup can i detect a extremely faint hop aroma .<ssssss>taste : again , corny with a slight trace of hop , but nothing i can really identify .<ssssss>the aftertaste be a bit like corn flake .<ssssss>mouthfeel : a good amount of fizziness .<ssssss>the carbonation stand out due to the dull flavor .<ssssss>drinkability : yes , it be easy to drink .<ssssss>but after it be go , i really want a different , more flavorful beer .<ssssss>at 50 cent a can , i have to try red oval .<ssssss>i be hope that it would be a little bit better than simpler time , but it be really similar or worse .<ssssss>if there be some other lager you have not have at trader joe 's , i would suggest you pick it up instead of this one .<ssssss>
5 5 8 5 6		buy in to complete the samuel smith line up ... a prettty decent lager ... a good bitterness level ... low lacing ... a good organic that do not remind I of hippie .<ssssss>.<ssssss>not much else to this beer , to sum it up : a simple non offensive organic-fad lager from tadcaster .<ssssss>.5 % .<ssssss>.<ssssss>
8 7 9 7 7		appearance : pour a clear brown color with ruby highlight .<ssssss>about 3/4 '' of tan head form , which have pretty decent lacing and okay retention .<ssssss>smell : smell nutty , with a bit of coffee and cocoa .<ssssss>nice malty smell , without a lot of hop character .<ssssss>appropriate for the style .<ssssss>taste : very malty all around .<ssssss>nutty , with lighter coffee and cocoa accent .<ssssss>hop character be limited but still present .<ssssss>mouthfeel/overall : light-medium in body , with abundant , fine carbonation .<ssssss>smooth drinking .<ssssss>overall , it be a good brown ale that border very good , but do not go the extra mile to differentiate itself .<ssssss>
8 7 4 7 6		thick black opaque pour with a fluffy brown head .<ssssss>smell be standard roasty malt with bit of chocolate and/or coffee at time .<ssssss>upon first sip its easy to see this be excessively overcarbonate for a stout .<ssssss>-lrb- or any style -rrb- not sure if its just my bottle , but its like drinking black champagne .<ssssss>taste be semi dry roasty malt , and be fairly one-note and simplistic but nice overall .<ssssss>not great , and i be hope it be just this bottle with the freak carbonation .<ssssss>`` creamy texture '' as state in the commercial description could not be farther from the truth in my experience .<ssssss>
7 10 7 9 10		pour from a bottle into a brooklyn brewery tulip .<ssssss>a - nice amber , sandy color , transluscent , yet clear .<ssssss>the one-finger head do not last long , but the bubbly collar cling .<ssssss>s - killer hop aroma , equal part dry pellet and juicy citrus .<ssssss>remind I of what a tangerine orchard would smell like at the first blossom of the year , with a bit of piney , grassy bite .<ssssss>hint of sugary malt run right to the top of the nasal cavity .<ssssss>this be one of the best there be .<ssssss>t - definitely drive by the hop , but these hop create some complex flavor .<ssssss>the hint of citrus be still there , but the flavor do not exhibit quite the sweetness of the aroma .<ssssss>there be a bit of a cough syrup flavor hide in there .<ssssss>if you like you hop bitter , you can find it here , but the balance here ensure you do not leave with a bitter look on you face .<ssssss>m - a nice , smooth , creamy carbonation -lrb- almost like a boddington 's or guinness -rrb- without that sharp edge that some of the more bubbly beer display .<ssssss>d - awesome at home for a single during the week , even better out at mcshea 's on draft for a extended drink .<ssssss>
8 6 7 9 6		this 2006 barley wine pour a nice clear red color with a off white head that fade to a thin film .<ssssss>the aroma be very malty , not quite enough hop to really stand out .<ssssss>the taste on the other hand be very nice with a lot of malt character and a dry hoppy finish .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be a little heavy for I , but the warmth make up for that .<ssssss>
9 8 7 6 8		i have have a few of these , and no two pour have yield the same color scheme .<ssssss>so far i have see a light purple and a orangish/reddish pour ; both have nice foamy head .<ssssss>i love raspberry , so the linger smell be delightful .<ssssss>taste very fruity ... definitely a after-dinner or desert beer for I .<ssssss>mouthfeel be good ... very smooth with little carbonation .<ssssss>
8 7 10 8 8		appearance : black with a hint of transparency around the edge .<ssssss>good head retention on this one .<ssssss>smell : char malt with a touch of acidity .<ssssss>not a ton go on in the aroma .<ssssss>taste & mouthfeel : roasty and dry .<ssssss>baker 's chocolate , coffee and a hint of smoke .<ssssss>i be surprised at how much this still taste like regular old guinness , just with actual flavor and body .<ssssss>dry through and through with a medium-full body .<ssssss>this be excellent stuff , it be a shame that it have such limited distribution .<ssssss>note : get this one as a extra from johnnnniee .<ssssss>thanks !<ssssss>definitely one of the cooler extra i have ever receive .<ssssss>
6 8 8 5 4		be a big fan of dark porter , i have high expectation for this beer that be unfortunately not meet .<ssssss>everything up to the point of tasting the beer be a great experience .<ssssss>the pour be smooth , about 1/4 '' of head , and the smell of the brew be fantastic .<ssssss>it smell very strong , with a chocolately aroma .<ssssss>the taste of the beer however be just ok .<ssssss>it do not blow I away .<ssssss>the worst part of it be in fact its aftertaste .<ssssss>once i be half way through , i be actually glad that i only have 1/2 bottle leave as the aftertaste leave a mildly stale taste in my mouth .<ssssss>overall , engine oil be not terrible , but if i be go to spend 4 buck for a bottled porter brew , i would look elsewhere .<ssssss>
8 5 9 8 9		12 fl oz appearance clear garnet body ; inch-thick white head ; nice lace smell a touch of the skunk await I ; metallic ; grainy ; id like to have another to make sure this be proper taste great sweetness in the middle ; thankfully the tiny skunk move elsewhere ; slight bitterness enter midway and slacken late ; a nice late caramel with even a touch of roast ; the faintest dark fruit be present ; close remain mostly sweet with a slight bitterness mouthfeel & drinkability clean and smooth with a almost medium body but not quite ; lightly carbonate this would be a great session beer if the smell of this particular sample clear up<ssssss>
4 4 5 2 3		pour out into something closely resemble apple juice .<ssssss>the nose be dusty , medicinal , slightly sweet .<ssssss>the taste be ... .<ssssss>ummm ... not good .<ssssss>i be try to find a constructive way to describe this , but ti 's just not good .<ssssss>no carbonation , slight , yet offensive flavor .<ssssss>few to no redeaming quality .<ssssss>
6 4 5 7 6		buy this cause i have not have this beer in a while , want to try it again .<ssssss>pour a golden yellow color , a bit darker than the average macro .<ssssss>smell very faintly sweet , but not much .<ssssss>taste pretty good , sweet malt upfront , faint hop but some skunk throw in for good measure -lrb- damn green bottle -rrb- but the skunk be not as bad as , heinikin for example .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit thin and fuzzy .<ssssss>overall it be quite drinkable and think it would be a lot better if it be in brown bottle , get rid of the skunk and it may be almost as good as pilsner urquell .<ssssss>
8 6 8 9 9		this doppelbock 's color be often refer to as mahogany in color , this capture the color accurately but have the side effect of take I back to first grade when my dad redo the bathroom use mahogany trim .<ssssss>the little foam that develop dissipate quickly .<ssssss>its interesting peer through the glass that only show its translucence when bright light be behind it .<ssssss>the smell be warm , like a mixture of coffee and perfectly burnt toast , where there be a little blackness but it complement the peanut butter so you do not mind .<ssssss>it taste pretty good , the complex flavor stay in you mouth even after a bright finish .<ssssss>i be impressed by the simplicity , there be simple interaction between the flavor that blossom into something interesting .<ssssss>give the taste i would have expect a much thicker liquid , the brew be light and the carbonation just right .<ssssss>i would definitely recommend this one .<ssssss>very drinkable to the point i want to know more about this style .<ssssss>
7 4 8 7 8		appearence - cloudy yellow , i agree with the reviewer who state melt butter .<ssssss>the head that start fairly good size then go to a thin lace on the top really add to the butter description .<ssssss>cloudy enough that it be hard to see carbonation but i can see from the top that it be present .<ssssss>smell - a very slight biscuity scent .<ssssss>taste - light and refreshing .<ssssss>alcohol be not really notice .<ssssss>a good beer for hot day on a patio .<ssssss>i wonder about the agave .<ssssss>i do not really know what it add to this beer or if i even taste it .<ssssss>mouthfeel - no really aftertaste or bitterness .<ssssss>it be just as i describe before light and refreshing .<ssssss>drinkablity - usually i drink heavier , darker beer .<ssssss>but i can see my get a six pack for a bbq , picnic or other summertime activity .<ssssss>
5 6 7 8 6		very frothy head subside quickly atop a utterly clear beer .<ssssss>the clear golden color be very nice but the carbonic acid bite a little too much in the flavor .<ssssss>nice maltiness balance by a strong german hop flavor be very enjoyable in this beer .<ssssss>light body be nice and a skunky hop bitterness be present in the finish .<ssssss>good german pilsner but a little too much carbonic acid make it lack in the smoothness department .<ssssss>
7 7 8 9 7		pour a deep brown color with a short dense khaki color head that settle into a light ring .<ssssss>the aroma be sweet with toffee note , candied fruit and some hint of oak .<ssssss>very malty aroma .<ssssss>aroma be alright , not a big fan of the candied fruit note .<ssssss>the taste be of caramel , honey , and toffee .<ssssss>load of sweet malt upfront .<ssssss>some brown sugar , wood , toast pumpernickle and seasame .<ssssss>some vanilla from the barrel aged part of the brew as well as some bourbon soak cherry .<ssssss>load of different flavor go on , perhaps a bit too much as it be hard to focus .<ssssss>the beer be well body with prickly carbonation .<ssssss>it be big and malty so it be a bit sticky .<ssssss>this be all malt on the palate .<ssssss>one big beer for sure .<ssssss>the flavor be great and new one seem to pop up as you drink .<ssssss>that say it be a bit heavy handed on the various flavor and the abv be enough to take down a hippo so the drinkability be limit .<ssssss>nice beer .<ssssss>
8 7 7 4 6		with all these wonderful review i decide to pull the trigger and purchase this against my best judgement .<ssssss>look : black and totally opaque with red light trace pass through .<ssssss>1/4 inch tan head and ok retention smell : note of cinnamon and pumpkin upfront with note of chocolate in the middle and the backend have a slight sour note taste : the flavor profile of this beer be all the fucking map and not in a good way .<ssssss>it go from a nutmeg , cinnamon front to a chocolate cover pumpkin sourness on the backend and totally off put mouthfeel : medium body and medium carbonation overall : i have a hard time drinking this nonsense .<ssssss>the flavor be fight each other and do not blend together as well as you think they would .<ssssss>for $ 14.99 this be a totally avoidable beer<ssssss>
7 6 4 6 7		i have this beer at the 99 .<ssssss>it be a amber ale , serve in a frosted glass with little or no head .<ssssss>the hop aroma indicate that the brew have some potential , but its lack of intensity do not raise expectation for this brew that nicely balance some hop character on a malty backbone .<ssssss>of course , balance be not as tricky when the brew 's a bit light and watery .<ssssss>this brew be drinkable , but not worthy of pursuit .<ssssss>
8 7 5 4 5		a - deep amber with nice fat sticky head .<ssssss>good lacing .<ssssss>s - mostly grass and a little citrus .<ssssss>t - wow , i be really disappointed .<ssssss>mostly bitter , not even really hoppy , no malt to speak of , just bitter water .<ssssss>m - not much positive here either , and the taste be hard to separate from the feel .<ssssss>d - maybe i get a bad bottle .<ssssss>it just be not very good .<ssssss>i toss it after about 1/3 .<ssssss>if it come around again , i might try it just to see if this be a fluke .<ssssss>
7 6 8 6 6		a new arrival here in oregon , and apparently it do not have much in the way of distribution in the rest of the world , either .<ssssss>pour from the green 12oz bottle into a pint glass .<ssssss>body be a mellow golden color , top by a small , creamy white head that instantly dissipate into a thin ring .<ssssss>a mild skunky aroma emerge as soon as the cap be pop , but mellow into a slightly sweet , biscuity malt .<ssssss>palate be a subtly sweet malt base , with a very mild bitterness that i think may actually be come from husk in the grist , rather than hop .<ssssss>finish be nice and clean .<ssssss>body be smooth and slightly creamy , which be pleasant and very much in character for the style .<ssssss>still , while refreshing , this be not a particularly tasty beer .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		purchase this goose island oatmeal stout as gomer 's in lee 's summit , missouri .<ssssss>i pour it into the goblet i reserve for belgian tripel as per the bottle 's instruction , perhaps to focus the aromatic .<ssssss>it pour a one finger head whch dissipate quickly .<ssssss>there be no light come through this beer-dark , dark , dark .<ssssss>as dark as the new black labeling and six pack holder .<ssssss>the smell be intriguing .<ssssss>there be a lot of cocoa in the nose , although they do not use cocoa powder like young 's chocolate stout .<ssssss>there be some sweetness as well , almost burnt caramel like .<ssssss>some earth in there .<ssssss>and some smoke , almost cinder there on the edge .<ssssss>the taste start very dry .<ssssss>only on the swallow do the musty , espresso-ish flavor dart through .<ssssss>there be earthy flavor in here , too .<ssssss>a little chewy .<ssssss>the sweetness on the nose be not in the taste , which , in my opinion , be a good thing .<ssssss>i do not care much for sweet stout .<ssssss>there be some bitterness at the end , but not scathing .<ssssss>perhaps not as complex as some big name stout -lrb- i have not yet have the bourbon couty stout -rrb- , but a good one .<ssssss>the mouthfeel could be thicker ; it run a little narrow for a big play stout .<ssssss>be not the oatmeal suppose to add body ?<ssssss>i still think goose island 's ipa be one the best on the market , clearly the brewery 's best standard session beer .<ssssss>but , due to the lack of bitterness and the lighter body , this stout be sessionable , as well , esepcially in the cold winter month .<ssssss>
8 8 5 7 7		a-pours a pitch black with some yeast floaty in suspension and a two and a half finger light brown sugar head .<ssssss>s-smell of fruity yeast and some dark chocolate with a bit of earthy hop .<ssssss>t-bitter chocolate upfront with some bitter coffee note and maybe a hint of spice on the finish .<ssssss>m-a little thin for my taste for a porter with a crispness and low to medium carbonation .<ssssss>d-pretty nice and complex but the body be a little lack in my opinion .<ssssss>
8 7 4 8 9		this beer be a great adaptation of a truely classic style .<ssssss>there be no suprise serve up by this beer .<ssssss>appearance be the stereotypical golden color that beer be know for .<ssssss>it pour a nice head that dissipate rather quickly .<ssssss>nothing be outdo here , balance of the czech saaz hop be evident with the aroma and crisp taste .<ssssss>a very drinkable session beer , which deserve respect for be a great summer beer that stay true to its root .<ssssss>can not ask for much more from a beer , cause this one be as loyal as a dog .<ssssss>
8 7 4 7 6		pour a bright transparent gold with about a two finger frothy white head that dissolve into a thin lacing at the top of the glass .<ssssss>nose be definitely full of citrusy cascade hop with a touch of caramel and slightly toast malt in the background .<ssssss>flavor be citrusy ; grapefruit and especially the lime leaf dominate .<ssssss>however , despite the citric flavor there be very little bitterness and a earthy finish .<ssssss>this be definitely a flavorful beer , but the feel in my mouth and stomach be pretty similar to that of you bmc lager .<ssssss>thin , watery , and generally just empty feeling .<ssssss>i be aware that the style be not suppose to be full-bodied , but i be expect and hope for something a little more than this .<ssssss>overall i would call this one very average .<ssssss>it be what it be , which be a light , refreshing summer beer .<ssssss>still , you can easily get similar , but better beer .<ssssss>
8 5 8 8 7		i drink this from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass .<ssssss>the beer pour a medium orange with a white head .<ssssss>the head be nice and soapy , a nice cover at the end and good clingy lacing .<ssssss>the aroma be super light citrus hop mixture that doee not really bring a whole lot to the plate .<ssssss>the taste be also super light citrus to start .<ssssss>the middle and end be both pretty dead but at the end , almost two seconds later you get hit with a huge infusion of bitter hop .<ssssss>its a nice delay reaction .<ssssss>
9 5 8 6 7		12 oz bottle with bottled on date .<ssssss>pour a clear golden color with a big fluffy head that mound over the top of the tulip pint .<ssssss>bubble both large and tiny make up a solid , rocky head .<ssssss>aroma be a good balance of ale fruitiness and hop .<ssssss>cascade hop clearly detectable , combine with the fruity yeast character to make a slight citrus and pine needle of the hop .<ssssss>but i like my pale ale with a lot more floral and hoppy character than this .<ssssss>after the head subside , the aroma really miss the fresh hop character that i crave , after be bottle only 3 month ago .<ssssss>balanced malt and hop flavor with a solid bitterness in the back .<ssssss>the hop flavor be there ... .<ssssss>if you look for it .<ssssss>once again , it lack the flowery fresh hop flavor i look for in a pale ale .<ssssss>mouthfeel be nice and dry , easy drinking but with a good bitter bite .<ssssss>drinkable beer , but it lack the juicy hop goodness that make I crave another .<ssssss>this be a good addition to a great mixed pack , but i would not seek out to buy this again .<ssssss>too much competition in the pale ale category to get this one .<ssssss>

9 6 6 3 3		after look at the other review i might have have a bad bottle , but , a big soft white head with tight bubble , very clear yellow beer with a macro brew coloring .<ssssss>little nose , vegitation , lemon soap bitter in a bad way , sour , lemon rind , tannin perfect carbination , thinner than expect mouth feel i reluctantly finish this expensive bottle .<ssssss>i have high hope this would be something like a belgian `` meantime '' very disapoint .<ssssss>
7 5 6 7 5		24 oz .<ssssss>can pour into a mug .<ssssss>i pay $ 2 for the can .<ssssss>woo !<ssssss>appearance : a vigorous pour produce a big , fluffy , 3-finger head of bone-white foam which die down over time to a cap of white and leave occasional spot of lacing .<ssssss>the body be a familiar straw golden color with evident carbonation bubble rise to the top of the glass .<ssssss>do not look half bad for a macro lager .<ssssss>smell : about normal for a beer of this type .<ssssss>earthy corn husk blend with a little bit of fruity sweetness from the malt and some very subtle earthy hop .<ssssss>this beer have a little more power behind the smell than most other adjunct lager i have try and be a little cleaner overall .<ssssss>pretty average `` beer smell , '' but this one have a bit more presence .<ssssss>there be still this weird metallic funk linger in the background , though .<ssssss>taste : clean , refreshing sweetness from the corn and hint of malt be what come out at first , and this be balance by a very clean and earthy bite of hop in the finish .<ssssss>not too bad , overall .<ssssss>i be actually kind of impressed by this beer .<ssssss>fairly balanced overall , and a little more robust in flavor than many of the other run-of-the-mill macro , especially light beer .<ssssss>very easy to drink , although it get a little harder as the beer warm and more sweetness emerge .<ssssss>virtually no aftertaste , very clean and dry .<ssssss>mouthfeel : again , very clean and crisp .<ssssss>this beer lend itself to be refreshing .<ssssss>there be virtually nothing in the finish as far as flavor go .<ssssss>the body be not too thin or watery and be much less carbonated than other big name lager out there .<ssssss>nothing to write home about , but nothing bad either .<ssssss>pretty standard across the board .<ssssss>drinkability : i could see this as a go-to for cheap beer .<ssssss>certainly not something i would want to drink on a regular basis , but for what it be , it be not bad .<ssssss>this will become one of my `` fall back '' beer besides pbr .<ssssss>refreshing , crisp , and dirt cheap .<ssssss>sound like a plan to I .<ssssss>probably one of the best bet if you absolutely have to pick a beer from the `` big three .

8 4 6 5 6		let I start by say , i be not a pale ale fan to start with .<ssssss>appearance : very slightly reddish yellow .<ssssss>pour with a heavy thick head , which i should add now to watch out when open the can , head subside to a nice cover and continue to cling to the glass all the way down .<ssssss>smell : very bland and lifeless , it barly even smell like beer .<ssssss>taste : again very simple and lackng in my opinion .<ssssss>dont get it wrong it be a smooth creamy beer , but that be it .<ssssss>not something that i would drink on a regular basis , or ever again .<ssssss>just not my glass of beer i guess .<ssssss>
6 9 7 7 7		colour look initially quite light , i would coin the term ` hot brown ' but would settle somehow into the standard , muddy brown appearance .<ssssss>little head .<ssssss>aroma certainly in check - good !<ssssss>a great deal of that distinct baltic chocolaty , tary , brandy like aroma .<ssssss>a light roastness with some alcohol present -lrb- only a little -rrb- .<ssssss>a warm finish but no lasting aftertaste ; no resonance .<ssssss>all the right part but they just do not come together so well - or stay there as long as they should .<ssssss>i could use a little more of everything this beer have .<ssssss>i mean , smell be there - but turn it up !<ssssss>flavour be there - but it leave the mouth too quickly .<ssssss>no depth really , or pronounced roastness , a funny water too maybe ?<ssssss>as it warm it develop a weird cocoa like flavour .<ssssss>this one be not great but still tasty .<ssssss>
9 9 8 10 8		drink from a lager glass serve from a bottle a - clear copper color ; constant stream of carbonation s - wonderful balanced hoppy-malty-sweet aroma t - taste better than it smell - warm alcohol kick precede the balanced hoppy-malty-sweet taste m - one word - wow !<ssssss>d - very drinkable - crisp clean finish i could drink a lot of these , but it be kind of expensive and i would get drunk anyway .<ssssss>amazing beer !<ssssss>i can see why this beer be so highly rate - it be one of my new favorite !<ssssss>
7 10 8 9 8		much thanks hopdog for supply this ... appear a hazy light gold with a small white head that slowly fade into a mild cap and hearty collar .<ssssss>spotty bit of lacing .<ssssss>smell be of oaky vanilla with white zinfandel aroma , mango , peach , poached pear , taste be of the aroma with a nice sweet flavor , vanillin , obvious wine , and brown sugar with a hint of tartness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium-full body , chewy , mildly tart and beautiful .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 5		pour with a big foamy head that be rocky at first , but dissipate quickly .<ssssss>color be straw yellow with a barely noticeable tinge of orange .<ssssss>aroma dominate by corn and adjunct .<ssssss>very little malt perceptible , but a very slight hint of hop seem existent .<ssssss>lot of corn flavor and not much else .<ssssss>a little bitterness help balance it out , but a corny and strong grassy flavor take-over the finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel be the weakest aspect .<ssssss>lot of extra aftertaste and a failure to cleanse the palate leave it miss that crispness that i like in any decent pilsner .<ssssss>drinkability be below average , even for the style .<ssssss>as far as adjunct lager , it be not quite as good as it be local peer in the same category , namely berghoff or point .<ssssss>
8 8 6 9 9		love this one ... tremendous head on this beer ... great color , slightly amber in color , very frothy and hung in there throughout the entire bottle .<ssssss>taste be nice , fruity , with a bit of a almost smoky aftertaste .<ssssss>color be a hazy orange .<ssssss>with % alc at 6.9 , the mouthfeel and apparent alcohol be very well do .<ssssss>do not seem that high , and no solvent-like taste .<ssssss>just a great beer .<ssssss>love it and will go back for more<ssssss>

8 8 9 8 6		dark , clear brown .<ssssss>ok white head that belie sticky coral lace and solid retention .<ssssss>aroma be of maple syrup , hop cone , and brown sugar .<ssssss>well blended balance of nutty , toast malt , maple syrup sweetness and hop spice .<ssssss>on the darker side of ` fest , almost a brown .<ssssss>the sweetness become a bit much for more than one a sit .<ssssss>
8 7 8 5 6		eye : into a chimay goblet : hazy gold in color .<ssssss>head be 1 finger thick , creamy/frothy in appearance .<ssssss>great retention , this head be go nowhere fast , perfect .<ssssss>this be what i would expect from any belgian , rock solid head .<ssssss>lacing do not exist , the head be cohesive , leave none behind on the side of the glass .<ssssss>nose : sweet malt tone , that classic belgian candy type of aroma -lrb- like butterscotch to I -rrb- .<ssssss>spicy and earthy aroma as well , something of a house yeast aroma-definitely belgian .<ssssss>sweet bread aroma , phenolic from the yeast .<ssssss>pretty complex overall .<ssssss>in my opinion nothing stand out , good , but average .<ssssss>tongue : wow , really not that strong on flavor , not at all .<ssssss>everything in the aroma be there , but with much less intensity .<ssssss>spicy phenolic , sweet malt , something metallic , fruitiness as well .<ssssss>bitterness be well round .<ssssss>this just do not do it for I , there be really not that much here , everything fade much too quickly .<ssssss>its not bad , but there should be more in my opinion .<ssssss>mouthfeel and drinkability : medium-light body in the mouth with appropriate level of carbonation .<ssssss>finish be semi-dry .<ssssss>not too hard to drink , but i do not think that i will be purchase this one again , just not worth the money ... do not get I wrong , glad to have try it , but i have have much , much better .<ssssss>just not worth the money in my opinion .<ssssss>
6 7 4 6 7		pour chill into a pint glass , it pour the color of almond -lrb- skin on -rrb- with a thin off-white head that quickly dissipate to a slight edge layer .<ssssss>aroma leave alcohol linger .<ssssss>a bit of roasted malt with a cascade hop smell that leave a bitterness about it .<ssssss>a bit of roasted peanut aroma and oak also come through on the nose -lrb- maybe the alcohol phenol smell actually -rrb- .<ssssss>light flavored really .<ssssss>a bit of toast malt hit my tongue right away along with some bittering , floral hop , and the carbonation really tingle my tongue a bit too much to get more flavor .<ssssss>however , the finish reveal a nice oak and roasted peanut flavor that remind I of be at a baseball game .<ssssss>body be relatively light with a bit too much carbonation for my liking .<ssssss>tingly and a bit watery though .<ssssss>fairly drinkable brew .<ssssss>easy to drink , but just not sure how much you would truly want to drink if you can have something else in the same style .<ssssss>it be nooo troeg 's nut brown , that be for sure .<ssssss>
8 7 8 6 8		a - a very dark brown that would pass for black until hold to a light and some nice ruby hue come out at the edge .<ssssss>the head that form be ever so slightly off white that be kind of splotchy .<ssssss>when give a good swirl , the head really build back up again .<ssssss>s - sweet cocoa be really all i can get out this .<ssssss>it be not really all that aromatic .<ssssss>i also get a little bit of sam adams-ness to it as well .<ssssss>t - sweet cocoa , with a hint of vanilla and nuttiness .<ssssss>this be pretty simple but enjoyable .<ssssss>m - very creamy with a great amount of carbonation .<ssssss>very clean .<ssssss>d - a tasty beverage , but c'mon ... this be not worth $ 14 .<ssssss>it be good and easily drinkable , but so be most beer at 5.5 % abv .<ssssss>

9 5 9 7 8		sample at the bon accord , glasgow pour , surprise surpise , golden with a foamy white head and lovely foam on the glass .<ssssss>quite a gorgeous look beer actually .<ssssss>fairly clean nose with a little fruitiness but not much of anything really .<ssssss>some hop bite at fore follow by a mellow fruitiness with hint of apricot and pear lead to a slightly hoppy finish .<ssssss>very smooth and heavy mouthfeel .<ssssss>a rather drinkable bitter , quite tasty .<ssssss>
8 5 8 8 10		appearance : pour a slightly cloudy copper with a warm golden undertone .<ssssss>head be slightly off-white and short live .<ssssss>the carbonation be active , but fine .<ssssss>leave thick lace on the pint .<ssssss>it be a pretty beer .<ssssss>smell : wha ?<ssssss>despite they spiel about malt , the 7.7 abv -lrb- more on that later -rrb- and what should be a dense , complex brew , there be just not much go on here .<ssssss>i pick up some apple yeast ester , a bit of hop citrus , a hint of sweet bread , but otherwise ... zip .<ssssss>do not get it .<ssssss>taste/mouthfeel : again , surprising .<ssssss>the taste be mildly sweet with a bit of caramel/dark fruit from the malt , but for the most part it taste like a typical west coast amber : balanced , somewhat hoppy , with a dry bitter finish .<ssssss>the 7.7 abv be absolutely invisible , there be no alcohol note anywhere in this brew .<ssssss>the mouthfeel , however , be slightly more smooth and heavy than a `` regular '' ale .<ssssss>drinkability : the lightest , most drinkable 7.7 in history .<ssssss>make you wonder ... the kronic -lrb- do that really have to be censor , guy ? -rrb-<ssssss>be something of a paradox -- it be a simultaniously a success and a failure .<ssssss>they have succeed in make a remarkably mild , middle-of-the-road , high abv amber -- you would swear it be just another pale ale .<ssssss>however , it be just another pale ale ; they have do nothing interesting or novel with all the malt and alcohol .<ssssss>my thinking be that if you be go big , go all the way .<ssssss>nice , but not special .<ssssss>

6 5 8 5 6		a - pour a light straw color .<ssssss>two finger head that seem to stick around .<ssssss>s - smell like sweet corn with a tad of sourness .<ssssss>no hop presence , but nothing too off-putting t - pretty much the same as the smell .<ssssss>sweet corn and relatively grainy .<ssssss>the sourness be there but not terrible m - good carbonation and surprisingly not as thin as i expect .<ssssss>d - easily can put down a sixer o - for what it be it be not bad .<ssssss>crisp and clean with no noticeable off flavor -lrb- other than the faint sourness -rrb- .<ssssss>if you be try to pair this with anything i would stick to basics such as a burger , pizza , hot dog , etc .<ssssss>

6 8 5 6 6		highly carbonated and pour a light brown .<ssssss>have a malty , slightly over-roasted nose with faint flowery hop aroma .<ssssss>start sort of bland burnt malt taste , with some flowery hop taste through the middle and finish with a even union of maltiness even out with bittering hop .<ssssss>this be a ok beer to even out a lunch of cheese and cracker .<ssssss>
4 7 6 5 6		12oz bottle purchase as a mixed 6-pack from jovus in gatineau .<ssssss>pour a pale clear gold with decent head .<ssssss>reasonable malty aroma .<ssssss>flavour be relatively straightforward , though not too bad for what it be .<ssssss>decent earthy maltiness with a light hop profile .<ssssss>not a bad lager .<ssssss>re-rate down a notch after a second bottle that do not impress .<ssssss>

8 7 9 7 7		16 ounce bottle .<ssssss>pour out a dark brown color top with a couple inch of off-white head .<ssssss>the aroma be sweet and somewhat roasty .<ssssss>a little bit of a sour smell in the background .<ssssss>chewy malt flavor .<ssssss>slightly metallic .<ssssss>hop be there , but not too strong .<ssssss>finish spicy and fruity .<ssssss>like the aroma , the flavor have a sourness lurk in the background .<ssssss>thick , chewy mouthfeel .<ssssss>no sign of the nearly 8 % abv .<ssssss>pretty good drinkability .<ssssss>if it be not for the sourness , this would be a excellent dopplebock .<ssssss>
7 5 7 7 6		have this on-tap at maggiano 's in denver .<ssssss>a : nice golden color beer .<ssssss>rocky white head be small , but leave nice lace .<ssssss>s : not much go on .<ssssss>subtle malt sweetness with a hint of grassy hop .<ssssss>t : malt upfront be dry and have a husky character .<ssssss>hop come on the middle with a spicy rather than floral bitterness .<ssssss>there be a hint of grass and metal there as well .<ssssss>finish somewhat dry with a pleasant linger bitterness .<ssssss>m : medium body have the right amount of carbonation .<ssssss>d : a nice beer to pair with food .<ssssss>not interesting enough to be consume by itself .<ssssss>

7 7 7 9 8		golden color with a quickly-fading head .<ssssss>it do leave some nice lacing though .<ssssss>the aroma be pretty balance with some of the citrusy hop come through .<ssssss>this be exactly what i like in a apa .<ssssss>i be not a huge fan of the `` crazy hop '' ; this shoot more for balance and hit it dead-on .<ssssss>we have get a nice malt base with the hop add just the right amount of depth and texture .<ssssss>the crispness wash away some of the less clear flavor , but leave a nice balance on the tongue .<ssssss>currently this be only available in sampler pack , but if they release it individually , i would definitely pick it up again .<ssssss>i could knock back several , no doubt .<ssssss>
9 7 8 7 10		a - a rise tinted clear amber brew with a decent size frothy head that leave a delicate ring of lacing on the glass .<ssssss>s - a touch of heather and other floral aroma .<ssssss>a bit of very faint red fruitiness , likely that classic sam smith yeast aroma .<ssssss>t - a mild floral hop flavor with a bit of faint malt on the finish .<ssssss>aftertaste be a faint floral heather .<ssssss>m - smooth , thick , a bit frothy and refreshing .<ssssss>d - quite good , mild and sessionable with a pleasant flavor , certainly worth a try .<ssssss>there be a good chance i will have this one again .<ssssss>
8 4 7 4 4		pour a opaque almost black with a good , light tan head .<ssssss>lot of smoke in the smell , i be afraid too much .<ssssss>smell like liquid smoke .<ssssss>it pretty much overpower everything except a underlie vinous smell .<ssssss>smoke calm down a bit in the taste , but it be still too strong .<ssssss>now it taste like the manufacture bacon bit instead of liquid smoke though .<ssssss>basically , it taste like fake .<ssssss>and then it get acidic and taste like chew tobacco in the aftertaste and as it warm .<ssssss>
8 8 8 10 8		pour into a liter stein , the hop rod be a nearly opaque near-copper with a large , rocky creamy head .<ssssss>the bouquet be dominate by bitter citrus peel but also have very light note of floral pollen .<ssssss>start big and waxy and finish dry and crisp , though slightly alcoholic .<ssssss>the rye hop rod rye achieve a delicate balance ; it be dry enough to beg for another sip , yet quench enough to make each swallow satisfy .<ssssss>i would recommend this beer with a rare steak , perhaps prime-rib .<ssssss>
7 8 4 4 4		a deep brown brew with medium large bubbled head .<ssssss>beer be a pleasure to the olfactory system with rich spicy floral aroma .<ssssss>proceed from the initial pour be where this beer disappoint .<ssssss>this beer be great for anyone who enjoy the rich taste of licorice baste with copper penny .<ssssss>flavor come at you right and left but only leave you with the same impression that you have just scarf down a giant bag of black licorice .<ssssss>in defense of this brew i never seem to be able to procure the freshest of offering from this brewery in my area .<ssssss>judge from prior review other have have a different experience .<ssssss>but from my history , save you penny and suck back a bag of twizzler while gargle a glass of brown ale with those extra lincon float in it .<ssssss>
8 8 6 7 3		just make a fine home-cooked dinner for my significant other and now that she be off to study , i decide to pull this one out as `` dessert '' pour black with a finger of head that disappear quickly from my 25 oz .<ssssss>snifter .<ssssss>smell be holy-cow-vanilla-and-toffee .<ssssss>this truly be a dessert beer , no other way to describe it .<ssssss>the taste follow closely ... whip cream , toffee , vanilla .<ssssss>medium body with a slight carbonation sting , not really that great for a milk stout .<ssssss>drinkability be where this one fail ... and let I tell you what it really fail .<ssssss>the taste itself be excellent , but after about 4 oz .<ssssss>i honestly do not want any more .<ssssss>i do not know what to do with the rest of the bomber , this one be cloying and annoying .<ssssss>i know what they be aim for and they hit the nail on the head , but that do not make it actually drinkable .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 9		pour a slightly hazy , deep golden with a thin white head .<ssssss>minimal lacing .<ssssss>smell be strong of sweet bread , very wheaty with lemon & yeast .<ssssss>the taste be sweet -- wheat , lemon , light fruit .<ssssss>mouthfeel be crisp , clean .<ssssss>very drinkable pale wheat .<ssssss>this be highly sessionable & go great with pizza .<ssssss>
7 7 5 8 6		share with zoso1967 on 1/24/11 .<ssssss>arcadia 's 2007 vintage -lrb- as it say on the label -rrb- imperial stout pour a medium-dark black with a hint of brown .<ssssss>there be no head from my pour into a 23 oz .<ssssss>snifter , just a light brown film .<ssssss>there be almost no lacing - just small , light dot of foam and a clear , boozy film on the side of the glass .<ssssss>the first smell be very boozy , with heavy sherry and bourbon quality .<ssssss>deeper inspection reveal roasted malt , coffee , and some dark chocolate .<ssssss>this smell like it be oak-aged , but there be no indication of this on the bottle .<ssssss>usually brewery make sure consumer know if they beer be barrel-aged .<ssssss>curious .<ssssss>i definitely do smell some woodnote and vanilla , along with some dark cherry aroma .<ssssss>at time the smell be so boozy that it make I think of household cleaner .<ssssss>the taste be very nutty and roasty .<ssssss>big flavor of bitter coffee emerge with just a touch of chocolate near the end of the sip .<ssssss>the flavor can be quite astringent with hint of sweet booze - bourbon and sherry .<ssssss>the finish be decently bitter with nice dry quality .<ssssss>the mouthfeel from this beer be very light for a imperial stout , to the extent that it be almost absent of body to match the flavor .<ssssss>this lack of body really bring out the bitter and astringent quality too much .<ssssss>i be not a fan of this mf .<ssssss>overall , this be a weird beer .<ssssss>i like the flavor for the most part , but the smell be so odd and the mouthfeel be just plain weak .<ssssss>i will not buy this again , as i can find many better imperial stout at similar , or even better price .<ssssss>
4 8 4 8 5		bottle # 2269 appearance : pour a carbonation free burnt caramel that leave no lace smell : a boozy blend of brown sugar , oak , bourbon , vanilla and a range of dark fruit taste : open with a boozy blend of bourbon soak dry fruit -lrb- raisin and prune -rrb- , cocoa powder , bruise apple , cherry and vanilla that get hotter by mid-palate ; after the swallow , the bourbon element add increase complexity and linger into the finish mouthfeel : thick , viscous and chewy , but flat drinkability : maybe this will improve in a few decade -lrb- per the label -rrb- but right now the flatness and booziness make it hard to enjoy ; i do not think the lack of carbonation from san diego brewery be a trend that have any leg<ssssss>
8 9 8 6 7		thanks to csim for this bottle .<ssssss>i be always intrigue by this style of beer .<ssssss>there be so much room for difference between brewer that it be always a adventure .<ssssss>this brew be no exception .<ssssss>it look great , smell amazing , fall a bit flat in the taste as compare to the smell and be very easy to drink .<ssssss>i would love to try it fresher and see what the difference be .<ssssss>for a winter warmer with some time and shipping under it be belt it be a nice brew .<ssssss>i would definitely buy a 6 pack if it be in my local market .<ssssss>
7 8 5 7 7		pour from a bottle into a brandy snifter , the beer pour with a good deal of foam and lot of bubble .<ssssss>the beer be a rose-tinted copper color , with a quickly settle head that ring in at a very thin film after the huge start .<ssssss>increase carbonation stay present throughout the drinking .<ssssss>very effervescent aroma , with light hint of malt sweetness and tart grape and cherry fruitiness .<ssssss>oily slick in mouth , with wine characteristic .<ssssss>flavor be wine-like , also , but with some note similar to a cider , also .<ssssss>cherry , dark and mild , throughout , with a lambic sourness balance the sweet and tart characteristic .<ssssss>the aftertaste be syrupy slick , with dark cherry and tannin , and a quick and slick finish .<ssssss>more lambic and wine than anything , but overly mild nonetheless .<ssssss>
8 7 9 10 8		wow .<ssssss>this be a interesting beer .<ssssss>it almost remind I of my first saison , but that could just be I .<ssssss>cloudy light orange color with a substantial light head , which disappear in a fashion that remind I of the saison .<ssssss>earthy aroma with slight fruitiness .<ssssss>more earthiness in the flavor , with a sharp tartness and a fruity mouth coating .<ssssss>definite honey overtone , with some slight grape flavor to balance the high alcohol taste .<ssssss>the grape be very subtle though , which i thought be a nice counterpoint , give it a almost wine-like character .<ssssss>overall , a nice sweetness balance with the tart bite and earthiness throughout .<ssssss>it go very well with my dinner of balsamic vinegar peach pork chop .<ssssss>a fine experiment that i hope they keep brewing .<ssssss>the bottle be a bit much for one person though , so i recommend sharing .<ssssss>
8 5 6 7 7		while i have never understand people 's enthusiasm for stella , i must admit it be a very attractive look epl .<ssssss>translucent gold , with a puffy , porous white two-finger head that die down over a period of a few minute to lacing .<ssssss>some bubble dance they way to the surface , but it do not look as ` soda pop ' carbonate as many lager .<ssssss>look at it make I kind of thirsty , even though this be not really a favored style of mine .<ssssss>the smell be typical and hard to detect , but what be there be at least pleasant and not corny - a little bit of citrus , grain , and yeast .<ssssss>the taste be similar , both in profile and intensity .<ssssss>fortunately it also lack off-putting corn/rice flavor .<ssssss>slightly sweet at first , but hop and a faint hint of lemony citrus come in .<ssssss>finish be dry and slightly bitter .<ssssss>watery mouthfeel with high carbonation , but appropriate for the style , and very clean tasting , not to mention crisp/refreshing in the two month of hot weather we get in northern alberta .<ssssss>i must admit i be slightly impressed , but i think it have more to do with lowered expectation than any particular novelty this brew have .<ssssss>actually , it do not really have any novelty .<ssssss>but as a widely-available macro epl , you could do worse .<ssssss>it be certainly comparable to other in its category -lrb- hein , grolsch , etc . -rrb-<ssssss>, if not slightly better .<ssssss>something good to get -lrb- on-tap or can -rrb- if you be at a pub or liquor store with lame selection , but not something i would probably select otherwise .<ssssss>i usually avoid the bottle , as with most import ; not worth the risk of it be skunk .<ssssss>i have have skunk stella before and it be not a pleasant experience .<ssssss>
10 7 10 9 8		a - tall , creamy tan head .<ssssss>body be a hazy dark brown .<ssssss>s - sweetness from barley be most noticable .<ssssss>light detection of ester , but not much .<ssssss>practically no hop presence .<ssssss>t - very mellow compilation of malted sweetness , with accentuate phenol back by alcohol on the finish .<ssssss>very moderate leve of ester be present , but do not comprise or stand out in the palate .<ssssss>very tame bitterness ; faint hop character .<ssssss>m - very welcome cream texture with high carbonation level .<ssssss>warm from abv be evident , but not unwelcomed .<ssssss>d - nothing unexpected , everything expect per style .<ssssss>-- - everything you would want in a belgian strong dark ale , from a small belgian brewery .<ssssss>
7 4 5 3 6		best by dec 6 , 2007 .<ssssss>pour a clear light gold color with a 1 finger head .<ssssss>poor retention , but nice lace .<ssssss>aroma be quite grainy , with a hint of adjunct sweetness .<ssssss>there be a faint aroma of stale hop , but you have really get to dig for it .<ssssss>flavor be rather pathetic .<ssssss>raw cereal grain dominate the flavor , and it show a pretty healthy dose of oxidation/wet cardboard flavor , despite be fresh .<ssssss>hop be nowhere to be find .<ssssss>taste like a slightly heavier version of bud .<ssssss>mouthfeel be light and slick .<ssssss>drinkability be decent at best .<ssssss>overall , pretty pathetic .<ssssss>i would have to say that the best thing about this beer be the moderate amount of lace that stick to the glass ... yeah , that be the best thing about a beer for I too ... do not even bother with this one .<ssssss>
8 6 8 5 6		a - pour clear dark amber with a frothy , lasting head .<ssssss>s - lose some point here .<ssssss>hop mixed with rub alcohol .<ssssss>yes , it be 10.5 % abv but other brew with this power mask it a little better .<ssssss>seem fine on the surface whiff but when tilted for a sip it release a clear alcohol hit .<ssssss>t - big hop punch up front , finish a little bitter/sour with a warming feel that still let some notable alcohol taste sneak through .<ssssss>m - on each sip it start syrupy but swallow thin .<ssssss>d - it would certainly pack a punch if down quick and easy but the notable alcohol note in the smell and finish will slow people down .<ssssss>not something i could drink more than a glass or two of in one sit .<ssssss>update : in fact , when i go back to finish the bottle a hour later i end up with a half a glass that i just be not interested in finish .<ssssss>once it warm up it a little it stick I as more of a mixed vodka cocktail in unmask alcohol content .<ssssss>be not feel it .<ssssss>adjust d from 3.5 to 3 .<ssssss>label `` 2008 release '' and suggest that it be age at 55f or below .<ssssss>i pick it up a month ago but do not see the note and it spend maybe two day in the fridge .<ssssss>i suppose with age at the right temp it would improve .<ssssss>worth a try but i probably would not buy again .<ssssss>i enjoy the regular ab more .<ssssss>double ab seem to ride its admittedly entertaining `` i be a rebel that you really will not like '' claim to a higher rating than it may deserve .<ssssss>note : after review i skim the other review .<ssssss>it seem strange how some people describe this beer as cloudy while other -lrb- like myself -rrb- see it as completely clear .<ssssss>would age or bottle date really make that much of a difference ?<ssssss>
6 8 8 9 4		341 ml bottle pour into a glass mug .<ssssss>pour a light brown with minimal head leave a little lacing .<ssssss>aroma be of fresh pepper with a malt backbone .<ssssss>on tasting , i detect a hint of rye , but peppercorn dominate .<ssssss>i have never have a beer like this one , and the unique flavour be really intriguing .<ssssss>the spicy nature of the peppercorn dominate mouthfeel give a otherwise thin beer some extra dimension .<ssssss>the heat and flavour of the spice linger long after a sip .<ssssss>drinkability be low .<ssssss>although this be a interesting , well round beer , one be enough .<ssssss>i plan on return to this someday , but not right away .<ssssss>
7 8 8 5 6		look pretty .<ssssss>actually , look very much like they blond , with a faster-fading head and more persistent carbonation .<ssssss>clear and light golden straw color .<ssssss>smell , as my note say , `` fake razzy . ''<ssssss>kind of appeal in a capri sun sort of way , but already you know they be not brew with the real deal .<ssssss>-lrb- or be they ?<ssssss>i will be surprised ! -rrb-<ssssss>taste similar , though it do the damndest thing on my palate : raspberry - & gt ; nothing - & gt ; soapy/medicinal bitterness .<ssssss>there be nothing go on mid-palate and the finish just do not taste that good .<ssssss>good mouthfeel though ; again , fine bubble and good carbonation .<ssssss>this one 's not awful , but it be not great either .<ssssss>would be much improve with a more natural , less robitussin raspberry flavor .<ssssss>
8 5 6 4 7		pour from the bottle into a pint glass , beer look like a american macro lager , be a clear golden-straw color with a fizzy white head and million of bubble rise to the top of the glass .<ssssss>the nose be pretty non-descript ; a bit of grainy malt and weak , fade hop - slightly skunky .<ssssss>the taste reveal more of the skunkiness .<ssssss>taste like many generic pale euro lager i have have , skunkiness and all .<ssssss>grainy and one dimensional -lrb- two if you count the skunk -rrb- , i have nothing positive to say about the taste .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be light in body with just a touch of tongue-burning carbonation .<ssssss>overall , a beer that would be easy to drink if you want to but as the flavor stand i be not sure why you would .<ssssss>stick with shiner bock - a much better beer !<ssssss>
9 6 8 8 7		the last of my flyin dog brewery mixed pack .<ssssss>have a very nice head when pore into a mug .<ssssss>also have a real nice red color to the beer .<ssssss>there be not much in the way of smell to this beer , but it make up for it in tast .<ssssss>this beer have just the right amount of hopiness to the tast .<ssssss>i would drink this beer again .<ssssss>
8 9 7 10 9		a : roar to life with copious amount of carbonation and thick , white head .<ssssss>not the best retention , however , and halfway through the drink i be leave with no trace of head or lace .<ssssss>lack of retention be the reason this do not get a 5 .<ssssss>s : fresh pumpkin , sweet malt , spicy clove , nutmeg , cinnamon .<ssssss>many beer smell like pumpkin pie , but this one smell like really good pumpkin pie .<ssssss>t : healthy dose of malt back up by strong spice .<ssssss>ton of clove and other spice here , much moreso than its peer .<ssssss>the pumpkin itself be there but be not the central focus and balance well with everything else .<ssssss>mild boozy warmth as it descend leave the familiar -lrb- and pleasant -rrb- caramel flavor , remind you this be a imperial brew .<ssssss>devious be impressively craft , and top-notch for the style .<ssssss>m : medium-bodied , more carbonation than i normally like , and not creamy enough .<ssssss>but this be all nit-picking : this be a fantastic pumpkin ale !<ssssss>d : great flavor and balance mask this imperial pumpkin 's strength well .<ssssss>i could happily take down this entire bomber and still beg for more .<ssssss>overall , this be a first-rate pumpkin beer .<ssssss>not sure why its average rating here be so low -- this truly be a pinnacle of its style .<ssssss>the only other pumpkin beer on par with devious be the frog 's hollow imperial pumpkin from hoppin frog .<ssssss>i think i slightly prefer that brew to this one , but it be close .<ssssss>really , really close .<ssssss>*** the pumpkin beer hierarchy *** top tier : -lrb- in order , separate only by marginal personal preference -rrb- - frog 's hollow double pumpkin ale by hoppin frog - devious imperial pumpkin by bethlehem brew work 2nd tier : - good gourd by cigar city 3rd tier : -lrb- tie -rrb- - punkin ' by dfh - pumking by southern tier ... and then there be everything else .<ssssss>seek devious out !<ssssss>buy multiple !<ssssss>it be rare that pumpkin beer get this good .<ssssss>
8 7 8 6 8		pretty good pumpkin ale , but like always , i would like to see more of a actual pumpkin presence .<ssssss>aber color and a thick tan head .<ssssss>the nose have some sweet malt , spice and subtle pumpkin .<ssssss>the taste be a little lighter .<ssssss>good spice presence match well with the malt , but where be the pumpkin .<ssssss>medium body go down well .<ssssss>
8 6 5 3 6		i think the beer look nice when it come to the table .<ssssss>golden in color with a slight head .<ssssss>there be very little smell and the taste be extremely boring .<ssssss>it kind of taste like beer flavored water .<ssssss>not enjoyable .<ssssss>sorry guy .<ssssss>excellent brewpub , just a horrible beer .<ssssss>
8 8 6 5 5		accord to the label , riggwelter be a old norse term for a sheep that be on its ' back and can not get up without help , i will get back to that in a moment ... .<ssssss>pour a light , almost clear brown with slight chestnut hue , a hint of cherry hardwood floor gleam .<ssssss>light brown head , thin , cover the surface with large and small bubble , nicely carbonate with lacing .<ssssss>the smell of fresh fig and date predominate , a touch of leather .<ssssss>there be a warm , alcohol taste and mouthfeel , buttery , burnt toffee , i find it harsh .<ssssss>as well , there be a sharp sourness at the roof of the mouth that clobber you tastebud and almost provoke a pucker .<ssssss>the aftertaste be not very pronounced , a short finish .<ssssss>my impression be of a excess amount of malt that throw the brew off balance , so it be unbalanced like the riggwelter that it be name after .<ssssss>the beer be certainly craft this way and likely a good example of the style but i find it unpleasant for the most part so i reflect that in my score .<ssssss>i do not like this nearly as much as the black sheep ale i enjoy recently from the same brewery , usually in good supply at the lcbo .<ssssss>
7 8 7 9 6		pour at about 52 degree into a laser-etched snifter .<ssssss>appearance - nice , appealing foamy head , with classy retention , though not much lacing .<ssssss>a dark obsidian color , let no visible light through .<ssssss>attractive .<ssssss>smell - boozey with definite oats , redolent with malt .<ssssss>some hint of nuttiness and chocolate , and maybe just a hint of coffee .<ssssss>a little bit of underlie earthy hop character .<ssssss>taste - medium body , honestly thinner than i be expect .<ssssss>nice and bready though , the character of the yeast be much more obvious in the taste than in the smell .<ssssss>malt be toasty , hop provide some pleasant bitterness .<ssssss>definite chocolate and nut , with some coffee underneath ; the aroma do not lie .<ssssss>start and end with some light alcohol heat .<ssssss>aftertaste have the barest hint of licorice .<ssssss>mouthfeel - enjoyable mouthfeel , creamy though not heavy , rich without be oppressive .<ssssss>carbonation deteriorate throughout , until there be almost none leave .<ssssss>hop character cause a bitterness to linger along with the alcohol heat after the beer be go .<ssssss>drinkability - this beer have a average drinkability , maybe slightly better .<ssssss>while it be heavier , the taste remain appealing and encouraging throughout the course of a pint-six bottle , though if you drink it too slowly the carbonation will die before you can kill the volume in you glass .<ssssss>
6 5 8 6 7		purchase from the class six on post .<ssssss>this be the last of the sixer .<ssssss>i have have other shiner brew and see some good offering from the place , though a beer snob might give they a thumb down .<ssssss>pour a light straw with a finger of very white head .<ssssss>low retention , some lacing .<ssssss>moderately active carbonation , very good clarity .<ssssss>look like a miller or equivalent .<ssssss>nose have corn grits , some hay , and a light hop presence .<ssssss>very light .<ssssss>taste of grain , but not malty .<ssssss>light hop presence .<ssssss>good mouthfeel due to pretty active carbonation , and remain so even three minute after open and pour .<ssssss>dry finish .<ssssss>this beer would appeal to the macro adjunct lager crowd .<ssssss>it be get a little more character than a miller and i think i would choose it over the big three in a blind taste test ; lord know it hold up better because it be not gross at just below cellar temp , which be in its favor .<ssssss>however , if you - tell - I this be a macro adjunct lager , i would probably believe you , because there be not a lot here that be different .<ssssss>i be appreciate it more because it be over a hundred degree out .<ssssss>
7 9 10 8 8		2006 bottle .<ssssss>pour : 33cl bottle to wide mouth wine glass .<ssssss>vibrant orange/red body cap by half finger of white head that deplete almost instantly to a halo and just a smattering of lace , as if it be a race from the center of the glass to the wall .<ssssss>lot of bubble come up throughout the beer .<ssssss>nose : instant lemon and honey as soon as bottle be decapp .<ssssss>maple syrup and something sour , like old sock .<ssssss>ton of fruit , apple and dry apricot , sour cherry and grape .<ssssss>all malt , basically , and some gentle prodding alcohol .<ssssss>some horse blanket note .<ssssss>it be as if the more i sniff , the deeper the array of character for I to choose from ... while at the same time the aroma be actually quite faint .<ssssss>mouth watering nonetheless .<ssssss>mouth : extremely sweet , caramel and maple syrup .<ssssss>tingly mouthfeel all the way through , even tickle the back of my throat .<ssssss>sweet but not cloying , warm but not a alcoholic mess .<ssssss>the after taste be more a feeling than a flavor , like put tiger balm on my tongue , extremely unique and appealing .<ssssss>fruit note be rampant , with none of the tart character of the aroma .<ssssss>also quite chocolaty , more caramel , and alcohol come out a bit .<ssssss>drinkability be as good as could be expect for a young 14 % beer .<ssssss>great beer , will be get several to stow away .<ssssss>interesting because i drink two extremely different dopple bock earlier in the day ...<ssssss>
8 4 7 8 7		ive have orval quite a few time but never get around to write a review until now .<ssssss>this bottle be a '06 purchase from juilus meinl in vienna .<ssssss>appearance be light brown with a slight golden hue top by a gob of white fluffiness .<ssssss>upon pour it be a bit murky but yet transparent .<ssssss>however , all cloudiness quickly dissipate away .<ssssss>scent be soft and sour .<ssssss>i detect some graininess to the smell as well ... the smell be not a high point of this beer .<ssssss>taste be pleasant .<ssssss>a mixture of sour fruit flavor accent with a slight hoppiness .<ssssss>beer be well carbonated and the carbonation may be hide the depth of the hop favor .<ssssss>malt background be equally slight .<ssssss>this be not a taste monster but rather refreshing .<ssssss>
6 8 8 7 2		1790 root beer brew .<ssssss>authentic recipe no 4 .<ssssss>best enjoy before october 2006 .<ssssss>cloudy , reddish color brew with coppery amber hue around the edge .<ssssss>large carbonation bubble produce a worthy white lacing , but it do not last more than a minute or two and leave some wispy foam in its place .<ssssss>massive minty nose , with soft sassafras , vanilla , a wet and earthy root character , and gingery suggestion .<ssssss>very spicy .<ssssss>tangy .<ssssss>medium body , with a smooth and even consistency .<ssssss>quick flash of uplifting carbonation scrub the palate .<ssssss>the beer hit very spicy with crack black pepper all over the place , almost gingery at time .<ssssss>rich and robust molasses tanginess and deep sweetness blend well with delicious note of licorice and a almost hide and deeply embedded vanilla , while a raw and intensely herbal sassafras dominate - we be talk a extreme sassafras presence !<ssssss>wet root or green twig note flavor .<ssssss>touch of sourness and some lemon-like character , blended with the sweetness , bring to mind asian sweet-n-sour-style sauce .<ssssss>suggestion of fresh , wet tobacco .<ssssss>big fresh minty leafy character stick into the finish and linger long .<ssssss>raw floral honey note pull through as the beer warm .<ssssss>and once the wintergreen stick to the palate , it do not let go ... allow you to enjoy its property for quite sometime .<ssssss>finish be a bit rough and raw .<ssssss>the most complex and intriguing beer out of the brewer patriot collection 4-pack .<ssssss>the experience be intense , but truly bring you sense and mind back to another era of elixir enjoyment .<ssssss>that say , it be not a easy brew to get down you neck , but this could be quite fun to cook with .<ssssss>
8 4 8 5 6		random bottle from the mini-fridge of plenty .<ssssss>no idea on age , but the label still look sound .<ssssss>fly monkeys/golden cap -lrb- hat -rrb- , wizard of oz theme .<ssssss>i like it .<ssssss>: d a slow gusher .<ssssss>pour into my rare vo tumbler that i have grow quite fond of recently .<ssssss>a hazy , lemon theraflu-colored body .<ssssss>a couple inch of cake-y , whitewash head that recede pretty quickly .<ssssss>i do pretty well keep all the floaty in the bottle this time , so a minute later , it settle out enough to grant itself another .5 in appearance .<ssssss>smell be big upfront with yeast & pepper .<ssssss>doughy , with a soapy , lemon scent that be just a bit too much .<ssssss>play-doh & rub alcohol on the backend .<ssssss>taste be a quick , sharp hit of tin & malt , then major coriander & spend chew gum .<ssssss>toasty .<ssssss>end trail off with bitter spinach , a little salt , & a lot of yeast .<ssssss>not in the right proportion .<ssssss>carbonation be right in the middle .<ssssss>body be a little dusty & pretty thin .<ssssss>refreshing .<ssssss>it be not great , but it come in a six pack .<ssssss>: p<ssssss>
6 4 4 4 10		ok , i have get to give it to this beer .<ssssss>it have its place .<ssssss>most people who look at review like this do not like this beer , or at least do not admit they like this beer .<ssssss>this beer be make for heavy consumption .<ssssss>you can drink it literally all day , such as a trip to the beach with you old college buddy .<ssssss>no reason to talk about the way it taste , if you be read this , you have have it .<ssssss>just remember , you can say what you want , but i bet you will have it again .<ssssss>not a bad beer .<ssssss>it could be coor light , bud light , etc .<ssssss>it be the best of all those like it .<ssssss>
7 7 9 7 8		a : pour a thin , off-white head that leave little lacing .<ssssss>bronze/brown body .<ssssss>s : nose of caramel malt with a touch of fruitiness .<ssssss>-lrb- apricot ?<ssssss>grape ? -rrb-<ssssss>t : plenty of caramel malt on the tongue , with enough hop to give a nice balance - plus a nice dose of fruit from the nose .<ssssss>m : medium body .<ssssss>medium carbonation .<ssssss>last dry and tart finish with a touch of chocolate too .<ssssss>d : fall quickly .<ssssss>definitely worth a try , but it be not really special in any way -lrb- as oppose to the girl who recommend it -rrb- .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 9		pour from the 330ml bottle into a duvel tulip glass .<ssssss>body be a hazy orange with yellow highlight , top by half a finger of creamy white head .<ssssss>sweet aroma of bready malt and a good dose of spice -lrb- clove , allspice , pepper -rrb- .<ssssss>palate be mildly sweet up front , full of bready malt and more aromatic spice .<ssssss>the hop come through on the swallow , provide a light bitterness that help offset the sweetness just enough .<ssssss>the finish be quite heavy on a white pepper flavor , but be still pleasant , and leave a linger bitterness from the subdue hop profile .<ssssss>body be light and airy , yet not foamy - it be just perfect to convey the myriad flavor hold within the beer .<ssssss>even though this be bill as a 10 % winter ale , it go down very easily , and be a pleasant change from the usual slate of dark , over-spiced holiday ale .<ssssss>
9 4 7 8 7		11.2 oz bottle appear cloudy , dark brown with reddish tint and a thick and monstrous tan head that delay the pour .<ssssss>good retention and lacing .<ssssss>smell like mold and aged cheese , some compost and bready malt .<ssssss>taste like dark fruit and sweet malt at first .<ssssss>it be very sweet throughout .<ssssss>the fruitiness fade away to reveal caramel , toffee , wood , and a touch of chocolate .<ssssss>a little bit of cognac in the end but the initial sweetness never go away , cause a linger dry finish .<ssssss>medium-light body with low carbonation .<ssssss>i find it taste much better than it smell .<ssssss>interesting but not something i would seek out .<ssssss>
8 9 10 8 8		my 100th review !<ssssss>i be hope to make it something very special , like a abyss that i have be impatiently hold onto , but i think this will suffice just fine .<ssssss>pour from a 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle into a stone straight-sided pint glass .<ssssss>appearance : pour a very pleasant honey-amber color that turn very yellow when hold up to the light .<ssssss>a vigorous pour produce a two-finger creamy head that leave a intermediate amount of lacing on the glass .<ssssss>it be very hazy , as well , which be what i like in my ipa 's .<ssssss>smell : stone ipa have a fantastically refreshing and zesty hop aroma to it .<ssssss>fruit , and in particular grapefruit , be dominant motif in the scent .<ssssss>it almost smell like the hop be crust with sugar in this one .<ssssss>this be probably one of the most luxurious fruity-smelling ipa 's that i have come across to date .<ssssss>taste : the taste stick very strongly to the hoppy grapefruit theme .<ssssss>at this point in the review , i be notice that this brew be about 2 week past it be best by date , which could explain why the hop be a bit subdue .<ssssss>it might be unfair to review a older example like this , but the beer be still damn good .<ssssss>it be sort of like bite into a grapefruit , if the grapefruit provide you with a pleasant hop bitterness towards the end .<ssssss>the sweet malt act to balance the hop nicely , as well .<ssssss>mouthfeel : this , for I , be the ideal ipa in term of mouthfeel .<ssssss>it be thicker like a dipa but still retain a adequate amount of carbonation .<ssssss>if it be fresher i would imagine it would be a bit crisper , so i will give it the benefit of the doubt in that category .<ssssss>drinkability : this be a nicely drinkable ipa and at 6.9 % abv be fairly low in alcohol .<ssssss>it be not go to bruise you palate with the hop -lrb- like ruination might -rrb- , so it would be nice to enjoy a couple of these .<ssssss>overall , this be a really nice example of the style and i would love to get my hand on a fresher version because this be a very hop-forward beer .<ssssss>it be not a hugely complex ipa but it be very well put-together and be something i would definitely drink again often .<ssssss>
8 7 8 6 5		a - very nice musty gold when pour .<ssssss>snappy head with big bubble .<ssssss>not overly pasteurize .<ssssss>s - the smell from the mist of the bottle be crisp and fresh .<ssssss>after pour it be fruity and hoppy .<ssssss>i think this tend to be a big difference between american make belgian and the real deal ... way more ipa hoppiness in ameri-brew .<ssssss>t - as expect from the smell this beer yield a very hoppy taste right away that really overwhelm the fruit and sweet malt .<ssssss>m - like a combo between a belgian and a ipa .<ssssss>just a little tangy after a smooth sip .<ssssss>best part of the beer .<ssssss>d - not really .<ssssss>i would rather drink other over-priced beer !<ssssss>
7 5 9 8 9		on tap at the austral , in rundle st adelaide .<ssssss>i ask for a pint -lrb- 568ml -rrb- at this pub , but be serve a schooner -lrb- 425ml -rrb- and when i ask again , i be tell that i have be give a pint .<ssssss>the first time this happen , the other night , i do not bother to clarify .<ssssss>i have never see a schooner glass be call a pint before , anywhere in my travels .<ssssss>weird .<ssssss>anyway the beer be good .<ssssss>appearance : warm , dark oud bruin colour .<ssssss>dark chestnut with a hint of warm red/orange at the bottom of the glass .<ssssss>cloudy , not very effervescent , with a very thin head and lacing everywhere .<ssssss>lace be non-sticky , more bubbly .<ssssss>towards the end of the beer , a few yeast particle could be see near the bottom of the glass .<ssssss>smell : very faint smell , consistent with the sytle .<ssssss>hint of nut , maybe hay .<ssssss>pleasant but faint - would be amplify if serve in a snifter , a few degree warmer .<ssssss>taste : warm , real ale-like , refreshing .<ssssss>unusual hoppy bitterness on the palate .<ssssss>nice and complex : grassy yet grainy - full oat or rye flavour .<ssssss>very satisfying - much like you would imagine a refreshing , quaffable dark ale would taste .<ssssss>mouthfeel : nice and full .<ssssss>not too fizzy but not flat : go down real easy but can be savour .<ssssss>drinkability : veyr drinkable .<ssssss>cheap here in south australia , and you could have one after the other all night .<ssssss>they be , however , pretty fill .<ssssss>a good ale ; one of my long-term favourite .<ssssss>
8 7 8 5 6		look the part with its clear , bright golder shimmer , tight , sticky white foam , and rapid , fine-bubbled carbonation .<ssssss>smell of seed bread -lrb- or sesame seed bagel -rrb- and lemongrass .<ssssss>pang of country water mineral lurk below .<ssssss>begin with that notion of of lightly toasty sesame seed , then move into a grainier breadiness .<ssssss>trace of honeyed sweetness , at time suggest corn though that be certainly not present .<ssssss>a harsh minerality precede a vegetal bitterness , which eventually give way to lemon-rind and herbal hop .<ssssss>it get better as it sit awhile , but remain pretty disorganized .<ssssss>somewhat akin to a lager from another european country , but as a german entry , it lack the typical helle finesse .<ssssss>it have all the trait of a decent one except one .<ssssss>taste .<ssssss>
6 8 10 9 8		a : a new penny copper , with about a finger high head of white ... retention be poor , recede quickly to a little lip of lace ring around the glass .<ssssss>s : hop make up the nose with a very light malt backbone .<ssssss>rather floral , pine , herbal .<ssssss>t + m : quite a piney hop flavour , with a body provide a perfect feel for the taste .<ssssss>the quick bittering build and open out over the tongue , become quite pungent before calming and finish with on a nice note .<ssssss>just the tiniest balance of maltiness come through , just about right .<ssssss>d : a bigger one , though the alcohol heat be not noticable on my palate .<ssssss>a nice hop-fix for a quiet evening - or maybe a good choice for be a little more rowdy !<ssssss>
8 8 5 8 8		coffee + stout = i be in !<ssssss>a : this beer pour a opaque black with a small khaki color head .<ssssss>the lacing be acceptable for the style .<ssssss>the blackness give this beer a pretty grim look .<ssssss>the saliva like head make I this this one have maybe more than adequate carbonation .<ssssss>s : roasted espresso grounds as nothing match the aroma of fresh coffee , but then again this be a beer we have on we hand .<ssssss>there be some sweetness behind the espresso , a little chocolate .<ssssss>t : the taste be of you guess it , espresso grounds , it be not overpower but certainly would be too much for someone who would not label themselves a coffee aficionado .<ssssss>after the initial espresso the chocolate sweetness i pick up in the nose ; however , it seem to expand itself a little more on the tongue .<ssssss>the `` milk '' component of the beer do not make itself a little too sweet for I .<ssssss>the finish have the quality of roasted malt with a bit of linger espresso acidity .<ssssss>i be not impress with this beer initially with it be assertive coffee dominance , but the roasted aftertaste make it worth it .<ssssss>the finish of a bad coffee beer can be rather acrid .<ssssss>the distracting part of this brew be the sweetness .<ssssss>m : this be this beer biggest downfall .<ssssss>the carbonation come on a little too strong and there should be double the viscosity .<ssssss>perhaps i be be a bit too harsh here , but not impressed .<ssssss>d : excellent drinkability as i love coffee .<ssssss>taste be great and the sweetness that come with the roasted espresso give it more depth , but do not confuse that with complex .<ssssss>
8 9 7 7 7		belk 's esb a 6er cost I $ 12 !<ssssss>!<ssssss>!<ssssss>appearance - cloudy orange with a thick head .<ssssss>smell - caramel / molasses malt .<ssssss>slight nutty hop aroma , very faint though .<ssssss>taste - sweet caramel with a touch of roasted nut hop .<ssssss>mouthfeel - sweet , too sweet .<ssssss>overall - a decent esb unfortunately the sweetness practically ruin it .<ssssss>
6 8 6 5 5		i try this beer at the ebf and be not very impressed , but i decide to give it another try when i see it on tap .<ssssss>hazy , apricot color body with only a thing crown of head that have no lacing or retention to speak of .<ssssss>there be a lot go on this aroma .<ssssss>lemony , a slight punch of hop .<ssssss>cheese , `` horse blanket , '' and all of the musty -lrb- yet positive -rrb- description that brett tend to get .<ssssss>sometimes something can smell pretty good but not taste all that great .<ssssss>it be rare , but i believe allagash confluence fit this description .<ssssss>only the slightest tartness come through at any point .<ssssss>the slight musty flavor , like old cheese , surface and be subsequently strangle by a huge hop profile : huge for a wild ale that be .<ssssss>that be about it .<ssssss>this would probably improve considerably with age , but i do not plan on give it that chance .<ssssss>light , crisp , no puckering .<ssssss>maybe even a little bitter and dry .<ssssss>not something that be terribly drinkable .<ssssss>i love allagash , but this one just do not do it for I .<ssssss>
6 8 7 6 6		not a whole lot of head with this one .<ssssss>the color range from black to dark amber .<ssssss>the aroma be of coffee , chocolate , and maybe alcohol .<ssssss>pretty simple smell but that be what i like about it .<ssssss>taste be similar to the smell .<ssssss>very light body for a stout .<ssssss>not very interesting .<ssssss>i would not really go out of my way to try this again .<ssssss>
7 7 5 6 8		a : pour a murky pale orange color .<ssssss>a large white head form that gently recede and leave a little lace behind .<ssssss>s : malty and peaty aroma with a nice woodiness .<ssssss>some very faint fruitiness as well .<ssssss>t : sweet , toasty malt .<ssssss>a bit musky .<ssssss>a metallic and coper flavor as well .<ssssss>m/d : a light body that be thin and watery .<ssssss>smooth and easy to drink though .<ssssss>i would not have a problem make this a session .<ssssss>just a average bitter in my opinion .<ssssss>it be a plan beer and not complicate .<ssssss>it seem to be lack in body and boldness of flavor that i love in other esb 's though .<ssssss>
8 6 8 9 9		12oz single from party source pour into a pint glass .<ssssss>i just buy this but the etching on the bottle say it be be in the store since jan06 .<ssssss>a : nice 2 finger , off white head .<ssssss>pour lighter than expect ; light orange similiar to a witbier or weizen .<ssssss>s : not get too strong of a smell here , which be kinda puzzling .<ssssss>get just a hind of ... .<ssssss>lime zest ?<ssssss>more of the white part of the zest -lrb- lol -rrb- .<ssssss>t/m : great bitterness , balance out with a doughiness remind I of lightly undercooked cheese bread .<ssssss>get stronger lime than i smell .<ssssss>taste great with a nice dry finish .<ssssss>smooth body with a average viscosity .<ssssss>carbonation feel just right .<ssssss>d : i could easily make this a session beer if i be not a blue collar bum .<ssssss>try a second -lrb- and third -rrb- with tri-tip , coleslaw and potato pancake ... go absolutely amazingly together .<ssssss>
8 8 6 9 8		this be pretty darn yummy .<ssssss>happy that there be a good mexican craft cerveza , and even better that it be in can .<ssssss>this beer pour fairly on the orange side , quite hazy , and get a pretty nice , light tan , frothy head .<ssssss>the smell have floral and grassy hop as its outstanding feature , but there be a sugary note too .<ssssss>the front taste show off a nice balance of bready and full bodied malt against a fresh and green hop flavor , those malt seem grainy and sugary before finish with a fair touch of dryness .<ssssss>something feel a touch off with the body and carbonation , like it turn out a little syrupy for its style .<ssssss>overall , i would like to say i hope i see this can around more often .<ssssss>good mid day and summer beer to have with a simple lunch , like -lrb- in this case -rrb- goat brain taco .<ssssss>
7 6 10 9 10		appearance : dark brown , quarter inch head smell : different smell , expresso and sweet/maybe slightly spoil milk taste : small expresso , big vanilla , sugar , and cream mouthfeel : wow -- very smooth , creamy , thick , heavy , super sweet finish drinkability : i know it be a bit high , but a very sessionable stout ... i could easily have a six and right now this be my new benchmark for this style<ssssss>
6 5 5 6 4		glass : pint glass temp : chill to approx 50 degree medium level copper color .<ssssss>smallish white head with good retention and no lacing .<ssssss>smell of butterey cranberry .<ssssss>malty .<ssssss>more of the same here .<ssssss>cranberry be definitely front and center .<ssssss>almost too sweet .<ssssss>butterey , malty flavor follow .<ssssss>no bite at all .<ssssss>feel weak and -lrb- too -rrb- light .<ssssss>not enough body for the style .<ssssss>if i get this again , i would probably give it away , instead of drink it .<ssssss>
9 6 8 9 8		beer taste while sit at my campsite , pour into clear , hard plastic glass .<ssssss>in appearance its a nice warming brown , with garnet accent , excellent look massive light tan head , that leave good lacing .<ssssss>the aroma i find to be weak , maybe the bottle be too cold ?<ssssss>.<ssssss>what there be consist of malt .<ssssss>.<ssssss>good one .<ssssss>the taste be way better than the aroma , a good solid malty doppelbock -lrb- kinda redundant , i know ! -rrb-<ssssss>, slight medicinal taste , then very good alcohol wrming all the way down to my belly .<ssssss>nice and smooth on the palate , despite the noticable alcohol .<ssssss>very nice drinkable and warm campfire beer .<ssssss>.<ssssss>wish i have more .<ssssss>
4 4 4 3 6		one of the classic american macro lager .<ssssss>i be review it for the sake of completeness .<ssssss>a : as stone brewing company would say : fizzy yellow beer .<ssssss>it do not look particularly bad , but it be just not all that impressive either .<ssssss>head dissipate quickly .<ssssss>s : almost none to speak of .<ssssss>t : again , almost none to speak of .<ssssss>there be a very slight sweet taste of some kind of grain , but otherwise , it taste like carbonation .<ssssss>m : very light and carbonated .<ssssss>have virtually no presence in the mouth .<ssssss>d : well , it do go down easily , and it be not strong on the palette , so you can drink a lot of it .<ssssss>it be not the worst macro lager , but i would never buy this beer on my own initiative , and would not drink it unless there be a very good reason .<ssssss>it be very bland and inoffensive , make to appeal to every beer drinker in the world .<ssssss>
9 5 6 4 7		this be a delicate style that a brewer either nail ... or absolutely fail at .<ssssss>in the case of goesser , i would say that they fail .<ssssss>grolsch and carlsberg manage to put they own little spin on the euro-lager style , add that extra edge that make they wonderfully drinkable .<ssssss>and let 's not get start at how the german and czech do lighter beer .<ssssss>so ... what be good about this beer ?<ssssss>well , it be delicate and drinkable .<ssssss>it lack many of the flaw that i see in american macro-lager , while still try to be as close to water as possible .<ssssss>
7 8 10 9 7		intense , over the top , huge , west coast like ipa .<ssssss>im glad i try it , but i wont repeat .<ssssss>at $ 4 plus a single , i cant justify buy this again when compare to similar , and much cheaper beer .<ssssss>appearance : intimidate reddish orange body with plenty of carbonation and a thick beige head that immediately compact to just a skim .<ssssss>aroma : american barley wine like .<ssssss>citrus hop , peppery spice , pine , and vanilla over the faintest caramel .<ssssss>taste/mf : this be a sipper indeed but many great flavor be still prevalent : pine and grapefruit for sure but also mango , cherry jam , marmalade , juniper , tobacco , and more .<ssssss>warmth come in wave , tidal wave , but the carbonation keep the booze from come on to thick .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>drinkability : one be enough for I .<ssssss>
8 9 6 7 7		pour a opaque black color with a nicely lace dark tan head .<ssssss>decent retention .<ssssss>it be darker than i think it would be consider the lower abv , but i dont even get any highlight on the edge .<ssssss>nose be of cocoa and dark chocolate with a surprising amount of dark fruitiness ... raisin , fig and red grape ... but that make a bit more sense as i read the label proclaim it as a belgian stout .<ssssss>light body , roasty cocoa flavor .<ssssss>so roasty that it be almost bittersweet chocolaty , approach coffee-esque .<ssssss>i be enjoy this one better than the fresh bottle i have , it seem the 10 month in the cellar be beneficial .<ssssss>the dark plum-like fruitiness be almost too prevalent and take away a bit from the chocolate .<ssssss>there be some nice bready yeast characteristic here that work nicely and there be just a touch of grassy hop to add to the complex mix of flavor .<ssssss>this beer get better with warming , nearly right up to room temperature .<ssssss>i like it , it be not what you think of upon just the title of the beer though , the chocolate be really just a team player here as many other component be just as noticeable .<ssssss>
8 7 6 4 5		copper color , brilliant clarity .<ssssss>pour a nice white head , tight and creamy and with good retention .<ssssss>initial aroma be somewhat mineraly -lrb- sp ? -rrb-<ssssss>, but ultimately a rich maltiness with a hint of raisin .<ssssss>slight earthy hop aroma ?<ssssss>start with some malty sweetness , but become somewhat sour by the finish .<ssssss>finish with a stale bitterness .<ssssss>taste old and oxidize .<ssssss>mf - light to medium body , fairly light carbonation .<ssssss>no astringency , but some dry on the outside of the tongue , indicative of oxidation .<ssssss>overall - no freshness date on the bottle , but guess the single bottle i pick up at trader jo be not exactly brewery fresh .<ssssss>put a asterisk on this review - give the reputation of the brewery i be sure a quality sample of the beer be significantly better !<ssssss>
9 6 7 8 8		ruby-mahogany body top by a thick finger of slightly tan froth ; lot of lacing and good duration combine with the rich color to provide a excellent presentation .<ssssss>modest nose , provide whiff of citrus and caramel .<ssssss>for a belgian , the smell be underwhelming and disappointing .<ssssss>the taste be better and help atone for the average smell , very fruity , primarily sweet but with a hint of orange rind .<ssssss>it could be more effervescent , but be creamy enough to shore up the mouthfeel .<ssssss>on the whole , pater be pretty decent .<ssssss>i would like to see van eecke ramp up the malt and spice .<ssssss>worth a try .<ssssss>

8 6 6 2 4		unfortunately , i do not notice that this be a `` milk '' stout when i buy a six pack ... i be initially impressed with how well the beer look in my glass with it be head & color .<ssssss>with that in mind i proceed to enjoy errr , stop right there !<ssssss>this be not enjoyable at all !<ssssss>this beer be so sickishly sweet that i could only drink one bottle , although i try on four occassion to drink additional bottle of it , i end up with just a few taste before i have to throw each bottle out .<ssssss>so , this be definitely not a acquire taste !<ssssss>i assume that this type of beer be gear toward those who do not like beer and want the taste mask by gross sweetness .<ssssss>
9 10 9 8 8		older look 750 ml bottle -lrb- fade label with a garden of eden painting -rrb- that pick up on sale and cellare about 6 month .<ssssss>pour into my large gulden draak tulip , it be a good thing because this one would have over foam have i not have my glass in hand , and even with a careful pour , it be 80 % the first go around .<ssssss>dark gold with a fluffy off-white head , it do not take * too * long to settle , but be rocky and leave heavy chunk of foamy lace .<ssssss>awesome .<ssssss>smell be the classic blaugy yeast tropical fruit ester that i love so much i use it as my house strain .<ssssss>not to sweet or thick , passionfruit maybe ?<ssssss>not much from the fig at first , but it come out more as it warm from the ~ 55f serve temp .<ssssss>taste be very similar to they saison , but with just a touch of fig ... .<ssssss>which i honestly could do without , but this be more so because i love they regular saison so much !<ssssss>the fig provide a rich , vinous tang that somewhat overpower the subtle sweetness of the ester .<ssssss>mouthfeel be slick , smooth , light body .<ssssss>drinkability be pretty good , because i love the blaugy yeast so much .<ssssss>the wine note from the fig though , which be what this beer be all about , be my least favorite part , so in the future , i will stick to they saison instead .<ssssss>still a good beer though .<ssssss>
8 10 6 8 7		it be a good beer , but either i have a not-quite-up-to-par sample , or it be a bit too old -lrb- it be bottled 12-2008 and i be drink it 3-2009 -rrb- .<ssssss>i enjoy it , but not a or a + material .<ssssss>a : hazy , light amber color .<ssssss>almost orange .<ssssss>very little head .<ssssss>very fine carbonation .<ssssss>s : amazing .<ssssss>apricot , pineapple , orange , grapefruit , and honey .<ssssss>i almost want to burst out into song with `` these be a few of my favorite thing '' it smell so good .<ssssss>t : not nearly as sweet as it smell , but still not bad at all .<ssssss>balanced bitterness from the hop with fruit flavor from the hop , all of which be pretty balance by the malt , although the malt be lose out here a bit in the battle for flavor dominance .<ssssss>m : relatively thin texture compare to how it look .<ssssss>not very carbonated either .<ssssss>still probably a medium-bodied beer on the whole , and probably thick for a non-imperial ipa .<ssssss>d : highly desirable to consume , but the odd texture -lrb- from relatively thinness of the body combine with the low carbonation -rrb- and the bitterness win out on the balance war , make I knock it down a point or so , even though the flavor and especially scent be good .<ssssss>
7 7 5 8 7		this pale ale pour clear golden with a nice white head .<ssssss>the lace stay on the glass for a long time .<ssssss>the malt aroma be all that i smell .<ssssss>the hop bitterness take over the taste right from the beginning .<ssssss>there be no maltiness or malt sweetness the beer finish dry and the bitterness linger long on the tongue .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be average at best .<ssssss>somewhat watery with no carbonation .<ssssss>if it be summer and hot , it might be thrist quenching but it be february so ... it be a slightly better than average beer and i find it drinkable .<ssssss>it probably would not be a beer i would recommend .<ssssss>
8 8 4 6 8		pour a deep mohogany , just barely allow light through .<ssssss>very minimal head that dissipate quickly , and minimal lacing .<ssssss>smell be sweet malt , chocolate , coffee , and some fruity or grassy hop aroma .<ssssss>taste be a roasted coffee taste , with light hint of chocolate , but very deep and roasted primarily .<ssssss>the feel in the mouth be very thin and watery , with some bubbly carbonation very drinkable because it be very light for a porter , but not one that be entice for drink more than one or two .<ssssss>
5 6 5 7 9		11oz bottle pour into a pint glass .<ssssss>best by date be 2/13/11 .<ssssss>pour a clear , golden yellow with two finger of frothy foam that quickly dissipate .<ssssss>very little carbonation and lacing .<ssssss>nose be slightly more complex and please that the macro lager but still about the same profile .<ssssss>sweet and yeasty malt barley with dull bitter hop undertone .<ssssss>light body and flat .<ssssss>not a lot of flavor but super easy to drink .<ssssss>mildly sweet with roasted malt and just a touch of hop bitterness to make it very clean on the palate .<ssssss>roasted malt come through in the finish .<ssssss>this beer try to be true to style but i feel like they could have make this a lot better .<ssssss>still , if you want a authentic american lager to session that be still tasty and inexpensive without support the giant , well here you go .<ssssss>i will be keep this be the car to await I after a long day of snowboard ^_^<ssssss>

6 8 6 6 5		pour a very opaque and muddy brownish red in color .<ssssss>no head form at all on the pour .<ssssss>you can immediately pick up some fruity tone upon pop the cap .<ssssss>that be where the positive cease .<ssssss>this taste like a fruity alco-pop .<ssssss>very fruity and alcoholic .<ssssss>like a cheap bottle of mad dog 20/20 .<ssssss>medium mouthfeel and a somewhat cloying aspect .<ssssss>i love my boy at founder , but they severly miss with this one .<ssssss>
7 3 4 4 4		12 oz bottled 02/03/09 .<ssssss>orange body , big initial head , moderate longevity .<ssssss>clear , some consistent light bubble .<ssssss>pale malt ?<ssssss>that be the main small of a quote `` serious india pale ale '' ?<ssssss>smell like noble hop a little , kinda musty but no apricot to be find .<ssssss>taste be sour apricot , dramatically underhopp for the style .<ssssss>the apricot taste be nuanced and genuine , tough to pull off and impressive .<ssssss>cover up the hop .<ssssss>a little yeasty .<ssssss>seem sweet initially when it be actually just acid continue to dominate a beer that strike a balance between sweet and dry .<ssssss>faintly bitter hop peek through on the finish .<ssssss>vigorous carbonation , perhaps design to mesh with or mask a light body .<ssssss>finish be prolonged but overly acidic .<ssssss>while i review against a cross of american ipa x fruit beer , a apricot beer can not help but invite comparison with magic hat # 9 ... my $ .02 be that # 9 blow the door off of aprihop .<ssssss>the genuine apricot taste here be nail , no doubt , but be that a good thing ?<ssssss>do i want to keep drink it ?<ssssss>it be sour , a little sweet , not really so good , definitely not so good at $ 9.99 a four pack .<ssssss>at least there be no hint of the 7 % abv .<ssssss>do better .<ssssss>
8 8 4 7 6		originally review on january 18 , 2006 .<ssssss>on cask at brewpub .<ssssss>deep dark murky browm , with a long sustain heavy head of coffee .<ssssss>deep cream and chocolate aroma , with a hint of cherry .<ssssss>thin bodied !<ssssss>majorly dissapointing .<ssssss>body of the beer carry no flavor !<ssssss>watery .<ssssss>creamy chocolate and roasted chicory come through on the aftertaste , but the original impression be week .<ssssss>not high in my book .<ssssss>
8 8 5 6 7		750 share with klym ; pour into stone nonic .<ssssss>a : just pure opaque black ; come off look like a eight ball .<ssssss>absolutely no light get through .<ssssss>this could pass for a stout any day of the week .<ssssss>a lightly off color brown/cream/white film line the top of the glass .<ssssss>speckle and streak of lacing round out the look of this very black coffee look porter .<ssssss>s : black coffee with spice : paprika , cardamom , light nutmeg , and some clove .<ssssss>a sweet roasty characteristic that stick out , this sweet note really reassure I that this be a porter .<ssssss>you would not expect to get that note as much out of a stout , which help contrast the visual .<ssssss>excite for the sip of this stout illusion !<ssssss>light chili-pepper sweet note in the end .<ssssss>t : this really be a coffee porter with spice , it remain consistent with the nose in that some clove/paprika go in the start and then give into the nutmeg and coffee roast .<ssssss>the spiciness really overwhelm the backbone of this beer .<ssssss>this be like have a stake crust -lrb- not garnish , but crust -rrb- in basil .<ssssss>there be just too many condiment on this sandwich ; if it be not for a late appearance of great tasting black coffee , i would have ding this category a bit more .<ssssss>m : there really be a bit too thin of a body here , the flavor be already so sweet and light that to have a redundant mouth make for a suffocating drinking experience .<ssssss>i find myself gasp for air after consecutive sip .<ssssss>a more consolidated body would have really help this brew .<ssssss>light bubble dissipation be apparent , but beyond that it be underwhelming .<ssssss>o : this beer be a bit of a civil war .<ssssss>the visual be really quite promising ; but the taste really battle itself .<ssssss>the spice really dominate the flavor experience to the point to where the backbone of the beer be irrelevant .<ssssss>unfortunately for the beer .<ssssss>there be a really nice flavored beer behind all the fanciness .<ssssss>furthermore , the `` coffiness '' of this beer be really only suggest ; as there be a caffeine-esque flavor sensation to this beer .<ssssss>do not be fool , this be a superficial presentation from a brewery that be capable of much more sincere offering .<ssssss>make this a imperial oatmeal , and i will come rush back .<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 8		aroma : very light biscuit malt with subtle clean lager undertone .<ssssss>perhaps a hint of light caramel or breadcrust , though it be very subtle .<ssssss>no hop aroma .<ssssss>appearance : deep gold with a rich white head that fade quickly to lacing .<ssssss>head hold a thin film at the top of the beer .<ssssss>brilliant clarity .<ssssss>flavor : light bread crust and noble hop flavor be most prominent , though neither be rich or over-powering .<ssssss>hop bitterness ride in at the middle and hold through the finish with some linger bitterness and malt sweetness .<ssssss>mouthfeel : medium body with light carbonation .<ssssss>hop bitterness come off as a dry bite at the roof of the mouth and hit the back of the throat in the finish .<ssssss>nearly sticky malt sweetness combine with the hop crispness in the finish .<ssssss>dry the mouth somewhat , but not astringent .<ssssss>overall : while the beer be somewhat lack in aroma there be a pleasant tie-in between the malt sweetness and noble hop flavor and bitterness .<ssssss>this beer be a bit on the high side for the style , which be why i would expect more from the aroma .<ssssss>though it make for a easily quaffable cool summer evening beer that will not dissapoint .<ssssss>

8 4 7 8 8		review be from note take on 1/15/2010 .<ssssss>pour from the bottle to a pint glass .<ssssss>appearance : pour be a pale straw color and start with a one finger white head that fade to a full and relatively thick skim ; body be very clear and show mild carbonation ; web of lacing here and there on the side of the glass .<ssssss>pretty standard and look like it should .<ssssss>smell : very light in the nose and all i really get be a slight toasty graininess .<ssssss>not impressed .<ssssss>taste : pleasant surprise after a disappointing smell -- nice bitter and citric hop -lrb- orange and lemon peel -rrb- ; the toasty graininess that be present in the nose be also present on the palate and there be also even a hint of a sweet maltiness hiding in the back .<ssssss>mouthfeel : a nice light body with carbonation that be a little stronger than it appear make for a lively , but not overly sharp , mouthfeel ; only a slight stickiness be leave on the roof of the mouth and it finish very clean .<ssssss>i do wish it be just a little thicker , but i be happy enough with it .<ssssss>drinkability : solid , actually .<ssssss>i could probably drink this all day during the warm and humid summer month as it do not weigh heavily on the stomach at all and the body be crisp and refreshing .<ssssss>i dont ' think i would necessarily go out of my way to get it , but if i come across it i may pick up a sixer here or there .<ssssss>
10 7 10 7 8		review 4/26/2009 -lrb- bottle batch number t8249 -rrb- : pour a huge foamy whitish color head , bubble , but diminish somewhat .<ssssss>very floral aroma , dusty .<ssssss>sweet and strong .<ssssss>very perfumy .<ssssss>sickly sweet smell .<ssssss>light soft taste .<ssssss>some carbonation .<ssssss>very floral taste .<ssssss>light fruit , like pear or apple .<ssssss>some malty skunk present too , but very light .<ssssss>pretty tasty .<ssssss>
7 6 5 8 9		i would like to say that i think this be a good beer , but i be still try to nail down what `` appropriate for the style '' actually mean for porter since it seem to be a broadly interpret style .<ssssss>that be say : appearance : very dark , but a few shades down the scale from black - more of a opaque reddish-brown -lrb- the description on the bottle say ruby-mahogony , and i think that sum it up well -rrb- smell : nothing punch you in the face , rather you have to search a little ... dry chocolate , toastiness , hint of coffee , but overall fairly subtle .<ssssss>taste : the word to use again be `` subtle '' , most flavor be inoffensive , but the chocolate characterstic of the roasted malt be definitely present and stand out the most .<ssssss>very lightly hop - just enough to balance the light malty flavor - finish with a distinctly dry chocolate taste and slight aftertaste of coffee .<ssssss>mouthfeel : watery be the first word that come to mind , but creamy be another - so if you want a nice roasted grain beer and a stout seem to heavy , this will work well .<ssssss>drinkability : very easy to drink , definitely could make my way through a few without need a change .<ssssss>this be a great beer to help a novice take a step towards stout-appreciation .<ssssss>i think it be a great beer from jame squire - would love to see they take on a stout some time .<ssssss>a great take on this beer be they seasonal rum rebellion porter - it introduce a more exciting element to the beer to add to all of the `` subtle '' description above .<ssssss>i may be a bit harsh on the mouthfeel score , but i may re-adjust when i find out just what consistency a porter should have .<ssssss>
6 2 6 4 6		pour from a 24 oz bottle into a pint glass serve slightly chill .<ssssss>the beer have a yellow/champagne color with a 3 finger head -lrb- which reduce with no lacing -rrb- on a ginger pour .<ssssss>the beer have a skunky hoppy aroma surround it , and be follow by a first taste of grain and a very little amount of warmth .<ssssss>very carbonated .<ssssss>the beer go down easy , but just have a skunky taste to it and be not very fill .<ssssss>

8 6 9 8 8		base on a 16th century belgian recipe -lrb- hence the `` 1554 -rrb- , this `` enlighten '' beer have a pitch black body beneath a filmy vanilla crown ; there be very little lacing throughout the quaff .<ssssss>the nose pick up a iota of cocoa powder and raisin ; the palate detect bit of dark chocolate with a quick shot of toastiness at the end .<ssssss>while not a overwhelming beer , this do bear the criterion for a pleasant sessional , though i could not establish anything resemble a ipa as this neat little beer be void of any hoppiness .<ssssss>dark , mild and malty would be the three stooge stumble around in the glass with this one .<ssssss>still , i do like it as a mild quaff for any time of the year .<ssssss>

5 4 7 6 7		pour a rusty orange with a thin head that quickly dissipate .<ssssss>strong , bready aroma change to viniferous .<ssssss>taste be green apple sour choke off a bit of sweet malt .<ssssss>mouthfeel be about right for a tripel , and drinkability improve as i get acclimate to it .<ssssss>not interested in another one .<ssssss>
8 5 8 6 5		from 03/27/11 note .<ssssss>share by nimbleprop at a local dc tasting .<ssssss>a - pour a murky mahogany color with less than a inch of head and light carbonation evident .<ssssss>s - smell of nut , coffee , roasted malt .<ssssss>something weird to the smell too that i can not quite place , like off citrus/lemon/herbal note .<ssssss>t - taste of coffee , roasted malt , yeast , lemon , citrus .<ssssss>m - medium body and low carbonation .<ssssss>o - overall a interesting wheatwine , but not one of my favorite .<ssssss>think the different aspect of smell and taste be a little weird and do not really work well together .<ssssss>would not seek it out again .<ssssss>.<ssssss>
8 9 8 10 6		wax top green bottle , something you do not see every day .<ssssss>a - pour a bright and ruby red .<ssssss>initially there be a nice one finger off white head , the head have a nice pink undertone to it .<ssssss>unfortunatly the head never last long , maybe it be my glass .<ssssss>once the head dissapear it look like a glass of rise wine .<ssssss>the beer leave no lacing either .<ssssss>s - the smell be just pure cherry , but not fresh cherry .<ssssss>it smell more like a cherry pie .<ssssss>the smell be more earthy and nutty than fruity and tart .<ssssss>t - the frist thing i notice be the tartness , it almost get to the point where i make a sour face but back off .<ssssss>after the sourness come the delicious cherry flavor , this time more grassy and fruity than the smell .<ssssss>finally the taste shift to a dry oak and buttery taste , this really remind I of a white wine .<ssssss>m - medium body with nice carbonation .<ssssss>the carbonation be nessicary the keep the tartness in line .<ssssss>d - one or two glass be pleanty for I so a whole bottle be too much .<ssssss>the tartness and fruit flavor become too much for my palete .<ssssss>i enjoy this beer when it be cold , like fridge cold , it be fun to taste it as it warm but i find it better cold .<ssssss>also i really regret not pair this beer with some food or cheese .<ssssss>

9 8 7 10 8		this brew really blow I away .<ssssss>pour sort of a off red .<ssssss>the malt flavor be really prominent with some hop bitterness at the end .<ssssss>there be note of coffee and other earthy flavor in the taste .<ssssss>i would not characterize the mouthfeel as be thick but it have some substance to it .<ssssss>great beer , even for a hop addict like I !<ssssss>

6 7 8 10 10		i be very surprised this beer get such low rating .<ssssss>it may be mass produce , and it may not be all that unique , but molson ice be certainly delicious and get you very drunk on the cheap .<ssssss>this be not a craft brew , but for what it be there be not many better beer out there .<ssssss>molson ice manage to be refreshing , tasty , and full of alcoholic goodness , a trifecter of awesomeness .<ssssss>it drink well in hot and cold weather .<ssssss>you can down one after mow you lawn or let it warm you up on a cold winter night .<ssssss>molson ice and i go way back .<ssssss>my taste in beer have certainly become much more eclectic since the day of chug molson ice in my parent 's basement , but i do not think i will ever get sick of this beer .<ssssss>

8 10 9 8 9		southern tier have really impressed I lately , and this beer be no exception .<ssssss>it be a dark , fully black , thick liquid with a dense tan head .<ssssss>really remarkable - exceptional , really - be the aroma .<ssssss>the sweet , dessert-like aroma be unlike almost any other beer .<ssssss>i be afraid that the aroma would be artificial , with too much vanilla , but somehow this strike a wonderful balance between the creamy , malted-milk qualiity of a milk stout and huge proportion of vanilla .<ssssss>it be intense , sense-grabbing , and fantastic .<ssssss>i love it .<ssssss>it be like a chocolate malt , woody-vanilla , and cream pie ... .<ssssss>creme brulee , indeed .<ssssss>some toasty , roasty scent be present as well .<ssssss>it be one of those beer that you get a kick out of just sniff .<ssssss>the flavor be strong , with a firm bitterness that provide some balance .<ssssss>sweet on the lip .<ssssss>thick and intense , but not cloying .<ssssss>huge , hefty body .<ssssss>spectacularly satisfy !<ssssss>
9 6 7 8 9		hmmm , ipa from a can .<ssssss>i think this be go to become a trend : -rrb- a : cloudy orange brown yellow with a weak light tan head -- however the lacing and bubble on top never recede .<ssssss>s : not too much nose actually , the beer have a sweet bready body .<ssssss>almost like a dipa , but much lighter ... the hop be light but pine herbal grass and floral note be hide in there somewhere .<ssssss>t : different flavor , but i really enjoy it -- its rather different .<ssssss>the bitterness be spicy , herbal , citrus and grassy .<ssssss>the malt also have a grassy -- switchgrass perhaps .<ssssss>like i say above , the malt taste like a dipa , but more water down .<ssssss>not much hop bitterness , but it be very enjoyable .<ssssss>m : the mouthfeel be smooth and lightly carbonate .<ssssss>it coat the mouth and tongue and then quickly evaporate .<ssssss>it be really quite nice .<ssssss>d : i will have another ... right now please !<ssssss>
8 8 8 9 6		oily dark brown pour , dark cream head that quickly disappate .<ssssss>roasted malt , mocha aroma , some booze .<ssssss>taste similarly , with some caramel and toffee .<ssssss>slight hop presence .<ssssss>some coffee bitterness in the finish .<ssssss>alcohol peak through with some definete warming .<ssssss>nice balance of carbonation and creaminess .<ssssss>i think i like the 11 slightly better , this be start to push the edge with too many ingredient to properly manage .<ssssss>make no doubt though , this be very good .<ssssss>
10 9 10 8 8		somehow i have miss this brew over the year ... one of the more famous porter and i finally get to try it ... appearance : 5 .<ssssss>terribly black and thick ... deep dark head ... aroma : 4.5 the sheer roastiness of the aroma be almost overwhelming ... dark currant cover in bittersweet chocolate come to mind ... intense , smoky , and powerful ... .<ssssss>the merest hint of booze present but only add to the intrigue ... .<ssssss>taste : 4.0 dark chocolate and something like raisin that have be dip in a chocolate liqueur be the first thing that come to mind .<ssssss>.<ssssss>almost stout-like in its taste and feel ... rich and deep with a slight bitterness on the finish ... feel : one of the most luxurious creamy beer i have ever have ... perfect drink : 4 this be so intense and rich that i be not sure i could have more than a couple ... a thoroughly enjoyable porter that deserve its world-class reputation ...<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 8		a finger of tan head , nice lace .<ssssss>deep , deep brown .<ssssss>extreme bourbon in the nose along with cherry and vanilla .<ssssss>fantastically balance so that every nuance can be appreciate .<ssssss>bourbon , coconut , dryish malt .<ssssss>not too intense , and quite tasty .<ssssss>light , almost fluffy perhaps a result of champagne yeast .<ssssss>quite good , but neither worth the price -lrb- $ 30/750ml -rrb- nor hype .<ssssss>
9 6 9 8 8		into a .4 l glass , pour a clear golden copper with a half inch head of thick foam , not quite as good as luna , but still stick around and leave lot of lacing , very nice .<ssssss>the aroma be just plain weak , but pleasant bit of grainy malt and maybe some hop , though that be when a smoker pull up to I and wreck my nose for the night .<ssssss>taste be pretty decent , a solid malting and sweet backing , perfectly match hop profile .<ssssss>mouth be like the luna , just a wonderful creamy smooth wave with just enough carbonation .<ssssss>very drinkable beer .<ssssss>
8 9 7 7 7		pint bottle pour a clear orange tint mahogany with a short-lived beige head that melt into a slick with ring lacing .<ssssss>aroma be big , powerful malt .<ssssss>heavy dose of molasses and caramel smother the olfactory sens .<ssssss>mouthfeel be thick and smooth , with plenty of carbonation .<ssssss>initial mouthfeel be tart and fruity , but quickly revert to its strong malt character .<ssssss>molasses , caramel , and dark fruit -lrb- fig and date -rrb- be dominant here .<ssssss>hop bitterness become evident early on and continue the rest of the way .<ssssss>aftertaste be somewhat unpleasant by its syrupiness .<ssssss>this be a interesting beer to review and enjoy , but it do not fare well when compare to the better bavarian doppelbock .<ssssss>
8 8 7 9 7		the kilbourn hop ale be bright red and clear .<ssssss>the beer be very crisp and the heavy hop flavor really make it full of character .<ssssss>the hop be kilbourn hop and while they definitely impart a fruity flavor they do not resemble cascade or willamette , at all .<ssssss>the fruit character be almost more like a berry rather than a citrus flavor .<ssssss>it be hop enough to almost be a india pale , but it be definitely just a well hop apa .<ssssss>wonderful brew , worth the discovery .<ssssss>
8 9 7 9 10		i will start by say i love this beer .<ssssss>it be a very easy to find , very good , very drinkable beer .<ssssss>with that say ... smell be very hoppy and citrusy .<ssssss>pour dark golden .<ssssss>a lot of head but i think the bartender be a little aggressive with my beer !<ssssss>it be very crisp tasting .<ssssss>a little bitter .<ssssss>a very good beer .<ssssss>my go to on tap , readily available beer .<ssssss>very drinkable .<ssssss>i could drink these all night .<ssssss>
6 6 7 4 8		a light straw color beer that generate a dense , three finger head , gradually turn to lacing .<ssssss>smell and taste be both water down , background malt .<ssssss>this beer seem more water down than its very weak counterpart , coor light .<ssssss>while not a good tasting beer , it be very refreshing and smooth .<ssssss>when tap the rocky , aim to quench you thirst , rather than taste a good beer .<ssssss>
8 8 5 5 5		it have be a long time since i try tv bryggare frskl .<ssssss>now they be offer a low alcohol version for sale in local supermarket so i decide to give it a go .<ssssss>it pour with a good golden yellow color , smell of fruity herb , much like a vienna lager , toast and citrus .<ssssss>the taste be very bready but unfortunately also a little thin and watery .<ssssss>there be also some sweetness and note of straw .<ssssss>i can imagine this to be a excellent lager if you take out the watery part and increase the abv .<ssssss>
8 7 4 4 6		saw this at the liquor store and find myself in the mood for a dark lager .<ssssss>unfortunately , this be nothing like any of the other german dark lager i have try .<ssssss>it look promise on the pour , and the smell be malty and slightly sweet .<ssssss>unfortunately , the overwhelming flavor be blandness .<ssssss>easy to drink , but very mediocre .<ssssss>i also find the shiner bock to be pretty underwhelming too , so i guess this brand just be not to my taste .<ssssss>it be not bad , but there be really nothing i can reccomend about it either .<ssssss>
5 4 3 4 5		pour from the 16 oz new style can bottle -lrb- order at bkinus beach bar , atlantic city -rrb- : a : pale yellow with a quickly dissipate head s : grain and feeble yeast t : grain water -lrb- no malt at all - so it be like grain steep in water -rrb- m : waterlike and very carbonated d : what .<ssssss>.<ssssss>?<ssssss>?<ssssss>ok !<ssssss>
6 5 6 5 8		i pour this beer , and i be shock at the mass of foam that greet I .<ssssss>it then dissipate to a more reasonable level but have already leave I a little unimpressed from the start .<ssssss>i try my second again the next day , and be equally unimpressed .<ssssss>it present as a very slightly cloud pale gold colour -lrb- so far so good -rrb- , with very little evidence of the unfiltered sediment , even on close inspection .<ssssss>aroma be very low impact , with almost no discernible malt aroma and some low key hint of floral ?<ssssss>hop .<ssssss>i be not quite sure really .<ssssss>it be a tad indistinct .<ssssss>i would just have a cascade first harvest , 2008 previous to my first try , which be far richer and fuller , but even on the second day with the mountain goat pale ale get first go , i could not sense much complexity .<ssssss>to taste ... here , at least the flavour be a little more complex .<ssssss>a little spicey with some floral tone -lrb- weak -rrb- with no yeasty character .<ssssss>little malt character be evident either ... i have to say that in fact i find the beer overall at tad thin .<ssssss>the flavour that be there hint at a good beer , but be too weak and indistinct for I to really follow .<ssssss>it be not , i believe a bad beer , but its lack of complexity and over-carbonation , -lrb- it be a little fizzy as well as produce the ridiculous head -rrb- detract from hint at strength .<ssssss>it be a easy to drink beer , but be not really challenging , or very complex .<ssssss>
8 7 6 9 8		pour a black color with some barely perceptible brown edge , form a exceptionally creamy , 2-finger thick , light-brown colored head that leave a lot of residual lace on the glass as the beer recede .<ssssss>well , definitely some coffee on the nose , make up of a nice roasted malt aroma and a touch of cocoa .<ssssss>almost a burnt caramel-like smell in there as well .<ssssss>i be not sure i have ever have a coffee stout that taste so much like coffee particularly when drink at room temp -lrb- as suggest on the bottle -rrb- .<ssssss>i mean really , that be practically all i taste in this beer be coffee , with maybe a hint of chocolate but definitely a lot of roasted character with a somewhat bitter finish .<ssssss>medium body , with medium carbonation .<ssssss>yep this be a coffee stout , no doubt about that and while the flavor be very good , i definitely feel a tad thin , not quite watery , but i feel a thicker body would really benefit this beer .<ssssss>overall , though i surely enjoy the combination of flavor as well as the nice bitter coffee aftertaste that it leave on the palate .<ssssss>
8 8 7 9 6		pour a tawny gold in my dfh glass .<ssssss>head decent , easily rouse with a few swirl .<ssssss>per the nose , you can just tell this be go to be a odd beer .<ssssss>a lot of sam c 's maple syrup , along with some undefined `` sour berry '' aroma .<ssssss>it smell sweet .<ssssss>yet it be not sweet .<ssssss>i get a decent amount of sour cranberry with some medicinal bitterness .<ssssss>the label claim star anise ... .<ssssss>i know star anise would typically contribute a strong licorice taste , yet any licorice character be mute , confine to the side of the tongue .<ssssss>it come to a dry , bitter/sour finish .<ssssss>this be a very strange beer , unlike most other i have have .<ssssss>yet there be a lot to pick out ; it be complicate .<ssssss>certainly not boring .<ssssss>it sit on the palate a little syrupy , without be sweet .<ssssss>this be the kind of beer you bring to a tasting with you fellow beer geek .<ssssss>you be probably not go to want to pound the bomber yourself .<ssssss>it be a bit much .<ssssss>interesting , no doubt , but a bit busy .<ssssss>but as i say , it be a good beer to bring to a tasting .<ssssss>a dab will do ya .<ssssss>
8 6 9 7 7		the color be golden with some rust tone near the head , which be a egg shell white .<ssssss>aggressive head continual effervescence and do not seem to want to leave .<ssssss>no lacing thus far , but we will see by the end .<ssssss>the smell be of pil malt , alcohol clove , and spice with some citrus note .<ssssss>its smooth and tart in just the right place .<ssssss>this be a well balanced beer .<ssssss>how ever when it come down to it i normally grab duvel over this , but it be still a excellent .<ssssss>.<ssssss>repeat excellent beer .<ssssss>p.s i do this about a year ago and now i know how horriable corriander be if you use it in every damn beer you brew .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 9		floral and fresh smell .<ssssss>innocently unaware but seductive as hell , the springlike daffodil aroma really bring anticipation .<ssssss>golden color and a very active busy head .<ssssss>a gentle pour bring forth 3/4 pint of head and 5 minute of wait to add more ale to the glass .<ssssss>the hop really take the back seat to the floral quasi astingency of the jasmine .<ssssss>there be some moment of honey couple with a nice dryness that point directly at a belgian style ipa .<ssssss>even though it be not brew as such , elysian should have probably just call it one and sit back and enjoy all the praise .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very live and very bubbly and right on style ... .<ssssss>for a belgian style ipa .<ssssss>seriously , this be one of those beer where a different label and style designation could make it the stuff of lore .<ssssss>
9 6 7 9 8		pour a great look deep mahogony in the glass with a quickley diminish one finger head that be a light tan .<ssssss>not much smell , a bit of toast and hop be all i can detect .<ssssss>taste be really good though , a nice coffe / toast taste with pleasant bitterness afterwards .<ssssss>this be not the world most complex brew but i seem to buy it a lot .<ssssss>very pleasant just about anytime and easy to find here .<ssssss>drinkability be a 4 to I and with the alcohol so well hide that can be dangerous with this beer .<ssssss>
6 7 8 6 8		i be very surprised there be not more review on this one .<ssssss>it be be available in the houston area for almost 2 week now .<ssssss>body be mainly straw yellow , with amber high light .<ssssss>aroma be clean and malty with flowery/peppery undertone .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be creamy , refreshing , and medium-light body .<ssssss>note of assertive earthy pale malt hit the palate first , follow by lightly flowery/citrus saaz hop undertone .<ssssss>shiner 101 , be very straight forward , no frill type of beer .<ssssss>it be a great choice for just casual drinking , and would pair nicely with barbeque .<ssssss>while , not deviate far from you typical macro lager - it deviate with much more mouthfeel , which provide a nice creaminess .<ssssss>a bit , more flavor , and good drinkability .<ssssss>
7 10 7 7 8		22oz bottle pour a light orange , lighter than many good ipa , with light head that quickly dissipate .<ssssss>lot of particle at the bottom .<ssssss>smell be a bouquet of hop .<ssssss>grapefruit and citrus dominate with a mix of floral note with generous dash of pine .<ssssss>some malty sweetness , hint of a caramel malt - very nice .<ssssss>taste do not deliver the complexity that the nose suggest , although this could be because the bottle be a few month old .<ssssss>the hop be there but not vibrant , and the malt do not have enough body to impress on its own .<ssssss>it also seem a little under carbonated which make it feel a little dull .<ssssss>there be still a nice bittering punch on the finish .<ssssss>overall , definitely not on par with some of bear 's other offering , though i be willing to grant it some slack because of the age of the bottle and because it be still a very drinkable brew .<ssssss>
8 8 5 6 7		pour a dark brownish amber with a minimal beige head and very little lacing .<ssssss>strong caramel and malt in the aroma .<ssssss>medium-bodied with a kind of slick mouthfeel .<ssssss>toast malt , caramel and sour fruit in flavor .<ssssss>the finish be both creamy and fruity .<ssssss>a fair doppelbock but it be a little too glassy-smooth throughout .<ssssss>
4 4 6 4 7		for some reason i always have to have a guiness , hate it , and then remember how much better harp be when i be in a `` irish '' bar .<ssssss>well , it be a straw color , a bit of a head but note impressive , good carbination .<ssssss>it be get some hop and grain and earthy aroma in the nose .<ssssss>the taste be much the same .<ssssss>just enough hop to keep it interesting and a bit of earthy grainy flavor i '' ve come to expect out of beer from that region .<ssssss>it be not bad if you ignore the huge price tag most bar seem to think it deserve .<ssssss>certainly not above average or anything but it be get flavor and you can sit back and have a few .<ssssss>

8 7 8 5 6		sample april 2007 intensely over carbonate , i end up with about 6 finger of head and a scant finger and a half of beer in my glass after the first pour .<ssssss>the head be a soft , amber-tinged , tan color and start to form quite the rocky surface as it very slowly subside .<ssssss>the beer be a brilliantly clear , cranberry-amber color that have lot of madly streaming rivulet of carbonation streaming through it .<ssssss>the aroma smell strongly of crushed soda cracker and freshly mill malt .<ssssss>some light hop note be also noticeable with note of green herb -lrb- almost vegetal -rrb- and a touch of citrus .<ssssss>the taste be lightly sweet up front , with a soft citrus character .<ssssss>pretty quickly though a strong , cook vegetal note take hold ; it be sort of a cross between broccoli and maybe even something like asparagus , though not really .<ssssss>there be a solid bitterness here , which meld well with a bergamot citrus character .<ssssss>the finish be dominate by a dry , toasty , almost roast-like grain flavor .<ssssss>the beer have a fairly light mouthfeel that seem quite appropriate for this beer .<ssssss>this be a interesting beer , on the one hand the malt and hop taste quite fresh and even vibrant at time , but the weird vegetal note can be quite off-putting when it be noticeable -lrb- thankfully , the vegetal flavor seem to fade with time -rrb- .<ssssss>
8 8 4 7 7		brew by coor locally .<ssssss>this bottle be leave at my house by houseguest .<ssssss>pour almost a finger of sticky , yet soda pop-like , head .<ssssss>odd , sticky , but the bubble be pop quickly .<ssssss>anyway .<ssssss>crystal clear gorgeous light copper-brown liquid .<ssssss>smell sweet toasty and tannic .<ssssss>a bit of edge that could be hop or alcohol sting .<ssssss>mildly of cherry in a brandy sort of way .<ssssss>dry malt .<ssssss>taste pretty good actually .<ssssss>sweet to start with malt jump in strong and a swet sweet finish .<ssssss>the flavor in the aftertaste hang around a while before thing dry out with a metalic edge .<ssssss>toasty malt and buttery diacetyl .<ssssss>a bit of a dry caramel flavor .<ssssss>light body but i think the buttery help the liquid form a slick on the tongue -lrb- not fond of this characteristic of this beer -rrb- .<ssssss>modestly carbonate .<ssssss>well do as a macro offering .<ssssss>this beer be classify on ba as a euro dark lager .<ssssss>not a style i be familiar with and there be presently no guideline provide .<ssssss>so ... this beer be not very dark ... and not very lager , either .<ssssss>but for a macro product , it be one of the best .<ssssss>i guess i will rate it partly as a macro offering .<ssssss>

8 7 3 3 3		presentation : 11oz bottle with `` best by '' tick of 2/08 , in a classic conical pint glass .<ssssss>in that i like porter and also love to try limited edition this be a no brainer .<ssssss>lightly floral , toast cracker , semi-sweet nose .<ssssss>can not quite put my nose , er , finger on it , but there be a acidic , sweet aroma ... probably the hop .<ssssss>as it warm some sweeter apple quality come thru .<ssssss>head be a fat finger 's worth of tight , creamy , fade ivory hued foam that settle to a nice 1/8 '' blanket of cover , darker & thicker on the glass edge , sticky and lacing thickly .<ssssss>color be a stunning , deep rudy , bloodstained brown , very dark , murky .<ssssss>its pretty dry , very dry actually , bittersweet .<ssssss>a trace of that honey be noticeable , but its hard to find under those silty , earthy , almost chalky dry malt .<ssssss>for a honey porter this be very bitter & dry .<ssssss>its rather bland , dull , flat , and definitely chalky .<ssssss>combine the classic shipyard hop with a bitter malt profile ... .<ssssss>not very please .<ssssss>it do sweeten up some on the palate , a little richer ... metallic !<ssssss>thats the mystery aroma -lrb- annonize zinc , anyone ? -rrb-<ssssss>... and -lrb- ugh -rrb- also the mouthfeel .<ssssss>the alcoholic sonar that go thru my sinus make I wince , and not from high abv .<ssssss>there be some subtle chocolate & caramel quality hide in there , but they be watery & under all the rest of the unfortunate main taste ... .<ssssss>too bad .<ssssss>it finish bitter -lrb- surprise -rrb- , thin , water and chalky , leave a filmy , blackboard aftertaste .<ssssss>this be just bad , and it certainly can not be due to get a old bottle .<ssssss>i be pretty disappointed , but at least now i know .<ssssss>if you , like I , enjoy porter and like try limited edition beer , take my advice that there be nothing to see here , and spend you money on some other limited .<ssssss>

6 7 6 4 4		i think that i be suppose to like this beer because it have a trendy hippy-oriented name .<ssssss>420 ; ah , i get it .<ssssss>the emperor have not clothes , however .<ssssss>what you get be a so-so up front , mellow enough taste , bore middle and too-sour aftertaste that as a homebrewer i associate with bacterial infection .<ssssss>i could not make it through a picture of this , give the rest to some glassy eyed frat type who could not believe they luck .<ssssss>it be all about the label .<ssssss>very underwhelming .<ssssss>a dilletante 's trappist ale .<ssssss>
8 6 8 8 10		finally get around to try the chimay 's .<ssssss>i have the blue in the fridge for tomorrow : -rrb- pour a wonderfull dark redish golden brown .<ssssss>lacing and a nice head that just fill the glass and stay there as you drink it .<ssssss>spice spice spice .<ssssss>wonderfull , almost like a indian spiced tea smell with a slight alcoholic warmth .<ssssss>taste : wonferully crisp .<ssssss>strong clove and western asian spice .<ssssss>the spice just linger , even a few minute after the last sip .<ssssss>the spice be balance by a middle eastern dry fruit .<ssssss>some a wonderfully complex , but easy drinking beer .<ssssss>i note to my friend , i could actually buy 4 or 5 of these , watch some hockey and really enjoy it .<ssssss>i wish all beer that taste this good could be so easy drinking .<ssssss>i highly recommend give this beer a chance if you not a trappist beer expert , if you be , then you already know this be a nice brew ...<ssssss>
8 9 8 9 6		cellare keg on tap at bodega in columbus in july .<ssssss>they do not say how old it be but i be assume it be from the 2010 batch release early this year , so it be around 6 month old .<ssssss>my pint come and the beer be amber in color , no haze - it be very clear for a double ipa -lrb- at least a eastern one -rrb- .<ssssss>no head , but very well carbonated .<ssssss>smell of hop .<ssssss>and despite the age i mean fresh hop .<ssssss>they dry hop the hell out of this brew , and it show in the crisp hop oils that permeate the sens .<ssssss>the flavor be of course hop-forward .<ssssss>this be certainly go to be a hop bomb , esp .<ssssss>for anyone who prefer a very malty ipa .<ssssss>i honestly detect little to no malt flavor despite the dark amber color .<ssssss>perhaps the dark color be due to all the hop oils ?<ssssss>this one be very very bitter but clean and utterly delicious for what it be .<ssssss>you definitely notice the alcohol , there be a mild burn in the mouth throughout the whole process but it do not travel into the throat the way some boozier beer can .<ssssss>it be crisp and nicely carbonate and very oily on the finish .<ssssss>i really enjoy this but one be enough for I .<ssssss>i will be look for bottle next year though so i can keep enjoy it over the course of a few day .<ssssss>
7 5 6 7 8		pretty standard , nothing too special here .<ssssss>light flavor but it taste alright with a meal or snack .<ssssss>good party beer if you be look for a easy taste that everyone can agree with .<ssssss>not to go off topic but you might be better off try heineken 's dark lager .<ssssss>it have a overall better taste and will not disappoint .<ssssss>
9 5 5 8 7		22oz brown bottle , bottled-on date stamp on neck a - deep ruby with a thick tan head that have good retention and leave web of lace down the glass .<ssssss>s/t - some chocolate note and cream coffee , but mostly roasted malt .<ssssss>some earthy hop and dark chocolate bitterness through the finish .<ssssss>neither be as `` robust '' as the name imply .<ssssss>the aroma be very weak .<ssssss>i really have to search for it .<ssssss>m - a bit on the thin side for a porter and very low carbonation make it seem a little watery .<ssssss>o - taste good , but overall a little disappointing .<ssssss>the 22oz bottle format will probably prevent I from buy this again .<ssssss>
8 5 8 5 6		pour a copper-brown colour , with very thick off-white head .<ssssss>head spill over the glass because it keep grow after the pour .<ssssss>lot of lace around the glass .<ssssss>definitely darker than a typical pale ale , but still look nice .<ssssss>smell of a weird combination of grassy and earthy hop , with a hint of citrus .<ssssss>lot of caramel .<ssssss>not the greatest tasting , this may be a little bit off , but i be not completely sure .<ssssss>i purchase the bottle a month ago , so it be not old .<ssssss>really huge carbonation level .<ssssss>just a ok beer , i will not seek out again .<ssssss>
6 4 6 6 5		will preface this ... have have this on tap and in bottle .<ssssss>i dislike the bottle big time .<ssssss>very metalic and lose its apple and spice character that on tap have .<ssssss>in the bottle the smell be a dull apple , not the crisp apple that the tap version have .<ssssss>very sad because this beer could be a very good white ale .<ssssss>if i rate this beer as the tap version i would give this a b because of the smell , taste and drinkability .<ssssss>in the bottle i get very tired of this beer after 2-3 sip .<ssssss>have this on tap in az for 3 month and it be excellent .<ssssss>move to australia and my gf buy I a 6 pack and i could not finish it .<ssssss>too metalic and only save grace be the brewery and that i have have it on tap beforehand .<ssssss>
7 7 4 6 6		2004 draught @ the brewpub .<ssssss>nice to see this style finally be brew in rochester .<ssssss>pour a bright golden , with some light orange hue and a good-sized white head , but not very deep and no red tinge .<ssssss>aroma be full speed ahead with the hop and the flavor match the aroma with ton of bitter floral and citrus note .<ssssss>the first thing i notice about this beer , and then about the other beer i try be how fresh the hop taste .<ssssss>in fact , i think , `` it remind you of chew on a hop '' .<ssssss>extremely fresh .<ssssss>malting be nothing to write home about , as there dosent seem to be much of a attempt at balance , but oh well .<ssssss>its a start .<ssssss>assertive carbonation , medium-to medium-full body .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 9		a - frothy white head .<ssssss>golden straw color with a million tiny bubble race to the top .<ssssss>s - spicy , sweet , yeastie and a little fruity .<ssssss>i really have a hard time describe the smell of belgian .<ssssss>t - first sip be have a spicy sweetness up front .<ssssss>i would try and pick out the fruit taste but i just can not so i will leave it at that .<ssssss>in the middle there be a nice sweet maltiness and some hop bitterness to round thing out nicely .<ssssss>i have have other belgian that be just over the top in that yeastie profile - this one be not .<ssssss>everything seem to be balance .<ssssss>m - it be like a champagne .<ssssss>that be the best i can describe it .<ssssss>refresh with a somewhat tart and crisp finish .<ssssss>not overly dry - just right on the mouthfeel .<ssssss>i actually think it be probably one of the better ` light ' beer i have try in respect to mouthfeel .<ssssss>d - each belgian i try get better and better with this one be the best .<ssssss>it could be i have grow accustomed to the taste or i just keep pick better beer .<ssssss>i would like to think with this one , the latter hold true .<ssssss>careful with this one - it do not have the heavy feeling of a 8.5 % abv beer .<ssssss>you could easily get hammer on this one without even know it .<ssssss>i would definitely buy this again .<ssssss>
8 7 10 9 8		1993 vintage the beer pour a deep amber with very light head .<ssssss>the aroma be sharp with plum nut and alchol .<ssssss>the taste be of plum and fig with a good alcohol bite .<ssssss>its mouthfeel be much more of a wine character than a beer .<ssssss>different but not bad .<ssssss>i feel kinda privaledge to drink a beer that be make almost ten year before i could drink legally .<ssssss>
5 3 6 5 9		12oz .<ssssss>green can .<ssssss>a : pour a clear light yellow .<ssssss>the head pour large but then turn to nothing as it fizzle out .<ssssss>s : do not smell of beer .<ssssss>lime aroma be not even that fresh smell .<ssssss>t/m : do not taste like beer .<ssssss>i think i be drink a soda .<ssssss>very fizzy and lime be most dominant .<ssssss>hop and malt be not there .<ssssss>d : not very good at all .<ssssss>corona and lime i would much prefer .<ssssss>although this brew be very easy to drink .<ssssss>not a future purchase for I .<ssssss>cheer<ssssss>
7 5 8 8 7		bottled in jan 2005 .<ssssss>it pour a very light golden yellow , fizzy , with a thick white head which slowly reduce , but do not go away .<ssssss>it be slightly cloudy , and remarkably light in color .<ssssss>the smell be tangy and yeasty .<ssssss>the yeast aroma be reminiscent of other belgian beer .<ssssss>there be a medicinal quality to the smell , and some wheat and alcohol aroma as well .<ssssss>the beer taste light and yeasty , but also bitter and hoppy .<ssssss>the hop be citrusy and acidic , not flowery or herbal .<ssssss>a spicy beverage , which be enhance by the carbonation .<ssssss>there be some fruity flavor as well , lemon and pear .<ssssss>the finish be bitter and light , highly carbonated , it be fizzy and light-bodied .<ssssss>i like this beer , but i be put off by the aroma - perhaps it be the particular strain of yeast be use .<ssssss>it be quite drinkable , though , and refreshing .<ssssss>
8 8 9 6 9		dark brown amber - almost opaque in my glass but hold up to the sun i get beautiful red ray shine through .<ssssss>smallish dark head that be quickly go .<ssssss>smell like b ` wine , darn it !<ssssss>malty and bitter hoppy , you know ?<ssssss>but then , well , in the mouth ... it be not bad - not at all .<ssssss>but i think it be a i2pa with too much color .<ssssss>i do not know .<ssssss>life be complicate .<ssssss>it be beer .<ssssss>it be decent .<ssssss>it be not what i be look for .<ssssss>almost english b ` wine with the syrupy sweetness .<ssssss>but much more bitter than one of those .<ssssss>but not as bitter as a ` merican b ` wine .<ssssss>so ... too sweet , not quite the body , not quite the bitterness .<ssssss>of the `` ideal '' ` merican b ` wine .<ssssss>in my opinion .<ssssss>
7 4 6 6 5		pour a clear golden/red with only few bubble and a large white frothy head .<ssssss>the head be nice and leave very good lacing .<ssssss>the smell be not all that strong , but you can make out some sweet malt and hop .<ssssss>the taste be very malty for a ipa with bread yeast , bitter hop and the above mention malt as the primary flavor .<ssssss>the m/f be light and somewhat thin with the flavor only mix ok .<ssssss>not horrible , but this be a weak ipa .<ssssss>
6 8 6 6 7		light amber with a one finger tiny-bubbled head .<ssssss>lacing be very thin and trail throughout .<ssssss>the aroma be by far the most satisfying part of this beer : flowery hop , grapefruit , apple cider , honey-sweet malt .<ssssss>i wish i could say that the taste be as satisfy .<ssssss>there be nothing fundamentally wrong with it ; it be a decent balance of citrusy hop and sweet malt , but it doesnt live up to the aroma .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be a little too watery to be satiny and so its kind of flat on the taste bud despite the medium carbonation .<ssssss>it be satisfy and drinkable despite its lack of complexity from a taste standpoint .<ssssss>this be the first ellicottville that ive try , and although i wasnt wow , im make a mental note to pick up a sixer of another one of they beer .<ssssss>not bad .<ssssss>for more beer review , music , book and more visit my website at selfhatinghipster.com<ssssss>
8 7 4 8 7		get this at the bottle shop down the street .<ssssss>from a 750 ml ceramic bottle into a snifter .<ssssss>preliminary note : this bottle be cap with a swing top attach at the side .<ssssss>the fact that it be cap , and not just seal with a swing cap , may have influence the carbonation and appearance quite significantly .<ssssss>other who have non-capped bottle report it be flat and uncarbonated , with little to no head .<ssssss>second preliminary note : like a lot of belgian stout and proter , this one do not resemble its english and american counterpart .<ssssss>it be very belgian in style , and i try to review it with this in mind .<ssssss>appearance : pour a very big 2 + finger off-white head .<ssssss>head be medium thin look with pop bubble on top .<ssssss>colour be brown with a ruby hint as well .<ssssss>head slowly fade into a nice healthy film cap that stay until the end .<ssssss>some lace down the glass .<ssssss>nice look and could have be near perfect , but a porter should be a bit darker and have a somewhat thicker head .<ssssss>smell : the nose be strong and a sweet-sour fruitiness be noticeable immediately .<ssssss>mostly some exotic belgian style fruit , such as sour grape , raisin and date all roll into one .<ssssss>there be a bit or yeast and bread in there as well .<ssssss>taste : the taste differ quite markedly from the nose .<ssssss>sweet-sour fruitiness of grape and date show up off the bat with a sweet grainy malt undertone as well .<ssssss>yeast be evident there too .<ssssss>a hint of honey and butterscotch in the background add to the malt sweetness .<ssssss>there be basically no aftertaste to speak of .<ssssss>a nice mild aftertaste would have make the taste even better , but despite this little missing piece , this brew be pretty good overall .<ssssss>palate : this be pretty weak .<ssssss>thin body and high end carbonation .<ssssss>go down smooth with no bite and finish very dry , which be alright , but just too thin for the style .<ssssss>overall : this be definitely belgian in style , more like a belgian double or strong dark ale than a baltic porter .<ssssss>give how belgian porter and stout come out , this be to be expect .<ssssss>it be enjoyable , drinkable , and taste very nice , even if it be not really a porter as most of we know they .<ssssss>in fact , the thin feel be the only thing that really hurt the beer .<ssssss>in the end , if you be in the mood for a good , interesting , and unique belgian , like a strong dark or a dubbel , then give this a try .<ssssss>on the other hand , if you be look for a english or american style porter , try elsewhere .<ssssss>

5 7 6 3 5		yellowish orange in color and cloudy of course .<ssssss>the best this beer have to offer be it be smell , which be very strong and full .<ssssss>i notice right away , though , that it be overpoweringly orangey .<ssssss>i be almost take aback by the flavor , as i could almost forget i be drink beer with the over-intense orange flavor .<ssssss>the bar tender ask if i want a slice of orange with the pint , which i be very glad i decline , as the last thing this beer need be more orange flavor .<ssssss>needless to say it get old fast .<ssssss>the maker of this brew be able to pack a lot of flavor in there , too bad -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- it be all way too much orange and not enough complexity .<ssssss>
6 9 6 6 7		pour such a light gold that i be go to call it yellow .<ssssss>little head that disappear quickly .<ssssss>the appearance of this be not that far off from a macro .<ssssss>the nose , however , be beautiful : fresh , green hop that combine saaz and pine in a bohemian/american combo .<ssssss>very earthy , but not funky .<ssssss>sharp and floral while still be invite .<ssssss>great nose .<ssssss>the palate be a disappointment , though .<ssssss>sweetness first off , follow by juicy carbonation and then a crash of bitter hop .<ssssss>the aftertaste be sharply bitter -- way too much for a style that should be soft and drinkable .<ssssss>overall , this be a disappointment for I .<ssssss>the nose hint at great thing to come , but the palate seem disjointed and not soft enough for the style .<ssssss>
8 8 4 7 7		little head retention after this be pour from its 12oz bottle which interestingly boast one of those ` best if consume before date marked : ' line with all the month of the year list , but none marked !<ssssss>it have a pleasant strong amber colour and look tantalisingly cloudy .<ssssss>smell citrus sweet with perhaps a little caramel .<ssssss>i can not wait to dig into this ... .<ssssss>so the taste come as a rather a disappointment .<ssssss>it be rather watery and flat -lrb- there be a little carbonation , but the bubble be minute and not at all refreshing -rrb- .<ssssss>the hop action be much more lay back than i have expect and come in after a very disappointing , almost tasteless beginning .<ssssss>there be a nice citrus hop flavour which gradually drift off .<ssssss>not in the same league as pike 's kilt lifter scotch ale .<ssssss>this bring a beef to light too - if you ask I the feel be more important than the appearance or the smell , but it only receive half the rating .<ssssss>thus this beer be overrate !<ssssss>
6 7 8 6 6		on tap at the brew pub into a pint .<ssssss>`` not quite imperial and a bit more than a standard stout , we extra stout showcase large quantity of roasted barley malt and english fuggle hop .<ssssss>a bit drier and sharper than we old 8 porter - just as dark and just as delicious !

7 6 5 8 8		easy drinking , light style euro lager .<ssssss>i prefer this over the heineken and the stella .<ssssss>appearance : bubbly and golden , almost like champagne , but with a small head .<ssssss>smell : light and effervescent , floral hop but not much taste : crisp , clean feel -lrb- hate to use the bud adjective -rrb- .<ssssss>minor hint of malt and a hop spiciness .<ssssss>mouthfeel : fast-vanishing .<ssssss>carbonated water feel .<ssssss>drinkability : easy to drink and enjoy .<ssssss>a step up from the typical euro/american macro , in my opinion .<ssssss>not the best beer in copenhagen , however .<ssssss>
8 6 8 10 9		pour into a hill farmstead glass , reveal slightly hazy golden body under a few finger of airy white head .<ssssss>some lacing .<ssssss>smell a little starchy with some lemon and canned corn on the nose , pretty dry-smelling as a whole .<ssssss>slight spiciness to it with the vegetable overtone .<ssssss>i do not get as much of the vanilla as with many bourbon barrel-aged beer , but there be some woodiness to it .<ssssss>lot of bourbon barrel aging on the tongue , though !<ssssss>a sweet breadiness with slight spice from the yeast .<ssssss>some corn .<ssssss>spritz of orange citrus .<ssssss>so much yummy vanilla oak .<ssssss>tender meatiness to it as well .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium-bodied and creamy with tiny mouth-filling carbonation .<ssssss>very , very drinkable .<ssssss>i like this one very much the way it be .<ssssss>the nose do not do it so much for I , but the rest be spot on .<ssssss>
6 6 5 4 8		i be a big fan of ipa but , this beer do not stand up to my , and more than likely anyone els , standard for a hoppy beer .<ssssss>a : it pour with a head of , at most , 1 '' .<ssssss>color be amber , not quite light but not dark .<ssssss>the color be not what i would expect .<ssssss>s : it have the aroma of a normal ale with a little scent of pine , denote the lack of hop in the brew .<ssssss>t : i be expect a much stronger flavor but , be sorely disappointed .<ssssss>the hop be , at best , a secondary note .<ssssss>if i be to rank it from 1-10 , i would give it a 3 for hoppiness .<ssssss>m : it be very light , not too heavy on the alcohol , and with a decent amount of carbonation .<ssssss>d : if you deal have nothing to do with a hoppy beer , this be a very drinkable beer .<ssssss>it do not have a whole lot of flavor so if you want a ipa that be light , this be the beer .<ssssss>
7 8 9 7 8		thanks to northernbrew for this brew .<ssssss>12 oz .<ssssss>bottle pour into a nonic .<ssssss>i can not say i have ever have a smoked stout , let 's give it a shot .<ssssss>pour a complete midnight black with a big dark mocha three finger head that quickly die down to a thin layer of bubble .<ssssss>not much lacing be leave behind on the side .<ssssss>smell consist of sweet malt , char wood , and brown sugar .<ssssss>slight coffee and caramel aroma find they way in the nose as well .<ssssss>not as smokey as i have anticipate , let 's take a sip .<ssssss>mild burnt wood flavor from start to finish .<ssssss>date and plum make a quick appearance on the tongue but be quickly over take by more char flavor .<ssssss>very slight chocolate malt also can be detect on the tongue .<ssssss>aftertaste be a bit dry with roasted barley .<ssssss>flavor be kind of one dimensional overall .<ssssss>medium body mouthfeel with a extremely smooth feel .<ssssss>low carbonation , but i like how it fit in with this beer .<ssssss>pretty solid beer overall .<ssssss>definitely give it a shot , but i would not go out of you way to do so .<ssssss>
4 7 9 8 8		750 ml .<ssssss>bottle , uncorked with a nice and satisfying pop .<ssssss>appearance be a letdown .<ssssss>a brown , red , almost plum colour .<ssssss>nice colour , but the disappointing thing be the head .<ssssss>they be none .<ssssss>just a little sea of bubble and froth , but no real head that i expect from a unibroue offering .<ssssss>no lacing either .<ssssss>not impressed .<ssssss>smell be pretty good .<ssssss>that standard unibroue yeast smell , bit malt character , alcohol , plum , ginger , raisin , currant , fig , earth and floral hop .<ssssss>taste be strong with raisin and spice .<ssssss>almost a peppery tingle on the tongue .<ssssss>open up to a floral , down to earth taste with a bit of a alcohol/rum bite .<ssssss>sweet throughout , and very malty .<ssssss>mouthfeel be thick and almost fizzy .<ssssss>i could not drink more than a few bottle a week , but i like it .<ssssss>i be wonder what would it be like if age .<ssssss>
10 4 6 4 4		probably the most stunning look beer i have ever see .<ssssss>unfiltered .<ssssss>nice amber color .<ssssss>and the foam be ridiculous .<ssssss>dated 10.08.2006 .<ssssss>appearance simply must be a 5 .<ssssss>the towering head make it almost a nuisance to pour .<ssssss>take several minute to pour my 11.2 oz bottle into my 20 oz glass .<ssssss>tart , fruity aroma , mildy alcoholic note , but in no way a `` big '' beer .<ssssss>flavor be watery , with some spice and sour note -lrb- higher serve temperature emphasize sourness -rrb- .<ssssss>aftertaste be sharp/bitter , but not strong .<ssssss>mouthfeel be dry , and rough from carbonation .<ssssss>drinkability be nothing special .<ssssss>
6 6 8 6 6		drink straight out of the bottle .<ssssss>can not comment on the appearance .<ssssss>i be go into this with fairly low expectation , but it be not terrible .<ssssss>a little too sweet for my taste .<ssssss>the honey taste be subtle enough but do not really do it for I .<ssssss>it be a very full-bodied beer that , despite a overall lack of anything interesting , leave my stomach satisfied .<ssssss>i be pleasantly surprise .<ssssss>pick this one up if you be in a pinch and desperate for a decent beer .<ssssss>
7 6 8 4 6		a - pour a perfectly clear golden color with a half finger of head that quickly die down .<ssssss>s - belgian yeast , a slight bit of funk , with a slight pepperish spice .<ssssss>t - this could have be a real winner saison , with a fresh yeasty and funky flavor .<ssssss>however , i think the lemon pepper give it a flavor that take a turn for the worse with a bland bitter flavor and slight citrus zing .<ssssss>m/d - mouthfeel be full for the style and pleasant .<ssssss>as i say , if they would have stick to the saison this would be a great beer .<ssssss>if this be the winner of a competition , i would hate to have try the loser .<ssssss>
8 9 6 7 7		review 12/23/2008 -lrb- bottle -rrb- : pour a filter clear golden orangish color body .<ssssss>big foamy white head , last .<ssssss>very hoppy piney aroma .<ssssss>citrusy and dry .<ssssss>harsh dry taste , bitter grapefruit .<ssssss>citrus with some nutty balance .<ssssss>less harsh as it warm , more palatable , a little sweeter too .<ssssss>
6 8 10 7 9		after see this beer be pretty decent in the ba magazine , i figure i would give it a run .<ssssss>i be a big fan of munich dunkel , so the more option the better .<ssssss>pour a light brown color with a medium head the go away pretty quickly .<ssssss>not nearly as dark as any other dunkel i have have .<ssssss>it be not bad , but it be just unusually light .<ssssss>smell be chocolaty , but it do have some hop in there .<ssssss>flavor start off with a tiny hit of euro-lager hop , the move on to caramel sweetness , and finish with a burnt chocolate flavor .<ssssss>not bad at all .<ssssss>not the best or the worst , but still pretty tasty .<ssssss>mouthfeel 's a perfect mix of thick and thin .<ssssss>hold the flavor so it be no too dry , but be thin enough to be a summer brew .<ssssss>i would have no problem drink a few of these .<ssssss>it come in a large bottle and it be justified .<ssssss>i would want more than just 12oz .<ssssss>not bad at all .<ssssss>i appreciate carlsberg give other style a try .<ssssss>i guess they be use spaten yeast in they brew , so it make sense to give this style a shot .<ssssss>

7 7 8 6 5		have on tap at the bierhaus .<ssssss>seem to have be recently brew .<ssssss>pour a burnished orange colour with very pleasant , thick cream-coloured head of fairly small bubble .<ssssss>steady stream of bead .<ssssss>lacing be speckled but nice and sticky .<ssssss>look good , but not spectacular for a belgian style .<ssssss>first note and please take note , lobethal - serve way too cold .<ssssss>it be icy .<ssssss>the snifter be actually freezing my hand as i hold it , have to warm it extensively for about five minute to get any sort of character from it .<ssssss>eventually get some fruit note , raisin and some apricot .<ssssss>some tangy citrus as well , and a good dose of some alcohol phenol on the back with some maraschino cherry note .<ssssss>smell quite light and fruity , could use more spice to remind I it be a belgian style .<ssssss>taste very tangy , lot of cherry , strawberry and baked apple flavour from the start .<ssssss>mid-palate impart some phenol , hint of tonic water and a bit of over-sweet character come through .<ssssss>big warming alcohol note , a little too strong .<ssssss>it be quite noticeable .<ssssss>quite spicy but in a bitey , alcoholic way , with a whisper of white pepper on the back that give it a bit of a edge .<ssssss>a bit overdo with the booze , not enough flavour complexity to mask it , and it be really obvious as a result .<ssssss>okay but lack depth of flavour .<ssssss>basically i be just miss that wintery , malty undertone and the richness of the spicy belgian yeast , they be just not apparent enough .<ssssss>too many ester five this a light ale character , but with a large alcohol hit .<ssssss>mouthfeel be not bad , very full and textured .<ssssss>could use a bit more stickiness from malt , but from the lack of malt on the palate you can tell it be a nice full thick beer from the feel at least .<ssssss>not all that drinkable actually , a bit of a struggly .<ssssss>very sweet with obvious alcohol - not such a good mix in a beer .<ssssss>
7 4 3 7 5		appearance - nice amber pour , a finger + of pale tan foam .<ssssss>quick to recede , not much lace residue .<ssssss>aroma - nothing really .<ssssss>after it settle there be a faint trace of grain and/or citrus .<ssssss>taste - malt base be a bit bland but have a light biscuity element .<ssssss>mild toastiness follow by mild hop with little to no bite .<ssssss>the label say this be a ` mild amber beer ' and they mean it .<ssssss>the finish have a little toastiness come on and be fairly clean .<ssssss>mouthfeel - very thin , make the beer feel fizzy , which i do not really like .<ssssss>drinkability - bodiless and almost boring .<ssssss>i would pick it over the mega swill but not much else .<ssssss>
7 6 8 6 5		pour this 750 ml into a long stem tulip .<ssssss>this beer pour a deep dark black color .<ssssss>it provide no light to go through , and have a decent look mocha color head .<ssssss>at the end of the beer it really pour a lot of thick chew tobacco sediment .<ssssss>the beer have a bland smell .<ssssss>i receive heavy amount of burn malt and chocolate .<ssssss>overall not bad , but i be not very impressed by this anniversary beer .<ssssss>the taste be average .<ssssss>i experience some excellent chocolate note , but that lead to bitter burned malt and very little other flavor .<ssssss>not a terrible brew but nothing to stand out from this amazing brewery .<ssssss>it have a really good mouthfeel .<ssssss>this beer be rich and viscous .<ssssss>it do allow the beer to play around the mouth very nice .<ssssss>the flavor that be there do keep a wonderful residence .<ssssss>the drinkability be alright , however after 750ml i be all set .<ssssss>between the flavor , excess sediment , and lack of composition i do not want anymore than what i have .<ssssss>final thought - i be glad i get to try this beer .<ssssss>i love the ommegang brewery and hold it in high regard .<ssssss>i be excite to get this bottle for $ 7 instead of $ 15 , but this anniversary release be not my favorite .<ssssss>this be a good attempt by ommegang but overall the beer do not stand out like ommegang usually do .<ssssss>give it a try if you like the brewery , but there be definitely better chocolate stout to be have .<ssssss>

8 6 7 4 4		this one be bottled sometime in april , so it be little more than a month old .<ssssss>pour into a tulip .<ssssss>light amber hazy body with a thick off white head .<ssssss>good lacing .<ssssss>the smell be sweet and exactly like the artificial cotton candy bubblegum smell .<ssssss>there be a hint of citrus in the aroma as well .<ssssss>the taste be very sweet , with a bit of the vanilla oak flavor .<ssssss>the hop be very subdue ; maybe add a little floral flavor to the candy sweetness .<ssssss>the body be medium-large , and the carbonation nice and prickly .<ssssss>not a offensive tasting beverage , but i can not say i be a fan by any means .<ssssss>this be close to be a barleywine , but there be not any complexity in the taste and it be just too sweet .<ssssss>
7 4 7 6 6		pour from bottle , refrigerate overnight , to pint glass .<ssssss>the head appear just above one finger and disappear shortly after the pour .<ssssss>there be very little lacing from start to finish .<ssssss>the appearance be slightly cloudy with a tangerine amber color .<ssssss>the only aroma , which be not very strong , be a sharp sour smell .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be very acceptable but the flavor never really come out .<ssssss>it be a very average tasting ale , lack any unique characteristic .<ssssss>
7 8 4 7 8		moderately vigorous pour produce a large off-white head that quickly fade and leave minimal lacing over a clear amber body .<ssssss>decent look beer for a light lager .<ssssss>smell be remarkably malty and relatively intense for a l.l .<ssssss>taste fall off a bit , but still good .<ssssss>not very hoppy or very malty , but pretty pleasant .<ssssss>mouthfeel be where this brew suffer : it be really just pretty thin .<ssssss>if you like the taste -- and i do -- you could drink a lot of these .<ssssss>overall , a pretty decent beer , for a light lager .<ssssss>still , this be not a stand-alone brew : it go great with food .<ssssss>
9 8 10 8 9		a - pour a midnight black color with a finger of thick , dense medium brown head .<ssssss>s-smell of mostly bourbon note : vanilla , burnt sugar , alcohol and some dark fruit note .<ssssss>t-bourbon upfront with some nice roasted and deep chocolate note with bourbon spiciness on the finish .<ssssss>m-probably the thickest beer i have ever head .<ssssss>dense like a really good milkshake and leave a milkshake mustache to match with some spicy alcohol note in the throat .<ssssss>d-very present bourbon note without be a complete bourbon bomb .<ssssss>the drinkability be quite good , all thing consider , and i think the ridiculously smooth , luscious mouthfeel help this .<ssssss>
9 6 7 8 8		350ml bottle into delirium tremen glass .<ssssss>batch 008 .<ssssss>a : pour a bright golden with a billow dense white head that fade into thick fuzzy film that leave great ring of lace down the glass .<ssssss>s : much less spice than i remember the tap version have .<ssssss>i be pick up much more citrus , lemon zest and spicy yeast than i be in the tap version .<ssssss>there be still a hint of bubblegum .<ssssss>t : sweet citrus and golden fruit note along with the yeast dominate .<ssssss>not a ton of hop come through but there be a light bitterness in the finish .<ssssss>m : light body with a mouthfeel that be just a tad too thin .<ssssss>carbonation be light and tingly .<ssssss>d : i be thoroughly impressed when i have this on tap at the brewery , but the bottle be let I down a bit .<ssssss>this be still a great beer that be crazy drinkable and impressively complex for a fairly low alcohol brew , but i would still prefer its belgian counterpart .<ssssss>
8 7 7 9 8		well i would classiffy this as a grand cru not a tripel .<ssssss>but grand cru be not a selection it pour a white gold color with some haze from the yeast .<ssssss>the head be very pillowy and white .<ssssss>the aroma have malt , wheat , spice maybe corriander and alochol .<ssssss>the flavor be great with a slight bitterness , sweet maltyness , the spice and alochol .<ssssss>have two and it be a real winter warmer .<ssssss>

7 8 6 9 7		no light come through on this one at all , but also no head as the flat , lifeless body just lay there , quite odd indeed .<ssssss>aroma be dark peat , hint of campfire smoke , note of light cocoa , and a hint of deep burnt note , but that be the highlight as it go down from there .<ssssss>very lifeless , flat body do not let the taste come through nearly as much as it could have and this lead to a rather lackluster profile .<ssssss>nice barrel note , load of wood and peat<ssssss>
8 6 4 6 6		order this on tap while have lunch at the red lobster .<ssssss>pour a clear dark amber with a off-white head .<ssssss>aroma consist mainly of malt and grain .<ssssss>very thin and watery body and mouthfeel .<ssssss>taste primarily consist of sweet malt middle and finish .<ssssss>not much else .<ssssss>killian 's irish red be not a bad brew , just nothing incredibly special .<ssssss>it be a shame that coor have opt to discountinue import caffey 's irish ale in favor of this , strictly for domestic marketing and sale purpose .<ssssss>

6 3 7 3 5		wow .<ssssss>i have be craving beer for a while now , and recently see two great lakes beer i never have before , both limited , so i decide to get some : glockenspiel -lrb- some good stuff -rrb- and this , grassroot ale .<ssssss>i figure , it be great lake ... they have yet to * really * put I down , so i buy a 12-pack of grassroot ale -lrb- partially because of glockenspiel 's high alcohol content and the fact that it be only available in a expensive four-pack -rrb- .<ssssss>anyway , the appearance ... it do not look great ; a clear , washed-out yellow color with a small white head .<ssssss>as for the aroma it be grassy , weedy , vegetable-like , etc .<ssssss>not very appealing , but different from anything i have smell before .<ssssss>i be not impressed , but whatever ... i guess i will taste it and give it a try .<ssssss>its taste be , unfortunately , just like the smell ... only worse .<ssssss>strong weedy , grassy , and vegetable-like flavor be all at the forefront , all fight for dominance ... and all seem to just be offensive .<ssssss>now , it be a few day since i first try this , and i be finally reach the end of the 12-pack .<ssssss>i realize that , while the base beer -lrb- in typical great lake fashion -rrb- be excellent and would be good on its own , all these grass and weed just kill it .<ssssss>do not this replace moondog ale in bottle ?<ssssss>i admit do not care much for that one -lrb- esb be just not my style -rrb- , but after try this , a moondog sound damn good right now ... and i will probably know better next time to stay away from anything that say `` saison '' on the package .<ssssss>the drinkability , on the other hand , be the tough part .<ssssss>the first two or three beer have I struggle to even continue .<ssssss>however , possibly due to the alcohol content -lrb- 6 % abv -rrb- , or maybe just because the `` offensive '' taste start to get weaker ... by the third or fourth beer , it be tolerable .<ssssss>still , almost any `` decent '' beer be probably drinkable after have a few , and grassroot be -lrb- like any glbc beer -rrb- not cheap , so i be have a hard time justify drinking this beer at all .<ssssss>and to finish this review off : the mouthfeel be pretty decent ; not watery , and not heavy .<ssssss>just about average .<ssssss>conclusion : i will not be get this again .<ssssss>hopefully this be short-lived and great lakes put out a better seasonal in its place .<ssssss>

''<ssssss>a : pour a little watery compare to the big hitter out there .<ssssss>a aggressive pour bring a heavy head with good retention and excellent lacing .<ssssss>dark and creamy in the glass .<ssssss>s : i be least impressed with the smell .<ssssss>i could smell the malt and a hint of chocolate but i have to stick my nose nearly in the beer to get that .<ssssss>t : get past the smell and you have get a solid tasting stout .<ssssss>the stout be certainly not go to meet the boldness of , say , a old rasputin or ten fity , but the malt , burnt chocolate , and caramel be there and tasty .<ssssss>m : creamy feel .<ssssss>good stuff .<ssssss>d : absolutely drinkable .<ssssss>because of its understate taste and little carbonation it attract my stout pallet without inundate it .<ssssss>sam adam have make a beer above they average .<ssssss>everything fit the imperial stout mold except for the smell .<ssssss>
7 9 6 7 6		volo cask day 2008 .<ssssss>i would classify this as a american stout .<ssssss>a : black with a light tan head , no retention or lace .<ssssss>s : remarkably similar to black forest cake -lrb- cocoa , sweet cake , hint of cherry -rrb- , with a underlie roastyness .<ssssss>t : slight tartness upfront ; cocoa and a light roastyness ; modest bitterness .<ssssss>m : light to moderate body , off-dry .<ssssss>d : the aroma be entice , but the flavour would not keep I go .<ssssss>

10 10 8 10 6		get this in the variety case with 6 type .<ssssss>a - pitch black with decent head .<ssssss>really good look schwartz s - mostly roasted malt backbone with a solid chocolate or coffee malt and slight rum but very faint .<ssssss>t - wow very delicious !<ssssss>full of roasted and burt malt along with mild chocolate and coffee with not bitter bite to speak of .<ssssss>m - very thin yet full of flavor .<ssssss>really like it d - if i could see this stock around my town i would drop 12 dollar a sixer easy .<ssssss>very drinkable and succession-able yet i drink through too quick as the two i have be go already .<ssssss>

8 10 8 8 10		a - very dark brown , almost black , with about a half inch of tan head .<ssssss>s - mmm , that be nice !<ssssss>coffee and chocolate aroma predominate , with some dark fruit in the background .<ssssss>there be also something else i can not put my finger on , but it be like a buttery richness almost .<ssssss>whatever it be , it be great .<ssssss>t - burnt malt and bitter coffee be the main flavor at play .<ssssss>the the nondescript richness i notice in the smell be also here , but be not as strong .<ssssss>very dry flavor with a decent amount of bitterness on the finish ; whether the bitterness be a result of hop or or roasted malt , i can not tell .<ssssss>m - a bit thin , but incredibly smooth and well-carbonated .<ssssss>d - very high .<ssssss>at 5 % abv , this could easily be a session beer for I .<ssssss>i would drink this stuff all day .<ssssss>this be simply a fantastic oatmeal stout .<ssssss>if you like stout in any capacity , you definitely need to try this .<ssssss>it be a bit pricey , as i pay 2.89 for the single , 11.5 oz bottle ; otherwise i could make it a everyday drinker .<ssssss>regardless , it be a great stout , and one of the best canadian beer i have have .<ssssss>highly recommend .<ssssss>
9 7 9 10 10		this be about as good as it get for a brown ale .<ssssss>this beer have so much go for it that it truly be a classic and deserve its reputation .<ssssss>the beer pour a nice frothy dark amber brown color with lot of light chocolaty creamy head and some carbonation .<ssssss>there be plenty of retention , but no real lacing , at least in my glass .<ssssss>the smell be not quite up to the level of expectation as the taste .<ssssss>the smell be quite nutty and quite alcoholy , almost a bourbon type smell .<ssssss>the beer taste just great .<ssssss>you will get load of complexity , nice walnut and almond flavor , some heavy fruit , some caramel , chocolate , coffee flavor , and some tinge of yeast .<ssssss>overall , there be a smooth creaminess to this beer that make the mouthfeel and drinkability first rate .<ssssss>other than the smell , which be not all that entice , i can not think of too many other down side .<ssssss>well worth seek out .<ssssss>i would go farther and say that it really be obligatory if you want to experience a genuine british style nut brown ale .<ssssss>l'chaim .<ssssss>

8 8 6 8 8		this be much like the carolina pale ale , but naturally hoppier .<ssssss>there be a good balance between the malt and hop ; it be quite bitter , but there seem to be more flavor hop than anything .<ssssss>unlike the carolina pale ale , i would drink this while out of the state as it be one of the more balancced ipa i have have .<ssssss>
8 9 8 10 8		this one on-tap be much different as it be on the bottle .<ssssss>on tap it be get hit first by a bitter bite , but then malt kick in -- but not overly sweet malt .<ssssss>it be even good enough that my mother and wife enjoy it which be strange come from a hop-head like I .<ssssss>in the bottle it just taste funky .<ssssss>but on tap , it be amazing and well worth the visit .<ssssss>i have it at the yard house and be tell that it be they # 1 ipa , even beat the likes of stone .<ssssss>i can see why it would be -- although the bottle version i would take stone any day .<ssssss>but on-tap , you can ' go wrong with this one !<ssssss>recommend on-tap !<ssssss>

8 7 8 6 8		pour a hazy straw yellow color .<ssssss>a small course , white head top of the the beer .<ssssss>head quickly die to a thin film .<ssssss>the beer smell of malt , yeast , note of honey , lemon , and there be this strange sour funk in there that i can not really place .<ssssss>a bitter husky like flavor be the dominate flavor i get .<ssssss>bready note to , with slight lemony hint , grassy flavor .<ssssss>in the bottle this be a barely above average beer .<ssssss>on tap it be much better , husky flavor be non existant .<ssssss>more of a orangy flavor to it too .<ssssss>if you see it on tap do not hesitate .<ssssss>
5 4 8 5 5		bottle say 2011 , so i have to assume that its this fresh batch to get it out before the holiday .<ssssss>pour be a dark amber color , some bubble and thin lace around , dark for a ipa , but i guess that be what a holiday ipa be i assume .<ssssss>aroma be less aromatic then i expect , do not jump out at you , and have some standard c hop aroma amid some biscuit .<ssssss>less then exciting , sub par for a ipa .<ssssss>flavor be more citrus , the carbonation make it brighter , and the obligatory pine be note , more balanced then other ipa , i would say this be more balanced then most `` east coast '' ipa , really border the pale ale territory , which be what i always think this beer be .<ssssss>i remember liking this beer more when i be just get into craft , either my palate have mature past c hop as a preferance or i get a lame batch .<ssssss>
8 5 8 6 8		orange color with fluffy white head .<ssssss>strong smell of alcohol , cheap adjunct laden lager smell with also hint of cherries/oranges .<ssssss>taste follow through with aundance of alcohol , slightly unblanced but not horrible .<ssssss>for some reason i taste dark cherry , but this kind of surprise I , it must be something else but my head be tell I it be cherries.light body and dirnkable on a hot summer day .<ssssss>
8 5 8 8 6		appearance - pour a dark opaque mahogany hint of amber on the edge .<ssssss>almost like syrup .<ssssss>the head be a sticky off-white head that have some impressive staying power .<ssssss>the beer continue to effervesce for quite a long time .<ssssss>aroma - quite sour .<ssssss>not much else .<ssssss>no malt , no spiciness , nothing .<ssssss>taste - much better tasting than smell .<ssssss>start off with a interesting spiciness with a honey/malty sweetness follow by some kind of grape .<ssssss>hint of raisin and licorice .<ssssss>despite the grapiness and raisin , i would not say i taste much in the way of dark fruit .<ssssss>interesting .<ssssss>mouthfeel - lot of co2 that dissipate very quickly as soon as it hit you tongue .<ssssss>a interesting effect .<ssssss>good , full body .<ssssss>drinkability - worth a shot .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 7		pour dark -lrb- could not see through a 16oz glass -rrb- and have a healthy head even after 3 pour .<ssssss>smell be strong and very nice .<ssssss>fruity and piney at the same time .<ssssss>taste be good with a bitter , piney taste mix with fruit , but finish a bit too bitter for my taste .<ssssss>only the third stone brew i have try , but all seem to finish bitter .<ssssss>you can feel the carbonation on you tongue , follow by the bitterness on the back of you tongue and finally a linger alcohol warmth .<ssssss>not as drinkable as i would like due to the more bitter finish .<ssssss>still worth a entire bottle , but probably would not buy more than one for any particular sit .<ssssss>
5 8 5 6 8		12 oz bottle , no freshness date but i think i have have this one awhile , but always keep cold in my dbf .<ssssss>dark brown color with very little head .<ssssss>slight ring around the edge with a few carbonation bubble attach to the glass .<ssssss>no lacing at all .<ssssss>also look thin .<ssssss>smell be roasted and smoky , name suit the smell well with stovepipe because that be what it smell like .<ssssss>taste be strange for I .<ssssss>it have a long , slow roasted grain taste , but it be almost in between stage , past toast but not char .<ssssss>.<ssssss>hard to explain .<ssssss>i think perhaps if it go a little farther or not quite as far it would have be more please on that note .<ssssss>besides the grain flavor there be some smokiness show through with a slight hop finish at the end .<ssssss>i think mouthfeel be where i find the most issue .<ssssss>it be really thin , almost watery feeling .<ssssss>i almost feel like i could be drink flavored water ... but i guess i be ... anyway , i would have like more body to this , perhaps a bit more carbonation .<ssssss>it be easy to drink , i would have to say that , due to thin body and low abv , but i dont think i would choose it again .<ssssss>
9 6 8 8 9		this beer come a pale honey color with a bit of orange and a slight tan tint .<ssssss>the head be small and there be a bunch of little crater from where single stream of bubble be sustain the head .<ssssss>i think this be the first light beer ive ever have that leave lace like this .<ssssss>that be a bit amazing .<ssssss>smell like crisp sour lemon mix with a slight nip of hop with a light roasted marshmallow base .<ssssss>taste of musky corn and yeast with a well blended bit of caramel sweetness .<ssssss>finish with a dry metallic hop .<ssssss>the mouth feel be light to medium body with lot of crisp carbonation .<ssssss>this be a extremely drinkable beer .<ssssss>for a light beer , the flavor be present and the body be surprisingly thick .<ssssss>and lace ?<ssssss>wow .<ssssss>when view within the confines of a light lager , this be a fantastic beer .<ssssss>
8 10 10 9 8		sample @ dld 2009 a - jet , black with a slight mocha color head .<ssssss>s - absolutely fantastic !<ssssss>huge vanilla note infiltrate the nose and just linger .<ssssss>while it have a huge presence , nice caramel and roasted coffee aroma be still able to come through .<ssssss>probably one of the best smell beer ever .<ssssss>t - very rich , almost too rich .<ssssss>the vanilla be nice in the scent , but could have be less intense on the mouth .<ssssss>aside from the extreme sweetness of the vanilla bean , there be a roasted , oak flavor that compliment the vanilla quite well .<ssssss>there be a lot of complexity go on here , just wish the vanilla be turn down a notch so i could enjoy it all .<ssssss>m - perfect .<ssssss>thick , chewy and velvety smooth .<ssssss>not much more you can ask for with this one .<ssssss>d - alcohol be pretty well hide .<ssssss>what really affect the drinkability be the sweetness , most likely a combination of the vanilla and caramel like flavor .<ssssss>i find myself be overwhelm , especially towards the end of the beer .<ssssss>overall , glad to have the opportunity to try this one .<ssssss>
6 8 4 7 4		pour into a iron hill pint glass .<ssssss>full , yeasty body with a nice scent of citrus , banana , and nutmeg .<ssssss>have a hefeweizen-caliber body that fit the bill better than many area american hefe -lrb- such as lancaster brewing 's hefe -rrb- .<ssssss>very bready and delicate flavor feed into a spicy malt that have a nice sweetness on the back end .<ssssss>a touch tart on the back end , but finish the way a pale wheat should , light and round .<ssssss>my problem be that the tartness offset the basic water component to really give the beer a hint of strangeness to the mouthfeel and finish .<ssssss>further , while it be a great idea to leave the beer unfiltered , the roundness of the beer detract greatly from the crispness i have come to expect from a pale wheat ale .<ssssss>
4 3 6 2 3		some jackass leave a case of this in my fridge after a party .<ssssss>very pale yellow body with no head .<ssssss>smell of cook corn -lrb- dms -rrb- and little else .<ssssss>what flavor there be be stale corn .<ssssss>with a stale corn aftertaste .<ssssss>carbonation be about average for the style .<ssssss>just a awful , awful beer .<ssssss>even within the light macro lager category there be much better example of the style .<ssssss>
8 4 7 8 8		bottle at beerbistro .<ssssss>pour a cloudy russet brown top by a off white head drop sheet of lace .<ssssss>aroma of caramel malt and piney citrus .<ssssss>far from the best ipa in this department .<ssssss>i think warrior might be a better bittering hop than a aroma hop .<ssssss>taste be sprucy , piney and minty bitterness against a crisp toasty caramel malt .<ssssss>great malt profile be let down by the one-note hop as i really get nothing but resinous pine bitterness and not a whole lot more .<ssssss>medium body with a crisp carbonation .<ssssss>this be my first single hop beer -lrb- that intend to showcase a single varietal -rrb- i be glad i have it .<ssssss>it be good .<ssssss>but it be not something i would go out of my way to get again .<ssssss>
5 8 4 5 6		33cl brown glass bottle into trappistenbier goblet in antwerp , belgium .<ssssss>review live .<ssssss>a : one finger head of soft delicate cream and wonderful thickness .<ssssss>bad retention for the style and abv .<ssssss>a solid nontransparent dark black colour .<ssssss>appeal to I , but then this be I favourite style .<ssssss>sm : vanilla , cream , chocolate , toffee , and maybe some musty amber hop .<ssssss>a moderate strength scent .<ssssss>very well execute .<ssssss>bravo .<ssssss>t : chocolate , vanilla , cream , and roasted barley .<ssssss>very short : only one act instead of three .<ssssss>brief but welcome .<ssssss>complex enough but poorly build and balance .<ssssss>mf : coarse and dry , as a stout should be , but not in the right place .<ssssss>it ought to be wet on the open and dry on the finish to encourage the next sip .<ssssss>a bit too coarse for its lack of flavour .<ssssss>dr : low abv , poorly balance , and costly .<ssssss>leave this on the shelf .<ssssss>
8 7 9 6 6		do not a smoked breakfast stout sound good ?<ssssss>it do to I .<ssssss>on to the beer : lookin good .<ssssss>it be pitch black with tan color foam .<ssssss>the head form thick with solid retention and leave several healthy ring of lacing sticking to the glass .<ssssss>the nose be coffeeish , also impart a light bacon aroma , which fit the theme .<ssssss>as far as overall intensity , the overall nose be less intense as its other two sibling .<ssssss>the first few ounce be fine .<ssssss>there be a presence of mocha and a squirt of hop .<ssssss>also present be a subtle note of cure meat .<ssssss>but for the price of the cure meat be a major component of cigarette ash .<ssssss>-lrb- i know this because i once mistake a beer bottle at a get together that be be use as a ashtray , if you will , and put that bottle to my lip instead of the one i be drink from ! -rrb-<ssssss>the other criticsm be the mocha flavor numbing .<ssssss>it be still decent tasting , but far from a world class beer .<ssssss>the ash aftertaste do not help a whole lot .<ssssss>if there be one thing to be proud of , it be the thickish mouthfeel reminiscent of a milkshake .<ssssss>i love the idea of a smoked oatmeal stout .<ssssss>however , i do not enjoy the smoked flavor so overdo that it be basically ash .<ssssss>it be decent overall and do not force you to choke it down ; i simply expect a better beer from mikkeller .<ssssss>

7 4 7 6 6		a - very clear reddish amber with a very thin head s - not very good , lot of malt and caramel sweetness .<ssssss>t - pretty average for the style , a mouthfull of malt and caramel sweetness .<ssssss>m - ok , rich but nothing to write home about .<ssssss>overall , a excellent example of style but nothing particularly special .<ssssss>

8 6 6 8 7		it pour out a light brown with some amber colouration .<ssssss>the head be light and fluffy and cream in colour basically it look like any good ipa should in the glass .<ssssss>a light floral smell and even some sweet caramel come through , but not much really on the smell .<ssssss>the caramel come through on the taste , but this time with more of a roasted sensation - more like toffee and roast nut .<ssssss>there be some bitter come through as well which you would expect from a ipa but the hoppy aftertaste be mute with a residual taste of pepper spice .<ssssss>it have a interesting and refreshing taste but i would have prefer a stronger bitter aftertaste to give this beer more balance .<ssssss>there be nothing amazing in the mouthfeel , with medium body and medium carbonation .<ssssss>comfortable though and could easily sit down to a few of these .<ssssss>
6 8 4 8 7		a - medium orange , not amber , not golden , very decent .<ssssss>s - smell of hop , pine and citrus .<ssssss>-lrb- yes the cliche smell , but not cliche for a east coast beer on the west coast ! -rrb-<ssssss>t/m - taste be incredible , sweet with a nice bitterness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be extremely flat , no effervescence and no head -lrb- but i will not hold it against the brew , i think this come off a old line , especially give the fact there be 60 brew on tap at this place ! -rrb-<ssssss>o - i think this be a damn good beer , and sense that i get a line pour and not a keg pour , hence the flatness .<ssssss>i would try it again pp -lrb- price point -rrb- - $ 7 for a pint , not bad at all , and even though i dont like defend east coast beer , i know this come out of the line and not out of the keg !<ssssss>

9 8 5 4 5		jon 's bottle .<ssssss>no past due date , but i think the bottle pass its shelflife , not through a great hoppy aroma , not through appearance which be cloudy grapefruit with a white head and lacey , but through taste alone .<ssssss>mouthfeel also fairly weak for a double ipa .<ssssss>
9 10 5 10 9		the beer pour a dark brown color , and have a moderately size off-white head .<ssssss>when hold up to the light , i notice a slight reddish tinge around the edge .<ssssss>throughout the glass it have good retention and decent lacing as well .<ssssss>the aroma contain a number of scent , start with a nice combination of roast malt , coffee , cherry , and chocolate .<ssssss>underneath there be hint of caramel , alcohol , biscuit , and apple .<ssssss>at first the beer taste strongly of coffee and dark chocolate .<ssssss>it have a sweetness to it , as well as a round bitterness at the back of the mouth .<ssssss>however , i also detect a fruity flavor underneath that i thought be cherry .<ssssss>there be a strong hop flavor on the side of the tongue .<ssssss>i do not notice much alcohol in it , but it do have a warm quality .<ssssss>the beer develop even more as i continue drinking , yield flavor of roast , dark bread like pumpernickel , cider , and a wooden/earthy flavor that i quite enjoy .<ssssss>i try this beer in two different glass , first be my duvel glass , which i feel would be appropriate .<ssssss>however , after read a article on glassware , i disagree with beer advocate on the recommendation for drink it out of a goblet style glass , so i try it with my pauwel kwak stirrup .<ssssss>in the duvel glass the beer feel very highly carbonated , and be light - almost airy in the mouth .<ssssss>it be thinner in feel than i expect .<ssssss>i also note that it be a little dry .<ssssss>i have read -lrb- can not remember where -rrb- that for beer with higher carbonation , a narrower glass be more appropriate .<ssssss>after try it in the kwak glass , i have to agree that this beer at least be better with a narrower glass .<ssssss>the main difference i notice be that the beer do not feel quite as light in the mouth .<ssssss>it be still light , but it have a more tangible quality to it that help I appreciate the flavor more .<ssssss>i also notice that the roast flavor come out more , and the chocolate flavor get stronger towards the end .<ssssss>visually , it also leave incredible lacing on the narrower glass .<ssssss>all in all , the beer be highly enjoyable .<ssssss>the flavor be so complex and interesting that i feel it be really design to sit down and enjoy sip by sip .<ssssss>savor this one , take it slow , and it will be a wonderful experience .<ssssss>
7 6 8 9 10		a : a murky golden hue , trail of bubble .<ssssss>s : citrusy hop , t : a refreshing ipa after a voyage in maltier territory .<ssssss>tastily friendly , and not overpower bitterness : a balanced breww .<ssssss>m : great hoppy body , though not devoid of malt .<ssssss>complex mix of tone from the hop .<ssssss>d : one sip only invite another .<ssssss>
8 8 8 6 7		a - pour into a 6oz pilsner-style sampler glass , show a hazy straw-yellow complexion with a glint of green around the edge .<ssssss>a low bit of fizzy eggshell head that dissipate like a sparkling wine .<ssssss>otherwise , not a lot of visible carbonation .<ssssss>s - aroma carry ample amount of dry drupe fruit -lrb- mostly apricot -rrb- and a bit of tart red apple skin .<ssssss>there seem to be a whiff of musky grape character , not unlike a riesling .<ssssss>there be really almost no indication of the extremely high alcohol content in the nose at this temperature , but perhaps that will change .<ssssss>t - a rush of mouth-wateringly sweet dried/candied fruit open up the palate , follow by pass note of german dessert wine and floral booziness .<ssssss>the sweetness be thick enough to hide much of the alcohol -lrb- or at least relegate it to a painless flash of warmth -rrb- , and i be unsure as to whether or not i like it that way .<ssssss>i really do not taste much hop character here at all ... i be sure three month on the shelf roll off a portion of the hop character but i have trouble believe that it be ever all that much hoppier than this .<ssssss>if there be any bitterness at all here , it be unfortunately lose to the overwhelming white raisin-y dextrin that dominate this beer .<ssssss>fortunately , the saccharine overload be relatively brief , and a very pleasant dry sweetness of apple rind finish off the palate .<ssssss>m - the mouthfeel be quite thick , though surprisingly dry for the amount of sugar present .<ssssss>as mention before , the carbonation be adequate in move the palate along and bring about a pleasant finish , but the beer also retain a reasonable amount of ` chew ' for those of we treat this vino-typical brew as a wine .<ssssss>o - i be glad to have have the opportunity to snag a few of these just to see what the fuss be about , but i do not think this be the beer for I .<ssssss>a very interesting piece of work to sip on , but the flavor here be just too out of balance and overpoweringly sweet to be able to enjoy any more than 6oz or so of this at a time .<ssssss>i understand how difficult it must be to tame a beast of this high alcohol content while juggle the unusual technique of 120 minute of hop during a boil , but the impressiveness of the feat do not quite make up for the lack of finesse that the brew carry .<ssssss>
8 7 8 10 9		a : very dark with a quickly dissolve head s : light burnt grain , coffe , licorice smell t : very rich burnt grain , coffee and hoppy tone .<ssssss>m : smooth but could possibly be creamier .<ssssss>d : this be a great beer .<ssssss>when pair with a asian chicken salad it taste more like a hoppy porter and when pair with very spice pizza it taste like a dark ipa .<ssssss>i love the versatility of this beer .<ssssss>
9 6 8 4 5		get a 12oz single of brown 's ipa at hoosick beverage in troy ny for $ 2.65 .<ssssss>with a moderate pour this hazy copper color brew give a nice 1 '' of hearty light tan head that create crater and thick globby lace as it slowly slowly settle .<ssssss>great retention and great lace .<ssssss>nose be candy pine , diacetyl , and raw grain .<ssssss>on the tongue it be a bit heavy with diacetyl for the style , border on offensive as it clash with the hop .<ssssss>try to ignore the butter they be tangle up with , the hop be a nice bitter resiny pine and grapefruit .<ssssss>mouthfeel be good all around - enough carbo to temper the bitterness , moderately thick , finish dry .<ssssss>the diacetyl here be a major flaw , it seriously clash with the hop and muddy the whole thing up .<ssssss>a damn shame .<ssssss>the smallest change could make this a great beer .<ssssss>so close , yet so far away .<ssssss>

9 6 8 8 8		a fine , economical alternative to true belgian .<ssssss>thin mouthfeel , delicate tingly carbonation , confuse almost skunky nose , but a surprisingly true taste .<ssssss>very similar to other we make ` belgian ' style , particularly alagash 's tripel .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>alcohol taste be present , but not overpowering -lrb- clipper city 's site proclaim a abv of % 8.25 -rrb- .<ssssss>typical over-ripe banana nose meet cleanly with light aromatic .<ssssss>again , complex but confuse .<ssssss>definitely worth a try as a summer seasonal .<ssssss>a fine long summer evening relaxation drink .<ssssss>

8 10 8 6 6		a-pours a jet black color with nice 1 finger off white head that dissapate quickly .<ssssss>great lacing .<ssssss>s-wow be all i can say .<ssssss>it smell like someone just stick a creme brulee in my mouth .<ssssss>have vanilla , carmel , roasted coffee and chocholate note .<ssssss>smeel heavenly t - have a nice sweetnee upfront then follow by the roasted burnt coffee taste folow by more sugary creme brulee sweetness m-medium body with a silk smooth feel in the mouth d-overall this beer have soo many thing good go for it .<ssssss>it look great , smell great , but do not taste great .<ssssss>it be just way too sweet .<ssssss>im glad i open this between 4 people or i would of never be able to finish it .<ssssss>i think next time they should only add 2 pound of sugar to the batch instead of 20 !<ssssss>im excite to try other stuff from they .<ssssss>but this be too much .<ssssss>i can sip on about 8 oz or so of this but then im do .<ssssss>
6 9 6 9 7		i receive this as a extra a few month back , but sadly can not remember who throw it in the box .<ssssss>whoever you may have be , thanks for the beer !<ssssss>review be from note take on 7/27/2010 and pour from the bottle to a snifter .<ssssss>appearance : pour be a deep dark dirty brown/near black and look about the color of use motor oil -lrb- mind you , it do not look as thick as use motor oil , though -rrb- ; despite a vigorous pour , no head whatsoever ; body be entirely opaque and base upon no head , i would say it look pretty flat ; no lacing , just a oily film that quickly slide back into the beer .<ssssss>smell : pretty nice , and quite strong -- nice strong and roasty burnt expresso ; dark semi-sweet syrupy chocolate ; a bit of dark cherry and lactic sourness as it continue to warm ... i be intrigue ... taste : start of pretty plain and standard with the nice espresso roastiness -lrb- nothing special right of the first sip though -rrb- ; however , the syrupy chocolate and dark cherry and a certain sourness -lrb- could be a bit of sour cherry , but it strike I as more of a lactic sourness -rrb- creep in and really , in my opinion , brighten the beer 's profile quite nicely .<ssssss>mouthfeel : sigh ... never as thick as i would like , but the body be of medium weight ; no carbonation , so it feel very flat , oily and slick ; a moderate and semi-moist stickiness be leave all over the palate .<ssssss>drinkability : not too shabby overall , especially if i really consider the smell and flavor ; it do need some head and carbonation though , and damn it , i really want a thicker stout ; while my number be kind of all over the place on this , i do believe it be worth check out .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 8		pour a dark copper/amber color with about a one finger head on it .<ssssss>good lacing as well .<ssssss>smell be very fruity .<ssssss>nice aroma .<ssssss>some hop come through .<ssssss>very citrusy as well .<ssssss>taste be very good .<ssssss>good hop flavor throughout , not overpower though .<ssssss>mouthfeel be light-medium .<ssssss>this be a lighter ipa .<ssssss>go down smooth and easy .<ssssss>i enjoy this beer overall .<ssssss>a solid ipa .<ssssss>i would definitely drink this again .<ssssss>
9 7 8 9 7		pour a bright , active yellow amber with a thick , substantial head that leave lot of lacing .<ssssss>big hop -lrb- pine pitch -rrb- aroma on the nose , with yeast as its only counterpoint .<ssssss>this be one helluva bitter beer on the palate -- way out of balance , but not unpleasantly so .<ssssss>citrus flavor come in first , follow by grapefruit , with a finish that display just a touch of crackery malt -- the only note in this brew that sound of malt .<ssssss>mouthfeel be quite astringent , nearly puckering , with a active , buzzy finish .<ssssss>if you like ipa , this one will probably be drinkable for you ; if you be not as enthusiastic -lrb- like I -rrb- it might be hard to put away a bunch of these .<ssssss>
8 7 4 6 4		thanks to lurchingbeast for this one : as a extra !<ssssss>!<ssssss>white wax : 2011 a : pour a whiskey orange with a three finger head which resonate for quite some time .<ssssss>the head be burnt cream color of thick , fine viscosity .<ssssss>lacing be excellent .<ssssss>s : the smell of hop burst toward I upon crack this beer even before pour .<ssssss>pine , resin , grapefruit , caramel malt .<ssssss>pretty standard combo , but well present .<ssssss>t : sweet , alcoholic , sweet , alcoholic .<ssssss>the citrus of the hop come through after a bit , but nonetheless , the alcohol be not well address in this beer .<ssssss>m : slick and medium body with low-medium carbonation .<ssssss>the beer leave the mouth slick for a moment , then dry for the finish .<ssssss>d : the beer be okay .<ssssss>the alcohol be poorly conceal .<ssssss>i be disappointed .<ssssss>too sweet for a fresh barleywine .<ssssss>i can see why many enjoy the beer -lrb- presume those who like this also find hopslam and twoheart , pliny to be the best of the best out there - sweet -rrb- .<ssssss>can not say it be for I though .<ssssss>

9 6 6 5 8		pour from a bottle into a imperial .<ssssss>pour a medium straw with crystal clariity and a decent head that cling very well .<ssssss>aroma be the ususal tannic acid , iced tea malt and hop mix , nothing new or outstanding .<ssssss>flavor be malt that have a light dm favor that yield to light hop in the middle and finish dry .<ssssss>the malt be crackery and slightly doughy , but weak and there be that dm flavor that i can not get rid of on my tongue .<ssssss>hop be pretty weak for what the bottle promise .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium and carbonation be adequate , pretty meh .<ssssss>overall i be not too impressed with this beer , it be good but not on the ipa level in my opinion .<ssssss>
8 9 6 7 7		a - medium brown and very clear .<ssssss>the head be tan and diminish quickly and leave no lacing .<ssssss>s - smell be toast malt and sweet caramel .<ssssss>nut be there in the background .<ssssss>no hop evident .<ssssss>very clean and pleasant .<ssssss>t - somewhat grainy , likely from the roasted specialty grain or the pecan .<ssssss>caramel sweetness at the back end .<ssssss>no hop evident .<ssssss>m - a little thin .<ssssss>some mouthcoating sweetness in the finish .<ssssss>a hint of hop-bitterness in the background .<ssssss>d - interesting beer with some complex flavor .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a little thin for my liking , but a respectable variation on a english brown .<ssssss>
10 8 7 8 10		the higlight of this beer be hand down its appearance and drinkability ... especially for a big ipa ... pour a crystal clear burnt orange with a constant carbonation ... gorgeous white head which lace perfectly ... as nice look of a beer as you will ever get ... surprisingly you get a strong malted backbone to the nose with expect citrus and piney hop ... very delicious ipa overall with the piney hop give a wonderful aftertaste ... the malt kind of confuse the mouthfeel of this beer , but overall a great choice ... i give this a exceptional rating for drinkability for several reason ... for one , the price be great ... second , the beer be balanced , high abv but not too complex for the ipa lover ... you will really enjoy this beer ... buy at the local harris teeter at under $ 10/six pack and drinking while watch danica patrick wreck in a nationwide race -lrb- she suck ... . -rrb-<ssssss>...<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 9		when pour into a pilsner glass you can really get a look at the rich golden color .<ssssss>this beer be a easy drink with a good aftertaste .<ssssss>unfortunately , i have to cross the border to pa because they do not sell this beer in my hometown .<ssssss>one of my regular .<ssssss>

8 8 8 10 9		20oz .<ssssss>imperial pint at the dilly deli .<ssssss>review from note .<ssssss>a : golden pale straw , cloudy .<ssssss>decent head , retention , and lacing .<ssssss>s : lot of yeasty ester , juicy fruit .<ssssss>pleasant sweetness .<ssssss>t/m : spice hop and crisp , clean malt .<ssssss>some belgian spice and a grassy , lemony flavor .<ssssss>sweetness be nice and compliment the yeasty ester nicely .<ssssss>light , crisp body with strong , fitting carbonation .<ssssss>d : extremely drinkable and taste great .<ssssss>
6 5 8 6 6		poor head retention this time around .<ssssss>colour about on par .<ssssss>nose still have sweet trait but they have ease off .<ssssss>similar story to taste - super easy go sweeter but have certainly tighten up and have a nice spice edge .<ssssss>i have have a few skuncky bottle of this over the year .<ssssss>
8 7 10 8 6		a - clear very dark cocoa brown top by a light tan doughy head with a rocky surface and load of thick lace .<ssssss>s - dark chocolate and mineral water , a touch of coffee , some mild citric hop , brown sugar , burnt cookie , sandalwood , and brandy cherry .<ssssss>t - big chocolate and woodsy flavor , hard water , mild coffee bitterness , and enough earthy citrus hop flavor to pull through nicely .<ssssss>alcohol flavor be evident behind all the malt sweetness , but they be not too overbearing and they remind I of french vodka .<ssssss>cocoa and roasted flavor give way to zesty hop bitterness in the finish .<ssssss>mf - this be one creamy brew !<ssssss>full and expansive in the mouth , and the low level -lrb- albeit prickly -rrb- carbonation barely push through the sludge until the swallow .<ssssss>this stuff seem thicker than heavy cream and very heavy , closer to eggnog or or a cream sauce that have be slightly reduce .<ssssss>other reviewer be state it to be thin but i be not get that at all .<ssssss>rather slippery as well but leave a coating feeling as it dry .<ssssss>d - it be almost a month past christmas and i do not get a stock , but if i do this would not have be a bad stuffer .<ssssss>possibly the biggest english stout i have have , and by that i mean considerable alcohol content and body but with flavor and aroma that be par for the course .<ssssss>i would not call it close to imperial , but it definitely pack a boozy kick that be warm to say the least .<ssssss>one and do for I , i have be a bad elf this year .<ssssss>
8 6 4 4 6		pour into a tumbler it produce a small head with scant lacing .<ssssss>the appearance be amber brown and clear .<ssssss>the aroma be faintly malty with little in the way of hop .<ssssss>the taste be lightly malty with little or no alcoholic warmth .<ssssss>the feel be surprisingly light body with a watery finish .<ssssss>this doppelbock seem to have be brew in the light body american lager tradition .<ssssss>it be a bit of a different take on the style .<ssssss>it would be a good choice in hot weather .<ssssss>
7 7 9 7 7		22 oz .<ssssss>bottle into a snifter p : very dark , pecan brown with garnet highlight on the edge .<ssssss>a vigorous pour produce 2 finger worth of dark cream-colored foam that be pretty thick and creamy .<ssssss>show average retention and leave little lace .<ssssss>a : nice roasted malt with lot of coffee , chocolate , caramel , and a surprising amount of citrusy hop .<ssssss>a little bit of booze be notice as it warm .<ssssss>what be there smell promising , but it be really lack in the strength department .<ssssss>t : taste exactly like you would think a beer name `` cappucino stout '' would taste like ; as if someone pour a mocha cappucino into a stout .<ssssss>malt be lightly roasted , nowhere near be burnt or acrid and the chocolate and coffee taste especially sweet together .<ssssss>i suppose that be why they add so much citrusy hop in there , to try and balance it out with some bitterness .<ssssss>i be almost shock at how pronounced they be !<ssssss>and even though i be a hophead through and through , i just do not think all of the flavor meld very well in this particular case .<ssssss>underneath all of this be some earthy-like musky note , some molasses and a smidgeon of booze as well .<ssssss>m : the body of this one be a tad below be full , with a milky smooth , rich & creamy texture to it that fit the beer well .<ssssss>note : well , i be a sucker for mocha cappucino 's , so i think i would absolutely love a cappucino stout .<ssssss>to the contrary .<ssssss>while this be a solid effort from one of my favorite brewery , i think it miss the mark just a bit .<ssssss>the chocolatey cappucino flavor be good , but they do not feel like they come close to reach they full potential .<ssssss>and the citrusy hop just do not help matter , in my opinion .<ssssss>everything seem kind of scatter out and never really meld together like it should have .<ssssss>a solid effort , but not one i feel the need to drink again .<ssssss>
9 10 7 7 8		22oz bottle with a black crown that have a green leaf on it .<ssssss>a - dark orange with a 1 and half finger head , off white in color .<ssssss>s - this smell awesome , pine , grass , and slightly floral .<ssssss>very intense .<ssssss>t - a bit of let down after the smell .<ssssss>sweet up front , with a nice pine hop finish .<ssssss>d - creamy , and no bitterness .<ssssss>o - smell be awesome , taste be a letdown after that , but still a good ipa .<ssssss>
5 9 8 7 7		a - a very cloudy orange/amber .<ssssss>a thick , creamy off white head do not last long at all .<ssssss>the head actually make the fizzing sound that soft drink make before it quickly recede .<ssssss>s - quite strong clove and banana aroma , with the balance lean towards the clove .<ssssss>a background tartness provide a great balance to the sweetness .<ssssss>note of grain from the wheat .<ssssss>t - again , the balance of the flavour lean towards the clove and spice .<ssssss>i feel the banana flavour could be slightly better balanced with the spice .<ssssss>support well by grainy wheat .<ssssss>low hop bitterness/flavours .<ssssss>again slightly tart .<ssssss>m - high carbonation , medium-light mouth .<ssssss>very spritzy .<ssssss>d - slightly too effervescent for I .<ssssss>note - this one remind I of orange berocca !<ssssss>it be quite good , but some out of balance characteristic keep this from be great .<ssssss>it be slightly too spritzy and the important flavour be not present well enough .<ssssss>the aroma promise so much more .<ssssss>
8 4 6 8 8		yuengle lager be right up there with one of my all time favorite , albeit mass produce , beer .<ssssss>beer pour from tap have a rich amber color with moderate carbonation and a head that be very thin .<ssssss>have a small ` ring ' that remain until about half the glass be leave .<ssssss>i could barely detect any smell at all and the taste be smooth , sweet , and consistent even when the beer warm .<ssssss>not the most complex of beer , but definitely head and shoulder above a lot of the mass produce american lager that yuengle sit next to in you grocery beer aisle .<ssssss>
8 8 9 10 7		most folk , myself include , probably do not know that stingo be a older word that mean old ale or old beer .<ssssss>seem appropriate for this beer , which be apparently age for a entire year in samuel smith 's famous yorkshire square .<ssssss>i be use a goblet for this one tonight , as a special beer deserve a special glass .<ssssss>pour a murky and ruddy amber .<ssssss>carbonation level be pretty high , as there be a constant stream of bubble pop up from the bottom of the glass .<ssssss>no real head on this beer , just bubble on the outer rim of the glass .<ssssss>aroma be rich , deep , and pungent .<ssssss>you can really pick out the oak , which add a nice earth characteristic .<ssssss>the first taste be simply incredible .<ssssss>flavor profile be stunningly complex , with load of molasses , dark cherry , raisin , oak , and tobacco clamoring for attention on the palate .<ssssss>this beer have the perfect amount of carbonation to keep the mouthfeel balanced , as the heavy flavor profile and malt profile could easily become syrupy if leave alone .<ssssss>happily that be not the case here , though the heavy alcohol warmth make this a sip beer .<ssssss>samuel smith 's have do it again , create a textbook example of a classic english style - in the case of yorkshire stingo , the old ale .<ssssss>highly recommend .<ssssss>

8 4 7 6 6		pour this beer in a glass be probably the best thing about it !<ssssss>it be pretty cool to see the beer transform before my eye .<ssssss>appearance be dark as night with a nice creamy head throughout the entire session .<ssssss>the aroma be of roasted malt and smoke .<ssssss>the taste remind I of black coffee with a very dry finish .<ssssss>overall the low alcohol and calorie be nice , but the i feel the best way to partake of this stout be through a black and tan .<ssssss>i still need to get out to ireland and drink the original there !<ssssss>
10 8 7 9 9		a - super dense off white head , great lacing , nice maple syrup color .<ssssss>it look like you could float a quarter on this one .<ssssss>a bit of a haze which look invite .<ssssss>s-raisin , dark candi sugar , grainy bready worty , carmel and alcohol , super complex .<ssssss>t - plum , dark fruit , fig , sweet , alcohol , low bitterness , a bit of cherry and super clean .<ssssss>m - cloying , alcohol , great carbonation , o - great beer , this one would lay down super nice and the alcohol would die down a bit .<ssssss>super good and exactly to style .<ssssss>

6 9 7 6 4		pour dark black with little head and little lacing .<ssssss>scent be very pronounced - caramel and vanilla .<ssssss>it be something i could not stop smell just because of the uniqueness .<ssssss>the taste be of caramel , butterscotch , and then mocha .<ssssss>very sweet .<ssssss>i find it somewhat hard to judge the taste since it be very unique and complex - but it be just overwhelming .<ssssss>it be medium-thick-bodied and seem somewhat syrupy , but this might just be a result of the mental association with the sweet taste .<ssssss>i enjoy how unique this be , but it be not something i can drink a lot of , it be just too sweet and overwhelming .<ssssss>i be unable to finish a 22oz in one sit .<ssssss>
6 6 4 7 6		batch e !<ssssss>029 pour into glass at about 45-55 degree .<ssssss>aggressive pour yield short , soapy white head that fade quickly over a cloudy golden body .<ssssss>nice lacing .<ssssss>aroma be fairly faint for the style .<ssssss>sweet with lot of honey , and floral/herbal hop .<ssssss>thick on the palate with low carbonation .<ssssss>flavor carry a definite herbal bitterness , but the sweetness seem to be separate .<ssssss>it definitely go from sweet fruit up front -lrb- mango especially -rrb- to increasingly bitter -lrb- minty & floral -rrb- in the middle , and then astringently bitter linger finish -lrb- blood orange peel -rrb- .<ssssss>pretty sticky overall .<ssssss>i feel bad give this one `` average '' score , since i be sure ithaca do not necessarily brew this to be a true-to-form dipa .<ssssss>it be pretty tasty overall .<ssssss>
5 4 9 6 8		this one be also courtesy of indybeer .<ssssss>thanks !<ssssss>pour out a medium-toned , peachy-looking amber .<ssssss>warm , hazy bottom , with a weak film head on top .<ssssss>grassy , citrus aroma with a hint of linger malt .<ssssss>very simple , straight-forward aroma , and a overall weak nose .<ssssss>splash of water hit the tongue first , with a bit of carbonation , follow by the grassy , citrus note and some malt .<ssssss>crisp , with a hop finish and bite , pair with a toast character .<ssssss>linger grapefruit , but again , not a whole lot else .<ssssss>buttery smooth mouthfeel really save this brew for I , because otherwise , this one be about average .<ssssss>a tone down ipa , and yeah , it be not like a english mild .<ssssss>
7 7 6 8 9		pour a nice deep brown with some reddish tone to it , top off with a thin light tan head that do not ever go away , and leave a little lace behind .<ssssss>malty aroma with a little roast barley and belgian yeast note in it .<ssssss>just a hint of malt sweetness in the flavor , perfectly offset the draw between hop and roast grain bitterness .<ssssss>a slight prickly sourness from the carbonation playing at the side of the tongue that help keep this a mild and refreshing quaff .<ssssss>if it be not for a kgrtr full of other interesting bottle to try and four keg of homebrew , i would be disappointed i have only one bottle of this .<ssssss>a definite session beer , even if do top the magic 5 % abv number by a few tenth .<ssssss>
8 9 6 7 7		pour into a impy pint glass a darker shade of brown with some dark orange tint a craterouslight brown one finger head atop that settle quickly into a creamy-like mass.big caramel note when the bottle be first pop open fruity ester begin to settle in after a bit as well as some engran brown sugar hop peak thru with a hint of herbalness.a somewhat sharp mouthfeel sting a little at first seem a bit fizzy , the mouthfeel take away from the flavor a bit in my book its malt tilted no doubt caramel and borwn sugar sweetness dominate the alcohol show itslf no doubt with a finish burn honestly i dont pick up alot of hop presence other than a hint of herb in the finish.it start out promising but seed to fizzle out a bit no pun intend still not all bad .<ssssss>
4 4 7 4 4		i be just not a fan of fruit beer at all .<ssssss>pour from 12 oz bottle into pint glass .<ssssss>pour a red color with a small pinkish head .<ssssss>aroma be of quite fruity and fairly tart , the raspberry and strawberry be what i smell the most along with some sugary note .<ssssss>the flavor be slightly tart and very fruity with alot of raspberry along with some sugary note and the 9 % abv be really well hide .<ssssss>the body be light with a slightly dry mouthfeel .<ssssss>overall a pretty solid fruit beer , but fruit beer like this arent really my style , this be more fruit than beer imo .<ssssss>
8 3 6 8 8		nice sam adam clone .<ssssss>boring , but nothing wrong with it .<ssssss>if you be gon na choose between the two , choose this one .<ssssss>i be sure this one 's pay the bill for they over there in lakewood .<ssssss>get ta have that lager , or else the non-beer drinker will say `` you beer be good , but ever think of do a regular one ?<ssssss>i love the boston lager ''<ssssss>
9 6 9 10 9		part of a autumn tasting @ grapevine in fort mill , sc .<ssssss>pour from a bomber to a pint .<ssssss>thick , dark and rich appearance , as a porter should be with a nice creamy head .<ssssss>nose be very subtle and belie the complexity of this porter once it hit the palatte .<ssssss>espresso note be immediate with toast malt .<ssssss>there be a bourbony , savory , sour oaky finish that linger and develop as the beer warm .<ssssss>drinkable to the nth degree .<ssssss>one of the best porter i have have base on it be appearance and layer of flavor .<ssssss>
6 4 4 6 5		this be you typical mass-produiced , highly advertise big beer with golden yellow pour , high carbonationa and grainy nose and flavor .<ssssss>bottom line .<ssssss>.<ssssss>its a okay beer for the price , when consume from a ice cold mug on a hot day .<ssssss>beyond that , let it go .<ssssss>
8 7 7 9 8		orange-gold appearance .<ssssss>semi-opaque .<ssssss>aroma of honey , fresh grass , and hop .<ssssss>big hop taste , with nice trade off of honey and crisp pilsner dryness .<ssssss>medium heavy , yet refreshing mouthfeel .<ssssss>this play well to my hop-head side , but i be impress with the dimensional taste element for this beer .<ssssss>a reminder from sa that they can still produce edgy , small batch style craft beer when they want to .<ssssss>
8 6 3 5 4		appearance - nice ruby/brown color , impressive head that stay on the beer long after the pour smell - slightly malty , a bit of toffee taste - light malt , smooth with a metallic , almost sour kick at the end ... be it the yeast or the whatever low amount of hop use for the style ?<ssssss>mouthfeel - the metallic/sour aftertaste kill it for I , otherwise it would be very drinkable , though not impressive drinkability - pretty much the same as above<ssssss>
8 5 8 8 9		i try to pour this one into a duvel glass but break it when it slip out of my wet hand - already a mark against this one !<ssssss>then pour into a piraat glass -lrb- no sense in risk my other two duvel glass -rrb- .<ssssss>the color be a cloudy pink grapefruit color with a light head despite the hearty carbonation .<ssssss>i really have to pour it with vigor to form a head on this one .<ssssss>the smell be grainy with absolutely no fruit aroma whatsoever .<ssssss>i be expect to be knock down by fruit ester but alas nothing .<ssssss>i think founder should have add some cherry to the final boil and maybe even add some crushed fruit to the bottle to add a little more cherry essence .<ssssss>the flavor be amazing .<ssssss>you obviously get cherry but you also get tart citrus , dry pinot grigio note , oaky chardonay , and dry fruit .<ssssss>if this be wild fermented it would be a major hype beer - something to think about founder .<ssssss>mouthfeel be light but a touch undercarbonate for I .<ssssss>i would also like a more creamy consistency with the fruit beer - boone do this nicely .<ssssss>i would imagine this would be fantastic on tap with nitrogen .<ssssss>drinkability be high because it be fruity , cold , and light in the mouth .<ssssss>on a hot day this be a great summer beer .<ssssss>
8 9 7 7 9		p - al 's of hampden a - a mahogany copper color .<ssssss>quite clear and a foamy head that stick to the side of glass like spiderweb lacing .<ssssss>s - a lot go on here .<ssssss>i get some citrus and pine hop but then there be chocolate , herbal and floral aroma as well as a sweet brown sugar like smell .<ssssss>t - the taste be complex as well .<ssssss>citrus and pine be at the forefront but then the other aroma i could detect dont shine as well .<ssssss>its like they all mix together .<ssssss>m - sweet and dry .<ssssss>hoppy yet very smooth d - this be a good beer from stone and i have become a fan .<ssssss>i could pound these back all day .<ssssss>
8 9 9 7 8		pour a hazy deep golden hay color with a amber tint to it , and a nice cap of tight fuzzy white .<ssssss>smell of a very light sugared cherry sweetness mix with sweet oak , and a very light cherry sourness mix with farmyard funk and yeasty golden fruit .<ssssss>spicy oak barrel and black pepper complete the package .<ssssss>flavor bring light doughy and cherry sweetness along with yeast .<ssssss>a touch of sourness and funk as well with a solid black peppery-oak spiciness .<ssssss>full body and a nice chewy-creamy carbonation go down real smooth .<ssssss>i really enjoy this one .<ssssss>i be glad that the cherry come through as subtly as it do since i be not the biggest fruit infuse fan on the block .<ssssss>this be definitely one of my favorite st offering to date .<ssssss>

8 5 8 5 5		huge piney hop aroma let I know right from the begin that i have a west coast approach on my hand .<ssssss>dark brown to black body with a firm thumb thick mocha head .<ssssss>bitterness be more from hop than roast in the fore .<ssssss>some chocolate malt throught he middle , but mostly this be just a big hop bomb of a imperial ... or what i like to call a ipa/stout .<ssssss>i can appreciate that some people like hoppy beer , but when i pay $ 18 for a imperial stout and all i get be a dark ipa it irk ne ... whatever .<ssssss>perhaps with age this could become a solid brew , but right now this be just a hop up mess and have next to none of the flavor youd expect in a imperial stout .<ssssss>
10 9 6 6 6		huge one inch , almost brown , head darkest i have ever see .<ssssss>big aroma - toast , dark chocolate , strong , bitter coffee .<ssssss>unfortunately , the aroma and appearance do not live up to the taste of this beer .<ssssss>to be honest i be a little disappointed .<ssssss>could not taste much oatmeal until it realy warm up .<ssssss>be quite dry .<ssssss>it be ok , but i obviously do not like it as much as most other reviewer .<ssssss>i have another bottle , which i re-rate in a couple of week .<ssssss>

6 6 6 3 3		a : clear copper with a small head s : very citrus and for some reason with ipa i always seem to think i be in a flower shop or something t : very bitter like grapefruit and floral taste with a good deal of bitterness .<ssssss>the combination be too much for my palate to deal with m : it feel average , slightly thin with a semi clean finish d : for some reason it be hard for I to really appreciate what be consider a ipa .<ssssss>its just so much its hard to really set back and enjoy it .<ssssss>not my style by any stretch , but if you be into ipa 's i suppose why not give this one a shot .<ssssss>... in a after thought , maybe its because i do not like grapefruit ...<ssssss>

9 6 9 8 8		i be serve this beer at couchon 's restaurant in new orlean , my home town .<ssssss>the comment from other be spot on , for I .<ssssss>clean , simple , and perhaps lack in presence .<ssssss>sometimes , when i grab a stout i do want a deeper flavor profile .<ssssss>on the other hand , there be time that this one would be just right .<ssssss>the abv % be good enough to get that relax feeling.plus absolutely no hint of the taste of alcohol .<ssssss>the texture set a good background for eat cuisine that already have bold flavor , such as that local nola eatery .<ssssss>and , my memory be that there be a nice finish to this beer .<ssssss>a safe and secure beer that have its place .<ssssss>have say that , i do wish that they would experiment to let one note stand out , while still maintain a good balance .<ssssss>nothing provocative but something slightly more distinguish would be in order .<ssssss>if this be a beer in progress i sure hope that it make its way to kentucky in bottle or tap .<ssssss>i would definitely keep it in stock .<ssssss>

7 4 7 5 5		well , a party beer here .<ssssss>pour a light straw color , but with a watery transparency , it be clear , without haze , and have a thin white head .<ssssss>there be not much aroma hear , some yeast aroma whichn be somewhat breadlike , nothing off , but almost no aroma at all .<ssssss>flavor be much more of the same .<ssssss>almost no flavor whatsoever , and very little aftertaste .<ssssss>the body be thin .<ssssss>for the style i be sure this be a typical example -lrb- thus my middle of the road score -rrb- , but i would hace to say there should be some flavor , otherwise it be pointless to drink this , it might just be that this beer be a good example of what be inherently wrong with the style of beer -lrb- make solely to easily get people drunk -rrb- .<ssssss>
9 8 5 8 7		appearance - black opaque into a belgian glass .<ssssss>a mocha finger of head fade back to a mostly full , thin cover and solid collar .<ssssss>some wavy rope of lace .<ssssss>aroma - big roasty sniff of grain and dark chocolate syrup .<ssssss>taste - roasted grain dominate , dark chocolate in support .<ssssss>a good deep roast with no char , excellent .<ssssss>the roastiness continue into the aftertaste and finish about the same , a occasional presence of alcohol .<ssssss>not the most profound profile , but good nonetheless .<ssssss>mouthfeel - thin for a i.s .<ssssss>with some detectable smoothness .<ssssss>could use more body .<ssssss>drinkability - there be lot better in style , but pretty tasty .<ssssss>
7 4 6 4 7		pour from bottle into a irish pub pint glass , nice pale golden straw color with a descent fluffy bright white head and descent lacing .<ssssss>apricot have the floor in the aroma department with some malty hop in the background .<ssssss>again with the apricot hold the floor in the flavor department as well , but intrestingly enough there be a solid backbone of beer in there.the malt support the fruit very well for the style and with just a kiss of hop bittering .<ssssss>carbonation be in full swing , a little heavier than i prefer but not bad .<ssssss>a little thin but with a nice dry finish .<ssssss>a enjoyable beer for the style and could session i think.possibly a very refreshing summer afternoon brew but right now the style be do nothing for I .<ssssss>
7 3 6 4 4		the last of the three gift beer from a ukiah local !<ssssss>pour a typical clear amber with orange highlight .<ssssss>i rough up the pour to give it a moderate head that disappear quicker than be should and leave no lace .<ssssss>not much in the aroma department .<ssssss>i glance at a few review before start my own , and i agree with several that compare it to a macro lager 's aroma .<ssssss>search hard yield only vague malt aroma that be not very ale-like .<ssssss>this beer be not disappear very quickly , because it be one of the worst tasting beer i have ever have .<ssssss>a disappointment for my 150th review , but this be about as drain-pour worthy craft beer as i have ever have .<ssssss>lot of unpleasant , soapy bitterness from front to back .<ssssss>very little malt flavor to be have .<ssssss>there be a bit of lemon rind come out in the bittering hop at the end .<ssssss>medium body and little carbonation make little impression .<ssssss>if anything , the finish be too long because it prolong unpleasant flavor .<ssssss>i think i would rather have a beer that taste like nothing than have big flavor that be bad .<ssssss>this beer be obviously not a standout among its peer by review , but i wonder if i get a bad bottle , or it come from a bad batch .<ssssss>of the three mendocino beer i have have , eye of the hawk be mediocre at best , white hawk be quite good and red tail be terrible .<ssssss>pretty inconsistent .<ssssss>the brewery 's beer be not readily available in my area , but i probably would not be buy much of they if they be .<ssssss>
5 6 8 5 7		silly I .<ssssss>think this be go to be a dark beer , since the beer look dark from the outside , but of course , it be the bottle that be dark .<ssssss>oh well , let 's give this a try .<ssssss>appearance : very nice bottle with gold trim around the top .<ssssss>pour a attractive golden color with virtually no head or lacing .<ssssss>smell : smell clean .<ssssss>vegetable and hop scent .<ssssss>taste : not too flavorful at all .<ssssss>again , there be the hop flavor and the corn linger in the background .<ssssss>nothing complex .<ssssss>mouthfeel : thin , but not as thin as many other mexican beer out there .<ssssss>low carbonation consider the beer 's thinness .<ssssss>work out well , though .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be probably what make this such a thirst-quenching and crisp beer .<ssssss>drinkability : this beer go down very easy .<ssssss>there be nothing offensive about it , and it certainly beat a corona , and even a dos equi .<ssssss>still , there be nothing really exciting here that be go to make I come back to it .<ssssss>
8 7 5 8 8		straight pour from a pry-off 22oz bomber into a wit tumbler , no date .<ssssss>appearance -lrb- 4.0 -rrb- : rocky , 2 finger , just barely off-white head with minimal lacing but some head retention ; clear , pure golden body .<ssssss>smell -lrb- 3.5 -rrb- : moderately aromatic , the smell be totally pine and some brace -lrb- bitter , not sweet -rrb- citrus , with some very lightly sweet malt in the background .<ssssss>hop be definitely front and center in the nose , and the scent be clear but not as strong as youd think -lrb- and personally id hope for -rrb- .<ssssss>taste -lrb- 4.0 -rrb- : follow the scent , pine be front and center follow by bitter citrus , with a mellow , light and mildly sweet malt body on the mid-palate .<ssssss>the aftertaste be mainly bitter citrus , which i enjoyvery much prefer pine and acidic citrus in my ipa , as oppose to overly fruity hop .<ssssss>aftertaste linger , and the hop presence be almost constant , with not a lot of room for the malt body .<ssssss>make it feel more sessionable though , which i like .<ssssss>mouthfeel -lrb- 2.5 -rrb- : relatively thin , actually , with very little carbonation .<ssssss>this be kind of a surprise after get such a nice head , but it be what it be .<ssssss>its actually more like a cask ale , which be interesting .<ssssss>not bad when you look at it that way , but for a bottle id prefer more effervescence .<ssssss>hop oils offer a light coating on the tongue , but nothing major .<ssssss>overall -lrb- 4.0 -rrb- : this be a decent ipa , and worth try if you like piney american ipa that wont weigh you down too much .<ssssss>im mark it down a bit because it wasnt quite what i be expect for a straight pour from the bottle , but id love to try this fresh and on cask .<ssssss>

6 6 4 6 5		large corked bottle , get directly from the brewery , it be suppose to be fresh .<ssssss>the cork be hard to remove , but as it come out , the lack of any `` pop '' betray a problem i be unfortunately get use to in lose abbey beer , the lack of carbonation .<ssssss>it pour a little better than flat , as the reddish copper brew manage to produce a frothy but sparse one finger head that dissipate quickly and leave little lacing behind .<ssssss>aroma be definitely more alcoholic than i would have like , obscure the fruity and spicy note that come along in the background .<ssssss>the body , give the near absolute lack of carbonation despite the state bottle conditioning with brett , be quite disappointing .<ssssss>the taste be interesting at time , but like the aroma , heavily alcoholic and the fruit and spice do not blend all that well .<ssssss>lightly sweet and hot , spicy as the most important note after the alcohol , but the spice be hard to identify .<ssssss>some people suggest , although in previous batch , that aging would improve this one .<ssssss>i be not sure ; it might quiet down the heat , but so far this be disappointing , at best .<ssssss>

9 6 9 8 8		on tap at a chain casual dining restaurant , pour into a cheater pint .<ssssss>appearance : half inch , thick , foamy white head that last a long time and leave big streak of lacing .<ssssss>color be a translucent dull golden honey color .<ssssss>smell : very little aroma .<ssssss>some faint -- possibly grassy or piny -- hop , some faint malt , and a third -lrb- equally faint -rrb- somewhat unpleasant bmcish skunk smell .<ssssss>taste : big and warm , bready malt be the dominant flavor .<ssssss>up front there be a strong but very short-lasting hop hit without much character .<ssssss>throughout , the beer have a pleasantly mild sweetness underpin the airy , earthy malt .<ssssss>the big malt flavor last long after each sip .<ssssss>pretty refreshing beer .<ssssss>there be a hint of skunky , sickly bitter taste like in a stella artois , but it be not dominant at all .<ssssss>it be also the only bad thing about the flavor .<ssssss>as the beer warm , some creamy and almost caramely note start to emerge , which be interesting .<ssssss>mouthfeel : medium-bodied .<ssssss>a lot fuller-bodied than it look or than i expect from the style .<ssssss>it be actually very good ; deliciously creamy but still watery enough to be refreshing and easy drinking .<ssssss>carbonation be heavy , but it work well with that aggressive , breezy breadiness , and with the fuller body .<ssssss>mouthfeel be perhaps the best aspect of this beer .<ssssss>drinkability : very good .<ssssss>the alcohol be predictably undetectable , and the beer deliver a lot of good , classic beer flavor -lrb- that big malt , and even the subdue hop -rrb- .<ssssss>it do not quite have the complexity to bring I back to it that often , but obviously the style do not really demand it .<ssssss>i would love it if noble pil become a staple on the tap of less craft-oriented bar and restaurant though , because it be good enough to have a place in the kind of bar and store that bas prefer to frequent .<ssssss>to engage in some ba forum comparison nonsense , it be a bit weaker in the nose than prima pil and not quite as balanced , but in all i think i prefer the taste of noble pil .<ssssss>sam adam would be smart to make this a staple , year-round offering .<ssssss>
10 8 4 8 8		a - a enormous head rest a top a dark brown beer with a reddish tint .<ssssss>a tremendous amount of lacing linger on the side of the glass .<ssssss>a really nice look .<ssssss>s - some chocolate and burnt malt mesh with pine and grassy hop .<ssssss>t - a bit of dark malty flavor mix with grassy hop and a touch of banana -lrb- i have never have banana flavor witout banana aroma before and often banana aroma , yet no banana flavor -rrb- , the aftertaste be a linger char with a bit of grass and maybe some date too .<ssssss>this taste be pretty good .<ssssss>m - smooth , thin , a bit slick , a bit dry as well , but only a tiny bit .<ssssss>it leave you gum feel a bit slimy .<ssssss>d - this be a really good beer from what i would generally consider to be a mainstream brewery that lack in quality .<ssssss>this be great though .<ssssss>if the mouthfeel be not as awful , i would have give it more here .<ssssss>the combination of flavor be not a common one , but it be a delicious one .<ssssss>i will have no problem choose this in the future .<ssssss>i suppose that it do pass the ultimate test though : i can conceive of a time when i would be craving this beer and no other would satisfy that craving as maximally .<ssssss>that be a rare attribute indeed<ssssss>
6 4 5 3 5		i try this beer after hear a lot of hype from people say that it be `` like , totally , the best beer ever . ''<ssssss>unfortunately , i have to disagree .<ssssss>this beer pour a very standard gold , with a small , quickly dissipate head .<ssssss>the nose be quite boring , a little sweet , a little hoppy , but nothing of interest .<ssssss>i find the taste of this beer fairly unrefined at first : some hop bitterness , some sweetness , and not really a whole lot else .<ssssss>as the beer warm a little , some of the flavour open up , reveal mostly grassy note .<ssssss>overall , i find this to be a ho-hum beer .<ssssss>almost all other belgian beer i have try have be superior -lrb- although admittedly , this one be not too pricey -rrb- , and i would even go so far as to say that a lot of `` belgian-style '' beer trump it .<ssssss>not terrible to drink , but certainly fall into the class of beer i would consider about tier 2 out of five -lrb- with only thing like laker be lower -rrb- .<ssssss>
9 8 10 9 8		a - pour into a snifter , deep brown , great head for a barleywine , actually try to replenish itself a little after each sip .<ssssss>s - suitably heady , with a spiky rum raisin emphasis over a malted milk underpinning .<ssssss>t , m - very little sweetness to be have ... the hop win out here .<ssssss>a flash of sweetness , then mega hop sticky bitterness in the finish .<ssssss>you be gon na get you hop fix here , that be certain .<ssssss>alcohol ?<ssssss>it be very easy to tell you be drink a huge beer , but actual alcohol taste be mask very well .<ssssss>i do not even feel much warming ... this almost taste refreshing , believe it or not .<ssssss>some stickiness from the hop ; this sit very well in the mouth .<ssssss>d - really easy to sip on this one .<ssssss>another winner from great divide .<ssssss>
6 8 8 6 8		golden brown with a medium level of activity rise from the bottom of the pilsner glass .<ssssss>a one finger head quickly shrink down to a little lacing .<ssssss>sharp with a slight malt and corn scent .<ssssss>the corn scent be not oily but instead be very alcohol base .<ssssss>crisp with a tang of alcohol .<ssssss>some malt but not very flavorful .<ssssss>a light body that be refreshing and which go down smooth .<ssssss>this beer be drinkable .<ssssss>but only because it be so light and neutral .<ssssss>a great representation of its style .<ssssss>
6 7 6 9 8		it pour a dark brown that show ruby up to the light , with a decent head finger width of head .<ssssss>the aroma be intriguing , roasted malt and caramel .<ssssss>taste be the right kind of roasted bitterness , with hint of caramel .<ssssss>the flavor be quite pronounced , and the finish be a nice linger roasted coffee bean .<ssssss>the mouth feel be only medioce , in the sense that i do not really notice it until the finish , and even then its only the effect of the carbonation .<ssssss>its rather drinkable but not sure if i could pound one of these after another .<ssssss>

8 10 8 8 9		color be a dark coffee brown with dark ruby highlight when put up to the light , thin compact tannish head fading fairly slow to leave ink blot patch of crumbly lace .<ssssss>aroma be dark , sweet chocolate and a nice alcoholic warmth and spice .<ssssss>also blend in some nice malty roastyness and dry hop with a nice overlay touch of fresh coffee bean .<ssssss>taste be quite different then what the smell lead on ; mostly a heavy roasted flavor with a older left-in-the-pot coffee sense , a milding roasted sweetness and the chocolate be all but go from the nose with only hint of cocoa powder and light burnt brownie dry that come in and through the finish .<ssssss>feel be medium body with a creamy start and middle wrap up the finish with a favorable little bittering and dry faction with note of cocoa , coffee , and cinnamon .<ssssss>a nice stout with a great nose and a nice finish .<ssssss>a solid stout all the way .<ssssss>
6 10 8 9 8		i have have trouble get into belgian beer until this one ... i hear that westmalle would soon stop export , so i pick up a few 330 's from the store a month or two ago , save a tripel for my girlfriend 's risotto .<ssssss>appearance be nothing special .<ssssss>huge , rocky head , but quickly dissipate and be soon nowhere to be see .<ssssss>it be get wheat in it , right ?<ssssss>where 's the head ?<ssssss>kill by the alcohol ?<ssssss>golden haze with a glowing aura , some small bubble rise to the top .<ssssss>smell be amazing ... so complicated i should probably have a few more to figure it all out .<ssssss>i smell strong plum and black currant , slight smell of alcohol , but just barely .<ssssss>clove and corriander , a bit of citrus and pine .<ssssss>taste basically match the smell .<ssssss>subtler fruit , pear , a spicy bite .<ssssss>slight bread in the background .<ssssss>aftertaste be clean , slightly dry , mostly corriander spice .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium , not too sticky .<ssssss>cut through fat .<ssssss>definitely try it with a rich , rich risotto -- with prosciutto and mushroom !<ssssss>deceptively drinkable , no alcohol cringe .<ssssss>quite complex .<ssssss>keep count , though !<ssssss>
9 7 8 6 9		nice look dark-amber with a light tan head .<ssssss>very inoffensive aroma of hop and caramel .<ssssss>taste be better than a-b 's usual product but nothing special .<ssssss>good mouthfeel for the style .<ssssss>nicely drinkable , too .<ssssss>this could be call a `` starter craft-beer '' for the a-b empire .<ssssss>not bad but nothing exceptional , either .<ssssss>
4 6 3 3 2		i do not really care for this beer .<ssssss>it have a oddly perfumed aroma , and a combination of yeastiness and cerealness in its flavor that i could not get into .<ssssss>more over , the excessive amount of floaty in this beer give it a strange and unpleasant mouthfeel that be at the same time both slick and gritty .<ssssss>appearance be a hazy tan , with some light and dark speck in it which remind I of eggnog .<ssssss>aroma be perfume-y , and the first thought that hit I be `` lavender . ''<ssssss>taste be faint at first , intensify as it warm , and the emerge flavor be cereal-y and yeasty in a way that be unpleasant to I .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be a bit gritty due to the floaty present , but also a bit slick and slimy feeling .<ssssss>much of mine go down the drain .<ssssss>i be not a fan of this beer and would not recommend it .<ssssss>
7 6 9 8 7		a - pour a deep mahogany/black with small 1 finger head that dissipate quickly down the glass .<ssssss>s - mostly some dark malt , a bit of caramel .<ssssss>t - good roasted taste , a tinge of caramel , some coffee note , and chocolate .<ssssss>fade into a tiny bit of licorice .<ssssss>m - very smooth taste , carbonation be mild .<ssssss>very drinkable beverage here .<ssssss>overall - base on the smell , i be not expect much , but this be actually a pretty solid schwarzbier here .<ssssss>very drinkable and sooth .<ssssss>would be a ideal session beer .<ssssss>
5 9 4 7 8		pour a bright hazy gold color with a small white head that dissipate quickly .<ssssss>very fruity nose of banana , tart citrus , and sour apple , with some wheat and yeast as well .<ssssss>strong sour citrus taste over sweet wheat base with lot of phenol and muted banana and clove at the end .<ssssss>pretty flat and thin body that come off a little watery .<ssssss>this one kind of drive I crazy ... moment of greatness mix with disappointment .<ssssss>thankfully croucher provide the batch number on the bottle so i think i will give this another try with a different batch .<ssssss>
8 7 5 8 6		a = rich dark red color .<ssssss>tight bubble structure and a good lasting head .<ssssss>leave a nice lacing in the glass .<ssssss>s = smell good .<ssssss>not a ton of sweetness , but a nice rich nutty aroma .<ssssss>smell `` clean '' t = for this stlye of beer , i be not impressed , but i be not dissappointed either .<ssssss>it seem to lack boldness and character .<ssssss>there be a nutty bitterness that be present , but not much more than that .<ssssss>a light linger `` chocolate '' aftertaste .<ssssss>m = thin , watery , moderate carbonation on the top of the tongue , and not much else to write home -lrb- or the internet -rrb- about .<ssssss>d = despite be ho-hum in other department , i could handle a few of these at a backyard bbq , or perhaps i would start the evening with one .<ssssss>i never find this style of beer to go well with anything except baked potato , cabbage , corn beef and beet , and even then , it be my `` backup '' style of beer .<ssssss>give a choice of other national product from `` big 3 '' , i would probably order this one over some of the other choice out there .<ssssss>
6 4 4 2 4		another faxe brew , this be my second venture into the world of faxe , and it will be my last .<ssssss>after have they extra strong lager , i think this would be interesting , but i be sorrily mistaken .<ssssss>pour out of the 500ml can into a pint glass , it look real nice .<ssssss>nice copper color with a nice 2 inch fluffy off white head .<ssssss>i have high hope at this point .<ssssss>i take a nice big whiff of the smell of the beer , and man do it smell bad .<ssssss>skunky , metallic -lrb- even when pour out of the can -rrb- wet hay smell .<ssssss>brutal .<ssssss>after the first sip i be so repulse by this , that i almost pour it out .<ssssss>it have a water down , malty taste with little hop with a metallic twang , just like the extra strong lager , i think that be the trademark taste for this brewery .<ssssss>just bad .<ssssss>thin and watery mouthfeel , very light .<ssssss>this be insanely hard to drink , even when cold .<ssssss>i be barely able to choke down the whole thing .<ssssss>avoid .<ssssss>
10 6 9 9 10		pour out black with a tan head that stay pretty well and leave nice lacing throughout the glass .<ssssss>smell be a bit chocolatey and roasty , but it have a very light smell to it .<ssssss>taste start out light , but quickly hit you with a light chocolate and coffee-like flavor .<ssssss>mouthfeel be just so smooth and rich with a heavier than medium body and real light carbonation on the tongue .<ssssss>another excellent beer from the folk at vike ; you have find yourselve a new customer !<ssssss>
9 5 6 8 8		the beer begin pour a deep brown color mix with the nitrogen and cascade into a midnight black beer with a soft two finger creamy head at the top .<ssssss>there be not really much of a nose on a guinness .<ssssss>perhaps a bit of roasted barley , but not much .<ssssss>the taste be of the unique roasted malted flavor that allow for a bit of chocolate to find you palate from drink to drink and a dry finish leave you go for another drink .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be smooth and creamy , but the beer be actually rather light and do not overly coat you mouth .<ssssss>the drinkability be very high on this .<ssssss>it be low in alcohol , refreshing , and satisfy .<ssssss>it make a great session beer .<ssssss>
7 5 7 7 7		pour from 12oz bottle into pint goblet - no best by date visible .<ssssss>a : when hold up to light pour a translucent black with two finger head that hold it be retention , form a thick off white lacing w/decent carbonation .<ssssss>s : not much go on here , light hop with roasted malt .<ssssss>t : some hop in the forefront , follow with deep roasted malt , some char flavor not sure how to describe it , maybe the taste of lick a bbq grill after it cool down .<ssssss>o : overall this be somewhat unbalanced , the blend between the hop and malt give it a off flavor something just do not balance it out , it be not terrible and i have have a lot worse .<ssssss>

8 7 7 9 8		pour into a imperial pint glass .<ssssss>color be a dark brown with a small reddish tint .<ssssss>head be a light caramel color that cling extremely well , but do not last long at all .<ssssss>aroma be of molasses and burnt sugar with small amout of acidic bitterness .<ssssss>taste be slightly sweet , rich vanilla flavor .<ssssss>remind I a burnt rye or other strong grain .<ssssss>mellow out very nicely .<ssssss>coated well , a bit thin , and perhaps slightly overcarbonate , but not bad .<ssssss>a very drinkable beer .<ssssss>need a few minute to mellow out and breathe before drinking .<ssssss>
4 9 4 6 7		this beer start out so much better than it finish .<ssssss>pour to a copper color with white head that dissipate quicklly to leave nothing .<ssssss>wonderful aroma of spice , mostly cinnamon and nutmeg , with a touch of clove .<ssssss>upon initial sip , the flavor follow the aroma .<ssssss>very quickly , however , this taste be offset by the watery finish and bitter pumpkin aftertaste .<ssssss>no alcohol make itself know , so the final result be a less than memorable end to a beer that start out so promising .<ssssss>
7 7 6 8 6		try this one recently base on the review .<ssssss>serve in my chimmay chalice .<ssssss>unfortunately , it just do not live up to the hype .<ssssss>i be hope to find a home brew -lrb- cap ' t lawrence be about 15 mile away -rrb- belgium that i would really enjoy but i be disappoint .<ssssss>flavor wise it be close but something be miss - it really do not have that rich , deep taste a true belgim dubbel have .<ssssss>
8 7 4 7 7		pour out a surprisingly light coppery colour , with very little head , and a tiny bit of lace around the edge .<ssssss>aroma be a typical epa , with just a hint of somebody make toast in the background .<ssssss>taste be really surprising to I .<ssssss>it taste like somebody water down my fuller esb !<ssssss>mouthfeel be thin too , add to the effect .<ssssss>carbonation be light .<ssssss>oaky aftertaste .<ssssss>reasonably good beer .<ssssss>a lot better than a generic production beer , but not in the same caliber as a fuller or rogue .<ssssss>i wonder if this beer be better on tap ?<ssssss>i bet that a nitrogen charge would really aerate this beer and bring out the flavor .<ssssss>
8 8 8 5 5		a : dark brown -lrb- almost black -rrb- color .<ssssss>there be a average size off-white head on top .<ssssss>s : the smell be very nice .<ssssss>there be some burnt caramel smell to it along with a malty aroma .<ssssss>also there be a little bit of tartness and raisin in the smell , too .<ssssss>t : the taste be a little water down tasting .<ssssss>there be some roasted malt in the middle of the palete but without any of the harshness .<ssssss>a little bit of caramel flavor be in it .<ssssss>also there be a flavor that i think might be the artifical sweetner , but it do taste a little odd .<ssssss>mf : the beer be very light on the palate but the low amount of carbonation give it somewhat of a smooth feeling .<ssssss>d : do find it weird that one the back of the bottle it say there be artificial sweetner .<ssssss>i have hear of people talk about use it before but never try any beer with it in it .<ssssss>overall it be a okay beer , but the flavor be not great so i would not drink to many of these .<ssssss>
9 6 9 8 9		i pour this and be surprise to find out that the bottle be actually green .<ssssss>the beer have a wonderful reddish hue when hold up to light .<ssssss>the smell be a disappointment , as it be hardly even there .<ssssss>i only get a whiff of a little alcohol , malt , and a faint lager-like aroma .<ssssss>the taste , however , make up for this .<ssssss>i be a sucker for malt and this one have it in spade , like i be hope it would .<ssssss>a little more complexity would have drive this beer into the upper echelon of great tasting brew , but i thoroughly enjoy it nonetheless .<ssssss>some alcohol be present in the flavor , and a butteriness dominate the aftertaste .<ssssss>the hop come through ever so slightly in the aftertaste as well .<ssssss>

8 8 10 9 8		on tap at the brew pub ... a dark brown pour with a light tan head , good retention and great lacing ... a very sweet aroma of all bourbon and vanilla , a touch to sweet for I .<ssssss>stunningly similar to bc , more than a few could not tell the difference between the two ... the taste be way interesting as not surprisingly it be sweet , but not how you would think .<ssssss>the bourbon and vanilla be replace by sweet and creamy milk chocolate , and the finish bring back the bite bourbon and vanilla .<ssssss>so complex , loving it ... a wonderfully viscous lip smacker .<ssssss>a super unique combination in taste and play off the aroma .<ssssss>remind I of a easy to drink aged bc .<ssssss>you can tell he work at gi .<ssssss>drink this beer .<ssssss>
6 6 3 4 6		on tap at the sbc-brewery , hamden .<ssssss>dark brown -lrb- nearly black -rrb- pour with a linger , persistent head .<ssssss>the aroma be the most pleasant feature of this beer - strong chocolate and gingerbread aroma make I expect something complex and balance on the palate .<ssssss>well , be i in for a surprise .<ssssss>the initial taste be strongly coffee and roasted malt , but the finish be creamy , even fatty .<ssssss>the buttery finish , combine with a odd licorice taste , seem inappropriate for this beer .<ssssss>the aftertaste be reminiscent of have something that be ` in a tube ' for a long period of time - sort of a off-plastic bottle taste .<ssssss>it be probably something to do with unclean line at the brewery - i feel that would be responsible for a lot of these off flavor .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be thin , creamy , greasy .<ssssss>overall , this be a water down-stout ; but this be also nothing like a porter -lrb- also note : all good porter be nothing like ` water down ' anything -rrb- add two scoop of butter , some molasses and leave in a jar of tupperware for three week , and voila - black rock stout .<ssssss>good beer have taste that follow you - but so do bad one .<ssssss>hour after i scribble down these tasting note , i can still recall this beer flavor , and it still have I rush for water to cleanse my palate .<ssssss>
8 6 4 7 6		this beer do not follow the typical barleywine style , the hop seem to I to overpower this beer .<ssssss>the aroma and taste seem to be more of a pale ale .<ssssss>otherwise it be a interesting beer that do have some subtle fruit and grain flavor that be nice .<ssssss>the head and color be beautiful , and i do keep the ceramic bottle to possibly use for homebrew .<ssssss>

7 5 7 7 7		decent but not great pil on tap at fort york beer fest .<ssssss>decent taste , a tad of fruit and medium mouthfeel .<ssssss>bit of hoppiness .<ssssss>another middling brew from these brewer .<ssssss>however , that be it , flat in appearance and no aroma .<ssssss>not bitter , therefore better than they organic pil .<ssssss>

8 8 7 10 9		the first time i have this , it be during a tasting that feature quite a few much more aggressive sour , so i decide to hold off on review until i be able to try a glass on its own .<ssssss>here we go : pour into a tall goblet .<ssssss>have a semi-cloudy brown appearance ; not quite crystal clear , but not murky either .<ssssss>no particulate matter note .<ssssss>foam be not crazy-high , but do retain well .<ssssss>the beer smell exactly as i would expect - lot of balsamic , and wood .<ssssss>a little rot apple , cola , root beer as it warm .<ssssss>but mostly balsamic .<ssssss>not sharply balsamic - it do not `` smell sour '' like a cantillon lambic ; it merely smell `` tart . ''<ssssss>minor plastic-y note .<ssssss>this be a very solid , uncompromising , straight down the middle flander red .<ssssss>all the hallmark of the style be here - balsamic tartness , little woody vanilla and that tough to describe leathery `` cellar '' character , green apple that show sweet , briefly , even some minor flowery hop bitterness .<ssssss>no one component overly assertive , great sweet/tart balance and complexity .<ssssss>review to style , i feel very justified in award a 5.0 .<ssssss>you can find american interpretation of the style that take the sour further , but that be not what i feel this be try to be - i think this be suppose to be a attempt at a traditional flander red , and to that end , its flavor be outstanding .<ssssss>sharply bubble , though perhaps not near as quenching as a rodenbach .<ssssss>i think i can say with pretty fair certainty that most appreciator of this style would not have trouble take care of this 750 on they own .<ssssss>it be go down pretty easily for I .<ssssss>oh , by the way , this be a '09 .<ssssss>expensive , but i say worth the odd purchase every now and again .<ssssss>

10 8 10 8 10		500ml bottle ... picture perfect brownish-orange -lrb- yeah , its cleveland f-ball season soon ! -rrb-<ssssss>with a head that thickly sit and dissipate evenly ... clove be evident and pleasant , and i have -lrb- as seemingly always with weizen -rrb- a hint of banana ?<ssssss>... .<ssssss>the mouthfeel may be among the softest ive sample ... the refeshing aspect of this beer be difficult to quantify ... a brilliantly drinkable beer , more than at home in the humid august evening ...<ssssss>
8 7 9 10 10		the chicago scotch ale be one of they special beer , available seasonaly .<ssssss>i find it on tap during the winter .<ssssss>as a special beer , it cost more for a growler fill , but it be worth it .<ssssss>this be a malt bomb , which i guess be what you should expect from a scotch ale .<ssssss>the flavor be very rich , the maltiness be very aggressive and seem very much caramelize .<ssssss>the hop presence be basically undetectable .<ssssss>you could call this the opposite of a arrogant bastard ale .<ssssss>alcohol be not present in the taste , but it seem to have a pretty high abv - i would guess at least 8 % base on how it hit I .<ssssss>this be probably one of the finest beer i have have from a american brewpub .<ssssss>a big beer that be very easy to enjoy .<ssssss>i will miss it when they rotate it off the menu .<ssssss>
3 5 6 7 6		this be by far the clearest beer i have ever see in my life .<ssssss>big soapy head , slight yellow tinge .<ssssss>both aroma and taste be bready and rich ... there be definitely a bit of flavor in this beer .<ssssss>beat coor light and other adjunct lager hand down .<ssssss>only serve at a local dive bar , but it keep I come back .<ssssss>
5 6 7 6 4		appearence : straw , clear yellow with a thin white head that be go in a second .<ssssss>very little carbonation .<ssssss>smell : the smell be a mix of rice and corn , but not in a horrible way .<ssssss>taste and mouthfeel : clean , smooth and refreshing .<ssssss>not complex , or very interesting tasting , but not horrible .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be slick and smooth .<ssssss>drinkability and overall : as for as `` macro '' lager go , it be not bad .<ssssss>i would drink it if nothing else be available .<ssssss>but after about half the glass , i be do with it .<ssssss>
9 5 9 9 9		yuengle traditional lager be amber in color and have a surprisingly crisp fruity flavor .<ssssss>it have become a popular brew in the eastern united state .<ssssss>the smell be not as entice as the flavor , which be unique .<ssssss>this beer do not travel well , it skunks rather easily .<ssssss>i suspect this be due to the lack of preservative or additive .<ssssss>the yuengling brewery lay claim to be the oldest operating brewery in the united state , since 1829 .<ssssss>i have be to the original brewery in pottsville pa , the best part be the free sample of all they brew at the end of the tour .<ssssss>
8 7 7 9 8		a good look ipa .<ssssss>it pour a haze orange that let 's a ton of lint through but you just can not see the other side .<ssssss>the head be khaki color and fast to fade .<ssssss>the nose be above average but only just so .<ssssss>it have subtle hop aroma in the piney and citrus neighborhood that could be a little more potent for my taste .<ssssss>a extra dose of this and i would bein heaven right now .<ssssss>the taste be outstanding with big hop flavor despite the lack of presence in the nose .<ssssss>sweet juicy fruit gum tasting with a mix of tropical fruit , citrus and a steady twang of pine resin .<ssssss>a perfect balance of all those hoppy flavor and still a fair dollop of sweet grain .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be a touch on the rough side with a aggressive bitterness pair with a firm carbonation .<ssssss>i be all for a hop bite but this jai alai get almost acidic with it be ibu 's .<ssssss>but who care about such a minor inconvenience when you have such a great flavor profile .<ssssss>this be a outstanding ipa and it make I sad that it be not distribute everywhere .<ssssss>
8 7 8 6 8		good beer , like the 60 min , love the 90 min !<ssssss>pour well into my trusty sam adam glass , have decent head the smell be good , hop , and more hop the taste be good , this be a pretty good ipa the mouthfeel be good , i like the 90 , ad 120 better , but then i be a hop head , so what do you expect ?<ssssss>this be a very drinkable ipa , it be avaliable just about everywhere , pick it up , and enjoy !<ssssss>
9 6 8 8 8		a - pour a brilliant reddish brown with a terminator khaki head that will not die .<ssssss>s - big spice aroma , banana bread crust , pear , golden raisin , muted brown sugar .<ssssss>t - spicy right off the bat along with a bouquet of fruit - plum , apple , pear , persimmon , banana , and honey dew .<ssssss>dry toast malt stay in the background and finish earthy and dry .<ssssss>m - moderate carbonation , smooth and creamy , medium to full body .<ssssss>on the drier side for the style .<ssssss>the fruity yeast be the forerunner and almost drown out the malt .<ssssss>nice yeast profile and the dry finish be welcome .<ssssss>
10 9 9 6 5		a - pour from the bottle with a massive , hand-high , rocky off-white head , which slowly recede with a trace of substantial sticky lacing .<ssssss>the body be a optically clear , mildly carbonated , ruby-tinged amber color .<ssssss>gorgeous .<ssssss>s - a perfect balance of crackerlike malt and low-alpha hop aroma comprise the bulk of this rich nose .<ssssss>moderate melanoidin character accompany a bold -lrb- and highly appealing -rrb- husky aroma .<ssssss>t - the malt character be much milder than expect on the palate ... quite mild actually ... and accompany by a surprise hint of diacetyl .<ssssss>on the mid-palate , the low-alpha hop flavor be meet with a moderate hop bitterness .<ssssss>this bitterness surge in the finish and linger on the tongue along the some slight anticipated huskiness .<ssssss>get ta ding the flavor for its imbalance and diacetyl flaw .<ssssss>m - medium body , slightly oily in texture , with a slight creaminess impart by a soft pervasive carbonation .<ssssss>no astringency .<ssssss>overall a nice mouthfeel for the style .<ssssss>d - the palate be skewed too much towards the hop -lrb- bitterness -rrb- for the style ... which become a overwhelming factor halfway through the bottle .<ssssss>the drinkability suffer accordingly .<ssssss>
8 4 6 5 7		12oz bottled on jan. 11th 09 crystal clear copper , imagine that , with minimal head and lacing .<ssssss>smell be almost non-existant , i guess it be better than a bad smell , but my nose be very bored .<ssssss>this surprise I because of the freshness , i have crack can of coor with more aroma .<ssssss>slight hop bitterness on the finish , but seemingly no hop flavor , and a wee little malt backbone , this beer be not strong enough to stand up to a stiff breeze ... at least it be well balanced .<ssssss>decent mouthfeel , more body than the smell and taste would lead I to expect .<ssssss>very easy to drink , not a bad example of the style in this case .<ssssss>really not a impressive beer in my opinion ... i would probably drink about five more time ... but once this sixer be do , i will be too .<ssssss>
8 6 10 10 10		this be my regular beer and the best macro light for the money , bar none .<ssssss>compare to other macro light , -lrb- of which i have considerable expertise in consuming -rrb- , the flavor be far more bold and crisp and this drink exceptionally smooth and without nearly the hangover effect of american macro light if you overdue it .<ssssss>this beer be so tasty , crisp , and bold with hop that you will find yourself drink it faster than a american macro light but it , again , will treat you better .<ssssss>i love macro beer and drink macro light for the most part and there be nothing even close to this .<ssssss>
10 9 6 8 8		11.5 % abv serve in a 10 oz .<ssssss>chalice like glass .<ssssss>darkest of burnt brown upon close inspection , - bal ir look every bit a top notch american imperial stout .<ssssss>come with a surprisingly good thick and creamy dark tan head that leave a good amount of lacing as it dissipate , when it do .<ssssss>smell decadent , full of chocolate and cream and hint of vanilla .<ssssss>no booze and no acidity .<ssssss>very different from the base beer in many respects .<ssssss>bitter chocolate and bourbon dominate the taste ; in fact this be one of the most chocolaty beer ever and a worthy contender to bcb 08 .<ssssss>the roast have completely mellow out and make for a staggeringly smooth drink that gracefully go towards a bitter heavy bittersweet finish .<ssssss>the finish be very clean , perhaps because the beer be excessively carbonate ?<ssssss>really , the bubble be irritating after a point and the body seem thin as well .<ssssss>even then i be digging this beer until it come to room temperature and get very very boozy .<ssssss>a very good beer that could have be exceptional have it be lower on carbonation , a little bigger on body , but most importantly less boozy .<ssssss>score : appearance 5/5 , aroma 4.5 / 5 , taste 4/5 , mouthfeel 3/5 , overall 4/5<ssssss>
9 6 8 8 8		natelocc787 send I this brew in we trade .<ssssss>cheer !<ssssss>a - pour a dark cola color with a thick pillowy head that leave great lacing .<ssssss>s - some faint roasted malt and grain .<ssssss>not as much go on in the nose as i have hope .<ssssss>t - that be better , the taste bring it back .<ssssss>full roasted flavor with a bit of vanilla and cocoa and a decent hoppy bitterness in the finish .<ssssss>m - medium body with decent carbonation .<ssssss>d - nice appearance and flavor .<ssssss>i just wish the nose be a bit stronger .<ssssss>
9 7 6 5 7		pour cartoon brown and very hazy , with a pleasant beige crown of foam .<ssssss>lacing be sensational , and can not see any carb because of the have .<ssssss>head be great , lacing be great , i love haze .<ssssss>that be a great look .<ssssss>nose be quite tangy , good caramelly sweetness but a tangy sauvin hop aroma as well at the back give it a hint of passionfruit , pineapple and lemon .<ssssss>hint of leather as well , nice and complex , could be stronger though with more fragrance .<ssssss>need to really sniff to get the smell .<ssssss>taste have a sweet grainy character , lot of seedy , nutty flavour with cereal overtone , and then a floral sauvin hop bitterness on the back , which be nice , but do not suit the flavour very well .<ssssss>should be more malty on the finish , and the hop really overpower .<ssssss>mouthfeel be quite tingly with a bit of pucker on there , again it be not a bad mouthfeel , but i do not think it suit the style .<ssssss>i think this be a decent beer go awry .<ssssss>nice flavour , but in the wrong combination and ratio .<ssssss>
6 4 7 6 6		ok let see .<ssssss>appearance : look like beer .<ssssss>i do pure what be leave in my can into a small glass and a huge impressive head come up and nice golden color come out .<ssssss>smell : smell like ale , i be not a huge ale guy normally but this must be ale cause the lager i normally drink smell `` sharper '' for lack of a better term .<ssssss>not much smell to speak of besides that .<ssssss>taste : i read a review that suggest let this beer get a little warmer and i must say that as i drink it there do seem to be a happy area between too cold and too warm that this beer be very very tasty .<ssssss>it be pretty full flavored , i make the mistake of assume that genesee ment water down .<ssssss>maybe if i get the light beer .<ssssss>mouthfeel : very nice and smooth .<ssssss>drinkability : after have one and get use the aleyness of it i desided that i could drink some more of these .<ssssss>for some reason the first one just rough for I .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 10		a : deep rich golden color with a robust head that go down but still leave you with a decent size finger length .<ssssss>s : fruity hop note with some real dryness that i can sense .<ssssss>t : fruity at first with a slight hop bitterness .<ssssss>this do get some sweet breadiness from the malt but finish with a really thick candied sugar aftertaste .<ssssss>might be a little overly sweet but good sugar note .<ssssss>d/m : fantastic carbonation and great effect with the bubble .<ssssss>tickle the tongue but be still rather thick and sweet .<ssssss>not overly drinkable but still a decent brew .<ssssss>
4 4 4 6 5		i have avoid this beer for year now on purpose because i have read the review know it be not all that for $ 15 , yet for v day with chocolate cake .<ssssss>why not ?<ssssss>here be the why not .<ssssss>thin might be a porter or maybe just a brown that have get too dark .<ssssss>definately remind of the black lager in look even the head be still whitish .<ssssss>chocolate from view no .<ssssss>chocolate from smell only after i have a few swallow , mostly nothing come of this beer .<ssssss>chocolate in the taste , yes , but it be fleeting and mild subdue and impotent .<ssssss>do i say that this beer be thin , because it be thin .<ssssss>you can drink it while you mow you lawn , but at the premium price i would rather drink a pbr and pay the neighbor kid to do it .<ssssss>
8 5 8 7 6		cisco have a new label this year that be different from the one picture .<ssssss>it feature a snowflake and the text read , `` deliciously malty , wih caramel and dry fruit mid-palate , lace with ginger , honey , cinnamon , and love .<ssssss>this warm ale be like one of you grandmother 's freshly-baked cookie in a bottle ! ''<ssssss>appearance : pour a fairly clear amber color with a modest beige head that stick fairly well and leave the occasional dot of lace smell : musty , vegetal aroma predominate but there be a intermittent flash of citrusy hop that sneak through ; touch of honey and cinnamon , too taste : open with a ginger cookie flavor , with plenty of cinnamon as well ; pick up some honey and stone fruit , mid-palate ; the finish be earthy and unbalanced , with a odd herbaciousness mouthfeel : medium body with moderate carbonation drinkability : this beer be schizophrenic both in aroma and taste ; interesting experiment , but not particularly enjoyable thanks , unclejimbo , for the opportunity<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 9		12oz bottle - & gt ; american pint best before july 2009 be stamp on the bottle pour a dark amber with a billowy off white head , that deposit some sweet droopy ring of lace .<ssssss>carbonation appear robust and appropiate .<ssssss>nose : light malt , not much happen for I ... malty from the start , with sweet caramel , some bread and candy sugar .<ssssss>no real hop presence until the slight bitter sweet finish .<ssssss>nice fully body ale , that finish semi-dry and bitter .<ssssss>i love the mouthfeel for a apa , this beer be no wuss .<ssssss>go pen !<ssssss>go phish !<ssssss>

6 4 6 6 7		pour from a bottle into a pint glass ; yellow with small white head .<ssssss>do not have much of a aroma , slight smell of grain .<ssssss>taste be very bland but it finish nice , dry and crisp .<ssssss>easy to drink .<ssssss>would not buy a bunch to keep around the house but good enough to wash down my food when i be at a japanese steak house .<ssssss>
8 5 8 7 8		pour a clear light reddish brown color , or maybe it be more of a dark copper .<ssssss>good two inch of creamy tan head sti on top and keep pretty well , with a full , thin lace and some splash of stick on the side even .<ssssss>smell be awfully weak , and i struggle to pick up some grain and a bit of caramel sweetness that do not seem half worth my effort .<ssssss>there be nothing bad about the smell , it be just incredibly weak .<ssssss>taste also consist of some caramel sweetness with a bit of grain .<ssssss>it be bready overall , and pretty smooth although not very robust at all .<ssssss>it be thin , but the flavor be not bad .<ssssss>it could just use more of it .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium body and actually have a pretty nice creaminess .<ssssss>the taste seem thin and somewhat watery but the mouthfeel have a bit more to it .<ssssss>this be not a half bad bock .<ssssss>it be definitely thin and could use more flavor and certainly a more robust nose , but it be quite drinkable and very smooth .<ssssss>i would not be displeased to toss back a few of these on occasion .<ssssss>
7 8 6 5 7		give my polish heritage , i always like to give they brew a shot .<ssssss>this offering come in a 16.9 oz .<ssssss>bottle .<ssssss>the smell consist of a great floral hop nose .<ssssss>the head be bleach white and about a half inch .<ssssss>the body be straw color and completely transparent .<ssssss>sadly , there really be not much character in the taste .<ssssss>there be some malted crispness but generally give a water down feeling .<ssssss>the aftertaste smooth out and leave a small floral residue .<ssssss>not a great brew ... .<ssssss>
6 8 9 7 8		ok , a little late for summer but this wheat pour a cloudy straw yellow with a slight amount of white head that fade quickly .<ssssss>the smell be good ; it be all sweet banana and what seem like a healthy lemon lime edge , with a bit of orange as well .<ssssss>glug glug glug the flavor be unique and at the same time , still rather control .<ssssss>the finish be where the citrus make itself know and the mellow banana flavor ride under the whole palate .<ssssss>the wheat flavor be a little lack in this and the overall flavor be a bit watery , although the texture be less so .<ssssss>not a bad wheat but i feel that once again , it be not stand out enough , although i would consider get it again in the summer ... make fresher .<ssssss>
7 8 5 7 6		pour into a wide chalice , this beer be a cloudy orange-amber color , with only a slight head atop it .<ssssss>the aroma be quite perfumy -- lot of coriander , good waft of curacao , and a light wheat scent .<ssssss>plenty of coriander to the taste as well , but the sourness be over the edge and do not fit in well with the style .<ssssss>still , the flavor be good , with all the requisite of a wit and more .<ssssss>the body be unusually thin and watery , though .<ssssss>i love strong wit generally , but this one do not stand up well .<ssssss>
7 5 3 3 5		12.7 oz bottle pour into a nonic .<ssssss>pour a pale yellow color , with a mild haze .<ssssss>three finger of tight white head top it off , and last for a couple minute .<ssssss>aroma be of light malt , with a stale quality .<ssssss>light floral hop be in the background , along with a hint of vanilla .<ssssss>not impressive in the nose .<ssssss>taste be watery , with hint of pale malt and floral hop .<ssssss>little else .<ssssss>finish with a touch of pale malt .<ssssss>very thin and weak in profile .<ssssss>mouthfeel be water thin .<ssssss>finish with no residual flavor .<ssssss>drinkability be bad .<ssssss>this brew be very weak in flavor , not to mention the watery texture .<ssssss>not impressive .<ssssss>
6 8 8 6 6		aroma - roasted malt like crystal malt to be specific .<ssssss>appearance - dark brown with a brown tan head that quickly dissipate .<ssssss>taste - roasted malt and then ton of bitter hop and chocolate .<ssssss>maybe too much bitterness for my taste .<ssssss>i think i be too sensitive to hop to enjoy this beer .<ssssss>not enough of the roasted malt to redeem this for I .<ssssss>note - good mouthfeel with a decent level of carbonation .<ssssss>
4 3 3 3 7		appearance : clear dandelion-yellow with a amber tint .<ssssss>white head .<ssssss>no retention and no lacing .<ssssss>smell : skunk spray from the bottle upon opening , but thankfully dissipate rather quickly , leave only a slight tweak of skunkiness in my glass .<ssssss>besides that , there be kind of a grassy smell plus a odd sweetness , a cross between pee and pea .<ssssss>a fruity edge and some doughy yeast be also detectable .<ssssss>taste : so very , very weak .<ssssss>it be hard to identify anything other than corn and a dish soapy lemon pucker on the back of the tongue .<ssssss>i wish i have a lime .<ssssss>mouthfeel : unpleasant .<ssssss>drinkability : i have not say anything good about this beer , but this be certainly very drinkable if serve ice-cold with a lime .<ssssss>i actually prefer corona light , because it be slightly more refreshing ; this one have a strangely sticky mouthfeel .<ssssss>

6 7 9 8 8		a : pour a murky dark mahogany-red color ; fat two finger-width head , fade quickly ; slight retention ; slick head , with barely any lacing .<ssssss>s : earthy note with some wood , spice , and belgian yeast .<ssssss>t : start out with a sweet light yeasty flavor ; the carbonation open the flavor up almost immediately to reveal subtle earthy flavor with note of belgian yeast , some tartness , and a hint of spice ; finish dry with a slightly metallic linger yeastiness ; no hint of booze at all -- where be they hide the 9 % abv ?<ssssss>m : fairly thick and chewy despite the strong carbonation that tickle the tongue nicely as it open up the flavor .<ssssss>phenomenal mouthfeel .<ssssss>o : this be a great beer -- not exceptional -- but great .<ssssss>i would love to buy it again except that it cost $ 6.99 for a 33cl bottle , too much in my opinion .<ssssss>if you love belgian dubbel or belgian strong dark ale , then you will love this .<ssssss>
8 8 6 7 9		beer pour a rich copper color very appropriate for the fall season , nice white head appear with a stiff pour .<ssssss>aroma be bready with that signature fruity maltiness that great lakes have in so many of they beer .<ssssss>taste be on par with the style , toast malt , minimal hop presence , very nice with pork or spicy chicken dish .<ssssss>overall very tasty .<ssssss>mouthfeel be on medium-light bodied side but appropriate for the style .<ssssss>drinkability be very high .<ssssss>overall another winner from great lake , very good example of the style in my opinion , will definitely buy this every year .<ssssss>
9 6 8 9 9		immediately after pour this guy into a glass a thick head form and stay .<ssssss>very nice head retention with some good residue leave on the side of the glass .<ssssss>the appearence be great with a very dark cloudy brown hue underneath all the creamy white head .<ssssss>the nose reveal malty fruity ester .<ssssss>oh man , fantastic taste .<ssssss>the malty fruity ester that i expect to taste from the smell be mild and hidden .<ssssss>they be over power by a toast/biscuit flavor that crisp the tounge beautifully .<ssssss>this beer have a thicker mouthfeel with a slight bit of carbonation .<ssssss>overall i really enjoy this beer .<ssssss>the bottle advertise the `` world 's # 1 weissbier '' and they might be on to something .<ssssss>quite tasty and highly recommen .<ssssss>
6 10 7 9 8		750ml bottle pour into a tulip .<ssssss>no bottled date .<ssssss>huge thanks to mb2696 for the bottle !<ssssss>-lrb- a -rrb- - pour a cloudy reddish mahogany color that produce a decent off-white to tan head that dissipate fairly quickly to bubble .<ssssss>-lrb- s -rrb- - a spiciness of nutmeg & cinnamon with ample pumpkin , molasses , brown sugar , & maple syrup .<ssssss>wait , apparantly the pumpkin i smell must be yam !<ssssss>this smell amazing !<ssssss>nutty & sweet .<ssssss>i can see how this be call autumn maple , cause its perfect for fall .<ssssss>-lrb- t -rrb- - very rich with a dense molasses & maple spiciness .<ssssss>the sweetness of the yams come out caramel-like with ample nutmeg & cinnamon .<ssssss>definitely have more flavor & oomph than you average 6pk of pumpkin brew .<ssssss>-lrb- m -rrb- - a good carbonation level & balance of flavor .<ssssss>rather thick , almost a chewy feel due to how many yam be use in this .<ssssss>at first i didnt like how dense & almost chewy this be , but it grow on I the more i have of this .<ssssss>for what this be , the thick mouthfeel doesnt bother I .<ssssss>-lrb- d -rrb- - a very interesting & unique brew that really suit the fall & early winter season .<ssssss>the yam use instead of pumpkin create a nice rustic feel to the beer .<ssssss>full-bodied & rich .<ssssss>ton of flavor ; alot more than you average brown ale/pumpkin beer .<ssssss>my new personal favorite for the fall season ... now if i can just acquire more of this somehow .<ssssss>the only thing that bother I be that this be under the belgain strong dark category ... doesnt fit it really at all .<ssssss>
2 4 2 5 7		from can to pint glass pour a very light yellow , like the color of you piss if you have be drink a lot of water .<ssssss>lot of bubbly carbonation , form a small 1/2 inch head that dissipate immediately -lrb- which be likely intend -rrb- .<ssssss>no lacing to speak of .<ssssss>the bubbly carbonation swiftly carry the bouquet , which be unfortunate because it smell like nothing .<ssssss>maybe faint hint of bulk wheat .<ssssss>yeast have a slight lemon note , hop be non-existent the taste be even less interesting .<ssssss>some whisper of toasty grain way in the background .<ssssss>lightly astringent citrus note from the yeast , really no hop .<ssssss>literally taste like a light lager mix with soda water .<ssssss>feel like soda water too , almost no oily complexion at all .<ssssss>so why be this one of the best-selling beer ?<ssssss>marketing alone do not explain it , although that be a big part of it .<ssssss>really , i think there be a large swath if people out there that do not like beer , or do not like it that much , and beer flavored water be palatable .<ssssss>grant this beer be not the worst tasting beer i have have , there be nothing off-putting .<ssssss>but that be a little like say the air in my mouth do not taste bad .<ssssss>
6 5 6 4 6		12 oz .<ssssss>, bottled on 5/15/06 .<ssssss>it pour into the weizen glass a haze yellow gold with a finger of white head and smell sugary with a wheat tang .<ssssss>the taste be very mild with note of grassy/skunky hop , light bitterness , maybe a touch of diacetyl , and a faint wheat tang on top of a light body that leave a short finish .<ssssss>overall a poor offering from a fairly respectable brewery .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 9		from 750ml bottle into tulip glass .<ssssss>a : cloudy yellow with white head , which stay there for long time .<ssssss>however big bubble on the head do not look good , a bit like soap foam .<ssssss>s : fresh and pleasant , but you can smell that this beer be strong , even though it be not the smell of alcohol .<ssssss>t : start with citrus and banana , then bread -lrb- and white pepper ? -rrb-<ssssss>kick in and pleasant bitter finish on palate .<ssssss>however lack character .<ssssss>i have be expect something more exciting .<ssssss>unfortunately taste do not mask alcohol sufficiently .<ssssss>m : alcohol too intensive .<ssssss>too much carbonation .<ssssss>d : i be about to finish the bottle , so i guess it be ok .<ssssss>nice beer for summer evening .<ssssss>
8 4 7 7 7		pick it up on a whim .<ssssss>pour a very thick amber brown with a somewhat tan head .<ssssss>very cloudy liquid with a continual stream of small bubble rise to the surface , which keep a small ring of foam around the edge of my glass after the head have go .<ssssss>smell be very mild and nothing i notice about it stand out .<ssssss>taste be almost too sweet but with a small taste of hop at the end .<ssssss>the malt do not stand out for I .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be pleasantly thicker than i expect and fairly smooth .<ssssss>over all a decent enough beer , i just do not find the same feel other poster here have .<ssssss>taste more american than belgian to I , which be ok .<ssssss>i agree that this be one for sip , but nothing wrong with that , be there ?<ssssss>
8 6 6 5 8		karl strauss be a decent organization that i think suffer from try to please too many people .<ssssss>be a brewpub , they aim at appeal to beer nut , but at the same time , they position themselves as a kind of beer-themed family restaurant .<ssssss>this be a tricky balance to acheive , and there be some overlap in those two scheme , but beer-wise , it guide they to aim for the middle .<ssssss>this beer -lrb- along with most of they lineup -rrb- exemplify that .<ssssss>the beer be clean and crisp and easy to drink , but largely unremarkable .<ssssss>it have some pleasant malty-toffee note with a hint of toastyness , but give a decent hoppy zing , it would have be considerably more interesting .<ssssss>i be not say they should remake arrogant bastard , i be just say that i would like this beer more if it have a little hoppy dryness in the finish and just a frisson of hop perfume in the nose .<ssssss>aim for accessibility be one thing , and this beer be quite accessible , but even so , when i be in the k.s .<ssssss>in universal citywalk , the people at the next table display they preconception when they pick out the `` endless summer light lager '' as they fave , say of the red , `` we do not like those dark beer '' .<ssssss>the problem be , you can not please everybody .<ssssss>it look like they be please enough to stay in business , at any rate .<ssssss>
6 7 4 6 6		sampler at san francisco rogue public house .<ssssss>ach !<ssssss>this be a disappointment .<ssssss>visually we have a golden body with a rocky white head .<ssssss>dry bready aroma be probably the best part of the beer .<ssssss>the flavour have wheat and citrus , but doesnt really work for I , and seem somewhat thin .<ssssss>
8 5 8 5 5		on tap @ the double mountain brewery & taproom -lrb- hood river , or -rrb- on 8/28/11 .<ssssss>serve in a pint glass .<ssssss>pour a haze copper initially -lrb- which do clear out a bit after a while -rrb- , top with a finger of bright-white head .<ssssss>this retain with about roughly a finger of thin foaminess , throw up a robust cascade of frothy lacing that cling to the side in rich swath .<ssssss>the aroma smell leafy and a little herbal , with note of bitter fruit underneath .<ssssss>the malt have a sweet grainy feel to they along the edge of the nose .<ssssss>im honestly not get a whole lot of complexity at all out of this .<ssssss>just some flat and green feeling bitterness , along with some residual sweetness .<ssssss>this be bit disappointing .<ssssss>bitter fruit and pine spread a resinous and pithy bitterness out into the mouth .<ssssss>there be a general feeling sweet balancing effect here from the malt but the hoppy finish on this be strong , with pith , pine , and spice all stick a bit too harshly on the palate .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be medium body , with a lively crispness that quickly give way to a creamy and much smoother feel .<ssssss>i will say that the alcohol be nicely hide here , which help out the overall feel here a lot .<ssssss>wow , i be expect so much more from this .<ssssss>there just really wasnt much complexity , definition , or most of all robustness to the hop profile and even the malt didnt bring much to this beyond a neutral feeling sweetness .<ssssss>this be just a flat feeling ipa .<ssssss>the look and feel be the only factor keep this in the game at all .<ssssss>so underwhelming .<ssssss>
9 7 7 9 8		12 oz into a pint a - pour a heavy dark brown color - almost black .<ssssss>amber highlight .<ssssss>head formation be light , with just 1mm of mocha color head , which break down to a film .<ssssss>s - light amount of roasted barley .<ssssss>a small amount of yeasty bready note .<ssssss>very grainy .<ssssss>t - big time roasted malt on the front end - chocolate and 2-row dominate .<ssssss>some dry grainy malt note .<ssssss>continue mid-stream where a light amount of bitterness appear , only a hint of hop .<ssssss>finish with more of the acidic bite grainy malt edge .<ssssss>light phenolic burn in the aftertaste .<ssssss>m - moderate body for a ris .<ssssss>carbonation build more of a backbone than normal - sting at time .<ssssss>leave a sugar malt cling to the tongue .<ssssss>d - moderate drinkability .<ssssss>abv be average for a ris , but stinging nonetheless .<ssssss>well hide .<ssssss>not fill , despite its stronger carbonation profile .<ssssss>all you would have to do be dial back the carbonation and i could see this be the perfect ris .<ssssss>
6 8 4 7 7		revisit this beer for round two after a unpleasant first encounter .<ssssss>first time around , i be not prepare for the fruit beer -lrb- have never have one before -rrb- and think it rather sicken .<ssssss>serve this one from the bottle into a beer glass .<ssssss>pour a dusty amber , very thin white head , ample carbonation streaming from the glass 's bottom and side .<ssssss>smell strongly of cherry -- dry or candy , but definitely mature and sweeten more than a fresh cherry scent .<ssssss>taste be very similar to the smell , seem to finish a bit harsh at first but smooth out markedly as the beer go on .<ssssss>a bit of a pucker taste , feel very fizzy and carbonated , too .<ssssss>might be difficult to quaff more than a few of these between the strong flavor and the carbonation .<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 8		a - pour a medium gold color .<ssssss>the egg shell head top out at about a finger deep and stick around for a minute or two .<ssssss>the abundance of active carbonation keep a thick layer of foam on top almost all the way through the beer .<ssssss>some lacing be leave behind as well .<ssssss>s - start out with a clean grainy aroma .<ssssss>midway there be some cream corn and a touch of alcohol .<ssssss>light hop spiciness be in there as well .<ssssss>finish off with a light smell of raw bread dough .<ssssss>i know surly can make some pretty good smell beer but this be definitely not one of they .<ssssss>t - now , that be better .<ssssss>the flavor that be present and account for here work well together .<ssssss>white bread start it all off .<ssssss>grain be present but not as much as in the nose .<ssssss>alcohol be very hard to detect in the flavor .<ssssss>it be a little sweet with a spicy -lrb- almost peppery -rrb- hop presence .<ssssss>this beer make a strong case for lack of complexity not always be a bad thing .<ssssss>m - lighter side of medium body with a healthy level of carbonation that keep the palate tingle .<ssssss>this be a very smooth and creamy brew overall .<ssssss>finish start out sweet and end up with the hop that give it kind of a spicy twang .<ssssss>d - drinkability be pretty good for the hell .<ssssss>flavor be mild .<ssssss>alcohol be low .<ssssss>it be very smooth .<ssssss>that be pretty much the trifecta of a easy drinking brew .<ssssss>the aroma could probably use a little work but that be really about it .<ssssss>i could easily see this beer find a niche in the concert / sport event crowd .<ssssss>give the current distribution , i probably would not seek this one out again .<ssssss>if give the chance though , i would probably never turn it down either .<ssssss>
8 7 8 9 7		22oz bomber purchase from the brewery in munster , in .<ssssss>share with mrmanning .<ssssss>pour a hazy amber hue with one finger of white foam , a few dot of lacing on the tulip , and some sediment in the body .<ssssss>smell and taste be apricot , peach , lemon zest , orange rind , fresh cut grass , pineapple , doughy malt , caramel , fruity ester , gooseberry , white grapefruit , pithy and resinous hop bitterness to end .<ssssss>i get a slightly `` off '' aroma , almost like industrial cleaner or vinegar , but aside from that the nose be quite entice , and the flavour be spot on for a dipa .<ssssss>mouthfeel be slick , medium body , astringent grapefruit bitterness linger in the bone dry finish .<ssssss>the 100 ibus be evident on the palate .<ssssss>overall , this solid imperial ipa do not compare to dreadnaught , but it be still a impressive example of the style with very enjoyable flavour and aroma .<ssssss>worth buy imo .<ssssss>
10 7 10 8 8		mug .<ssssss>a : midnight black , with a dense and frothy cappuccino head .<ssssss>some excellent lacing with uncanny retention , much like say cappuccino .<ssssss>just gorgeous -lrb- give this one a 5 , and rarely do on look -rrb- .<ssssss>s : mocha coffee , some burnt malt , and caramel .<ssssss>t : the birch and honey come through at first , fuse with some very mild hop bitters .<ssssss>toffee touch , a coffee core , and some woodsy , cedar-y lingering .<ssssss>wonderfully balanced and superbly mild .<ssssss>m : the feel really follow the appearance ; no false advertising here .<ssssss>and the feel be as great as the look .<ssssss>it coat , without oiling-up , and its subtlety be its strength .<ssssss>another 5 .<ssssss>i truly enjoy this ris , and will go back to it .<ssssss>

9 9 10 8 8		wow .<ssssss>this be one hell of a beer .<ssssss>i be think that the pepper use in this beer must be of a smoky variety , because i be definitely get some of that on the palate .<ssssss>this beer be a perfectly implement european imperial stout .<ssssss>i say european to differentiate it from its -lrb- significantly -rrb- more hoppy american cousin .<ssssss>i can not think of a beer i see that be blacker than this .<ssssss>i could barely see through even the thinnest portion of this beer .<ssssss>this be a malty , dry , thick and decadent stout with hint of chocolate and smoke .<ssssss>the chili impart a mild , build warmth on the finish .<ssssss>really , i feel this be a unique beer that should be try if you have the chance .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 8		review from note .<ssssss>taste from bottle at lush west town .<ssssss>pour peach orange with a fluffy and long-lasting tan head .<ssssss>nose be fresh , tart raspberry with a hint of chewable vitamin and some funk and sweet syrup .<ssssss>the flavor be sweet and tart raspberry with a sour and funky note and solid acidity .<ssssss>the body be light with lively carbonation and a long tart finish .<ssssss>
9 8 8 9 6		12 oz bottle pour into a corsendonk christmas stem glass .<ssssss>no date .<ssssss>a - one finger dark and dense tan head with a completely opaque body .<ssssss>not much to look at , but fit the style well .<ssssss>s - dark roasted chocolate malt with some cocoa and coffee note but also very dry wheat with a little alcohol spicy burn .<ssssss>t - hearty and rich of dark , heavily roasted chocolate malt .<ssssss>so heavily roasted that there be a very bitter coffee-like flavor go on .<ssssss>strong spicy alcoholic finish .<ssssss>m - viscous and full-bodied , it be not syrupy , but it sure be a thick beer .<ssssss>bitter and slightly astringent on the finish as well as dry .<ssssss>d - good beer that deserve time for sip and warm for nuance to be pull out .<ssssss>hard drinkability but a very good sipper .<ssssss>
7 8 5 8 7		a lively tan head snap and crackle , quickly recede to the tiniest ring .<ssssss>the color be lovely -- a perfectly clear copper .<ssssss>smell of morning country biscuit pair with some savory peanut and cashew and a light bubblegum sweetness .<ssssss>earthy hop be apparent , as be a pleasant and very subtle roastiness .<ssssss>like stick you head inside a bakery .<ssssss>interesting .<ssssss>malt be just one notch past biscuity and toe the toast range .<ssssss>strangely almond-sweet , almost tangy .<ssssss>nutty malt be great .<ssssss>strike a great balance .<ssssss>the body be light and watery and the carbonation high .<ssssss>meh .<ssssss>a six of this would go back easily and quickly .<ssssss>a extremely solid and drinkable lager and my favorite offering from leinenkugel so far .<ssssss>
6 6 4 6 6		in keep with the name , far more ruby in the black/ruby color scheme than more traditional stout .<ssssss>aroma and taste both feature coffee and chocolate , with the nose add wine and smoke .<ssssss>far thinner than i expect , a slight watery quality .<ssssss>easy to drink .<ssssss>outside of a hint in the aroma i do not detect a strong port wine influence .<ssssss>too thin , too blah .<ssssss>not bad , but i will not be return to it at $ 4.00 / bottle .<ssssss>
8 9 7 7 7		a : pour a dark red , almost brown .<ssssss>finger-width head .<ssssss>there be a little bit of lacing leave behind .<ssssss>s : i can smell some brown sugar and nut , with alcohol linger in the background .<ssssss>t : malt and nut be the name of the game .<ssssss>it be not quite a rich as i would expect from the smell .<ssssss>m : medium-bodied , though a lot cleaner than i expect .<ssssss>not bad at all .<ssssss>d : a little blander than i have expect , especially after that first whiff , but a solid brown ale .<ssssss>the kind of beer i look forward to when the leaf begin to fall .<ssssss>
7 7 4 6 6		pour into a pint glass .<ssssss>3.5 a : one of the finest , frothy head i have see .<ssssss>orange-amber color with some sediment suspend that slowly fall to the bottom .<ssssss>i do not know if it have be bottle condition or not , but the sediment be a bit of a turn off .<ssssss>plenty of lacing .<ssssss>3.5 s : citrus hop come through the hardest .<ssssss>next be floral hop and biscuity malt .<ssssss>3.0 t : not really sure what to think here .<ssssss>it start off strong , but then the flavor dwindle down to nothing .<ssssss>bitterness from grassy hop .<ssssss>some grapefruit .<ssssss>2.0 m : this be one of the oddest and unpleasant mouthfeel i have have .<ssssss>it be as if there be way too much priming sugar use .<ssssss>far too much carbonation and a bone dry finish .<ssssss>3.0 d : aside from the mf , this beer have a decent flavor and be balance enough to warrant another one .<ssssss>
6 4 6 8 7		nothing spectactular here , but that could be the beauty of harpoon .<ssssss>every year , they consistently come out with good seasonal , and the occasional specialty .<ssssss>the octoberfest pour the usual amber color , and the aroma be very slight .<ssssss>the taste be slightly bitter , but very smooth for a octoberfest .<ssssss>still every year when i try my first octoberfest , i be really only count down until my first winter .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 6		pour a copper color with very little to no white head which produce no lacing .<ssssss>smell be faintly malty & a little hop taste be very little malt and a little hop bitterness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very thin with a lot of carbonation .<ssssss>this be not a very good bock .<ssssss>taste be not bad , but it do not have the sweet maltiness you expect from a good bock .<ssssss>if you like a good bock , stay away from this one .<ssssss>
8 7 5 6 7		i realize this have be classify in ba under belgian strong dark however as far as i know this be the only instance of a belgian brewery make a stout which be intend to be a `` belgian style '' stout -lrb- or at least that be what the bottle would imply -rrb- .<ssssss>a : color be medium dark brown with definitive ruby overtone .<ssssss>light tan head top off the glass with ok to medium retention .<ssssss>very little lacing look oily .<ssssss>s : belgian yeast shine through for sure ... fruit , strawberry ?<ssssss>milk chocolate dip raisin perhaps .<ssssss>yep it smell like a box of raisinette .<ssssss>t : first off despite the implication of the poor head this stuff be super carbonate ... too much so .<ssssss>it interfere with the tasting process .<ssssss>cocoa bitterness i suppose be what be qualify this as a belgian `` stout '' .<ssssss>ever other quality would lead I in the direction of a belgian strong dark ... in fact i be still incline to call it one ... albeit not a very good one .<ssssss>perhaps belgian stout be a term amongst belgian brewer to refer to everyday strong dark -lrb- the plebeian variety -rrb- .<ssssss>i digress ... some spice be present as well as some earthy note .<ssssss>overall this be a bit out of wack .<ssssss>m : cactus d : high in that you cant taste the alcohol but low in that its not good ... all in all ill go with medium .<ssssss>

6 8 5 7 8		another hefeweizen that be very good on hot summer day .<ssssss>it definitely have that citrusy tang that be common with the style .<ssssss>it be very drinkable , and price reasonably in this part of the usa .<ssssss>alcohol be respectable at a little under 5.0 % abv .<ssssss>the downside : it could have a bit more carbonation , and feel a little thin on the mouth .<ssssss>
6 5 8 7 9		pour rather thin and without the creamy head i be hope for .<ssssss>look a little `` light '' for a stout .<ssssss>slight to moderate smell of coffee and charcoal , maybe a little chocolate .<ssssss>nice smooth taste , but would have prefer it to be a little thicker .<ssssss>nice on the palate , but again , a little watery for my taste .<ssssss>a very `` drinkable '' stout .<ssssss>this be another quality brew from we friend at dogfish , but it could use a little work .<ssssss>
6 4 7 7 8		pick this up as a six for 4.49 .<ssssss>note the brewing date be only a month ago so i know it be fresh .<ssssss>since i read about it on a falstaff website and i would see this locally , i figure i would try it .<ssssss>i vaguely remember my uncle liking this back in 1974 .<ssssss>-lrb- when i be young , my uncle have a basement full of beer sign that be not neon and most light up .<ssssss>the best be the blatz sign that fill up a glass over and over . -rrb-<ssssss>this pour with little head , and smell way skunky .<ssssss>the first bottle i open , after a sniff i go `` whoa '' in disgust .<ssssss>i think heiny , or other `` skunk smell '' beer .<ssssss>it have a very unusual taste .<ssssss>i do not like this type of beer taste back then , but now my palette be more experienced .<ssssss>if it make a very good sip beer .<ssssss>it be very alcohol-tasting dumb with a little foam action that help wash it down .<ssssss>i could not find a nasty taste in this beer .<ssssss>it do not come close to micro ale but for the price/quality , this be worth every penny .<ssssss>
9 8 10 9 8		pour this into a imperial pint glass .<ssssss>a = very dark colour .<ssssss>no light go through .<ssssss>pour rather well , a little viscous .<ssssss>oily appearance .<ssssss>form a half inch whitesh/brownish head .<ssssss>dissipate quickly and only a tiny film of whiter carbonation remain at the top with very decent lacing .<ssssss>s = coffee and chocolate , maybe a little molasses in the background , although smell be not as strong as the taste .<ssssss>t = superior flavor .<ssssss>coffee , caramel and molasses .<ssssss>bitter dry finish .<ssssss>open up as it warm .<ssssss>m = a little viscous , but rather palatable .<ssssss>somewhat bitter .<ssssss>very slight carbonation .<ssssss>not as thick as other imperial stout but very enjoyable .<ssssss>very silky on the palate and the slight carbonation feel perhaps like a butterfly fart inside the beer -lrb- i mean this in a good way -rrb- .<ssssss>d = excellent .<ssssss>this be a extraordinary beer .<ssssss>maybe not as strong as other example of the style .<ssssss>particularly milder than american interpretation , but still a damn good beer .<ssssss>balance be great and it be one fine sippin ' beer .<ssssss>at 7 % abv it be not one of the strongest out there for the style , so very drinkable .<ssssss>i would rather enjoy this one slowly , but if press , i be sure i could down a four pack with ease .<ssssss>
7 7 4 5 5		22 ounce bottle purchase from liquid solution in oregon for about six dollar pour into my chimay goblet with a thin black color that resemble water down oil , 1/2 light tan head that settle almost immediately , no retention and no lacing smell have strong coffee right up front , some roasted malt , burn aroma , coal , charcoal , also a faint scent of cherry taste be ton of coffee throughout , it overpower everything and it be veryu one dimensional , do not get sweeter at any point which i find interesting , porter typically get sweeter as it warm in my experience , dry sensation in the finish almost make I feel like i need a glass of water along with it , need some hoppiness or unroasted malt to balance out the coffee flavor , not much to brag about here body be thin and this one be way too carbonated , taste do not last long at all , very weak mouthfeel overall could not even get through the bottle myself , have to give some to a friend , super heavy and taste be tiresome , even though alcohol be low this one be not very drinkable , need to be a lot smoother one of the worst beer i have have from midnight sun , big disappointment after look forward to try this one for so long , not recommend unless you be a fan of coffee beer , but then i would not even think it be too good<ssssss>
7 9 7 7 7		12oz bottle pour into my bruery tulip .<ssssss>pour dark black with a three finger head , good lacing and a head that stay .<ssssss>the aroma on this be crazy good .<ssssss>malt , coffee and a irish cream aroma , smell even better than it taste .<ssssss>taste be similar to the nose yet less dynamic .<ssssss>not as complex as aroma , malt and coffee .<ssssss>a decent mouthfeel but not spectacular .<ssssss>very good but not great .<ssssss>

7 9 4 6 4		a bottle that be be in my cellar for at least a year , probably more like 2 .<ssssss>split this with the wife , and holy cat ... .<ssssss>wish we have more people here to share it with we .<ssssss>awesome nose ... .<ssssss>i could sit here and just sniff it ... color be nice , i expect a darker color for some odd reason , but the color be perfect too .<ssssss>i really like this as a sipper , but it would have be fantastic as a lower abv brew for more anytime drinking .<ssssss>very drinkable for 18 % , but like i say , i would like something with a little less kick .<ssssss>nice beer , worth a try , but not something i would probably purchase again .<ssssss>i be glad i have hold onto it .<ssssss>
6 5 5 6 4		one of the most overrated beer ever .<ssssss>hold up appearance wise , a little thinner than i would like , but look the part of a traditional english brown ale .<ssssss>do not like the aroma , what be that , dirt ?<ssssss>no hop at any stage in this beer .<ssssss>taste have a mildly enjoyable sweetness , but not enough malt heft for I to appreciate it .<ssssss>mouthfeel , too simplistic to enjoy .<ssssss>drinkability , too expensive to be drinkable .<ssssss>
8 10 6 7 6		33cl into a tulip .<ssssss>pour a pure butterscotch , nice frothy head , considerable lacing .<ssssss>lot more of darker fruit than typical in the aroma for the style .<ssssss>citrus , spice and candy , uplifting , sweet and clean with zero funk .<ssssss>unusual , very nice .<ssssss>atypical taste for the style as well .<ssssss>blindfold i would say a strong pale , a nice one at that .<ssssss>honey be strong in the flavor , again no funk , zero sour .<ssssss>medium body prickly mouthfeel .<ssssss>mediocre as a saison but nice as something else unique cheer jd<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		sample may 2011 same color head and body , three-finger thick head in large tripel karmeliet tulip ; lot of lacing .<ssssss>aroma of hemp oil , pine be definitely dominant ; the hemp character almost have a nuttiness to it that one find in actual hemp seed .<ssssss>there be a touch of garlic chive here , though it be not so much that i find it objectionable .<ssssss>there be a big , hop-fruit character underneath the up front hop character that be big on lychee and floral apricot as well as some actual spicy floral note .<ssssss>there be a nice bite bitterness up front in my first sip and this bitterness continue through to the finish where it be clean and bite ; it be actually quite a bit more clean than i would have guess it would be .<ssssss>up front the herbaceous , hemp oil dankness pervade the palate , but there be a lot of tropical fruit and ripe floral fruit note that compete with the herbal note in the middle of a sip .<ssssss>the fruit character be also find up front of each sip , though it doesnt linger much in the finish ; flavor of lychee , floral tangerine , the herbal note be actually a bit more dominant than the fruit character here .<ssssss>interestingly enough the hop character be big enough in this beer -lrb- at least today -rrb- that i be not notice the malt as much as i do in the hallertau mittelfrueh .<ssssss>the malt character , while more subtle add note of toasty , caramelize whole grain , light biscuit note and some cracker like note .<ssssss>the herbal character be a bit astringent at time , though it be not nearly as much as many a ipa .<ssssss>the body of this beer be still a bit more chewy and viscous than i would prefer in a ipa , though it be perhaps a touch more balanced than the hallertau mittelfrueh version , or at least the hop be more aggressive enough that it hide the chewy body a bit more .<ssssss>the simcoe hop character have a nice balance between sharper , herbaceous note and softer , juicier fruity hop note ; for those that like a good balance between this hop character , this hop can do it on its own .<ssssss>i usually prefer a bit more focus on the tropical fruit and citrus hop character in my ipa , but this be still quite tasty .<ssssss>
9 7 10 8 9		pitch black and ooze from the bottle , this stout develop a inch of foamy , mocha head that last a couple of minute , but leave a nice sticky layer along the edge of the glass all of the way down .<ssssss>smell be definitely chocolate and roasted malt , with a small amount of caramel come through , but just barely .<ssssss>i find the scent slightly underdeveloped , or lack in presence .<ssssss>the main taste here be dark chocolate and milk chocolate , a wonderful balance of bitter and sweet .<ssssss>more sweetness come from the smoky , roasted malt and more bitterness from hint of coffee bean .<ssssss>sort of a oak taste overall , i would not be surprise if this sit in barrel of oak before head to the bottler .<ssssss>great feeling as you drink it , very creamy at first , but nothing syrupy that stick with you after the swallow .<ssssss>be medium body and not incredibly aggressive would make this a highly drinkable beer , sort of high in alcohol content , but you would never notice , and that could be a problem if you be drink a few ...<ssssss>
8 7 7 9 8		it be a delicious , smooth black lager with a medium tan head .<ssssss>the hop be light and the predominant flavor be that of the toast malt .<ssssss>as with many deutsche beer , it be a clean , no nonsense example of the type of beer it say it be .<ssssss>my friend jana at work see I look at brewing stuff on line last year , and it get we talk about some great beer we would try recently .<ssssss>she tell I about this black lager -lrb- kostritzer schwartbier -rrb- from a german brewery , kostritzer , that she husband bring home from germany when he travel over there , and a few day later she bring I a bottle !<ssssss>i be touch that she would share it with I , even more so after i try it .<ssssss>it be a delicious , smooth black lager with a medium tan head .<ssssss>the hop be light and the predominant flavor be that of the toast malt .<ssssss>as with many deutsche beer , it be a clean , no nonsense example of the type of beer it say it be .<ssssss>now , i do not speak -lrb- or read -rrb- german , but i be pretty sure the label say the brewery -lrb- brauerei -rrb- be establish -lrb- seit -rrb- in 1543 -lrb- 1543 -rrb- .<ssssss>that mean they have be make beer for almost 4000 year .<ssssss>i do not do math in german either .<ssssss>a little over a month ago i get a message from jana say she husband have come back from germany , this time with a case of kostritzer for I !<ssssss>once again blow away by jana 's thoughtfulness , i have have enough to share with friend and family who all agree that this old school brewery know what they be do .<ssssss>they 4 millennia of practice have certainly pay off .<ssssss>
6 4 3 7 7		this beer 's a extremely clear , light yellow .<ssssss>there be a small white head during pour , but that disappear instantly .<ssssss>there do , however , seem to be a trail of bubble jet out the stem of my chili pepper , which be float on top of my now-headless pint .<ssssss>the aroma be surprisingly malty for such a light-colored beer , and have only a very slight hint of hot pepper in it , which i would never pick out in a blind test .<ssssss>the body in the first sip be extremely thin , with a slight light malt taste , but as i be realize that , my attention be quickly draw to the burning sensation start at the back and side of my throat , which rapidly intensify and spread .<ssssss>with each sip i can get a quick flavor of malt before the pepper take over and seem to attack my whole mouth and throat and even crawl up into my sinus .<ssssss>as i drink on , i get more use to the spiciness , and the pepper actually have a pretty nice flavor .<ssssss>with my palate attenuate to the spice , i think i can actually pull a slight hop character out from below in the finish .<ssssss>this be a very interesting beer , and in my opinion , enjoyable for what it be .<ssssss>my imagination run away with the possibility for food pairing !<ssssss>but i do not know if that in itself make it a good beer .<ssssss>the pepper flavor and spice seem to stand completely separate from the beer .<ssssss>it would be great if it be somehow better blended , or support by a base beer with some more interesting , complementary , flavor .<ssssss>

8 5 6 4 6		not offensive and not desirable .<ssssss>a : amber to copper .<ssssss>bit of a creamy head that disappear pretty quickly .<ssssss>no lace .<ssssss>s : mostly absent .<ssssss>maybe some caramel or light toasty malt .<ssssss>t : some malt and some sweet .<ssssss>faint toast with a little more caramel .<ssssss>go down easy .<ssssss>nothing to get excite about but nothing to turn you nose up at .<ssssss>
8 4 6 6 7		a : the pour be a clear brown with red highlight and a off-white foam that leave nearly as quickly as it arrive .<ssssss>s : the aroma be not all that pleasant .<ssssss>a definite metallic scent come from the glass along with some sweet , sweet grain .<ssssss>i normally like some nuttiness to my brown ale .<ssssss>t : the beer be very sweet .<ssssss>a definite caramel and toffee flavor to it with a ever so faint touch of nuttiness on the finish .<ssssss>a mild hop bitterness , but not enough to quite cut through the sweetness .<ssssss>m : the body of the beer be a bit thin , but not horrible .<ssssss>the level of carbonation be moderate .<ssssss>d : i use to enjoy this beer , but i be no longer sure why .<ssssss>it be alright in the flavor department , but nothing spectacular and the nose be quite off-putting .<ssssss>
9 9 8 10 8		pour a deep dark chocolate with a lite tan 3 finger head .<ssssss>lacing be thick in several place but not thru-out smell of chocolate and roasted malt nice mouthfeel , perfect carbonation and aftertaste for a stout very good taste .<ssssss>nice blend of malt , caramel and hint of dark chocolate and espresso<ssssss>
7 5 7 7 7		pony express original wheat pour a deep gold with a medium short-lived head with slight lacing .<ssssss>it be aroma be almost nonexistent , with -lrb- maybe -rrb- a faint smell of corn -lrb- ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the flavor be light .<ssssss>actually , there be a pleasant balance of wheat , barley and corn , with a fairly dry finish .<ssssss>i think this be what the ` big 3 ' * wish * they could accomplish as the all american beer .<ssssss>carbonation be decent with nary a aftertaste .<ssssss>in summary , this be a excellent summer beer which be somewhat reminiscent of sam adam summer gold , way back when .<ssssss>
8 6 8 9 10		okay so i be not do a normal -lrb- for I anyway -rrb- review here b/c i do not take note on this ... .<ssssss>i really just want to chill after a long drive and then a long flight so this be from memory ... .<ssssss>this be my favorite beer and i order more than one so it stick out for I so i think this abbreviated review be accurate !<ssssss>i believe we waiter say this be sit around 10 % alcohol but i will tell you , it sure do not taste like it ... .<ssssss>that be how smooth it be !<ssssss>also , this beer be a double hop , double malted version of the standard pil that they do , so we be tell !<ssssss>it have a really nice golden hued color with a moderate head that stick around for not a long period of time .<ssssss>it do not have much carbonation upon inspection and the lacing be decent .<ssssss>i do not think it smell much like a pilsener but then again i do notice the malt use ... .<ssssss>the hop be a little muted for the style i think .<ssssss>with that say though , i find this to taste wonderful , be smooth , malty , yet well hop on the finish , provide a crisp , but not overdo bitterness .<ssssss>my wife do not like this one , say it be too strong but i do not find that at all .<ssssss>drinkability be also excellent as i have a pint after we sampler platter and then again have this upon we second visit to the brewpub later in the evening .<ssssss>if you get a chance to try this one , i highly recommend it !<ssssss>
7 6 8 6 6		i be totally stoke to get my hand on this one .<ssssss>i be begin to truly appreciate the saison style and i love brett so this have to be a winner !<ssssss>right ?<ssssss>wrong .<ssssss>the aroma be all belgian yeast .<ssssss>standard saison with a steady dose of clove , a almost hefe like aroma .<ssssss>no brett to be find .<ssssss>th flavor be more of the same .<ssssss>it taste like any other saison on the market .<ssssss>very little brett charcter , no mustiness , no funk , no tartness .<ssssss>good mouthfeel .<ssssss>fairly hoppy for a saison also .<ssssss>it be a saison and it be really very average .<ssssss>i would happily drink it as long as someone else be pay for it .<ssssss>i would have never know there be brett in this beer if you do not tell I .<ssssss>bore in the grand scheme of thing .<ssssss>if you like saison i guess it be worth a try but at the price , i can find much better example of the style .<ssssss>
6 5 6 4 6		12 oz bottle .<ssssss>pour a nearly clear gold with 2-3 cm of foamy white head , quickly diminish .<ssssss>aroma of sweet malt .<ssssss>initial flavor be light and sweet , no real definitive flavor .<ssssss>aftertaste be mildly dry and long lasting .<ssssss>light body , light carbonation , light lacing , and no alcohol presence note .<ssssss>overall , anyone could drink this if other better beer be not around .<ssssss>
7 8 7 10 7		head dissapate rather quickly as most of the belgian strong dark ale do .<ssssss>i be surprised at how this beer mask its 12 % alcohol .<ssssss>it be more of a warming that any sort of medicinal taste .<ssssss>you can smell it however along with a burnt sugar smell .<ssssss>the taste be caramel and maybe tobacco in a good way .<ssssss>this be truly a mix between beer and liqueur .<ssssss>you could almost use a good cigar with this one !<ssssss>i wish the bottle be bigger .<ssssss>if you like this try the pere jaque by goose island .<ssssss>less abv -lrb- and less $ -rrb- but well do in the same style .<ssssss>
6 10 4 7 4		from the bottle , a recent -lrb- 76 -- -rrb- batch .<ssssss>a : hazy amber with a thin head that lace well but do not show the rockiness i would expect from this style .<ssssss>still without any sign of carbonation .<ssssss>s : from several foot away , the hop aroma be strong .<ssssss>grapefruit and pine be especially predominant .<ssssss>t : the back of the bottle say `` bite , bitter , and bruise '' and that it be .<ssssss>grapefruit dominate , almost mercilessly , but be keep barely in check by a piney , resiny finish .<ssssss>clear alcohol warm flavor as well .<ssssss>m : a ode to the hop that forget to back it up with a good malt sidekick .<ssssss>though it be refreshing and actually fairly light body for a dipa , it be ultimately too one-sided and the metallic ` alcohol ' note really go unchecked across the back of the tongue .<ssssss>overall , this be a strong and agressive beer with a few major flaw .<ssssss>i love that bell 's be go for something strong that be not a stout , but they seem to have abandon they golden rule -lrb- maximum realization of style , rather than experimentation with style -rrb- and end up with a less stellar product than i would have expect .<ssssss>worth a look once or twice , but it be too much like spiked grapefruit juice to be a great beer .<ssssss>
6 6 7 5 8		serve into pint glass with orange on location a - pour a unimpressive 3/4 finger white big bubbly head .<ssssss>body be the colour of diluted orange juice : very turbid , but still diaphanous .<ssssss>body be a milky white orange juice color .<ssssss>what little head there be shrink down to nothing in no time .<ssssss>s - smell very fruity .<ssssss>a bit of cantaloupe , and then this really strong artificial ` tropical ' scent , which include mango .<ssssss>really smell like a tropical flavoured sorbet ; not very pertainible to the witbier style .<ssssss>there be no hint of any add spice , the entire nose be completely dominate by this mango-pineapple syrupy sweetness .<ssssss>very disappointing .<ssssss>t - finally some of the wheat flavour come out , but the majority be the cloying tropical fruitiness .<ssssss>initial taste be the tropical fruit .<ssssss>underneath it all , in the mid ground , be this medium intensity wheat flavour , with some very noticeable yeast note .<ssssss>the fruitiess basically suck up anything that could easily be use to identify this beer with the witbier style .<ssssss>the taste be more orange like than anything else , maybe that why they serve a orange with it !<ssssss>but a witbier should not taste simply like orange-beer .<ssssss>the finish be almost bland , except for the persistent tropical orange flavour .<ssssss>maybe there be a touch of wheat or yeast during the absolute last stage of the finish .<ssssss>aftertaste be pretty usual and boring , almost the same as the initial , except the sweetness have be dull down to some degree ah ha !<ssssss>i just ask the bartender if they brew the beer with any fruit , and apparently they dump orange juice into it .<ssssss>so that explain a lot .<ssssss>mf & d - the drinkability be alright , its just too sweet for I .<ssssss>i can see why so many phony like this beer : it hardly taste like one .<ssssss>the feel be solid , plenty of carbonation and a decent thickness .<ssssss>
8 9 10 9 8		get a glass of this on draft during puckerfest at belmont station .<ssssss>serve in a tulip glass , the body be a pretty orange color with rise highlight , top by a wispy , thin , creamy layer of head .<ssssss>aroma of wine grape , peach , some general tropical fruit note , and a good dose of sour , all with a underlie layer of booze .<ssssss>palate be not overwhelmingly sour up front , but have good note of wine grape and ripe white peach .<ssssss>the tartness take over after the swallow , with a sour , fairly boozy finish that have a touch of astringency .<ssssss>body be just about perfect to convey the flavor here - more creamy than bubbly , it provide a substantial base that allow the fruit flavor to linger but never overpower the sour .<ssssss>this be a more approachable offering than the gueuze or other cantillon beer , but be still deliciously complex .<ssssss>well-done .<ssssss>
6 8 6 6 6		pour a murky , honey-like orange .<ssssss>no real head , just some white scim and bubble ring around the edge .<ssssss>look thick .<ssssss>hooray for blue bottle with paint label .<ssssss>at first 04 smell like sparkling cider than it be all sweet caramel malt , dark fruit , and booze .<ssssss>taste like a caramel kick in the ass .<ssssss>dark fruit such as plum and apricot become more evident as it warm .<ssssss>syrupy .<ssssss>linger like hard alcohol with a plum cough medicine aftertaste .<ssssss>absolutely no carbonation .<ssssss>not really `` alcohol warmth , '' so much as `` caramel alcohol on fire . ''<ssssss>i go into this one intend to sip on it like cognac and be not dissapointed .<ssssss>
9 8 4 7 6		bomber .<ssssss>sound like some barrel aged goodness come here .<ssssss>pour be dark , good carbonation .<ssssss>darker than i expectected , stouty look .<ssssss>smell be dark sugar , maple syrup , some cinammon in the back .<ssssss>barrel not as strong as i expect .<ssssss>taste bring the barrel to the front .<ssssss>dark sugar , vanilla , maple .<ssssss>maybe some fig , but this be not fruity overall .<ssssss>it be a boozy beer , but i would not call it hot .<ssssss>more barleywine than stout for sure , but not the usual complexity of a - bal barleywine .<ssssss>my taste bud memory immediately think of backwoods bastard on the first few sip .<ssssss>there be a dry and bitter aftertaste that be not pleasant .<ssssss>i do not know what it be from , but it be not welcome .<ssssss>screw up the mouthfeel somewhat .<ssssss>a good barrel aged beer .<ssssss>but i be not seek any more out .<ssssss>
3 4 2 4 4		12 fl oz bottle serve in a pilsner glass , review live : a - pour a transparent straw golden color with a extremely thin , white 1 finger head .<ssssss>retention be poor .<ssssss>generally unappealing .<ssssss>s - honey , clean barley , and light spice .<ssssss>extremely mild and simple .<ssssss>t - the ginger finally come through , but it be too subtle .<ssssss>the beer be sweeter than it ought to be .<ssssss>not really balanced very well .<ssssss>m - entirely too smooth and wet .<ssssss>the light body be nice , but it would be far better if it be more crisp .<ssssss>d - better than i think it would be , but far from good .<ssssss>
3 6 4 6 8		i first try this beer with a friend whom i hadent see in four year since he join the marine .<ssssss>i must say this be a great beer to drink and catch up on old time with a old friend .<ssssss>it pour a very clear pale color and smell floraly .<ssssss>it taste nice and smooth and be very drinkable it keep the conversation flow and taste good from start to finish .<ssssss>and afterall that all that matter .<ssssss>
8 5 7 7 6		16oz can from main party store in aa a - pour a slightly hazy deep burnt orange color , one-inch frothy white head with good retention and lacing s - pretty weak aroma , really need to get you nose down in it to smell anything , light caramel malt mixed hint of citrusy and grassy hop , no alcohol detectable t - orange citrus sweetness up front with a caramel and light biscuit malt flavor on the midpalate , finish be a mix of lightly bitter grassy hop and lighter sweet caramel malt , not much alcohol to speak of , the can do not have a abv , but i suspect it be & lt ; 5 % , overall , the taste be pretty clean and fairly refreshing , but not all that interesting m - medium-bodied , moderate carbonation , a bit of a creamy feel on the palate , well-balanced finish d - very easy-drinking and clean tasting , but the complexity be just not there to keep the beer very interesting , one can be enough for I , i could see this as a decent warm weather beer if you be hang around outside grilling , but there be better option for that as well always good to see a new brewery make a decent beer and even can it .<ssssss>i do not know anything about this place other than it be brew in royal oak , mi , as the can say in about 15 place .<ssssss>worth a try if you see it in you local store .<ssssss>
9 7 5 6 6		16oz can , no date .<ssssss>pour a darker , hazy amber-bronze with very thick , chunky white head resemble melt ice cream .<ssssss>scent carry tea-like note of hop , slightly floral , and sweetness from malt .<ssssss>sweet , grain-like malt with a mild forest hoppiness .<ssssss>the flavor be somewhat washed-out -lrb- watery -rrb- and finish not as dry as i prefer in a ipa .<ssssss>as state above , the body be fairly thin and watery , not what i expect in the style .<ssssss>a painfully average ale ; too sweet and not bitter/hoppy enough for a quality ipa .<ssssss>with the packaging i want to like this alot more than i do .<ssssss>
8 9 9 7 7		750ml cork a belgian strong ale from the canadian brewery , unibroue .<ssssss>pour a cloudy yellowish reddish brown .<ssssss>spec of yeast floating and oving throughout the glass .<ssssss>large light yellow-orange head , good stay power and lot of lacing on the glass .<ssssss>first sip , malty , as it warm and linger on the tongue , hoppy bitterness get strong fast .<ssssss>no indication of the 8 % abv this brew pack .<ssssss>a lot of carbonation so you can not drink it fast .<ssssss>very complex beer .<ssssss>overwhelming for my amateur taste bud .<ssssss>

10 6 5 6 6		bottle courtesy of okbeer : pour a deep golden color ale with a nice medium foamy head with some quite good retention and some really good lacing .<ssssss>aroma of cascade hop be provide some floral note as well as some medium bitterness .<ssssss>taste be mostly dominate by the mix of hop and i think be lace some malt characteristic .<ssssss>body be not as full as i would have expect with some great carbonation .<ssssss>i personally think that this beer could have be more rewarding with a bigger malt profile .<ssssss>
8 5 6 7 6		pour incredibly dark with only a small head that dissapate quickly .<ssssss>as for the taste ... wow .<ssssss>the first thing that hit you be all the chocolate , with some nice toasty note .<ssssss>i just wish it have a little more body and a longer finish .<ssssss>it start off really nicly on the palate ... and just end .<ssssss>i want more of that nice dark chocolate !<ssssss>waa .<ssssss>ah well , still a nice fall/winter brew for the cold month .<ssssss>
7 6 8 6 6		review from beeradvocate magazine issue # 33 -lrb- oct 2009 -rrb- : exclusively brew for the chain grocer fresh & easy , which have location in arizona , california and nevada .<ssssss>this be a good example of the grow trend of contract-brewed budget beer for large chain .<ssssss>do it put pressure on small craft brewery or the big guy ?<ssssss>not much of a head here , it all but dissipate after the first sip .<ssssss>filter clarity be a give .<ssssss>nothing notable in the aroma , no glaring flaw , which be not easy on this plain canvas of a beer .<ssssss>lager snap be a cinch in this light-bodied brew .<ssssss>crispness do hold on to a lot of the re - freshing quality .<ssssss>a little grainy , with some cook cereal grain in the middle .<ssssss>hop be meek with a lemony flavor .<ssssss>aftertaste be virtually clean .<ssssss>the survival of this brand will simply be its price point ; if it be not a budget beer , then it will have a tough road ahead .<ssssss>a no-nonsense choice for the american lager drinker .<ssssss>
7 7 6 5 7		really not my cup of tea ... 22oz .<ssssss>bomber pour into a glass .<ssssss>yellow and light orange color , minimal head with not much lacing .<ssssss>smell a bit of rub alcohol , oak , flame pepper ... and musty old cabin up in the mossy wood .<ssssss>perhaps i would like it better if i let it sit in the fridge for another 3 + year ... but west coast inspire ?<ssssss>do not taste it .<ssssss>too peppery and spicy ... a dry hop , but not a very floral one .<ssssss>really a oak barrel aged flavor .<ssssss>light malt presence .<ssssss>do not leave the mouth too dry .<ssssss>.<ssssss>woody aftertaste .<ssssss>.<ssssss>easy to drink ... do not taste as strong as it be .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but most likely wont buy it ... not a fan of belgium .<ssssss>.<ssssss>not one for I to stare at for 3 year .<ssssss>
7 4 5 6 5		copper color be nice .<ssssss>head be small tight bubble that be typical of what you would see on mainstream full-calorie beer that have half-way decent head retention .<ssssss>smell be really pretty unimpressive .<ssssss>hop odor be pretty faint for a product of this name .<ssssss>flavor seem really malty on the front end , and the hop be not really noticeable until the finish .<ssssss>again , this be underwhelming surprising for a product of this name .<ssssss>all in all , i be not impressed .<ssssss>i know that a-b must have a robust r & d capability .<ssssss>however , i do not feel that this product be a good demonstration of a capability that must exist within the nation 's largest brewer .<ssssss>
7 9 8 9 6		note : this bottle 's be under severe stress -- car trunk , almost-freezing refrigerator , you get the drill .<ssssss>only three day worth should leave it ok though , especially for the style .<ssssss>pour a mostly clear amber with a distinctively pale ale head -- splotchy , vary in size and thickness .<ssssss>some lacing .<ssssss>smell rather powerfully for the style .<ssssss>pine and apple .<ssssss>mouthfeel be peppy and zesty and just sticky enough on the back of my throat .<ssssss>taste be black-peppery , hoppy , bite and clean .<ssssss>grapefruit be strong on the roof of the mouth , not cloying much .<ssssss>some alcohol .<ssssss>strong lemon , but not orange or lime .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>
9 10 8 8 9		review of the 2004 `` p '' bottle , store since purchase in 2006 at 65 degree f. pour from the classic small bottle into a burgundy glass .<ssssss>a : pour a cloudy nut brown which clear into a gorgeous dark red-amber with brown edge .<ssssss>no head whatsoever be : upon pour the room fill with the aroma of dark caramel , toast walnut and cookie , with a foundation of oxidize , sherry-like sweetness .<ssssss>t : sweet sherry flavor and oxidation hit the palate first , follow immediately by strong toast walnut and nearly burnt caramel .<ssssss>sweet malt and a surprising amount of hop bitterness come next , which fade into more toast and linger bitterness in a long dry finish which hang around for full minute .<ssssss>as the beer warm to room temperature , a orange liqueur flavor like cointreau emerge in the background .<ssssss>delicious , but more bold and one-dimensional than subtle and richly layered .<ssssss>mf : round and full in the mouth with just a touch of carbonation , but not cloying despite the considerable sweetness .<ssssss>d : this bottle be delicious - probably the best bottle of this beer i have have , and by far better than the other three bottle from this four-pack drunk in '06 and '07 .<ssssss>definitely not what i remember from eldridge pope , but extraordinary in its own right .<ssssss>every bottle of thoma hardy be a crapshoot .<ssssss>evidently this be one of the very good one .<ssssss>
9 8 10 8 8		pour a cloudy copper color with lot of tightly carbonate off-white head .<ssssss>smell be nice and hoppy with a bit of caramel malt come through as well .<ssssss>taste be absolutely delicious .<ssssss>i really like the hop flavor throughout .<ssssss>bit of a dry finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel be great .<ssssss>this beer go down smooth and easy .<ssssss>this beer be really enjoyable .<ssssss>id really like to drink more of this one on a regular basis .<ssssss>
8 7 9 6 6		22oz bomber pour into a oversized wine glass -lrb- the remain 6 or so ounce will be enjoy later -rrb- .<ssssss>a - toast brown/ruby/copper color .<ssssss>it be hard to describe .<ssssss>a white 2cm head form , but disappear pretty quickly into nothing .<ssssss>s - grapefruit , pineapple , citrus hop , caramel malt , fruit .<ssssss>a slightly vinous quality to it .<ssssss>it be not that strong though .<ssssss>t - caramel malt , more fruitiness and the citrusy hop present in the nose .<ssssss>the hop be pretty weak for a fresh brew and it seem to be pretty balanced compare to other american barleywine i know of that be hop-heavy .<ssssss>m - nice , thick and undercarbonated .<ssssss>how i like my barleywine .<ssssss>d - i do not find this beer particularly spectacular .<ssssss>i have another bottle that i be hope will be better next year .<ssssss>
8 4 6 6 4		pour from a bottle , this brown ale hit the glass with just enough head and a medium brown opaque color .<ssssss>smell be somewhat awful ... cheap sweet rum mix with cola .<ssssss>little or no hop to the aroma .<ssssss>taste be thankfully not anything like the bacardus that the smell hint at .<ssssss>some roasted malt and caramel come through with little to no hop balance , but thankfully no rum ... i would definitley like to taste a little more hop presence .<ssssss>mouthfeel be just as a brown ale should be , not too thick but present and very consistent with its appearance .<ssssss>drinkability would be higher if i do not get the smell of rum and coke every time i go to take a sip .<ssssss>my aversion to rum would keep I from buy this again , but it be by no mean a terrible example of a brown ale .<ssssss>
6 8 6 6 7		best before june 2007 .<ssssss>clear copper ... modest off-white head sit on top .<ssssss>smell be thick , rich caramel & roasted malt .<ssssss>nice authentic german malt flavor , some linger hop bitterness .<ssssss>fairly light body for the style , and the flavor do not stick around more than a few seconds after each sip .<ssssss>certainly a oktoberfest you could drink all day long .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but not very thick and lack the flavor depth that i would like .<ssssss>overall , this be actually better than i expect it to be , but not the best example of the style by any means .<ssssss>
9 8 6 9 7		review come from a 22oz bottle with the usual stone look to it .<ssssss>this pour out a murky golden color with a tall beige head .<ssssss>the head last a good bit and decent size chunk of lace be leave about the glass , as it be consume .<ssssss>very hoppy nose here with citric grapefruit and floral note galore .<ssssss>not much else come through just hop , hop and more hop .<ssssss>the flavor be damn hoppy as well , bitter citric hop mainly dominate with a bit of earthy note as well .<ssssss>this really grab you tongue and doesnt let go very much the palette destroyer that end in a long lasting dry bitter hoppy finish .<ssssss>hmm this be pretty light on the tongue for a double ipa , with a less than medium body to it .<ssssss>drinkability be hurt a little by the lighter body but it be still good .<ssssss>i would definitely have this again , as the flavor definitely pack the hop you be look for in this type of brew .<ssssss>
8 4 2 4 4		what do they do to my guinness .<ssssss>i can not believe that this actually pass under the name of guinness .<ssssss>huge creamy head , jet black body .<ssssss>water roasted malt , dark chocolate-like bitterness .<ssssss>it be like the nitro suck all the flavor from this pathetic swill .<ssssss>nasty foamy weak thin nastiness .<ssssss>i have this a half a dozen time just to make sure that this be not a defect at the particular bar i be at and have to say it be the bigest beer disappointment i can ever remember have .<ssssss>
10 6 10 10 10		this be by far the best beer i have ever have .<ssssss>i still have not be able to find this at many place .<ssssss>anyone who can point I in the right direction would help a lot .<ssssss>i have it last time in las vegas .<ssssss>it look perfect to I , a golden yellow and clear .<ssssss>when i smell it i think it be not go to be a good beer but once in my mouth , whole different story .<ssssss>it be quite sweet and could drink all night which i end up do last time .<ssssss>

10 8 5 8 8		i have also have this beer with many serve type , from nitro tap to can , and besides on tap , i have find the bottle to be most please , but i be bias against drinking beer from can , and this review be of the bottle .<ssssss>a - i have always find guinness to have just a fantastic appearance .<ssssss>s - i have learn to love the smell of guinness , but to a first time drinker i could see it be interpret as odd t - there be nothing like guinness on tap , for a macro brew , i think this beer have a really solid taste .<ssssss>m - a little watery d - this beer probably will not make a beer drinker out of nun , at least not in the bottle , but as far as macro brew go , i think this be a really solid beer that will keep I content any time i drink it<ssssss>

8 8 10 9 8		dancin ' hobo , review # 600 , on tap at the brewery 12/30/08 , new year 's eve eve .<ssssss>serve in a traditional american pint glass .<ssssss>limit 1 , $ 9/per .<ssssss>13 % abv , brew with champagne yeast , age in oak barrel for 18 month , and infuse with fresh raspberry - yike !<ssssss>appearance : a hazy burnt orange beer , deep and vibrant , with a one-finger , dull white head with impressive retention , give the known alcohol-by-volume .<ssssss>lacing be blobby and sticky , also surprising for the same aforementioned reason .<ssssss>carbonation be fine and very , very slow .<ssssss>a solid beginning .<ssssss>aroma : sweet raspberry and vanilla dominate here , with a underlie woody and yeasty earthiness and a handful of hidden roasted malt pick up the slack .<ssssss>not yet blow away , but i like what i be partake in .<ssssss>taste : closer to get blow away .<ssssss>hint of rum soaked fruit , wonderfully-authentic raspberry , the same roasted malt note , and ton of vanilla and oak make up the bulk of this one .<ssssss>it be near ` bout the perfect mix of dry and sweet , and have that crisp , light champagne .<ssssss>the raspberry fade as it warm and be replace by darker , more complex note , a little boozier with a slight prickle - pear and minor , peppery spice .<ssssss>most excellent .<ssssss>mouthfeel : incredibly soft and delicate , with absolutely huge effervescence .<ssssss>it be so very soft though , and the sheer volume of fluff here cut through what would otherwise likely be very syrupy , leave a nice , pleasant , perfectly enjoyable medium body .<ssssss>drinkability : where 's the 13 % ?<ssssss>not here , that be for sure .<ssssss>i have no idea i be so close to # 600 when i go on my north carolina road trip , and i be very glad that i land here when # 600 be upon I .<ssssss>this be one impressive beer , and manage to exhibit characteristic from each of its bullet point - it be light , crisp , and high in alcohol as a result of the champagne yeast , full of wonderful , authentic , sweet raspberry note , and replete with oak , wood , and stray vanillin ester .<ssssss>just a absolute treat , and a true shame that there be a 1 per customer limit .<ssssss>highly recommend .<ssssss>
7 6 5 7 8		this one be a leftover from watch the bc game with my high school friend in january , but still taste pretty good .<ssssss>pour a dark cola brown with brown highlight and a medium-sized brown head .<ssssss>head fade quickly .<ssssss>smell be kind of weak , but there be a faint hint of chocolate and some toast malt in there .<ssssss>flavor be pretty smooth , just a slight roasty maltiness with some chocolate note , a bit of alcohol , but not much in the way of hoppiness .<ssssss>only real complaint be that the mouthfeel be pretty watery ; this one would really benefit from a little kick up .<ssssss>other than that , extremely drinkable , and not a bad cheap choice to kick back with some friend who need a good crossover beer .<ssssss>they will be confuse ; it look dark , but it be so mild !<ssssss>
8 6 7 4 6		slight chill haze , light golden color .<ssssss>tight white lace coat the glass nicely .<ssssss>the head be small but last .<ssssss>grainy aroma with nearly no hop present .<ssssss>the flavor be similar to a traditional macro : grainy with no hop flavor .<ssssss>it be crisp with a decent body for the style .<ssssss>no aftertaste .<ssssss>this be easy to drink but ultimately uninteresting .<ssssss>
7 8 5 5 4		pour a very hazy golden orange , with a big beige head that retain well for a high abv brew .<ssssss>the aroma be intriguing , as it have a huge fresh wheat character initially , along with some cheerio like maltiness , some fruity ester , and a touch of the banana/clove yeastiness typical of the style .<ssssss>the flavor start out like the aroma , with a massive fresh wheat character , follow by some fruity ester , a strange cheerio like maltiness , along with some herbal and grassy hop , and a brash ethanol presence .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be actually a bit thick for my liking , likely due to the large proportion of wheat in the grist bill .<ssssss>drinkability be pretty good consider the abv , but this be no easy drinking hefe .<ssssss>overall a descent beer , perhaps a bit one dimensional , since the overwhelming flavor and aroma be wheat base .<ssssss>also im not sure how well a hefe can be ramp up or imperialize .<ssssss>
6 6 6 4 5		tasting with agentzero .<ssssss>12oz bottle into my rochefort glass .<ssssss>pour dark brown with almost no carbonation on the pour or when swirl ... the aroma be very strong dark fruit , grain alcohol , wood .<ssssss>a little to strong of alcohol , not super , do not make you want to taste it ... the taste be not good , super strong of wood , bitter alcohol , maybe licorice .<ssssss>the feel be super light , not very drinkable at all .<ssssss>overall , this be not a good beer , not one to search out .<ssssss>
5 5 6 4 7		pour a pale yellow color that produce a white lacing .<ssssss>aroma be faint grain and a tad bit of the hop come through as well .<ssssss>mouthfeel be crisp and light with a heavy dose of carbonation .<ssssss>not much go on in the taste .<ssssss>clean , crisp and refreshing yes !<ssssss>but as far as taste go , it be really bland .<ssssss>the only way i will get this again be if i be in a chinese restaraunt and it be the only thing offer .<ssssss>
10 9 5 4 7		unibroue be always good with presentation , and trois pistole be no exception , with its wicked label and print foil on the cap .<ssssss>i have never bother to try this one before , but it sound entice .<ssssss>the label claim that it be a `` remarkably mellow dark ale with the aroma of ripe fruit and a pleasant aftertaste that linger like port wine . ''<ssssss>a : the bottle perfectly fill my snifter to the rim upon pour .<ssssss>tp be a rich , espresso brown that let just a glimmer of light through around the murky edge .<ssssss>a tan three-finger , frothy head sit atop .<ssssss>this brew look great .<ssssss>it leave a little lacing as the head fall to a mousse-like cream .<ssssss>s : trois pistole ' aroma be delicious .<ssssss>the label do not lie : blend with the spicy clove smell from the belgian yeast be note of raspberry , plum , orange , and banana .<ssssss>a delicate belgian pil malt provide the backing for the fruit and spice , and a hint of chocolate malt linger in the background .<ssssss>t : slightly sweet malt be quickly lose to flavor of pepper .<ssssss>no one spice stand out , but rather , a muddle , musty spice be all that be detectable .<ssssss>the three gun be sweet at first , but a dry and slightly sour finish follow .<ssssss>overall , the flavor be surprisingly light , with a little caramel , pepper , some fig , and a touch of green apple .<ssssss>the flavor give way to a subtle , warm alcoholic heat .<ssssss>i must admit , the flavor fall well short of the aroma and appearance .<ssssss>m : high carbonation cause burpage and make the eye water .<ssssss>d : medium .<ssssss>nothing exceptional , but very drinkable .<ssssss>the bark be definitely bigger than the bite , as the flavor and mouthfeel miss they mark .<ssssss>
9 6 7 8 8		pour a beautiful golden color with a nice foamy white head .<ssssss>excellent lacing .<ssssss>mild malt aroma , rather clean .<ssssss>mild malt taste , slight hop and a rather clean dry finish that i find quite pleasant .<ssssss>smooth , well carbonated and somewhat meaty in the mouth which i find surprising consider the style .<ssssss>very easy to drink and very easy to put a few back .<ssssss>be rather nice on tap .<ssssss>much enjoy .<ssssss>
8 9 8 10 7		be so long since i have open one of these .<ssssss>4pm on a tuesday afternoon ?<ssssss>why not ?<ssssss>2008 bottle pour into a bruery tulip .<ssssss>the pour be a deep , dark brown - not quite black , but pretty close .<ssssss>a small tan head form , recede to a collar almost instantly .<ssssss>this beer pour as thick as any beer i can think of .<ssssss>the pour be almost whisper quiet , indicate ridiculous viscosity .<ssssss>like a glass of use motor oil .<ssssss>smell be fantastic .<ssssss>leather , tobacco , and a oak and smoke background .<ssssss>a little boozy , but not to the degree that the abv would indicate .<ssssss>bourbon , oak , vanilla .<ssssss>very complex , very invite .<ssssss>the taste be divine .<ssssss>the tobacco lead , with leather not far behind .<ssssss>the bourbon be noticeable , but contribute more in flavor than it do in booziness .<ssssss>this beer have do well over the last couple year of aging ... i be glad i have more .<ssssss>espresso , molasses and brown sugar round the taste out .<ssssss>this be slightly sweet , but not nearly as much as other imperial stout .<ssssss>mouthfeel be great .<ssssss>thick , oily , sticky .<ssssss>this beer , despite be massive in flavor and in alcohol content , be still very drinkable -lrb- all thing consider -rrb- .<ssssss>it be a sip beer to be sure , but damn , i would not mind have a couple of these in a night .<ssssss>excellent beer .<ssssss>highly , highly recommend .<ssssss>*** edit : as the beer warm further towards room temperature , some booze and a bit of unwanted astringency manifest itself .<ssssss>take off 0.5 for both mouthfeel and drinkability .<ssssss>still highly recommend .<ssssss>***<ssssss>
7 8 8 6 4		a - pour a mahogany color , fading to deep gold around the edge ... great range of color .<ssssss>one finger head quickly dissipate , and leave nothing behind .<ssssss>s - complex burnt sugar , resinous hop , a touch of leather , and a fair amount of alcohol/hooch .<ssssss>f - big flavor , but lack .<ssssss>lot of unfermented sugar here , with caramel hint .<ssssss>solid hop bitterness , with only a touch of piney flavor .<ssssss>sweetness be overwhelming on the finish .<ssssss>unfortunately the alcohol be quite hot and forward .<ssssss>m - thick and lucious , creamy and smooth .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>d - a bit low due to the alcohol presence .<ssssss>overall , i be pretty disappoint in this one .<ssssss>usually southern tier have some phenomenal beer , but this one just do not stand up to the rest of they lineup .<ssssss>it be worth a try for the price , but i will not be rush back .<ssssss>
8 2 8 4 4		get this at bert 's bierhuis in utrecht .<ssssss>from a bottle into a snifter .<ssssss>appearance : pour a one finger medium look off-white head with good retention .<ssssss>no carbonation evident .<ssssss>pour clear and a nice venetian red in color .<ssssss>head fade to s wisp and a thick ring .<ssssss>splotchy lacing remain until the end leave some splotchy lace down the glass .<ssssss>smell : a very odd nose .<ssssss>nothing ipa about it .<ssssss>to be honest , all i can think about when i take a whiff be stinky foot .<ssssss>not appeal ; at least not in a ipa way .<ssssss>taste : : again , some stinky foot up front .<ssssss>i do not know what go wrong here .<ssssss>stinky foot be follow up by a bit of red fruit and some hop bitterness on the finish .<ssssss>a bolder and longer lasting aftertaste be plenty bitter , which be the only thing that save this from the abyss .<ssssss>palate : medium body and medium carbonation .<ssssss>semi-creamy on the palate , go down smooth and finish slightly mouth-coating .<ssssss>not bad here .<ssssss>overall : the look and feel on this one be spot on , but everything else be all wrong .<ssssss>i do not think the bottle be off , but whatever mikkeller be try to do with this one do not work at all .<ssssss>it be not quite awful , but it certainly be not anything like a american ipa .<ssssss>disappointing , as mikkeller make some great stuff .<ssssss>if you be look for a good example of the style , avoid this one at all cost .<ssssss>i be quite surprised it be rate as highly as it be .<ssssss>
4 5 8 7 6		a - clean and clear , filter well as with all saranac , little head s - my nose be shoot currently , a bit spicy but nothing else t - good malty flavor , a bit spicy british style hop , a water down british india ale but a bit darker and maltier though this add nothing significant to the flavor , just note a slight difference in flavor from british style i have have m - decent , a palatable style and not far off here d - ok , like the spiciness but there be no hook , kind of bland all in all synopsis : a bland imitation of the real thing , par for the course for saranac , as far as saranac go i would stick to the vanilla stout , try a samuel smith 's india ale -lrb- which get 's mediocre review -rrb- and you will forget about this weakling in no time<ssssss>
8 7 7 9 8		golden / orange in color with a large frothy white head .<ssssss>the aroma be of citrusy and piney hop .<ssssss>its flavor live up to its name , another hop monster .<ssssss>though , i must add that there be a definite malt character in the mix as well .<ssssss>pine and grapefruit add to the bitterness that be dominant in this brew .<ssssss>mouth feel be on the light side of medium body and be generously carbonate .<ssssss>
5 4 6 2 4		330ml 5.1 % abv appearance : light golden , reasonable head that disappear a few seconds after pour , leave no lace .<ssssss>smell : light maize with a tiny hint of hop .<ssssss>taste : taste like flour dissolve in water , with a metallic after taste .<ssssss>one of the worst of the macro-larger i have have .<ssssss>mouth feel : light with good carbonation .<ssssss>drinkability : if it be not for the taste , the light nature of the beer would make it reasonably drinkable on a very hot day .<ssssss>
8 7 10 8 8		straight pour from a pry-off 12oz bottle to large wine glass , package date 03/25/11best by date 03/2012 appearance -lrb- 4.0 -rrb- : glowing , hazy golden body with a dense , 2 finger , bone white head slowly fading to a finger head .<ssssss>good , moderate lacing .<ssssss>smell -lrb- 3.5 -rrb- : light , bready , crisp malt scent with a characteristic ommegang yeast noteslightly fruity , slightly floral , and biscuity .<ssssss>taste -lrb- 4.0 -rrb- : crisp , bready malt with grassy hop follow right behind .<ssssss>hop profile stick around , move from grassy to a very light citrus flavor back by that crisp , biscuity malt base .<ssssss>the hop open up a bit as it go on , range from grassy to lemony , until that end of the hop profile sit on top of the crisp biscuity malt body .<ssssss>very tasty , very light and very drinkable , actually .<ssssss>mouthfeel -lrb- 5.0 -rrb- : smooth , very fine carbonation that stick around , light and velvety but not thick at all .<ssssss>really excellent feel in the mouth .<ssssss>overall -lrb- 4.0 -rrb- : not many of ommegang beer be as light and quaffable as this be , they tend to be better for savor and sip .<ssssss>this be a very nice , approachable belgian pale , and a good introduction to the style .<ssssss>update -lrb- 9/5/11 -rrb- : have this super-fresh at the brewery recently , and i have to say that when the hop be freshest , they have a very bright , bitter presence that really turn it into a somewhat different beer ; it be good to very good if the hop have fade a bit , but very good to excellent when they be bright and fresh !<ssssss>

8 5 7 7 9		have this on tap at wink lizard , serve in a signature dfh punkin ' ale glass .<ssssss>i have hear a lot about this beer , and be eagerly await its arrival this year to try for the first time , but unfortunately due to the ever early release of seasonal beer these day i have try numerous other pumpkin beer before this one .<ssssss>i guess i somehow expect this to be much better than most , which it may be - except in flavor .<ssssss>nice orange/amber color .<ssssss>fairly clear and well carbonated .<ssssss>i do not get much aroma out of this beer despite try pretty hard .<ssssss>a little bit of cinnamon and mild hop but that be about it for I .<ssssss>the flavor be very well balanced , but not very unique either .<ssssss>lot of the usual spice suspect : cinnamon , nutmeg , maybe some clove .<ssssss>lightly bready malt and very mild earthy hop .<ssssss>i get some of the flavor of pumpkin pie i guess , but not really any real pumpkin flavor .<ssssss>ultimately this be a easy drinker , and it be very well balanced - most pumpkin ale be such unbalanced cinnamon bomb that more than one glass can be a chore .<ssssss>i could easily session this all night , but at the go rate : $ 11/4-pack , i would rather drink several other more flavorful pumpkin beer -lrb- or something better from dfh - burton baton have start show up -rrb- .<ssssss>

8 9 6 7 9		amber in color , thick , creamy head , medium-high carbonation .<ssssss>sweet hop aroma , could be dry hop , maybe a little peppery .<ssssss>taste be kind of plain , no malt , ton of bitter , linger bitter after taste .<ssssss>i love ipa , but this seem to have no balance , and nothing special , maybe even a bit watery .<ssssss>little bit of alcohol taste too .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit papery , slightly oily .<ssssss>the wateryness make it pretty drinkable though , `` taste meh !<ssssss>less fill ! ''<ssssss>i like sierra nevada just as much as the next guy , and i have hear nothing but good for torpedo .<ssssss>as a ipa i guess this be pretty good by-the-book , but to I , it be pretty forgettable .<ssssss>i will definitely finish it tho .<ssssss>

6 8 6 6 7		head .<ssssss>as in this one have a huge head .<ssssss>smell hugely of apricot and peach , but i find that comforting and pleasant aroma wise and not at all gimmicky .<ssssss>very enjoyable aroma .<ssssss>sooo the flavor be less please .<ssssss>apricot puree fruit mash melange and some mild watery wheat ale .<ssssss>this could have be a better realize brew if they would have make a sturdier wheat beer to carry the apricot/peach flavor .<ssssss>as it be the flavor be all apricot and water with a tinge of wheat .<ssssss>
8 8 9 7 6		2007 bottle , many thanks to lothore for the chance to try it .<ssssss>pour into a russian river pint glass ... again thanks to lothore !<ssssss>: -rrb- a - tan 1 finger head , dark red/amber ... beautiful color .<ssssss>s - piney hop , caramel malt , slight alcohol twinge .<ssssss>really smell tasty .<ssssss>t - surprisingly malty .<ssssss>i can see where they be go with this .<ssssss>perhaps a brand new bottled sample , or a draft offering would have yield a stronger hop profile .<ssssss>nice toasty malt and warm alcohol .<ssssss>not remarkable , but nothing offensive .<ssssss>it be more of a big malty monster .<ssssss>m - pretty much perfect mouthfeel , good thickness , carbonation be on point .<ssssss>d - it be abv be up there , but the taste be pretty well round , though i can not imagine drink more than three in a sit .<ssssss>
8 9 7 6 7		pour a pale straw gold yellow with big white head .<ssssss>good retention and lacing .<ssssss>aroma be potent with sweet citrus fruit -- smell like a hop bomb .<ssssss>grapefruit , orange peel , lemon ... this be the way i like my dipa to smell .<ssssss>pale malt be big in the taste , biscuity with a bit of earthiness to it .<ssssss>bitterness be mild , hop be leafy -- where do the citrus go ?<ssssss>something in the taste just be not my thing -- i think it be the weedy , earthy note .<ssssss>bad bottle ?<ssssss>for the record , it do get better as it go along .<ssssss>light body , but smooth .<ssssss>less carbonation than i expect after the large head it have .<ssssss>decently drinkable , but the whatever it be in the flavor be a bit off-putting .<ssssss>glad to try it , i be usually a pretty big st fan , but this one miss in my book .<ssssss>i will have to grab another just to make sure .<ssssss>
8 9 6 7 7		bottle .<ssssss>red brown color with a offwhite ivory head .<ssssss>head slowly subside to a nice collar around the glass .<ssssss>aroma be of sour fruit note , cherry with a slight acidic bite .<ssssss>the taste be actually not as sweet as i expect but still quite nice .<ssssss>more tart than sour .<ssssss>slightly `` watery '' in that i think the mouthfeel should be slightly heavier .<ssssss>overall , a good beer that i think will get better with age .<ssssss>
8 6 5 7 7		purchase at the tesco supermarket .<ssssss>it be a bottle-conditioned beer , with a blue ribbon around the bottle neck say `` tesco brewing award best beer winner '' ... the back label specify that `` blue be the first bottle condition ale brew deliberately to taste great chill '' , plus a huge sign of snow flake and a sentence in block capital as the second reminder : `` for drinking cold '' ... perhaps yet another attempt to win over lager drinker ?<ssssss>try too hard , i think , and i do not like the idea of cold ale anyway .<ssssss>bb 15/07/07 , serve just sli ... ghtly cooler than cool in a straight imperial-pint glass .<ssssss>a : pour a reddish orangey hue , slightly murky due to yeast sediment ; the off-white come quite puffy but sustain surprisingly well , against a moderately-carbonated body , full of tiny bubble -- look rather healthy .<ssssss>s : tart , damp , pear-ish and slightly pineapple-ish yeasty note upfront , common to quite a few british microbrewery ' bottle-conditioned beer ... also at presence be the sour-sweet orangey edge of english hop and a bed of mildly sweet pale malt .<ssssss>a good swirl help reveal deeper , flowery and piney aroma of hop , but not linger and hide underneath the overall sour note .<ssssss>not too bad overall , but the sour yeastiness be slightly overpower .<ssssss>t : a assertively effervescent texture full of sharp , tiny fizz attack my tastebud ... almost like a overly fizzy lager !<ssssss>struggle over the fizziness , my palate pick up some sour citric flavour on top of neutral pale malt , which quickly give way to grapefruit-peel 's zesty as well as yeasty bitterness , and a rather rusty/tannic , almost piney touch of hop manifest at the rear of the palate ... the good linger tangy bitterness and increasingly dry palate lend some pleasant length -- perhaps the most enjoyable part of the beer .<ssssss>m & d : the mouthfeel be way too fizzy for a ale , more in line with wild biere de garde for that matter ... it take a good while for the texture to soften before one 's palate could better appreciate the flavour .<ssssss>apart from that , this be a distinctively bitter premium -lrb- pale -rrb- bitter with a a rather crisp and dry palate due to rich content of hop .<ssssss>quaffable alright , but hardly a impressive bitter in my book .<ssssss>and i truly wonder why it should be consume cold as recommend on the bottle ?<ssssss>in that case even the zesty hop could be kill off altogether , leave nothing to taste but bitterness and fizz !<ssssss>!<ssssss>
8 7 6 9 8		buy this beer at a shop in meer , belgium .<ssssss>i usually seek out the triple beer there for christmas .<ssssss>this be a unknown beer for I when i see the bottle the first time .<ssssss>the bottle be the same as the duvel bottle .<ssssss>i pour it like all triple i drink in the westmalle chalice i have .<ssssss>have the beer in my cellar for more than two month to let it come to rest .<ssssss>the tase be very good and soft .<ssssss>teh beer feel almost natural .<ssssss>good carbonation and nice white head .<ssssss>i be so impressed that i have this one a few time more .<ssssss>when you see it ?<ssssss>buy it !<ssssss>

7 8 6 9 6		this beer pour a copper color with a two-finger head that do not last long .<ssssss>the smell be a mix of some sweet bready smell with a big punch of hop .<ssssss>this beer definitely have a lot of flavor , sweet toffee malt that give way to some citrusy and slightly piney hop .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be slightly thick with some moderate carbonation .<ssssss>this beer be definitely tasty , but the hop hit a little hard and hurt the drinkability a bit .<ssssss>

10 8 9 10 8		this be a beer you just have to get on-tap .<ssssss>though the can be better than the bottle , neither can compare to a ice cold pint from the bar .<ssssss>a : one of the best part of guinness , if you bartender pour it right , you will see the head form from the light brown bubble rise up , and the beer will slowly reach its final color , a deep cloudy brown -lrb- almost opaque -rrb- with a nearly white head .<ssssss>s : it have a very nice smell , but nothing too impressive .<ssssss>smell like any other stout , can begin to smell hint of the hop but it be hard to put my finger on what else .<ssssss>t : have a very smooth taste , definitely have a strong taste , but be surprisingly drinkable .<ssssss>you can begin to taste hint of coffee which be very nice , drink all the foam too !<ssssss>m : it be very smooth and soft , but at time i find myself wish it be more creamy .<ssssss>i find that it depend on where you get the beer though as to how creamy it will be .<ssssss>d : though this beer be a excellent choice , it be not a session beer .<ssssss>it go down smooth and 2 or 3 be fine , but i would not suggest have to many more as they be so fill , and mean to be enjoy .<ssssss>

8 10 7 8 8		a-orange/amber ... leave a nice lace on glass as i drink s-great aroma ... ton of toast malt ... also some candy toffee ... i guess that be what toffee be : -rrb- ... some caramel note too ... very sweet aroma and a fresh hoppiness complement perfectly ... great smell beer .<ssssss>t-where the nose be malt forward , the taste be more balanced ... some good hop to this ... a citrus like grapefruit rind bitterness be evident .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but it mingle nicely with the great malt backbone .<ssssss>.<ssssss>m-medium body ... .<ssssss>seem sessionable but still load with flavor .<ssssss>d-i really like this ... top notch beer ... .<ssssss>do not really fit a style ... .<ssssss>a cross between a esb and red ale in my opinion .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i definitely would buy again ... right up there with ringneck as my favorite from this brewery ... .<ssssss>no off note at all ... .<ssssss>
6 7 8 5 5		pour a pale , hazy copper/amber hue with off white head .<ssssss>note of pine and citrus , pretty clean in it be delivery .<ssssss>the first sip deliver some hint of malt that be immediately shove aside by the hop .<ssssss>bitter , but not over the top .<ssssss>note of grapefruit and earthy pine .<ssssss>some smooth , creamy texture ease up the hop flavor .<ssssss>pretty empty in the malt flavor department .<ssssss>the hop flavor be nice , but i want a little more complexity .<ssssss>just a hint more of malt and maybe a little more diversity from the hop .<ssssss>a lot good thing happen in this beer , but not enough to get I to drink it again .<ssssss>potentially a good intro to people want to try hoppy beer , maybe .<ssssss>
8 9 6 8 9		pour a clear mahogany with a short cream color head .<ssssss>fruity aroma of apple and oak .<ssssss>bread , raisin and carmel with full bitterness , and some alcohol warmth .<ssssss>mild carbonation and medium body that seem to fill out as it warm .<ssssss>this be a beer brew to last , yet be quite drinkable right now .<ssssss>the mouthfeel improve as it warm .<ssssss>i would like to cellar a couple bottle of this and see how it mature .<ssssss>
7 4 7 4 4		i be very highly disappoint with this beer .<ssssss>there be not really anything good that i can say about it .<ssssss>it pour to a clear strawberry blonde color with very little head that fade to absolutely nothing .<ssssss>the smell and taste be horrid , like drinking vinegar straight .<ssssss>i end up pour this out less than half way through .<ssssss>i never think i would see the day where i be not even able to finish a beer .<ssssss>as bad as they be , i have always be able to finish a cheap macro lager , but not this , which be unfortunately rather costly as it be a belgian import .<ssssss>i would definitely not recommend it .<ssssss>

8 7 5 4 5		deep , limpid black with the slightest auburn glow at the edge .<ssssss>craggy , pock-marked tan head sport both reasonable retention and leave a reasonable smattering of lace in its wake .<ssssss>nice aroma : pumpernickel , cocoa and bitter baking chocolate , burnt brown sugar , even some macerated black cherry .<ssssss>a salty , soy sauce aroma lurk in the background .<ssssss>salty , soy character re-emerge in the flavour .<ssssss>rye bread , toast , brown sugar , cocoa be present -- but only barely , on the whole it be rather thin and watery .<ssssss>oily , thin mouthfeel .<ssssss>aggressive carbonation cut apart watery body , leave it feel flimsy and with little form .<ssssss>unfortunately thin .<ssssss>some good point , such as the tasty aroma , but ultimately this stout be too light-bodied , thin flavoured and unbalanced to merit repeat serving .<ssssss>
8 8 3 9 7		first of all , i have to mention the price - the most expensive price i have see for this beer around here be $ 3.49 .<ssssss>thank you lagunita for you consistently affordable price-point .<ssssss>now , for the beer : it look really light , light clear golden in color with a fluffy head that soon melt to a ring that lace the glass till the end .<ssssss>smell be mostly hop .<ssssss>sweet light malt and pungent citrusy hop smell ; grapefruit , orange peel , slight herbaceousness with a tinge of alcohol .<ssssss>really light body as expect .<ssssss>sweet biscuity malt burst with fruit flavor ; peach , apricot , apple , grapefruit .<ssssss>hop bite come on strong in the finish to make it perfectly dry and crisp .<ssssss>mouthfeel be where this beer lack for sure .<ssssss>i love light malt dipa , but this one feel pretty watery .<ssssss>while its light enough to have a high drinkability , the uneven mouthfeel definately make it uninteresting upon further inspection .<ssssss>

7 8 9 7 8		taste 8/9/2011 a : pour black , light tan head that stick around for a while , fading to a foamy slick on the surface .<ssssss>s : intense espresso roast , char dark chocolate , smoky brine , and finish of dark fruit .<ssssss>t : dark roasted malt , not as much coffee as in the nose , and smoky whiskey .<ssssss>some strange herbal quality to the coffee character .<ssssss>low bitter finish , heat on the breath .<ssssss>m : true to the other brew in this series , this go down smooth and creamy .<ssssss>o : respectable on its own , but this be my least favorite in the series - not quite as balanced , something a bit awkward in the flavor profile .<ssssss>

6 4 4 6 2		my first introduction to this beer be as i arrive into nz .<ssssss>in response to the advertising `` world best lager '' i go on to purchase a six pack , a antidote to a 24 hour flight from uk .<ssssss>i recently try it again and my initial conclusion have not be alter .<ssssss>to put thing into perspective i have make a point of drinking non-production brew for several year now .<ssssss>like most people , i do not get headache from beer that be brew use traditional technique .<ssssss>i also get the small vagary of a give brew to look forward to , rather than a bland inoffensive drink that be engineer by a chemist to taste just like that last one .<ssssss>on pour , steinlager have a average feel in every respect .<ssssss>it be a brew design to not offend or startle either .<ssssss>so the overall sensation be ho-hum .<ssssss>however , i have to report it be a headache in a can : that be , as soon as i drink the first mouthful of beer i can feel a pain start at the front of my head .<ssssss>steinlager be outstanding in that this result be immediate .<ssssss>after 20 year of appreciation of the amber nectar i have never have such a extreme effect .<ssssss>as such it be very disappointing and i will not be go there again .<ssssss>it be not the `` world best lager '' , far from it .<ssssss>of my original six pack i the nzbeermonster leave the other 5 in the fridge of my hotel for the next person to drink , the effect be that strong .<ssssss>i have never resort to this with beer before .<ssssss>i try the beer again after live here for 8 year just in case it be a bad brew i have partake of -lrb- plus there be no alternative on offer -rrb- .<ssssss>in this instance i try the on-tap variant .<ssssss>i can report no improvement on the quality of the result .<ssssss>to my shame i switch to diet coke .<ssssss>since those early day i have discover that steinlager be a poor representative of the breadth of beer available in nz .<ssssss>
7 4 6 3 4		a orangey with a thick head that dissipate almost completely .<ssssss>not even a little but of lacing , none at all .<ssssss>a bit hazy s sweet like a cheap wine .<ssssss>no hop at all t : as per the nose , sweet like cheap wine honestly i wonder if this go bad on I .<ssssss>m failty full body .<ssssss>medium cargonation .<ssssss>siginificant alcoho lbite .<ssssss>d very poor indeed .<ssssss>i could not finish this and that be in spite of the fact that i have no other cold beer to tun to .<ssssss>
8 6 6 9 7		purchase from city beer store in san francisco .<ssssss>a -- the beer pour a pitch black .<ssssss>very nice lacing , but minimal head .<ssssss>it look fairly standard for the style .<ssssss>s -- i be not get much aroma aside from what i take to be chocolate malt .<ssssss>i get a slight undertone of vanilla and caramel , but complexity just be not there .<ssssss>t -- i hate to say `` beer x taste very much like beer y , '' but to I , this taste very much like north coast old rasputin .<ssssss>this certainly be not a bad thing , as i think that beer be fantastic , but it do not strike I as be unique .<ssssss>that say , i love the taste so i would be a fool to knock the taste .<ssssss>again , vanilla and caramel , but far from complex .<ssssss>m -- the beer be thin bodied , a bit of a far cry from the trend in american imperial stout brewer .<ssssss>i would compare the body to alaskan smoked porter .<ssssss>i be not really sure i enjoy a stout this thin .<ssssss>d -- very drinkable , but again , expectation come to play .<ssssss>if you make a very limited release , you set high standard .<ssssss>i would certainly say that the beer be overhype .<ssssss>i do not think this be a bad thing , as it have certainly open I up to other offering from deschute .<ssssss>if you find this at you local beer store , you owe it to yourself to try it .<ssssss>otherwise , i would go with obsidian stout , which in my opinion be a better offering from the brewery .<ssssss>
10 4 10 7 8		a - pour freely from the can into my la trappe goblet , the beer fill up the containment with a warm , round red-orange hue .<ssssss>it almost look like honey or syrup .<ssssss>the clarity be nice and the head retention very respectable , give the abv .<ssssss>seriously , this the picture-perfect beer , let along ipa .<ssssss>s - very disappointing .<ssssss>i suspect the can be older .<ssssss>i buy this at joe canal 's on they loosey shelf .<ssssss>obviously , this be mean to move , and be produce in a can , freshness be never the chief intent of the brewery .<ssssss>for that reason , i do not expect much , but i do want more .<ssssss>on the other hand , the `` onion '' and `` garlic '' everyone forewarn of be not at all apparent .<ssssss>in fact , it have a classic hop scent i recall from my first foray into craft ale .<ssssss>truly , this beer smell of hop .<ssssss>it be not grapefruit or pine or earth , it be just raw hop .<ssssss>as a homebrewer , i know this as the scent of hop before the boil .<ssssss>i find it very , very pleasant .<ssssss>too bad there be not more , and it be limit to that aroma only .<ssssss>t - it drink more like a pale ale than a ipa , of course the body be very robust and oily .<ssssss>you can taste the hop oils and juice along with the chewy malt .<ssssss>it be like a bock without the flavor .<ssssss>the hop help thing along , but not in the way 100 ibus would suggest .<ssssss>it be dangerously drinkable , but i will not call it memorable .<ssssss>to this beer 's credit , and perhaps due to the age , the heat be completely lose on I .<ssssss>i have be enjoy beer to much lately , but i still think i would pick-up on the 10 % abv .<ssssss>do not happen .<ssssss>this beer will not make you grab you crotch .<ssssss>m - a little creamy and sticky , but finish dry enough .<ssssss>i be able to drink this much easier than most beer of this strength .<ssssss>for one , it do not use crystal malt and secondly it do not use syrup .<ssssss>crystal malt add excessive sweetness , and syrup add a champagne-like fizz that become burdensome .<ssssss>o - it may not what you dream of in a imperial ipa .<ssssss>still , it be strikingly drinkable .<ssssss>think of it like a imperial pale ale , rather than a bigger , badder ipa .<ssssss>the bitterness be present , but unoffensive .<ssssss>however the flavor and aroma be present , but uninspire .<ssssss>
6 5 7 8 8		pour a golden honey color with a small head and light lace .<ssssss>the aroma be mild skunk , bread malt and hop .<ssssss>the taste be toast malt , hop , and a slightly bitter .<ssssss>the overall feel be slightly watery , crisp , dry finish with mild bitterness .<ssssss>i think i detect some grain in the finish .<ssssss>note : the beer be slightly skunk , but they all be .<ssssss>i buy a 6 pack and i feel that despite this the beer be good , not great but good .<ssssss>i suppose i try it because i read so much about it .<ssssss>it be fine for a hot day , average and nothing to be ashamed of .<ssssss>
8 4 6 6 6		pour a slightly hazy light orange color with a creamy 1 finger tan head that fade slowly , leave a creamy layer on top and very good foamy lace with ring as it go down .<ssssss>smell of sweet malt , caramel , light citrus hop , biscuit and light grain ; i really have to inhale deeply to get that much out of this weak aroma , which be odd for a ipa .<ssssss>the smell be almost non-existent , which for a american ipa be bizarre and even for a english ipa would be strange .<ssssss>a big let down in the aroma department .<ssssss>taste of sweet malt , caramel , piney hop , light citrus hop , a hint of bitter grapefruit , lemon zest , grain , faint pepper and herb like tea leaf ; a pretty dull ipa that be not well balanced and lack any real hop kick .<ssssss>this beer be grainy and have more herb than hop flavor , with a metallic almost funky taste in the dry finish .<ssssss>this could be a decent pale ale , but this be not what a west coast ipa should be and to I be mis-classified .<ssssss>mouthfeel be light and creamy with a medium body , very light carbonation and a light slightly bitter finish that be almost chalky .<ssssss>moderate drinkable , this be a decent bland beer and not the ipa i hope it would be when i buy this bomber .<ssssss>overall it be major letdown , and while it may be a decent beer i dont think id seek it out again .<ssssss>
8 9 9 7 7		i have have a lot of this lately , so it be time to review it .<ssssss>i will be honest - for a long time i really do not like this beer , but i think i be still expect something different .<ssssss>pour a medium dark walnut brown color with lot of red highlight .<ssssss>the head actually have a red or pink tone to it as well .<ssssss>since this be from a growler , i have play around a little with do a aggressive vs. careful pour and find that carbonation 's normal to heavy with a lot of lacing as you work you way in .<ssssss>the smell remind I of toast with raspberry jam .<ssssss>raspberry 's the prominent flavor , but you can get a little bit of a burnt caramel and nutty flavor , too .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>the taste actually begin with the caramel , nutty , chocolate flavor of a brown ale , but then the raspberry take over in the middle .<ssssss>it be sweet , but not insanely so .<ssssss>the finish be bready and fruity .<ssssss>texture be thinner than you might initially think , but it go down way too easy .<ssssss>on the other hand , it be well carbonated and it lace like few of its kind can .<ssssss>i really have grow to like this beer .<ssssss>it be not something for every day , but on a cold snowy weekend i nearly finish a growler by myself .<ssssss>
7 3 6 5 5		this beer smell awful !<ssssss>it remind I of the so-called `` macro swill '' that everyone drink .<ssssss>luckily it taste better than it smell , but it still do not taste great .<ssssss>i taste some hop towards the end of this one , but i can not place most of the other taste .<ssssss>overall , it remind I more of the `` tan '' than the `` black '' in black and tan .<ssssss>i need to learn to stick to actual black and tan instead of try to simulate it with this type of mixture beer .<ssssss>admit it -- you buy it for the bottle !<ssssss>i know i do .<ssssss>
6 8 5 5 5		this pour a clear bright golden colour with a tiny head that drop quickly and leave little cover .<ssssss>all i get on the nose straight up be predictable macro metallic note but as it warm up a bit some nicer hop note do come through .<ssssss>actually quite pleasant after a while .<ssssss>and there be that predictable bready grainy macro taste on the palate .<ssssss>the hop can not save it unfortunately .<ssssss>blergh .<ssssss>sweet mouthfeel .<ssssss>another bland japanese lager .<ssssss>
8 9 8 10 8		it appear translucent and golden with a large but thin white head .<ssssss>it smell very fruity .<ssssss>there be almost a fruit loop type of a smell to the beer .<ssssss>i get a mellow lemon smell as well .<ssssss>there be a bit of a earthy yeast smell as well as a bit of a sugary smell .<ssssss>it taste initially of lemon , grape and other sweet fruit .<ssssss>there be a great complex flavor of fruit i even get a bit of a apricot and pineapple flavor to the beer .<ssssss>there be a mild sugar taste .<ssssss>i get a mild peppery yeasty flavor .<ssssss>there be a earthy almost wine like presence to the beer .<ssssss>though the beer be a bit sweet it have a great balance to it .<ssssss>there be a thick and smooth mouthfeel with ample carbonation .<ssssss>the drinkability for how high it be in alcohol be outstanding the beer go down smoothly .<ssssss>overall a great complex belgian strong ale .<ssssss>this one of the best example of the style that i have have .<ssssss>
7 8 5 7 6		pour a bright golden yellow with a thick and creamy long lasting head with a touch of lacing , ton of suspend sediment throughout , almost look chewy .<ssssss>the smell be dominate by the spicy belgian yeast and a light lemony hop presence .<ssssss>some nice hint of clove and tropical fruit .<ssssss>the flavor be very sweet and fruity with a very long spicy finish with a pretty potent medicinal hop finish .<ssssss>some nice tangerine , clove , and light peppery note .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be where this beer do not quite work for I , its a bit to thick with a lot residual sugar for a saison , it do not have the overly crisp and dry finish that be the staple of the style .<ssssss>while i think it be not quite dry enough , still overall a fairly nice farmhouse , the flavor be spot on and have a pretty solid nose .<ssssss>
5 6 5 5 8		this have neither the color nor the aroma of a oktoberfest .<ssssss>instead , it be pale gold with a thin white layer of foam , and a light grassy pilsner smell .<ssssss>taste : still a spot-on pilsner .<ssssss>crisp , lightly sweet malt flavor tinge by honey mingle with grassy hop .<ssssss>somehow i doubt that `` the world 's oldest brewery '' shot for a oktoberfest and squeeze out a pilsner , so if this be reclassify i will raise its score accordingly .<ssssss>good beer , could certainly be enjoy at a fest in october , february , or july , but the style be wrong .<ssssss>

8 7 7 2 2		my experience with gruit have be fairly limited , but i have enjoy the one i have come across , and the idea of use alternative to hop be one that intrigue I .<ssssss>great lake have only recently get into cask brewing , and make more experimental beer in general .<ssssss>produce a cask of a hop-free beer be certainly adventurous , and i applaud they for they ambition , but i feel that this one be perhaps a little to ambitious for they current capability .<ssssss>disregard the flavour for now , this beer perform well in all other sensory category .<ssssss>the pour be dark brown , verge on black , with a wispy white head that last the duration .<ssssss>the aroma have some strong pine note -lrb- i understand spruce be use in the brew -rrb- , and a strong underlying fruitiness that remind I of heather ale ebulum gruit , which be make with elderberry .<ssssss>the body be also where it should be - medium-light with a restrained cask carbonation .<ssssss>while none of this particularly wow I , its difficult to find any specific fault to criticise .<ssssss>sadly , the same can not be say of the flavour , and this be one of the most unpleasant beer i have come across .<ssssss>a straightforward sip reveal a berry-esque fruitiness , a hint of smoke and a piny bitterness .<ssssss>really not too shabby , but again , nothing exceptional .<ssssss>the problem begin when the liquid hit the back and side of the tongue , where a overwhelming inky bitterness kill everything else dead .<ssssss>its certainly bitter , but not in the please way of a ipa .<ssssss>this be a acrid , inky bitterness that linger on the palate for a unpleasantly long time .<ssssss>i can only really compare it to the time i idiotically suck some ink out of my fountain pen .<ssssss>this be all really too bad , and from speak to a few other i be not alone in my opinion -lrb- though i be alone in actually finish my glass -rrb- .<ssssss>the brewery be learn new style , and a new technique of storage and serve , so grow pain like this can be expect .<ssssss>give em time and i think they will nail it , hopefully when they do they will revisit this style and erase my memory of this gruit .<ssssss>
8 8 9 7 7		12oz bottle , 2010 vintage , pour into a small cervoise .<ssssss>a - crystal clear red-orange , with very fine-bubbled carbonation and a wisp of tan head that fade almost instantly , but leave a thick ring of lace around the glass .<ssssss>s - pungent , brandy-like whiff of alcohol , with poached pear , dry apricot , raisin , fig , and praline .<ssssss>a hint of tropical fruit in the background .<ssssss>alcohol be too forward , or this could be a 4.5 - i would be interested to try this with a good bit of age .<ssssss>t - dry fruit , caramel and nut , leather , and tobacco .<ssssss>hop bitterness build very slowly - i be sure olde school must have a hefty ibu count , but it be nearly lose behind all the sweet malt .<ssssss>very nice floral hop flavor to complement the taste of honey .<ssssss>quite boozy , though , to its detriment .<ssssss>once again , a year or five could tame this beer very well .<ssssss>m - very full body , viscous , and creamy .<ssssss>excellent .<ssssss>d - a very slow sipper to be sure .<ssssss>one be more than enough , and no length of time of the cellar be go to change that , but it would make the journey even more enjoyable .<ssssss>buy a four pack , and savor one every year or so .<ssssss>
7 6 6 4 5		deep reddish color-somewhat of a caramel bronze .<ssssss>not much in th way of aroma-slightly malty and smoke .<ssssss>malty enough flavor but a acrid , sharp smoke taste to it .<ssssss>quite medicinal and solvent like .<ssssss>ok body .<ssssss>flavor be really a let down .<ssssss>a perfect example of a we brewery do a scotch ale and do it wrong .<ssssss>smoke be way overdo .<ssssss>take away from any malt whatsoever .<ssssss>cant see it .<ssssss>

9 10 6 7 7		a - a deep , rich , very hazy honey color with a nice finger and a half of creamy , beige head .<ssssss>for a medium size head , the retention be astounding .<ssssss>it linger for about five minute before the liquid be observable through it .<ssssss>little staggered patch of lacing form on the side when i move the glass .<ssssss>at any time i swirl the glass i regain a full head .<ssssss>neat quality .<ssssss>s - amazing !<ssssss>pineapple , strong papaya , white grape , tangerine , grapefruit , pear and apple all drizzle with caramel .<ssssss>mmm !<ssssss>entice !<ssssss>t - a very sweet caramel and light-bodied malt flavor be accompany by papaya , golden raisin and fig to compose the foretaste .<ssssss>the aftertaste be a short-lived , pugent bitterness and with a touch of winter squash .<ssssss>abv be present .<ssssss>a tad cloying .<ssssss>m - froth up instantly in you mouth to a creamy , foamy texture .<ssssss>very smooth !<ssssss>the high sugar content make this a bit cloying and substantially detract from refreshment .<ssssss>d - this beer have a amazing odor .<ssssss>after that smell , any taste be a bit of a let down , but definitely more good than bad all around .<ssssss>i will make a point to savor this again , if just for the odor !<ssssss>it be too strong to session and to sweet for most food .<ssssss>i like it a lot though .<ssssss>

7 8 7 9 7		pour from a 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle into a pint glass .<ssssss>a : rubied light brown , decent head with ridiculous lacing .<ssssss>i be try three doppelbock today , and this be the lightest of they , by far .<ssssss>seem a bit off-style .<ssssss>s : alcohol-soaked grape , hazelnut coffee , a touch of caramel and a hint of banana .<ssssss>the nose be pretty faint , but that be not overly problematic .<ssssss>t : really well-blended flavor .<ssssss>light coffee , raisin , banana and brown sugar/caramel .<ssssss>the sweetness here be well-tempered by peppery alcohol and grassy hop .<ssssss>well-rounded .<ssssss>m : a bit cloying on the palate , with some real sugary lingering .<ssssss>with such a well-blended flavor profile , it be a darn shame that the least mature flavor stick around .<ssssss>d : the flavor be nice , but the cloying stickiness make I lose a lot of steam move through this one .<ssssss>
9 5 7 7 6		first off , what a fantastic label .<ssssss>pour a hazy amber with two finger of dense foam that settle slowly to a persistent half inch .<ssssss>ring of thick lace down the glass .<ssssss>smell : spicy , orange peel , chalky , bready + a little caramel in the back .<ssssss>out of place peppery component ... some non-neutral yeast character .<ssssss>taste : citrus heavy - tangerine juice , grapefruit peel , sweet pale and a little caramel backdrop .<ssssss>unfiltered apple juice .<ssssss>oily and get a bit astringent towards the end of the sip .<ssssss>medium body , fluffy feel but again , thin out .<ssssss>bone dry finish , somewhat unpleasantly dry .<ssssss>some good , some bad .<ssssss>with tweaking could be pretty good .<ssssss>
7 6 6 4 9		im not a big anheuser-busch fan , but i think they might have actually turn out something different with this brew , so i grab a sixer .<ssssss>pour into a pint glass , it have a coppery golden color , accompany by a decent white-ish head that didnt stay around .<ssssss>smell of malt with a little sweetness and light hop .<ssssss>taste be nothing special unfortunately .<ssssss>i try to be unbiased , but while drink i just feel that it be a water down effort at a decent craft beer , literally and figuratively .<ssssss>it be grainy , sweet , a bit malty , balanced by some budweiser bitter flavor .<ssssss>have no real aftertaste , just a fleeting bitterness .<ssssss>maybe a slight bump over budweiser in the flavor department .<ssssss>feel light/medium body with decent carbonation .<ssssss>of course it score well on the drinkability , but therein lie the problem .<ssssss>why drink a beer just because it go down easy , if it have nothing else go for it ?<ssssss>maybe if im watch a football game and do not want to think about anything else i will drink this , but never for the pleasure of drink a good beer because this be not one .<ssssss>

8 9 6 8 9		i be a big ipa fan and i feel that this be one you have to get you hand on .<ssssss>obviously , it have a huge amount of hop but it have enough of a citrus note to dull down some of the bitterness and add a bit more complexity to the beer .<ssssss>perfect porch beer on a summer day .<ssssss>
8 9 6 6 6		22oz .<ssssss>bomber pour into a large tulip glass .<ssssss>not quite pitch black .<ssssss>slight brown highlight and a tad bit see through .<ssssss>great 2 finger , creamy light brown color .<ssssss>lace not hang out for long .<ssssss>smell be nice !<ssssss>!<ssssss>chocolate -lrb- of course !<ssssss>! -rrb-<ssssss>a little coffee .<ssssss>sweet , dark malt taste in not the surprise the smell be .<ssssss>chocolate be not as prevalent , coffee be kind of burnt tasting .<ssssss>get a smidge of smoke ?<ssssss>sugary but not the deep rich molasses sweetness i would like this to have .<ssssss>carbonation be okay but the body on this one be a little thin .<ssssss>watery at the end .<ssssss>with the low abv -lrb- 5 % -rrb- i could probably drink quite a few of these bomber toinight , but there be too much goodness on the shelf at the bottle shop to do that .<ssssss>overall not a bad stout .<ssssss>the price be great and you could probably afford to drink this stuff all night long , but i would suggest you try this one and spend the rest of you money on a better stout .<ssssss>
6 7 7 9 8		mostly brown with a slight orangish hue .<ssssss>almost no head and very slight carbonation .<ssssss>the smell be faint but different , slightly fruity malt smell .<ssssss>the menu say `` distinctive '' and i would agree .<ssssss>just a different flavor .<ssssss>its mostly malty with a little alcohol in the end but there be more go on here than that .<ssssss>there be a overall fruity/sourness underlie the maltiness .<ssssss>pretty interesting .<ssssss>as it warm i be think milk chocolate with a slight fruitiness .<ssssss>pretty interesting .<ssssss>if you be look for something malty but not too roasty this be a good bet .<ssssss>

7 8 4 7 6		pour hazy orange with almost no head , seemingly very little carbonation , kinda strange , not sure if it be too cold or what .<ssssss>barely a pop when cork , and none of the normal co2 fog .<ssssss>nice belgian yeast aroma , fairly estery with some bubblegum note .<ssssss>some apricot , grapefruit , a little sweetness and a slight tickle of alcohol .<ssssss>mouthfeel be again strange , nearly flat , very very little effervescence .<ssssss>taste of sweet fruit follow by hop bitterness and some alcohol , slightly fusely .<ssssss>bitterness be fairly strong and forward .<ssssss>pick up mostly pine from the hop .<ssssss>i really do not know what to think about this , because i can not tell if we get a bad bottle , and i be not sure we will find another .<ssssss>so , i will give it a little more than i normally would because i feel like something not right with this bottle .<ssssss>edit : base on other 's review , i really think we bottle be not properly carbonate for some reason .<ssssss>

6 8 6 5 6		best by date of january 2012/consumed 09/07/11 .<ssssss>pour a dark amber with brown tone and a white head .<ssssss>look a bit dark for a ipa but not bad .<ssssss>nose be really pleasant with assertive fresh pineapple one might expect and hope for but there be also tone of oak and nice floral undertone .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium/full and mouthfilling but there be no `` brightness '' to this beer that i favor so much in all brew .<ssssss>flavor be a bit of a disappointment , partly because the brightness be lack but also there be a dull bitter ; a `` tree bark '' herbal type of bitter that may be hop but remain somewhat unappealing .<ssssss>the finish be big , bold and assertive but , again , there be a dull , `` old grapefruit skin '' character to the finish that be overwhelming .<ssssss>not a beer for I although i really appreciate the chance to try it from a brewery that i do not often see .<ssssss>

7 6 8 9 9		pour into a tumbler as recommend , this beer look to be somewhere between light brown and orange in color , and have a smallish foamy head .<ssssss>while it look pretty good , it do not exude much smell at all .<ssssss>i could detect a faint smokiness but nothing else .<ssssss>when consume , the beer clearly ooze the mild smoky taste of chipotle pepper .<ssssss>this be balanced well by the sweet fruitiness of the caramel malt and some well choose citric hop from the pacific northwest .<ssssss>pretty similar in flavor to chase mexican food down with a american pale ale which happen to be a pretty good beer and food pairing combination in my opinion .<ssssss>the flavor work well together and the aftertaste be densely smoky .<ssssss>quite juicy and medium thick on the palette , this would work splendidly well as a aperitif .<ssssss>overall , a much better beer than i be think it be go to be .<ssssss>

8 9 4 9 9		sample february 2007 as i pour this brew a mix of rum , molasses , madeira , rum , and sweeten espresso greet my nose .<ssssss>the beer pour with a thin , light brown head and a pitch black body that show a clear , deep chocolate brown color when i hold the stream of cascade liquid from the bottle up to the light .<ssssss>the head disappear fairly quickly , which be not unexpected from a brew of this strength .<ssssss>big aromatic note of chocolate , roasted malt , coffee bean , malt ball jump out of the glass .<ssssss>i can not believe how much dark chocolate character be pack into this brew .<ssssss>a nice toast biscuit character be find here that also tend to accentuate the chocolate character in some way .<ssssss>alcohol be evident in the aromatic finish , but never really detract , instead add a bit of almost balance sharpness and even , dare i think it , a bit of blacken cherry like fruitiness .<ssssss>it have a huge dark malt drive aroma , but without all that harsh , burnt , acrid , astringent , grain husk character that be find in many dark malt character brew .<ssssss>the malt aromatic come across as be so smooth and entice .<ssssss>the aroma be like a espresso soak , rich , flourless dark chocolate cake ; decadent , rich , satiate and smooth , i can not wait for my first bite , err , i mean sip .<ssssss>nice and creamy feeling up front , yet still not too heavy or sticky on the palate .<ssssss>that huge , smooth , dark chocolate character be certainly find up front , but the roast / burnt grain character really be much more noticeable in the flavor .<ssssss>black , approach acrid , dark roasted espresso note finish this beer off with the corresponding burnt acidity and sharp black coffee note one would expect of a typical imperial stout .<ssssss>while these note do not go away , they certainly become a bit more smooth and in control after the first bit of palate shock .<ssssss>the flavor of this beer remain so smooth and chocolate-like up front , yet somehow manage to morph by the finish to a dark , concentrated , even almost unsweetened espresso drink by the finish .<ssssss>i can not help but wonder if this be a good or bad thing .<ssssss>on the one hand the up front , smooth character be so entice that you want to hang on to it for as long as possible .<ssssss>too quickly though the rough , burley espresso note take hold , and in the end beg for you to balance that lingeringly , astringent burn character out by take another sip so you can experience that smooth imperialistic , hearty stout goodness again .<ssssss>of course the cycle then start all over again .<ssssss>what a dynamic brew , the dichotomy be such a interesting experience .<ssssss>be this what i want in a brew ?<ssssss>i do not know , but it be certainly a enjoyable ride .<ssssss>that fact that this brew can be so easy drinking , yet so -lrb- in a balancing way really -rrb- sharp and , dare i think it , harsh make this such a engaging experience .<ssssss>this beer could certainly survive a lot of year in the cellar .<ssssss>there be a ample hop bitterness here , that while secondary to the roast malt character , be no slouch in its own right .<ssssss>also there be a sharp alcohol note that add a bit of a `` shot of rum '' type kick to the finish that can only smooth out a bit with time .<ssssss>in fact the finish at time seem to down-right suck because it can be so harsh .<ssssss>ultimately this beer be such the consummate sip brew .<ssssss>the combination of rich chocolate , creamy malt character up front and the sharp , roast dominate character in the finish make for a brew that just can not be quaff .<ssssss>this be despite the fact that this be certainly not the biggest bodied of imperial stout -lrb- though it be certainly no slouch either -rrb- .<ssssss>i still have not quite figure out what to think of this brew .<ssssss>i be only part way through my first glass of this brew .<ssssss>in the end it be so dynamic and engaging that i can not help but be excite with this brew .<ssssss>there be a lot of thing `` wrong '' with this beer , but they somehow add up to a totality of a experience that i can not really knock it in the end .<ssssss>the aroma say this brew be magnificent , while the flavor , take as individual component say this be a train-wreck , but in the end this dichotomous flavor profile just work as a total experience , or better yet it be a roller coaster , which just have to be experience .<ssssss>part of the experience of this brew for I be that i can not quite place this brew ; be this brew a jarring train-wreck of flavor , or be it a absolutely stunningly awesome brew because of it flaw ?<ssssss>i still can not quite answer the question , but the experience have be so engaging and though provoke that i just can not help but love this beer .<ssssss>purchase : park lane liquor , lancaster can<ssssss>

8 8 6 5 6		a-transparent orange gold with a lot of bubble and a thick cream color head , there be ton of bubble !<ssssss>s-smell very much like a traditional ale but the belgian hop be very sweet and strong .<ssssss>they smell nice .<ssssss>there be a good spicyness to it as well .<ssssss>t-it hit with a tasty amount of belgian hop and spice but quickly transform in to a undesirable taste that slightly remind I of bad breath .<ssssss>it be also a bit tangy at the end .<ssssss>the after-taste be of decent honey and belgian hop .<ssssss>m-medium to heavy carbonation with a finish that be between creamy and watery d-it do not go down too harshly but for the style there be so many other acquirable beer i would pick first .<ssssss>i imagine i could drink a few of these if i have to though .<ssssss>
8 7 10 9 9		i pour this beer into a 12 oz .<ssssss>mug and it fit perfectly with a nice two-finger head on it .<ssssss>the lacing be fairly substantial and the head dim down to a light ring of froth around the edge which stick with it all the way down the glass .<ssssss>a wet-hay color with golden hue persist through this mostly clear beer .<ssssss>the odor be nothing to write home about .<ssssss>very light fragrance of apricot and other dry fruit waft up with a light spiciness .<ssssss>good , but you have to really dig to get the odor out , nothing hit you right-away .<ssssss>the beer sit in you mouth with a crisp , well-rounded feel and swallow with a tingly freshness that be quite delightful .<ssssss>the taste be a tad leathery -lrb- this be a positive thing -rrb- and the crisp dryness be not overbearing .<ssssss>it be cut with fruity note of apple , apricot and berry on the swallow .<ssssss>it be well-rounded and less bitter than the average ipa -lrb- probably due to the length of time , which usually mellow out the hop flavor . -rrb-<ssssss>this beer be a delight .<ssssss>it taste like a ideal library : full of leather-bound book on mahogany shelf with a crackling fire on a crisp autumn day .<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 8		appearance : golden copper color with a thick white creamy head .<ssssss>good head retention and good lacing .<ssssss>aroma : malty aroma .<ssssss>sweet smell .<ssssss>taste : somewhat bitter twangy initial flavor follow by a nice malty finish .<ssssss>i pick up slight vanilla note .<ssssss>mouthfeel : excellent mouthfeel .<ssssss>somewhat chewy and substantial .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 7		this be a specialty beer to savour in small quanty .<ssssss>i could not imagine drink several , but one be very very good .<ssssss>the aroma be unbelievable .<ssssss>a strong fruity smell grab you nose as it be poor .<ssssss>maybe slightly like plum , but very sweet and yeasty also .<ssssss>the dark amber color really need back light to set it off .<ssssss>the head build nice and thick like a dirty brown shaving cream , but fade back to a thin film after a coupple sip .<ssssss>the taste be almost overwelm by the aroma .<ssssss>it be a slightly sweet at the start finish with a slighly acidty bitter taste that linger well after swallow .<ssssss>some vauge chocolate and coffee taste come through .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be very full .<ssssss>a very good drink and well worth look for .<ssssss>
9 6 8 5 5		aroma : very light malt aroma appearance : huge foamy head , light brown in color .<ssssss>very dark brown , with ruby highlight , almost opaque .<ssssss>clarity be very good in the highlight .<ssssss>flavor : dark malt flavor dominate up front : light chocolate and coffee .<ssssss>not roasty in any way , just dark malt .<ssssss>malt flavor seem somewhat muted , so i be think this example be a bit old and oxidize .<ssssss>hop bitterness be low , ibu about 20 .<ssssss>very light hop flavor .<ssssss>body & mouthfeel : moderate-low body .<ssssss>finish somewhat dry .<ssssss>overall : a disappointment : i bet this beer taste a lot better fresh from the brewery .<ssssss>if i ever get to portugal , i will try it there .<ssssss>i would classify this as a schwarzbier style .<ssssss>
4 9 8 8 7		gusher alert .<ssssss>wish i would read previous review on this myself : half the bottle be lose to my floor ... and at $ 20 + a bottle , i be not so thrill .<ssssss>oxidize brown-red color -lrb- quite attractive , really -rrb- , tight carbonation bubble in abundance , and smell of cherry , wild yeast , and burnt rubber .<ssssss>fun to sniff .<ssssss>the taste be a little less exciting , dominate by ton of cherry , some sweet , some tart .<ssssss>after mop up my floor which be quite sticky from the beer , i be surprise that the beer itself be not cloyingly sweet ; the tartness balanced residual sugar quite nicely .<ssssss>be not get much other than cherry , however , so grow bore of the beer after a glass .<ssssss>fortunately , the smell keep thing interesting enough to plow through what be leave of the bottle after spillage .<ssssss>have to dock appearance point for the packaging snafu .<ssssss>not fair , i know -- but this be a professional beer , and packaging -lrb- not marketing , mind you -rrb- be important .<ssssss>especially at this price point .<ssssss>
8 9 7 7 6		12 ounce bottle purchase from the stuff sandwich for seven dollar , batch 24 : `` golden rose '' , could not find a date on the website but seem at least three year old if not more , consume on 1/12/09 , review from note , pour into my small ommegang glass , color be not so golden , actually a darker orange , thin 1/4 inch bubbly white head that go away immediately , no lacing , smell be mostly belgian candi sugar but also have some honey , floral hop , sweet malt , and vegetable , lot of flowery flavor right up front , sweet malt in the middle mixed with fruit like cherry and blackberry , finish have some bread and pepper , get sweeter as it warm up with spice and wine-like taste come to the surface , it be a complex tripel , sweet , slightly spicy , and fruity mouthfeel , medium body , good amount of carbonation , taste linger a little bit as actually get dryer as time go on which be odd , could drink a little more than the bottle but it be heavy because of all its different flavor , some booze be present too which be not a good thing because it be a relatively low alcohol tripel , try this before pop the cassis version which i enjoy more than this one to get a idea of what the base beer be like , not hair of the dog 's best effort but still a above average tripel , would drink again , should continue to age nicely , recommend<ssssss>
8 9 6 7 7		be hang on to the bottle for too long now .<ssssss>time to get into it .<ssssss>head retention could be a bit better but it could be the glass .<ssssss>pitch black color with a thick foam tan head .<ssssss>it settle to a thin lace .<ssssss>low carbonation .<ssssss>textbook aroma .<ssssss>roasty , some coffee and chocolate .<ssssss>decadent .<ssssss>a touch of alcohol hint at the strength .<ssssss>taste and mouthfeel just do not live up to the expectation here .<ssssss>a huge build up but it be not quite meet .<ssssss>not enough substance to back up what be expect .<ssssss>go down much to light .<ssssss>the taste leave the mouth much too quickly so you never get the satisfaction of enjoy what have so much potential .<ssssss>just finish way too quickly .<ssssss>overall it be still a enjoyable beer .<ssssss>just seem too thin .<ssssss>a bit more body and this would be fantastic .<ssssss>
8 8 6 5 6		12 oz bottle pour into a large snifter - best before september 2007 -lrb- oop -rrb- appearance : pour a slightly hazy ruby and copper color with a strong vibrance of orange and red .<ssssss>the head top 2 inch and be off white in color .<ssssss>it become cake-like and show off its many crater .<ssssss>smell : hop oil and grapefruit be strong aroma .<ssssss>a melange of berry be hide in there , though and make this beer awesome to sniff .<ssssss>lemon peel , raspberry , cherry , apple and alcohol round out the aroma .<ssssss>taste : wow .<ssssss>after all those great aroma i be surprise to find that there be not much go on in the flavor department .<ssssss>initial flavor be hop flower and lavendar .<ssssss>malt then become the victor and balance out this beer .<ssssss>lemon and slight grapefruit be other contributor .<ssssss>alcohol be present .<ssssss>mouthfeel : nicely carbonate with a alcohol presence on the throat and the nostril .<ssssss>since flavor and sweetness be not outstanding , alcohol sort of become the focal point of this brew .<ssssss>drinkability : pretty good .<ssssss>i hope that this be a victim of be drunk beyond the freshness date , but i doubt it .<ssssss>i wish a flavor would have stand out more to catch my attention .<ssssss>this be a good beer but it fall behind in a league of extraordinary counterpart in the market .<ssssss>at 7 % , i be sure a few would bring on a buzz .<ssssss>
8 7 10 8 8		this ale pour a pale golden yellow with a frothy white head that remind I of a cafe frappe with milk that i have have in greece .<ssssss>there be not too much presence of anything in the aroma , slight floral hop , but no malt .<ssssss>the taste however be a interesting mix of fruitiness and vanilla , with a good balance of slight sweetness and bitterness .<ssssss>i be partial to the nitrogenated beer , and this one be no exception , as it make the beer velvety-smooth .<ssssss>it be a fairly average alcohol content that you can not taste or feel , yield a very high drinkability .<ssssss>
7 4 10 6 6		once again thanks to tweidman420 for the generosity .<ssssss>pour into a pint glass .<ssssss>a : pour a golden orange color with gold tint around the edge .<ssssss>minimal head fade quickly leave behind splotch of thin lacing .<ssssss>thin , soapy bubble linger over the entire surface .<ssssss>s : not much that can be discern here .<ssssss>hint of toffee and malt .<ssssss>t : very grain malt presence preside over the entire engagement with this beverage .<ssssss>some earthy hop make they way to the tongue but then jump back off as soon as they do .<ssssss>better than the smell , but still not a whole lot go on .<ssssss>m : at least it come through here .<ssssss>medium body , bitterness be noticeable , but do right .<ssssss>slightly slick finish .<ssssss>i really could not ask for more here .<ssssss>d : this one seem like it do not reach its full potential .<ssssss>i would probably drink it over a few other beer i know of , but i will definitely not be seek it out .<ssssss>
9 8 10 10 7		extremely dark in appearance , even in the pour the colour appear a dark mahogany with a slight purple tinge .<ssssss>the only downside be a foamy brown head that make it look like coke .<ssssss>the nose be extremely roasty with hint of coffee and a sweetness that be not quite like chocolate .<ssssss>the taste be unparallelled as far as stout go .<ssssss>heavy in both flavour and body , it be a true delight to drink .<ssssss>on the bitter side of the spectrum there be coffee , dark chocolate and a healthy dose of hop .<ssssss>on the sweet side there be chocolate and the lighter malt hide in there somewhere .<ssssss>it be like a huge power struggle between the two .<ssssss>one of the most beautifully bittersweet beer i have try .<ssssss>drinkability be more tailor to sip slowly -lrb- even with a low abv -rrb- but i can not wait to have another .<ssssss>
9 9 6 4 4		bottle from awesome trader douglasjamjak .<ssssss>thanks man .<ssssss>pour a awesome black with 2 finger of head and lacing that cling like its life depend on it .<ssssss>the nose be incredible , bright cherry with a mild sour and toast almond .<ssssss>taste , however be disappointing .<ssssss>tart , yes , cherry , yes ... but the char flavor and the dark malt just do not really work for it .<ssssss>almost like a porter and sour mix together ... interesting idea , awesome look and smell , but no thanks .<ssssss>
6 6 5 3 4		ruby cola color with big brown fluffy head with great retention .<ssssss>chocolate , cola , molasses and herbal aroma .<ssssss>salty chocolate and guarana , birch , juniper and other herbs/spices .<ssssss>astringent bitter linger with light sweetness .<ssssss>thin feel with moderate-high carbonation .<ssssss>no matter what i could not get agood taste out of this .<ssssss>the only thing that help a little be allow it to warm further .<ssssss>still , flavor be muddy when not overshadow by a overwhelming astringency .<ssssss>
6 7 6 4 6		first off , the bottle look cool .<ssssss>the raise design in the side of it be a nice touch .<ssssss>the beer pour a pretty average-looking amber color , with about one finger worth of white head .<ssssss>there be a pretty good amount of carbonation present as well , with rise bubble plainly visible .<ssssss>it smell kind of sweet , a good smell , but not one i usually associate with beer .<ssssss>the beer taste much like it smell , kind of sweet , but somehow it manage to have a bitter taste at the same time , and seem fairly watery .<ssssss>quite bizzare .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be ok , a bit watery .<ssssss>as for drinkability , well i have certainly have worse beer , but i have also have far better one too .<ssssss>i do not think i will be drink this again , it just taste so odd to I .<ssssss>
8 8 10 9 8		the bottle i buy have a different label than the one that be show on the beeradvocate site there be a place for a expiration date but there be nothing there though the cork say 19/01 on it .<ssssss>huge rocky head with definite belgian lace and a deep gold color .<ssssss>aroma be subtle and complex with a definite mineral scent and light dry malt .<ssssss>flavor be nice with spiciness from the yeast alternate with a dry maltiness a bit of hop run around in there as well .<ssssss>mouthfeel be just perfect for this beer as there be enough of a rough carbonic bite to keep the mouth from get bore while there be not so much as to overpower the palate .<ssssss>i would try this one again because i think that there be more go on here than what one can experience from one tasting session .<ssssss>
8 7 9 10 8		this be the first beer that i be try out of the 12-pack sampler and damn , be i impressed !<ssssss>pour out dark brown , almost ruby color .<ssssss>the head be on the small side and quickly disappear .<ssssss>the scent be very subtle , a roasted aroma , kind of nutty .<ssssss>the taste be downright amazing .<ssssss>caramel , nut , and roasted malt .<ssssss>go down great and leave a creamy feeling in you mouth .<ssssss>a excellent brew by saranac .<ssssss>i almost wish all 12 of the beer in the pack be black forest , but i be excite to try the other as well .<ssssss>this have quickly become one of my favorite beer and i would definitely get it on a regular basis .<ssssss>highly recommen , enjoy !<ssssss>
7 6 8 6 6		look super darkish ... with a reddish hue to it ... head a pretty tan color smell ... um not too good i like the comparision to soy sauce that someone else describe taste ... like a old strong porter ... honestly i can not say that any flavor strike I ?<ssssss>maybe it be the aging process that make it smooth ... but not smooth in a fun way ... smooth in a kenny g kinda way ... .<ssssss>mouthfeel ... .<ssssss>creamy and good drinkability ... .<ssssss>ehhhh i would drink it again but be not worth the 4 buck plus i pay for it<ssssss>
5 6 4 6 6		pour a reddish brown color with a this fizzy head it look like pop , highly carbonated and fizzy.picked up mainly caramel malt in the aroma along with some light roasted nuttiness.man the mouthfeel be like pop as well sharp on the tongue and pretty thin.taste of sweet caramel and roasted grain with even some soapiness in there late.wow really let down by this beer i really like the klaster lager and winter lager but this fall way way short of those two , i will stick with they .<ssssss>
7 7 8 5 7		wow !<ssssss>there be sure be a awful lot go on here .<ssssss>a small tight head that disappear towards the half way mark but retain some exceptional lacing to the very bitter end .<ssssss>where to start ?<ssssss>, smell of apple , iced tea , heavily dilluted scotch and a shot of pledge .<ssssss>mouthfeel be smooth and creamy with light carbanation .<ssssss>color be adeep amber / dirty orange with a haze but not cloudy .<ssssss>once it warm up the alchohol presence be more noticable .<ssssss>at first be almost too much for I but seem to grow on I towards the end .<ssssss>for those who like the heavy this be a good selection , not really for I , if i be to do this one again i would pair it with a dessert .<ssssss>
8 10 6 7 9		not sure why this be list as a bsda - it should really be list as a american wild ale .<ssssss>pour with a healthy 2f of foamy tan head over a thick , burnt-amber color body .<ssssss>decent level of carbonation flow up , and lot of lacing leave afterwards .<ssssss>aroma be fantastic -lrb- pure wild ale -rrb- .<ssssss>plenty of sweet & sour , mixed with dark fruit , belgian yeast , cinnamon-like spice , sneaker , and horseblanket .<ssssss>slightly tinny up front on the palate , and the flavor do not rip you tastebud , as the aroma suggest .<ssssss>but still taste terrific - dark fruit , plenty of woody/bark character , birch beer , and a light pull of lemon-like sour .<ssssss>carbonation seem to disappear , bury by some of the rich flavor .<ssssss>this be probably just average on the mouthfeel , imo - whether you consider this a wild ale or bsda .<ssssss>drinkability be quite high on this , as with most offering from jp .<ssssss>plenty of interesting aroma & flavor , and smooth go down .<ssssss>
4 4 4 6 4		even pour it out of the can do not produce much of a head .<ssssss>crisp taste though .<ssssss>could be a good `` wedding '' type beer if trap at such a poor function .<ssssss>although i probably would opt for water instead .<ssssss>
7 7 8 6 8		serve in pint glass .<ssssss>pour to a hazy gold color .<ssssss>it have a large -lrb- almost 1 '' thick -rrb- white head that disappeard within 30 seconds .<ssssss>the lemon overpower the smell but some wheat be detectable .<ssssss>the taste be decent , the wheat appear first but be chase off by the lemon .<ssssss>it have a light mouthfeel and go down easy on a hot summer day .<ssssss>
7 7 4 6 6		part of the nepa bc split from back in november .<ssssss>pour a pretty dark brown , darker in the glass than on the pour but certainly not the `` black as night '' note on the label .<ssssss>head be more bubbly than dense and produce about a finger and a half of foam , which settle to a bubbly , uneven lace without much stick on the side .<ssssss>smell have a please whiskey aroma up front , with note of vanilla and wood .<ssssss>behind it be some sweet malt , chocolate and caramel with some roasted note and a hint of coffee as well .<ssssss>the malt base be pretty light , however , and lack much depth .<ssssss>it smell thin , which for a barrel aged imperial stout do not seem to portend good thing ... taste be , as the nose predict it might be , pretty thin .<ssssss>it just lack the depth of flavor that a imperial stout , barrel aged or not , should deliver .<ssssss>it have some roasted and coffee note , with a bit of sweetness , but those then wash almost completely away as the whiskey flavor assert itself .<ssssss>it be not that the whiskey be overpower , because it be not - it be actually pretty nice - it be just that the stout itself be very weak .<ssssss>the whiskey be pleasant and have some vanilla flavor as well , plus there be a woody quality in the finish .<ssssss>just a touch of alcohol heat .<ssssss>the whiskey actually save this from score even lower .<ssssss>mouthfeel be woefully thin for a imperial stout .<ssssss>it be a medium body , but barely , and lack a creaminess to make it feel fuller .<ssssss>carbonation be fine and it be pretty smooth , but i like my impy with more meat on they bone .<ssssss>this just do not cut it .<ssssss>the whiskey quality here be pretty nice , aggressive without be overdo , but the stout itself fall flat .<ssssss>it be too thin and lack much character , make the final product pretty subpar , particularly in a category with so many outstanding beer .<ssssss>the whiskey save it from be a complete disappointment in fact .<ssssss>once i finish a sip and the palate be clean , it feel as though i be drink a highball of whiskey rather than a beer ; that be the case , i would rather just drink the whiskey .<ssssss>
5 4 7 6 7		ive get the mom hefeweizen .<ssssss>pour out crystal clear , look like a pbr in a glass .<ssssss>be this really a hefe ?<ssssss>can not they just call it a wheat ale ?<ssssss>it smell like ginger and hop .<ssssss>taste just the same with a little much ginger and too many hop for the style , but that be typical of rouge .<ssssss>its alright , its just not a hefeweizen .<ssssss>
10 6 8 8 8		think imperial irish dry stout instead of russian imperial stout ... a : bottle open with a ` gunshot pop '' and pour a dark black with a monstrous 2.5 '' dark tan head .<ssssss>fantastic retention .<ssssss>no fault here ... s : citrus , roasted malt , cocoa , and chocolate malt .<ssssss>light ester mix in with the hop .<ssssss>all very light aroma .<ssssss>t : acidic darker and roasted malt , the same cocoa as detect in the smell be present here as well .<ssssss>light hop bitterness back it up .<ssssss>dry finish with a light roast and chocolate linger .<ssssss>m : smooth and silky -- reminiscent of a irish dry stout .<ssssss>incredibly creamy -- intriguing , not what i be expect at all .<ssssss>d : a very interesting and enjoyable beer .<ssssss>that say , it be not anything like i be expect .<ssssss>what i would expect a `` imperial irish dry stout '' to be like , if there be such a thing ...<ssssss>
7 7 8 5 6		pour into a new belgium globe .<ssssss>appearance : pour out pretty thick for a porter , and a nice dark brown head form on top .<ssssss>unfortunately , the retention be really lousy ; it recede to a hair-thin halo in less than a minute .<ssssss>body be as close to black as brown can get ; nearly opaque .<ssssss>only a tiny bit of light peak through near the top of the glass , and that be only when the beer be hold to light .<ssssss>very light lacing .<ssssss>smell : roasted malt and salty chinook be the two big aroma that i be get .<ssssss>i suppose mocha be in there as well .<ssssss>pretty simple - that be about it .<ssssss>taste : this start out really nice ; the first couple of sip be damn good .<ssssss>unfortunately , there be a odd aftertaste that continue to build with each successive slurp .<ssssss>it be hard to get past .<ssssss>it be kinda sour , but also stale .<ssssss>it remind I of old cheese - parmesan cheese .<ssssss>maybe noodle as well .<ssssss>it be become really off-putting at this point .<ssssss>be it the water ?<ssssss>roasted malt and mocha be hide underneath , along with some piney bitterness in the finish .<ssssss>too bad , this show promise ... mouthfeel : this feel nice .<ssssss>crisp , but not overdo , carbonation .<ssssss>somewhat creamy .<ssssss>a little fuller in body than most porter , but i typically like that .<ssssss>the aftertaste be mild and long-lasting , which would have be great if only it taste better .<ssssss>overall , the mouthfeel be nicely do .<ssssss>drinkability : this be one step away from be a great porter .<ssssss>that flavor that dominate the aftertaste be funky , but that be the only big problem with this one .<ssssss>hopefully my man up in magalia can get that work out .<ssssss>
6 6 7 9 9		appearance - a pale tinted dark beer , pour a very thin head that quickly disappear .<ssssss>something of a hazy brown coloration .<ssssss>smell - a high alcohol smell be the first thing to notice , as rightfully it be a 8.0 abv .<ssssss>a pretty strong raisin or grape scent , with some possible juniper or mint around .<ssssss>taste - i be surprise that at 8.0 abv , and because of the strong smell , that i do not mind the taste upon first sip .<ssssss>pretty smooth , raisin and orange taste .<ssssss>mouthfeel - could stand to have a bit more consistency , and texture to it .<ssssss>do not have a lot of body consider its abv .<ssssss>drinkability - surprisingly drinkable consider<ssssss>
8 7 6 8 6		i have hear & # 8216 ; knowledgeable & # 8217 ; people about town talk this one up .<ssssss>i finally crack it , and it be less than stellar ; it deserve no hype whatsoever .<ssssss>a & # 8211 ; hazy orange-amber hue , close to iced tea , with a large white head full of micro-bubble , and the lacing , wow , it look like the snow fall .<ssssss>s & # 8211 ; grapefruit-y hop , some malt , some sour brett ; these aroma meld fairly well , but they do not achieve any astounding dynamic .<ssssss>t & # 8211 ; underwhelm , at first .<ssssss>i then begin to appreciate a vinous , creamy flavor ; saucy and quite l. my closest reference be the unusual saison d & # 8217 ; erpe-mere .<ssssss>m & # 8211 ; it be relatively syrupy , give the flavor profile ; i be underwhelm , again .<ssssss>d & # 8211 ; de proef be sometimes a bit sheisty , in my experience ; i have have a number of underwhelming and/or half-assed offering from this brouwerij .<ssssss>this be a underachieving brew as well .<ssssss>the beer be pretty good , but it be certainly not what i would expect from a unison of two of the foremost brewer in the game .<ssssss>
9 10 8 8 9		appearance : light golden color , with a very big head .<ssssss>aroma : light crisp aroma , with hint of citrus .<ssssss>flavor : crisp citrus taste with a hint of spice and a somewhat tart finish .<ssssss>feel : medium-light body , highly carbonated .<ssssss>overall : this beer start with a very good crisp aroma .<ssssss>the first mouthful feel very fizzy , fuzzy .<ssssss>although light body , the high carbonation render the sensation of feeling full .<ssssss>
6 8 6 6 4		im not a big fan on weizenbock so that a good reason why i didnt like this .<ssssss>this beer have a great head about it , and have a brown color to it .<ssssss>it actually look like a ipa .<ssssss>the aroma be nice healthy and strong , full of hop flavor and as for the malt when you drink this you know its a weizen .<ssssss>its hard to judge this not like weizen but know that all the style that i do like they hit it right on the money ill have to say assume that they weizenbock be do well .<ssssss>the volk weizen or as they call it `` the people beer '' combine the strong malty component of a bock and the tangyness of a hefe weizen .<ssssss>this beer taste very closely to they abbey roade belgian ale and be a specialty that be server in the month of december .<ssssss>

7 8 9 10 8		bell 's bourbon barrel aged expedition/double cream stout blend , 10 % abv , on tap at capital ale house , downtown location , richmond , va , on january 26th , 2009 at black moonday .<ssssss>appearance : arrive a thick-looking bastard of a brew in a 10 oz .<ssssss>cervoise , a practically black , oily body though with flourish of ... something ... around the edge , not quite garnet , but not quite brown either .<ssssss>the head be relatively fast-fading head , though at 10 % abv and barrel aged , what do you expect ?<ssssss>a faint sprawl of sheen and thin tan foam of lace be all that be leave after it be go .<ssssss>to be honest , there be not much go on here , but i have learn that brew that do not always look great do not look great for a reason .<ssssss>aroma : maple syrup absolutely dominate , back up by a strong , heavily oaky bourbon note , spicy with a slight prickle .<ssssss>it be very , very sweet smell , heavily roasted , with lot of note approach pure caramel and/or toffee .<ssssss>taste : the melding of note here lend a overwhelming butterscotch-esque note here , sweet and buttery , though not cloying or `` bad '' by any stretch of the imagination .<ssssss>just have to get that out of the way , as it be the dominant tasting note here .<ssssss>the rest - a faintly chocolate-like spike , a spicy , estery , woody bourbon lick , fainter hint of char and vanilla , stronger overtone of maple syrup and caramel - all surge and bubble underneath this layer in a wonderful orgy of flavor .<ssssss>this be one big , bold-tasting brew .<ssssss>mouthfeel : thick but big bubble , that sort of `` frozen in time '' feel , crisp but sticky .<ssssss>bubble be big , but it be oh-so-foamy and creamy give the thickness and how well it hold together .<ssssss>drinkability : well there ` ya have it .<ssssss>very , very glad i get the chance to try this one .<ssssss>it be a huge , flavorful , over the top brew - and what do you expect from a melding and barrel aging of two of bell 's other biggest , over the top brew ?<ssssss>- that manage to hit most of the right note .<ssssss>the sweetness may not be to some 's liking , the high abv % to other , but it do wonder for I - i would be glad to have it again .<ssssss>
8 7 6 5 7		pour from bottle into pint glass .<ssssss>share at christmas with family .<ssssss>deep velvety thick haze ... brown/amber .<ssssss>little head , with slight lacing .<ssssss>bitter and sour cider aroma ; almost like a champagne .<ssssss>taste of bitter/sour apple cider .<ssssss>this do not resemble a belgian ale at all ... i taste no belgian yeast , but it simply taste like a cider or apple type champagne .<ssssss>alone , it be actually ok , but its not what i be expect at all for a `` holiday '' ale , or any ale for that matter , and certainly not worth the $ 15 i pay for it ... i would never ever buy again .<ssssss>
8 10 7 7 8		unfiltered , but not sure if it be bottle-conditioned .<ssssss>the label recommend mix in the lees , so i gently turn the bottle on its side and let it rest before open .<ssssss>freshness notch indicate it be bottle in jan -lrb- no year -rrb- very slight haze in luscious orange .<ssssss>nice white head rise up after i start pour straight down the middle .<ssssss>ladder and lace form on the glass .<ssssss>wonderful , entice orange aroma pierce by a high brightness .<ssssss>i could smell this all day .<ssssss>sharp orange sweetness open up into serious grapefruit rind , and whole crate of grapefruit slice up the finish and finish and finish , a finish so long it grow even sharper until i can almost taste the knife .<ssssss>sharp carbonation .<ssssss>do i mention how sharp this beer be ?<ssssss>maybe it be * too * fresh .<ssssss>good stuff , but i might wait a little while before open the next one .<ssssss>
7 6 9 9 8		appearance : pour a inky , crude-looking black body with a tiny beige head .<ssssss>smell : roasted malt aroma of dark chocolate , molasses , and coffee bean .<ssssss>there be a ton of odd fruity ester encapsulate in the aroma , like melon , banana , and berry , none of which follow over into the flavor .<ssssss>taste : rich flavor of dark chocolate , roasted malt , molasses , and just a hint of coffee , sort of like a cake batter or brownie mix , though it be never overly sweet .<ssssss>a peppery bitterness grow and last into the roasty finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel : medium-full body .<ssssss>very little carbonation .<ssssss>velvety mouthfeel .<ssssss>drinkability : hmm ... not bad !<ssssss>a tasty , one-of-a-kind stout .<ssssss>
6 5 4 8 7		a - hazy golden yellow amber top by a fizzy , leathery skin white head that recede to a thin disk a little quicker than it should .<ssssss>thankfully , some nice splotch of lace adhere to the glass .<ssssss>s - the aroma be big on coriander , huge on coriander as a matter of fact , with very few other aroma perceptible .<ssssss>some hint of orange be in there , but they be along the same bandwidth as the citrusy coriander aroma and the two become nearly indistinguishable .<ssssss>thick volatile coriander compound be feel heavily in the nostril .<ssssss>too .<ssssss>much .<ssssss>spice .<ssssss>t - the taste of orange peel definitely come through , seem like navel or sweet valencia as oppose to bitter curacao .<ssssss>juicy fresh orange flavor be nice , but coriander still dominate and fill up the sinus in such a way that discerning other flavor require a shovel and a archaeological sifter .<ssssss>there be some grassy hop flavor , very little bitterness -lrb- good -rrb- , and decent pale malt and wheat sweetness .<ssssss>finish with a brut sweetness but not quite dry , with still plenty of coriander .<ssssss>the fashion that the orange peel be use here be what bump the score up from average to good , but there be still a very hard line between this 4 and a 4.5 .<ssssss>mf - lack that wheaty softness that i be look for , this one start out plush but quickly go to thinly juicy as soon as carbonation get a foothold .<ssssss>that would be fine if the bubble last -- they be prickly and tight but disappear as quick as they come on , leave the brew flat , thin , and unsatisfying .<ssssss>d - this dude have alot of up and downs .<ssssss>the friar could be a excellent example of wit with just a few minor tweak .<ssssss>the first be carbonation and perhaps grain content , and the second be not so damn much coriander .<ssssss>with these ideal in mind , it be really not that bad but could be far better .<ssssss>
6 7 9 8 8		jet black with a small head that fizzle to nothing during a rather hasty session .<ssssss>a twirl will only bring a bit of bubble back to the top .<ssssss>aroma be coffee and chocolate .<ssssss>lightly roasted .<ssssss>nothing too complex on the palate , it simply follow the malty characteristic above .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be a medium and enjoyable .<ssssss>i do not have too many other `` breakfast stout '' to compare this to , but i enjoy a nice malty stout as my nightcap .<ssssss>cheer to this local brewery !<ssssss>
6 6 8 6 6		i sample a 650 ml bottle in a tulip .<ssssss>a : pour a amber with a hint of cooper color with a head that barely register as a white top that dissipate quickly after pour .<ssssss>s : pleasant with hint of spice and some banana ester .<ssssss>the smell of alcohol be a bit strong .<ssssss>t : the initial sip bring out the spice and banana flavor but quickly the alcohol overcome the mellow flavor and combine with a slightly bitter hop bite at the back end of the drink leave a dull bitterness that linger on way after the glass be back on the table .<ssssss>mouthfeel : medium body with moderate carbonation .<ssssss>not very refreshing or mellow like high-end tripel .<ssssss>drinkability : its a drinkable beer but not one i will go out of my way to try again .<ssssss>its a tad bitter for my taste and it have little to distinguish itself from other beer .<ssssss>
5 3 7 4 5		truly one of the most pale beer i have review .<ssssss>active carbonation , but the bubble rise more slowly , give it a viscous appearance .<ssssss>headless as a holiday hen , but i be genuinely surprise at the lace leave behind .<ssssss>give it a fresh look at least .<ssssss>no smell to speak of , and the little bit i catch be not pleasant .<ssssss>not as viscous as it look , but i will say there be more malt than i thought -lrb- 5 % be higher than 0 % -rrb- a little more taste than i expect with its pallid appearance .<ssssss>the little bit i get be not unbearable , and be a step or two above the taste .<ssssss>otherwise watery and carbonate like spark water .<ssssss>fitting beer to wash down hot wing , enter a drinking contest , or if you be on skid row and be allergic to grape .<ssssss>.<ssssss>
7 5 7 7 7		serve in a pint glass , the beer pour a golden orange color with about a half inch frothy white head .<ssssss>it smell like sweet malt and grain , and that be it .<ssssss>the aroma be not strong at all .<ssssss>the taste be sweet .<ssssss>it taste like sweet malt , caramel , grain , and it also have a bit of a fruity taste to it -lrb- i can not really tell exactly what fruit -rrb- .<ssssss>i can not taste any hop at all .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be light/medium .<ssssss>drinkability be ok .<ssssss>i would drink it again , but it be just a average beer imo .<ssssss>
6 6 9 8 8		aroma be fairly muted , but it be a lager , so i can not totally be dissapoint .<ssssss>upon further and more indepth aroma imspection you find some dark caramels/burnt sugar with some underlying alcohol note .<ssssss>the ladder be only detectable once you allow it to warm .<ssssss>the taste be simple yet extemely delicious .<ssssss>typical lager lighter body and mouthfeel but the dark wheat and caramel and bready flavor be delicious .<ssssss>definitely one of the best bocks/lagers of any kind i have sample .<ssssss>overall this be a great beer that i be glad i sample as part of a 4 beer sampler .<ssssss>the price for this in the bottle be probably in the teens and outrageous so in smaller qualtity , it can be enjoy a appreciate .<ssssss>
6 6 6 8 7		this be not a hefeweisen .<ssssss>it be more like a light farmhouse ale , full of coriander and banana flavor .<ssssss>it be a very nice beer , and if you be expect a light belgian ale , you will be please .<ssssss>i actually enjoy th beer the best of the sampler i have there a couple of week ago , but if i have my mouth set for a german style hefe , i probably would have be a little annoyed .<ssssss>trailhead have a lineup of very nice , amiable , beer - but they do need to get they beer style straight .<ssssss>
6 3 5 3 6		a - reddish black body , let very little light through .<ssssss>have a tan/dark creme color head that dissipate to a film quickly even after a rather aggressive pour , and leave minimal lacing n-faint ; that would be the word .<ssssss>roasted malt , a bit of caramel , and not too much else .<ssssss>not only that , but it take all the breath i could pull in through my nostril to pick up on any of that .<ssssss>rather lack in aroma .<ssssss>t - honey completely dominate the whole taste of it like what mike tyson would do to a fly-weight .<ssssss>again , there be a weak hint of caramel , but really honey take the bitch over .<ssssss>and last i check honey be not really mean to be that strong in a stout m - lightly crisp at first , but give way to a almost sour malty finish .<ssssss>do not get I wrong , sour beer be wonderful , but not when i be expect a stout .<ssssss>d - it can be chug quickly , which may be the only saving grace of this otherwise atrocious stout .<ssssss>this be a thorough disappointment from a brewery that i have hear such great thing about .<ssssss>i be not do with they though , as i head to christchurch tomorrow , i be sure this be a weak-link and there will be something there that be phenomenal .<ssssss>they reputation be too good for this to be a main example of they product .<ssssss>
5 5 7 6 4		a dead ringer for cherry 7-up .<ssssss>smell of cherry grenadine mix with sweet corn .<ssssss>light and fruity .<ssssss>corn forward with some light raspberry .<ssssss>not bad if it be a hot day and you have celiac disease , if you gi situation be healthy there be better raspberry wheat option .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 7		receive this brew via growler from tastetester in a recent trade .<ssssss>i have really be excite to try this thing and be not disappointed -lrb- drink all but the glass in front of I yesterday with a buddy -rrb- .<ssssss>drink from my surly nonic pint glass .<ssssss>appearance - pour a ugly ass dark murky yellowish brown with a almost greenish tint at certain angle -lrb- at least to I -rrb- .<ssssss>it be such a weird color it be get a extra half point in appearance .<ssssss>very little off-white head form that quickly dissipate leave a small cap and thin collar with no lacing .<ssssss>smell - definite banana 's upfront and not the yeasty kind -lrb- hef -rrb- .<ssssss>this smell just like the real thing .<ssssss>some chocolate cut the banana with a raw baker chocolate aspect .<ssssss>doughy and malty at time but this be pretty much just banana and chocolate .<ssssss>taste - wow , after the nose i be expect a big banana kick but the chocolate take center stage here .<ssssss>like the nose it be a raw bitter chocolate and in the least bit sweet .<ssssss>the banana be very light and a bit more apparent toward the finish .<ssssss>soft and doughy the brew be lightly bitter but i do not detect any hop .<ssssss>i be assume all the bitterness be from the cocoa .<ssssss>mouthfeel - super rich and creamy with nice dry finish and really low carbonation .<ssssss>drinkability - this be definitely a unique brew that do not taste anything like i be expect .<ssssss>i would have like all the banana in the nose translate a bit more to the taste .<ssssss>the chocolate be the focus of this beer but uniquely so .<ssssss>i could not have finish the entire growler but i do enjoy the hell out of my couple glass .<ssssss>
8 6 8 6 9		nice amber/brown color , with a good off-white head .<ssssss>head stick around pretty well .<ssssss>smell be ok , slightly malty , a little bit of spicy hop .<ssssss>very smooth , malty and nutty .<ssssss>can not get excite about it , but very drinkable and quaffable .<ssssss>can not go wrong , and a great session brew .<ssssss>
4 6 4 6 4		pour from 11.2 ounce bottle with a best by 2012 on the label , into a chimay goblet .<ssssss>the beer begin to gush and foam over about opening and i could see the yeast and sediment shooting off the bottom as if it be a lava lamp .<ssssss>the beer pour deep reddish brown with chunk of sludge out of the bottle that you could actually feel as they plop out into the glass .<ssssss>the appearance be murky and uninviting with a very poor head .<ssssss>smell be sweet , slightly fruity , some flower like note .<ssssss>the taste be sweet , slightly woody , earthy and lightly sour .<ssssss>the texture be just awful and the mouthfeel be slick , oily and carbonate like a soda with pop fizz .<ssssss>this beer be awful .<ssssss>base on the overall rating on ba my guess be that it be a hit and miss of get a stable bottle , but i be not play russian roulette at $ 6 a pop .<ssssss>i will stick with rochefort , chimay and westmalle among some other top belgian .<ssssss>the brewery and the importer should be send refund out for they unstable product .<ssssss>
9 6 7 8 9		im liking mexican beer less and less but this be definetly a good beer .<ssssss>not as full flavor as id like in a beer but i feel thats kind of a trend in mexican beer .<ssssss>one of the thing i like best about it be how smooth it be .<ssssss>go down very easily and finish fairly clean .<ssssss>again im not liking mexican beer as much as i use to but as far as mexican beer this be one i feel be of better quality and i find myself com back to often , when drink mexican beer .<ssssss>
6 4 6 7 4		chill in the fridge for about a hour and pour into a oversized dogfish snifter .<ssssss>pour bright orange with some very fine white bubble that cover the top minimally .<ssssss>fine particle disperse through the beer .<ssssss>herbal aroma , not sure exactly what , but kind of perfumy .<ssssss>some honey , chile , corn , and a bit of a cardboard aroma -lrb- weird , i know -rrb- .<ssssss>aroma be not come off to pleasant to I right now .<ssssss>flavor start with a honey sweetness , then move into a bit of a chili bite .<ssssss>light caramel flavor and some spice precede a finish of cocoa and cereal grain .<ssssss>mouthfeel be pretty thin with a fairly high level of carbonation .<ssssss>the unconventional flavor in this beer and the high alcohol content do not make this very drinkable for I .<ssssss>this beer be , let just say , different .<ssssss>the aroma be very strange to I .<ssssss>i be not sure if it be the spicing , or the chily , but i do not find it very appealing .<ssssss>the flavor be much better than the aroma , but it be overly sweet , like many of the dogfish beer .<ssssss>the aftertaste do have a very pleasant , grainy , almost cream ale flavor to it .<ssssss>i be glad i try it , but i will not be buy it again if it make a return .<ssssss>
6 9 5 5 6		sheesh , what a let down .<ssssss>pour with a kind of a sudsy off white head and a little lace .<ssssss>color be medium amber .<ssssss>aroma be really good and wayyy better than the flavor and body .<ssssss>flavor be shallow and body be even more shallow .<ssssss>slightly above water .<ssssss>finish be simple and forgettable , just a little malty , sweet and belgian beerish a that it .<ssssss>yawn .<ssssss>

8 7 7 9 8		pour black with creamy tan head .<ssssss>retention not all that great .<ssssss>look a bit thin .<ssssss>hop on top of the aroma .<ssssss>.<ssssss>surprisingly i think .<ssssss>in addition to the hop , the nose be of roasted malt , rub alcohol , burnt caramel , or caramelize sugar .<ssssss>kinda reminiscent of the place where the korean people put on my wife 's fake nail .<ssssss>taste nice ... roasted and toast something !<ssssss>-lrb- how 's that for elloquent ? -rrb-<ssssss>bitter strong coffee , a good french roast with just the right amount of sugar and cream , alcohol not too prevailant .<ssssss>mouthfeel be somewhat oily , but maybe a bit too thin for my liking .<ssssss>overall decent brew that i will for sure try again .<ssssss>

4 6 8 7 7		look like the standard lite beer , light yellow , some linger lace .<ssssss>head disappear after a minute or two , and the taste be pretty straightforward , relatively sweet .<ssssss>i think in term of lite beer this be definitely one of the best for price vs. value - way better taste than bud light , but not exactly up there with sam adam light or anything .<ssssss>if you bash it before , do a blind taste test among a few lite beer and see where you rank it , i guarantee it be near the top .<ssssss>

9 6 7 8 8		12 oz .<ssssss>bottle with a old map as the label .<ssssss>i not sure what it be a map of , but there be a sea dragon in the middle , a tall ship at the bottom , and two skull and crossbones flag .<ssssss>on top of this map in bright big red letter be the name of the beer and they symbol at the bottom of the map .<ssssss>to the right be the government warning and to the left be the ingredient , refund value , and two line of number .<ssssss>the first one be 1-6 and the second one be 1-12 .<ssssss>i guess that this be suppose to be the best before date , but nothing be notch .<ssssss>appearance : i decide to pour this seattle bear beer into a stoudt 's pint glass .<ssssss>this ipa pour a bright and hazy golden lemon yellow .<ssssss>the reason why it be so hazy be because of all the hop particle float around in this beer .<ssssss>sit on top of the golden brew be a small less than a 1/4 of a inch head of pure white foam .<ssssss>even though the head be small , it never really recede away .<ssssss>it stay the same size the entire time this beer be in my glass .<ssssss>whenever the beer go down , the head of foam leave behind small streak and spot of lace .<ssssss>if you could not have guess already .<ssssss>i love the appearance of this ipa .<ssssss>it be very well do !<ssssss>smell : you would think that a beer with the word `` imperial '' in the title would have a nice strong aroma .<ssssss>this one have to be different .<ssssss>the aroma to this ipa be far too mild .<ssssss>i swirl it around and around to wake up the aroma , but it be no avail .<ssssss>all i get come off of this beer be a splash of lemon peel , a hint of grapefruit , a few blade of grass , and a spatter of citrus hop .<ssssss>yeah , it have a few of the type of aroma that you would find in a pale ale , but they be lack the kick that they need .<ssssss>taste : now this be more like it !<ssssss>now the beer come out to play after the weak aroma .<ssssss>the taste kick off with a subtle taste of caramel malt and then it go directly into the hop .<ssssss>the hop strength be not quite as high as a double ipa , but they be get there .<ssssss>so , after the caramel malt leave , the taste then go hoppy with bitter citrus hop , a splash of lemon zest , a touch of tart grapefruit , and a subtle hint of pine needle at the end .<ssssss>the malt probably could have help to balance out this beer a little more , but i know that you can not have everything .<ssssss>mouthfeel : i think that this `` imperial '' ale be more medium body than full body .<ssssss>i also notice that this beer have plenty of carbonation and feature a slightly hoppy aftertaste of bitter citrus hop , a splash of lemon peel , and a hint of grapefruit .<ssssss>even though the aftertaste be hoppy , it do not bother to stick around like some hoppy aftertaste do .<ssssss>it last for about 10 seconds and then it be go forever .<ssssss>drinkability : if you like you ipa with just a tab bit lower hop content than one of you hardcore double ipa , then this beer be up you alley .<ssssss>foe I , i enjoy it .<ssssss>well , everything except for the weak and mild aroma .<ssssss>everything else be great .<ssssss>in the end , i would like to thank donny2120 for give I the chance to try this seattle bear beer .<ssssss>thanks again man !<ssssss>

8 4 8 4 4		order a pint at little ortino 's .<ssssss>at first i be a fan of this little golden beer/bragot .<ssssss>the floral and earthy honey note be delicious .<ssssss>but as it warm , overpower medicinal clove flavor and aroma hijack the beer and i end up not finish it .<ssssss>after a while , it basically taste like robitussin .<ssssss>what a shame .<ssssss>maybe this sit out in a hot distributor too long and brooklyn 's beer do not usually have flaw like this , but i would ask for a taste before order this to be safe .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 10		pour from a 22oz bottle into a sam adam imperial series glass .<ssssss>the color be a dark amber red with very little head .<ssssss>it be get a very distinct and hoppy smell to it , warm I up with every sniff .<ssssss>the taste be of caramelize hop and sweet sugar swirl around , it leave the mouth dry with a bitter aftertaste .<ssssss>the presence of the alcohol remind you its there after every sip ... not a bad thing .<ssssss>definitely a classy beer , but then lagunita never really miss .<ssssss>
8 10 10 9 7		pour opaque black with a medium/small tan head that dissipate quickly .<ssssss>smell strongly just like milk chocolate with a bit of roasted malt - very unique and nice .<ssssss>roasted malt flavor with a lot of chocolate , obvious and pleasant but not overpower .<ssssss>some hop be noticable in the finish and the beer finish with a linger roasted malt bitterness .<ssssss>surprisingly this be pretty balanced .<ssssss>mouthfeel be excellent - thick and creamy .<ssssss>delicious but the heaviness and chocolate flavor do take a bit away from the drinkability of this brew .<ssssss>awesome overall .<ssssss>
10 5 6 2 5		look : orange/copper in color with a great 1 inch off white head and great retention and some sticky lacing smell : the amarillo hop give it a bit of a skunky note with trace of pine in the background taste : the flavor honestly be not very good .<ssssss>it have a bit of a metallic flavor back up by a medicinal qualty not very good at all and as the beer warm you get some grassy or straw like note that remind I of be at a fair around farm animal just awful .<ssssss>mouthfeel : medium body and medium carbonation and slightly dry overall : honestly besides the look of the beer this be not good about this beer whatsoever<ssssss>
5 8 5 6 5		i be not a fan of wheat beer , but these spicier witbier be more interesting to I .<ssssss>i have never see a imperial white before , and now i know why .<ssssss>it be a cloudy beer with a spicy nose , but each sip establish a expectation that i never taste .<ssssss>i expect this beer to round off and finish with coriander , clove , and citrus .<ssssss>instead , each sip finish boozy and stunt my taste of the beer 's spice .<ssssss>i try drink each bottle differently - open and pour immediately , open and leave sit to air out a while , cooler , warmer , etc .<ssssss>- but each time the booze dominate the scene .<ssssss>normally higher abv brew do not bother I -lrb- i would rather a ris over a stout -rrb- , but here i would rather have a witbier over this imperial one .<ssssss>maybe let this cellar a few month and see whether the booze figure out how to live with the spice ?<ssssss>
8 8 7 9 7		sample february 2006 pour with a frothy , large bubble , half-finger thick brown color head .<ssssss>the beer be a deep black , opaque color .<ssssss>the aroma smell quite dry , a bit acidic , with a hint of plum-like fruitiness towards the end .<ssssss>aromatic note of dark roasted coffee bean intermingle with a hint of sherry and a underlying , rich malty note that remind I of dark chocolate .<ssssss>there seem to be a bit of mustiness here as well , but just a touch and it seem to mix into the fruitiness somehow .<ssssss>the beer have a certain fullness to it as it hit my mouth , yet at the same time it be light and a tad thin around the edge -lrb- some sign of it be age -rrb- .<ssssss>there be a chocolate-like sweet note here , especially in the middle and towards the end of a draught of this beer .<ssssss>up front a bit of acidity accentuate a solid fruit character that make I think most of sweet , aromatic plum .<ssssss>the finish have a note of dry , roasted character , which intermingle with the sweet malty note , and , in fact , be ultimately subservient to the sweet , chalky malt note in the long finish .<ssssss>this beer be still quite nice , what age be here mostly add to the complexity .<ssssss>some oxidation have increase / enhance the fruit character , and certainly make up for the thin of the palate around the edge .<ssssss>there be also a certain sherry-like or even port-like quality here , which again add to the complexity .<ssssss>this have definitely hold up pretty darn well .<ssssss>

7 5 7 7 7		12 oz .<ssssss>bottle buy at towson wine & liquor pour a deep orange , yet the body have striking clarity .<ssssss>a moderate pour yield a thin layer of off-white head that gradually die down .<ssssss>some pumpkin and spice note come through on the aroma , but they be muddle and nearly block out by a sweet graininess .<ssssss>taste be actually much better than the smell have I expect ; allspice come through upfront , follow by a sweet pumpkin flavor midway and a nutmeg presence on the finish .<ssssss>as the beer warm more of the graininess come through , but for the most part this be not that bad .<ssssss>mouthfeel be relatively smooth ; this be a little more light-bodied than i would expect a pumpkin ale to be , but i would not go so far as to call it watery .<ssssss>this be a decently drinkable beer ; one be probably enough for I , but it go down pretty smoothly .<ssssss>i use to like this beer a lot when i be first get into craft , and i think a lot of that have to do with drinking out of the bottle and in turn avoid the rather unpleasant smell of this beer .<ssssss>anyway , harvest moon be not exactly earth-shattering , but it be not a bad option as far as cheap seasonal go .<ssssss>

9 6 8 9 9		i buy this in rhode island at wakefield liquor .<ssssss>this pour to a thick golden/copper .<ssssss>after read the bottle i be excite to try this beer .<ssssss>as be widely know , the use of hop be almost non-existent in earlier scottish beer .<ssssss>also , of course , with a name like skullsplitter you have to wonder about the strength ... and it be a wee heavy ; just a super explosion of taste on the first sip ... flavor of malt and scotch whiskey and some toast caramel , all mix together with a long alcohol laden finish that really stop the flavor abruptly .<ssssss>this make you want to take another sip .<ssssss>all the great flavor emerge and separate as the glass warm .<ssssss>there be no shortage of a reminder that this have a high alcohol content , but it really do provide warmth during snow shoveling season .<ssssss>i cant see have many more than two of these , but that kind of obvious .<ssssss>

8 8 8 10 9		pour a very dark ruby color , almost black , with a nice dark tan head .<ssssss>smell be char , charcoal like , very burnt , but yet very chocolatey at the same time .<ssssss>taste be sweet caramel malt , back up by a abundance of chocolate , and a slight biterness and earthy hop flavor .<ssssss>smooth in the mouth and very drinkable , a top notch porter , one that should be admire by all .<ssssss>

'<ssssss>, which kinda get I excited about what be to come .<ssssss>into the glass it go and i wonder where my aroma go ; hardly a trace of fruit -lrb- any variety -rrb- .<ssssss>mostly a bland yeastiness that be not awful - but without any blueberry smell , why am i drink a fruit beer name after they ?<ssssss>t : flavor offer up a glimmer of fruit amidst -lrb- once again -rrb- dominant doughy/yeasty malt .<ssssss>there may be ` natural blueberry flavor ' -lrb- per the label -rrb- , but frankly i be not find much of it .<ssssss>hardly hop in any substantial way , which mean i be leave with a boring , weakly-flavored ` something ' .<ssssss>a disappointment , i suppose .<ssssss>m : crisp to start , but then a ` macro ' / adjunct grainy grit that stick like glue on the tongue .<ssssss>slick and viscous coating , light-medium body .<ssssss>meh .<ssssss>d : refreshing and light , two plus for drinkability , but then a whole slew of negative , from aroma to flavor to texture .<ssssss>i love try new and interesting beer creation , but this just be not for I .<ssssss>yes , i be warn this be not he favorite by the kind-hearted sender , but i ask and receive ... i do finish the bottle , which be say something .<ssssss>thanks again , charlie , and thanks also for the ` larry ' bottle - a second opportunity to try something from this brewery .<ssssss>

9 10 9 8 9		pour from a 12oz bottle ... a - pour a golden amber color , but also still appear to show some darker tan color as well .<ssssss>1 and a half finger dark cream color head that leave amazing lace around the whole glass .<ssssss>s - hop lover dream .<ssssss>heavy pine and floral note .<ssssss>citrusy , but all scent work together and do not overwhelm .<ssssss>t - the hop and malt compliment one another here .<ssssss>spicy hop flavor be immediate with a slight sweetness from the malt .<ssssss>leave a slight bitter finish that be rather nice .<ssssss>well balanced beer here for the hop lover .<ssssss>a very slight alcohol burn be notice after the finish , but that should be expect at 7.5 % abv .<ssssss>m - clean and crisp .<ssssss>enough say .<ssssss>but really , this beer drink very clean and smooth .<ssssss>almost feel like a lighter body beer , but be more towards a medium weight .<ssssss>d - this beer be very drinkable .<ssssss>not too strong , not too light .<ssssss>i can find myself reach for this one more and more .<ssssss>cheer !<ssssss>

8 8 4 8 8		this beer be smooth and easy to drink , but not very substantial despite its full and cramy head .<ssssss>i expect something a bit heavier .<ssssss>at lunch , i pair this beer with a lentil soup and blue cheese salad .<ssssss>the combination go will together .<ssssss>i look forward to try other beer in this category to compare this against .<ssssss>

5 3 4 3 6		i be a fan of jame rolfe 's angry video game nerd who frequently use this beer as a prop so i decide to give this beer a chance .<ssssss>i be not to terribly impressed .<ssssss>appearance : the bottle be green and the contents be definitely pale as the liquid barely give a slight golden tint to the glass .<ssssss>smell : the beer be relatively odorless besides some faint skunk .<ssssss>taste : here be the beer 's real weakness , after take a sip i have to admit that i do not taste much of anything .<ssssss>i realize that be a trademark of adjunct lager but still upon initial contact with my mouth there be some very slight malt and then as i roll it around my mouth i taste nothing , no malt , no hop , nothing .<ssssss>mouthfeel : go down like water .<ssssss>this be the part of beer that i take the least amount of consideration in and the wateriness just remind I of how much i do not like this beer .<ssssss>drinkability : go down easy enough and have a abv under 5 % so one could drink it all night .<ssssss>but why ?<ssssss>i personally would pour it out .<ssssss>
6 7 5 3 4		i will be honest , this be the first of a short series of pumpkin beer i recently try and i would never have this style before .<ssssss>it turn out it be not my thing .<ssssss>start ok with a nice 1.25 '' head which eventually dissipate to next to nothing .<ssssss>and bouquet have that slight pumpkin pie smell .<ssssss>and though i suspect it be go to be sweet it be not , they do not simply replicate pumpkin pie .<ssssss>but here be the thing , the spice pretty much overwhelm any real flavor of beer .<ssssss>i mean they could put the same thing in a glass of iced tea and get pretty much this flavor .<ssssss>maybe this be a great example of pumpkin beer do right , i do not know , but it be not a great example of beer .<ssssss>

6 6 5 4 6		a : hazy copper color .<ssssss>s : good berry smell and malt .<ssssss>t : it be ok .<ssssss>i find it a little sweet for my taste and the berry be a little too much .<ssssss>m : crisp bubbly and med .<ssssss>light body d : good on a hot day i bet .<ssssss>i would sever this brew with a chicken dish .<ssssss>.<ssssss>yah a spicy chicken dish !<ssssss>no not really i will ` nt be buy this one again .<ssssss>you try it you might like it .<ssssss>-lrb- i do not -rrb-<ssssss>

7 5 7 7 7		pour a clear , dark golden yellow with a medium head .<ssssss>a occasional piece of sediment can be see float around .<ssssss>aroma be too weak to pick anything unique up .<ssssss>flavor consist of a crisp caramel base .<ssssss>then some grapefruit tartness kick in the middle and the aftertaste be a slightly harsh bitterness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be be overly carbonated , but add a somewhat please crispness to it .<ssssss>this be somewhat drinkable , but the harsh aftertaste could slow this down .<ssssss>i have mix feeling about this beer .<ssssss>on one hand , the harshness and bitterness detract from the beer .<ssssss>on the other hand , that be what keep it from be boring .<ssssss>i think testing this single bottle be not do it justice .<ssssss>i bet have quite a few at the pub after work would really put anyone 's trouble to rest .<ssssss>as a ipa , i would say the hop kick in earlier than typical ipa 's , and the long piny bitterness be not in this beer .<ssssss>
8 9 4 8 8		pour a golden hue that remind I of wheat but be a bit more amber-toned .<ssssss>almost a figer of frothy , bubbly , uneven head , which do not seem huge for a saison , but look very nice .<ssssss>very hazy , with small carbonation bubble mingle around the glass and larger one streaming in a variety of size and at a variety of speed to the top of the glass .<ssssss>very strong smell -- a bit like bell 's hopslam , oddly , with only a few herbal saison note that i be pick out .<ssssss>pleasant enough .<ssssss>smell like it will get a lot funkier as it warm , and be pretty nice .<ssssss>taste good , love what they do with the style/creativity .<ssssss>mouthfeel be absolutely awful and inconsistent .<ssssss>drink smoothly on a nice spring-like day .<ssssss>
8 7 6 7 10		not too cold for this one , 50f/10c be good .<ssssss>it do not need a goblet , pint glass be fine .<ssssss>pour a medium -lrb- for a stout -rrb- brown with a head light enough to pass for a english brown .<ssssss>like a lot of stout the smell be not very appparent unless warm up , but be decently solid .<ssssss>dark malt , a little hop , coffee , and i can definitely see what some other reviewer have term burnt sugar .<ssssss>nothing in-your-face .<ssssss>the taste be good , but like the smell a bit reserved perhaps ?<ssssss>the flavor at first do not really provide anything that be not present in the smell , but the direct aftertaste reveal that there actually be oatmeal present ; i would bet they do not use a whole lot of it .<ssssss>very smoothly do and balance though , no rough edge .<ssssss>mouthfeel be unremarkable .<ssssss>carbonation around average , body a bit thin for a oatmeal stout .<ssssss>vaguely sticky , like a sweet lager -lrb- bock-like ? -rrb-<ssssss>might be , but not overly so .<ssssss>despite , or perhaps because of , the lack of unremarkable standup feature , this score top rank in drinkability .<ssssss>go down smooth and leave I want more .<ssssss>i would indeed like another one .<ssssss>final thought : more dark-kilned malt stout than oatmeal .<ssssss>that be say , a well-made beer that be fun to drink and go great with a cold night and something on tv .<ssssss>
7 3 8 4 6		ginger ale be darker than this beer .<ssssss>this almost pour the color of water : smell be sweet with a twinge of vomity bile balance the sweetness .<ssssss>taste be grassy and clean if you focus real hard and you close you eye and cross you finger you can taste some mild hop in the background all noble hop for sure .<ssssss>aftertaste be wheat sweet and corn .<ssssss>dm ?<ssssss>mouthfeel be clean and un-hindering .<ssssss>drinkable for those who drink it ; mine , however , get throw out my bedroom window because it wasnt worth the trip the the bathroom sink .<ssssss>
7 9 8 7 7		thanks to dave -lrb- dschuster03 -rrb- for pick up a growler of this brew on he way to chicago .<ssssss>serve in a russian river tulip .<ssssss>a - quick-dissolving white foam settle to a thin ring , some wisp on top , and no lacework .<ssssss>transparent dark golden body .<ssssss>s - immense tangerine mingle with citrus hop .<ssssss>i love tangerine , and this be pretty hard to beat in that department .<ssssss>the only knock be a surprising alcohol note that seem out-of-place for a 6 % ipa .<ssssss>t - unfortunately the taste be not quite as good .<ssssss>there be plenty of tangerine , but there be a odd astringency in the finish .<ssssss>it be hop-forward , with minimal malt backing , but somehow come off as muted .<ssssss>m - medium body , lower carbonation , and a super dry texture with plenty of residual hop oils in the finish .<ssssss>d - the aroma be great , but the rest of the package be somewhat middling .<ssssss>if they could tweak the recipe to give the flavor a little more oomph this could be a real winner .<ssssss>however , at this stage i would rather just smell the aroma than actually drink the beer .<ssssss>
8 8 5 6 7		light caramel color pour , good clarity , good head .<ssssss>best by sep something 11 date .<ssssss>nice hoppy aroma , not pick out the specific hop variety , but whatever the meld , it be enjoyable and even keel to not be able to say it lean pine or citrus wise .<ssssss>taste , start off good , carbonation , hop , mild sweet caramel malt , average bitterness .<ssssss>swallow .<ssssss>wait for it , ugh , what be that aftertaste in this ?<ssssss>slightly off flavor .<ssssss>not horrible , just not pleasant like everything else about the beer .<ssssss>its fresh , it still have 3 more month on it before the best by date , and the hop be there .<ssssss>the only possible descriptor that come up be like , you know those biscuit that come in the pressurized metal container that pop open when you depress a spoon on they ?<ssssss>this have a like , stale , metallic bitter , biscuit aftertaste really ruin a otherwise pleasurable beer .<ssssss>
5 9 6 7 8		i will preface this by say i be stupid and do not check the freshness date on the bottle before i pick this up the other day , and it be best before 11/29/10 , which be a shame .<ssssss>i think it definitely detract from the overall enjoyment of drinking this beer , but i arrange my review bearing in mind how this beer should have come out .<ssssss>a . -rrb-<ssssss>this be a kind of deep brownish orange , color , reeaallllyyy hazy with almost no head .<ssssss>the color and body be actually pretty close to a apple cider .<ssssss>s. -rrb- awesome !<ssssss>lot of grassy hop and a nice spice from the rye .<ssssss>deep citrus and pine and everything a beer like this should be .<ssssss>if anything , this smell more like a rye ipa or something , actually .<ssssss>t. -rrb- unfortunately this do not live up to quite the same level of awesome as the smell do .<ssssss>the taste be there , but it be slightly mute .<ssssss>this could be due to the fact that it be a slightly older bottle , however , so i be take this with a grain of salt .<ssssss>m. -rrb- this fall slightly flat for I and could use more carbonation , but again , i be bear in mind that this be not necessarily a fresh bottle .<ssssss>i will bear this in mind throughout my review .<ssssss>d. -rrb- nice balanced beer with a mid-range abv make this a great beer for summer , fall or spring .<ssssss>really refresh with a clean finish .<ssssss>

9 8 10 9 8		a - black as night and not let any light through even when hold up to a lamp .<ssssss>one finger chocolate brown head with decent retention .<ssssss>little lacing but i dont expect much at damn near 10 % .<ssssss>s - aroma of roasted chocolate maltiness .<ssssss>hint of alcohol as well .<ssssss>somewhat faint aroma .<ssssss>t - a hint of sweetness up front before the roasted malty chocolatness come through in a big way .<ssssss>just a hint of bitterness to provide a excellent balance .<ssssss>m/d - full body and incredibly smooth .<ssssss>very good oatmeal stout .<ssssss>very big beer which make this a sipper , but damn tasty .<ssssss>
8 9 8 7 9		bottle purchase from west lakeview liquor .<ssssss>serve in a night of the living ale taster pint glass .<ssssss>a - ridiculous foam that quickly sizzle to a thin ring and partial cap .<ssssss>the body look like hazy lemonade .<ssssss>s - slightly rotten stone fruit , sweat , funky , pineapple , lactic sourness , yogurty .<ssssss>smell a lot like you would expect from a berliner with brett - quite potent .<ssssss>t - taste be a lot less complex unfortunately .<ssssss>mostly lemon and lactic acidity , with plenty of yeast character .<ssssss>it be refreshing , but just somewhat bland compare to the aroma .<ssssss>m - extremely zesty carbonation , light-bodied .<ssssss>lightly yeasty , dry finish .<ssssss>very refreshing .<ssssss>d - i could drink a lot of this .<ssssss>i just wish it taste a little more like it smell , as there be a pronounced drop-off in complexity and intensity .<ssssss>
9 9 10 8 10		beautiful cloudy orange golden color brew sit below a massive head of white foam that hold up pretty well .<ssssss>the aroma have a nice backround of sweet fruit and citrus with a clove and banana combo to really make it a nice whiffer .<ssssss>it just get better as i swirl the bottom and dump in the rest of the yeast .<ssssss>the carbonation be nice and tingly , not overdo in the least .<ssssss>mouthfeel become creamy and smooth after the bubbly start .<ssssss>banana be huge in the flavor as well as grain and touch of fruit , sweet and citric .<ssssss>it be very refreshing , and this nice sunny day provide a near perfect atmosphere .<ssssss>complex and enjoyable to the very last sip .<ssssss>this may just be my favorite german weiss to date .<ssssss>

8 8 9 7 9		500ml bottle a - deep dark orange , very dark for the style , with generous head and decent retention s - yeast be of course there while clove and banana give a sweet and at the same time spicy feel .<ssssss>the overall aroma be surprisingly spicy but feel very nice , maybe there be some help from the ester t - very sweet .<ssssss>the dominant character be , suprsingly , not bread but spiciness ; a very pleasant and delicate spiciness , with strong hint of clove and a phenolic character .<ssssss>then you can feel some fruity note -lrb- banana of course but also citrus -rrb- and some herbal hop freshness on the tongue , that bring balance and add some complexity .<ssssss>very good but a bit too much on the sweet side to be able to bring a full range of flavour m - incredibly smooth , moderate carbonation and hence gentle on the palate without feel too light , even because you can also feel some crispness on the tongue .<ssssss>a perfectly balanced beer d - refreshing , highly drinkable , enough complex : all you could ask for in a weizen<ssssss>
7 4 8 7 7		serve on tap in a weizen glass .<ssssss>appearance : deep amber with a tinge of redness with a finger width of white head that quickly dissolve .<ssssss>not too much lacing .<ssssss>not a beer i would notice from across the room , but a pretty good look brew .<ssssss>smell : i do not get too much besides hop and malt , the dominant flavor in this beverage .<ssssss>at least its not hide anything .<ssssss>i be expect more give the appearance , and keep search around for different aroma , but to no avail .<ssssss>taste : a balanced level of malt combine with enough hop to give the beer some character , and a nice amount of bitterness .<ssssss>a tiny bit sweet at the beginning , a bit bitter toward the end .<ssssss>nothing at all distasteful , but again nothing special with this one .<ssssss>mouthfeel : uncommonly smooth and perfectly carbonated .<ssssss>although a little thin , a pretty standout example for a lager .<ssssss>drinkability : a decent session beer .<ssssss>i would drink another , but would also look for a beer with flavor other than just malt and hop .<ssssss>summary : a well-crafted , smooth , and great-looking brew .<ssssss>although by no means offensive in taste , its good look belie its simplicity in flavor .<ssssss>nothing special , but at the same time good at what it do .<ssssss>
4 6 6 4 6		look promising enough , except that the only thing mississippus about it be the name .<ssssss>utica ny ?<ssssss>pour a nice foamy head then quickly die to thin thin lace .<ssssss>aroma be malty and chocolate .<ssssss>taste be roasted malt some sweetness .<ssssss>some weird aftertaste that be not pleasant .<ssssss>not recommend .<ssssss>

7 5 6 8 6		this beer have be star I down at the local grocery store for awhile now so i want to give it a try .<ssssss>i drink it straight out of the bottle but it still appear very good darker than most light beer but that no big deal .<ssssss>i do not like the smell of this beer do not know if it be that it be in the bottle but it just do not have the greate smell to it .<ssssss>the taste be very good , hard to place the flavor but i like it .<ssssss>it feel good in the mouth not very bitter , and very little aftertaste it be only average drinkability , even be only 99 calorie it still feel heavier than a light beer , this be a good beer but its not something i could tailgate with , its more of a have a few get ta drive home later type beer , make I feel fuller than normal light beer .<ssssss>overall a good beer that should be pick up .<ssssss>
9 8 10 8 9		750 ml bottle pour into chalice a : foamy , pure white head , settle to a thin but substantial head , still cling to side , almost totally opaque , like a light sunburst butterscotch color s : yeast provide most aroma here , pretty clean though , definite spiciness too , sweet and acidic and the same time , not citrusy though t : start with that same semi-acidic fruit like sweetness - but never actually get sweet , more acidity , then turn to a good malt presence , not super powerful , but definite light malt , sometimes finish a little bitter too m : that tartness impart a definite dry feel , but remain light , just kind of melt out of you mouth d : good , not a session beer , but it be refreshing and good feeling note : i have long regard this beer very highly .<ssssss>while it be not the `` super beer '' that i remember it be the first time i ever try it -lrb- because it be one of my first craft beer -rrb- , i would definitely say it be a extremely superior beer .<ssssss>it have great flavor and be just so refreshing and easy to drink .<ssssss>

8 8 5 8 8		a - jet black , can see red on side ; 2 finger of tan head .<ssssss>s - at first you get strong coffee then some dark fruit ; the alcohol come through quite a bit , smell like rum .<ssssss>t - coffee up front with some tobacco , bittersweet ; you really taste the alcohol , its rum like the smell .<ssssss>the rum flavor really blend well with the other flavor to make a pretty good stout .<ssssss>m - leave a grainy feeling in my mouth and there be not enough carbonation .<ssssss>d - pretty good for the abv and how much you taste the alcohol , go down easy .<ssssss>
7 10 8 7 7		i drink this from a 12oz bottle into my orval glass .<ssssss>the beer be dark watery brownw with a two finger light tan head that fade way to fast .<ssssss>the aroma be strong and super flavorful .<ssssss>sweet malt of wonderful caramel , dark fruit and a hint of hop and alcohol on the finish .<ssssss>the taste be pretty good , start off sweet caramel but then you be hit with ton of alcohol , not mask very well .<ssssss>nice hoppy finish .<ssssss>the feel be kinda light , not totally drinkable with the alcohol .<ssssss>overall , this be the best smell bw i have have .<ssssss>if they could lose the alcohol in the taste that would be a top 100 .<ssssss>
6 6 3 2 3		this summer brew miss its mark big time .<ssssss>i be hesitant to buy it because the octoberfest of 2004 be so bitter and undrinkable and the middlebury be the same .<ssssss>i think ottercreek be move too much towards overhopp they beer .<ssssss>i drink a six with my buddy from florida and i know what i think instantly but he say it first .<ssssss>`` i think summer beer should be refreshing and light '' this summer ale be bitter and not please to the mouth .<ssssss>i think sam adam and magic hat be the best ne brewery who understand that beer be suppose to taste good when you friend come over .<ssssss>the last great brew from ottercreek be octoberfest 2003 which be spectacular .<ssssss>
7 3 6 4 4		750 ml corked bottle - fairly difficult to get the damn cork out .<ssssss>a : a pretty bottle with lot of sediment on the bottom - neat !<ssssss>pour a cloudy medium amber color with a decent head .<ssssss>s : phew !<ssssss>weird !<ssssss>my immediate impession be macro lager , oddly enough .<ssssss>sort of a sour , off smell .<ssssss>t : sort of a spoil sour cherry cake in yeast taste .<ssssss>not good .<ssssss>m : good mouthfeel , oddly , until it go down .<ssssss>then , you be leave with a sour chalky burn at the back half of you mouth .<ssssss>instead of want more , i want some water to rinse it out .<ssssss>d : none .<ssssss>i almost feel like this beer be just label wrong ... maybe it be more of a saison or some other variety of sour beer .<ssssss>this taste nothing like any ipa i have ever have .<ssssss>no thank you !<ssssss>
2 3 8 3 2		to start off this be a far below average malt liqour that i find to be quite like any other malt liquor , crappy .<ssssss>a : ugliest bottle i have ever see , and a very unatractive beer which pour a average piss color .<ssssss>s : smell a lot like point white biere , bad .<ssssss>t : very spicy , malty -lrb- obviously -rrb- , and have little hop pressence .<ssssss>m : a excellent mouthfeel and not too bubbly .<ssssss>d : far too much of a acidic burn to the back of my throat after take a drink .<ssssss>bottom line : just not reccomend , unless you a fan of malt liquor which i be not .<ssssss>
9 7 7 5 6		appearance : it pour a crystal clear deep garnet top with a inch of tight white head that tend to linger nicely , follow by lace that stick to the glass all the way down to the finish .<ssssss>smell : smell of spice and malt blend nicely in the nose .<ssssss>taste : the taste of this beer be rather not bland but lack the flavor that i expect .<ssssss>mouthfeel : this beer do have a creaminess that be very enjoyable and make for a very drinkable smooth beer .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		appearance : light brown , caramel color aroma : malty sweetness really shine through very invite aroma taste : clean beer nice sweetness upfront then finish smooth mouthfeel : weak carbonation , not sure if this be bad bottle or typical overall a nice easy drinking beer .<ssssss>good session beer cheer<ssssss>
7 6 5 6 8		pour out amber/copper , very thin white head on top .<ssssss>quite clear .<ssssss>minimal carbonation .<ssssss>smell be slightly sugar ... some hop ... slight apple aroma .<ssssss>taste start on the sweet side , but not overly sweet .<ssssss>finish be quite bitter .<ssssss>maybe a bit too bitter for a esb .<ssssss>earthy hop , very little citrus flavor .<ssssss>again , the finish be a bit harsh .<ssssss>mouthfeel could use a touch more body .<ssssss>otherwise , it be fairly drinkable .<ssssss>this will not exactly be a seasonal i look forward to , though .<ssssss>
7 8 8 9 6		this be a curious one .<ssssss>after my first sip , the hop be so strong i be ready to write it off completely .<ssssss>but i persist and it quickly win I over with it be complexity and smoothness .<ssssss>yes , it be a hoppy ale , perhaps a bit too much so , but it really grow on I .<ssssss>i be not sure i could drink more than one in a sit but this would be a great beer to accompany a nice dinner .<ssssss>
8 5 7 7 6		pour into a st. bernardus chalice jet black with a half finger off white head .<ssssss>good lacing all the way down .<ssssss>the smell be a little disappointing , i would expect my weak nose to be able to pick something out of this beer .<ssssss>but i can not .<ssssss>there be almost a tar liqourish scent to it .<ssssss>not at all desire .<ssssss>the taste be only slightly better .<ssssss>there be strong cocoa and coffee note , but no hop presence at all .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be okay , although the after taste be not very pleasent .<ssssss>for the money , avoid this beer .<ssssss>it be not terrible , but not worth it !<ssssss>!<ssssss>!<ssssss>!<ssssss>
8 8 8 10 9		a : golden copper color , somewhat hazy .<ssssss>pour a nice , fluffy , slightly off-white two-finger head .<ssssss>good retention with good lacing .<ssssss>s : sweet malt be the first thing i notice under the the obvious hop character that you expect in the style .<ssssss>the hop presence be rather piney and rather subdue compare to many dipa .<ssssss>nice fruit smell , plus caramel malt and some graham cracker .<ssssss>the malt smell be unexpected and very welcome !<ssssss>t : the big time malt backbone indicate on the nose be front and center here .<ssssss>piney hop with some citrus .<ssssss>hoppy , but not ridiculous , especially for the style .<ssssss>fruity upfront , with a distinct black pepper character appear on the midpalate and persist to the finish - awesome .<ssssss>alcohol be well hide .<ssssss>m : nice and full .<ssssss>i find myself swish this beer around quite a bit .<ssssss>no complaint .<ssssss>d : i find this very , very easy to drink .<ssssss>very high drinkability for the style .<ssssss>overall , i be very impressed with this dipa .<ssssss>not like the 1-d hop bomb that be so trendy within this style .<ssssss>complex beyond my expectation .<ssssss>the malt be big and balance the hop perfectly - very enjoyable .<ssssss>damn , too bad it be so expensive .<ssssss>
6 8 8 6 7		look : golden yellow in color with no head and obviously no retention smell : citrus hop with hint of lemon and coriander taste : it taste like a lemon head that be soak in vinegar with hint of citrus hop on the back end mouthfeel : dry right off the bat .<ssssss>light body and high carbonation and leave a nice sour burn in the mouth overall : not all that intense of a wild ale so there be a bit of drinkability just not for I<ssssss>
9 6 10 8 9		a : claymore be mahogany in color with a head of cream .<ssssss>no lacing be noticeable , and retention be as poor as expect from this style .<ssssss>s : bouquet be faint , but note of smoke , banana , and butter make it through nicely .<ssssss>t : smokey upfront with a hefty dose of walnut .<ssssss>banana and butter be also present at low level , and do not interfere with the beer 's overall character .<ssssss>m : medium to full in body with little in the way of carbonation .<ssssss>the mouthfeel complement the brew perfectly .<ssssss>d : a great example of one of my favorite style .<ssssss>i normally do not like much butter or banana in my wee heavy , but this brew keep it in the background .<ssssss>be one of the handful of good scotch ale in america , i highly recommend grab one .<ssssss>
6 7 7 5 7		it be a classic , and much better than many of the `` good '' beer i have have .<ssssss>like other write here , i have to admit that nostalgia improve this one for I , and it do honestly look and smell uncomfortably like piss when it warm , but who would drink it warm anyway ?<ssssss>a great deal !<ssssss>
7 7 8 3 2		my local cb & potts make a great blackberry stout , so i have high hope for this .<ssssss>pour a pretty thick dark brown to black color with only a little bit of head .<ssssss>smell like a mild -lrb- dry irish ` esque -rrb- stout with blueberry essence .<ssssss>not too bad so far .<ssssss>the taste be weird .<ssssss>the blueberry hit up front , but they be not really very sweet .<ssssss>the stout flavor be almost non-existant and i pick up a wave of -lrb- out of place -rrb- hop in the finish .<ssssss>there be also something that just taste `` off '' in the finish .<ssssss>the sunset wheat blueberry flavor be much better than these and the stout base be pretty weak .<ssssss>it taste like a homebrew go wrong .<ssssss>i finish one glass without too much of a problem , but i be regret this six-pack already .<ssssss>my wife flat-out could not stand it .<ssssss>i will not be revisit this one and i bet this 6-pack last a while .<ssssss>there be definitely worse option , and i admire the idea , but the result be a bit of a bust .<ssssss>this score be probably inflate a little because i want to like this .<ssssss>edit : future tasting of this be actually make I think it be even worse .<ssssss>the hop in the finish combine with that `` off '' -lrb- burnt plastic ? -rrb-<ssssss>flavor really make this a complete dud .<ssssss>i normally do not change review , but every subsequent bottle have make I think this be even worse than the last .<ssssss>worst beer i have have in year .<ssssss>
3 3 3 4 7		first i should mention that i be a college student with a huge appetite for beer and a very limited wallet .<ssssss>natural light be not a good beer , i will not argue that .<ssssss>it be taste be piss-poor , which go along well with it be appearance .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be one of carbonated water with something not quite right add .<ssssss>what natural light , or natty light as we call it , have over other beer be its obvious cheapness .<ssssss>ten buck for a case be very attractive to those of we who either can not afford better , or be simply look to get smash without spend more .<ssssss>the same watery taste be what allow one to drink gallon of the stuff very quickly , and what inevitably follow be a night of destruction for only 10 buck .<ssssss>i would not advise anyone look for a tasteful beer to try natty light , you will be dissapoint .<ssssss>it be not a quality beer .<ssssss>that be why anheuser-busch make it -- it be the lower end of the spectrum of they beer product .<ssssss>they know not everyone can afford a case of budweiser select or any other higher price beer all the time .<ssssss>and sometimes , as we college student can attest to , spend we precious few dollar on a nicer beer seem like a waste when the goal that we be strive for be oblivion .<ssssss>with a goal like this , you will not have to remember how bad the beer taste in the morning .<ssssss>

8 7 7 9 7		big thanks to ogglethorp for this one , pour into a tulip .<ssssss>pour a hazy golden brown , very much tea-like , with a small off-white head that recede to a creamy collar and a soapy swirl in the middle .<ssssss>the aroma be a interesting combination of piny hop from the simcoe and the sweetness of the candi sugar .<ssssss>there be a hint of spice as well , but the simcoe be most prevalent .<ssssss>overall the nose be pretty tame .<ssssss>wow , the taste be really big with so many disparate taste hit the tongue at once .<ssssss>the first thing i get be the candi sugar and belgian yeast , like a big belgian beer .<ssssss>but the simcoe really turn it on in the middle and the finish be massively floral with ton of pine resin along with lot of spiciness from the yeast .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be slick be full-bodied with low , soft carbonation and a definite alcohol burn , especially in the finish .<ssssss>it be almost syrupy , especially as it build up after each sip .<ssssss>this be another interesting big beer from kuhnhenn and the aroma do not prepare I for the onslaught that i be go to get in the taste .<ssssss>ton of different flavor from sweetness to floral to almost purfumy .<ssssss>i be not convince it come together perfectly but i be enjoy sip on it .<ssssss>
7 6 4 7 6		appearance : pour a hazy , highly effervescent , pale gold body with a swell , white head .<ssssss>smell : subtle note of lightly bready malt , citrus , and spice with a fine , delicate note of flowery perfume .<ssssss>i suspect i be miss a fair bit thanks to these unruly bubble .<ssssss>pity .<ssssss>where 's a spoon when i need one ?<ssssss>taste : a bit bready , a bit grainy be the upfront maltiness .<ssssss>light , restrained sweetness .<ssssss>flavor of tart , citrusy lemon and a heavy-handed dose of coriander .<ssssss>seemingly spicy hop with a mild bitterness .<ssssss>finish dry and with a fizziness that would outdo a mouthful of pop rock .<ssssss>mouthfeel : medium-bodied .<ssssss>shamefully overcarbonate .<ssssss>drinkability : whew !<ssssss>!<ssssss>it take much diligence to see my way to the end of this beer , and , be it not for the runaway carbonation , it could have be far better .<ssssss>one to revisit , provide they clear up the carbonation issue .<ssssss>
8 8 9 6 7		the foam start to climb up the neck as soon as the cap be crack , necessitate a quick pour .<ssssss>nice amber look body with a more than full white head .<ssssss>there be jet of bubble rise from the bottom .<ssssss>the smell be pretty spicy and the rye be apparent .<ssssss>there be some nice hop aroma also .<ssssss>the flavor be more subdue than the aroma be .<ssssss>there be just a touch of rye flavor and it be pretty mild all around .<ssssss>there be a good malt presence also .<ssssss>great body and pretty good drinkability .<ssssss>
7 7 10 8 6		aroma include chocolate and roasted malt .<ssssss>alcohol be rather heavy and solvent-like and detract from the malt character .<ssssss>this restrained itself over time but be still unwelcome .<ssssss>little to no hop be notice .<ssssss>appearance be a deep , dark black color .<ssssss>opaque .<ssssss>form a thin dark tan head which do not last .<ssssss>nice leg form when swirl in the glass .<ssssss>there be a rich chocolate flavor , dark and bittersweet .<ssssss>roasted grain character .<ssssss>bitterness be moderate and linger on into a dry finish .<ssssss>hop character very restrained and hard to detect .<ssssss>coffee and smoky note also present .<ssssss>this beer might benefit from additional sweetness that simply be not there .<ssssss>medium-full to full-bodied with a light creamy texture and a moderate level of carbonation .<ssssss>smooth .<ssssss>mouthfeel be my favorite part of the beer .<ssssss>overall i be fairly disappointed i pick up 4 bottle of this .<ssssss>anyone up for a trade : -rrb- the solventy alcohol aroma really hurt my impression at first .<ssssss>chocolate character be nice and the oatmeal seem to lend a little creamy/oily mouthfeel .<ssssss>some hop character and sweetness would have increase drinkability in my opinion .<ssssss>a bomber be simply too much for my taste .<ssssss>
9 7 9 5 6		ola dubh ... this beer pour out a bountiful black bundle of visual appeal .<ssssss>it be dark and beckon I to taste its delight ... only problem for I be the delight do not come like i expect .<ssssss>it start off sweet and have a tangible smoky flavor and a wonderful mouth feel , but it finish medicinal and prune like .<ssssss>the alcohol have a overwhelming presence that prohibit drinkablity for I .<ssssss>not horrible but definitely not spectacular in my humble opinion .<ssssss>

8 7 8 9 7		pour into nonic pint ... a - dark orange color .<ssssss>nice finger of egg white head .<ssssss>settle down to a cm then chill for awhile .<ssssss>sporadic lacing .<ssssss>s - freshly toast bread with a slight dulce de leche aroma .<ssssss>a touch of sulfur and trace amount of what a not so acceptable diacetyl for this style .<ssssss>t/m - malty and fucking delicious !<ssssss>biscuit , toast , grain , toffee , and even werther candy .<ssssss>a bit on the bock side of the style as its slightly sweeter than most fest , but still great .<ssssss>the flavor really sit on the tongue for a long time .<ssssss>great medium crisp body .<ssssss>coat the palate well , fitting for the flavor .<ssssss>o - not the most traditional oktoberfest , but i think this be a absolutely great beer .<ssssss>it lose a few point here for be much sweeter and not as clean as a oktoberfest should be , but keep the taste score high because i do enjoy this beer with style put aside .<ssssss>one of the best non-pumpkin fall beer i have have .<ssssss>might be hit my brother up to send I more , soon !<ssssss>
8 6 7 5 7		ive try to review this beer before and just couldnt put to word what it be .<ssssss>i have a few other beer that fall into this category , but this time be put it to word !<ssssss>2007 bottle serve in 2011 pour a deep black color , a nice 2 finger head , but with no body and quickly fall under the weight of alcohol .<ssssss>strong brandy leg as expect .<ssssss>aged russian imperial stout give off the oddest aroma .<ssssss>much like rum soak raisin coat in molasses , but this one bring out the rum and that just sickeningly sweet barely wine like characteristic unlike anything i can describe .<ssssss>this beer drink more like a rich dark barely wine than any stout i can think of .<ssssss>raisin , plum , fig , brown sugar , rum , vanilla , a touch of perhaps oak , molasses , liquorish , and just rich of alcohol note .<ssssss>age have really not do this beer any favor .<ssssss>the mouth be as expect , thick syrup with alcohol still present from start to finish .<ssssss>i have this a few month back on tap , fresh , and must say it be a amazing beer .<ssssss>this 4 year old bottle just isnt as good .<ssssss>i dont feel age have do this one any favor .<ssssss>i think the overt up front fresh flavor that be bold and demand be why this be beer to have .<ssssss>the age have mellow thing , but any element of a stout be long go .<ssssss>this come off far more in line with a belgian strong ale than a stout .<ssssss>no coffee , chocolate , burnt flavor at all be present here .<ssssss>well , i should say non be overt as there be a certain darker bitter flavor that make the most subtle appearance before be blow away by sugar sweet flavor<ssssss>

7 8 8 6 7		appearance : pour a pale gold , slightly chill-hazed , with a fluffy one-finger head of pure white that quickly fade to a filmy top layer that grip the side with gusto in horizontal line of lace .<ssssss>smell : strange mustiness in the back , akin to lager yeast .<ssssss>white wine , sour green apple , swedish fish , light lemon zest , floral lavender , chamomile .<ssssss>taste : the mustiness appear in the flavor as well .<ssssss>it be akin to a skunked lager .<ssssss>chamomile , rose , light fruitiness of pear and green apple .<ssssss>very dry finish .<ssssss>feel : medium , tingly carbonation .<ssssss>nicely smooth , but the medium-light body become lighter as it move about the mouth .<ssssss>drink : for all the `` left turn '' the label boast the beer take , this taste pretty similar to vertical epic 08 , though i would place that beer above this one on a best of list .<ssssss>not the best of the series .<ssssss>
7 7 4 6 6		i be look forward to this as the other wicked elf beer have be pretty good .<ssssss>pour with a thin head -lrb- i initially blame this on the glassware -rrb- but have a very nice colour and aroma .<ssssss>once in the mouth though it be a disappointment .<ssssss>quite a harsh carbonation which obscure what i think be actually a decent flavour , genuinely reminiscent of the belgian strong dark ale style .<ssssss>the overall effect be a chimay red that have go flat and have be re-carbonate with a soda-stream .<ssssss>oh well !<ssssss>
9 9 10 8 8		appearance - pour a pleasant iced tea color , a rather large head form up quickly , post ring and ring of thick lace all over .<ssssss>aroma - aggressive citrus and pine out of the gate , as expect .<ssssss>just a slight wet wood odor , nearly imperceptible with the intense resinous thing go on .<ssssss>develop some biscuity character and more easily detect oak as it set up .<ssssss>taste - the bastard be as good as ever .<ssssss>solid , heavy malt flavor in front , quickly layer with piny , resinous hop .<ssssss>the oak provide a soft edge more than a in you face oak or whiskey effect .<ssssss>it be great.the swallow give rise to the full hop profile , go bitter with grapefruit rind and dry the palate considerably .<ssssss>the finish be just vaguely warm of alcohol , but mostly just a subdue hop burn .<ssssss>mouthfeel - smooth as can be , the carbonation be ramp up to match the intensity of flavor here - good idea .<ssssss>drinkability - a fun six pack to enjoy and share .<ssssss>do not know if i would buy it again , but it be one well put together brew .<ssssss>
5 4 7 7 6		draft pint at the district chophouse ; ridiculously light in color , even for a `` light beer . ''<ssssss>but somewhat surprisingly there a nice smooth malty biscuity-ness to this , very reminiscent of a good koelsch , this bring I home to germany .<ssssss>well do , pretty enjoyable light beer , i must say .<ssssss>-lrb- # 2779 , 4/7/2007 -rrb-<ssssss>

5 8 6 5 4		this be a decent beer , but it be more like a ... well , i do not know , but a stout it be not .<ssssss>it pour up a extremely cloudy yellowish brown slurry of crap that resemble a sample of polluted river water .<ssssss>rather unattractive , indeed .<ssssss>smell be spicy with plenty of alcohol and cook dark fruit .<ssssss>a pinch of black pepper in the mix , as well .<ssssss>taste be almost dominate by alcohol with a decent measure of spice .<ssssss>there be a hint of a metallic taste on the finish which i do not care for .<ssssss>mouthfeel be much thinner than i be expect .<ssssss>i just have much higher expectation for this one and it simply do not deliver .<ssssss>not for I .<ssssss>
10 6 8 9 8		appearance - 5.0 pour two finger of moussy cream colour head which settle at a dense centimetre over a brilliantly clear body of amber-orange .<ssssss>left spot of lace all the way down the glass , gorgeous !<ssssss>smell - 3.0 attractive hop drive aroma be noticeably less pungent than in the best ipa , which suggest to I that it be not at its freshest .<ssssss>lot of orange marmalade with trace aroma of pine needle and dry herb .<ssssss>taste - 4.5 intensely bitter , which of course , be what be expect from the style , but still come as a bit of a surprise .<ssssss>dry , cracker-like malt backbone , a dab of caramel and big herbal , citric and piney hop flavour .<ssssss>finish very dry with a long linger bitterness .<ssssss>would be brilliant with spicy chicken wing .<ssssss>mouthfeel - 4.0 light to medium body and with fine , prickly carbonation .<ssssss>overall - 4.0 at 7.2 % , torpedo be on the upper-end of the ipa scale , a little stronger and it would be a dipa .<ssssss>undoubtedly a very good beer , but judge by the other review , this bottle be not as fresh as it should have be .<ssssss>re-review come soon !<ssssss>
7 6 6 4 5		with this be a weiss bier i be look for something along the line of a banana-ish lemony flavored brew that would be great for the summer time .<ssssss>the beer pour like a good hefeweizen should a cloudy amber with highlight of yellow .<ssssss>this beer turn out to have the look of a hefeweizen but not the taste .<ssssss>to I it be more like a pilsner which really be a shame to I .<ssssss>i be really hope for something smoother like banana and get something like fresh cut grass instead .<ssssss>
7 10 6 8 9		beer pour a clear , deep amber .<ssssss>fast-dissolving foamy head of large white bubble .<ssssss>minimal carbonation , no lacing .<ssssss>clean , slightly soapy scent .<ssssss>what be this ?<ssssss>a pilsner with no skunk aroma ?<ssssss>am i dream ?<ssssss>here i be think pilsner could not be bottle without it .<ssssss>nothing but malt and light hop .<ssssss>do not get any better for the style .<ssssss>tongue be scour by the carbonation on initial tasting , clear the stage for fresh hop .<ssssss>malt come through as the hop fade , in turn fading in the aftertaste to give the hop room for one last appearance .<ssssss>mouthfeel be light but still heavier than you average pilsner .<ssssss>this brew seem lodge somewhere between a definite pilsner and a amber , but it be lovely nonetheless .<ssssss>bare bone brew and delightfully so .<ssssss>cheer !<ssssss>
8 10 7 10 8		i find this on a recent trip to tulsa .<ssssss>i dont know a lot about it , though a cursory glance at the label show that this be a belgian pale ale age in whiskey barrel .<ssssss>hmm .<ssssss>interesting .<ssssss>the beer pour a cloudy orange to amber , darker than i would expect for something billing itself as a pale ale .<ssssss>very little head on this one , despite I pour from about a foot away from the glass .<ssssss>its nice to look at , with a moderate amount of bubble ring the beer .<ssssss>aroma be different , as there a sweet belgian yeast characteristic follow by the heat from the whiskey barrel .<ssssss>i get a bit of a apple pie characteristic , or at least the pie like my mom use to make without the cinnamon .<ssssss>not a lot of oak , but there also a welcome vanilla note that be hide somewhere in the background .<ssssss>taste be quite nice .<ssssss>okay , that not quite fair .<ssssss>taste be pretty damn amazing .<ssssss>this be like a liquid apple pie .<ssssss>layer of sweet and light fruit be follow by wonderful sweet caramel malt flavor .<ssssss>the whiskey and oak serve to enhance the whole sensory experience , add to the perception that this isnt a beer but a dessert in a glass .<ssssss>i often dont like whiskey or alcohol tone in my beer , but in this case it work .<ssssss>it almost feel like im drinking a liquid whiskey bread pudding .<ssssss>the whiskey be muted and underscore , which help in turn to elevate the entire experience .<ssssss>this be a very well construct beer from start to finish .<ssssss>the mouth feel be slightly syrupy , with only a small amount of carbonation .<ssssss>this lead to a somewhat cloying character on the palate .<ssssss>i suspect that this be one of those beer that you cant drink a lot of .<ssssss>take as a single glass , its quite wonderful , with this delicious apple-whiskey-vanilla-dessert thing go on .<ssssss>however , im afraid that this be one of those one-and-done type beer , mean that its not one i think you could drink a lot of .<ssssss>still , as a one-and-done , its quite fantastic , and easily the best thing ive taste from oklahoma .<ssssss>
9 8 10 9 8		pour a reddish-amber with a good deal of bubble slowly climb to the top of the glass .<ssssss>head be off-white and look about like the consistency of frothed milk .<ssssss>leave some thick , raise ring of lace with each sip .<ssssss>aroma be very toasty with a really sweet malt backing .<ssssss>there be a good deal of fruity ester and citrus/pine hop in the nose as well .<ssssss>flavor have a solid caramel malt base with load of toast malt character -lrb- crystal malt ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>the hop bring herbal and citric note to the fore in the middle of each sip .<ssssss>there be not much bitterness here , rather just a good , solid hop profile .<ssssss>finish a touch sweet with a little bit of diacetyl .<ssssss>mouthfeel be really silky , solid , and smooth in the carbonation .<ssssss>nice drinker overall , and surely one of the better amber i have ever come across .<ssssss>
7 6 4 6 6		on tap at the livery .<ssssss>pour a hazy amber color with a thin off-white head and not much lacing .<ssssss>the nose carry some light note of hop plus a bit of oak and a mild sourness .<ssssss>fairly pleasant , though a bit odd .<ssssss>as it warm , a unfortunate acetic character come through .<ssssss>the flavor be about the same -- start out with a moderate please sourness along with a few hoppy note and then get hit pretty hard with some acetic character , which be then very , very apparent in the finish .<ssssss>pretty cool concept , though it go a bit astray .<ssssss>
7 5 6 4 6		pour a very orange copper color .<ssssss>there be a thin off white head that dissipate quickly and leave no lacing .<ssssss>the aroma be very mild , some malt , light spice noticeable .<ssssss>the taste be thin with a little alcohol in the finish .<ssssss>some decent hop flavor , but relatively unnoticeable and forgettable taste .<ssssss>this be a mediocre brew from lenie 's for whom i respect most of the beer they brew .<ssssss>not they best work here .<ssssss>
8 9 7 10 9		gumballhead , my favorite beer .<ssssss>love that its brew here in indiana as well , which make it readily available .<ssssss>pour a light bronze color with a light head .<ssssss>leave a lacy trail .<ssssss>the taste be wonderful .<ssssss>the wheat be prevalent and delicious .<ssssss>a great beer overall , enjoy year round .<ssssss>really though , with fff , you can not go wrong .<ssssss>
8 5 4 7 6		young 's winter warmer in the middle of summer , what the hell be wrong with I ?<ssssss>a - a nice murky brown , with a slight red hue .<ssssss>average frothy white head , along with retention .<ssssss>lacing be just not there .<ssssss>s - smell of malt , and semi-protruding alcoholic fusel .<ssssss>t - taste be a snap rush of dark fruited malt , light undertone of black pepper .<ssssss>taste linger for a few seconds , and then give in to a light water surge that sweep all flavor off the palate , leave it almost flavorless .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very light , and drinkability be average .<ssssss>a odd winter warmer , and lack the usual warming characteristic , along with the complexity .<ssssss>make this drink only mediocre .<ssssss>
9 7 7 9 8		a : pour from a 12 oz .<ssssss>stubby bottle into a 16 oz .<ssssss>guinness glass .<ssssss>2-finger thick , foamy head with great lacing , and a tar-pit black body .<ssssss>s : sweet and malty , with a hint of the juniper allude to in the name .<ssssss>suggestion of raisin , prune , `` gorp , '' toast caramel malt .<ssssss>t : slightly sweet up-front with a malty mouth and a toast , roasted , smoky swallow .<ssssss>dry fruit , mild licorice , burnt molasses or caramel , coal smoke , pine resin , prune .<ssssss>good complexity of flavor in the mouth with a bone-dry , scorched-earth finish .<ssssss>quite a trip .<ssssss>m : the head feel good on the lip , but the feel do not live up to the flavor complexity .<ssssss>a touch thin in the mouth with a big , arid after-feel .<ssssss>o : when you drink this beer , it be akin to come into a fire-warmed cabin from a lip-chapping winter 's day .<ssssss>
9 6 7 3 2		beautiful ruby/brown , you can just see through it .<ssssss>a few nice inch of head - nice small bubble and they hang around a few minute to leave a lasting cover lace .<ssssss>to make it perfect the head would need to last longer .<ssssss>smell fruity and rich like a english barleywine .<ssssss>sweet prune and whatnot .<ssssss>taste , well .<ssssss>it do not taste english like it smell .<ssssss>well , sort of .<ssssss>but , see , it be completely bury under a overwhelming woodiness .<ssssss>this be over the top .<ssssss>yuck .<ssssss>other than the over-the-top wood -lrb- which really ruin this beer for I -rrb- , i get english flavor only without the sweetness .<ssssss>strange , to say the least .<ssssss>and , sure , i get bitterness but i associate that with tannin from the wood and not with hop .<ssssss>a most unpleasant experience .<ssssss>give another 10 year in the bottle i might think about actually drink one -lrb- as in , when it have mellow down to something only slightly more extreme than a normal barleywine -rrb- but , as it be , neither i nor the wife even want to smell it again .<ssssss>

6 5 5 2 3		i buy this at the lcbo , i think in hamilton , ontario , en route back to oklahoma from toronto .<ssssss>i have high hope for this beer as it be local to canada and look to not be a macro .<ssssss>mostly disappointed .<ssssss>as other have remark , it be not a ipa .<ssssss>it be not even a pale ale .<ssssss>so to review this i be go to review as a american macro -lrb- but knock a point off the taste rating for false advertising -rrb- clear yellow brew with small white head .<ssssss>aroma be ok , mostly sweet .<ssssss>the taste be not bad on first taste but then decline .<ssssss>it be way too sweet for my taste and could certainly use some hop -lrb- ironic -rrb- .<ssssss>i think i prefer budweiser because at least you have less of the sticky sweetness .<ssssss>for a summer quencher it be sub-par .<ssssss>the aftertaste be way too sticky sweet for I .<ssssss>i much prefer a bit of citrus zing from a wheat beer .<ssssss>-- - i will try my remain bottle with a lemon or lime wedge , maybe that will improve it .<ssssss>
7 8 6 4 6		a hazy brown beer with copper highlight .<ssssss>have a nice creany off white head .<ssssss>the aroma have a strong dry fruit and apple chatacter with a cinnamon spiciness in the background .<ssssss>the flavor have a odd mix of taste whirling around in you mouth , rubber tire , wood and a piny hop bitterness .<ssssss>there be a real dry finish almost mouth pucking .<ssssss>kinda remind I of some lambic i have have but this be not suppose to be a lambic .<ssssss>
5 5 8 7 7		mildly roasted malt aroma and scant else .<ssssss>a sorta dark brown/black with some amber tinting and a bubbly , diminish , thumb thick tan head .<ssssss>flavor have a bit of a cola/tobacco tinge in the fore follow by some brown sugar and tea-like sweetness .<ssssss>i seriously get hint of chamomille as well .<ssssss>kinda remind I of sleepy time tea-stout !<ssssss>its different and pleasant .<ssssss>
7 8 5 7 6		pour a cloudy amber , with a thick light tan head .<ssssss>the aroma be , of course , of cascade hop , but not as strongly as anticipate .<ssssss>there be citrus note too , of grapefruit and orange .<ssssss>the taste be good , with floral and bitter hop , and again a touch of grapefruit .<ssssss>it could use a bit more malt for balance .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be where this beer be most lack .<ssssss>it seem thin and insubstantial .<ssssss>overall , it be quite a nice beer , and i think i will seek out a few more of these come summertime , when a light-bodied , hoppy ale will be the perfect antidote to a hot , muggy japanese summer afternoon .<ssssss>
5 5 7 4 5		pale yellow pour with a slight head that disappear quickly .<ssssss>smell be uninteresting at best -- indiscernible grain with a bit of spice .<ssssss>the taste be even less noteworthy .<ssssss>beyond some grain , there be nothing there -- not even the bit of quench flavor that make many mexican beer nice pairing with mexican food .<ssssss>in this case , the beer add nothing at all to the meal .<ssssss>the relative highpoint be the mouthfeel , which be fuller than the nose and taste would lead one to expect .<ssssss>i keep think `` at least this be pretty drinkable , '' but the fact be ... it be not .<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 8		pour into a chalice from growler .<ssssss>hazy mud brown color with 1 in .<ssssss>head that be almond color and diminish to about a 1/4 in cover .<ssssss>smell be of malt and some floral hop note ... not as aromatic as i be expect for this beer .<ssssss>taste be rich in malt flavor that start smooth and finish crisp with a alcoholic tang at the very end .<ssssss>very full body a fill beer .<ssssss>lower carbonation than i expect but do not effect the mouth feel that much overall this be a good beer .<ssssss>probably my 2nd favorite from waton top only by abt 12 ... a must try !<ssssss>!<ssssss>!<ssssss>
7 4 8 5 3		appearance - uncap with a forceful rush of air .<ssssss>pour a cola brown with 5 to 6 quick finger of light mocha foam .<ssssss>pillowy like cloud , it slowly settle down to half height .<ssssss>the pour will take a while ... aroma - prior review make no mention of any brett-like funkiness , but that be the predominant smell here .<ssssss>oh well , i be drink it anyway ... taste - yeah , much like the aroma , this have a funky thing go on that suggest either contamination or brettiness of some kind .<ssssss>there be also some sweetness in there , support some cocoa flavor , and the funky bit have not overrun the palate with anything nasty .<ssssss>it be really hard to tell if the bottle be off or perform as intend .<ssssss>i will have to try this one again .<ssssss>mouthfeel - a nice sturdy body and some zippy carbonation be well-done .<ssssss>drinkability - not for I if this be the way it be suppose to taste .<ssssss>i will try it again though next time i see it .<ssssss>
8 6 5 7 7		there be a lot of adjective in this beer name that normally indicate superlative beer , such as `` imperial , '' `` rye , '' `` aged , '' and `` whiskey barrel . ''<ssssss>for all those word , i be not tremendously impressed with the beer underneath the label .<ssssss>it be good , but not as good as the devil make I do it imperial porter .<ssssss>still , i accept that some of these `` brewer go wild ! ''<ssssss>series beer will be better than other , and this beer have not dampen my enthusiasm for this series .<ssssss>appearance be black , opaque and foamy .<ssssss>aroma be a little whiskey-like , a bit grapey , and a bit roasty , but it be also a bit watery .<ssssss>flavor be less intense than i expect , and the abv of this beer be lighter than i think it would be .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit watery .<ssssss>not a bad beer , but it do not live up to my expectation set by other `` brewer go wild ! ''<ssssss>offering .<ssssss>i would recommend this beer , as i would recommend any beer in this series , but this be definitely not they best work .<ssssss>i buy this bottle at 3 cellar in franklin , wi .<ssssss>
8 6 4 6 5		bottle pour into a standard shaker pint glass .<ssssss>never have anything by new holland before , but have have good experience with a lot of michigan ipa 's , so interested to see how this go .<ssssss>no freshness information provide on the bottle , so i am force to assume that this be `` fresh '' and will review it as such .<ssssss>i really wish more brewery would provide this information on the label ... a : a huge thick lively white head sit on top of a hazy-golden-orange beer .<ssssss>i think i may have give this guy too-vigorous of a pour .<ssssss>s : i pick up a moderate amount of lemon and some earthy tone in the nose .<ssssss>the aroma be present but not potent .<ssssss>somewhat underwhelming .<ssssss>t : the taste be kind of * muddle * here , this beer can not seem to decide if it want to be a east coast ipa , or a west-coast hop bomb with that dry grapefruit/lemon/citrus flavor .<ssssss>the end result be that it be neither .<ssssss>my preference , personally , be towards the west coast style , and this have a distinct lemon presence , but there be very little other grapefruit/citrus presence here .<ssssss>the finish be not unpleasant , but it be not that punchy dry hop finish that i like in my ipa 's .<ssssss>caramel malt be visible in the middle and end of the taste , but lack that cotton-candy sweetness find in east coaster .<ssssss>i fear that this bottle may not be fresh ... but again , with no freshness date , i be leave with no option but to assume that it be .<ssssss>m : carbonation be lively , but this beer do not finish nearly as * dry * as i like my ipa to finish .<ssssss>d : below average .<ssssss>for free ?<ssssss>i would have one or two of these again without much complaint .<ssssss>but if i be pay ?<ssssss>i do not feel much of any need to revisit this again on my own dime .<ssssss>
4 4 5 3 6		if you be go to choose between this and bud light , go with bud light .<ssssss>the appearance of a coor light be light yellow/gold with a small white head that dissipate quickly .<ssssss>no lacing on the glass obviously .<ssssss>smell be inconsequential -- nothing really to it .<ssssss>grainy .<ssssss>just like the taste .<ssssss>mouthfeel be ok -- smooth go down .<ssssss>this be the type of beer you have to have ice cold at a summer bbq with a burger or hot dog to really enjoy .<ssssss>
8 7 9 8 6		bottled feb. 2008 .<ssssss>pour produce a modest but steadily hold off-white head , and the color be a radiant blood-orange .<ssssss>the cloudy , creamy head slowly spread small splotch of lace on the glass .<ssssss>while big hop and sweet caramel-ish malt be clearly lurk in this beer , the wood and alcohol aspect mute they .<ssssss>it be a nice enough aroma , if veer toward its beastlier characteristic .<ssssss>this be the fourth bottle for I -lrb- not in the same day ! -rrb-<ssssss>... each one have make a different impression .<ssssss>sometimes it seem too chalky/sugary ... sometimes too woody ... sometimes too boozy ... today everything be mingled very well , which might have to do with it be serve warmer than the previous three .<ssssss>malt take on a almost rye-like character , the hop be clearly here but color over with a woody brown crayon ... that wood hold firm but do not intrude , and the alcohol provide the kind of warmth that make it a better fireside sipper for the winter .<ssssss>mostly sugar and alcohol in the finish .<ssssss>texture be lovely .<ssssss>a smooth glide like fresh cream or butter , and just the faintest sizzle from the carbonation .<ssssss>wonderful .<ssssss>i would not find this to be a very good match for a variety of occasion .<ssssss>fine for sit at home and sip , always ... as part of a social tasting , would be great ... a winter-time beer for sure ... but it be strong and boozy , big and sugary , and really not that hoppy , consider it be base on a imperial ipa -lrb- 90 minute -rrb- .<ssssss>sometimes it do not even seem well-balanced .<ssssss>so i can not rate the drinkability that high .<ssssss>but i would never kick it outta my glass .<ssssss>all in all , another highly appreciate and above-average beer from the lord at dfh .<ssssss>
9 8 6 9 7		this be one excellent look porter .<ssssss>most notable be the incredible lacing from the linger creamy tan head .<ssssss>smell this beer , you know immediately that you be about to drink a rogue .<ssssss>that be say , i be expect a aggressively , perhaps even overly hoppy take on a traditional american porter .<ssssss>i be surprise at the result ; this porter be surprisingly true to the style .<ssssss>grant , the flavor be a bit ramp up , this be rogue and all , but this beer be well balanced .<ssssss>the roasted coffee , malt , hazelnut , and mocha flavor all compliment each other nicely .<ssssss>the hop keep everything frame nicely , but they be not a dominant or overbearing flavor .<ssssss>mixed into the finish be some blackberry , plum , and some oatmeal flavor to provide some sweetness to offset the dry effect from the hop .<ssssss>on the drinkability front , two of these or one bomber would be enough for I , be that it be a porter .<ssssss>overall , a excellent take on the porter .<ssssss>it be hoppier than many , but retain its balance somehow .<ssssss>double thumb up for rogue for resist the temptation to turn this into a hop bomb .<ssssss>

8 10 8 8 8		pour into a chalice glass , it be very black with a modest tan head that do not last long , leave a thin trace of lace around the beer 's perimeter .<ssssss>actually , go pretty flat after 15 minute .<ssssss>a intense sweet complex aroma with raisin , brown sugar , mollass , coffee , dark chocolate , trace of horseblanket .<ssssss>well balanced , with element of espresso , chocolate , nut -lrb- almond -rrb- , citrus , sour cherry .<ssssss>it taste like liquid fruit cake , which be appropriate for a xmas beer .<ssssss>the alcohol be very present .<ssssss>this be a winter sipper that will definitely give you a warm sensation .<ssssss>due to the 12 percent alcohol , either share a bottle or ample spacing between glass be highly recommend .<ssssss>
8 8 9 8 6		330ml bottle buy from belgianshop.com ... pour a dark copper / chestnut colour .<ssssss>creamy head pour big , thick and foamy then fade quite slowly to thickish layer ... sparse carbonation ... lot of sticky lace coat the glass almost until the end .<ssssss>.<ssssss>aroma - nice lightly toast biscuity malt , fairly strong toffee / caramel sweetness , nutmeg hint , spicy / peppery hop bitterness , typical belgian bready / yeasty note , spicy fruit -lrb- raisin , fig , orange -rrb- , quite strong rum / whiskey trace , some butterscotch ... taste quite strong sweet toasty caramel malt , buttery , some treacle note , toffee , alcohol soak fruit -lrb- fig , date , bitter orage -rrb- , peppery hop , oaky hint , creamy note , warm scotch alcohol trace , bready , quite nutty ... feel - very smooth and velvety ... medium body ... this would be a little too sweet and strong to be very drinkable - more of a sip beer ... overall - a very good example of a scotch ale although it may be a little sweet for some ... a nice winter warner though .<ssssss>.<ssssss>recommend<ssssss>
8 2 8 4 4		while the rest in my tasting group disagree with I i have to say that this one be quite disappointing .<ssssss>i have read a couple post about fresh citra hop require some age to get rid of that mercapto urine aroma .<ssssss>i have no idea if arctic panzer use citra hop but i get a big hit of urine plus sulfur & vegetative aroma .<ssssss>by vegetative it be not the nice green note from dry-hopping , it be the undesirable .<ssssss>body & mouthfeel be nice but the flavor kill it for I .<ssssss>
7 9 8 7 8		pleasantly surprise to find this kind of output from widmer .<ssssss>i pour it from the bottle into my chalice .<ssssss>the head do not stick around for that long , the beer have a nice clear , slightly ruby hue .<ssssss>the smell be the highlight of the beer for I , without look i would guess it be some combo of west coast hop .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>the taste be nice because the hop come through initially but it be a surprisingly balanced pale .<ssssss>the nose prepare I for a near ipa style , but it be nice to have the balance between the hop and the malt .<ssssss>the mouthfeel definitely fit the style , and i feel like i could definitly drink a few more of these upon finish .<ssssss>spot on widmer ... spot on .<ssssss>

4 3 5 6 4		i have hear about the maple bock in a article and be intrigue by the idea of add maple syrup post-fermentation to add a more prominent maple flavour .<ssssss>i wish i have check this site first , then maybe i would have go for something more worth my money .<ssssss>appearance - its pour make I think of a oily coca-cola ... dark brown , fizzy , with a light brown head that disappear in less than a minute .<ssssss>so far , not too impressed .<ssssss>it must be the syrup .<ssssss>remain cloudy long after the bubble disappear .<ssssss>smell - smell like lake ontario at its worst .<ssssss>no floral or fruity note , no hop , at all .<ssssss>i can not even smell any maple .<ssssss>taste - a little better than it smell ... a sour-sweetness overshadow the hop , it be get to be the maple syrup again , this be not work at all like i think it would .<ssssss>the aftertaste be not so good , my throat be full of some sort of goo , as if i have just puke .<ssssss>it also taste like something 's wrong with the water .<ssssss>i try trafalgar 's celtic ale a while back and i think the weird taste be a one-off but this be discourage , i do not know if i want to buy anything from these guy again .<ssssss>mouthfeel - it feel exactly like you would think maple syrup mix with beer would ... i do not know what else to say , it be interesting but the other factor be just turn I right off this beer .<ssssss>drinkability - i would not unless you want to try it for yourself , maybe you will like it .<ssssss>i do not really .<ssssss>i be 5 sip into this stuff and it be hard to go any further .<ssssss>overall really disappointing .<ssssss>
7 7 8 6 8		pour black with some ruby streak , and a tan head that be thick .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but probably due to a aggressive pour .<ssssss>recede quickly , and leave a cap aroma be of roasted malt .<ssssss>taste be of roasted malt .<ssssss>and its not a bad taste , its like a porter , except much lighter .<ssssss>which be not necessarily bad , but this be a schwarzbier .<ssssss>i sense very little in term of hop -lrb- which i would consider a component of the style -rrb- .<ssssss>mouthfeel be light and smooth drinkability be fine .<ssssss>it taste fine -lrb- even if it deviate from the style -rrb- , and its smooth .<ssssss>ultimately , i be unsure how highly to rate it just base on the limited hop profile , and a roasted malt flavor that remind I more of a porter than a schwarzbier .<ssssss>but its good , so i will not be exceedingly harsh .<ssssss>.<ssssss>
4 5 9 7 8		pour much paler than i expect .<ssssss>it be a very pale yellow : little color at all .<ssssss>the head be big and white , a tinge of yellow in it .<ssssss>it fade quickly .<ssssss>this beck 's smell hoppy and skunky .<ssssss>the hop be the nice european hop smell .<ssssss>it be a little skunky , which be offputting , but not overpower .<ssssss>the alcohol taste be not mask .<ssssss>the taste be not as strong as the smell .<ssssss>after the initial alcohol taste there be a bitter , hoppy aftertaste .<ssssss>there be a malty taste in there , but it be not as strong .<ssssss>it do not taste as skunky as it smell , and be not overly carbonated .<ssssss>except when i burp .<ssssss>overall , it be decent , better than the big three anyday , and comparable to heine or copenhagen , but a bit lighter .<ssssss>
7 6 6 4 5		pour into a pint glass .<ssssss>a : pour a thin dark coffee brown with light make its way through most of the edge .<ssssss>1?1/2 finger of head that dissipate fairly quickly with very little lacing .<ssssss>s : not much go on here .<ssssss>some twangy sweet malt and some breadiness .<ssssss>t : sweet malt with a twang .<ssssss>kind like a macro with a twist .<ssssss>i guess the dark color might give it a appeal , but i be not buy it .<ssssss>corn , malt , and sugar be all i taste .<ssssss>m : standard .<ssssss>medium to light body and moderate to high carbonation .<ssssss>d : get this in the botm shipment .<ssssss>guess i enjoy the other 2 because i have a few too many beer before ... but this one be not impressive at all after i sit down to review it .<ssssss>
4 3 7 4 4		i must admit , i have to applaud mark & spencer for recognise real ale as a indivual drink section .<ssssss>on a recent trip i purchase a few bottle of they new selection of real ale .<ssssss>the beer pour into a pint glass a mirky amber-gold colour , very poor clarity with a initial head that have a lifespan of 5 seconds .<ssssss>the aroma the beer produce be no better .<ssssss>the dominant scent of bitter hop combine with rotten fruit mix in with a cheap , lady 's perfume .<ssssss>very unpleasant indeed .<ssssss>the taste be again dominate by a initial burst of hop follow by a bitter-sweet floral taste , again with a hint of past-it 's - best fruit throw in for good measure .<ssssss>the best part of the beer be the mouthfeel , it would have be a really good session ale have the taste be nice .<ssssss>a medium body ale that let you know it be a real beer , but at the same time not make you feel bloated .<ssssss>however a beer be not purchase on mouthfeel .<ssssss>i finish the pint and would not order another one again .<ssssss>if this be what the supermarket be label as quality beer then the future will be bleak .<ssssss>i hope that this be change for a much better tasting beer .<ssssss>
8 8 9 7 9		on-tap at bootlegger 's a : the beer pour a opaque brown-amber color with a couple finger of off-white head and some mild lacing .<ssssss>s : a nice hoppy nose on this one with plenty of grapefruit and tangerine aroma .<ssssss>quite a lot of resinous pine here too .<ssssss>the malt be there and be nicely toasty with a bit of a roasted malt smell .<ssssss>t : unfortunately , the hop flavor be not quite there .<ssssss>the beer be strong on the bittering hop , but the citrus and fruit quality do not translate to the palate .<ssssss>a bit of grapefruit flavor and some grass be about it .<ssssss>a nice roasted quality that make this sort of like a black ipa -lrb- whatever you call it -rrb- .<ssssss>m : the body be medium with a lively carbonation and a bitter finish .<ssssss>d : i wish this one have some more hop flavor to it .<ssssss>hopefully this one get brew again soon and there be a bit of tweaking to the hop schedule .<ssssss>
8 6 5 7 6		500ml bottle a - cloudy orange with a lot of carbonation go on .<ssssss>off-white huge head that show nice retention but suprisingly leave very little lacing s - malt sweetness be barely detectable , with some typical weizen spicy note of clove and phenol .<ssssss>the main role be play by a strong citric aroma that mainly remind of grapefruit .<ssssss>nice and strong aroma , though a bit too metallic and tang in my opinion t - some light malt hint of bread and caramel be there at the back of thing , but hop be dominant .<ssssss>as the smell suggest , very much on the citric side , with lemon and grapefruit .<ssssss>then some spicy note of clove .<ssssss>highly refreshing and decently complex but i be get that metallic feel in taste and aftertaste too m - have the typical refreshing feel of a weizen , but it really hit you harsh on the palate , with very high carbonation and not much of a body underneath .<ssssss>guess it would feel a really flat beer if not for carbonation o - drinkabilty be very good and the 8.2 % abv be perfectly hide , but the beer do not seem to be able to stand on he own .<ssssss>you could either say this be a weizen that taste like a ipa or a ipa that feel like a weizen : it just feel like you be tasting two different beer at the same time .<ssssss>that be a bold attempt , but not a successful one , at least on schneider 's side<ssssss>
3 4 5 3 5		pour a clear , pale , yellow .<ssssss>little head with no retention and slight lacing .<ssssss>smell of adjunct in lager .<ssssss>fit the style .<ssssss>a crisp feel with low carbonation .<ssssss>taste of a weak lager with lot of adjunct .<ssssss>overall , not worth recommend .<ssssss>the body be too weak for anything but drink a lot of beer and not get full -lrb- get smash -rrb- .<ssssss>
9 7 8 7 10		impressive look lager .<ssssss>pour into a pil glass it form a meaty frothy white head that leave a thick cover of lace all the way down .<ssssss>its a golden yellow body with champagne like carbonation of all size .<ssssss>soft pale malt be the first and last thing to hit the palate .<ssssss>inbetween be a very subtle mix of grain note and a slight hop backside to even it out .<ssssss>as it warm it show a bit more of a bready malt bill .<ssssss>note : this be one of the better euro pale lager i have have to date .<ssssss>very clean and refreshing without anything annoying or out of balance .<ssssss>i would put this up with budweiser as far as be clean crisp and refreshing .<ssssss>i have not have this enough to know how consistent it be but this six pack be outstanding .<ssssss>
10 6 8 8 8		after spend 15 minute wrestle with a absolutely retard plastic coating over the cap , i finally get this beer open and pour it into my samichlaus tulip .<ssssss>color be pure amber , and a two finger head quickly rise , and fall into a thick blanket over the glass with thick lacing .<ssssss>string of bubble rise everywhere from the bottom of the glass like a fine champagne .<ssssss>actually very very nice to look at .<ssssss>aroma be yeasty , spicy , and bread-like .<ssssss>nice , but a little subdue .<ssssss>flavor be a nice mix of spicy yeast ester , caramel , malt sweetness , and a faint hint of alcohol .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very heavy and chewy , surprising consider what look to be agressive carbonation .<ssssss>drinkability be also pretty good for the style .<ssssss>i be expect to be a bit let down with this , but i be pleasantly surprize .<ssssss>i find it somewhat odd that this be not rank a bit higher ...<ssssss>
3 3 3 4 7		the polar brewery in venezulea brew only pale lager .<ssssss>this solera beer be very similar to the other popular product polar pilsen .<ssssss>this have a bit more alcohol , but not flavour .<ssssss>this be a pale product , insipid .<ssssss>easy drinking beer .<ssssss>not as popular as the polar .<ssssss>

6 8 4 6 3		pour out of the bottle into a tall slender glass .<ssssss>wow , this stuff pour out like maple syrup ... cloudy , medium-dark brown , carbonation sticking to the side of the glass .<ssssss>no head , surprise surprise .<ssssss>this smell a lot like de dolle beer imo .<ssssss>rich , bold , strong , rum soak raisin , dark chocolate , bread , yeast , butterscotch .<ssssss>the taste be interesting .<ssssss>definitely way too much alcohol to be cover up .<ssssss>the underlie flavor be extremely complex , though .<ssssss>nutty , sweet , almost a oatmeal like malty taste .<ssssss>the alcohol create a spike of sweetness around it leave a almost sour buffer around the alcohol .<ssssss>the finish be super-sweet with a touch of that bready nuttiness again .<ssssss>lot go on , but still too much alcohol for its own good .<ssssss>
6 4 8 5 5		this bottle pour a oily black with a little head to start but it quickly die off .<ssssss>it be the weakest of they stout series in term of appearance -lrb- one through 5th -rrb- .<ssssss>the aroma be of a lot of coffee , some chocolate and then this moldy like funk .<ssssss>this milk stout be smelly fishy .<ssssss>it almost have some oak or smoke like quality -lrb- but nothing like the fore -rrb- .<ssssss>it be a turn off .<ssssss>the flavor be strange too .<ssssss>there be a lot of smoke and this weird spin on lactic acid .<ssssss>it kind of have this burnt bacon aspect to it as well .<ssssss>at least its silky smooth and the alcohol be well hide .<ssssss>this beer , in my opinion , be the weakest of they stout series .<ssssss>i do not know what go wrong .<ssssss>
4 7 4 7 6		pour a golden straw color with no head , even after pour into the middle of the glass .<ssssss>smell somewhat hoppy , some citrus , a hint woody .<ssssss>the taste be pretty thin , not much sweetness to speak of .<ssssss>it do have a clean finish , but not too much bitterness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be pretty thin and watery .<ssssss>all in all , it be fairly drinkable , only because it do not have any overpowering flavor .<ssssss>might be good on a hot day .<ssssss>
8 8 7 9 7		drink this beer be a like smoking a hookah load with prune-flavored tobacco .<ssssss>no joke .<ssssss>if you have ever smoke from a hookah -lrb- tobacco , not marijuana ! -rrb-<ssssss>, you know that you lose all the harsh craziness of cigarette smoke .<ssssss>i have never be a smoker , but the second-hand be enough to make sure it stay that way .<ssssss>blech .<ssssss>but hookah smoking be very smooth and very easy -- and be often do with flavored tobacco .<ssssss>you get a definite buzz , a definite tobacco flavor , a definite smoke flavor , and a definite fruit -- whichever fruit flavor you put in the tobacco .<ssssss>and this beer be so much like that .<ssssss>smoky and fruity aroma with a pork-like bacon taste -- very german rauchbier in style -- with a vinous fruit taste underneath .<ssssss>quite odd , really .<ssssss>but fun to contemplate as it roll around on the tongue .<ssssss>honestly , i can not drink this whole thing in any sort of short sit .<ssssss>this be definitely a long sippin ' brew .<ssssss>but it be worth the sip .<ssssss>cloudy , pure , unique , linger , inspire , fun , and drinkable .<ssssss>not something i would likely drink a lot , but it have its place .<ssssss>many thanks to sakaroo for supply my bottle !<ssssss>!<ssssss>!<ssssss>

7 9 6 9 8		a - pour with a medium head , cloudy deep yellow .<ssssss>s - great nose .<ssssss>pine and citrus , very strong aroma from this one .<ssssss>t - wow ... from the nose i be expect the flavor to be more harsh , but this be overall a fantastic and smooth iipa .<ssssss>i think the name of this one be take from a compound in hop , mercene .<ssssss>there be something different about this one i can not put my finger on , but i would anticipate this be it .<ssssss>a very unique but balanced flavor .<ssssss>m - this one go down pretty smooth , but nothing special about the feel .<ssssss>hit the tongue a bit hard but come into its own nicely .<ssssss>i be not expect this brew to be as good as it be , but for anyone who like big iipa , it be definetely worth the taste .<ssssss>
6 6 6 4 5		appearance - pour a faily light straw .<ssssss>very clear .<ssssss>decent white head with almost no stay power , and no lace .<ssssss>aroma - like mst american macr-lager , smell mostly of sour mash with just a little bittering hop to break up the monotony .<ssssss>smell very clean tho , with just a hint of corn meal .<ssssss>taste - the very 1st taste be slightly sweet , but the sweetness disappear very quickly , and you be leave with normal light maltiness and a hint of bitterin hop .<ssssss>also get some cardboard or paper in there as a after-taste .<ssssss>mouthfeel - very light body .<ssssss>good carbonation level .<ssssss>dance over the toungue nicely .<ssssss>to bad it do not taste a little better .<ssssss>drinkability - need to be ice cold to be enjoyable .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 8		pour from a bottle into a flute , courtesy of stoutsnipa , brdc , and other .<ssssss>this beer pour a thick black which be opaque when hold to the light .<ssssss>a 3 + inch tan-colored head form and be short live but leave a persistent lacing .<ssssss>the aroma be very interesting .<ssssss>i pick up a significant sour scent that be similar to apple cider .<ssssss>this be on top of the already present roasted coffee and chocolate .<ssssss>very unique , but very good .<ssssss>the taste mimic the aroma , include the sour , apple cider combo .<ssssss>it be quite well balanced and good .<ssssss>the mouthfeel seem quite thin and light body to I .<ssssss>there be a reasonable level of carbonation that when mix with the sour/tart mix be quite good .<ssssss>this be a very drinkable beer but it have some unusual flavor .<ssssss>i would certainly have it again and would look forward to see how the flavor and aroma would change with aging .<ssssss>
5 8 9 8 8		have a rich , wheaty , yeasty aroma that be quite strong .<ssssss>appearance be a rather uninspiring clear yellow with a average and not too persistent head .<ssssss>flavor , fortunately , more than make up for the look - it be strong , mouth-filling , yeasty , slightly fruity , slightly sweet , quite refreshing , but with a hint of hop bitterness and a nice , ragged bite .<ssssss>texture be fizzy , lively and ragged , fairly dance on the tongue and down the pipe .<ssssss>good one !<ssssss>
9 6 8 9 9		a - one of the most yellow or golden ale i have ever see i think .<ssssss>it have a rich golden amber color and a two-fingered yellowish white foamy head that , for I , last a eternity .<ssssss>s - very delicate with light scent of pine , fruit , and sweet malt .<ssssss>t - malty sweetness , big breadiness , and a strong hop presence conspire to create a interesting ale of unique character .<ssssss>the sweetness of the malt hit you right away , but then a wash of bitter hoppy goodness consume you palate and linger on the tongue .<ssssss>8 % alcohol give it a slight boozy quality .<ssssss>m - delicate carbonation , bready flavor , and a sturdy malt presence give this beer considerable body .<ssssss>both intensely sweet , the bitter , but it do not cloy to the tongue as it might .<ssssss>o - i think its uniqueness add to the experience , but i really like this imperial pale ale , whatever that be .<ssssss>from its rich color to its abundance of hop , this brew push most of my button .<ssssss>i have not be disappoint by a southern tier brew yet and this one be no exception .<ssssss>
7 7 4 3 4		750 ml from bevmo , scottsdale .<ssssss>pour a hazy dark pink with a two-finger lighter pink head .<ssssss>the head dissipate very quickly .<ssssss>the aroma be different .<ssssss>sweeter , marischino cherry nose .<ssssss>a bit of cider as well .<ssssss>the taste , well , it be not good .<ssssss>it be identical to cherry nyquil , except nyquil be not at watery .<ssssss>heavy ethyl alcohol and chemical flavor with the nasty cherry-slurpee flavor be jsut bad .<ssssss>i only make it about halfway through my first pint before i dump it and the bottle down the drain .<ssssss>avoid .<ssssss>
8 9 8 7 9		nice look brown bottle with monochrome white print .<ssssss>pour a deep reddish brown with a big fluffy head into a crappy cheap ` wine glass ' in my hotel room , cause that be all i get !<ssssss>smell be pleasant , if a bit cloying .<ssssss>strawberry , raisin , buttery malt , and some grapey-winey aspect .<ssssss>flavour be a bit lack , actually .<ssssss>malty with some slight hop bitterness .<ssssss>somewhat medicinal , barest hint of something chocolatey in the background .<ssssss>aftertaste be a bit bitter .<ssssss>a very drinkable beer for the abv , but nothing to write home about .<ssssss>not worth the price pay , either .<ssssss>
8 4 8 7 8		get to have this at founder fest 2010 !<ssssss>not the best beer from this brewery , but still , it be pretty sweet that i get to try something a little different from they .<ssssss>review be from note take on 6/19/2010 and pour from the tap to a big ol ' plastic cup .<ssssss>appearance : pour be a very pale lemony yellow color and start with a even one finger loose head that fade to a thin , but full cap ; body have great clarity and show fast and strong carbonation ; only a thin ring of foam be leave hang around the top of cup .<ssssss>smell : a real grassy hoppy bite with a bit of a sweet malty graininess ; nose be really weak overall though and i feel like i need to pull extra hard just to get some odor out of it .<ssssss>taste : the grassy hop be present , but there be a sweet corn-like grainy and toasty presence that add a appropriate balance ; really a simple and straightforward beer with a sweet corny syrupy aftertaste .<ssssss>mouthfeel : light body with carbonation that come across softer than it look ; a moist and thin coating be leave hold on to the palate and it really hold that sweet and syrupy corn-like flavor quite well .<ssssss>drinkability : quite high with this light body and low abv ; a nice light set of flavor as well that be not the least bit overwhelming , and actually a little refreshing after the slough of big beer that i have be drink lately .<ssssss>it be good , and i actually really would not mind see this in a bottle sometime .<ssssss>
7 7 5 7 8		appearance : crystal clear filtered hefeweizen , golden in color with a frothy billow white head lace be spread evenly in webbed pattern , nice .<ssssss>aroma : some banana and clove scent survive the filtration sharp malted wheat sharp sweetness not bad seem spritzy and really carbonate .<ssssss>taste : hint of the banana and clove with a spritzy wheat base flavor blend well together but this one just keep I yearning for a more citrusy unfiltered hefe .<ssssss>mouthfeel : very refreshing but do indeed lack body compare to most wheat beer i be accustom to , spritzy extreme carbonation very hard to get a good pour take some work and patience .<ssssss>drinkability : one of the most perfect lawnmower beer not too complex in anyway just good ol ' refresh on a hot day .<ssssss>
8 7 6 9 8		presentation - pour into fly fish pint glass appearance - black , with somewhat off-white finger head with good retention smell - oatmeal and milk taste - oatmeal and milk mouthfeel - medium to light body with suprisingly creamy finish drinkability - sessionable overall - worthy<ssssss>
7 4 5 6 6		appearance : the beer be almost black in color with a 1 inch creamy caramel color head .<ssssss>smell : barely any aroma with this as the description tout it be brew with black barley , roasted barley , and chocolate malt .<ssssss>taste : this be a thin body version , but it do have a decent taste as some roasted malt and coffee overtone linger into the aftertaste .<ssssss>mouthfeel : smooth on the mouthfeel but too thin for a stout .<ssssss>drinkability : it rank a average in taste and drinkability .<ssssss>
9 7 8 10 9		i just kind of fall apon this beer about two year ago .<ssssss>when i first start drinkn i be a malt liquor kind of guy so i grow to really enjoy the flavor of colt and olde english .<ssssss>then get older i would just stick to budweiser .<ssssss>when i could actually start buy beer i start tamper around and buy some for a bon fire with my family and for some reason this beer hit the right note for I .<ssssss>ive be basically a coor man ever since , so if im not try other beer or im at a bar i reach for the rocky , but never a coor light .<ssssss>a - light golden color s - not the most appealing but nothing to turn you off to it .<ssssss>t - for I the taste be wonderful .<ssssss>its not real skunky , and there be really no linger after taste .<ssssss>to I it taste like what i always think beer would taste like when i be young and wonder .<ssssss>m - very smooth , with alot of carbonation d - as long as you dont have a full stomach the beer go down very smooth , you can take one after the other without too much of a headache the next day .<ssssss>but it do have a fair amount of alcohol content so it will get the job do after about 6 or so .<ssssss>
9 10 9 8 9		a - very dark , completely opaque .<ssssss>just the way i like my dark ale s - smell wonderfully of spice and floral bud t - taste good .<ssssss>nothing special , good amount of spice .<ssssss>m - feel nice when you hold it in you mouth before you drink it down .<ssssss>leave just a small tingling feeling on you tongue .<ssssss>d - go down incredably smooth .<ssssss>a near perfect combination of ingredient , enough to taste they all , but none to strong to leave a overpowering taste in the mouth .<ssssss>a wonderful beer that i would recommend to anyone , unless they do not like good beer .<ssssss>
9 8 10 7 7		never see this before nice to be able to pick it up at a beer drive-thru !<ssssss>a wild billow head exist atop a dull golden body .<ssssss>ridiculous cling .<ssssss>nose be phenolic , crack pepper , clove , and general yeastiness .<ssssss>fall in line with much of the bernardus line .<ssssss>attractive .<ssssss>taste be saison-y minus the funk : wisp and thread of alternate mineral , dryness , earth .<ssssss>rather a stock bernardus , really supertasty , still , too pricey for all-the-time consumption .<ssssss>seem to lack some distinction .<ssssss>mf : one of the slinkier belgian on the tongue .<ssssss>drinkability suffer just from the sense that id be more inclined to sack another single from the bernardus line .<ssssss>
3 6 2 4 3		pick up a few day ago , no date anywhere .<ssssss>crystal clear , a little darker than the glass of its bottle .<ssssss>one finger of head quickly dissipate .<ssssss>smell of cola , root , and carmelize sugar .<ssssss>some recognizable and reasonably complex malt and a slight hoppiness .<ssssss>slightly sour and very weak .<ssssss>some nuttiness , faint char malt , could stand some more bittering .<ssssss>could stand some more anything .<ssssss>some earthy tone be nice .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very watery and overcarbonate ... `` liquid bread '' ?<ssssss>hah , mouthfeel-wise this be more like a diet coke .<ssssss>no finish at all ... it just vanish .<ssssss>glad that leinie 's try this , however , i will stick to they other brew .<ssssss>perhaps it be unfair for I to review this in comparison to other doppelbock , as they be probably not try to ace the style .<ssssss>oh well , they put the name on the bottle .<ssssss>will offer the remain bottle to guest .<ssssss>you can not win they all ...<ssssss>
5 4 7 5 5		pour into a pint glass .<ssssss>a - straw yellow with a tiny bit of head .<ssssss>do not hold to the glass all that well , a it look like a standard pilsner .<ssssss>s - `` woof !

''<ssssss>this remind I highly of spaten , another german pilsener for which i do not very much care .<ssssss>i get a sensation of rye , which be new .<ssssss>also , obvious roasted corn and malty grain alcohol flavor preside as the mc .<ssssss>bitter , i think , and it end up a little wet .<ssssss>m - slosh around nicely , coat the entire pallete with relative ease .<ssssss>d - i do not like the flavor , so i would not do it again .<ssssss>i do not know who i would recommend it to .<ssssss>actually , that be not true ; i would recommend it to someone who be really , really cold .<ssssss>st. pauli 's make I feel at least 10 degree warmer .<ssssss>

7 7 6 8 5		pour a coppery amber with a firm pink , yeah i say pink , head .<ssssss>smell be strawberry with some lambic-ish funk .<ssssss>the taste amplify the aroma , add in a distinct cidery sour tang that keep the sweetness from become cloying .<ssssss>the sheer amount of strawberry flavor be impressive .<ssssss>i have brew strawberry beer before and not achieve half the strawberry presence this have at a rate of a pound of berry per gallon .<ssssss>despite the sourness , this manage to be a rpetty heavy brew .<ssssss>a bit more abv might help .<ssssss>not anything in the range or a session beer , so i could not reach for another right away , but it might be attractive to one more inclined to tropical mixed drink or wine cooler .<ssssss>
6 8 6 6 5		bottle inspection : clear label give up 6.3 % abv .<ssssss>, not much else aroma : nice fresh hop nose !<ssssss>pine , citric , bit floral , really nice .<ssssss>appearance : amber glass with good clarity , thin off white collar that give little lace .<ssssss>flavor : bitter over the top , tea flavor , with a nice hop flavor finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel : medium carbonation , medium body overall impression : nothing too wrong here , but miss the wow factor .<ssssss>the bitterness be too high for the hop flavor payoff which while nice , just doesnt come through .<ssssss>thanks to pegasus for the sample<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		i think this beer be suppose to be best in its class .<ssssss>not so imo .<ssssss>right off the bat , this beer be a little thin , and over carbonate .<ssssss>the flavor be strong dark malt and roasted coffee .<ssssss>nice , but just too tangy of a finish .<ssssss>a good bitterness yes , but the tangyness and the let-down mouthfeel just do not make this a great beer .<ssssss>a decent imp stout , and that be about it .<ssssss>
8 9 7 7 6		pour into my pint gla a beautiful clear amber with medium head that quickly fade to a thin sheet that leave spotty lacing .<ssssss>smell be great , lot of flowering hop , honey , citrusy .<ssssss>taste be awesome but seem impossibly backwards .<ssssss>like its hoppy bitter up front with a sweet linger finish .<ssssss>gala apple , grass , and honey .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a little sticky but nice carbonation up front .<ssssss>drinkability be a little low in my opinion for this style due to the sweetness , but a overall good experience .<ssssss>
4 5 4 6 7		appearance - very pale yellow .<ssssss>little foam , disappate very quickly .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>smell - ordinary for a macro light .<ssssss>faint scent of adjunct .<ssssss>taste - quite watery and light .<ssssss>sweet and faint adjunct taste .<ssssss>not at all distinctive , but no off flavor .<ssssss>mouthfeel - watery and light .<ssssss>not real foamy , sense of carbonation really come only from the metallic tang .<ssssss>drinkability - like most light lager , this be pretty refreshing and insubstantial .<ssssss>i would put the taste in the better half of light lager .<ssssss>this stuff be not a bad choice for get load in the ice shanty -lrb- or whereever it be that you get load -rrb- .<ssssss>lot better than bud light , the michelob should probably be anheuser-busch 's flagship beer .<ssssss>
8 8 7 6 8		pour out a blood red lacing of the dark blackness that inhabit the bottom of the wine glass.two finger of tan suds adorn the top of this great concotion .<ssssss>smell be sour cherry wood oak and yeast .<ssssss>a very pungent yeast .<ssssss>when cold this beer be dry and dirty tasting .<ssssss>after a warm up period it mellow out and the cherry dry woody sour come to the forefront .<ssssss>` dark sour cherry . '<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit dirty but still get 's ` cleansed ' by the sourness each and every sip .<ssssss>all in all this be a great lambic .<ssssss>should be on the top 200 if they have such a thing .<ssssss>
7 7 7 9 8		this be my second go around with anderson valley .<ssssss>try they back in 2008 , and be not impressed .<ssssss>hear they hire a new brewmaster with impressive credentials , so figure i would try they again .<ssssss>look like a amber ale .<ssssss>clear amber .<ssssss>not much head , but reasonable lacing .<ssssss>really instrest aroma .<ssssss>very piney grassy smell .<ssssss>not like other piney smell i have smell .<ssssss>maybe pine be the wrong word .<ssssss>do not exactly smell great .<ssssss>flavor be where this beer really shine .<ssssss>floral and grassy hop up front , follow by a nice round biscuity maltness .<ssssss>hint of pepper in there .<ssssss>medium body with reasonable carbonation .<ssssss>over all this be a very good beer .<ssssss>my first go around with this beer in 2008 leave I less than impressed , but i may just grab a other one of these .<ssssss>
8 8 10 10 8		what a smooth beer .<ssssss>i have not taste a full body dark belgian style ale that be this smooth .<ssssss>it have a creamy texture that make this a wonderful beer to sit and sip all night<ssssss>
7 10 7 8 9		pour from a growler into my new holland high gravity series glass a - black as can be with a small circle of tan/brown head s - tootsie roll with a hint of hershey chocolate .<ssssss>be this really a beer ?<ssssss>t - tootsie roll with a hint of hershey chocolate ... seriously though a little more go on in the flavor however .<ssssss>mostly milk chocolate flavor but a hint of bitterness be in there as well .<ssssss>maybe a little molasses as well and a bit of alcohol heat in the back .<ssssss>m - thick with very little carbonation .<ssssss>kind of syrupy but a little thinner .<ssssss>d - if you like chocolate it would be a real easy drinker .<ssssss>i do not usually say this but this could use a hair more carbonation .<ssssss>this be a pretty interesting beer and i will enjoy it .<ssssss>i think you really have to be in the mood for something like this to enjoy it though .<ssssss>
8 5 8 8 7		bottled , consume on 03/07/08 .<ssssss>pour a caramel/reddish-brown , clear with a nice little head that reduce to a foamy skin with nice lacing .<ssssss>plenty of active carbonation throughout tasting .<ssssss>aroma be a little boozy but mainly caramel malt and a unfortunate hint of soap .<ssssss>the beer be unexpectedly smooth and creamy on the palate .<ssssss>good tingly carbonation .<ssssss>flavor be caramel malt without excessive boldness or sweetness .<ssssss>some midly peppery euro style hoppiness at the end .<ssssss>almost no bitterness -lrb- save for a trace -rrb- .<ssssss>finish be mostly clean and a little dry with a some linger malt character .<ssssss>a easy drinker , this be my go-to amber as it be widely available on draft in my area .<ssssss>unfortunately , many place have fat tire as they sole amber instead , which be a bummer .<ssssss>
8 9 9 7 7		i have be warn that this be a pretty ok ale .<ssssss>it be .<ssssss>it certainly beat lot of inferior microbrew .<ssssss>i drink my first in a back to back taste test with a dogfish head 60 .<ssssss>not really the same style .<ssssss>the bud be inferior , but it be not crap either .<ssssss>i will buy it again , and not just because i be at a store where there be not anything else -lrb- although that will come into play -rrb- .<ssssss>editing the review nearly two year later , my taste have change .<ssssss>i do not care for it as much .<ssssss>in general i do not much like thing of this genre - american amber type .<ssssss>it be a bit too malty and a little roasty for my taste .<ssssss>i recently buy a 12 because it be cheap - rebate .<ssssss>i find it difficult to tolerate at time so i have a few of they right out of the bottle and as cold as possible to kill the pain .<ssssss>i be not savor they .<ssssss>
6 7 6 5 7		pour from a 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle into a pint glass .<ssssss>a - pour a hazy , straw yellow .<ssssss>minimal head on a aggressive pour .<ssssss>reduce to a thin ring around the glass .<ssssss>s - passionate fruit dominate this one .<ssssss>not much else to this except a slight aroma of wheat .<ssssss>if i be not such a sucker for passion fruit this would have get a worse rating .<ssssss>t - much like the aroma .<ssssss>overly simple and pretty bland .<ssssss>sort of like a one trick pony .<ssssss>passion fruit upfront quickly fade to a bland taste consist of minimal malt and a bit of wheat .<ssssss>m - light body , almost too thin .<ssssss>i be glad that this one be not overcarbonate .<ssssss>d - give that this be almost like drinking passion fruit flavored water , it go down pretty easily .<ssssss>overall , not my cup of tea .<ssssss>definitely will not be drink this one again .<ssssss>
7 7 4 5 6		appearance -- pour a dark brown with a slim mocha head .<ssssss>smell -- gentle bourbon , cocoa sweetness , roast malt , licorice/anise fermentation-derived herbal character .<ssssss>not much in term of oaky character , and the bourbon be really underplayed .<ssssss>taste -- up front be black malt overkill : burnt malt , smoke , and ash .<ssssss>chocolate malt lend some balancing sweetness .<ssssss>barrel character be not terribly evident safe for some gentle bourbon sweetness .<ssssss>anise be present , as be licorice to a lesser degree .<ssssss>mouthfeel -- medium-full in body with high carbonation and a hot finish .<ssssss>meh .<ssssss>drinkability -- this be a letdown .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be harsh , the barrel character be nearly non-existent safe for some mild bourbon sweetness and stinging alcohol heat .<ssssss>the smoky/ashy flavor be also distract .<ssssss>all in all , i prefer storm king .<ssssss>

7 7 4 6 6		this be my first black ipa .<ssssss>be read a bunch of review , and have be look forward to it !<ssssss>a - pour into a tulip glass , it blossom with a 1?1/2 finger creamy tan head that leave a ton of lacing sticking like a web .<ssssss>dark middle with ruby hip on this one !<ssssss>look good !<ssssss>s - hop , slight alcohol , and char wood .<ssssss>not quite smokey , but subtle hint of fire .<ssssss>malt and just a note of fruit when inhale .<ssssss>i be like this .<ssssss>t - definately char malt , smokey and toasty with a slight hop finish .<ssssss>hop and grapefruit very faint against the dark malt ... not so much ipa here ... more like porter i think .<ssssss>hmmm ... m - very thin and watery ... i be expect something totally different from a beer this dark and roasty smell .<ssssss>char really cover up what little hop fruitiness be there .<ssssss>d - not bad , a little underwhelm .<ssssss>probably be good with really fatty and rich bbq would pork rib or smoked fish ... again ... more smoked porter than ipa .<ssssss>not bad , just not what i expect .<ssssss>
9 10 9 7 8		pour into a chalice .<ssssss>like butterscotch top with pure white foam , this beer be absolutely beautiful .<ssssss>vibrant and simple .<ssssss>it suffer only from a lack of retention .<ssssss>the aroma be sublime .<ssssss>a perfect balance of a healthy amount of hop , malt and yeast strain , with the malt really dominate .<ssssss>it be very close to a tripel , with strong hop be the differ factor .<ssssss>there be a beautiful bouquet of fruit , most notably orange peel and lemon along with some coriander .<ssssss>but & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; & gt ; the taste be so disappointing .<ssssss>all the right flavor be there , but the coriander be too strong right away and the pepper be too strong in the finish .<ssssss>distract and unbalanced flavor take this away from be a amazing beer .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be appropriate , but it can not save the taste , which be still good , but underwhelm for this kind of project .<ssssss>
7 7 10 8 8		shock to see such extreme negativity in the first review on here ... i think he be expect to review more of a straight ipa for a hophead nivana than a balanced dipa ... hope some other check this out as it be a very good beer , but yes , slightly off balance in it be malt forward .<ssssss>a : cloudy amber in color with a barely there eggshell head .<ssssss>moderate lacing .<ssssss>s : sweet aroma penetrate the thin head .<ssssss>sweet apple and toffee with mild spice .<ssssss>no trace of pine , but touch of citrus present itself at the end of the nose .<ssssss>t : super sweet caramel and apple with mild appearance of citrus zest .<ssssss>spice i can not tell but seem to be lean towards nutmeg and cinnamon .<ssssss>this remind I slightly of a caramel apple butter make from granny smith .<ssssss>a very flavorful malt profile here , and the sweetness be very well balance by the bitter finish hop .<ssssss>there be not much flavor from the hop on this , but they be use well to offset the extreme sweetness .<ssssss>m : by far the highlight of this brew for I .<ssssss>rich and creamy with a perfect level of carbonation .<ssssss>the medium body coat the palette to perfection and give the sweet malt start and bitter hop finish the perfect vehicle to make you mouth water .<ssssss>nice feel here .<ssssss>o : a good double with a very strong malt backbone .<ssssss>it be lean quite a bit in the direction of the malt and could use a bit more balance , but the flavor of the malt be very welcome and a nice change of pace .<ssssss>
7 5 4 6 4		pour into my duvel glass a : pour pale yellow from the 24oz can that be more need for a engineering project .<ssssss>a ok finger thick frothy white head that last moderately long smell of cook corn and light amount of malt taste of slightly sweet corn and malt , with a barely noticeable hop bitterness m : crisp and watery d : like water ... corny fizzy water .<ssssss>
8 4 7 6 7		really dark brown/black pour with a dark brown head .<ssssss>strong burnt coffee aroma , not much else .<ssssss>a little chocolate , i suppose .<ssssss>i love a coffee aroma that come from real coffee , but this be a overroast , charbuck coffee , as oppose to , say , founder breakfast stout , which have a much more interestinf coffee .<ssssss>i mean , if you be go to make a beer with coffee in it , you may as well use really freakin ' good coffee .<ssssss>the sweetness in the flavor work to lessen the effect of burnt coffee .<ssssss>medium body , a ok stout , but i think they fail to give this beer a really pleasant coffee character .<ssssss>
8 6 9 7 6		a - pour a hazy golden orange .<ssssss>2 finger of fluffy white head .<ssssss>very good retention .<ssssss>the head finally dwindle into thin wispy island .<ssssss>s - sweet bready malt , grain , doughy lager yeast , honey , stone fruit , & mild grassy hop .<ssssss>alcohol come out as it warm .<ssssss>t - sweet fruity malt .<ssssss>peach and white grape .<ssssss>have a orange cream sickle type of flavor .<ssssss>sweet grain with a good dose of honey be in the mix as well .<ssssss>hint of grassy hop around the edge .<ssssss>finish crisp but sweet .<ssssss>m - the carbonation give enough fizz bite to balance out the sweetness .<ssssss>full body feel .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>big malt presence here .<ssssss>i would have like some more hop but carbonation help out a little with balance .<ssssss>a helles / dopplebock seem weird .<ssssss>maybe they be go for a imperial helle bock .<ssssss>
7 5 3 5 4		appearance : from the tap , this beer pour a deep reddish amber color .<ssssss>there be a less than one finger white head atop this beer .<ssssss>there be no carbonation in the beer , and the beer have great transparency .<ssssss>not really much in the way of lacing leave on the inside of the chalice .<ssssss>smell : it be very tough to pick up what be in this beer .<ssssss>whatever aroma be come from this beer , they be very light and tough to pinpoint .<ssssss>from what i pick up , it be mostly a malty smell with fruity -lrb- or something very similar to fruit -rrb- undertone .<ssssss>taste : this beer be light body , i believe too light body .<ssssss>i have this beer with my brother and we both agree that it be like drinking flavored water .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very lack .<ssssss>basically taste like malt & water with a little bit of fruit juice .<ssssss>after a few sip of this beer , we start think about we next beer , because this one be a valiant attempt at a different style , but just didnt hit the mark .<ssssss>a swing and a miss .<ssssss>my brother only drink about a third of he beer before give up .<ssssss>note : this be there fourth anniversary beer .<ssssss>we have this before a celtic playoff game on 4/23/05 .<ssssss>thankfully the celtic play much better than this beer taste .<ssssss>

6 7 6 4 8		one of my favorite beer for when i be break or go camping/fishing .<ssssss>this be a cheap no frill beer that i would definitely prefer to bud -lrb- buttwiper -rrb- or any big name generic beer in general .<ssssss>would i drink this over a good full bodied beer ... hell no .<ssssss>not a bad cheap beer though .<ssssss>
9 7 6 7 9		get this at my local grocery store , my dad be get into homebrewing and need some re-sealable bottle - just do my part .<ssssss>note : i smoke a lot of tobacco today so my chemo receptor may be a little numb .<ssssss>appearance : clear ruby-brown , 2 finger soda-y head , nice retention and excellent lacing .<ssssss>aroma : caramel , grass , alcohol taste : just like the smell .<ssssss>caramel malt and generally grainy up front , pretty mellow taste , as to be expect from a lager .<ssssss>surprisingly watery give the great retention but nevertheless damn good .<ssssss>slight bitter hop finish and aftertaste .<ssssss>mouthfeel : smoothe , medium-heavy carbonation with a fairly dry finish .<ssssss>drinkability : substantial -lrb- not sure what the abv be but i be feel it , do not eat this on a empty stomach -rrb-<ssssss>
8 8 3 3 4		a - dark brown and clear -lrb- the liquid portion be very much like coca-cola in appearance -rrb- , with a fine beige head s - some citrus hop peak out in the aroma , but not as strongly as i be expect give some report t - clean and aggressive hop character be there but completely overwhelm by oxidation in the sample i be tasting .<ssssss>there be no freshness date on the 22 oz brown bottle , this be a relatively new addition to package store i buy it from , and i know this store typically handle it be stock with reasonable care .<ssssss>this sample be not light strike , but i believe it be heavily oxidize result in a tongue-coating wet cardboard that overwhelm the flavor and dominate the aftertaste before become filmy and soapy .<ssssss>the brewery have not be open long -lrb- just a few month -rrb- so it can not be too old , which suggest to I they have a packaging problem to work out .<ssssss>d - this be definitely a drain pour i be afraid .<ssssss>i be look forward to try some three head beer , since they be relatively local to I and relatively new .<ssssss>i will try again and re-review !<ssssss>
4 5 3 2 4		pour a crystal clear straw .<ssssss>small white head which fall fast and leave no lacing .<ssssss>smell faintly of grain , and a touch fruity .<ssssss>taste be horrible .<ssssss>it taste like dimatap grape with a very watery malt .<ssssss>i have never have such a fake grape flavor apparent in a beer .<ssssss>mouth feel be thin and watery .<ssssss>i dont know if this be a bad bottle or what .<ssssss>i hope to god i never have to drink this beer again .<ssssss>
6 4 7 4 5		i enjoy the lighter version more .<ssssss>this beer be golden clear and have much carbonation .<ssssss>the taste and smeel be dominate by grain and barley .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be fine ... you can drink alot of this with no issue .<ssssss>i remember the busch and busch light commercial where the hand grab a six pack of can out of the icy stream ... bbbbuuussscccchhhh !<ssssss>
6 7 6 9 6		as ipa go , fuller 's be above average .<ssssss>it have a crystaline clarity and a eye-pleasing amber color .<ssssss>the head form over the beer be very thick and white , though without noticable taste or texture .<ssssss>fuller 's smell slightly sweet and start with a smooth , sweeten goodness as soon as it hit you tongue .<ssssss>the beer have just a hint of spice at the outset , but you soon become aware of a much more complex group of flavor as you drink .<ssssss>mouthfeel be about average among the other ipa i have taste , with a medium body and a weight to the drinking experience that sit on both the tongue and the stomach .<ssssss>the finish and aftertaste of fuller 's be its most unique characteristic .<ssssss>the beer end with a flash of lot of different flavor .<ssssss>through many mouthful i varyingly detect the following : salt , caramel , cinnamon , chocolate , and maybe a little lemon .<ssssss>all of these flavor be gentle , which probably explain why i have so much trouble decide what they be .<ssssss>this beer stay on the tongue and the lip long after its run out , but as long as you date like ipa , too , that should not be a problem .<ssssss>
7 6 8 9 9		this beer do not over impress with its look in the glass but what it lack there it make up for in taste .<ssssss>this beer have a full body taste with a slight sweetness that do not get overwhelming to the taste bud .<ssssss>carbonation be great and retain throughout the experience .<ssssss>a must try and economic to .<ssssss>
4 5 8 6 7		appearance have a nice amber to it with a thin head and nil lace .<ssssss>smell of caramel malt have a light honey note .<ssssss>taste have a bit of spice with the malt with saline in the background have moderate hop leave a light bitter aftertaste .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium with a good spike of carbonation .<ssssss>not necessarily my choice for a festbier , but not bad either .<ssssss>
6 5 7 4 5		thanks to rtap and mrvonzipper for this one look : dark brown in color with a 1/8 inch head and just ok retention smell : the nose carry some fig and plum and a artificial candy note .<ssssss>which be back up by a sweet yeast note taste : the beer be very dark fruit base and almost taste artificial or medicinal .<ssssss>the beer be overly sweet and remind I of candied plum and sugar drench fig .<ssssss>and finish slightly funky but not the good funkyiness that be typical of belgian yeast mouthfeel : medium body and medium carbonation overall : i be not a fan of this quad and to be honest it might be my least favorite of the style to date<ssssss>
9 8 6 8 8		thanks to brentk56 for send this want along in he black booty package .<ssssss>12 oz bottle pore into a pint glass it produce a two finger tan head that last .<ssssss>the body be deep dark black again no light come through this one either .<ssssss>there be a sweet aroma of malt and lactose be dominant in the brew .<ssssss>the flavor be rather nice sweet roastiness medium feel in the mouth and a little to much carbonation for the style for I .<ssssss>a nice milk stout rather unique in it flavor component but drinkable .<ssssss>i think it be a good example of a milk stout<ssssss>
10 8 6 8 8		a - huge creamy head that be easy to produce .<ssssss>ton of miniature bubble that never get overwhelm or distrube by a active carbonation profile .<ssssss>inky darkness and a sticky lacing create a picture perfect design on my glassware .<ssssss>s - strong oak presence come forth with vanilla tone in the beginning , background of sweet syrup that the bourbon provide .<ssssss>little bit of dark fruit lace in bourbon sweetness as well .<ssssss>t - first impression be of the vanilla and oak character that fade quickly as the bourbon start to heat up .<ssssss>middle be a bit alcoholic , tad astringent , and minor sweetness from the bourbon character .<ssssss>m - thin , disappointing , over-carbonated .<ssssss>this be the big let down of this beer .<ssssss>watery while have a tad creamy nature .<ssssss>the carbonation persist on the opening and through the middle .<ssssss>linger barely .<ssssss>almost a dry finish .<ssssss>d - regardless of how off this be from a traditional bourbon barrel aged beer , it be not a bad beer .<ssssss>it have some issue , it do come forth with a bit of silk on occasion , but overall it be a decent offering .<ssssss>not as good as i be expect , though .<ssssss>want some chocolate , or dark fruit , or roasted grain , or even burnt grain .<ssssss>it be too plain in term of flavor , but what it do have it do well .<ssssss>
5 6 7 5 5		buy a six pack from monument liquor in concord , can .<ssssss>forget exactly what i pay for it , but it be reasonable ; somewhere in the $ 7-9 ballpark i believe .<ssssss>pour into a pint glass .<ssssss>one inch light tan head that dissipate quickly to about a quarter inch retention .<ssssss>some carbonation , but not too heavy .<ssssss>dark burnt reddish brown color .<ssssss>i can just barely see through the glass to the other side .<ssssss>some trail of lace present .<ssssss>smell of caramel and sweeter malt .<ssssss>the hop be present , but very faint .<ssssss>taste of caramel and sweeter malt .<ssssss>hop and alcohol be completely mask in the taste .<ssssss>not very well balanced , but the style be partially to blame for this .<ssssss>medium body , lightly carbonate .<ssssss>a little more creamy than other i have have of this style .<ssssss>there be other i recommend before this one for a english brown ale .<ssssss>
5 7 8 3 6		pour from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass at cellar temperature .<ssssss>a : pour a cola-like head that dissipate nearly immediately , leave a light ring around the glass .<ssssss>very dark brown , but not quite black , and transparent against the light .<ssssss>the color be correct for the style , but the lack of any head be a shame .<ssssss>s : roasted grain predominate in the nose , with a hint of coffee and cocoa .<ssssss>t : the flavor be at first a nice roastiness , lead into a almost lemony sourness that be seriously out of place , and which end up dominate .<ssssss>there be a slight hint of buttery vanilla , just noticeable on the fade .<ssssss>m : the mouthfeel be quite light , and present as a session beer .<ssssss>fermentation be present but not aggressive or distracting .<ssssss>d : the relative lightness of the beer would lend to treat it as a session beer , but again the odd sourness probably limit most people to one of these at a sit .<ssssss>overall : i be again disappoint with the most recent offering from this local small brewery that i really want to like .<ssssss>open fermented porter sound so promising !<ssssss>the funk , though , manifest itself as a rather weird citrusy presence that just seem out of place for this style .<ssssss>
6 10 8 8 8		i have this as part of a ngne tasting .<ssssss>wow just a wonderful nose , nice and floral every thing you could want from it .<ssssss>it really invite you into the beer , which have a good flavor with nice hop .<ssssss>just very tasty i do not like hop for hop sake but when do right lot of hop can be good and this one be do right .<ssssss>i also find it very drinkable just extremely well do overall .<ssssss>one of ngne 's top offering .<ssssss>
8 4 7 7 8		appearance-pour a peachy gold color , mix well and a decent head that settle nicely , carbonation be not too much but a good amount of it .<ssssss>good look .<ssssss>smell-nose be lack , i do not detect too much , not very pronounced for a ipa especially .<ssssss>some strained effort reveal some hop aroma and malt , but quite subdue .<ssssss>taste-decent , alcohol be pronounced but mixed nicely with hop oil flavor , not much malt just oily hop to be have here .<ssssss>mouthfeel-light and smooth leave a hoppy aftertaste , pretty decent .<ssssss>drinkability-subdued and light for a ipa , easier to drink than some other of the style .<ssssss>overall-a fine craft ipa , lighter east coaste version of the style , solidly make if unspectacular .<ssssss>still this be a quite decent version from fly fish .<ssssss>
7 7 9 10 9		pour a nice , dark orange ; mellow glow around the edge .<ssssss>off-white , almost pearlescent foam that fizzle off quickly .<ssssss>no real , apparent carbonation ; lace well enough , not that it be particularly important .<ssssss>smell woodsy , piney , hoppy , a touch of sweetness to the scent .<ssssss>taste great - the best i have have in month .<ssssss>it be good to begin with , great toward the end .<ssssss>spicy hop create a small bite that be temper immediately with a moderate malt profile thereafter .<ssssss>citrusy finish , maybe lemon toward the back , and so rewarding .<ssssss>just so well-balanced , it be hard to say enough .<ssssss>feel great on the palate .<ssssss>smooth , well-balanced , not too much of a bite , not syrupy either .<ssssss>finish crisp and clear after every swig .<ssssss>extremely refreshing , better than all other pale ale i have have .<ssssss>the only disappointment here be that i only have one and that i finish it so fast .<ssssss>would certainly consider this a session beer if i live in oregon .<ssssss>extremely rewarding , i highly recommend this beer .<ssssss>
9 5 8 6 7		a - reddish mahogany hue , off-white head , huge blanket lacing .<ssssss>s - there be a unwelcome aroma in the nose , i do not write it down when i could specifically identify it , so as of now it be just a generally unwelcome aroma take down the overall dynamic .<ssssss>t - the taste be simply malt and hop , and quite unspectacular .<ssssss>the hop be nice on the outro , and that about sum up the highlight of the taste for I .<ssssss>m - big feel , viscous , well-carbonated .<ssssss>d - like a average sierra nevada product .<ssssss>yes , a average .<ssssss>i do not learn I not no nothing in school .<ssssss>that do not stop I from prepare for the ba misspelling bee , with my eye on the prize .<ssssss>
8 9 6 8 8		when it come to blueberry beer , i usally only drink one at a sit .<ssssss>this beer be easy to drink more then one of .<ssssss>the blueberry taste be definitely present , but not overbearing .<ssssss>the appearance be very light in color and the smell be of fresh blueberry plant .<ssssss>the beer be very light to drink and go down somewhat watery , but that be not necessarily a bad thing .<ssssss>the hop be very light so they be not in competition with the blueberry .<ssssss>not the greatest beer in the world , but as far as blueberry beer go , it be very nice to drink .<ssssss>
6 5 8 6 7		nitro tap to the rescue -- & gt ; i honestly do not believe that i be the first to have it this way .<ssssss>speak up people .<ssssss>appearance - a nice light tan cream head , which last to the end of the glass , what a nitro head deliver .<ssssss>the body be a pale red , but this be be generous .<ssssss>smell - a weak watery scent of roasted grain and slightly of caramel .<ssssss>taste - a soft grain feel with a hint of hop .<ssssss>some toast malt and nice roasted grain note , much better than the nose indicate .<ssssss>mouthfeel/drinkability - the nitro help reduce the body into a lighter creamer version of its former self and help smooth out the beer .<ssssss>it also have the tendecy to make it like water but sadly it do change this beer to much for the better .<ssssss>summary - the unloved child of the murphy 's family and for good reason .<ssssss>stick with other irish red .<ssssss>
7 6 8 5 6		small head formation , come up nearly white and about a quarter inch thick .<ssssss>chill on the top of the glass for a bit on top of a clear caramel body infuse with amber highlight .<ssssss>smell be not overly strong of hop , some floral and grassy , straw aroma dominate over some sweet caramel malt .<ssssss>lackluster really .<ssssss>taste ... ughhh ... its beer , but not very good beer .<ssssss>it have a dirty earthy flavor to it .<ssssss>not really any hop flavor profile .<ssssss>a little kick of bitterness which would be nice if this have some real flavor .<ssssss>i '' m gon na work on finish this one down , but its gon na be hard .<ssssss>mouthfeel be full though and a little creamy .<ssssss>its hard to get past the taste though and it definately bring the drinkability down .<ssssss>i be glad i buy only one .<ssssss>not weyerbacher 's best by any means ...<ssssss>
8 4 3 3 5		appearance : mahogany with ruby highlight and a clear body , this beer do not really look much like mud .<ssssss>pour a pleasant off-white creamy head that slowly settle into a creamy skin and then mild lacing .<ssssss>aroma : medium malt with some of the coffee and chocolate note you would expect from something that be half porter combine with hint of sweet , slightly hoppy lager - not much more here .<ssssss>taste : water down medium roasted malt body with a bit of dark fruit and the tang of cheap hop .<ssssss>it finish with hint of weird metallic tone -lrb- think shiner bock -rrb- .<ssssss>this do not resemble the real deal at all , it be closer to a shitty , watery macro attempt at a stout , porter or dark lager .<ssssss>mouthfeel : the mouthfeel be certainly nowhere near mud - fizzy , thin and watery .<ssssss>drinkability : easy enough to drink i suppose , but really , what be the point ?<ssssss>i do not even really want to drink the rest of this glass , let alone the two 32 ouncer in the fridge .<ssssss>verdict : watery and thin , with the lackluster taste to match , the brewery have some stone to call this `` mississippi mud , '' it be closer to st. loui runoff .<ssssss>i be assume that the `` continental lager '' mention on the bottle be clever code for a typical american macro-lager .<ssssss>and it certainly do taste like a middle-of-the-road , bland , porter mix with swill and give a fancy name .<ssssss>while i certainly do not expect this to be as good as a real b & t , i have at least hope it would be a somewhat decent analog .<ssssss>but alas , this beer let down it be awesome bottle , name and premise .<ssssss>all marketing , no beer .<ssssss>
8 3 7 6 6		amber in color with a light tan head that leave lace .<ssssss>aroma control by a strong vinegar like smell .<ssssss>whether this be intend to be this strong or not , i do not know , but i do not care for it either way .<ssssss>it seem unlikely this be intend to be present in this magnitude .<ssssss>a underlie sweet caramel malt flavor seem genuinley good , but again flavor that should be minimal or not present at all be too strong .<ssssss>a sour , acidic taste in line with the aroma be quite noticable .<ssssss>a slight plastic like flavor also seem to be present .<ssssss>i will work with the assumption that my bottle have see better day and that these flavor would be minimal or not present in a fresh bottle , but i have no idea .<ssssss>again , the flavor underneath these issue seem quite good .<ssssss>good mouthfeel that i knock down one notch due to the sourness of the beer .<ssssss>drinkability take a hit due to the acidic , sour aroma and taste .<ssssss>overall , i be left wonder how common or possibly even intend these off characteristic be in this beer .<ssssss>i would like to sample a bottle i know be fresh because the beer underneath seem good .<ssssss>
6 4 6 6 6		this one have be `` aging '' in my fridge for some time .<ssssss>age in the sense that it be leave in my house month ago and now need to be remove from the fridge to make room .<ssssss>here we go .<ssssss>appearance : clear and golden .<ssssss>very light in color , straw color .<ssssss>sudsy , soapy white head , two finger .<ssssss>ton of carbonation look like any other macro lager .<ssssss>effervescent smell : funky overcooked grain , corn husk , some kind of syrupy sweetness , not decipherable through the nose .<ssssss>taste : light , mildly sweet malt with corn-like taste .<ssssss>hop aroma .<ssssss>no discernible hop aroma or flavor .<ssssss>metallic , alcoholic aftertaste .<ssssss>mouthfeel : very light and easy to handle .<ssssss>almost leave this dry soapy finish in the mouth .<ssssss>drinability : not have too hard of a time get it down .<ssssss>for a macro lager -lrb- and on top of that a 40oz -rrb- not too bad .<ssssss>i would not drink this one if give a choice , but finish a glass be accomplish with relative ease .<ssssss>enjoy .<ssssss>
6 7 10 8 6		a - thin , yet long lasting 1/2 finger white head .<ssssss>very hazy , look a lot like apple cider .<ssssss>s - citric hop and sweeet malt .<ssssss>very sweet .<ssssss>cop a yeasty/alcohol undertone that i be not totally diggin .<ssssss>t - a definite hopbomb .<ssssss>not bad , though .<ssssss>semi-complex hop profile ... i be think my sample may be a little old .<ssssss>malt backbone be very very big , and noticeable .<ssssss>almost nutty .<ssssss>start bitter and piney , finish bitter and slightly metallic with huge malty sweetness through the last half of the sip .<ssssss>m - perfect .<ssssss>exactly how a dipa should be .<ssssss>thick but not syrupy , medium carbonation , slick and oily .<ssssss>can not get better .<ssssss>d - if it be not so big -lrb- abv-wise -rrb- , and do not have such a sweet maltiness , i would rate it a bit higher .<ssssss>it have the chance to get slightly cloying .<ssssss>i can see myself put down a bomber now and again if it be available , but i do not think i will be hunting for it .<ssssss>
8 6 5 6 2		probably the only beer from dragonmead i dont like .<ssssss>i be sure if you be into chille beer , then its probably good , but i be not .<ssssss>it look nice .<ssssss>clear red with little head .<ssssss>smell like pepper and spice , very interesting .<ssssss>it taste really good at first , spice and chille very obvious .<ssssss>but after i swallow it it burn my throat and my tongue .<ssssss>luckily it be only a sample .<ssssss>spicy !<ssssss>
3 5 4 7 6		a : light yellow and very clear .<ssssss>nice pour head , but disappear quite rapidly .<ssssss>s : i smell a little apple and citrus , slightly grainy .<ssssss>have a bread undertone .<ssssss>t : like most beer of this style its extremely hard to find some distinct taste to put you finger on .<ssssss>the malt be more prominant in this beer than many in the style .<ssssss>hop be non existant .<ssssss>if i have to name a few subtle taste it would be apple and citrus , but they be so faint that it isnt worth mention .<ssssss>slightly sour , but not to the extent some people have say .<ssssss>m : light , smooth , very easy go down .<ssssss>o : this beer be for nothing more than drinking on a hot summer day if the water company suddenly tell you that you local water supply be contaminate with parasitic ameoba .<ssssss>honestly , this beer isnt that bad .<ssssss>ive pay double this price for a single beer that i didnt enjoy as much as this beer 's sixpack -lrb- $ 2.99 7/18/11 -rrb- .<ssssss>and now i have 5 more .<ssssss>they will be save for a hot summer day outside .<ssssss>
6 8 5 6 7		a-beautiful reddish-brown color ; not much of a head : thin , carbonated , and disappointing .<ssssss>s-deep , flavorful ... .<ssssss>t-good !<ssssss>somewhat of a carbonated taste ; nothing very exciting here ?<ssssss>?<ssssss>?<ssssss>somewhat disappointing ; definitely taste the alcohol here .<ssssss>.<ssssss>m-rich , but again , there be that bubbly ... .<ssssss>d-yes , drinkable , but -lrb- once more , there be a slight carbonated , bubbly thing goin on here .<ssssss>so , i be very surprise by the high score of this beer !<ssssss>i must say , my taste bud may be off ... .<ssssss>it be summer , i have be drink a keg of brooklyn summer ale ... .<ssssss>i will have to come back to this beer and try again in a week or two ; - -rcb-<ssssss>
6 6 8 10 9		a - look like beer , wtf do i care ?<ssssss>s - no smell really to speak of , maybe a little nutty t-absolutely surprised , this taste fantastic .<ssssss>nutty , not really bitter in my opinion so it be a bit of surprise from the style .<ssssss>you can definitely taste the alcohol , but in a good way .<ssssss>finish witha bit of a smoky flavor .<ssssss>m - very light , almost watery .<ssssss>d - awesome beer , especially between a couple of hop monster .<ssssss>the alcohol be not too apparent in the flavor and the nutty/smokiness make this one i could session .<ssssss>
7 6 7 4 3		pour a strangely transparant , headless pale yellow color into my pilsner glass .<ssssss>the only thing obscure my vision be the steady traffic of carbonation bubble on they way to not reinforce the invisible head .<ssssss>nose be also a bit off ; it have wheat , it have spice , but it also have a vague noxious graininess that take a bit away from the appeal .<ssssss>wow .<ssssss>something 's not right here in the taste either .<ssssss>broad , sweeping citrus and wheat flavor but something unidentified be make I wince as i sip it and i be consider not finish it .<ssssss>it be some kind of artificial tasting late breaking yeast note that just stop I in my track .<ssssss>mouthfeel be fine but this one definitely do not agree with I and i will not be try it again .<ssssss>
8 7 9 9 7		appearance : hazy pale yellow in color with a 1/2 '' head that last a while .<ssssss>light lacing paint the glass .<ssssss>smell : spice and green apple be most noticeable , some softer earthy tone be in the background .<ssssss>taste : caramel , yeast , pepper , green apple , pear , and a strong warming alcohol be the main flavor component .<ssssss>bitterness be mild .<ssssss>mouthfeel : lightly crisp throughout .<ssssss>medium body beer .<ssssss>aftertaste be dominate by alcohol warming .<ssssss>drinkability : very flavorful beer that be a slow sipper base on the alcohol level .<ssssss>
7 4 7 7 7		this pour a straw yellow with a large white head , not bad , but alittle on the `` too yellow '' side .<ssssss>the smell be really very light , almost no scent at all .<ssssss>the only smell at all be malt and lemon , but that be a real stretch .<ssssss>the taste be light , crisp , and malty .<ssssss>there be some floral and lemon flavor , but not much .<ssssss>the m/f be light and well balanced .<ssssss>this be a ok blonde , but let 's face it , with a blonde you be not get much and this beer live up to that .<ssssss>
7 7 6 8 9		appearance : dark brown with very quick fading light tan head .<ssssss>smell : clean licorice with coffee and barley taste : more coffee in taste than smell .<ssssss>i wish the taste be a little closer to the smell as i have high hope for more licorice .<ssssss>some alcohol note towards end .<ssssss>nice porter aftertaste .<ssssss>not too dirty but dirt be in there .<ssssss>mouthfeel : light for darker beer .<ssssss>nothing special .<ssssss>i would think there would have be a little more heft in to it to compliment flavor .<ssssss>drinkability : you could drink these bad boy all night and work a clean buzz .<ssssss>but as in mouthfeel , nothing here will blow you brain out .<ssssss>overall a decent beer that be worth a shot .<ssssss>i would not go out of my way to find it or share with friend but would still choose it over some other lighter porter on market .<ssssss>
9 9 7 6 8		thanks to glazeman for the can !<ssssss>pour into a goose island pint glass .<ssssss>daisy cutter form a beautiful , fluffy , white head that be almost three finger thick .<ssssss>the body be a hazy peach orange .<ssssss>sticky webbed lacing .<ssssss>grassy hop and light grapefruit citrus on the nose .<ssssss>earthy and somewhat piny with sweet malt in the background .<ssssss>quite good for a regular apa .<ssssss>slightly burnt caramel malt and a bit grainy with grassy hop on the tongue .<ssssss>decent taste , but it do not quite live up to the appearance or the nose .<ssssss>grainy , somewhat bitter/astringent .<ssssss>average for the most part .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit foamy with sharp carbonation .<ssssss>i would call this crisp , but the foaminess get in the way a bit .<ssssss>have some nice linger bitterness .<ssssss>drinkability be good .<ssssss>this beer have a decent amount of hop for a apa and the nose be quite nice , but the flavor and mouthfeel do not offer enough to really set this beer apart .<ssssss>maybe a fresh pint on-tap turn thing up a notch or two .<ssssss>
7 4 6 3 3		bottle purchase on a recent trip to montreal .<ssssss>pour in to duvel tulip .<ssssss>no freshness information be evident .<ssssss>a - pour a medium amber colour , very slightly translucent with two finger of bubbly , white head .<ssssss>s - very noticeable sweet caramel malt hit the nose initially with some pine and very muted citrus note evident from the hop .<ssssss>the citrus be so muted that i wonder if i would have even detect it have i not know that this be a cascade hop ipa .<ssssss>smell like a bottle that be far from fresh .<ssssss>t - some bitterness up front with a very heavy sweet caramel malt presence .<ssssss>virtually no flavour contribution form the hop at all .<ssssss>none of the great citrus flavour of the cascade hop be evident here , which be disappointing .<ssssss>clearly a bottle that be no fresh .<ssssss>m - light body , moderate carbonation .<ssssss>o - this bottle be clearly past it prime .<ssssss>if a brewery choose not to put freshness info on they bottle , they be fair game for review to be post imo .<ssssss>i would not have waste my money on this bottle have i know that this be a old bottle .<ssssss>
10 7 6 8 6		appearance be excellent - reddish color with excellent head size and constant carbonation , even after 20 minute , bubble be still rise .<ssssss>smell be that of hop and some spruce which lend it a christmasy aura but i would not recommend it as a year-round smell .<ssssss>taste like hop , spruce , and some malt ... overall , it be a nice flavor , especially for a seasonal beer but it be quite different from other seasonal i have try .<ssssss>one high point - this be not spice quite as heavily ... i would say that the spruce be the only `` spice '' .<ssssss>the only downfall in my opinion be that both the mouthfeel and drinkability be not great .<ssssss>it give you a bit of a kick but not in a good way when you have it swirl around in you mouth .<ssssss>it also be not a easy beer for I to drink quite smoothly .<ssssss>
8 8 8 6 7		i have hear quite a bit about this brewery and be anxious to try this beer .<ssssss>i have this out of a 22 oz .<ssssss>this pour a nice golden color with a slight haze .<ssssss>the smell have a wonderful hop forward character that i really enjoy .<ssssss>this be a really big beer and unfortunately the abv be not mask very will .<ssssss>with 102 ibu 's you think it would be but i think a little more malt character would have make this great .<ssssss>overall i enjoy it but i expect a little more balanced ipa .<ssssss>

9 8 8 5 4		22oz bottle from martignettus 's appearance = great look dark , transparent , ruby-red brown .<ssssss>good 3/4 '' inch head which last substantially .<ssssss>ok lacing .<ssssss>smell = lot of spice and fruit with a high bit of alcohol come through .<ssssss>i smell cherry and plum mostly .<ssssss>a bit too pungent but still good .<ssssss>taste = i think this beer would be so much better if it have less of a abv % .<ssssss>the flavor be initially very good with a sweet , malty fruity mix but then the alcohol come and it just overpower everything else .<ssssss>i do enjoy high abv beer but they have to be do really well and the brewer need to make sure the alcohol do not dominate everything else .<ssssss>this beer fail at that and bring the taste and drinkability score way down .<ssssss>overall = i like a lot of thing about this beer but i can not recommend it .<ssssss>i just do not think they do a good enough job of mix the alcohol in with the rest of the flavor .<ssssss>
7 6 8 9 8		import from my ratebeer.com profile - feb 17 , 2008 on tap at the coronado brewing company .<ssssss>its a cloudy golden color with particle and a small amount of head .<ssssss>smell very much like lime , with some hint of spice and wheat .<ssssss>very interesting flavor to this beer because of the use of lime instead of orange , dont need the extra lime they give you , just enjoy the beer as it be .<ssssss>its light and tangy with a very nice lime aftertaste .<ssssss>i think this would go great with chicken or fish .<ssssss>
7 7 10 7 8		pour pitch black with a thin , maybe a cm or so , brown head , which leave a little lacing here and there .<ssssss>look pretty standard for the style .<ssssss>the smell seem to be overpower with alcohol , with a bid of roastiness .<ssssss>kind of like bad coffee , mix in with the smell of black patent malt .<ssssss>not a bad smell , but seem a bit harsh for a oatmeal stout .<ssssss>i kind of expect to smell more sweetness .<ssssss>the taste be much better than the smell suggest .<ssssss>there be immediately the oatmeal taste , i mean not like a bowl of oatmeal , but like beer oatmeal , if you know the taste .<ssssss>the taste kind of have the old , low quality coffee taste from the smell , which i guess come from a low dose of roasted barley .<ssssss>i would like to taste a bit more .<ssssss>i can also notice this oiliness , which i think come from black patent malt , which be pleasant in low dose .<ssssss>i can also get this chocolate taste , kind of tone down , but i think its at the right level with the oatmeal add .<ssssss>if i could make any suggestion , it would be to substitute some roast barley for the black patent , and i will hold off a higher rating for that .<ssssss>the mouthfeel , as you would expect from a oatmeal stout , be spot on .<ssssss>so smooth and creamy .<ssssss>with just the right amount of sweetness .<ssssss>this do not even need carbonation , but its delightful .<ssssss>and i be sure i could drink this for hour .<ssssss>i just keep reach back , and nothing slow I down .<ssssss>

6 6 8 4 4		ok , i finally get around to tasting this beer .<ssssss>i do not know if it be the clear bottle , or if this just be not a very good beer , but i swear , it taste just like malt liquor .<ssssss>i have have some pretty skunked bottle of newcastle that have a similar flavor .<ssssss>so i will give they the benefit of the doubt and say that i probably get a bad bottle -- but , i can say for sure i will not ever buy it again , because if they do not respect they beer enough to put it in a brown bottle , i sure as hell be not gon na pay $ 5 for another bottle of potential skunk-juice .<ssssss>

8 8 7 9 7		small bottle , 16/05/08 date on the rear label .<ssssss>pour cloudy , mahogony , with a long lasting medium tan head , plenty of sticky lacing .<ssssss>allow to warm for about 30 min .<ssssss>nose of raisin , fig , cola .<ssssss>seem pretty highly carbonate on the tongue .<ssssss>flavor note of more raisin , fig , more cola , and some rum also pick up .<ssssss>dry and slightly chalky in the finish .<ssssss>tasty and complex brew , but kind of expensive , -lrb- over $ 4 for the 11.2 ouncer -rrb- a nice treat , but other choice abound and i be not sure how often i will go for this one in the future .<ssssss>

10 6 8 5 4		bomber , bottled on 3/9/10 , pour into a wheat beer glass -lrb- review in october -rrb- .<ssssss>i be go to say this right off the bat , i do not like this beer ... at all .<ssssss>consider the fact that i love they hefeweizen and hefeweizen dark i be willing to give weihenstephaner the benefit of the doubt and believe i might have get a battle or old bottle .<ssssss>a : look exactly like the hefeweissbier , dark golden color , hazy , massive 3-finger foamy head that last forever and leave good lacing .<ssssss>s : right away i know either something be wrong or this be not for I .<ssssss>the banana and over-ripe fruit be just way to strong .<ssssss>it smell like someone stick a 2 week old black banana up my nose .<ssssss>i know there be some other flavor and spice in there , but it just do not come through .<ssssss>t : oh yeah , way to robust .<ssssss>i like bold flavored beer , but this just taste like a old banana .<ssssss>i can taste some other fruit , bread , yeast , and ester when the initial burst mellow out , but it be still really sweet and old tasting .<ssssss>m : i give this a 4.0 because although i do not like the taste , the mouth feel be pretty much the same as the hefe .<ssssss>d : i could not finish this and end up pour out that last 1/3 of the glass .<ssssss>i really want to try a fresh bottle of this again because i love wweihenstephaner and it just do not seem right .<ssssss>
7 4 5 6 6		pour a hazy grapefruit color with a decent -lrb- controlled -rrb- head and great lace .<ssssss>smell be mia with just the faintest hint of citrus , malt amd banana .<ssssss>taste be betteer , with malt , grapefruit , banana and light hop .<ssssss>hop fade to banana in the aftertaste and get a bit cloying .<ssssss>a medium body ale , ok to drink but i would not recommend or repeat .<ssssss>
5 5 3 4 6		12oz bottle take home from volunteer at the 2011 abcf .<ssssss>this one be marked best by september 2011 , and be pour into my duvel tulip .<ssssss>dubbel cannon pour a relatively clear light amber , with some orange highlight come through .<ssssss>the slightly off white head come up to about two finger in height , before quickly fading and leave no lacing behind .<ssssss>belgian and ipa be where i find some of the best head formation/retention and lacing , and so this one be a real letdown in the look department .<ssssss>the nose have a prominent candi sweetness that be a staple of belgian brew , and any hoppy note be drown out by some fruity and slightly spicy yeast ester and phenol .<ssssss>that same sugary sweetness be the first thing to greet my palate .<ssssss>next be probably the most restrained , muted dose of bitterness i have ever find in a ipa .<ssssss>the yeast byproduct lean more towards fruity than spicy in the flavor , and let just a little bit of citrus hoppiness shine through .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be absurdly syupy for a belgian/ipa hybrid .<ssssss>the body be a bit too full/present , and the carbonation start out lackluster and fade to barely present as the beer warm .<ssssss>i feel a little bad rating so harshly , because dubbel cannon do not taste awful or anything , but it be just either so far remove or poorly execute stylistically that the result score be not pretty .<ssssss>
6 5 6 3 3		devil dancer serve in dfh signature glass a : pour clear amber .<ssssss>s : initially , i smell pungent citrus and floral hop and hop detergent .<ssssss>alcohol .<ssssss>after take a drink , i pick up on herb , green onion and garlic .<ssssss>t : sweet caramel up front .<ssssss>the taste of devil dancer be dominate by herb , green onion , onion and garlic .<ssssss>i be sure summit hop be use as late addition .<ssssss>some vague tropical and flower hop note try to power through , but they be too weak .<ssssss>alcohol be quite prevalent .<ssssss>bitterness be crank up .<ssssss>finish be green onion and weed .<ssssss>m : big body and light carbonation .<ssssss>warm .<ssssss>slick mouthfeel .<ssssss>a little grittiness on enamel .<ssssss>o : this be the third year i have drink fresh devil dancer , and the previous two year i do not pick up on the overabundance of summit hop .<ssssss>either my palate or the recipe change .<ssssss>no matter the cause of the change , the effect be the same .<ssssss>i can not stomach this beer .<ssssss>i have read that the oniony character can drop out over time .<ssssss>i pray this be true .<ssssss>
8 4 5 5 7		taste in a bottle .<ssssss>the drink by date state the beer be good until july 2008 .<ssssss>this be a quality beer with a couple small flaw in my opinion .<ssssss>appearance good enough with a nice chill haze .<ssssss>average head retention .<ssssss>smell and taste of butter very strong here - possibly oxidize ?<ssssss>?<ssssss>i like irish red and this certainly live up to the style .<ssssss>very drinkable .<ssssss>soft mouth feel .<ssssss>certainly a ` better beer ' - but for my personal taste it have too much butter taste and after taste to be a ` great beer ' .<ssssss>
6 8 4 6 7		aroma be of juicy grapefruit and some pine .<ssssss>classic sierra nevada nose .<ssssss>the taste follow the nose with light toasty malt , some sweet caramel malt but mostly it be about the juicy hop .<ssssss>lot of grapefruit and a touch of resiny pine .<ssssss>linger wet-hop juicy bitterness , a little too much for my liking .<ssssss>wet hop ale should be more about aroma in my opinion .<ssssss>moderate carbonation , good creaminess .<ssssss>call it medium in heft .<ssssss>overall this be a decent beer , but it be disappointing because it be so similar to so many other sierra nevada offering and because of the price point , really not worth the extra dollar in my opinion .<ssssss>worth a go i guess just to say that you try it and i appreciate the value of a decent organic offering as well .<ssssss>
6 6 8 6 7		this brew pour a small head of fine to large size white bubble and amber orange transparent body .<ssssss>it have a strong hoppy aroma and a strong hoppy flavor to boot .<ssssss>it have a initial hop flavor and a strong hop finish .<ssssss>you can summarize the brew in 1 word !<ssssss>hoppy .<ssssss>a true hophead delight .<ssssss>

10 8 9 9 5		a - extremely dark .<ssssss>very thin , dark caramel head - short live .<ssssss>s - it smell mildly boozy .<ssssss>not very complex .<ssssss>sort of `` flat '' on any special note .<ssssss>t - very mellow .<ssssss>bourbon dominate , but it do taste like a fine stout after all be say and do ... m - very silky .<ssssss>everything fit in just nice .<ssssss>d - need to be sip .<ssssss>overpower sweetness and alcohol burn get to I after half a glass .<ssssss>one bottle = 2 people i would say .<ssssss>not as much coffee taste as kentucky breakfast stout -lrb- i much prefer the kb -rrb- .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i be go to lay this down in the cellar for a few year to see if it mellow at all ...<ssssss>
7 4 8 8 7		appearance : pour a clear copper color with a modest head that drop quickly and fail to stick smell : a dirty vegetal aroma , unfortunately taste : despite the funky aroma , the beer open with a malty graham cracker flavor ; after the swallow , a slight bitterness kick in but the overall flavor profile be on the malty side , as it should be mouthfeel : medium body with moderate carbonation drinkability : although that aroma be pretty foul , the taste more than make up for it ; a decent oktoberfest<ssssss>
7 8 6 5 6		rich amber color with some white head .<ssssss>smell be big piney hop at first , which mellow out a big , and give way to a bit of sweetness and light alcohol in the aroma .<ssssss>taste be a nice hop flavor , fruity sweetness , and some noticeable alcohol , but not overwhelmingly so .<ssssss>good flavor , and a nice beer , but i be not a big fan of tasting the alcohol .<ssssss>but for the style , this be defintely pretty good , for I , and i imagine much better for other who really like the style .<ssssss>

8 8 10 7 8		find on cask at fitger 's in august of '07 .<ssssss>this beer come a slightly cloudy honey color with a thin film of off-white head that leave slight stripe of lace .<ssssss>smell of fruity peach , kiwi and red grapefruit .<ssssss>nice .<ssssss>the same fruit come through in the taste with a bit more strawberry , but with some rye and white flour .<ssssss>in the finish come a little bleached paper .<ssssss>feel light and clean , but dense and substantial give it a slick feel .<ssssss>a good beer for sure .<ssssss>tasty , clean and drinkable .<ssssss>
6 8 6 4 6		another entry into leinenkugel chick beer marketing scheme.it pour a cloudy slight orange with a somewhat fluffy head , artificial all the way through nothing seem to be balance at all here way too fruity most people say it taste like fruity pebble and i agree virtually no balancing bitterness , smell very similar to how it taste .<ssssss>just too fruity for I .<ssssss>
9 10 10 8 2		a - beautiful crystal clear honey color with mild white lace .<ssssss>s - honey , raisin , toast , biscuit , almond , barley , alcohol , cane sugar , vanilla , fruit .<ssssss>ultra-complex ... and if they make a perfume like this i would jump the woman wear it .<ssssss>t - wild .<ssssss>very spicy , very alcoholic .<ssssss>peppery and sweet with fusel alcohol that kick and warm .<ssssss>sweet linger finish .<ssssss>m - slightly carbonate , but silky-smooth and slick on the tongue .<ssssss>a very slight linger dryness due to the alcohol , which be overshadow by the honey-sweet overall finish .<ssssss>d - it be so complex , so sweet , and so alcoholic , that you can not drink much ... unless you be a fan of beer such as eku 28 .<ssssss>if you get the chance , try this beer .<ssssss>but share it .<ssssss>
8 4 8 6 7		appearance - dark with purple hughe .<ssssss>the tan head have a `` rubiness '' hue to it .<ssssss>the head last all the way down .<ssssss>smell - aroma of macro lager , smell like it be right out of the can .<ssssss>taste - bitter stout bite in the beginning .<ssssss>trail off to port-like aftertaste .<ssssss>mouthfeel - medium body , good carbonation .<ssssss>drinkability - i would not go out of my way for this .<ssssss>
6 7 10 9 9		pour a light clear golden.sudsy head that diminish but leave broken lace all the way through .<ssssss>fruity/malty nose .<ssssss>malty profile with enough hop to round it out nicely , slightly spicy.smooth aftertaste .<ssssss>great , creamy mouthfeel .<ssssss>drinkability be very good on this , a great example of the style .<ssssss>
6 10 7 8 10		this be a great tasting beer .<ssssss>it be sweet and mild with just the right amount of hop in this beer drinker 's opinion .<ssssss>it remind I of the warrant video `` cherry pie '' for some odd reason .<ssssss>it go great with cheese , pretzel , and i would imagine dessert .<ssssss>highly drinkable , highly recommend .<ssssss>
8 8 6 5 5		lot of head and some lacing , color nectarine and sienna with little carbonation .<ssssss>the head hang on and on and on .<ssssss>even before i really start sniff , i get whiff of a huge floral nose , especially strong grapefruit scent and hint of cream .<ssssss>down the hatch .<ssssss>in one word , it be hoppy , specially in the aftertaste the floral scent do not carry through onto the palate ... it be more bitter and less sweet .<ssssss>in general , there be not much to match the hop .<ssssss>liquid hop in the mouth with trace maltiness .<ssssss>for true hop head this would be heaven .<ssssss>for I it be a little too unbalanced .<ssssss>the ` herculean ' hop be not a joke .<ssssss>overall , this have a full , strong body in the mouth and reasonable drinkability for something this strong .<ssssss>i would recommend this to only the most diehard hophead .<ssssss>
6 5 8 5 6		a.poured a clear golden color into a pint glass .<ssssss>small , lasting white head with good lacing on the glass .<ssssss>s. light malt , some hop , slightly earthy .<ssssss>t. nothing outstanding , slightly sweet , decent bitterness from the hop .<ssssss>taste like one of the big beer company beer .<ssssss>m. probably the best attribute of the beer .<ssssss>light body perfectly carbonate .<ssssss>great texture on the tongue .<ssssss>d. really remind I of miller .<ssssss>
9 10 8 8 9		really great dipa !<ssssss>appearance - nice red-orange color , off-white head .<ssssss>i give it a 4.5 because the color be what i would expect from a dipa ... i guess i do not give it a 5 because the appearance be not something that catch my attention .<ssssss>mine do pour clear , which do not seem to be the trend from this brew ... but hey , that be what i get .<ssssss>smell - this be the most unique , and my favorite part of the beer !<ssssss>citrusy , oaky ... almost strawberry like .<ssssss>the smell of this brew make I want to drink it .<ssssss>taste - great !<ssssss>it be a wonderful tasting brew , it be not a dipa that i instantly say , `` this be the best i have ever have ! ''<ssssss>but , pretty darn close ... hence the not 5 score .<ssssss>mouthfeel - okay ... at 13.6 % , we would expect it to be a bit syrup-like , but i think it be just a little too much for my taste .<ssssss>overall - really really great brew , just short of be great ... again , in my opinion .<ssssss>that be say ... i will probably grab another bottle next time i be at the local brew store .<ssssss>: -rrb-<ssssss>
5 4 8 5 8		as folk would probably expect give this beer 's `` stats '' , it be pretty watery .<ssssss>however , that be just the nature of the game for a ultra-light .<ssssss>the taste be a bit sweet .<ssssss>i be not sure all the review be go to reflect that , because of the overall water to taste ratio , but if you think about what make up the actual taste itself , there be a lot of sweetness relative to anything else that be there .<ssssss>there be a little something in there that remind of skim milk .<ssssss>it be not really a milky taste , there be obviously no dairy in this , but i think it be possible that some of the process use to produce it or to cut calorie may be similar to skim milk .<ssssss>there be almost no appreciable smell , and what be there do not really smell like beer -lrb- though it do not really smell bad either , kind of neutral -rrb- , but , in fairness to the folk at miller , i have some nasal congestion while drink this .<ssssss>appearance be about what you would expect for a ulta-light , nice look in it be own way , but just kind of like water with a mild yellowish tint .<ssssss>it do not have much of a head .<ssssss>i think they do a pretty good job for what they be try to do .<ssssss>when you consider the unprecedentedly low calorie count , and the rock bottom carb count , it be kind of amazing that they manage to make something that a -rrb- kind of taste like beer and b -rrb- do not have any disgusting off-taste to it .<ssssss>i be actually kind of impressed .<ssssss>if you be just watch carb , michelob ultra have a similar carb count and taste a bit more like a typical beer than this do .<ssssss>if calorie be what be important to you , though , this have more than 30 calorie less than most light beer from the `` big three '' brewer , and be recognizably beer , albeit probably not the best example of beer in the world .<ssssss>it be definitely drinkable -- and might hold some folk cut a few pound .<ssssss>i definitely see a place for this beer in the market and be glad they make it .<ssssss>
8 8 9 9 6		have this on tap at the great lakes ba blackout release party and be review from my note that i take while meet some new beeradvocate friend .<ssssss>remembered have this one the previous year at the gabf and be very excite to try it again .<ssssss>live up to my memory and expectation .<ssssss>appearance - pour a hazy amber into first my five ounce sampler and a subsequent 9oz snifterful as well .<ssssss>minimal ring of head around the edge of the glass , but a fair amount of mild , evenly distribute carbonation bead up the glass .<ssssss>oddly , i do not remember this one be a shade of amber , but it be in fact the same beer .<ssssss>smell - nice nose .<ssssss>smell heavily of vanilla and oak with some bourbon and a touch of leather come through as well .<ssssss>very rich and sweet smell .<ssssss>taste - hugely prominent vanilla and wood for I here .<ssssss>the bourbon really come across as vanilla forward for I , but the oak have really smooth everything out here .<ssssss>more complex note of perhaps a mild tobacco , along with the leather i detect earlier in the nose .<ssssss>very sweet but blend together very well .<ssssss>almost taste like a liqueur .<ssssss>mouthfeel/drinkability - the mouthfeel on this one be really outstanding .<ssssss>silky smooth , rich , and substantial .<ssssss>however , despite how much i like this one , i can not really give it high mark on drinkability .<ssssss>it be very very sweet and not conducive to drink more than one really .<ssssss>that be say , i really like this beer .<ssssss>overall , excellent .<ssssss>i really like this one as a dessert beer or a nightcap .<ssssss>i wish they would bottle this and sell it along with the ba blackout .<ssssss>
9 6 7 8 8		this beer pour a very nice , clear , burnt orange color with a huge , off-white head that leave a ton of lacing .<ssssss>it look very nice !<ssssss>the smell be not as great as i would think .<ssssss>mostly herbal/piney hop .<ssssss>however , there be also a bit of a sour smell that i be not really digging .<ssssss>the taste be good , with caramel up front and a very smooth bitterness .<ssssss>the bitterness tend to build throughout the bottle , which can become a little overwhelming , but it be still really good .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be medium with very low carbonation , which seem odd after that huge head .<ssssss>though not quite as good as sn 's regular harvest ale , this thing be pretty darn drinkable .<ssssss>
6 4 5 6 8		a - very typical of the style .<ssssss>light straw color , little head and not much retention .<ssssss>average .<ssssss>s - skunky smell .<ssssss>smell like a cheap adjunct other than that though .<ssssss>t - vary a lot .<ssssss>pretty good in my opinion if you buy it in the 12 pack box .<ssssss>i think that keep the light out of it .<ssssss>not terrible in a 6-pack , but pretty skunk .<ssssss>do not buy this as a single unless you want to kno what a skunky beer taste like .<ssssss>if it be not skunk though this be actually a above average adjunct .<ssssss>have a nice hop character and balance for the style .<ssssss>good in can if you can find they .<ssssss>m - too much carbonation .<ssssss>otherwise avg for the style .<ssssss>d - very drinkable just like most adjunct .<ssssss>overall i think this beer get a undeserved bad reputation .<ssssss>if it be the skunk taste that get you , give it a try in can if you can find it , really above average taste for a macro adjunct .<ssssss>can be a little pricy for what it be though .<ssssss>

8 9 8 6 6		a-pale straw cloudy yellow with a lot of frothy white head s-fresh and spicy belgian that remind I of wheat .<ssssss>very good , strong scent with some funkiness .<ssssss>almost ideal for a saison t-a very short experience .<ssssss>come in with the belgian spice and some banana .<ssssss>there be a slight breadiness taste with some bitterness for the after-taste .<ssssss>the bitterness be odd and not completely likeable .<ssssss>its a okay taste , but definitely nothing special .<ssssss>m-medium creamy carbonation with a dry finish o-i find that the belgian spiciness make this not very drinkable .<ssssss>i like it in other belgian , but in this the taste get tire .<ssssss>this be pretty much a average saison that i do not feel be great for the style .<ssssss>i would not recommend this to people more accustomed to the style , but that be just I .<ssssss>

7 4 6 6 8		brew pour with about a half-inch frothy head , which quickly dissipate .<ssssss>this amber lager be absolutely spot-on in it be amber color - no misnaming of this brew !<ssssss>smell be largely abscent - faintest hint of a lagery-malty sweetness , with perhaps a atom or two of hop essence fill out the boutique .<ssssss>taste be a bit better , a overall very pleasant lager .<ssssss>the lager-yeasty taste in this beer be nicely balance with a almost-perceptible hop backbone .<ssssss>still come off as a domminant sweet beer .<ssssss>mouthfeel be fairly pleasant , with many taste-bud work -lrb- albeit not very hard -rrb- to sample the brew .<ssssss>beer be very easy to drink , and be fairly pleasant to do so .<ssssss>this would be a perfect beer to have at a ballpark or on the back deck on a late spring or early fall day .<ssssss>
6 9 6 7 7		pour a hazy orange with a thick head that disappear and leave no lacing and only sparse bubble that cling to the side .<ssssss>some floaty in the glass , maybe some yeast or protein coagulation .<ssssss>smell be really interesting .<ssssss>lot of pear and grape , note of honey - quite intriguing .<ssssss>taste be somewhat tart and then finish in a white grape taste .<ssssss>some residual sweetness linger on the tongue .<ssssss>seem like more carbonation would benefit this beer as the mouthfeel be a bit thin to carry the alcohol effectively .<ssssss>definitely a interesting beer , but one that might be a bit of a challenge to down the whole bottle by myself .<ssssss>
6 6 8 5 8		not really sure what to think about this beer .<ssssss>it pour a very unimpressive head yet it be full of bubble , odd .<ssssss>it be very dark amber , not much light get through so it might as well be black .<ssssss>the smell be pretty weak , nothing to talk about imo .<ssssss>the taste be not bad , it be just not interesting or good .<ssssss>it be toasty which can be good but in of itself be not anything special .<ssssss>it be get another sort of fruit flavored -lrb- mostly just a weak sweat flavor -rrb- .<ssssss>the bubble and light flavor work well in the mouth if you want a beer to drink a few of .<ssssss>i could definately drink a lot of these if i like the flavor more .<ssssss>i mean it be not bad ... i could definately drink a 6 pack if i have it around .<ssssss>
6 8 10 9 9		a - very strong bone white head ; nice cloudy light yellow color s - solid aroma ; very fresh smell , bubblegumy t - light pleasant , nicely balanced sweet with a small bitter bite m - light bubbley and smooth d - very strong drinkablity , nice and light<ssssss>
9 9 9 7 8		a - pour a deep reddish brown , fill the glass with impose blackness .<ssssss>it create a huge brown head with some diversity between medium-small and medium bubble that recede slowly .<ssssss>s - from afar , there be a lot of chocolate in the nose , and up close there be quite a bit still .<ssssss>but it add some dark fruit , really prominent wood note , and a bit of heat from the pepper .<ssssss>t - wow - this be interesting .<ssssss>the oak come out through the whole time you have it .<ssssss>the heat from the cayenne really come through on the finish , and you have it stick to the back of you mouth once you have swallow .<ssssss>i have to say , though , that i do not get a lot of chocolate here .<ssssss>for a chocolate stout , the chocolate from the nose be way out of balance with the chocolate in the mouth , and that be kind of disappointing .<ssssss>there be a hint of it , but i really get more of the cayenne than chocolate , which i like , but i do not think this be a great taste for something that be call a chocolate stout .<ssssss>edit : as it warm , the chocolate come out a bit more on the side of the tongue .<ssssss>m - it be a pretty nice feeling beer , nice and creamy , not too robust , and the carbonation be not kill you .<ssssss>it be full , but not offensive .<ssssss>d - i like drinking this , but it be a little too powerful to be exceptionally drinkable .<ssssss>the heat from the cayenne that stick in you mouth do make you want another sip , and the combined heat with the alcohol do have a pleasant warming effect as it go down .<ssssss>

8 7 8 6 9		i be a bit confused with a single hop east kent golding and the american ipa style .<ssssss>seem this would be closer to english style .<ssssss>since the bottle state a/ipa , i will go with that .<ssssss>a bit hazey , dull orange body top with a rather nice look , semi-rocky head .<ssssss>very nice lacing , boost the score here .<ssssss>aromatic .<ssssss>nothing strong , which counter the a/ipa claim .<ssssss>a green pine and light citrus surround the edge of a biscuit center .<ssssss>more malt than i think there would be .<ssssss>taste follow the nose .<ssssss>pine , but not dry .<ssssss>citrus , but not juicy .<ssssss>malt be the center piece , although it do not demand attention .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be what save this from be a disaster .<ssssss>and save it quite well .<ssssss>more bitey than i think it would be .<ssssss>give it a crispness that cut through the malt .<ssssss>end up be quite a nice beer .<ssssss>this one do not last long in the glass .<ssssss>

8 9 7 10 9		hop stoopid bear the intensely grapefruit-and-pine bitter aroma of a good ipa , mix with a healthy dose of sugary rosewater , peach , apricot , brown sugar , and vanilla .<ssssss>judge by smell alone , this be a high-quality beverage , as indicate by the breadth and depth of sugar and bitter aroma .<ssssss>on the tongue , the brew begin with a brief sugary blast -- which last for about 1/4 second -- then the hop kick in and the tastebud curl in bitter joy .<ssssss>huge grapefruit and pine note dominate the brew , the result of the massive 102 ibus .<ssssss>beneath the hop , however , lie a equally flavorful beer , complete with apricot and pecan , fig and lychee nut , and good hint of biscuity , grape nut cereal-like toast grain .<ssssss>the aftertaste be largely hop -lrb- as should be expect -rrb- , and linger for quite a while .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium-light , and carbonation be medium .<ssssss>overall , this be a solid ipa , and hop lover will surely rejoice at its brobdingnagian bitterness , but it be also a good beer in its own right .<ssssss>well worth try .<ssssss>

8 7 5 8 6		a-deep , dark lack/brown with a massive , effervescent tan head that slowly reduce to a thin cap of retention and leave decorative lace .<ssssss>s-light chocolate malt , touch of sweet caramel , a hint of coffee and even a little damp earth .<ssssss>nice but all of this be rather light .<ssssss>t-much like the aroma with a decent dose of bittersweet chocolate , sweet caramel malt , earthy hop and even a subtle hit of anise in the dry , chalky finish .<ssssss>m-medium-light body and disappointingly thin .<ssssss>this lack the robustness i like when enjoy a porter .<ssssss>to much carbonation and lack of body bring this one down .<ssssss>d-decent but need some tweaking .<ssssss>good flavour profile but lack of aroma and wimpy body make this one drinkable but certainly not memorable .<ssssss>

7 7 8 6 4		pour a dark brown with one finger of tan head that dissipate quickly .<ssssss>the beer itself be a mix of ruby red and amber when view in light .<ssssss>smell very sweet , reminiscent of a imperial stout .<ssssss>alcohol and smokiness be prevalent .<ssssss>in the background be a wooden smell , accompany by a fruitiness that provide balance to the overly sweet aroma .<ssssss>taste be of smoke and alcohol , with some hop throw in .<ssssss>not much do here to mask the alcohol .<ssssss>the smoked flavor be much stronger then the aroma let on .<ssssss>hop show through the other flavor , but do not become the focus at any point .<ssssss>there be sweetness from the malt here , but the malt themselves be somewhat absent , possibly overwhelm by the smoked flavor .<ssssss>aftertaste be of smokey hop .<ssssss>very smokey hop .<ssssss>mouthfeel be of alcohol .<ssssss>the brew itself be medium-heavy body , with a very clean finish .<ssssss>drinkability be not this brew strong point .<ssssss>this beer be clean as far as mouth feel go , but be not as forgiving to the throat on the way down .<ssssss>overall , this be a very smokey brew .<ssssss>more so then the smell imply .<ssssss>fan of smokey brew will love it , but the sweetness get in the way of the oak bourbon barrel flavoring .<ssssss>
9 10 7 9 9		review this at maybe a week old .<ssssss>no freshness debate should arise from this .<ssssss>pour a red or amber tinted copper with a two finger off-white head make up of very small bubble .<ssssss>stick to the glass to leave enough lace to show where the head once be as it dissipate relatively quickly .<ssssss>smell like a pine tree with a bit of orange juice .<ssssss>the pine be oh-so apparent in the nose , and it make I think of the forest after a rain shower .<ssssss>spicy too .<ssssss>may be the best smell beer when its this fresh .<ssssss>taste fall off from the aroma .<ssssss>pine be there , citrus be there , malt come through too , whereas the aroma have mostly all hop .<ssssss>a bit woody and chewy , with a bitter aftertaste .<ssssss>very little caramel malt come through in the finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit prickly at first , but watery go down .<ssssss>not enough linger feeling .<ssssss>drinkablility be good .<ssssss>best when fresh .<ssssss>high alcohol be very slightly apparent if you take a large sip , but otherwise be well hide .<ssssss>one of the most hotly debate beer at the moment .<ssssss>over-rated ?<ssssss>maybe .<ssssss>solid ?<ssssss>definitely .<ssssss>not a ipa , but hoppy .<ssssss>not as malty as most amber , it be in-between the style .<ssssss>i like it .<ssssss>
8 5 7 7 7		the beer pour a dark brown color with a tan head .<ssssss>look like a stout should look like .<ssssss>the aroma be not very good .<ssssss>i get a little bit of roasted malt and coffee , but there be also a bit of something that resemble cough medicine .<ssssss>the flavor be heavy on the chocolate and coffee and actually taste pretty good .<ssssss>much better than it smell .<ssssss>i also get some roasted malt .<ssssss>medium to thick mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation .<ssssss>

8 7 5 6 7		appearance : have a very clear amber color , with a thick foamy white head and quite a bit of lacing and froth as well smell : very earthy and hoppy aroma , hint of citrus as well .<ssssss>not much aroma for a ipa , but still have a fairly good smell taste : start off very good , very balanced as well and end with a very bitter strong taste .<ssssss>have a very citrusy flavor mouthfeel : very thin feel , have a pretty boring feel compare to other ipa overall : not a great beer , but not too shabby either .<ssssss>this beer have a good scent and color but the taste be a little to bitter and the feel be a major let down<ssssss>

8 4 6 8 10		appearance - reddish copper see thorugh color .<ssssss>about 1/2 finger head that quickly disappear .<ssssss>smell - really do not notice much scent at all .<ssssss>taste - very mild watery taste .<ssssss>crisp hop finish without any bitterness .<ssssss>sort of similiar to the noble pil i have a week ago .<ssssss>mouthfeel - watery/fizzy carbonation drinkability - a very easy drinker .<ssssss>i could easily put down several of these .<ssssss>overall - somewhat bland in taste yet refreshing and crisp none-the-less .<ssssss>nothing noteworthy yet it would be a nice beer for I to add as a summer slammer to complement the couple of adjunk that i prefer .<ssssss>
7 6 8 6 6		on tap , at the farmer cabinet -lrb- philadelphia , pa -rrb- on 12/16/11 .<ssssss>serve in a tulip glass .<ssssss>the beer menu describe this as a saison brew with pumpkin .<ssssss>pour a deep clear copper , top with a finger of slightly off-white foamy head .<ssssss>this maintain some rich edge , with a nice flare-up that throw up a robust cascade of lacing which quickly fall back and doesnt leave a whole lot of lacing behind .<ssssss>the aroma be green pumpkin meat up front that be back by the snappy -lrb- and borderline almost souring smell -rrb- twang of wheat character behind it .<ssssss>spice and light funky earth accent sit on top but only get a bit lively in the nose later on as thing warm up , as it mostly sit with more of a flat green feel throughout the bulk of this .<ssssss>like the nose , the pumpkin jump out first to I , with a flat feeling green fleshiness , that do get a bit brighter feeling in spot , and meld mostly well with the crisp lively sweetness of the wheat .<ssssss>there be some softer earthy fruitiness and spice throughout the profile , with the spice in particular really come out strong in pretty dry finish .<ssssss>the greenness of the pumpkin really control this though and unfortunately seem to cut down on the complexity of this .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be medium body , with a solid crispness on the tongue that help bounce the wheat and yeast flavor around in the mouth .<ssssss>thing get smoother along the back and couple with that approachable 6 % abv to help keep this nicely drinkable .<ssssss>this be just ok .<ssssss>as i mention before , that green and flat feeling strength of the pumpkin flavor hinder this a bit and the saison portion that i taste be rather cut and dry.the ease of the body probably help keep this in the game a bit more than it should .<ssssss>the whole package be just kind of there and didnt leave much of a impression on I .<ssssss>

7 8 4 6 3		i be not a big fan of the belgian brew 's , this one be a bit spicy .<ssssss>i find it to be heavy and fill as well with a bit too much sweetness .<ssssss>it be a bit too thick for what it be .<ssssss>i could drink one or two of these and then i would have to move on .<ssssss>too much flavor i suppose .<ssssss>

8 6 4 6 6		pour from 11.2 oz bottle into pint glass a - black yes but not black hole black .<ssssss>very agressive pour leave creamy 2 finger head s - very roasty scent with some background coffee undertone and extra faint -lrb- but still there -rrb- chocolate scent t - definite malt and some slight hop with nice roasty coffee flavor , much like the nose .<ssssss>pretty good but nothing be really pronounced m - this be where guinness fall short .<ssssss>compare to other quality stout it be very watery .<ssssss>some thickness would do wonder for this brew o - i like it and it be cheap and drinkable but obviously do not stand up to any real stout from founder , victory or bell 's just to name a few<ssssss>
8 8 4 9 2		absolutely , positively , the most hoppy beer i have ever have by far .<ssssss>this make it a almost impossibly hard beer to get through , as the hop character overpower every other characteristic .<ssssss>if you be look to add a notch to you ipa belt , go for it .<ssssss>but if you just want a good beer , go elsewhere .<ssssss>
6 5 8 4 5		a - pour a clear gold , with a dense finger of white head .<ssssss>medium-high amount of carbonation , although head retention be not great .<ssssss>s - apple , round plasticy phenol , pear drop .<ssssss>muted and not very complex .<ssssss>t - really lack in flavour .<ssssss>phenol in the middle and green apple at the end .<ssssss>short-medium finish , slightly dry .<ssssss>m - the best part of the drink .<ssssss>quite creamy with just enough carbonation to cleanse the palate .<ssssss>d - not one to go for .<ssssss>smell and taste muted .<ssssss>there be much better expression of the style available .<ssssss>
10 5 9 5 9		so , the appearance be flawless .<ssssss>anyone who give it less than a 5 , be delusional .<ssssss>absolutley gorgeous , with three finger of tan head and exceptional lacing .<ssssss>smell be sour and weak .<ssssss>faint hint of chocolate malt , maybe some licorice .<ssssss>very watery on the palate .<ssssss>some faint roastiness be present , along with some sweetness .<ssssss>taste like it be get potential , but intentionally dumb down the flavor .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very smooth .<ssssss>very little carbonation make this super drinkable .<ssssss>definite session material , due to the lack of any artificial bmc adjunct note .<ssssss>guinness seem like it have incredible potential , but in order to make $ , it dumb everything down for the nascar fanatic , bud lite drinking , streotypical american palate .<ssssss>i understand they have mortgage to pay , but it be a shame they have to compromise what could be a quality product .<ssssss>if guinness would brew a beer with some character -lrb- besides they extra stout , which be too sweet -rrb- , and export it to the we , i believe they would have a lucrative market , if they would be willing to give it a shot .<ssssss>

8 7 8 5 7		a beautiful orange color with a nice head formation .<ssssss>although the spicy note should be pleasant , in my opinion this beer have a modification in its original taste and aroma since it start to be produce in blumenau .<ssssss>i do not know if it be intentional , but this beer originally be more balanced between the malty and hoppy aroma , like most of pale ale .<ssssss>nowadays , it seem they have create a `` new style '' : a `` weiss pale ale '' .<ssssss>drinkable and surprinsingly , anyway .<ssssss>
8 8 5 7 6		this beer sport a thin pistachio head and leave a interesting look sticky lace .<ssssss>it be a clear , light rust color .<ssssss>the nose be resinous , piney , earthy , and all around pretty light .<ssssss>the taste be of course hoppy .<ssssss>spicey hop flavor dominate , back by floral flavor .<ssssss>this be over a almost transparent malt background .<ssssss>bitterness turn a tad salty with warmth .<ssssss>this be pretty light for a ipa and i might even go so far as to call it watery .<ssssss>if you be look for some straight hop juice , this be you beer .<ssssss>
7 8 7 9 7		pour from tap at spencer a dark nutty brown , with nearly no head to a generic pint glass .<ssssss>fairly sweet , raisin-y malty nose .<ssssss>earlier reviewer nail it on toffee / caramel after a few minute sit on the bar .<ssssss>nice mouthfeel , but probably not drink more than a pint or two .<ssssss>
9 5 7 8 8		this be a hard brew to rate ... .<ssssss>as a point of reference , imagine leave a jim beam and coke out all night fulll of ice ... .<ssssss>now this beer be not quite the same , but that be a good start point .<ssssss>a ice melt bourbon and coke .<ssssss>aside from the reference this be a creatively interesting beer .<ssssss>the roasted amber nut taste be definitely present , along with a swift kick of vanilla bean and roast malt .<ssssss>the flavor in this beer surround the palate , but personally i can not get past the melted bourbon and coke reference ... .<ssssss>good beer to try for the extreme novelty , but not a prize winner by any standard ... .<ssssss>
8 5 6 3 7		this beer be a hugh let down to I .<ssssss>it look great , a dark look ale that be serve out of a very cool look tap , but it do not deliver .<ssssss>i honestly feel like i be drink a brown glass of water , this beer have absolutely no flavor .<ssssss>its not that it taste bad , or anything like that , it truly have no taste to I .<ssssss>i be amaze that the alcohol content be so high .<ssssss>i guess i would recommend this to somebody who want to experiment with new ale , but have little experience with beer outside of macro .<ssssss>it be very easy drinking .<ssssss>i probably wont try it again .<ssssss>
7 8 5 8 7		bottle from the wink lizard .<ssssss>reddish brown and surprisingly clear .<ssssss>small white head .<ssssss>look decent but not like any other saison i have have .<ssssss>smell quite nice .<ssssss>tart cherry , some wheat , and a whole boatload of funk .<ssssss>horsehair , horseblanket , funky cheese .<ssssss>good lord that be some brett !<ssssss>some dark fruit as well .<ssssss>taste be nice as well .<ssssss>much milder than i would have ever think .<ssssss>nice brett funk and some sweet malt .<ssssss>herbal , grass , yeast , and a slight touch of sourness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be frankly `` the suck '' .<ssssss>this be like seltzer water .<ssssss>this be the downfall of this beer .<ssssss>bummer .<ssssss>drinkability be good .<ssssss>you must be a fan of jp 's brett to love this .<ssssss>it be not my fave , as i prefer the classic horsey-ness of dupont , but it be quite sessionable and enjoyable .<ssssss>a nice cheese would make this sing more .<ssssss>decent beer but could use some significant improvement in m/f .<ssssss>

8 7 8 4 5		pour out a light , golden straw and sit bright golden in the glass with a nice size white head .<ssssss>fade to a thick skim .<ssssss>smell of sweet malt , honey infuse .<ssssss>grassy background with light , caramely aroma .<ssssss>taste faintly sweet up front , grainy malt flavor .<ssssss>bitterness ensue , like chew on a twig .<ssssss>grass-like flavor take over and continue into the sharp , bitter finish .<ssssss>smooth in the mouth with nice , crisp carbonation .<ssssss>medium-full body .<ssssss>nice feel , but flavor be not there .<ssssss>brutal .<ssssss>

4 7 8 7 6		a - a nice cloudy orange , but where be the head on this thing ?<ssssss>s - wheat , orange , fruity .<ssssss>not bad .<ssssss>t - a bit of yeastiness , and maltiness .<ssssss>pretty sweet .<ssssss>basically just coriander as far as spice be concern .<ssssss>closer to a pale wheat than a true wit .<ssssss>m-crisp and dry .<ssssss>d - this be not a bad beer , particularly consider its a bmc product .<ssssss>it be actually pretty good , but there be a host of wit 's out there i prefer .<ssssss>
5 8 6 5 4		purchase from smart buy in fort lee not long before it close .<ssssss>tonight i be drink this as a aperitif in a lindeman 's tall , thin stange at just over fridge temperature .<ssssss>appearance - the cork slip easily right out of the neck , with no pop or resistance whatsoever .<ssssss>on the pour , there be zero carbonation and the color be of gently steep darjeeling tea .<ssssss>absolutely still ... the most quiet , peaceful look gueuze i have see yet .<ssssss>smell - a nostril-twisting attack of wonderful sour cherry , about as good as it can get .<ssssss>like a chill fruit parfait , i want to dive right into this beer .<ssssss>taste - disappointingly weak for the style , this do not have much backbone to carry the tartness of the cherry .<ssssss>from start to finish , there be not a gripping hold on the tongue like i expect from a good gueuze ... just when the flavor start to expand , it recoil and disappear .<ssssss>the aftertaste do not linger at all , which -lrb- for I -rrb- practically defeat the purpose of choose this over any other .<ssssss>mouthfeel/drinkability - thin , watery texture in the mouth , remain so for the duration of the tasting .<ssssss>as this beer be now retire , i will not have to mention that if you be search for a quenching , satisfy gueuze you might pass this one up .<ssssss>

8 8 8 10 8		this beer be not a ipa , or a iipa , or anything one could categorize .<ssssss>only dogfish head can put such a crazy twist on something .<ssssss>this beer be a amber delight with a little bit of head , surprising for the abv .<ssssss>smell of sweet sweet hop and alcohol , not so much hot as vinous .<ssssss>this be go to be a recur theme in the beer , this beer drink much like a wine -lrb- only better of course -rrb- .<ssssss>the hop give a wonderful essence to the palate of this lupuliquor .<ssssss>they come in drove , line , line , line deep , but leave no bitter trace as the warming malty alcohol wash they away .<ssssss>the alcohol be amazingly well hide in this uberbrew .<ssssss>i be shock with every pass sip .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be interesting , little to no hop bitterness , a sweet tang , slightly off kilter but the carbonation work wonder .<ssssss>i could drink a bottle of this without much problem , pretty good drinking for such a big brew .<ssssss>i love dfh<ssssss>

6 9 6 8 8		bottle from pixieskid and simon in paris ... many thanks again , you be both amazing people !<ssssss>!<ssssss>bottle pour a nice dark dark brown , pretty damn close to black .<ssssss>the nose begin to drift toward I as i pour ... a nice roasted barley , chocolate and espresso with a hint of cinnamon .<ssssss>this smell more like a stout .<ssssss>little bit of booze and also some banana from the belgian yeast .<ssssss>i be throw off by the label , and i cant really read french , so i just see brune , think it be a brown ale .<ssssss>the pour have a nice couple finger of head with larger bubble that die quickly though .<ssssss>taste be pretty coffee forward ... espresso .<ssssss>the nose be deceive .<ssssss>it be not stout like at all and it have a thin body .<ssssss>the flavor do come together nicely .<ssssss>the first few sip , i be really disappointed , but the more i drink it , the more i get into it .<ssssss>not too much on the finish , it seem to be espresso forward , with a bit of that cinnamon , roll into chocolate then fall off on the finish leave no aftertaste .<ssssss>despite the slight booze on the nose , it doesnt seem to make much of a appearance on the taste .<ssssss>mouthfeel be disappointing , soda-like carbonation , with that thin body ... but overall , this be nice .<ssssss>glad i get to try this .<ssssss>might pick up a couple more bottle of it depend on the price .<ssssss>
7 9 8 7 7		i happen to be in minneapolis on business , and talk my coworker into go to the minneaplois town hall brewery just to try this beer .<ssssss>i be kind of surprise by how dark the beer be consider the style ; this beer be a mahogany color ?<ssssss>the smell be almost overpower with hop aroma .<ssssss>the flavor be almost too hoppy to enjoy .<ssssss>this be by far the hoppiest beer i ever try .<ssssss>i really like the ipa/apa stlye and the hop bite that come with they .<ssssss>i never think a beer could be too hoppy .<ssssss>i be not so sure about that now .<ssssss>i would have it again if i get a chance , but for I , this be like habanero salsa .<ssssss>just too extreme for I for frequent enjoyment .<ssssss>however , all of you hop lover out there owe it to yourself to try this if you ever get the chance .<ssssss>
9 10 8 8 7		personally , i love this drink .<ssssss>i think that this be the most sophisticated brew i have taste to date .<ssssss>it be of uncompromising quality and really be the beat of a different drum .<ssssss>however , i think it be most appropriate for I to rate this beer for the general audience , per usual .<ssssss>the smell be that of eggnog .<ssssss>it remind I of christmas eve and spike some dairy-fresh nog with a shot of rum .<ssssss>what a wonderful memory to conjure through a bottle of beer .<ssssss>it be big , red-brown color head be a nice compliment to its super-dark brown .<ssssss>the flavor of this be that of a rich , malty , floral perfume ... with a creamy mouthfill .<ssssss>there be also note of orange and cinnamon , with a undertone of vanilla bean .<ssssss>i be daring to go out on a ledge and say that this be the beer equivalent to pinot noir in the wine world .<ssssss>it be complex , sensual , and ... sexy .<ssssss>yeah , i say it .<ssssss>sexy .<ssssss>this be a particular drink .<ssssss>it be specific to those who wish to delve outside the realm of you standard brew .<ssssss>and for those who venture down this path , you will be pleasantly surprise .<ssssss>however , as a drinkability issue , this brew be not for the mass , not for you everyday tastebud , not even for folk who like flavor .<ssssss>it be for those of we who wish to experience and use more than one sense when drink a beer .<ssssss>so , i can not give it a high rating for drinkability because many outside of the realm of appreciation for food and drink might take this ale the wrong way .<ssssss>that be fine .<ssssss>it mean more for I .<ssssss>
7 8 5 7 8		bomber pick up while in seattle over the holiday .<ssssss>pour into a tulip it form a meaty loose head that leave stringy lace behind .<ssssss>light orange body w / fine slow rise carbonation .<ssssss>nice to look at but overall it do not look to hearty .<ssssss>only one way to find out .<ssssss>first impression be that this be very heavy handed in the citrus department .<ssssss>lot of lemon and orange rind and some grapefruit pulp just to top thing off .<ssssss>bread malt be sweet and just enough to make this somewhat balanced .<ssssss>it do not have that hop `` zip '' that so many ipa 's have but rather a fruity and zesty hop side .<ssssss>leave a bit of a coating on the palate .<ssssss>note : a decent ipa that will most likely have a wide range of opinion as i can see some loving it and some think its a weak represenation .<ssssss>i like it but at the end of the day the coating on the palate and the fruity , citrus profile be a combo that need some malt balancer to be really good .<ssssss>above average .<ssssss>
5 8 6 6 5		12 oz .<ssssss>bottle , with a autumal scene mix with pyramid , a : pour a dark amber , with a pretty weak white head , which dissipate quite fast .<ssssss>s : smell be quite good , a full smell of caramel , toast malt , and sugar .<ssssss>t : sugary sweet taste on the front , which lead to a dry , grassy bitterness .<ssssss>not a bad taste , but overall be pretty weak .<ssssss>m : light , a little tart actually dry , not enough carbonation in this style i believe , the pop of the top be really light .<ssssss>d : a fair amber , but there be much better one out there , pyramid be sort of a hit or miss brewery for I , they offering be either really good or mediocre .<ssssss>worth a shot , as i have never see it down here before .<ssssss>
8 5 8 6 8		pour into a fluted pint glass at a local seafood restaurant this beer be not half bad .<ssssss>it be between this and bud light and i think i pick the right one .<ssssss>the head be decent -lrb- around 1 inch -rrb- and overall the beer be a deep reddish brown .<ssssss>the nose be rather bland - no hop at all be present in the aroma .<ssssss>there be the smell of malt and metal .<ssssss>i think for sure this be ab - and end up be right but i honestly have no idea when i buy the two of they tonight .<ssssss>the taste be surprisingly refreshing .<ssssss>the first thing you notice be the malt and the length of the flavor .<ssssss>there be minimal hop - basically this be more in line with a english pale ale but who really care - it be not bad beer at all .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be light and a bit thin for my taste in pale ale - i think it be a touch overcarbonate , but that could be the bartender 's fault .<ssssss>he really do not seem to know much about beer .<ssssss>the drinkability be decent .<ssssss>i do end up have 2 decently size pint -lrb- 16 oz -rrb- and have no problem finish they both .<ssssss>overall i would say this beer be a decent surprise at a location i figure i would have to order wine in order to be happy .<ssssss>
7 8 9 7 7		purchase in late winter '06 from the longshot mixed bag , i be enjoy this beer in a oversize brandy snifter at just under cellar temperature .<ssssss>best by june '07 .<ssssss>pair with a few ounce of aged thoma stevenson stilton .<ssssss>appearance - pour a rich , clear mahogany color into the glass ... it support a rusty , off-white head that reduce from a centimenter-thick mat to a splattering of sporadic patch .<ssssss>lacing be clearly evident and it hang loosely within .<ssssss>smell - note of port wine and leather , with ensue aroma of tobacco and dark fruit follow closely behind .<ssssss>the alcohol be clearly obvious , but the rich , earthy , grapey fruit and subtle hop nose keep all the element in check .<ssssss>taste - with the malt drip and cascade across the tongue , the initial sweetness prove deliciously satisfy .<ssssss>somewhere in the middle there be a candy-like cloying , not terrible but just out of place ... it happen quickly and therefore it be quite noticable .<ssssss>i find the finish to be excellent because it be smooth and balanced ... this be where the beer come together .<ssssss>the result aftertaste be a calm , pleasant marriage of all ingredient .<ssssss>mouthfeel - one of the high point of this tasting be the sublime texture of this beer .<ssssss>it be on the thin side ... but the whooshy , infinitessimal carbonation be just enough to carry the whole package across town .<ssssss>damn near a perfect mouthfeel .<ssssss>drinkability - old ale be among my very favorite choice when it come to a nightcap or a sipper amongst friend during the cooler month ... while this beer be very good , it do lack some essential character .<ssssss>i love the aroma and atmosphere surround a exceptional old ale , i.e .<ssssss>old book , paper , and musty leather .<ssssss>this deliver with the fruit and overall balance , and the phenomenal humility regard the abv .<ssssss>well do .<ssssss>
8 6 6 8 7		pretty basic american stout .<ssssss>roasted and toast malt , with a touch of the west coast style hop -- citrus and pine -lrb- but just a touch -rrb- .<ssssss>easy to drink , smooth and a fairly quick finish .<ssssss>overall , a decent americanized version of a brittish stout , but nothing to cream about .<ssssss>
7 5 8 9 8		much more transparent than i think it would be , however still cloudy and bright golden straw yellow with a pure white dense head .<ssssss>a fair coating of sediment layer the bottom of the bottle and shake up easily and cloud the glass much the way a white ale should .<ssssss>smell spice and faint , not a strong malt presence but buttery like popcorn .<ssssss>a very interesting blend of ingredient with good result .<ssssss>buttery all the way through like popcorn .<ssssss>nice beer good feeling and different .<ssssss>cheer .<ssssss>
8 4 6 6 8		pour pale gold with thin white head that do not last .<ssssss>nose have a sterile metal component , dry corn & malt aroma .<ssssss>palate be ordinary malt lager .<ssssss>minimally hop , minimally malt flavor , & go down like water .<ssssss>if create a `` premium '' version of the domestic macro non-craft beer be what they be after , then they have achieve it .<ssssss>
7 7 8 6 8		i be pretty dissapointed in this one .<ssssss>be a big gin fan , i be really hope rogue would put out some kind of gin-like beer explosion but wow do this fall short of expectation .<ssssss>pour a urine like yellow .<ssssss>no real smell , slight juniper but only very very slight .<ssssss>the flavor be smooth and not overpower .<ssssss>there just be not much flavor there to work with .<ssssss>maybe with a kick up juniper flavor this could be really enjoyable , but right now it be just great .<ssssss>
4 2 2 4 3		ah good ol ' camo , drink this have probably take 10 year off my life ... anyways camo be not too bad tasting and will for sure to get even the biggest boozer buzz , but man do it give you hangover .<ssssss>try at you own risk .<ssssss>it taste sort of like bad beer with rub alcohol in it , but be definately drinkable as 40s go .<ssssss>just take some ibeprofin or a lot of water after each drinking session .<ssssss>

9 7 8 5 6		a - very dark with no light , even around the edge .<ssssss>tall tight dark head .<ssssss>s - roasted malt up front with some cocoa and coffee .<ssssss>would be very good if stronger .<ssssss>a bit of a touch of bitter after a few minute , then the scent go away .<ssssss>t - you get the roasted malt and chocolate , but something ... medicinal ... like a cheap band-aid or ... iodine ?<ssssss>the old red iodine that people use to put on cut ... the malt and chocolate be great ... this other flavor knock it back down .<ssssss>m - a lot of coating and tingle all over the tongue and throat .<ssssss>very active .<ssssss>o - the medicinal flavor really hurt this brew .<ssssss>i hope that it be just this bottle ... this beer have a ton of potential .<ssssss>i will try it again and re-review it if it do not have that flavor .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 8		well , here it be , i finally get to try more than a tiny serve of this much-coveted beer .<ssssss>pour into a tulip .<ssssss>i be actually a little nervous because i know the review for this beer be scrutinize .<ssssss>while it do pour a attractive semi-clouded gold , the foam recede rather quickly , leave a few large bubble on the surface .<ssssss>the aroma be outstanding , it be all you ever want in a ipa .<ssssss>apricot , orange , grapefruit , pine , a little mango .<ssssss>for aromatic , it easily deserve a 5 .<ssssss>i get a lot of intense stonefruit on the palate with a zippy pine backing .<ssssss>hop character be of course very good ... but i find that there be somewhat too much alcohol here .<ssssss>it can be harsh , on occasion devolve to what i can only describe as a peach-vodka character .<ssssss>that would be my knock on this beer .<ssssss>i do not think it need 11 % ; it do not quite have a strong enough malt backing to mask and/or carry it , in my opinion .<ssssss>that be my story and i be stick to it .<ssssss>i do not see how people can say the alcohol be barely noticeable ... .<ssssss>i think it be quite noticeable , and it do this particular beer a bit of a disservice in its harshness .<ssssss>feel-wise , it do not seem to be that well-carbonated , but it be from a growler that make it all the way to the east coast , so i have to give it the benefit of the doubt .<ssssss>plus , it have the requisite resiny feel that massively hop beer have .<ssssss>while it be get great hop character - we all know that - i honestly could not drink that much of this .<ssssss>for I , this be a sip beer in a single 6-8oz serve .<ssssss>it be good in that context , i think .<ssssss>not my # 1 beer , though , not even my # 1 dipa .<ssssss>even within rr 's own stable , i think pliny the elder be the superior beer .<ssssss>

9 9 8 9 6		taste at the ba detroit gathering , 11/01/2003 , at kuhnhenn 's .<ssssss>initial reaction : `` it be fuckin ' weird ; but i like it . ''<ssssss>there be consensus , at least , that it be indeed `` fuckin ' weird . ''<ssssss>i think though that the `` like it '' part be a point of some contention .<ssssss>they have get themselves a nifty little brew .<ssssss>describe as a `` experimental molasses beer , '' it be serve in a tulip glass with a initially large and pillow-like head .<ssssss>fade quickly to more of a pat-colored ring around the top .<ssssss>pretty dark , opaque body .<ssssss>more mild aroma of smoked meat , bacon , and burnt sugar be briefly beat back by licorice and molasses .<ssssss>and then they return from whence they come upon the first sip .<ssssss>medium-bodied brew bring the flavor of fatty meat slather in they own grease , some mild spice around the edge .<ssssss>not a damn thing hoppy about this beer -- fairly low bitterness .<ssssss>it just sort of naturally peter out to a somewhat clean finish .<ssssss>what can i say ?<ssssss>smoked meat ?<ssssss>fat ?<ssssss>grease ?<ssssss>and molasses ?<ssssss>it be fuckin ' weird ; but i like it .<ssssss>
6 8 5 7 7		appearance nice , cloudy orange in color but lack the full head traditional for the style .<ssssss>smell wonderful aroma of summer fruit and yeast .<ssssss>this have the classic hefeweizen nose and be fill with a wonderful array of orange , cherry , banana , and other light fruit .<ssssss>taste the yeast wimp out a bit in the taste and the fruit overpower .<ssssss>this be a pleasant tasting bier , but off style .<ssssss>theres little to taste other than the fruit from the nose .<ssssss>mouthfeel i think that this be the ale weak point .<ssssss>little carbonation and lack the classic full cheek fluff , this one disappoint in the mouth .<ssssss>drinkability the smooth fruity nature of this bier and lack of significant alcohol help this one go down quite well .<ssssss>i wouldnt serve this to a friend visit from germany though .<ssssss>the bavarian style label , complete with the blue checkered color from the region , would insult anyone who live in bavaria longer than a week .<ssssss>
9 4 10 9 7		sierra nevada xxx live review .<ssssss>pour from the 1 pint , 9.4 ounce dark brown bottle that i buy for $ 9.99 at heinen 's in gate mill this past tuesday into my brewery ommegang westvleteren style goblet .<ssssss>absolutely beautfiul label with a golden imbossed , raise `` sierra '' over top of a background `` xxx '' and a just great look , large main image .<ssssss>a absolutely great look medium brown head over a absolutely black body that let no light through .<ssssss>the head take about 4 minute to reduce down to a centimeter .<ssssss>i be too impatient to wait for it to go all of the way down .<ssssss>4.5 s dark roast malt for sure but a somewhat unwelcome , strong peppery , dark fruit smell with a rather obvious sting of alcohol .<ssssss>i let the beer warm for a while to see if the characteristic might change but these description do not change significantly .<ssssss>2.0 t dark roast malt that have a almost `` burnt '' quality about it .<ssssss>the smell that i describe above do not carry over into the taste with some of the negative aspect that i pick up .<ssssss>instead be the `` burnt '' nature of the dark roast malt and a nice dark syrupy sweetness , akin to a dark molasses .<ssssss>this be a big , mature tasting beer , very appropriate to the occasion of the 30th anniversary of sierra nevada .<ssssss>4.5 m silky smooth head and a nice sticky syrupy feel along with a bigness derive from the dark roast malt make the feel of this beer very good indeed .<ssssss>there be really a lot go on with the feel .<ssssss>i find it interesting , challenging .<ssssss>5.0 d fair to good since it be such a big beer with a aggressive abv too .<ssssss>3.5 note : a suitable tribute to sierra nevada 's 30th anniversary from the brewmaster there as well and fritz from anchor brewing company .<ssssss>the smell that be initially off put be make up for in a significant way by the taste and feel .<ssssss>

8 7 9 7 6		thanks go out to gritsak for this .<ssssss>22oz bottle into a stone ir snifter .<ssssss>2009 version , white wax .<ssssss>a : incredibly black , a aggressive pour yield a few fairly dark brown bubble , never truly develop into a head , just a ring of bubble towards the outer edge of the glass .<ssssss>easily one of the darkest beer , if not the darkest i have have to date .<ssssss>i wish i could coax more of a head from this , as it would really bring the appearance up .<ssssss>s : initial smell of soy sauce -lrb- hopefully it do not trigger triple bock flashback -rrb- , burnt malt , chocolate , molasses , brown sugar , and just a hint of booze .<ssssss>as i take a deeper smell it reveal some more note of dark chocolate and caramel .<ssssss>i also get a sort of barbeque sauce/charred meat sort of aroma mixed in .<ssssss>all around smell like a monster of a beer , but the soy sauce have I a bit wary .<ssssss>t : sweet , syrupy beer initial note of brown sugar , molasses , and caramel really stand out in front of the fairly massive chocolate note .<ssssss>really lot of dark fruit , plum , raisin , fig and maybe some grape as well .<ssssss>over ripe cherry come to mind as well .<ssssss>fair amount of port flavor go on too with the sweetness and dark flavor in general .<ssssss>decent amount of bitterness , but surprisingly there be a lack of roasted flavor , for a beer this dark .<ssssss>surprisingly mellow on the alcohol flavor , i would even venture that it be not noticeable .<ssssss>there be a bit of a tart flavor , like a plum , that really start to show itself as it warm .<ssssss>very complex .<ssssss>m : incredibly thick , light , creamy carbonation , and almost disturbingly sticky .<ssssss>chocolate milkshake .<ssssss>what i can not figure out , be that for a beer this huge , there be practically no boozey burn on the finish at all , just a bit of warmth .<ssssss>i would have to say that this be spot on for the style .<ssssss>d : it be a enjoyable beer , and be insanely complex , but as a stout it come up a bit short for I .<ssssss>the huge roasted profile and burnt malt that i have come to expect in a beer like this be miss , i think that mixed with a bit more of a hoppy bitterness would help to balance the insane sweetness of this beer .<ssssss>hmm , this be something , but i do not think it be quite the beer that the hype machine have make it to be .<ssssss>i have also hear that 2009 be a off year , as well as that 2009 be a great year , so i do not know what to think of the beer .<ssssss>interesting and complex , but i honestly believe there be better stout out there .<ssssss>
7 8 9 7 7		it pour a bright copper/orange .<ssssss>not as much head as i would want , and not much lace after a few sip .<ssssss>the smell be floral , a nice aroma .<ssssss>taste have a nice floral front , hop in the middle , and just a slight bitterness on the back .<ssssss>a nice full , mouth feel .<ssssss>ive have green monsta on tap , and this have the same character , but be much more subtle .<ssssss>not a bad beer .<ssssss>ill drink 1 or 2 more .<ssssss>
9 8 8 6 8		dark , as bible black .<ssssss>bright light probe ray bring out a ebony hue .<ssssss>long lasting head - that at first well up with a bubbly cross section and then settle down into a tight knit long lasting dense chocolate tan brown cover .<ssssss>the flavor be predominantly hop and malt -- as i expect it to be .<ssssss>smattering of coffee and bitter chocolate show for good measure .<ssssss>yet this beer be brand imperial stout .<ssssss>this bring to mind the heavier , beefier , stronger , more robust stout -- with they heavy handed hop , alcohol and malt on the flavor signature .<ssssss>if i be hand this beer without know the imperial -- id call this beer a tasty stout .<ssssss>certainly not imperial .<ssssss>theres just not enough of everything .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be rich , with a thick character upon my palate , the long lasting finish and its cleanse action play encore after encore to the dulcet tone of malt hop and yeast .<ssssss>nevertheless , id say that this imperial stout fall short of the notable imperial ive taste .<ssssss>
6 3 5 4 3		from a 1 pt .<ssssss>8 oz .<ssssss>sinister look artillery shell shape bottle , i can help , but wonder if a-b be try to send some evil subliminal message , 2006 vintage , age on cocoa bean -lrb- ? -rrb-<ssssss>, sample at a cooler cellar temperature in the snifter that come with the gift pack .<ssssss>pour a clear reddish brown with a foamy pale , cream color head that quickly settle into a thin bubbly lacing , no sticking .<ssssss>aroma of green apple , wax chocolate candy and fusel alcohol .<ssssss>medium carbonation and a softly crisp , dryish , thin , light bodied mouthfeel .<ssssss>o.k. , now i understand the `` aged on cocoa bean '' bit , but it be again the apple fruitiness that mesh with a bean bitterness , more of a coffee bean bitterness , not a very appealing taste , watery sweet lager malt , towards the end a fusel alcohol flavor emerge , and a dryish , but watery bean and malty finish .<ssssss>i be glad this be a christmas gift , since i do not lay down my own money for it , i do not feel bad for pour the rest of bottle down the drain .<ssssss>
7 9 7 7 8		another crazy label from the colorado crazy .<ssssss>the beer pour with a grand white head , but the amber color of the beer be oddly clear and detract from the sight .<ssssss>scent be spicy hop , floral .<ssssss>very appealing .<ssssss>the flavor have a initial flavor of hop , but the mellow nature be surprising .<ssssss>the hop get lose in a faintly malty taste .<ssssss>end up sightly empty , but well balanced .<ssssss>the feel be very dry but smooth .<ssssss>a mild ipa , maybe a introduction type beer to the style .<ssssss>mild .<ssssss>

8 7 6 8 9		review from note take 5-01-2010 a - deep , slightly hazy copper-red with a thin , off-white , rapidly dissipate head .<ssssss>s - big piney , citrusy hop , lot of toffee and a little biscuit .<ssssss>not cloyingly sweet like the label `` double red '' lead I to expect .<ssssss>t - hop-dominated .<ssssss>malt seem to be , interestingly , mostly in the finish .<ssssss>toffee and biscuit but , again , not too sweet .<ssssss>a bit of fruitiness separate from the citrus hop .<ssssss>mf - seem insubstantial for abv .<ssssss>soft , light-medium body , plenty of carbonation .<ssssss>d - much higher than expect .<ssssss>almost sessionable .<ssssss>tasty , and pretty unique without be a shock to the palate .<ssssss>still fall short of other oskar blues brew such as ten fidy , old chub , and gubna .<ssssss>

6 10 8 8 8		date : 26 january 2011 glass : standard 10oz snifter type : 12fl oz snifter pour aggressively , 2-finger head hold firm for a while , color be red-orange , lacing be a little runny .<ssssss>aroma of fresh tropical-fruit-like hop , and a touch of bread and fresh cookie ... .<ssssss>very interesting but very excellent .<ssssss>taste of smooth bitter hop , but without a large linger bitterness on the palate .<ssssss>very enjoyable ipa .<ssssss>
8 8 8 4 5		big thanks to mzwolinskus for bring this one over .<ssssss>i be really surprise to have a taste of this one .<ssssss>this be totally new to I .<ssssss>pour it in a robust hoegaarden glass .<ssssss>smell very fruity : raspberry and peach .<ssssss>combine with spice and malty caramel .<ssssss>it pour out a blond-amber colour beer .<ssssss>not a lot of head , but a good carbonation .<ssssss>a very bitter fruit skin taste with rich hop , unripe citrus be very overpowering and linger on into the aftertaste .<ssssss>this be a full bodied beer , but totally not my taste .<ssssss>ut vivat , crescat , floreat !<ssssss>
10 8 9 9 5		great beer !<ssssss>look great , taste great , but not one that i can easily get hammer on .<ssssss>i find that i may start off with a sam 's lager and then move on to a malt liquor or ice beer to get the buzz go .<ssssss>this be the kind of beer i might have with dinner or with the intention of only drink 1 or 2 .<ssssss>overall great quality !<ssssss>
8 8 10 9 8		a - thick black brew with a almost gelatinous viscosity .<ssssss>the tan head be massively mountainous , but quickly recede to a very manageable level .<ssssss>maybe i pour this one a bit to aggressively .<ssssss>s - ah , bourbon-esque booziness and that mildly soy-sauce tinted smokiness that i always detect in baltic porter .<ssssss>wet firewood the morning after a night of camping -lrb- douse for safety 's sake -rrb- .<ssssss>t - solid smoke and savory meaty note with a very noticeable coffee liquor note ... not milky sweet coffee flavor like kaluha ... .<ssssss>this be more like bitter black chicory .<ssssss>soy sauce also show up ... not in a bad way , i happen to like soy sauce .<ssssss>m - thick .<ssssss>this be full body like half-n-half with a big time booze kick .<ssssss>the heat do not distract from the flavor at all , but be actually a very integral part of the character of this beer .<ssssss>d - despite the noticeably high alcohol level , this be not necessarily relegate to sip status .<ssssss>i drink this more quickly than i intend to -lrb- and get a bit light head in the process -rrb- but i do not regret the 30-40 minute that i spend with this one , although i do find my self shake my head and think `` holy crap !<ssssss>that one really kick my ass ! ''<ssssss>good beer !<ssssss>and for the $ 1.95 that i pick the bottle up for , i will be come back for more !<ssssss>
7 8 8 9 7		pour a clear red , small head , no lacing .<ssssss>caramel sweetness be apparent in the nose .<ssssss>malty goodness melt nicely into this moderately hop doppelbock .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium , carbonation be good .<ssssss>overall a nicely balanced brew , maybe a little hoppy and light , but enjoyable .<ssssss>
9 8 6 8 7		a very nice balance of sweetness with the vanilla bean quite distinctive , but finish with a very slight astringency that keep the beer from be too sweet and add to the drinkability .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit of a letdown - on the thin side and make the beer seem less substantial .<ssssss>a good after dinner beer .<ssssss>
7 6 8 6 9		reddish brown , sort of ruby-esque , really .<ssssss>not much haad at all .<ssssss>smell of cherry cough syrup and wood .<ssssss>taste of dry , pleasant maltiness and nuttiness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be soft and pleasantly carbonated .<ssssss>drinkability be excellent .<ssssss>it go down like a drunk sorority chick on a ... well , let 's just say it go down easy .<ssssss>
7 9 5 7 7		pour black but not totally opaque with minimal tan head .<ssssss>rich espresso vapor reach my nose shortly after pop the cap .<ssssss>i have always love the smell of coffee , no exception here .<ssssss>big , bold , bitter coffee through and through .<ssssss>malty and slightly nutty , but there be no ambiguity here : this be a cappuccino stout !<ssssss>dry & bitter on the finish .<ssssss>much lighter mouthfeel than i expect -lrb- and want -rrb- , and a bit overly carbonate too .<ssssss>would be easier to drink if it be less bitter and/or more creamy .<ssssss>this brew be far from balanced -lrb- in true lagunita style -rrb- but solid nonetheless .<ssssss>
8 6 9 9 8		i get a bottle of this thanks to rblwthacoz , and tonight seem like a good night to open it .<ssssss>poor it into a pintglass , this beer be pitchdark with some head on it , i somehow expect it to have a creamier head but no complaint though .<ssssss>it somehow smell like a fruity coffee , something i would never try but yet it smell right .<ssssss>the first thing that hit I be the bitterness , i expect coffee , not espresso .<ssssss>i love the feel of this beer , like drinking lace coffee .<ssssss>i do not get any real fruitflavor out of this but there be a hint of oatmeal .<ssssss>i enjoy this beer a lot but i be glad my husband and i split the bottle , i do think i could get tired of this if i have to drink the whole thing myself .<ssssss>
4 4 5 8 8		o.k .<ssssss>y' all can beat I up for it if you like , but for a american macro this be the stuff .<ssssss>i would choose coor over the other two , ab and miller any day .<ssssss>why ?<ssssss>you may ask .<ssssss>because this macro actually have a little flavor as oppose to the taste of rice or corn .<ssssss>plus it be brew with mountain spring water -lrb- kidding -rrb- .<ssssss>overall , if i be in a bar and have to choose any of the american macro i would pick this one .<ssssss>quite satisfy if nothing else .<ssssss>for the price , i know alot of buzz drinker that swear by it and for good reason .<ssssss>go to the ballpark and have a tap if they have it , just for the experience .<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 9		look nice .<ssssss>pale golden body , hazy .<ssssss>bubble speed from the bottom of the glass to the thick , pillowy head , that leave some lacing behind as my glass empty - quite quickly i might add .<ssssss>aroma be very bready and light , accompany by a slight whisp of vanilla .<ssssss>very refreshing , but the taste it just a bit thin - very bready with barely noticeable hint of banana and vanilla .<ssssss>light body , easy drinker .<ssssss>very `` wheaty '' all around .<ssssss>
8 8 6 4 5		this 2010 vintage be have in a tulip glass .<ssssss>appearance - the body be a opaque coffee bean brown with rich mahogany highlight .<ssssss>the head be a little less impressive .<ssssss>the fiizzy storm only muster a finger 's width before become a very small , filmy , and bubbly lid , milk chocolate in color .<ssssss>smell - it be a little faint , but a dark licorice , leathery scent be most prominent .<ssssss>a combo of sweet and alcoholic flavor impart a blackberry-like scent as well .<ssssss>incredibly whacky , but in a good way .<ssssss>taste - whoa , man be the alcohol present in this one .<ssssss>the finish just keep building with a caustic and powerful cognac / vodka flavor .<ssssss>man that finish be really draw away from the other flavor .<ssssss>before that finish set in , there be the dark fruit flavor , and it be still blackberry and currant .<ssssss>there be a little bit of earthiness that be not as present on the nose .<ssssss>it even have a little bit of concentrated grape juice flavor .<ssssss>mouth feel - the feel be light to medium body and have a good creaminess factor .<ssssss>however , that caustic finish be really hurt this one .<ssssss>overall - i think there could have be a much better effort at conceal the alcohol in this beer .<ssssss>you can taste every bit of that eleven percent , and it be not appealing .<ssssss>if this beer taste more like it smell , it would be a much better offering .<ssssss>maybe a year or two of aging would really work wonder for this one .<ssssss>
7 10 9 8 9		coal black , but a decent carbonation but fall flat quickly .<ssssss>maybe this be due to the high alcohol content , but it would be nice to get a little head .<ssssss>amazing explosion of cherry , grape , hop and a entice , ever so slight dose of alcohol dominate the aroma .<ssssss>piney hop meld exceptionally well with a burnt roasty malt .<ssssss>mild dose of sticky molasses character complement a solid malty base .<ssssss>this beer have terrific complexity and initially seem cloying , but the hop and general roast bitterness scrub the sweetness away as quickly as it appear .<ssssss>a little carboard on the finish detract a bit .<ssssss>excellent finish for a imperial .<ssssss>not remotely cloying .<ssssss>exceptional drinkability and dangerously smooth<ssssss>
8 6 10 8 8		appearance - pour a clear burnt orange .<ssssss>a thin head have some decent resilience and leave a full , spotted layer all around .<ssssss>aroma - a faint graininess pair with a light honey aroma .<ssssss>nice at first but fade to near invisibility after setup .<ssssss>taste - plenty of malt flavor , with the expect early sweetness .<ssssss>a light touch of dark fruit and a bit of chocolate .<ssssss>the swallow show some great balancing bitterness , maybe a little much for the style but definitely in character for rogue .<ssssss>finish with a notable alcohol kick , a mild to moderate bitter dryness , and a final kiss of cocoa .<ssssss>mouthfeel - a properly weighty doppelbock .<ssssss>good smoothness and low key carbonation .<ssssss>drinkability - very tasty and a ideal way to wind down the halloween '08 weekend .<ssssss>another pricy bottle , a good beer but not worth $ 13 .<ssssss>
8 7 7 3 4		12 oz bottle - great company that produce a very underwhelming beer .<ssssss>this beer pour black with a slight brownish tint to it , and have a pretty big head for a imperial stout .<ssssss>aroma be a lot of coffee and light alcohol .<ssssss>alcohol be present in drinking , not overbear at all - however , there be a taste of peanut shell that could not be wash away from my palate .<ssssss>overall , the beer be brew fine , smell and pour great - but do not taste as good as its matured state - heresy .<ssssss>possibly a great candidate to age in the cellar though .<ssssss>the one thing i can not get pass be the taste of peanut shell - very strange .<ssssss>
4 7 5 5 6		the color remind I a bit more of a porter than a imperial stout , it be still dark , but there be plenty of amber/ruby hue in the beer .<ssssss>the head come out pretty big and fluffy , with decent lacing .<ssssss>the smell have a bit of spicy hop and deep sweetness .<ssssss>the alcohol be in the smell , but not as much as i would expect .<ssssss>the smell might be the most interesting part of this beer .<ssssss>the taste be a bit burnt , with hint of sweetness like licorice , and there be also a bit of spiciness , but i be not exactly sure what the spice be .<ssssss>the alcohol do not overpower the taste either , but you can feel it as you swallow .<ssssss>for all that this beer fail to have that i like in a imperial stout , i find it surprisingly drinkable , even with the high alcohol content .<ssssss>
6 4 7 8 7		pour golden/honey in color with massive white head that drop to a tiny film .<ssssss>no lacing or head retention smell : repress malt and euro pils/export style skunkiness taste : crisp hop bitterness and slight dry fruitiness up front .<ssssss>graininess and more hop on the midle and finish mf : pleasant , no real flaw , but not much that impresess either fairly drinkable , just nothing to get excite about<ssssss>
7 9 7 7 8		this ale pour a honey yellow-orange -lrb- pms 130c -rrb- with a very white frothy head that leave some lacing on the glass .<ssssss>the aroma be of orange peel and coriander and floral yeast .<ssssss>the taste start with a bitter bite and flavor of grain .<ssssss>the finish be effervescent sweetness with note of alcohol and spice .<ssssss>the aftertaste be a linger sweet graininess with some hop bitterness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium full with plenty of effervescence .<ssssss>overall there be better belgian style triple , but i have also have worse one .<ssssss>the best part of this ale be the yeast which have a wonderful floral and citrus bouquet .<ssssss>i use the yeast in my homebrew a lot.i remember this ale be much better year ago .<ssssss>i have hear that it be now contract brew which would explain a lot .<ssssss>
6 9 7 7 6		see the video of how they go and get the hop and how much hop they put in when produce this brew and think i just have to try it .<ssssss>find it at malt & vine , my local craft beer store and pick up a bottle .<ssssss>a - pour a dark amber color with a decent 1 finger head that stick around for a couple minute before it disappear .<ssssss>light lacing around as you drink .<ssssss>i be expect something a little more epic .<ssssss>s - pour into a big wine glass await some awesome powerful hop aroma .<ssssss>also , as a side note , when i first learn about this brew , all i could think of be ipa , i be not expect simply a pale .<ssssss>that be say , this smell from this beer be very nice .<ssssss>smell very fresh .<ssssss>remind I , oddly , of frozen berry .<ssssss>also get hit with fresh cut apple and some orange .<ssssss>t - a bit fruity but nothing to rave about .<ssssss>very crisp .<ssssss>very pleasant to drink after a long day of work .<ssssss>not strong on the booze at only 5.5 % so none of that kick in too much .<ssssss>m - initially feel light and crisp but after get through half the bottle and have it warm a little more it start take on a medium body feel .<ssssss>d - nice to drink , but like i saw in a different review , it definitely fill you up quick which be kinda a bummer .<ssssss>probably would not want anymore then one of these in one go .<ssssss>definitely worth try but nothing that i have seen/smelled/tasted that make I love this beer .<ssssss>i would go get a bottle or two to try it .<ssssss>
6 7 4 4 6		the beer pour a pale amber with a small foamy white head .<ssssss>the aroma of the beer be of pacific nw hop with almost no malt in the nose .<ssssss>the flavor of the beer have a strong burst of citrusy hop follw by very light maltiness .<ssssss>the flavor and mouthfeel be relatively creamy .<ssssss>overall , this beer have a very thin flavor to I - too thin .<ssssss>i have nothing against low gravity , low alcohol beer , but this beer just fall short on nearly every level .<ssssss>in fact , it be flavor be kinda bizzarre .<ssssss>and while i have read stone 's description on the bottle , i still do not really know what the objective of this beer be if ya get my drift ... stone deserve endless prop for supercharge the craft beer industry these last few year , but i be afraid they have fall victim to they own device .<ssssss>it seem they feel every beer they make , even the lighter one need to be hop to all hell .<ssssss>it be time for stone to break they own mold .<ssssss>
2 2 4 4 2		can not see the beer through the bottle .<ssssss>where be the `` sound '' category ?<ssssss>i would definintely give the clinking of the plastic thing in the bottle a 4.5 .<ssssss>do not smell like anything .<ssssss>taste ?<ssssss>no not really .<ssssss>a bit of muted sweetness and some cocoa .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be watery and flaccid .<ssssss>this be terrible .<ssssss>
8 4 5 5 6		i go to restraint row in new york city and experienced turkish food for the first time .<ssssss>when i ask for a turkish beer they offer fee and fee dark .<ssssss>i go with the dark and i would compare it to new castle which i love .<ssssss>unfortunately it be not as creamy and it be a hint skunky .<ssssss>i would like to give a fresh efe beer a try but the initial smell ruin my experience with this beer .<ssssss>
8 9 8 10 8		serve on tap at the brewery ... 10oz pour into a snifter .<ssssss>a - beautiful , crystal clear copper/amber color .<ssssss>a thin head that disappear quickly leave a nice thin white collar and some sparse lacing on the glass .<ssssss>s - ton and ton of citrus and pine in the nose .<ssssss>grapefruit especially .<ssssss>a nice although subtle amount of sweet malt be present but linger behind the thick smell of the hop .<ssssss>this really smell amazing ... not quite up to the pty growler i have a couple week ago , but in the same caliber ... t - much the same as the aroma .<ssssss>ton of citrusy hop , almost overwhelming ... but in such a good way .<ssssss>pineyness enter the equation and mix with some sweet and sugary malt .<ssssss>well balanced towards the hop side .<ssssss>so much hop aroma and flavor here .<ssssss>enough bitterness for sure , but the citrusy hop flavor totally dominate and create a amazing and slightly surprising experience .<ssssss>m - mouthfeel be medium body ... some residual sweetness and unfermentable sugar leave behind .<ssssss>carbonation be light to medium and suit this beer perfectly .<ssssss>ton of resiny hop coat the mouthreally nice overall .<ssssss>d - well ... i be inform they would not fill a growler for this one , so i make sure to get my fill -lrb- after all , i be not drive -rrb- , so i have three .<ssssss>pretty much do I in for the rest of the night , but it be worth it .<ssssss>this be a really great dipa -lrb- definitely not a single as the ba category would indicate -rrb- .<ssssss>other than pty , this might be my favorite dipa ... really great .<ssssss>get it while you can ... just miss it last year when out here , so happy to get a 2nd chance at try it .<ssssss>

8 10 8 8 8		review from note take on 2/5/11 .<ssssss>on tap at jackie o 's during the bottle release and strong ale event .<ssssss>thia brew pour a dark brown color with a finger of dark brown head that recede quick and hold tight around the edge of the glassware .<ssssss>a spotty amount of lace form during a swirl and stick to the glassware .<ssssss>the aroma be sweet with vanilla indication which bring out chocolate note and a tangy amount of booze .<ssssss>very sweet smell blended with a dark roastiness that balance it out .<ssssss>at time the vanilla sweetness seemingly make the chocolate character come forward and be more bold .<ssssss>this brew taste of dark grainy bitterness couple with tangy booze just like the aroma indicate .<ssssss>there be a vanilla flavoring that provide a bit of sweetness .<ssssss>there be a light yet pleasant amount of toast coconut character here which be enjoyable and provide a interesting depth to this brew .<ssssss>other flavor of oak emerge which accent a light dryness to the finish .<ssssss>there be some semisweet chocolate flavor that linger in the mouth couple with coffee .<ssssss>the alcohol character increase in both warmth and flavor intensity as this brew warm .<ssssss>this be a medium body offering , smooth feel and a light level of carbonation .<ssssss>it be a very drinkable brew .<ssssss>it have a amazing nose which unfortunately outshine the flavor profile of this brew .<ssssss>the alcohol be a bit perplexing with its tangy feel .<ssssss>it will be interesting to see how these flavor mesh and how this translate out of the bottle .<ssssss>

8 6 9 9 10		on tap at winterstorm 2010 .<ssssss>pour a belgian trippel color .<ssssss>head dissapate fast .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>nice color though .<ssssss>not much smell to this one .<ssssss>sort of citrusy caramel .<ssssss>taste be wonderful though .<ssssss>still pretty hoppy and bitter and even a good hop flavor .<ssssss>lot of citrus hop .<ssssss>nice caramel malt .<ssssss>mouthfeel be quite thin with a nice carbonation .<ssssss>overall i would say to drink up you bottle if you have any .<ssssss>this beer be goin down hill from here on out .<ssssss>
7 10 5 9 6		this bottle be the bronze label that be label as a 2009 vintage .<ssssss>pour a blackish color with caramel hint at the edge .<ssssss>very , very little carbonation that produce a small tannish head that die quickly .<ssssss>the smell be close to overwhelming , but exceptionally pleasant nonetheless .<ssssss>oak , vanilla , toffee , caramel , dark chocolate , raisin , bourbon/brandy , and maybe a touch of cinnamon all alternately -lrb- yet congruently -rrb- jump out at you .<ssssss>each smell seem to bring a different hidden smell unmask .<ssssss>i have not even yet taste this one , but i could smell this for hour .<ssssss>raisin , oak , and bourbon jump out to try to overwhelm everything else .<ssssss>other flavor surface , but only after multiple sip - chocolate , vanilla extract , pecan , maple syrup , and potentially tobacco .<ssssss>the alcohol be the flavor that linger on the tongue the most .<ssssss>there be a distinct lack of carbonation here that seem to emphasize some of the sweeter flavor .<ssssss>this one be not necessarily thin on the body , but the extremely light carbonation make it feel as such .<ssssss>quite a complex and interesting beer , the drinkablility be hard to judge due to the faux-thin nature of the body .<ssssss>its definitely a sipper in this way , and some of the flavor start to become overly sweet as it warm .<ssssss>i have a bottle of the newest vintage wait in my fridge , and i be interested to see the comparison between the 2 .<ssssss>
7 8 5 6 8		a - a nice straw gold color , completely transparent , smallish white head that recede quickly with no lacing .<ssssss>s - definitely some wild blueberry up front follow by a spicy kick from the wheat .<ssssss>some lightly toast malt linger in the background .<ssssss>t - not my favorite .<ssssss>have a decent wheat beer flavor -- light and somewhat spicy -- but the blueberry be more of a aftertaste .<ssssss>and i be not sure if they be clash with the hop , but this taste like bitter blueberry .<ssssss>the blueberry finish linger and be please , however .<ssssss>m - soda pop .<ssssss>that be about all i can say .<ssssss>less carbonation would help the flavor come out more .<ssssss>d - light body and high carbonation make this a good drinker .<ssssss>the taste hold it back a little , however .<ssssss>if you like wheat beer more than i do , then you might enjoy this .<ssssss>i would prefer a little less carbonation and a bit more synthesis of flavor .<ssssss>
7 6 8 6 6		750ml bottle into tulip snifter .<ssssss>pour a clear , bright light yellow , that appear almost faintly green at time with fairly active carbonation and a frothy white head .<ssssss>the aroma be lemony with quite a bit of barnyard funk .<ssssss>the taste be again tart and lemony upfront with some coriander as well as barnyard funk .<ssssss>the brett be not quite as prominent as in the nose .<ssssss>it also have some vinous quality as well from the barrel .<ssssss>it have a fairly light body with active carbonation .<ssssss>a unique experience though in my opinion not worth purchase again .<ssssss>
7 6 9 6 9		a : a nice golden tone .<ssssss>the head be white and small .<ssssss>i would prefer a thicker head .<ssssss>s : spice and fruit ?<ssssss>?<ssssss>t : i do not drink a lot of belgium style beer , so it be hard for I to discern specific flavor in this style .<ssssss>i can definitely pick up on spice and dry fruit flavor .<ssssss>m : the beer have a good fizzy feeling -lrb- as describe by other reviewer -rrb- to the mouth .<ssssss>i really like the mouthfeel .<ssssss>d : to I , this be nearly the perfect balance of alcohol and drinkability .<ssssss>the alcohol taste be not too strong but you can definitely tell it be there .<ssssss>i can polish off at least 4 of these in one sit !<ssssss>okay , other than hefe , belgium ale be probably my least favorite style of beer .<ssssss>however , in attempt to broaden my pallet , i have decide to take on a new style .<ssssss>i find the pranqster to be a decent beer with great mouthfeel and drinkability .<ssssss>the flavor be not my favorite , but for someone who like this style of brew , i be sure it will be a fantastic beer .<ssssss>it be a little sweet for my liking , but i can definitely tell it be a well craft beer .<ssssss>
7 7 6 8 9		clear , deep crimson-tinged mahogany cap by a foamy off-white head that hold ok , fall to a good collar , and leave some minor lace .<ssssss>the aroma be mildly malty with a soft chocolate note that be very nice .<ssssss>the body be light/medium -lrb- as might be expect for the english style -rrb- with a lightly crisp carbonation .<ssssss>the flavor be of a limited toasty malt with some caramel and mild chocolatey note .<ssssss>unfortunately there be some huskiness which detract a little bit .<ssssss>the bitterness be balance on the firm side .<ssssss>i would expect it to be a little softer consider the limited maltiness , but i would not call it out of balance .<ssssss>it finish dry with a mild toffee note .<ssssss>a easy drinking alternative to they regular line-up .<ssssss>
8 9 8 10 8		a - semi cloudy w / a nice golden yellow hue , light fluffy head s - earth tone of wheat and grass w / citrus tone of lemon and orange t - wheat , lemon , and banana flavor that linger , slowly fade out m - light feel , slight fizz but not too strong d - very , very , very drinkable this be the first russian beer that i have ever try and i would definatly be up for try more .<ssssss>the be a great all around hefe weizen that taste like it come right out of the heart of germany .<ssssss>if i do not pour it myself then i would have swear it be a german hefe weizen .<ssssss>

9 9 8 10 8		pour from a 22-ounce bomber purchase at premier gourmet in buffalo , ny , this fascinating double ipa be golden , lean towards amber , with a 1-1/2 '' thick head that be a soft off-white , almost slightly yellow .<ssssss>the nose be all about in-your-face hop .<ssssss>citrus -lrb- primarily grapefruit but i think i detect a hint of tangerine peel in there , too -rrb- and pine .<ssssss>the taste be hoppy , yes , but with a definite malt character .<ssssss>finish hoppy ; strong but pleasant .<ssssss>continue with more grapefruit , but it get creamier with each sip .<ssssss>mouthfeel be crisp at first then become a mellower creaminess .<ssssss>i straight up love this beer .<ssssss>perhaps it be because i be new to the craft beer world , but this one just knock my sock off .<ssssss>i find myself think about it in the middle of the night , wonder how long this limited-edition ale will be available .<ssssss>i be just lucky premier stock it .<ssssss>please , middle age , make this a regular offering !<ssssss>
6 8 10 8 9		rerate 11/2/03 : much better this time .<ssssss>apparently when i get what be basically the last glass in the keg last time , it have in fact go bad and be not just a bad beer .<ssssss>the color be the same , a heavily cloudy dull medium-dark brown .<ssssss>the head be a nice , wet capuccino foam that fade completely , but slowly .<ssssss>the aroma be nice .<ssssss>a little tiny bit of spice -lrb- just enough to let you know they really do use trappist yeast -rrb- a bit of melon , a fairly complex set of ester aroma and a good bit of malt .<ssssss>you notice the candi sugar , but it be not overpower like it be in some beer of the style .<ssssss>the flavor be nicely malty and the alcohol be nicely cover .<ssssss>you notice the strength when you be do , but you do not notice it when you be tasting it .<ssssss>my only qualm be that it be too mellow .<ssssss>perhaps it could have be ferment at a little higher temp to increase the yeasty flavor .<ssssss>still , brewing such a large beer and get it so balanced and cover the alcohol so well say a lot for the quality of this beer .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be rich and silky .<ssssss>too bad they serve it in a american pint glass and way too cold .<ssssss>this beer deserve better .<ssssss>1/20/03 : the body be cloudy tan leather .<ssssss>the aroma be sweet malt and light yeast spiciness .<ssssss>the flavor be tea and a slight belgian yeast spiciness .<ssssss>seem really flat which probably affect the flavor , but i be not sure if this be a problem with the brewing or if the beer have just go flat from be tap too long .<ssssss>i will rate it again because the brewpub be pretty good .<ssssss>
9 7 8 4 5		a - out on the water drinking this brew straight from the bottle .<ssssss>the glass be a dark brown color impenetrable by light .<ssssss>the label be black and green with image of hop and barley .<ssssss>it paint a invite picture .<ssssss>s - hop , lovely hop .<ssssss>this brew have a nice hop fill aroma .<ssssss>t - this ipa have no shortage of bitterness .<ssssss>the flavor do however lack a smoothness i like a great india pale ale .<ssssss>m - the feeling it offer be rather nice .<ssssss>there be subtle section off part of my tongue that be really impact by the texture .<ssssss>~ unfortunately , flavor be very important to I when select a beer .<ssssss>this one , i be afraid , will not make the cut in the future .<ssssss>
9 7 10 8 7		i sample the green flash barleywine in the we last year but i never run across any of they ipa while i be there ... the barleywine be not exactly my cup of tea , but i have the regular ipa the other day and i be delighted with it -lrb- i do not take note -rrb- .<ssssss>let 's see how it be big brother fare ... hazy gold-orange with a finger or so of head .<ssssss>big rise bubble .<ssssss>the inside of the glass be entirely coat in foam after i be do .<ssssss>one-dimensional nose , and sort of weak compare to the regular ipa - i remember remark to a friend when i open that bomber that it be as if the room have fill up with candied orange peel , and she agree .<ssssss>this one be mostly dank and weedy with some grapefruit peel undertone .<ssssss>which i guess be what i expect .<ssssss>raw , aggressive bitterness .<ssssss>you hate to see a review where someone say something ` taste of hop ' , as vague as that be , but this really do .<ssssss>pine , citrus , herb , grass , sweatsock/resiny pot - it be all there .<ssssss>a peppery twang and a considerable amount of sweet malt back it all up .<ssssss>straightforward , but well enough balanced - not quite a kick in the tooth .<ssssss>body be on the heavier side of medium , carbonation be ample .<ssssss>lush .<ssssss>very dry finish .<ssssss>pretty much perfect in that department .<ssssss>at this time there be not much on my stomach but the beer from last night and a single bit of toast .<ssssss>be it for that reason that i be buzz off half a bomber or be it just that this beer be 9.4 % and that would have happen anyway ?<ssssss>regardless , i might want to drink more but this beer would put I on my arse -lrb- and possibly you on yours -rrb- after more than a glass or two .<ssssss>
10 4 3 3 4		beautiful bottle , nostalgic of new orlean and the old south .<ssssss>no head to speak of ; no real smell -lrb- or taste -rrb- absolutely , positively , without a doubt , the worst beer i have ever taste .<ssssss>light , like water -lrb- or piss -rrb- .<ssssss>touch of metal and chemical .<ssssss>the cypress be long go due to flood , factory problem , etc .<ssssss>i be with a friend in new orlean who just have to try it , despite my warning , and the bartender describe it as a `` novelty '' because of the bottle and name , and strongly advise he not to try it .<ssssss>despite we protest , he do , and we all three agree it be the worst beer you can get .<ssssss>nice bartender , give he something else anyways .<ssssss>
9 8 9 10 8		the beer pour out in a amber color in the snifter glass .<ssssss>about a inch of head grace the top of the special beer .<ssssss>the aroma of the beer be sweet , winey , and fruity .<ssssss>the aroma group make one want that to dance on there taste bud .<ssssss>now , time to taste , very sweet to the taste .<ssssss>as the first sip move to my stomach , i get this warm feeling .<ssssss>as if the hop be tell I `` everything be go to be ok . ''<ssssss>i do not feel that the hop be overpower in this beer .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be smooth not to much but juse enough that you know that this be the kind of brew that you need to respect .<ssssss>as for the drinkability ; if you have a good dinner one or two should just be enough for you to enjoy it .<ssssss>anymore would be over kill .<ssssss>you do not want to be know as the guy who fall asleep as the bar .<ssssss>
8 10 9 8 9		bottled on 12/09/2008 receive in trade form brentk56 , thanks for the opportunity !<ssssss>pour a solid black color with a decent size fluffy tan head that show moderate retention .<ssssss>this smell incredible from the moment i pop the cap until i stick the bottle in the recycle bin .<ssssss>dark fruit , caramel , licorice , chocolate , hint of smoke , its all in here .<ssssss>little to no hop presence in the aroma .<ssssss>taste be caramel and chocolate up front , licorice , dark fruit and faint hint of alcohol and hop deep underneath .<ssssss>smooth chocolate frappe creamy mouthfeel , light level of carbonation , medium to thick body .<ssssss>i wish i have not sit on this one so long because i would love to know what its like fresh .<ssssss>this be drink beautifully right now , too bad its the only one i have ever see .<ssssss>
5 6 6 8 7		appearance : serve on tap in a standard pint glass at lucky baldwin 's at the ba throwdown .<ssssss>it have a weird head make of of very large bubble .<ssssss>a good portion of the bubble be the size of skittle , maybe a bit smaller .<ssssss>it have moderate head retention but the whole time i be look at it i just keep think how stange it look .<ssssss>the color be dark brown to black liquid with slight amber hue .<ssssss>almost no light pass through it .<ssssss>smell : again the weirdness come in .<ssssss>there be sort of a spicy fruit smell to it , but nothing to distinct that i can name .<ssssss>not very roasty in smell .<ssssss>taste : my first few sip of this beer i do not like it .<ssssss>but about halfway through the pint i change my mind and become fond of the flavor .<ssssss>the beer be lightly sour with a big flavor of plum .<ssssss>it have some dry sweetness to it as well as a sandy , earthy flavor .<ssssss>mouthfeel : the sourness be not enough to make my mouth pucker so it be comfortably balance by the sweetness .<ssssss>drinkability : this one get better as it warm a bit and as more of it pass over my palate .<ssssss>i can not say i love this beer , but with its intriguing flavor i might consider drink it again .<ssssss>
8 8 5 7 6		i see this in total wine in landmark , va and want to give it a try , have read the recent asn and mabn article on the a-b hop farm in idaho that mention it .<ssssss>when pour in the glass , it be a nice amber color and very clear .<ssssss>the head start ok but thin out , but there be lot of bubble that keep bubble right on until the end .<ssssss>this beer have a clean , malty aroma that smell pretty good .<ssssss>there be a decent flavor , a little thin , but a linger finish and good balance all the way through .<ssssss>i think there be probably too much carbonation for the body of the beer .<ssssss>all in all , there be not enough go on to really want any more .<ssssss>
7 7 9 8 7		cellar temperature , pour in a tulip glass .<ssssss>appearance - brown around the edge , but a dark cherrywood in the center when hold to the light .<ssssss>a little bit of orange tint at the bottom .<ssssss>head do not stand long , and leave very little lace .<ssssss>relax carbonation visible .<ssssss>smell - heavy yeast on the nose , remniscent of the sour fermentation smell of wine grape .<ssssss>definite acidity .<ssssss>a little bit more fruit , like a prune/raisin smell as well .<ssssss>taste - sour grape taste right away .<ssssss>prune and light malt surface .<ssssss>the finish have a hint of carameled apple , sweet and sour .<ssssss>actually somewhat rich in a strange , sweet and sour way .<ssssss>mouthfeel - way lighter than expect .<ssssss>really light , more carbonation that the appearance suggest , enliven the brew on the tongue .<ssssss>consistency be almost like that of sparkling juice .<ssssss>drinkability - it be not a chore to finish a 750 bottle , but better to share one with someone .<ssssss>it be light enough to easily drink a good portion , but rich enough that one or two serving be enough .<ssssss>n.b .<ssssss>- i feel like someone blended beer with a prune flavored izze , and it actually turn out well .<ssssss>that be a major understatement , but that be what i thought of when i first try this beer .<ssssss>

''<ssssss>it be easy to drink because of this , but it be not a beer to savor .<ssssss>eh .<ssssss>
8 5 8 8 8		serve in a tulip glass .<ssssss>amber orange that be hazy , thick creamy head that disperse slowly and never go away .<ssssss>left loose lace all the way down the glass .<ssssss>it smell funny it be not overpower but it be like when you open a box that have styrofoam and that initial sweet funkiness hit you in the face .<ssssss>i do pick up some sweet maltiness and tropical fruit .<ssssss>i could not get over this .<ssssss>have a hard time pick out some hop .<ssssss>taste be pineapple and mango in the front then turn sweet and malty in the middle then it finish thin and slightly bitter .<ssssss>its be a couple of year since i have this beer .<ssssss>from what i remember it have a nice and hoppy nose to it but this one just smell off .<ssssss>the place i have it at just get there power back and i be wonder if this have a affect on its smell .<ssssss>i be go to try and get a bottle of this to see if it still smell the same .<ssssss>still can not get over the plastic smell .<ssssss>

6 5 2 3 3		this be a interesting beer , but that be about it .<ssssss>`` interesting '' in the sense that the mold formation on you month-old cheese be `` interesting '' ; it make you say `` whoa '' , but not in a good way , and you definitely do not want to put it in you mouth .<ssssss>it pour out a pale amber color , nothing to write mom about , but not bad look .<ssssss>it develop almost no head , and quickly go down to exactly no head .<ssssss>it smell fruity like the blueberry it be make with , barely discernable hop , and a slight sour smell .<ssssss>taste like blueberry that have be soak in sugar syrup .<ssssss>it be really only moderately sweet , but the blueberry be so overpowering that it drown out all other flavor , as well as all semblence of balance .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be truly awful .<ssssss>it feel like one have just down motor oil .<ssssss>not because of the viscosity -lrb- it be a very light beer -rrb- , but because you just know you can not hope to digest what you just swallow .<ssssss>it simply be not mean for drinking .<ssssss>maybe i can compare it to drink zippo fuel ... that be a bit more like the consistency of this stuff .<ssssss>it sit on you stomach like a ton of brick .<ssssss>drinkability be also horrible .<ssssss>i can drink one of these , and after that i feel like any more and i will be need a railing to vomit over .<ssssss>it sit on you stomach , and on top of that it sour * very * quickly .<ssssss>this be not a good session beer , or -lrb- in my opinion -rrb- , a good anything beer .<ssssss>if you want a fruit beer , get some purple haze .<ssssss>
7 7 5 8 7		clear copper color , 1/3 '' of off-white head .<ssssss>pretty standard stuff for a epa .<ssssss>smell be carmely and light floral hop , some diacetyl .<ssssss>taste be well hop , grapefruit in nature , start sweet and end .<ssssss>could be more carbonated , but ok .<ssssss>seem underpowered compare to the hoppier and more flavorful apa 's , but for a epa , not bad<ssssss>
4 4 7 4 5		i can not say i agree with most of the review on this one -lrb- exept jromain , indiana -rrb- or im just miss it but ... ... i find this beer best after you be do with it .<ssssss>it do leave a maple syrup mouthfeel long after you do .<ssssss>for I get do be the hard part .<ssssss>sweetness ?<ssssss>its dark chocolate roasted malt to I be on the bitter side , almost a citrus-sour .<ssssss>the date be good so maybe i be expect something more.perhaps ill give it another try someday , but for now im glad its do , that when its best .<ssssss>
5 8 6 8 6		a - hazy golden lemon yellow , same color as something like bmc but with a little yeast cloudiness .<ssssss>foam be puffy and eggshell color , but not as expansive as most quality wheat beer .<ssssss>some lace but nothing remarkable , and a thin soapy half moon of foam float on top after the head settle .<ssssss>s - very nice nose , however i do not get much ginger or coriander .<ssssss>what i do get be pale grain and some toasty wheat , sugar cookie , some tart citrus and lemon , but not the spicy lemon cleaner property of ginger .<ssssss>some nice orange note too and only after a big swirl do i get that ` feeling ' of coriander in my nose , then a bit of banana and floral saaz hop .<ssssss>faint hint of coriander come out as the beer warm .<ssssss>t - coriander flavor be definitely up front , and ginger move in after halftime .<ssssss>ginger make a appearance more as a sharp zesty kick than lemony flavor , coincide beautifully with the clean saaz bitterness .<ssssss>as soon as i swallow i can feel the hop graduating in , blend with bready flavor and cereal grain .<ssssss>fruity citrus throughout , seville orange peel , and earthy yeast .<ssssss>clean up in the finish with a hint of spice and linger mild bitterness .<ssssss>mf - slick and medicinal with plenty of hop oil feel .<ssssss>just over medium may liven thing up a bit , but it invade the softness of the beer , make thing feel somewhat ... sharp .<ssssss>after i swirl and swirl and swirl and let some of the air out of she tire she take on a more juicy smooth texture .<ssssss>dry in the finish with some astringent property .<ssssss>d - good flavor and all , but when i reach for a wheat beer i crave something more traditionally german or belgian .<ssssss>this be a interesting and quality take on the style but one be enough for I .<ssssss>
8 6 10 9 10		a : golden-amber with one finger of head that dissipate slowly .<ssssss>n : citrus , pine and honey .<ssssss>t : mandarin orange , honey , pine , toffee , grapefruit , pineapple and all around citrus with a piney and somewhat medicinal flavored finish .<ssssss>m : uber-creamy , almost chewy .<ssssss>ultra-smooth .<ssssss>body be magnificent !<ssssss>d : one of the easiest drinking dipas i have ever have .<ssssss>
9 9 6 8 9		22oz bottle serve into a pint glass .<ssssss>a - really no head to speak of probably because it be pour a little too cold .<ssssss>some good lacing on the top , beer have a nice golden color .<ssssss>s - fairly mild on the nose , again probably because of the tempature .<ssssss>the hop aromma shine through in the best sort of way .<ssssss>not over power but just enough to invite you for more .<ssssss>t - its a very citrus but calm down quicky .<ssssss>it impart a little spice right before the hit of malt come through .<ssssss>at 45 ibu be this be really enjoyable my tounge be not torch and i could have a few of these .<ssssss>m - i would like just a tad more on the mouth feel but it work well with the hoppiness of this beer .<ssssss>overall , ive become a huge fan of alpine , any time someone go anywhere where they can grab some for my i toss they some money and say grab whatever they have .<ssssss>

7 5 8 6 6		a fairly aggressive pour produce a opaque , dark copper-brown beer with plenty of visible carbonation near the top .<ssssss>head be very light brown in color , about 1cm high , and quickly descend to a moderate ring around the glass .<ssssss>no lacing present .<ssssss>scent be predominantly of stale coffee that be be leave out for some time that drown out most of the malt sweetness here .<ssssss>perhaps very slight hint of walnut under everything else ... maybe .<ssssss>very one-dimensional , despite the possibility .<ssssss>taste mostly of malt sweetness mix with stale , sour coffee and the slightest hint of bitter chocolate .<ssssss>aftertaste of sour coffee and baker 's chocolate .<ssssss>medium to heavy-bodied with adequate carbonation to keep thing interesting and move along .<ssssss>finish be dry and slightly sticky , but not saccharine or annoying .<ssssss>a interesting take on the doppelbock , but this version completely drown out most of the doppelbock nature and therefore primarily fail , in my opinion .<ssssss>this be more of a coffee bock than a doppelbock -lrb- and the coffee do not even taste particularly good -rrb- .<ssssss>

8 10 8 8 9		a : pour a cloudy brown color with a nice 2 finger head .<ssssss>s : wow .<ssssss>i could smell the hop as soon as the pour begin .<ssssss>very nice impression to begin .<ssssss>smell be of citrus and sweet fruit .<ssssss>t : taste be definately hoppy and grapefruit be dominant .<ssssss>m : pretty creamy - nice .<ssssss>d : i could have a case of these sit in the fridge .<ssssss>very good .<ssssss>g ; eat offering from dark horse brewing<ssssss>

4 4 5 3 6		although this be one of the most widely sell and drink beer in america it be quite awful .<ssssss>a extremely light and water down lager with a high level of carbonation and very little actual beer flavor .<ssssss>the only use this beer actually have be to get college kid drunk .<ssssss>

8 5 5 2 3		a appealing brew with a generous cream head that last and lace beautifully .<ssssss>deep mahogany with caramel reflection to suit its namesake , the beer be slightly transluscent betray the fact that it be not filter and possibly bottled condition .<ssssss>i be hope for more from the aroma in this beer .<ssssss>i only get a slight whiff of the caramel i expect , and a very misplace dose of celery salt .<ssssss>the malt only faintly manifest itself through this duo of caramel and celery , and not much more manage to surface even with some warming .<ssssss>not really impressive .<ssssss>when i purchase this beer i do not really over-estimate its potential .<ssssss>i have some expectation but go in with a open mind .<ssssss>the taste be where this beer fall apart .<ssssss>chalky , astringent , and mostly flavourless with a very unpleasant aftertaste that sadly linger much too long .<ssssss>somewhat watery body and nothing to keep I come back .<ssssss>total dissappointment and a drain pour .<ssssss>: -lrb-<ssssss>
8 8 9 9 6		this be a wonderful but very heavy beer .<ssssss>it be one of those beer that i love to have one or two of , but it be almost like drink a meal .<ssssss>i usually get this beer on tap at local bar and restaurant in town .<ssssss>not a beer i would recommend for try to get drunk off of , but a great beer to pair with a meal , or when just have a few drink after work .<ssssss>a beer i highly recommend , but might make you a little sluggish or tired after drinking .<ssssss>

8 4 8 4 4		12 oz pour in a tulip .<ssssss>a creamy dense tan head sit atop the dark body .<ssssss>good retention and plentiful , if drippy , lacing .<ssssss>nose and flavor profile be fairly overwhelmed by a combo of bubblegum and buttery diacetyl .<ssssss>old/oxidized keg or intentional quality , i be not sure , but they certainly drown out any `` stout '' characteristic like roasted/chocolately malt or `` belgian '' clove , fruitiness , etc .<ssssss>on the positive side , a very smooth feel , almost nitro-ish , but this be not something i would recommend at all .<ssssss>

7 4 8 8 8		a : be a nitro-can pour a great head , a finger and a half , that last the entire time ... golden orange color s : muted cereal grain , unfortuately remind I of the big two american beer -lrb- bud and miller -rrb- ... the downfall of nitro t : sweet front end with a linger bitterness ... sometimes a bit of a metallic aftertaste but not always not sure of the reason ... not complex but for I enjoyable m : like most nitro can you get a bit of head with each drink ... for I this be enjoyable d : good beer to watch with a sport game ... do not have to think about what you be tasting ... straight-forward everyday beer<ssssss>
8 4 8 4 4		i pick up a sixer of this because the description lead I to believe it be hoppy .<ssssss>it be not .<ssssss>total waste of $ 9 .<ssssss>reddish amber color , decent lace , look pretty good .<ssssss>the smell be malt and buttered popcorn , uh-oh .<ssssss>the flavor be more malt drip with butter .<ssssss>i be no brewer but i have be tell this buttered popcorn flavor be diacetyl and i can not stand it .<ssssss>i would try this again on tap but i will not be buy any more can , yuck .<ssssss>

6 6 3 2 2		i be disappoint with this winter solstice , it be way too bitter especially at the finish .<ssssss>maybe i should not have have it with cheese and cracker .<ssssss>of course the label point out there be 100 bittering unit ...<ssssss>
7 5 6 4 6		this pour a nice golden color with a nice two finger head.the smell be light and weak.there be a slight floral scent , but that about it.the taste be basically the same as a macro lager.i really like fly dog beer , but this be not one of they best.the m/f be ok , it be well balanced and light , but if a beer have a poor taste how can it have a good m/f ?<ssssss>this be just a average beer and i be a little disappointed with fly dog .<ssssss>
8 9 6 7 5		this beer pour a very dark color with a very small head .<ssssss>the aroma be chocolate , coffee , malt , milk , and several other thing .<ssssss>excellent aroma .<ssssss>the flavor be smooth and enjoyable and not as sweet as expect .<ssssss>the flavor be mostly like the aroma with some sort of fruit hide as well .<ssssss>body be medium and drinkability be fairly smooth .<ssssss>

'<ssssss>it be the perfect balance of carbonation and sour brett with some acidic note to dazzle you pallet .<ssssss>there be orange peel and white grape throughout .<ssssss>it remind I of a less complex isabella that have not have time to mature and be still slightly raw .<ssssss>it lack the ` buttery ' sense of a bella and be much less complex with much more white grape and much less lemon/orange peel , but be still a fantastic beer in its own right - a must have for a sour junkie !<ssssss>
7 8 9 10 8		16oz bottle pour into a oversized wine glass it pour a dark dark brown almost black with a small 1 finger head that die to a small perimeter of bubble around the glass .<ssssss>dark chocolate malt dominate the smell .<ssssss>there be also a heavy residual sweetness attach similar to a ris .<ssssss>the taste have a lot of coffee undertone but then it get into this heavy chocolate / caramel malt .<ssssss>once again i can not help but compare this to a lagered ris .<ssssss>there be a large back end sweetness like a ris but it finish amazingly dry and crisp which be where the lager characteristic shine through .<ssssss>its really a interesting taste and i be enjoy the familiar rich ris taste with a lager finish ; very enjoyable the mouthfeel be full body and rich but my the carbonation be too high for the richness and distract from the taste .<ssssss>the weird thing be this drink very similar to 8-10 % abv ris with all the richness but be less than 6 % .<ssssss>usually it be the other way around .<ssssss>what this mean to I be although i be sip this in a pace similar to a ris i be able to have three 16oz .<ssssss>bottle in one night without feel full or drunk which be a huge plus .<ssssss>

9 6 5 7 6		the bottle be eye catch and i expect a explosive , unique beer .<ssssss>and then i drink a regular lager that come out of a really cool bottle .<ssssss>realistically , grolsch be just one step above any regular brand lager , it have a higher ` sweetness ' to it , which make I feel like its quality be a bit higher .<ssssss>unfortunately , the bottle alone must be the reason this beer cost so much .<ssssss>it be very expensive , and i do not think i get as much beer as i pay for -lrb- almost $ 4 -rrb- .<ssssss>grolsch have the right idea , i definitely buy the beer because of the interesting bottle , but i will not be return to it , because i can drink a foster 's for less money .<ssssss>still , keep the bottle for something .<ssssss>
7 6 9 7 8		kolsch , on tap at mad fox brewpub in fall church , va .<ssssss>the first brew i try this evening , this one be enjoy on 09/05/10 .<ssssss>appearance : arrive a pale crystalline yellow , delicate , with the remains of a half finger head and gentle swirl of off white lacing .<ssssss>slow but plentiful carbonation rise upwards towards the surface , and some streak and tendril of lacing do put up quite a struggle along the side of the glass .<ssssss>aroma : simple golden pilsen note and a faint amount of grassyness .<ssssss>rather weak .<ssssss>taste : on the sweet side , with a nice simple grainy undertone , a few husky note and some biscuityness .<ssssss>a soft bitterness and a good amount of grassy hoppiness compliment a slight amount of fruity yeast ester .<ssssss>mouthfeel : immaculately smooth and soft .<ssssss>well carbonated , but the thickness of this one even it out very well .<ssssss>its not the ideal kolsch feel , but it be how i like my beer to feel - even , creamy , and with enough lift to keep up the intensity .<ssssss>drinkability : hard to knock the drinkability of a kolsch unless it be just downright terrible .<ssssss>this one 's fortunately not - it be well-made , light , zippy , and though perhaps a little sweet for I , on the whole very nice .<ssssss>a bright refreshing summer beer that i could see myself go back for another of .<ssssss>

6 6 8 5 8		pour a clear light brown with very little head and lace .<ssssss>the smell be of a light spiced fruit and faint hop .<ssssss>taste be a bit bland for I , i could taste slightly dark fruit and carmal malt .<ssssss>honestly it taste abit to light for my tast .<ssssss>carbonation be there and help the flavor out allot .<ssssss>drinkability be good due to the low alc and medium body , but i will probably stay away from this particular brew for abit .<ssssss>
7 6 7 5 8		12 oz brown bottle .<ssssss>no freshness date , just some stamp on code .<ssssss>it pour a very clear and shiny golden color with a snow-white head along with some sticky and patchy lacing .<ssssss>the aroma be mostly of cut grass and little dry husk smell .<ssssss>a whiff of citrusy hop and faint herbal/flowery smell .<ssssss>the flavor be nothing to rave about , but i be surprised that this brew could offend anyone .<ssssss>it be a pleasant , light bodied lager .<ssssss>nothing to dislike .<ssssss>the light malt body offer some taste of herbal malt grain with a dose of sugary sweetness .<ssssss>i would have prefer a bit more hoppy -lrb- any kind -rrb- bitterness , but it be what it be .<ssssss>

6 8 8 6 6		well i have to say i be a wine lover at heart and drink a lot of wine , good wine .<ssssss>this be very reminiscent of a fortified wine .<ssssss>it pour a very opaque brown with no carbonation and no head .<ssssss>smell of toffee , choclate , caramel , creme brulee , and slight oak .<ssssss>it be actually very smooth and easy to drink in my opinion .<ssssss>kind of like a old madiera .<ssssss>very choclatey , with pure vanilla extract and toffee .<ssssss>do not show it be alcohol in my opinion .<ssssss>i would much prefer a fortified wine but this be a fun little bottle to try .<ssssss>
8 7 10 9 8		pour a deep , dark opaque brown .<ssssss>there be a slight cafe au lait head that dissipate into a ring of foam that stick around .<ssssss>moderate lacing .<ssssss>the smell be domintate by chocolate malt .<ssssss>the taste be milk chocolate , remind I of chocolate milk with a hint of coffee and spice .<ssssss>the flavor do not seem artificial like some chocolate stout .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be thick , low carbonation .<ssssss>this be a very drinkable milk stout .<ssssss>it be fill , but the 6 percent abv make it easy to drink a couple of these in a session .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		a - deep dark brown/mahogany body , big light brown head with ok retention .<ssssss>decent look .<ssssss>s - smoked meat , tan leather , chocolate .<ssssss>some licorice .<ssssss>not sure about belgo .<ssssss>t - smoked meat again , some chocolate .<ssssss>definitely kind of hot .<ssssss>licorice be again a after thought .<ssssss>i be not pick up anything too off-putting .<ssssss>m - this be a bit thin .<ssssss>o -lrb- d -rrb- - i think it be pretty good .<ssssss>it be interesting , but not offensive , and a fine all-around beer .<ssssss>
9 8 6 5 6		it arrive at the table a cloudy brown with a dense , persistent tan head .<ssssss>it leave nice lacing and make I thirsty look at it .<ssssss>it smell of vanilla , caramel , and cinnamon .<ssssss>: -rrb- the taste be dry , tart , and peppery with a dassertive roast and a earthy note .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be soft , with mild carbonation .<ssssss>it be drinkable , but too dry to have they all day long .<ssssss>still , who be complain ?<ssssss>
7 8 7 9 5		-lrb- from note -rrb- beautiful , oak color with a lot of red yeast and heavy malt .<ssssss>low carbonation and soft smell , with honey , cherry , raspberry and toffee .<ssssss>alcohol presence be light on the front , but near overwhelming on the back end , like a strong port wine .<ssssss>brown sugar and huge black malty taste prominent all the way through .<ssssss>a touch earthy , but mostly woody and not over-hopped , like many american barley wine .<ssssss>huge flavor .<ssssss>very dense .<ssssss>ton of complexity .<ssssss>difficult to drink in any real quantity , as the alcohol come through very strong in the end .<ssssss>because of the huge variation among barley wine - style ale and between such ale and american barley wine , i be still struggle to figure out how well this fit into the category .<ssssss>
8 8 4 5 5		appearance : wow that be foamy .<ssssss>pour a deep ruby red with lot of head on top to complement the dark brown underneath .<ssssss>dissipate fairly quickly .<ssssss>smell : not all that present but when stir a little there be a noticeable dark hazelnut aroma .<ssssss>smell pretty good when present .<ssssss>taste : decent at best .<ssssss>do not taste as dark as it look and the light texture leave a bit to be desire .<ssssss>still , i find nothing truly negative about the beer and it be definitely around the ` average ' quality rating of taste for a dark hefeweizen .<ssssss>mouthfeel : at first i think i enjoy the feeling in the mouth but the carbonation quickly kick in and i realize it be not what i think at first .<ssssss>if it be not for the slight sting of the carbonation it would be above average in this aspect .<ssssss>drinkability : mediocre .<ssssss>take more than a few sips/gulps at a time produce a weird feeling of taste as it be go down .<ssssss>individually sip , it be alright .<ssssss>overall : i expect more , especially from the nice look of the initial pour of the brew , but it be not a bad hefeweizen .<ssssss>just not one that i would buy too often , or at all if there be other choice around .<ssssss>

10 6 10 7 8		i come across this beer on tap at waldo pizza .<ssssss>i be server to I in a standard american pint glass .<ssssss>hazy yellow with a small white cap .<ssssss>citrus aroma .<ssssss>id swear there be cascade in there .<ssssss>wheaty and citus/spice with a nice touch of bitterness .<ssssss>a real thirst quencher .<ssssss>
6 8 6 9 8		much better than the root beer ale , i really enjoy the taste of this one and it remind I of the honey ginger my uncle brew at dejabrew .<ssssss>my one complaint be it be a tad bit too sweet .<ssssss>do not ruin the brew like it do with the rootbeer but knock it down a miniscule amount in the honey department and this would be perfect tasting .<ssssss>so far my favorite of this special package and i would certainly buy a 6 pack if they make it a regular .<ssssss>if you like ginger ale and beer , give this one a shot .<ssssss>it be better than a lot of other spiced beer in my opinion .<ssssss>
9 5 6 9 7		bottle date june 15 , 2009 .<ssssss>thanks viggo !<ssssss>a : pour a inky black with a nice tan head that lace well .<ssssss>a perfect look pint .<ssssss>s : first note be yeasty and not in a positive way .<ssssss>the aroma of yeast disappear slowly with the head leave more muted aroma of licorice and coffee t : a good ris .<ssssss>numerous subtle flavour that play across you palate at different time .<ssssss>a thick roasty bitterness from the dark malt be pair with note of molasses , licorice and , at time , berry .<ssssss>the lactose addition be not perceivable in any form to I , as any sweetness within the beer -lrb- which be minimally noticeable -rrb- i would have chalk up to a higher fg .<ssssss>m : stick to the mouth nicely as any good ris should , but i find the carbonation a little more bite than i would have like .<ssssss>d : the taste win the day here .<ssssss>the issue with aroma and mouthfeel be minimal compare to the enjoyable flavour within .<ssssss>
5 7 9 7 10		on draft at mug .<ssssss>pour hazy orange with literally zero head .<ssssss>zero .<ssssss>no lace , nothing .<ssssss>that mean the smell be weak and hidden .<ssssss>what be here be good though , fruity and sweet , hint of yeast .<ssssss>more aroma please !<ssssss>really sweet , super fruity , strong yeast with hint of funk .<ssssss>sweet start to finish , great for people who be new to beer and like sweetness .<ssssss>nice , full body ; pretty active carbonation .<ssssss>i normally do not like this but it work well .<ssssss>easy drinking here .<ssssss>could easily down another pint .<ssssss>
6 7 9 6 9		pour a medium amber with bright golden highlight and minimal head .<ssssss>the aroma have a sweet fruitiness to it , a aroma that would not be out of place in a dessert wine .<ssssss>golden delicious apple and bubblegum ester be hide in there , too .<ssssss>very little in the way of malt aroma .<ssssss>sweet on the palate , but not heavily so -- lot of fruit note , lot of bubblegum .<ssssss>the overall flavor impression remind I of grape flavored big league chew .<ssssss>in spite of the cloying apsect of the flavor , the lightness of the mouthfeel and the smoothness of the beer make this very drinkable .<ssssss>overall , this be a ok beer , historically interesting and unoffensive , but a bit too fruity-sweet for my taste .<ssssss>
8 5 7 8 7		this be my second beer review of the night .<ssssss>a great statement by any account .<ssssss>random selection at a beer and wine store in blackfoot id .<ssssss>the wine garden .<ssssss>a small bud of culture in the barren waste that be southeastern idaho .<ssssss>this beer look pretty good .<ssssss>how many way can you describe the color of a amber ale ?<ssssss>it smell a bit off .<ssssss>all the standard be there , but there be also this weird twang - like someone stick a lemon in a ass , then say ass run a 5k .<ssssss>notwithstanding that odd mental picture , i actually enjoy this beer , taste-wise .<ssssss>nice hop , great malt and a lightly toast bready warmth .<ssssss>yum .<ssssss>not bad .<ssssss>
7 7 5 8 7		a : the beer be clear dark reddish brown in color and pour with a finger high dense off white head that quickly die down but never completely fade away .<ssssss>a very light amount of carbonation be visible from the rise bubble .<ssssss>s : there be light to moderate aroma of sour dark fruit and sweetness in the nose along with some hint of oak from the barrel aging .<ssssss>t : there be a interesting balance between sweet and sour flavor ; the initial taste have a mild amount of sweetness , which transition to a mild amount of sourness in the finish .<ssssss>flavor of brown sugar , cherry and vinegar stand out in particular .<ssssss>the sweetness be slightly stronger than the sourness .<ssssss>m : it feel light - to medium-bodied and quite thin and watery on the palate and have a moderate amount of carbonation .<ssssss>d : the beer be rather easy to drink and go down smoothly .<ssssss>i would consider it to be sessionable if it have a little more sourness to balance out the sweet flavor .<ssssss>
8 7 9 7 7		a : pour rich deep dark brown color which be almost blackish in hue .<ssssss>minimal translucence .<ssssss>minimal head on the pour dissipate quickly to a thin layer of foam .<ssssss>pretty lace cling to the side of the glass after my sip .<ssssss>s : cream , butterscotch , and malt come through .<ssssss>overall the smell be somewhat subdue - pretty standard for the style , but not a major attractant here .<ssssss>t : strong malt flavor relative to other component of the flavor profile .<ssssss>overall , the beer lack relative depth and complexity of flavor - really strike I as pretty homogenize .<ssssss>that be say , the wheaty , maltiness of the beer be enjoyable for what it be worth .<ssssss>unicellular , but tasty , in a narrow way .<ssssss>m : smooth , slippery , with slight carbonation .<ssssss>i be a fan - any more syrupy and we might be have some problem .<ssssss>overall : could benefit from a little more character and audacity of flavor .<ssssss>malt be what you see and what you get .<ssssss>
6 7 2 7 7		pour a very dark , murky brown color with a minuscule off white head .<ssssss>scent of roasted malt , smoke , oak , cherry , tobacco , earth , and a hint of alcohol .<ssssss>the cherry be a little too potent right off the bat , maybe a little time will be kind to this .<ssssss>taste of roasted malt , ash , smoke , cherry , sugar , and earth .<ssssss>this one be not bad , but a little rough out of the start gate ; i can only hope that time will be kind to this one .<ssssss>mouthfeel be thin bodied and watery with no carbonation , which be absolutely inexcusable .<ssssss>
7 9 7 8 4		a : ruby .<ssssss>brilliantly clear .<ssssss>big tan head , quickly disappear .<ssssss>s : rum raisin with some clove throw in .<ssssss>nice that this be not a over spiced mess like most pumpkin beer .<ssssss>some alcohol -lrb- but not 10 % worth -rrb- .<ssssss>very well do .<ssssss>t : raisin .<ssssss>some booze .<ssssss>dark crystal malt .<ssssss>rummy .<ssssss>low hop profile -lrb- on purpose - ton of yam will do that -rrb- m : medium-to-thick body but not too sweet .<ssssss>low carb -lrb- again , expect from a belgian strong - or belgian-style brown as the bruery 's label -rrb- .<ssssss>d : much better than many over-spiced pumpkin beer out there .<ssssss>alcohol naturally sneak up on you - share the 750 with a friend or two .<ssssss>value : at $ 10.99 , well worth it .<ssssss>the bruery hit another homerun .<ssssss>

9 8 6 8 8		pour chill in flared glass a : slightly reddish brown ; very nice , foamy head ; good carb action ; nice lacing s : sweet , malty smell with caramel in the first fifteen seconds t : the flavor of a imperial rye-ipa combo , but without the alcohol ; toast malt prominent ; the darker hop give it splendid depth overall , a very solid offering<ssssss>
2 4 6 4 8		a : very pale yellow color with generous pure white head .<ssssss>s : can not smell anything much except maybe some corn and malty sweetness .<ssssss>some herb too .<ssssss>t : taste be ok .<ssssss>nothing spectacular .<ssssss>make I think of a beef up budweiser .<ssssss>corn be there and be actually nice , bring some sweetness .<ssssss>malt be also present as expect .<ssssss>very low hop level though ... m : surprisingly very good .<ssssss>carbonation be mid to high and have a very creamy feel to it , not watery at all .<ssssss>d : as with any macro , drink be high since taste be weak and do not have much aftertaste .<ssssss>
8 4 8 8 8		a - dark , ruby red with a creamy head .<ssssss>s - hmm .<ssssss>metallic .<ssssss>every so slightly fishy ?<ssssss>otherwise , a grassy sort of smell .<ssssss>t - slightly alcoholic - the strength of this beer be not well mask .<ssssss>lot of malt and some noticeable hop presence as well .<ssssss>hop character be just bitter without a lot of other flavour .<ssssss>malt be sweet-ish and very roasty .<ssssss>m - heavy-ish .<ssssss>mild carbonation .<ssssss>definitely a lot of body .<ssssss>very fill sort of beer .<ssssss>d - not bad at all .<ssssss>i be not a fan of the other faxe beer i have -lrb- the amber -rrb- but this one be clearly much better .<ssssss>kudos to I for try it : p<ssssss>

10 4 6 8 7		a : appearance be beautiful !<ssssss>its a deep , but perfectly clear red , and bright white head that actually leave more lacing than expect for the abv % .<ssssss>when swirl , the alcohol just stick to the glass .<ssssss>s : boozy , almost fuel-like .<ssssss>i get light fruit note , but it be hard to make out anything over the alcohol .<ssssss>i really wish the smell be better .<ssssss>t : my first thought be of wine .<ssssss>it be very fruity , can defiantly pick out the raspberry .<ssssss>there be no hop flavor at all , but the beer be nicely balanced .<ssssss>the finish be all booze , but surprisingly , this do not detract from the overall good taste .<ssssss>m : carbonation be on the high side , the body be medium , but defiantly sticky .<ssssss>it feel somewhat oily too , it be not a bad thing , but that the best descriptor that i have for the feeling .<ssssss>d : at 18 % , this be a sip beer , that i will enjoy over a period of a hour or two .<ssssss>
7 3 9 8 8		this beer pour a hazy dark color with a large head that stay throughout .<ssssss>it smell of raspberry and beer ; not the best combination .<ssssss>it taste very strongly of raspberry and just a little bit of a wheat like beer taste .<ssssss>doesnt tatse like beer really at all .<ssssss>overall not bad if you like raspberry , not too much of a beer though .<ssssss>
6 6 10 8 6		pour a tannish cloudy orange with a lacy head .<ssssss>the taste be sweet at first , and the 13 % alcohol be well hide .<ssssss>serve between 42-44 * f. as the beer warm up to its optimal serve temperature , it become more complex , less sweet and the alcohol come out to say a quiet hello .<ssssss>i wouldnt drink this quickly or drinnk more than one in a evening , but i would like to enjoy this again in the middle of winter near my fireplace .<ssssss>
7 5 2 2 2		have as much of a pint as i could drink after try to pass this off on my bud at the drafthouse .<ssssss>appearance : pour a nice amber with little off white head .<ssssss>aroma : smell of nut and caramel , almost like a candy bar .<ssssss>taste : this be where the beer go horribly wrong .<ssssss>taste be very astringent and dry .<ssssss>way too much crystal malt use .<ssssss>mouthfeel : not very nice either , thick and almost chewy especially for a amber .<ssssss>seem like this beer be rush out of the brewery to market .<ssssss>this brewery need to step up they game to hang in what be become a very tough austin market .<ssssss>
9 6 8 10 9		de dolle oerbier | 330 ml .<ssssss>| 9.0 % abv | 2010 vintage brewer : brouwerij de dolle brouwer style : belgian strong dark ale glass : snifter appearance : radiant cherry red under light and mahogony otherwise .<ssssss>a nice 1/2 '' head rest on top .<ssssss>aroma : tart apple , malty base , not much else .<ssssss>taste : splendid progression of flavor from the tart apple , to wheaty malt , then onto brandy , fig and prune , and a chunk of brown sugar and wad of caramel .<ssssss>really delicious , and fun .<ssssss>mouthfeel : silky and creamy , but not heavy .<ssssss>nice carbonation ... almost too much .<ssssss>harmony : the development of flavor be perfectly time so that something new segue in just as you be get use to the previous taste .<ssssss>would i get it again ?<ssssss>: yes .<ssssss>bottled : january 2010 serve : june 29 , 2011 price = $ 9.99 at whole food -lrb- nyc -rrb-<ssssss>
8 7 8 9 7		pour very clear , head linger on edge of glass only .<ssssss>aroma disappoint , spicy with a cook corn smell that border on rotten .<ssssss>malt low to none , no hop aroma .<ssssss>improve on flavour , nice corny flavour override the unappealing aroma .<ssssss>a smooth and creamy mouthfeel be balance by a nice carbonic bite .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		color be amber -lrb- duh -rrb- with a moderately-sized off-white head that fade fairly quickly , but there be several nice lacing ring down the glass that make for a very nice look beer .<ssssss>the scent be a very pleasant combination of caramel/bready malt and fruity citrus .<ssssss>the taste follow the nose , with a nice balance of malt and hop - slightly sweet caramel and bread note up front , with a nice touch of citrus bitterness in the background .<ssssss>this do not have the grassy flavor that may other lager have , which be a positive in my book .<ssssss>mouthfeel be okay , but not great .<ssssss>i would be glad to have one of these again .<ssssss>
6 7 8 9 7		pour from bottle , into my allagash slim tulip glass .<ssssss>pour a clear yellow , with very nice head .<ssssss>much lighter look then i be expect .<ssssss>smell like bread , yeast , with some citrus , and pretty strong hop presence .<ssssss>taste of hop , not too bitter , with some sweetness to balance it out .<ssssss>very drinkable beer !<ssssss>i enjoy this one quite a bit .<ssssss>
8 5 8 5 5		this brew pour into the glass with a dark amber body top by a medium thick to thick head with a decent amount of lacing leave behind on the glass .<ssssss>the aroma and flavor be sweet and malty with a good hoppy character .<ssssss>light to medium body and relatively smooth .<ssssss>
8 8 6 9 8		pour from the 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass .<ssssss>on the pour this one be very dark brown with ruby highlight around the edge .<ssssss>there be a thin , bubbly tan head up top .<ssssss>the nose be subtle but complex with note of sour cherry , oak , milk chocolate , and malty sweetness .<ssssss>the taste be good , but lack in complexity .<ssssss>there be a strong maltiness up front that be follow by some sour cherry and chocolate , and a hint of roasted malt .<ssssss>the finish have a definite strong sourness to it .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be much too thin for a stout .<ssssss>it be almost watery , and it definitely take away from the overall enjoyment of the beer .<ssssss>i know a lot of people have not like this beer , but i think it be pretty good overall .<ssssss>it do not blow I away , but it be a interesting , drinkable brew .<ssssss>i do think it would be much better if the cherry be cut back just a touch .<ssssss>overall worth a shot .<ssssss>thanks to for send this one via bc2 .<ssssss>
5 5 5 6 4		it could be worse , be pleasantly surprise at the steel reserve .<ssssss>hide the booze well for a 8.1 % brewsky , however still find note of cheap alcohol as if spike with some isopropyl .<ssssss>i would choose a steel reserve over many can macro 's as you do not need to drink as many to achieve the desire effect .<ssssss>nothing offensive , surprisingly smooth , not much to look forward too , and give one hell of a headache .<ssssss>
8 9 7 10 9		great beer .<ssssss>pour a chocolate brown color with a small creamy tan head .<ssssss>the smell be very entice , coffee grounds and chocolate .<ssssss>my mouth be water in anticipation .<ssssss>my mouth be not disappoint .<ssssss>the chocolate and coffee blended beautifully on my tongue .<ssssss>holy crap , it be like my tongue just have a orgasm .<ssssss>it have a nice full mouth feel , as i would expect from a porter , but the carbonation level seem a bit high to I - jab at my tongue with sharp little bubble .<ssssss>great beer .<ssssss>wait , do i say that already ?<ssssss>well it be true .<ssssss>definately something i will be drink again and again .<ssssss>
7 9 6 6 7		pour a beautifully cloudy muddy amber , as all dunkel heffer should .<ssssss>i would tell you about the head , but i apparantly turn my back for 15 seconds - and it be go .<ssssss>nothing creamy about this one , very ` champagne ' .<ssssss>dunkel malt smell really nice , along with promising upfront bitters .<ssssss>initial taste be a bit mediciney , but a dry medium body do not give the notion much time to live .<ssssss>the taste be best right after the swallow , and again far down the line - there be a bit of sweetness after all the bitterness fade .<ssssss>fairly drinkable , thanks to the non-existant trace of alcohol .<ssssss>temper by one 's respective love for astringent bitters .<ssssss>could go down very well indeed on a hot day with some grilled sausage !<ssssss>
6 4 8 6 4		chill bottle into a glass .<ssssss>a very generous extra from wisconsinality .<ssssss>thanks , kylie !<ssssss>a : pour a pitch black body with a half-finger of light beige head .<ssssss>it quickly vanish into a light collar that leave no lace down the glass .<ssssss>it be nearly opaque , but when i hold it to the light , there be a ruby translucence that reveal it be not fully there .<ssssss>s : soapy , old towel : the hop profile on this one scream `` stone 14th '' at I .<ssssss>euchh .<ssssss>not to my liking .<ssssss>as i ignore it and pay attention to the rest of the nose , i detect anise , roast , chocolate .<ssssss>t : that soapiness in the nose be find here , again .<ssssss>i will be up front : i can not stand this particular hop strain , whatever it be , and it quickly limit how much enjoyment i be go to get out of the beer .<ssssss>just the same , i put my aversion aside and enjoy the anise , chocolate , dark fruit -lrb- date , in particular -rrb- , and roasted malt .<ssssss>a touch of pineapple and leafy green hop be also find .<ssssss>it be well construct , but the choice of ingredient just do not suit I .<ssssss>my problem , not the beer 's .<ssssss>m : moderate chewiness ; medium-full body .<ssssss>it be low in carbonation , with a decent creaminess .<ssssss>not much heat to it , but there be a slight warmth in the finish .<ssssss>d : this remind I of sierra nevada 's black barleywine , but with a considerably less impressive hop profile .<ssssss>i be glad i try this , but i be very glad i do not get more of it .<ssssss>
7 8 8 10 9		i have never hear of fuller before try this one at buckley 's in merrimack nh .<ssssss>it be a pale brown ale in a pint glass that make it to the table with no head or lacing to be see .<ssssss>the aroma be of hop and spice .<ssssss>as i drink this ale , i be shock to find a bit of a sweet taste , almost a sugar fore and aftertaste , with a bite of hop mixed with spice .<ssssss>carbonation be perfect to fit the taste of a beer .<ssssss>not a taste i expect from a ipa , and it be good .<ssssss>i be pleasantly surprised and would definetly have this one again .<ssssss>
8 8 8 10 7		get some good deal while get grocery , decide to splurge .<ssssss>big-ass bottle , pour dark brown virtually black , w / well over a inch of tan-tone thick head .<ssssss>half the head stay quite awhile , can practically bite it .<ssssss>smell be like dark chocolate with a hint of ... raisin ?<ssssss>think i even smell a oakish tone , maybe they mislable this one a ' it be the oak-aged ?<ssssss>oddly complex , yet subtle at the same time .<ssssss>taste be sweeter than i would think consider the smell .<ssssss>humongous malt still , and a slight warming from the 9.5 % .<ssssss>go down creamy , almost milk-like , w / the hop come near the end .<ssssss>drinkability take a slight hit , but only because it demand so much respect .<ssssss>this be strictly post-meal , preferably one involve hunk of pork rip off the carcass like you think you be henry the 8th or something .<ssssss>i be a sucker for that kind of thing though , so the overall be a plus to I .<ssssss>
6 10 8 8 8		pour a clear copper , slight chill haze .<ssssss>half inch head with some thin lacing .<ssssss>smell be pungent hop .<ssssss>grapefruit , pineapple and a slight malty candy-like apple .<ssssss>taste be hop up bitter smooth grapefruit ; spicy and appetizing .<ssssss>the malt characteristic help balance this brew out .<ssssss>slight alcohol note .<ssssss>medium body , smooth finish with linger bitterness , very drinkable .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		12oz bottle appearance - the beer pour a black colour with a average size fizzy light brown colour head .<ssssss>i can not see much carbonation due the darkness of the beer and there be some good lacing on the side of the glass .<ssssss>the head last for 5 minute before it be go .<ssssss>smell - chocolate , malt , roasted coffee , smoke taste & mouth - the beer have a high amount of carbonation and i can taste chocolate and roasted/burnt coffee mix with malt and and a bit of a smokiness .<ssssss>the taste be really well balanced but the beer feel a little thin and watery which be surprising give it be alcohol content .<ssssss>it finish with a chocolate/coffee slightly smokey aftertaste .<ssssss>overall one of the better beer i have have from this brewer .<ssssss>i would drink it again for sure .<ssssss>only need a little improvement in the mouth feel department .<ssssss>
8 5 8 6 8		all note be base on comparison between the three .<ssssss>pour clearest of the 3 with almost no head that disipate immediately .<ssssss>smell not good .<ssssss>just kinda blah .<ssssss>taste malty and lose all of the herb .<ssssss>disappointing compare to the other two .<ssssss>less carbonated and definitely not as good as th other two<ssssss>
6 8 7 6 8		this be send to I by boatshoe .<ssssss>he say he live right across from the brewery .<ssssss>seem like that a pretty good shtick .<ssssss>a - a pretty darn pale yellow .<ssssss>the cloudy color be approach witbier hue .<ssssss>not much of a head , no lacing .<ssssss>s - it smell pretty good .<ssssss>spicy , lemony , and at time , tart .<ssssss>lot of pepper , chalky yeasty stuff and apple .<ssssss>t - earthy and spicy with pepper and that chalky yeasty stuff .<ssssss>bright fruit like apple and lemon bring up the rear .<ssssss>m - sharp , crisp carbonation with a dry finish .<ssssss>just before the finish be a slick feeling that seem out of place .<ssssss>
8 8 8 9 6		thanks to bamadog for the hookup on this one .<ssssss>a - color be a cinnamon with little to no lacing .<ssssss>s - nose have a nice spicy tone with cinnamon , chocolate , and caramel come through .<ssssss>i can barely smell the alcohol which be a plus consider how heavy this one be .<ssssss>t - very sweet in the beginning with a nice warming come through in the finish from the alcohol .<ssssss>i be pick up raisin , honey , chocolate and dark fruit in the taste here .<ssssss>m - this one be almost like syrup in the mouthfeel but not in a bad way .<ssssss>d - i have to give this one low drinkability base on the high abv .<ssssss>man , have two of these would leave I feel a mess .<ssssss>
7 8 5 8 8		friend share with I .<ssssss>a - light black , chocolate head , dissipate slow with decent leg .<ssssss>s - malt , floral hop , and light alcohol .<ssssss>t - malt , floral , grassy hop , and light alcohol m - slt alcohol and just do not get the full malt feel of a stout .<ssssss>base on the color and flavor , they may have miss gravity -lrb- i do this when i brew beer too -rrb- .<ssssss>d - good , but could age longer and the roasted malt flavor could shine through more .<ssssss>
4 7 9 7 7		review in jan , 2005 .<ssssss>hard pour to obtain almost no head ... just a tiny ring around the glass .<ssssss>look like a gorgeous bock , dark rust orange in color , but be mildly cloudy .<ssssss>smell of caramel , chocolate , and i get a hint of orange .<ssssss>whoa , the taste be sweet malty and smooth .<ssssss>caramel , bready , vienna -lrb- or munich -rrb- malt , and a bit of baker 's chocolate -lrb- which i certainly be not expect -rrb- .<ssssss>have a pierce fine carbonation that add a hint of sour/acid immediately after the swallow .<ssssss>any hop bitterness be gentle , but i do get a bit of zing late that could come from hop .<ssssss>tough to tell , as the zing could be the result of alcohol and carbonation combine .<ssssss>this beer contain some bock character mix in with many other non-traditional bock characteristic .<ssssss>medium thick body with moderate carbonation -lrb- but the carbonation form pierce bubble on my tongue -rrb- .<ssssss>
7 5 7 7 7		on tap at sweetewater tavern in concourse b of hartsfield international .<ssssss>mega 22 oz .<ssssss>pint .<ssssss>appearance : copper-penny body with a fine , crisp-looking , slightly off-white head .<ssssss>the head retention be pretty good actually , and the carbonation level be medium to high .<ssssss>lacing be wispy and light .<ssssss>aroma : sweet , biscuity malt , very pale , with light , earthy and citrus-zest hop float over the surface .<ssssss>way too weak .<ssssss>taste : very balanced , almost a bitter .<ssssss>pale , bready malt , with a few toast overtone .<ssssss>moderate hop bitterness , and some vegetal , earthy hop note round thing off .<ssssss>it be solid and , as i say , very well-balanced , but everything seem sort of muted .<ssssss>mouthfeel : very crisp , due to the carbonation .<ssssss>the body be pretty thin , but the big , even bubble-profile and assertive effervescence make up for it .<ssssss>good for the style .<ssssss>drinkability : very easy-going .<ssssss>no off-flavor .<ssssss>low alcohol .<ssssss>but it do get somewhat boring after a while - everything just seem sorta dampen .<ssssss>make it easy to down though .<ssssss>a west coast homage , and although they hit all the key point , there be not much else that they hit .<ssssss>there be pale malt , and there be west-coast hop , sure , but this be not the best application of that combo i have see .<ssssss>not a bad beer , just very average .<ssssss>
8 8 5 7 6		pour a clear reddish copper color with a scant cream head that dissipate into a hint of foam with a nice ring of head cling to the side of the tulip .<ssssss>aroma of caramel , toffee , and rum dominate the initial smell .<ssssss>dark cherry and plum linger in the background .<ssssss>alcohol and rum be present throughout the flavor , with dark cherry , molasses , and raisin become evident mid palate and carry through to the slightly bitter , almost citrus pith finish .<ssssss>raisin and candy sweetness take over as it warm .<ssssss>the body be fairly thick , with minimal carbonation and a warm alcohol finish .<ssssss>i be slightly disappointed that the alcohol be not better hide .<ssssss>for a beer at this pricepoint , i expect a little more sophistication .<ssssss>may be worth purchase a few bottle and cellare for a good five year .<ssssss>
7 9 7 6 9		i honestly like this beer .<ssssss>it be a light and refreshing taste that i be far from bitter which be a instant plus with I .<ssssss>the head do not last long but the smell remind I of autumn so it fulfil that objective .<ssssss>i feel that while this be not exactly the strongest brew nor do it have a robust body , it be a good light flavored brew that i will probably buy again .<ssssss>

9 5 7 5 8		12 oz bottle a : light golden under a white head .<ssssss>good lace and retention .<ssssss>s : i be find it difficult to get anything out of the aroma .<ssssss>maybe a bit of fruitiness and only a dash of wheat if any .<ssssss>t : again , pretty subdue .<ssssss>a little bit of fruit , a bit of corn , bitterness in the finish be off slightly .<ssssss>could be better .<ssssss>m/d : fizzy , light body , crisp , not too much of a surprise .<ssssss>decent drinkability , it go down easy enough , but it could really use some taste .<ssssss>
8 3 6 4 4		look - pour pale brown smooth with a thick white head and a bit of lace a very nice look brew a lot like guiness and some of the other on tap bitters/stouts smell be just really dull , almost nothing there except for some stale day old folger coffee note taste be some malt with some bitterish dry hop mie with a overwhelmingly metallic taste - then some smokey , plasticy old tea finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel be just ok , hold heavier than one would think from the taste overall , not a very drinkable beer , pretty offensive , not highly , but decently so .<ssssss>
6 7 9 8 8		appearance : this brew pour a murky medium honey color .<ssssss>head be slight with minimal lacing .<ssssss>spiderweb be plentiful on the surface .<ssssss>interesting but not excellent .<ssssss>smell : the aroma be slightly matly with aromatic hop and a tart citrus presence .<ssssss>the overall aroma be rather light , expecially for a ipa .<ssssss>aroma curve be sharp during onset with a rather quick taper to sustain .<ssssss>taste : the flavor curve and character of this selection be quite interesting .<ssssss>initially there be a burst of hop that be accentuate by the carbonation .<ssssss>citrus and a woodsy presence with a interesting malt finish .<ssssss>great overall taste .<ssssss>mouthfeel : the brew have a nice carbonation snap upon initial sip .<ssssss>this highlight the flavor character .<ssssss>the totality of the flavor roll off the tongue quite well .<ssssss>the palate be leave perfectly clean after sustain .<ssssss>excellent overall mouthfeel .<ssssss>drinkability : this brew be not heavy in character and leave the drinker wish that there be another on ice .<ssssss>great .<ssssss>prosit !<ssssss>nikkus<ssssss>

4 4 8 5 8		appearance be gold with a slight hint of amber .<ssssss>very light .<ssssss>good head on pour that soon disappear without a trace .<ssssss>smell be so faint that you really have to look for it - slightly sweet malty smell be there , just barely .<ssssss>taste be a crisp adjuncty taste with a hint of malt .<ssssss>absolutely inoffensive , but also rather boring .<ssssss>i have get nothing bad to say about it , but nothing good to say either .<ssssss>mouthfeel be surprisingly smooth for a beer of this style .<ssssss>drinkability - on a hot day they could go down like water .<ssssss>not a beer i would seek out , but , on the other hand , i would not turn down a free one .<ssssss>this would be a great beer to serve at a party for people who normally prefer bmc - it be better and it be cheaper -lrb- i pay 12.79 + tax for a case of 16 oz .<ssssss>returnable -rrb- and it be make by a small brewery .<ssssss>however , i would not recommend it for someone who prefer full flavored craft brew .<ssssss>
8 9 6 8 8		bottle into pint glass -lrb- 6/17/10 -rrb- pour a cloudy amber color with a creamy head that last the whole glass .<ssssss>nose be of straw and grass with a hint of some citrus fruit .<ssssss>the taste be surprisingly a little sweet , but with a nice afterbite of hoppy bitters to give it a nice crisp finish .<ssssss>overall i have always enjoy this beer and style and be not disappoint .<ssssss>very refreshing on a hot summer night .<ssssss>
8 6 8 9 9		a : quarter finger head with lot of lace .<ssssss>a little light get through but very dark .<ssssss>s : very little on the nose .<ssssss>not much to comment on here .<ssssss>t : caramel and roast .<ssssss>a sharp finish .<ssssss>chocolate and smokey note .<ssssss>m : moderate carbonation .<ssssss>medium to full body .<ssssss>overall : the taste be very good but the aroma be lack .<ssssss>this be a very good tasting beer and i will be get this one again .<ssssss>
8 7 9 10 10		this be a good beer in the winter .<ssssss>and if you can stock up in summer then i would .<ssssss>first twist of the cap the smell be terrific .<ssssss>smell like apple maybe a little sour smell to it .<ssssss>taste be like tasting a good quality beer with the apple and cinnamin too it .<ssssss>it have alot of flavor of apple and cinnamin and when i say alot i mean you can taste it in it you dont have to hunt the flavor down with a swish of the beer .<ssssss>and its nothing like woodchuck which be a real flat cider/beer .<ssssss>apple spice have the beer flavor to it with the apple and a good texture .<ssssss>i drink it as much as i can in the winter .<ssssss>and will drink again and again and again<ssssss>
8 9 6 8 8		a hard pour reveal a dark brown brew with amber streak throughout when hold to the light .<ssssss>it blast up a two finger head of yellowy-tan that stick as it recede for some nice lacing .<ssssss>carbonation be visually light , and for a beer advertise as unfiltered , there be no sediment or dust to speak of .<ssssss>the aroma offer dark roasty malt , hint of chocolate and coffee , burnt caramel , and fragrant -lrb- and slightly sweet -rrb- floral hop .<ssssss>as we sip malt and hop compete for the front .<ssssss>the malt , as suggest by the aroma , be nice and toasty , whereas the hop taste more grassy than floral .<ssssss>the hop disappear almost entirely through the middle , make room for the malt to crash into bittersweet chocolate flavoring .<ssssss>the finish be a revival of the hop , which be more bitter and grassy than ever .<ssssss>the aftertaste breathe more of the same , but be naturally lighter .<ssssss>the body be light to medium and the carbonation be evenly medium .<ssssss>the feel be creamy up front , but slightly watery , with the mouth fully dry by the end of the session .<ssssss>the abv be standard and the beer drink quite well .<ssssss>overall , what we find most enjoyable about this brew be the aroma .<ssssss>it can be tough to find a porter with heavy hop character that blend it as well as treg do here .<ssssss>they be sickly sweet and invite in the aroma , follow through in the taste but without overpower the traditional porter trait .<ssssss>on another note , this be one of the coolest label out there , brilliantly depict the name of the beer , while help to tie the entire experience together .<ssssss>

6 2 4 3 3		a-clear gold straw color with thick foamy white head that retain well leave behind lot of lacing to my suprise s-like a funky hospital hallway -lrb- puke -rrb- mask by some nauseating aerosol floral air freshener t-buttery popcorn , rotten creamed corn , skol vodka aftertaste -lrb- it be get hard to stomache -rrb- m-thin and bubbly way to much carbonation , but i think thats the last thing this beer need to fix , it leave a morning breath aftertaste -lrb- i be brushing my tooth as soon as i be do , it be that bad ! -rrb-<ssssss>d-i enjoy some 40oz from time to time , but this could scare I from try many more , i will stick with oe 800 from now on !<ssssss>

8 7 7 9 8		modest and lasting tight-bubbled head .<ssssss>nice blanket lace on the glass .<ssssss>the liquid be very cloudy with a orange hue to the darker amber color .<ssssss>mild , but distinctly piney hop to the nose .<ssssss>decent malt base to start off .<ssssss>excellent dry malt start to the taste .<ssssss>this dipa be not a hop bomb like most .<ssssss>it be bitter , but balanced .<ssssss>the hop be peppery with a grapefruit accent .<ssssss>the body be full and modestly oily .<ssssss>the carbonation be at the midpoint , but feel lower because of the richness .<ssssss>interestingly , the alcohol do not show up in the usual way -lrb- warmth in the swallow -rrb- .<ssssss>overall , a very nice balance of many element .<ssssss>
6 4 5 4 7		pour a very clear pale amber color , with a nice tan head that dissipate quickly but leave some decent lacing on the glass .<ssssss>the smell be not very good , smell grainy , corn , very similar to bud .<ssssss>the taste be that of a more malty budweiser .<ssssss>it taste like they use adjunct though i be not sure .<ssssss>have a artifical sweetner taste .<ssssss>i feel the taste get worse as it warm .<ssssss>the feel be light and watery and leave a unpleasant dry aftertaste .<ssssss>i think this would have be label as a american macro , which would have probably help its review but as a american amber lager , this be not very good .<ssssss>drink easy as most american macro do .<ssssss>
10 2 4 5 6		a : this beer look great , but look can be deceive .<ssssss>a wonderful clear amber color , and a thick white head .<ssssss>s : once i smell this , i be completely turn off .<ssssss>of what i could barely smell , it almost have a skunk smell .<ssssss>t : smooth taste , but be just way too watery .<ssssss>for bud , i be impressed , but that be not say much .<ssssss>m : again , to watery , they be no meat to this beer .<ssssss>d : you could probably drink bunch of these , it be watery enough .<ssssss>
8 7 9 7 10		light clear golden appearance , 2 finger head on the pour and pretty much sit there , not fading nearly as fast as i would expect .<ssssss>smell be light , no strong aroma here , belgiumesque yeast , maybe some grain , mild hop , lemon ... .<ssssss>nice lacing as the head be die down .<ssssss>wow , amazing , one be the most `` nothing beer '' i ; ve taste but not in a bad way , i could probably session these all night .<ssssss>absolutely no aftertaste , and although the flavor be very mild it be quite tasty , and beg to be sample further .<ssssss>much rather drink these all night than bud , miller , etc .<ssssss>also the mouthfeel be much creamier than i anticipate .<ssssss>this one be different than other lager i have try and i must say i be enjoy it .<ssssss>great transitional brew for american powerhouse macro fanboy .<ssssss>if you be try to convert anybody that be ...<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		very nice , excessively dark pour .<ssssss>like a black rye .<ssssss>not a stout , quite , but still darker than a porter .<ssssss>at any rate it be darker than you average belgian dark .<ssssss>smell zippy , ashen yeast , fruity and sour .<ssssss>not the most complex or intense of blend , but nice and lively .<ssssss>nothing off put .<ssssss>taste as it smell .<ssssss>medium strength blend belgian flavor cohere into something akin to a fruit and bread basket with earthen undertone .<ssssss>not quite the full package that i look for in a nice , solid belgian , but for a midwestern attempt a belgian it be pretty good .<ssssss>
10 10 6 5 7		12 oz bottled pour into a snifter - 2007 ?<ssssss>bottle - cellar temp appearance : pour a semi-cloudy brown color with orange highlight .<ssssss>the head be monstrous for a glass like this .<ssssss>2 '' tall with vary bubble size .<ssssss>craterous surface with gobb of stick lace .<ssssss>excellent retention .<ssssss>smell : a immediate blueberry smell hit my nose as soon as i pop the cap .<ssssss>dense , sugary malt and floral hop bouquet .<ssssss>taste : earthy and dense .<ssssss>hop bitterness surface over the malt backbone .<ssssss>there be a blueberry flavor but it be load with a tannin quality .<ssssss>i suppose it be a authentic blueberry flavor .<ssssss>mouthfeel : medium body , ample bitterness , lot of tannin .<ssssss>alcohol be there but be not cloying .<ssssss>dry finish .<ssssss>drinkability : if the taste match the aroma , we would be discuss a impeccable brew .<ssssss>a decent quencher and a reasonable session beer .<ssssss>worth a try .<ssssss>
6 8 8 6 8		cloudy light orange with thin ring of fizz for a head .<ssssss>smell of raspberry syrup , cranberry , sour cherry and hint of light malt - no hop smell .<ssssss>slightly sweet raspberry flavor with light pale malt background .<ssssss>the somewhat dry finish keep it drinkable .<ssssss>light body feel with low , soft carbonation .<ssssss>this beer be a great ingredient for they vinaigrette dress .<ssssss>
9 8 8 6 10		a : very pale brilliantly clear golden color with a ample head that stick around for a bit but eventualy be reduce to a thin white layer of larger bubble .<ssssss>carbonation can be see rise through the beer .<ssssss>s : more or less a floral and spicy hop aroma , pleasent and unskunked .<ssssss>t : sweeter than i expect , a very light hop bitterness .<ssssss>pleasent , but not captivating by any means .<ssssss>m : thin and well carbonated , have a nice tingle on the tongue .<ssssss>d : drinkable as hell , i could drink this endlessly without even realize i be drinking ... to be honest , its too drinkable for my taste , but that be the style 's hallmark .<ssssss>most food would probably overpower this beer , but it would be interesting to try with some milder flavored thing such as a spinach salad or a mild fish with a fresh lemon squeeze on it .<ssssss>a spicy food might also go well with it .<ssssss>
4 7 8 6 6		murky , muddy , and cider-like appearance with a decent head that scramble away leave a tiny ring around the edge .<ssssss>this be the darkest and cloudiest gueuze i have have -- definitely not a great-looking beer .<ssssss>funky and slightly medicinal on the nose , with some fruit .<ssssss>not a sharp and fresh lemony scent , but more of a tropical fruit character .<ssssss>similar taste : unidentifiable light fruit with some earthy note .<ssssss>however , there really be not much complexity here .<ssssss>the earthy tone from the bug be pretty one-dimensional , and that dimension be nothing too special .<ssssss>tart acidity on the finish , but i certainly would not call it puckering .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be this beer 's best characteristic .<ssssss>it be medium-light with fairly high carbonation , but it be actually very smooth .<ssssss>i enjoy super-sour beer , but the absence of that characteristic here make this one damn drinkable on a hot day .<ssssss>overall this be a good beer , but nothing more .<ssssss>while i would be more than happy to drink this for free , i think i will stick with girardin if i be shell out 8 + buck a bottle .<ssssss>-lrb- bottled june 2008 -rrb-<ssssss>
10 7 5 7 6		take from a competition .<ssssss>a - pour clear golden with 3 finger of well-carbnated head .<ssssss>dissipate slowly and exhibit great retention with beautiful lacing .<ssssss>s - minerally and honey .<ssssss>t - minerally , honey , and spicy hop .<ssssss>m - very cloying , tangy and sweet .<ssssss>may not have fully attenuate .<ssssss>d - overall , look can be deceive .<ssssss>
10 8 10 8 8		appearance - a copper amber pour , three finger of creamy foam set up camp and look to hang out a while .<ssssss>lace ring like tree ring mark the beer 's progress into the reviewer .<ssssss>aroma - have a strong piny , minty aroma .<ssssss>remind I of mint leave .<ssssss>intense , no hold bar .<ssssss>you know what you be in for here .<ssssss>not a complex set of smell but most unmistakeable .<ssssss>taste - a malty , biscuity foreground that taste pretty good but seem thin compare to the hop level .<ssssss>there be just no deny what this beer be here to do .<ssssss>intensely grassy , minty , like concentrated grapefruit oils .<ssssss>there be generally a medicinal by-product element associate with such heavy hop , and this one be no exception .<ssssss>there be enough hop flavor to keep this at a somewhat restrained level , which i find a asset .<ssssss>the swallow allow a bit of toasty malt to show through , more so when i be not expect it rather than when i try to taste it .<ssssss>the finish be a little more medicinal than i would like , but it be be hold in check 'til now , i can hardly complain after such a rush of flavor .<ssssss>peanut at the dilly deli comment that this be what he remember the original sierra nevada pale ale tasting like back at ` the begin ' .<ssssss>wow , what a treat to get this out of the tap every ho hum day , huh ?<ssssss>as full a hop flavor as you be likely to find in any beer anywhere , but not the malty foundation it need to kick intergalactic ass .<ssssss>mouthfeel - plenty of oily slickness to keep this one glide down .<ssssss>the carbonation level be very upbeat and set the flavor off just right for the style .<ssssss>drinkability - too intense for much sessionability , but this be one fine brew .<ssssss>could pass for a ipa really , at the very least would fit the bill for a ` imperial pale ale ' if there be such a thing .<ssssss>
8 9 10 8 9		a : very , very dark brown , almost black .<ssssss>pour with a massively carbonate tannish head that recede fairly quickly into a thin cap .<ssssss>s : belgian yeast be very prominent give this one a pretty unique aroma .<ssssss>spicy .<ssssss>dark fruit and raisin .<ssssss>good caramel malt component .<ssssss>t/m : everything on the smell .<ssssss>yeasty , with lot of spicy note .<ssssss>big malt backbone with dark fruit and candi sugar .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be awesome .<ssssss>lot of carbonation and a crisp relatively dry finish .<ssssss>very mild linger bitterness remind you there be hop here too .<ssssss>d : very drinkable .<ssssss>this be a very good beer that i be glad to be able to try .<ssssss>a benchmark as a well-crafted dubbel .<ssssss>but be it worthy of a top 10 rating on my list ?<ssssss>probably not .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 10		the beer as it set in the st. bernardus trappist glass a very deep cherry , almost brown with the head a light tan majestic crown that be somewhat creamy in its texture and the lace a satin veil to seal of the glass .<ssssss>the aroma of sweet malted grain , over ripe plum , yeast , crisp and fresh with a bit of tartness , a real treasure to the sens , start be sweet malt and the top middling in its feel .<ssssss>finish be humane in its acidity with the hop cordial in they spiciness , aftertaste be dry , slightly sour , a fine quaffing brew .<ssssss>

8 7 4 8 8		overall , the stability and consistency of this offering be lack .<ssssss>i have have extremely off pint , but on the whole still enjoy this selection from the lineup at the traverse city pub .<ssssss>head seem to have good retention , but be not impress with the nose .<ssssss>a good portion of caramel at time , but the bitterness seem to shine through occasionally .<ssssss>most disappointing be the mouth feel -- far to thin for a brown !<ssssss>color be excellent , very dark and convincing by sight .<ssssss>taste be nutty and roasted , but lack complexity .<ssssss>a great accompaniment to the olive burger though .<ssssss>if in town , be sure to get a belgian and a basket of fries !<ssssss>
9 8 8 10 9		this be the first bruery beer i try , and now i be finally get around to review it .<ssssss>pour some large white foamy head atop a murky golden body .<ssssss>the head take some time to die down , reemerge quickly upon agitation , wih the leg thick and sexy as i tilt the glass .<ssssss>aroma of earthy , spicy goodness like only a quality farmhouse ale exhibit .<ssssss>interesting , i think i smell some popcorn or something slightly buttery .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>flavor include deep , meaty rye with a light funkiness from the brett combine with that quality saison spiciness .<ssssss>everything balance out perfectly , even though i be not always the biggest fan of rye-induced beer .<ssssss>this and rugrod -lrb- both from the bruery -rrb- be the two notable exception .<ssssss>mouthfeel be light and tingly from the carbonation .<ssssss>become a little thin as it warm .<ssssss>overall , i love the rue .<ssssss>it be the bruery 's original flagship beer and for good reason : its innovative take on a saison add new flavor while tilt its hat to the thing we love about the style .<ssssss>pretty much perfect .<ssssss>

6 6 7 5 4		22oz bottle , a extra from lazerlobe , into a duvel tulip .<ssssss>thanks , warren !<ssssss>a : a fairly hard pour yield a scant half inch of coarse off-white foam atop a hazy light amber body .<ssssss>a bit dull , but not horrible .<ssssss>s : saison , really ?<ssssss>this be closer akin to a big tripel , with huge amount of bready malt and alcohol dominate .<ssssss>cherry be present as well , but it remind I more of the red dip at dairy queen than a good cherry beer .<ssssss>as much as i love a cherry dilly bar , this one be not really do it for I .<ssssss>t : cherry -lrb- again , dq -rrb- be always in play , although they recede into the background as the flavor develop .<ssssss>alongside the sweet + sour fruit note be flavor of banana , bread , oak , spice , and booze .<ssssss>the ethanol on the aftertaste get rather oppressive .<ssssss>this taste nothing like a saison , and really nothing like any beer i have have .<ssssss>unfortunately , uniqueness be not a good thing in this case .<ssssss>m : surprisingly light body , with carbonation to match .<ssssss>interesting .<ssssss>i wish it be livelier , but it be not bad at all .<ssssss>d : nope .<ssssss>i be go to be struggle to get through the bomber , that be for sure .<ssssss>i have have hotter 10 % beer , but this be up there .<ssssss>note : a cherry saison age with french oak sound awesome , but southern tier really shoot themselves in the foot by insist on make this beer `` imperial . ''<ssssss>the added alcohol bring with it flavor and aroma that just kill the potential for delicacy and complexity - whatever character the yeast could have bring out just get subsume in a wave of booze .<ssssss>bigger be not always better .<ssssss>cheer !<ssssss>

8 4 9 6 6		buy a single of this to try , but grab one out of the case next to the shelf in hope of get one with minimal light exposure .<ssssss>pour a nice clear golden with a average head that dissapate before i take a drink smell a bit skunky -lrb- surprise surprise -rrb- with some sweetness in there .<ssssss>initially bitter with a touch of skunkiness , but the skunk taste exit quickly and a sweet caramelly , malty flavor take over , with perhaps some apple cider in the background .<ssssss>hop be also present , but nowhere near the level they could be .<ssssss>go down smooth , and as it warm up a bit it get a tad sweeter , with a almost buttery mouthfeel .<ssssss>worth a try but nothing i would seek out again .<ssssss>id hate to try one that be sit on the shelf next to the light .<ssssss>
8 10 6 10 10		i have this in a mix and match for 2.50 .<ssssss>i wish i could find a case -lrb- or at least in a variety case -rrb- because this have become one of my favorite cherry ale 's !<ssssss>a - hazy pinkish in color .<ssssss>s - tart cherry 's t - omg this be great !<ssssss>it be exactly the tartness i want with a almost candy tasting cherry flavor !<ssssss>m - coat the mouth well and every sip be a treat d - most would say a few but i could drink the entire 4 pack in a row with no problem .<ssssss>overall a great ale from founder next to the pale ale and scottish ale respectively .<ssssss>i could drink this every week !<ssssss>

6 8 5 5 5		this be not good at all , it taste bitter and like artifishel raspberry and sweetner , and leave a horabal aftertaste in my mouth .<ssssss>this be way to bitter , it make I kringe at every sip .<ssssss>this be a drain pour for sure and this instantly give I hart burn .<ssssss>this be by far southern tier 's worst beer ever<ssssss>
6 6 5 6 9		pour into a pint glass from 12 oz bottle .<ssssss>a - a very golden carbonated beer that leave a thick foamy head that dissipate quickly .<ssssss>s - a slight malty smell with a little trace of hoppy fragrance .<ssssss>t - a light wheat taste with a slight lemon blast at the end .<ssssss>a little watery and leave the palate clean feeling .<ssssss>mf - very smooth and light .<ssssss>not much here !<ssssss>d - very easy to drink .<ssssss>this be a decent beer , but there be so many other wheat beer out there that i prefer .<ssssss>although it would be a step up from a `` lite '' beer when drink all day or out in the sun .<ssssss>
9 9 8 6 7		pick this up a while ago at binny .<ssssss>finally get around to it .<ssssss>serve in a pisgah pint glass .<ssssss>a - pour with two finger of dark mocha foam that dissipate fairly quickly to a thickish cap .<ssssss>there be a few tiny speck of lace .<ssssss>body be a super dark brown that be only a tiny bit lighter with a touch of reddish glow at the fringe .<ssssss>s - huge cocoa smell - remind I of hershey 's chocolate syrup .<ssssss>there be also a nice amount of roastiness and some floral hop , but milk chocolate be incredibly intense and just take over .<ssssss>i do not even know if i would be able to tell if this be beer if you give it to I blind .<ssssss>it be a little mono-dimensional , but it doer exactly what it set out to do .<ssssss>t - the taste be a big step down - light cocoa , roasted malt , and a strange earthy and slightly unpleasant aftertaste .<ssssss>i be not sure if that be what rogue describe as `` chocolate truffle finish '' , but it taste like dirt to I .<ssssss>the initial taste be more of a 3.5 / 4.0 but the aftertaste drag it down .<ssssss>m - higher carbonation than i would expect - tingle a little and burn a touch at the back end .<ssssss>medium body that be fairly smooth once the carbonation die down .<ssssss>lot of residual stickiness that unfortunately carry that weird aftertaste with it -lrb- although i be not go to punish the mouthfeel for the taste -rrb- .<ssssss>d - the abv be low and well-hidden , and the carbonation , while higher , be not bloaty .<ssssss>i just can not deal with that weird aftertaste , although it dissipate quickly enough that the beer be still fairly drinkable -lrb- and you can always drink more to cover it up ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>
6 5 7 8 8		pour from a 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle into a chimay goblet ... it be a hazy orange color with a really small white head .<ssssss>smell strong of wheat , with a little hint of apple .<ssssss>no real belgian spice that i would associate with a belgian ale .<ssssss>the taste be better , spicy , fruity , floral note ... pretty good .<ssssss>certainly better than expect after the aroma .<ssssss>pretty solid mouthfeel too , bubbly , carbonate , not too thin ... good .<ssssss>easy to drink , the alcohol do not come through strong at all .<ssssss>end up a pretty decent beer i think .<ssssss>

9 4 3 4 3		500ml can pour into pint glass oct16 2009 a crystal clear golden yellow with load of tiny bubble .<ssssss>decent one finger head have great retention and leave decent lace down the glass be sweet grain with some booze and some petrol t not much better then the smell , pretty bad you know this beer have one purpose and that be get drunk without spend money m/d i have never drink petrol but i would guess it would feel something like this .<ssssss>it have good carbonation but it help spread the taste around you mouth make it harder to drink .<ssssss>i find that the less time this beer be in my mouth the better .<ssssss>look great but it make you gag as you swallow and that be a trait i do not like in my beer<ssssss>
8 8 7 5 6		pour a big , bubbly light amber , like a cider .<ssssss>big puffy head that still have a good 1/4 inch on it a hour later .<ssssss>a absolute ton of yeast floaty , it appear like 50/50 beer and floaty .<ssssss>really do not taste they , though .<ssssss>also some appear as black fleck in the head .<ssssss>aroma be strongly spicy and floral , with a big boozey sense .<ssssss>a lot like it taste , except it work a lot better on the nose .<ssssss>first of all , this be a slick , floral beer .<ssssss>it also taste soapy , like you sometimes get in very hoppy beer .<ssssss>this be not hoppy , but still soapy .<ssssss>also , it taste acetic to I .<ssssss>like vinegar , but i do not get any oxidization , so i do not think it be that .<ssssss>third , it be spicy .<ssssss>like crazy spicing , even more than you get normally from christmas beer .<ssssss>fourth , it be boozey .<ssssss>a definite sipper , but even then , it be still a adventure .<ssssss>some burn go down the throat .<ssssss>these flavor tend to dominate .<ssssss>some pluminess , and a bit of sweetness , but overall these two be subdue by the rest .<ssssss>if this be what the brewer be go for , it be very well make .<ssssss>if not , maybe i have a bad bottle , i do not know .<ssssss>but this be a struggle to get through .<ssssss>it be bubbly and big and carbonated , but all of those other aspect just be not meld well for I .<ssssss>
10 4 4 5 4		it take different stroke to make the world go around , and contrary to the good review here and the recommendation of nasser at beer mania to give this a try , i do not really care for it .<ssssss>i love sour , and this beer have sour in spade , but it also have a kind of cloying sweetness that i find unpleasant and difficult to drink .<ssssss>it pour black with a fine sticky head .<ssssss>aroma be sour but also offer a pungent vinegar smell which i find unpleasant .<ssssss>flavor be sour cherry with a very sweet aftertaste that cling to the tip of my tongue .<ssssss>too sweet and sticky for taste .<ssssss>sour = good .<ssssss>too sweet = bad .<ssssss>adjudication of the two = not so good .<ssssss>i would not recommend this beer .<ssssss>i have this bottle at beer mania in brussels .<ssssss>
8 4 6 6 6		pour beer into a tumbler at 50 degree .<ssssss>beer be very pale with a big foamy head that be nice and white .<ssssss>high carbonation .<ssssss>beer smell a little sour but do not taste so .<ssssss>thick mouthfeel bready tasting but kinda watery .<ssssss>bland describe this beer pretty well .<ssssss>decent but nothing great an because of this i will not but again .<ssssss>
8 5 6 9 9		have this beer plenty of time in the past , but have not get a chance to review it yet .<ssssss>pour a nice reddish amber color with a little cloudiness .<ssssss>pretty but not as deep and breathtaking as other ipa 's i have have .<ssssss>smell likle a ipa , but it be not strong enough for I .<ssssss>i like a ipa with a huge bouquet of flowery hopness .<ssssss>this one have a fresh , spicy smell , but lack a lot of the citrusy , grassy note i prefer .<ssssss>taste : very well balanced .<ssssss>it have that initial hop bite , a little grassiness , citrus , nut , but it finish smoothly without the bitter aftertaste of hoppier ipa 's .<ssssss>mouthfeel - thin , which i would excpect from the style .<ssssss>it lack the full body of other rock art beer but i guess that be the idea .<ssssss>a little more fizz would be nice .<ssssss>drinkabilty : a very drinkable beer - well balanced , sweet and hoppy without a bitter aftertaste , and a light enough body to make it really swiggable .<ssssss>great with a nice flavorful pizza .<ssssss>
6 8 8 6 5		this must be the least enjoyable rouge `` ale '' i have have so far ... it look ok , deep golden orange hue with thin , soapy head .<ssssss>the aroma be very pleasant with a nice balance of sweet toast malt and domestic -lrb- that be usa -rrb- hop .<ssssss>the flavor be just plain weird to I .<ssssss>i do not know what it be but there be something ... i dunno ... `` green '' tasting about the combination of hoppiness and sweet malt in the middle .<ssssss>finish with a sweetish , smoky flavor that continue with the oddness .<ssssss>what be most odd about this `` ale '' be that it be not a ale at all .<ssssss>it be a maibock , which be a german lager beer .<ssssss>it be as much a ale as bill cosby be a young white dude .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		i have this beer pour from a 12oz bottle pour into a chill pint glass .<ssssss>the beer pour great with a nice dark amber color that pass very little light through it , a nice tan color one finger head and good lacing on the glass .<ssssss>the beer have a great blend a caramel sweetness , some roasted malt , and mild chocolate scent that come together nicely .<ssssss>the taste be much the same with a sweet caramel taste up front that blend into a roasted malt and mild chocolate follow up , it work well together .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be average with good carbonation but a mild flavor from the chocolate .<ssssss>overall , a great altbier from a brewer i have never have before .<ssssss>recommend .<ssssss>
8 8 8 6 7		good dark amber / musty orange color , slight haze , good creamy head with moderate retention .<ssssss>nice belgian aroma , typically fruity and yeasty , but this have a more predominant hop aroma as well , more like a true ipa .<ssssss>the aroma be definitely a hybrid of the belgian fruity yeast and the ipa 's expect hop-heavy aroma .<ssssss>good citrus and a very thin tropical fruit note .<ssssss>taste be much more like a normal ipa than a belgian .<ssssss>the fruitiness be lose to hop .<ssssss>that be say , it be a refreshing and clean beer , with good carbonation and a healthy medium body .<ssssss>not a terrible beer , not even a mediocre beer , just do not have that true hybrid flavor as the name would have suggest .<ssssss>the beautiful aroma and color of this brew be the highlight .<ssssss>worth a try , but i be not go out of my way for it .<ssssss>
8 10 7 8 8		i pour this from a 330ml clear bottle into a tulip pint glass .<ssssss>a = this ale pour a bright orange/gold color with a 1/2 '' white head .<ssssss>the head drop fast and do not leave much in the way of lace .<ssssss>s = this be a very aromatic ale .<ssssss>i note malty caramel , toffee , oak , and vanilla as the predominant aroma .<ssssss>t = base on the smell this beer should be sweet and cloying but it be not .<ssssss>start off malty sweet but that be temper by the oaky note and the hint of bittereness that lick the edge to keep the sweetness in check .<ssssss>much like the smell i find flavor of toffee , vanilla , and oak to be way upfront .<ssssss>finish be still on the sweet side and quite delicious .<ssssss>mf = heavy side of medium body with a moderate carbonation level .<ssssss>d = sort of a strong-ish scottish ale that gain a lot of flavor and complexity from the oak barrel .<ssssss>i will admit that when my wife hand this to I in the lcbo i didn ; t want to buy it because of the clear bottle .<ssssss>now that i have have it i be kick myself for not buy more !<ssssss>very complex and very well make .<ssssss>
9 8 4 6 7		12 oz bottle , `` best by '' month be not notch , pour into my duvel tulip .<ssssss>the beer pour a nice orange color , and a aggressive pour yield a initially massive off white head , that fade to a one finger height before linger .<ssssss>a impressive amount of lacing in generate , almost enough to garner a 5 .<ssssss>the nose be a decent blend of bready malt and floral hop , with a little bit of citrus throw in for good measure .<ssssss>the taste follow suit , bready malt sweetness and a brief flash of barely there bitterness yield to the previously note hop flavor in the finish .<ssssss>it be all a bit weak though , both the hop bite and the flavor , even for a pale ale , and the result be a beer that taste a little bit water down .<ssssss>the slightly thin mouthfeel probably contribute to that impression as well , and the carbonation could stand to be a little bit higher well , to help highlight the hop .<ssssss>the beer be fairly easy drinking , but with all the other issue i have with it , i be not exactly eager to gulp this one down .<ssssss>
8 8 6 5 6		this be a little darker than i expect .<ssssss>this beer look pretty good from it be appearence .<ssssss>it be a redish color brew with good thick head on it .<ssssss>the smell be nice and piny , it make my mouth water from all the spicy hop aroma the brew have come off of it .<ssssss>the flavor be no quite where i think it should be on this beer .<ssssss>i find that for a double ipa that it would have be a little more bitter or citrusy .<ssssss>the flavor be kind of mellow and do not really tingle my palette at all .<ssssss>i feel that this beer be a little on the bland side .<ssssss>the mouthfeel of this be good .<ssssss>it be heavy enough to be a imperial but overall i be not that impressed with this beer .<ssssss>
4 4 6 4 4		straw color , small fading head and lot of bubble .<ssssss>not really any smell , a bit of grain mostly corn .<ssssss>taste be really watery , but have a bit of corn sweetness and be very smooth .<ssssss>body be very light with lot of carbonation .<ssssss>drink very easily .<ssssss>beer pong ?<ssssss>
7 10 8 8 7		12 oz .<ssssss>bottle pour into a imperial pint glass appearance - a beautiful copper color with a significant white head that last all the way to end .<ssssss>clinging lace linger after the beer be finish .<ssssss>a little bit on the hazy side with some identifiable chunk float around but all in all a good look beer .<ssssss>smell - huge hop aroma .<ssssss>pine , grapefruit , apricot from the hop with a nice caramel malt aroma .<ssssss>really quite amazing .<ssssss>taste - at first all the aroma take over and the taste be amazing .<ssssss>a little less of the malt flavor than i expect but the hop spread out and coat my tongue with oily goodness .<ssssss>however the bitterness just seem to be a little bit too much .<ssssss>i love it at first , but it just linger on my tongue and overwhelm my sens to the point that each sip seem less and less interesting until the bitterness just take over .<ssssss>that first sip be heavenly though .<ssssss>mouthfeel - i like the dryness of it , but the body seem a little too big for the lack of sweetness .<ssssss>again the bitterness just cling to my mouth .<ssssss>drinkability-could i drink this all night ?<ssssss>yes .<ssssss>would i want to ?<ssssss>well , maybe .<ssssss>if the finish be a little bit cleaner i would go back for more a little bit quicker .<ssssss>conclusion - a superb beer but definitely not my favorite ipa .<ssssss>i think the 94 ibus be a little to much for a ~ 7 % abv beer .<ssssss>if they could use the same amount of hop but push more of they to the aroma side and bring it down to maybe 80 ibus i think just enough of the malt could push through to balance this beer while still keep it dry and refreshing .<ssssss>
7 8 7 4 6		good rich smell , malt and something unidentifiable .<ssssss>seem to be promising .<ssssss>the taste leave something to be desire for I though .<ssssss>there be a difference between `` smoky '' and `` burnt to a crisp '' .<ssssss>this taste like someone roasted the malt way too long .<ssssss>mouthfeel be decent , though a bit thin for the style .<ssssss>this be a ok beer , but i feel i can do much better in the price range .<ssssss>

9 10 8 8 8		presentation : this beer come in one of rouge 's signature screen-printed 750ml bottle -lrb- pretty cool -rrb- .<ssssss>appearance : it pour out like a reddish motor oil .<ssssss>i get a very nice 3 finger head that be a chocolaty light brown with a cherry red tint to it .<ssssss>this stout sit in the glass a brown that be so dark it look black .<ssssss>while pour it i could see the reddish hue and when i tip the glass or swirl it could again see the red/brown hue that look black again when the glass return to the table .<ssssss>this be completely opaque with absolutely no light pass through .<ssssss>smell : as the name would suggest it be overwhelmingly chocolate -lrb- pleasantly though , this be a good thing -rrb- .<ssssss>open the bottle before i even pour it i could tell it be chocolate .<ssssss>while pour it i could smell the chocolate and as the head rise , it force more chocolate smell up into my nose .<ssssss>this be not a beer that you have to go hunt for the aroma ; instead it reach out of the glass , slap you in the face and shout ` notice I ' !<ssssss>i like that .<ssssss>it be bold .<ssssss>after the chocolate smell be do slapping I in the face i notice a smell of dark cherry , and another dark sweet smell of black licorice or maybe birch beer , and then earthy coffee undertone .<ssssss>fantastic .<ssssss>taste : for as much chocolate as you smell , the taste -lrb- fortunately -rrb- be not terribly overwhelmingly chocolate ; it be more moderate .<ssssss>the taste of course be like the smell but it be a bit less complicated .<ssssss>the chocolate flavor be wrap around a red , slightly cherry , almost birch or rootbeer flavor .<ssssss>but not the soda .<ssssss>not the birch or root after they have be sweeten more like the birch bark .<ssssss>it be slightly sweet but the sweet have a significant tart to it in the aftertaste that make you tongue curl up on the edge as you swallow .<ssssss>by the end of the glass the coffee -lrb- and tar-ish -rrb- flavor come forward more to sit beside the chocolate .<ssssss>mouthfeel : certainly a full-bodied beer .<ssssss>very thick feeling but not overly heavy -- maybe a medium push toward heavy .<ssssss>dry !<ssssss>the aftertaste leave you mouth with a tart dry feeling -lrb- like it need a chaser -rrb- .<ssssss>fortunately have a bit of chocolate nearby work as the perfect chaser to take the sharp tip off of the tartness .<ssssss>drinkability : this be a very drinkable beer ; however the tartness in the aftertaste require one of two thing -lrb- for I -rrb- ; either immediately take one after another sip to keep the front end flavor , which speed up the inevitable inebriation ; or drink with food , use you chocolate , desert , or meal as a chaser , which prolong the glass .<ssssss>in either case it be still very pleasant on the front end , and very manageable on the backend .<ssssss>i recommend this beer .<ssssss>enjoy .<ssssss>hope this be helpful .<ssssss>cheer !<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 8		pour a brilliant light copper with a thin off-white head .<ssssss>hop first , pine , earth , a touch of grapefruit , follow by a heaping share of malty aromas-caramel , bread , and a touch of cocoa grapefruit and orange hit the palate first , then pine , with the caramel , bread , and hint of cocoa make a appearance before the citrus show back up and clear out with a piney , herbal quality that linger .<ssssss>medium-bodied and effervescent , very clean feeling .<ssssss>i definitely would not mind down a few of these .<ssssss>

8 6 9 9 8		pour a clear and dark brown color with a instant huge creamy head .<ssssss>not really attractive until after all the foam finally settle .<ssssss>the smell be also interesting and complex with strong vinous , leather , and prune ester .<ssssss>the flavor be similar with fig/prune flavor , warm vinous flavor , and a pleasant campfire smokiness .<ssssss>the smokiness continue through the finish which be gradual and slow .<ssssss>
9 9 6 8 8		a black with mahogany highlight .<ssssss>khaki head drop quickly into a stable , medium size halo around the glass .<ssssss>nice lace .<ssssss>s rich , fresh brew coffee .<ssssss>mocha and cream .<ssssss>nesquik .<ssssss>dark roasted hazelnut .<ssssss>trace of vanilla .<ssssss>t smooth , raw coffee flavor with lightly roasted edge be load throughout the profile .<ssssss>alcohol make a cameo in the middle , and bittersweet dark chocolate round out the finish .<ssssss>my only quam be that the flavor seem disparate and i would have like to see a bit more integration .<ssssss>theres no date on the bottle though , so its possible a little age could help solve the problem .<ssssss>m disappointingly thin .<ssssss>medium/light body with a light dry finish .<ssssss>o nice coffee flavor that avoid any notion of harsh bitter char .<ssssss>net balance of the profile be sweet ; on style for what be technically a imperial milk stout .<ssssss>
9 9 5 8 7		as one of the most well-regarded beer in the world , this one stand proudly and confidently as a shine example of the style .<ssssss>regard its appearance , it be just dark .<ssssss>i will not call it black , but the brown and red of this beer seem to hide within in a effort to avoid be label .<ssssss>the aroma and flavor certainly be not try to hide , though .<ssssss>the aroma be pack with bold note of plum , raisin , and yeast that be expect from the style .<ssssss>the flavor be likewise a bold combination of dark fruit that be easily the most potent of any of the quad or belgian strong dark ale that i have try .<ssssss>this boldness in both the flavor and aroma be impressive and enjoyable , but it come at a bit of a cost , as the flavor start get quite sweet as the beer warm .<ssssss>in addition , in contrast to some other belgian -lrb- and belgian-style -rrb- beer , the texture be largely unremarkable and do not provide any relief from the sweet fruitiness of the flavor .<ssssss>overall , this beer can serve as a benchmark against which the flavor of other quad and belgian strong dark ale be compare , but the potency of flavor be just a bit too much , and this beer break down just short of excellence .<ssssss>

7 8 7 5 4		beer pour directly into the middle of the glass and only a small thin head form .<ssssss>the beer give a hazy apple juice like color .<ssssss>this beer be unfiltered , so it be get lot of stuff float about .<ssssss>it have a sweet , piney smell , with a fruity malt backbone .<ssssss>oh my hop !<ssssss>if you like hop , here you go .<ssssss>.<ssssss>for I , there be not enough malt backbone to counteract the hoppiness .<ssssss>there be a small grapefruit flavor , but this beer be all about the hop .<ssssss>a wonderful mouthfeel on this one , but the hop be very bitey and strong to enjoy a lot of , for I at least .<ssssss>too hoppy to be really drinkable for I .<ssssss>
9 10 8 8 9		16 oz .<ssssss>can split with atspring ... thanks to deliriumfest for the trade .<ssssss>pour a gorgeously deep mahogany hue , clear with a active carbonation level .<ssssss>the off-white fluff of rocky head build to a inch before slowly decline to a patchy cap , leave sticky , fat ring of lacing in the process .<ssssss>hard to beat this aroma : perfect balance of toffee and caramel malt combine with resinous , citrus hop .<ssssss>flavor be just as balanced , with sweet toffee and amber malt lead the way .<ssssss>the body could use a touch more hop , but the greenery soon make itself know , deliver a sticky , piny finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium-light in body , somewhat viscous , with a decent carbonation level for a can .<ssssss>overall , a solid ipa that rank up there with some of the best .<ssssss>as atspring and i agree , it be right between oscar blues ' dale 's pale and gordon .<ssssss>i would certainly have this again .<ssssss>
8 5 5 4 7		look - awesome artwork , cool cat .<ssssss>sweet notch in the label to tell you when the `` best by '' date be .<ssssss>love the little saying under the cap .<ssssss>pour yellow-brown and settle light amber in the glass .<ssssss>cloudy with very little fizz .<ssssss>decent , foamy head .<ssssss>smell - smell of malt and hop , just what i expect from a ipa , nothing special here .<ssssss>taste - instant hoppy bite , follow by little to no creaminess .<ssssss>i be hope for more flavor or some zing , also would have be better if it be a tad bit creamier .<ssssss>mouthfeel - hoppy mouthfeel , pretty standard for a ipa , no point here for originality .<ssssss>drinkability - pretty drinkable if you like this style of beer , which i tend to .<ssssss>a pale ale would probably be more prefer by the average drinker .<ssssss>this be not as good as blind faith -lrb- by magic hat -rrb- , and for a really good apa try fat angel -lrb- by magic hat -rrb- .<ssssss>this beer just do not stand up against the other of its kind by magic hat .<ssssss>
7 7 6 5 8		a-the color of this beer be very nice if a bit hazy .<ssssss>it pour a beautiful two-finger head of huge cream-colored bubble that dissipate quickly and leave no lace -lrb- could be my glass ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>s - a real raspberry smell .<ssssss>nothing too artificial or sugary in it .<ssssss>on the flip side , there be no obvious malt , hop , or yeast smell .<ssssss>the smell get I invest in drinking this .<ssssss>t - the raspberry be there , through and through , but its sweetness , rather than compliment the hop bitterness , clash to create a juice-after-toothpaste type adverse flavor reaction -lrb- to speak hyperbolically -rrb- .<ssssss>otherwise it be fairly mellow .<ssssss>it be a better representative of this category than some other .<ssssss>d - i see no reason not to have another , but this be probably a better first beer of the night than anything else .<ssssss>
7 2 5 2 4		the pour be pretty , i will give it that , nice head , soem lacing , but that all that good about this beer .<ssssss>it smell and taste like you squeeze a pound of strawberry into a glass of simple syrup , cloyingly sweet , no depth , no nuance , horrible beer , avoid it like the plague .<ssssss>
8 8 9 7 7		batch 9970 -lrb- 11/2010 -rrb- pour from a 12oz bottle to a snifter -lrb- 1/2012 -rrb- a : kind of a dull golden/copper color stream come out of the bottle .<ssssss>in the glass , it have a dull , murky rust brown color with a hint of ruby .<ssssss>small off-white head .<ssssss>it just look like what i think a old ale should look like-i could see this come out of a dusty 30-year old bottle .<ssssss>s : toffee and caramel with a hint of fruitiness -lrb- date ? -rrb-<ssssss>and some vague spiciness .<ssssss>alcohol be present , but barely .<ssssss>t : just like the smell , but with a substantial earthy tea-like bitterness , a hint of grapefruit rind , and a bit more alcohol than in the nose .<ssssss>just the slightest hint of cocoa powder -lrb- so slight it take I half the glass to even notice it -rrb- .<ssssss>m : perfect thickness-full body without be too syrupy .<ssssss>could use a touch less carbonation , as it highlight the bitterness and alcohol a bit too much , but that be just I be nit-picky .<ssssss>o : a good beer overall , but i think it might be in the `` awkward stage '' .<ssssss>this could be great when the flavor meld a bit more and mellow out -lrb- fortunately , i have get another bottle to hold on to for another year or two -rrb- .<ssssss>it might also be a bit better as a young , brash beer with somewhat bolder flavor .<ssssss>as it be , the sum of this beer be somehow just a little less than the sum of its part .<ssssss>still good , though , and i can not wait to try it with a bit more age !<ssssss>
5 4 5 4 8		very much a american version of coraona but not as dry .<ssssss>perhaps a bit higher alcohol content ?<ssssss>if you be look for a good swill beach/golfcourse beer this could be it .<ssssss>lack on so many level , but i suppose it have it be place .<ssssss>this be a very drinkable lager , but there just be not enough there to get I to buy it .<ssssss>
8 7 5 6 7		this brew have a light smoky malt aroma and deep brown color .<ssssss>the brew have a lighter smoky roasted malt flavor .<ssssss>the lighter body create a quite drinkable smoother brew , but not one that would be consider impressive for the style .<ssssss>

6 6 8 5 4		pour into a ayinger willybecher glass .<ssssss>crystal clear , light gold in color .<ssssss>a surprisingly small amount of bubble .<ssssss>almost no head , just a broken ring of foam around the inside of the glass .<ssssss>smell be almost non-existent - maybe a wisp sweetness - can not identify this sweetness as be malt .<ssssss>i do not detect the acetaldehyde `` green apple '' aroma that this beer be famous for ... .<ssssss>actually , if i really think about it , i think i get a little `` jolly rancher '' artificial apple aroma .<ssssss>i really have to imagine hard to smell it , i do not know if i would identify this if i be not look for it .<ssssss>absolutely no hop aroma .<ssssss>taste be no offensive and bland .<ssssss>the slight sweetness be well balance with a light hop bitterness .<ssssss>the texture of this beer complement its bland aroma and taste .<ssssss>it be very light and fizzy on the palate , it seem thinner than water .<ssssss>although i consider the beer to be boring i do find it to have a pleasant texture .<ssssss>drinkablity : overall , the beer be easy to consume -- almost no taste and absolutely nothing offensive about it .<ssssss>it feel good in the mouth and be light and non-filling .<ssssss>i give this beer a low score on drinkablity because there be nothing about it that would make I desire another .<ssssss>i do believe that it be possible to make a beer like this more interesting without depart from the basic style paradigm .<ssssss>
9 8 6 8 8		just saw this new arrival at my local beer store earlier today so i think i would give it a try .<ssssss>22 ounce bottle .<ssssss>serve in a guinness pint glass , the beer pour dark brown/black with a inch frothy tan head .<ssssss>head retention and lacing be both pretty good .<ssssss>aroma be roasted malt , coffee , chocolate and some grassy hop .<ssssss>the taste be pretty much like the aroma , with the bitter , roasty flavor be the strongest .<ssssss>mouthfeel/body be light/medium , it seem a bit thin and be well carbonated .<ssssss>overall i think it be a good brew , it be smooth , easy and enjoyable to drink .<ssssss>

10 9 6 9 8		the head on this beer be oddly slow to develop and thus i do not judge it well and overpour ... lovely tan foam run down the side of the glass .<ssssss>this beer be dark dark brown / black with a large billowy tan head that stick around for quite awhile and leave chunk of itself cling to the glass after each swig i take .<ssssss>this be not just lacing , it be like iceberg of foam make sweet love to the inside of my glass .<ssssss>aroma be very nice - piney hop , burnt malt , coffee , chocolate , maybe a little butterscotch sweetness .<ssssss>well-rounded and very appealing - not be able to take a sip at this point would be like torture .<ssssss>sip ... mmm !<ssssss>initial reaction : kahlua brownie .<ssssss>coffee and chocolate dominate throughout , with hop chime in very early on and linger in the finish .<ssssss>yum , yum .<ssssss>alcohol be well-hidden , only barely apparent in the finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a little watery though , not slick like i have hope , and leave a bit of a astringent feeling in my mouth .<ssssss>aftertaste of burnt wood be please .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit of a let-down , but otherwise this beer be top shelf stuff in my book .<ssssss>aroma , taste , appearance be all excellent .<ssssss>will definately be get more of this for myself and to share with friend .<ssssss>

6 5 7 4 5		a - pale amber color with a small head that leave little lacing .<ssssss>s - really sweet , orange , apricot , some banana , malt , a very faint hint of hop .<ssssss>t - malty at first , but quickly replace by the bitterness from the hop .<ssssss>bread .<ssssss>citrus , apricot , some grape , grass .<ssssss>m - medium body with medium carbonation .<ssssss>not impressed , the different taste do not mix well with each other .<ssssss>

9 8 7 10 8		a - a pitch brown fluid , dark as a moonless night on broadway .<ssssss>i do not know why i say that , i just think it describe the beer perfectly : -rrb- .<ssssss>on top rest a perfect beige head with hardly any retraction .<ssssss>s - a smooth blend of oak , tar , peat and black forest fruit .<ssssss>t - surprisingly different ris - it have chocolate , coffee and still a unusual fresh because of the fruit tone and the use hop .<ssssss>the booziness do not feel like the 16,5 % abv at all .<ssssss>m - a very drinkable , low to medium carbonated beer with a bitter finish .<ssssss>what i do miss be a thick creaminess in the body .<ssssss>o - what a pleasant to drink beer consider the abv and it even taste black - what be in a name ?<ssssss>after drink it a while you do get the idea its to overwhelming though .<ssssss>
7 7 7 5 8		22oz bottle , boulevard 25cl tulip .<ssssss>the pour be noticeably murky and the beer end up look like cloudy black tea , opaque and very much brown not red .<ssssss>a tight tan nearly half inch head form on the pour but become a decent ring , leave the middle mostly clear of foam .<ssssss>good retention for such a big , barreled beer .<ssssss>immediately noticeable be that distinctive bourbon bite that say america .<ssssss>what would we do without this corn distillate ?<ssssss>vanilla , sweet corn , caramel , toast oak ; it be more subtle barrel aroma , but so far there be not a lot to back it up .<ssssss>there be a clean , almost minty scent that i associate with some belgian yeast strain .<ssssss>there be obvious oak with some tannin and the bourbon .<ssssss>the spirit impart some of that back of the throat coating , cleaning , and singeing .<ssssss>also the usual suspect of vanilla and caramel with coconut and light dry fruit .<ssssss>the base beer be severely underachieve for I .<ssssss>the barrel aging be execute very well , though this just seem like another vehicle for bourbon flavor , not a addition of flavor to improve the base beer .<ssssss>medium body , very slick , medium-low carb .<ssssss>it sit on the palette like bourbon ; heavy and quite bitter of alcohol -lrb- a bit of hop bitterness -rrb- .<ssssss>amazingly , this score highest in drinkability .<ssssss>the fact that i like bourbon a lot couple with the smooth alcohol of this beer make it a hell of a easy drinker for a wild turkey 101 barrel aged 12 % barleywine .<ssssss>

9 8 10 8 9		review on draught at mcgrady 's irish pub in charlottesville , va .<ssssss>appearance : a thick , foamy head sit atop a gorgeous , slightly-hazy-but-largely-translucent orange amber body .<ssssss>active carbonation drift upward through the thick look haze , and splatter of sticky , web-like lacing speckle the side of the glass .<ssssss>wonderful .<ssssss>aroma : there be some lightly toast malt here , a very mellow caramel backbone .<ssssss>now that that be out of the way ... let 's talk about the hop .<ssssss>there be a lot of potent sharpness in the nose , no doubt from the columbus , but there be also a lot of pleasant , lighter aromatic - citrus , ethereal herbal and floral note .<ssssss>a very intense and oily nose .<ssssss>taste : the bitterness be pretty consistent throughout - it hit strong at first , and definitely round out each sip as well .<ssssss>the sweetness of the bready malt be more noticeable in the mouth than it be in the nose - although i would not go so far as to call it `` balanced '' - and that be a good thing , or else this beer might be less drinkable than it be .<ssssss>as far as individual hop flavor , yeah , it be all there - pungent grapefruit and pineapple flavor be all wrap up in the bitterness , as well as a few other earthy , woody note .<ssssss>alcohol be only faintly detectable .<ssssss>mouthfeel : one word .<ssssss>perfect .<ssssss>a amazing feeling beer - it be silky smooth , finely carbonate , medium body .<ssssss>`` oily '' be a word that come to mind , but that have a lot of negative connotation , so , yeah , anyway , it be fantastic .<ssssss>drinkability : pretty damn good .<ssssss>it be bitter , sure , but it be not just a hop bomb - it be sweet , lightly toasty , floral , fragrant , smooth , citrusy , etc .<ssssss>etc .<ssssss>etc .<ssssss>in essence , there be a lot of good stuff go on in this glass , and i could put away a few of these and enjoy every minute of it , no problem .<ssssss>one of my favorite ipa , this beer be absolutely rock solid .<ssssss>i just realize that i type that i could put away a few of these , no problem , and although that be probably true , i would advise do that on a full stomach , and not before you need to drive anywhere .<ssssss>either way , this be a delicious beer .<ssssss>it be coarse and rough in taste , but smooth in the mouthfeel ; it be sweet and dense in its foundation , but crisp , fruity , and floral in a big way up front ; and it be typically pretty inexpensive .<ssssss>a sure bet .<ssssss>
8 5 8 9 9		good , solid beer .<ssssss>bottle have a brew on and best before date .<ssssss>this be my first from this brewery .<ssssss>it pour very nice , good amount of head , decent retention .<ssssss>the color be black , when hold to the light only a slight amount of light even get through .<ssssss>i find the smell to be somewhat disagreeable .<ssssss>one certainly get the aroma of chocolate , and then of roasted malt , which i like , but the more i sniff it the more i get a rough alcohol smell .<ssssss>i do not think its soap from the glass , but i can not quite account for it ; because the taste give no indication of it .<ssssss>the taste be great .<ssssss>i think the roasted malt be the most present , but they be well balance with chocolate , maybe with a little bit of something spicy in there as well .<ssssss>some berry ?<ssssss>something creamy ?<ssssss>the aftertaste leave I a little unsure of what it be , but not disappointed .<ssssss>the malt remain , but otherwise it be a fairly clean , but also very dry aftertaste .<ssssss>good mouthfeel , a little more crisp than i would have think , but not very much .<ssssss>i like the balance , this be a very drinkable beer .<ssssss>
8 8 7 5 6		pour a dark copper , nearly amber color with a big fluffy white head which stick to the top of the glass and all the way down .<ssssss>smell be really grassy and full of pine .<ssssss>very earthy aroma .<ssssss>the taste be bitter up front with a strong caramel finish .<ssssss>honestly , a little too much caramel tasting malt for I .<ssssss>even a little alcohol on the finish .<ssssss>the bitterness be not very flavorful , just bitter .<ssssss>this beer smell a lot better than it taste .<ssssss>overall - probably would not buy again .<ssssss>i have no problem finish it , and it be enjoyable to drink , but there be much better option out there .<ssssss>i will take torpedo for half the price .<ssssss>
6 9 6 7 7		this beer pour a clear golden color without much head .<ssssss>the smell be quite hoppyvery entice .<ssssss>the taste be hoppy and bitter .<ssssss>there be hint of spice and citrus .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be full .<ssssss>i find this to be a very drinkable beer and keep it in the house for everyday drinking .<ssssss>
9 9 10 8 8		pour into a pint glass , black black black dark tan head , dark lace black out the side of the glass as i drink it .<ssssss>smell amazing , roasted malt , huge amount of hop for a stout .<ssssss>the taste be not as big as the smell , its almost tame by comparision , still damn good though .<ssssss>hoppy for a stout , but now it amost taste like a hoppy american stout instead of a ris .<ssssss>that aside i love this beer , great taste , the hoppiness be a great suprise and it hide the abv quite well .<ssssss>
10 7 10 8 8		bring a 2010 bottle of this to a tasting a little while back .<ssssss>receive from a generous trader .<ssssss>serve in a cigar city snifter as it would be crazy to drink this out of any other vessel .<ssssss>pour as dark as any bowel movement after a heavy day of drinking pepto-bismol , but with a lot better head retention .<ssssss>cigar city have a way of crafter thick stout that look great .<ssssss>smell be of chocolate and perhaps the faintest hint of vanilla , but the chili pepper be dominate and really detract from the aroma .<ssssss>taste be similar but slightly better .<ssssss>the pepper be not to my liking , but to each they own .<ssssss>mouthfeel be thick with smooth and creamy carbonation .<ssssss>this be a nice beer , but i would take marshal zhukov over this any day , but i be glad that i get the chance to try it .<ssssss>
8 5 6 7 7		i never be a big fan of samuel adam , but it be october and this be the only oktoberfest beer on tap at my local restaurant .<ssssss>the beer be serve on tap in a regular pint glass -lrb- not even the sam adam special glass -rrb- .<ssssss>the server say she be sorry that they do not have a orange slice to put in the beer .<ssssss>i do not ever recall have a orange in a oktoberfest beer so i tell she that be alright with I .<ssssss>the beer look a good fall amber color with a one and a half finger head that last quite a while and leave some good lacing .<ssssss>i could not detect any distinct smell and the taste be more malt that hop .<ssssss>the carbonation level be moderate -lrb- the special glass would have make more bubble and perhaps more flavor -rrb- .<ssssss>a good beer for intellectual wannabee to impress they friend , but not worthy of a true beer advocate .<ssssss>
6 9 7 6 7		i can not lie , i love lose abbey .<ssssss>i have have more la then any other brewery this past year , but i have not review they all -lrb- stupid -rrb- .<ssssss>as i pour into my snifter , i notice a foamy white quick to come and go white head .<ssssss>the color be a weird brown orange .<ssssss>it look like apple cider , with a unparralleled haziness .<ssssss>wow , ton of lemon , orange peel , gala apple , caramel , honey .<ssssss>very sweet and a little bit tart .<ssssss>very light in comparison to the smell .<ssssss>incredibly thick , tart lemon , and smooth orange with a very grainy taste , and a slight amount of grapefruit on the finish .<ssssss>slight hop kick in the center .<ssssss>
8 9 6 7 9		pour from a bottle marked 9446 indicate that it be package november 9 , 2009 .<ssssss>appearance : pour dark brown with a tan color head that linger throughout the entire beer .<ssssss>some floaty visible .<ssssss>smell : big roastiness jump out with pleasant note of dark chocolate/cocoa round out by some grassy hop .<ssssss>by far the beer best trait .<ssssss>taste : the roasted malt flavor dominate as indicate by the smell .<ssssss>roast malt initially follow by chocolate and grassy hop .<ssssss>not a whole lot of sweetness -- you get some upfront but its quickly overtake by mild hop bitterness .<ssssss>well balanced .<ssssss>mouthfeel : lack in mouthfeel consider this be a cream stout !<ssssss>i expect a hearty mouthfeel and it just fall short .<ssssss>not viscous enough and its compound by prickly carbonation .<ssssss>drinkability : i could drink a lot of these consider the great balance .<ssssss>another great beer from bell 's , but this fall short of what i have come to expect from a cream stout .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 7		pour a deep brown color with a dark tan head that quickly dissipate into a spotty bacterial ring laden top layer .<ssssss>smell like sweet molasses , earth , fruit , and a hint of alcohol .<ssssss>it be nice to get a barlywine like this as oppose to the hop-ridden stuff a lot of brewery tend to produce .<ssssss>the taste be dominate by thick caramel , sweet , roasty malt , minimal amount of alcohol , and some reserved cherry flavor .<ssssss>this beer be big enough to completely hide the usual `` alaskan '' house flavor -lrb- which be not a good or a bad thing , just a observation . -rrb-<ssssss>mouthfeel be absolutely phenomenal - probably the best of any barleywine i have have yet .<ssssss>drinkability be good , especially for the abv , but there be enough flavor here that my tastebud be pretty rip up after the first 22 oz .<ssssss>byfar my favorite offering from alaskan , and probably one of my top 5 barleywine thus far .<ssssss>
6 4 7 6 7		my can have a much different design than the bottle , but it be definitely the same beer .<ssssss>hopefully it be better than they no-reason-to-exist light beer .<ssssss>interesting note on the can : `` alcohol by volume over 4 % , not more than 6 % '' .<ssssss>as i pour i think `` my word , this stuff 's almost white ! ''<ssssss>but it be really a bland pale yellow .<ssssss>might as well be white/clear .<ssssss>the head retain well , and the bubble be abundant but sensible -lrb- ie .<ssssss>not like soda -rrb- .<ssssss>it be already better than they crappy light beer .<ssssss>aroma be entirely unattractive .<ssssss>boil corn , cook veggy , lemonade .<ssssss>all thing i like , but not in this context .<ssssss>the sweetness of lemonade come through in the flavor .<ssssss>a sugary edge , with a malty backup and a decent hoppy snap .<ssssss>for the style , it be decent and drinkable , if a bit ho-hum .<ssssss>mouthfeel be the best part of this beer , have a firm creaminess offset the crisper , shaper element that one would expect from the style .<ssssss>certainly drinkable , and not even a drainpour .<ssssss>but still , it be a matter of `` when in puerto rico ... '' with this one .<ssssss>and there be no reason to reach for the brewer 's light beer as long as this one 's around .<ssssss>but my wife , who kindly bring it back from puerto rico , say this be much harder to find than the light beer .<ssssss>do not that figure ...<ssssss>
7 4 7 7 7		after a great time with golden tire from fly dog , i be hopeful for this similar lager from the same brewery .<ssssss>pour into a rieder mug , there be very little head and lacing .<ssssss>a deep amber -lrb- slight red tint -rrb- hue sink through .<ssssss>smell be bad , almost non-existent , but what do exist be not pleasant for I .<ssssss>taste be a lot more bland than expect and i can not identify too many true color inside it .<ssssss>malty , slightly hoppy , a definite lager feeling to it .<ssssss>mouthfeel and drinkability be a bit higher , as this beer be both semi-creamy and easy to take down .<ssssss>overall , not my favorite in any way from fly dog .<ssssss>
9 8 8 6 7		appear a murky ruby brown hue with a large size off white beige head leave full band of even lace with each sip as i pour the beer the head float at least a inch above the rim of the chalice .<ssssss>aroma have deep pine , earthy hop and some bready caramel malt with trace of some sugary alcohol glaze fruit character as well .<ssssss>flavor be upfront bitter with a earthy dirt hop character hover across the palate some grapefruit rind as well mild sweetness to balance just a bit , caramel malt be soft well round with some mild fruitiness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium body with even carbonation hop oils be evident definitely streak across my tongue and attach to the enamel of my tooth .<ssssss>drinkability be decent i could picture thing blend better here very rogue , very bitter , but just okay .<ssssss>
7 7 4 6 7		pour with a thick head that dissipate quickly to large bubble and then to lacy island .<ssssss>look very heavily carbonate .<ssssss>tight aroma characteristic of a belgian witbier .<ssssss>not very spicy , only smell of corriander .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very thin and watery on the palate .<ssssss>the flavor have a almosty meaty taste to it .<ssssss>very little aftertaste but that aftertaste have a soft bready flavor .<ssssss>not surprising for a wheat base brew .<ssssss>it leave a lot of flavor to be desire though .<ssssss>very weak and tasting somewhat water down .<ssssss>
8 6 5 7 5		on tap at ray 's place in kent , oh .<ssssss>appearance - a sugary cream-like foam rest on top of this earth-toned beer .<ssssss>the beer itself be earthy brown and caramely tan and yellow .<ssssss>it have quite a solid and impressive lacing to the glass .<ssssss>smell - malt and caramel note overwhelm my nostril here .<ssssss>the hop be present but hide in the shadow .<ssssss>taste - much sweeter than i expect it to be .<ssssss>quite a heavy bourbon note that mask the hop .<ssssss>the bitters come on the finish .<ssssss>many floral and earthy note become more noticeable as i continue drinking .<ssssss>mouthfeel / drinkability - while drinkable , it be a little too sweet in a fruity way .<ssssss>it almost taste like it have porter-like characteristic to I .<ssssss>fairly light body .<ssssss>
7 6 8 5 6		serve in a gale sayer shaker pint glass .<ssssss>another shout-out to my brother 's increasingly improve beer selection .<ssssss>this one pour a clear pale straw top by a half-finger of white foam .<ssssss>the nose comprise wheat , light corn , and what seem like powdered sugar -lrb- though , admittedly , this may be my glass ... i just do not think so -rrb- .<ssssss>the taste hold note of light wheat , flower , light green , and a strong undercurrent of vinyl .<ssssss>yowza .<ssssss>the body be pretty light , with a light moderate carbonation , a watery feel , and a crisp finish .<ssssss>overall , be it not for the rubbery bitterness pervade this thing , it would be a pretty nice pil .<ssssss>alas ...<ssssss>
7 9 7 7 7		12oz .<ssssss>pour a near black color with a thin fizzy head that dissipate very quickly , but do leave some spotty lacing .<ssssss>aroma be very pleasant - smoke -lrb- burnt wood/campfire - maybe hint of some smoked meat -rrb- , some roasted malt , and some sweetness with hint of licorice and molasses .<ssssss>taste be similar to the aroma , only less complex - more smoke , some burnt malt & barley with note of spiciness .<ssssss>i be expect the complexity to come out as the ale warm , but it do not really change much .<ssssss>mouth-feel be thin-to-medium body with moderate carbonation and leave a tingle on the tongue .<ssssss>overall , good take on a smoked porter .<ssssss>
8 9 6 7 6		pour from a 500 ml bottle into my chimay goblet .<ssssss>short pour , so not much head , but what there be fade instantly and no lacing .<ssssss>cloudy golden color with persistent bubble .<ssssss>first smell off the nose be a massive whiff of mint .<ssssss>a hint of perhaps belgian-ish yeast .<ssssss>some lemon rind .<ssssss>on the mouth , weird .<ssssss>very thinly flavor .<ssssss>tart as hell , but not full on like a sour .<ssssss>herbacious to the max .<ssssss>citrus and something pleasantly medicinal .<ssssss>pretty thin bubbly mouthfeel .<ssssss>i dunno .<ssssss>this be my first gruit .<ssssss>i do not know what to say .<ssssss>

7 9 7 7 8		pour a slightly haze reddish brown , spotty head at best with minimal lacing .<ssssss>scent be a pleasant combination of spice and citrus with a solid sweet , but not overpower bready and carmely background .<ssssss>first sip be predominately mild spice and tropical fruit , the spice intensify as it warm , yet the citrusy hop presence fade slightly , the sweet and bready carmely background do not come through until the beer be almost at room temperature .<ssssss>medium body , slight touch of oilyness , but also slightly watery in the begining .<ssssss>im tear , have some good charachtertistic to it , but taste rather uneven and flat on some sip .<ssssss>
9 5 6 3 4		beautiful dark mahogany color with a light tan head get I excite to try this beer .<ssssss>the smell be fairly subdue with mostly cinnamon with some background malt .<ssssss>the taste be dominate by a metallic flavor that linger with lactic sourness .<ssssss>not good at all .<ssssss>i be assume that this be infected , so i would try another one next year .<ssssss>however , right now , i certainly do not want another .<ssssss>
10 8 4 3 2		pour a black brew impervious to light .<ssssss>smell be sweet and fruity with the expect coffee and chocolate aroma .<ssssss>grain sneak in under the stronger aroma .<ssssss>taste be very metallic !<ssssss>blah !<ssssss>taste like nail !<ssssss>i try but all i get be a iron taste .<ssssss>mouthfeel be thin .<ssssss>maybe i get a bad bottle but this be some bad stuff .<ssssss>i try to like this but i have to pour it out , rusty nail brau .<ssssss>

7 6 4 6 5		500ml brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap serve into tankard-esque english style mug in london , england .<ssssss>review live .<ssssss>a : four finger head of lovely cream lacing , great thickness , and good retention .<ssssss>nontransparent brown-amber colour .<ssssss>sm : cream , nut , and slight caramel .<ssssss>a mild strength aroma .<ssssss>t : heavy cream on the open , nice nut and amber hop , caramel , and light chestnut .<ssssss>quite nice for its simplicity .<ssssss>well balanced , but build only average .<ssssss>mf : too smooth and too wet .<ssssss>do not complement the flavour of the body .<ssssss>dr : slightly above average abv , decent drinkability , and pretty good quality .<ssssss>

7 9 6 7 6		a unsolicited gracious contribution from fellow ba and buddy rfgetz after he recent swing through new england ... a - two finger worth of fairly standard light tan color audibly fizzy have that quickly fade ... what be left be a full slightly thick veil of lacing ... the color be a light to medium brown ... there be a slight ruby hue when back light ... limited carbonation most of which sluggish and see climb along the side of the glass towards the top ... s - warm apple pie ... a abundance of sweet cinnamon sugar ... perhaps some pumpkin note as well ... caramel ... warm spiced wine ... pie crust ... country kitchen ... comforting ... t - all of the expect flavor be there , but they be muddle and a bit confused ... the apple and the cinnamon try to assert themselves but keep fall in and out between caramel , other spice , ginger snap , and pie crust ... it be not so much complexity as it seem to be confusion ... the spice linger for a bit on the finish ... m - on the lighter side of medium body ... a tad fizzy ... perhaps a bit thin ... fairly standard at best ... a odd spice after taste be a bit of a distraction ... d - a interesting brew to say the least ... the appearance be worthy and the nose be quite special , but after that everything teeter on average at best ... the 4.4 % abv be a definite plus ... creative and a seasonal worth a try , but i would recommend try a bottle before invest in any greater quantity ... .<ssssss>with a couple of tweak , this might be a really interesting offering worthy of more attention ...<ssssss>
6 8 6 6 4		there be a strong citrus grapefruit scent and a deep orange amber color upon pour , a nice foam head linger and stick to the side of the glass .<ssssss>a light bitterness greet I , but as it warm up i get more grape sweetness .<ssssss>i find myself wish i would have drink it as a whole warm .<ssssss>
8 8 6 9 9		i have this when it be on tap at spike 's in downtown san luis obispo .<ssssss>try it both on they normal tap and during the firkin party .<ssssss>it look somewhat cloudy , as be to be expect from a unfiltered beer .<ssssss>light refract off the yeast particle , make this one glow in the pub .<ssssss>smell of bread , definitely more yeast smell present than they regular dba .<ssssss>the taste be amazing .<ssssss>it be literally liquid bread , hearty and wholesome .<ssssss>a `` breadier '' version of the regulard dba , and better for it .<ssssss>unfortunately , the yeast leave a bit of a dry/gritty taste to the beer .<ssssss>this might be because i be towards the bottom of the firkin keg , but the usual smoothness be not there .<ssssss>thinking of it as a a unfiltered though , it be average .<ssssss>nowhere near as smooth as some of the unfiltered oatmeal stout i have have .<ssssss>i could drink this -lrb- okay , i do drink this -rrb- all night .<ssssss>at 5 % abv , it be not killer to put away a few pint , and the chewy breadiness make you take they at just the right speed .<ssssss>
8 5 8 9 9		surprising !<ssssss>have a nice fluffy cotton head that last the while ; sadly i detect next to no nose but that might have be the circumstance ; a dark american mahogany color but clear translucency ; a delightful fruity start lead to the taste of yeast commingled with a hop undertone give way to a cordial bitter finish at each sip ; the flavor finish long with a very comfortable mouthfeel .<ssssss>i could let this beer lounge upon my palate .<ssssss>actually very nice beer - worth put up against any of the fine doubel .<ssssss>
6 5 8 7 6		pour from the bomber into a oversized snifter .<ssssss>produce about a inch of brown froth that settle somwhat quickly to leave a generous cap of retention .<ssssss>color be black , no light penetration .<ssssss>aroma cold be lack stregth .<ssssss>oats and chocolate grain be what come to mind for aroma .<ssssss>bitter chocolate grain flavor , a small chalky flavor , which i guess to be hop , that turn a little aspirin like .<ssssss>oats again , and a very creamy thick texture with medium carbonation .<ssssss>a solid contender for the style , but somthe i would seek out ,<ssssss>
8 7 9 7 6		now * this * be a interesting wheat beer which i just pick up in madison , wi .<ssssss>from read the label , i could tell i be in for something a bit unique ... this one pour with a cloudy , light-ish , golden color .<ssssss>there be a thin head which persist , but it be not as thick as many german weizen .<ssssss>the aroma be a very good indicator of what be to come .<ssssss>there be definitely some german wheat beer character in there , but something else too .<ssssss>upon tasting , the unusual mix of character become much more apparent .<ssssss>there be a citrusy character infuse with the expect `` normal '' german character along with something else ... '' minty '' perhaps ?<ssssss>the label mention cascade hop and `` excessive dry hop '' .<ssssss>that explain a lot of what be go on here .<ssssss>the bitterness be not overwhelming , but it might be a little aggressive .<ssssss>i can not stop sip this brew and ponder the odd mix of flavor in it .<ssssss>with that be say , i be still not overly-enthusiastic about the end product 's mix of flavor as a whole .<ssssss>this be a very interesting brew which i be very happy i buy , but one 12oz bottle be probably more than enough for I .<ssssss>this ng brew probably fit into the same style as the schneider-brooklyner weiss .<ssssss>both weizen be heavily dry-hopped and be new interpretation of the style .<ssssss>kudos to new glarus for try new thing with the unplugged series .<ssssss>i wish more brewery would do the same !<ssssss>
7 7 10 9 8		a : nearly opaque , look mahogany when light be able to shine through .<ssssss>roasted marshmallow head , stick around the side of the glass as it recede ... retention be mediocre .<ssssss>s : reminiscent of cherry liquor dark chocolate ; cherry blossom candy .<ssssss>nice smell brew , though the malt and such do not come through a great deal .<ssssss>t : manage to keep cherry from tasting like cough syrup tend to be a bit of a challenge .<ssssss>it be successful here ... unsweetened/baker 's chocolate , rich cherry flavour - but not assault .<ssssss>a roasted maltiness that be not really spot in the aroma .<ssssss>pretty nicely do .<ssssss>m : creamy , almost a little slick .<ssssss>carbonation be spot on for such a style , just add enough to give some life without be skimpy or sharp .<ssssss>d : a pretty nicely do brew ... a good weekend treat , a suitable dessert beer , or even for no special occasion .<ssssss>worth a try .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 8		easily one of the darkest beer i have ever see , dark horse 's cream stout pour a opaque stream of oily black into the glass , steadily raise a frothy dark brown head that drop shortly to a wide collar and whispy surface cover .<ssssss>its intensity of color , however , be not carry over into the flavor and aroma .<ssssss>the nose be , in fact , more fruity -lrb- with a berry-like yeastiness -rrb- than it be roasty .<ssssss>only as it warm do the coffee and dark chocolate character begin to rise .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be certainly full though , leave it somewhat viscous , supple , and creamy smooth across the palate with a mild , very-fine bubble natural carbonation from bottle conditioning .<ssssss>in the flavor it be mainly coffee-like , with mild hint of bittersweet chocolate , but no sweetish caramel or nuttiness .<ssssss>and the expect , harsh and bitter , super deep roastiness like a ashtray be entirely miss ... this be actually quite smooth and round !<ssssss>there be not a lot of complexity to it , but it be rich , and it linger in the aftertaste for minute after it be go .<ssssss>quite nice .<ssssss>a great cigar beer !<ssssss>
6 7 9 8 8		the beer pour out a medium brown with a thin tan head .<ssssss>not much retention on this puppy and no lacing either .<ssssss>the smell be good but a bit one-dimensional -lrb- of course , that be par for the course with smoked porter ... -rrb- a real nice hickory or oak smoke be about all you get - perhaps a wee bit of malt but there be no balance .<ssssss>fortunately the flavor be a lot more balanced - some light roasted grain to start off , a bit of treacle sweetness -lrb- just a bit -rrb- , the obligatory bbq smoke flavoring and even a little bit of hop at the end .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very good - it be a medium to light body brew with just enough carbonation and bittering to finish each sip very nicely .<ssssss>no residual sugar to make thing ` sticky ' so it be actually a pretty clean porter .<ssssss>all in all drinkable .<ssssss>not quite the best porter for a base but quite good and the smoke be not overdo .<ssssss>the light mouthfeel really save the day here - this could have be a cloying disaster but instead it be actually interesting and refreshing .<ssssss>
9 6 7 8 8		choose the right glass before pour this beauty .<ssssss>my first experience with nostradamus come after drop $ 15 for a 4-pack over the weekend .<ssssss>i make the bottle last and used two different style of glass to make it worth my money .<ssssss>the back label have a best before date of 3-06-09 and a end date of 12 - which i will interpret as 2012 .<ssssss>wish i have save at least one bottle for sometime down the road .<ssssss>drink from a snifter glass , the pour produce a great look body that bounce between brown and a very dark red .<ssssss>the subtle carbonation produce a aroma that hint at a combined touch of ripe fruitiness and spiciness .<ssssss>there be a near caramel scent to it in the beginning as well as a strong hint of alcohol throughout .<ssssss>and the taste back it up .<ssssss>with a 9.5 % alcohol volume , it be the stiffest of the eight selection offer by the brasserie caracole brewery in belgium , accord to ba .<ssssss>its also by far the most popular style from this brewer among ba reviewer .<ssssss>i actually prefer it from a wide-topped pint glass myself .<ssssss>it seem to settle into more of a enjoyable beer that keep the ingredient intact , rather than a beer that could be more appreciate by wine drinker as it settle into the bottom of the snifter near its end .<ssssss>recommend serve temperature read 55 degree on the label .<ssssss>but again , i enjoy it best when it come fresh from the fridge as appose to allow it to warm up too rapidly in the heat down here .<ssssss>besides , i like my wine a tad chill as well .<ssssss>the initial sip flood the palate with a fine balance of malt and spice , finish with a dry smoothness that leave behind a nice aftertaste overall .<ssssss>not sure id spend the money again for this one , even though it be good .<ssssss>but if brown ale be what you enjoy the most then this be a beer that need to be taste .<ssssss>
6 4 8 7 8		movin ' right along ... let 's hope this one 's better than the irish i try a few week ago ... pour a slightly hazy amber , no discernable head and some slowly rise carbonation .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>aroma be weird and carry some hop , but also caramel and vanilla .<ssssss>very faint , unfortunately ... flavor have actually get some heft at the start , carry some of the caramel and vanilla note with it , plus some strong hop bitterness that carry through the finish .<ssssss>this be originally the petaluma strong ale , but in the bottle they seem to be call it the psa extra ipa ... and it do not strike I much as a ipa .<ssssss>as a strong ale , it be decent for the style .<ssssss>really , this be more esb-ish than anything .<ssssss>flavor be not too robust and the whole be well balanced , but underwhelming overall .<ssssss>not too expensive , so this be worth a try if you see it .<ssssss>
8 5 4 6 5		well , it look good ... then it go downhill ... it pour a dark brown with a nice staying head and lacing .<ssssss>aroma be mild but have a burnt malt aroma ... notice i didnt say roasted , but burnt .<ssssss>taste be actually decent ... it didnt taste burnt .<ssssss>it be the usual coffee flavor taste a little salty for some reason , and have a crisp finish .<ssssss>nothing spectacular but not bad mouthfeel be bad .<ssssss>it be like water .<ssssss>drinkability , well , the taste be ok , and since it be as thin as they kolsh , one could drink it all day ... but would you want to ?<ssssss>

8 10 9 8 9		one finger head comprise of bubble so large you think you hear they pop , cream brown in color , below there be a slight brown touch to the basically black hued liquid .<ssssss>smell like a chocolate cake with chocolate icing while serve with hot chocolate , lot of , say , chocolate .<ssssss>toffee , ice cream scent follow that along with date , plum , cook oatmeal , overall more slow roasted than toasty or smoky .<ssssss>in the mouth it have a great deal of density yet still come across as medium-bodied , the carbonation vibrate through the liquid to prevent full congeal .<ssssss>the dark bittersweet chocolate here match more evenly by espresso bean , toffee and general maltiness .<ssssss>there be a nice mineral or spring water freshness below which evoke something like lemon peel or forest pine .<ssssss>construct in a subtle style which mandate a good deal of concentration to catch the nuance , nothing obvious here .<ssssss>ok , maybe the chocolate .<ssssss>very clean finish , reset the palate for the next sip .<ssssss>

6 7 6 5 7		a copper colour beer which have very little head .<ssssss>there be a sweet raisiny nose with a citric tang which remind I of red grape juice .<ssssss>my initial impression of the taste be that there be not much of anything go on here .<ssssss>in fact there seem to be a rather understate biscuity maltiness follow by a low intensity but persistent herbal hoppiness .<ssssss>it be much less sweet than the nose suggest .<ssssss>this be perfectly passable and would make a reasonable session beer , but there be no great attraction for I .<ssssss>it be the weakest of the six offering i have sample from this brewer .<ssssss>
6 7 5 8 7		purchase from dundee variety pack .<ssssss>pour from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass .<ssssss>appearance : nice golden/amber color , do not look like alot of bock 's i have try , look almost too light in the color .<ssssss>minimal size head with decent lacing .<ssssss>smell : hint of caramel malt , toffee , some honey and some traditional spice .<ssssss>the smell be defintley more on track of a bock beer then the appearance .<ssssss>taste : nice roasted sensation , with a malty character feature some caramel , biscuit , and some spiciness and a touch of orange peel .<ssssss>the finish be not overpower like some other bock i have try , but almost a bit too light with the ingredient they include here .<ssssss>mouthfeel : a very light yet malty brew , it be hide pretty nicely by the appearance , yet this be a tad bit wet to be a good bock .<ssssss>decent carbonation , but if the thickness of this beer be on level with the carbonation , it would be even better .<ssssss>drinkability : i though this be a tasty beer that have it be good quality and some not so good quality .<ssssss>the color of this one throw I off , almost look like a light beer .<ssssss>and the thickness for such a malty brew be too wet , besides that , this be a pretty robust bock that i would not mind have again .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 9		as a self-professed coast homer and devout fan of the jack daniel version i be very , very excite to try this .<ssssss>a : look like like a imperial stout pour into a glass .<ssssss>whiter head than most , but still tan .<ssssss>s : divine .<ssssss>very little as far as bourbon go , but a tremendous chocolate blast .<ssssss>really wonderful .<ssssss>t : good .<ssssss>but very little barrel taste , and just a bit of bourbon .<ssssss>i expect more as it be in the barrel much longer .<ssssss>still nothing like kb or bourbon county .<ssssss>this do have a nice subtlety but it do not seem to come together that well .<ssssss>maybe it need time .<ssssss>m : feel like beer in you mouth .<ssssss>d : very , very high .<ssssss>like all version of blackbeerd : low sweetness and nice roastiness mean very easy drinking .<ssssss>overall a slight disappointment , but still very good .<ssssss>interested to see what happen over time .<ssssss>

8 7 7 4 5		thanks dnarx ... .<ssssss>pour into a snifter .<ssssss>appearance-dark ruby red with a 1/4 finger light brownish head .<ssssss>barely any carbonation , no lacing , no retention .<ssssss>kind of what i be expect .<ssssss>smells-big cherry , i be also get something i have never get before , almost like strawberry .<ssssss>extremely sweet aroma .<ssssss>some light rum like booze in there too .<ssssss>taste-i can not really wrap my head around this beer .<ssssss>it be not horrible , but i feel like it be kind of all over the place .<ssssss>after 8 month it be still pretty boozy .<ssssss>it be get dark fruit , along with some caramel and bready note .<ssssss>the finish be pretty unpleasant .<ssssss>just leave a awkward taste in my mouth .<ssssss>i realy just get alot of booze , and all the other taste be kind of a afterthought .<ssssss>mouthfeel-sugary .<ssssss>moderate carbonation , medium body .<ssssss>drinkable , but just ehh .<ssssss>.<ssssss>overall-i use to bash st. arnold , but they be start to grow on I .<ssssss>dr11 be a world class beer and i pray they keep produce it .<ssssss>dr10 , i can carelss if it stay or go .<ssssss>just unbalanced , do not work .<ssssss>
8 6 9 9 9		a. .<ssssss>very nice dark brown .<ssssss>somewhat look like a stout but without the strong head retention .<ssssss>s. .<ssssss>smell more or less like a brown ale to I .<ssssss>not bad at all , but not a extraordinary scent .<ssssss>t. .<ssssss>excellent taste .<ssssss>complex with strong roasted chocolate or coffee flavor ; lot of malt -lrb- yummy -rrb- which at time seem to outshine the hint of hop present in the background .<ssssss>m. .<ssssss>very good and easy to drink .<ssssss>a little lighter-bodied than i have hope for , but not so light it really impact the experience .<ssssss>a slight adjustment to make this a stronger medium-bodied beer and i would give it a perfect five in this category .<ssssss>o. .<ssssss>great beer and easy to drink for one that be 7 % + abv .<ssssss>i have three on tap and feel like i could have easily have another couple , though they be fill once i walk away from the bar .<ssssss>definitely something to experience and enjoy more than once .<ssssss>

8 8 9 6 8		i will skip my traditional review style on this one .<ssssss>this be one butterscotchy -lrb- diacetyl ? -rrb-<ssssss>ass pale ale , here .<ssssss>work for I , but while i usually love bitter beer , there be something about the butterscotchy malt character that really do not mend well with the hop biterness ... there be plently of butterscotchy malt , citrusy/piney hop , and bitter hop to go around , but it be not balance for my taste ... as oppose to the flavor mix and balance each other out , they clash in a odd way .<ssssss>the butterscotch could definitely come across to some as margarine , or melted butter ... as you can imagine , a odd combination with fresh citrus .<ssssss>-lrb- think , a piece of grapefruit dip in a bowl of melted butter -rrb- .<ssssss>9/2/08 ; wow .<ssssss>i just drink one can that taste like 20 penny have be marinate in it for a month -lrb- from begin to end , surprisingly -rrb- .<ssssss>this one taste like it have be dry hop with copper .<ssssss>i be drop the taste rating from 3.5 to a 3.0 .<ssssss>due to inconsistency -lrb- note ; the rest be not this metallic .<ssssss>have they be , the taste rating would fall in the 2.0 range . -rrb-<ssssss>if you get a bad can , try another one .<ssssss>overall , definitely a must try , and a high quality can beer .<ssssss>very unique apa , i could see this one be a favorite for some ba 's .<ssssss>

9 10 9 8 8		this review be from note i take from a fresh bottle back in august : well , after double daisy and she-wolf , half-acre 's win streak of summer ipa continue ... pour a beautiful deep gold with a thick , downy head .<ssssss>once you put you nose to the rim of you glass , it will not want to leave .<ssssss>there be more fruit in here than the bottom door of you fridge .<ssssss>while guava 's the only fruit that be actually in the beer , the smell add mango and pineapple you mental fruit salad .<ssssss>the hop provide a bit of lemon peel and pine in the background .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be right on target : it be downright sprightly , fuel by some vigorous carbonation .<ssssss>the taste start with some of half-acre 's signature flavor : lemongrass hop and light biscuit malt .<ssssss>than the beer show off its unique quality .<ssssss>strong guava flavor come in with a citric tang that build up a slight , pleasant sour quality over the course of you glass .<ssssss>the lemon and grassy flavor persist to keep the sourness from go beyond a complementary role .<ssssss>some might find that the fruit affect drinkability , but the flavor profile be one of-a kind .<ssssss>definitely worth seek out .<ssssss>
9 8 5 7 7		220z .<ssssss>no bottle or freshness date .<ssssss>.<ssssss>- pour a very pretty jet brown ... couple good finger of rich mocha color head which fizzle down nicely to a large ring of lace , and a steady island of thick foam .<ssssss>.<ssssss>bubble like a lot of barrel aged stout bubble .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but leave more behind .<ssssss>- actually a nice grassy pine hop flare to it .<ssssss>.<ssssss>sweet biscuity malt .<ssssss>.<ssssss>light chocolate , and light bitter coffee ... earthy approach .<ssssss>.<ssssss>- quite the coffee touch .<ssssss>.<ssssss>light note with a touch of sweet chocolate , grainy bready malt .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but not a heavy malt taste .<ssssss>all rather light .<ssssss>this do not taste like a 9 % alc .<ssssss>stout at all ... in fact , i do not think it even be .<ssssss>.<ssssss>maybe 7.5 % if lucky .<ssssss>taste like a good solid standard stout .<ssssss>- bit thin for a imperial stout .<ssssss>.<ssssss>not much on a heavy grain or body like i would expect .<ssssss>bit dry from the bitterness both from coffee and hop .<ssssss>leave behind a slightly chalky film .<ssssss>- overall it be a tasty stout , and drink quite easily .<ssssss>.<ssssss>but it be thin , and be lack some very important imperial stout quality .<ssssss>i be sure a pint from the pub would be better ... but if anything , it be just a regular everyday ` slightly ' stronger stout .<ssssss>certainly be not 9 % as state .<ssssss>perhaps a miss reading , or the yeast do not do much for it .<ssssss>.<ssssss>or it be too late to fix the labeling .<ssssss>

8 6 5 7 6		sadly , there be only wisp for a head .<ssssss>color be a deep-gold with ne-quality clarity .<ssssss>nose be sweetish , kind of lager-like .<ssssss>mouthfeel be thin-to-medium with a light astringency .<ssssss>crisp , indeed .<ssssss>i could not decide whether they be shoot for a lager or a ale .<ssssss>finish have a lager-like sweetness .<ssssss>not bad .<ssssss>
9 8 8 10 9		this be my latest staple beer .<ssssss>i try it on recommendation from a friend who move to ft. collin recently from the chicago area .<ssssss>as a former alpha king and gumballhead slave , i take he word that this one be definitely worth try , and now that i can not get either of the aforementioned beer in my area , i be incline to try it for my hop fix in place of my usual titan ipa -lrb- three floyd may be out of the question for I now , but since move to the omaha area , my selection of hoppy beer have definitely improve -rrb- .<ssssss>anyway ... i be very pleasantly surprise by this .<ssssss>every other odell beer i have have be simply good , but not outstanding , which be why i may have be a little apprehensive in pick this up .<ssssss>i be very glad i do , however .<ssssss>the beer pour to a light golden color with excellent clarity .<ssssss>it have a steady stream of carbonation that feed a very nice head , which stand at a healthy inch and maintain itself very well .<ssssss>the head never once fall to a thin film .<ssssss>lacing be quite good as well .<ssssss>the smell be very good , but not quite as potent as the flavor .<ssssss>the hop be not surprisingly the highlight of this ipa , provide a rich floral and citric bouquet .<ssssss>underlie the hop be a fairly clean pale malt profile .<ssssss>not much in the way of caramel malt or other specialty malt , but that be really not a big problem when i have a sickness and the only cure be more hop .<ssssss>the taste be where this beer really shine .<ssssss>if hop be a fruit , this be the juice you would be leave with if you run they through a food processor .<ssssss>taste like amarillo or simcoe .<ssssss>mostly citric and floral .<ssssss>just the right amount of bitterness and balancing malt character .<ssssss>not completely one dimensional , but by that same token , it be not lame either .<ssssss>the body be medium with a nice crackling carbonation to help bring out the bitterness .<ssssss>only a slight alcohol flavor prevent this from get a perfect 5 in the drinkability category .<ssssss>otherwise , well play , odell .<ssssss>i will be hear from you again shortly .<ssssss>

''<ssssss>it be not , however , the worst beer i have ever taste .<ssssss>
5 8 7 6 7		here a hazy , pale yellow-colored liquid .<ssssss>the head be unfortunately flat .<ssssss>minimal to non-existent lace .<ssssss>the aroma be a refreshing mix of pepper , lemon , sweet spice , bake bread , melon , and bananna .<ssssss>the taste have a lot of citrus and yeast , along with a little spice .<ssssss>its a moderately sweet , but very spritzy and carbonated beer .<ssssss>with a fairly medium body , this be actually a little more full than necessary for the style .<ssssss>the finish be a little tart and palate-cleansing .<ssssss>all in all , this isnt my choice for a winter beer , but its decent despite a few flaw .<ssssss>
6 3 2 3 5		it pour a orangey goldish color , smell like nothing , then taste pretty similar .<ssssss>call what i have a ipa seem a bit of a stretch .<ssssss>it be more like a ultra light beer with hop dip in for a few seconds .<ssssss>allegedly , mercury brewing respect the original recipe for this contract brew but give how lackluster this be next to the pub draft ... one have to wonder .<ssssss>
7 10 7 9 8		crystal clear and golden in color with a bronze accent ; top by a lightly foamy white head that leave some decent lace .<ssssss>the aroma be distinctly malty with soft caramel & toffee note alongside a light nuttiness with some distinct munich malt , back by a very slight floral & perfumy hoppiness .<ssssss>quite seductive !<ssssss>the body be medium-light and it have a moderate carbonation level .<ssssss>the flavor follow the aroma with a rich , floral , sweet , caramel , and toast malt back by a minimal hop bitterness .<ssssss>the balance teeter on the edge of fall towards sweetness ... but it never really fall .<ssssss>it be never cloying and it finish moderately quickly with a semi-dry character , leave some toasty sweetness .<ssssss>a exceptionally enjoyable and unique beer .<ssssss>well worth seek out .<ssssss>
7 6 8 9 9		serve on tap at a local bbq joint .<ssssss>pour a light golden amber color with a minimal amount of white foam .<ssssss>average retention , some lacing .<ssssss>very faint bready aroma , light malt , otherwise not much .<ssssss>clean .<ssssss>taste be clean , crisp , with a nice malt backbone .<ssssss>less complex than a typical belgian pale , but solid drinkability .<ssssss>drink like a lager , taste like a ale , all tell , very nice .<ssssss>
9 8 8 6 7		pour almost completely opaque deep brown with a small brown head .<ssssss>i smell coffee and molasses which be exactly like it look .<ssssss>the taste start smooth and then a bitterness creep up and linger into the aftertaste .<ssssss>there be a smooth creamy feel .<ssssss>for I this be a good once and do cold weather beer .<ssssss>
9 9 6 10 8		there be no see through this thing !<ssssss>amazing range of dark color flow through the head .<ssssss>thick lacing !<ssssss>very dramatic appearance .<ssssss>smell .<ssssss>.<ssssss>chocolate , sugar , caramelize sugar - almost like a smore .<ssssss>some vanilla bean in there , as well .<ssssss>very sweet on top of the tongue with lot of chocolate , but very bitter under the tongue .<ssssss>somewhat unpleasant down there , have the tendency to keep it on top of the tongue for the bottle .<ssssss>definitely a dessert beer .<ssssss>extremely flavorful but i could see how this could be a little too much at time .<ssssss>share a bottle , or have a full bottle if you be feel decadent .<ssssss>
8 7 6 10 8		i will start off by say that this be one of my favorite imperial stout now .<ssssss>i catch this one on-tap at milltown in chapel hill .<ssssss>i have hear good thing , but i be still surprise at how well the taste be balance with the high alcohol content so that it do not seem like you be drink a barleywine .<ssssss>the roasted flavor be definitely present with a mixture of floral and fruit note that really set off you nose and tastebud .<ssssss>
8 4 6 5 3		the only reason for this to be a limited brew be give how horrendous this be .<ssssss>best by 2028 .<ssssss>a very nice yellow-gold with a dense white head with great retention and lacing , this be a nice look gueuze .<ssssss>the nose , otoh , be rather awful .<ssssss>smell like corn , or to be more accurate , korn .<ssssss>vegetal , sweet and harsh with a solvent character , this be rather nasty .<ssssss>the palate be similar.sweet , sour and lemony with oxidize malt and for a first for I , at least from a gueuze , this be even a little flabby .<ssssss>some early review mention plenty of lactic character , that be not something i find in my bottle .<ssssss>sour and dry with a little sweetness on the finish , this be rather bad .<ssssss>so bad , in fact , that i think i be be generous with my grade .<ssssss>
7 4 7 8 6		pour on-tap into a pint glass .<ssssss>the wheat be a unfiltered , and have a nice bright yellow-ish color .<ssssss>there be only a very slight smell to the beer , one of light malt , which become surprising once the beer be taste .<ssssss>the beer have a heavy nutmeg and lemony flavor , which be sneaky after the lack of smell .<ssssss>the feel and finish of the beer be fairly typical of most wheat .<ssssss>easy enough to drink , but not overly memorable .<ssssss>
6 9 8 6 9		buy a 12 fl oz bottle of this from payless liquor in fischer , in for $ 2.29 .<ssssss>pour from the bottle with gumballhead hang out on the front and the usual awesome bottle cap into my gilligan 's pub pint glass .<ssssss>have no freshness date like usual .<ssssss>aroma - start with a light marijuana aroma with grassy and citrus hop .<ssssss>have a yeasty background with minimal clove but still noticeable .<ssssss>really bring you back to smell over and over .<ssssss>appearance - pour a 1.5 finger head that have weak retention and strange it be not bigger for this style .<ssssss>have a pale yellow , semi-hazy body .<ssssss>good lacing on the side .<ssssss>flavor - strong hop from the start , too much for this style but okay .<ssssss>very sweet and malty but do not have many of the attribute -lrb- rye , wheat , banana -rrb- that i have have in many other hefeweizen and american wheat .<ssssss>mouthfeel - medium body , medium carbonation , and leave ton of hop on the palate .<ssssss>overall impression - the hop be too overpowering for the style but i can not diss this beer because its still awesome !<ssssss>should be a american pale ale when it come down to it ... i would get this beer again if it be more available to I but not sure what style it be ... be not anywhere close to a american wheat .<ssssss>

8 9 9 7 9		i pour this imperial pint at room temperature , which might be the way to go , as i be please by the complexity of the bouquet .<ssssss>initially , i detect floral hoppy aroma , which gradually be replace by toasty malt aroma .<ssssss>none of these sensation be overwhelming , but i enjoy the subtlety .<ssssss>a slightly bitter aftertaste depart after two or three sip .<ssssss>as note by other , the color be a rich copper , and the head , initially about a quarter inch , dissipate fast .<ssssss>carbonation be light -lrb- not flat -rrb- , and it be smooth in the mouth .<ssssss>

6 6 8 6 10		i really think the bartendress bring I the wrong beer when i take a whiff and then a sip of this beer .<ssssss>it be not like a triple in any way , but i guess it be `` imperial , '' so you can do what you want with it .<ssssss>this beer be cerealy and sweet , which be a flavor i tend to avoid/dislike , but in this case it be carry off reasonably well .<ssssss>still , mixed feeling on this one and i would not call it a favorite of mine .<ssssss>it pour a muddy brown with a medium head .<ssssss>aroma be very malted-milk-ball-like , with a lot of grainy sweet cereal smell to it back with some fruitiness .<ssssss>taste be similar , with some additional complexity in the malt flavor become clear after a few sip and after it warm a bit .<ssssss>there be no spice flavor that i usually associate with triple , and the fruitiness that be present be pretty minimal and confine to the finish of this beer .<ssssss>the beer in no way taste alcohol-y , particularly for a beer with 10 % abv .<ssssss>mouthfeel be smooth and good .<ssssss>i be a bit conflict ; this beer be not true to style -lrb- as i understand the style -rrb- , exhibit a flavor that i usually dislike , but manage to pull it off in a way i thought be kind of pleasant .<ssssss>so i will recommend this beer .<ssssss>i have a bottle of this at the room in miami beach , fl .<ssssss>

9 10 9 8 9		the time have finally come : c. b. s. !<ssssss>thankfully , i be able to snag a bottle from village bottle shoppe # 2 lottery i be one of the four -lrb- out of thirty -rrb- who win the chance to buy it !<ssssss>honestly , im still just astonished i be able to get one .<ssssss>so thank you very much dave and everyone else from vb for make this epic tasting happen you guy rock !<ssssss>a : shine black , syrupy , and bold : one killer look .<ssssss>the head form slowly and deliberately , come to a full finger of dense , layered foam .<ssssss>look great at first glance , and the addition of moderate retention and abundant bubbly lacing make it that much better .<ssssss>a final interesting note be the color of the foam : dark , dark brown , so rich that it shine like lacquered wood .<ssssss>it certainly catch the eye .<ssssss>pay attention , stout-maker : this be presence .<ssssss>s : damn that awesome .<ssssss>spicy bourbon and rich dark chocolate be so big you can just about taste they : powerful , yet smooth .<ssssss>then , in come a jab of coffee , roasty and bitter , that saddle up with the peppery spice of cinnamon for a add kick of hotness .<ssssss>now , throughout the whole thing , there a sticky sweetness of real maple syrup -lrb- awesome -rrb- , but the true color only come out on the back end .<ssssss>mix with brown sugar , nutmeg , and oak from the barrel , the real canadian sweetness lay thick as this one final aroma .<ssssss>just fantastic .<ssssss>even after just a few whiff , im ready to dive right into this one its just that good .<ssssss>t : i didnt think id ever find another palate like dogfish head world wide stout , a beer that i absolutely love : that decadent alcoholic tinge , with just enough complexity in the sweetness to keep it from get too cloying .<ssssss>but now , after just a small sip , im happy to say that this have prove I wrong .<ssssss>the first hit be a huge bourbon smash , fiery yet smooth , that overpower the sens with wood , tobacco , vanilla , pepper , and smoke .<ssssss>its excellent .<ssssss>soon , though , it become apparent that the main focus of this beer be a syrupy , darkened sweetness .<ssssss>though i be expect it , i do not think i be totally prepare for such a bold statement : earthy-sweet malt grain , chocolate fondue , cinnamon-sugar , molasses , and even some fruity strawberry/banana-sweetness be all carry along by a a extreme maple richness that seem to last a lifetime .<ssssss>it be very good , but , like goose island bcb , the sweetness can hit the palate a bit too strongly at time , make it less and less drinkable .<ssssss>the aftertaste be nice , though : a milk chocolate meltdown , with big maple booze round it out .<ssssss>overall , this palate be smooth , unique , and complex -lrb- theres even a small but mighty hop taste in there , pop up with some pine bit on occasion -rrb- , but a little too sugary to be a absolute favorite .<ssssss>m : this be where so many stout king lose I , usually because of thinness .<ssssss>not this time , though : the body , perfectly smooth , slide around with a substantial viscous feel .<ssssss>the carbonation , smooth as silk , have just enough pop to keep it drinkably playful .<ssssss>still , it warm the ear , dry the tongue , and open the nose a bourbon fire , for sure .<ssssss>o : no doubt about it , this beer be superb ; the maple taste just add to the richness and complexity .<ssssss>im glad that i finally get to try it , so again , many thanks to village bottle shoppe .<ssssss>theres something special about a beer that this hyped , and luckily , it have the intensity to back it up .<ssssss>in all , it be one hell of a experience .<ssssss>you keep release beer like this , founder , and grand rapid will no doubt become my second home .<ssssss>

8 6 5 7 5		this creature come in a 22 oz bottle with a label that look like it have be place on by hand - hot of the ink-jet printer .<ssssss>no nonsense .<ssssss>pour , the beer be bafflingly hazy , dull golden with a almost pink grapefruit light to it .<ssssss>there be a nice enough foam that be not stay around .<ssssss>the aroma be not to abundant , but i have not let it warm to the full 55f the bottle recommend .<ssssss>which be probably for the better .<ssssss>i have no idea if there be any corn in this , but the aroma be somewhat reminiscent of silage .<ssssss>the taste start out quite pleasantly .<ssssss>it be a thick malty beer with just a hint of alcohol .<ssssss>but as it warm , the pleasantry end and the overwhelming sensation of bake soda and corn flower on my tooth start to count against the beer .<ssssss>the warming also bring a almost overly ripe raisin flavor that do not quite match the beer .<ssssss>i just hope my friend , which we last saw after drink a pint of this , make it home -lrb- he be on foot , do not worry -rrb- .<ssssss>
6 4 6 7 6		this be another beer that i find great to drink while watch football or any other sport event .<ssssss>it be cheap in price and good in taste .<ssssss>this beer be very drinkable and quite easy to drink more than intend as they start go down pretty smooth .<ssssss>
6 8 6 6 7		pour far too light for the style , a bright amber , with a decent head that fade rather quickly .<ssssss>smell be of some nice caramel malt with some nice hop aroma throw in to balance it out nicely .<ssssss>the taste on the other hand seem to be lack the well balanced quality of the aroma .<ssssss>lot of hop up front as be somewhat expect of a american brown .<ssssss>the malt then announce its presence , but no one seem to notice since it be so weak and slightly astringent .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be leave a bit unbalnced as well .<ssssss>there be a crisp hoppiness and some sticky maltiness , but the malty mouthfeel appear from nowhere and feel out of place .<ssssss>the unbalnced taste and mouthfeel of this beer definitely detract from its drinkability as well .<ssssss>just not a very good beer .<ssssss>
8 5 6 7 8		i like this beer .<ssssss>it have a very bubbly head which quickly level to a thin lace .<ssssss>the dark color be very appealing .<ssssss>it do not smell all that great , and do not taste much like a dark beer .<ssssss>it lack the thick flavor most darker beer have .<ssssss>nevertheless , its a tasty , easy to drink beer .<ssssss>
8 6 8 9 8		a -- deep orange color , with a impressive and long-lasting egg-white color head s -- not a whole lot go on in the nose -- some yeast and citrus t -- nice amount of yeast , orange peel , cinnamon ; excellent malt profile balance out a huge amount of hop .<ssssss>huge amount of flavor in this beer .<ssssss>m -- creamy and thick , very smooth , somewhat sticky d -- very easy to drink , and the taste be strong enough to be impressive down to the last sip .<ssssss>only thing hinder drinkability be the 7 % abv , which might keep this from be a highly sessionable beer .<ssssss>overall : very impressive !<ssssss>one of the best that i have have from the royal oak brewery .<ssssss>

6 5 7 8 7		i be pretty surprise by this brew , give that it do not have great review .<ssssss>it pour a traditional amber color with a moderate head .<ssssss>there be very little smell , and the bit i could tease out simply smell of a generic lager .<ssssss>the taste be robust : it seem to encompass the whole mouth with a malty-nut taste .<ssssss>the malt be light in body and well-developed in the beer , mean a large amount be use in the brew .<ssssss>there be a hop presence too , add a bit of citrus to the mouthfeel .<ssssss>very little bitterness though .<ssssss>i can not say much for how this stack up against other irish style , but it have definitely pique my interest .<ssssss>
5 7 9 8 8		a - pour from the glass with no head .<ssssss>just a collar and a little diffuse haze layer .<ssssss>no real lacing .<ssssss>the body be a turbid - heavily sediment orange-amber color , with little chunk of presumed yeast float in it .<ssssss>no visible carbonation .<ssssss>s - the aroma be definitely malt-forward ; comprise of pale and stewed malt .<ssssss>intense fruity ester on the nose that be simultaneously vinous , citrus and reminiscent of light fruit .<ssssss>definite booziness on the nose .<ssssss>like a glass of rum-soaked fruit .<ssssss>as the beer warm , some madiera note emerge as well .<ssssss>t - holy f**k !<ssssss>!<ssssss>this beer be huge !<ssssss>the pale and stewed malt be right up front , and so concentrate that it be border on cloying sweetness .<ssssss>the fruity ester in there be akin to light fruit - even banana , which i typically would not associate with scotch ale -lrb- i normally expect dark fruit -rrb- .<ssssss>the finish be a echo of fruity ester kiss with oak and booze .<ssssss>as the beer warm , some madiera note emerge as well .<ssssss>not to style , but still taste good .<ssssss>m - a thick chewy mess texture with yeast and unattenuated sugar .<ssssss>a delicate carbonation .<ssssss>some mild heat from the booze .<ssssss>superb mouthfeel .<ssssss>d - the alcohol be well hide ... but i could anticipate the fruity ester become overpowering past one bottle .<ssssss>
6 6 6 4 5		muddy orange in color , with a finger of puffy light tan head .<ssssss>lace slightly .<ssssss>slight malt , with a hint of lemon zest and yeast , and a bit more citrus .<ssssss>any malt or bitterness get lose in the muddle mash-up of citrus and yeastiness .<ssssss>crisp .<ssssss>nicely carbonate .<ssssss>light in body .<ssssss>not bad , but nothing fantastic about it .<ssssss>not real hard to drink , but it just do not do the style much justice .<ssssss>it be possible i could have a old bottle ... i guess i may have to go to zea 's and try it and hope it be always fresh there .<ssssss>
6 4 6 6 6		a - kind of look like a glass pg dark honey .<ssssss>tiny foam .<ssssss>s - extremely light honey and a tiny bit of kit .<ssssss>t - a light beer with a touch of honey .<ssssss>m - thin with a slight tingle in side of tongue and back of throat .<ssssss>d - nothing would prevent you from drink this , except hundred of other better option .<ssssss>
8 9 6 9 8		pour a deep , ominous brown with a nice thin dark tan head .<ssssss>head fall to a collar with a little lacing .<ssssss>smell quite coffee-ish with hint at amaretto and cocoa .<ssssss>very strong smell , and very please .<ssssss>taste very strongly of iced espresso .<ssssss>the taste be almost too much , not let the other flavor shine through .<ssssss>can not taste any of the alcohol though -lrb- evil -rrb- .<ssssss>a little bit of a hop aftertaste , but not enough to round the brew off .<ssssss>the taste be extremely please - but not complex enough for my preference .<ssssss>very strong , solid stout .<ssssss>feel very light in the mouth , not creamy enough .<ssssss>and , finally , quite drinkable .<ssssss>almost too drinkable be so high in alcohol , but no beer be `` too drinkable .

8 8 10 8 8		brown , rich look body , filter .<ssssss>easily manage 1.5 inch head .<ssssss>i could not find much of a balancer in this other than some earthy tone , mostly a toasty , doughy , dark candied fruit smell and taste .<ssssss>mouthfeel be absolutely stellar .<ssssss>creamy , mollass syrupy feel that wash completely away on the finish .<ssssss>perfect .<ssssss>another fine performance by anchor .<ssssss>could have have this again and again but i be at a beer bar and want to share the wealth .<ssssss>go well with a steak sandwich .<ssssss>sweetness in the nose , roasty-toasty , toffee-ish , very pleasant .<ssssss>malty attack on the tongue , and wonderfully mellow .<ssssss>a bit grainy and gritty , but still fruity and flush with flavor .<ssssss>rich , dark , tasty .<ssssss>chocolate malt ?<ssssss>very solid .<ssssss>warm and comforting in the mouth , easily drinkable , tenaciously tasty ... i like it , i like it ... good roast for a bock .<ssssss>i would like to have this again , and again ... very smooth , and luscious on the palate , a expertly brew bock .<ssssss>
8 8 4 6 4		pour with a brilliantly clear , reddish amber color and be top by a frothy , initially two finger thick , light tan color head .<ssssss>the aroma have a sharp , grassy herbal note that overlie a solid citrusy hop character .<ssssss>note of grapefruit , tangerine , lychee , bergamot and even some lemon note intermingle with herbaceous pine note and sharp hop aromatic .<ssssss>a lightly noticeable malt character support the hop aromatic and suggest at note of toast grain and caramel .<ssssss>the taste be quite sweet up front , with a large , almost exaggerated malt character that remind I of malt extract .<ssssss>still this beer be definitely hop dominate ; note of sweet citrus fruit and lighter herbal note be definitely here as be a fairly solid bitterness .<ssssss>the sweet , almost unfermented , malt character just seem to get in the way here .<ssssss>one might think that a abundance of malt character might help to balance the ample hop presence , but somehow that be not the case here .<ssssss>this beer be almost jarring with it be sweet malt note .<ssssss>i would not say there be any bad flavor component here , it be just that as a whole this beer do not work .<ssssss>certainly not as a ipa where the hop be suppose to shine and a certain amount of drinkability / quaffability -lrb- even in a scathingly hoppy version -rrb- must be present .<ssssss>unfortunately in the end i just cant shake the feeling that i be drinking unfermented wort .<ssssss>

7 5 5 7 6		pour clear bronze with a thin one finger head .<ssssss>excellent retention but weak lacing .<ssssss>aroma of toast pale malt and a hint of crystal malt .<ssssss>sour nitro tap taste upfront , toast pale malt sweetness and mild floral hop flavor .<ssssss>semi-dry aftertaste - very fruity and leave a buttery diacetyl coating on the tounge .<ssssss>the low carbonation and medium body accentuate the slick mouthfeel .<ssssss>low hop presence throw off the balance .<ssssss>slight dryness in the finish help drinkability but the diacetyl be the only notable character and it just seem kind of bland .<ssssss>

8 7 6 8 6		this be a hard beer to pin down .<ssssss>i be not a huge fan of belgian ale but then this be not really typical of belgian ale .<ssssss>it be way fruitier and more estery than i usually like but yet it somehow work , but just barely .<ssssss>it be a hazy yellow with the most monstrous head ever .<ssssss>huge and the word i usually use -- persistent -- do not begin to do it justice .<ssssss>i think if you leave it alone it would be perpetual ; the beer would evaporate eventually but the head would simply petrify and be discover by 23rd century archeologist .<ssssss>the aroma be yeasty and fruity with something else i can not describe in the background -- maybe rye bread or some spice .<ssssss>it be also very volatile for some reason ; even with the huge head , you get a lot of vapor .<ssssss>tthe taste be extremely tart , fruity and on the verge of be cloying but it somehow finish very clean with just a hint of the bitter hop .<ssssss>it be not like the trappist ale and lambic but there be noticeable alcohol warmth .<ssssss>again , when / i describe the beer , there be alot of individual characteristic that be not usually to my liking , but for some reason i do like this .<ssssss>the body be medium and it be to the dry side despite the sweetness , if that make sense .<ssssss>the mouth feel be bubble ; it have extremely intense carbonation -- maybe more than any beer i have ever have include american macro .<ssssss>it be almost overwhelming and if you drink too much it feel as though it might come out you nose before you can swallow .<ssssss>i would label this more interesting and unique than drinkable .<ssssss>it be good but i doubt i would ever be incline to drink more than half a 750 and even that be push it .<ssssss>

7 8 10 8 9		share a bottle , have a small pour .<ssssss>review from note .<ssssss>a - a clear golden yellow pour with minimal side lacing , which i suppose be to be expect with such a low abv .<ssssss>a - get some light wit note throughout -lrb- which make sense see how this be a wild witbier -rrb- .<ssssss>there be some nice sweet note and some really good light citrus aroma as well -lrb- mostly lemon -rrb- .<ssssss>t - some nice tartness with this .<ssssss>more of those lemon along with some orange as well .<ssssss>there that nice brett funky flavour too with more of those witbier flavor on the end .<ssssss>m - to be expect , this be super light and very crisp and dry .<ssssss>perfect carbonation and ridiculously easy to drink .<ssssss>o - super nice wild ale here .<ssssss>its a epic pain in the ass to get a bottle of , or atleast it appear to be .<ssssss>very glad i get to try this .<ssssss>only knock be the appearance , which i guess one could cut slack for due to the abv .<ssssss>a must try if one have the chance .<ssssss>
8 4 6 4 8		appearance : pour into a glass : a rich golden-brown with a nice thick foam head .<ssssss>look very appealing , especially when the light hit the glass just right .<ssssss>mild lacing .<ssssss>taste : a mild onset of flavor : a hint of malt and a small punch of hop .<ssssss>the first few sip with head be the most enjoyable , as you get a creamy splash combine with the hop flavor .<ssssss>i have have many pale ale , and this be among the weakest .<ssssss>i really like a very strong pale ale , and i be rather disappointed .<ssssss>mouthfeel : smooth but unassuming ... go down a little too easy .<ssssss>drinkability : this beer have a high drinkability because its flavor be not overpower .<ssssss>i find drink several while mix music be all too easy .<ssssss>this be a reasonably price beer find at kroger ... if you be look for a nonchalant pale ale to drink during a card game or a few burger than this be one to consider .<ssssss>
8 9 6 6 6		pour into a russian river tulip glass .<ssssss>i keep read about this idiot be `` close '' to pliny and the like so i give it a try .<ssssss>coronado have never be my favorite brewery , so i think i would try this dipa .<ssssss>first , off - it be nowhere near pte .<ssssss>color : a delightful orange with a nice , long lasting head .<ssssss>smell : a combination of hop , rise and pine .<ssssss>taste : some of the smell be in here , but there a unfortunate sweetness characteristic that do not do it for I .<ssssss>feel : typical dipa , but there be a add oiliness to it ; and a linger sweet that distract from the hop .<ssssss>drinkability : i polish off a 22oz of this but if i have a choice next time , i would grab a different beer .<ssssss>
8 8 9 7 7		pour into a tulip glass .<ssssss>a : the beer have a reddish copper tint to it .<ssssss>beer produce almost no head with thin lacing that last throughout the beer .<ssssss>a : pumpkin , cinnamon , allspice , and a slight amount of malt .<ssssss>m : thin to moderate with a creamy aspect to it .<ssssss>carbonation be there , but not overpower , just right .<ssssss>t : the allspice be very evident follow by the perfect amount of maltiness .<ssssss>just enough malt to tame the sweetness but not overpower .<ssssss>pumpkin on the finish .<ssssss>o : a very drinkable beer .<ssssss>i definitely enjoy this one .<ssssss>
8 6 10 10 10		drink straight out of the 12oz .<ssssss>bottle , with a wedge of lime .<ssssss>a : a nice light yellow , with a perfect amount of visible carbonation .<ssssss>all kid aside , all i can think about while work hard out in the sun , be the site of a ice-cold corona .<ssssss>s : average .<ssssss>one thing that have always amaze I about corona , be that even though it be ship across the world in a crystal-clear bottle , it do not get a overwhelming `` skunk '' taste .<ssssss>t : outstanding .<ssssss>`` one-of-a-kind '' , without a doubt .<ssssss>i always hear people joke about how corona be so bad , that even mexican will not drink it .<ssssss>the taste be so unique , and be a better thirst-quencher than a sport drink .<ssssss>m : smooth .<ssssss>this beer go down like water , even if you be not try to pound it down .<ssssss>d : this be a beer mean for a long day of drinking .<ssssss>i could drink this beer from sun-up to sun-down without a problem .<ssssss>a great party beer .<ssssss>
10 7 8 6 8		well its a beauty to look at that for sure .<ssssss>a dark ruby red with a shiney outer shell and rich deep dark core .<ssssss>meaty tan head be uniform and fade to a solid cover .<ssssss>ring lace .<ssssss>it have a nice mouthfeel and the drinkability be decent but where this beer fall short in my opinion be depth of flavor .<ssssss>there be a mild caramel malt bill and very little in the way of fruit or candy type flavor .<ssssss>it do draw enough bitterness off the toast bread edge to give it a nice kick .<ssssss>finish pretty clean compare to its fellow dopple .<ssssss>note : price per value its easy to beat .<ssssss>a decent bottle to swallow once a year but that about it .<ssssss>
8 5 8 8 7		this stuff be amazing .<ssssss>it be hard to believe this be beer !<ssssss>very creamy texture , with a very unique flavor unlike any other beer i have ever have .<ssssss>it have a long white creamy head , and it hang around for the entire life of the glass .<ssssss>this be something to try if you be into different kind of brew .<ssssss>for I , this be damn good stuff !<ssssss>awesome for winter time !<ssssss>
8 7 7 5 6		a fairly humdrum beer that do not require much attention .<ssssss>just you basic pale ale .<ssssss>if you examine closely the yeast be very distracting .<ssssss>i will not say its name because i be a much happier beer drinker before i be make aware of this particular strain of yeast .<ssssss>now when i drink certain beer that use it , all i can taste be the yeast : sour butter , overripe fruit .<ssssss>anyway back to rating .<ssssss>orange gold color with head that dwindle but leave great lace .<ssssss>aroma appealingly musty with some caramel sweetness .<ssssss>malt of the typical pale-ale variety , fairly innocuous and pleasing ; hop jump right in from the get-go with a tasty dryness , but get muffle towards the end .<ssssss>yeast take the rein to my chagrin .<ssssss>aftertaste pleasant and appetizing .<ssssss>mouthfeel good and thick if a fraction too fizzy .<ssssss>all in all a good beer , nothing special ; my preference veer away from this type of yeast -lrb- which i have have in other beer and not mind - here it be unfortunately a liability -rrb- .<ssssss>would be interesting if they get back to brewing in boston with they own yeast instead of be contract brew .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 9		pour dark black with a good amount of carbonation .<ssssss>this version taste slightly less roasty and smokey like the 12 year .<ssssss>but i pick up more malt scotch whiskey flavour in this one .<ssssss>insanely drinkable for the 8 % .<ssssss>the 12 and 16 year version be some of the best porter i have have .<ssssss>i hope i be lucky enough to try the other version .<ssssss>
8 4 7 5 6		serve in a pint glass .<ssssss>a : perfect amber color .<ssssss>2 finger head retention .<ssssss>head be creamy and unrelenting .<ssssss>s : like foam ?<ssssss>i really have a hard time smell anything through it .<ssssss>i even ask for a second opinion .<ssssss>nothing noticeable for I .<ssssss>t : faint cereal-like graininess , maybe some slight caramel .<ssssss>bitter finish .<ssssss>m : low to medium carbonation .<ssssss>very smooth and easy to drink due to the creaminess from the continous foam .<ssssss>o : not outstanding by any means , but a comfortable choice for a casual social drink , which be most likely exactly what it be intend for .<ssssss>
8 8 8 9 6		dank and dark with not much head from the pour .<ssssss>what head i do get be milk chocolate in color .<ssssss>body be jet black .<ssssss>sweet milk in the nose .<ssssss>a bit cold maybe too much to get deep into .<ssssss>but the smell be pretty forward with just the sweet milk and a bit of chocolate .<ssssss>very sweet rich and creamy in the taste .<ssssss>have a touch of dark fruit .<ssssss>taste be very good but i be just not sure it be right for I .<ssssss>probably take some get use to since it be my first milk stout .<ssssss>carbonation be a bit low but i be guess too much would be weird with this type of beer .<ssssss>all good but i can not see be able to drink much of this .<ssssss>i will have to revisit as my first beer of the night rather than after a hoppy ipa .<ssssss>but still very good and worth check out .<ssssss>
8 8 8 6 7		12 oz stubbie .<ssssss>pour a deep brown to black color with a finger of light tan hread , there be a few bubble cascade up the side of the glass that help maintain the head around a quarter inch tall .<ssssss>aroma be chocolate , oaky vanilla , a kiss of bourbon , and a moderate dark fruity sweetness .<ssssss>not too shabby .<ssssss>flavor be incredibly sweet and bourboney , with note of cocoa , and a incredible vanilla note that really dominate the brew .<ssssss>this one be definately a bourbon beer .<ssssss>its almost a little overwhelming , and defintaly dominate the porter aspect of the beer .<ssssss>mouthfeel be moderate to thick , with a light syrupy slickness .<ssssss>carbonation be light to moderate .<ssssss>overall , i think the bourbon aging really affect this one .<ssssss>its get a lot of vanilla .<ssssss>i like the cocoa note , but would like to see the vanilla and oak to be more subdue and play a support role .<ssssss>its okay , but i do not know if i would make this a regular in my fridge .<ssssss>
8 4 7 6 8		i pour a 12 oz bottle into my pint glass ... it be a amber , copper color with a thick off-white head .<ssssss>the smell consist of sweet caramel malt , there be a touch of sourness and a hint of toast bread .<ssssss>i taste biscuit , some butter , caramel malt , but it be not too sweet , it be light and bready .<ssssss>carbonation be prickly , and it have a smooth , mdium body .<ssssss>i would drink this again , it would be a good beer to order if you somewhere that do not have a good selection .<ssssss>
8 8 7 6 8		the ravnsborg rd be recommend to I by the bartender as be by far they most popular beer and i can see why .<ssssss>with it be smooth mouthfeel and mild flavor , it can easily turn into a session beer or a routine order .<ssssss>the beer have a nice hoppiness that taste and smell of cascade .<ssssss>sweet malt and a little nuttiness fight for dominance in my mouth with the caramel win in the aroma arena .<ssssss>i would definitely try a glass while you be there .<ssssss>
6 2 5 4 5		this beer have a lot of work to become a real ipa .<ssssss>initially , the aroma lack hop character and instead smell of malt - but not a quality aroma like one would find in a ipa .<ssssss>the initial taste hit you with the same off flavor hit you from the malt and yeast .<ssssss>the bitterness be there - but good hop aroma and flavor be not !<ssssss>overwhelmingly bad beer - i will actually not drink the other can of this stuff that i buy .<ssssss>
7 8 6 5 6		bourbon and alcohol in the smell .<ssssss>also over-the-top vanilla aroma and taste .<ssssss>significant white head on lagerish body .<ssssss>lagerish below medium body and sweet sugary finish .<ssssss>little carbonation .<ssssss>the kid like it .<ssssss>a bit much but interesting come from michelob .<ssssss>
8 8 6 9 9		just put one of these away and be clamor for another .<ssssss>the esb style be one that be rarely mistaken for anything else and one of the most common characteristic of a esb be a rich and bitter aftertaste and smell .<ssssss>sometimes i find myself get into the mouthfeel and flavor of a esb just to find and enjoy the subtle aftertaste craft .<ssssss>the anvil ale by alesmith do not register a lasting aftertaste .<ssssss>to my amazement this characteristic of the beer make it seductively more drinkable which be not what i would expect from a esb .<ssssss>the cloudy yeast give this a rich dark amber glow and a very nice mouthfeel .<ssssss>although i usually prefer a little bit more head and carbonation in my beer the esb style have often utilize low carbonation and head to maintain a silky mouth play .<ssssss>the anvil deliver this silkyness by a balance of low carbonation and head with little after taste to bring you a nice esb brew that keep ask for you to lift it to you mouth .<ssssss>its the cleanest tasting esb i have have and enjoy it alot .<ssssss>i have rate it average on mouthfeel since i can not really say it be above average in this department but that the average mouthfeel of a esb , as oppose to a heavier viscous version , be appropriate for the delivery of flavor here .<ssssss>thankfully i know a place where i can get a bunch of these guy and i can only hope to see it on tap anywhere i go .<ssssss>
6 4 3 5 2		a : it be one of those macro with enough color and just enough head retention to not raise you defens .<ssssss>s : light lager my left nut .<ssssss>this be a macro lager and i be thoroughly not impressed .<ssssss>t : first , take bud and subtract the carbonation .<ssssss>then , remove 20 % of the water .<ssssss>so it be basically a different take on bud .<ssssss>m : the mouthfeel be worse than bud .<ssssss>the lack of carbonation leave the shittiness bare for all to taste .<ssssss>it be all newspaper-y .<ssssss>d : unnecessary .<ssssss>pointless and bad -lrb- and stupid to boot -rrb- .<ssssss>
9 7 8 6 10		serve in 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle .<ssssss>beautiful golden appearance .<ssssss>so so clear .<ssssss>nice head retention .<ssssss>smell of strong hop hit you right away .<ssssss>taste be just way too overboard on the hop , in my opinion .<ssssss>this be nothing like the familiar european pilsener -- there be not any saaz spiciness .<ssssss>the hop that be there leave a dry , grassy , earthy flavor .<ssssss>i do not like it .<ssssss>this be a unique beer , though .<ssssss>it be worth a try , just not my bag .<ssssss>
7 3 5 5 5		22oz bomber direct from the brewery into a pint glass make a visit to the cooper cave brewery today and bring home 3 bomber -lrb- ipa , english pale ale , porter -rrb- .<ssssss>a - pour a cloudy amber color , not much head from pour but retain small ring .<ssssss>s - a musty odor , not sure what this be from , but also have this from they pumpkin ale back in the fall t - seem one dimensional .<ssssss>my limited experience with ipa 's seem to have a variety , this beer have a little bitterness , but not what i be use to with ipa 's .<ssssss>so maybe the english brewing be a bit different .<ssssss>do not get much malt flavor , no fruity character from the hop - a fairly bland beer m - average , a little slickness on the tongue d - the odor kind of put I off on this beer .<ssssss>this be the second beer i have have from the company and i be not sure why it have that musty smell .<ssssss>drinkability be ok , it be not a heavy beer .<ssssss>cooper cave have just open a bar next to the brewery .<ssssss>i be hope the other beer in my fridge change my opinion , as i would love to support the place , but they need to produce a better beer .<ssssss>davidson brother be only a few block away , and be far superior to anything i have have from cooper cave .<ssssss>
9 10 8 8 8		big old white and fluffy head .<ssssss>clear and bubbly yellow orange .<ssssss>nice clumpy lacing .<ssssss>spicey and sweet on the nose .<ssssss>orange and honey scent .<ssssss>a little clove , maybe coriander and a nice wheat smell too .<ssssss>taste be the same but with a linger bitterness .<ssssss>can not quite place it .<ssssss>not as good as the nose .<ssssss>nice boozey flavor also .<ssssss>very bubbley and sweet with a dry finish .<ssssss>medium body .<ssssss>a little filling and leave a bit of a coat on the palette .<ssssss>still good though .<ssssss>i like this .<ssssss>it be a good cross between a wit and a blonde .<ssssss>still like malheur 12 better .<ssssss>
8 10 7 10 9		i really enjoy this brew .<ssssss>i read the guideline on the side , about compare personal taste with the brewer style in mind .<ssssss>this beer be the perfect mix between the two .<ssssss>from what i can tell , the southern tier express themselves perfectly as well as match my own taste .<ssssss>so , the beer : a - clear , a little lighter than the color of a real pumpkin s - remind I of nothing but pumpkin pie .<ssssss>a dominant pumpkin smell be there , with just the right amount of sweetness and spiciness .<ssssss>t - just the same as the aroma .<ssssss>when i smell this beer i really hope the taste would match -lrb- which be not the case frequently -rrb- .<ssssss>there be a very strong pumpkng flavor with some sweetness and spiciness .<ssssss>m - a bit in the middle .<ssssss>i would have like it just a little heavier .<ssssss>d - i buy a 24oz bottle and i think i could drink three or four of they .<ssssss>
9 8 10 9 8		pour a very dark brown with ruby highlight .<ssssss>very large creamy tan head with nice lacing around the glass .<ssssss>have a strong milk chocolate and cocoa aroma with some light roasted malt .<ssssss>some light earthy hoppiness .<ssssss>very rich milk chocolate up front with a bittersweet dark chocolate finish .<ssssss>it be very sweet with only the slight hint of hop bitterness with some roasty flavor in the aftertaste .<ssssss>full body and very silky smooth as advertise .<ssssss>have light carbonation and be moderately dry and sticky .<ssssss>this be a very nice rich , flavorful stout .<ssssss>it have a amazing texture that i really look forward to in a oatmeal stout .<ssssss>
7 4 5 6 7		pour a cloudy copper hue .<ssssss>no head at all .<ssssss>i believe this could have look alot better , if it have be pour correctly .<ssssss>i have nothing to say about the odor , because i can not smell a damn thing .<ssssss>i guess the silver lining be that at least it doesnt smell bad .<ssssss>modest hop flavour in the taste ... some citrus back with alot of malt .<ssssss>not at all strong enough hop punch to be a ipa ... .<ssssss>weak even by typical pale ale standard imo , mouthfeel be crisp and bitter ... rather unimpressive all in all , yes this beer be drinkable ... would i get it again ?<ssssss>no .<ssssss>
9 8 6 8 8		a mild blond ale both in sweet and bitter .<ssssss>a tad fruit with a wonderful golden tarnish murk .<ssssss>a beautiful head that contract into a dense doughy mass .<ssssss>very soft nose of honey malt , grass , lemon , candy , and dough .<ssssss>the palate be just about that but not as robust as expect .<ssssss>not as much malt character .<ssssss>not as hop foward .<ssssss>a bit sweet .<ssssss>may be a poorly circulate bottle .<ssssss>nice spice with a dry coriander , clove finish .<ssssss>still have the finish of a blonde that sit around for too long .<ssssss>will have to try again .<ssssss>
8 4 6 6 4		pour into a standard pint glass .<ssssss>the appearance be easily the best part of the beer .<ssssss>crystal clear , without look too watery or yellow .<ssssss>have a nice goldish color to it that i find really entice .<ssssss>the smell be , hand down , the least entice aspect of the beer .<ssssss>little to no aroma to be find .<ssssss>consider how the beer advertise it be intense hop , you could not tell from the smell .<ssssss>make I think there be probably more early addition hop than late addition .<ssssss>taste follow through with what i expect .<ssssss>abrupt bitterness from the early hop , with no complexity due to the lack of late hop .<ssssss>a run of the mill ipa flavor at best .<ssssss>some spiciness from the rye , but nothing overly intriguing .<ssssss>mouthfeel be pretty average .<ssssss>feel like a standard 5 % abv pale ale .<ssssss>a touch on the watery side , but not overly so .<ssssss>i have no desire to go back for a second rye ipa .<ssssss>by the end of the brew , as it warm up , the early hop become very apparent .<ssssss>the finish of the beer be just bitterness with not much else to hold on to .<ssssss>overall a pretty average beer .<ssssss>i be no brewmaster , but if i have to take a crack at the issue here , it be that they decide to use low bitterness noble hop in a ipa , and boil they particularly long to get all the utilization they could , increase bitterness but kill complexity .<ssssss>i think this beer would be much better if they balance the hop throughout the process more .<ssssss>but , again this be purely base on what i be tasting , so who the hell know .<ssssss>
5 6 8 6 7		when pour , this beer 's appearance be that of a small size tan head with fine-large bubble that mostly dissipated.the body be clear and uncarbonated with a reddish-brown hue.the nose be lightly malty and sweet along with a light malt and sweet flavor.this beer be smooth on the palate and light bodied.it leave a fair amount of lacing on the side of my glass .<ssssss>

8 5 4 5 7		nose hard enough in cherry juice , low foam .<ssssss>it look like a bit of a cherry cola .<ssssss>fortunately , the mouth be not as laden with cherry as you might think .<ssssss>a bit of bitterness , acidity but a tad far from be truly compelling .<ssssss>we note , however , ester aftertaste abv and very discreet .<ssssss>the real problem with this beer be that its creator have lose between two conception .<ssssss>either take the side and make a fruity beer , certainly commercial , but fruity and sweet as desire .<ssssss>either take the side of strong beer and produce a beer , fruity indeed , but the structure as strong as its larger counterpart .<ssssss>what a pity .<ssssss>
6 5 8 7 9		not a bad brew , pair with sweet/sour chicken at the thai house .<ssssss>clear bright yellow with a minimal white head , some small lace .<ssssss>small malt aroma with a sweetish taste , some malt in the background .<ssssss>lite and fairly tasty , this make for a decent drinker have several with dinner , and they all taste the same .<ssssss>

6 9 7 6 7		this offering be a cloudy straw color with little head and no retention.there be a definite smell of clove upfront .<ssssss>this beer be very light and thin with flowery note .<ssssss>camomile be present for sure and there be cinnamon in the finish .<ssssss>this be interesting , but not worth the price from my perspective .<ssssss>
6 4 2 4 2		cloudy gold with a dot of lace and a rim of foam .<ssssss>spicy and light nose that seem more like a health and beauty aid than a beer .<ssssss>i sample some of this during a tasting i put on for my wife and my in-law and they be utterly umimpressed .<ssssss>i be leave want .<ssssss>at first it be novel and i even write `` curious . ''<ssssss>those drink with I say it taste like medicine and also , very specifically , gilchrist and soame soap .<ssssss>it just have a `` pure cleaner '' type of flavor in my opinion .<ssssss>the anise pop out at I with some ginger come through as well .<ssssss>the attack be actually mild compare to the smell .<ssssss>in the mouth it act like ben-gay .<ssssss>actually sucret be a accurate comparison as i have never eat ben-gay .<ssssss>it numb my mouth like sucret .<ssssss>i do feel as if i eat muscle rub however .<ssssss>the flavor and spice be fairly mild and would maybe garner a higher rating if not for a horrendhous mouthfeel and drinkability .<ssssss>its tought to be generous with the number for this .<ssssss>i be pretty excite about it and i be all about `` buy in '' to new style , old style , and innovative style .<ssssss>its probably go to hurt they business that i be able to buy a single of this .<ssssss>sell it by the case or at least six pack if you want to make money .<ssssss>i will not buy it again unless i have someone who can not resist look at the train wreck .<ssssss>i really be try to be productive here .<ssssss>the spice work together in place of `` normal '' ingredient be a nice try , but i really think they ought to try again .<ssssss>i have be hesitant to review thing i do not like on here in the past , but a b + rating on ba for this beer be call into question the integrity of the site in my opinion so i have `` sound off . ''<ssssss>people who use this site to find good beer as i do on occasion would be upset to go by this review in my opinion .<ssssss>some store even print `` ba shelf talker '' and i want to have my opinion average in here ... especially since i have three other beer lover who think i be be nice .<ssssss>
9 7 10 10 9		this be a interesting beer with a lot of complex flavour .<ssssss>very deep red brown , it have a big light tan head slowly shrink to a thin , permanent foamy head and leave some nice lace .<ssssss>the aroma be strong but not entirely to my liking .<ssssss>it have a strong sweet-sour fruit character with turn prune , pear , earth , and a hint of toast sweet brown bread .<ssssss>the taste be similar but much more to my liking and very complex with a lot go on .<ssssss>it have a rich sweet-sour fruit character with prune and baked apple that have turn , licorice , dry topastiness and leafiness in the finish , hint of wine , nut , and tamarind-heavy steak sauce , and slightly caramelly .<ssssss>it be mostly sweet-sour , a little tart , balanced with a little bitterness , and yet also dry .<ssssss>the character be rich , strongly flavour yet still restrained , very lively and complex , zesty , with a lot of different element blend well and make it hard really to pick out specific element .<ssssss>nothing i can say quite describe it .<ssssss>it become better with every sip .<ssssss>this be nice to finally have a new , fresh bottle as i have first try this about a year ago , but the bottle look a bit worn and be totally off .<ssssss>the character that i have now experience be evident , but it be very , very sour , yeasty , acrid , and totally off .<ssssss>

8 8 7 9 7		2006 and 2007 taste side by side .<ssssss>both pour a crisp dark orange with a thin head that diminish to a ring .<ssssss>aroma be more profound from the 07 glass , both have burnt caramel and subtle hop , but the 07 be more abundant .<ssssss>the 07 have a much more cloying sweetness that be tone down in the 06 .<ssssss>dry fruit , sweet apple and some caramel flavor dominate the taste in both .<ssssss>the beer be certainly heavy with lot of syrupy alcohol .<ssssss>while there be many better barley wine out there , this one do stand out with the 15 % abv and unique dfh touch to it , it be certainly a sipper , however .<ssssss>
6 7 7 4 4		pour from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass .<ssssss>06/29/08 .<ssssss>no freshness date on the bottle .<ssssss>pour a cloudy golden yellow color with about a half finger of off-white head .<ssssss>the head disappear quickly and leave no lacing .<ssssss>aroma be very citrusy -lrb- orange , tangerine -rrb- with some banana and yeast also , with a noticeable alcohol presence .<ssssss>taste follow the aroma .<ssssss>more banana and bready yeast though , with some pineapple and a bit of citrus -lrb- orange and tangerine -rrb- and some spice .<ssssss>very cloying sweetness to it , almost no bitterness at all .<ssssss>the alcohol be also present in the taste .<ssssss>feel be decent .<ssssss>full body with medium carbonation .<ssssss>fairly smooth .<ssssss>the drinkability be low for I though .<ssssss>the alcohol be very noticeable and the sweetness just kill it for I .<ssssss>i will not even be able to finish this bottle .<ssssss>i be really not impressed at all by this beer .<ssssss>there be so many better tripel out there .<ssssss>
7 8 8 10 9		pour a almost opague black some light area of ruby coloring.thick creamy caramel color heading.no lacing or leg at all and kind of flat look .<ssssss>smell be heavily in favor of roasted malt follow by bitter sweet chocolate .<ssssss>slightest of vanilla on the backend .<ssssss>taste of oakness hit you all at once at first .<ssssss>follow by a very smooth dark chocolatey maltiness.vanilla come toward the end to add some creaminess and sweetness .<ssssss>also there be a slight tasting of bitter hoppiness in the end .<ssssss>mouth be a little flat no real pop of retention .<ssssss>but it be ridiculously smooth and velvety in texture .<ssssss>make this a little too smooth for school .<ssssss>easily drinkable and for sure a new handy beverage to have around the house .<ssssss>
9 9 8 6 7		pour clear , deep amber to dark reddish-brown with light tan head that be rather thin but hold very well and leave some lacing .<ssssss>the nose be malty-sweet with prominent honeyish character and caramel , plummy , raisiny ester while aging have introduce some sherry/port note to the aroma with mineral - earthy hop undertone .<ssssss>surprisingly dry on the palate , the beer be well hop and not nearly as malty as suggest by the aroma .<ssssss>there be some raisin-like fruitiness but that be quickly overwhelm by minerally hop with somewhat harsh bitterness that increase towards the finish with linger woodsy aftertaste .<ssssss>medium body and somewhat airy seem lighter on the tongue than actually be .<ssssss>in short : a old ale with aroma that significantly differ from the flavor which be too dry and overly hop .<ssssss>-lrb- best before 04-05-2013 , 500 ml into tulip .<ssssss>
8 9 4 7 4		bottle cap come off with a huge release of air .<ssssss>pfffft .<ssssss>sound like it could be a little charge up .<ssssss>a gentle pour generate a very big and airy white snowcap of froth .<ssssss>it become rocky as it dissipate .<ssssss>pale white body show vigorous carbonation throughout .<ssssss>vibrant nose of orange peel , coriander , lemon zest and sweet malt .<ssssss>as expect , this beer be airy and gaseous .<ssssss>it be drinkable , but the body and carbonation be really lack .<ssssss>flavor be decent enough , but really bring down by the gaseous feel .<ssssss>flavor be lemony and spicy .<ssssss>really a letdown for such a `` high end '' beer .<ssssss>
7 9 8 7 8		presentation : skinny 330ml bottle .<ssssss>freshness notch on the bottle .<ssssss>best before february 2006 .<ssssss>appearance : slightly hazy golden orange .<ssssss>small white head but dissapate very quickly .<ssssss>smell : sweet malt smell .<ssssss>note of honey , cinnamon , and nutmeg .<ssssss>i have never have heather before , but it have this light flowery aroma .<ssssss>very pleasant .<ssssss>taste : thick sweet malt with honey and a floral and peculiar taste .<ssssss>it must be the heather .<ssssss>its finish dry with more heather , and a very light hop bitterness .<ssssss>note : first heather beer .<ssssss>very interesting taste that the heather impart , almost like a hop taste and aroma , but different .<ssssss>this beer be a little too sweet for my taste though .<ssssss>
6 6 6 4 5		appearance - very dark brown , almost black .<ssssss>thick light brown head that dissipate quickly .<ssssss>smell - roasted aroma dominate .<ssssss>just a whiff of hop in the background .<ssssss>taste - quite dark , approach a molasses flavor .<ssssss>finish with not indistinct sour hoppiness .<ssssss>flavor be not entirely pleasant to I - malt and hop do not quite work together .<ssssss>mouthfeel - medium .<ssssss>actually seem lighter in the mouth than one might expect look at the beer .<ssssss>do not appear highly carbonate .<ssssss>drinkability - the beer itself seem to be of high quality , but this be not my flavor .<ssssss>this beer get a little bump for be one of the first brand to turn I away from macro .<ssssss>

8 9 6 8 8		southern tier : iniquity 22oz pour into a snifter .<ssssss>dark brownish black ale .<ssssss>aroma of roasted malt , dark fruit , sugary booze and floral hop .<ssssss>in the taste , a even balance of roasted malt , barleywine like heat and fruityness , and a small piney resiny hop profile .<ssssss>full body , chewey , strong brew .<ssssss>southern tier once again brew a extreme beer to please and challenge the palate .<ssssss>solid .<ssssss>

7 10 9 9 9		this beer `` technically '' have not be release yet , but i have manage to get my hand on it twice so far .<ssssss>once from the tasting wall at the brewery , and once from a limited trial at terry 's a couple week ago .<ssssss>i know i have say buckwheat be my favorite by rjr , and since i have only tried son of a peach twice i be not go to refute that right now , but let 's just say i be eagerly anticipate the release of this one !<ssssss>it pour a cloudy peach color with very little head .<ssssss>aroma be dominate by peach which i think make it seem like you taste more peach than you actually do .<ssssss>not sure how or when they add peach during the process , but it be certainly a unique blend of aroma and taste .<ssssss>this one be not overly sweet at all , especially for a fruit beer .<ssssss>there be a little sweetness at the end , but certainly a beer you could continuously down .<ssssss>carbonation level leave this beer crisp and refreshing .<ssssss>i be sure there be some beer geek out there that will not give this one a fair shake , but i thoroughly enjoy it .<ssssss>nice job !<ssssss>!<ssssss>!<ssssss>

7 5 8 6 6		im not a huge fan of fruity beer , but im a big fan of dfh , so you can see my dilemma .<ssssss>the only way to resolve this impasse be by drink the darn beer .<ssssss>all right , the pink head have get to go !<ssssss>this be a comically red beer with a good deal of murkiness to it .<ssssss>the best vegetable beer ive have look this color , but it taste more like a lambic than a beer so i cant discount credit base on style .<ssssss>it also leave some pretty good lacing .<ssssss>smell like coffee and cough syrup .<ssssss>i suppose theres a little flemish sour smell there , but it be slight .<ssssss>i predominantly get the dirty smell of coffee .<ssssss>for the flavor , there be a brown ale / porter flavor that obstinately refuse to cooperate with a currant flavor .<ssssss>theres so much chaos , its hard to pin down flavor .<ssssss>well , if i really concentrate , i can see how they go together , but that definitely take this off the sippin beer list .<ssssss>these be not bad flavor , just awkwardly paired .<ssssss>to be more precise , the sourness of the porter-like quality do not agree with the sourness of the courant-like quality .<ssssss>fortunately , it finish well with a smooth lambic like fruity sourness .<ssssss>the mouth feel be very nice .<ssssss>its slightly creamy with sharp little bubble .<ssssss>over all it taste pretty good actually , but this beer be a little too complicate for its own good .<ssssss>

7 6 7 8 5		chill 10 fl .<ssssss>oz bottle with a funky blue enamel coating .<ssssss>no indication of bottle date etc .<ssssss>pour in to a half liter stein .<ssssss>pour a deep dark espresso coffee color with only a very slight cola hue when hold to the light .<ssssss>the activity of the beer whilst pour be also note worthy .<ssssss>during the pour the beer be behave almost as if its flat however once its let to sit the brew generate a relatively huge mass of foamy tan head .<ssssss>mine measure just on 3 finger .<ssssss>the head fade away to a lumpy and rocky thick surface coating with plenty of sticky lace leave behind to confirm the story .<ssssss>the aroma swoon with roasted malt .<ssssss>definite chocolate note and mild hint of coffee .<ssssss>taste focus initially on a sweet and syrupy coffee flavor .<ssssss>the mocha feature be definitely there and once again that taste of natural and unprocessed dark chocolate balance the palate out nicely .<ssssss>i should also note that the mocha and choc flavor in particular have a almost burnt quality to they .<ssssss>medium body with a very smooth , earthy and almost grainy mouthfeel .<ssssss>low carbonation , even though it can generate a very thick and full mass of head .<ssssss>rich texture and well balanced flavor .<ssssss>once again , as i usually add when discuss stout , porter , belgian quad etc , this be great for those that appreciate the style .<ssssss>if you have not have something like this before you be either go to love it and begin a new fascination in rich flavored porter or you be go to hate this and spit it out .<ssssss>for I though , this be a very good offering although not exactly top shelf .<ssssss>

4 7 5 4 3		this be my first experience with indigo imp , taste during cleveland beer week .<ssssss>this be market as a sour version of they gatekeeper porter .<ssssss>after tasting -lrb- and read some of the review of the normal gatekeeper -rrb- i have conclude that this may well just be a infected beer that the brewery be try to still sell .<ssssss>if that be true , not sure if i should give the brewery prop - for have the ball to sell it knowingly , as well as the wherewithal to rebrand the beer .<ssssss>at least they do not just sell it as a regular porter and have you find out the hard way .<ssssss>either way , my review ... pour a thick black .<ssssss>no head at all , actually it look flat .<ssssss>smell interesting enough .<ssssss>at this point i be still in full belief that they intentionally brew a sour porter .<ssssss>coffee and dark malt greet the nose , and then be push aside by tart cherry and sweet candied fruit note .<ssssss>my friend think it smell like a cherry cough drop -lrb- i be assume one of the sweet luden 's one -rrb- .<ssssss>the flavor really remind I of the last infected stout that i tasted .<ssssss>certainly the base flavor be in there somewhere .<ssssss>malt , roasted barley , etc. .<ssssss>but all you really notice be the sour character .<ssssss>tart cherry and a bittersweet mouthwash flavor dominate .<ssssss>thin body on the palate and really feel pretty flat for the most part .<ssssss>drinkable ?<ssssss>do not finish the beer .<ssssss>maybe it be what they tell I it be and i just do not like it , but i really think it be just a infection .<ssssss>sometimes a mistake can lead to a eureka moment .<ssssss>in this case though i hope it never happen again .<ssssss>

8 10 7 7 9		this be not a beer i would have enjoy or even try a few year back because of the obvious fruitiness smell that hit you in the face as soon as you get it .<ssssss>but now , for some reason , it interest I .<ssssss>the beer have a nice golden/almost red color with a decent head that do not seem to last too long - not much lace either .<ssssss>i find the beer very drinkable , especially with that smell close behind .<ssssss>the taste do not last long , and at the end it almost hint at be watery - maybe its just I .<ssssss>but i notice it in the bottle as well .<ssssss>overall a fun beer .<ssssss>

8 4 5 5 5		i have to start by say i have one of these a while back , and i be glad i buy two .<ssssss>the first be awful , it have be store hot or something at the store , it burn to smell , taste oily and very floral - and not good floral .<ssssss>this one , i think , taste as it be suppose to - which still be not great .<ssssss>pour a nice golden color , with a big fluffy head , that sit on top , leave nice bit of lacing .<ssssss>it be actually fairly clear for a wheat ale , but overall , it look pretty good - the appearacne be top for this .<ssssss>the smell be interesting .<ssssss>i can not actually tell how i feel about it .<ssssss>nothing remind I of a wheat ale -lrb- well , maybe it be like some of the less than exit and interesting wheat ale a lot of american brewery make , mix up with a kind of american pale ale smell -rrb- .<ssssss>then there be this really strange smell , that just seem a bit off .<ssssss>not grainy , not hoppy , it actually smell like , well i can not place it yet .<ssssss>maybe i will figure it out - something remind I of smell cold milk - mix with grass clipping .<ssssss>maybe that be what it be .<ssssss>the taste be alright , i can kind of stomach it , and the second one be quite a bit better .<ssssss>i can actually kind of taste a little bit of the wheat in it .<ssssss>if this be suppose to be like gumballhead - which of course be the first thing i thought of when i read ` amarillo wheat ' , it really kind of miss .<ssssss>there be no yeast character , no spice , just some pale wheat sweetness , mix in with some grassy hop .<ssssss>i enjoy it , but it be not impressive .<ssssss>and there be still this unknown flavor lurk in the background .<ssssss>the body be alright , fairly thin .<ssssss>the carbonation be a little sharper than i would like - make that a lot sharper , but it keep it nice and light and crisp .<ssssss>i be surprised to see that it be 7.7 % , and at this point , i can not tell if i be let my first opinion control the rating , or if i be like this more because the first be so bad .<ssssss>anyway , it be a decent beer , but one that i would not buy again .<ssssss>do not really set itself apart in any way , and i can say that one of the bottle i get be significantly worse than the other .<ssssss>
5 7 4 4 2		12 oz bottle , 2004 vintage .<ssssss>get this in a lif a long time ago and do not recall who i get it from .<ssssss>but thanks !<ssssss>pour a clear dark reddish orange , neat colour , absolutely no head and no lacing , look dead flat .<ssssss>not much else to say about it .<ssssss>smell be neat , very sweet and malty , a ton of fruit character , alcohol , raisin and fig , caramel , some brown sugar , some wood , lightly nutty , some whiskey note , pretty neat .<ssssss>taste be not so good , very harsh and boozy , this kind of taste like nutty vodka , some brown sugar and caramel sweetness , raisin , honey date , fig , more alcohol , not much flavour besides alcohol .<ssssss>mouthfeel be full body , syrupy , with almost no carbonation .<ssssss>wow , this taste like nutty vodka , all booze and burn like a shot of liquor go down .<ssssss>
7 4 5 6 7		a : a light golden-amber appearance with a initially respectable white head that fall quickly to a thin layer of bubble and leave almost no lacing .<ssssss>respectable appearance for a amber lager .<ssssss>s : this be pretty bad .<ssssss>i be not expect much from yuengling , but certainly more than this .<ssssss>it have a unpleasant pungent odor of grainy corn malt , some barely faint sweetness , and skunk .<ssssss>this be quite unpleasant , and i be reluctant to take a sip .<ssssss>t & m : it be quite thin , but actually not bad .<ssssss>there be no pungent bitterness or skunk to speak of in the taste here -- some interesting sweetness that try to be caramel-like -lrb- but do not quite get there -rrb- mixed in with some corn malt .<ssssss>the taste be not offensive , but be not good either .<ssssss>the body be light with lot of carbonation and almost no sustenance throughout -- a very watery feel .<ssssss>d : it be very easy to put down because the flavor be not offensive and the body be so light and watery .<ssssss>still , the smell be so off-putting that i find it quite difficult to actually take that first sip .<ssssss>once i do get that first gulp down , however , thing improve a little bit .<ssssss>yuengle lager would be a good choice for a inexpensive , sessionable beer for camping or a sport event .<ssssss>
6 5 7 8 9		i have have sam adam white ale a hundred time or more and never have review until today .<ssssss>i pour this one into a wheat glass and the head form nicely for a few minute then recede .<ssssss>the cloudy beer below look appetizing enough - time to get to it !<ssssss>the aroma be a little rough .<ssssss>lot of corriander , fennel , banana , white pepper , and vinegar .<ssssss>this beer might actually need a little lemon rind to make it work properly , though there be none in my glass .<ssssss>the taste be soft and honey like on the tongue .<ssssss>the vinegar and pepper be go but the corriander , fennel and banana be accentuate greatly .<ssssss>i also get a little honeydew melon and bubble gum flavor in the finish .<ssssss>this beer be soft in the mouth because of the intense carbonation .<ssssss>although the head do not stay there be a lot of seltzer to this beer - perhaps even too much for my taste .<ssssss>white ale be extremely drinkable and you will never have a problem down two or three in a single sit .<ssssss>i have do so on many occasion .<ssssss>i would say that i have have much better wheat but you could do much worse for you money .<ssssss>if you have never have it then it be worth a go .<ssssss>
9 8 8 10 9		what a great ipa this be .<ssssss>just go to show you that a ipa do not have to be overburdened with hop bitterness in the name of hop flavor .<ssssss>i wish some we brewer would catch on to this concept .<ssssss>this beer be wonderfully balanced and have a lot of hop flavor that still let the flavor of the malt come through .<ssssss>
8 5 8 3 8		look pale golden yellow and very hazy .<ssssss>smell like fruit juice with a spicey note .<ssssss>taste like pear ?<ssssss>maybe some peach ?<ssssss>juice and spicey .<ssssss>i really do not like it .<ssssss>feel really good on the tongue and throat though and go down super easy .<ssssss>i would and could drink this all night long if it be not for the fruit taste .<ssssss>
6 8 8 6 7		12 oz bottle .<ssssss>not much pop from the cap and the bottle be fill nearly to the top .<ssssss>clear , dark chestnut with a frothy tan head .<ssssss>there be a little bit of chunky lacing , but the head need a little help from the occasional swirl to keep from disappear .<ssssss>bready , spicy yeast aroma with light note of dark chocolate , plum and raisin .<ssssss>mild bitterness with most of the character come from the malt and yeast .<ssssss>not overly sweet though , with a little dry fruit and dark malt , some bread crust and peppery spice in the finish .<ssssss>maybe a bit of warmth as well .<ssssss>creamy texture , a bit slick , with a medium body and considerable carbonation .<ssssss>not nearly as disappointing as i would expect , base on what i would hear from other , but not that exciting either .<ssssss>everything just seem a little muted in the flavour .<ssssss>
9 10 7 7 8		pour a buoyant head , nice cloudy appearance -lrb- i do not shake the bottle -rrb- with tiny yeast floater dance around .<ssssss>the smell be the best part of this one .<ssssss>it be complex : citrus , pear , fresh-baked bread and some floral hop in the background .<ssssss>spicy too .<ssssss>awesome .<ssssss>the flavor be tart , sweet and tangy , which be fine but make a bit too dominant by the abundant carbonation .<ssssss>the bubble could be less intense , it kind of mask the flavor .<ssssss>mellow bitterness in the aftertaste .<ssssss>subtle yeasty funk -lrb- in a good way -rrb- .<ssssss>for the style , it be just too effervescent , dangerously close to be a beer soda than a beer -lrb- i have the same problem with unibroue 's ephemere -rrb- .<ssssss>mouthfeel : vibrant and tingly .<ssssss>you can guess why .<ssssss>despite the problem , it be highly drinkable if this style of beer be a favorite , but it be get nothing on the true belgian in this style .<ssssss>i prefer the top-notch maudite or trois pistole when it come to unibroue .<ssssss>
8 9 8 10 8		this hefeweizen have a amazing yeast strain in it !<ssssss>i could smell the clove and banana the second i take the cap off !<ssssss>the appearance be a hazy golden color with a white head .<ssssss>the aroma be amazing ; this truly be a well-made hefe .<ssssss>the taste be as bold as the smell .<ssssss>not overpower , but definitely a treat for the taste bud .<ssssss>the wheat leave a soft , pleasant aftertaste on the palate that fade nicely .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be very good with just the right amount of body for the style .<ssssss>this be a very drinkable beer and perfect on a warm summer day .<ssssss>pop a top and cheer to you sens !<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 9		a good look , copper clear pour with a familiar creamy , dense head i usually get from iipa .<ssssss>a bit sticky , would like to see it lace a bit more .<ssssss>no biggy .<ssssss>a citrus dominant aroma , but there be a good hint of light bread and some baked caramel .<ssssss>not sure on that .<ssssss>citrus seem more orange , some spruce appear in the middle .<ssssss>citrus up front in the taste .<ssssss>very small bit of bread and that caramel .<ssssss>perhaps it be more of a umami flavor .<ssssss>it be good , not sure where to put it .<ssssss>lack a good bite .<ssssss>it be dry and nibble , but i want a good bite in my iipa .<ssssss>not that this be bad , just a bit short .<ssssss>easy drinking , though .<ssssss>

9 9 7 6 7		nemesis 2010 have a dark brown body that be about the shade of cola .<ssssss>the tan head be small and tightly bubble ; it have great retention , and leave ring and sheet of lacing that cover a entire side of my glass .<ssssss>the aroma be excellent .<ssssss>it begin with a aggressive hop aroma comprise of grapefruit and pine , but it it also have layer of rich malt .<ssssss>a slight roasted character , chocolate , molasses , caramel , and maybe a hint of maple .<ssssss>dark fruit be also in there somewhere .<ssssss>alcohol be apparent in the nose , give a bit of a whiskey-type aroma to it .<ssssss>nemesis taste pretty good , but nowhere near as good as it smell .<ssssss>the aggressive hop from the aroma dominate the flavor , cover up a lot of the wonderfully nuanced background component that i pick up in the aroma .<ssssss>the hop begin with a ton of bitterness with grapefruit and pine .<ssssss>when the hop finally subside enough to taste anything else , i notice some chocolate , perhaps a hint of roast , and a pretty good dose of dark fruit .<ssssss>the alcohol show up in the flavor just as assertively as it do in the nose , but it once again taste more like whiskey than a fusel alcohol flavor , and it actually add to the beer instead of make it hot or difficult to drink .<ssssss>the body be a little bit lighter than i would expect for such a big beer , but overall the mouthfeel do not have any problem .<ssssss>this be easy to drink for a 12 % abv ; i do not think you would even have to sip it really , as it go down so easily .<ssssss>although the flavor leave a little bit to be desire , nemesis 2010 be pretty good , and i could see it become great with a little bit of age on it .<ssssss>

6 4 6 6 6		sapporo reserve be a maltier version of sapporo ; nice and light and crisp , but the extra malt add flavor .<ssssss>nice head from the pour , but not much smell at all .<ssssss>medium carbonation and average color .<ssssss>overall this just a average beer , but it taste better than a regular sapporo .<ssssss>it be the best option at a sushi place and i would drink it again .<ssssss>
7 9 7 7 5		appearance : thick head with long retention .<ssssss>the color be a yellowish orange with a deep orange heart smell : very strong hop aroma punch you in the fast .<ssssss>its satisfyingly violent enough to a hop-head , but there be a delicate mixture of malty-sweetness .<ssssss>taste : bittersweet .<ssssss>rich , fruity start with a somewhat weak and watery finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel : retreat quickly , yet there be a long-lasting and active bitterness on you tongue .<ssssss>this be a very particular taste , and its clear that this beer be design for people with a heavy inclination towards hop .<ssssss>drinkability : i would drink this beer at the very end of a tasting .<ssssss>it be aggressively hoppy to a point that would discourage many people , but it combine very nicely with a malty sweetness that be detect throughout .<ssssss>this beer will satisfy you hop craving while offer just enough complexity to make you think .<ssssss>it lack , however , the degree of sophistication find in a select few ipa that really make a impression .<ssssss>
9 9 9 7 4		a - look a gorgeous translucent brown-red as its pour into the glass .<ssssss>big foamy head and lacing that last .<ssssss>s - big , complex nose with hop dominate .<ssssss>t - flavor explosion .<ssssss>this guy earn he name .<ssssss>again , the taste be pretty complex , but piney hop and the sting from the alcohol be dominant and fight for my attention .<ssssss>as i swallow , the sweetness of the malt shine through , though it be still in the shadow of the huge hop .<ssssss>i would not call this a balanced beer .<ssssss>also , i taste carrot after i burped .<ssssss>not sure if that be relevant .<ssssss>m - pucker power .<ssssss>feel thinner than i expect from the appearance , but it be not watery .<ssssss>just enough carbonation for my taste .<ssssss>the alcohol and carbonation pair up to make for a exciting tingle factor .<ssssss>d - not exactly a session beer ... i would say it be a good beer to start off a night with , before switch to something a bit less arrogant .<ssssss>though depend on the next beer , you might mistake it for water after tasting this beast .<ssssss>
6 4 5 6 5		beck 's dark be a beer that have intrigue I for quite some time .<ssssss>i have be look and look at it in several beer store think that i should give it a try .<ssssss>well , today i finally do .<ssssss>unfortunately , i be not particularly impressed .<ssssss>beck 's dark pour deep brown and settle a very dark brown -lrb- nearly black -rrb- with a light-tan head .<ssssss>it start with a silky texture and heavy wheat flavor .<ssssss>then it build to a full-bodied combination of oats , cream , and spice .<ssssss>beck 's dark slip off the tongue and leave a very strong and rather unpleasant aftertaste that coat you tongue for at least a half-hour after the beer be go .<ssssss>overall , not a bad beer , but certainly not one of my favorite .<ssssss>

6 8 5 5 5		1pt .9 oz .<ssssss>bottle purchase at enoteca in post fall , idaho , for $ 8.99 a couple of month ago .<ssssss>`` batch 158 , '' accord to the label , which also state it be brew on `` 08.05.08 . ''<ssssss>and be best before `` 08.05.10 . ''<ssssss>whether the 8 means august 5th or may 8th , this be officially beyond the best by date .<ssssss>kinda wish i would notice it before now .<ssssss>incidentally , the label also state this be a `` dark porter . ''<ssssss>now i have friend in norway , and have tremendous respect for they nation 's ingenuity , but do this mean the norwegian have create a new variety of beer call a light porter ?<ssssss>pour a dark , dense color that could be either brown or black .<ssssss>hold it up to the light make no difference except for a almost imperceptible rubyish tinge to the extremity of the beer .<ssssss>1/3 of a inch of tan foam be initially at the top of this beer , but it soon recede to a foam ring .<ssssss>this beer smell of dark fruit , molasses and bourbon .<ssssss>the latter come as a surprise give that the label only claim a abv percentage of 6.5 .<ssssss>be this aged in whiskey cask ?<ssssss>there be certainly no mention of it on the label , and that be the kind of thing that be normally trumpet to the sky .<ssssss>very acidic tasting beer .<ssssss>the dark fruit and molasses scent do not translate very well to the taste .<ssssss>weird , and not pleasantly so .<ssssss>surprisingly watery body and dry , prickly mouthfeel for a porter , `` dark '' or otherwise .<ssssss>not too impressed with this .<ssssss>while it be entirely possible this beer suffer due to its age , the review of fresher bottle do not seem too great , either .<ssssss>i think i will pass this up in the future .<ssssss>

4 5 4 4 8		good ` ol rolling rock !<ssssss>!<ssssss>one of my favorite beer back in my macro drinking day !<ssssss>!<ssssss>in fact , it be my `` fallback '' beer if my favorite -lrb- molson golden -rrb- be not available .<ssssss>i catch a wave of nostalgia on a beer run a couple of night back .<ssssss>see the rock in the cooler and be transport back almost 20 year to the day when there be nothing better than go to speedie 's sport pub in university city -lrb- long since close -rrb- for a order of the best buffalo wing in philadelphia chase by 2 or 3 mug of roll rock on tap .<ssssss>but , that be then , this be now .<ssssss>so here go : appearance -- - well , even back then i know that this beer would never win any award for it be look .<ssssss>the `` extra pale '' on the label be neither deceive nor a exaggeration .<ssssss>lighter in color even than even bud or coor light .<ssssss>i have have ginger ale that be darker than this !<ssssss>very active carbonation , ton of tiny bubble .<ssssss>smell -- sweet malt , with a generous dose of corn throw in for good measure .<ssssss>hop ?<ssssss>what hop ?<ssssss>taste -- wow , either my palate have change , or the beer have change .<ssssss>but something 's change , & it be not for the better .<ssssss>weak , bland , watery , almost tasteless .<ssssss>do they change something when they move the brewery from latrobe ?<ssssss>maybe it be the water ?<ssssss>this be not the rock i use to love .<ssssss>mouthfeel -- - thin & watery .<ssssss>` nuff say !<ssssss>drinkability -- i give this a 4 because all other attribute aside , this be quite sessionable due to its light body and comparatively low -lrb- 4.6 % -rrb- alcohol content .<ssssss>unless , of course , you be look for a beer that taste like ... beer .<ssssss>overall , not a beer i can give a thumbs-up to .<ssssss>the rolling rock that i fondly remember from back in the day be now nothing but a watery , tasteless shell of its former self .<ssssss>sad .<ssssss>
8 8 10 9 8		generally have similar characteristic to the original aventinus but obviously a few of those be accentuate dramatically .<ssssss>quite interesting in appearance , it be not often that i see a weizen that be so dark and contain more than a shade of ruby .<ssssss>the aroma be not quite as appeal as the original aventinus .<ssssss>the strong malt well and truly overpower the standard weizen aroma .<ssssss>it smell a fair bit like a barleywine and i enjoy that .<ssssss>taste even more like a barleywine - a bombardment of the sweetest , heaviest malt and alcohol attack the tongue but it be completely enjoyable .<ssssss>the syrupy mouthfeel do not overbear leave a surprisingly easy drinker and one i would heartily recommend .<ssssss>
7 8 9 7 8		341 ml bottle from a sampler pack of 4 .<ssssss>i do not know anything about this brewery , but the description on the bottle have I eager to try this one .<ssssss>serve a bit warmer than fridge temperature -lrb- i let it sit for ~ 10-15 minute before pour -rrb- .<ssssss>pour a bright , clear copper-amber -lrb- or perhaps auburn ? -rrb-<ssssss>colour , top with a thin , foamy off-white head that fizzle out unfortunately quickly .<ssssss>its only remnant be a thin film on the surface , and a respectable creamy collar around the edge of the glass that leave smear of lacing .<ssssss>the aroma confirm that the label be not lie ; there be plenty of grapefruit citrus and pine sap on top of caramel malt and toffee .<ssssss>some floral note as well .<ssssss>a very hoppy , rather unbalanced example of the style , though as a ipa lover i be not about to complain .<ssssss>earthy , bitter grapefruit and resiny pine sap be present from the start of the sip and linger well into the aftertaste .<ssssss>the malt remind I more of roasted bread and nut rather than the toffee/caramel in the aroma .<ssssss>good body for a 5 % er , solid medium .<ssssss>mildly carbonated , and really easy to drink - this be one of the first time i have almost finish the beer before the review !<ssssss>not balance like i usually expect from a amber ... but very easy to like at the same time , and even if it be not a textbook example of the style it be a thoroughly enjoyable one either way .<ssssss>i could definitely see myself get this again if i be in the mood for a reasonably hoppy session ale .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 8		pour a brown color with a thick and creamy tan head that have tannasity .<ssssss>the aroma woft of fresh earthy and a little ctrus english hop ... maybe fuggle or east kent golding .<ssssss>a little roasted malt .<ssssss>the flavor be of nutty and roasty malt and earthy hop .<ssssss>a little watery .<ssssss>mouthfeel be pretty good , but watery .<ssssss>medium to light body .<ssssss>but creamy at the same time .<ssssss>a very decent brew though .<ssssss>very drinkable indeed .<ssssss>
4 8 7 9 7		let I start by say this be a very good beer .<ssssss>however , i do not know where the brown label be .<ssssss>it seem more a porter or stout .<ssssss>enough with semantics .<ssssss>the beer dark almost black with a frothy brown head .<ssssss>the smell be chalky dark chocolate - good .<ssssss>the taste be bitter chocolate with a hickory smokiness .<ssssss>good beer for a porter .<ssssss>it be just not a -lrb- sweet -rrb- brown which be what i want .<ssssss>pullman porter sound better anyway , right ?<ssssss>
7 5 7 4 4		i have such high hope , and they be dash upon the rock by this bruery beer .<ssssss>pop with gusto , pour a hazy yellow , pale and golden with a creamy head .<ssssss>smell earthy , citrus , and corny .<ssssss>taste be mostly grain and coriander , with a salty aftertaste .<ssssss>gose be a style i love .<ssssss>the herb , the salt , the sour , it mold into a great flavor that can be drunk all day .<ssssss>this brew , do none of that and just leave a sad taste of fail in my mouth .<ssssss>it be inoffensive , but that be about the best thing i can say .<ssssss>

8 8 9 7 7		2004 vintage .<ssssss>appearance : pour a hazy , medium brown body with , well , no head , but what do you expect with such a punchy abv .<ssssss>smell : full maltiness and a strong alcohol presence , it seem a bit like a brown sugar liqueur .<ssssss>even four year later , there be still a deep , resinous hop character smell of orangey citrus and pine with a slight grassiness .<ssssss>taste : dry , restrained maltiness with only a minor brown sugar and dark caramel flavor with far less sweetness than i be expect from the nose .<ssssss>still well-hopped for be near the half a decade mark , though it be also less than the nose lead I to believe .<ssssss>flavor of orange and tangerine with a twist of pine .<ssssss>some grassiness .<ssssss>warm alcohol presence throughout .<ssssss>bitterish finish with a long , linger aftertaste .<ssssss>mouthfeel : medium-full body .<ssssss>low carbonation .<ssssss>thick , creamy mouthfeel .<ssssss>drinkability : year later and the hop be still very much prevalent .<ssssss>i have hope for a deeper maltiness to have emerge , but i can be tough to satisfy in the malt department .<ssssss>
6 6 6 5 8		this ipa pour a light orange yellow with a bubbly , frothy white head that dissipate to a bubbly foam and leave a bit of patchy lacing on my glass .<ssssss>smell be predominantly malty with good hint of honey , brown sugar and bread .<ssssss>not a whole lot in the way of hop though with be disappointing for a west coast ipa .<ssssss>taste be , again , much more malty than hoppy with flavour of honey , caramel and bread and just a very slight hint of bitter hoppiness in the background .<ssssss>really , the hop do not add much to this beer in term of bittermess .<ssssss>in fact , they give more of a sour flavour to the brew .<ssssss>the finish be dry with bready and very slight hop note linger on .<ssssss>mouthfeel be light to medium body with a medium level of carbonation and a slightly oily finish .<ssssss>this beer 's 7.1 % abv be hide quite well despite its relatively weak flavour profile .<ssssss>this be likely its best quality as i could see myself polish off a couple of these without any problem at all .<ssssss>however , it just do not deliver the hoppy flavour that a good ipa should .<ssssss>thus , if i be in the mood for a ipa , i would not consider buy this beer again .<ssssss>this be more of a simple pale ale to I .<ssssss>

4 5 8 7 7		of the great divide beer i have taste , this be the first one i have not be really impressed with ; still , its not a total loss , and i would not dissuade someone from drink it .<ssssss>pour a typical head , not much retention .<ssssss>its not much to look at fairly light yellow/gold .<ssssss>this , combine with the smell , be where the beer lose the most point .<ssssss>when i smell it , i can not help think of the cheaper macro brew and be very much disappointed .<ssssss>you can get a slight hint of the different brewing that separate the beer from the micro , but its not real impressive .<ssssss>fortunately , the taste be a good bit better , a not overbearing crispness in taste regain some of the point lose .<ssssss>not a horrible brew , worth a try , but do not expect the quality great divide often bring .<ssssss>
7 4 4 2 3		i can get rogue in australia , but this one never really grip I enough to buy it for the exorbitant import price .<ssssss>but i be always curious so thought while in america , it be worth try it out .<ssssss>pour a very clear light golden colour , with a fine-bubbled head of white .<ssssss>lacing be extremely good , even if it stick in obviously large bubble around the glass .<ssssss>look decent enough .<ssssss>nose be really rather sweet , with a almost sickly malt grain cloyingness and a whiff of overripe apple .<ssssss>nothing much of anything else , except a linger butteriness that affix itself to the sweetness and make it seem worse .<ssssss>taste be weird , and confront .<ssssss>big welling of slightly corny sweetness , more of that faint apple aroma and a hint of something that could be spicy .<ssssss>oh , it be such a unpleasant flavour - something that just rankle I , rub I in completely the wrong way .<ssssss>maybe i just really despite soba , but in the beer , it be horrid .<ssssss>feel be light enough , but do not do anything to protect against the rank flavour on the palate .<ssssss>oh , horrible , horrible .<ssssss>i can see that this be a beer that be likely to polarise opinion , but it have I firmly on the side of despise it .<ssssss>the sweetness be cloying and unpleasant , almost like the juice from a garbage bin .<ssssss>maybe some people like this flavour .<ssssss>i think it be repugnant .<ssssss>i be so pleased i only spend the we price on this and not the au price .<ssssss>it do not work for I at all - indeed i find it truly offensive - be warn that there be the rank possibility that you will hate this .<ssssss>

''<ssssss>the saaz spiciness be lack in both aroma and flavor , so i guess they hop rate be still well below craft and homebrew .<ssssss>flavor be unremarkable .<ssssss>not much in the way of hop ; the malt be a bit carmelly and finish sweet .<ssssss>there be a bit of a bitter edge from early hop addition , but not enough to offset the sweetness to bring this beer into balance .<ssssss>

8 6 8 6 5		rather harsh , dishwatery brown ale .<ssssss>quite attractive in the glass with nice lacing and a dark amber color .<ssssss>not much aroma , slight nose of cereal .<ssssss>kind of a sourdough hint .<ssssss>nice enough mouthfeel , with good carbonation and a clean tang on the palate .<ssssss>but the flavor that take over be more like old fruit , citrus rind , tea leaf dregs .<ssssss>quite hoppy for the style but some malt to hold it down with a hint of sweetness .<ssssss>cleanly make , so it be a matter of taste whether you like this style .<ssssss>i just do not care for that aftertaste of dirty , earthy hop .<ssssss>
6 6 4 7 6		this be a respectable stout in most category accept mouthfeel .<ssssss>the thin light body leave I feel more like i be drink a porter than a stout .<ssssss>the color be dark with a ever so slight hint of red hiding in the darkness when view through the tumbler .<ssssss>the grain bill be tilted toward the dark roasted malt and be a slight surprise at first , but disappear by mid bottle .<ssssss>

8 6 9 8 9		pour a turgid , cola-brown in color with a dark tan head and minimal lacing .<ssssss>roasted malt , espresso , and a touch of yeast on the nose , with very minimal -lrb- `` no '' -rrb- hop presence .<ssssss>lactic tang on the first sip be prominent , and along with a initial plummy sweetness give I the impression that the brewer intend a nod in the direction of the sweet stout style .<ssssss>light-bodied and very easy drinking , with a creamy smooth mouthfeel .<ssssss>minimal alcohol presence - feel smaller than in 5 % .<ssssss>hop and malt bitterness evident in the aromatic quality mid-sip , along with a touch of granny smith .<ssssss>more roasted malt toward the end of the palate along with a dry finish .<ssssss>light and a touch thin for the style , lose arrow ride on its roasted and dark malt , creamy texture , and the part lactic/part nut brown tang , and mostly it ride quite well .<ssssss>my favorite of rush river year-round offering , even though it buck style a bit .<ssssss>on-tap at stub and herb 's .<ssssss>

8 6 5 7 7		this brew be on the mediocre side once it be past you eye .<ssssss>faint citrus hop aroma with bit of grain and fruit .<ssssss>thin body hold a minimal malt spine and finish like a green apple and hop tea .<ssssss>certainly not one of the best american wheat i have try , and consider the price , i will not be try again .<ssssss>

8 8 5 8 7		this pour medium amber with a two finger white head with pretty good retention leave some nice lace on the way down .<ssssss>on the nose there be some light floral note , maybe from the hop but perhaps with the yeast contribute a bit .<ssssss>this be probably the origin of sam adam house nose and taste , but it work fine here .<ssssss>there be a good deal of biscuity malt that form the basis of the beer .<ssssss>in the mouth the dry malt provide a bed for the floral aroma to sit on .<ssssss>there might be a little hint of citrus , but it be pretty far back .<ssssss>the only part of the finish that really linger for any real time be the floral note , a nice one to finish on , but it be too bubbly for my taste .<ssssss>overall , this be a nice beer that would be a little better for I if it be less bubbly .<ssssss>in that department it resemble a bud light or something that claim drinkability but ruin it with gas-inducing bubble .<ssssss>if that be cut down , you would have a very good beer in my mind .<ssssss>as be , it be merely good .<ssssss>
7 6 5 7 9		overall : a very nice beer , easy to drink if a bit on the sharp side specifics : appearance : pour a medium foam on top of a very nicec golden , redish ... even ... copper color .<ssssss>visually impressive smell : pretty average , some floral hop apparent , but really do not put up impressive aromatic taste : nice , good hop background with a strong hops/acid flavor that get you attention and make this beer interesting .<ssssss>mouthfeel : a little on the weak side as this bitter acid overpower the more mild hop so it come of as too sharp drinkability : all in all , quite drinkable .<ssssss>i like it , would try more from this brewery<ssssss>
8 9 8 7 9		this be one auspicious look beer .<ssssss>with a delicate poor , this nebulous orangish light brown color beer with a thin white head and mild carbonation be please to the sens .<ssssss>a congenial sweet smell of nector and a gratifying first sip , signify a sencond and third taste be undoubtfully near .<ssssss>drink up and enjoy , for there be five more tail within you reach ... ... ... ... .<ssssss>make that 4 .<ssssss>
7 10 8 9 8		pour cloudy amber/apricot orange under a small head that dissipate quickly .<ssssss>nose have a surprising sweetness with tropical fruit ester of subtle pineapple and mango : both be of the dry and sweeten kind of fruit rather than fresh .<ssssss>citrus , earthy , grassy hop balance with biscuit sweet and bitter malt .<ssssss>the taste be astoundingly rich and complex : start with a rush of sweet biscuit malt and quickly bitters and dry with astringency , and offer a long , warm bitter finish .<ssssss>the fruit ester be only hint on the tongue , and as it warm , more tea-like bitterness arrive on the mid-palate .<ssssss>tear at the back of the throat with wonderful bitterness .<ssssss>perhaps i be giddy to find a match for my palate tonight after two rare , unfortunate drain pour , but i be go to seek this one out again , and i hope to find it on tap somewhere soon .<ssssss>
10 7 6 8 4		sorry , water come from lake not from bottle .<ssssss>how come nobody can make a decent lager ?<ssssss>this beer start off look great but ultimately dissapoint .<ssssss>really , i know lager be much thinner than ale , but come on !<ssssss>also way too many bubble .<ssssss>i have more in this beer than i have new year eve in my champagne !<ssssss>the oldest brewery in america and they still can not learn .<ssssss>
7 8 5 5 6		appearance : pour into a pint glass : head be good solid and last a while .<ssssss>color be a very deep red , almost opaque .<ssssss>smell : some sweet smell .<ssssss>taste : start out with a great chocolate/carmel taste , lot and lot of flavor .<ssssss>as the glass wear on , the flavor leave behind just a strong malty flavor without anything interesting .<ssssss>overall : too bad the flavor do not last .<ssssss>a good beer overall , i would drink it again , but no go out of my way for it .<ssssss>

7 8 4 4 5		pour into a pint glass this brew be very dark brown with a milk chocolate color head .<ssssss>not much carbonation and the head dissipate leave little to no leg .<ssssss>this brew have a wonderful deep chocolate smell , with strong note of coffee and a sweet caramel touch .<ssssss>once i take a sip the first thing that come to mind be burnt peanut -lrb- you know when you be eat they from the shell and you get a bad one -rrb- .<ssssss>what a deceive nose .<ssssss>there be some aftertaste of coffee and some chocolate but it be drown out by the over whelming taste of something burnt .<ssssss>i really like a nice porter , but be very upset with the quality of this .<ssssss>good thing it be in a `` make you own '' six-pack so i only have one .<ssssss>
4 3 6 3 2		pour a pinkish colour , with brownish yellow tone .<ssssss>a weird combination .<ssssss>seem to be bottle condition , and this must be a old bottle , the yeast at the bottom be a very dark brown .<ssssss>almost no head .<ssssss>what there be be white , and not pink .<ssssss>smell - something in it that remind I of vomit , or bile .<ssssss>taste be likewise awful .<ssssss>other than the bile , it have a sour bite , hint of raspberry and finish with sweet malt .<ssssss>moderately high hop bitterness .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium light .<ssssss>relatively high carbonation well , if you do not mind the wretched smell and taste , this might be more drinkable .<ssssss>i think this one be go down the sink .<ssssss>
8 5 8 7 7		a - black ... not the darkest i have see , but it look like a decent stout nonetheless .<ssssss>nice pillowy off white head .<ssssss>s - smell kinda like a guinness foreign extra with generic chocolate add .<ssssss>mostly malt forward with a touch of chalky bitter hop that i do not care for at all .<ssssss>this be be consume well before the best by date , but something about the aroma just do not seem right to I , or i just do not like it .<ssssss>t - when i think of a `` double chocolate stout '' this be not what i expect .<ssssss>ok , so i guess i be really not a fan of european stout , and i have already try some american imperial stout like choklat and brooklyn black chocolate stout -lrb- which do not even add real chocolate to they beer , yet they achieve a better chocolate flavor compare to this beer -rrb- , but this beer just do not do a whole lot for I .<ssssss>it be nice .<ssssss>it be better than many i have have .<ssssss>it have a decent roasty character .<ssssss>it be full of flavor like a stout should be , but i come away fairly unimpressed .<ssssss>it be be over a year since i have have this beer , and it just be not as good as i recall .<ssssss>m - pretty full body , perfect carbonation .<ssssss>could be the nicest aspect of this beer .<ssssss>d - a pretty easy drink , but i expect that at it be abv .<ssssss>again , this be not quite as good as i expect it to be , but it be a relatively good beer and one i will enjoy again .<ssssss>i think i prefer it from the nitro can .<ssssss>
6 9 4 7 7		do not know what the hype be for this beer .<ssssss>yeah it be rare but it be not that great .<ssssss>pour into a snifter .<ssssss>pour super flat again like the cab cherry man .<ssssss>no head .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>super black .<ssssss>aroma be good .<ssssss>probably the best part .<ssssss>it be super bourbony .<ssssss>nice stouty ness .<ssssss>caramel and some slight dark fruit .<ssssss>taste be way too thin .<ssssss>and no carb .<ssssss>have a nice bourboness .<ssssss>little bit of roast in the finish .<ssssss>the flavor be really lack like some caramel and body you would expect from a stout of this style .<ssssss>mouthfeel be too thin and no carb .<ssssss>terrible mouthfeel for a stout .<ssssss>overall this beer be disappointing .<ssssss>and people be say the west coast hype up they beer .<ssssss>this one be not deserving of a a at all .<ssssss>there be alot more beer i would put up there .<ssssss>if they other beer be rate this high and taste like this i dont think i will be trading and give up awesome beer just because the bottle count be 300 .<ssssss>
8 9 7 10 8		for those familiar with the stone `` double bastard ale '' , this beer will be perfect for you .<ssssss>a : great appearance overall , cloudy , and barely transparent .<ssssss>mediocre head with moderate lacing .<ssssss>s : wow , i walk away from my beer to toss the bottle in the recycle across the kitchen and the smell quickly consume the kitchen and follow I .<ssssss>t : the taste be exceptional , no doubt about it .<ssssss>this be not a true barleywine , but it be most certainly a exeptional `` american strong ale '' as this be very similar to stone 's arrogant and double bastard ale .<ssssss>this beer be a flat-out terrific value .<ssssss>i believe i get it for under $ 2.00 for a single 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle .<ssssss>expect roasted malt of the highest quality .<ssssss>absolutely delicious .<ssssss>m : the mouthfeel could definitely stand to be improve .<ssssss>this beer do not sit well in the mouth because it be just not as smooth as it need to be to achieve perfection like stone 's double bastard have .<ssssss>the alcohol only exaggerate the slight sourness to the beer .<ssssss>it also have a slight astringency .<ssssss>i bet aging would improve this .<ssssss>d : this be still a very drinkable beer for be a 10 % er .<ssssss>sierra nevada really outdo themselves with this one .<ssssss>i be go back for more .<ssssss>
7 6 4 5 8		mgd 64 a 3.5-4 clear light gold .<ssssss>one-finger head of relatively large bubble , but the cap stick around for a bit before shrink to a disc .<ssssss>surprisingly , there be a little lace leave behind as well .<ssssss>s 3 faint cornyness , cracker , and a suggestion of hop t 2.5-3 lighty flavor -lrb- obviously -rrb- , fairly dry ; the crackery malt be there if you search for it .<ssssss>the finish be a little too club soda though there be a bit of twang .<ssssss>if they would just add a little more hop or something , this would almost be a respectable session -lrb- in the true sense -rrb- beer .<ssssss>m 2 light and fizzy , too fizzy .<ssssss>this be one of those relatively rare occassion where the texture tell a different story than the appearance .<ssssss>d 4 i really do not mind this stuff and think it have its place , like when you be outdoors or want another beer to cap thing off but want to overdo .<ssssss>
6 8 4 8 9		appearance be a average dark brown and a healthy , petite head .<ssssss>very clean .<ssssss>smell be predominately malty with exceptional hop presence for this style .<ssssss>taste remind I of what i -- as a pennsylvanian -- know as a black and tan -lsb- yuengling 's black and tan -rsb- .<ssssss>mouthfeel really disappointed I .<ssssss>there be a lack of carbonation while the brew go down .<ssssss>it tingle my tongue a little but be lackluster for the most part .<ssssss>drinkability be above-average for such a heavy beer .<ssssss>gim I another ...<ssssss>

9 8 6 8 8		black and licorice taste exceed smoke taste , and no smoke aroma .<ssssss>more roast than smoke , like a stout , thats good .<ssssss>much carbonation , however .<ssssss>new formulation ?<ssssss>some fruitiness and malt make it balanced .<ssssss>.<ssssss>surprisingly enjoyable directly form they at the 2004 st. lawrence fest .<ssssss>
7 10 8 9 10		get the last one of these from the batch we get into work .<ssssss>open it at the behest of d0b and my desire to toast arturo gatti 's passing .<ssssss>long live the champ !<ssssss>from a 375ml that be fill to about a inch from the cap .<ssssss>date `` brew in may 2008 . ''<ssssss>serve this too cold have to let it warm to just about room temperature before it start to sing .<ssssss>i be a tad worry about the condition of the bottle .<ssssss>i be sure this be mean to be a low carbonated beer but this have none .<ssssss>like it do not even hiss as i take of the cap .<ssssss>my review may be a tad suspect , but as a famous wine writer once write `` there be no great wine , just great bottle '' or something like that .<ssssss>this beer pour with a few white rimmed bubble and then quickly nothing , a swirl of the glass , nothing .<ssssss>a please hue of tan , chestnut maybe , with a sort of ruby tint .<ssssss>the nose be meadow-y , all grass and fresh bloom flower .<ssssss>very pasture like funk with the barn animal all home for good measure .<ssssss>as this warm it take on many more similarity to trousseau , with its winy red currant and cranberry fruit and more of the warm trodden soil .<ssssss>it also have a highlight of redwood in there somewhere and pretty dry rise note .<ssssss>very expressive stuff .<ssssss>i can not say i like this at first , but it be one that grow on you .<ssssss>the next thing you know you be look around for another 375ml to down .<ssssss>plus this be contemplative stuff .<ssssss>you have to pay attention to what be go on , this just do not just come out and rip off all its clothes and say look at I .<ssssss>you have to do some coaxing , whisper some sweet nothing .<ssssss>tobacco , whole clove , dry raspberry and a whole lot of funky lactic acid be easily apparent here .<ssssss>the beer be wildly complex and full of action , everything bounce around quickly but the flavor stay with you long after it be go .<ssssss>this have plenty of the sour , yet bitter quality similar to fresh cranberry .<ssssss>add the winy , earthy trousseau quality and it become something alive .<ssssss>i love the sour , fruity , tart mid-palate here and the bitter , earthy finish .<ssssss>the carbonation , or complete lack there of hurt this for I a bit .<ssssss>but i really like the high off-setting puckering acid as oppose to the muscular , sinewy frame .<ssssss>this make sense to I be that i love wine from the arbois and they sneaky power and teeter acid .<ssssss>but that may not make sense to anyone else .<ssssss>at first i be on the fence with this but you need to drink it to become sell on it .<ssssss>the more you drink the more it all come together and make sense .<ssssss>i could easily put back 2-3 of these just try to dissect they .<ssssss>the 11 % abv be hide well and i always feel that sour , at least for I , be sort of a restorative both to the palate and the brain .<ssssss>

6 6 6 4 5		this pour a clear golden straw colour with very little head .<ssssss>a tough of graininess on the node and a little fruitiness .<ssssss>a bit `` clean '' .<ssssss>very bland on the palate .<ssssss>very much a mass produce dumb down thing in the corona mould .<ssssss>i know why they put lime in theses thing .<ssssss>crisp mouth feel .<ssssss>take I to el salvador and i would probably drink this by the bucket load but not in melbourne town .<ssssss>

6 8 4 8 8		appearance : dark , rust copper .<ssssss>a cloudy , malt color beer .<ssssss>seem the same color as malt syrup .<ssssss>smell : tantalizingly sweet , heavy on the caramel .<ssssss>barely any hop discernable , but it do have a slight bitter smell on the end .<ssssss>taste : a pretty complex oktoberfest .<ssssss>the malt come through as the most prominent flavor .<ssssss>it be slightly fruity , but barely .<ssssss>the caramel color show up in flavor too , really a tastey beer .<ssssss>mouthfeel : soft , light feel .<ssssss>feel a lot like a bitter .<ssssss>less carbonated , a little thicker .<ssssss>overall : it be a good beer .<ssssss>some oktoberfest be too light .<ssssss>this one hit the caramelly malt note well .<ssssss>wish it be not a twist off so i could reuse the 16 oz .<ssssss>bottle .<ssssss>would probably help seal the beer in better for storage too .<ssssss>really , one of the best oktoberfest i have have this year .<ssssss>
6 8 6 9 5		another great brew from shorts .<ssssss>thanks glazeman !<ssssss>a - hazy orange with some touch of pink and light copper with a one finger off white head that fade away to nothing .<ssssss>no head retention and no lacing .<ssssss>s - lime , hop , and some general sourness .<ssssss>insanely interesting and wonderful - what a fun beer .<ssssss>t - lime and biscuit through out with some pilsner wheatiness in the finish with a awesome tangy sugar cookie aftertaste .<ssssss>awesome .<ssssss>m - thin , remind I of a regular ol ' bmc brew .<ssssss>d - very sweet and tangy .<ssssss>this brew have a ton go on and i absolutely love it .<ssssss>i would stock a six pack of these at any chance that i have .<ssssss>however , the tanginess and sweetness make this one a one-per-sitting type of affair .<ssssss>
6 5 8 5 5		the appearance be impeccably clear golden yellow color .<ssssss>the color itself be fine , but not much body .<ssssss>high-tide foamy head , fade quickly .<ssssss>the aroma be that of a lager .<ssssss>some crisp pale malt , but no hop aroma .<ssssss>smell really more like a pale lager than anything .<ssssss>not great .<ssssss>the taste be heavy crystalline pale malt .<ssssss>any flowery hop presence be overshadow by creamy malt .<ssssss>probably more bitter because of malt than anything .<ssssss>a hop or two would have help , but probably would not have save it .<ssssss>the feel be creamy and fizzy , actually the best part of the beer .<ssssss>sit on the tongue ; solid .<ssssss>overall this might be good for extra pale fan , but i be not among they .<ssssss>too dry and too bitter with no actual flavor .<ssssss>
10 8 6 5 6		pour with a massive amount of bright white head , and have a perfectly clean and golden straw color body .<ssssss>the aroma initially be toasty and biscuity .<ssssss>it finish with a spicy note .<ssssss>this brew do not have the traditional lemon drop smack that i prefer in a pilsner .<ssssss>the malt be more dominant .<ssssss>there be a slight strange earthy undertone .<ssssss>this do feel clean and refreshing , but i do not feel this should be classify as a pilsner , even though the brewery do .<ssssss>i would say this be more of a clean helle .<ssssss>this brew be good to go with bbq , as well as asian and german dish , no doubt .<ssssss>however , this be not a classic german pilsner by any means .<ssssss>a final thought ... why do this brewery have three freak different pilsner ?<ssssss>
8 8 4 9 9		drink 7/12/06 this be my one of my favorite of the night .<ssssss>nice almost black body with very nice head retention and lace .<ssssss>slight caramel smell with a bit of hop .<ssssss>taste be very light but still have some molasses/carmelized to balance with the bitter hop .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit light with above average carbonation make the backside of the beer feel weak ; though a dash of smokiness save it .<ssssss>very balanced beer overall .<ssssss>
5 6 3 3 7		this will be my shortest review .<ssssss>the beer be pink .<ssssss>it have a hint of citrus in the nose .<ssssss>it have no flavor .<ssssss>my wife describe it as have less flavor that natty light .<ssssss>i have to agree with she .<ssssss>sad , very sad .<ssssss>why would they bottle and sell this ?<ssssss>a sad one for magic hat .<ssssss>
8 4 6 5 5		purchase draft in a frosted mug at boston pizza .<ssssss>i have have one too many expensive sam adam at this point .<ssssss>a : straw yellow , clear and surprisingly nice lacing s : corn , vegetal & light spiciness -lrb- perhaps from hop ? -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>nothing special here , not real malt on the nose t : just like these lager claim they should be when ice cold .<ssssss>the beer be crisp & clean without any major flavour protruding -lrb- how be this a positive feature ? -rrb-<ssssss>with some light corn & sweetness poke through .<ssssss>m : strong carbonation that be prickly , and detract from its flavour -lrb- although some may view this positively -rrb- d : enjoyable , yet strong vegetal flavour & aroma take away form my ability & desire to have another , even after drink a few ...<ssssss>
8 5 8 7 8		pour a dark brown with a light brown head that lace well and be quite persistent .<ssssss>aroma be of caramel , coffee and something not so pleasant .<ssssss>this off aroma be hard for I to identify , but make I almost think i have a bad bottle .<ssssss>the flavor , however , be exactly what i be expect .<ssssss>coffee and a nice sweetness be most evident .<ssssss>a slight roasted/charred character also lay in hiding .<ssssss>bitterness be moderate and fit well with the rest of the beer .<ssssss>one i would definitely like to try on tap .<ssssss>
3 3 3 5 8		very light and unattractive appearance you can almost not smell it when u take a whiff for a very cheap beer its not the worse way over carbonate , can not stand it for long in my mouth if there be something else i would drink it .<ssssss>but it be easy to drink .<ssssss>i be a college student , no matter how bad this beer add up to a true beer , it be a great deal for its price .<ssssss>compare to other cheap light beer this stuff be great .<ssssss>however , not a overall good beer .<ssssss>
8 8 10 7 7		a -- `` none more black . ''<ssssss>but really , absolutely black , limp dark brown head do not last long .<ssssss>s -- alcohol , charcoal , roasted/burnt malt , chocolate , soy sauce , more alcohol t -- there be so much go on in this beer that you can find something new with every sip : heavy on the charcoal/smoked/roasted flavor , chocolate ice cream , raisin , licorice , soy sauce , lemon peel -lrb- ? -rrb-<ssssss>; flavor coat you mouth and last for a long time after each sip m -- thick .<ssssss>melt milkshake thick .<ssssss>d -- i do not think that drinkability be really the word .<ssssss>the beer seem to dare you to sip more , in all of its ruggedness ; sometimes the challenge be a pleasure , sometimes it be a chore .<ssssss>-- - i have previously give this beer across the board 5 , base on a previous sample -- a bottle that be about 18 month old .<ssssss>the above be base on a fresh sample .<ssssss>while i be sure that the aged sample do not deserve anywhere near the perfect 5 , it be notably better , and i will be curious to review again , with another aged sample .<ssssss>
8 10 9 8 8		this beer pour a dark black color with a small tan head .<ssssss>the smell be strong , sweet and creamy .<ssssss>the taste be very strong , its creamy , its sweet witha nice oat taste .<ssssss>a bit of a sharp bite at the end .<ssssss>very nice carbonation .<ssssss>overall a great milk stout .<ssssss>
6 6 6 4 5		aroma-i be get the raspberry hint off of this with some mixed light chocolate type malt scent .<ssssss>it meld together for a pleasant scent which remind I of something , i can not quite place it though .<ssssss>some type of candy i think mouthfeel-medium to light carbonation , not too much on the palette as far as the weight and body go .<ssssss>bit heavier than water .<ssssss>appearance-poured to about 3/8 '' head , dissipate fairly quickly although the slight remainder be lace pretty nicely .<ssssss>pour into chimay goblet , get a nice deep red/dark mahogany color .<ssssss>taste-a mix of the raspberry with some slight tartness and some sweeter malt taste .<ssssss>a bit of residual sourness after the finish , but this have sort of a sweet theme .<ssssss>this seem one-dimensional to I and really be not all that complex or good for that matter .<ssssss>drinkability-body 's light enough to have a few , abv 6.5 % seem alright but i be not really all that blow away .<ssssss>sam smith 's fruit brew be easily better , price here be a bit of a prohibitive factor also .<ssssss>overall-truthfully i have grow accustomed to some of the fruit theme beer and this do not seem all that good .<ssssss>better belgian fruit beer out there .<ssssss>
8 10 10 8 9		3 floyd alpha klaus be one of the few beer that really surprise I in 2011 .<ssssss>i have it for the first time during we nye celebration and split it amongst a few friend .<ssssss>i decide that with my last bomber i would be selfish and write up a proper review .<ssssss>it be really a great look porter .<ssssss>dark like a fine cup of joe , alpha klaus be top with a thick cappuccino-colored head .<ssssss>the head die off eventually to just a skimming but spiderweb fantastically .<ssssss>with a bouquet fill with hop , 3 floyd stay true to they uncompromising modi operandus .<ssssss>roasted barley take place center stage along with a nose full of piney/earthy , floral and juicily citric hop .<ssssss>i do not know how to say this without sound weird , but this be a juicy smell porter .<ssssss>lot of great caramel and coffee note come through as well and help make this solidly a `` a '' beer .<ssssss>first thing to hit the palate be definitely the note of roasted coffee .<ssssss>mouthful after mouthful , roasted barley and chocolate malt be the key player well-rounded with earthy hop .<ssssss>though there seem to be a lot of hop aroma in the nose , hop do not overwhelm the mouth .<ssssss>they do not underwhelm either .<ssssss>a little bit of citrus , a good amount of pine and just the right bittering .<ssssss>.<ssssss>i do not use the word ` awesome ' to describe a beer too often but ... awesome .<ssssss>smooth , a bit creamy and highly drinkable make 3 floyd alpha klaus christmas porter a clear winner in my humble opinion .<ssssss>though i be always willing to share , i be glad to have this bomber all for myself .<ssssss>
10 9 10 8 10		classic cantillon nose deep with earth be flawless -- funky and lightly mouthwater , complex , yet calm .<ssssss>it be no surprise , however , how much of a beast this beer actually be .<ssssss>prototypic lambic palette of wet earth that open up to hint of cocoa and salt from the cab franc .<ssssss>smooth and wonderfully balanced .<ssssss>relax , relax .<ssssss>ng<ssssss>
8 6 6 9 9		a - pour into a pint class ; beer settle into a deep amber/red color with about a 2 finger , off-white head .<ssssss>fresh-taste date present on label .<ssssss>s - sweet malt and flowery hop with a hint of caramel .<ssssss>t - initial flavor be that of the sweet malt , and then the bitter hop make they presence know in a big way during the after-taste m - good carbonation , smooth , and light-bodied d - good drinkabilty .<ssssss>irish red would make for a pretty good session beer if only the abv be a tad bit lower the thing that really stand out to I about this beer , besides the red color , be the earthy , hoppy aftertaste .<ssssss>i really enjoy this brew .<ssssss>
9 9 6 8 7		this beer pour a dark brown with a thin head that leave minimal lacing .<ssssss>good odor of molasses and coffee and maybe a little of the roasted grain that i link to most stout .<ssssss>flavor be good , with strong hop accompany by coffee and some sweetness .<ssssss>the coffee and malt become a little more apparent as the beer warm .<ssssss>all in all , a good brew .<ssssss>i would drink it again if i could get ahold of some down here .<ssssss>
8 5 6 4 6		last can of six that my spouse get I .<ssssss>she know i like regional bev .<ssssss>look decent .<ssssss>stable foam .<ssssss>lack aroma .<ssssss>could be a old can .<ssssss>malty , spike with sour bitterness .<ssssss>bitter but muddy .<ssssss>need more hop presence .<ssssss>lack what id expect of a ipa .<ssssss>
8 8 8 9 6		this beer be accidentally freeze .<ssssss>not know it be freeze , i pop the cork to find icy bit .<ssssss>i have since let it thaw and as a result , not much in the way of carbonation .<ssssss>pour from 12oz ?<ssssss>bottle into a pilsner glass .<ssssss>vintage dated 2003 bottle .<ssssss>appearance - absolutely black with no red hue anywhere .<ssssss>i would assume under normal circumstance there would be some head , but now its a creamy oil slick over the top .<ssssss>smell - a bit boozy , chocolate and coffee and cream greet the nose first , then more chocolate and black patent .<ssssss>taste - just like the smell , alcohol upfront , then the coffee , then the cream .<ssssss>this be a nice stout but in a way one dimensional .<ssssss>i wonder if the lack of carbonation be contribute to this .<ssssss>mouthfeel - full body to be certain .<ssssss>a bit sticky on the lip and warm with alcohol .<ssssss>drinkability - not so high on the drinkability of this one .<ssssss>the alcohol , state as 9 % on my bottle , and 10 % as state here on ba , be not something you can chug back on a regular basis .<ssssss>
8 8 7 9 7		pour a viscous black with no head , just a thin tan lace .<ssssss>this beer be almost flat , there be just a hint of carbonation .<ssssss>the aroma be of chocolate and coffee , with a tinge of sweet malt .<ssssss>the flavor be well balanced .<ssssss>coffee and chocolate malt dominate .<ssssss>the beer be balanced well between sweetness and bitterness .<ssssss>there be no perceptible hop flavor .<ssssss>the alcohol be well hide .<ssssss>a very good ris , but need a tad bit more carbonation .<ssssss>
6 6 8 5 4		from note : pour out a hazy , yellow/straw with a minimal head and no lace .<ssssss>the smell consist of wheat malt and bread .<ssssss>not much in the hop department .<ssssss>i like german pilsner but this taste more like a hefe than a pilsner .<ssssss>no real hop character .<ssssss>the mouth be smooth and light .<ssssss>i be just go to assume that i need to try a fresh one .<ssssss>i be unimpressed and of the belief that i get a bad beer .<ssssss>
5 6 3 2 2		bleagh !<ssssss>there be not many beer i willingly throw down the sink , but this be one of they .<ssssss>this bottle condition beer pour with a slight haze as you might expect , produce a dark russet colour beer .<ssssss>the aroma have a slight fruitiness to it .<ssssss>tasting it be not a pleasant experience .<ssssss>far too many off-flavour of pear-drop and sourness i would expect from a gueze rather than a english bitter .<ssssss>two mouthfull and i could stand no more .<ssssss>truly awful .<ssssss>i hope i just have a bad bottle .<ssssss>
6 8 6 6 6		have the bottled version of this beer in a beer tasting event .<ssssss>it pour a nutty brown murky color with a fair amount of carbonation but little head that quickly disappear .<ssssss>it a neat beer with a unusual flavor and feel .<ssssss>it have a smooth maple flavor that have a zestyness to it due to the carbonation .<ssssss>its unusual and drinkable but a little sweet to drink all the time .<ssssss>i would try other beer from this brewery to see if they be as intriguing .<ssssss>
8 6 4 6 4		what exactly be the significance of someone who bite pillar ?<ssssss>anyway , the beer pour with a hazy , orangish straw color .<ssssss>it be well carbonated and top by a initially three-finger thick , pale almost white color head .<ssssss>the aroma be quite funky and spicy ; it smell a bit of moldy , funky cheese and also of earthy spice , damp earth , and perhaps a hint of phenolic plastic .<ssssss>lot of different phenolic aromatic be here though .<ssssss>well carbonated , the beer foam up as it first hit my tongue .<ssssss>it be fairly dry as well and finish with a light tartness .<ssssss>despite this , it have a medium fullness to the palate .<ssssss>as the beer lose carbonation it pick up a hint of sweetness , but it remain quite a austere beer overall .<ssssss>the beer have a spicy character that be a mix of white pepper , ginger , lemon peel , and a earthy note sort of like coriander , but much more gear towards damp earth .<ssssss>that funky cheese note be here in the flavor as well , it be not quite that prominent , but be certainly quite noticeable .<ssssss>there be some lightly noticeable fruit note here as well , with note of pear and apple be most noticeable .<ssssss>this beer be just not that great , the cheesy note certainly do not help , but even without that there be not enough here to really hold my interest .<ssssss>
6 4 8 5 8		well i have to say i love the mouthfeel when it hit just the right temperature .<ssssss>it be just so creamy and crisp .<ssssss>otherwise , i feel like stella be a overly process attempt at a belgian pale lager .<ssssss>it be difficult to review because of how generic it taste .<ssssss>i suppose it be fresher than most bmc , but retain the manufacture quality .<ssssss>that say , i would definitely drink it over other bmc alternative .<ssssss>oh , and i like the foil top -- i think that really get people into think it be a `` premium '' beer .<ssssss>
10 6 7 9 8		a : this be possibly the most gorgeous beer i have ever see .<ssssss>pour into a water goblet and hold up into the light of the early morning sun , this maredsous 10 be a radiant orange .<ssssss>the soft , cloud like white head be support by a lively stream of carbonation .<ssssss>lace coat the glass on all side , top to bottom .<ssssss>a : soft and slighty yeasty .<ssssss>mild phenol and a bit of citrus .<ssssss>t : sweet banana , balanced grassy hop bitterness , slighty spicy/peppery .<ssssss>a hint of alcohol with a linger subtle medicinal finish .<ssssss>m : a bit too sharp for my liking , but every tripel be .<ssssss>d : about as drinkable as a beer of 10 % can .<ssssss>alcohol aside , quite refreshing after a long night at work .<ssssss>
10 8 8 5 7		r & d golden ale brew 3-23-09 and bottled on 6-18-09 .<ssssss>pour in a new belgium tulip .<ssssss>a : shiny gold beer with a white , towering head .<ssssss>it do settle down , a bit , but a foamy pillow float on the surface down to the last gulp .<ssssss>wonderful brussels lacing .<ssssss>effervescent and sparkling .<ssssss>a : musty and funk force themselves on nose , so strong that artisanal cheese and barnyard come to mind .<ssssss>beneath the brettanomyce , lemon zest , grass and white pepper be hide .<ssssss>t : follow smell , but brettanomyce be even more evident and the full spectrum of its character be evident : barnyard , horse blanket , gym sock , musty basement , moldy cheese rind and so forth .<ssssss>the other belgian pale ale quality be more or less smother .<ssssss>long , super-freak finish .<ssssss>m : medium body and bright carbonation .<ssssss>surprisingly soft mouthfeel .<ssssss>d : r & d golden ale have be take over by brettanomyce , which i do enjoy , and drinkability suffer as a result .<ssssss>nonetheless , i find it interesting and look forward to share my remain bottle with friend this summer .<ssssss>thanks ezrem for the assist !<ssssss>

9 4 7 7 8		this beer give more head than a squad of cheerleader on promnight .<ssssss>no matter how light i pour it it just foam right up , have good retention to boot .<ssssss>nice clear light cherry wood color .<ssssss>perfectly clear body .<ssssss>smell be faint , but mild nut aroma and whisper of grain and earth .<ssssss>would like to be able to actually smell this .<ssssss>this beer be a good example of the style , bitter-sweet , smooth and malt heavy .<ssssss>the flavor really come through as the beer warm .<ssssss>full body malty ale .<ssssss>good beer but nothing overly amazing .<ssssss>
4 3 6 5 5		app : look at first to be a standard stout body , with a little more red than usual .<ssssss>there be minimal head , with little retention , no lacing and if you look really close you will see particle float around .<ssssss>smell : chocolate , raspberry popsicle , ash tray , alcohol and some caramel .<ssssss>ash tray be very unpleasant .<ssssss>taste : baker chocolate and raspberry popsicle .<ssssss>mouthfeel : smooth until the aftertaste where the alcohol hit hard , follow by a strange bitterness that make take a sip almost overwhelming -lrb- but kinda exciting -rrb- .<ssssss>drinkability : this be not appeal to have again .<ssssss>
9 6 7 5 7		750ml bottle into tulip .<ssssss>pour a cloudy , deep strawberry rhubarb color with rise carbonation and a thick head that leave great lacing .<ssssss>smell quite strongly of cherry , with a very light tartness .<ssssss>taste be of overwhelmingly of sweet , almost artificial cherry with quite a strong oak emphasis .<ssssss>while the oak really dominate the flavor , the hop do impart a citric , fruit note , though not necessarily for the best ... there really be not much sourness to speak of , though it do end with a slightly tart dryness .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be medium body , with a pleasant dry finish .<ssssss>this beer be fairly palatable , and while offer a myriad of flavor , they do not blend well and at first really catch I a off-guard .<ssssss>i be initially quite excite for this , but after try it i must say i be a bit disappointed .<ssssss>
9 6 5 7 7		nitro-can into hefe glass appearance -lrb- 4.5 -rrb- : look beautiful , with a creamy white head and complex lacing .<ssssss>typical though this may be of nitro beer , it be still cool to watch the head settle out .<ssssss>color be a light orange-y gold ; it could be a light deeper and richer .<ssssss>smell -lrb- 3.0 -rrb- : a little sweetness , some malt .<ssssss>mostly fruity ester .<ssssss>taste -lrb- 3.5 -rrb- : much like the smell , but the ester really come through .<ssssss>hop not dominant , though there be reasonable bitterness here .<ssssss>this be something of a one-note beer , rely most on the ester , but that can be good .<ssssss>not everything one taste should be a monument to complexity .<ssssss>mouthfeel -lrb- 2.5 -rrb- : the beer be really too thin .<ssssss>i will not go so far as to call it water , as some reviewer have , but it be certainly watery .<ssssss>it be overly bitter for such a light body -lrb- even though it be not terribly bitter in and of itself -rrb- .<ssssss>drinkability -lrb- 3.5 -rrb- : the positive to the thin body be that estery english ale tend to be heavy , and this one give the light-bodied beer drinker a chance to appreciate they deliciousness .<ssssss>still , even at 4.7 % abv , one do not find oneself go back for more with the enthusiasm that should be present with a session beer .<ssssss>
6 6 4 8 7		this one be from note .<ssssss>i have a glass of this at bandwagon 's second anniversary party .<ssssss>bandwagon 's 2nd anniversary beer have a body that be orangish-brown , with no head to speak of .<ssssss>this be not a promising look .<ssssss>the aroma have a lot of sweet malt and a kick of bourbon to it .<ssssss>this taste better than i expect .<ssssss>apparently it spend about 8 month in mckenzie bourbon barrel from finger lake distillery .<ssssss>i be not a big fan of that bourbon on its own , but it add a lot of nice flavor to this one .<ssssss>a little bit of char and some wood mix with smooth , sweet bourbon flavor .<ssssss>pretty much no heat be add from the barrel at all .<ssssss>there might be a touch of vanilla in there as well .<ssssss>the actual beer flavor bring a mix of caramel and sweet malt , with musty hop flavor that taste a little bit old .<ssssss>the body have a touch of heat , but the carbonation be basically dead and the body be a little bit thinner than i would like .<ssssss>the bourbon and other barrel flavor in this one be quite good , but the base beer do not hold up very well to aging .<ssssss>also i have to say , however , that this make I believe that bandwagon could produce some interesting stuff use the wide array of different barrel from finger lake distil or even some of the winery from the finger lake region .<ssssss>
8 3 9 4 4		pour from a growler a few time into my bell tulip .<ssssss>a - dark orange brown , kind of mahogany .<ssssss>white head that be initially good that transform into a wispy scattered cap with a strong encompass ring of foam .<ssssss>s - not very good .<ssssss>very unpleasant metallic smell that remind I of rust .<ssssss>metallic smell be all i be get and its really off put .<ssssss>t - metallic flavor return but be also accompany by a slight citrus hop profile .<ssssss>soapy and rusty would be my best descriptor .<ssssss>weird .<ssssss>m - light crisp and nice carbonation .<ssssss>this be a great feel to bad the flavor do not make you want to drink more .<ssssss>overall i be very disappointed .<ssssss>one of the strangest taste i have come across make this difficult to drink .<ssssss>take this review with a grain of salt .<ssssss>this beer travel a very long distance and i be sure that have something to do with it .<ssssss>i just record what i tasted .<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 9		chocolate brown color and dark head that you would expect from a chocolate stout .<ssssss>very little pop out at I with the smell , just the oh-so-slight scent of chocolate .<ssssss>pretty much the same with the taste , slight chocolate flavor .<ssssss>i would have prefer more of the bitter flavor i be expect from the ` bitter chocolate ' .<ssssss>the chocolate flavor do , however , linger long enough to savor .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very good and just what i expect from a oatmeal stout , silky smooth and very drinkable .<ssssss>at 9.2 % abv i expect a bit more astringency and thankfully , it be not there .<ssssss>all in all , a terrific beer .<ssssss>i be glad i buy 2 bottle .<ssssss>i may even hit the store and grab 1 or 2 more before they be all go .<ssssss>i suggest you do the same .<ssssss>
6 6 5 6 9		better for yardwork than the regular .<ssssss>no real head , big bubble that break down quickly .<ssssss>the smell be unexceptional but clean .<ssssss>the crisp taste be of malt , hop , and a hint of cereal .<ssssss>which be unusual , because it only use malt , but not quite enough .<ssssss>it use more malt than bud regular , that use rice syrup , instead of malt to raise the abv .<ssssss>bud taste clean because there be nothing there .<ssssss>

''<ssssss>it be a flavor that remind I of when i first start homebrewing and bottle a few batch prematurely .<ssssss>it be a flavor of yeast that just do not go away and cling inside the mouth that be quite distracting and be borderline offputting with a flavor that be on the urge of tasting like plastic and bandaid .<ssssss>this be a medium to light body brew with a modest level of carbonation .<ssssss>the alcohol be well hide and it lend itself as a could-be session beer but one be enough for I and i dont know if i will be able to finish the entire glass .<ssssss>i would not recommend this to anyone .<ssssss>

8 7 8 6 9		bottle .<ssssss>bottled on 24/01/2006 , best before 24/01/2011 .<ssssss>pour a orange/amber , small white head , no real lacing to speak of .<ssssss>aroma be flowery and spice , citrusy .<ssssss>taste be rather mild , nothing really stand out to describe , i be surprise by how mild it be .<ssssss>finish be slightly spicey and dry .<ssssss>
6 8 5 6 4		pour a extemely clear , amber-coloured brew -lrb- rather than brown , wich the name suggest -rrb- that produce a small but dense head after a rather hard pour .<ssssss>it dissapear rather quickly too .<ssssss>the smell be malty with some fruity note and some alcohol near the end of the sniff .<ssssss>the taste start of spicy and malty but it soon overtaken by a strong acidic taste of alcohol .<ssssss>the alcohol have a warming effect , wich be nice but the overall mouthfeel be quite poor : same go for the drinkabillity .<ssssss>although this brew argueably hit less hard than the grimbergen triple it be still incredibly heady .<ssssss>quite a alcholic brew .<ssssss>it be okay for once but i will not be buy it again .<ssssss>
9 7 8 10 10		i be new to big beer and this be only the second dipa i have have .<ssssss>i be exspect a hop bomb , like the other dipa i have , but this be more balanced .<ssssss>i be not a big hop-head so this be a pleasant surprise .<ssssss>this bottle be from the 2006 series so maybe it have mellow with age .<ssssss>pour dark amber lacing cling to the side like its life depend on it .<ssssss>smell be more malty , almost resemble a maibock .<ssssss>taste be very balanced and i have a hard time with pick out all the flavor , but it be just really good .<ssssss>frightenly drinkable , probably good they only come in 4-pack .<ssssss>
7 9 7 7 7		a : pour a transparent amber color that give way to a tiny , white cap of foam that retain for a minute , then recede away into a minuscule ring .<ssssss>lacing be decent .<ssssss>s : soft fruit , earthy hop , and a bready malty backbone make this one of the most balanced nose i have come across .<ssssss>pretty good .<ssssss>its like a subtle version of sweetwater ipa .<ssssss>the tropical fruit -lrb- pineapple , mango -rrb- along with apricot make for a interesting aroma .<ssssss>t : similar to the nose , except a lot less balanced somehow ... slightly bitter , the hop be much more dominant than the nose predict .<ssssss>resiny , earthy , and pungent hop be only partially balance by the weaker malt backbone .<ssssss>the fruit character also seem to have be a nose-only character .<ssssss>mf/d : good carbonation , a little rough and unrefined go down , bitter hop finish .<ssssss>
8 8 6 8 9		thanks to mbpbugeye for share !<ssssss>nice crystal clear golden yellow .<ssssss>bubbly and with a nice white head like most belgian .<ssssss>leave nice thick lacing for a ipa .<ssssss>smell sweet and fruity with the traditional yeasty smell of a belgian beer .<ssssss>lot of citrus note in there , quite pleasant .<ssssss>the flavor be spot on for the style .<ssssss>bright citrus , juicy hop .<ssssss>plenty of bitterness but nothing overpowering .<ssssss>fairly light body and easy drinking .<ssssss>i drink my glass pretty quickly .<ssssss>

9 9 8 5 7		on-tap at prime 16 .<ssssss>thanks , bartender , for hook I up with a terrific pour .<ssssss>a : black body with orange highlight under a nice , frothy head of brown foam .<ssssss>good retention , lot of lace .<ssssss>very attractive brew .<ssssss>s : w ... .<ssssss>t ... .<ssssss>f. this do not smell like beer , and nor do it smell like creme brulee exactly , but it do smell amazing .<ssssss>gigantic aroma of vanilla , butterscotch , and candy corn absolutely radiate from the glass , provide the most incredibly sweet and candied smell i have ever experience from a liquid , much less a beer .<ssssss>this be insane , and i be pretty sure that be what they be go for .<ssssss>insanity achieve .<ssssss>t : it be still insane , but less in a fun willy wonka way than a terrifying clown sort of way : horrifically sweet , to the point of be heart-stopping .<ssssss>the sweetness alone would not turn I off so much if it be not join by a jarringly intense booziness that make I feel more like a alcoholic chug butterscotch schnapps from a brown bag than a beer connoisseur enjoy a fine imperial stout .<ssssss>i '' m not sure how i feel about that .<ssssss>m : thick , sticky , and full of enough lively carbonation to keep the stickiness somewhat at bay .<ssssss>pretty good .<ssssss>o : i can not imagine anyone drinking and enjoy a entire bomber of this at a sit , but in small dose it be well worth experience just for the novelty .<ssssss>cheer !<ssssss>
9 10 8 8 9		1 pint pour a dark amber with one finger foamy off white head .<ssssss>thin lace all the way down .<ssssss>nose be big on hop ; cirtus and pine , good amount of bready malt too .<ssssss>auroma of the oak linger .<ssssss>taste wise , this be a well balanced beer where the strongbarley and malt dominate the flavour profile , less of a hop bite than the nose would lead to believe , but certainly some lingeriing in the finish .<ssssss>medium to heavy mouthfeel , good carbonation present .<ssssss>this be a delicious brew from stone .<ssssss>glad to be able to find it , cool bottle design and jumbled write style .<ssssss>unbelievably smooth on the palatte , such a easy drinker .<ssssss>
8 5 8 5 6		a - pour a dark raspberry color with a bubbly two-finger pink head .<ssssss>s - massive raspberry aroma as soon as the cork come out , pretty sweet smell like a piece of hard candy , lot of syrup , almost like smell a glass of raspberry flavored cough syrup , not that great .<ssssss>t - big raspberry flavor , very sweet and syrupy , tartness be there but be highly subdue , mild yeasty barnyard flavor .<ssssss>the flavor be just so sweet and overpowering , it taste like raspberry extract and artificial sweetener .<ssssss>m - light body , high carbonation , crisp feel .<ssssss>o - way too sweet with artificial raspberry flavoring , the hallmark of lambic , the tartness and great yeast flavor , be mostly absent .<ssssss>if you blindfold I i would guess i be drink a raspberry smirnoff ice .<ssssss>i love lambic but could not finish my glass of this beer .<ssssss>
10 7 8 7 10		i pick this up at planet liquor in baytown , texa .<ssssss>a small amount of dust have start to accumulate on the bottle , i wish i could have rescue the rest of they .<ssssss>luckily , the brew still taste pretty damn good .<ssssss>appearance be black , dark amber if you put a light through it .<ssssss>head be a brown-tan color and very puffy ; it dissipate relatively quickly but leave lacing from top to bottom .<ssssss>aroma be pretty light but please nonetheless .<ssssss>obviously lot of chocolate note , but also some bitter hop and alcohol .<ssssss>the taste be very much the same , but with more of the hop bitterness .<ssssss>my palate be not develop enough to identify the hop or even describe the quality , but there be a hint of bitterness upfront , then a flash of stronger bitterness , with a chocolatey finish .<ssssss>not much be leave of the taste afterword , just faint chocolate .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be very smooth , slightly chalky , which i like .<ssssss>medium body , much lighter than i expect , but in a chocolatey beer like this , i think the high drinkability be genius .<ssssss>note : beer may have be somewhat past its freshness , also , the taste change a lot with temperature .<ssssss>the colder it be , the more chocolate i could taste -lrb- i have it in a glass as i take note and drink what as leave out of the bottle later , it be more chill then -rrb- .<ssssss>
8 7 8 10 8		have this beer on tap ?<ssssss>at mug 's ale house in williamsburg .<ssssss>yes , i think it must have be one of the first keg of ommegang , because all i have ever see of there stuff be bottle .<ssssss>the beer be serve in a belgian goblet glass , 10 oz .<ssssss>pour .<ssssss>it have a thin wisping of head that linger throughout the tasting .<ssssss>the aroma be not as strong as i think ; perhaps due to the shape of the glass .<ssssss>i get a deep caramel aroma with strong spice and alcohol tinge .<ssssss>the taste be phenomenol , and i could definitely appreciate the mellow flavor of the yeast as the beer round out over time .<ssssss>the beer be medium to full-bodied , but more of a full finish .<ssssss>overall , despite its strength , i find it to be a extremely drinkable brew .<ssssss>my hat be tip to ommegang in upstate for this one .<ssssss>
8 7 9 7 6		appearance : pour a clear amber color with a thick , tight bubbled head that retain as a creamy cap and leave a swirl pattern of lace smell : hyped-up oktoberfest malty tone but the fusel alcohol come through , clearly taste : big , caramel malt flavor , up front but by mid-palate , a combination of hop and fusel alcohol take the beer in a less than palatable direction ; after the swallow , the alcohol retain its strength in the finish , though i would guess the hop be stronger when the beer be fresh mouthfeel : medium to full body , somewhat creamy , with moderate carbonation drinkability : the best thing about this beer be the mouthfeel and i find it rare that i would make that comment ; the malt profile be miss something that would identify it as germanic , for some reason , and the alcohol flavor be just downright disconcerting<ssssss>
8 8 8 6 8		with the high abv -lrb- over 7 -rrb- , i be expect a big hop presence .<ssssss>the smell be also heavy with citrus and floral note .<ssssss>then i taste it .<ssssss>it be very malty ... too sweet for my liking .<ssssss>this ipa drink more like a weak amber ale .<ssssss>i also get a bad after taste ... almost like dirty water .<ssssss>it be nice that it be organic , but this just do not cut it as a ipa .<ssssss>i have have it and now it be off my list .<ssssss>
5 7 4 4 3		a - slightly hazy copper to auburn with a medium head with no lacing .<ssssss>s - caramel malt with a touch of vanilla and some golden delicious apple .<ssssss>t - slight smokey sweetness with a hint of apple flavor follow by a very potent , and not so pleasant , hop bitterness that linger long , far , far , far too long , after i sip .<ssssss>the aftertaste ruin this beer .<ssssss>m - carbonation too high , viscous , slightly refreshing , but the oppressive aftertaste ruin the prospect of true refreshment .<ssssss>d - pretty bad .<ssssss>i pass off the second half of my bomber .<ssssss>it just be not a enjoyable brew .<ssssss>i do not know about food pairing , i think there might be something with which it would be sucessfully paired , but i can not envision it -lrb- might be the barleywine that i just drink -rrb- .<ssssss>sessionable ?<ssssss>no .<ssssss>not at all .<ssssss>it be weak enough for sure , but the aftertaste destroy the prospect of session this beer .<ssssss>
9 8 10 8 8		obtain in january 2007 .<ssssss>pour into a pint glass appearance - black as night .<ssssss>look like spend motor oil and i could not be happier .<ssssss>frothy head that dissapate into a creamy top layer not unlike guiness .<ssssss>fairly minimal lacing smell - espresso , licorice , bourbon , chocolate malt , vanilla .<ssssss>taste - thick chocolate goodness with the bourbon barrel aging present .<ssssss>this beer be quite underrated .<ssssss>it be not goose island bourbon county or kentucky breakfast , but this be a great stout to house back and enjoy every few months/years .<ssssss>coffee flavour come in with a bit of alcohol warmth and oak .<ssssss>creamy !<ssssss>mouthfeel - medium body with a slightly acidic aftertaste .<ssssss>chocolate linger on the toungue long after first sip be have .<ssssss>drinkability - a great beer that i could drink until it be too late .<ssssss>fine bourbon prescence that do not go overboard as many other do .<ssssss>` bigness ' make it more of a sipper than a multiple drinker .<ssssss>great beer .<ssssss>
10 7 10 6 7		this be a review of the 2011 vintage that just hit shelf , so this be a pretty fresh bottle for what it be worth .<ssssss>deep brown in the light , but nearly black from more than a few inch away .<ssssss>a off-white head spring up from a normal pour and surprisingly have some stay power .<ssssss>pretty unusual for a barrel aged beer and one this strong .<ssssss>i be impressed !<ssssss>the nose be bourbon heavy , with a little bit of coffee and dark chocolate .<ssssss>no real surprise , although the bourbon note be strong .<ssssss>the flavor lean in the same direction .<ssssss>sweet malt , roasted coffee , and semi-sweet chocolate give way to a fair amount of bourbon character , which really do overpower thing a bit .<ssssss>instead of a compliment , it be more of a clash or hostile takeover in this case .<ssssss>subsequent sip tend to favor that bourbon note more and more .<ssssss>it be not bad , but maybe just a little heavy .<ssssss>i think the body of the stout just need more pep in the malt department to keep up .<ssssss>usually that be only a problem for milder stout .<ssssss>mouthfeel be about as good as a beer like this can get .<ssssss>it be thick and rich , with very steady carbonation .<ssssss>some element of this be wonderful and other be lack .<ssssss>it be not bad , but not all that good either .<ssssss>sometimes it feel like a 6 % stout with a 1/2 shot of bourbon in it .<ssssss>i have this beer on tap a few year ago and recall have similar feeling then , too .<ssssss>i think the base beer be really the weak link here .<ssssss>no infection issue , but generally a unspectacular offering anyway .<ssssss>
10 10 8 7 7		pour pitch black and completely opaque with a a two finger frothy dark mocha/coffee color head with good retention , slowly fading into a lasting cap .<ssssss>splotch of spotty lacing be leave behind .<ssssss>roasted chocolate malt aroma with hint of espresso/coffee bean , sweet milk and dark chocolate , licorice , molasses , honey as well as some subtle earthy hop .<ssssss>not overly roasty with a good balance of sweet chocolate .<ssssss>the aroma be amazing and very complex .<ssssss>chewy viscous mouthfeel with a very prominent roasty character and ton of sweet silky chocolate maltiness .<ssssss>lot of deep roasted cofee/espresso bean flavor up front and dry earthy hop with some pine character .<ssssss>this be counter by a silky dark and milky chocolate presence mid palate and a lot of rost malt , molasses and burnt toast flavor .<ssssss>more roasty espresso and coffe bean presence in the finish .<ssssss>i think that this beer would be a bit sweeter but it be very dry , bitter and roasty and the hop profile be much more dominant than i would have like .<ssssss>this beer be a bit rough when fresh but i feel the flavor will improve greatly with age .<ssssss>abv be very well mask .<ssssss>it be hard to believe it be 11 % .<ssssss>
6 7 9 8 7		bottled on `` 100120 '' fond tradition 12.7 oz bottle pour into a dt tulip pour a simple orange with a off-white head that go away with a typical lambic speed .<ssssss>not much too look at in the glass .<ssssss>smell of brett , sour apple , a little funky wet saddle as well .<ssssss>taste very acidic and brett forward start with a soft pineapple subtly in there .<ssssss>mouthfeel be my favorite aspect of this beer .<ssssss>great carbonation with a super dryness that linger on the palate .<ssssss>overall not bad but i enjoy boon geuze a bit more .<ssssss>
10 7 10 10 9		pour from a 12oz can into a nonic .<ssssss>this be black .<ssssss>blacker than the blackest black time infinity .<ssssss>hold this right up to a lightbulb .<ssssss>nothing shine through at all .<ssssss>the head be very very dark color , but it be fairly thin and minimal .<ssssss>that be alright though because this be black .<ssssss>viscous .<ssssss>look like it be deadly serious .<ssssss>the aroma be probably the weakest part of this beer .<ssssss>i be have a hard time coax a big aroma out of this , there be some chocolate and matiness , but not too much more .<ssssss>the taste be absolutely sublime .<ssssss>smooth dark chocolate give way to some dark fruit and just a touch of a hop kick .<ssssss>vanilla and absolutely perfect roasted malt finish this off .<ssssss>just fantastic .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be extremely thick and full body , with a light , yet noticeable amount of carbonation .<ssssss>.<ssssss>absolutely perfect for the style .<ssssss>the drinkability be absurd for the abv , this go down way easier than the 10.50 % on the can claim .<ssssss>a superlative ris from oskar blues .<ssssss>seriously .<ssssss>drink this .<ssssss>it be so good .<ssssss>
8 9 10 9 8		this great beer pour a nice , deep chocolate brown with a light tan head .<ssssss>it smell vinous with a nice malt hint to it .<ssssss>there be undertone of grape and fresh baked bread smell .<ssssss>taste yeasty , with malty and vinous flavour .<ssssss>almost like drinking bread .<ssssss>very enjoyable .<ssssss>alcohol be present and certainly detectable but by no means in you face and overpowering .<ssssss>carbonation be well do ; this be not bubbly or fizzy but do not come off as a oil slick .<ssssss>overall a great belgian beer .<ssssss>i continuously question myself as to why i have ignore belgian beer in the past .<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 8		pour a light brown , clove color .<ssssss>thick 1-inch white foamy head that dissipate to inch after a few minute .<ssssss>not much lacing .<ssssss>smell of smoked bacon , but not overwhelming .<ssssss>some malt .<ssssss>a smoky taste , but not as overpowering as i remember from when i visit the brewery .<ssssss>a hint of creaminess one would expect from a weizen , even a hint of banana hide behind the smoke .<ssssss>finish be smoke , a little dry , and slight smoky aftertaste .<ssssss>mouthfeel be crisp , and full .<ssssss>some carbonation hit the back of my throat .<ssssss>i remember not really enjoy this beer when i have it in bamberg 2-year ago .<ssssss>but frankly , i enjoy it today .<ssssss>the `` best before '' date be dec09 , so , the bottle be approx 1-year old .<ssssss>perhaps the smoke fad with time ?<ssssss>anyhow , i would drink another .<ssssss>
9 9 8 10 8		have this one at my place in newtown , ct. once again , mark get the real deal on draught .<ssssss>the best maubock i have ever taste .<ssssss>appearance be a nice deep cooper color .<ssssss>the aroma be all about the malt .<ssssss>taste , bread-like , close to a doppelbock , but a little bit more balanced .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very smooth with pretty low carbonation .<ssssss>abv be well conceal , so you can down a bunch , but be careful .<ssssss>a world class offering from einbecker .<ssssss>
5 10 8 7 7		many thanks to dyan for share this the other day .<ssssss>mango mama be not a particularly attractive beer , pour a hazy , murky , light amber brown color with at best fair head retention and minimal lacing .<ssssss>the beer do not look like much , but then i take my first sniff .<ssssss>my oh my , mango mama be right on the mark for describe this beer .<ssssss>i get a huge aroma of mango , orange citrus , peach , apricot and yet more mango .<ssssss>i can imagine it would be a bummer of the first order if someone who do not like mango order this beer , but as i do ... suffice it to say , i think this beer smell pretty incredible .<ssssss>on the palate ... .<ssssss>hmmmm ... well , to no great surprise there be plenty of sweet mango flavor , but then the orange citrus , grapefruit rind and hoppy bitterness come on strong .<ssssss>i guess the beer be `` as advertise , '' but i be not convince that the mango flavor work all that well with the normal , masala mama flavor profile .<ssssss>it be still pretty tasty , but for my money , i prefer the regular version to the mango version .<ssssss>on the other hand , i do apprecaite how the hoppy bitterness counter and otherwise keep in check the sweet tropical fruit flavor in this beer .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium body to full , with a long , hoppy , fairly dry finish .<ssssss>drinkability be not bad , with the alcohol barely noticeable .<ssssss>a interesting effort , and certainly not a bad beer , but for I , i believe i will stick to the regular ipa version of this beer .<ssssss>
8 8 9 6 6		i be not sure which release this be .<ssssss>cork be decay when i open it have to be very careful not to drop the rest into the bottle .<ssssss>pour from a bottle into a snifter .<ssssss>pour a deep deep chestnut almost black because of the sediment in the bottom of the bottle equivalent to soy sauce .<ssssss>also almost no carbonation that settle in a blink .<ssssss>this to I smell like maple syrup with hint of chocolate with a very very malty smell .<ssssss>taste be now just ridiculous with alcohol almost like i take a sip of whiskey , taste maple syrup and very dark aged chocolate .<ssssss>have a aftertaste of whiskey as it burn in the chest .<ssssss>most unique lacing i have see yet with all the sediment chunky settle around the glass .<ssssss>not to sound like a chump but this be the first time i have to chase a beer with water .<ssssss>a very unique brew if you can find it try it .<ssssss>p.s .<ssssss>thanks to my new friend fnsweet for let I try this one .<ssssss>
8 7 10 10 9		appearance - dark saturated brown permeate by light hue of glisten burnt yellow when light hit it , slight head retention all most non-existent , minuet limited carbonation bubble rise in a methodical manner to the top of the glass almost as if they be drive to defy gravity smell - clean with a modest chocolate flavor intertwine with a smidgen of alcohol taste - unprecedented umami mouthfeel - smooth as kobe 's fade away with a light touch of baby bottom silkiness , uniform from begin to finish with excellent moisture release and flawless density overall - `` sweet nectar of the god '' -lrb- i highly recommend try this beer and it would be a absolute delight with bbq -rrb-<ssssss>
10 7 9 10 9		i share a 75cl bottle of this tripel with a good friend and family member a few hour ago and pour it into two separate chimay chalice .<ssssss>appearance : gorgeous opaque golden orange in color with a foamy eggshell white head .<ssssss>aroma : not all that fragrant in my personal opinion , but what i be able to smell be orange , honey , and clove , daffodil , and very hidden yeast and wheat scent .<ssssss>flavor : wonderful in taste truly a exquisite beverage , right off the bat i be greet by the sensation of orange , honey , clove , yeast , and wheat gluten with a very slight after taste of hoppy bitterness that work perfectly with the overall combination .<ssssss>after a few more drink i be also able to taste banana , lemon , cinnamon , and slight hint of rose .<ssssss>throughout the experience it provide a very subtle hint of alcohol but just enough to tickle the taste bud .<ssssss>as it warm up it have a pungent ginger bite to it .<ssssss>truly marvelous flavor .<ssssss>feel : smooth texture with medium carbonation that easily subside into a relax foam and leisurely slip over the tongue and down the throat .<ssssss>slight detraction come from the hoppy bitterness but all in all it feel lovely .<ssssss>drinkability : with a taste and mouthfeel like the the one this beer offer i could have easily swallow the entire bottle 's worth .<ssssss>however the amount of alcohol per bottle be the one preventative .<ssssss>all in all a truly wonderful brew that i be sure will be another purchase of mine in the near future .<ssssss>
9 8 8 7 9		appearance : golden complexion body with a thinnish , near white head .<ssssss>decent lacing .<ssssss>smell : subtle hop presence , smell liek a typical pilsner taste : earthy and and nice hope presence for a lager , but i expect that from dfh .<ssssss>why not amp it more though ?<ssssss>use only german czech hop retain that typical skunky taste too .<ssssss>great for style but i would not prefer this over alot of beer .<ssssss>mouthfeel : light body drinkability : nice pilsner .<ssssss>probably not drink again though .<ssssss>

6 8 4 7 7		while far from bad , this brew be a disappointing offering from high point and merely a above average brew overall .<ssssss>it pour a lackluster semi cloudy golden colour with a faint head that dissolve rather quickly and leave no trace of residue on the glass .<ssssss>the aroma include wheat , spice a touch of banana , some hop note and a hint of sweet candy .<ssssss>the flavour be pretty much more of the same although hop presence be not as prominent and the sweet and fruity flavour be mellow by a bit of , well , nothing .<ssssss>the flavour just seem to go flat at time .<ssssss>part of this be likely because the mouthfeel be very flat as well .<ssssss>it almost seem syrupy at time .<ssssss>while not completely uncarbonated , this be a far cry from what the mouthfeel of a hefeweizen should be .<ssssss>again , this be not a great brew , but far from undrinkable .<ssssss>if they could fix the mouthfeel problem it would help considerably and make this more of a viable option , especially in the summer month .<ssssss>
6 4 6 8 10		have this on tap at the village tavern .<ssssss>it be pour into a hour shaped glass and have a minimal white head that do not last hardly anytime .<ssssss>it leave no lacing to speak of .<ssssss>the nose be weak , but be mostly malty .<ssssss>as for the taste i can only describe it as beer .<ssssss>there be almost no hop presence and its mostly grainy .<ssssss>it be very refreshing , probably because it be very watery .<ssssss>i love drinking pbr .<ssssss>maybe i be a victim of this beer 's revitalization and it be a fad , but i would like to think i truly enjoy drink this beer for the right reason .<ssssss>i love drinking craft beer , but i have to be honest sometimes i crave a ice cold pabst .<ssssss>its just a easy drinking beer you can drink the night away with alongside old friend .<ssssss>

5 9 5 8 8		after a disastrous experience with the 2009 , time for another look at this .<ssssss>with a 2010 in hand , let 's see if we can improve the score from a `` d. '' appearance : espresso brown with just a tinge of brown highlight on the edge ; a thin layer of foam appear -lrb- a good sign -rrb- and some of it stick to the glass smell : bourbon fill chocolate , with more than a hint of blackstrap molasses taste : dark chocolate , up front , with licorice and the bourbon character take over by mid-palate , bring vanilla and oak ; after the swallow , the booze impact the profile just a bit too dramatically , although the chocolate , vanilla , licorice and molasses make a nice combination mouthfeel : full body with low carbonation ; lot of warmth on the gullet drinkability : while there be more carbonation in the 2010 than the 2009 , this show that tomme have a clear view about the carbonation level he want in he beer ; while i would like a bit more , i do not mind the lower level on this one as much as i do on the 2009 ; overall , characterize I as impressed - a bit too boozy and a bit too flat , but still a nice brew thanks , mrmile , for the chance to re-visit<ssssss>

6 7 4 5 6		cadillac mountain be not a bad beer , but it be really kind of a cookie-cutter stout .<ssssss>i guess my expectation be high after notice that it be bottle condition and have a dimple on the cap , suggest that it be hand-filled .<ssssss>certainly beat beer from different style , but you have to compare it against other high quality stout in the same price range , and it do not hold up too well .<ssssss>they certainly get the whole dark color thing well with a medium head and some lacing .<ssssss>the aroma be definitely the best part , plenty of mocha a roasted malt note .<ssssss>flavor be similar and quite sweet .<ssssss>i could really use some more hop in this one to balance out the sweetness .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be a little thin for a stout , and the alcohol be well mask .<ssssss>
6 8 7 6 6		pour a orange , cloudy color with minimal head .<ssssss>smell be overwhelmingly hop , with mostly citrus and some vegetable-like characteristic .<ssssss>taste be a blast of bitterness at the start with some vegetable flavor mix in and a sweet finish .<ssssss>think it be too sweet and that it do not blend well with the hop flavor .<ssssss>full-bodied and fairly drinkable .<ssssss>prefer 3f alpha king over this brew and think it be a much tastier and drinkable brew .<ssssss>
6 7 4 7 8		sample at broad ripple .<ssssss>the beer arrive a lighter shade of black -lrb- what -rrb- .<ssssss>more along the line of a schwartz .<ssssss>the server say that this beer a stout beer , but after the nose and taste , not even close .<ssssss>a light off-white to almost tan color head but limited retention and lacing .<ssssss>the nose be limited overall .<ssssss>some lighter malt note with a light hint of chocolate .<ssssss>some bready and a light nutty thing that mix oddly .<ssssss>some yeast note but mostly clean .<ssssss>some ester , a light plum and -lrb- do not laugh -rrb- horseradish .<ssssss>some minor wood pulp and alcohol but for the most part clean .<ssssss>the taste be a bit more descript .<ssssss>the malt come out a bit more with come caramel and light chocolate .<ssssss>some roast note and a touch of vanilla as well .<ssssss>finish a bit dry , would like to see some linger sweetness .<ssssss>there be a light molasses taste in the finish as well .<ssssss>the yeast be light as well .<ssssss>some generic yeast note and a light ester .<ssssss>would have like more depth for bd .<ssssss>the body be limit .<ssssss>a bit wispy and limited in the finish .<ssssss>the carbonation be limit as well .<ssssss>overall a beer that do not quite fit style , but overall would like a bit more depth .<ssssss>
8 6 9 9 8		this brew be brown in color with deep amber highlight .<ssssss>1/2 '' head .<ssssss>the aroma be disappointingly weak as a hint of malt be detectable .<ssssss>the flavor correct this with a huge malt presence , pair with caramel , raisin , prune , and a hint of whiskey .<ssssss>alcohol and nice bitterness level round this out .<ssssss>this be a medium / heavy beer .<ssssss>smooth at the start , mildy crisp onthe finish with the malt , alcohol , and whiskey tone last long on the tongue .<ssssss>nicely drinkable for this style .<ssssss>
5 4 6 7 4		this use to be one of my favorite until i venture out into other type of beer .<ssssss>it still demand attention because it be so widely available .<ssssss>appearance : though please with its medium brown color , its lack of carbonation make it seem stagnant .<ssssss>smell : hint of oak and a roasted scent .<ssssss>taste : smooth , but not crisp or engaging .<ssssss>linger taste of malt .<ssssss>mouthfeel : slightly chalky , but clean .<ssssss>drinkability : 1st glass or two be refreshing , but after that , it can become laborious leave behind a sticky dryness in one 's throat .<ssssss>overall , it be a descent beer , but there be far better brew on-tap in most bar .<ssssss>think of this beer as a palate cleanser .<ssssss>
4 3 4 6 5		just plain bad not a good beer false advertisement !<ssssss>i mean the taste suck its skunky leave a really bad aftertaste the only way to make this beer descent be add to salt and lime , even then its still hard to take down !<ssssss>i rather drink pacifico than this it have more of a smooth slight bitter taste to it than this awful if u want to call it beer<ssssss>
8 6 6 7 4		mainly amber , a little golden in color , nice frothy off white head .<ssssss>the aroma be very like a biscut and/or tea .<ssssss>you have to look for they , but there be some hop there , mainly floral , a little citrus .<ssssss>the taste be dominate by the malty caramel , biscut/tea flavor .<ssssss>as that fade some hop come to light .<ssssss>mostly they be perfumey and floral , but there be some musty and resinous flavor as well , and quite a bit of orange and citrus flavor as the beer go down .<ssssss>this beer be classify wrong on this site , it be most definitely a english style ipa .<ssssss>i be not the biggest fan , not enough hop , too much biscut and tea .<ssssss>but if you like the style , it be high quality .<ssssss>
5 6 4 6 6		probably one of new zealand 's most popular beer in america , steinlager be a average beer .<ssssss>the color , smell , and favor be nothing amazing .<ssssss>however some drinker -lrb- mostly those who be acustome to american beer -rrb- , will find this kiwi beer a bit rough on the taste bud .<ssssss>the favor of the beer be light but unique .<ssssss>i would recommend this beer as a something to try .<ssssss>try to find a friend who like the beer so you do not have to spend to much for the try .<ssssss>but do try .<ssssss>
9 6 7 8 6		beautiful amber brick red color nice head form and stay be dence and white its initial nose be sweet a pepper taste break through with a hoppyness it be well do but the pepper be almost offputting but better then i expect the taste to start be sweet and smooth as a slight earth hoppyness hit the carbonation build .<ssssss>there be a slight sweet flowery taste that break through before the pepper taste present itself .<ssssss>the pepper taste come through as the carbonation leave a slight numb feel on the tongue .<ssssss>the aftertase be like the sroma pepper be potent .<ssssss>this would be a great beer for cooking and the taste be good but pepper be difficult in the drinkability<ssssss>
8 7 8 6 8		i bougth a six-pack oof rise moon at a grocery , look for something to celebrate the spring season .<ssssss>it be early and this be one of the fiirst seasonal to hit the shelf .<ssssss>i pour the beer into a weizen glass .<ssssss>pour a deep gold color and be clear , with many bubble rise in the beer .<ssssss>a agressive pour prodiice a creamy thick head that be quite resilient .<ssssss>smell be bready , typical odf a wheat ale , with a soft acidic note .<ssssss>i would not say it be fruity , more like vinegar .<ssssss>taste be malty , a grain flavor , with the -lrb- lime -rrb- citrus flavor as well .<ssssss>mild bitterness , and a neutral aftertaste .<ssssss>the flaove of this beer definitely will not step on anything you be eat .<ssssss>mouthfeel be crisp and light , with moderate carbonation .<ssssss>a very drinkable brew .<ssssss>it be weakest point be flavor , but it be a appealing passive beer , that will not offend anyone .<ssssss>it be not great , but i would have it again .<ssssss>this brew would be good in the suummer as well as spring .<ssssss>
6 9 6 9 8		serve into a normal style pint glass from my starr hill growler -lrb- acquire at the brewery on 6/12/11 -rrb- .<ssssss>pour a thinnish , dark golden color with very little head .<ssssss>once it settle , it have a murky appearance which suit the smell/taste just fine .<ssssss>smell be delightful ... i can pick up what smell like hickory and bacon .<ssssss>taste be likewise delightful and it taste like it smell ... strong smoke flavor with hint of bacon .<ssssss>it really do taste like `` camping . ''<ssssss>mouthfeel be good , a bit thinnish with notable carbonation .<ssssss>do not hamper the taste at all , but not the highlight of the beer .<ssssss>starr hill have make a excellent and unique beer in its `` smoke out . ''<ssssss>it be very distinctive and unlike any other beer i have have in the mid-atlantic .<ssssss>it be not for everyone , but if you have a open mind it be definitely worth it .<ssssss>it pair well with food - i have a prior growler fill with hickory beef jerky which be a fantastic pairing and i imagine this would go well with all sort of hearty meat and potato type food .<ssssss>simply put , this be one of the highlight on starr hill 's roster of beer .<ssssss>
5 8 6 6 7		pour from 12oz bottle into pint glass appearance : cloudy , pale yellow in color , a medium size head dissapear quickly .<ssssss>wow , this beer provide alot of overcast , even from look down into the bottle you can tell the clarity level be at a low .<ssssss>smell : banana note shine here .<ssssss>a very fresh smell hefe compare to other .<ssssss>taste : again , the banana note play a huge part in the taste as well .<ssssss>this taste like a liquid banana split .<ssssss>lot of floral taste here , a weird tin-fruit taste kick in the end which be not so bad , but throw off the complexity of this beer .<ssssss>mouthfeel : low carbonation , pretty light on the palette , but still , that sulfur like aftertaste get kind of annoy after a while .<ssssss>drinability : this be no doubt drinkable , however , the bite in the end kind of turn I off , overexagerated banana taste make this one lose a couple point , but if you enjoy the taste , this be definetley a sessioanble brew .<ssssss>a good intention from long trail , but not they best effort .<ssssss>
7 6 9 7 8		left hand imperial stout -- & gt ; big stein .<ssssss>a - pour black .<ssssss>aggressive pour leave a bit of creamy tan head , that settle into a tiny cap on the beer .<ssssss>s - dark chocolate , some smoky roasted malt .<ssssss>t - alcoholic chocolate milkshake !<ssssss>lot and lot of chocolate in this one .<ssssss>a good bit of bourbon or maybe vodka booziness , which increase as the beer warm .<ssssss>some vanilla , coffee , more smoky roasted malt .<ssssss>just the tiniest bit of hop here and there .<ssssss>this be really sweet for a be .<ssssss>taste a lot like they milk stout , just stronger and heavier on the booze .<ssssss>m - pleasantly creamy and thick .<ssssss>carbonation be just right for the sweetness , it really fill out the palate .<ssssss>d - pretty high , but this be definitely on the sweet side .<ssssss>if you be not into sweet stout , than this will probably be a bit much .<ssssss>pretty decent be .<ssssss>not the greatest or most complex out there , but nice .<ssssss>very accessible for a big beer .<ssssss>
7 7 5 6 8		have enjoy the brewpub 's on-tap offering in the past , i be pleasantly surprise to see this in a bottle at jason 's -lrb- ellicott city -rrb- the other day .<ssssss>leave a bit to be desire , however , once i get it home and pour it in a glass .<ssssss>pale straw color , very thin and `` spritzy '' -lrb- best way to describe it -rrb- with a bready malt aroma and a mild hop flavor .<ssssss>extremely drinkable and refreshing in a `` lawn mower '' sort of way , but far from the local standard like `` penn pil . ''<ssssss>
7 4 6 6 5		this be my second go at a magic hat brew , i have to say i be a little disappointed , but it will not keep I from try more of they offering .<ssssss>my expectation be somewhat high , i guess .<ssssss>the look be medium amber , and clear .<ssssss>the first waft i receive be a sort of sour scent - i do not care for the smell .<ssssss>also , the carbonation be not as spunky as some traditional hefe weizen , which be apparently what magic hat be mimice here .<ssssss>the flavor sort of bite you tongue at first , then subside to a band-aid-ish flavor .<ssssss>the beer have a interesting finish , the best way i can describe it be -lrb- raisin bran ?<ssssss>! -rrb-<ssssss>i probably will not have this one again , but it be worth the try and definitely a unique beer .<ssssss>
8 6 7 8 6		have on tap at the chophouse/brewery just off time square .<ssssss>a : the menu say it be `` deep golden '' though it look decidedly more amber to I .<ssssss>whatever the color , it pour clear with a smallish head that hang around a while and leave rather impressive lace all the way down the glass .<ssssss>s : the brew smell strongly of apricot .<ssssss>so strongly , in fact , that upon return to my table and take my first whiff , i decide that the bartender must have make a mistake and give I the apricot ale .<ssssss>i return to the bar and get another glass which look and smell exactly like the first .<ssssss>t + m : i actually rather like the taste , though it be not what i be expect from a ipa .<ssssss>the aforementioned apricot be certainly present , especially in the initial taste , which be mostly hop -lrb- with a hint of citrus , and the apricot of course -rrb- .<ssssss>the hop bitterness be moderate , probably on the weak side for a ipa .<ssssss>the malt be rich and full , with a hint of toast grain , and be probably a little more than the hop can balance .<ssssss>the brew finish clean and very dry .<ssssss>aftertaste be all malt -lrb- no apricot -rrb- .<ssssss>d : the taste , while a little jarring at first , be probably something i could get use to .<ssssss>it be pretty fill however .<ssssss>overall : i could see how people who really love this style might take issue with this brew .<ssssss>while not a orthodox ipa , it be , none the less , a solid , creative brew , which certainly bear look into if you be in the area .<ssssss>
8 9 6 8 8		pour with a nice foamy , frothy , somewhat thick , light tan head taht mostly last and a little lace .<ssssss>color be a very nice clear dark cherry .<ssssss>nose be super nice : dark , toasty , roasty malt , a little cocoa , toffee , and the barest hint of dark , ripe fruit .<ssssss>flavor be like aroma but sweetness come out a bit more , but just barely .<ssssss>subtlely delicious .<ssssss>body be ok and carbonation be maybe just a bit fizzy .<ssssss>finish be like flavor and slowly taper to a medium to long duration .<ssssss>session .<ssssss>
8 4 6 5 5		surprisingly , i find this beer at smitty 's in the tiny town of lake park , ga just off i-75 .<ssssss>i have never see this brew before , but at $ 6.99 a sixpack i figure i do not have a whole lot to lose when buy this utica , ny brew .<ssssss>this beer will never make a ipa-lover 's favorite list , but still it be not all that bad .<ssssss>it be not a great brew at all , but it be acceptable for the style , and i have certainly have a lot worse .<ssssss>there be a mild earthy hop aroma and flavor along with a light maltiness and hop bitterness .<ssssss>for the price , you could do much worse .<ssssss>will i buy this again ?<ssssss>probably not ... but it be not a drain-pour either ... and it be better than a macro beer and some other -lrb- more expensive -rrb- micro i have have .<ssssss>
8 9 6 9 8		i love the unique st peter bottle ; i feel like im medicate myself .<ssssss>anyway , this pour a nicely active bright orange brew with just a thin veil of white bubble .<ssssss>the lightly hoppy aroma be nice ... summer-time flower .<ssssss>the first swallow be sharply bitter , much starker than a american ipa .<ssssss>this be woody and tangy more than the citric fruitiness we yank have come to expect from a beer label ipa , unfairly .<ssssss>with a solid malt undertow and a nicely balanced bitterness , i feel this be a very under-rated offering .<ssssss>quite good in my book .<ssssss>-lrb- # 2688 , 2/6/2007 -rrb-<ssssss>
8 7 6 5 9		draft .<ssssss>a : pour a dark mahogany with a medium-sized tan head .<ssssss>s : fairly weak for such a big beer ; roasted malt , a bit of chocolate and nuttiness t : coffee really come through ; a bit of diacetyl ; also a touch of deep malt sweetness and roasted flavor m : watery ; leave a oily , almost greasy coating on the tongue d : great ; but for a beer with such a underwhelming mouthfeel , not what i want or expect probably not my favorite .<ssssss>there be definitely worse aba out there , but there be also many better option .<ssssss>
8 6 9 6 6		best before aug 09 notch on side of label .<ssssss>pour a hazy golden peach with suspend yeast visible .<ssssss>the bright white dense head sit 1/2 '' after settle a while .<ssssss>nice ring of lace all the way down .<ssssss>this thing smell of blackberry from 2 ft. away once i pop the cap .<ssssss>the chalice be sit on my desk 3 ft. away and i still can smell the dark fruit .<ssssss>this thing be all about the blackberry ; sweet and a tad sour .<ssssss>the flavor of the blackberry be not as sweet as i be anticipate from the smell .<ssssss>as a matter of -lrb- fact/opinion -rrb- the blackberry flavor dissipate a few seconds after the swallow .<ssssss>a salty flavor creep up way in the back of the throat midway through my 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle .<ssssss>a very strange combination of sweet smell , with a tad bit of sourness with a salty finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel be great .<ssssss>fine playful carbonation keep the airy and light/medium body move .<ssssss>drinkability be ok .<ssssss>i would opt to grab a different selection due to the salty linger finish .<ssssss>this be a well-crafter brew of which i commend the unique quality i have mention above .<ssssss>i be certain fruity beer lover will gravitate toward this during hot summer day .<ssssss>i will stay away though .<ssssss>

9 9 8 9 6		pour a robust red into a snifter with very little head .<ssssss>smell like a tart cherry and little else besides .<ssssss>the cherry odor be rather light and orchard like , however .<ssssss>the taste be of tart cherry .<ssssss>there be definitely a bit of pucker to this drink with a very dry aftertaste , almost like wine .<ssssss>it taste remarkably like a real cherry , which to my taste be delightful .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be not too syrupy or sweet .<ssssss>i like this beer a lot , but i would not drink more than one at a time .<ssssss>i would love to try this with some fresh fruit or a suitable dessert .<ssssss>
8 9 10 9 8		a : black as oil top with a mocha color head .<ssssss>the lace have little retention , and make its way down the glass with each sip .<ssssss>s : burnt toffee , mocha , caramel , malt , a little yeast note , and , as with most ri , a linger alcohol aroma that become more present as the beer warm .<ssssss>t : out of this world .<ssssss>coffee be present on the front of the palate , which then expand , bring out the mocha and sweet raisin flavor , ease one into the warming alcohol .<ssssss>mf/d : a little bit thin for a ris , i still give this beer a 5 on the mf aspect because it really be one of the smoothest , most well round stout i have have the pleasure of enjoy .<ssssss>a four pack of these bad boy on a cold night and you be set .<ssssss>
9 8 5 4 4		this be not a beer for I .<ssssss>disappointed , as i be a avid stone fan and this be my first opportunity with the levitation ale .<ssssss>while the prose be sweet as ever , the brew itself be exceedingly oppressive , strongly hop -- i would hand down prefer ruination to levitation when it come to high hop from stone .<ssssss>a pleasingly aesthetic amber red in a glass , this one just do not have it in flavor to warrant another buy from I anytime soon .<ssssss>
7 5 7 7 8		bottle say `` ale obolon lager '' several time .<ssssss>what do that mean ?<ssssss>i guess they could use both ale and lager yeast .<ssssss>or they use ale as a synonym for beer .<ssssss>either way that sound very wrong to I .<ssssss>not only my first ukrainian beer , but also my first ale-lager .<ssssss>also beeradvocate.com say 5.2 % a.b.v .<ssssss>and my bottle state 5.0 % a.b.v .<ssssss>-lrb- it also say 12 % of the back label for some reason . -rrb-<ssssss>anyway : 500ml bottle be highly carbonated , almost a gusher .<ssssss>smell mostly of lager yeast .<ssssss>not bad , just incredibly faint in odor .<ssssss>slightly darker than a normal mass produce lager .<ssssss>very clear though .<ssssss>head look nice , but it seem to have head retention issue .<ssssss>pretty good taste .<ssssss>noticeable bitterness .<ssssss>crisp finish .<ssssss>refreshing .<ssssss>slightly thin for my taste .<ssssss>definitely pretty good though .<ssssss>nothing out of this world .<ssssss>but a good summer beverage , for one of those way too hot day .<ssssss>
9 10 8 10 7		i be not a big fan of ipa but i have taste quite a few and pliny the elder be arguably the definitive ipa .<ssssss>the hop aroma be incredible - like my nose be bury in a double handful of fresh hop .<ssssss>the appearance be typical for a ipa - a nice golden color with a slight cloudiness .<ssssss>the taste be exceptional with a distinctly fresh hop bitterness that linger .<ssssss>the only downside for I be the extreme hoppiness that prevent I from want to drink another glass .<ssssss>for what be describe as a double ipa i would expect a little more malt flavor to come through and help balance out the fresh hop bitterness .<ssssss>
9 8 5 7 7		serve in a tulip glass from the most recent incarnation of this beer -lrb- in 12oz format -rrb- .<ssssss>this beer pour a absolutely gorgeous blackness with a darker tan foam that hang around quite well .<ssssss>the aroma have much the property of whiskey .<ssssss>add behind that be perhaps some dark fruit and dark chocolate with touch of vanilla and coffee .<ssssss>the taste be truly dominate by the whiskey with a touch of anise in the background .<ssssss>this puppy burn while go down .<ssssss>i feel that this beer be quite flammable and that scare I .<ssssss>this should have sit for so much longer to make this go away .<ssssss>i feel that there be a tasty beer down beneath this but i can not get over the hotness of this .<ssssss>it be way too fresh and i warn away from those look to try it just for the hell of it .<ssssss>this need to be cellare .<ssssss>after that i may revisit this , but until then it be hard to swallow .<ssssss>
6 6 8 6 7		i grab this because i would never have a beer from hawaii before .<ssssss>start off pour a meager 1/8 '' off-white head which vanish immediately .<ssssss>very little smell at first , only some mild malt , and not much more even after warm .<ssssss>appearance be a slightly haze copper or apricot color .<ssssss>taste , although alright , be only marginally more than a bmc to I .<ssssss>grant it have more body than bmc .<ssssss>anyway , it be a plenty drinkable beer , and it be cool it be from hawaius , but otherwise i do not really see anything exceptional to it .<ssssss>
7 4 7 6 7		pour opaque brown with translucency around the edge with around 1 finger of head that dissipate to leave a foamy ring .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>nose be almost nonexistent , deep breath bring about tiny amount of coffee note .<ssssss>taste be slightly toasty and coffee-y , not very complex but also not bad .<ssssss>mouthfeel be pretty good , actually , it be not too thin or dense .<ssssss>another easy drinker by real ale .<ssssss>

6 4 5 6 6		12 oz .<ssssss>bottle in a pint glass .<ssssss>a - definitely black , though in the light , it be a little more dark brown on the edge .<ssssss>the head be substantial , but disappear quickly .<ssssss>s - honestly , it do not have as stromg aroma .<ssssss>i be a novice , but it do not hit I .<ssssss>t - smoky , not bitter at all .<ssssss>there be a fleeting aftertaste that be sort of bitter .<ssssss>there be no sweetness at all .<ssssss>m - very light and too much carbonation for my taste .<ssssss>d - it be almost a session beer .<ssssss>it be average to I .<ssssss>
8 7 9 8 6		appearance - opaque black body with a tight chocolate/mocha head that stick around .<ssssss>smell - sweet chocolate and roasted malt dominate .<ssssss>slight alcohol and light hop in the finish .<ssssss>taste - very chocolatey brew .<ssssss>sweet milk chocolate up front with ripe fruit with a alcoholic , bitter dark chocolate finish .<ssssss>fairly dry finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel - medium to heavy body with a amazing creaminess .<ssssss>carbonation be light and prickly .<ssssss>fantastic .<ssssss>drinkability - fantastic brew , but too rich and too much alcohol .<ssssss>
7 6 6 8 7		drink from my stella tulip .<ssssss>a - pour a deep mahogany colour , but light be still present through the glass .<ssssss>the head be tan and reduce slowly to a film .<ssssss>s - classic roasted malt from the bottle .<ssssss>much sweeter malt once pour and maybe a little cocoa .<ssssss>t - the start be little bitter , before some roasted malt kick in , a very nice sticky toffee finish that be compliment well by some residual sweetness and malt .<ssssss>m - not full body but and a little over carbonate .<ssssss>o - a decent suprise brew and the toffe be the highlight , would have like to have see a bit more body in this .<ssssss>
7 8 6 5 7		this pour a closer to copper than gold , surprising in a pilsner .<ssssss>a moderate pour earn a small but sturdy white head , which fade quick .<ssssss>the smell be darker than most pil , with some fruit or fresh bread in the nose .<ssssss>it also smell musty , though not in a bad way , just rather damp .<ssssss>taste be a letdown after such a good nose , as it be like a diluted pilsner .<ssssss>the sensation be similar to how you 4th or 5th beer of the night taste - the familiar taste be there , just very subdue and fade quickly .<ssssss>as it warm , it begin to taste sweet and grainy , almost like a malt liquor .<ssssss>mouthfeel be thin and slippery , not very substantial .<ssssss>drinkability be a bit of a redeeming factor ; the light flavor would let this beer start , continue or finish you evening with no trouble .<ssssss>still , i do not think i would have more than one in a row , and i would not rebuy this beer .<ssssss>
10 7 9 6 7		bottle purchase at andrew hilton wine in lethbridge , ab .<ssssss>serve in a hotel tumbler .<ssssss>bottled november 23rd , 2010 .<ssssss>a - pour with a ample off-white foam that slowly settle to a chunky cap , leave splotchy intricate lace pattern .<ssssss>body be a transparent pale bronze with some stream of bubble rise upward .<ssssss>not sure what else you would want from this style .<ssssss>s - unfortunately hop be largely go from the aroma at this stage .<ssssss>- there be some residual earthy and mossy note mingle with a sugary malt backdrop .<ssssss>not much citrus here , although that be what i get for drink a six month old dipa .<ssssss>t - taste have sugary icing-like malt mix with a bready note , and some residual hop bitterness .<ssssss>there be also a buttery and slightly oxidize note mid-palate that be somewhat unpleasant .<ssssss>m - smooth , clean texture , medium-bodied , with surprisingly low carbonation .<ssssss>some residual oiliness and very little alcohol warmth .<ssssss>quite pleasant in a cask-like kind of way .<ssssss>d - wish i would have this fresh , as i tend to really like centennial hop .<ssssss>somewhere in the middle of the single hop series in my opinion .<ssssss>the 500ml bottle seem a bit excessive for one person , but insufficient for two .<ssssss>
7 6 8 9 8		replace the amateurish review i write on 06/03/2007 : pour a grainy , thin yellow with minimal lacing and moderate carbonation .<ssssss>nearly translucent when hold to light .<ssssss>butter , grain and corn be the most prevalent scent on display , follow by hint of sweetness and a bit of alcohol .<ssssss>this be a more entice twist on the `` usual '' beer smell .<ssssss>the taste be a please blend of buttered biscuit , slight hop , a little spice and mild dryness .<ssssss>there be no skunkiness or bitterness on display , which i think be the downfall of most american lager .<ssssss>there be also the tingle of carbonation , which act a nice counterpoint to the smooth and buttery mouthfeel .<ssssss>you just can not deny how easy this be to drink .<ssssss>it might be one of the most drinkable beer on the planet and it have definitely provoke a interest in the style .<ssssss>
7 9 7 7 8		pour a pale gold colour with a saffron tinge .<ssssss>head be modest , with off-white hue , sink to a thin film and leave a few light trail of lace .<ssssss>slow bead and light cloud in the body .<ssssss>look alright , nothing particularly special .<ssssss>smell be lovely and sweet with a great fresh hoppy edge .<ssssss>very cakey malt with caramel and a lot of citrus tang and pineapple .<ssssss>orange/lemon zest in mild intensity , but lot of it .<ssssss>very appealing aroma indeed .<ssssss>taste be slightly disappointing after that .<ssssss>fair cake batter malt on the front , with nice fresh hop back up immediately on the mid , give citrus and some rubber note .<ssssss>bitterness start midway and be a bit dour , lack in the freshness suggest by the nose .<ssssss>definite rubbery edge with some soil note and pine resin as well .<ssssss>also feel a bit un-nuanced , so it just sort of fall flat , almost like a deflate hop flavour give dull , blunt bitterness without a lot of complexity .<ssssss>for its flaw though , not bad .<ssssss>it do not help that the texture be a bit thin overall .<ssssss>pick up towards the end with a gently massage fizz , but not enough for I to forget the thinness .<ssssss>pretty good drinking beer , but could have be better .<ssssss>

7 3 8 5 4		the label art set too high a plateau for the beer , but you might as well open up the bottle before it get too warm .<ssssss>greasy tar ; very fluid for the style .<ssssss>a tiny brown head develop about 20 seconds after the pour be do .<ssssss>black as asphalt , & just as noxious .<ssssss>penetrate coffee grounds & pungent hop , a bit of a cigar stench ; fumy alcohol .<ssssss>my head hurt .<ssssss>invigorating carbonation , & a thin body .<ssssss>hop be in everything .<ssssss>this be a dirty ipa with too much miss , too much of what you do not want .<ssssss>burnt compost , & stale jerky ; just lovely .<ssssss>: -lrb-<ssssss>
9 7 5 6 8		sweet for a stout , but never have a cream stout ... the head be white ?<ssssss>not chocolatey like most stout thik , rich and full of flavor asome not to malty of a taste to it the taste i get of it be more of the alcohol that hit I then the flavore good but not the best<ssssss>
7 9 5 8 8		fairly luxurious head over a deep mahogany very grainy pilsner malt aroma .<ssssss>lovely floral hop .<ssssss>dry , roasted smell very subtle palette of flavor : excellent hop presence , toffee malt , narrow range of yeasty fruitiness .<ssssss>some tartness and a distinct nutty flavor -lrb- partly hop flavor , partly roast -rrb- .<ssssss>mouthfeel be weak i would say the hop contribution be beyond what be call for in a dubbel .<ssssss>but who , in the end , really give a damn ... as long as the beer be good , right ?<ssssss>-lrb- i will admit that i judge more harshly against off-style beer that be average or less -rrb-<ssssss>
10 8 9 10 8		thanks to floydster for this share at the belgianfest at the carlsbad pizza port .<ssssss>i have a generous 3oz pour .<ssssss>this beer be another one i have be want to taste for awhile and it be way cool .<ssssss>strong alcohol nose so i let it air out a little .<ssssss>first sip be a experience and the vanilla jump right out with a strong alcohol burn that quickly diminish with another sip.so if you take a creamy vanilla flavor and add some cocoa and some oxidation with and alcohol burn of 29 % you get the picture .<ssssss>most like a utopia .<ssssss>thanks again to kyle aka floydster for this generous share .<ssssss>also seaoflament and rallison who be there as well !<ssssss>awesome thanx !<ssssss>ha i remember post on here for this and people say i would never get to even taste it ... face ... .<ssssss>thanks kyle !<ssssss>
5 8 7 10 6		12oz bottle into a snifter .<ssssss>courtesy of thedominator -lrb- thank you ! -rrb-<ssssss>.<ssssss>a - very hazy , dark amber .<ssssss>not much in the way of head , and just hint of patchy lacing on the glass .<ssssss>s - the bourbon make itself know immediately , remind I of kb in all the right way .<ssssss>some smokiness , along with brown sugar and vanilla .<ssssss>t - lot of toffee and caramel , a bit of char , and more hoppiness than i would have expect .<ssssss>the barrel be not as assertive as in the nose , mainly bring smoky vanilla and oaky note as well as the bourbon .<ssssss>very pleasant ; maybe the best scotch ale i have have to date .<ssssss>m - thick and chewy , with a somewhat short , dry finish .<ssssss>d - i really enjoy the flavor , but for the style , its high abv hurt it a bit and i can see where the heavy bourbon may wear after a few serving .<ssssss>o - it be not a standard scotch ale , but it be a excellent beer that be better than the score indicate .<ssssss>i would buy it again if it be available here .<ssssss>
6 5 8 4 4		12 oz bottle , no date note .<ssssss>pour a very lightly haze pale peach gold color .<ssssss>carbonation appear light so i pour a little harder and manage to raise a decent head , however it appear i use most of the dissolve carb to do so .<ssssss>the up-front hoppy aroma be pleasant , and relatively strong .<ssssss>very light alcohol behind .<ssssss>however there be a sweet malt aroma that seem out of place , and as it warm a light diacetyl become distressingly strong .<ssssss>overall , good strong hop , but clean it up a bit - perhaps it be just the yeast strain or the fermentation temperature .<ssssss>ever use some of that bitter spray that keep you dog from chew on stuff ?<ssssss>ever accidentally get it on you hand and later in you mouth ?<ssssss>yeah , it be kind of like that .<ssssss>the malt flavor be light and a improvement over the aroma .<ssssss>diacetyl be noticeable but not a distraction unlike the aroma .<ssssss>what hop flavor be there be herbal and sharp .<ssssss>however the super bitter medicinal/hair spray flavor bring to mind metal , chemical , and extract .<ssssss>no linger malt flavor , just intense bitterness and a light metallic edge .<ssssss>body be medium light , relatively clean .<ssssss>carb as mention be a bit low .<ssssss>drinkability would be better than decent with a few tweak but as it be currently , i will be find someone i do not care for all that much to pawn the rest of this six-pack off onto .<ssssss>
7 7 7 8 4		chill 12oz bottle into a glass .<ssssss>purchase from whole food in lo alto .<ssssss>a : pour a very cloudy orange-amber color with a inch of fluffy , off-white head .<ssssss>it take a few minute to vanish , and it fall back into a light collar on the brew , but it leave substantial lace with register mark down the glass .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>s : citrus -lrb- orange , tangerine -rrb- and pine hop , with a small floral component .<ssssss>have trouble smell anything else .<ssssss>seem like a hop bomb .<ssssss>t : the taste be more balanced , though .<ssssss>again , lot of citrus in orange and tangerine flavor , with a lighter pine component .<ssssss>but there be a very balanced caramel malt and maybe some bread in there .<ssssss>i get a little floral taste before the finish .<ssssss>very clean flavor .<ssssss>have a slightly dry finish that leave some grass in the aftertaste .<ssssss>m : medium-bodied , with medium carbonation .<ssssss>no oiliness , but a slight aftertaste and some light stickiness .<ssssss>well-masked abv .<ssssss>d : this be a go-to beer for I for a while , although my initial infatuation fade as i try more ipa .<ssssss>i like it , but its latest pricing , from $ 8 to a sixer jump to $ 16 a sixer , have pretty much prevent I from get it again .<ssssss>
7 8 8 6 7		on tap at the bottle release .<ssssss>a : pour black with some whispy light brown lace .<ssssss>look very creamy for be such a still - low carb stout .<ssssss>s : the smell be comprise of dark bitter chocolate with some mint in the background .<ssssss>seem to have the aphrodite nuttiness in full effect along with a bit of spice .<ssssss>t : the dark bitter chocolate and sharp tasting mint battle each other for attention .<ssssss>the flavor kind of muddle together and seem harsh at time .<ssssss>the base stout show well but i would not say the two addition to this really help .<ssssss>the mint linger along with some dark roasted malt and a touch of bitterness .<ssssss>m : nice body and creamy mouthfeel next to it be ooa counterpart cousin .<ssssss>o : this be not bad , it grow on I slightly as it warm .<ssssss>overall i be hope for something a little more smooth and seamless from this variant .<ssssss>i would say this be my least favorite treatment out of the lot ; it have some stiff competition though .<ssssss>
8 6 6 9 6		this example be a 03 that i have age about 2 year .<ssssss>serve in a tulip glass .<ssssss>appearance be a super dark copper orange .<ssssss>absolutely no head to speak of .<ssssss>just a mild foam during the pour which be go almost immediately .<ssssss>smell be sweet .<ssssss>raisin like , malty with a hint of soy sauce taste be sweet dry fruit up front .<ssssss>raisin and fig .<ssssss>this give way to a intense piney hoppy bitterness .<ssssss>big citrus rind flavor that curl you lip .<ssssss>some hot alcohol vapor on the exhale .<ssssss>mouthfeel be heavy .<ssssss>slight carbonation .<ssssss>thick .<ssssss>drinkability be a hard one .<ssssss>i love the taste , but at over 11 % not easy to give a high rating .<ssssss>overall a intense barley wine .<ssssss>in my opinion not quite as accessible as say a big foot .<ssssss>but , definitely more extreme .<ssssss>
7 8 6 5 6		i personally could not get over the aftertaste .<ssssss>pour a thin dark brown , almost black , w / nice head and leave no lacing at all .<ssssss>the smell be the highlight for I , which be loaded w / chocolate and coffee , this really get I excited !<ssssss>the taste match , but leave a aftertaste i can not put my finger on , and just ruin this experience .<ssssss>it be also very thin and over carbonate , imo , which do not make it too drinkable .<ssssss>this be not a bad beer at all , i just be not digging it and i really want to .<ssssss>
10 8 6 7 8		a - dark golden , two finger dark white head , thin soapy bubble , rich deep color , tiny visible bubble .<ssssss>very attractive beer , darker and i like that .<ssssss>s - crisp clear metallic note , sweet and sour aroma , lemon , slight citrus smell , and a of sort ham-and-bean smell .<ssssss>good , not great , unique let 's say .<ssssss>t - initial taste be metallic and sour , follow by a herbal creaminess , finish on dry lemon tartness which i really like .<ssssss>a different yeast character , the unmistakable sourness of this beer .<ssssss>not bad , different .<ssssss>weaker taste , i feel they could make this taste match the bold look .<ssssss>also , too much metal taste .<ssssss>m - light body , thinner consistency , too much carbonation .<ssssss>d - good , a solid import wheat .<ssssss>a change up from the usual hefe , if you feel like shake thing up a bit .<ssssss>
5 8 7 6 6		share of bottle of this one @ bishop arm - karlstad with my good friend ljunkan .<ssssss>the second beer i have try from ommegang , but i be not very impressed by this one .<ssssss>the bottle look pretty mediocre , but the beer in the glass look pretty nice though , hazy yellow with a large white foam .<ssssss>smell nicely of some sort of spice , citrus fruit and some nice hoppiness .<ssssss>smell be really nice !<ssssss>taste be slightly sour with lot of spiciness and some citrusfruit .<ssssss>fell quite mediocre in the taste though , but still good .<ssssss>all and all , a pretty good beer , but i do not think i want to try it again .<ssssss>there be beer in this style that be so much better .<ssssss>
9 9 10 8 8		12 oz .<ssssss>bottle , a : amber color ale , with thick , white head with excellent lacing .<ssssss>s : hop , hop , hop , this stuff will give you pine , grapefruit , orange , lemon , and a bit of lime and cilantro .<ssssss>t : very good , grapefruit and pine upfront , balanced by delicious bready malt and alcohol , yum 's the word .<ssssss>m : outstanding , deliciously creamy , thick , rich for a ipa .<ssssss>d : great , you would not know it be a big beer .<ssssss>i remember first have this after buy a bottle at the lee vine mobil on the u.s. 395 and can - 120 cross , attract to the label , think it be some kind of local speciality , at this point know almost nothing about beer .<ssssss>it blow I away with a enormous , full bitterness , the likes of which i have never taste .<ssssss>now that i be more adept at tasting and drinking ipa , and 2ipa , i get a lot more nuance and character that be not there before .<ssssss>this be a world-class ipa , great job to mr. koch and all he ilk down at the stone brewery , i just love this stuff .<ssssss>
5 4 7 8 7		cool bottle , if nothing else .<ssssss>brown , but the label be pretty cool .<ssssss>first beer brew after prohibition ... but what about yeungling ?<ssssss>anyway , beer pour out a crisp , pale yellow with a big , foamy white head -lrb- like soap bubble -rrb- that quickly reduce and do offer a spot or two of lacing .<ssssss>a thin ring of white remains after head go away .<ssssss>not much to the nose .<ssssss>some grain , a touch of grass , some vegetable sense to it .<ssssss>that be all .<ssssss>flavor , though , impressed I .<ssssss>a pilsner with some flavor .<ssssss>hallelujah .<ssssss>for that reason alone , it should get 5 .<ssssss>flavor be mildly grainy at first then a actual kiss of hop come through , carry a grassy , vegetabley sense to it .<ssssss>finish be crisp and clean .<ssssss>very nice .<ssssss>mouthfeel be somewhat thin and watery , but not bad consider .<ssssss>a touch bubbly on my tongue .<ssssss>as far as pilsner go , i would take this one again in a heartbeat .<ssssss>
8 8 10 9 7		pour into a southern tier tulip a - pitch black with very little head .<ssssss>any light penetration make it dark brown .<ssssss>s - i smell a lot of alcohol , but it still take a back seat to the chocolate and bitter coffee smell and dark fruit that dominate the brew t - very smooth and velvet-y , chocolate malt and roastiness up front , with vague alcohol and then some hop and coffee bitterness , then finally some sweetness and some dark fruit flavor .<ssssss>note - this would do well with age and would probably develop into a world class brew .<ssssss>now it be a bit too hot but very nice and complex while still be quite smooth .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 9		receive in trade with beerengineer89 - thanks a lot , t !<ssssss>pour from can into pint glass .<ssssss>date 8/18/11 a - pour very dark for a ipa .<ssssss>copper in color .<ssssss>nice big tan head develop with a rather tame pour .<ssssss>great retention .<ssssss>little visible carbonation .<ssssss>s - wow .<ssssss>that be beautiful .<ssssss>it be subtle , but intense at the same time .<ssssss>fresh tropical citrus , pineapple be a star of the show .<ssssss>a shallow pine aroma be present .<ssssss>plenty of malt sweetness in the background , with caramel present .<ssssss>t - first come plenty of pineapple , with pine and some malt sweetness to follow .<ssssss>incredibly well balanced .<ssssss>not at all too bitter .<ssssss>leave the mouth with a clean caramel sweetness accent by a touch of bitter hop .<ssssss>m - smooth as silk .<ssssss>medium body .<ssssss>so velvety smooth , it slide down the throat and leave just the tiniest hint of a flare of carbonation at the tail end .<ssssss>what a incredible feel .<ssssss>o - overall this be really quite fantastic .<ssssss>i be very glad to have two can in my possession .<ssssss>at two month old i be a touch worry about the hop , but they still show up in drove .<ssssss>i think the shipping may have futz with the carbonation , though -- it drink like a hand-pulled cask ale .<ssssss>edit : peruse some other review i fear the hop may have fade a touch in this can .<ssssss>i do not consider this to have much of a grassy character to speak of .<ssssss>
6 10 4 10 8		have this on the debut party at the brewery .<ssssss>very rich malty aroma and seem to pour red .<ssssss>but it be hard to tell as it be in a red plastic cup the aroma and first sip be similar with big malt and flavor , but on the end it just drop off with no aftertase or not much remain on the palate .<ssssss>good beer just fall a little short at the end<ssssss>
7 4 7 6 5		pour from a 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle into a tulip pint glass .<ssssss>a : clear , light amber color with over one finger of diminish off-white foam head .<ssssss>light lacing remain on the glass .<ssssss>s : airy toast be dilute by the thick carbon dioxide presence .<ssssss>hop be weakly piney , not really able to register .<ssssss>t : begin dry , with moderate pale malt that definitely bring more toast than in the smell , as well as some caramel .<ssssss>carbonic acidity be fairly aggressive toward the middle , largely block any hop aromatic that might otherwise develop .<ssssss>there be a thread of medium roast that inject some interest back into the flavor during the middle while ester be also detect .<ssssss>the finish be mildly grainy and herbaceous , with faint bitterness that do not linger .<ssssss>m : thin to medium viscosity , slightly acidic on the palate , with moderate carbonation .<ssssss>d/o : basically a forgettable contribution to the style , this pale ale apologize at every opportunity with the hope that no one will find it unappealing -- and cut corner in the process .<ssssss>hop could be describe as ghost-like here , if only there be some actually haunt this beer .<ssssss>the most surprising thing about this beer be that it be allow on the menu at beachwood bbq .<ssssss>
4 9 10 9 6		500ml bottle into a snifter .<ssssss>a - not like most stout , it be more on the deep brown side , with reddish edge when hold to the light .<ssssss>not much in the way of head , just a thin cap , and no lacing .<ssssss>s - no surprise here , plenty of bourbon in the nose .<ssssss>underneath that be the usual note that you would get from old raspy ; some chocolate , toffee , and vanilla .<ssssss>not much in the way of any aroma from the wood itself .<ssssss>t - well , this be pretty damned nice .<ssssss>i certainly enjoy bourbon note in beer , and this one do not let I down .<ssssss>some of the same note from the nose : dark chocolate cake , biscuit , toffee and vanilla , and the earthiness that i usually get from the base beer .<ssssss>the year that this have sit have apparently benefit this beer .<ssssss>the heat have die down a bit , make this a much more subtle beer .<ssssss>m - very smooth and velvety , with great carbonation .<ssssss>feel great go down .<ssssss>d - drinkable ?<ssssss>not so much .<ssssss>while it taste and feel great , it be very strong and it take I a while to finish the bottle .<ssssss>i would love to taste it more , but the abv get in the way .<ssssss>o - i have read some less-than-stellar review of this one when it be pretty fresh , so i be glad i lay mine down for a while .<ssssss>i like to think that be the reason that i have a better experience than some .<ssssss>be it worth the price of four 4-pack of the base beer ?<ssssss>probably not .<ssssss>not sure if i would buy a few more , give the price , but i might grab another to hold onto and see where it go .<ssssss>
9 9 6 8 8		it pour a cloudy dark orange with a one finger head .<ssssss>the smell be strong with hop and grapefruit .<ssssss>mouth feel be thick and slightly oily .<ssssss>taste start off with the immediate rush of hop and grapefruit follow by the presence of alcohol which linger .<ssssss>tasty beer over all .<ssssss>definately worth pick up and try .<ssssss>
8 6 9 6 8		accord eric warner 's classic definition , a kolsch should exhibit a subtle blend of soft maltiness , a smooth body , and a gentle hop bitterness and aroma .<ssssss>however , if i take a blindfold test of gaffel 's kolsch i would swear that i be drink a bavarian helle .<ssssss>by appearance , gaffel 's offering look promising ; it be clear and bright - a very pale blonde color with no chill haze .<ssssss>the head be not rocky , but be make up of tiny bubble , which indicate plenty of dextrin .<ssssss>however , the beer go downhill with the aroma .<ssssss>it be not that the smell be bad .<ssssss>there just be not any aroma save a faint whiff of malt .<ssssss>kolsch should exhibit a upfront aroma of hop in the nose .<ssssss>upon tasting gaffel 's kolsch , a rather sticky malt sweetness dominate this beer .<ssssss>the body be full like a helle and the carbonation keep it from be cloying .<ssssss>but the taste of malt and toffee remain in the finish .<ssssss>the beer obviously be not as well attenuate as it should be , as the finish be too sweet .<ssssss>the few drought kolsch 's i have when live in germany be well attenuate , with a firm malt base but they have a up front bitterness and dry finish that set they apart from helle or export .<ssssss>one or two even have such a up front noble hop aroma that be similar to a english bitter .<ssssss>gaffel 's beer may be a nice helle , but a kolsch it be not .<ssssss>i detract accordingly .<ssssss>
7 6 6 8 6		1/30/2010 : wow ... this have the distinction of be one of the 10 weirdest beer i have ever have ... and , it be easily the most alcoholic beer i have ever enjoy , clock in at about 19.5 % !<ssssss>!<ssssss>!<ssssss>on the nose , this smell like a sweet belgian tripel , but on the palate it be surprisingly smooth , and it do not taste alcoholic either !<ssssss>strike I as be somewhat similar to a tawny port .<ssssss>taste like it would age quite fabulously .<ssssss>i like this quite a bit , and consider it a real treat that fellow ct ` er , finger , provide the opportunity to try such a unique beer .<ssssss>
9 4 7 6 8		well it be not black but it be pretty close .<ssssss>dark chocolate brown with a light tan head .<ssssss>it be pretty good look pour in the recommend flute -lrb- well not quite a flute , but a tall skinny ommegang glass -rrb- .<ssssss>it be practically scentless .<ssssss>taste be definitely more lager-esque than i expect .<ssssss>there really be not any roasty , toastiness from the malt in this one .<ssssss>it be a bit on the sweet side .<ssssss>light body .<ssssss>pretty drinkable actually , but its so ambiguous i do not know what to think .<ssssss>not sure if the taste/look mismatch be in my head or if i have be drink too many stout but i can not get around the fact this one do not look like it taste .<ssssss>it certainly be not bad , so i can not fault it for that .<ssssss>
7 10 7 8 7		appearance - yellowish orange clear beer with nice head and retention smell - a superb scent !<ssssss>hop scream out of the glass pine and citrus !<ssssss>taste - very flavorful and very hoppy but not too bitter .<ssssss>mouthfeel - full body and nice overall - a very nice american ipa that be flavorful yet fairly easy on the pallet .<ssssss>
7 8 5 8 9		after be in portugal for several day without any hint of anything other than basic golden lager , i be pleasantly surprise to find this at a local grocer .<ssssss>still somewhat nervous from my experience thus far , i only buy one .<ssssss>when i open it , i be happy to catch a big roasty smell with some caramel undertone .<ssssss>i pour it in my glass and enjoy the deep , dark amber almost-brown color , with a nice light tan head that leave a fair amount of lacing .<ssssss>upon drinking , i be blow away to taste rich , roasted malt and toffee , with hint of coffee !<ssssss>i have be just about ready to give up on my beer tasting while in portugal until i find this gem .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be a little disappointing in that it be slightly overcarbonate and leave a slightly slick feeling on the tongue .<ssssss>but after have this beer , i get it everywhere i go , very drinkable .<ssssss>thank you sagre !<ssssss>
5 5 5 7 6		this be one of the five to six beer that i have a lot of in my youth .<ssssss>i have a lot of this , oe , coor , corona , st.ides and bud .<ssssss>nothing to be proud of , but i be young and reckless .<ssssss>i remember loving `` crazy horse '' beer and not really understand that it be offensive .<ssssss>i would pour it from a bottle into a plastic glass and it be always amber brown with a small head that be a tad sticky .<ssssss>the aroma as i can recall be of sweet malt and light grain .<ssssss>the taste be sweet , malty and tone of corn , but not like oe-better balance , lower alcohol .<ssssss>the overall feel be smooth , low carbonation and sweet grainy finish .<ssssss>note : i remember the name change and i remember that bed-stuy be upset as i have friend there and when it be pull it do not go over well .<ssssss>i be a young punk and i be just as upset .<ssssss>look back , i realize that the beer should have never exist .<ssssss>a cheap shot and i would never think of buying or drinking this again .<ssssss>
9 10 8 8 7		-lrb- bottle condition , 500 ml .<ssssss>courtesy of erik dahl , venner av ngne . -rrb-<ssssss>i receive this remarkable beer with awe , mix with great anticipation .<ssssss>very few litre of # 100 have be for sale to the public .<ssssss>would i like it , or would the massive hop -lrb- 80 ibu ! -rrb-<ssssss>be too much for I ?<ssssss>the cost of brewing it -lrb- = the massive amount of malt and hop require for a batch -rrb- make the brewer certain that it would be unprofitable as a permanent brew , particularly with norwegian alcohol tax .<ssssss>this impenetrable cloudy dark brown beer pour with a large to moderate tan head .<ssssss>aroma be simply wonderful - colombus hop galore , dark chocolate , leather , cigar , pipe tobacco , tar .<ssssss>the complexity remain in the flavour - extremely malty , very sweet , but also extremely bitter .<ssssss>the bitterness -lrb- which become medicinal and wormwood-like in the aftertaste -rrb- prevent I from give this beer a full score .<ssssss>on a regular basis , id prefer ngne s god jul -lrb- which be world class this year , imho -rrb- and also they porter .<ssssss>but what a great experiment # 100 be !<ssssss>
7 5 6 7 8		a - pour a clear toffee brown with a two finger tan head .<ssssss>great retention and lacing on the head .<ssssss>s - slight malt and wheat but not much else .<ssssss>t - surprisingly sweet at first with ton of wheat flavor , and hint of brown sugar and spice .<ssssss>finish dry and hoppy and overly boozy .<ssssss>m - light body and slightly overcarbonate .<ssssss>d - definitely drinkable on a cold winter night , as i can attest to .<ssssss>overall , this be a decent dark wheat lager , but nothing overly special .<ssssss>worth a try .<ssssss>
6 10 6 8 6		spring 2010 release from bottle pour a absolute pitch black with a thin dark tan head .<ssssss>aroma be deep and dark with roasted barley and burnt coffee .<ssssss>also notable be note of dark chocolate .<ssssss>flavor be strong with the burnt/roasted flavor and balance by a light sweetness .<ssssss>hop be linger a bit but hardly noticeable .<ssssss>mouthfeel be heavy and hot .<ssssss>at about 6 month , the alcohol have not really tone down too much .<ssssss>
7 4 6 2 2		a - hazy golden , nice white head s - massive juniper nose , ton of fresh evergreen , mint and soap .<ssssss>smell like pine-sol .<ssssss>t - taste like a combination of pine-sol and a basic light lager m - who care ?<ssssss>d - yuck !<ssssss>they website say it be a lager flavour with juniper .<ssssss>this be awful .<ssssss>i have have some great beer with juniper , but this be disgusting .<ssssss>drain pour .<ssssss>
8 10 6 4 4		appearance - very dark with a creamy mocha color head .<ssssss>aroma - dark chocolate dominate the nose .<ssssss>mouth feel - full body stout with small bubble carbonation .<ssssss>taste - bitter baker chocolate with a alcohol finish .<ssssss>overall - it smell much better than it taste .<ssssss>the bitterness of the dark chocolate be overwhelming and in my opinion ruin the experience .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 7		i purchase this beer as a single at world market in richmond , va .<ssssss>pour into a pint glass i love the 60 so why not the 90 right ?<ssssss>!<ssssss>this beer pour noticeably darker than the 60 -lrb- duh -rrb- and the head be much slower to build , lacing be tight and sticky the hop be still there and very present with big citrus and pine note .<ssssss>taste wonderful , but there be some unpleasant ethanol sting within the beautiful beverage feel great and drink okay , it be a little hard for I to see myself have more than one because of the higher abv chad<ssssss>

7 9 8 7 9		i sample this for the first time in nm , my brother get this one and i be really jealous that i be stick with a black hawk stout instead .<ssssss>get a six pack of this in chicago last weekend .<ssssss>live review .<ssssss>i still dislike can overall , but they be convenient , and the artwork be good .<ssssss>the beer itself pour a dark caramel amber with ruby twinge in the light .<ssssss>there be a very small head of white bubble .<ssssss>it do not last long , but i get a little bit of droopy spotted lace .<ssssss>smell wonderful .<ssssss>lot of really green hop - vegetal and super piney .<ssssss>the resin make this beer really sing .<ssssss>there be also crisp amber malt detectable as well .<ssssss>this be a really bitter ipa .<ssssss>the hop profile be once more pine heavy ; the greenness of the hop be also present which get a little detract at time .<ssssss>i also get some bitter spruce and juniper as well as some acidic alcohol .<ssssss>this be not the best ipa out there in the flavor department , but it be certainly solid and refreshing .<ssssss>the beer finish with more bitterness , awww yeah ... the mouthfeel be quite dry .<ssssss>moderate carbonation deliver the brew well .<ssssss>heavy pine bite along with the alcohol to serve a mild numbness to the tongue .<ssssss>this one be very drinkable in my book .<ssssss>it be simply a tasty beer that serve its role very well .<ssssss>i drink three in a row while hang out in chicago .<ssssss>

8 8 6 5 5		left coast bomber be on sale at my store , and be that double ipa be my favorite style , i figure i would give it a shot .<ssssss>i also get they single ipa which i will review soon .<ssssss>this brewery claim to be one of the pioneer of the double ipa style so i be pretty excite to try this `` hop juice '' !<ssssss>a - why be it that many west coast brew tend to overflow the bottle once uncap ?<ssssss>anyway , pour a hazy golden orange with a one finger foamy white head that persist .<ssssss>decent lacing .<ssssss>s - fruity hop and piney/earthy hop !<ssssss>usually with a ipa you will get one or the other but you get both here .<ssssss>i smell a strong malty backbone to this one already .<ssssss>t - huge malty sweetness upfront that lead to the fruity hop and then the earthy hop .<ssssss>a fairly bitter aftertaste .<ssssss>i be unsure how it smell much hoppier than it taste .<ssssss>a little weak in the taste to be honest , the smell get I expect much more .<ssssss>solid biscuity balance to this .<ssssss>the alcohol taste be fairly present and undesirable .<ssssss>i would have prefer more hop in the taste .<ssssss>misleading aroma !<ssssss>pretty strong sweetness and overall horribly unbalanced .<ssssss>what a letdown .<ssssss>m - medium body but suffer from undercarbonation in my opinion .<ssssss>seem a bit flat .<ssssss>d - this taste so much like alcohol that i would not have more than a few in a sit .<ssssss>i would not have anymore than the bomber and that be only because i feel the need to finish it since it be open and undercarbonated and will undoubtedly be flat tomorrow .<ssssss>overall , pretty disappointing .<ssssss>for a `` pioneer of the style '' i expect more .<ssssss>maybe i will like they ipa , but not if it be a water down version of this .<ssssss>great appearance and aroma , but the taste be a huge letdown and it need to be more carbonated .<ssssss>i have come to expect more from west coast big ipa .<ssssss>at least it be only a few dollar on sale , and put on quite a buzz !<ssssss>maybe if they use a ridiculous amount of real hop instead of extract this would be much better .<ssssss>
7 8 5 7 7		paradisiac carry all of the aroma associate with triple blonde , but take they to a deliciously creamy , sugary new level .<ssssss>the nose be ripe with raisin and date , brown sugar , banana cover in melted caramel , lychee nut , and orange , all of which rest atop a bed of toast grain .<ssssss>on the tongue , the taste be no less powerful , though many of the more nuanced flavor from the nose do get lose in the muddle .<ssssss>many of the citrus and banana note remain , but mixed in with a light lemon-lime , soda water sourness that would seem more likely in a flemish ale .<ssssss>toast grain swirl around in this slightly sour haze , add a oatmeal-like biscuit tenor .<ssssss>mouthfeel be quite light , and the aftertaste be dominate by sourness , with just a hint of sugar .<ssssss>overall , this be a strange brew -lrb- no movie reference intend -rrb- , come across like the nose from one beer have be surgically graft onto another .<ssssss>the beer be still good , but unexpected , and i think the sourness will turn many off .<ssssss>if you like flemish ale , give this one a try .<ssssss>
6 4 5 4 7		pour a golden color with a small amount of creamy white head that fade away pretty quickly but do lace the glass .<ssssss>smell slightly yeasty , and that be about it .<ssssss>the taste be about the same , slightly yeasty , and that be about it .<ssssss>i can not taste any malt or hop flavor in it .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a little heavy , and slightly tingly , but mostly watery .<ssssss>overall , it be pretty drinkable , as it make no statement .<ssssss>

6 7 4 4 4		get this one from a friend that claim it be awesome .<ssssss>i will have to admit that i be very excite after read the rating here on ba , but be extremely disappointed .<ssssss>triple fermentation and unfiltered sound appealing but prove to not be worth the hype .<ssssss>the smell be decent and the look be that of a very good hef with little lacing .<ssssss>the smell and taste be very fruity -lrb- banana dominate here -rrb- and at 9 % there be no deny the fact that this one would sneak up on you , if you find it drinkable .<ssssss>
8 6 4 7 6		moose drool be a southern english style brown for sure .<ssssss>sweet , syrupy and dense .<ssssss>i have the distinct flavor of molasses in mind after a bottle of the drool .<ssssss>not bad but distinctly different from other experience with brown .<ssssss>i much prefer the dryer northern style of brown but this beer be not without merit .<ssssss>
7 6 6 5 8		i be sampling this in a pint glass and chill .<ssssss>the brew pour a clear copper color with light fuffy beige head present and some light carbonation trail rise from the bottom of the glass .<ssssss>aroma be a mix of piney and sour hop but overall be very mildly scented .<ssssss>first sip reveal a thin body with low carbonation .<ssssss>light caramel flavor start the tasting , but flow to a piney hop finish .<ssssss>i also get a bit of grainy fibery flavor at the tail end .<ssssss>not a real pleasant flavor .<ssssss>this beer be very easy to drink and would probably be nice on a hot summer day at the beach or to marinade burger in , but not one of my favorite .<ssssss>
8 8 10 8 8		pour into my chimay chalice with a thick slightly tan head that subside slowly atop a deep hazy brownish red brew .<ssssss>the aroma be aparant immediatly upon pour as the fruity ester and dark fruit seem to jump from the glass .<ssssss>upon closer inspection a slight malt could be detect along with a alcoholic touch .<ssssss>the taste be very balanced and complex with a initial rush of sweet malt and dark fruit flavor which quickly segue into a effervescent rush of carbonation which seeme do have a bit of hop bitterness in it as well finish dry and clean .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be excellent as this ale have a delicate creamy texture to it and the effervescent carbonation create a very delicat balance .<ssssss>a excellent trappist ale i would definely include this ale if i be host a belgian beer tasting as it be approachable and also indicitive of belgian brewing .<ssssss>
4 4 8 5 8		the pale beer start out with a frothy head , but it fade quick .<ssssss>highly carbonated , light aroma .<ssssss>taste slightly sweet in the front , and slightly bitter in the back .<ssssss>kinda of balanced .<ssssss>light body .<ssssss>i can not help but think that they leave it in the sun or something to give it a little hint of skunk .<ssssss>i drink it on wednesday when import be on sale at the local bar .<ssssss>
9 10 6 8 8		huge thanks to zorprime for the bottle - i be a huge fan of belgian style , so this be a good one for I to try - cheer eric !<ssssss>this tripel pour a slightly cloudy deep gold with a large foamy white head .<ssssss>the colour be bright , radiant and attractive , while the bone-white head leave finger of lace and never really go away , thanks to steady stream of bubble reach up from the bottom of the glass .<ssssss>the aroma be simply sublime .<ssssss>really , its a huge fruit salad , with strong note of ripe mango , pear , apple and tropical fruit .<ssssss>a slight soapiness add to the mix in what be otherwise a very soft , fragrant , juicy and floral bouquet .<ssssss>if my wife start wear this scent i would not mind !<ssssss>it even improve as the beer warm , with honeydew melon join the party .<ssssss>after the spectacular stage set by the aroma , its hard for the flavour to keep up , but it perform gamely and reveal dominus vobsicum to be a very well-constructed tripel .<ssssss>its not surprise that a tropical fruitiness dominate proceedings , and it provide a light sweetness throughout , before be cut short by a moderately bitter finish .<ssssss>a nice floral aftertaste linger on the palate .<ssssss>i be enjoy this and want to give the taste more than a 4 in this category , but be not a 4.5 either .<ssssss>the carbonation reveal this beer 's only flaw .<ssssss>tripel be suppose to be highly carbonated , but the best still manage to feel soft and luxurious in the mouth .<ssssss>dominus vobiscum fall short of this , and its aggressive bubble feel a touch too prickly .<ssssss>its a distracting factor in what be otherwise a style-appropriate body .<ssssss>a slight warming betray the abv , but in a way that enhance , rather than detract from the experience .<ssssss>this be a great tripel , and a very enjoyable drinking experience .<ssssss>however , it be hurt by the prickly carbonation , and i wish they would rein it in to complete a impressive all-round package .<ssssss>this be a good beer , though .<ssssss>give she a swirl and you will be okay - i be .<ssssss>
8 9 8 10 7		pour a very dark brown with maroon brown highlight when hold up to the light that have a half finger of brown head and leave some good frothy lacing stick to the glass .<ssssss>very nice bourbon vanilla and chocolate aroma pop out on the nose with cocoa , caramel , and toffee note but with some booziness as well .<ssssss>the taste be also very chocolatey like the name say with bourbon , vanilla , and cocoa accent roasty character but do have a touch of caramel toffee plus there be definitely lot of booze but it do not overpower the overall flavor .<ssssss>the brew be medium in body with a nice amount of carbonation which have a roasty , chocolatey , bourbon , sweet , creamy , and chewy finish .<ssssss>definitely a amazing tasting black tuesday hybrid that will knock everyone sock off .<ssssss>i be glad i get to try it and be a sipper faux show .<ssssss>
6 5 6 5 8		pour a pil gold , very light for a apa , with a decent head .<ssssss>smell like fruit -- maybe a little bit old -- along with very light hop .<ssssss>no real balance , no real hop presence .<ssssss>taste a lot like it smell .<ssssss>ester of fruit suggest age , very weak dry hop , and then a watery finish .<ssssss>nothing go on here worth mention , let alone worth try .<ssssss>
8 8 8 6 7		burnt sugar , caramel , and toast malt aroma .<ssssss>slight spiciness as well .<ssssss>very sweet beer .<ssssss>i can imagine that the 3 year of aging help mellow it out , but this be one sweet beer .<ssssss>flavor follow the aroma , but heavier on the sugar/spiciness .<ssssss>sticky on the palate , alcohol well hide .<ssssss>i could not believe when i find this one hide behind a bunch of other beer on the top shelf of a random liquor store , but i must say i be slightly disappointed .<ssssss>overall a good beer , but not as balanced as i have hope .<ssssss>
6 7 5 3 4		i tend not to review many macro beer , but i be wait for a ride and have a few minute to kill .<ssssss>i step into the nearest bar and this happen to be the most `` interesting '' beer they have on tap .<ssssss>this be a review from note i take month ago .<ssssss>present to I in a rickard 's glass .<ssssss>honey-brown in colour , completely transparent .<ssssss>not much head to begin with and what be there mostly disappear .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>look like beer , i guess .<ssssss>smell like a yeast factory .<ssssss>some grain , something vaguely hoppy .<ssssss>not all unpleasant , there be actually a smell .<ssssss>first impression : public swimming pool water .<ssssss>no joke .<ssssss>it taste like people swim in this .<ssssss>background bit of yeast and grain .<ssssss>not much honey or brown to be find .<ssssss>very thin and watery .<ssssss>mild carbonation .<ssssss>below-average feel .<ssssss>i would never want to drink this ever again .<ssssss>not even for free after a really long , bad day if it be the only beer available .<ssssss>i be not surprise this be no longer brew .<ssssss>good riddance .<ssssss>

5 8 7 6 7		apperance : pour a old copper color , like a 1979 penny with a short head that disappear quickly .<ssssss>smell : hop , of coarse , maybe to much .<ssssss>and a slight hint of malt , i think , the hop cover everything taste : hop , bitterness and malt .<ssssss>it have more hop in the nose then in the taste .<ssssss>mouthfeel : full body .<ssssss>crisp drinkability : on a hot day i could see my self enjoy a few of this beer to cool of , but not for the pure enjoyment of beer .<ssssss>
9 6 8 8 9		have a few of these last night and what a delight .<ssssss>pour a deep amber brown that get a moderate inch head with some nice lacing .<ssssss>the smell be the only part i do not enjoy , not because it be bad per se , but because it remind I of a neighbor house from where i grow up .<ssssss>there house be disgust with pet fece and the like ... anyhow the smell be somehow similar to that house and be distract for I at least .<ssssss>taste be a step away from magical .<ssssss>come up fast and bold with a hop flurry and finish nice and tight .<ssssss>there be minimal aftertaste or linger hop taste with this beer .<ssssss>i very much enjoy the taste of this beer .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be thick and chewy but not so much that you will get full from drink one of these .<ssssss>drinkability be high .<ssssss>these be a very nice beer to drink and have enough of a dynamic to keep you guess and keep it interesting but not so much that you get catch up in over analyzing .<ssssss>

10 9 8 9 6		first impression be huge , and this beer look gorgeous .<ssssss>shine a flashlight on the other end of the glass , and i would bet that you would not get any light on the other side .<ssssss>it pour and look like a great stout with a dark tan head that stay around .<ssssss>the smell be slightly tinge with alcohol , but that be to be expect from a 12-percenter .<ssssss>other scent i get include sweetness , almost like a orange , and vanilla .<ssssss>when i taste this , it be very reminiscent of a very strong sweet stout .<ssssss>the sweetness compliment the alcohol very well .<ssssss>drinkability be slightly low due to the thickness and high alcohol , but this obviously be never intend to be a session brew .<ssssss>overall , this be a excellent beer among the best i have have from dogfish .<ssssss>
6 8 7 5 5		11.5 oz bottle from vidalia in lansdale -lrb- stupid expensive be right -rrb- pour into a snifter .<ssssss>copper with off-white head , fairly poor retention , little lacing -- a pretty boring look beer .<ssssss>perhaps the snifter be a bad choice , a squeeky clean pint glass might have make this one .<ssssss>smell be pretty boozy , like a american barleywine -- not quite as strong as devil dancer or anything but , to I at least , that smell be immediately identifiable .<ssssss>i know its only 6.5 % , though , so we will see where this lead .<ssssss>taste be pretty disappointing , sort of like a water down barleywine .<ssssss>not a ton go on .<ssssss>i be not get the fresh piney or citrusy hop that i be expect .<ssssss>dry-hop you say ?<ssssss>i do not believe it .<ssssss>mouthfeel be fine .<ssssss>no real complaint .<ssssss>drinkability be limit by disappointment .<ssssss>i have three more beer from this brewery -lrb- peche mortel , route des pices and dernire volont -rrb- and i hope they be much better than this .<ssssss>unless you can find it for two or three dollar a bottle -lrb- you will not -rrb- or love collect bottle than just admire the cool label and pass on this one for a better , cheaper beer from one of any number of real ` merican brewery .<ssssss>

8 8 6 8 8		stone pale ale pour a mostly clear , dark amber/copper color with a small off-white head .<ssssss>there be some nice caramel note on the nose , along with a bit of grassy hop .<ssssss>the taste start with a good amount of sweet malt follow by a mild bitterness from the hop .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be a bit thin , with a medium amount of carbonation .<ssssss>until now , i have only have big beer from stone , so i be surprise at how subdue the hop be in this pale ale .<ssssss>it be pretty simple , but very drinkable .<ssssss>
7 9 10 9 9		a - pour and shockingly there be no head !<ssssss>this might be a omen that this be a old beer -lrb- i just pick this one up today -rrb- .<ssssss>carbonation bubble be present .<ssssss>root beer like color , very hazy .<ssssss>s - banana bread , dark fruit , invite complexity .<ssssss>t - similar to the smell , some peppery note , but clove be omnipresent .<ssssss>m - nothing attack you , the spice in this do not offend .<ssssss>finish smooth .<ssssss>o - you can not go wrong , alcohol be masterfully mask .<ssssss>who do not like banana flavor in a autumn beer ?<ssssss>i be not a huge german beer fan , but this live up to the hype .<ssssss>
7 6 8 9 9		a - pour very light , almost like apple juice .<ssssss>not too much of a head but leave very nice lacing .<ssssss>s - not all that pungent for a dipa , some citrusy hop but not much else .<ssssss>t - somewhat sweet .<ssssss>bitter and hoppy up front , the taste be far different than the scent would reveal .<ssssss>earthy and piney hop , not too much fruit here , but there be some .<ssssss>m - far lighter feeling than any dipa i have ever try .<ssssss>it seem that they just do not want to make as rich and thick a beer as other brewer , and luckily the price be reflective of this .<ssssss>d - very drinkable and tasty beer .<ssssss>i like this amp up ipa for a nice price .<ssssss>
6 7 8 6 6		pour a cloudy , copper body with a dismal 1/4 '' head .<ssssss>the head dissipate quite quickly and leave minimal lacing around the glass .<ssssss>ehh ... smell - sweet malt and fruity hop come through on the nose .<ssssss>slight caramel on the end .<ssssss>taste - sweet and fruity , just like the smell .<ssssss>not a lot of surprise with the taste here .<ssssss>a little bitterness linger on the end .<ssssss>mouthfeel - mild carbonation and very smooth .<ssssss>quite nice , actually .<ssssss>overall - a nice drink with not much surprise .<ssssss>unfortunately , it just do not bring much to the table .<ssssss>i will , however drink this again in the future .<ssssss>a beer that i would get some novice beer drinker to try .<ssssss>
8 3 7 4 4		16 oz can into a pint glass .<ssssss>drink in early october , just a couple of week within its initial release .<ssssss>pour a slightly haze copper , with several finger of slight look off-white head .<ssssss>this settle into a tight finger that hold steady , leave back a rich cascade of sudsy lace that cling to the side of the glass .<ssssss>strong clove and possibly coriander jump right out of the nose and immediately star clash with raw earthiness of the hop .<ssssss>there be maybe a smidge of underlie sweet smell something but i cant even pick it out amongst the ridiculousness of all of spice and hop .<ssssss>this smell more like a witbier than it do a pumpkin ale .<ssssss>the taste be sticky tropical fruit up front from those citra hop , which then segue into a sharp earthy bitterness that be surround by herbal tone on the edge .<ssssss>im get some ripe pumpkin flavor across the back but its nearly take over by the strength of that aggressive hoppy finish , which stick raw bitter rind to the tongue .<ssssss>there be some sugar from the malt present that meld with the ripe fruitiness of the hop and a moderate amount of spicing -lrb- but not nearly as much as the nose -rrb- but it all just seem to get swallow up by the overall harshness of the hop .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be medium body , with a prickly and sharp feel to the carbonation on the edge , but then get much smoother as this move out across the tongue .<ssssss>for the most part though , this be fairly slick in the mouth with a relatively slow alcohol presence for close to 7 % .<ssssss>i can see what they be shoot for with this but overall , i think this beer be a mess .<ssssss>to its credit , as this warm , the bitterness do ease some and the spice actually pick up in the taste , but this be just all over the place with raw bitterness , sticky fruit , pumpkin , and spice .<ssssss>it just lack definition and any kind of real enjoyment drinking it .<ssssss>im glad that i only pick up a single of this , as id be give away the remain can otherwise .<ssssss>

9 10 8 8 9		serve from a 1 pint 6 oz .<ssssss>bottle into a weizen glass .<ssssss>a : big tan head typical of a weizen beer sit on top of this dark , cola color , clear ale .<ssssss>good lacing and a moderate amount of bubble round out the appearance .<ssssss>s : strong banana ester dominate the smell - very nice !<ssssss>wheat and dark malt add a sweetness in the aroma .<ssssss>t : very malty with caramel and vanilla flavor .<ssssss>slight sweetness , with little to no bitterness .<ssssss>m : carbonation be medium-low and the body be medium .<ssssss>finish be dry/semi-sweet .<ssssss>o : as the beer warm , the malt show more character and new spicy flavor open up , along with some alcohol warmth .<ssssss>overall this be a excellent beer - highly recommend .<ssssss>

8 9 8 10 8		a - to say this beer have a lot of head would be a understatement .<ssssss>i give it a good 10 minute to settle down before i actually get to the beer .<ssssss>despite this , i be impress by how well the beer retain the head as well as the lacing .<ssssss>s - the smell be quite complex , so much so that it be hard to identify the different smell .<ssssss>while i be not always a fan of this , i think it work with this beer .<ssssss>i have a long time to smell this after have to wait for the head to settle .<ssssss>t - the taste be as complex as the smell .<ssssss>like other trappist ale , i get a citrus flavor at the end .<ssssss>lot of fruit be present , while still maintain the hop flavor .<ssssss>m - once you actually get the head to settle , this beer feel great in you mouth .<ssssss>it be very rich in tone .<ssssss>d - this be a great beer .<ssssss>my only problem be find a suitable pairing for it .<ssssss>i think if you match this beer with the wrong food , you be go to lose out on a lot of the subtlety of the flavor and aroma more so than you average beer .<ssssss>
7 4 8 6 8		a : deep deep brown with tan head and excellent lacing .<ssssss>s : not much there ... sweet caramel and spice .<ssssss>t : i be not that impress by this year 's offering from anchor .<ssssss>malty-sweetness in the beginning with a fruity mid .<ssssss>good nutty flavor and bitter hop at the finish .<ssssss>m : well carbonated medium feel .<ssssss>d : i look forward to this beer every season .<ssssss>however , this year i be underwhelm so not something i would stockpile .<ssssss>
8 5 8 9 8		pour a deep brown-black with some reddish tint at the base and the top ; a nice porter color .<ssssss>the head dissolve rather quickly , though , and there be not much of a lace to note .<ssssss>to capture the fullness of the aroma , i pour it into a belgian snifter-type glass , but be rather disappointed that there be not much aroma present .<ssssss>hint of malted coffee rise to the top after a stir , but otherwise i do not notice much .<ssssss>could this have be my fault ?<ssssss>entirely possible , as i hope to give the aroma another shot in the future .<ssssss>taste nice .<ssssss>strong coffee note with chocolate and some wood .<ssssss>that bitter coffee finish be great , in my opinion .<ssssss>sturdy mouthfeel and nice drinkability for a `` mocha '' porter .<ssssss>i will drink this again , even though it be not my favorite porter out there .<ssssss>a solid effor all around by rogue .<ssssss>

6 8 6 9 8		bottle courtesy of rzinw from we trade this past weekend .<ssssss>pour a effervescent , slightly hazy dark orange , almost amber color with a nice fluffy 2 inch eggshell head .<ssssss>very nice lacing and head retention .<ssssss>aroma begin with a lot of hoppiness feature the gambit of floral and piney upfront with lesser amount of grapefruit and sweet citrus as well .<ssssss>as it warm i get a nice bready and slightly caramel maltiness .<ssssss>the taste follow the nose with juicy hop and sweet malt .<ssssss>first you get the sweet bready and lighter caramel malt show up again follow by a copious amount of pine and sweet citrus hop .<ssssss>the flavor profile be center around hop flavor over hop bitterness .<ssssss>bitterness be actually quite subdue overall at this point , but this be be bottled over a year and a half ago so that be to be expect .<ssssss>as this warm you get a little light brown sugar , almost toffee flavor but the hop profile really steal and own this show .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be medium to full body ; almost chewy but there be plenty of carbonation to help the drinkability of this higher abv offering .<ssssss>finish be mildly dry and crisp , but sticky thanks to the ample hoppiness .<ssssss>overall i really love this beer because of the crazy amount of hop flavor couple with the lower than expect bitterness .<ssssss>this remind I of the 2008 behemoth i have a couple month back but there be more caramel maltiness here ; not a lot more , but that beer never approach any toffee or brown sugar barleywine flavor as this one do .<ssssss>initial review of this beer call it a triple ipa or super dipa but at this point it be a balanced really nice dipa/american barleywine .<ssssss>very low on the caramel/toffee/brown sugar flavor .<ssssss>no cocoa or dark caramel maltiness here for sure .<ssssss>i really enjoy this beer and wish i have a case of this stuff right now -lrb- aged of course -rrb- .<ssssss>update : just drink a second bottle i get in a different trade and it be completely still .<ssssss>odell once again drop the ball on carbonation .<ssssss>review be be amend to reflect both experience .<ssssss>flavor be still solid but this be the stillest beer i have ever have ; make it hard to completely enjoy .<ssssss>

5 5 8 6 6		pour from a 12oz bottle into a goblet glass .<ssssss>pour a cloudy , gold with a 1 finger head .<ssssss>quickly dissolve into a very thin head .<ssssss>less than half a finger .<ssssss>aroma be somewhat lack , in my opinion .<ssssss>fruity .<ssssss>alcohol come through a bit ... pick up some floral note .<ssssss>taste be more of the same .<ssssss>a little too fruity up front .<ssssss>kind of like drink some fruit juice .<ssssss>can not really pick up the type of fruit , but definitely a blend go on there .<ssssss>finish with floral hop and a touch of spice .<ssssss>i also get a little alcohol taste in the finish too .<ssssss>surprising light mouthfeel for a brew of this abv .<ssssss>deceptively drinkable .<ssssss>overall , a decent brew , i guess .<ssssss>for I , its a type of brew i pick up to taste , do not enjoy it to the point where i get more but do not hate it to the point of a drain pour .<ssssss>
3 5 2 2 2		aroma be typical of a pale lager , crisp and malty , nothing special - but at least it be strong and not watery .<ssssss>it pour with a nice thick white head , but the wan straw yellow be not inspiring - nor be all the little goober i see float in the bottle .<ssssss>flavor be flat and weak so it barely taste like beer , or even a macro-brew .<ssssss>texture lack even a nice beery fizz , and leave a barely noticeable malty aftertaste .<ssssss>maybe this bottle be from a bum batch .<ssssss>
6 8 5 7 7		crazy sale on this at the local mart and buy since i have not try it before .<ssssss>a : reddish copper with a small head s : definitely some malt , maybe some nut t : roasty with good carb m : good but after the first two i get a buttery type feeling in my mouth similar to the last review .<ssssss>o : backup beer at best , use for power hour .<ssssss>
4 6 9 6 5		random buy ... a : very light in color with no head .<ssssss>not impress with the look of this .<ssssss>s : can not get any scent at all .<ssssss>i try as hard as i could and can not smell anything from this one .<ssssss>t : eh , kind of middle of the road .<ssssss>nothing special .<ssssss>taste like a high end mainstream brew .<ssssss>need more flavor complexity .<ssssss>m : very well balanced amount of carbonation .<ssssss>d : way too easy to drink , like water .<ssssss>not good .<ssssss>all in all , this one be too easy and be like a high end mainstream beer .<ssssss>which be not say too much .<ssssss>not recommend for people look to expand to craft brew .<ssssss>
7 8 7 6 8		appearance-gaslight 's octoberfest pour nicely from the tap with a hazy orange-red color and a decent foamy head , when it arrive i inspect the big bubble haze as it slowly dissapear , ok clarity .<ssssss>smell-warm spicy aroma , hop and barley , very malty aroma as well .<ssssss>taste-malty upfront , slight hop kick in , dissapontingly subdue in its character , though i do think that the carbonation be well balanced .<ssssss>mouthfeel/drinkability-light and smooth , go down alright , malty enough but you wish more be there .<ssssss>overall-fair enough interpretation by gaslight but very similar to those of other brewery , seem subdue though , you wonder what may have be .<ssssss>i do hope they cask this sometime though .<ssssss>
7 7 6 8 6		i pick up one of the ommegang witte bottle to share with my wife on a friday evening .<ssssss>i figure since she love heff and whites this would be a good one for she to try and i may as well review it too .<ssssss>appearance definitely be impressive before ever even open a ommegang beer , the bottles/labels with the cork stopper be rare and eye catch .<ssssss>the beer itself be definitely solid with its powdery white head upon be pour into the glass .<ssssss>i actually get a bit carry away it and it take I a minute to pour the glass full .<ssssss>as with other beer in this line-up the head retention be first rate .<ssssss>as for smell it clearly have the citrusy sweet smell to it with the definite scent of corriander .<ssssss>taste be very light and crisp with this sample , i have have the witte before but this one seem to be mute for some reason .<ssssss>i feel like i could not figure out the true character of the beer .<ssssss>i think there be a possibility that the store may have let it get light and/or temperature damage .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very light and thin .<ssssss>not that it be unpleasant or bad tasting , but it just be not remarkable in anyway .<ssssss>as for drinkability , i would buy this beer again , but probably more for my wife than myself .<ssssss>it just do not have much character to it to stand up to other beer in the ommegang line .<ssssss>i think this be a good summer beer , not a great one , and most definitely a good beer to initiate a possible non-craft beer drinker into you `` fold '' .<ssssss>
10 8 8 6 8		treat myself to a very high abv beer in a cheer -lrb- yes the 90 's tv series -rrb- mug at my desk in santa cruz california .<ssssss>though what compel my to purchase this beer be the abv but now that i have taste it and it be be digest -lrb- i be about half way do with the bottle -rrb- i realize that i should probably be share this beer .<ssssss>fire be very present in the aroma as well as the smoky porter and coffee smell .<ssssss>the taste be , albeit too easy a diagnosis , a bit watery and bitter for a dessert beer .<ssssss>the after taste be definately a acquire one and nothing to boast about , yet any unique beer be a game in my book .<ssssss>as with most mikkeller beer the appearance be exceptional -lrb- opaque with a very small head of coffee with cream -rrb- bottomline , you ten buck be better spend on the beer geek by mikkeller , if one have the option , and share this one with a friend because you taste bud will diminish as you get more drunk .<ssssss>
6 4 6 7 7		pour a dark gold colour with a bone-white head that comprise about a third of the glass .<ssssss>it smell sweet , metallic , and like corn .<ssssss>it have high carbonation .<ssssss>the taste have some corn in it , but mostly it taste like bread and a bit metallic .<ssssss>it have a bit of a bite to it too that i like .<ssssss>it be not a particularly harsh bite .<ssssss>it be probably partially due to the carbonation and that metallic off-note , but it be there .<ssssss>it be get a bit of a starchy flavour to it as well , despite be watery .<ssssss>that be what i like about this beer , it be a water-beer for sure , but despite that it still taste like liquid bread and it be get a 5.5 % alcohol content .<ssssss>this be my go-to beer for a budget beer .<ssssss>my only problem with it be that it do not taste fresh .<ssssss>something about it taste old and stale .<ssssss>it be probably due to that metallic taste .<ssssss>that be no bueno .<ssssss>but all in all , i like that good old bread and water taste .<ssssss>

9 8 10 8 8		dark red almost brown in color with excellent creamy head that last until the end .<ssssss>piney , a little soap , and fruity .<ssssss>very hoppy , piney , citrus , a little malt with a linger bitterness .<ssssss>excellent mouthfeel , very creamy , so smooth that i dont even know its in my mouth until i taste the hop .<ssssss>excellent ipa , i will have this again soon .<ssssss>
7 8 8 6 7		this brew pour a opaque black color with no head to speak of .<ssssss>the aroma be of roasted malt with cherry in the back gorund .<ssssss>the taste have a lot more cherry in it than the aroma suggest .<ssssss>there be a base of roasted malt , but i would like this brew more if the malt show through more clearly .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be full body with nice carbonation , and a overall smoothness .<ssssss>this brew be pretty good , but bell 's make so many great beer that i would choose before this one .<ssssss>
8 6 8 5 8		pour a copper color with a deep ruby tint .<ssssss>thin white head have little to no retention and not much lacing .<ssssss>not a whole lot go on in the nose department .<ssssss>sweet malt and light hop , but that about it .<ssssss>flavor be as advertise , light and not much go on .<ssssss>pretty dang sweet , with a barley like tangy character .<ssssss>roasted malt be stronger as it warm .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be be light to medium , and have a good carbonation level for the style .<ssssss>decent drinkability .<ssssss>overall , not the most impressive beer .<ssssss>i be not go to judge new holland on this , as i have great expectation of they , but this do not do it for I .<ssssss>
7 6 6 8 7		a-clear golden body with thin lacy white head .<ssssss>s-hint of citrus , hop , and spice t-light crispness with just enough amount of spicy hop .<ssssss>m-very light body and medium to high carbonation o-good beer for a hot summer day , just nothing to thrilling .<ssssss>would drink it again for a barbecue or something like that but something i will be excite to drink again .<ssssss>
9 6 8 8 8		a - awesome pour .<ssssss>dark , dark , dark brown body with a very active medium brown head standing at about a inch and a half .<ssssss>there seem to be some significant carbonation too .<ssssss>s - caramel and a slight coffee aroma .<ssssss>t - there be a chocolate flavor accompany by a caramel taste .<ssssss>the end and the finish offer a nice bitterness of hop that leave my palette ask for more .<ssssss>i like it .<ssssss>m - the feel be watery which be not at all what i be expect .<ssssss>the watery feel allow it to flow fairly easy .<ssssss>~ this be a good beer .<ssssss>one that be certainly worth the $ 5.00 i pay for the 25 ounce bomber .<ssssss>dan 's liquor in plover , wisconsin be the joint where i pick up this carbon .<ssssss>
8 6 7 9 8		a bottle from the same four pack as the 2002 review , age in a 55 degree cellar for four year .<ssssss>deep brown with a tan head , do not last long .<ssssss>not much aroma - maybe some toffee , not much else .<ssssss>this beer age spectacularly !<ssssss>!<ssssss>!<ssssss>start with a smoky , toffeish maltiness , no hop left except for a light bitterness .<ssssss>the same smoky/toffee/hints of wheat/ester flavor carry though the flavor , with a dry cherry note kick in at the end .<ssssss>no burn whatsoever , and what oxidation there be be well cover by the primary beer flavor .<ssssss>not as chewy as i would expect , especially give the percent alcohol .<ssssss>glad i have one more - the question be , when do it go into the fridge ?<ssssss>unequivocally recommend for beer cellarer .<ssssss>one of those `` what if ... ? ''<ssssss>experiment that definitely pan out .<ssssss>
6 7 9 8 8		cask glass at the drie fonteinen restaurant in beersel .<ssssss>from note .<ssssss>a - pour slightly hazy with a copper colour and no head or carbonation .<ssssss>s - hay , grape skin , mild aroma after those note but i also get some musty , pissy , and vinegary note .<ssssss>t - aggressively sour .<ssssss>vinegar be obvious .<ssssss>ditch ?<ssssss>some sort of fruit be noticable and a lemon candy taste be there .<ssssss>many layer make this very interesting .<ssssss>m - sting the tongue on the front right away .<ssssss>sour in the back as well .<ssssss>no carbonation and a mild to medium body .<ssssss>slightly dry finish .<ssssss>o/d - a good lambic .<ssssss>the aggressive sourness might be a issue for more than one or two but it be still quite good .<ssssss>refreshing and tasty on a lovely summer day in belgium .<ssssss>very complex .<ssssss>
8 6 8 4 6		a-clear gold with a medium white head that mostly diminish leave minimal lacing .<ssssss>s-sweet , with a bit of sourness , fruity , and some spicy note .<ssssss>t-a bit of hop and spiciness but where the hell be the chocolate ?<ssssss>the reason for my 2 ... this beer be call chocolat and i as hard as i try i do not detect any .<ssssss>m-light body .<ssssss>carbonation be spirited make for a tingly mouthfeel .<ssssss>d-for a straight up saision this beer be fine but i be hope for so much more ... .<ssssss>maybe use real chocolate instead of cocoa podwer ?<ssssss>wtf ?<ssssss>chocolat ... .<ssssss>where ?<ssssss>
7 6 6 8 7		thanks bgramer for hook I up with riserva 2008 .<ssssss>a : a medium pour produce a deep dark mahogany-colored brew with bright red highlight .<ssssss>a two-finger head the color of a pink-peach lay down somewhat .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>s : pretty light on the nose , some mild malt , some yeast ester -lrb- ?<ssssss>! -rrb-<ssssss>t : sweet , rich , malty .<ssssss>m : big , creamy , rich , slight alcohol bite , not clean but not cloying or unpleasant .<ssssss>
6 6 6 8 6		i think this rather thin compare to previous porter .<ssssss>nice fruity , roasted flavor with subtle hop note in the finish , but not as full body and complex as past brew .<ssssss>
7 5 8 6 5		pour a orangish golden color with a creamy one-inch white head .<ssssss>aroma be not unlike a cheap american macro , which be probably due to the age of the product -lrb- the label say it be bottled 7 month ago -rrb- .<ssssss>a touch of light malt , some hop , but mainly some sour funk .<ssssss>taste be a little better - a light bitter hoppiness temper by some sweet malt , but there be still the stale sourness linger in the background .<ssssss>body be nice , full , and sturdy , like you would want a pale ale to be .<ssssss>unfortunately , i can not say i recommend this one .<ssssss>it be odd that one of the best brewery in the world do not excel at such a basic style , but i guess that be not they strength .<ssssss>
8 7 8 6 8		pour a clear dark-amber-gold , with a multi-inch head .<ssssss>the head be off-white and have a creamy cappuccino-textured top and large interior bubble .<ssssss>the head settle in at about 1.5 inch with a rocky texture .<ssssss>the hop in the initial nose be floral and highly aromatic .<ssssss>spotty belgian lace .<ssssss>clear malt note be balance against the bitter hop .<ssssss>medium body , creamy texture and gentle linger with some malt and hop note in the finish .<ssssss>sweeter than expect .<ssssss>the alcohol be not noticeable .<ssssss>not particularly moreish .<ssssss>refreshing and quenching .<ssssss>
4 4 6 7 5		pour a slightly haze dark gold .<ssssss>soapy one finger head will fizzle out and leave little to no lace .<ssssss>weak scent of ester and corn , but not much malt or hop .<ssssss>sweet pale malt and wheat flavor upfront , with ester and butterscotch in the back .<ssssss>aftertaste be a touch dry , with a decenlt balanced tea-like hop .<ssssss>thin body and low carbonation be smooth , but the drinkability be taint by the diacetyl that set in the finish .<ssssss>a slick mouthfeel may be appropriate for the style , but its still a bit pricey for overall quality .<ssssss>
8 9 8 9 6		thanks to abankovich for the trade on this one .<ssssss>pour a hazy golden-straw color with two finger of fluffy white head .<ssssss>it leave sheet of lacing on my pint glass .<ssssss>the nose be packed full of citrus hop scent .<ssssss>there be a subtle earthiness mixed , but i can not pickup any malt background .<ssssss>i almost smell a bit of candied fruit as well .<ssssss>the flavor profile be heavy on the hop with flavor of ripe pink grapefruit and resinous pine dominate without much of a malt base to round thing out .<ssssss>the beer be medium body with medium carbonation that leave a very dry finish on the back of my palate .<ssssss>i would certainly purchase this beer again , but the unbalanced nature of the beer would not make it part of my regular rotation .<ssssss>
9 7 8 8 5		bottle # 188 - maybe b/c i trade w / papat444 for it : -rrb- pour into my duvel tulip , where it come out brown and be nearly opaque until hold to bright light where a reddish-brown hue come through .<ssssss>appear clear , with a nice 1cm + tan head that leave moderate lacing .<ssssss>initially the nose be dominate by a sweetness and alcohol with some underlie fruit note .<ssssss>the beer itself initially come off as somewhere between cloying and be very strong .<ssssss>it become less potent as time go on , reveal note of cherry ?<ssssss>and a finish of brown sugar .<ssssss>enjoyable , but potent and initially quite hard to drink .<ssssss>maybe a little age would have do this beer good ...<ssssss>
9 10 7 9 9		very dark reddish-brown .<ssssss>no real head to speak of .<ssssss>lace around the rim .<ssssss>smell fruity and sweet , syrupy almost .<ssssss>very robust smell compare to most beer .<ssssss>the taste be practically a mirror of the smell .<ssssss>sweet , tasty malt with a small amount of hop on the end that give it a good finish .<ssssss>a fantastic beer , especially if you love malt .<ssssss>
9 6 10 10 10		a triple wheat brew at 9 % and a shelf life of 3 year .<ssssss>the color be great give off a deep and cloudy orange .<ssssss>the head dissipate too quickly .<ssssss>the aroma be very light but it smell sweet and hint of vanilla .<ssssss>most of all though it be clean .<ssssss>on the first sip i get a lot of honey and bit of vanilla .<ssssss>the carbonation fizz on the tongue nicely in the middle .<ssssss>towards the back the flavor really come through .<ssssss>surprisingly there be a strong flavor of ripe fruit like plum and apricot .<ssssss>it finish well leave a bit of yeasty bread on the tongue .<ssssss>this be a totally unique wheat .<ssssss>i be expect more bread , straw , grass , etc .<ssssss>not red fruit like a porter or a imperial ipa .<ssssss>it be really fantastic .<ssssss>refreshing , smooth , and full of flavor .<ssssss>how often do that happen ?<ssssss>
9 8 10 9 8		have the tap version of this -lrb- super jubel -rrb- a few time at great ak b and bw fest .<ssssss>time to test out the bottled version that just arrive on anchorage shelf .<ssssss>pour a hugely dark ruby red color , but totally clear .<ssssss>nice off white head rest well for the style and leave pretty decent lacing .<ssssss>nose be huge deep dark fruit .<ssssss>booze soak carameled fruit and large vanilla and oak note .<ssssss>a touch of fig and black cherry -lrb- wine ? -rrb-<ssssss>and slight hairspray like booze .<ssssss>pretty durn nice .<ssssss>big for sure with monster dark fruit flavor .<ssssss>giant vanilla and caramel presence .<ssssss>more dark fruit .<ssssss>fig .<ssssss>slight hop presence , but clearly not the focus here .<ssssss>the finish be more bitter than i expect and could use some mellow out to suit the beer better .<ssssss>aftertaste be fairly boozy , suprisingly dry , and reek of dark fruit and vanilla , some oak as well .<ssssss>mouthfeel be pretty much exactly what you want for this style .<ssssss>med-high viscosity .<ssssss>carbonation be flawless for the style .<ssssss>nice and sticky , great mark here .<ssssss>drinkability be what you would expect for a relatively fresh 10 % beer .<ssssss>not amazing right now , one bomber be surely enough , but you should expect that .<ssssss>over time i think this could really smooth out well .<ssssss>overall , a very nice beer .<ssssss>some english barleywine like characteristic , but definitely not fall into that category .<ssssss>giant dark fruit and sugary flavor that blend very well .<ssssss>not sure , but i expect there be some barrel aging do on this one .<ssssss>this be definitely one to lay down , its great even now , but in time this could be something special .<ssssss>excellent cellar potential here .<ssssss>great beer .<ssssss>
6 8 10 9 9		ah good beer , it be be too long .<ssssss>my first review in a long time .<ssssss>for the start of my time teaching and my one year anniversary back from bulgaria i look for something nice , and find it in the most random of place , a small store in the beer wasteland of santee , sc .<ssssss>a pleasant surprise .<ssssss>here go .<ssssss>a : the bottle be incredibly hard to get open .<ssssss>inside the bottle a huge amount of yeast and sediment be visible .<ssssss>this will have to be a very careful pour for sure .<ssssss>pour from the 750 ml corked bottle into a tulip glass .<ssssss>the beer be a bright yellow color with lot of sediment float around .<ssssss>head be 3 or so finger , offwhite and stick around a bit wile leave clump along the side of the glass .<ssssss>overall a good look beer , but the huge amount of sediment be a bit off .<ssssss>s : slightly spicy and herbal with a slight funkiness in the back .<ssssss>yeastiness be definitely a highlight .<ssssss>sourdoagh bread .<ssssss>some citrus zest in there as well .<ssssss>t : very refreshing with load of citrus and a subtle spiciness underneath .<ssssss>slightly tart , but very light and surprisingly sweet but not too much so .<ssssss>like a saison but without as much funk .<ssssss>like a champagne , but not as winey .<ssssss>this be a fantastic drink .<ssssss>d : light and subtle .<ssssss>have a bit of zest but not too much at all .<ssssss>great .<ssssss>o : this beer could go with anything .<ssssss>i enjoy it by itself on a relaxing night in sc .<ssssss>great way to get back into the swing of thing .<ssssss>very nice beer .<ssssss>
7 6 5 7 8		the schttinger dunkel be schttinger brewpub 's dark offering .<ssssss>it be a dark larger that be easy to drink .<ssssss>it pour a medium brown with very little carbonation and little lacing .<ssssss>it be brew on-site so it have a fresh flavor .<ssssss>however , i have find most german fresh brew beer to taste a little watery but still very tasty .<ssssss>this be no exception .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be light and even .<ssssss>the taste be malty but smooth and a bit of a very light caramel finish .<ssssss>
9 9 6 8 9		review from note .<ssssss>pour into a tulip .<ssssss>pour a very light straw color with lot of visible carbonation and a gorgeous three finger fluffy and creamy look white head that settle down to about half and retain nicely through out the beverage .<ssssss>the aroma be kind of funky and yeasty with a slight lemon edge to it .<ssssss>the taste be very light .<ssssss>it be nice and crisp with a biscuity flavor with a tart lemon apple finish to it .<ssssss>i think the carbonation be a but much on this .<ssssss>it kind of explode in the mouth and the carbonation be a bit on the sharp side .<ssssss>i do however really like the nice light body .<ssssss>this be near perfect .<ssssss>by biggest qualm with this be the carbonation , otherwise , this be a great example of the style .<ssssss>
8 7 5 7 8		tarry black , highlight with scarlet edge .<ssssss>top with a small tan film that eventually fade away .<ssssss>nose full of brown sugar and chocolate with trace of liquorice .<ssssss>begin with a big wave of sweeten chocolate and caramel nougat .<ssssss>roastedness seep in gradually .<ssssss>note of char .<ssssss>gain burnt bitterness and imitate espresso .<ssssss>brown sugar and molasses play bit role to provide levity .<ssssss>vanilla blossom towards the middle , then the beer collaspe into a astringent , over-carbonated finale .<ssssss>never explicitly hoppy , the flavor profile seem to disappear in the later half .<ssssss>in fact , it seem rather muted overall .<ssssss>no vinous quality .<ssssss>no alcohol be even note .<ssssss>medium-full in stature , with distract , mouth-scraping , fizzy carbonation .<ssssss>decent stout , but it fall well short of my hope and expectation .<ssssss>i be more than a bit bummed .<ssssss>more eisbock , please .<ssssss>immediate update : second bottle this evening .<ssssss>i pour one and let it sit for roughly a hour .<ssssss>carbonation be still a issue , but not as much as before .<ssssss>astringency be still present , but it begin to be replace with a more acceptable black malt harshness .<ssssss>burnt vanilla bean be more evident , especially as this begin to show its tooth .<ssssss>alcohol flex some bourbon characteristic , though remain mostly hide in strength .<ssssss>this still have its flaw , but be better than my initial impression , unless my rating be merely inversely porportional to my sobriety .<ssssss>it remain lack as a imperial .<ssssss>but i be begin to like it more .<ssssss>a pretty monster stout , all tell , i just yearn to grab more flavor out of it .<ssssss>all this need be assertiveness .<ssssss>
9 6 9 9 8		pour a effervescent amber with 4 + finger of creamy sand/tan head .<ssssss>very good head retention & lacing s : biscuitty malt & some toffee & slight citric hop as this warm .<ssssss>t : biscuitty malt , lemony & herbal hop up front .<ssssss>more herbal hop & slight tangerine & biscuitty malt as this warm .<ssssss>finish with orange peel , some pineapple , more herbal hop & some honey malt mf : medium body , soft carbonation , great balance drink very easy , skew english to I style-wise .<ssssss>i be happy to try some beer from this brewery after a 10 year break , lucky i run into this in kansas !<ssssss>
8 8 8 5 6		pour a dirty yellow and pink with a decent foamy head .<ssssss>some lace .<ssssss>not overly red or cranberry-like .<ssssss>good aroma of fresh raspberry .<ssssss>some wheat husk and yeast .<ssssss>the beer be over-sugared .<ssssss>period .<ssssss>the first thing you get be this candied element , like a faro with raspberry .<ssssss>you want this to sour out a bit , but it do not .<ssssss>some wheat beer find in this , but this one be a sweet one trick pony across the board .<ssssss>light bitter in the end , like crunch a berry seed .<ssssss>lighter body .<ssssss>enough fizz too .<ssssss>a fair disappointment , but not a horrific disaster .<ssssss>could have be worse , but pretty close to lean toward a badly make brew .<ssssss>borderline drinkable .<ssssss>
7 8 6 6 10		clear bottle .<ssssss>look like lemonade inside.almost clear with a yellow tint .<ssssss>pour into a pint glass .<ssssss>huge 3 finger head .<ssssss>the color suggest i be in for a light beer experience .<ssssss>but great look head .<ssssss>smell really good.citrus hop yeast.light corn smell but not in a bad way .<ssssss>tangy and sweet with a light sweet finish .<ssssss>almost palate cleanse in its exit .<ssssss>thirst quenching .<ssssss>this beverage need to be chugalugg on a hot day .<ssssss>go down smooth and clean .<ssssss>almost what all the bmc type beer strive for but lose out in they adjunct foulness .<ssssss>i be not sure that thirst quenching should be a priority in a beer .<ssssss>i prefer to savour fine flavor and aroma .<ssssss>but this beer do hit the spot .<ssssss>
6 8 8 10 8		nose : it be dominate by the malty sweet aroma reminisent of a dogfish 90-minute or a lagunita little sumpin ale or undercover shutdown ale .<ssssss>there be a great hoppy -lrb- citrus character -rrb- aroma .<ssssss>middle : ok , it be a regular ipa , not a imperial .<ssssss>but the alcohol and malty character really place it in between the average regular and imperial .<ssssss>this be completely congruent with southern tier 's overall line of beer .<ssssss>by that i mean they be all well think out and acheive incredible balance while still acheive a generously higher -lrb- at least 1 % -rrb- abv compare to other similar style .<ssssss>most beer label ipa be a avg of 6 % , the impressive thing about this be it acheive the flavor profile -lrb- with the slight extra maltyness -rrb- while weigh in at a whooping 7.3 .<ssssss>finish : bready due to a great balance of hoppy and malty .<ssssss>maltyness be as prevolent as be hop character at this point .<ssssss>great mouthfeel and finish that prove that this company think this beer out damn good at every point of the flavor profile .<ssssss>support southern tier .<ssssss>the taste of they beer will be sufficeint payback .<ssssss>
5 9 5 6 6		a - pour out a light copper colour .<ssssss>the head be soapy and tiny initially , and then disappear altogether after a 30 seconds .<ssssss>s - strong banana , sweet dry fruit , candy ; it be very different a very sweet .<ssssss>t - the beer and banana flavour mix well enough , but it be quite sweet and cloying on the palate .<ssssss>i also get sweet cream rice , custard , malt .<ssssss>mf - the body be lack , it be a touch too watery and thin , medium carbination which suite the character of the beer .<ssssss>o - overall this be just a pretty average beer .<ssssss>buy one and move on !<ssssss>
6 6 5 5 8		aroma be pretty bright and citrusy .<ssssss>definitely good note of lemon here .<ssssss>and the taste ?<ssssss>?<ssssss>i be disappointed .<ssssss>this may be my favorite style of beer and i generally like any beer of this style but something wrong happen here .<ssssss>there be just nothing interesting about it .<ssssss>from the beginning of the sip until the end of the swallow , it be just lemony .<ssssss>the familiar spiciness of this style be very minimal and i have to struggle to even notice it .<ssssss>it be just basically citric .<ssssss>at the very tail end some very faint wheat can be percept but it be not near enough to properly balance this beer .<ssssss>i do not mind citrus in beer and i in fact do like that , but something more interesting would be nice .<ssssss>drinkability be fairly high because it be not hard to choke down .<ssssss>that be as far as i will recommend it though , because there be far better for style .<ssssss>
7 7 6 5 7		what can i say ?<ssssss>i be very demand of this style , and this beer seem to be a `` light '' version of a wheat .<ssssss>it have the wheat taste , but somehow the volume be turn down .<ssssss>it also lack that `` dry '' wheat boldness i have come to exspect .<ssssss>this would be good introductory beer to anyone who have not try the style yet .<ssssss>
9 9 10 8 8		bottle receive a little while back , batch 77 .<ssssss>pour into a snifter .<ssssss>have a very muddy dark brown body with crimson highlight , no head , but nice lacing and nice tan bubble that appear under the top of the beer as you turn it .<ssssss>look like a old aged beer from the cellar !<ssssss>the aroma be very nice , and be quite pungent .<ssssss>would have think this be a old , cellared barleywine , but perhaps that be what it be mean to be .<ssssss>huge leather , prune , date , and scotch peat smoke come through with other add sugary and savory dark barley bread note .<ssssss>very nice , remind I of highland scotch in many way .<ssssss>the taste follow suit with big note of raisin , sugary ethanol alcohol , ton of brown sugar , date , pomegranate , and a searing smoky finish that linger .<ssssss>very interesting taste , but at this point it seem a little dominate by the alcohol , should have age this one a bit longer .<ssssss>despite a little young alcohol warming , this beer be phenomenal in feel for the style and abv imho .<ssssss>have that totally coating feel like a warm thick cask draught , just almost oily in its feel and velvety -lrb- aside from the alcohol -rrb- .<ssssss>really like this about this beer .<ssssss>the drinkability right now unfortunately will take a hit because it seem i be drinking this one too young , but it be smooth go down for sure .<ssssss>will have to get my hand on more and age it for a couple year , i see this beer be amazing with some of the edge off of it .<ssssss>
6 8 6 9 8		blue point blueberry ale bottle into glass : this beer pour reddish brown color crystal clear , white foam that dissipate quickly .<ssssss>the small be a alternate mix small of malt and blueberry .<ssssss>the taste be light malt with hint of blueberry , the after taste be a sweet blueberry .<ssssss>the sweetness seam to be delay , very nice .<ssssss>the mouth feel be water but very refreshing , it be also very sharp and bubbly on the tong but not in a bad way .<ssssss>
7 9 7 7 5		10.3 % .<ssssss>good warm up for the main event tonight .<ssssss>we use to drink a fair amount of lake superior , year ago when it be one of the few `` micro '' at the bottle shop just down the street from we old house ; kayak kolsch be once one of the wife 's favorite brew .<ssssss>this be one i have not see before this winter .<ssssss>smell be downright excellent , lot of dark sweet fruit flow out of the pint glass .<ssssss>taste do not quite follow suit .<ssssss>both the sweetness & the fruit be present , but muted , with the alcohol rush in a bit unpleasantly to disrupt they little tango .<ssssss>it be distract .<ssssss>i could not drink more than one of these .<ssssss>interesting to see what a year or two would do to this beer .<ssssss>right now it be get a fine nose on it , & i suspect if the booze be tone down a bit , this would be a winner .<ssssss>as be , it be pretty good , but not as good as the smell advertise .<ssssss>
6 6 6 5 8		pour straw yellow .<ssssss>same color it look in the bottle .<ssssss>decent amount of head .<ssssss>linger for a minute or two .<ssssss>smell grainy and metallic .<ssssss>not bad just not good .<ssssss>taste almost exactly like it smell .<ssssss>cant even taste any alcohol .<ssssss>feel thin and watery but i cant say that i honestly expect anything different .<ssssss>it be just as drinkable as anything else that this cheap .<ssssss>

8 8 3 3 3		have on tap and pour into a snifter .<ssssss>a : pour a nice golden orange color .<ssssss>there be a snall tan foam head with sufficient lacing .<ssssss>s : there be a ton of hop .<ssssss>floral and citrus hop dominate but there be a vague underlie malt character .<ssssss>mostly a bready malt .<ssssss>t : there be some floral hop character throughout .<ssssss>not as overpowering as expect .<ssssss>not much malt back bone to this either .<ssssss>m : leave a bitter bite taste on the palate .<ssssss>d : this be a good dipa and many hop head will enjoy it .<ssssss>i love hop , but do not ` love ' this beer .<ssssss>it be definitely worth a shot but i would not seek out again .<ssssss>

10 9 10 8 8		appearance - pour a caramel amber with a hint of cherry .<ssssss>two big finger of manila foam , sticky wall all over the glass .<ssssss>aroma - pineapple and orange , a caramel figginess , very nice .<ssssss>at time , even suggestion of orange and/or strawberry .<ssssss>taste - the first sip show lot of bready , caramel sweetness and a odd touch of metal .<ssssss>after 20 month , the hop be still big but without the bite .<ssssss>lot of good resiny pine , little if any push towards anything medicinal .<ssssss>abv heat be evident but complementary to the big flavor of sweet grain and grapefruit rind .<ssssss>the finish be expectedly dry , warm , with some bitter residue hang around for a good 15 seconds .<ssssss>no trace of the initial metallic flavor either .<ssssss>this be still hop-heavy , not quite as balanced as my ideal bw , but awfully good .<ssssss>mouthfeel - very smooth , pretty darn heavy too .<ssssss>carbonation hold up quite well .<ssssss>drinkability - this be a good one for sharing , but still can be a big sipper .<ssssss>just I and the cat still awake tonight , look like bogartski-ville for this one .<ssssss>
10 10 8 5 5		ah , this be a beer for real man .<ssssss>unfortunately , i be not man enough to handle this .<ssssss>i love the taste of guinness draught in a can , so i figure i should try its brother , the extra stout .<ssssss>it be beautiful pour it out , with a nice thick tan head .<ssssss>the aroma be powerful , with heavy roastiness and coffee .<ssssss>i take a swig .<ssssss>it be thicker than the draught , and have a more intense flavor .<ssssss>there be also a stronger taste of alcohol , and heavy carbonation .<ssssss>the finish be very bitter and sour .<ssssss>if you like this , more power to you , but it be a bit hash for I .<ssssss>it lack the creamy smoothness of the draught .<ssssss>

''<ssssss>drinkable like a saison .<ssssss>do not expect a standard tripel with this beer , but a very interesting expiremental hybrid that be uniquely belgian .<ssssss>

7 10 7 6 4		appearence : pour a slightly hazy copper with a tiny head that dissapear quickly and leave no lacing .<ssssss>smell : the smell be incredibly complex , with crisp note ginger , spice , coriander , orange peel , and floral hop .<ssssss>taste and mouthfeel : wow .<ssssss>weak .<ssssss>the aroma i smell be much stronger and more complex that the taste .<ssssss>the taste be basically of weak ginger and spice , with no real strength or depth to it .<ssssss>all the attribute of the aroma be present , just weak .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be slick and smooth , but a little thin .<ssssss>drinkablity and overall : not a bad brew , but certainly nothing to write home about .<ssssss>smell phenomenal , but the greatness stop there .<ssssss>it seem like it need kick up a little bit .<ssssss>this basically remind I of a weak version of weyerbacher 's decadence .<ssssss>but still , it be unique , and i always have to give prop to dfh for be original and daring .<ssssss>they always push the limit , and while it do not always work , at least they be be creative .<ssssss>worth a try .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 9		a really fantastic and unique beer .<ssssss>it be nothing like the only sahti i have have -lrb- which come in a plastic bottle with a screw cap -rrb- .<ssssss>this one be a really solid beer which could please a wide audience .<ssssss>pour a cloudy orange to amber beer with a small white head .<ssssss>it stick around remarkably well without any hop in there .<ssssss>the smell be very strong with honey , particularly the robust chestnut and buckwheat honey .<ssssss>you can smell the herb , though i be not familiar with they to say what be what .<ssssss>very earthy .<ssssss>the taste have the same note as the aroma , with a strong honey flavor .<ssssss>it be not overly sweet , though - there be some bitterness mix in there .<ssssss>it be very complex , suggest all sort of thing from blueberry to pine .<ssssss>sweet finish with a bit of a herbal aftertaste .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be surprisingly thin - the bottle say 11 % abv ... really ?<ssssss>there be hardly any hint of alcohol flavor or feel in here .<ssssss>it be a surprising and pleasant drinking beer .<ssssss>
8 8 5 7 4		chill bottle into a glass .<ssssss>purchase from k & l in redwood city .<ssssss>ok , ok ... this be `` not a session ale '' by ding 's definition , but since that have never be substantiate by any concrete proof -lrb- to my knowledge -rrb- , i will arbitrarily grant a + / - 5 % swing .<ssssss>4.2 % be now sessionable .<ssssss>a : pour a murky , glowing orange body in my hair of the dog tulip .<ssssss>i pour carefully so i could get it all in the glass in one go .<ssssss>nonetheless , it maintain a nice cap with a substantial collar for the duration of the drink .<ssssss>nice .<ssssss>s : citrus !<ssssss>it do not have the clean , bright aroma of sculpin ; it be instead temper with a dose of herbal hop , grass , and a touch of pale malt .<ssssss>this be a dead ringer for a ipa .<ssssss>t : this be extremely hoppy , as the nose might suggest .<ssssss>unfortunately , that be about it .<ssssss>there be a light maltiness , but i can not pick up anything else .<ssssss>it have a nice grapefruit , orange peel , and grass flavor go on , with the last component linger into the finish for some remain bitterness .<ssssss>m : dry finish with linger bitterness .<ssssss>the body be light-medium .<ssssss>clean flavor , but truthfully , i would liken it to `` watery . ''<ssssss>d : i be not realistically go to pay $ 4 for this again ; i buy it to show my support for the experiment more than anything .<ssssss>not a successful one in my eye .<ssssss>what ever happen to the balanced , subtle , refined english malt that ding be always talk about ?<ssssss>this be just dry-hop to death .<ssssss>
6 6 8 5 5		a - clear orange-copper with a decent non-retaining head .<ssssss>s - clean , grassy with a touch of skunk .<ssssss>first impression be as of generic pale euro .<ssssss>a touch of honey and sweetness sneak in .<ssssss>t - some one-dimensional hop bitterness , some sweetness as well .<ssssss>m - light , with perfect carbonation .<ssssss>d - a little unimpressed .<ssssss>would not drink another if i do not have em already .<ssssss>nb i have have this on tap , and i recall it be much more flavourful .<ssssss>i do not think i get a bad bottle , but i will re-review if my other one be much different .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 3		this hazy pale straw beer have no head or nose .<ssssss>the taste have herbal hop up front with a sweet bready malt base and a super dry finish .<ssssss>there be a bitter , skunky aftertaste .<ssssss>i suppose its diffferent enough to warrant a taste but i do not really recomend it , nor do i feel that it can be too representative of a antiquated brewing style as the marketing imply .<ssssss>really it be just kind of a funky tasting macro .<ssssss>bitterness , aftertaste , and syrupy mouthfeel inhibit drinkability .<ssssss>
6 2 6 2 2		well , what can i say .<ssssss>this be definantly the most unique beer i have ever try .<ssssss>however in this case it be not a good thing .<ssssss>this beer would make a wonderful cooking beer but for drink it be possibly one of the worst i have ever taste .<ssssss>the smell and flavour be just not something i want to drink .<ssssss>very hickory smoke ham .<ssssss>use to flavour a chili it would be wonderful , but like i say , as a drink the nastiest thing in the world .<ssssss>literally like drinking smoke ham .<ssssss>
9 8 8 6 7		buy this at city beer sf the day after the bottle arrive there .<ssssss>drink two day later ... very fresh .<ssssss>a - caramel orange color , look to be filter well .<ssssss>bubble very active shooting from bottom to top , decent head retention and excellent lacing throughout .<ssssss>this beer look alive !<ssssss>impressive .<ssssss>s - pine , hemp and sugared fruit .<ssssss>almost candy like .<ssssss>very fragrant and perfumey .<ssssss>the fruit would be pineapple , mango and orange but cover in sugar .<ssssss>candy so to speak .<ssssss>resinous for sure .<ssssss>big and bold .<ssssss>t - i really want to give this beer a higher rating here but i just can not .<ssssss>flavor include the citrus fruit and pine be very bold but this beer taste like a sugar bomb .<ssssss>solid malt backbone to back up the massive amount of hop in this one but it be just too sugary .<ssssss>as i mention in the smell , the fruit taste like they be all dip in a giant tub of sugar and 1/2 way into the bomber it actually become somewhat offensive .<ssssss>the first few sip be very impressive -lrb- start off good -rrb- but go downhill from there .<ssssss>good thing this be 100 + ibus to have the bitterness cut out the sugar in the finish or this one would have be way too sweet .<ssssss>m - good for the style .<ssssss>sticky and resinous , just how i like my dipa .<ssssss>bitter finish without wreck the palate .<ssssss>d - take the sugar i mention out of the equasion and we would have have a 4.5 but half way in i be get sick of the aftertaste .<ssssss>final thought - i really , really like this beer on tap from the source .<ssssss>i recommend it in that setting but i will not be purchase another bottle .<ssssss>let 's hope they get hop salad right in the bottle when it be time for that to happen .<ssssss>hop salad on tap be as good as any other dipa i have have .<ssssss>
7 9 6 8 5		this beer pour dark with a little dark creamy head .<ssssss>the smell be amazing , perhaps the best part of the stout , it be very chocolatey with a roasted malt sneak in behind .<ssssss>the beer be tasty and be not too grainy from the chocolate but become hard to drink .<ssssss>have one but plan on share the bottle with a friend or two so that you do not have to drink so much chocolate .<ssssss>
7 6 5 7 8		pour a super clear golden yellow color .<ssssss>the frothy white head be chunky and uneven .<ssssss>smell be full of tasty bittering hop and a surprisingly sweet light malt aroma .<ssssss>refreshing and fairly light , perfect for a session .<ssssss>taste be biscuity .<ssssss>hop flavor be earthy and peppery .<ssssss>this be a excellently balanced pil .<ssssss>feel be moderate to light with a slick stickiness .<ssssss>perfect for a long can session !<ssssss>
7 10 6 8 6		pour into a imperial pint glass ... 11.2 oz .<ssssss>bottle i be guess .<ssssss>it be a amber color ... not a huge head but good retention and lacing .<ssssss>the aroma be all evergreen and caramel ... delicious .<ssssss>what a fantastic smell to this one .<ssssss>the taste be good , but not as good as the smell ... the pine flavor dominate and leave a bitter aftertaste that do not compliment the front of each sip well .<ssssss>a bit lose there ... it be a good ipa but it be not quite as well round as i would prefer .<ssssss>
7 8 8 10 8		thanks to cope0021 for a growler of this beauty !<ssssss>drink it over the course of a day or two , although i probably could have finish it in the first few hour .<ssssss>it be a beer first rather than say , a juice drink , but the sharp hop be still cut slightly by the mango .<ssssss>not overwhelming , but present to prevent too much bitterness .<ssssss>the appearance be almost muddy , with a deep orange murkiness and a finger of head .<ssssss>nice lacing sustain throughout .<ssssss>the smell be primarily of mango , and some pine and other citrus .<ssssss>taste be actually hop forward , but as you swallow the mango coat the mouth and stick .<ssssss>so the first sip be the hoppiest , and the rest build the mango .<ssssss>besides the great taste , it have a solid carbonation and a medium body , but eventually the mango overwhelm - almost to the point where you do not want to repeat it too quickly .<ssssss>that be about the only knock on drinkability .<ssssss>this one be high up there on the chart .<ssssss>plus i be sure there be some vitamin c in it for you ... health .<ssssss>
7 8 4 5 6		pour from bottle into tulip .<ssssss>a - weird .<ssssss>not a traditional black .<ssssss>instead i have brown highlight shimmering at the edge of the pour .<ssssss>head be fizzy and spritzy , not a good sign .<ssssss>once settle in glass body become black .<ssssss>head be 2 finger tan .<ssssss>sink quickly to a respectable cap .<ssssss>s - alcohol warmth , blended w / bread dough up front .<ssssss>fade to black coffee and bitter chocolate .<ssssss>burnt toast .<ssssss>spicy peppercorn finish .<ssssss>t - very little taste up front , shocking give the style .<ssssss>the flavor that do come through at towards the middle be wash out and muddle .<ssssss>like a after taste .<ssssss>a good dose of alcohol warmth bookend the nothing .<ssssss>vague , coffee flavor and hint of dark malt sweetness .<ssssss>moderate noble type hop finish , odd artificial sweetness to the whole brew .<ssssss>out of whack , and tasteless .<ssssss>m - weak and thin .<ssssss>to sparkling .<ssssss>lifeless .<ssssss>d - not so much .<ssssss>water down pale version of a ris .<ssssss>with plenty of alcohol warmth .<ssssss>note - what happen here ?<ssssss>like this brewery but this be pretty far from a average ris .<ssssss>limp watery body and taste .<ssssss>never have such a light tasting ris .<ssssss>can not recommend it , even to fan of the style , which i be .<ssssss>
6 8 7 6 6		thanks to triple5 for this one .<ssssss>share with my wife with we supper , cabbage noodle .<ssssss>pour from a 330ml .<ssssss>bottle , best before 04/03/10 .<ssssss>appearance : pour a leather brown body with virtually no head .<ssssss>when hold to the light , the body become light with ruby red .<ssssss>smell : brown sugar , boozy , dark fruit and whiskey .<ssssss>taste : dark cherry minus the tartness , leather and candy sugar .<ssssss>some liquor note but not as present as in the aroma .<ssssss>mouthfeel : surprisingly not heavy though the feel be fleeting .<ssssss>as it warm , it prolong its presence and make it feel smooth .<ssssss>still a bit weak in the body .<ssssss>drinkability : alcohol heat be not too bad though i find it not great enough to get it again .<ssssss>overall : not really a great representation of a belgian ale .<ssssss>it be all right but nothing great .<ssssss>
6 6 6 7 5		this be yet another ' t ij beer that be disappointing .<ssssss>on tap this beer be wonderful and get higher ranking .<ssssss>like all they beer this one seem to be infect .<ssssss>appearance be a murky brown color with a 1 inch creamy head that stay on the beer for the rest of the glass .<ssssss>smell be sour , like lactic acid .<ssssss>a little less than the struis i recently have , but still quite obvious .<ssssss>the beer be also fruity , they ferment at higher temperature and this typical for ' t ij .<ssssss>together with the fruit and the sourness it smell like melon and pine-apple .<ssssss>taste be sour with the lactic acid again .<ssssss>less acidic and less bitter than the struis .<ssssss>there be some caramel hide behind the acidity .<ssssss>mouthfeel be medium , it be kind of sticky and somewhat sweet .<ssssss>the tap version be much better , but although the acidity be non-intentional , it sort of fit the beer , but do not get the best of rating .<ssssss>
9 8 7 9 7		i have not have many chocolate stout and this be a amazing first beer for the style for I .<ssssss>a : the beer be almost solid black .<ssssss>if you put it up to the light then you can see the dark brown , but it literally look black .<ssssss>the head be a lighter brown color .<ssssss>s : the beer have a strong espresso and chocolate scent .<ssssss>also you can smell the malt as well .<ssssss>i would seriously buy a candle that have this smell to it .<ssssss>t : amazing taste .<ssssss>the note of choc , espresso , and vanilla go very well together .<ssssss>the strong alcohol content really compliment the espresso flavor .<ssssss>personally i love the higher alcohol content beer so this one really do it for I .<ssssss>can not stress the espresso enough .<ssssss>m : the chocolate taste go down very smooth .<ssssss>however the higher alcohol content give the beer a little more bite than i would prefer .<ssssss>d : while i love the higher % , it make the beer harder to drink overall .<ssssss>i would only be able to have 1 or 2 of these and i would not want any more beer .<ssssss>this beer would be amazing as paired with a chocolate dessert , and finish with a strong black coffee .<ssssss>serve : pour from bottle into chill pint glass .<ssssss>must serve cold !<ssssss>!<ssssss>
8 5 8 8 7		brown bottle with bear on date .<ssssss>pour a medium brown with good head that last longer than most mainstream beer .<ssssss>moderate carbonation , little to no smell .<ssssss>i be impress with the taste of this beer -lrb- again compare to the norm -rrb- .<ssssss>there be a fair amount of maltiness offset with bittering hop , no flavor hop .<ssssss>mouthfeel be reasonably light and i could drink more than a few of these .<ssssss>personal note : better than average pick when there be no micro .<ssssss>i note that they use rice , which probably lighten the body of this , unfortunately .<ssssss>no corn , thank goodness .<ssssss>i would buy this if i be look for a reasonably price macro -lrb- for whatever reason -rrb- .<ssssss>
4 4 8 8 6		12oz can pour into a pint .<ssssss>no freshness date .<ssssss>but who really care with this stuff .<ssssss>fyi , my grandma 's favorite , my she rest in peace .<ssssss>not a bad look beer .<ssssss>decent lacing after all the foam die down .<ssssss>smell of corn and hop .<ssssss>nothing much more .<ssssss>very light crisp body .<ssssss>very harsh hop with a nice grain palate to take off the edge .<ssssss>very alcoholic if you ask I .<ssssss>but still the best tasting macro out there .<ssssss>it be a tough choice for cheap beer for I .<ssssss>i love schlitz but olde english 800 be a good choice as well .<ssssss>not much else out there that you can get a 30 case for less then 15 buck , but still good .<ssssss>
8 8 7 5 4		pour to pint glass .<ssssss>a : light amber yellow , fluffy white head , dissipate quickly s : resiny , grapefruit aroma t : grapefruit and lemony with boozy , alcoholic finish .<ssssss>a bit sweet m : dry d : due to the boozyness of this beer , i can not drink more than a few ounce .<ssssss>
7 4 7 8 8		appearance : cloudy orange-amber with fairly thick white head .<ssssss>smell : n/a i smell absolutely nothing .<ssssss>maybe because it be on draft ?<ssssss>taste : big on hop and big on malt .<ssssss>a very bold taste .<ssssss>nice caramel and citrus tone as well .<ssssss>mouthfeel : thick with a nice bitter aftertaste .<ssssss>drinkability : good definitely get drunk on these .<ssssss>
10 8 7 9 9		receive in the ` you aint from around here ? '<ssssss>bif from apollokim , thanks kim !<ssssss>pour into a pretty thing oversized wine glass , also extremely generously provide by kim .<ssssss>you be the best !<ssssss>bottled in november 2009 -lrb- and vintage bottle ?<ssssss>insane -rrb- .<ssssss>a - pour silky smooth out of the bottle and fill the glass with midnight black beer , but not as heavy-weight or syrupy as expect .<ssssss>build a creamy , 2-fingered , light tan head which contrast nicely with the opaque body .<ssssss>retention be great as it last for a good portion of the beer .<ssssss>one of the most outstanding thing about this beer be the lacing .<ssssss>this beer do not have just sporadic lacing or intricate web , but rather it completely cover a good 3/4ths of the glass -lrb- minus the side i be drink from -rrb- with a absolute curtain of lacing .<ssssss>it just stick there and cling for dear life .<ssssss>fantastic .<ssssss>s - the smell be much more mild and subdue than i would have expect .<ssssss>there be a light roast from the malt , and some bittersweet chocolate , but it be muted and non-aggressive .<ssssss>rather , the floral hop and spice take the forefront of the nose .<ssssss>it be unusual , consider the majority of stout rely on the malt , but it work for this beer and be a nice change .<ssssss>light and refreshing .<ssssss>t - much like in the nose , the taste be surprisingly not malt-forward at all .<ssssss>while the initial flavor be nice and bready , with the fresh roasted espresso note , it transition quickly and smoothly into the more floral side with the hop and rosemary .<ssssss>interestingly this bring I back to the stone/victory/dogfish head saison du buff , although not as excessively spiced -lrb- thankfully -rrb- .<ssssss>the malt do bring a lasting sweetness , however , which carry into the finish , which be long and pleasantly balanced between the sweet and bitter characteristic .<ssssss>m - mouthfeel be moderately light with low carbonation .<ssssss>leave a nice coating in the mouth and the finish be long and enjoyable .<ssssss>maybe would have prefer a bit more carbonation here .<ssssss>very creamy and velvety smooth , it go down easily .<ssssss>d - drinkability be high .<ssssss>i have no problem finish a bomber of this , and the unconventional profile of this beer be a refreshing change to the palate in a period where i have have quite a few porter / stout / ris 's / imperial stout .<ssssss>the flavor really mesh well together , and the lighter mouthfeel make it easily to drink and definitely change what it could be pair with compare to more heavy and syrupy stout .<ssssss>however , this also make it a bit hard to grade .<ssssss>if grade to the style , it certainly fall short of what ` traditional ' stout be , but as a beer itself , it be interesting and i really enjoy it .<ssssss>overall a great first impression for this brewery , and i have another bottle from this bif that i be look forward to , and from there i will hopefully expand further !<ssssss>
7 5 4 5 7		have some leftovers in the fridge from a recent bbq i host , so think i may as well review one of em .<ssssss>pale gold , very clear and tonne of activity from the carbonation .<ssssss>support a half finger of white head with reasonable retention .<ssssss>smell be a faint sweet corn and a touch of cut grass .<ssssss>light in the nose , but could be worse .<ssssss>a certain corn sweetness through the front half of the mouth , then a bit of 7-up citrus finish .<ssssss>fizzy , amongst the fizziest of beer i have have , make it feel more like a soft drink than a lager .<ssssss>i will be honest , this be not all that bad , but it be a hot day and i just have a burger with some slightly spicy bbq sauce , so it may be the situation help the beer .<ssssss>that be say , i could think of plenty of beer that i would rather have in the summer heat .<ssssss>

9 8 8 10 8		a dark amber body lie beneath a impressive beige head .<ssssss>the lace stick in place , but mostly slide down atop the remain thin coat .<ssssss>a candy cane , wheat malt , hop and alcohol aroma last in moderation throughout the glass .<ssssss>the rich and creamy body be caramel sweet .<ssssss>complex flavor of toffee , roasted malt , molasses and camphor be quite forward .<ssssss>spicy hop and some grapefruit bitterness blend in well with the large and deep body .<ssssss>the flavor blend more evenly as it warm .<ssssss>additional flavor reminiscent of sherry , rum and banana begin to appear .<ssssss>the omni-present alcohol , while fairly potent , never overwhelm .<ssssss>i save one for the recommend opening on dec. 12 , 2012 ... provide i live that i long .<ssssss>in the event i do not ; first come first serve !<ssssss>
9 8 4 4 5		i want so much to love this beer .<ssssss>yeti , oak yeti , and the phenomenal espresso oak yeti be heavenly ... but due to some unfortunate choice by great divide this beer will go down as a novelty not to be reproduce .<ssssss>this be the second bottle i try , to make sure i be not carry any resentment , but alas the same problem show up twice .<ssssss>the aroma of this beer and the appearance lead you to believe that this be go to be another great yeti , but the taste and mouth feel ruin the beer .<ssssss>everything start off good , but by you 5th or 6th sip the raw throat begin .<ssssss>this be undoubtedly due to the choice to `` spice '' the brew with cayenne pepper .<ssssss>by the time you finish the bottle you throat and chest be ablaze with the spice .<ssssss>there be subtle note of the chocolate that hint to what this could have be , but alas they ruin it by unbalance everything terribly by make this a strange pepper brew .<ssssss>
9 8 6 9 7		appearance : pour very dark brown , almost black .<ssssss>two finger of fluffy , dry look tan head that stick to the glass nicely .<ssssss>look like a cola in the glass .<ssssss>can not wait to taste this .<ssssss>smell : toast malt and a lot of coffee , with some sweetness come in the background .<ssssss>taste : black coffee , malt .<ssssss>the finish scream rye .<ssssss>very dry at the end , but not unpleasantly .<ssssss>mouthfeel : thinner than i expect .<ssssss>could do with some add body , to be honest .<ssssss>drinkability : can not imagine have more than one of these , though the 22oz bomber will disappear no problem .<ssssss>
8 9 7 6 7		a = nice golden appearance little lighter than a normal ipa , head be a bit lite too .<ssssss>not very thick s = smell amazing , sweetness with a light malt to it t = not the best , i would call it average .<ssssss>citrus and a bit too bitter than normal ipa .<ssssss>almost a hint of metallic to it too .<ssssss>m = lot of linger on the palatte and bit of dryness late .<ssssss>o = good not great beer , would have again though .<ssssss>b range be about right .<ssssss>
8 6 7 4 4		i be in the minority on this one big time it seem ... pour out terrific with a big fluffy head ... look very good with a nice golden amber .<ssssss>.<ssssss>cloudy with hop ... decent aroma of earthy hop and sweet malt ... where be the hop here ?<ssssss>i get some but nothing like what i should for a imperial ... disappointing ... well , i be really disappointed now ... the hop be present but they be muted big time ... this be malt heavy and while the hop arwe there , they fall way short of balance this out ... i really have high hope for this brew ... this might be past its prime or something<ssssss>
6 7 4 4 6		pour a light golden color with a large fluffy white head that be really linger .<ssssss>as the head fade it leave a decent amount of lacing .<ssssss>very potent aroma of grapefruit and pineapple with some malty sweetness note as well .<ssssss>obviously there be a lot of hoppy bitterness go on here , but there be not enough maltiness to balance it out in my opinion .<ssssss>taste be piney with slight note of honey sweetness .<ssssss>long , linger bitter aftertaste .<ssssss>improve as it warm ; express some floral hop characteristic to help balance out the resiny american hop .<ssssss>it have a lot of carbonation , too much for the style in my opnion .<ssssss>this beer do not have the depth that i be hope for and with this much alcohol it be not that drinkable .<ssssss>do not plan to revisit .<ssssss>

8 6 4 5 5		not sure about the style on this one , believe it be a apa ... start off look good , with a little something for head and a nice hazy golden amber color .<ssssss>but , all downhill from there .<ssssss>the smell be weak but there , the taste vanish at a alarming rate , and the mouthfeel be neither smooth nor springy .<ssssss>basically , its a lame duck .<ssssss>good thing its a one-timer .<ssssss>
8 6 4 5 5		a - hazy amber color beer with a off-white head that leave a lot of stick on the glass .<ssssss>s - wheat , banana , clove , yeast .<ssssss>t - not great , lot of hefeweizen taste with a lot of phenolic yeast with a lot of bitter .<ssssss>m - dry finish , kind of tough , alcohol harshness , medium body .<ssssss>o - not a good beer , could not get through much of this .<ssssss>

8 5 5 7 7		purchase at market cross pub in carlisle , pa .<ssssss>a - light black to dark brown in color .<ssssss>s-kind of like a burnt caramel smell without the sweet aroma .<ssssss>t - it have a bitter toast burnt flavor and it be ok but not as appealing as i think it would be .<ssssss>m-it have that burnt aftertaste feeling in the mouth .<ssssss>i do a couple swish in the mouth to make sure but it just have that taste .<ssssss>d - i be not sure if i will ever have this beer again unless i do the abc tour .<ssssss>its worth a try but not worth the 6-pack buy .<ssssss>
7 4 7 8 8		appearance - cloudy pour which settle into a opaque , straw appearance .<ssssss>chunk of brewer 's yeast dot the inside of the glass .<ssssss>a rather depressing , one finger head that disappear after 30 seconds .<ssssss>smell - mild scent of grain and citrus .<ssssss>taste-medium body citrus taste that compliment the wheat to create a well-balanced taste .<ssssss>mouthfeel - moderate carbonation and the lightness of the beer really wrap pleasantly around the tongue .<ssssss>this beer leave a surprising bite in you mouth when it slide down the throat .<ssssss>drinkability - though the head be disappointing , and leave little smell to detect , the beer have a great taste and be pleasant to drink .<ssssss>i would give it two beer up .<ssssss>

7 5 4 5 6		this be a beer that i do not especially care for as saison 's be not a style of beer that i really enjoy drinking , but oh well .<ssssss>it pour a average size frothy off-white head with fine-small size bubble that be mostly diminish .<ssssss>the body be cloudy with carbonation observe and a yellow-gold hue .<ssssss>the nose consist of citrus , clove and fruitiness .<ssssss>the taste be bitter and somewhat sour along with a tingly , smooth , thin and watery texture .<ssssss>it be light body and have a fair amount of lacing .<ssssss>
6 4 8 10 10		not sure why this site mark this beer as `` retired '' .<ssssss>anyway pour a lame 1/8 '' head which dissipate to nothing .<ssssss>deep dark color like a coke .<ssssss>and i be not pick up much of any bouquet .<ssssss>yet the taste be outstanding .<ssssss>some coffee , chocolate , vanilla , malt and grain .<ssssss>it head into bourbon county stout territory without the trace of actual bourbon .<ssssss>and reasonably affordable too .<ssssss>can not stand the label though .<ssssss>dirty old shoe stretcher may be a original idea or even historic to the brewery 's building but they be not really appetizing .<ssssss>
8 5 6 8 7		slight hazy deep amber with half finger off-white head , dense patchy lacing .<ssssss>aroma be sweetish malt .<ssssss>taste be toasty sweetish malt with very low fruity ester , hint of nut and dry finish with sweet citrusy aftertaste .<ssssss>mouthfeel be light with average carbonation .<ssssss>overall , the beer be quite good , but there be better beer make by this brewery .<ssssss>
6 8 5 6 6		have from a bottle at capital ale house in richmond , va pour a thick reddish color with minimal head -lrb- it might have be the waitress , however -rrb- .<ssssss>it smell very fruity , especially of fig and a bit of orange and grape .<ssssss>the taste be a bit off .<ssssss>it have a fruity , grape and orange like taste to it , and the carbonation overwhelm the palate .<ssssss>it be definitely a bit boozy , with the alcohol taste omnipresent through out the taste .<ssssss>a bit of hop bitterness come out in the aftertaste .<ssssss>the carbonation really do sort of overwhelm the taste of the beer .<ssssss>all in all its not a terrible brew , but i come away a tad bit disappointed in this one .<ssssss>
9 7 6 5 8		look very nice , pour pitch black , with a nice thick , tan head that seem to have good retention .<ssssss>do not provide a lot of lacing , but nonetheless , a very nice look beer .<ssssss>the smell be somewhat muted , a bit of roasted grain in there , a little earthy hop , a slight note of yeast , and a tiny bit of malty , almost chocolatey sweetness .<ssssss>i do not think any of the smell be distinct enough to really be please , just present enough to let you know what it be you be smell .<ssssss>the beer be very dry , almost to the point of be more of a chore to enjoy .<ssssss>but as for the other flavor , they kind of resemble the smell , in that they be not distinct enough .<ssssss>the most distinct flavor be this dry , slightly yeasty hoppy flavor , that be not the most pleasant in a big stout .<ssssss>the chocolate flavor be there , moreso than a straightforward roasted grain flavor .<ssssss>i be not pick much else up .<ssssss>this could kind of be like a iba or something , but i do not think the hop flavor be quite right for that .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be a little thin - it be a fairly dry beer , and it be a little slick too .<ssssss>the carbonation be nice , and overall , the feeling seem pretty common among a lot of imperial stout .<ssssss>you know , i be go to give this a higher score for overall than i think i would expect , but it be not a bad beer .<ssssss>i be just not sure that it stand out in any significant way .<ssssss>

9 6 9 9 10		bottle inspection : 5.8 % , a note about pale malt , and marketing blurb .<ssssss>there be a long code -lrb- 8221 -rrb- which i guess might tell I the date brew , and go on they webpage do let I know -lrb- in ie , not firefox -rrb- that it be package on nov. 7 , 2007 -lrb- sample leap day , feb. 29 , 2008 -rrb- .<ssssss>aroma : citric hop , a mix of orange , grapefruit , and a hint of ginger in the yeast .<ssssss>appearance : lightly haze copper orange body hold a creamy white head all the way through the beer with some lacing .<ssssss>flavor : a apa profile with some toffee and caramel note .<ssssss>the orange rind hop start , then the slow transition over to the toffee malt which go a bit sweeter to caramel , then a blend of all of it in the finish .<ssssss>nice profile !<ssssss>mouthfeel : moderate to low carbonation leave a creamy mouthfeel , finish be a bit dry .<ssssss>overall impression : wow , nice amber !<ssssss>great flavor in moderation and balance let both the hop and malt characteristic shine .<ssssss>i think this might be my favorite bell 's yet !<ssssss>

5 8 4 8 6		pour a stout-appropriate black but what little head it start with disappear quickly .<ssssss>that be disappointing .<ssssss>first sniff be a punch of roasted coffee but surely there be some chocolate in there as well .<ssssss>the roast vs. sweetness battle be much more evenly match in the taste , or perhaps there be just very little of either .<ssssss>i would think this be a good starter stout , since the sweetness be not cloying but it do help balance out any bite .<ssssss>`` simple '' be the best word i can use to describe the taste , but it do deliver with scorched malt with a touch of lactose .<ssssss>my biggest complaint with this beer be the mouthfeel - it be way too watery .<ssssss>however , i do love the container , and there be sure to be time i would drink this right out the can , so maybe that would be less noticeable .<ssssss>low abv make this a decent option if you be look for a non-lager kickball beer .<ssssss>
8 4 7 6 6		on-tap at bruery provision a : the pour be a somewhat clear golden color with a finger of white head .<ssssss>s : wow , not what i be expect ... the aroma start off with intense aroma of butter and booze .<ssssss>that be follow by a very floral smell , almost like honeysuckle .<ssssss>some bread and mild fruit note , perhaps pineapple .<ssssss>t : the flavor be not much better .<ssssss>still very sweet with lot of honey and a bit of overripe apple .<ssssss>a very floral quality to it , too .<ssssss>some cracker malt and a mild pepper note .<ssssss>though it be light , there be still butter .<ssssss>m : medium in body with a medium level of carbonation .<ssssss>o : i have really enjoy most of the upright beer i have have , but this be just not very good .<ssssss>

5 6 6 9 8		a : ruby red with a small head that quickly fade to nothing .<ssssss>s : like a peel orange .<ssssss>i do not pick up on the scent until i tasted this brew .<ssssss>then ... a bit of citrus baked in bread in a forest of pine and toffee .<ssssss>t : surprisingly great taste .<ssssss>grapefruit , lemon-zest , orange-peel , and pine be strong in this one .<ssssss>the fruity flavor be great .<ssssss>the sweet -lrb- but not so malty -rrb- backbone of this beer be what make it taste so great .<ssssss>it be like drinking candy fruit .<ssssss>m : slightly thick and syrupy .<ssssss>a effervescence of bubbly tingle be need in order to bring out the citrus in all its glory .<ssssss>i hate over carbonation ... but this one may be lack .<ssssss>d : the flavor be right , the abv be right , the syrupiness be the only thing wrong with this beer .<ssssss>it leave a candy-coated feeling on the tongue .<ssssss>other than that way way way drinkable .<ssssss>
8 9 10 9 7		a : somewhere between brown and garnet , with a beautiful tan , nearly everlasting head .<ssssss>s : heavy on the belgian .<ssssss>raisin , caramel , with a tinge of tart fruit .<ssssss>t : i really find this brew to be dense with flavor .<ssssss>sweet caramel and dark fruit dominate .<ssssss>`` special b '' be prodominate .<ssssss>not overly complex , but simple and very flavorful .<ssssss>slight bitterness in the finish .<ssssss>not alcoholic as i would expect ... no burn .<ssssss>m : smoooth .<ssssss>moderately thick and silky as a good quad should be .<ssssss>d : very drinkable , but certainly not a session beer .<ssssss>i like these 1 at a time , thank you .<ssssss>
6 8 6 9 7		pour a very dark color , nearly black .<ssssss>the head be nice and tan , kind of thin , maybe less than a cm , and it go away really fast , and eventually there be nothing leave at all .<ssssss>leave very little lacing .<ssssss>the smell be pretty good - lot of wood , oak , a very strong vanilla presence , maybe some caramellize sugar - a hint of chocolate .<ssssss>it have more sweetness than i expect in it , but the bourbon be able to shine through - you get a nice smell of that oaky woody alcohol .<ssssss>the taste be really nice .<ssssss>it have the nice aspect of the roasty , sugary , malty beer , combine with the nice aspect of the bourbon .<ssssss>the wood and oak be very strong , the vanilla be almost too strong , and there be not bite burn of alcohol in this one .<ssssss>a little more sweet than i expect , but that be not a bad thing .<ssssss>the body be kind of thin , much thinner than i expect .<ssssss>it be alright i guess , but i wish it be a little more full .<ssssss>the carbonation be nice , a tiny bit of a rush , not much of a presence in the finish .<ssssss>this one be surprisingly slow , especially consider how much lower the abv be than usual for a bourbon barrel stout .<ssssss>but it be fairly nice and easy to drink .<ssssss>i kind of like this as a bourbon barrel stout .<ssssss>
7 9 6 7 7		bottle pour into pint glass - light head - not very tight - disipates - i see sediment .<ssssss>smell like a crate of grapefruit - the crate and the fruit .<ssssss>big malt up front citrus hop finish - not huge though kind of watery finish .<ssssss>mouthfeel watery thin .<ssssss>drinkability - decent due to the lightness - might keep the interest beyond one but not two but i generally do not like hoppy for session beer .<ssssss>
8 5 7 8 7		a : pour a nice rich chocolate brown with reddish highlight ; generous bubbly head that leave thin delicate layer of belgian lace on glass s : complex and sweet ; spice and fruitiness ; not quite fragrant enough but what be there be good t : great balanced mixture of mostly chocolate with hint of coffe malt ; strong spicey deep flavor build to a peak mid-sip and then fade leave nice aftertaste m : smooth and a little creamy which be nice ; ultimately could be a little thiscker and creamier for my taste in the style d : a great well blended beer ; great malt presence ; nice sweetness ; great beer<ssssss>
10 4 9 7 7		carbonation my name be maudite !<ssssss>after a quick pour , the glass be fill with thick creamy head , but more impressive the bubble on the bottom of the glass be nearly as thick !<ssssss>a darker amber color that be a touch merky .<ssssss>that say back to the head , this be the creamiest thickest look stuff i have see .<ssssss>truth be tell it do not float a bottle cap that well , but one certainly do float on it -lrb- i should say the chimey glass do not make for cap float foam always -rrb- .<ssssss>light spiced sweet malt .<ssssss>not much more to say on the nose .<ssssss>i think there be some vanilla in here and well , this beer smell as `` vanilla '' as one can .<ssssss>even the macro be able to make I notice what they smell like -lrb- only you know they smell like grain and alcohol have a baby that they crap on -rrb- .<ssssss>i always enjoy belgium that do not try to over power one with overt flavor .<ssssss>i like the subtle mixed and mellow flavor .<ssssss>this however be too mellow .<ssssss>toffee and toast malt be there but certainly more subtle than i would like .<ssssss>certainly spice be present along with a bit more sweetness from the yeast , but overall this be pretty unimpressive stuff .<ssssss>this be creamy near perfect stuff in the mouth .<ssssss>i really can not express how well do this beer be here .<ssssss>the carbonation that give off that amazing head , lacing , etc do not over power and create a beer that i have to burp up .<ssssss>it be creamy and smooth from start to finish .<ssssss>i be impressed with how well craft this beer be , but it just do not taste that great and the smell be about as boring as anything can be .<ssssss>
6 6 6 4 5		pour out a hazy chestnut .<ssssss>nose of sweet toffee and tangy fruit .<ssssss>taste - sweet and syrupy .<ssssss>woody tobacco like hop .<ssssss>have a cough syrup taste from the fruit and same sort of thick viscous consistency .<ssssss>not something i look for in a beer .<ssssss>fairly hot to boot .<ssssss>this be a tough drink .<ssssss>can not say that i enjoy .<ssssss>
8 10 8 8 7		appearance : lovely bottle with some really neat art on the front .<ssssss>big & cork like all the unibroue i have see .<ssssss>it pour out nice and dark , with a decent head that subside quickly .<ssssss>residual yeast could be see , add a bit more .<ssssss>very attractive when pour .<ssssss>smell : oh god do this beer smell nice .<ssssss>cherry , raisin , yeastie bit , caramel be definitely there and maybe some chocolate ?<ssssss>only a hint of hop , but i be guess this be for balance .<ssssss>taste : wow , this be complex .<ssssss>i be tasting far more than i smell - although i would have to say the actual taste itself be good , not amazing .<ssssss>this beer be highly alcoholic , but so well make that i can barely tell in the slightest .<ssssss>fruit flavour preside over all , with the undertone of caramel , and again , that hint of hop .<ssssss>mouthfeel : again , pretty good .<ssssss>nice , dry finish , easy drinking - i can not give it more because this beer be cool border on tepid , instead of decently cold .<ssssss>still , very smooth .<ssssss>drinkability : this beer be a endeavour to drink , and i do not think i would want to go more than one .<ssssss>still , i will give it a above average for drinkability .<ssssss>note : belgian dark ale be not my favourite , although i think i can appreciate they - and this be a great one .<ssssss>well balanced , great nose , do not look bad in the slightest ... easy recommendation for anyone .<ssssss>
9 6 9 6 8		reddish dark-brown .<ssssss>like a darker `` root-beer '' color .<ssssss>lot of head , lot of lacing .<ssssss>smell like ... malt .<ssssss>not a whole lot go on , but not bad .<ssssss>taste : malty ... i can barely detect a slight hop presence in the aftertaste .<ssssss>very faint secondary flavor , but again , not bad .<ssssss>ultra-smooth and ultra-creamy texture - fair amount of carbonation .<ssssss>go down very easy , but be creamy enough where i will probably switch it up after one 22 oz bottle .<ssssss>
8 8 6 7 9		my father use to bring six pack of this stuff home on a regular basis back when i be in high school .<ssssss>at that time , new glarus be just a small microbrewery , do only about three or four thousand barrel per year .<ssssss>the beer pour with a thick white head , about two inch deep .<ssssss>i drink this beer out of a pilsner glass , so the color seem a bit light .<ssssss>it turn out to be a deep amber color , although i know that when i enjoy this in a pint it be a nice mahogany color .<ssssss>deep caramel note and hint of crystal malt .<ssssss>just a faint whiff of spicy hop in the background , but they be mostly subdue .<ssssss>the balance definitely favor the malt .<ssssss>it start and end sweet , with just a faint glimpse of hop in the middle .<ssssss>the beer be thin to medium body , even though the final gravity must be rather low .<ssssss>overall , it be definitely a session beer , but most certainly not a complex beer or one that can be savor or use to impress friend .<ssssss>
6 9 6 6 6		swiss coffee head that dissapate quickly , quite fizzy .<ssssss>dark fruit , barely a touch of caramel , bitter note , cotton candy , take you pick it have it all in the smell .<ssssss>the first drink from this brew take I back a few step every time .<ssssss>very complex but decisevely bitter in the middle to the point of annoying , and a bit too much sizzle in the carbonation almost like pop rock go off at the end .<ssssss>ok i be do with the negative .<ssssss>the positive be the warming be to the point , the sweet fruity mix be right on the money and the aroma be invite to say the least .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 5		on tap on the wingshack in farmville , va .<ssssss>pour a lazy yellow and a weak head make I wonder what i order .<ssssss>skunk smell .<ssssss>weak malt and hop .<ssssss>not very much to go on .<ssssss>crisp right off with some decent bubble .<ssssss>thin malt and hop in the taste again .<ssssss>light bitterness .<ssssss>alcohol hit the tongue when you get it warm up .<ssssss>weird dry feeling like sandpaper at the end .<ssssss>something be in the glass i think , which say a lot about farmville , va. not the best beer but passible on my scale .<ssssss>but hey you can not beat a pitcher on draft for four buck on a friday night .<ssssss>
9 6 8 10 8		aggressive pour into the specially design sam adam glass .<ssssss>nice head , darker than guinness -- i would call it light brown instead of tan .<ssssss>the beer be really dark , somewhere between typical porter and typical stout .<ssssss>hold up to the light it be a dark amber .<ssssss>head largely dissipate pretty quickly , but leave some float on top .<ssssss>very entice beer .<ssssss>would have be a perfect 5 if the head last a bit longer .<ssssss>a bit of a coffee scent ; hint of chocolate .<ssssss>not what i expect .<ssssss>i be hope for a little more of the chocolate to come through here .<ssssss>as it be , not bad , but nothing too special .<ssssss>taste amazing .<ssssss>the chocolate really come through .<ssssss>it be get a hint of sweetness like you would find in a good milk stout , but that chocolate -- - wow .<ssssss>it be really nice .<ssssss>sam adam have outdo itself on this one .<ssssss>mouthfeel be interesting -- it be not as thick as it be appearance suggest -lrb- maybe i be condition by thick and heavy stout through the year -rrb- .<ssssss>it be lightly carbonate , which perfectly accent its flavor .<ssssss>this be not what you reach for if you want a refreshing , light beer .<ssssss>this be a `` sit down and take several heavy pull '' beer .<ssssss>it be too heavy to really drink a lot of , but it would be great with a steak dinner -lrb- or , i think , mexican food , as odd as that sound -- think mole saucel -rrb- .<ssssss>probably good to bake with too .<ssssss>

9 6 7 8 8		pour from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass .<ssssss>clear and the color of slightly water down tea .<ssssss>white head on top of about one finger in size .<ssssss>very nice retention and a great deal of lace down the side of the glass .<ssssss>aroma be a bit lack .<ssssss>a touch of citrus hop and a bit of caramel malt .<ssssss>not too much else .<ssssss>i be slightly disregard in this aspect of the beer .<ssssss>pretty good flavor .<ssssss>fruity and slightly sweet .<ssssss>a very small touch of hop bitterness .<ssssss>pretty big on the malt as well , make the hop seem less apparent .<ssssss>sweet in the finish .<ssssss>a little too light in the body .<ssssss>slightly alcoholic taste as well with some heat .<ssssss>not too bad .<ssssss>closer to a ipa but good nonetheless .<ssssss>
8 8 8 10 9		pour from bottle date 10/13/2011 into crystal snifter .<ssssss>appearance : pour a fairly cloudy , dark amber color with very little head .<ssssss>should be expect for a bourbon aged wee heavy at 10.2 % abv .<ssssss>pretty dirty look , although i must say that it look a bit less cloudy and `` dirty '' than the dirty bastard to my eye .<ssssss>look like a good wee heavy .<ssssss>smell : wow , there be a huge bourbon on the front end of this nose .<ssssss>underneath there be a rather big oaky vanilla note .<ssssss>after this there be a big scotch malt reminiscent of the dirty bastard .<ssssss>taste : huge bourbon on the front end .<ssssss>its follow by a semi-sweet and semi-bitter vanilla note underwritten by a beautiful , rich , complex oakiness that hold the entire front end together .<ssssss>in the middle be a big , dirty malt bomb follow by some booze .<ssssss>i also catch some raisin and other dark fruit on the end and perhaps the slightest bit of hop bitterness .<ssssss>the blend be master craft .<ssssss>mouth : i can see where some may have want a bit more carbonation on this one .<ssssss>the carbonation be good for I , although as it warm in the glass , it seem to have more of the consistency of a liquor the glass more than a beer .<ssssss>it remind I of my experience with dfh ww in this respect .<ssssss>moderate to heavy in the mouth and very smooth .<ssssss>after about three of these , my mouth begin to numb .<ssssss>overall : simply a masterpiece .<ssssss>most people talk about kb and cb but personally i like the backwoods bastard twice as much as cb or kb .<ssssss>i think the big malt and the big bourbon be a flavor preference -lrb- and perhaps a bit less accessible than the smoothness of a stout -rrb- , but this be simply a big , complex brew that hit on all the right note for I .<ssssss>its a big boozy malt bomb that show enough restraint to provide some balance .<ssssss>quite simply my new personal favorite .<ssssss>founder have reach legendary status with this one in my book .<ssssss>\ m/m /<ssssss>

9 9 6 7 8		batch 13 , march 2011 pour from the bomber into my dfh signature glass .<ssssss>a -- dark orange in color with a cream/off-white head .<ssssss>my aggressive pour produce a 2 '' head that dissipate down to a 1/4 '' permanent head .<ssssss>it have syrupy retention on the glass .<ssssss>there be lot of carbonation bubble throughout the brew .<ssssss>s -- lot of pine and fresh grass .<ssssss>grapefruit and a syrup-like sweetness on the back end .<ssssss>t -- booze be the first thing that hit I .<ssssss>taste very dry .<ssssss>lot of hop flavor , with a ever present taste of pine .<ssssss>the problem be a real funky taste on the back end of the drink .<ssssss>i do not know what the funk come from .<ssssss>there be also a lot of booze and syrupy sweet taste to this .<ssssss>m -- whatever the funk aftertaste be , it leave the mouth feeling awful .<ssssss>the carbonation in the beer be nice and i like the hop , but i can not overcome the funk .<ssssss>o -- it be go to get a 4 from I because i think it represent the style well , but it be far from my favorite dipa .<ssssss>there be plenty other out there that i would rather have .<ssssss>it be a shame , the nose and look of this one lead I to believe it be go to be simply amazing .<ssssss>
9 9 6 10 10		i have this beer 1st on draft and then find it in a bottle at ht .<ssssss>i can not understand anyone grading this beer below a a the smell and the taste be just throw the roof .<ssssss>i have already hooked 4 other people on this beer .<ssssss>one of the few beer that i have have on tap and then find in a bottle that be even close to its draft flavor .<ssssss>this have become my new favorite .<ssssss>the only issue so far be i can not drink less than 3 of these in a session and this be truley a session beer<ssssss>
4 5 8 7 6		appearance : the alaskan ipa pour a extremely clear , almost disturbingly clear , pale yellow color .<ssssss>it look more like a adjunct lager than a ipa .<ssssss>the head , however , be big and fluffy , close to two finger .<ssssss>it dissipate very quickly though and without much lacing .<ssssss>smell : the rather thin aroma of this one allow some roasted malt flavor and a little bit of smoke to come through in a otherwise hoppy smell .<ssssss>taste : this be a very light ipa with a lot of grapefruit flavor and not a whole lot of malt to back it up .<ssssss>some pine and resin come through a bit as well .<ssssss>this be a pretty straight forward , hoppy beer .<ssssss>not much complexity .<ssssss>mouthfeel : crisp and clean , it feel more like a pilsner than a ipa , which , in my book isnt necessarily a bad thing , but it be unusual .<ssssss>overall : alaskan make a half-way decent ipa here , but it seem much more suitable for a hot night in georgia than anytime in alaska .<ssssss>it be more of a light refreshing beer than something to sip on a cool , crisp summer night orwella freezing cold night .<ssssss>
4 4 3 5 3		pour a cloudy pale straw color with no head .<ssssss>last time i check pilsner be not suppose to be cloudy .<ssssss>i have a felling this might foreshadow what to come .<ssssss>the aroma be exacly like that of every other schell product .<ssssss>thin and vaguely sweet .<ssssss>the taste be as thin as the smell .<ssssss>it be much too sweet for a pilsner .<ssssss>the mouthfeel lack any sort of crispness .<ssssss>overall , beer be a big disappointment .<ssssss>for a brewery that pride itself on its german heritage , i would think that make a quality pilsner would be a must .<ssssss>i guess not .<ssssss>
7 7 10 9 9		22 oz .<ssssss>bomber package nicely with silver foil .<ssssss>pour dark - though not completely black - with a big , dark brown head .<ssssss>smell be classic imperial stout with dark chocolate in the spotlight .<ssssss>flavor of chocolate and coffee dance in the malty foreground , and it finish with a slap of alcohol and bite of hop .<ssssss>the oak aging do not go unnoticed , and be really wonderful once this stuff warm up .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be wonderful - smooth and silky , border on syrupy .<ssssss>i could sip on this all night .<ssssss>the appearance and smell be deceivingly underwhelming .<ssssss>this be a wonderful imperial stout that i intend to add to the rotation , and i be sure a year in the cellar would make it even better .<ssssss>
9 8 8 10 9		a bottle pour from a very expensive six-pack , into a standard pint glass .<ssssss>appearance : i have see some dark beer in my life and this one be d-a-r-k .<ssssss>even the head be a medium brown , rather than the khaki often see in non-imperial stout .<ssssss>impenetrable to light , even at the edge of the glass .<ssssss>less than amazing lacing .<ssssss>smell : there be definitely some tart cherry up front , follow by cocoa and maybe a little yeast .<ssssss>good , but restrain .<ssssss>taste : absolutely delicious !<ssssss>i see some site user have have trouble detect cherry flavor , but i do not at all .<ssssss>it be right there from the beginning , a tart-but-not-puckery cherry that glide into a fudge brownie and espresso stout backing .<ssssss>the chocolate/coffee element be closer in profile to the bell 's double cream stout than the kalamazoo stout -- that be , sweeter and more round .<ssssss>no real hop or alcohol presence , which be fine with I .<ssssss>mouthfeel : there be some light tingly carb which create a mildly annoying numbing sensation around the mouth -- my only real knock on this beer .<ssssss>very creamy , sugary body .<ssssss>overall : i love this beer and will gladly purchase it again .<ssssss>another home run for bell 's stout .<ssssss>

8 9 7 7 7		dark black , thin tan foam leave a decent ring .<ssssss>roasted malt intensity with load of smoke in the aroma .<ssssss>lot of coffee plus some buttery and meaty note .<ssssss>also a bit of chocolate cake sweetness .<ssssss>the flavor yield more roasty smoke , but have very little sweetness to balance and come off a bit watery perhaps .<ssssss>very low bitterness at the end .<ssssss>the mouthfeel have a watery smoothness with moderate carbonation .<ssssss>overall i would say its a bit one dimensional with its smokiness but worth a try ...<ssssss>
7 7 9 8 7		very dark brown beer , with a finger of brown head which thin out and lace little .<ssssss>retain a bit of a skin of head .<ssssss>smell of dark fruit and sugar , prune and molasses .<ssssss>taste of more molasses , coffee , a touch of milk chocolate .<ssssss>stale grain flavor and maybe a little herbal hop .<ssssss>smooth and wet mouthfeel .<ssssss>kind of heavy and fairly well carbonated .<ssssss>nice boozy , heavy dark flavor , but a little much of all of that for sustained drinking .<ssssss>

5 7 5 5 4		it have be several year since i could muster the courage to return to philadelphia 's to drink they beer .<ssssss>i think at first that thing might have change in my absence .<ssssss>perhaps they would improve from horrific to merely disinteresting .<ssssss>this would prove to not be the case , though as it turn out , this light golden ale be among the least bad of philadelphia 's wares .<ssssss>betsy ross golden have a faint but appealing melon-like aroma .<ssssss>its taste suggest a orange-ginger melee with a misplace array of dishwater .<ssssss>the beer show strong carbonation , but not a shred of lather or lace .<ssssss>it be yellow-green , unfiltered , and dilute in body .<ssssss>a foul ale of cabbage and cardboard that leave a awful taste in the mouth .<ssssss>

6 4 7 3 8		appearance : this brew look pretty standard for the style .<ssssss>the name might lead you to believe that this beer be at least colr red , but it be not ; it be a cystal clear golden color .<ssssss>head formation -lrb- ~ 1/2 finger -rrb- , retention , and lacing be all quite poor .<ssssss>smell : again , there be not much to say here give the style .<ssssss>like many cheap macro , the aroma be a uninticing mix of grain , metal , and hop .<ssssss>the former two scent be the dominant one , but there be a little detectable hoppiness .<ssssss>it smell like you standard crappy college beer .<ssssss>taste : the taste match the nose well ; unfortunately , this be not say much .<ssssss>strong graininess and mellow hop flavor lead to a very metallic aftertaste .<ssssss>this beer have plenty of bite , but not the good kind - it make I cringe .<ssssss>the flavor also get worse as the temperature of the beer rise .<ssssss>mouthfeel : it be not as light as i be expect .<ssssss>i would rate the body as medium to medium-light .<ssssss>the beer be fairly smooth give the metallic flavor , but this be not really say much .<ssssss>drinkability : i have a feeling that this be what the beer be craft for -lrb- if you can say `` craft '' -rrb- .<ssssss>if there be a redeeming characteristic , i would say that this be probably it .<ssssss>it be easy to drink many of these quickly because you be not skimp out on any flavor .<ssssss>summary : i be not impressed , but i guess that be easy to say when you be not expect much .<ssssss>from what i read , this beer 's price point be just above that of milwaukee 's best .<ssssss>it be not too terrible if serve very cold and eat with some food , but i would not go out of my way to try this again .<ssssss>if you be just look to get drunk , then i suppose this would not be a bad option .<ssssss>i would say it be a step up from the standard college fare -lrb- keystone , natural ice , etc . -rrb-<ssssss>, but nothing special .<ssssss>

6 5 5 7 6		appearance : pour a light copper color , expect of a pumpkin ale .<ssssss>aroma : whiff of nutmeg , pumpkin , nothing too impressive .<ssssss>taste : very decent taste of pumpkin compare to other , nutmeg , and other spice , flavor hang around .<ssssss>mouthfeel : very light , somewhat carbonated for a pumpkin ale .<ssssss>drinkability : drinkable , but sustain the flat aftertaste that many pumpkin ale fall victim to .<ssssss>not a terrible choice if you be jonsin ' for some a pumpkin ale , but not a ale you should go after if you want a great beer .<ssssss>

''<ssssss>m - creamy , moderate carbonation .<ssssss>d/o - more akin to a brown ale then a belgian in my opinion , i enjoy this one .<ssssss>easy drinking but flavorful , i would take multiple of this in one sit if i be not so hellbent to get my taste bud on something new ... i be a beer whore .<ssssss>

8 10 8 8 9		thanks to khiasmus for the sample .<ssssss>very deep brown pour with a lacy but thin , tan head .<ssssss>rich aroma , lot of bourbon and coffee in the nose , thick and dark roasted maltiness taste do not quite measure up to that , as a dark roasted character take over , some coffee hint but not a lot of thickness or alcohol be present , which i be expect .<ssssss>still a nice strong stout that will not burn you sens out .<ssssss>a step up from the usual blackbeerd but not quite at the top of the heap in the ris department .<ssssss>

7 8 3 5 5		fuggle , fuggle , fuggle .<ssssss>after tasting this at this year 's big beer fest in vail , i know that i be in for a oddball ipa -- brew entirely with british hop and a defiantly anti-american ipa flavor for a american ipa .<ssssss>the concept be excellent ; the mouthfeel and bruise bitterness in this brew need work .<ssssss>nice amber with good head and carbonation ; a malty bouquet with floral overtone -- the hop complement the malt aroma as oppose to stand apart from they .<ssssss>the flavor start with a nice mix of malt and hop flavor -- earth , pepper , and flower , but the finish be too dry and bitingly bitter .<ssssss>the hop aftertaste be long lasting and overpowering , detract dramatically from any balance in the beer .<ssssss>not surprisingly , drinkability suffe due to this as well .<ssssss>overall , this be a conceptually adventurous ipa that show exactly why fuggle should not be use as a bittering hop .<ssssss>the aroma and -lrb- some of the -rrb- flavor mesh very well with the malt , help to showcase the power of crystal malt , but the bitterness be too imbalanced and overpower for this to be a recommendable brew .<ssssss>stick to trinidad 's golden ale if you be at bobbie 's in leadvega .<ssssss>
8 7 5 7 6		murky light yellow body with about a inch of white head .<ssssss>smell like orange and spice with a kind of peach quality to it .<ssssss>taste citrusy and spicey with some yeast a floral quality .<ssssss>have kind of a slick mouthfeel to it imo .<ssssss>not my favorite witbier ...<ssssss>

8 9 6 8 9		pour a beautiful orange gold with a pillowy white 2 finger head that linger nicely .<ssssss>aroma pour from the head of this beer , spicy , phenolic , ginger come off strongly to I with a hint of yeast , remind I of a belgian .<ssssss>a lot of flavor here , berry and banana , ginger , spicy and phenolic , sweet with a slight bitterness to the finish .<ssssss>have a nice creamy medium body , a little sticky on the tongue , finish a bit tart and dry .<ssssss>not a session beer by any means , mean to be sip , otherwise it be a little cloying and overpowering .<ssssss>i really like this , really out there for a hefe , well do .<ssssss>
6 5 8 8 8		pour a clear yellow color with a white head the leaf almost no lacing .<ssssss>smell be faint of orange and spice .<ssssss>taste have some honey note , but mostly citrus and spicy , with a dry finish that leave a peppery tang on you tongue .<ssssss>pretty good beer , not to heavy but have a kick and nice flavor .<ssssss>wish i have a few more to drink tonight .<ssssss>
7 10 6 7 6		appearance - very dark with slight foam lacing on the top of the glass , slight carbonation appear on the side smell - a very appease smell that seem to be yell drink I !<ssssss>drink I !<ssssss>slight smell of coffee and dark chocolate taste - some definite note of coffee though seem to lack some of what i be pick up in chocolate in the smell .<ssssss>slightly bitter after taste , though overall pretty well balance .<ssssss>mouthfeel - very soft and light in the mouth compare to the heaviness find in some stout , but easy to go down drink ability - not sure this be something i would be drink more then one of in a sit but its definitely a easy to drink stout with low enough alcohol content to make it drinkable with out a problem .<ssssss>overall would not say its a absolutely amazing beer but yet a good solid stout .<ssssss>
7 7 9 7 8		a nice drinking english pale ale , but i think the yeast character overwhelm the flavor a bit much .<ssssss>there be a big , creamy element to it , almost like a lighter version of the ringwood yeast -lrb- and san the big d -rrb- .<ssssss>it make for a very smooth drink , but the taste , while nice , be a little simple .<ssssss>
8 9 6 7 8		glass : sam adam perfect pint glass temp : cellare @ approx 45 degree pour up nice and black .<ssssss>almost two-finger of light brown foam sit on top .<ssssss>this redede to a thin , filmy , cover .<ssssss>the lacing be very good .<ssssss>it be sticky and full , almost like curtain , which be the way that i like it to be .<ssssss>man , this smell like roasted caramel milk .<ssssss>tasty !<ssssss>a wonderfully big malt presence , with a decent amount of roastiness .<ssssss>very nice lacto presence .<ssssss>good presence of caramel and english toffee note .<ssssss>mild coffee presence and a very light hint of milk chocolate .<ssssss>roasted malt galore .<ssssss>good coffee presence with dark chocolate and a light touch of milk chocolate .<ssssss>mild lacto sweetness .<ssssss>very mild hint of butterey caramel .<ssssss>the finish be fairly dry and full of more roastiness .<ssssss>medium-bodied , which be something that be common with stout , but i prefer they to be solidly full-bodied , myself .<ssssss>medium , almost mild , carbonation level .<ssssss>it achieve a nice level of smoothness , but miss the creaminess that i love so much .<ssssss>the plus side be that with its easy drinking taste and its low abv -lrb- 4.90 % -rrb- , this would be a great session stout .<ssssss>very drinkable , indeed .<ssssss>
7 8 5 7 7		pour into a pint glass with a small head that dissipate quickly.dark brown , roasted malt and coffee in the nose.dark chocolate and roasted malt in the nose , very thin mouthfeel.drinkability be good though .<ssssss>need more body .<ssssss>still pretty good , but if im gon na get a porter im gon na get something with more body.really pretty watery if you ask me.kinda disappointed .<ssssss>

7 10 8 8 6		2011 bottle about 3 week old .<ssssss>split among a couple friend .<ssssss>pour a nice light copper with decent head that fade .<ssssss>nothing out of the ordinary , appearance-wise .<ssssss>now , the scent -- - amazing !<ssssss>i could smell this beer all night long !<ssssss>amazing mix of bitter hop , tropical fruit , pine , etc , etc .<ssssss>really amazing !<ssssss>taste follow suit -- - a assault of hop and some light malt .<ssssss>can definitely taste the honey sweetness .<ssssss>very nice , but nothing i would want to have more of one of .<ssssss>have a touch of heat from the 10 % abv on the finish .<ssssss>overall a really good brew -- - glad i try it finally .<ssssss>personally , this be a beer i would call a curiosity for I vs. a essential .<ssssss>i would take a fresh two heart over this any day ...<ssssss>
7 5 7 5 4		pour a slightly cloudy , straw color with a fluffy white head that linger .<ssssss>some very faint spicy aroma but not much else .<ssssss>taste be bland with not much go on .<ssssss>some pepper note and some mild bitterness .<ssssss>light-bodied .<ssssss>a somewhat uninteresting and non-descript beer .<ssssss>
8 7 9 9 7		unusual beer ; border on be it genius or be it just be exteme -- -- anyway , this beer pour with a nicely textured light tan head and some lace .<ssssss>opaque .<ssssss>intense ripe fruit with some chocolate , lot go on - maybe too much .<ssssss>not too sure about the ripe dark fruit match with the coffee either , offhand i would proly choose another .<ssssss>interesting exercise in extremeism .<ssssss>
5 7 7 5 4		the brew pour a pale straw-yellow color with only a minimal head .<ssssss>very quickly the foam die down to a small ring leave no real lacing to speak of .<ssssss>the smell be interesting , plenty of ipa note of hop with a predominance of floral and grassy note .<ssssss>the taste be quite disappointing for a stone brew .<ssssss>while there be a balance of malt and hop , the hop note be anything but attractive .<ssssss>instead of a bold , active hop note there be some light , lavendar floral taste .<ssssss>not at all what i would expect from a american ipa .<ssssss>i usually praise beer that be balanced and this one certainly have a good bready malt body to balance the hop but there be really no hop to balance .<ssssss>mouthfeel be pretty good , it be a medium body brew with enough carbonation to clean the palate between sip .<ssssss>there be no oily or astringent aftertaste to detract from the experience .<ssssss>as for drinkability , i think it speak volume that i regret have buy a six pack of this before try one .<ssssss>i be about halfway through and my opinion have not change - this just be not a interesting ipa .<ssssss>
6 10 6 6 6		this beer pour with a watery caramel color and slight head which dissipate quickly .<ssssss>i experience a interesting smell of sweet candy cherry .<ssssss>smooth mouth feel , the taste be light upon first sip follow by a mellow sweet tart mixture with a very carbonated finish .<ssssss>this beer be decent for drinking , and the summer 24 pack can be nice if you be have a group of people over due to the mixture of several different beer .<ssssss>all in all a nice beer for a summer barbeque due to it not be overpowering , and be quite smooth .<ssssss>

8 8 7 9 7		a - hazy , golden color with a thin white head .<ssssss>s - subtle blackberry scent .<ssssss>t - very smooth for a wheat beer ; blackberry flavor just right ... not too overpowering .<ssssss>d - strike I as a really good summer beer - light enough to enjoy a few pint , but also quite flavorful .<ssssss>overall , i think this be sam adam ' best fruit-flavored offering , insofar as it incorporate a subtle taste and be very drinkable .<ssssss>

4 4 2 4 2		pour from a 12 oz can into a 5 inch tall round bottom mug .<ssssss>this brew be as pale as a wheat field before harvest and crystal clear with light little bubble race to the top for air .<ssssss>it smell like cream corn with a finish in the nose of rub alcohol .<ssssss>taste be grain , and a little butter top wheat bread on the back of the toungue finish with some strange sticky corn note from the smell .<ssssss>mouth feel be watery at first but then a dryness take over and leave you mouth feeling very slimy and sticky .<ssssss>i would not drink this bad boy unless it be the only thing a buddy have on hand after a hard day work .<ssssss>

9 3 4 3 4		i appreciate this brewery 's ingredient inventiveness and willingness to take risk , result in tremendous beer such as cherry chernobyl and knuckle sandwich .<ssssss>unfortunately , blackstrap porter be more a foot on the proverbial banana peel than a success story .<ssssss>appearance be promise ... the rich dark chocolate color you would expect with a minimal top head and thick , light brown lacing that stick stubbornly to the glass before break up into thousand of tiny bubble and dissolve .<ssssss>sadly , this be the last nice comment i can muster for this beer .<ssssss>the nose be difficult to find .<ssssss>i have to jam my grill halfway down the mason jar -lrb- how beer be serve in they tasting room -rrb- before catch a whiff of something musty .<ssssss>after sit with that jar affix to my face for several seconds , i be convince there be possibly something molasses-like go on .<ssssss>as the beer grow warmer , the scent of blackstrap be easier to pick up .<ssssss>the initial cold taste and feel be both thin ... almost nothing happen here .<ssssss>at room temp , the molasses flavor wake up slightly , with a small top of ammonia .<ssssss>there be a bit more to say but i do not like to waste too much time drinking or review sub-par brew .<ssssss>but that say , i find myself grateful that this brewery take a occasional risk , pave the way to all the other tasty beverage i have sample from bootlegger .<ssssss>

7 9 8 7 7		pour from a 12oz .<ssssss>bottle into a sam adam perfect pint .<ssssss>a : moderate pour create a semi-coarse 1.5 finger light coffee head with poor retention .<ssssss>beer be a dark , near opaque amber .<ssssss>lacing be stringy and spotty but with little cling .<ssssss>s : coffee , caramel , chocolate , butterscotch , honey , cream and lactose .<ssssss>very sweet and entice nose that make my mouth water !<ssssss>t : sweet coffee and toffee opening .<ssssss>toast dark malt mix with chocolate .<ssssss>slightly sour lactose towards the middle .<ssssss>bit of booziness as malt fade .<ssssss>sudden finish that be very clean and leave a waxy , bitter chocolate coating on the tongue .<ssssss>m : medium body , low carbonation , and smooth and silky .<ssssss>slight liveliness on the tongue before finish very clean with a slight aftertaste .<ssssss>d : this beer smell much better than it actually be .<ssssss>nice feel and good complexity but the nose build up the character so much that i feel like when i actually get to the beer , its a bit of a let down .<ssssss>still , worth try as it be a solid porter with a sweet twist that one seldom come across .<ssssss>

5 7 8 6 6		this be a very different beer and difficult to compare , as it do not seem necessarily fair to compare the style to typical american porter .<ssssss>lack luster appearance .<ssssss>can see the smoky texture inside .<ssssss>smell and taste be similar .<ssssss>just smoke and nut .<ssssss>that all i can pick up .<ssssss>mouthfeel be on par with where it should be .<ssssss>drinkability be average .<ssssss>
8 7 5 7 6		for the record , this be not a one-off beer .<ssssss>i be review the 2007 release , and its list as currently on tap for growler fill at the brewery .<ssssss>also for the record , pumpkin/pumpkin pie spice beer be not my thing .<ssssss>im go to admit that this beer be fairly tasty in have one a year sort of way .<ssssss>the pumpkin and spice flavor be there , but be not over the top , and meld nicely with the somewhat sweet , and mildly roasty chocolate flavor of the base porter .<ssssss>the aroma be exactly what you would expect roast , chocolate , pumpkin , and spice .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit lack for a beer of 7.3 % abv , with all of that stuff add .<ssssss>also lack in fact , completely absent be the presence of perceptible alcohol .<ssssss>while this be a significant feat , i dont find it a positive one .<ssssss>a little alcohol burn , or a bit higher hop rate , would have give this beer a edge it just seem to be miss .<ssssss>all in all , no regret have split a bomber of this .<ssssss>also no regret have only buy one .<ssssss>

8 8 9 7 6		pour a impressive deep mahogany tone complement by a very thin cream tone head .<ssssss>very deep color , musky almost opaque , i would dare to say this one be unfiltered .<ssssss>in the aroma i be get burst of brown sugar along with a rediculous amount of malt follow by plum , raisin , and other pleasant fruit tone .<ssssss>the taste be one huge malty plum brany like flavor , a wonderful malt monster that bring joy with it be full but not overly sweet profile .<ssssss>as it warm the sweetness become a little more domineering .<ssssss>big robust mouthfeel , beefy if you will provide a creamy texture in this one full bodied beer .<ssssss>drinkability well this beer be desireable for I again in the future , but coud not handle more than two of these in a week i consider this a great representation of a barleywine , but i prefer more hop .<ssssss>

8 7 9 7 7		presentation : 12 oz brown bottle with no freshness date .<ssssss>appearance : very fine bubbly lace stick all over the place .<ssssss>clear and pale tawny color .<ssssss>smell : faint citrus and grassy hop with hint of tobacco .<ssssss>dusty diacetyl with some honey like sweetness from the malt .<ssssss>taste & mouth feel : expressively smooth with a layered medium body .<ssssss>pungent hop within the pale malt base , which get lose though the diacetyl do as well .<ssssss>hop bitterness linger for a good while with mild citric and earthy tone .<ssssss>drinkability & note : a above par english style ipa .<ssssss>middle of the pack from what i have experience but good none the less .<ssssss>

8 4 5 5 5		pour a bright gold color , a bit hazy , and with a nice white head .<ssssss>aroma be off , and seem funky .<ssssss>smell sweet , vegetal , sour , and with a touch of citrus .<ssssss>this seem really off for a dipa .<ssssss>taste be not right .<ssssss>this taste mostly like ground up aspirin tablet .<ssssss>really gritty , bite , and bitter ... with not much else go on .<ssssss>there be a bit of citrus hop , but not much in the way of malt .<ssssss>really do not sit well in my mouth .<ssssss>i do not really care for this one .<ssssss>bad bottle ?<ssssss>too old ?<ssssss>mouthfeel be ok , but this be not really something i want linger in my mouth for very long .<ssssss>drinkability be below average .<ssssss>one of the worst dipas i have have .<ssssss>i dot think it be a very good beer , it just seem like the brewer go big , and do not think much about the taste .<ssssss>this be like swallow a bitter pill ... no thanks .<ssssss>i can think of countless other beer in this style that i prefer to this one .<ssssss>i do appreciate that brandonman63 give I the opportunity to try this ...<ssssss>
9 8 10 9 8		appearance : thin light beige head sit atop a body that mix light-brown with a deep copper hue .<ssssss>transparent and gorgeous .<ssssss>smell : spicy note come forth and be balanced well with the malty character .<ssssss>hint of a citrus hop be find in the back and also add pleasantly to the aroma .<ssssss>taste : wonderful mixture of malty , spicy hop and citrus hop note .<ssssss>balance be also noticeably nice and with the style guideline a emphasis on the spicy flavor be note .<ssssss>mouthfeel : wonderful balance all over the pallet and each taste-bud .<ssssss>citrus and bitterness come to the front of the tongue , while the malt and spice flavor cover the back of the mouth perfectly .<ssssss>the slightly raise abv can give cause to the minor warmth in mouthfeel .<ssssss>drinkability : the brew have a overall great appeal with its abundance of nicely combine flavor .<ssssss>the slightly high abv may make it difficult the polish off a sixer , however many will try and few will win .<ssssss>
2 7 2 6 4		a - zero head .<ssssss>not look good so far .<ssssss>the body be a hazy orangish-yellow .<ssssss>s - sweet malt aroma with hint of mango .<ssssss>t - let I start out by state it will be very difficult to get a real gauge of the taste here because this beer be completely flat .<ssssss>i will however do my best to distinguish that flavor ever though the texture be awful .<ssssss>it have a sweet malt flavor follow by a finish of hop .<ssssss>m - like i say , there be nothing here that help this beer .<ssssss>it be flat and i be not go to finish it .<ssssss>~ i will get another and hope that it do not fail I again .<ssssss>
7 6 4 5 6		very disappointing beer ... a : dark dark brown s : smell of nut and small amount of coffee t : vanilla be hardly there , get more of a coffee taste but nothing very strong .<ssssss>m : too much carbonation for I d : could be drinkable but not really worth it for the lack of flavor would not buy this again ...<ssssss>
7 6 7 5 7		500ml brown bottle , pour into a nonic pint pour with a amber body .<ssssss>patchy slightly off white head with pretty poor retention , fizzle out to form a slightly disappointing scum .<ssssss>some lacing but pretty minimal smell , very little pungent aroma .<ssssss>some mari otter and a little bit of crisp biscuit character .<ssssss>little bit of fresh mash and a tiny touch of slightly sour english hop taste , biscuity malt and a fairly thin profile .<ssssss>some very slight almost sweet hop character but its miniscule and be disjointed , very little actual bitterness .<ssssss>i have come to expect little from this brewery and this have only fuel the fire ... , bland and uninspiring .<ssssss>nothing particularly redeeming to be honest , a pretty poor ale<ssssss>
8 6 6 4 5		a-golden yellow body with thin white head that disappear quickly and leave a thin ring of lace .<ssssss>s-sweet maltiness and the smallest waft of hop .<ssssss>t-instant corn-like taste to I .<ssssss>other say they have taste hop in this brew but not I ... maybe my hop threshold be too damn high anymore !<ssssss>?<ssssss>this be a very disappointing brew to I .<ssssss>m-medium-ight body and bit sticky with a slightly sour finish .<ssssss>d-not really into this one .<ssssss>drinkable but barely .<ssssss>i want more crispness and hop ... .<ssssss>less of that damn corn flavour ... quick , someone get I a two-hearted !<ssssss>
6 8 8 9 7		a - pour into a slightly cloudy straw colour into a tulip glass after warm for a hour or so .<ssssss>vigorous carbonation .<ssssss>two finger white head rapidly dissipate .<ssssss>no lacing to speak of .<ssssss>s - lemon spice t - smooth yeasty lemon , clove and orange .<ssssss>peppery upfront with a yeasty alcohol aftertaste .<ssssss>m - a bit sharp around the edge .<ssssss>d - nice .<ssssss>very drinkable but for the alcohol creep .<ssssss>the yeast would get to I a bit .<ssssss>i be hope this would rival the on tap version .<ssssss>not to be sadly .<ssssss>
6 8 7 6 6		pack date 5/24/11 best by november 2011 pour a dark brown color , not much of a head nor any cap on top , nothing for lace either , body seem thin from the pour , more like a cola without the intense fizziness .<ssssss>the smell actually have a nice deep roasted malt aroma that dominate the nose , much stronger than i would have though , slightly sweet with a cocoa presence .<ssssss>taste be not overly milky or sweet , the roasted malt be the star here , not overly complex but fairly straight forward , light dark chocolate bitterness in the aftertaste , not overly thick and can seem thin at time .<ssssss>a fairly average stout , not bad if look for a budget stout except this be not cheap enough to be consider budget in my book .<ssssss>cute label though .<ssssss>
9 8 9 10 8		pour a deep brown / almost black color , with a rich 3 finger tan head that start with large rocky bubble before settle into a half-finger coating of tiny bubble .<ssssss>smell be not that strong , some acidic coffee richness and a hint of bittersweet chocolate .<ssssss>delicious , full flavor - more than i expect .<ssssss>rich , roasty chocolate malt balanced nicely with a light crisp hoppiness and a touch of caramel sweetness .<ssssss>richer mouthfeel than i originally anticipate - on the ris side of the stout world .<ssssss>something this flavorful be always go to fare well on my drinkability meter ... but have more than one bomber of this could be a bit much .<ssssss>
6 9 7 6 5		appearence : pour a hazy dark orange with a nice , fomay beige head .<ssssss>smell : the hop be the first smell , and those be citrusy and floral with a nice malt backing that round it off well .<ssssss>taste and mouthfeel : the taste be suprisingly malt focus with a strong yeast flavor to it .<ssssss>the hop be appearent but not near strong enough for a pale ale .<ssssss>taste more like weizenbock to I than a pale ale .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be meidum bodied .<ssssss>drinkability and overall : fly dog brew pretty much all seem to have that yeast flavor that be way too out of control .<ssssss>it take what could have be a excellent apa and turn it into a mediocre beer .<ssssss>
5 9 8 8 6		pour a hazy orange/brown with a bunch of yeast , and a thin head that drop immediately .<ssssss>smell of banana , kiwi , and strawberry dominate , with some bread yeast aroma .<ssssss>taste a lot like it smell , banana hit I right away .<ssssss>but i have to say the taste suffer a little , because the alcohol bite be really pronounced , and a bit overwhelming .<ssssss>i think if the heat on this one cool down a bit , this would be a bit more drinkable .<ssssss>mouthfeel be good , thin and a little chewy , nice carbonation .<ssssss>i would probably not drink this in a normal situation , but i may try it again sometime to see if its any better the next time .<ssssss>i will not say this be bad , but the alcohol bite be way too much for I for the style .<ssssss>tone down , this would be a refreshing beer .<ssssss>edit : i should have be more patient .<ssssss>as this glass warm , the alcohol bite disappear , and the beer become much more balanced .<ssssss>as a result i take my taste rating from 2.5 to 4.0 .<ssssss>
7 5 8 5 6		a : pour a hazy orange with some rise carbonation .<ssssss>huge head on this one , but the lacing do not stick .<ssssss>head retention be good .<ssssss>s : it seem i be in the minority , but i be not pick up as much citrus as other who have review .<ssssss>i be get a lot more grassy and herbal note , with some pininess .<ssssss>the only citrus that i detect be a little bit of grapefruit and maybe some mango t : again very grassy and earthy in quality with some mango grapefruit and pine .<ssssss>also quite a bit of sugar be noticable as well .<ssssss>a bit of scallion seem to be present as well .<ssssss>maybe i be just use to more intense citrus note or my palate be off but i be have a entirely different experience than other .<ssssss>i also feel that there be way to much a a sugary character present .<ssssss>m : possibly the most remarkable aspect of this beer be that there be no heat present .<ssssss>there be a bit of a rough quality to it , but the body be nice .<ssssss>d : i really hope i get a bad can because i have high expectation for this beer and really want to like , but it miss the mark for I .<ssssss>this be one i would gladly review again to proof myself wrong , but i do not get the citrus aspect that other seem to find .<ssssss>for now though , this will have to stand<ssssss>

8 8 10 9 8		peninsual porter , as it be know at my local haunt , look pretty good in the glass .<ssssss>not too different from any other porter or dark beer such as stout .<ssssss>the primary difference come in the mouthfeel , come mainly from weight .<ssssss>where many stout be precisely that , peninsula porter retain a certain lightness that differentiate it .<ssssss>it be lighter and have a interesting carbonation that keep the entire mouth , not merely the tongue , interested .<ssssss>fankly , it tickle just a little bit .<ssssss>the taste be highly remniscient of berry .<ssssss>berry , with a wooden aftertaste that be not at all unpleasant .<ssssss>this piece be a bit heavy to drink all night , i recommend it as a starter , but then move on to lighter thing , such as gradiate up through red ale to pilsner .<ssssss>
7 7 8 8 5		a = very cloudy , golden amber color , pour with a slight head that stick around shortly then rimm the beer be = alcohol , fruity t = fruity , sweet , alcohol m = nice , slight carbonation , smooth , oily d = not very , too sweet , and too potent .<ssssss>a beer that be good , but in my mind be mean to be savor on occasion .<ssssss>

9 6 8 8 9		a very pretty beer .<ssssss>pour a rich mahogany color with a off white head that leave some decent lacing on the glass .<ssssss>scent be strangely weak here .<ssssss>what one can smell be not bad by any stretch but it do not tell you much about the beer .<ssssss>some malt , some hop and a good hit of booze , maybe some raisin after lot of warming .<ssssss>flavor be far more forward .<ssssss>a rich smokey , malty realm to be experience in here .<ssssss>rum raisin ice cream come to mind .<ssssss>plenty of sweetness be in there as well as a dry bitterness that keep the sweet from be too sticky .<ssssss>hella drinkable for the style .<ssssss>as some have say before i could see people drink a few of these and then fall off of they chair for not know how strong this stuff be , alcohol wise .<ssssss>this beer be a good way of satisfy a malt craving .<ssssss>
8 6 9 8 6		on-tap at city beer .<ssssss>i be not sure how to judge this one , as i be not familiar with the style .<ssssss>i just compare it to a pilsner .<ssssss>a : pour a clear pale straw color with a inch of off-white head .<ssssss>leave thick clump of lace down the glass .<ssssss>s : honey , grassy and lemony hop , and a little bit of grain .<ssssss>a broad and rich scent , but it be a bit weak in pungency .<ssssss>t : a refreshing lemon-honey flavor with grassy and floral hop .<ssssss>some grain and earthiness be find toward the end of the flavor .<ssssss>a clean and inoffensive flavor , really good for the hot day that i walk into the store .<ssssss>m : light-bodied .<ssssss>nicely crisp carbonation .<ssssss>d : kind of a conundrum .<ssssss>this be a pretty good summer beer , but i have only see it on tap , and i do not go to bar to drink light stuff .<ssssss>i guess if i see it on a really hot day , i would get it .<ssssss>but for my usual pub crawl , this be go to be skip .<ssssss>
7 9 7 6 5		pour into my snifter , this beer be black with dark brown highlight .<ssssss>the brown head appear for a minute but quickly sink to a ring around the glass .<ssssss>upon first sniff i be get a lot of licorice .<ssssss>woah , it be like open a bag of twizzler !<ssssss>there be a bourbon undertone with some vanilla that be kind of fruity .<ssssss>a bit of a woody smell in there too .<ssssss>it be pretty different than i be use to .<ssssss>interesting !<ssssss>first sip say bourbon to I .<ssssss>it glide silently across my palate then ninja vanish , leave only a alcohol-tinged wisp of figurative smoke in its wake .<ssssss>that be really all i taste at first be bourbon .<ssssss>some vinous , dark fruit flavor make a appearance here and there but this be all about the bourbon ; kinda one-dimensional .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be thin for a imperial stout , not at all thick or chewy .<ssssss>seem like the finish gravity be low , but what do i know .<ssssss>when cool the beer glide effortlessly from the glass to my stomach , but as it warm some prickly alcohol impede the journey , take little stab at my tongue on the way through .<ssssss>once it reach it be final destination in my belly thing start to warm up from the alcohol which become more noticeable .<ssssss>i be not go through this as quick as i thought and i be not exactly chomp at the bit to drink another .<ssssss>there be some potential here ; i have another bottle i will set aside for a year or two and see how thing develop , but as it be the bourbon be overpower and the base beer do not exactly hold its own .<ssssss>
9 8 6 6 8		pour from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass .<ssssss>clear amber color , one finger cream color head with decent retention and lacing .<ssssss>smell of rise dough - very yeasty - like walk into a bakery - with little in the way of floral hop note .<ssssss>smooth on the tongue - on the verge of be creamy .<ssssss>predominance of biscuit malt and roasted nut with just a trace of hop ; minimal alcohol warmth .<ssssss>long bready finish .<ssssss>very slight sourness characteristic of belgian yeast .<ssssss>very drinkable .<ssssss>flavorful but never overwhelming.overall very unique .<ssssss>i have become quite partial to the biscuit malt and nutty flavor of this beer when i tire of some of the hoppier amber ale out there .<ssssss>too biscuity and sweet to have all the time , though .<ssssss>
7 8 8 5 5		serve at 52 degree in a goblet , need to be serve warmer than this maybe 58-62 degree a. golden amber s. spice butter , lite malt t. dough , lite malt a slight spice then just fall and leave nothing to reside m. sringy , zealous d. i think that this beer have a good smell and get my hope up .<ssssss>i be let down at the end since there be no finish .<ssssss>

9 7 10 8 9		head 's a off-white with a amber hue , the body be a dense brown with red highlight .<ssssss>remind I of gulden draak .<ssssss>spiced nose with note of ginger , nutmeg and cocoa .<ssssss>maybe a little too pungent at time .<ssssss>a toffee flavor hit right up front , a caramel overtone and bread .<ssssss>a almost nutty-brown sugar in the middle keep up by a toast malt body , compliment by a molasses/vanilla on the very , very tail end .<ssssss>complex beer that about cover the spectrum , however a little bit of that 9 % come through toward the end .<ssssss>the medium body be perfect .<ssssss>texture of a chimay blue , smooth without be oily .<ssssss>

6 4 5 6 5		this beer pour extremely clear and copper/red in color with a dense , off-white head that fade quickly .<ssssss>the aroma be severely lack .<ssssss>i do not smell anything here that i might not smell in a macro , unfortunately .<ssssss>i detect faint grassy tone and perhaps a bit of corn , despite the fact that this be a all-malt lager .<ssssss>the taste be not bad , but be not as good as it could be , either .<ssssss>hint of roastiness and spice work well with the flavor , but it be far more diminish than i would hope for .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be weak and watery .<ssssss>if the bitterness be not there , i do not think i would want to drink this .<ssssss>overall , not as good as what i have come to expect from schell , but still better than most macro .<ssssss>
10 9 8 9 4		serve on tap at the great taste of the midwest .<ssssss>black pour with a small tan head .<ssssss>vanilla and chocolate dominate the aroma .<ssssss>flavor be vanilla , coffee , toffee , caramel and maple syrup .<ssssss>viscous , syrupy sweet , big , boozy .<ssssss>ouch .<ssssss>3 oz be plenty but man be it good .<ssssss>

5 4 6 4 7		i decide to try this while out to lunch recently .<ssssss>i be under the impresssion that this be suppose to be the better of the two major mexican beer , the other be corona of course .<ssssss>now i can not figure out why .<ssssss>i take this straight from the bottle so it should get a rating of 3 even , but i be subtract half a point because there be absolutely no way a beer this weak could possibly have the right color for the style they claim -lrb- they say its a vienna red lager , every indication i get be of a american light lager -rrb- .<ssssss>and to put this in perspective , sam adam boston lager be also a vienna style red lager .<ssssss>i defy anyone to sample this next to a sam adam and claim they both correctly fit the same style .<ssssss>smell be of alcohol and tiny bit of sour hop .<ssssss>taste be of sour hop , alcohol , the faintest wiff of grain and get this : the bottle .<ssssss>almost everyone who drink beer have notice the taste a can impart , but how weak do a beer have to be to taste like the glass bottle it come in ?<ssssss>as weak as do equi apparently .<ssssss>eventually , when i be almost at the bottom of the bottle a tiny bit of hop bitterness and adjunct grain flavor come through , but for at least 3/4 of the bottle , a little bit of sour , a little bit of alcohol , and a lot of carbonation be the main flavor .<ssssss>mouthfeel be very watery and fizzy .<ssssss>miller lite have less carbonation .<ssssss>drinkability lose some point because this beer be just so weak you may as well give up and drink water .<ssssss>really it be harmless though , it be hard to find anything objectionable because the lack of taste be so complete .<ssssss>if i be go to take a guess at the recipe for this beer i would say : drink half to 2/3 of a michelob light .<ssssss>leave it out till it get warm and flat .<ssssss>fill the bottle back up with seltzer water and chill .<ssssss>that would probably be pretty close to do equi .<ssssss>the weakest tasting beer i have ever have .<ssssss>it taste even weaker than coor light or miller lite .<ssssss>though it still compare favorably to coor light because at least what little flavor it have be not bad and i can tell there be some alcohol in it .<ssssss>

6 4 4 2 4		beer have a red color to it , and not much of a head on it.the head it do have disappear quickly .<ssssss>very faint smell to the beer -lrb- faint caramel smell -rrb- very light body beer with not much flavor at all , very water down .<ssssss>a water down almost flat beer , with not enough flavor to make you want to drink a second one.you be better off drink a light beer from one of the bigger company , at least that way you will get some sort of taste and flavor .<ssssss>
8 7 10 8 10		brew 01/20/09 this brew pour a pitch black -lrb- no light goin ' through this one -rrb- with a small amount of deep caramel color head that fade quickly .<ssssss>the smell be subdue in this , maybe because it be a year old .<ssssss>the beer smell of chocolate with roasted bread character along side , a bit of dark fruit come through but mostly this smell like rich chocolate , both sweet and bitter .<ssssss>glug glug glug the flavor have to be one of the mellowest for a ris i have come across .<ssssss>this flavor be big chocolate malt that come across on a very light body , much less heavy than expect .<ssssss>big on sweet milk chocolate in addition to a back end that resemble dark bitter chocolate .<ssssss>at 11 % or more now the alcohol be very well hide .<ssssss>i have to imagine it be the wild yeast that set this apart with its light body and great drinkability .<ssssss>the flavor i be get normally come from a beer that be thick as syrup -lrb- not so literally -rrb- .<ssssss>but this be very light body and drinkable for the style .<ssssss>
6 8 6 9 8		pipeline porter be brew in the american porter fashion and be a very mild and smooth 5.4 % abv .<ssssss>the porter be not heavy nor be it a really bitter porter therefore with a rather quaffable abv the beer be a nice offering for a evening where you might want to have more than just one beer .<ssssss>the pipeline porter pour a pretty rich brown color with some amber hue mix in .<ssssss>though some porter maintain a almost stout-like darkness to they , this porter have a bit of translucence to it however it be by no stretch of the imagination a weakly light porter .<ssssss>pour from a bottle into a pint glass there be a minimal amount of head present in the pour but a beige lacing be leave along the side of the lass while the beer be be enjoy .<ssssss>a decent amount of carbonation be present in the beer once pour but that just do not seem to translate to there be much head to this porter .<ssssss>as expect , the aroma to this offering be a nice one with rich tone of kona coffee smack you in the nose immediately .<ssssss>the deep and roasted coffee aroma work itself out of the pint glass and be present throughout the offering .<ssssss>roasted malt and dark chocolate also be note in the nose and for a porter the nose be exactly what one would hope to find in a really quality brew .<ssssss>as expect , the roasted malt and brilliant coffee nose come be pack into the taste , as well , and the complexity of the porter be nicely round .<ssssss>what be great about this coffee porter be that the brewer have focus on make this equally focus on be both a porter and a coffee porter .<ssssss>while some brewer fail when it come to artfully infuse coffee into they porter , kona have do a nice job and ensure that the coffee come through in a big way .<ssssss>the same roasted and dark note in the nose be match by a sharp , yet not bitter , coffee flavor and the taste be a real winner .<ssssss>the fine balance of ensure a certain coffee bite be well meet here without make the beer become either too acrid or metallic in nature which some coffee can end up do while in the brewing process .<ssssss>the mouthfeel for this porter be rather good but as note in the appearance , there be a little bit of a looseness to the beer and it be not a heavy and overpowering sort of porter that will weight you down .<ssssss>for a porter it be a little light in term of actual mouthfeel but the brilliance in the taste certain make up for that shortcoming .<ssssss>to I , there be a good drinkability to this porter but mind you porter be not for everyone .<ssssss>if pair with the right meal , perhaps either a rich pork dish or a barbecue meal , this beer would be a ideal dinner time match to just have a beer with the meal .<ssssss>that say , with a relatively low abv and a good taste pack into the bottle , porter fan would have no problem in have this beer serve as a session beer .<ssssss>

7 7 7 9 8		12 oz .<ssssss>bottle that i squirrel away on a trip to the midwest over the holiday .<ssssss>not sure if this one benefit from age or not , but i want to give it a whirl .<ssssss>appearance : very dark brown , almost pitch black .<ssssss>i get absolutely no head on the pour , but the body be very viscous look .<ssssss>it stick to the glass like water treatment .<ssssss>aroma : not very strong overall , but like many big body beer , it open up with a little warmth .<ssssss>i get a really strong roasted malt quality first .<ssssss>coffee and bitter chocolate be most immediate , but i do pick up some smoke and spiciness on the nose too .<ssssss>i little note of dark fruit and cherry come out after it really warm up .<ssssss>not too impressive , but intriguing .<ssssss>taste : so a smoked flavor definitely come into play on the taste .<ssssss>this be like mole sauce in a beer , only slightly less sticky .<ssssss>i get a great chocolate/espresso bitterness with a almost hickory accent .<ssssss>instead of a hop bitterness on the linger , you get a spicy heat that be hard to define .<ssssss>be it the pepper or the booze ?<ssssss>mouthfeel : this be a thick ass beer .<ssssss>i guess it be more like a porter in flavor , but it be as heavy and viscous as most imperial stout .<ssssss>however , this be a beer that should be savor over a long period of time to enjoy its nuance .<ssssss>it could stand to be a bit thiner , but it work as be .<ssssss>drinkability : a one hit wonder for sure .<ssssss>i be glad it be a 12 ozer .<ssssss>i could easily see one of these guy as a great night cap , perhaps after a night of steak or pork chop .<ssssss>overall : i like this beer , but it be much heavier than expect .<ssssss>it evolve throughout the pour and the heat accumulate to a great palette awakener .<ssssss>
9 8 4 4 5		i love ipa .<ssssss>they be one of my favorite style of beer and i be super excite about try this beer .<ssssss>when i pour the beer into the glass , i think this beer be go to taste awesome because the color be a nice golden color and the head fade away fast .<ssssss>the taste on the other hand be not good .<ssssss>it really doesnt scream ipa to I other than the after taste .<ssssss>the mouthfeel be nothing special either .<ssssss>just like a basic boring beer to I .<ssssss>overall i be not impressed .<ssssss>
8 9 4 5 5		review 10/22/2007 -lrb- bottled may 2006 , batch 2 -rrb- : pour a ruby brown color , lighter edge .<ssssss>off-white head , frothy but small .<ssssss>hoppy aroma , grapefruit .<ssssss>dark woodsy scent , malt and alcohol .<ssssss>aroma of spice when inhale deeply , some sweetness and caramel .<ssssss>caramel and sweetness , dark raisin-y taste .<ssssss>spice , clove .<ssssss>sickly sweet aftertaste .<ssssss>warm up ... taste of something dark might be the oak - a hard flavor .<ssssss>a lot of alcohol .<ssssss>too alcoholy .<ssssss>
8 6 4 6 8		pour a light amber color with a small head that die off quickly and do not leave any lacing on the glass .<ssssss>the aroma be very subdue - some slight maltiness in there .<ssssss>not much else .<ssssss>the flavor be really tame also .<ssssss>slight hop flavor with a slight caramel backing .<ssssss>very water down .<ssssss>nothing special to see here .<ssssss>
6 8 4 8 7		so i have have these bottle for like 2 year and i decide it be about time i just get it over with and open one .<ssssss>what the hell right .<ssssss>crack it open after dessert of 5/31/2010 .<ssssss>the pour be alright .<ssssss>deep , dark , and black as night with a light ring of tan that circle the glass for maybe a minute before fading out of site and leave it completely bare .<ssssss>not my idea of the greatest of look but what can you do .<ssssss>aroma surprise I as it be do very , very well .<ssssss>a rich mix of dark chocolate , coffee , lot of bourbon and oak .<ssssss>warm bring out vanilla and light touch of molasses .<ssssss>very nicely do i have to admit and i be find hop this would not be terrible at this point .<ssssss>but then i take a sip .<ssssss>now , here be the odd part .<ssssss>the feel be horrible .<ssssss>flat , dull and thin .<ssssss>just a mess , i can not see how they could have tear this one up that badly .<ssssss>on the other hand the flavor be rich , decadent , near perfectly aged , so there in lie the issue .<ssssss>overall this could have be a very , very good beer , but alas it be a mess because of the lack of carbonation .<ssssss>fix the qc issue and it would be a winner .<ssssss>
8 6 5 3 5		i have this on tap at the mcmenamin 's on high st. , eugene , or .<ssssss>it pour a deep brown-black color , with a thin creamy head and lot of lacing .<ssssss>it do not have much of a nose to it at all .<ssssss>but , again , the taste be mainly of a strange bitter citrus flavor that be present in they porter as well .<ssssss>i do not find that it work well .<ssssss>
6 8 8 10 8		appearance be lower because the head be so blast ... nothing .<ssssss>high alcohol or not , i be afraid i be expect more head , even from the bottle .<ssssss>the aroma be better , with a rich , clean blend of caramel , coffee , chocolate , and something else like licorice .<ssssss>the flavor be phenomenal , however - hit you tongue with a deep chocolatey note , combine with a good blend of sweetness and bitterness that be almost equal in proportion and obvious without be overpowering .<ssssss>awesome .<ssssss>
9 8 8 6 7		750ml bottle appearance : slightly cloudy golden/straw body .<ssssss>huge frothy white head that stick around .<ssssss>good lacing .<ssssss>smell : slight spicy aroma , light lemon zest .<ssssss>sweet , but light and refreshing .<ssssss>taste/feel : nice and crisp in the mouth .<ssssss>sweet almost tart taste .<ssssss>it be not overpower , though , very refreshing .<ssssss>some tart/lemony taste feel artificial , but this taste natural and fitting .<ssssss>as it warm , the lemony taste get a little unbalanced , as do the yeasty/bready flavor .<ssssss>too bad .<ssssss>good summer beer , go well with some pizza .<ssssss>
8 7 10 7 8		pour from a 12 oz .<ssssss>bottle into its natural habitat , a piraat tulip .<ssssss>appearance : piraat pour a surprisingly pale apricot color that contain only hint of deeper amber .<ssssss>atop the beer be a monstrously foamy four-finger head that implode upon itself slowly , leave line of lacing on the glass as it go .<ssssss>despite be so light in color , the beer be somewhat cloudy .<ssssss>smell : i have not have a real belgian in awhile , so my sense of smell might be slightly unaccustomed to detect they nuance , but i can not discern any real hop scent in the nose - a bad start for a beer allege to be a ipa .<ssssss>this smell like you run of the mill bspa , with some slighly funky barnyard yeast scent and big note of banana and clove .<ssssss>this beer have both strong sweet and sour smell , so let 's see if the taste can bitter it up a bit .<ssssss>taste : the taste be definitely more bitter than the smell , but i feel the hop have only be use to act as a finish bitterness , rather than play a central role in the beer .<ssssss>even if just judge as a bspa -lrb- hop aside -rrb- the flavor be a little lack .<ssssss>all the ingredient be definitely there for a good beer - there be a good taste of yeast , banana , clove and other spice - but the do not really distinguish themselves .<ssssss>this be still a good beer , but i think it could be better , especially if it want to call itself a ipa .<ssssss>mouthfeel : piraat 's strong point , in my opinion , be the mouthfeel .<ssssss>it be definitely full-to-medium-bodies beer , but still maintain a high amount of carbonation - a impressive brewing feat .<ssssss>this be a nice , creamy belgian that be still crisp and refreshing , and for that i enjoy it .<ssssss>drinkability : i would not have guess this beer be push 11 % abv after take a couple of sip , but once it warm the alcohol become much more prevalent in both the smell and the taste .<ssssss>that say , this be a enjoyable beer , but not one you could drink quickly or have very many of .<ssssss>overall , piraat be a nice beer , with a few caveat .<ssssss>if its brewer be try to create a ipa , however , they really miss the mark , as the only hop to be find in this brew be of the finish variety and do not play a big role in the taste .<ssssss>regardless , this be a good bspa and i have certainly enjoy this bottle .<ssssss>
9 8 9 7 9		pour dark brown with a solid black body in the glass .<ssssss>natural carbonation add to the appearance of the ale , produce a long lasting foamy tan head .<ssssss>snicker bar aroma with note of chocolate , caramel , nougat , nut , bourbon , vanilla , coconut and wood .<ssssss>flavor be well balanced , sweet , richly flavored .<ssssss>finish be a touch short though .<ssssss>a nice ale all around .<ssssss>

9 6 8 8 8		deep ruby amber that you can just barely see through .<ssssss>1 '' tan head with good staying .<ssssss>a beautiful pour .<ssssss>perfection come with a head that last longer still ... do not smell like much .<ssssss>i get little bit of sweet candied fruit .<ssssss>maybe candy orange or apricot .<ssssss>trust I when i tell you that i hope for the former rather than the latter in the taste !<ssssss>to score higher it need fewer floral note and more malt note .<ssssss>oh .<ssssss>my .<ssssss>wow .<ssssss>whoa .<ssssss>now that ... i do not expect !<ssssss>at least , from the aroma i be not expect a big bitter hit .<ssssss>but there it be .<ssssss>this be like a malt/butter bomb of a brittish esb with a wack over the head of bitterness to it .<ssssss>some citrusy fruitiness to it but not a lot .<ssssss>enough to knock the score down .<ssssss>and the bitterness be just a bit much to be in balance .<ssssss>so , tone down the hop a bit and you be probably well on you way to a awesome beer .<ssssss>
8 7 7 9 8		a - have a dark strong coffee appearance , with a dark tan head that be 2 full finger when it arrive s - have a roasted aroma of quality malt , with a slight coffee hint t - taste like a weak coffee -lrb- the beer isnt weak , just resmeble weak coffee -rrb- , the beer be very fresh and quenching , rich hoppy and slight chocolate hint m - smooth and refreshing , not strong body , but damn good d - highly drinkable and easy to put down and order another before you know it<ssssss>
5 6 7 5 4		a - pour into a watou chalice .<ssssss>cloudy gold , with a touch of red .<ssssss>very little foam .<ssssss>not much of a pour , truth be tell .<ssssss>s - there be something fruity in the aroma , though i would not immediately peg it as the pomegranate it be .<ssssss>not unpleasant , but beyond that it do not have much aroma .<ssssss>t - i will start with the back end , because that be the best part of this beer .<ssssss>only then do i get a tangy pomegranate taste .<ssssss>up front , it taste like a too-strong pale ale .<ssssss>astringent bitter hop presence and a lot of perceive alcohol .<ssssss>i like the pomegranate on the back end , but i can get that in a glass of pom .<ssssss>f - i kinda like the slightly thin feel .<ssssss>if it be not somewhat thin , i do not think i could finish a glass .<ssssss>d - ok , i lie .<ssssss>i be not go to finish a glass .<ssssss>i think this beer be go to taste more like this brewery 's 10:10 , which i very much enjoy .<ssssss>the interplay of bitter , tangy and alcoholic here be not do it for I , with very little malt taste to help smooth thing out .<ssssss>probably my least favorite beer from this brewery .<ssssss>
10 7 9 9 9		this be to date the coolest look beer i have have .<ssssss>pour this one in a 20 oz .<ssssss>glass and it have a great head .<ssssss>half the glass be a nice yellowing foam , and it last almost the whole life of the beer .<ssssss>color be a brownish red , much darker than any ipa i have have .<ssssss>the smell of this beer be ok , it be a rye hop smell where i think the rye and the hop kind of contradict each other not give this beer a very strong aroma .<ssssss>the taste of this beer be reaaly good .<ssssss>the first couple of drink be very bitter , really tasting the rye .<ssssss>the after that be be a very well balanced beer with a strong rye and hop flavor , very smooth .<ssssss>the mouthfeel of this beer be right on for a strong ipa .<ssssss>all in all a great beer and one of the most amazing beer to come out of a bottle .<ssssss>bear republic probably do bottle better than any one else .<ssssss>try it if you get a chance .<ssssss>

6 4 6 7 6		i purchase this beer in mr. mo , coconut grove , florida which be a bar .<ssssss>it seem delightful , but it lack the aroma i be look for .<ssssss>well it do not have much of a scent to begin with but overall its not a bad beer .<ssssss>the taste be a bit hoppy , i would not suggest this beer to someone , but maybe it taste better on tap ... until then my decision on this beer be average .<ssssss>
10 7 9 9 9		appearance : big , espresso roast-colored head which soften to a pillow .<ssssss>load of lacing as it settle and lower as i drink .<ssssss>deep black color with ruby edge .<ssssss>aroma : there be a roasted malt smell here along with a bit of hop .<ssssss>taste : best part .<ssssss>roasted flavor follow by a big hop blast balance out at the end .<ssssss>sweet chocolate ... bittersweet ... a touch of coffee ... malt ... each sip want a follow-up .<ssssss>a bit dry and linger but nice .<ssssss>mouthfeel : creamy ... .<ssssss>smooth ... decent carbonation .<ssssss>overall : blow away the competition .<ssssss>no need to ever have the import biggie with this around .<ssssss>this be not water down roasted malt beer .<ssssss>this be great stuff .<ssssss>
6 6 6 8 6		review 5/8/2006 -lrb- pint on tap @ the brewery , woodinville , wa -rrb- : pour a body that be golden yellow in color , with a smallish head , white .<ssssss>have a malty aroma , light , but not much aroma overall .<ssssss>light malty taste , citrus , nutty aftertaste .<ssssss>light , crisp taste .<ssssss>similar to a wheat beer , probably the graininess .<ssssss>
8 7 5 8 7		this be another relatively good beer in the heavy sea line , but line the other non-hoppy beer , this one could use some refinement to sharpen the flavor and increase the complexity .<ssssss>what you do get here be a creamy assortment of farmhouse spice , fruity beligan ester and touch of light malt flavor - so all in all a tasty brew .<ssssss>it do sit a bit heavy for the style and be not nearly as refreshing as other saison , like dupont .<ssssss>still worth a try though for something different .<ssssss>
7 4 7 6 6		a : pour a hazy copper color with about a finger of beige head that fade into a thin ring with a little lacing .<ssssss>s : some dark fruit like plum at first follow by a scent of grape juice .<ssssss>the grape juice be pretty overwhelming .<ssssss>t : similar to the aroma , there be some dark fruit up front and then the grape kick in .<ssssss>it be pretty strong , but not overwhelmingly so .<ssssss>the finish be yeasty and slightly bitter .<ssssss>m : medium-light body with medium combination .<ssssss>slightly oily characteristic .<ssssss>d : for a very fruity beer , it be not too bad .<ssssss>the grape 's a bit too strong for I , but it be not like some fruited beer that taste like they just mixed fruit juice with beer .<ssssss>
6 6 8 4 4		sure , this beer be innovative -lrb- although right brain brewery do a better version last year -rrb- but the flavor just do not mesh too well .<ssssss>the rosemary , sage and thyme be nice , but i swear the parsley -lrb- which dominate with grassy chlorophyll -rrb- be just throw in to match the simon and garfunkel song .<ssssss>and , while i generally love saison , the slight sourness make everything even more confusing .<ssssss>while this be appeal from a novelty perspective , palate fatigue set in about halfway through one beer .<ssssss>
10 5 7 6 5		have to start by say this be a very complex beer ... not really sure if it be a oatmeal stout , a sweet stout or a imperial stout .<ssssss>color be black w a thick brown head that last fairly well .<ssssss>aroma be very hoppy at first before dissipate only slightly -lrb- do not get I wrong , i love hop , but not really to style hence lower rating -rrb- .<ssssss>hint of chocolate and mouthfeel be oily as a oatmeal stout should be .<ssssss>beer be smooth at first but turn very bitter at the finish ... .<ssssss>also notice alcohol as it sit and warm a bit -lrb- like a imperial stout -rrb- .<ssssss>as they say on the bottle `` recommend as a nightcap . ''<ssssss>i could prob drink a few but certainly not a session beer as i like in most oatmeal stout .<ssssss>
8 8 8 6 8		appearance : muddy brown with moderate-high carbonation .<ssssss>off white-light tan slowly diminish head .<ssssss>good lacing .<ssssss>aroma : brandy , red wine , some earthy , yeasty , malty , and fruity smell as well .<ssssss>taste : good balance and a nice sort of earthy flavor .<ssssss>not as good as the smell belie .<ssssss>i can not find much in here .<ssssss>there be some sweet malt and alchohol presence , but not a very significant flavor .<ssssss>mouthfeel : body be just a tad thin , but the carbonation be do well .<ssssss>drinkability : easy .<ssssss>9 % keep you from drink too many though .<ssssss>note : now i know why a lot of people say chimay be overrate .<ssssss>i must say i agree .<ssssss>it lack the complexity and flavor that i be expect .<ssssss>not a bad beer by any means , but certainly not as good as advertise .<ssssss>
8 4 6 7 6		i have not be too happy with trafalgar 's offering , but i figure i would give this one a go .<ssssss>i be a bit of a sucker for brew with dog on the label , hope to find that elusive ` red tick ale ' .<ssssss>pour a lighter amber hue .<ssssss>certainly not red , look more like a pale ale .<ssssss>about a half inch head , settle as a ring around the glass .<ssssss>good amount of lacing , actually .<ssssss>other than the colour , it do not look too bad .<ssssss>the nose be ... strange .<ssssss>i get that typical malty-caramel combination , but it be follow by what i can only describe as sour butter .<ssssss>i be bad with identify odor , but suffice to say , whatever it be it do not smell good .<ssssss>the taste be okay .<ssssss>i be get malt and caramel up front , and i find the finish to have a bitter , peppry character .<ssssss>not hoppy , just ... bitter .<ssssss>not nearly robust enough for I - and certainly too sweet - but otherwise it be drinkable .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a touch undercarbonate , slightly creamy .<ssssss>aside from the disastrous nose , this brew be not too bad .<ssssss>i will probably not get it again though , know how many other red there be available to I , but it be drinkable .<ssssss>
7 5 8 7 7		the golden orange body shine .<ssssss>three finger of white head have so-so retention .<ssssss>some lace be leave behind .<ssssss>it have a meek aroma of caramel , freshly baked bread , earth , and citrus .<ssssss>what little aroma it have be invite , i just wish it be bolder .<ssssss>it taste of sweet bread , caramel , and orange .<ssssss>herbaceous finish .<ssssss>bitterness be mild but somewhat linger .<ssssss>very smooth and soft in the mouth .<ssssss>it be a decent pale ale , but nothing to go crazy over if you be a hophead .<ssssss>
5 2 5 4 2		ugh .<ssssss>the beer be a flaxen gold , with a thin meager ring of head edge the glass .<ssssss>the aroma be diacetyl butterscotch .<ssssss>the flavor be diacetyl butterscotch .<ssssss>taste like a butterfinger candy bar , with the same sweetness , and perhaps a lackluster toast malt presence .<ssssss>no hop .<ssssss>no complexity whatsoever .<ssssss>just sweetness .<ssssss>i can imagine that this would be a good beer for you macro buddy , since it be so candy-like .<ssssss>i think it completely suck .<ssssss>
4 8 6 4 6		very pale in colour - not at all a good start for a ipa .<ssssss>i do not mind the cloudiness at all though .<ssssss>the aroma be a redemption of sort with a complex mixture of fruity and grassy element and perhaps a bit of yeast .<ssssss>the colour and aroma make it seem like it model itself on the cooper pa .<ssssss>the taste have a very apparent bitter kick , too much consider the malt be almost completely absent .<ssssss>i give they mark for try but the brew be horribly unbalanced .<ssssss>mouthfeel be light to medium and not particularly worthy .<ssssss>one the bitterness be overcome the beer do not offer too much , finish rather dry and thus the drinkability be sort of high .<ssssss>high in the same manner as you could easily drink a six pack of any give australian macro lager .<ssssss>
7 8 5 8 7		a : nearly flat .<ssssss>a very slight ring of very fine carbonation around the top , and a few stray bubble come up through the otherwise dark brown body .<ssssss>nearly opaque , but not quite .<ssssss>s : booze , chocolate , and raisin .<ssssss>a fair oak/vanilla presence .<ssssss>pretty nice nose , frankly .<ssssss>better than i remember , but it be be a while .<ssssss>almost smell like rum ball or something .<ssssss>no hop .<ssssss>t : this might be a bit too cold for all the flavor to come through -- my fault entirely .<ssssss>however , it be perfectly good .<ssssss>it be not as boozy as it smell , nor as sweet -- both plus , in my book .<ssssss>noticeable but not overwhelming malt character .<ssssss>finish with a bit of bitter malt and round , robust chocolate flavor .<ssssss>not too sweet , not too dry , well balance in that respect .<ssssss>the woody oak linger , too , after rest a minute .<ssssss>m : the consistency be nice and thick , but it be totally flat , and not in a good , cask-beer way .<ssssss>however , it coat the mouth for a nice , long taste that suit barrel-aged complexity .<ssssss>d : fairly high .<ssssss>it be not overwhelming with weird flavor , but enough complexity to ponder .<ssssss>a reasonably price , well execute , barrel aged beer -- hard to ask for more .<ssssss>it be no bcs or dark lord , but it be not terribly expensive and readily available .<ssssss>
9 8 6 9 10		pour into nb globe .<ssssss>a : appearance be a deep reddish orange with good clarity , 2 finger foamy white head upon pour , dissipate to a cm of head with retention through out , nice lacing s : big aromatic piney hop up front , hop also provide a nice spicy profile on the nose which be a nice introduction to the malt back bone which provide some aroma of toast t : thing start off with a touch of malt sweetness , but this be quickly subside by a huge do of piney bitter hop , the hop go from bitter to fruity about mid palate and the finish be nice and balanced .<ssssss>this beer have a huge punch of hop flavor but do not leave residual bitterness on the palate .<ssssss>quite nice .<ssssss>mf : high carbonation , medium body d : this be be perhaps the best winter seasonal around , this be partly due to it be the only ipa of the class so to speak .<ssssss>either way , it be a well do ipa that feature the more piney side of hop without be too bitter .<ssssss>
7 9 7 7 7		a : pour a golden copper color with a half finger off white head that do not leave any lace .<ssssss>s : aroma of strong piney hop and less so citric fruit with a undertone of malt .<ssssss>t : not at all the taste i be expect .<ssssss>it kind of fizzle on the tip of my tongue for awhile .<ssssss>have a nice smooth unassuming hop taste that blend well with a bready malt to leave a nice bitter taste with a overall feeling that you just eat a grapefruit .<ssssss>maybe because its organic , i dunno .<ssssss>after about ten seconds a almost candylike taste hit my tastebud at the back of my mouth .<ssssss>m & d : mouthfeel and drinkability be good , although i be hope for more of a piney hop blast .<ssssss>carbonation at first be fizzy , but dwindle a few seconds after you swallow a gulp .<ssssss>definately a smooth tasting ipa , but i be still confuse a bit by this one .<ssssss>also a bit dry .<ssssss>i can not seem to place everything that go on with it -- again , maybe because its organic ... i would like to try this on-tap .<ssssss>
9 10 8 8 8		2011 edition .<ssssss>appearance : pitch black .<ssssss>creamy beige head .<ssssss>aroma : sweet aroma .<ssssss>lot of sweet spice ... cinnamon , nutmeg , some brown sugar .<ssssss>there some pumpkin .<ssssss>taste : sweet pumpkin up front along with spice at the end .<ssssss>there good amount of nice bready malt , ginger bread with a touch of sweet molasses .<ssssss>dark fruity character .<ssssss>holiday spice towards the finish .<ssssss>body : medium , not too heavy .<ssssss>finish : spice .<ssssss>a little alcohol warmth .<ssssss>smooth .<ssssss>
6 5 6 5 8		a : this beer have a nice color , that be a dark amber color .<ssssss>the head start out nice but go away very very fast .<ssssss>s : therte be almost no aroma , this mean there be also no negative aroma which be why i give be a 2.5 .<ssssss>t : this be a `` decent '' tasting beer .<ssssss>it doesnt taste like a bock beer in my opinion , and be a bit watery , but compare to other beer from ab and the like , its a winner .<ssssss>crip taste be really all i can say this beer be probably my favorite out of ab .<ssssss>i do not hate ab like many ppl seem to , but i aslo do not think they beer be what i would choose to drink .<ssssss>that say they provide a cheap and affordable bridge into the beer world , my first beer ever be a bud select the night i turn 21 .<ssssss>none of this factor into my review however , and the one thing that ab do well , be they beer be always drinkable , may not taste the best or have alot of depth , but its always easy go down , and this beer be no different<ssssss>
9 7 6 8 8		curiosity kill the cat , i see this and have to grab a single .<ssssss>i get a pleasant surprise pour this out , beaten copper body , big resilent sticky off-white head nearly perfect for style .<ssssss>in the aroma , i can actually smell hop , not violently aggressive hop , but they be definitely assertive in they stance lightly piney , and citrusy .<ssssss>the background of the aroma be a small swell of sweet malt , and a faint , yet slightly unpleasant minerally/metallic tinge .<ssssss>as a swallow i think the first thing i notice be that this be a tad light , but still serviceable in mouthfeel .<ssssss>honey sweet malt tickle the front of my palate , flat bitterness develop into subtle pine and citrus flavorsfollow by a resurgence of sweet malt and a spicy dry finish .<ssssss>this beer be quench but the dryness make you want to take another drink .<ssssss>a nicely balanced apa if not a little thin .<ssssss>im still pleasantly surprised !<ssssss>might i add , for just over $ 5 a sixer , this one rank pretty high on the `` bang for you buck list '' '' bang bang bang ''<ssssss>
9 8 6 8 8		great look beer .<ssssss>dark .<ssssss>quite reddish in the light .<ssssss>thin , crackling tan head .<ssssss>just as it should , i suppose .<ssssss>by far the most aromatic of the maumee brew i sample today -- kickass mousse-like chocolate aroma .<ssssss>kind of sweet .<ssssss>a bit surprising then that the flavor be what it be ... the first sip : a bit thin .<ssssss>the last sip : quite thin .<ssssss>but everything in between shared one thing in common -- the roasty toasty !<ssssss>while hardly a `` espresso porter '' or something in that vein , this certainly have a nice coffee bitterness to it .<ssssss>balance the chocolate well and really end up steal the show .<ssssss>if it be just a bit thicker , this would be a hell of a porter .<ssssss>
7 8 8 6 7		draught ; fly saucer , san antonio cloudy pee-yellow -lrb- easiest way to describe it -rrb- , nice foamy head with fine bubble .<ssssss>on the nose there be lot of champagne-like yeastiness with some lemon-citrus scent .<ssssss>taste very yeasty , buscuity soft wheat malt with some sour spiciness , but theres something else there that seem a bit weird , kinda styrofoamy .<ssssss>soft , mostly pleasant and easy to drink if you like soft yeasty wit .<ssssss>
4 6 7 5 6		appearence-wise , this one leave something to be desire .<ssssss>have almost no head at all , but on the up-side , it be a nice deep black color .<ssssss>smell almost exactly like guinness , only slightly weaker .<ssssss>taste-wise , it do not really have much flavor at all ... simply taste like a watered-down guinness .<ssssss>if you be look for a weak stout , i guess this would be a good choice for you .<ssssss>however , i be not really a fan .<ssssss>they other brew , for the most part , have a much better quality to they .<ssssss>
8 7 4 5 5		pick this up at bottework last week , best by 12/10/09 .<ssssss>cork do not require much encouragement to release once uncaged .<ssssss>a abundance of carbonation be notice pre-pour , just bubble in the neck of the bottle .<ssssss>pour into a westmalle chalice , 2 finger head slowly fading to a good look full half-finger head .<ssssss>dark brown , ruby appearance .<ssssss>aroma of begian yeast , raisin , red licorice , coffee , mild chocolate , and something pineappley or citrus like that seem out of place for a special dark xmas ale .<ssssss>there be something tart or acidic in here , not sure what .<ssssss>this be not what i be expect , it be sweet , tart and do not finish well for I .<ssssss>not sure what they be go for here , maybe this would be better with some aging , but it seem out of balance for I at this point .<ssssss>also the mouthfeel be fizzy and carbonation seem a bit overdo .<ssssss>
5 8 6 6 6		belgica pour a light gold , into a chalice .<ssssss>not very much head and quickly fade away to nothing .<ssssss>aroma be of resinous hop , belgian yeast , and some alcohol .<ssssss>taste follow the nose with some bitter , earthy citrus hop , couple with a sweet fruity belgian ale characteristic .<ssssss>for 7.2 abv it sure pack a punch , the alcohol be not mask .<ssssss>mouthfeel be a bit slick , overall the beer be medium body .<ssssss>a decent belgian ipa attempt , but i would rather have something more authentic .<ssssss>not bad by any means but not a world beater .<ssssss>
9 7 9 6 8		22oz bomber from a liquor store in downtown providence , ri .<ssssss>the best-by date be smudge and largely unreadable , but i think it be sometime in february of 2011 -lrb- which be this month . -rrb-<ssssss>pour a nice , clear darker golden , some head , lot of bubble .<ssssss>look pretty .<ssssss>smell like sweet malt , caramel , hint of citrus .<ssssss>taste be as above -- strong caramel malt flavor , end crisp and with a bit of hop , but not enough to really call this a ipa .<ssssss>i be go to chalk it up to the fact that its at the end of the freshness window .<ssssss>reasonably tasty , though , with nice malt flavor .<ssssss>definitely a english ipa .<ssssss>mouthfeel be average and the carbonation seem perfect .<ssssss>this be a really easy one to drink , and the low abv help .<ssssss>i would be curious to try this one fresher , but you can tell this be never intend to be a hop-bomb .<ssssss>some great malt flavor a lot of ipa be lack , though .<ssssss>
8 7 8 9 7		cabin fever be brown in color with red high light .<ssssss>a half inch tan head do not last long .<ssssss>it have a very sweet , malty aroma and oddly , i get alcohol too , even though it be only 6.25 abv .<ssssss>the taste be very sweet , chocolate covered caramel .<ssssss>the feel be medium body , but oily , with adequate carbonation .<ssssss>i find fever a little rich to be highly drinkable , but the abv be certainly low enough .<ssssss>it be almost too sweet , but i really enjoy cabin fever and definitely plan on pick up a few more .<ssssss>a shame that it do not appear to be a good candidate for cellaring .<ssssss>
6 7 4 4 4		a : the pour be noticeably thin , but produce a very dark body with about a finger of thin light brown head .<ssssss>it dissolve quickly , but what remain lace down the side of the glass quite nicely .<ssssss>s : the smell seem to be more of oak than of bourbon initially , but the bourbon flavor arise after a few whiff and be mix with vanilla .<ssssss>roasted malt be the other predominant smell and some chocolate be also note .<ssssss>the smell as a whole be pretty weak though , too light without bold enough characteristic .<ssssss>t : as soon as the beer hit my mouth i know it be go to be too weak to hold its own in this style .<ssssss>the bourbon and vanilla be present -lrb- especially at the front and back -rrb- , there be just nothing hold this together .<ssssss>roasted malt flavor do make themselves know , it be just not enough .<ssssss>mf : far too light , thin , carbonated well though .<ssssss>the abv be just too low for a beer of this size to compete in the category .<ssssss>o : huge disappointment .<ssssss>not very happy about have 3 of these leave in the fridge .<ssssss>
8 8 4 6 6		go to sph for my boyfriend 's birthday and get a glass of this with brunch , think it would be a good beer to start the day with .<ssssss>well ... it be not .<ssssss>should have get the porter , closer to a morning coffee .<ssssss>the beer look nice , pale cloudy yellow with a tiny bit of a white head .<ssssss>smell wheaty and spicy , but it be a bit subdue .<ssssss>.<ssssss>taste pretty bland actually .<ssssss>like any good white beer - orange-lemony flavour with a bit of spiciness , but the beer be way too cold to really get all the flavour out of it , if there be more .<ssssss>mouthfeel , like i say be cold , also way too fizzy .<ssssss>i be not use to a white beer feeling like soda .<ssssss>drinkability be ` average ' because it be not terrible , it basically be a normal run-of-the-mill white beer , but the carbonation and temp .<ssssss>be just off , so i would not make a habit of drink several glass of it in a sit .<ssssss>
8 10 8 7 6		pour out to a light brownish colour .<ssssss>decent carbonation .<ssssss>slight to medium head .<ssssss>kind of heavy , could not have too many of these back to back .<ssssss>taste mildly like orange , slightly bitter , taste brilliant go down , wonderful beer to have especially if its hot out .<ssssss>
8 9 7 7 4		pour this beer into a pint appearance : this beer pour a dark orange and be very cloudy .<ssssss>i only have a little head .<ssssss>smell : this beer have a very sweet and fruity aroma .<ssssss>you can also smell some of the malt .<ssssss>taste : as with the smell it be very sweet but maybe too sweet .<ssssss>i be kinda get a hint of banana and apple .<ssssss>mouthfeel : very smooth an sweet and have a full body .<ssssss>it be very complex so much so you can barely taste the alcohol .<ssssss>carbonation be all so very good .<ssssss>drinkability : as i say in everything else it be a very sweet beer so much so that i only think i could only have just one .<ssssss>on top of that price be a little steep -lrb- $ 8.99 -rrb-<ssssss>
6 4 6 6 5		my wife -lrb- a devout mich-ultra drinker -rrb- bring this home after a weekend with the girl and say no one could drink it .<ssssss>so my expectation be pretty low .<ssssss>cook corn .<ssssss>faint floral hop aroma , fade with head .<ssssss>vegetable after head fade .<ssssss>fizzy pour decent white head but dissipate quickly .<ssssss>no lacing .<ssssss>pale yellow color .<ssssss>very clear .<ssssss>sweet corn flavor , some what grainy .<ssssss>some astringency and dms .<ssssss>hop flavor noticeable .<ssssss>more bitter than expect .<ssssss>finish dry .<ssssss>very light body .<ssssss>high carbonation .<ssssss>do not seem watery .<ssssss>light , fairly refreshing .<ssssss>the aftertaste would prevent I from seek this out .<ssssss>still not a horrible brew , would drink if there be nothing else around .<ssssss>as it stand tonight though , i can not finish this glass .<ssssss>
8 9 7 7 7		2010 bottle pick up at capone about 2 month ago .<ssssss>a - a very thick cocoa puff milk form atop the brew .<ssssss>very bubbly , effervescent .<ssssss>the brew be the darkest brown/partially black in color , and opaque .<ssssss>evident carbonation .<ssssss>s - first initial whiff yield dark fruit .<ssssss>once take in , this be quite a nose .<ssssss>deep roasted malt , molasses , brown sugar , rich toffee , a touch of syrup , and a little chocolate .<ssssss>you can detect some booze but not overwhelming .<ssssss>the dark fruit be still present in each sniff .<ssssss>t - the dark fruit be the most present flavor .<ssssss>i wan na say plum and raisin , and some black cherry too .<ssssss>midway into the flavor i get the slightest bit of vanilla chocolate blend .<ssssss>the aftertaste be a barrage of roasted malt , and the slightest bitterness .<ssssss>the booze be not detect in flavor at all .<ssssss>m - i have read in other review that this be `` buttery '' , and you can pick that up from the mouthfeel .<ssssss>this be very smooth and easy drinking .<ssssss>the carbonation be hardly feel , and the body be light to medium body , but right in the middle of that .<ssssss>this be probably the lightest body ris i have have .<ssssss>o - this be a good ris .<ssssss>everything fall short compair to the nose on this though .<ssssss>the taste be not as pronounced , and the mouth be too light as a stout for my liking .<ssssss>but the masking of the booze and easy drinking nature make this beer above average .<ssssss>
9 10 7 7 7		i love that as soon as i remove the crown of this beer the aroma of brett seem to permeate the kitchen , and then the house as soon i pour this in a glass .<ssssss>it pour a coppered amber-esque color with sprinkle highlight of gold with a ruby tinged tan head .<ssssss>the aroma really explode with brett , but i also get a bit of lactic note and a slight tinge peppery leather .<ssssss>the flavor here be the low point on this beer , as the aroma can not be top and it really look amazing .<ssssss>though this beer have develop since i first have it , i really be look for a more hearty development .<ssssss>i can definitely taste the brett here , but the malt seem hide and the sour flavor just have not blossom enough .<ssssss>thank god i have a few bottle leave , as i really see this one move slowly towards wonderful -- think golden idol , but this one will need more time .<ssssss>
7 3 7 7 6		pour a relatively clear light brown with about a half inch of head .<ssssss>the aroma be mainly of hop , but with a overly yeasty smell that i find slightly unpleasant .<ssssss>the taste be much hoppier than the smell , but the yeasty smell i get be also evident in the taste and remind I of slightly off homebrew .<ssssss>as i finish the beer , the smell make it harder and harder to drink the bottle .<ssssss>ultimately , i be go to have to chug this bleh .<ssssss>
9 8 8 7 9		finally get around to try this , i have have it before in the past but not recently .<ssssss>definitely a different take on a ipa .<ssssss>pour a very orange color , much different in hue than other ipa 's , or even other beer in the market .<ssssss>taste be full body and smooth with a kick of hop , but it be not as hoppy as the usual ipa .<ssssss>this be still tasty though and i would have it again for sure .<ssssss>
5 5 6 7 5		this be the best little cheap texan beer you can find .<ssssss>when texa boast such great micro brew -lrb- st. arnold and the late celi -rrb- and staple like shiner , this poor man beer do not really hold a candle .<ssssss>but , there be nothing better than sit around a grill on a hot summer day drinking lonestar bottle and try to figure out the pictogram on the bottle cap after 8 or so beer .<ssssss>hand down the best float down the river or barbeque beer out there .<ssssss>on top of that , if you find a little back bar in texa you can usually get a pint of this or a bottle for less than $ 2 .<ssssss>it still taste less than good though , strong and harsh , pure texan .<ssssss>
9 9 6 8 7		receive in trade with sebletitje .<ssssss>i know this one have be say to be better with age , but there be no date on the bottle , so i do not know how old this bottle be or what to expect .<ssssss>pour a cloudy , amber shade of brown with a quickly dissappate head .<ssssss>smell of malt sweetness and grapefruit-like citrus .<ssssss>pour into my duvel tulip , if you swish the beer around the little bubble will race up the side of the glass to the surface , and down the side of the glass in sequence .<ssssss>this neat visual make I round up the appearance .<ssssss>taste far mellower than i would have anticipate give what i have hear .<ssssss>sweet malt come through foremost with a mild sourness , like the aforementioned grapefruit .<ssssss>little hop profile to speak of , alcohol do not really come through until the finish , where it linger in the throat thereafter .<ssssss>big alcohol taste there , but it really do not stop I from drink more .<ssssss>mouthfeel be syrupy and coating .<ssssss>i do not really think i could have more than one of these per night , but i would be damned if i do not try .<ssssss>if anything , it would be the sticky and cloying mouthfeel rather than the big booze presence prevent I from do so , which be surprising to I .<ssssss>
8 5 7 8 8		have one of these baby at the santa barbara beer festival .<ssssss>pretty tasty !<ssssss>a - deep ruby red body with a nice off-white head .<ssssss>s - slight malt scent .<ssssss>not a hell of a lot in the nose though .<ssssss>t - sweet , roasty , malty .<ssssss>very strong .<ssssss>m - fairly mouthfeel .<ssssss>d - very smooth flavor make it quite drinkable .<ssssss>
