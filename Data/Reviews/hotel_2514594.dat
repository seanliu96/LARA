<Title>“Doubletree Metropolitan – NYC: A Great Place to Be!!!!!”
<Content>For many years, I have been staying at the Doubletree Metropolitan in mid-town NYC. From the time that I step into the cab, at the airport, heading into the city…a BIG SMILE splashes across my face because I feel like I am “HOME!!!” And that is how the wonderful people at the Doubletree Metropolitan make me to feel “Welcomed Back Home!!!” I see the various familiar faces at the hotel, in which I got to know some people by name…from the doormen to several of the fantastic professional staff, at the front desk and in the restaurant. As always, I am glad to see everyone and they make me feel like they are glad to see me, too!!!! The hotel’s signature WARM CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE that you get on arrival is SCRUMPTI-LICIOUS!!!! It is a nice HOME touch!!!! The Doubletree Metropolitan is MY FAVORITE PLACE to stay whenever I visit NYC. It is a GREAT HOTEL that is in an ideal location, with very reasonable pricing. It is close to the subway or easy walk to surrounding attractions. I really like the pleasant and clean room décor. The beds are comfortable, which is an absolute must for me!!! The hotel has been doing some floor by floor renovations, during my last stay back in February 2012. The hotel operations continued to run smoothly. The lobby and lounge look very nice!!! The Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel…I LOVE IT!!!! It is my home away from home!!!

<Title>“Fantastic location and quality hotel!”
<Content>We booked this hotel using Hotwire and got an amazing deal ($99) for Sunday April 1st. This hotel was in an amazing location! Easy to walk to Central Park, 5th Ave, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Grand Central Station, Empire State Building, Macy's and a Starbucks across the street! The hotel staff were outstanding and very friendly! We arrived early and immediately they took our luggage and locked it away so we could go sightseeing right away. When we came back 5-6 hrs later, they were quick to retrieve our luggage and check in was fast. Our room was on the 8th floor in a newly renovated room. It was amazing! Bed was comfortable, plenty pillows and towels. We faced the side street and heard nothing from the street or even inside. Check out the next day was very convenient as there were 3 different options to chose from! I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when I return to NYC!

<Title>“Easy subway access, newly renovated room”
<Content>This was a great buy on Expedia and having a room on the 17th floor was great. Room was newly renovated, very quiet, free wifi in the lobby. Decent wifi price of $16 if in the room. Ask for the odd numbered rooms as it faces the back where there is literally no traffic noise, I will definitely stay here again. Great cafe with good food choices just outside hotel too.

<Title>“location location location”
<Content>The location is Awesome! right by the metro station (51st st.), but if you walk to lexington ave and 53rd st, there's another metro station. Ess-a-bagel is behind the hotel at 3rd ave. Living in Mid-town is such a wonderful place to get to anywhere in Manhattan. Metro station is a good choice, but sometimes I prefer to walk, even in the late night of Manhattan, I feel safe. (I travelled solo in NYC) This hotel I would totally recommend, my only complain would be there's no coffemaker in the room.

<Title>“Book early”
<Content>We visited New York in May and I sure am glad we booked early. Room was $205 a night booked 4 months in advance. Week before the trip, rates were up to almost $400. The location of this hotel was awesome. Subway entrance was right next to the hotel, and walking distance to Bloomingdales, Rockefeller Center, and Central Park. At $200 night, this was a great deal for a nice hotel in mid-town. The restaurant was a little pricey, but there was a Cafe Metro right outside the front entrance, if you wanted an inexpensive meal, especially breakfast.

<Title>“good location, bad hotel”
<Content>Stayed there 4 nights. 1. The location is very convenient, right next to a subway and a little restaurant where you can have a good breakfast. 2. Standard welcome, nothing special to say. 3. The floor in our room was completely wet when we get in. We immediately called the front desk and ask to be changed when we'll be back from our dinner. Then we got out to have dinner. When we came back nobody knew about the change request and we had to explain and show again. We finally got another room, better. 4. The carpet seemed old... and certainly not hygienic (stains, bad feeling about it...). Very standard bathroom, not refurbished for a while. 5. The persons at the front desk were not helpful, working like robots. We won't come again.

<Title>“lovely hotel with very large rooms”
<Content>The hotel is being renovated, so beware of that. The rooms were not quite finished. The hotel clerk was kind enough to give us a room on a top floor, where the renovations were almost completed. The halls and the room were very clean. The room size was very large for a new york hotel. It was very quiet and the bed very, very comfortable. The rate was fantastic, as is the location. The continental breakfast ordered through room service was amazingly satisfying and at a reasonable cost. The staff were all friendly, pleasant and accomodating. Would definitely return if the rates don't soar after the renovations are completed.

<Title>“Couldn't be worse !”
<Content>The first time I stayed at this hotel was ok, but this time as they were under renovation was terrible. I couldn't sleep after 7.20 a.m. because a drill and a hammer started working. I had no air conditioning ,so I had to leave the window open( as possible).I complained about it and I was told that it was season time! But my friends had the air conditioning working properly !?!?

<Title>“Awesome time at the Hilton Doubletree”
<Content>I celebrated by 40th Birthday on March 10, 2012. My husband arranged an incredible weekend in the city for us. Party at Sofrito's restaurant on Saturday and massages on Sunday all in the Big Apple. We live in Harriman, NY and thought we should just go all out and stay in the city instead of communting both days. I picked a hotel near the restaurant... to my surprise it was absolutely beautiful. Hilton Doubletree was so accomodating. We checked in early and with our 2 kids since we had some time before we had to drop them off to my dad house for the night so that David and I can start our weekend. The receptionist was awesome she even gave them warm cookies to enjoy while they hung out in our beautiful room for 2 hours. Incredible views, beautiful clean rooms and welcoming lobby. Thank you Doubletree for being the icing on my cake for my 40th Birthday Celebration!!! Will return and will absolutely recommend to my friends and family. Raquel & David Ortiz

<Title>“Rooms great, hotel not bad, breakfast no thanks”
<Content>Staying for a week at the Doubletree Metropolitan while at a conference. It seems all the renovations are over or not in evidence from what I've seen. Comfortable rooms, not bad shower over a tiny bath tub. Amazing and very strong Mojitos in the bar and not bad bar food. Don't bother with the breakfast though. Stupidly overpriced, cremated bacon with Scrambled egg made with powdered egg - the kind of stuff you'd expect at a really cheap greasy spoon. There's a decent cafe next door that is way under half the price for better food.

<Title>“Another NYC Ripoff”
<Content>We made the mistake of staying at the Doubletree Metropolitan the week before Xmas, 2011. Through Orbitz, we paid approx $40 to $50 extra for a "high floor" room. However, at Check-In, we were given a "low floor" room. After realizing the room was wrong, I verified that it was "low-floor", questioned the night manager about it, and was immediately told by him that "the rooms on the higher floors aren't any bigger." When told that we selected the high floor room to reduce the street noise, he said "I could give you a room on a higher floor, but then you would complain about the construction noise." So we stayed in the low floor room that night and the remainder of the trip. I called Orbitz the next day to get a refund for the difference in room quality, they were no help and "negotiated" with the hotel to get us a high floor room. Because we were settled in the room and busy vacationing in NYC, we did not change, and of course never received a refund. Upon Check-Out, I discussed the matter with a desk clerk named Venus, who immediately said "the rooms on the higher floors aren't any bigger," so that must be the hotel's standard reply to any complaint about a low-floor room. Venus agreed that we should be refunded the difference for at least the first night, took great delight in saying that the high floor room to which we did not change was given as a free upgrade to someone else, and would call me back about the first night refund later that day. Well Venus, three months later I'm still waiting for your call. As I expected, no money was ever refunded, so we were cheated by Hilton Hotels, a $Billion corporation and Orbitz for about $250. As for the accommodations, the room itself was tired, worn, ancient, and small. I've stayed at Holiday Inn Express that were nicer. So overall, we will never stay at this hotel again, never stay in a Hilton hotel again, nor use Orbitz to make travel arrangements.

<Content>I stayed here for a week on business. The room was fine, and the location of the hotel was great. Make sure your room doesn't face 51st street. The police station was across from my room, and the noise woke me repeatedly. Otherwise my stay would have been very nice.

<Title>“Best option for this section of the city”
<Content>I come into the city this time every year for an industry event at the Waldorf and have stayed at this hotel for 3 years in a row. I have stayed at nearby hotels over the years and consider this the best value, booking online direct through Hilton and well in advance. My room was on the 17th floor and I did not experience any noise or disruption whatsoever from the renovations. The check-in and check-out are very effecient. Rooms are comfortable. If you drive in the valet service is very efficient. No complaints and will return next year.

<Title>“Midtown excellence”
<Content>I had to be in and out of New York on business and chose the hotel closest to where my business was going to be. This hotel was clean, neat, responsive and, of course, scored big points with giving us as cookie hot out of the oven on check in. I called ahead and they told me the best way to get from Newark to the hotel and confirmed I was a 2 minute walk from the place I would be doing business. My only gripe was no luncheon room service, a small thing, but could easily be accommodated.

<Title>“awesome”
<Content>loved stopping in this hotel. Was so close to everything shopping wise. Although it was a bit away from Times Square and all the touristy things down that area....if y a took your time and walked it whilst taking in the sights it was awesome. Plenty of shops to occupy you as you strolled and soaked up the hustle bustle of the city. The rooms themselves were clean and comfortable. The staff were excellent and the location was fine. A lot of history on Lexington...i loved every minute of my stay in NYC and even tho i ve been several times i cannot wait to go back and enjoy it all over again.

<Title>“Great location - Average Hotel”
<Content>Hotel is in a great location, with a subway stop right around the corner and easily walkable to Grand Central, and close many restaurants, bars and shops along Lex, Madison, Park, etc. The rooms are in serious need of renovations, and from some reviews lately I see that is currently underway, so I assume my room has yet to be renovated. Room decor resembled a dorm room. Decent size room for NYC, it just needs to be upgraded. Hotel staff was friendly upon check-in, etc. The doorman was very helpful and informative. He arranged a car service for my trip to the airport and told me a little about the GE building across the street. I checked my bags at the desk since my flight was after checkout and there was a $4 fee to do so. Paid $2 upfront and $2 when getting my bags. Normally I tip the staff $5 for storing my bags, but I was never charged a fee to do this anywhere else. I paid the fee and kept the tip for myself. Other small things: greeted with a warm chocolate chip cookie upon arrival. Wifi is $15/day in the rooms, but free in the lobby.

<Title>“Renovation time, not a good time”
<Content>If you are planning on staying at the Doubletree in the next few weeks, think again. They are renovating the premises and things are dusty , at best! We arrived to find that the floor was shaking with drilling noise. The staff (all very accommodating) moved us to a lower floor however, the room was shabby, there was dirt under the bed and the worst of it was a bathroom which reeled of cigarette smoke. During our entire stay the bathroom emitted such a string stench that we kept the door closed. After showering the entire ceiling dripped continuously with water. Hurry up with the renovations Hilton! Even the cookies can't keep up with the mess!

<Title>“PERFECT location!”
<Content>This hotel is a wonderful Doubletree Hotel. The rooms are slightly smaller than I am used to from a Doubletree, but then again, it is in the heart of NYC. The location is absolutely perfect. There is a Metro station on the corner of the hotel (literally). It is one of the side exits from the Metro, so it is not very busy, but does make it convenient to jump onboard the Green line. To me, the location makes up for any negatives to the room itself...because of that golden rule...location, location, location. To be right next to the metro can save you lots of time as you are touring the city and it can give you an "easy" stop to go back to the hotel to drop off purchases, etc, and then just keep going. You cannot trade that. Wonderful friendly staff. Warm chocolate chip cookie on arrival. The hotel main areas are not hugely popular, so the hotel is a little more quiet with that regard (i.e. its not "the" place to hang out) There is a police station on the side street near the hotel, so that can make extra noise on one side of the hotel. Additionally, if you walk a block behind the hotel, you will find a little grocery store, which is nice to pick up some snacks. There are also a few fast food restaurants on that street. Breakfasts are not included unless you have a special package deal...even then, it is not up to the cost of what you paid extra for the package. There are plenty of places to get a better breakfast for the same price or cheaper.

<Title>“Surprised At How Bad This Place Is”
<Content>My friend checked in first and arrived in the room to find they were using a jackhammer in the room directly above. After complaining, we were told "the website said there was construction". At least they don't work on the weekend. When I checked in the front desk person was not friendly and seemed to bristle when I asked a couple of questions since my friend checked in first. The halls are hot and heavily perfumed. The room was okay, but the bathroom was pretty bad. The shower still had hair in it as did the back of the bathroom door (hair stuck to it). This place is in desparate need of renovations. It's currenty 5:42 pm and our room has still not been cleaned. I love the location, but I won't be staying here again. I'm surprised Doubletree would allow their name to be associated with a property like this.

<Title>“Cool hotel, nice price”
<Content>We chose the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel in our last trip to NYC because of its location in a quiet area, yet close to the most touristic places. Our room was perfect, big and clean, with a comfy bed and flat TV and even though it overlooked a fire fighter station on 51st street, we didn't have trouble sleeping thanks to well-insulated windows. This hotel is cool, with a relaxed spirit and more than OK for the price of the room ($200) Service was excellent and attentive, making their best to make you feel confortable and cozy, despite the fact that the hotel is big, with lots of rooms. Make sure to get your Welcome Cookie when you check in...it´s more than welcome if you are landing after a 10-hour flight!

<Title>“Great New York hotel at a reasonable cost”
<Content>When looking for a hotel in New York, we didn't want to spend a lot, knowing we would be spending most of our time out and about in the city. However, we also wanted something safe, clean and comfortable for our time at the hotel. We found all of that in this hotel. It appeared that they were in the process of renovating (we weren't in a reno. room), but even the older rooms were clean and comfortable. We were able to get a great rate ($150 a night). It was surprisingly quiet at night. Times Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue, etc are all within walking distance. A great choice for someone visiting the city for the first time. The hotel staff was also very helpful. They did charge to hold our bags for the day (we were flying out at night), which surprised us.

<Content>A nice hotel in a quieter area of Manhattan. It was a little bit noisy one of the mornings since they had a street fair outside, I think sunday for Veterans Day or something, but we shopped and got some cheap souvenirs and great crepes from the street venders. Easy cab ride to everything, close to the subway, and a cheap rate for Manhattan.

<Title>“Quiet and refreshing stay in NY - rare at this price”
<Content>After several stays in NY the past few years, this hotel was by far the best for a lower price point. I booked through get a room for $189 per night and found the hotel a great spot for this price. I think the normal booking price is higher so maybe it's just a slow season. Location on Lex and 51st is right in the middle of midtown and is perfect for walking. The rooms were clean and compared to other NY hotels they're quite good. Bed was comfortable, nice flat screen tv and the quiet was really rare for NY hotels. Room 647 was a-ok.

<Title>“Nice hotel but not up to par with expectations”
<Content>Expected much nicer for how much we paid. We stayed at the Intercontinental times square for about the same price and the intercontinental was much more luxurious. The Doubletree is a very simple hotel that tries to be more than it is. The hotel is clean, safe, & is great if your just planning on being in your room to sleep. The location is alright but nothing spectacular. In my honest opinion, I feel you would be much better off spending the same amount at one of the better hotels nearby.

<Content>A very nice hote, This hotel is not far from time sq, I walked all around central new York from here, central park, broadway, time sq & all the shoppes near Macy's, The rooms a very simple Hilton like ? All the basic ammmeniets in the room, The Reasturant is in the basement and served a good breakfast, I didn't have any lunch or dinner there, it was to gloomy for that, the bar was. A great hang out place with loud music late in the evenings, But you couldnet hear it once you got in the lift, When u arrive they give you a hot chocolate cookie, which is delicious, The doormen & porters try to put you in a private car when you ask for a taxi, but it's the same price..... A very practical place to stay, I'll be back very soon

<Title>“Crowded, huge hotel, tiny rooms, good location”
<Content>Booked a room for one night for around $170, around new year's eve. The lobby was teeming with people: waiting in line to check in, check out, just walking around, or looking for the ticket counter. Elevators are always busy. Corridors are dim-lit and not very nice. Renovations seem to be imminent (January 2012). Heating in my room was not working, which was not very convenient for mid-winter. Called housekeeping, and after reviewing the AC unit they determined it should be changed, Nothing they could do until the next morning, so they offered to get a small portable heater. The front desk offered another room on the same floor. Both of the rooms were minute, barely enough for 2 people. Space between the bed and the wall was extremely narrow, views out of the window were very urban, but nice. The overall feel was that pending renovations would be very welcome. I could actually hear the banging of hammers for these renovations elsewhere in the hotel - they started at 8:00 am! Bathroom was also small, but usable. Toiletries were OK. Next door cafeteria was convenient. Being right beside a subway station entrance is a plus - probably the only one for this hotel.

<Title>“Average Hotel, Nothing Special and not personal”
<Content>It's a BIG hotel, about 700 rooms or so, so ensure you know where you sign up to. This hotel is like a factory, it was my first time in New York and would have loved a bit of curtsey on check in. My check in lasted about 30 seconds ("good evening, passport and your credit card please", followed by "room 644") I stayed 2 nights, the room was ok but the heating system was not the best on the planet, it was -10 at night (Celsius) and the room did not stay warm. Also there is a firestation and a police station across the road, so be prepared for some "action". The worst was the last night, the hotel porters push your bill through the door so you dont need to check out. A nice thing but i woke up from the noise of things being pushed through the door and through someone came in my room. It's a ok base for New York, but there is nothing "great" about this, it's factory style sleeping in a good location. So, Average, nothing special nothing really "wrong" but nothing what would make me come back.... or is this why they give you a cookie on check in, true, that's probably why, If a cookie is enough to make you feel welcome, go! otherwise, pick something else.

<Title>“Got bites on my leg from this hotel”
<Content>I got bites on my leg from this hotel room. The hotel itself is in bad need of a make over. The rooms are small dark and dirty, despite the best efforts of the over-worked house keeping staff. Who are very nice hard working people..... But, the overall hotel is in dire need of a make over. The bathrooms are small and dingy. The rooms are carpeted with carpet that looks like it was secondhand when they put it down many, many years ago. My bed bugs left a nice little marks on the legs as a souvenir of my visit, which are disgusting. I will never stay there again.

<Title>“OK hotel -- don't go in with high expectations”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel in December 2011. For $429/night, I was unimpressed. The room itself was OK, but the bathroom was terrible. It badly needed a makeover. There was mold in the shower, places where the wallpaper was nonexistent or pulled back & I could see the wall. There is a W a block away for about the same price -- stay there instead. The difference is night & day. On the positive side, it is a great location in midtown Manhattan and the lobby staff was helpful and kind.

<Title>“Very Efficient, Well Placed Hotel in Manhatten”
<Content>Stayed in the Doubletree in New York over New Year for 3 nights. You don't get a particularly warm feeling , more a feeling of efficiency, which i don't mind at all. Very well located, within walking distance of The Rock, 5th Avenue and Times Square. There is also a great little deli/cafe next door!

<Title>“Great Location and Comfort but a bit loud”
<Content>My fiance and I were just stayed at this hotel over this past weekend. This hotel is very nice, clean and has such a friendly staff. The location of this hotel is awesome too. The 51st subway station is literally right outside their door, which is great! My one and only complaint is that it is a noisey hotel (they even give you ear plugs in the room to wear at night). The police and fire station are right next to hotel. So if it is a busy night for them, you will hear the sirens. I know the hotel is doing some renovating so maybe this will help. But i honestly would highly reccommend this hotel to people!

<Title>“Nice hotel great location - but ripped off by the concierge”
<Content>A nice hotel in a great location close to 5th AV, Rockefeller Centre and Times Square. Just beside a subway station. But the concierge left a bad experience. We booked a show, but the concierge charged us double the price. We wouldn't mind a fee or commission but not twice the ticket price.

<Title>“Reliable”
<Content>I've stayed at this location several times and always liked it. You cannot beat the location. Walking distance to Rockefeller Center, and a little longer distance to Grand Central Station. It is right on the subway line that can take you to Grand Central, Union Square, Spring St and others. There is a 24-hour Metro Cafe right next door that is overpriced but fresh and good and convenient. The room rates can be very good, depending on the time of year and when you book. The rooms are always clean, if small. No shortage of hot water or heat. The warm cookies at check in are nice but they need to skip the nuts. The bar was OK; $9 for a glass of California Sauvignon Blanc but add in state tax, etc. and it came to $10.35. This trip was a little disappointing. We went through a new room each day due to some problem but at least, each was more spacious! The effort by management was appreciated but the moving was a little tiring.

<Title>“WORST EVER EXPERIENCE”
<Content>The showcase pictures looked great; the price was super. The reality, though, sucked, and the legal term for this is fraud. From the filthy lobby floors we walked into, to the stiff and smelly towels stacked in the showcase room we were switched to -- the first room was harrowing -- this hotel was about a notch up America's most terrible motels. The best part of it all: an arcane billing system that may leave your credit card racked with double the fees and charges you initially agreed to. This is week three for me and I have yet to be redeemed for charges the hotel assured me it would have released upon my check out. DoubleFee, than DoubleTree, seems a money suitable name.

<Title>“Except bed linens, good hotel”
<Content>This is a nice hotel that is well located and with nice room amenities. The shower pressure was great and we didn't hear noise from other rooms. My boyfriend noticed that the bottom sheet on the bed was not put on properly and the matress was exposed...see the photo. We know the sheet fits properly because we actually remade the bed just fine. So it was laziness / sloppiness on the part of the housekeeping staff...not okay in a hotel of this caliber. Otherwise, no complaints, and great warm cookies at check in as usual!

<Title>“Quick Check-in, Good location”
<Content>This hotel was a last minute add-on to a New Year's trip to NYC. Its in close proximity to some of the sights we wanted to fit in our arrival evening.... Rockefeller Center, Radio City and Bryant Park. 10min walk from this hotel location. Lobby was a little tight spaced, rooms were also just a typical hotel room versus the 2-rm suite I usually get with the Doubletree, but the rate was very reasonable for the location and the room was nicely furnished and clean. Bathrooms could use a touch up job, and I do believe the hotel was in the process of a facelift. Check in was quick and room requested with 2beds was available.

<Title>“Great location. Service and rooms sub par.”
<Content>Stayed 2 nights after Christmas holiday. Location of hotel is fantastic. Rooms are old and outdated needed a lot of car. Cracks in bathtub and wallpaper peeling off walls. Furniture very old as well. I'm a Hilton Diamond and i requested extra towels and pillows prior to arriving which i did not receive. At check-in i was not offered an upgraded room and was given a 4th floor room over looking the heating and ventilation system. Apparently there is a lot of work going on on the higher floors. Exec lounge was not available either. We ate breakfast in the restaurant on the lobby level which was fine but i noticed that this doubletree only gives free breakfast to 1 adult and 1 child for Diamond members. Typically it is free for 2 adults. I have to admit i got the rooms at a very competitive price so i shouldn't complain but i think i'd rather pay an extra $30 next time to stay in a more updated hotel. Valet parking was fine, doorman got us into the hotel quickly and the car was parked. I was charged a higher fee for my car ($64 per day) which i wasn't charged at the Doubletree Times Square the week before so i found that to be very odd. Overall, i'd only go back there if i was determined to go to NYC on the cheap.

<Title>“Great location. Great service. Awful property.”
<Content>I have stayed next door at the "W", the Waldorf Astoria, and the Intercontinental. I love this location when I stay in NYC. So, the location is great, if not pricey, normally. The property is in a great location. The service, too, was great. From check-in, to all services, staff were attentive and caring. Now the awful part: Yikes! This property is in need of a make-over. And they were working on it, too! That was part of the awful part. At two minutes to 9:00 AM, the walls started vibrating and kept vibrating. I was on the 9th floor and they were doing construction on 17th floor and above, but it was very loud. Sounded like it was coming from the next room. When I called to complain that it woke us up (it WAS supposed to be a vacation morning), they offered us earplugs. Really? That was what the "careline" was offering as a caring gesture? It was an odd stay, for certain. The fire alarm had gone off the day before and when I called about it, concerned, they were just interested in getting it shut off. (you mean no one was worried there was a fire?). I haven't read the reviews here about the property, so if I am being redundant, I apologize. The paint is peeling from the ceiling and walls - I think because there is no ventilation system in the bathroom. After both of us had showered, the room held so much humidity, it was necessary to open the door to the hall to get air in. The windows didn't seem to open. The heating/cooling system worked fine for my comfort, with the exception of this. The privacy lock was broken on my door. There were paint specks all over the floor and walls of the bathroom. The towel bar was not hung, though the holes were there to hang it. With all of that said, it was very clean and well kept. Sheets and bedding were very comfortable with nice pillows. The safe worked. The water pressure was good and hot water was plentiful. Good towel quality. No robes. But a good working hair dryer and shampoo products. (my daughter did mention that everyone in the elevator smelled the same from the personal care products.) We were not facing the street so it was quieter than it would have been with the street noise in a room on the opposite side. However, no view whatsoever and the building next door looks right in to the room. Again, nice window treatments to address this. The room size was comfortable because we ended up getting a double even though I had reserved a queen. It was spacious for New York City. Getting our boarding passes printed was very easy in the lobby area and the gift shop was well stocked. I am sure once this property is updated by Hilton (they just took it over a year ago?) two things will occur: one it will be to Hilton quality standards across the board and two, the prices will skyrocket. For now, for a good rate, it is worth it, if like on most NYC trips, you are only going to be in the room to sleep. My one regret: I bought the room as part of a Jet Blue package and the rate was the same as the hotel offered, but I did not get my points for staying there as a Hilton Honors member. I would not ever do this again. The travel service lied to me and told me to just give my honors number upon arrival. Jet Blue has a deceptive service provider. I had a few problems with inconsistencies in email confirmations, pricing and service fees. They made me nervous and in the future, I will book the room directly myself. Sorry Jet Blue!

<Title>“First choice hotel but parking garage awful”
<Content>Let me preface this review by saying that I lived in NYC for 40 years before moving out of town to the suburbs. We have tried a number of midtown hotels but this one ranks the best to us and is reasonable in price and we stopped searching around for better alternatives. We have stayed here about ten times in total. What is especially good is the location. Right by the subway as well as easy walking distance to most things in midtown. The rooms are clean (I always check my hotel rooms with a flashlight for bugs) but one of these years could use a little updating. The bathrooms are tiny. The beds are comfortable and the sleep quality is good. The check in staff are hit or miss, mostly friendly but sometimes could care less. What prompted me to write a review here is is that they have a parking garage which we use which unfortunately does not take good care of your car. Two stays ago the bumper got scratched by the cement wall they parked it against and this time the passenger side mirror had a one inch scratch (apparently because they do not take the time to adjust the mirrors by the interior controls and instead force them by hand to save time and the attendant must have worn a sharp ring). There were also sneaker prints on the bumpers, they must really park the cars very close and they need to climb over them. Frustrating, they would not own up to the fact of damaging my mirror telling me it happened elsewhere and after a few minute debate the manager basically told us to get the car out of the driveway and then walked away from us. I'm considering filling a report with the NYC consumer affairs which likely will be a waste of time and really don't know where to park my car next time I come into the city and honestly might be in the market for a better hotel again because of this. However, overall this is a good place that is not too expensive and in a great location and overall clean. Just consider not taking your care here.

<Title>“Fine stay”
<Content>I was incredibly apprehensive of this hotel after reading prior TripAdvisor reviews - which ranged from good to awful. Overall, I felt the hotel was fine. I have to concur with many reviews that the hotel rooms and hallways are in need of renovation. Carpeting needs to be cleaned; wallpaper needs to be replaced in corridors, bathrooms and rooms. The rooms were average size for New York standards, but the sleep was certainly comfortable enough. There are complaints about the NYPD 17th Precinct and a fire station that is next door - this could be an issue if you are on a low floor (5 or lower), but we were not affected by it. All of the room decor and condition issues will be resolved soon as the rooms undergo a complete renovation (examples of the decoration palates are on display in the lobby). The breakfast (included in our rate) was fine. The Met Grill staff was terrific - especially Bolivar who waited our table all three days. Management should give this man a serious raise - he deserves it. The concierge staff, bell staff, and front desk staff were all good and we have several requests taken care of promptly. We arrived early (before 2:00 pm) and we had rooms immediately available. Checkout was quick. The hotel location was fine for our needs - convenient to the Theater district; directly on the East side 4/5/6 subway lines, and within 1.5 miles of Penn Station. For the price, a good stay - especially over Christmas. A higher rating would be given for improvements in the physical condition of the rooms...

<Title>“Not Up To Hilton Standards”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for one night in December 2011, and was extremely underwhelmed with the service and quality I experienced at the property. It was certainly not what have come to expect from the Hilton family. Although the location was excellent (only a short walk from many of New York's major attractions), the room was small, the heating was up too high with no way to adjust the thermostat, and worst of all, all of the water sources in the room released brown water with a pungent odour - this in a city renowned for the quality of its tap water! I called the "Careline" and was told an engineer was being sent to the room, but no engineer ever came. I was eventually able to get clean water myself by running the taps for about fifteen minutes. Hilton HHonors Gold members should also be wary of this hotel. It took a considerable amount of effort - several phone calls both to front desk and HHonors, and two physical visits downstairs - to receive the free breakfast to which Gold members are entitled. I was given several stories by staff as to why I was not entitled to a free breakfast, including that Hilton has stopped offering breakfast to Gold members, or that this hotel is a franchise that has opted out of the breakfast benefit for Golds. I confirmed with Hilton HHonors that neither of these excuses are true. Eventually I was told by the Duty Manager that the Executive Lounge (where breakfast is usually taken) was closed due to the renovations that commenced two days before my stay, but that I was able to take my free breakfast in the hotel restaurant instead. This was all well and good, but I have since found out that other HHonors members have been in the Executive Lounge on and after the date of my stay - so this was a lie as well! It seems that hotel staff, management included, have no clue what they are talking about when it comes to HHonors benefits.

<Content>We visited New York for 2 nights and stayed at Metropolitan Doubletree Hilton. It wes like a nightmare! The first day the rooms were not ready, and we had to wait until 7 pm to have our rooms (despite our reservation 1 month ago!). Than, the rooms were not clean (especially bathrooms). The night was also terrible, because we could hear any small noise from the door, up down, everwhere... And the last day, at the check out time we had to wait more than 1 hour for our car coming from the garage (it supposed to came in 5 to 10 minutes).. The only good thing that remains is the good location of the hotel... It shouldn't be a "Hilton"

<Title>“Doubletree Metro - great location”
<Content>This hotel is in a great location. My husband and I traveled to NYC (my first time) last week for 5 days for my birthday. We were greeted by a beautiful lobby and a friendly front desk staff. One of the major downfalls was that the room left a lot to be desired. While I didn't mind the size (we had a King deluxe which was actually larger than I expected for NYC standards), the room was very dingy. Everything seemed clean enough, but a little undone. There was wallpaper coming off the walls, bathroom hardware wasn't completely attached, only the heat was turned on so we couldn't cool off our hot room, etc (we were later advised by the front desk staff that we could open our window to let a little cool air in to cool it off). I recognize that the hotel is about to be renovated and that's probably why small things have not been fixed. But is that really an excuse? Seems like guests who are staying there before the renovation are being punished for not booking their stay after the renovation. Another major disappointment was the concierge staff. Each time we called concierge to ask a question (i.e. info on cabs, or recommendations for dinner) they didn't answer. We even left voice messages for them and they never returned our call. We wound up having to call the front desk staff (who, again, were super friendly) for information. One night, around 8pm, we walked down to the concierge desk (because we couldn't get them on the phone) to ask for dinner recommendations. It was my birthday and we wanted to go somewhere fun but had a hard time choosing based on what we could find online. To our surprise (again, this was about 8pm), the concierge desk was closed. Who closes their concierge desk before 8pm on a Saturday? Seems like you should know people are going to be asking for dinner recommendations. Isn't that a huge portion of what concierge staff do? Positives: friendly front desk staff, great location (you are literally 4-5 blocks from Rockefeller Center), a major subway (the 6) is next door, the Cafe Metro next door was really good, inexpensive, and stayed open until 11pm in case you needed an after dinner snack. I am very picky about hotel beds and found this one very comfortable to sleep in after long days walking around NYC. The lobby smelled wonderful too! I would definitely stay here again after the hotel rooms have been renovated.

<Title>“Really a 2 star acting as if a 4 star”
<Content>Having stayed at this hotel approximately 5 and then 3 years ago for Christmas time trips, I thought I would try it again. Very mixed results. The GOOD: 1. Easy walk to Rockefeller Center-great for the holidays; 2. Lexington Ave. subway stop right there; 3. Price; 4.Breakfast included with room- very good breakfast and incredibly nice folks who work in the breakfast area; Comfortable beds. The BAD: 1. Room (now being in New York City one should really only be in the room to sleep and shower however...)- this room reminded me of my road trip days travelling with friends and trying to find the cheapest room available- wallpaper pealing in main room and all over the bathroom (along with lots of rust, some mold) due to absolutely no ventilation; thermostat hanging off wall (room 303 if management reads this and cares), but it didn't matter because it didn't seem to control anything as we had to open window to cool room down and get circulation and heating and a/c unit had obviously seen much better days; moldy smell in closet as it appeared water from shower had leaked into it at some point; Carpet had not been given good cleaning in quite some time; Each morning we had a towel shortage and had to call housekeeping to correct. Now when you arrive at the hotel there are numerous people working the lobby in different capacities and this gives the hotel an upscale veneer, but I would recommend that management along with some of these employees go room to room and take note of the serious problems. Will not stay again unless I hear of some improvement.

<Title>“Very Nice Hotel”
<Content>We went 21st November 2011 - there were 5 'young at heart' ladies and 1 young lady - and were where very impressed - we arrived and unfortunately we were given king size rooms for three in each room but only with 1 bed (bit difficult) so we rang down to reception and they were changed immediatly to 2 rooms with double beds in (apparently got us mixed up with the very nice man that knocked on our door thinking he had the same room....... shame) (55chicos - thats what the ear plugs were for then, we did not need them either - We were on the Police station side also, on the 6th floor) - we did not eat in the hotel but the Cafe next door and one down the next block towards Bloomingdales on the same side of the road this was the better one and value for money - impressed with the cookie for each of us upon arrival at the hotel they were lovely - the hotel shop was very reasonable bought 2 sweatshirts for 40$ - very nice place no bugs, clean towels every day could not fault it - very close to most of the sites - Central park, Bloomingdales, Macys, Times square, Rockafella centre, the Subway is next door for the Up Town and one block up for Down Town - dont forget to go to 9/11 Memorial, is a must, beautiful even tho still building work still going on (Breaks your Heart) other than that all is very safe in the area, never felt threatened at all even at night

<Title>“Great location, shame about the HH benefits!”
<Content>The positives of the hotel is the location. The hotel is great if you want to take a slow walk out to Times Square or see any of the local sights. Considering the price of some of the other hotels right in Times Square, this was perfect as we paid $139 by booking through hilton.co.uk The room was comfortable and clean. Our bath didn't work and the maintenance guy had to spend over 20 minutes trying to fix it. In the end he was unable to fix the problem so we just moved rooms, however this was not an issue. The one thing that did bother me was the fact that as a Hilton Gold member you get certain perks, one being free breakfast. However, when i checked in I was informed that this is not the case any more at this hotel and that all Gold members were sent an email which explained this. The women at check in said that this policy changed last week. Rather surprised at this, but understanding that I may have missed this email I went to the room and rang Hilton Honors direct and spoke to them. They were also surprised at this and told me that I will be having breakfast. Next morning when checking out the breakfast appeared on my bill. I informed the person that this should not be there. This women said that Doubletree have not given breakfasts to Gold members for over a year??? So getting 2 different types of information. In the end the breakfast was taken off the bill, but if your booking this hotel as an HHonors member be very aware, as there is clearly an issue at this property over who is intilted to what!!

<Title>“Its not as bad as I read in some of the post”
<Content>Just stayed at this hotel last week 12/4-9/11 and got a great room. Very clean - no noise at night. Always had fresh towels and a turn down service when I got in. No bed bugs, no loud noises and loved the cookie upon check-in. It was a pleasant stay and the staff from housekeeping all the way to front desk were very friendly. The only thing I didn't like was the price. I know that I went during the 1st week in Dec but really 400.00 a night! thats the most I have ever paid in NYC! We had no choice as other hotels in the area were sold out. I would return to this hotel but during off peak time.

<Title>“Excellent staff, comfortable but in need of significant updating”
<Content>I recently stayed for one night at this Hilton affiliated Doubletree located on Lexington Avenue at 51st street in New York City. While the lobby is fairly nice if not fancy, the sleeping room and bathroom were dated and in serious need of renovation. The room and bathroom were clean though, and the bed was quite comfortable. The negatives were the insufficient number of electrical outlets, flimsey and cheap looking bathroom fixtures, antiquated heating/cooling system, old carpeting and furniture and flaking paint and buldging wall paper in the bathroom. Free internet was in the lobby only with wireless and hard wire internet for a fee in the room. The room did have a nice large screen HD television. There are phtographs all over the lobby concerning the apparent major renovation project that is coming in 2012. While recognizing that hotel prices in NYC are through the roof, espcially in December, I did expect a bit more for the accomodations for the rate I paid. This Doubltree has a breakfast only restaurant but the area of the hotel has everything anyone might need by way of dining or otherwise, 24 hours a day.

<Title>“A little "rough around the edges" but great staff.”
<Content>This was my second stay at this Doubletree, so I think I knew what to expect. It was a little rough around the edges, but the staff worked hard to resolve my issues. I actually changed rooms twice right after checking in, but the staff seemed more than willing to let me move around until I found a room that suited me. I can't imagine paying $400+/night here as some others have mentioned -- I paid something like $180/night for a "junior suite" which I thought was a reasonable price for a midtown Manhattan hotel. That being said, I think the value was good.

<Title>“Good location, no amenities, POOR acknowledgment from accounting.”
<Content>Stayed in room 1526 on the side of the building. Hotel is in a good location. Near the 51st & Lexington train stop and only about a 20 minute walk to Times Square. Other than that, nothing else. Lobby very small and awkward design. Small sitting area. Small bar, but bartender staff were very informative and polite. Bartender gave us suggestions for dinner and produced his own list of places nearby. Nice area in the morning to get some coffee, juice or muffin. Room was outdated and clean. Decent size bedroom area. Had a space for mini bar, but area had not mini bar? Maid service was very good. Nice thing was to have windows that can open slightly. Bathroom very small. Sink area separated from rest of room and bathroom. Cramped area, no place to place toiletries. One this I have to say, "water pressure and hot water was no issue". Was great to take a hot shower whenever you wanted. No restaurant on property, except a banquet room in next area that served a decent breakfast buffet. Staff was attentive and polite, but noticed with other guests, were more removed. Price was typical of a hotel. Check out went smoothly. Had a charge on room that I wasn't sure was mine. Clerk took off charges since he couldn't locate receipt, plus accounting wasn't open. I had other charges that I paid for other than the room and tax. However, a month later, the charge shows up on my credit card. Although it was about $22, I contacted the hotel, both by phone and fax, regarding the charge. All I asked was they show me a copy of the charge, NOT ONCE have they responded. Still waiting for a response. I was there for 5 days at $295 a night. Needless to say, I expected better from them. I had a better stay at the Mariott Marquis and the Crowne Plaza in Times Square!

<Title>“Very disappointing”
<Content>I booked a room here because of its location to my business meeting and I had points for a free night. I definitely got what I paid for. When I walked into the room it had a musty smell and the thermostat had no control over temperature or air flow in the room. I then knew I was in trouble when I saw the complementary ear plugs. You don't need the ear plugs for the street noise; you need them because the walls are paper thin. As I unpacked and open some drawers and closet doors, I uncovered a smoke smell, in a non-smoking room. At least the bed and bathroom were clean. Although the Internet was very fast, $15/day is ridiculous. As a Hilton Honors member, I am very disappointed. I doubt I will return here.

<Title>“You can do better.”
<Content>For $424 a night you can do better. The cons: My queen room was tiny and drab. A hospital room has more color and personality. No upgrade for a Gold member. No breakfast room. No restaurant open in the afternoon. $16 for internet service. Rooms tiny. Bathroom about the size you would get on a cruise ship. Bellman provided me with ridiculously incorrect walking directions to another hotel (he said 2 blocks and it was 10 plus). In room, paint peeling, headboard stained, and window shades damaged. The pros: good location, good water pressure in the shower, standard nice doubletree bed, wireless works well, big tv. Would have preferred my usual haunt (NY Hilton) but it was sold out. A college stayed at the Marriott Marquius for much less and that is a far nicer hotel -- I got burned for my Hilton loyal on this one.

<Title>“Comfortable and affordable”
<Content>We forgot to book a hotel for our trip to NY and got a really good last minute deal at this hotel. The room was very comfortable, clean and quiet... exactly what you would expect from a Doubletree Hotel. The only things I would mark the hotel down on were that when we arrived and checked in at 1am, the desk clerk told us we had to wait for a few minutes before the room would be available. In the end, it was only about 10 minutes, but at 1am, after traveling all day and needing to wake up 4 1/2 hours later, it seemed like an eternity. It wasn't really clear why we had to wait, but it was a little annoying. At least they gave us a warm cookie while we waited. Then, there was the other kind of weird thing... if we had not had to wait so long in the lobby, we probably wouldn't have noticed the "seedy" element that was coming and going from the hotel. It was a bit of a scene, that is for sure! We are not uptight travelers by any means, but I have to say, I was a bit uncomfortable with the number of women in the lobby trying to coordinate with their "dates" upstairs via cell phone, with phrases like "What was your name again?" I'm sure this hotel is great for some, but I would not recommend it for families or people who are leading sheltered lives... lol.

<Title>“Many pluses, but some minuses”
<Content>Just back home after spending 5 nights at the Doubletree in Lex. Ave, NY. The hotel has many pluses, but also some minuses: Pluses: Great location, close to many sights, such as Rockefeller Center, Times Square and Central Park. Famous buildings such as Chrysler Building and Empire State Building are also nearby. Nice rooms, we had a deluxe room at one of the upper floors. Clean rooms and comfy beds. Polite and helpful staff. Minuses: No breakfast room. Breakfast can be ordered one day in advance and is served at your room. (Many breakfast places in the area.) No fridge or minibar, no tea og coffee facilities. Bathroom could need an upgrade. Wifi is free in the lobby, but has a ridiculous high fee if you want to use it from your room. This is why there is always a lot of people queuing up in the reception area surfing the internet from their laptop or smartphone. High rates, but that´s New York.... All in all - we might be back!

<Title>“Not much for the price”
<Content>Well - I don't expect great prices in New York, but was disappointed with the lack of ambiance and overall friendliness. With 3 of us, the price was OK to share a room. But they added in $15 per night for wifi, the lobby was frenetic and bar service lackadaisical, decor felt dated. There are definitely better options out there.

<Title>“comfortable hotel very well located”
<Content>the first thing struck me about this hotel was location i was surprised how close to everything it is but without the noise and madness. Its a very clean hotel with good size rooms, the furniture clutters it a bit there's a bedside locker, table chest of drawers 2 chairs but it worked out well in the end i was able to store cases in wardrobe and use the chest for all shopping. The bed was really comfortable, sleep quality was great and temperature was perfect, sometimes i find hotels far too warm. The shower is fantastic, bathrooms are good size and there is a hairdryer in the rooms which is great because it saves you packing one and the plugs a re different anyway. Very efficient check in and check out facilities and the staff are very helpful. The subway station is just outside the hotel which is excellent for getting around. Many things are within walking distance too. The hotel also have an airport shuttle service for c. $20 per person avail at the concierge or the bell boys out front have unmarked taxis very comfortable cars for $55 including tolls. note yellow cabs offer $45 but it doesn't include tolls etc. Definitely recommend this as a well located, friendly,comfortable hotel. I would recommend the NYC sightseeing tours too a great way to see the city especially if you are on a short break. the 4 day one is excellent value at $114 as it includes a trip to woodbury common which would cost you $45 anyway and it also includes about 4 bus tours and entry fee to a number of sight plus boat to Statue of Liberty.

<Title>“Decent stay”
<Content>This is not as center as hotels right by Time Square, but it is right next to the subway, so it makes it easy to get anywhere. Lobby area downstairs is modern and well-kept, very nice. Rooms have been updated so they are decent too. The sound from the hallways is pretty loud, as is the sirens from outside. They did provide ear plugs in the room. Our standard king room had a crappy view, but I didn't ask for the city view nor mention I was a travel agent, which usually gets me better rooms. Our room got pretty hot at night, but we didn't bother to change the thermostat, which we should've done before going to bed. Overall, satisfied with it. Nothing to rave about back at home, but decent stay.

<Title>“Great position and clean hotel”
<Content>Decided to stay here as we were on a budget and it was a brilliant price. No breakfast included but that was not a down side to me (actually I didnt even know there was a restaurant here until I read a previous review as there is little evidence of it!!). Perfect location right next to the 6 subway. A friend and I were visiting my daughter who lives in WIlliamsburgh so it was great, straight on the 6 subway then the L train to Bedford. Bit confusing when you get off the subway but that was probably more our fault. Anyway, back to the hotel. On arrival there was a coffin outside which was a bit spooky but it appeared to be a demonstration of some sort, not a representative of the beds! Room was a queen (upgrade to twin was $30 per night so decided against this) which was big enough. Bathroom adequate size - no complaints. Very clean although not sure towels were changed much during our 5 night stay. Huge TV which showed every wrinkle on the breakfast presenters faces!!! Didnt eat in the hotel so cannot comment on food. although service charge on a bottle of wine we drank there was horrendous.. Bit disappointed about lack of tea and coffee making facilities, I dont drink first thing but my friend does and I like a coffee at night time. This was no big deal as there were perfectly good delis along Lexington. Walkable to Central Park (well part of it), Park Ave. Madision and Fifth. Everything pretty much within either a good walk or subway ride. We were on the 9th floor and had no real probs with the lift at all. I did notice that there was an ice machine on our floor but we never used it as we were never in the place long enough. One downside was that there appeared to be no form of heating in the room (although it was comfortable) we had got soaked in the NY downpour and had nowhere to air our clothes. A complaint about a faulty hairdryer also took from 9.00am to 10.00PM to sort out although reception did apologise. Would have been nice to have been advised about wi-fi availability in bedrooms as we were not aware of this - it does not say this on the website. Taking everything into account I would stay here again, but to be honest that would be more for the location than the hotel itself. My husband and I are booked for January and are staying at the Thirty Thirty. next time.

<Title>“Dated experience”
<Content>Great location, but the hotel itself is pretty dated. Our room left quite a bit to be desired - no adjustable thermostat (it was on or off, hot or cold - nothing in between), shabby carpet, paint chipping into stalactites in the bathroom, security lock on the door in poor shape. I do have to praise the fitness room though - one of the best I've been to in a hotel, and they didn't charge for it! I guess it was a good deal for what we paid for it, but you don't want to expect much.

<Content>When I started going to this hotel about 10 years ago, it had just been renovated. Well, they've waited too long. The room was shabby, the carpet warn, the bathroom wallpaper falling off, and the plumbing coming out of the wall. They did post a note in the lobby that they are renovating in 2012, but I'm not going back until it's done! They waited a bit too long.

Staff was good. Check in fast at 2PM. Looked crowded later. Room was nice and clean. Only negative is that in winter you can only use heat in room. We went on a room day and even with heat off, room was dry at night. overall great place if you can get a good price.

<Content>We chose to stay here because it was so close to Rockerfeller Center and Radio City, not to mention a short walk to a great view for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The room was awesome. Clean and very comfortable. The staff were pleasant when checking in and checking out. Nice lounge for drinks and wonderful buffet breakfast on Thanksgiving morning as they were closed the remainder of that day. Next door a great deli for breakfast, lunch and snacks! The price was right for us to stay in Manhatten for 2 nights!! There are other Hotels close by, but they were at a much higher price point. Double tree was great for us. We liked our warm chocolate cookies we received at check in. My only complaint: no coffee maker in the room, but as I said we got coffee next door at the Deli and brought it up to our room!!!!

<Title>“Nice, but nothing special: New York style service”
<Content>I chose to stay here one night because of its convenient location in Manhattan. I made a very short trip to the U.S., stayed a few nights in Queens (New York) and Boston, then to New York again just in time to see the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade before I fly back home. It was a nice hotel; comfortable room, cozy bed, excellent location, but apart from that I don't think there was anything special. Checking-in was quick and efficient, and so was checking-out, but no one smiled or made you feel special as a guest. The security guard even checked my ID as I came back at night, even though I showed my room key (I have no problems with security check, but some courtesy and friendliness would make guests feel better). I guess it was just regular, New York-style, businesslike, impersonal treatment. Back home if I stayed at a Hilton hotel, especially with a room rate like this (USD 200++), I would be treated like a royalty!

<Title>“This is NOT a good hotel - poor attitudes from staff!”
<Content>I stay at the Double Tree quite regularly because my company has a contract with them. As a result I was told by one rather rude front desk manager that I didn't have the right to complain, as I wasn't paying for the room. (Can you believe it.....typical New Yorker attitude). The cleaning staff are loud, disturbing your sleep. I get faxes sent to the hotel: they lose them and then when I insist that they were sent, they look a little harder, find it then don't have the decency to apologize. I get incorrect wake up calls from the operator: when I tell the manager he doesn't even apologize for it. One manager said "oh well, we are working on trying to get our operator staff to get it right, but they are unionized" (Kurt - Front Desk Manager). This is a crap hotel.....If I could get the company to move our group I would....but they must have offered them a great deal! If you have a choice DO NOT STAY HERE.....there are much better places in Manhattan.

<Title>“Larger than Average Rooms for NYC; subpar Executive Lounge”
<Content>My first stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan probably won't be my last. First thing you notice: the room size is really large compared to other Manhattan hotels. Some of the decor, including rugs, wall paper, paint, etc, looks very worn, but they are in the process of a renovation. The staff was accommodating and aimed to please, especially Rachel, one of the food and beverage mgrs, who helped me overcome a specific room service issue I had during my stay. I was disappointed with the Executive Lounge, however. The breakfast offerings were weak, and when i wanted to complain about the stale bread and lack of working toaster, there was no one around to talk too. Other hotels offer drinks, or at least hot coffee or tea throughout the day...this one has neither. Luckily, I didn't pay extra for access as a gold member, and I would not advise anyone to do so.

<Content>We were looked after well. Check in guy wished us a happy anniversary. We received an upgrade and were on 17th floor. Some of their rooms have been updated so important to make sure you ask for those. Room was large for NYC for the budget. Location is super central and on Saturday the whole area is closed for a big street market (nice). Thanks to Jasmine for taking good care of us...P.S. If you want, from JFK, take Airport Train to Jamaica and then take subway to "51st and Lexington", that's a 2 minute walk and total budget $7.50, total time 45-60 minutes.

There is a subway stop directly outside of the hotel and food options are plentiful. The hotel seems to have recently completed renovations, which were well done.

<Title>“What you'd expect”
<Content>Was fortunate to get a good deal on a room through a website, otherwise I don't think I would have stayed as it would have been beyond my budget. Great sized room for NYC, but traveling alone the 2 double beds made the room a bit cramped - I guess for couples/friends traveling together that wouldn't be an issue. (But going on what most NYC hotels have to offer the room was HUGE!!) Bathroom was a bit outdated, but clean and nice products. Sink took a long time to drain (but a minor issue that could be lived with!) Bed was VERY comfortable as were the pillows. It snowed the one day and I was very reluctant to move too far from the comfort! Staff were mostly friendly and the concierge gave sound advice on attractions, restaurants and shows. Only staff that didn't make the grade was on check out when I was enquiring about staying on...and he was the manager on duty - strange?! Never tried the lobby-bar out - but it was always humming. Cookies were a nice touch, BUT (and this is a BIG BUT considering it is free in most public places throughout the city and in all starbucks) as a paying guest you have to pay for wifi??? Seriously?!!!

<Title>“Nothing special but expensive”
<Content>I guess I shouldn't "look a gift horse in the mouth". The reservation for our room was made by some friends from California who were coming East to visit us and then stay a couple of nights in the city before going home. Our friends made the reservations long in advance and chose a non-refundable rate of $379 plus tax ($404 per night total with tax). Unfortunately, a few weeks before their trip the wife injured her back and had to have surgery. They could not use the reservation and transferred the name on the reservation to ours. So the room was "free" to us. We had no trouble checking in and we were told they had upgraded our room to a "king room". Also, when we were checking in, I thought i recognized the building and the location and asked if this was formerly the Summit Hotel. The answer was yes. I first stayed in this hotel in 1971, 40+ years ago. When we got to our room we were somewhat shocked at the small size and the furnishings. The room was small and all of the furniture except the bed, flat panel TV and the toilet was the orginal blonde furniture for 40 years ago. When i put my computer on the "desk" and sat in the chair to use it, there was no room for my wife to walk between the bed and desk. There was only one small sitting chair and no ottoman. The rooms are also a bit noisy, since the hotel is right across 51st Street from a police precint and a large fire house (engine and ladder companies). The hotel must know this, since they leave earplugs on the night stand. We did have a nice continental breakfast in their dining room in the mornings. The food was good, albeit, a bit pricey, but that is NYC. My advice would be, unless you absolutely need to be on the East Side, I would choose the Doubletree in Times Sqaure. It is closer to more restaurants and the theaters, but further from the shopping. The rooms are nicer. We were there on 9/11/2001 and have stayed several times since. Also, since this reservation was made through hotels.com it was not eligible for any HHilton Honors points or recognition.

<Title>“Good sized rooms with a small bathroom-well located”
<Content>We stayed here for three nights whilst touring New York. It is located 20 yards from the subway and taxis are all around. The staff are helpful- especially the doorman who know practically everything. there is a reasonable takeaway next door- or Subway 300 yards up the road. The room was large by New York standards, and the bathroom also typical of New York: small and only a tub rather than a bath. Interestingly the room had an air purifier rather than the normal a/c.

<Title>“Lesson learned”
<Content>The hotel left me stranded in New York city. I was disappointed with the customer service provided by hotel management. My hotel was booked through price line, which I advise everybody to never use there service provided because they were not accommodating to my experience which surprised me even more since I paid the extra fee for travel insurance. As for double tree , I called and confirmed my reservations with reservations once my hotel was booked. Unfortunately when I arrived there the room was not a 2 double bed as I was informed to have . Management insisted that staff would never confirm with me that I was all set with the double bed non-smoking. I explained that I would be more than willing to stay at a different double tree or refund my money and still all he would tell me there was nothing he was able to do for me and wanted me to deal with price line. Dealing with price line was worse and it became the blaming game.

<Title>“Nothing special, just a good hotel”
<Content>I was there on a business trip, the hotel was nice and the staff was really helpfull and professional. The location of the hotel is good as well, close to the subway station so you're everywhere fairly quick. I didn't try the restaurant in the hotel since there're so many places closeby but it looked nice. The bathroom was a bit old-fashioned but the shower was good. The view from the room wasn't really good, but I guess if you pay more for a top floor room it is better. Would recommend it for business travellers, for vaction it is a bit plain, but then the rates are pretty good for that location so you might give it a try!

<Title>“Great staff, Great stay !”
<Content>I am so thankfull for the staff that did everything to make my stay at NYC unforgetable. We were celebrated our anniversary and recived a signed card by all the hotel workers together with a cake and a bottle of wine. We asked for a high floor room and got a big room with city view and a balcony on the 18th floor, lots of space.. We stayed 4 nights and 5 days and in one of them was the snow storm. it was so great to stay at the cozy room beside the window and to watched the snow. The hotel has a great location and all the room are about to be renoveted soon. I defently recomond this hotel and for for sure i will come back.

<Title>“Rooms have gone severely downhill”
<Content>I have stayed at the Doubltree Metropolitan about 20 times over the past few years, and this will be my last. Although this was never a high end hotel, the rooms were clean and the staff was alwaysfriendly during prior stays. This stay, i booked a "Pure Allergy Friendly" room at a premium -- $419 a night. As you can see from the attached pictures, the room is poorly maintained, with ripped up carpet in the closet and mold, mildew, and falling ceilings in the bathrooms, My colleagues' rooms had similar problems. One word: YUCK.

<Title>“Doubletree Midtown-nice stay”
<Content>I chose the Doubletree based on the location of the event I was attending. I stayed for five days. It was a great location. Walking distance to central park and a very nice area overall. There were office buildings with people working across the street and Park Avenue a few blocks away. Lots of shops and restaurants. I felt safe walking at night. The customer service at the hotel was top notch. The desk clerk made an effort to remember my name. There was plenty of help, from bell hops to desk clerks to maids. I was impressed with housekeeping staff working into the evening. My room was clean and I am fussy. I ordered room service and the food was fresh and arrived quickly. There was a very active lobby and bar area at all times. They offer warm cookies nightly at the front desk, and free wi-fi in the lobby although you had to pay to have wi-fi in your room. That was expensive. I think it was $14.95 per day. My bed was extremely comfortable. The carpet and wallpaper were a little tired on my floor, and could use to be freshened up, but other than that I had a wonderful stay. For those of you who care, great shower and decent hairdryer. I think pets to a certain size were allowed.

<Title>“Nice staff, nice room, large shower, warm cookies!”
<Content>We showed up very early as our flight landed early and the Doubletree had our room ready. It was an ADA room and the shower was nice and large and easy to roll into. The toilet is a little short for an ADA bathroom and the paper ends up right at your leg. The furniture at the front door was at first hard to get past but the maid, bellhop and maintenance man quickly slid things over for us. The phone next to the bed didn't work but the other two phones in the room did so that was fine. The breakfast downstairs was a little odd for someone in a wheelchair to get to, (in a tiny one person lift), but doable. Not overly impressed by selection but in NY you have so many options, this is a minor inconvenience. Bed was very comfortable. Cookies were delicious! How much more can you want other than warm cookies?!

The lobby was refurnished and it looks better than before. But the rooms... oh my God! Dark, humid, smelly and wallpaper torned... Message to the hotel: please shape up! In the meantime consider charging no more than usd 100 for those ugly rooms!

<Title>“TERRIBLE service!!! Unclean!”
<Content>This was supposed to be a fun girlfriends get-away weekend. We made reservations on line, and called prior to our stay to see if we could get an early check-in as we were going to be arriving around 10am. I was told that they would try to accommodate this, but there was no guarantee. (I later found out at check-in that there is a guarantee: you can pay for the night before and not stay there. Seriously?) When we were actually checking-in, we again requested the early check-in, and were told they would do their best and call us when the room became available, but regular check-in time was 3pm. We left our bags (at $2/bag) at the bag drop-off and headed out for some retail therapy. We got the call at 3:15 that our room was ready and we could NOW check-in. We were still shopping miles away, and didn't actually get back to the hotel until 7pm. Upon arrival in our room, upon initial glance, it appeared clean, but then we noticed an empty bottle of water and opened earplugs on the nightstand. There was also a hand-written note on the desk. This just made us question whether the room was actually cleaned and whether or not they changed the sheets, for example, or did they think the same people who were there prior to us were coming back. We called the front desk and they apologized and told us they would change our rooms and someone would be up with a key. Twenty minutes later, they dropped off the key and we hauled our luggage do a different floor only to open the room and see AN UNMADE BED AND DIRTY TOWELS ON THE FLOOR IN THE BATHROOM!!! We called down to the front desk AGAIN and were told again that they were sorry and they would change our rooms again. The manager brought us our key and told us she had "upgraded" us for our trouble and had personally checked the room prior to bringing us the key. We finally got to our room at 7:45 trying to make an 8:30 dinner reservation. The room was clean, but we noticed no upgrade (unless the 19th floor is considered an upgrade). The next night, we made reservations to go to The Top of The Rock from our room from an iPad, and were prompted to print our tickets. Again, the staff was incredibly unhelpful and told me to go to the computer center and I could print them. The iPad couldn't connect to their printer, so I went to the front desk, where they told me there were instructions in my room on how to print from my own device. When I asked if they had a copy of said instructions so I didn't have to go back up to my room and then back down to the front to retrieve my printed documents, they seemed very put-out (this was 11pm and there was NOBODY in the lobby). They finally produced the piece of paper and I spent a few minutes trying to get their instructions to work. When I had questions, they pretended they didn't hear me or said they didn't know how it worked. In the end, I figured out (on my own) that I could email myself the link to the tickets and open my email on one of their computers in the computer center and print them out. Overall, I had a great trip with my friend and the hotel experience didn't ruin our fun, but I will NEVER stay here again!!!

<Title>“BED BUGS!! stay away”
<Content>DO NOT stay at this hotel. I was there this past weekend Oct 14-17th, and stayed in room 343. Woke up the next day with what I thought were mosquito bites, huge itchy red bumps along my leg. The next day there were more bites. I did a search and sure enough, looks like bed bug bites. I phoned management upon my return the very next day to report the complaint and was promptly transferred/hung up several times. They are "investigating" but offered nothing than "we are looking into it."

<Title>“friendly staff and great location”
<Content>I usually stay at the Doubletree when I go to NY on business. It has a great location (lex and 51st), right next to the subway and walking distance from many restaurants and shops. The rooms are fairly small but ok for NY's standards. The bathroom is quite small too but was very clean. the toiletries were very nice too. the room has cable internet (and you can get free WiFi in the lobby too). Decent size desk and big flat screen TV (my only recommendation there would be to also add non US channels... having BBC would be nice to have access to real international news). Staff is super friendly and very efficient (checking in and out took no more than a couple of minutes each). It has a bar downstairs where you can also get some snacks but since it is so close to many nice restaurants I only went there once (and the food was nice). Overall, it is not a five star hotel but its is quite good for NY and I would recommend staying at the Doubletree.

<Title>“Could do better”
<Content>If you are looking for a middletown New York location and your priority is not a good bathroom or service - then this is a good hotel for you - just over a mere 100 yard from the Wardorf Astoria. The Doubletree is also 10 yards from the subway. For $29 I got a one week unlimited pass (includes bus). Someone from the hotel took our luggage from the cab ($5 tip) to the hotel foyer (we thought he would take it all the way to our room, how naive of us. We were then welcomed by a member of staff speaking very fast (the only one to do so). She made a sneaky comment when we asked her if she could slow down a bit for us. The room was not ready until 3 pm (current hotel policy). Our luggage was put in storage by another member of staff expected a tip ($3 tip). Wen went out for a coffee. After 3 pm, we returned. We were told that our luggage would be delivered to our room. We waited, not able to change clothes or refresh. It took three requests and by this time we had wasted hours. Although our two small suitcases were it seems lost, then found and delivered at last to us, we were stll expected to tip (another $3 tip). So, it was $11 to get our 2 small suitcases from the taxi to our room! Regretably, after these first encounters, our experience continued to be bad. The aircondition was not working properly and the room was at times too cold. Our son and his girlfriend arrived two days after us. They had a room with a toilet with non-stop gashing water, clearly audible from the room. They asked to be moved on this count and also because they did not want a room on the "smoking floor" (horrible cigarette stench) but the staff was extremly unhelpful and nothing was done until their last night in the hotel.

<Title>“Outstanding Experience! Safe, Clean, Convenient.”
<Content>I just returned from a two night stay at the Doubletree 10/13-10/15. I was a female traveling alone and am very pleased to report the following. HIGHLIGHTS: *10:30 am arrival. Room wasn't ready but recieved a requested upgrade and phone call when room was ready. *Room was big with king sized bed, lounging area and big tv. *Hotel provided earplugs. I slept soundly on comfy bed with no noise problems. *Evening turn down service with chocolates. HOTEL OBSERVATIONS: *Super great location with subway literally just outside the door. *Concierge service was very attentive and helpful. *Elevators are fast. *Evening security was excellent. Side access doors locked, bellmen at front & guard at the elevators. *Business section for free computer use and printer. *Barbershop, nail salon, restaurant, gift shop on site. TIPS: *The subway is being serviced...for the next 10 years as I understand it. Weekend service is somewhat limited. *If you like Letterman you can go to his website a week or so before you arrive and probably get free tickets. *WTC memorial requires a reservation. LONG LONG lines if you don't have one. Make sure you check out the good ole' tree that survived that day. *My room rate was $219 per night plus tax which for the dates was a GREAT price. One week before it was $385 per night. I lucked in to the rate by checking 24 hours before check in and they must have released some rooms. I found many hotels had done the same thing. *Broadway show "Pricilla Queen of the Desert" was worth seeing for the costumes alone. Not everyones cup of tea but the costumes! :-)

<Content>I stayed at this hotel 10/9-10/10 with my 4 daughter's for a girls trip to the city!! Great location, very friendly staff. We loved the location as we planned our trip around visiting the American Girl Doll Store. Room was average for a NYC room, pillows were comfy, but bed was hard as a rock!! Also, tip....if you want to avoid valet parking at $48.00 for 24 hrs. and you travel there saturday or sunday, street parking is available....we parked two blocks away for free on the weekend...if you have any questions about parking you can call 311 and an automated system will tell you the parking restrictions. Also, there is a police station directly next to the hotel, I think it's on Lexington and 52nd. We stopped in there and they were very helpful as to the parking restrictions. I really liked parking on the street, we didn't have to alway lug the stroller back to the room, and we kept our cooler full of drinks and snacks and just refilled as needed.

<Content>we were there from oct.9th to 11th., 2011. We were on the 11th floor. The room was all right, comfortable bed. The walls seem to be made of cardboard as we could not sleep until our neighbours stopped talking and were awakened as soon as they started talking again!! The bathtub was DISGUSTING, with BLACK stains from bottom to top! I had to ask for them to put some kind of rubber carpet in the tub as I put a towel the first night cause I could not bring myself to put even my big toe in that tub. (I wish I had taken a picture) There was no mini fridge in the room....I did not see a pool anywhere in the hotel, either... I would not go back.

<Content>Its tough to be a big hotel in NYC - people from all over, different languages, different needs. Doubletree Metropolitan staff worked so hard to make our stay a great one (Oct 7-10). They have a customercare phone line that takes care of your every need. We had a few issues with our room, but not only were they resolved, the Manager (Matthew) totally took care of us and made me and my 2 sons feel like we were the only guests there. They took care of last minute requests and did so in a professional and helpful way. Kudos to the whole staff (and I mean housekeeping, concierges, desk staff and manager Matthew)! Would definitely recommend!

<Content>I stayed 4 nights this week. Nice room with comfortable bed. Because I'm an honor member, I was upgraded to executive suite level and was provided with free continental breakfast and snacks in the evening. One complaint - the second night, I received a phone call to verify I was checking out the next morning. When they realized I was staying 4 nights, they aplogized and assured all was fine. The next day, I was locked out of the room as they accidently "checked me out". This was easily fixed, but a minor hassell.

<Title>“Superb Hotel”
<Content>My husband and I and friends were recent guests at this wonderful hotel, located very conveniently in the heart of Manhattan. The service desk as well as the Concierge, were extremely knowledgeable and efficient. The connecting rooms that we requested were large, well appointed, and a great value for NYC. I would not hesitate to return for another wonderful stay. Please disregard any negative comment that you might read, see, or hear as we highly recommend the Doubletree Metropolitan to anyone visiting NYC

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>I stayed one night in the hotel, this past week. Courteous staff, great room and lots of amenities. Like most NY hotels, the rooms are a bit cramped. However, the room was still very functional. The bathroom was fairly large by NY standards. The amenities that are important to me, while travelling for work are 1) good wi-fi, which this hotel has 2) decent room service; this was good; nothing to write home about but adequate, 3) fitness center: think good cardio equipment, and 4) elevators that support the number of rooms (I hate waiting for elevators when I am trying to get to a meeting. The hotel has 5 and they were all quick. Valet parking is the only option unless you love the thrill of the hunt in NY. Valet parking can be a bit tricky because there isn't a larget area for check-in/check-out and the taxi drivers like to battle for those spots. Fortunately, the doormen are good about keeping the taxis moving so even if you have to wait to pull up to the hotel, it shouldn't be too long.

<Title>“Great Choice”
<Content>Double Tree was a last minute choice. Turned out to be a good one. Great rate, perfect location w/ subway across the street, very kind staff, and most importantly a clean and comfy room. Restrooms could use some updating but it's not a big enough deal to overlook this property. Previous reviews about smell caused some concern. I have an extremely sensitive sense of smell and was NOT interested in anything musty or moldy. However, I didn't recognize either. Early check-in is almost always difficult in the city. This property is happy to store your bags for $1/each and will give you a call if your room happens to come available earlier than 3pm. Received a call around 11am. Perfect timing after having breakfast at a nearby cafe. No additional charges for early check in. If you're driving into the city, find your own parking, don't rely on valet (which is all the hotel offers). They can't be held responsible for damages to your car. I had a rental and valet wrapped it around a curb that cracked half of the hubcap off. Hotels generally contract valet and parking attendants from nearby parking garages. They're careless, so just do it yourself. I normally do but with a parade going on, parking was extremely limited. Other than the valet situation, it was an overall pleasant stay. Really surprised by the rate considering the hotel's location in the city and the quality. Thus, I'm returning in Dec :) Note: on the day of check-out there was a larger than life-size balloon of a bed bug in front of the hotel claiming that this property was infested with bed bugs. I certainly didn't experience that and I always do a thorough check.

<Title>“Nice size rooms and decent value for the neighborhood”
<Content>A somewhat chaotic check-in area (mainly because of its design) and a guy is always there hawking the Hilton Club on the way to the elevator *but* this is actually a very good hotel. The rooms are reasonably sized and the prices are usually fantastic. THis is the hotel Cathay Pacific uses and the location is great. The nearby hotels - the W, the Barclay, etc. -- are all much more expensive and in my view have rooms that are not that much better. Never, ever use the laundry service at the Doubletree -- use a dry cleaner in the neighborhood - the laundry service is absolutely appalling. And the gym at 24 hour fitness around the corner is a lot better than the hotel gym (which is pretty bad). Not a perfect place to stay but at its price point it is really good value.

<Content>Second time to NYC and booked here for location. Beside everything we wanted to do, so location location location is what we wanted, and we got it. Room was small as are all in NYC, but the cookie was a nice touch at check in. Hotel is clean and staff are nice. We used them to book tickets for a show (phantom) and all was organised including a car to the show. Bar wasn't great to many suits & laptops at 12am for my liking, lads at 12/1 am in the morning you are impressing no one. Sub station 2 minutes walk.

<Title>“Very comfortable, quiet, good quality hotel in Manhattan!”
<Content>I don't normally stay in midtown east as it is usually too expensive for me, but I got a great priceline bid my own price, and got this hotel. It is on Lexington Ave kitty corner from the Waldorf Astoria, and a block east of St Patricks Cathedral. A lovely area of town, and close enough to walk to Central Park (6-7 blocks northwest, (Grand Central Station - 2-3 blocks south), and Times Square (5 blocks west - it goes Lexington, Madison, Park, 5th, 6th, 7th & Times Square). Great location. There is a subway staion outside the hotel as well in case you need it. This hotel is an easy 20 minute yellow cab taxi ($28 + tip) from LGA airport, and all around, very convenient. A negative would be that at 1pm, our room was not ready for check in, and although we only travelled with a carry on each, we had to pay to check the bags for an hour while we went to eat something while they were finishing the rooms. We also had to pay when we picked them up. The concierge said $1.00 each bag at drop off and $1.00 per bag at pick up. When I went to do this, the man taking the bags wanted double until i called him on it...I told him what concierge told me the price was and then he said "I guess I'll split the difference then.". I reported the price discrepency to the same concierege, and he didn't seem suprised or to care. Little dod these people know that I have spent a lot of time in new York, and I am not a chump. I have to wonder if he would have done the same to a man??? Anyway, other than that, ther is no free wifi in the rooms (it is $14.95 per 24 hour period), and the lobby was to smoky smelling for me to use the free wifi there. A little plus, the room we had (645) was on the non-street side of the hotel, and although not a great view, it compensated in how nice and quiet it was. It was a non-smoking double, and had plenty of room. No fridge in the rooms, but the beds were comfortable, the tv was good, and there was a safety deposit box. The beds were comfortable as well. the bathrooms were on the small side, but had full tub and good water pressure shower. Lots of towels and soaps and a hair dryer that worked fine. All in all, a great stay. The warm chocolate chip cookies upon check in (and any time my young daughter asked nicely) were delicious as others have mentioned!! Would recommend this hotel to adults and families alike.

<Title>“Horible hotel not worth the price”
<Content>So i got this hotel through an opaque provider, at about 40% off. The hotel is in a nice location, close to Grand Central, Rockefeller, Times square, and transit. The lobby is nice. It's close to transit. Now for what is bad... They claimed they had no non-smoking kings, even though they were still selling them on their website, as they were not sold out! They offered us a smoking king, or a room with 2 doubles. We chose the doubles. But this is not why I am upset at this hotel. While they put some money into the upkeep of the common areas, lobby/hallways, the room is atrocious! The headboards were disgusting, the carpet stained and dirty looking. The tub was deplorable. There were stains on both the outside and inside, and I wonder if it has had a good clean in a long time. The wallpaper was peeling from the walls. The water in the sink comes out with such force, and is difficult to regulate, so you end up splashing yourself, as well as the entire bathroom. The room "felt"dirty. It was just not up to Doubletree, or even Comfort Inn standards! They claim to be doing a renovation in 2012. Until that time, I would advise staying FAR away from this hotel!

<Content>My daughter and I stayed here for four days and were pleasantly surprised by what a great hotel this turned out to be. The rooms were much larger than other hotels in Manhatten that we have stayed in. The room was spotless and we slept well in the comfortable beds. The location was perfect for us. The hotel is in a safe neighborhood and within a short distance to Times Square, Rockelfellar Center and subways. The only criticism was that the conciege was not helpful. It seemed we knew more about New York then she did.

<Title>“Good location, but hotel needs upkeep”
<Content>Like other reviews mentioned, this hotel is in need of upkeep/renovation. It's in a great location, right next to a subway stop, and we had a good experience with the staff we encountered. However the wallpaper was peeling in our room, the tub didn't drain well, we waited a long time for an elevator, etc. But, given the amount of time we spent in the room, it served our needs. I was glad we got a good deal on it given the room's condition.

<Title>“Hotel was nice but expected more for the price.”
<Content>The lobby, hallways and bar area are very nice. Modern, clean and one thing you notice is the very strong and pleasant smell to the place. It all ends there. Once you step into the hotel room it's like you've been transported back into the 1950s and the smell is awful! Muggy, moldy and stale. The rooms are ugly, outdated and lack any charm. I called to the front desk to ask about moving and they basically told me nothing was available but they could send a janitor to spray the room. He came up and gave the room two little mists and it did nothing. I spent $20 in febreeze to try and remedy the room's offensive odor. Little worked, but thankfully I wasn't in the room much. The location is wonderful but for the price with no fridge, water, coffee maker and the overwhelming odor, I wouldn't stay there again. It's pretty ridiculous. Maybe rip out the soggy, offensively molded wall paper and I'd give it another go.

Slightly disappointed with the standard of the rooms but they were clean and the maid service was good. Staff were very helpful and friendly especially Rafael the bell boy and Juan Carlos who served me every morning at breakfast.

<Title>“A very comfortable stay in NYC”
<Content>This was the first time staying in a Doubletree -- and I'll tell you, they really know how to set the positive mood right away. #1 We drove up to the hotel and someone was there ready to pick up luggage and park our car for us. Normally, I prefer to do everything myself, but I haven't been to NYC since I was 10, and everything was a bit chaotic, so we appreciated someone handling the car for us right away. THEN - we check in and they hand us WARM chocolate chip cookies. Wow, talk about the key to our hearts! It doesn't disguise that the prices in NYC are ridiculous, but if you're looking for a clean stay (I'd heard horror stories about bed bugs, etc.), then this is a great place, but it's a great location for getting around. Opt-out of breakfast in the morning as it's super expensive and you can grab Starbucks just on the corner. Parking was also quite expensive - $48 a night - but it was a relief to know the car was locked up in their parking garage and we didn't have to worry about it. Overall, a nice hotel --- though, beware of the bell hops, they're super competitive with each other and they tend to put customers in awkward situations (i.e. who grabbed your luggage first?). p.s. Writing this review as I was happy with our stay but some of the reviews before we left freaked me out a bit. It's true the rooms are small - but you're in NYC for pete's sakes!

<Title>“Decent stay, but the 4-star rating is misleading”
<Content>Scored this property on a very attractive last-minute Priceline bid. My stay was fine, but I can see why others take issue with positive reviews. First, the 4-star rating is inaccurate; it's more like a 3- or maybe a 3.5-star. The lobby is nice and seems to be a gathering place, but that's because it's the only free WiFi hotspot in the hotel and no one feels like shelling out the extra $16 to have WiFi in their room. The rooms themselves are dated and look tired, and, although I have no reason to think they're exceptionally dirty, you just don't feel like walking around barefoot. But that's the worst of it. The beds are clean and bug-free, TVs are nice, and showers get REALLY hot. The staff is friendly although busy, and the location is within walking distance to everything most tourists will be interested in and is subway accessible. This place is probably a good deal if the price is right; if you're looking at a rack rate, you might want to look elsewhere.

<Title>“Disregard bad reviews”
<Content>We stayed on Monday 9/5/11. Disregard all the bad reviews. We did have to wait a bit for our room but it was ready right at 3pm like they said. Yes, they should open the bar area earlier like 12:00pm (nnon) would be good. The room was great, bathroom was small but nice. Bed and pillows were great and we slept very well. Had a room on the back side on the 15th floor, smoking room and it did not smell like smoke at all. There was laundry in the hall but it is to be expected. The cleaning crew had it all gone by 5:00pm. They only have one house keeper per floor, 19 floors, so they did a good job considering. Not sure if I would call this a 4 star hotel closer to a 3 or 3.5. Great location and a great deal for the money. If you want a 4 or 5 star spend the $500.00 plus and stop bad mouthing a good place! We would stay again for sure.

<Title>“Very Convenient Hotel”
<Content>I go to NYC 3 times a year just for fun, and always stay at different hotels. I usually stay in hotels anywhere from 20th Street to 30th Street locations at boutique hotels, but this time I opted for this 51st Street location. I've never stayed at a Hilton property before, and I was pleasantly surprised at the excellent service this hotel had. I arrived at 10:00 a.m., but was not able to check in, so I took my luggage to the ladies' room, and changed clothes as I was going to a show at 2:00 pm. I asked if I could check in, just to give me a call, but was not expecting to receive a call until 3:00 pm. At 11:30 am, I received a call that my room was ready. So I ran back to the hotel, got to the room, unpacked, and changed clothes again. I walked over to the St. James Theatre at 44th Street and saw Hair. Came back, and the hotel was really busy. There is a very convenient little coffee shop next door, and I went there the next morning and picked up a coffee and a chocolate crossaint. The subway is right beside the hotel, and I took the #6 train down to NOLITA and went shopping. I also took the subway down to 42nd Street, and changed to another line and went over to the west side to Chelsea Market. The location of the Doubletree is excellent, as you can either take the subway, or you can walk to most of the sites. I checked out 2 days later, and they held my luggage, so I walked over to MOMA for the afternoon. The hotel has a lot of services, and the service people are very well trained. I asked for an ice bucket and received it within 1 minute. My shower could not turn on, and the engineer came within 2 minutes, and fixed it. They have a large HD television, and it has HBO. The cleaning ladies are quick and efficient. They start cleaning up the rooms around 9:00 am. I asked for some more towels and they gave them to me. This room was larger than what I have had in the boutique hotels. They have a business center so you can print your boarding pass. They have a nice bar, and a very large lobby where most people were on their laptops. I really liked this hotel, I felt safe here, I liked the coffee shop next door, and I liked that the subway was right at the door. There's a great place to buy wine, its called Graybar, and its south on Lexington about 5 blocks down. When I picked up my luggage, the bellman offered me a limo ride to LGA for only $35. What a steal. Its costs $75-$90 in Chicago to take a limo to O'Hare airport. I would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Satisfactory; cookies but no coffee”
<Content>Won this room on Priceline and was concerned about comfort/cleanliness after reading the reviews. Relieved to find that my room was clean enough, not musty or smelly (bath exhaust fan ran quietly but continuously), also not noisy despite overlooking the fire engines on 51st Street (high floor might have helped with this). Main area of queen-bed room was spacious by NY standards and well-furnished. Very handy to #6 subway line, so it's convenient to many uptown and downtown destinations as well as Midtown East; crosstown bus on 50th too. Metro Cafe next door has extensive food options including takeout hot breakfast and is open 6AM-midnight. Staff pleasant but very busy. Would not rebook by choice since it lacked two amenities that are important to me: in-room free Wifi and coffee maker.

The hotel bar is really nice, always packed and serves up a good drink here and there. Right across the street kitty corner is a starbucks for the diehards. The rooms are decent sized for a New York hotel (some can be quite small) and comfortable and clean. Convenient gift shop for snacks or quick souveniers. Shopping is within walking distance in just about any direction.

<Content>The only saving grace of this hotel is it's location.It is in the heart of Manhattan. Whatever direction you will go,it will only take you at least 15 minutes tops walking. The subway is just outside of the hotel.Perfect Location BUT aside from this, nothing is endearing with this hotel. The staff are rude,abrupt!! I believe it's bec.. they are always busy! the front desk is always with so much people and the staff are not approachable and unfriendly as well.the rooms are "dirty" .The carpets very old and tattered and looks "dirty" . The walls of the rooms are quite thin and you can hear your neighbor.Also, bec. of the location, everyday,you hear sirens and so much noise from the outside of the hotel.The housekeepers are all very loud when they clean the rooms, "banging"and talking loudly to each other while doing their tasks.Metro Cafe is just beside the hotel, good food but again, the cashiers when their "busy",well, let's say,even when the Hurricane was in town and this is the only restaurant available,i will decline! Very poor in SERVICE orientation.

<Content>Doubletree should be ashamed. Not only was this hotel not up to its standards (the room was horrible and smelled). The service was deplorable. I called ahead of time to ask some questions, when I arrived I learned I had been lied to and none of the information (this was regarding parking) I had been given from an onsite employee was correct. Parking turned into a fiasco. The staff was rude upon arrival and unwilling to help in anyway. Please don't stay at this hotel and save yourself some serious heartburn.

<Content>The bad reviews nearly sent us elsewhere so I just want to report: the staff was absolutely charming and helpful, from the front desk to the concierge to the guy who carried up our suitcases with a smile-- and this was right before Hurricaine Irene. When we left early the hotel accomodated our needs and helped us check out quickly. We had a lovely allergy-free room (which smelled a little perfumy but we had a great night's sleep), the location is AMAZING and the lobby is nice. Yes the hallways need some updating. Yes room service and breakfast is a huge rip off-- there's a sweet little cafe right next door for one tenth the price. Yes they should offer free wireless in the rooms. But my husband says it's the best and cleanest workout space he has ever seen. We have nothing but good to say about the whole experience and we will definitely be back! Great cookies, too!

<Title>“utilitarian and clean with a good east midtown location”
<Content>Although a bit on the Eastern side of Manhattan, this hotel has a good location with close walking proximity to many midtown businesses and tourist sites. Overall the hotel is nice and clean, although a bit utilitarian - especially for the price paid. The rooms are good, but basic. The furniture works, but is small (as are the rooms). The bathroom is nice, but (again) very basic. As far as the hotel amenities are concerned, as with other hotels in the Hilton chain, if you are Honors Gold or Platinum, you get free wifi access. There is a small gym with 24 hour entry for hotel guests. This hotel makes for a decent night stay, although not New York elegant or trendy by any stretch.

<Title>“I love it”
<Content>The service is wonderful! I have stayed there several times and have never been disappointed. The rooms are very clean and the bed is very comfortable. I cannot say enoughtgood things about the staff. Terri makes you feel like they are happy you are there. She is very accomodating and a great asset to the hotel. Although it is not a small hotel, they are very personable. I will stay there again!!!!!!!!!! Hated to leave. You can't go wrong. Close to subway, shopping, restaurants, everything.

<Title>“Not What You Would Expect for a Large Hotel”
<Content>We stayed here for one week and was not impressed to say the least. First of all to pay the bellman to store your luggage while you wait for your room to be ready was RIDICULOUS. But having to pay the bellman again to retrieve your luggage was even more RIDICULOUS... Don't the bellman receive an hourly wage? Looked like they were thriving on the luggage storage/retrieval tips. Even saw a bellman in the corner counting how much he made. UTTERLY RIDICULOUS! In such a large hotel to be renovating the business center when it seemed the occupancy was high was also crazy. How can you move your business center to one of your meeting rooms and only have one desktop available? Not what you would expect for such a large hotel. Not everyone has a laptop!!!! The rooms were also not in the best conditions either. The bathrooms needed some work. The rooms needed renovating. The fitness center smelled MOLDY!!!! The best thing about the room was the flat screen tv. Also the fact that a restaurant was beside it and the subway was within walking distance. Would not recommend this hotel and would not return.

<Content>If you don't care about the smelly, musty rooms, then you won't have any issues with this hotel. The staff is very nice and pleasant. It's a great location for business travelers and tourists. However, bring a bottle of Febreeze with you because you will need it. I also read the reviews that some travelers experienced issues with bed bugs. I am very happy to report that I didn't experience bed bugs.

<Title>“Great Hotel in a good location”
<Content>This hotel is set in a great place for touring NY.It is 3 blocks straight ahead of the hotel to get to Times Square.You pass the Met on the way there and it is very near to the hop on hop off bus collection point.The Hotel is very clean and comfortable and is just like hotels at home which was great.As we were told going to America-the hotel rooms are quite small-but this was not.We booked a package without breakfast because we dont really eat much at that time in the morning.But one morning we desided to go and try the breakfast-we just wanted 2 sausages and toast-no matter what you had they charged us the same price as a full breakfast and for the two of us it cost $60.It was a disgrace hence the fact we did not eat there again we then tried the metro next door a small restraunt which we got what we wanted and it was cheaper the staff in there are not very nice but at least you get what you pay for.The conseirge down stairs in the hotel was very nice and helpful.We wanted to make the most of our trip so we got up each morning at 6am and by the 4th day we had everything covered-all the sites in the city.We wish we had travelled onto Boston and looked at somewhere different as we found ourselves getting bored.All in all this is a good hotel and if we did go back there in the future we would stay here as you are gaurenteed comfort and a clean place to stay! Also just to tell other people the taxi costs $46 into the city and $52 back to JFK that is a yellow taxi-the hotel will try and pawn you with a catalack-this will cost you a lot more.

<Title>“Great place with great staff”
<Content>We went into NYC to show some overseas friends a first look at the city. Convenience was most important since we only had one night and half each of two days. This location was top notch. We checked in a little early and they only had one of our three rooms available, but they identified the other two and "held" them so that they could not be reassigned so that we were all only a few doors apart. The hotel is well located just a few blocks north of Grand Central and a few east of Rockefeller Center. The staff could not have been more delightful. I am a gold member of Hilton Honors so we received continental breakfast - but she gave it to me for my friends as well. That certainly was "above".... Also, each time we went into the lobby we were greeted and asked how they could help. We didn't have a meal, other than the breakfast, but we had cocktails in the lobby bar which was very nice as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone for a nice hotel in a great location.

<Title>“Mixed feelings”
<Content>My family and I visit relatives in New York once every summer and have stayed at this hotel each time for the past 7 years. We just got back today from this year's trip and I felt the need to write this review. In the past we have never looked anywhere else. We found this hotel and were hooked from the get go. It was clean, staff was friendly, price was good and the location was great. Also, a wonderful, deliciously warm cookie upon check in was a great touch. There is also a great cafe next door. As a result, we have continued to return. Unfortunately, this time was a little different. We checked in and were NOT offered a cookie. After checking into our room, the first thing I noticed was that it appeared as though our room had not been vacuumed. Also, the vent cover on the air conditioner unit had fallen off and was on the floor. The shower head was old and impossible to adjust (it wanted to spray the wall). My feeling overall was that is just isn't as nice as it used to be. Where as the lobby/bar area still looks great, I feel as though the rooms are looking a bit "run down". I am not quite sure they are as well maintained as they once had been. As a result, I will probably be looking elsewhere next year.

<Content>This was our first trip to NY and we were not sure what to expect, but the hotel is a fantastic location and the staff could not have been more helpful! I am a Hilton Honors member so I made my reservations online w/Hilton but had to contact the hotel as we were travelling with our 16 year old daughter and her friend to make sure that we would have connecting rooms and they were very helpful. Rooms were small -- but thats New York! Very clean rooms and property -- our window looked out over the police station and we thought it would be noisy, but they had great soundproofing! Would definitely stay here again -- and recommend to others.

<Content>The Doubletree is conveniently located on the corner of 51st St. and Lexington Ave. Which means it is within walking distance to both Central Park, and Times Square. And you can get on the Subway right outside the hotel to visit Little Italy, Chinatown, the World Trade Center... The service was great. Franklin at the front desk helped our trip go from good to great, and we loved seeing Bolivar every morning in The Met for breakfast. Everyone we saw was very helpful and courteous.

The rooms are small, but that's to be expected in a city like NYC. I thought the rooms were fairly quiet considering it's on a major street.

<Content>Don't let the picture of the room on the website fool you. It looks nothing like that bright, clean room. Our room smelled so bad!!!! Our family had two rooms and they both smelled like a musty basement. Our clothing smelled so bad when we returned home. The room never really cooled off. The bathroom vanity was rusty and water damaged. I wish I would have taken a picture to post. There were hairs all over the bathroom. The carpet was filthy! Room service trays and empty glasses sat in the hallway for over a day before being picked up. The building on the outside is the ugliest building in NYC. The lobby smelled so strongly like a deodorizer/perfume, it made me nauseated. In the evening, when it was time for our family to return to the hotel, we became depressed!! Nothing 4 star about this hotel!!!!

<Content>My wife and I appreciated the friendly greeting and warm cookies as went to check in. The reception area has a warm decor and flows nicely into the bar. The room was pretty big for NYC though we didn't get the king size bed the reserved. Room service food was good, though they did screw up the drink order. Bathroom was not cleaned up to expectations as there were stray hairs in the bathtub that we had to clean away before bathing our baby. All in all a pretty OK hotel experience. Good for families thanks to the rooms size.

I approached the front desk after check to ask for a colleagues room number, and all he said was to ask me to call the operator using the house phone. He kept pushing the responsibility to the operator even tho i was able to provide the correct details such as guest name and arrival date.

<Title>“It's okay”
<Content>Double Tree, as I understand it, are meant to be Hilton-standard hotels, but in buildings that are not purpose-built. This Double Tree needs, and is getting, a revamp (by Gensler, of Apple store design fame) and I would say it's about time. Although the hotel is not shabby, it has been left behind by new Garden Inns and alike that are probably a few dollars less to stay in. The rooms, naturally, are a bit pokey; my loo got blocked and I had to call three times (at the weekend mind); they didn't notice my HH Gold status at check-in; they also charge bag check if you check out but want to leave your bags (although apparently not on the way in). Erm, that's it I think. Location-wise it's fine (opposite the Waldorf actually) and you can easily walk three or four blocks to the upmarket shops, of across to the theatres. By the way, there was a bed-bug workers union sort of protest outside the hotel, but I had no problem whatsoever in this respect of bugs...the hotel was clean.

<Title>“Read the Terrible Comments... they are TRUE!”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Hilton Doubletree (two weeks ago) and all of the terrible reviews are completely true. I was set to stay at the hotel for two nights while on business. The front-desk staff was fine. There were hotel staff that met me in the lobby that made sure I got to the front-desk and checked-in. After I got my room key, I did get a nice warm chocolate chip cookie. The check-in process was fine. The hotel is dated and worn. The elevator floors were dirty, the carpet on each floor is dark (seems new) and the wallpaper is old. Upon entering the room... WOW, what a smell. Smelled like an old basement.. Extremely musty!!! The room was damp.. The sheets on the bed were damp, to the point that it felt almost wet. Although the days I visited NY was the hotest and humid in July... There is no reason why the room was so damp. I turned on the AC figuring the room just needed to get cool to act as a dehumidifier. I left and had dinner and walked around New York for 3 hours. When I returned.. the room was still very smelly with the must and the room was just as damp as when I left but now it was also cold. My view overlooked an adjacent apartment building. Not the best view so I just shut the shades. I called and complained about the room but they front desk said they were all booked. No rooms to be had. When I told her the room had a very bad odor. She quickly said, we can send someone up to spray. I told her no as the problem was the bathroom and it would take more than spray to fix this. I turned on the TV and the sound did not work. I turned the volume all the way up and still no sound. I called for a tech, and literally, 5 minutes before he arrived, the sound kicked in. When the tech arrived, I told him the TV now works and asked if he smelled the bad odor.. He said not really.. He is either very use to the smell or lying. There is no way he could not smell the room. The bathroom was very old and there was a slimy film on the sink. I had to use a towel to clean it. The tub and shower are very old and the ceiling was peeling. Bathroom had so many chips chips and marks, I actually thought they were bugs when I had my glasses off. I then checked Tripadvisor.com to see if other people had complained. An YES, almost everything listed in the Terrible/Bad sections was exactly what I was experiencing. I read about bed bugs and quickly check my room and bed for bugs. I did not see any, no signs of any and thank god, that was clean. I had a bad night sleeping at the smell started to make me sick and the cold damp room made me actually wake up shivering. Before I went to bed, I called the front desk and told them I will not be staying a second night. No way in hell! I checked out at 5:00 AM, went and changed my train tickets and left a day early than planned due to the room. I then sat outside my office building for three hours waiting for the staff to arrive rather than having to spend one more sicking minute in the room . Horrible, horrible and horrible. If you like rooms that are cold, damp and VERY, VERY smelly like and old basement where water has been sitting for years, then this is the hotel for you. The staff was fine although the front-desk person responded to my complaint without missing a breath so that leads me to believe they hear about the musty smell all the time. There was no surprise in her voice. Message to Hilton... Get your act together. Too many hotels in NYC to have to put up with that crap. A formal complaint will be going to Hilton corporate and you just lost a business account. I made sure I passed on my experience with our corporate travel group so other employees do not have to stay in the same accommodations. Report card.. Staff professionalism, courtesy and friendly attitude – A+ Accommodations – F,F,F,F,F I wish there were a grade below an F.. Good luck to future guests..

<Title>“Recommended Fairly Reasonable Accomodations in Midtown Manhattan”
<Content>The Metropolitan is a very old renovated hotel now branded as a Doubletree. It enjoys a great location about a 15 minute walk to Times Square and excellent access to all major subway lines. The relatively small lobby can be quite busy, and non-Hilton Honors members will experience a wait to check-in during peak periods (The free freshly baked chocolate chip cookies may help excuse the wait for some). My handicap accessible room on the 6th floor with a king bed was a little on the small side for hotels in this class for NYC, but still acceptable for up to 2 people. Although somewhat showing its age with some minor wear, the room was well-maintained and clean. The bed was very comfortable, and the room facing 51st St. was quiet, although rooms facing Lexington Ave. are reportedly somewhat louder based on comments from a business associate who also stayed in the same hotel. In the middle of a record heat wave (100F/38C), my room's AC performed exceptionally. The staff was very helpful in every way. In room internet costs $14.95/day but is free in the Lobby and Bar, although internet speeds were painfully slow when many users were logged on in these areas. The 24 Hour Business Center offers 4 computer terminals and a printer all at no charge, but there was often a wait. The gym is a PRECOR equipment branded facility and well equipped. My major complaint (and the only reason it did not receive the highest rating) was the lack of in-room coffee makers which I was advised was a recent development and according to staff members, the subject of many complaints. Room Service promptly delivered a requested pot of hot water for $1.50+gratuity adding insult to this unacceptable lack of what should be a basic amenity in a hotel of this class. Also on the subject of hot water, in the mornings, my showers were hot with good pressure, although in the evenings, the water temperature dropped off somewhat, and while still warm, did not compare to the mornings. Very few hotels in Manhattan with this prime of a location and level of amenities can be considered bargains, but if you can get this one for $225/night or less during peak periods, it is recommended.

Common areas are worn, room was dirty, bathroom was musty, wall paper riped/hanging in room and a rude front desk agent, rugs were not vacuumed, etc. The only positive, the night manager was very professional in reconciling my reservation. As an intensive business traveler, Hilton was always a brand you could trust, no so much anymore, This hotel should be rated 2 stars and I was VERY motivatd to check out, for by the way over $300/night.

The rooms have a lot of dirt, chips, and appears very tattered. The service was sloppy, the food mediocre. This hotel isn't worth more than $199 per night in the busiest of times. For business travelers who want even an average hotel experience, this hotel will disappoint. Never again for me.

<Title>“Got the job done”
<Content>First off, I used priceline to book the room, and for a rate of $105/night + tax, I was quite happy to get a hotel in this part of New York. With that in mind, I don't think I overpaid for the quality I got. Pros: -Great location with probably the best transportation connections you'll get on the east side of New York. The 4,5,6, and E trains are all within close proximity, and therefore, the rest of the city is accessible. -Efficient staff. No, they're not particularly friendly, but they weren't rude either. I lost my key, and they replaced it quickly. -Delicious cookie at check-in. -Comfortable beds, new LCD TV, Crabree & Evelyn toiletries, and decent-sized rooms (meaning huge for NYC) Cons: -Paying $10/day for Internet? Um, no. -Tiny bathrooms. I don't need a gigantic bathroom, but I couldn't open the door all the way without hitting the toilet. -I'm pretty sure that I specified a non-smoking room, but I ended up in a smoking one. Ultimately, it didn't matter because there wasn't a smoky smell, but I didn't like how I was told that they'd have to wait to see if a non-smoking room became available. Being tired upon my arrival, I just took the smoking room. Wrap-up: I guess that the staff can rub some people the wrong way, but I didn't find their attitudes an issue. The rooms are a little bit dated, but as long as the decor isn't hideous, I don't really care. At the end of the day, I'd gladly stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan again, but only if I get the same kind of rate that I got on Priceline. Anything more than that would be a rip-off.

<Title>“Don't Waste Your Money!!!”
<Content>My sister and I recently traveled to NYC and stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel. With the exception of a very friendly, polite, and professional staff, this hotel was the worst!!! We thought we would stay here and couldn't go wrong because of the location and the other luxury hotels that are on the same block (the "W" and The Marriott). Boy were we wrong. For starters our room was not ready when we checked in that evening (around 7:45pm). When we finally checked into our room, the room was very small, old and dated. The door still had a chain on it for security. Our air conditioner was not working properly, which meant it was hot and we baked in our room the first night. When we alerted the hotel's front desk they sent an engineer to our room to change the filter in the air conditioning unit. The filter looked as it hadn't been changed in a couple of years. And to add insult to injury they charged $48.00 for parking. Not $48.00 a night (which I had no problem with because it's NYC) but, $48.00 dollars every time you wanted to take your vehicle out of the garage in less than a 24 hour period. Amazing!!! This has got to be the worst hotel that we have stayed in in NYC. There is no possible way they can compete with the other hotels on that block. You would assume that because of the location and the Hilton name behind it, it would be really nice. NOT!!!!! The only reason I gave this rating two stars is because of the staff who were professional. If I could take this staff out of this hotel and put them in a "real luxury" hotel that would be great. If Mr. Hilton would take time and invest money into his hotels instead of letting his daughter spend his money on all the non sense that she does, he would make be on point!!! Don't waste your money or time!!!!

<Content>It is not the Ritz, but I didn't expect it to be and I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was given some of the real negative comments on this site. Everyone was pleasant and ready to please. The room was small, but clean with comfortable beds and sheets. The only complaint is that they didn't give us enough washclothes and towels and we had to ask from more twice. There were 4 of us in the room - 2 mother daughter teams. It was hard to find 2 double or queen beds at a decent price. The location was great too. A happy customer.

<Title>“Not a lot of bang for your buck”
<Content>Could not check in early, not even an hour early!! ended up getting checked in after the posted check in time. Bar was not open, so just had to mill about in the lobby while waiting. front desk staff was very helpful. Room was kinda crappy, peeling paint and paper in the bathroom. Location was a bit of a walk from Times Sq, but very good otherwise. Also, fire station is on side street and can be heard if you happen to be on that side of the hotel. Exercise room was a nice bonus,

<Title>“Great location, great potential”
<Content>Stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan for a few nights in June. It is in a great location in Mid Town, easy to walk to most places, if not there were 2 subway stations very close by and more line choices only a couple of blocks further. Hotel has amazing potential - rooms are a good size just very tired. They had artists impressions of the new rooms on the wall in the lobby and it looks like it will be fabulous when they have been done. I can cope with the tired rooms if the service matches, and sometimes it did but other times, it was very bad. One member of staff in the bar was fabulous but then the other member of the team on with him was downright rude to customers (not to me personally, but to the people sitting beside me) Slightly off putting checking in with the giant blow up rat outside but having read the information under the rat - it's not even to do with this hotel but another hotel owned by the same company who didn't use union members for something! Did feel sorry for the hotel as this is should not be the first impression for their guests and is not their fault. Would probably stay again once the rooms have been done as location was great and majority of staff were very helpful just an unfortunate few who made a very bad impression.

<Title>“Simply horrible!”
<Content>Our stay started with the desk clerk being very rude, then we were assigned what we think must have been the worst room on the property. As we walked in, the room smelled musty, the bathroom door had dirt streaks and hair stuck to it, the thermostat could not be adjusted, the rug was worn and the only way you could get to the opposite side of the bed was single file pushing the desk chair all the way in. It was one of the tiniest rooms we’ve ever been issued at the Hilton properties worldwide. We would not reccomend this property to any one. The only good part was the free cookies!

<Title>“Would Stay Again”
<Content>The hotel met all expectations for a hotel of it's class in New York city. For us, the location was great. It was a train ride away from popular attractions (empire state, statue of liberty) but we saved a bundle. The building engineer was extremely nice and helpful as he explained several things about the city and the hotel, sparked from an informal conversation outside the hotel. Would have been nice to have free WIFI but a Starbucks was a block away.

<Title>“You Get What You Pay For”
<Content>You get what you pay for. Mid-priced hotel in NYC. 20-30 minute walk to the theatre district so kind of far if you'rein town to see shows. Rooms and common areas a bit on the worn side. hallways on some floors had a musty, smelly odor. Water pressure in bathrooms very good. Excercise room has good quality equipment but it's obvious the equipment is not serviced as treadmills are not calibrated and very shakey when running. My biggest issue with this hotel is that the hotel advertises 'queen' beds. These beds are not queen beds. They are double beds. Talked to the manager in reagrd to this and he insisted they are queens. Which, again, they are not. Intend on contacting Hilton and Expedia (who we booked through) to inform them. All in all, the hotel is fine. We paid $150.00 per night over the fourth of July weekend, which is pretty decent for NYC

<Title>“It functions, not much else”
<Content>I can't add much vs. what the others have said. In general, the hotel rooms are old, musty and need to be redone. A couple of quick points. Pros: --Good location on Lexington --Staff was pleasant --Nearby food was decent (but it is NYC so I think there is good food all over) --Price: I think my company paid ~$200 which I didn't think was horrible for that Hotel and location in NYC Cons: --Old rooms, need to be completely redone. No details since it is literally everything about them. I would stay there again on personal business but would not pay more than ~$150 until the hotel does its remodel

<Title>“Great location for a long weekend in NYC's Midtown East”
<Content>My friend and I booked a 3 night stay under Expedia's unpublished rate for a 4 star hotel in Midtown and ended up at this Doubletree. Definitely a renovated hotel that shows its cracks (peeling wallpaper, painted bathroom door, rips in shower curtain). Despite those flaws, it's a clean place to lay your head in between street fests, Yankee games, 5th Avenue shopping, and Central Park running. Their welcome chocolate chip cookies are delicious and unlimited! Just stop by the front desk and they'll be happy to hand you more than one warm cookie at a time! The fitness center is small and a bit stuffy but it's small windows look out onto Lexington and 51st Avenue. They have about 5 Precor treadmills, two ellipticals, two stationary bikes, a set of free weights, medicine balls, a couple Swiss balls, and some other weight machines. Thought it was nice that each cardio machine had it's own personal tv and they do lend out headphones if you've forgotten your pair. Small towels and a watercooler are also provided. The number one selling point of this hotel is its central location. -17th NYPD precinct...0.5 blocks -McDonald's...1 block (directly one block behind hotel) -CVS...2 blocks -subway station (6)...literally right outside the hotel Less than a 15 minute walk to Central Park, 5th Avenue shopping, Time Square, museums, etc. Tips: -buy the 7 day unlimited ride MTA pass for $29 (I was only there for 3 days and had to add to my about $10 to my $20 10-ride card that I purchased from a Hudson News stand at Laguardia). -catch the free Staten Island Ferry to get a great view of the city skyline and pass by the Statue of Liberty. ferries leave every half hour and is an hour roundtrip.

<Title>“Not a dump but not like a Hilton-”
<Content>I am currently staying at this hotel and will do so a few more nights. I was a bit hesitant reading some of these reviews before arriving. Some people seems to love this hotel and some people think it is a dump..I do not understand either so here comes my opinion! Please notice that I am a Gold Hiltonhonors and by that I am a frequent traveller at both Hiltons and Radisson hotels from LA to Beijing to London etc.. LOCATION: very good, nice area and very close to everything. Walk to Times Square in about 15 minutes. STANDARD public areas: the lobby is very smart looking and so is the Met grill where you eat breakfast. STANDARD rooms: well..the furniture is pretty new, the beds are very nice but the room itself look old. The finish is not high quality, looking at hanging wallpaper in the bathroom, bad paint jobs on the bathroom door etc..The bathroom is very small but the room is pretty large (2 double bedded room). SERVICE: not what I expect from a Hilton Hotel. When we checked in the lady was searching for a room for at least 10 minutes..asking questions like" do you need two beds" - well we are 3 persons and I booked a room with 2 beds!! She then said "and you are staying for one night?? We had booked a 5-night stay..she also forgot to give us our voucher for 10% discount at Macys. If I come to a hotel, paying 300USD/night and has booked a 5 night stay- I want to feel welcomed! Yes, we got the cookies but I do not really understand what the point is with that cookie... CLEAN? OK. No problems. BREAKFAST: not as many items as Hilton usually has but fine. Good quality scrambled eggs, salmon, bacon, waffles, fresh fruit etc.. GYM: pretty good. Our son used it several times and was very happy with it. NOICE? The hotel has a police station and a fire station outside. We heard some signals before we fell asleep but after that, we heard nothing. AIR CONDITION: Noicy and not working so well. BED BUGS? None so far. So all together: for a very good deal, I might stay here again since the bed is very nice and the location is excellent! They need however to change the attitude among some of the staff. I am a paying guest and even a frequent Hilton guest so I expect the staff to be informed about my booking, give me the correct information with a smile and make me feel welcome!

<Title>“An Overrated Disappointment”
<Content>Listed as 4 star property, it is NOT. it is just worn and tired: old carpets in the rooms, pealing wallpaper, moldy and musty bathrooms the size of closets. OK, they are trying with newer linens and bedding, but this is the only hotel in NY I have stayed at that came with ear plugs next to the bed: a hint about a peaceful nights rest. Scheduled for a refurb next year, talk about their rating then, not now. Normal New York $15 per night internet scam. The staff was courteous and helpful, a plus, but no hint about what awaits you in your room. Wake up Hilton! This is not a property I would put my name on.

<Content>Thought i should finally write about this hotel, firstly new york is absolutely amazing wanted to go their my whole life and was so happy when this trip a this hotel had been booked by suprise!! This hotel is beautiful, rooms were a good size, nice bathroom and HUGE bed! location was excellent, literally walked to time square as soon as we dumped our cases at about 12am! staff were really friendly and also id like to point out, everyone use to tell me that new york was worse than london for rude people (im not a fan of london), but new york for me anyway was completely different! it was friendly random people would say hi n start talking and they are not shy in giving compliments!! its not as expensive as everyone may think, taxis are cheap, and we got the subway a number of times, would recommend getting bus from port authority to woodbury common outlet, nice clothes for CHEAP!!. also try get down to ground zero, very moving and strange as it may sound, its actually quiet down there... its something else. WHEN not if i go back to new york will definitely try to book this hotel!!

<Title>“Like an army camp”
<Content>Have stayed in hotels of this level all over the world for the last 30 years and have never had any real complaints before. The female reception staff were brutal - at every level there was no warmth. The male staff by comparison were warm and helpful. Full rate prices paid in advance in England two months before but upon arrival reception said "well we never actually confirmed your booking". Then they wanted to charge another $300 extra for each of the two rooms I had booked in case we incur any charges or damage the room. When I resisted we were treated like second-class citizens afterwards, despite having spent over £3,000 for 6 days flights and accommodation. In fact, in one of the two rooms booked for mother and teenage son we were told that (despite having the booking receipt for two beds) we would have to share and sort it out with the booking agent on our return to England. It was only after much debate that the hotel relented. And then we were presented with a bar bill which we had not incurred and when we said we had not used the bar at all during our stay and were not even in the hotel at the time on the bar bill we were told that they would be contacting security to find evidence from the CCTV. After going back 3 times that morning to check who had fraudently used our room number we were told to forget it as - "even if it was you or your son who incurred the bill we will write it off" . An unusual form of apology. Also, the hotel had some union dispute with the fumigation company who check for bedbugs and they mounted a 30 foot high inflatable rat in front of the main reception and stopped us on our way in to tell us their complaints about the hotel - also not a good advert. Would not stay at the Hilton Doubletree Metropolitan, Lexington Avenue, NY again.

<Title>“Pleasant well-connected stay”
<Content>Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel New York City Date: 24 June 2011 The hotel is economical, clean and secure. It is centrally located. There are good restaurants nearby. Transport is easily available. However, little noisy & poor bathroom facilities, which were old, though working properly. Bed linen not changed regularly and surprisingly there was some big rubber balloon rodent kept outside as a protest, warning people not to patronize the hotel as there were bed bugs. I did not find any bed bugs nor was I inconvenienced. Possibly some competitors of Doubletree giving misinformation. However, many people were put off by such bad publicity in this hotel and some others in New York.

<Title>“Great Customer Service, but the hotel needs some work”
<Content>Pros: -Good Location for shoppers, tourists and people doing business in the area. -Great customer service. Everyone was friendly, prompt, extremely helpful and I felt like they truly enjoyed having me as a guest. -Clean. -Very comfortable beds. -By NYC standards, the room size was very good. Of course, one is to expect a NYC room to be half the size of a hotel in Florida, for example. Cons: -Smelly. I am a HHonors diamond member, so typically I do get 'good' rooms; however, the first room I was given was terribly musty and smelly. They offered to have someone from housekeeping come to spray the room, but I asked for a change. The hotel was able to send up a bellman immediately to give me my new key. The new room was still smelly and was located in a completely different area of the hotel. -Shabby. The headboard is padded and in both rooms, there were notable stains. Also, the textured wallpaper was notably scuffed up. One towel in my room was noticeably worn in one area and was practically see-through. The ceiling in the bathroom was bubbled and it was clear that an old leak was painted over instead of being fixed properly. The closet door would not close properly. -Noisy. I did not notice much noise from the outside, but the hallway noise is definitely noticeable. -Room service was average at best. Although about the same price and level of service, the DoubleTree on Stone Street is a much better choice, but unfortunately, not within walking distance to my business.

<Title>“Nice hotel & good location”
<Content>Our family stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel for three nights in June 2011. We booked the hotel through Priceline (name your own price), and paid $110 per night, about $410 total with taxes. The location of the hotel is excellent, with many restaurants and stores nearby. Many major hotspots are also within walking distance - Times Square, Central Park, Empire State Building, etc are all accessible by foot within 15-20 minutes. We got a queen room, on the fifth floor, overlooking the street. Although a little run down, the room was a good size, with a clean bathroom and comfortable bed. The service at the hotel was excellent. All staff were polite and courteous, and very helpful. We requested a crib and a fridge, which were promptly delivered. We didn't have a car, so parking was a non-issue. We also didn't use the fitness center, and can't comment on that. The business center had internet access and printing facilities, which we used a few times without any problems. Overall, we had a good stay and would recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Shabby, stinky rooms”
<Content>I am a Hilton Diamond member, so assuming I got the best treatment, this hotel is awful. If you have no Hilton status, you would probably be better off sleeping on the subway. I arrived late and was given a room on the 16th floor - smelled like an ashtray - I called downstairs and the woman said I should talk to the manager since everyone complains and she had given up. Floor 15 is smoking and the smell/smoke is all over the the 16th floor. Rooms are very shappy. Thjis hotel if just plain awful. If you are a Hilton member it has by far the worst executive lounge i have ever seen. Hilton is supposed to provide free internet for diamond members... here it's free unless you need VPN which is extra - so if you travel for work... do not stay here

<Content>The bed was comfy, we didn't notice any bed bugs, so I can't comment on that whole situation which the hotel seems to surround itself in. The staff were standoffish, which can be construed as rude I guess. I don't appreciate a bellhop telling me how much to tip him. I am an Australian, but that doesn't mean I have a pint sized brain. "3 now and three when you pick up your bags" - buddy, I guess that depends if you do a good job. The rooms are small and dated, the bathroom is tiny. But everything functions, the check in and check out was easy, and for one night, it would do. I wouldn't stay there again if I had other options. It all just seemed a little impersonal. I don't care for Hilton hotels anyway, never have.

<Title>“Bargain in Midtown”
<Content>If anyone complains about the size of the rooms at this hotel, make sure you ask them if they've ever stayed in NYC before. It's very rare to find hotels with rooms as large as these in Manhattan, let alone rooms at DoubleTree prices. Everything was clean and comfortable and the front desk was very accomodating any time we needed something. The location is excellent, very close to subways, taxi's, and Grand Central Station. I would not hesitate to stay here again. ===== ===== ===== RATING SCALE: My ratings are generally based on value vs money. Thus, sometimes a simple hotel will receive a 4 or 5, while a fancy hotel can rank a 1 or 2 if I don't feel it was worth the cost. Also, a hotel can do everything right and still only rank as a 4, unless there's something really exceptional about it. 5 = Hotel gets everything right, and goes above and beyond. 4 = Hotel gets everything right. 3 = Hotel is acceptable value for money spent. 2 = Hotel isn't worth the money spent. 1 = Hotel should pay ME to stay there.

<Title>“Would stay again for the right price”
<Content>Great location (for our needs). Clean hotel with friendly staff (we didn't ask much of them, but all interactions were pleasant.) The room had just a couple of rough edges (sink drain could not be stoppered and had no hot water--only lukewarm--and too much force; fabric of lounge chair had questionable white stain; queen bed seemed sloped to center). It was a bit tight, but not atypical of NYC. Our room was on the back side of the hotel, so the view was nothing special, but street noise was minimized. The TV was nice, linens and bathroom were clean, maid staff was nice, city noises were minimal, and neighbors were only heard through the bathroom wall. They charge $15 for slow "high-speed Internet" and more for a boost to not-quite-as-slow. Typical of higher-end Hilton brands, but these days it really should be free. Many quick/cheap breakfast options, with Metro Cafe next door, Oxford Cafe a block away, and Au Bon Pain down the street. Not far from some good restaurants, but the west side of midtown has more variety.

<Title>“Good location, mediocre hotel”
<Content>As everyone knows it is difficult to get a reasonably priced hotel in Manhattan. This place is moderately priced, We paid ~$175 a night for memorial day weekend. However, the rooms are mediocre at best. They are clearly old and in need of a revamp and the bathrooms are equally unappealing. The general manager at this location is awesome! very accommodating if you need anything. Avoid his minions though, all very inflexible and incompetent. Oh, and there are cookies! And the location is great. Overall, not a bad deal for the money but avoid it if you're looking for any aesthetics.

<Title>“Excellent Customer Service ..... Doubletree ...Hilton Fans for life!”
<Content>First the basics... We stayed here during Memorial day weekend and the location is excellent. (corner of 51st and lexington upper East side). Short walk to tons of restaurants on 2nd avenue, subway around the corner, shopping 3 blocks away. Now the extraordinary... Never thought staying in New York City that a hotel can make you feel like you are the only and most important guests in the entire place. First day managers including; chefs standing in the lobby greeting guests and welcoming you to the hotel. Being in the business we were very impressed with the personal attention. We had an issue through a hotel communication mix-up that caused us to miss a boat dinner tour. After a fruitless cab ride to Queens we ended back up at the hotel and communicated our issue to the night manager. He was very empathetic to our situation and asked us to wait a few minutes to look into it. Approximately five minutes later he came back to us and made us raving fans for life. Without getting into details, the Double Tree - Hilton went beyond our expectations and turning a bad situation into an opportunity which showed us great service still exists in the hotel industry. We would like to personally thank Mathew the hotel manager and Scott the food and beverage manager for an unforgettable New York Weekend. We recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to stay in New York City. We will definately be back. Patty M. Leon & Keith Clougherty

<Content>After that everything goes down hill, Senior Staff and those at the front desk are rude and have no idea of what good customer service means. The hotel prices are over priced and I would advise take you custom else where. The rooms where quite small, their was three of us in one room, although the size of the rooms didn't bother us as we were there to see NYC not stay in the Hotel. We over looked tha NYPD and NYFD staions. On leaving our bags at the hotel after checking out we were charged $1 per bag to leave at the hotel and $1 per bag to retrieve them. Would not have been so bad until go realise that there is not locked room and bags were left unattended at times. (had the feeling that it was a case of Oh, their are English lets charge them for this). I plan to go back to NYC but not this hotel group.

Police station is right across, that will definitely make you feel safe day and night. but that is all the plus points i can come up for this hotel. can you live with noise? as it is right next to fire station and police station, you cannot get away from the noise. there is also no thermo stat in the room. that means the room temperature is fixed and you just have to live with it, like it or not. the room itself is not well maintained. you can see stains on parts of the bed. carpet is dusty. bathroom is tiny. sound proof is poor too. the worst part is its staff attitude. they will never apologize. they are just simply careless, ignorant. whatever the nature of the complaint it might be, they never bother to follow up, resolve nor recovery. the staff i refer to is from front line staff to senior guest relation manager. all in all, if you can live with all that, this hotel is for you to stay.

<Title>“Don't stay here”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here on business hoping to have the weekend in NY. This is NOT a good hotel. There is an awful bedbug warning outside that mortifies me everytime I walk in. The room is surprising large but with tired, worn decor. The bathroom smell musty. There is no coffee maker in the room, no frig. The bathroom is tiny and dark. The good points are that the staff is really nice and the location of the hotel is good. The prices for room service are of course ridiculous - $15.50 for a cup of decaf and a cup of tea last night?? I will never stay here again. Oh and the lobby is small and awkward, and there is always people milling around that do not look like business people, often sleeping...

<Title>“ugh”
<Content>A couple of things saved this trip. One I am not picky at all and two we bought this on priceline and so my expectation were low. That said....this was the smallest ugliest hotel room that I have ever stayed in. The carpets were threadbare. The furniture was what you would expect in a poor frat house. On the plus side...the bed was comfortable and the shower worked pretty well. The location was pretty good. This room was probably 1.5 stars...but priceline had the property at 3.5. The biggest disappointment is that I had believed Hilton/DoubleTree to be a very good chain. I would think twice about staying there again.

<Title>“Nice, comfortable stay. Great location.”
<Content>Was on a business trip to the city. As a HHonors member, I try to stay in Hilton hotels. I had meetings at the Waldorf, but was not impressed with the hotel rooms last time I stayed there. Was very pleased with the Doubletree. Many places in the city wow you with their lobby, but the Doubletree put it's effort in the rooms. While the room wasn't large, it was very nice by New York standards. Great location and the price was much better than the Waldorf across the street.

<Title>“I'm done with Doubletree NYC”
<Content>I always stay at the Doubletree when I'm in NYC. I've never really questioned it. But it was probably my last time. I've just realized what a dump it is. At first I did arrive at 1pm and was notified that I'd have to wait until 3pm exactly as no rooms were available. I've never had a problem checking in early. At 2pm I checked back in to see if rooms were available. Nothing. At 2:30 I checked in again, nothing. I was being persistent because I had a meeting to be at a needed a room to change in. At 2:45, nothing at 2:50 nothing and finally I left the hotel, changed a friend's home and came back at 5pm. I was put in room 1913. You should discontinue using that room. It smells rancid, the walls are full of mold and it isn't up to par with a Hilton hotel. I am not one to complain, or change hotel room but I couldn't bear the smell. I called to reception and they agreed to move me to 1837 and asked me to wait at the door and I would be greeted by a Bell man. After waiting 20 minutes in the hallway with my luggage, I called the reception from my cell phone. They assured me someone was coming. After waiting another 15 minutes I lugged my bags to the lobby to get the keys on my own. The room was clearly another smelly room. I'm not sure if there is mildew running through the walls or if the rooms need remodeling. Needless to say, I kept my mouth shut and stayed for 3 nights.

<Title>“The DOUBLETREE has lost its mojo! Too BAD!!!!”
<Content>I have stayed at this Doubletree on numerous occasions and have always been very satisfied. On a recent business trip to the city I am sad to report that the hotel has lost it's mojo. My recent business trip lasted for 5 nights and I paid 300.00 per night...not a great deal but fair for NY and a late hotel reservation. Here were the issues that made the experience challenging: 1. No temp. control in the room. This meant that even though it was 50 degree outside, yes in May, the place was air conditioned. Can turn off the air in room but not in the rest of the building. A thin waffle blanket did not suffice to warm the night. The sad heater provided the following night only heated it's immediate sorroundings. Spent 5 night freezing in my room. 2. Internet connectivity charge- 18.00 dollars....in all fairness this was advertised ahead of time. However, it's 18 dollars per device...WTF? Are you kidding me? The internet was super slow and not worth it. 3. Noise....this is always an issue in NY but on several nights there were loud parties on the floor- that in combo with the outside honking, which is just part of being in NY, made it very hard to sleep. 4. Bathroom ceiling was decrepit, the towel rack came undone - not really what you expect from a HILTON and certainly not for 300 a night. 5. On one of the mornings we were greeted by a giant inflattable rat with a bed bug warning about the hotel....this was a labor union dispute but the bed bug warning made me very nervous. Called the hotel and was informed there were no bed bugs. I did not see bed bugs in my room...THANK GOD!!!! NOW- the staff were extremely kind, accommodating, friendly and professional. They tried their best to make the stay comfortable. The manager gave me a night for free and took off the internet charges. This made it almost bearable but in reality, I can't justify paying that much when the hotel fails to provide what is necessary to meet your basic business need- great internet service so you can work from your room, a normal temp. room so you aren't freezing, and a proper noise level (even for NY). For 300 dollars a night there are so many places to choose from in NY. You see if you don't keep up your hotel standards, your clients will go elsewhere. That's what I plan on doing the next time I'm in NY.

<Title>“WORST HOTEL & CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER EXPERIENCED”
<Content>My boyfriend and I travelled to New York with a couple of our friends to do some shopping and the tourist thing. We have visited New York before but stayed at a different hotel and received impeccable customer service there. We didn't expect to receive the complete opposite staying at the double tree on Lexington. We travelled from Toronto and drove about 8 hours straight so we could skip all the traffic. We arrive at the hotel but could not park at the front due to all the taxis and other tourist parking. We decided to drive around to the side where we saw underground parking. There were a line of cars going in and out with a handful of guys parking cars. The infront of us drove into the car elevator to park his own car we assumed. As soon as it was our turn, one of the guys opened the driver's door and TOLD us to grab our stuff because he was going to park the car. My boyfriend didn't want to do valet and told him. Also, we had not checked in yet and wanted to know if we can go in and out. Again, this guy continued to give us attitude and told us once more to grab our stuff. He had to park the car because we did not know how to park the car in the elevator and there were numerous cars behind us. Fine! So we all grabbed our stuff and looked around if there was a trolly or another person to help us unload of stuff. NO THERE WASN'T. WE WERE NOT GIVEN A TROLLY OR ASSISTED AT ALL. They didn't even show us the way into our hotel. We all carried our stuff back outside of the garage and walked all the way around to the front of the hotel. As soon as we got inside - there were bell boys standing around with their trollys and still no one offered to help take our bags!!!! We tried to check in but we were too early. My boyfriend told them that we called earlier and had asked for early check in. The person he spoke to said it would be no problem. but the ppl at the front desk said it was not possible. They suggested to leave our bags with the bell boys and leave our cell numbers and they would call as soon as our rooms were ready. If they had told us that in the very beginning we would not have parked our car so early. We all decided to go and grab breakfast and leave our bags with the bell boys. As we finished leave our bags on the trolly, the bell boy asked for $6.00. He said that it would be $2.00 per bag to be left on the trolly and that he will need the first half now and the 2nd half once we pick up our stuff in the next hour. EFFIN' REDICULOUS!!!! Once, our rooms were ready, we picked up our bags, paid the rest of the fee and then carried all our stuff again to our rooms!!!!! They couldn't even help use the same trolly to get us to our rooms. At the time of check out we confirmed at the front desk that everything had been taken care of - rooms and parking. They confirm and again we walked all our stuff outside to the garage. We had to wait about 15 mins for our car and then they asked us to pay for parking. We told them that we paid inside and the front desk said everything was taken care of. The guy asked us for a receipt which the front desk did not give us. My boyfriend had to run all the way back inside and came back with a receipt. This hotel was the worst hotel we have EVER been to and they provided the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! The rooms were very small and the staff were not polite whatsoever! If i had to rate this hotel it would be -1/10!!! NEVER AGAIN!

<Title>“Great fitness center, decent location, hotel itself...ehhh”
<Content>This hotel all depends on your purpose and you budget. I travel quite a bit for business, as well as pleasure. This one was pleasure but I keep an eye on my stay from both perspectives. So, I will start with the good news. I was there with cousins for Yankee-Sox weekend. Being middle aged idiots our basic purpose was enjoy ourselves, relax, have a few drinks, and not take anything seriously. With that tone in mind it wasn't a bad stay at all. The hotel in is a decent midtown location. You are a few blocks from Rockefeller Center and other midtown stuff. The fitness center was outstanding. Maybe midweek with a bunch of biz travelers it would be crowded but I was alone in it every afternoon. The room was worn out a bit. Not disgusting or anything (no bed bugs or stuff others suggest at all). But it is in need of upgraded rooms. Bathroom was worn out. Again, it would do but if I were looking for a big weekend in the city with my family I would have been disappointed with the room quality. Having said all that, I paid 200 a night so for that money in Midtown on a weekend it was fine for our purposes Little hint for some fun, especially if you are with kids: walk to Le Meridien for a world class burger at a crazy low price (for NYC). There is a small burger joint in that French hotel that is world class. Fresh chuck, great rolls, etc. It's one of those "in" places that few know about yet so your family or friends will think it is very hip (cool decor), you won't spend much, the food is great, and then you move on. Good experience for your kids and won't kill the bank

<Title>“This hotel is horrible”
<Content>Stayed at the Doubletree this week and won't be staying there again. Check -in was a mess. Arrived from the airport around noon and was told there were no rooms available. There would be nothing until 3pm. Others arriving, however, were given rooms. Mine was not a last minute reservation. It had been made weeks earlier. I checked around 2p and there were rooms available, but no one had called, as promised to let me know. When I got to the room, I was shocked. I've seen dorm rooms that look better than the room I had. Bare walls, dirty carpet that clearly had not been vacuumed, moldy bathroom, old chipped bathtub......and ear plugs on the nightstand (police and fire sirens all night). This hotel needs a major renovation....nothing at all inviting about staying here. Have stayed at many other Doubletrees in other cities and none have been as bad as this.

<Title>“Disappointed this time around”
<Content>After writing raving reviews about the Doubletree it pains me to write this one! I have stayed in the Double Tree two times before this trip and have always been very happy with the room and service. However ,on this trip I was very disappointed. When we checked in the staff were very welcoming and friendly. However our room was a big let down. Especially compared to other rooms I know for a fact are avalible in the hotel. We were situated on the 11th floor which wasn't a problem we even had good views from our window. However the room was run-down and almost shabby. The sink was actually located in the bedroom rather than the bathroom which was inconvenient. The sink plug was broken, I actually got on my hands and knees and repaired it myself. The heater grills had fell off and were on the floor. The heater ended up being useless anyway. It took ages to warm up and on one day didn't get warm at all. You could forget about using it at night also because it was so noisey. When checking out the conceierge refused to help us with our pre-booked shuttle arrangement because the hotel was not affiliated with the company we booked the shuttle with. I thought this was strange because the conceirege on other stays had always been more than happy to arrange things for us. He seemed more concerned with telling us how bad the shuttle company was at picking guests up on time- it turns out the shuttle company ended up arriving exactly on time and we had no bother with them at all... also don't bother saying hello to the house keeping staff you get met with snarls! It was also off putting on arrival being welcomed by a huge inflatable rat outside the entrance. Disappointed with my stay this time.

<Title>“Decent hotel - Excellent location”
<Content>Stayed in Double tree metropolitan for 2 weeks on a Business visit. The best thing about this hotel is its location (Lexington Avenue). Being in Midtown the hotel makes it very easy for business travellers to access downtown and other offices easily. The hotel as a whole is nothing extraordinary. The rooms are basic, though would have loved to have a working room temperature system working. My room would freeze in the night and had to call the staff to check it out. They then installed a portable heater in my room which did make my life a bit easier. During my stay the hotel was being refurbished, so there were plenty of noise down the aisle. The rennovation did give a facelift to the old hotel. Though my stay there was comfortable there are many more hotels in the vicinity which offer more luxury at the same comparable prices.

<Title>“Smells like a Burger King -- and that's the NICE room”
<Content>Yuck. I am staying in this hotel now. I pre-paid for my room, and it was a big mistake. I'm not looking forward to the next couple of nights. When I arrived, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the lobby seemed clean and modern. Check-in was efficient. But when I got to my room (room 752, as a warning), it was horrible. Dark, with dingy yellow wallpaper peeling from the walls. There was something, not sure if it was ear wax or blood, smeared on the side of the nightstand. Just a really horrible place. Old bathrooms with chips in the tub and ancient shower heads. While it seemed clean enough (except for the ear wax or whatever), the smell of the cleaning products was incredibly overwhelming. Lemony and disgusting. I headed right back downstairs, and the front desk agreed to move me right away. I'm in a better room now. It's still not what I'd call nice, but it has a few more pieces of furniture and lights, and doesn't look like it's been through Hurricane Katrina. But, it faces the back of the hotel and a restaurant, and guess what happens around dinnertime? Yup -- smells equivalent to the back room at Burger King. I kept the window closed for awhile, hoping it would help, but it doesn't. It's quiet back here, but it might put me off burgers for awhile. I come to NY for business a lot. I always try to stay in decent hotels, and usually succeed. I have had good experiences with Doubletrees in the past, but this one has ruined my streak.

<Title>“Hotel is a telecom utility - watch the multiple internet fees in the room”
<Content>Watch out for the internet access in the room - costs $ 14:95 PER DAY PER DEVICE ! therefore if you logon with your cell phone, pad and computer be prepared for a $ 45 a day fee - notwithstanding that you can only use one device at a time. This is a rip off and guests would be well advised to demand the hotel correct the bill. PS Other Hilton Hotels provide free room internet access for multiple devices.

<Title>“Not a great value for the money”
<Content>Stayed here for 5 nights in May. For $300 per night I was unimpressed. I travel a lot for business and expect to pay about 2x in NYC verse everywhere else. The Cons - Lexington ave @ 52nd st. isn't really that close to a lot of things. Its Mid town -- but you'll walk a few extra blocks. No coffee maker in the room for $300 per night! Serious ! The Heating and AC is really ancient and tricky to make work. Problem in both of my rooms. the neighborhood can be very noisey due to a fire house nearby --- so negotiatie upon check in for a room on the quiet side. You definitely cannot sleep with the window open. the rooms with 2 beds are insanely small even by NYC standards. More like Paris small. This hotel would sell for $70 per night anywhere else in the US. try the Hilton on 6th ave ---much better and can sell for about the same price.

<Title>“Excellent location for a fair price”
<Content>The hotel is on Lexington Avenue which is only ever a few minutes walk from 5th Avenue. We were amazed with how quite the noise were from the streets below and we were not too many floors up either. Next to the hotel was a nice cafe and just after the that is the East 51St tube station. Tube tickets can be bought for $27 and last for 7 days. The rooms was decent enough and the beds and towels were always changed etc. We also received some warm cookies on arrival, which was nice! You are only about 7 blocks up from Grand Central Terminal so if you're flying into Newark or JFK you can pay $15 dollars and get on the coach which drops you off here and then you can easily walk to the hotel. A taxi would cost in excess of $60 + tip. There are some really nice Italian restaurants on 51st and 2nd, one in particular called Lasagne and the speciality.. you guessed it lasagne.

<Title>“mistreated guest”
<Content>We stayed at this Doubletree hotel on Saturday, 4/23/11. The next day after we checked out, we stored our luggage with the bellman and came back ti the hotel at 7p on 4/24/11 to pick our things up and then went home. Upon arriving at home, I realized that items were missing from my suitcase. Upon informing security, I was referred to their insurance company who advised me that nothing could be done because I did not tell them when I was at the hotel..(how could i have told them then?) Hotel security was not only unresponsive, they were rude. Do not stay at this hotel as you may get robbed and the hotel will do absolutely nothing to help you

<Content>The hotel is very well situated (the metro station is literally 2 meters away) , the room and bathroom are very clean and the beds are incredibly confortable. Although this is the last think someone would consider when choosing a hotel, I have to mention that at check in, they give guests a couple of delicious chocolate chips cookies. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Meh”
<Content>This hotel was in a great location and we got a good rate for NYC, but the accomodations are average at best. I had a room with two double beds. The room was a decent size. The TV was nice, the desk was very small, the dresser was tiny. The closet doors were broken. The bathroom might be the smallest I have ever seen in a hotel. There was only room for one person to stand in it.

If you are a Hilton member then you get HHonors as well. Their bar is very good and perfect for business meetings. They have a good business center too.

<Title>“An Uninspiring Choice for Manhattan"”
<Content>No significant complaints. But it's a pricey option for a not-so-great hotel although the staff really do try to go above and beyond. We paid roughly $299 a night for a rate that included breakfast and wound up with a tiny room with two tiny beds. My wife decided to sleep in our 8-year-old's bed because there wouldn't have been enough room in mine. And apparently a king with a sofabed just wasn't an option, despite my gold Hilton status. This hotel is mediocre. We made a last minute booking and could have done way, way better on price had we booked well in advance. I looked for alternatives but the weekend we were heading into Manhattan there just were few other rooms available anywhere. Hotel is in a great location if you're on the Upper East Side and there's a subway stop just outside. Hotel looks like it has been recently remodeled but I'm sure in as few as five years the remodeling will look cheap and dated. You can probably do better than this particular Doubletree, but again I had no major complaints (other than price). And again have to stress that staff, from check-in to check-out, really were pleasant. "Cozy" is a word that you'll see used to describe the rooms on the official hotel website. "Cozy" means small.

<Title>“Look for something else.”
<Content>I thought that because this is part of the Hilton chain, the rooms would be good. I was wrong. The foyer of the hotel is nice enough, with a decent bar, but I'm here to sleep, and the rooms are awful. I stayed in a room which had connecting doors to the rooms either side. These let through the noise badly (they leave ear plugs by the bed!). The bed is strange and very small, and although the room has a sofa, you can't see the TV from it. The room layout is bad, and unattractive. There's no fridge/mini bar and no tea or coffee making facilities, which makes for a more expensive stay and less convenience. The location is good, but there are plenty of other better value places. Don't risk staying here. The final straw was the bed bug scare. They've apparently had an issue with bed bugs but don't think this affected us. We found out about this after we arrived which made for a few phantom (or maybe real) itches.

<Content>We just returned from our Honeymoon and we have stayed at this hotel for 6 nights. We want to recommend this hotel and mention the great staff that work there! From the check in till the check out they have treated us like we are the most important customers in the hotel! We want to say many thanks to Vritikka Kapur and Simone Boxhill about everything and I wish to have such a women like that in my own bussiness!!! They made our stay more then prefect and we enjoyed every moment of staying at this great hotel. Also we would like to mention that some hotels near that area try to say that this hotel has a "bed bugs" inside the rooms and this is not true at all!! The rooms and the beds are very clean and with a big space compare to other hotels at New York. Go there without thinking..

<Title>“Well positioned and excellent value”
<Content>The Good • Very well positioned • Pleasant staff • Access to local restaurants • The bedding is very comfortable after 33 hours of travel The Not so Good • Easy access to power points, I needed to move furniture as the desk lap’s external plug was faulty • I did not receive a booked wakeup call and consequently missed a flight

<Title>“Real bad experience, will never go back again!!”
<Content>Even though we had reservations and had paid the room in full, we had to wait one hour after check in time (3:00 pm) because they did not have rooms available!! We were not alone, around 30 people were waiting for rooms too. When we finally got to the room, it was a mess!, the bed was not done, the bathroom was dirty, and it looked like someone had just left the place a minute ago. We went to complain about it and there was a big line for complaints also! The lady in charge of whole checking in process was very rude!! This hotel is not worth the money and the location is not as good as they mention, I rather pay more next time and get a better service!

<Title>“Eh.”
<Content>Yes the location is convenient but this is nothing special. Check in kind of unfriendly. Lobby dark utilitarian has the ambience of a train station waiting area. Hallways narrow and dark. Rooms ok size but tired. Real negatives- no thermostat. They determine whether you get heat or cold depending on the month. Not great on a warm day in April to have heat or nothing $15 for internet access? In 2011? Are they kidding? And difficult to even make the connection when you pay. Internet should be like electricity- a basic part of being in a hotel- like electricity or television. This is a dated policy No coffee maker in room. No coffee in lobby. No way to get a cup of coffee but room service for $6 + service. Or walk somewhere No refrigerators- waitlist offered but clearly that was a joke Big inflatable rat on the sidewalk warning of bedbugs made me itch all day. I hope it was not valid but it is not a positive Doors are tired_ locks don't work right. Bathroom door won't close or lock. Closet room right up against the bathroom door. No laundry bag. Tv awkwardly located taking up desk area. Outlets poorly planned Bed was decent- as long as it does not turn out to have bedbugs!

<Title>“Great location, great deal for NYC”
<Content>As soon as I'd booked the reservations directly through their website, Jasmine emailed me asking if there was anything special they could do for my stay. I'd mentioned it was an early birthday trip and there were mini cupcakes with candles brought to my room the first night. Little touches like this can go a long way in getting repeat business, just as much as having a great location and clean, comfortable rooms. Our room was actually decent sized for Manhattan. Can't beat the location--an easy 10-15 minute walk to St Patrick and all the shops near Rockefeller Center. The subway station is right around the corner, and the bakery/deli right next door has decent prices for breakfast food or a quick lunch. I'd debated between staying at the W a few doors down versus the Doubletree for roughly the same prices and went with the latter to get my Hilton points and am very glad that I did. It was a bit worrisome when we got there and saw a big inflatable "bed bug" right outside the hotel's door (didn't have time to read the signs to see what the beef was about), but it was removed by afternoon (though it showed up again the Monday morning after). But all in all, the Doubletree turned out to be a fabulous stay. Very nice staff and fast elevators. Always felt safe walking around the hotel's area even late at night. No complaints here as I've paid a lot more $ for much less space at higher end boutique hotels in NYC.

<Title>“Felt taken care of”
<Content>I booked my stay online from across the street. By the time I walked over, the staff had my reservation and I was ushered into a delightful room with views of the Empire State Building. The room was cozy and comfortable. I didn't want to leave. The downstairs lobby had free wi-fi and a great bar to unwind in. This hotel is perfectly situated and walking distance (or train) distance to everything. The staff made this stay memorable. The go the extra mile for you. I felt like the hotel was in sparkling condition and had that touch of class while being down to earth. I found it to be worth every penny.

<Title>“Over all rooms where poorly kept not up to date and smelled horribly”
<Content>I recently stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. The front desk was of no help and very unpleasant. The hotel hallways had a repulsive smell and where always cluttered with maid carts. The room it's self were small. Not enough space to comfortably stay with another person.not enough drawer or closet space. Most hotels I've stayed in have a coffee machine in room and complimentary bottled water this did not. It was a big inconvenience especially when you walk to the vending machine located in a smelly dirty stairwell just to find out it is not working. The bathroom sink constantly clogged. The room tempature was not able to be Controlled. You could also hear noises from outside and noise in the hallway. The only thing this hotel has going for them is the location.

<Title>“DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL-CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE”
<Content>Reviewing my hotel choices on Trip Advisor, I decided on this hotel and as an added bonus I saw a promotion for $135 per night. I clicked on the link to their website and was given a rate of $228. I called the reservations line and hotel front desk and was hung up on four times before asking to speak directly with Jasmine Jimenez, Guest Relations Manager who frequently responds to complaints on Trip Advisor. She wasn't sure how to explain the discrepancy and told me that she would email "Doug Levitt" the reservations manager and asked for my email address. I followed up a day later with the reservations line and was informed that there is no one by that name and I was forwarded to "Pam" who stated that she was from GUEST ASSISTANCE-CORPORATE OFFICE -GUEST RELATIONS. She put me on hold for 10 minutes and basically interpreted the Trip Advisor promo. I asked if there was anything that they would offer me and she said I shouldn't book on 3rd party sites(even though the TA link goes to their website) and that TA is responsible for their content. She wasn't willing to offer anything,not even a free breakfast buffet or even the $135 rate for 1 out of the 4 nights that I was staying there. I've been a loyal Hilton and Double tree guest for years and I'm really disgusted at the treatment. I'm taking my business to a better hotel where customers are treated better.

<Title>“Charged twice!! Check your credit card statement”
<Content>Me and my husband stayed in this hotel over the weekend and I was planning to leave an exellent review, however, we just had a call from the Credit card company indicating that the hotel has charged us for 2 nights ( despite this booking being already prepaid at Hotels.com)! If you don`t have a helpful credit card company that will advise you of such fraud - be aware and check your statement. At the time of leaving the hotel we have being given a bill for $14 for using the internet but two days later they charged $200 ! We have now called the hotel and trying to sort it out.

We had accidently booked a smoking room and after talking with Ms. Jimenez, it was quickly changed with no hassle. The location was amazing, close to the train and everything else we needed. The rooms were fantastic. I would definitely recommend this hotel!

<Title>“Nice location, clean and safe”
<Content>I stayed a week in February 2011 and booked a standard Queen room, and was disappointed on entering the room to see that there was a connection door on each side of the room with a bed that could be folded back in the wall. Obviously this room is used as a living room or for families wanting connecting doors. I could hear the TV on one side and the guy snoring next door so asked for a normal standard room with no connecting doors, and the upgraded me to a King size straightaway. It was clean, the service was good and helpful but the hotel in itself is more of an American 3 stars than four. The location is great though. The wi-fi at $15/24 hrs is a rip off, just go down to the lobby, connect from there and go back up to your room and you will stay connected for an hour and can do as many times as you wish!

<Title>“A good brand let down by this hotel”
<Content>I've stayed here twice and unfortunately both times have had their problems. The most recent stay was greeted by a 25 minute wait for checkin. That would be fair enough if all desks were open and staff weren't standing around in the lobby (namely the customer relations manager). That was merely an annoyance. Upon entering my room and going to the bathroom i was greeted by a faeces smear on the toilet seat. The mess was properly cleaned by housekeepers after I had to make two separate visits to reception. I was given a "sorry" but no new room or compensation. The second problem was their premium high speed internet access, costing around $20, which was extremely slow. For example google.com took over 10 seconds to load. In the hotels defense they did say "sorry" for the bathroom issue and did refund the internet charge after I complained. That said I think they are seriously letting down the brand image of quality, service and price. I personally wouldn't recommend staying at the hotel as I don't feel you get the quality experience you expect and pay for from a Hilton group hotel.

<Title>“Great location and Fabulous value”
<Content>This is a super place to stay. Apart from the perfect location so close to Bloomies etc (and its right opp a Starbucks & next to the subway as well) its great value. You get welcomed with a warm delicious cookie, free computer access at any time, very comfy beds and quite OK room size. I would definitely stay here again as the next hotel we stayed in was twice the price, was older and you had to pay for computer access! The location is fantastic. The only drawback is the proximity of a police station and you do hear sirens all night but that didn't bother us (it was almost funny as they made different whooping noises not like our horrid sirens at home). There is a pretty awful cafe next door but its very close to other great eating places. You know the Marilyn Monroe photo where her skirt is blown up from beneath? It's taken outside this hotel which was a bit of fun!

<Title>“expensive and disapointing”
<Content>The only good thing about this hotel -and I admit it is important- is the location. If you are spending a few days in NYC you are close to 5th Ave. etc- But it is extremely expensive in comparison to the quality and size of the rooms, the carpets are old, and it is not as clean as it should be. I wouldn't recommend it to any friend.

<Title>“Good value and well located”
<Content>I normally stay with friends in New York, but I was on a crazy flight schedule so decided to stay at a hotel. As a Hilton Hhonors member this one seemed reasonably priced, well located, and also very easy to get to from JFK airport on the subway - you could almost fall out of the subway station into the hotel! I'd never stayed at a Doubletree before I read the mixed reviews here and was slightly apprehensive, but the stay was absolutely fine. Check-in was quick and efficient, and I got my warm cookie (although they forgot to give me the coupon that was part of the deal I'd purchased). I made sure, having looked at reviews here, to make sure I didn't get a room overlooking the police station - probably best to ask for a "quiet/high floor room" upon arrival. The room was spacious, by New York standards, and clean. The room had (in realtor terms) a "partial Chrysler building view". The free internet/breakfast I got as a Diamond Hhonors member was the icing on the cake, although during my one week-day morning the employee in the executive lounge couldn't cope with the throughput of customers - no plates/coffee/pastries. There was a manager there but he seemed to spend more of his time managing the poor employee rather than helping her! I didn't use the main restaurant, so can't comment on that (used the Metro next door and also a diner round the corner, left when you come out of the hotel and left again at the next corner). I was going to meet a friend for a beer in the hotel, but then saw the prices so decided to go to a sports bar a couple of blocks away. There is a timeshare sales rep near the elevators, but either because I look poor, or was travelling solo, I didn't get picked on at all! In fact I already own a Hilton timeshare so they would be wasting their time (go to the presentation by all means, but buy in the resale market for 1/3 of the price!). The only negative thing, which they can't really do much about, is the thickness of the walls. Actually, I should say thinness as I could just about follow the conversation that the couple in the room next door were having - through the wall! Even this wasn't a major issue. Like a previous reviewer I too saw the large rat outside, but luckily no bedbugs inside. I can't see the union's point of view that more staff would mean less bedbugs.... I also find it interesting that a lot of the recent reviews are by people who have posted once, and don't give objective feedback - saying that sleeping at a train station would be better is a really odd thing to say! I paid $150 a night and would be happy to stay here again.

<Title>“Decent hotel, but lousy service - Not up to Hilton Standards”
<Content>The physical aspect of the hotel is perfectly fine, but the service is not. Great location mid-town Manhattan for business. The room was typical for NYC, a little small, but very comfortable, good bed, easy to work in, and great for business trip. HOWEVER...service is not up to Doubletree and Hilton standards that I expect. First off, the bell hops are either standing around doing nothing or agressively trying to take your luggage, call a cab or whatever. I don't mind the initial service offer, but after I have told them that I am not interested, they need to learn to BACKOFF! Restaurant service was bad. Wait staff was not attentive - and here you need it. Worse, this hotel AUTOMATICALLY adds the gratuity. I really don't appreciate having my choice taken away from me. This place seems to be always pusing the Hilton time share. Every time you walk by their desk and you have to to get to the elevators, you are harrassed to come and talk to them. Give me a break, in a business hotel - really??? Finally the bell staff in front of the hotel is less than honest when asking about transportation. They push hard their towncar option and fail to really tell you that the cabs real cost. They lead you to believe that their option is better priced - isn't. After dealing with those guys I felt like I needed a shower!! The one redeeming service - the conceirge.. This lady was excellent. She provide me with several really good restaurant recommendations, fairly priced and great quality. Now if only the rest of the staff could learn from her.

<Content>My group rented a conference room for a business meeting. When we asked about coffee service in the morning we were told it would not be available because the hotel was short-staffed. It was suggested we stop the meeting and go down to their restaurant or leave the hotel and get coffee across the street. Note to Conference Room Manager - how about going downstairs and getting the coffee yourself? I can never recommend such an unreliable hotel for any further business meetings.

<Title>“Could Be Better”
<Content>We stayed at this Hotel for 4 nights. My feelings Good Cookies-when you register you get the best cookies in the world Clean- My first criteria for a hotel-Clean Towels- I hate calling the front desk for more towels. No problem at this hotel Service- We left some clothing in the room. We called, they sent the clothing back by UPS. We paid for the shipping which is right Maybe Location-On the east side.Not near the most places for tourists. However there is a subway station at the door. If you go to New York learn about the subway system it takes you where you want to go at a reasonable cost. Two blocks away on 2nd. Ave there are lots of reasonable priced restaurants AND a real supermarket. I liked the location Bathroom-Two rooms, one with a vanity(sink), the other with the toilet and bathtub. The rooms were small and I felt cramped in each (see below on effects). I prefer a single larger Bathroom. BAD Wifi- free in the lobby. Cost $14.95 per day in room. Can use the computers in the business center for free Coffee/Tea maker in room- Nope. Got mixed message from the front desk. First they said it was a Union problem. When I pointed out that the Hampton Inn (also a Hilton Hotel) has in room coffee makers, the story was changed to "this is a Doubletree policy". The real reason is that the vanity is too small for a coffee maker, part of the poor design for the bathroom Tub- Makes a good footbath. Too shallow for a bath Vanity Room- No towel bars so the hand towels must be left on the vanity. They get wet and can't be used again. No room for toilet kit Checkroom- Cost us $6.00 for a suitcase and two backpacks for two hours storage. Phone- Free local calls. DO NOT make a mistake dialing. We did and it cost $7.11 for a ten second call Refrigerator- Not in room but available on request. IF ONE IS AVAILABLE

<Title>“no service but safe and great location”
<Content>My stay: no cookies offered at check in; did get upgrade as a gold member plus could check in pre three pm; the exec lounge (my third stay here) is a D-. Really rude personnel, no silver ware or plates, coffee maker not working, no clean bowls or plates and if I ask the help looks so out out. Honestly, it was hardly worth the walk down the hall for the so called executive lounge. No juice and no juice cups left either day. After 11 AM, there is not even a water pitcher or coffee available here either. plus I was skittish with all the bedbug alerts: posters and huge signs and leaflets warning me about bedbugs at the entrance to lobby. I feel I had some bites so I took precautions, but came home very itchy. So, great location, okay room, miserable customer service except for one polite helpful clerk as I checked in: Venus.

<Title>“Enjoyable stay - would use again!”
<Content>We arrived from London for a 5 night break for my partners birthday. On check in the fact that it was to be my partners birthday was independently picked up on by the receptionist and we were immediately upgraded! So far so good! We had requested a late check out due to our return flights and were immediately granted those as well. Once the check in formalities were completed we were given our warmed cookie each! It is, of course, a gimmick but there is something rather welcoming about being presented with a cookie on your arrival after a long flight. As has been said many times, the location is fantastic and just perfect for a stroll to central park after breakfast or to the designer shops on neighbouring streets. The Waldorf Astoria is across the road for afternoon cocktails if you like! Excellant restaurant called "The National" is next door and was recommended by the concierge for dinner. The rooms were beautifully clean and the beds were dressed with non - allergenic bedding! I don't know if it was the bed, the bedding or the combo but I slept and woke up alive and refreshed everyday we were there. Every morning we left a few dollars on the pillow for the maid service and came back everyday to find a thank you note. It is a large, busy hotel and due to that there is an element of it being impersonal. Staff work hard at being friendly and welcoming in spite of the volume of visitors passing through. We had the hotels breakfast buffet twice, downstairs in their restaurant, which did not have the biggest selection ever and I remember thinking it was quite pricey for what was on offer. We met a friend prior to dinner in the Doubletree lobby bar and had several, wonderful champagne cocktails in pleasant, relaxing surroundings! We were always well attended to by the friendly waiting staff. There is a well equiped gym there and a free use business centre with high speed internet access. Altogether our stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan was a positive experience and we would certainly recommend to friends to stay here.

<Title>“Relaxing experience in NYC”
<Content>We booked this hotel as part of a package holiday and stayed there 3 nights on a room only basis. The location was ideal and accessible to many of the places we had planned to visit. One of the attractions for us became the wonderful and extremely popular cafe next door to the hotel which served a fabulous breakfast and range of dishes to cater for all your needs. Back at the hotel our room was clean and comfortable with a flat screen TV and we were provided with fresh towels each day. The complimentary soap, shampoo etc were replaced each day which took away from lugging around these daily necessities. This hotel is extremely busy and it took between 20 to 30 mins for us to be allocated a room upon our arrival. We were able to access wi-fi from the reception area where many of the guests can be found sat on their laptops as there is a charge for access to this service. Both my husband had no complaints about this hotel and thoroughly enjoyed our stay there. The only thing we would advise guests to be aware of is the staff hotel who attempt to recruit guests to take part in a 2 hour presentation involving some type of timeshare with the Hilton hotel group. Whilst we found it difficult to say no to the extremely persuasive young lady at the desk, we did manage to cancel our appointment the following day. All in all this is a good hotel and we would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Good Value in Midtown”
<Content>I stayed at the Doubletree with my family on weekend trip to NY. The hotel is well located, clean and has helpful staff. The rooms are a bit small, but certainly functional. The food was good and room service was prompt. The Doubletree was a great base of operations from which to explore NY. The Doubletree is a good value and I would recommend it to others.

<Title>“Good location, an excellent and predictable value in Midtown Manhattan”
<Content>This Doubletree sits at the intersection of several subway lines, and just one one stop away from Grand Central. We have stayed there three time now, and the experience has been consistently solid. It's a busy place, but the staff is friendly and helpful. If you bring a car, the bellhops do a good job of handling the always exciting task of dealing with a car in NYC. While not cheap (this is New York), the rate is an excellent comparative value. Similarly, while the rooms are smaller than those in your typical Doubletree, they are well-sized by New York standards. Some of the rooms (upper floors on the south side) have unobstructed views of the top of the Chrysler building.

<Title>“moldy smell in bathrooms and indifferent staff.”
<Content>The hotel was extremely disappointing! The first thing we noticed apon entering was the stong moldy smell that permeated the room. It was also so small it was difficult moving around. The room in general was a 2 star at most. When we asked for a room change due to the smell, they said no other rooms were available. So, we were stuck paying $259 per night for a room that smelled like a moldy bathroom. The staff are totally indifferent to complaints. This is probably because they get so many!

<Title>“Helpful staff, great cookies, ordinary room, tiny bathroom”
<Content>We stayed here and booked a room with two double beds for 4 of us, two parents and two small children. The first room we booked was very ordinary to say the least and this was very disappointing as we had been recommended this hotel by a friend. It was like a very dodgy renovation, nothing was well done in the room fit out, all teh doors and wood was chipped and there was wierd wall paper in the bathroom which didn't seem to match anything. The worst thing about the room was the bathroom, so small you could hardly turn around. We asked to be moved to a suite. The suite was definitely a better size for a family. The bathroom was still as small but at least had a vanity in an anteroom offf the bathroom not in the bedroom like the previous room. The staff were helpful but there seemed to be some confusion about our move the suite. We were told it would be ready to move to at 2 pm but when we returned t this time we were told it was not ready. We waited another 4 hours for it and we had a run in with one particular member of the reception staff about this. The location of this hotel is very good, however I will not be returning.

<Title>“Great location, modern and attractive”
<Content>Pros * Modern and attractive * We were first checked into what turned out to be a disabled room. My wife didn't mind but I found it a tad awkward peeing almost horizontally. The room was also a bit awkward as it was designed to suit a wheelchair. When I rang reception the next morning, we were moved with a minimum of fuss. * Free business room with internet and wifi in the lobby * TERRIFIC location- walking distance to most city sites. CONS * Some lower floors can be VERY loud as a fire station and police station are across the road. * A mystery restaurant service fee appeared on our bill at checkout. We had tipped each day at our breakfast (we were given complimentary breakfast, possibly because they realised we were booked into an unsuitable room), but wouldn't have done so if we knew there was a service charge. I feel that this was quite dishonest and should have been made clear to us upon check-in. * Staff are quite aloof, but that's just a New York thing. TIPS- Don't book a town car to the airport (through the concierge) the night before. On the morning of departure, we were approached by hotel staff who organised the same car for around the same price as a taxi.

<Title>“Now Tips are "Fees", Welcome to Doubletree Airlines”
<Content>First, let's talk about the good stuff regarding this hotel. It is in an excellent midtown location, walking distance to practically everything from Times Square to Central Park and the Upper East Side. The price/value ratio for the hotel is usually good and you can usually secure a rate below $200 during the January/February period. Additionally, the staff is usually very responsive and pleasant. In terms of Hilton HHonors privileges, I usually get upgraded to the Executive Floor with a complimentary breakfast, although like most Hiltons, the room size/quality doesn't seem to be notably better than non-Executive Floor equivalents. Also like other Hiltons, the concept of a separate check-on for Hilton HHonors members is non-existent. Now for the bad stuff which really left a negative impression at the end of a very long trip. I checked out of the hotel and asked the bellman to store my bag. His reply is that there is a $2 fee for bag storage. I am a little miffed that I just spent over $1,000 on my stay and was being asked for two more dollars, but OK, so since I am without cash I ask the reception staff to add the $2 to my bill. "I can't do that", she replied. I explain I was just told that there is a $2 fee for bag storage and I didn't have any cash, so I needed to add it to the bill. "No" she advised and directed me to the nearest ATM. "Or", she offered, "you can talk to Them to see if they will waive it". Of course, Them is the bellstaff, that work for the same hotel as the check-in agent and were standing three feet away, but clearly she was not willing to approach her own co-worker with such a heinous request. So it quickly became apparent. The $2 is not a fee, it's some sort of mandatory tip. And oh yeah, it MUST be paid in cash. I don't have a problem tipping. I tip everyone, including the bus drivers on shuttles at the airport and a daily tip to the housekeeping staff. However, portraying a tip as a fee and not allowing me to pay for it on my bill (just like I am able to add a tip on my credit card in a restaurant) is deceptive to say the least and unacceptable for a Hilton hotel. I will likely stay at this hotel again because of its location, value and my Hilton HHonors status, but certainly there are things to improve here.

<Title>“Good hotel, but several flaws”
<Content>Here for a night on business, so I didn't pay for the say. The hotel is quite clean, ideally situated if one has business on the east side or in Queens, and with excellent personnel. But there were a few niggling issues: -faded carpet in my guest room on the Executive Floor (Hilton Honors Gold) -no food or drink of any kindin the Executive Floor lounge until breakfast time at 7AM (latish for NYC, I think); -one of the two telephones in my room didn't work -I had booked a rate that included parking. But the bill slipped under my door charged that same rate plus $48 for parking. They rectified the bill upon my request; still, it's annoying to have to check on this. Would I stay here again? Yes. Did they exceed my expectations? No.

<Title>“Trapped in NY”
<Content>Hotel at check in was the last pleasant part of the stay. Checked and found no bed bugs was reassuring. The room was cramped. The bathroom dated, cramped and the shower controls were broken with little to no hot water. The worst part was the checkout and the doorman who was trying to move patrons to taxis and ignored anyone with car service.

<Title>“Good for Location & Value”
<Content>Spent a night here during one of the Winter 2011 snowstorms. For the price $149, it was an excellent value if you're not a fussy. Check in took 30 seconds, as front desk was fully staffed on this sold out night. Most reviewers have it correct, rooms are getting tired and could use some updating, but it was clean, queen bed was comfortable, and flat screen TV was big. Midtown location is great, close to everything, with plenty of restaurants nearby. Would stay again for the price.

<Title>“Very comfortable stay”
<Content>I traveled alone to NYC on business in early December and loved this hotel. The room was spacious, comfortable, and immaculately clean, with a king-size bed, ample desk, bedside tables, chaise lounge, and large flat-screen TV. Lots of room for storage too, as the desk doubles as a bureau, and there is a closet by the door to the room. Loved the 1960s vibe throughout the property. Didn't take advantage of the downstairs bar or the seating area in the lobby, but the whole ambience was very chill. Felt perfectly safe even as a solo female traveler, both in and outside of the hotel. As far as location goes, few NYC hotels are better. The Metropolitan Doubletree is within a brief walk of a couple of subway stops, and only 5 or 10 minutes away, on foot, from St. Patrick's Cathedral and Rockefeller Center. Of course, since you're in Midtown Manhattan, there are a million other attractions that are just as close, but those are simply the highlights I remember best. For more daily needs, there are several nearby cafes, a nail salon and massage parlor right around the corner on 53rd St. (The front desk clerk was kind enough to tell me I could find better prices there than I could for services in the hotel.), and a Staples (for your last-minute business needs!). The hotel itself even has a small giftshop with some nice accessories and souvenirs, in case you need to bring a gift home for anyone. It's open until around 11:00 PM, as I recall. I was very impressed by the service; I chatted with room service when they came to my room, and they were warm and friendly. The hotel was also very accommodating regarding the terms of my stay. Extending my stay by an extra night was very easy, and when I invited a friend to join me at the hotel, they took down his information and agreed to welcome him while I was out on the town and valet his vehicle. They gave him a copy of the room key at no extra charge. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who could afford the rates. If you can spring for the price, there's absolutely nothing to complain about. Otherwise, if you need a cheaper option, consider staying in Jersey City and taking a PATH train into Manhattan. Oh, and one more thing -- the complementary chocolate chip cookies ARE fantastic!

<Title>“Top value in midtown east”
<Content>We spent 2 nights here at $120/night via Expedia. Given the 51st and Lexington location adjacent to a subway entrance, it is hard to beat that. Check in was fast and friendly - including the warm chocolate chip cookies. Our room was on the 11th floor. It was typically sized for Manhattan and similar in size to rooms I've stayed in for $250/night. I've posted a photo so you can judge for yourself. The king size bed was comfortable. The room was in good condition and was relatively quiet (I was a little taken aback when I walked in and found free earplugs on a nightstand... didn't need them.) Others have complained about the a/c -- we had the opposite problem - the room was warm and no amount of lowering the temperature really would fix that. Not very green, but we opened the window a little to chill the room, solving the problem. The front desk said they'd send someone but we saw no evidence of that. The shower was strong and hot. There was free wifi in the lobby and $15 wifi in the room. When we come to NYC, we don't stay in the room much so can't beat this deal while it lasts.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>One of my favorite new hotels in New York. I typically stay in Times Square and usually pay alot of money for a small room that is near all of the action. This hotel is about a 15 minute walk to all of that action...I will tell you that one day I thought my face was going to freeze off but it was Feb. so I shouldn't complain. Check-in was great...I got the nice warm cookie which would make anyones day special. The room was nice and big too. I was able to spread out my computer on the desk and get some work done. The bed was comfy and there was a nice big safe in the room for all of my valuables. We had a breakfast meeting in the resturant but I would not recommend that. It took us almost an hour and half to order and get our food. We ate at Cafe Metro next door the next two days and got our egg white omlettes in 3 minutes flat. The hotel is not a far walk to Rockerfeller Center. Always nice to see the skaters. I wanted to do the NBC tour but got there 15 minutes late...it closes at 4:30pm on a Sunday...I was definately bumed because it would have been cool to see the SNL stage. Everything in the room worked great...HBO is always a plus too. There is also a fitness room at the hotel. Lots of cardio equipment and it was included with the hotel...most of the Times Square Hotels have terrible gyms. Do not take recommendations for resturants from the hotel staff...just go to YELP because there choices were terrible...I am sure that the staff gets some free meals to send hotel guests to these locations. Also there is free wifi in the lobby, which is great because it turns into a meeting place for all of the hotel guests. Grab a drink and check some emails.

<Title>“Doubletree Reservation Website - Trap Alert!”
<Content>I review this hotel last year. It's a good hotel but they must be very desperate to keep their clients. Read on: I booked a room at the Doubletree Metropolitan at a rate of US$151.20 a month ago. At that point, that was the best rate available on their website. I prepaid a non-refundable rate. (Don't ask!) Last weekend Travelzoo announced a US$119 rate for the same room and period. I called Doubletree reservations, they referred me to the hotel's manager (talked to Tracie Cass, the rude manager) and they refused to honor the new rate saying that I chose a nonrefundable rate. I strongly disagree with this policy! Hilton advertise Best Rate Guarantee! Don't fall for that , if you book and prepay for a Hilton hotel, you are stuck and there is nothing you can do! Doubletree never again!

<Content>We were delighted with the location being only two minutes walk from the Waldorf Astoria, right next to the 51st and Lexington subway station and ten minutes walk from 5th Avenue. The room was clean but the bathroom needed a little work around the door. and the bath is like a skating rink with no grip when having a shower. The staff was helpful - we would certainly stay here again (I am writing this in the busy lobby!).

<Title>“Very Small room and really small bathroom”
<Content>This hotel is OK. Have stayed at many different NYC hotels so for the price I guess this OK. Howerver, no coffee pot in the room is a real draw back. I like a cup in the morning without having to go out. This is the first hotel in 5 years that has NOT had an in room coffee maker. Staff are very nice but the concierge seemed clueless and did not know the city at all. I asked for a small map and they did not have any. The bed was fine and the room was in working order. However, the room is very small. I was solo but it would have been very difficult with another person.

<Title>“Still average at best....”
<Content>the reviewers before this must have stayed at the wrong hotel because this hotel is average at best. Because this hotel is the NYC hotel for my company i need to stay at it at least 6-10 nights per month. Unfortunately the hotel is still only average at best. Bottom line is you get what you pay for. It is always $80-$150 cheaper per night than the hotels nearby including the marriott east side, the w, and the jefferson...and for good reason. The property is in dire need of updating as the decor in the hallways and guest rooms is circa 70s/80s. (the bar next to the lobby was recently renovated). the climate controls in the rooms rarely work effectively, the tubs back up with water while showering frequently, the smell in the hallways and rooms is bad, and you WILL need the earplugs that the hotel cleaning staff leaves on the nightstand due to the fire station right next door to the hotel. Some of the staff of the hotel tries hard to be very pleasant and professional, however, many of the staff are just 'ok' or even unfriendly. Bottom line on this property is if you want to save money stay here, but, if you want to have a clean room at a pleasant 3/4 star hotel go across the street to the marriott east side or next door to the W.

<Title>“A fantastic hotel, couldn't have been better.”
<Content>Visited the hotel for a long weekend in Jan 2011. Room ready on arrival at approx 3pm. After reading reviews, I requested a room on a higher floor due to potential noise nuisance from the street and Fire Dept. I was given the option of floor 10 with a nice view or floor 16 with the view of a wall! Decided on the 10th floor room and was assured it wouldn't be too noisy. Throughout the stay, we could hear the Fire Dept sirens however they did not keep us awake at any point. Walls are thin and we could hear our neighbours on occasion however, this did not keep us awake at night either. The room itself (1004) has a nice view, as promised, and was not to far to walk from the lift (one of my grumbles in most hotels!). It was very clean and spacious enough for 2 people sharing. 1 king bed and a sofa. Plenty of drawer and desk space. Wardrobe was large enough however not many hangers available. Approx 10 which is not a lot for 2 people. Bathroom was small but again, not a problem. Sink was outside of the bathroom which was handy. Public areas are pleasant and clean. Staff always made an effort to greet you and were on hand if there was anything you required. The bar was closed a few times when we returned to the hotel but sure it opens 6pm daily. A beer and a spirit with mixer was approx $20. Slightly expensive but it's to be expected for a hotel on Lexington Ave. Bar food was very impressive and reasonably priced. We ate breakfast at the hotel on our last morning and it was very nice. Full menu available. We had the buffet for approx $23 each. For other breakfast alternatives there is Cafe Metro which is next door to hotel (cheap and cheerful) or I would highly recommend Raffles at the Raddison (left out of the hotel and a few blocks along). The business centre was excellent. 60 mins free browsing. Printing of boarding cards was free. Wifi available for a charge in the room however, free in the lobby. Very reliable. Location is very good. Approx a 15 min walk to Times Sq. All in all, we were very pleased with our stay and could not fault the hotel. As we had stayed in NYC before, we were pleased to be slightly away from the hustle of Times Sq but close enough to the main attractions.

<Content>Quick check-in and very friendly staff. The warm cookie is always a bonus. This hotel is in a really great location. Out of the way of common tourist traps, yet you can still walk to pretty much anything you'd like. Room was a generous size for New York City standards and the room was clean and well designed. What was absolutely shocking is that I received a survey asking about my stay. Although I had a good experience, I did note some small concerns I had. I actually got a personal reply from staff a few hours after I hit the submit button. THAT'S service right there.

Though the hotel is older, the Doubletree Metropolitan provided exceptional service, an excellent room with a balcony, a reasonable price, and the perfect location for exploring the city by subway (right outside the hotel) or by foot! Was there Jan. 15 - Jan. 17 celebrating our 17th wedding anniversary. We will be back next year! Thank you!

<Title>“Great location, room a little shabby.”
<Content>The location was absolutely perfect for our short weekend trip. This was me and my friend's first visit to NYC and we wanted to hit the major attractions that we could in our short time frame (arriving Friday and leaving Sunday). Although there was a lot of walking involved, we didn't mind the walks and were able to see Grand Central Station, Central Park, 5th Avenue, Times Square, St. Pat's Cathedral, Rockefeller Center, Macy's, and Empire State Building and I felt we had adequate time to do everything. Saved a lot of money on transportation. The room, especially the bathroom, was more shabby than I would've liked, but overall with such a short trip we weren't in our room much anyway. Check-in on Friday was very busy and our original room wasn't ready at 3 but we were anxious to get sight-seeing so we took a room on the third floor that was ready. Probably the reason for the more run-down room, but again we didn't care much. Overall, this is a great location, continental breakfast was also great, and probably would've given a higher rating had we been able to use our original room as I assume it would've been nicer.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel, Excellent Staff, Excellent Location!”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel in November 2009. I appreciate this was a while ago but I always read reviews before I buy anything or stay anywhere so feel its only fair I write a review on this hotel. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by a really polite and smart dressed guy, who helped us with our cases to reception. Checking in was hassle-free and the receptionist was really polite and welcoming. We were given warm chocolate chip cookies as a 'warm welcome' which are the best cookies I have EVER tasted. I even purchased a tin of them to take home!!!! I would like to say that the cookies are such a nice touch and make the stay at this hotel just that bit more special! The receptionists were also very generous with the cookies and would ask you if you wanted one when passing. Me and my partner actually made jokes of not making eye contact with the reception just in case we got offered a cookie haha (refraining from putting 10 stone on in 5 days). This is in no way a negative though - jokes only! Me and my partner had such a lovely feeling staying here it almost felt like home and made our trip to New York the best time of our lives! I can't describe how happy we were with the hotel. The room was also amazing - huge comfy bed, huge tv, powerful shower and clean towels. We were also provided with branded toiletries e.g Loreal/Neutrogena!! Again, that special touch that makes you think they really care about your stay with them. The made service was also excellent. Don't get me wrong, there may have been a little tear in the carpet in the corner of the room or a scratch on a wall but this is no way puts me off the hotel and shouldn't anyone else! Overall, the room was in excellent condition and was kept clean. We could hear some noice outside when the window was open but we were staying in New York - which is of course the city that never sleeps!!! I would like to say a special thank you to the reception who were excellent at all times. I think the receptionist I usually dealt with was called Karen??! An american/chinese lady. I definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying there on my next trip to New York. I know my review may sound a little 'over the top' but our trip was truly amazing and I just wanted to write this review.

<Title>“An excellent experience”
<Content>I am surprised by the mixed reviews for this hotel. We had an excellent stay, on par with my other consistently positive Doubletree experiences across the country. I shared a room with a friend for a two-night stay in the city. Having lived in NYC for many years, I just need an affordable and clean homebase for quick and active trips when I want to keep an independent schedule without feeling tied to or in the way of friends who are hosting me in their small apartments, now increasingly with babies and kids. If this Doubletree keeps offering the excellent rate we got (~140/night), I may very well become a regular here! I found the entrance/lobby/bar area fragrant, cozy and cool-looking, the staff friendly and responsive, the welcome cookie yummy, the elevators efficient, the halls narrow but clean, and the room nice. The room (1 queen-sized bed) was a bit small, but this is to be expected for NYC and the lower rate. The segmented bathroom, with the vanity and sink separate from the shower and toilet is an added convenience for sharing this room. Everything was CLEAN and in order. Our bathroom was spotless -- which is really important to me. However, I did notice that some of the ceiling paint was peeling, probably due to a combination of shower steam and poor ventilation. It wasn't major, but I hope Doubletree monitors it and repaints before it gets too yucky. Our room was provided with a set of earplugs, which I didn't need. But light sleepers should be aware that city street noise or hall noises (room doors opening and closing and/or housekeeping staff in the morning) are to be expected. My only suggestion to Doubletree on this point is that they should consider replacing the room doors with heavier/more solid ones to soften hall noises. I'm a good sleeper, so I really didn't have an issue with noise. In fact, I really enjoyed the comfortable bed! I asked for two extra blankets just after arrival, and staff delivered them promptly. Thanks Doubletree!

<Title>“If you can get a good rate for the hotel then ok....but don't pay full price!”
<Content>My husband, young son and I booked a room here at the last minute the day after New Years - it was a bit crazy in the lobby checking in and the room wasn't ready yet, but the hotel did check our luggage for a small fee so we could explore while we waited for the room. This hotel is within walking distance of Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center. We requested a room on a high floor and got a larger than expected double/double room on the 16th floor. The room we were given was oddly shaped but if you look at the exterior of the building you can see why. The decor is modern and the clientele mostly youngish. We were greeted with the Doubletree Warm Cookies - in fact they gave us extra cookies, which was really nice. Room service was expensive (to be expected) but quite prompt. We did hear a little bit of street noise, but only if a siren passed. (The hotel does provide noise reducing ear plugs) Two things we really didn't like - there was no coffeemaker in the room and the room got WAY too hot if the heat was on - there was no way to control the temperature from the thermostat that was on the wall in our room. It may have been broken. But - even when the heat was off, the room stayed much too warm for us. Fortunately, we were able to open the window a bit to let the cool outside air in, or it would have been unbearable. Also, our son was very disappointed to find out that the option to rent Game Cube games had been disabled by the hotel, but was still advertised on the TV menu. Room was clean but not spotless - I would have preferred a cleaner floor in the bathroom. We didn't use the Wifi or have a car to park - both are expensive extra charges.

<Title>“Disappointing Experience”
<Content>The reception is very dark, crowded by people in/out, sitting all around on Internet and in the bar. Reception staff is very unfriendly snd features 'Staff is the King' attitude. Rooms are relatively large, however a bit dirty and clearly a major overhaul is required. There is no refrigerator in the room. Internet connection is a disaster, super slow with frequent (short) drop outs. When chacking in, my card have been 'overcharged' significantly (by 47%) against what I have been actually booked for. Much to my surprise, the last night they 'charged' my card by extra 230 US$, i.e. reaching total of 60% 'overcharged'. No logical explanation provided by the staff, except of the fact that 'computer is doing that' and the money will be returned to my account within 24 hrs (remains to be seen).

<Title>“This Hotel has a zero tolerance attitude to its clients”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel a number of times over the past 10 years. I made a "non refundable" booking for 2 people on Dec 24, 2010 for 4 nights from Feb 21 next to tie in with an Aer Lingus flight that day from Ireland. However the confirmation showed that the booking had defaulted to Feb 24 ie the night before the return flight to Ireland. I called the Hotel to get them to correct the dates within minutes of getting the incorrect confirmation. Despite my offer to accept a change to the intended dates in an upgraded room at my additional cost the Hotel were not for turning. In their opinion "non refundable" means absolutely no changes will be entertained even one that offers them more revenue.I have never asked for a refund; all I want is to get a booking on the requested dates. I have asked Aer Lingus Hotels and their Web booking intermediaries to talk to the Hotel but despite their severe embarrassment the Hotel still refuses to make any alterations to the 4 night booking from Feb 24. Not only have I used the Hotel in the past but I am also an investor in the Hilton group. What a way to treat a stakeholder!!

<Title>“GOOD LOCATION, TIRED ROOMS”
<Content>Stayed 5 nights to celebrate a 50th birthday in NYC. Modern lobby area and quick check in but heart sank when opened door to room. Very tired decor and bathroom was pokey and quite gloomy. On positive note the bed was very comfortable and cosy after long day walking out in freezing weather. We had room at back of hotel so no view and not too much traffic noise. Only woken up one night of stay by screaming guests walking along corridor at 3am. No tea/coffee making facilities. Teens enjoyed free internet access in business centre to catch up with friends back home. The location of hotel was excellent and for us, a better option than the very busy Times Square. We bought a metrocard and used underground right next to hotel to get everywhere. Excellent little diner round corner to left of hotel as you come out. Metro Cafe at side of hotel very expensive.

<Content>We really enjoyed this hotel...subway just next door...clean; very friendly reception people. Be sure to ask for a room away from the fire station...we did hear the sirens but it was not disturbing. The price and location were good for two ladies on a budget. Nice deli down the street...Oxford Cafe I think...not as expensive or crowded as the deli next to the hotel.

<Content>The location was great but that is about it. The staff at the front desk are unfriendly, however the bell men were very nice and helpful. The room looked like it hadn't been updated in years. The walls were dirty, the rug was dirty, the bathroom sink was leaking, the shower was clogged. The room was not worth the price. I would not stay at this hotel again nor would I recommend this hotel to a friend.

<Title>“Nice location but....”
<Content>My husband travels extensively, and is a Hilton Diamond member. We have stayed at numerous Hilton properties throughout the world. Thought we would try something different on this trip as we normally stay in Times Square. The Metropolitan hotel location is awesome, but that's about it. First and foremost, the noise level at this hotel is awful. Old hotel, old windows which equates to very noisy. Apparently, this hotel is near a police or fire precinct, so all night long you hear sirens. Also, whenever our neighbors opened or closed their doors, it sounded like they were coming in our room. Very noisy. Now, to the next "discomfort". Old hotel - old heating system. Once they turn on the heat, it stays on. Our room was way too warm, and no way to cool it down except for opening a window. Noise from outside and noise from inside = horrible experience. Hot Water - first hotel I've stayed at in years that we didn't have hot water - just warm - for showers. We were traveling as a family with one small child. There was a small chair/love seat in the corner. However, it was next to a window and the chill from the non-insulated window made it too cold for our daughter to sleep. (Five feet away from the window it's too warm!!) Next item - executive lounge. One of the worst lounges for a Hilton property. This hotel is in a great location, but it needs some major improvements. Doubletree Times Square much much better, and much much quieter.

<Title>“Not a bad value”
<Content>The good: location nice bathroom with shower only staff was good - nice bar - good looking ladies working at check in desk (thought little personality) The bad: - room was really cold at night (tstat was set at 80) - Needed a detailed cleaning (I am a stickler about cleanliness under beds and places dont typically look). Not the cleanest. - There were toe nail clipping (all ten) under night stand, which was directly next too bed. Really gross. - Carpet needed a shampooing. - Toilet. This was a problem for a guy when doing #2. The water was really shallow and needed to be careful something important didnt fall into the water. Overall I would stay here again. For the price I was happy. I have little expectations for NYC hotels. Way over priced and always need a good deep cleaning. This doubletree was OK and I would take my family there.

<Title>“Good Hotel & Location”
<Content>I recently stayed at this hotel, and couldn't really fault anything to be honest. The rooms were very clean & modern although a little small, but it is NYC after all. Hotel has a great location, subway station is right next to the hotel for the 6 Train, and also a really nice Deli next to the hotel called the Metro (I think)!! The wireless in the hotel is chargeable, but you can use it for free if you walk to the corner of 51st and use the "Staples" network, or is also free in the Waldorf Astoria just across the street. Overall a good stay in the hotel...if you are a light sleeper, then ask for a room overlooking the courtyard, as this was where my room was, and couldn't hear any traffic at all, even from the 6th floor!!!

<Title>“A typical mid range hotel, no more no less”
<Content>My experience was adequate and I have to say, compared with my pevious 4 day stay in Washington DC, which cost me exactly half, it really was no better and having to ask for coffee making facilities I thought was penny pinching to the extreme. I guess it suffers from what so many similar hotels do by trying to be one thing but having to cater for the mass tourist market. Given the number of hotels in New York I wouldn't denigrate this one but I would certainly suggest a good check of the whole market.

<Title>“A great location and value for the money but tiny bathroom!”
<Content>Great location convenient to everything. The room was small, but very clean even though the carpets are beginning to show signs of age. No slippers and only one bathrobe in the room and the pillows were also a little less than new. When we first arrived, I discovered that the bathtub did not drain--but a repair crew was dispatched quickly and took care of it immediately. The bathroom was tiny and the caulk along the tub needed to be replaced but it was evident that it had been cleaned with care. The most disconcerting thing was the way we could hear our neighbors come and go into their own rooms--the first night I thought someone was actually trying to get into our room and I freaked out! For women alone, I would be concerned about the long hallways and the fact that the elevator does not have secure access. Late at night, however, there was a security guard checking that all people taking the elevator had a room key. We loved the location and the bed was as comfortable as we have come to expect at any Doubletree. Great breakfast buffet and lots of other dining options around. For the price we paid, this was a fine property...if we had paid more, I do not think I would have appreciated the smallness of the bathroom. I felt that the staff cared about the guests and we were even called by guest relations on our last night to check if the stay had been to our satisfaction. I think management is addressing some of the issues that have gotten this property poor reviews before--I would stay again!

<Title>“Great Midtown Location”
<Content>I stayed at the Doubletree in mid-November for three nights for work, and it was a comfortable, good experience. My interaction with the front desk staff was probably the least desireable part of the experience as she was not particularly friendly, but I will chalk that up to the New York attitude. The concierge was very helpful, as were the bellstand staff. I stayed in one of the smaller guestrooms, but for just me it was comfortable and clean and relatively quiet (some guests were noisy in the hallway one late night). One small maintenance issue that was resolved almost instantly. Nice little breakfast/lunch place next door offered good breakfast. I was able to walk to the theater district and restaurants on the Upper East Side, so I thought it was a great location.

<Title>“Good location, decent value, thin walls -- below average sleep”
<Content>T'giving weekend in NYC -- stayed here before but had switched to another mid-town hotel for most recent stays (London NYC --- highly recommend). We enjoy the location, during our original stay in 2008 we were going to a Yankeesgame and you cannot beat the proximity of this hotel to the subway stop -- it's on the corner. For this trip we were looking to get a quick weekend away and cut some of the expenses down. This hotel is a reasonable bargain -- but understand you're getting what you pay for. Bellmen were excellent, quite helpful. Front desk was cheerful, friendly and helpful. We needed a rollaway bed and it was delivered quickly. Woman cleaning the rooms was extremely nice and friendly. All of this was great. Not sure there's actually a restaurant in the hotel -- if there is it wasn't open much of the time. Use the cafe Metro directly next door. Here's the negatives -- the rooms are OK. Emphasis on OK. Not terrible -- but not even close to above average (you get what you pay for....). For his trip the biggest negatives were the paper thin walls. We had a group next door that were taking up two rooms each across the hall from the other and it was non-stop slamming of doors, chatter and other miscellaneous noises from next door. Now, before you say "that's not the fault of the hotel" understand this -- when they slid open or closed a draw for their dresser -- you heard it. When they attempted to open a window -- you heard it. I can recommend this hotel, again, with the caveat -- you get what you pay for. BTW -- Strongly recommend the Smith & Wollensky located two blocks away at 3rd and 49th

<Title>“Inferior Hilton Family Property, do not recommend”
<Content>Not happy with this hotel. Stayed here for 2 nights for a weekend "get-away" to NYC. We are Hilton Honors "Gold" members and choose Hilton family properties whenever it is practical to do so. There were several other hotels we might have chosen to book, both Hilton family and non-Hilton, at the same rate or less, but we decided upon the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel. Bad choice. In our rez we asked for a room upgrade if available in lieu of the extra 1,000 pts. Our rez was for a standard queen. We arrived at the hotel at 11:00 a.m. Friendly & professional reception. Room not ready (no prob, we are very early). Stored bags ($6). Went out for the day and returned to the hotel at 5:30 pm. Long check-in line but it is 5:30 pm; got our room key.Went to assigned room, which we were told was an "upgrade" per our rez request. The room was in the process of being cleaned. Went to the "Ex. Lounge" and dialed the front desk to inform them room not ready & request re-assignment. Operator picked up and transferred me to the Front Desk. Phone rang on & on; no answer. Tried 3 times- same result. Decided to check on room; housekeeping had finished and it was ready (around 6:30 pm). Found stained walls, peeling paper, damaged drapes, etc. The room was in very poor condition~ found a number in the room for the "CareLine" & called ~ explained situation & was given a different room. Went to new room, it was just as bad, this time the BR was much smaller and the bathtub & sink were stained. Again, very poor condition. Called CareLine again. Explained again. We were asked to come to the front desk where the manager would meet us and escort us to a "really beautiful room". Waited for some time at the front desk and had to re-explain to a not- too-friendly receptionist the situation. Manager met us and escorted us to another room (the third room), manager very pleasant and apologetic. The 3rd room was in better condition overall and had a decent view of the Chrysler Building, but still several major issues- the shower head was not connected to the wall, the heater/ac unit was banged up, the shades were dirty, carpet worn, walls with obvious scrapesetc. We later discovered that the bathroom fan ran continuously. Anyway- the manager was quite nice. I asked it really, didnt they have something more in line with what we expect from Hilton? Well, this is an old hotel, he said. We thought- OK, enough. We just want to get on with our weekend.The manager later sent us a bottle of inexpensive red wine, choc. covered strawberries, and promised a free drink at the bar. Well, it was something, and we appreciated our concerns being heard. Went to the bar for our free drink. Bartender's attitude was almost surly. Bartender asked us many questions and told us to go get a voucher from the front desk- I said "why dont you just call the manager". OK- CONS: Initial reception area dark, poorly organized, and much too small for the size of the hotel. I dislike greatly the hotel lobby decor and layout. Out of the 8 staff we spoke to on the phone or in person, 3 were friendly and professional. The manager was very pleasant and I give him an "A". The other 5 were almost, if not actually, rude. The room(s) color scheme was not to our liking (retro yellow / orange / blue ) and DH likes retro! The third room we were assigned should have been the room we originally reserved (except it had a king rather than queen bed), NOT the upgrade.I feel strongly that we were "cheated" out of our upgrade- if one isnt available, fine, but dont charge us our 1K pts per night by assigning a substandard room and then making a halfway decent room appear to be an "upgrade"! How stupid do you think we are? The Ex. Lounge is a joke. Small, dark, and unstaffed other than someone replenishing supplies. Very limited selection of soft drinks, snacks, etc. I asked at the bar for a bottle of Club Soda / Tonic (as this wasn't available in the Ex. Lounge). Tonic only available on tap and then charged me $4 for a 10 oz bottle of Club Soda. Mediocore breakfeast. Eggs were awful. PRO's: Nicely located for a midtown east hotel. Subway 10 steps from the hotel; if you are traveling the east side, this is a good location- we were mainly in the East Village so this worked well for us.

<Title>“A great hotel in a great location!”
<Content>My biggest concern after reading some of the reviews, was the room sizes. Our room was more than adequate, with plenty of room for suitcase storage etc. We had booked a standard room through opodo , so were pleasantly surprised. We were on the 19th floor, and it was really quiet all week (not that we spent too much time in the room) One tiny minus point was being not far from the roof, there was an annoying noise, so we had the window closed most of the time. I am not sure if it was fans etc, but not too much of a problem. The room was spotless, and the king size bed was amazing!! It was just so comfortable, with crisp white sheets etc. I did try & pick spots, by examining the sheets etc for stains, but there were none. If i really wanted to find fault, the carpet was a little worn by the doorway, but that's it !!! The staff were very friendly, and the warm cookies on arrival are a lovely idea, and scummy too. The location is just fab, right next to a subway station, and within walking distance of Times square, central park etc. I would defiantly stay here again, and have no qualms in recommending it to others

<Content>Seven ladies set out to celebrate turning 40 this year and what an amazing trip it was! We deliberated a great deal about the choice of hotel - and we were so happy with the choice we made! The Doubletree Metropolitan was great! It had it all - location, price, cleanliness, excellent staff (especially the Guest Relations Manager Jasmine) . We will definitley go back to NYC and would certainly reccommend this hotel!

<Title>“Excellent Hotel with Fantastic Manager”
<Content>We stayed at this Hotel for my 30th Birthday from 29th October 2010 to 1st November 2010. When I got to the hotel, I realised I had picked up the wrong suitcase from the airport. Upset, I asked staff for the Manager (Kerman). He was extremely helpful and so nice. He stayed up until 1am that morning trying to locate my luggage and as it was my birthday, treated us so well. We have never known such hospitality. This hotel was spotless, all the staff we came across were polite and more than happy to help. If it had not been for Kerman the manager, I dont know what we would have done, he finally located my luggage the next day. It was the best trip we have ever been on and such a fabulous welcoming hotel. We would definately recommend it and will stay there again.

<Title>“Large room in a great location”
<Content>This was my first trip to NYC and I did a lot of internet research prior to booking the hotel and read on numerous sites that small rooms are to be expected when visiting the City. Since I was traveling with a friend, we wanted two beds, and I thought finding such a room might also be difficult. However, we were so pleasantly surprised! Our room was spacious and had two queen sized beds. My only complaint about the room would be that the door seemed a bit loose and didn't seem to lock properly. However, we brought it to the attention of one of the housekeepers in the hallway on our first day and she showed us how to secure it. The bellhops were very helpful and the service the hotel offers for holding your luggage prior to check-in/after check-out was great. There is a minimal charge, but it is worth it. Check-in was simple (don't forget the Doubletree cookies!) and although we were not able to get to our room any earlier than the stated check-in time, we were able to stash our bags and begin exploring. The concierge desk does have room for improvement. The lady who helped us on two occassions didn't appear to be very interested and seemed a little put off by my request for theater information. On the day I asked for information on getting to Yankee Stadium, she simply shoved a pre-printed subway sheet to me. Fortunately, you can't go anywhere without maps and City information being readily available and we were able to fend for ourselves. The best part about the hotel was something we didn't fully appreciate until the last day of our 4 day weekend - it's location. It is located at the corner of Lexington and 51st in Midtown Manhattan. Each day we walked towards Times Square and the Broadway area, and we didn't really just how close we were to Central Park and all the great shopping on Park and Madison Avenues. With it being our first trip, it took a couple of days to get our bearings, but I think this hotel is located in a great spot - with a subway entrance right outside, a Metro Cafe next door, St. Patrick's Cathedral about 2-3 blocks away and Central Park easily within walking distance. There was a fire station across the street, but noise was not a problem. We paid about $200/night and in New York that is very reasonable. While not a luxury hotel, the room was clean, very spacious and provided everything we needed - especially a great location. I would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“OK, but tired and in need of an overhaul”
<Content>My wife and I had stayed here before years ago, so we booked a room again the week of the NY Marathon. The hotel is acceptable, and we had no bad experiences, but I am curious why the Hilton Corp. does not invest some money in improving the cosmetics at such a premium property. The location is very good, and the staff was fine, but the property deperately needs new carpeting, wallpaper, paint, fixtures, etc. Most of the public areas appear to be decorated in circa 1978 brown and red "mod" decor (which actually looks very bleak, not "mod"), and adds to the tired, old look. Many carpets in halls, lobbies, and stairs are nearly threadbare, and wallpaper in the halls has peeling seamsand bumps underneath where the adhesive is bubbling, and baseboards black with years of cleaning cart wheel impact marks. To be fair, though, many manhattan hotels are expensive, old, tired edifices without any elbow room in public spaces and tiny rooms that serve masses of travelers every day that need a hotel for only sleep .....this hotel accomplishes that need well. Other notes....the exercise room is pretty good, breakfast is adequate, the lobby is fine (but tacky), the bath amenities are good, the HVAC in the rooms is poor, the bed was OK, the neighborhood is very good (much quieter than most other midtown hotels, and safe). Everything was clean.

<Title>“No problems, no hassles -- great location, recommended!”
<Content>We stayed four nights at the Doubletree Metropolitan, part business, part leisure. It was an all-around good experience; no problems at all. Initially we were registered for a room on the third floor, but all we had to do was ask, and we received an upgrade to the 16th -- important in NY and especially here because the police/fire precinct is next door. All the basics you want -- good water pressure, new mattress, good linens, nice decor, good amenities, never-crowded lobby, business center printers that work, good unobtrusive housekeeping, internet service (not free, but it works well). Very clean, room safe works, no evidence of bedbugs. Nice bar in the hotel, and right next door is a cafe with coffee, pastry, breakfast stuff, much less expensive than any hotel's. NYC isn't cheap -- this was around $300/night -- but here you know what to expect and you get it. To me a hotel should be a place you don't have to think or worry about and this one excelled at that. Also, the subway is right on the corner, and the location is wonderful.

<Title>“Good location, friendly staff, needs a few tweaks”
<Content>Friendly staff upon arrival, room was very adequate. One thing that I noticed that made no difference in the quality of the location was the poor workmanship in the installation of the towel racks (crooked), sloppy installation of wallpaper (many loose edges/crooked ). I know these items seem and sound petty, but those minor attentions to detail can shape an impression.

<Title>“Excellent location, friendly and helpful staff”
<Content>My husband and I stayed there at the start of our holiday, it's costs but it is worth it. We are going back there for thanksgiving and they helped us with booking a nice restaurant with perfect views. Walking distant to all sights. There is an excellent diner for the best breakfast in town and the most friendly and efficient staff - family owned business I think.

<Title>“Customers From Mars”
<Content>Caveat emptor: the reviews warned me to expect to be over-charged and housed in a noisy, dirty room located on an un-renovated floor. But Doubletree is a Hilton, right? So it could not possibly be as bad as all that. Well, it wasn’t. Quite. The hotel is in a superb, central location. If you like the Upper East Side and the huge range of tempting distractions that will draw you without end along the apparently infinite length of Lexington Avenue, it is just right for you. It’s next door to some of the most expensive hotels in the USA and it is impossible not to experience a frisson of delight at the realization that you are getting the same, or a similar, deal for a fraction of the price. Yet, I found it ironic that everything I had been warned about came to pass. When I checked in I was informed that for my website discounted rate I had booked a room “on a renovation floor.” This meant that the corridors were stripped to bare concrete with the plumbing and wiring exposed and the stimulating scent of wet cement in the air. It hardly mattered. The room was perfectly furnished and finished and you don’t spend much time in a hotel corridor, but they might have said so when I booked. Am I the only person who would not only be undeterred but would leap at a “renovation discount”? To compensate, I was given a free breakfast during each day of my stay, which was very generous, except that it wasn’t free. I was billed for the service fee, which was pretty harmless, but very rude. When I checked out, some intuition, probably planted by the reviews I had hitherto regarded as gratuitously negative, made me check my bill. It just didn’t add up. There was something wrong. By my calculations I could not get within $100 of the total. What with the service fee for breakfast and the various State and City taxes I realised that I might be calculating things incorrectly. I drew up a spreadsheet on my laptop and spent twenty minutes trying to work out where my figures erred. It turned out I had been billed a daily rate considerably in excess of the agreed tariff. This was instantly corrected by the accounts department (well, as instantly as one can be when there is a check-out line of fifteen or sixteen people with the same complaint), without the slightest hesitation, explanation or apology. Could it be that this is a common occurrence, that maybe this hotel rather prefers to wait for customers to complain rather than ensure the accounts are correct before they are handed to the nocturnal visitor who shoves them beneath the crack in the door at 4.45 am? I had had a narrow escape as I do not incur “additional room expenses” and am inclined to pay hotel bills without thinking that they might have overcharged me by almost 100%. The hotel itself is smart, clean and pleasant. The rooms are large, comfortable, four star rooms with large, comfortable beds, large, comfortable bathrooms, pleasant decor and very agreeable staff in whose mouths butter would not melt (but this is part of the charm of Manhattan). Depending on which side of the building you are on it is easy to use the public wireless internet provided by the City of New York (or other less charitable institutions in close proximity) without paying the hotel’s ridiculously high rate for internet access. The breakfast was good but the basement venue was claustrophobic and chaotic and I would not have set foot in it had I had to pay the $20 buffet fee when I could go to any number of nearby diners and have a better breakfast for under $10. Still, the Doubletree Metropolitan was a steal for the discount web rate of $150 per night, and if I had not had the sense that I had survived a pick-pocketing, I would recommend it to anyone. As it is, I recommend it to anyone who is prepared to ignore a concrete lined hotel corridor, who can use a magnifying glass to check their account, and who can apply sufficient assertiveness to demand a substantial refund from a hotel clerk who might be from Venus but who appears to believe that we customers must be treated as though we are from Mars.

<Title>“Fantabulous! - perfect for our anniversary.”
<Content>We booked the Doubletree online. we have stayed in doubletrees before and liked the hotel. reason for doubletree for this weekend was the price - couldnt beat it in Midtown. We were going to see a show and have dinner, so we were only staying for one night. its a lil less than a mile to all the broadway shows so not a big deal walking and my wife was 8 months prego. they upgraded us to a junior suite on the 19th floor which was really nice - i believe it was one of the newly renovated rooms. The room was huge w/ a king bed and a couch and plenty of floor space - something you dont usually get in NY hotels. bed was really comfortable also. the manager even surprised us with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries when we got back to our room. very unexpected, but definitely gives them the WOW factor and a 5 star rating! oh yeah - cant forget the free warm cookie when you check in - nice delicious touch! would defintiely recommend and definitely stay here again for our future NYC visits. my only complaint was the no free internet in our rooms - i think there might have been down in the lobby though.

<Content>The restaurant is only open for breakfast - otherwise only the bar with a very limited menu or room service. No mini-bar so only way to cool items is in the tiny ice bucket. Room was very clean and we enjoyed the PURE air ionizer in our upgrade room. However, because of the lack of a restaurant and other expected amenities we are only grading it average.

<Title>“Lovely lobby but dated rooms"”
<Content>Wasted about an hour at check in trying to find an acceptable room:maybe it was the" Priceline NYOP curse" that sent me to the dungeon but first shown a steamy dingy room with malfunctioing air cond; the next room ac was a bit better but phonewas not working; the 3 rd room bad ac again! Back to the front desk for the fourth time and fortunately this time it was staffed by a lady named Sylvia who listened to my complaints and located a decent functioning room -thank you Sylvia you saved the day and I had a comfortable stay. While I heard that rooms on the 2nd floor and some on the 3rd have been updated none of the rooms I saw appeared to be- with the possibloe exception of the beds . Time for more renovation. What I DID appreciate at the hotel was no nickel diming as local phone calls were free and there is abusiness center with 4 high speed PCs also free for guests' use .

<Title>“Will not get the full NYC experience staying here.....”
<Content>I normally don't write reviews, but I felt like I actually had a lo of pros and cons to share about this hotel. PROS -right across the street from the subway! take the subway people, it will be your best friend. I mastered the subway to anywhere i needed to go. Including battery park to see the statue of liberty. -Housekeeping left a message letting me know when and where i could reach them since i had a "do not disturb sign". Made it very easy to get my room cleaned later. -nice welcome with a cookie, adds a little extra. -Location is close to 5th ave. took minutes to walk to saks, NBA store, gucci... etc -stayed in many NYC hotels... was roomy compared to most -business center... slow computers but printing available... that's expected though -free wireless in lobby only CONS -raining when we got there and bell hop was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND. -went outside later that day asked bell hop to hail a cab... told us very rudely that we were just going to have to wait for a while because he was busy. - front desk ladies... you have some good ones, some bad ones... the ones that work around 10pm were the most crabby and gave short answers... the early morning/day ladies were soo nice and helpful. very very impressed with their service. -WORST THING... THE FEMALE CONCIERGE LADY.... i've never met someone so rude, unhelpful, and annoyed by her job. I refused to go back to her. Such attitude and could offer no advice. - molding in bathroom, tub had cracks and was very old. they mainly need to work on their customer service. It ruins the whole trip having rude people assist you. for the price you pay for the hotel though, it's relatively cheap in NYC standards.... and thats what you get... cheap service if you are absolutely on a budget, stay here. in NY you're out and about most of the time. If you can spare an extra 150 or 200 and upgrade even a little, YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. I guess the only thing i really liked about the hotel was the location to everything... but trust me.... there are other hotels with good locations and better service. For those of you just thinking that I had a bad encounter with the service, trust me, you will feel cheated out of your NYC experience staying at this place.

<Title>“Mold (fixed) and billing dispute (also fixed)”
<Content>It's not a flea bag hotel, but it's also not a grand hotel by any stretch of the imagination. I travel a lot on business. Double Tree is one of the hotels our travel agency puts us in (Marriott is another). When I arrived I was met I was impressed with the staff. Front desk staff and management were very polity and extremely efficient (Marriott can learn from these folks). The floor staff were also polite and extremely diligent (I felt like royalty). Things started to go downhill once I got to my room. I went to take a shower and found the ceiling was covered with black mold. It was disgusting and needless to say a health hazard. I went back to the front desk to request another room. The mid-shift staff were not as polite and competent as the day staff. I was told there were no more rooms and that the earliest someone could come by to "clean the mold" is the next day. Unacceptable. I insisted to speak to a manager, which I guess spooked the desk person who came back and put me in another room. The new room did not have mold. The second problem I ran into was that at check out time, Double Tree charged the wrong credit card. They were supposed to bill our company AMEX (they had the credit card authorization form faxed over - TWICE!). Gross incompetence. I've never had this problem with Marriott. 24 hours after checking out, I'm still playing phone tag with Double Tree Metropolitan staff and Chase bank. I'm hoping to get this all ironed out soon so I can pay my rent. Incredible how someone's incompetence can cause such disruption to someone's finances. Double Tree staff is a mix of fairly competent and helpful (day staff) and grossly incompetent and lazy (evening staff) people. My company has a contract with Double Tree. I intend to file a formal complaint to Double Tree (for the moss problem as well as the billing mistake). Further, I intend to recommend to my company to break their contract and find another hotel that has more competent and diligent staff. Would I recommend Double Tree to a friend? Hard to say. Double Tree is cheap. If you get a room without mold and if Double Tree staff don't make a mistake with your bill, then maybe you won't have a miserable stay. My professional opinion, as a constant business traveler, is to expect a level of incompetence and inconvenience (having to compensate for stupid mistakes). My personal opinion, make sure you double, triple, quadruple check that Double Tree staff have the correct information...because they can (and often do - from what I'm seeing) make very costly mistakes. Marriott is a much more sensible place if you're a business traveler. When your boss sends you on the road to work on a project, the last thing you need is to play "Special Education Teacher" with incompetent Double Tree staff. Don Montalvo, Coppell, TX

<Title>“Location and Comfort”
<Content>This was my first trip to New York City and it was awesome largely because of this hotel. The hotel itself was clean and inviting. The beds were great and the pillows were so nice I wanted to take them home. The rooms are small, as is common in this particular City, but well maintained. The staff was helpful but do not eat breakfast there it was expensive and awful. The food at the hotel bar however was fairly good. But, the best feature about this hotel is its location. The metro/subway is right there so you are only two stops from Central Park and you are a 10-15 minute walk from all the main attractions (Empire State Building, Time Square, Madison Ave, Park Ave etc.). Plus, you have great places close by to dine at and bars/clubs to go to without having to leave this very safe and popular area of the City.

<Title>“Ask if you are in the SMALL or LARGE rooms upon booking.......”
<Content>My Mom, daughter and I stayed here for one week in September, and we booked it on Expedia. The overall experience was average, except for one outstanding employee....he is the evening Manager at Front desk, and his name starts witht the letter T'. He made our trip-he was so helpful in making reservations and getting us directions. His general attentiveness was very much appreciated. Thank you!!! When you are booking this room, be sure to ask for the larger of the 2 double occupancy choices, because there are 2 sizes of rooms, and the one you see on the internet is the BIGGER room. You wouldn't have belived HOW SMALL our room was, In fact we requested a cot prior to our arrival, and it was in the room when we arrived.....I am not kidding, we COULD NOT open it up due to the small size of this room (see the photo I uploaded). Oh ya......ask for a room that faces 51st street, not the back alley. THE restaurant in the hotel is VERY PRICY.....our bill was $90 for three buffet breakfasts.....there is a neat cafe right beside the hotel called CAFE METRO (they are all over Manhatten too), but we could get breakfast there and late night snacks as well, so that was a good thing. The room was cleaned adequately each day, but the decor and overall style of the rooms could use some updating. The beds and pillows are good, but we were so tired at the end of each day, we could have probably slept on the floor. Coffeemakers are available ONLY BY request, so be sure to request one if you are a coffee drinker......ONE issue was the maid forget to provide us with coffee each day, so every night we had to call the front desk for more coffee, so we would have it ready to make in the morning. Finally on the last night, the restaurant manager brought our coffee up, and when he found out we didnt get coffee all week, he gave us 3 breakfast buffet coupons (remember, that's worth $90), so we really appreciated that and we enjoyed a buffert breakfast before leaving for a long day of traveling. Location was good.......the blocks are long but depending on weather its nice to walk so you can see all the shops and cafes along the way. The 'all loops tours' bus stops right on 49th and Lexington, so we used that lots to get back and fourth from Times Square and Broadway shows. Also, there is a subway station on the corner of 51st and Lexington (right beside the hotel). The one on the same side of street as hotel goes all the way downtown (Brookyn Bridge, Canal Street, etc) and the one across the street goes uptown. My recommedation is to get a metrocard of you are using the subway or buses for transportation-you can buy them at each subway station. Hope this was helpful-take care

<Title>“Does the Job”
<Content>I just returned from a weekend stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan NYC for Fashion Night 2010. This trip was very spontaneous and I booked the hotel less than 24 hours before the check-in. I was impressed that the room rate was only $179 which a steal for NYC. Location is great and very easy to drive to with safe parking garages in close proximity. The hotel is very busy and I think that the rooms show the wear of having a constant stream of guests. I don't think that any of the rooms sit empty for an evening. The room was clean and the bed and bathroom linens where good. Once again just a lot of wear shows on the room and it does the purpose of sleeping but not for lingering and hanging out. I did try to nap in the afternoon and I could hear everything going on in the hallway. In any event your in NYC and you shouldn't be napping in the middle of the day. Overall, it serves the purpose and will go back again.

<Title>“great service cant make up for dated hotel”
<Content>Located at 51st and Lex the hotel is ideally located in central Manhattan - when I checked in I was given a room on the 2nd flr which for me was too close to street level and the elevators – I checked out the room – which incidentally was recently remodeled and quite nice – and knew immediately upon entering that it would be too noisy. I went back to the front desk and asked the front desk manager (Sylvia) if I could have another room, preferably one that was on a higher floor and away from the street and Sylvia was exceptionally accommodating - I use the word 'exceptionally' because the lobby was busy and she could easily have told me to ‘take it or leave it’. Instead she patiently looked up another room and generated new key cards for me to go and check the room out before confirming a room switch. She did this for me three, yes three times, each room I had checked was smaller and either had no thermostat control or was just too dated – the first room was a remodel so my expectations had been set with that room, after turning down three rooms I told Sylvia that I would just stay with my first room. She tapped away on her computer and instead of confirming my first room she ‘upgraded’ me to a suite. I told her that she did not have to do that but she insisted on accommodating me. The suite was roomy, it was on the 19th flr, and it had nice bay windows. However – the room had a musty smell to it – not because of poor housekeeping but more so from the sheer age of the room and hotel in general, the windows were big but the street noise still came through quite loudly at night (a police & fire station are located across the street and they use their sirens generously!), the bathroom was old and small and worst of all the thermostat only controlled air conditioning! Of course I did not find this fact out until the temp in the room dropped in the middle of the night & I had to call the front desk to complain – they sent an engineer up who wheeled in a portable radiator and stated that this was the only way to heat the room – since it was a suite it was a larger room and the small radiator took forever to heat the room to an acceptable temp. The housekeeping staff was friendly but oddly none of them respected the ‘do not disturb’ card hung out on the door knob – three separate cleaning staff members knocked on the door through out the next morning to clean the room when I was desperately trying to sleep in. Overall this hotel needs a major remodel – each of the rooms I inspected, including the suite where I stayed, were dated, old and had a musty stink to them. With plenty of less dated competitor hotels in the area they really need to upgrade their rooms – friendly staff, warm cookies, and accommodating customer service are nice to have but they are secondary when it comes down to the basic reason of choosing a comfortable and updated place to stay in Manhattan. I would really give this place 2 ½ stars but the options on this site did not have ½ star options available.

Although we got a double queen bed room but it was very affordable compared to all other rates on the internet. to inform you all, i did call several hotels like, marriot, intercontinental, hampton inn and embassy suites but no one there was really helpful enough. I really cant remember her name but it was sth like supna.I distinctly remember i called her on wednesday. ASK for her and she will help. i am so overwhelmed with gratitude that she made my stay so cozy, that i wanted to drop in some words for her. P.S. Great cookies. Grab some for your kids!!!!

<Title>“Decent, but nothing special”
<Content>For New York and for the price I paid, this was a good hotel but it is nowhere near up to Hilton standards. The Good: Since this is a chain hotel, you see more of the "standard" hotel features that are often lacking in New York hotels in this price range. Staff was attentive and friendly. I was able to check in early which is a big plus. The room was huge by New York standards and relatively clean. The linens and towels were clean and fresh-smelling. The TV was great and the air conditioning was adequate. The lobby has lots of seating, a bar, a restaurant and a gift shop. The internet and printing were free in the business center in the lobby although I had to wait while several young women spent a large amount of time checking everybody's Facebook. Really, you're in New York and you sit around reading Facebook? The Bad: The room was awfully rundown considering that the hotel just underwent renovations. Based on other reviews here, I wonder if people who book through a service such as Priceline or Orbitz get the lower quality rooms. I was on the 2nd floor and the wallpaper was peeling away, the door barely closed (and a metal piece was actually missing - you could see the glue where it was supposed to be!) and the carpet was so worn in the traffic path that you could no longer see the pattern. I was also located just underneath the 3rd floor ice machine and could hear every time someone got ice. I would stay again, but try for a better floor. Skip the hotel restaurant and eat at one of the many places within a block or two. Don't be misled by the nearby subway station. The green line runs infrequently on the weekends and the blue line doesn't stop here at all on weekends. Prepare to walk a bit.

<Title>“Clean and updated business hotel”
<Content>I booked a 8 night stay at Doubletree Metropolitan, New York for a shopping/sightseeing trip to New York City. We were greeted by a kind and polite receptionist on our arrival, and was swiftly processed and upgraded from a queen to a king size room, which was a nice surprise after an 9 hour flight. We got a room on the 6th floor facing 51st street, where a police precinct and fire station is located. The windows seems to be sound isolated, as we didn't hear much noise from the fire trucks, which we heard about once every evening. The room itself was updated with a clean carpet, 32 inch flatscreen TV with several HD channels. The bed was great, and the room service was great. My wife dropped some water on the bathroom floor around the sink, and dried it up with a napkin, which showed no trace of dirt or filth. The room also had an in-room safe, which was large enough to store a 16 inch laptop and a SLR camera in it at once, which was a big plus for us, with all our tourist gear. The location is both good and bad. The good thing is the hotel's location in relation to the Subway. You got easy access to 3 lines, from a subway station that runs beneath the hotel! The bad is that it is a business area, so the choice of food and restaurants are in generel limited to expensive juice bars and cafés. The downsides to this hotel is the expensive WIFI, which runs up to $17 per day. The trick is to go down to the lobby, and log on your computer while down there. You get 1 hour of complimentary highspeed WIFI, when you are in the lobby. You can then bring your computer back to your room, and still use it there! There seem to be no daily limits on the complimentary WIFI, so use it, instead of wasting money on something that's free, if you bother going down to the lobby. Another thing that annoyed us a bit was the late housekeeping in the evening. The maid would at times start to vacuum and clean rooms at around 8 to 9 in the evening, and the room's front door wasn't exactly as soundproof as the windows, so it got a bit annoying at times. Overall though, a great place to stay if you are visiting New York City on business or pleasure. The staff was polite and helpful, and the standard of the room was likewise good. Highly recommended.

<Title>“Excellent Value w/Excellent Location”
<Content>I stayed here for one night while on a business trip to NYC. I've stayed at plenty of Hilton properties in NYC, but this is tops so far. You can't beat the location! Subway stop right outside the door, easy access to LaGuardi or JFK by car. I received a rate on the Hilton website for $149/nt with double hhonors points and a $15 bar credit. I couldn't believe it. I thought it was a joke or that this property had major issues. If I can score a rate under $200 in the future, I will stay here every time. Rooms are nicely updated w/flat screen tv. Didn't feel as cramped as other caliber hotels. My only gripe is that the bathrrom was not totally clean when I arrived. Toilet was not flushed and a dirty towel was hanging on the bathroom door. I'm not going to knock them down for these two oversights by housecleaning, but just wanted to throw it out there. Also, I was double charged for internet service and they did not automatically take off my $15 bar tab. They fixed it at check out, but not something you want to deal with when hurrying to catch a ride tot he airport or if there is a long line at check out. All in all, a great value in NYC with a a great location.

<Title>“It was just ok.”
<Content>When we went to our room the room looked run down. The paint looked like it was chipping and so did the wallpaper. To make matters worse when I went into the bathroom you could tell they didn't clean the tub. There was still hair and the sink and tub and was a odor in the bathroom. I was distgusted. So I went downstairs and told them the problems and they gave us another room. The second room was just ok. Nothing to brag about. It's definitely not a 4 star hotel their claiming it to be. It's a mediocre 3 star hotel. Maybe I would stay here again. It's not a definite.

<Content>We stayed here for a few nights while in NYC. The location was excellent. The service was outstanding - they must have had 5 bellmen for every customer in the lobby. Drinls at the bar were good and priced reasonably for NYC. The room was good - nothing nearly as swanky as the lobby, but a nice updated room with comfortable beds. I will definitely consider this hotel when visiting NYC again.

<Title>“Location was a plus, but the room condition, much to be desired”
<Content>It was my first time at this hotel where my daughter and I stayed for a "girls night out". The negatives: There was a foul odor, like body odor that lingered in one area of the room. I reported it to the cleaning folks on our way out but when we returned it remained. The bathroom door was so swollen we were not able to close it. The bathroom had wall paper peeling off the wall , at least 7 inches long with exposure to the rough drywall behind. We asked if we could leave our luggage for a few hours after check out and they charged $2.00 a bag, regardless of size. ( a lunch bag was charged!) The pluses: Location, nice to be close to the metro, St Patricks, warm cookies (for my 21yr old) Parking validation for $30.00 for 24hr period which is lower than most outside garages. I am not sure if I received a "bad" room since I ordered off priceline. I choice a 3.5 stars out of 4 and this was no where close.

<Title>“Nice room, but nickled and dimed the entire stay”
<Content>This hotel has a very good location and big rooms, especially by New York standards. However, I did not like being charged for extra pillows, not having free internet in my room, and the self park around the corner. What Hilton gives away for no charge at their lower priced hotels, they charge for here. One good thing: the room rate with the free breakfast. Great breakfast buffet with gracious waiters.

<Title>“Nothing Special Here”
<Content>Second trip within a month to this same hotel and I would have to say this is by far nothing special when it comes to hotels. On my first trip I was greeted quickly in the lobby area and provided my room without issue. The room itself was a ADA equipped room as it was the only remaining room with a king size bed in it. This was not such a big deal as I was only staying a single night. Upon going to my room it appears the floor was under renovation which appears from the various reviews on this site is a common thing with this hotel. I then went to the lobby bar for a quick dinner and was pretty much ignored for the first 15 mins while the waiter was off watching the game that was on the tv's even ignoring me waving to him. After finally getting his attention he pleaded that he was not intentionally ignoring me but I did not feel the same. I would expect someone who is there to provide service to actually watch for people coming in and sitting down and paying less attention to the baseball game that is on. To top it off the automatically add a tip to the bill which is pure BS considering the poor service they provide and that i would have to now ask them to remove it if I want that changed putting me in a uncomfortable situation.. I only stayed one night on that visit appears they did not honor my request to have my airlines rewards number added to my room bill. Fast forward 1 month later and I had to return to the same part of the city as last time so I figured I would give this hotel another shot. Again the check in process was quick and efficient and I provided them my rewards details to hopefully get the air miles this time. I was given a room with a king size bed that is not an ADA room and is on the 9th floor looking into the stairwell of the building across from me and has a very odd wet sock like smell to it and appears the cleaning staff use far to much air freshener to try and mask this smell. The room has a so called 'Pure' air cleaner in it and i am not sure what effect if any this will have on the odd smell and I am hoping that while I am down in the same hotel bar as last time the smell will go away. Speaking of the hotel bar I was again ignored by the staff for nearly 10 mins while the bar tender and lone waitress where chatting at the end of the bar with each other. I just do not understand why they can not pay attention to people walking in and sitting down. I would not stay here again if it where not for the arrangement the company I work for has with this hotel. I will make it a point to stay at another hotel outside of the city just to not have to experience this again. I am hoping the stay will be better over the next night..

<Title>“Great Hotel for the No Frills Traveler”
<Content>My husband and I visit NYC at least once a year. We always stay at this hotel because of the great price, the clean rooms, the fabulous location, the amazing staff and the no frills nature of the hotel. We are generally only in the room to shower and sleep so the hotel is great for us. It's clean and the beds are great. Location is walking distance to many attractions and a very convenient location to the subway.

<Content>This hotel is in a great location and is recommended for value and helpfulness of the staff. Our rooms were clean and generously topped up with toiletries. If you are spending your own money, then this is a good place to stay and is fair value for money.Only negative is a lack of coffee/tea making facilities in the rooms and the cafe next door, whilst good is not the cheapest. Noticed that Cathay Pacific use this as a crew hotel. Would book again no problem.

<Title>“Good location and good service. It's like Vegas, especially if you're Gold.”
<Content>Since I'm a Hilton Gold member, I find the Metropolitan as an above average hotel for the the Midtown area. I'm not touting my horn, but I did receive bedside chocolates from turn-down service, check-in treats, daily water bottles, and access to the higher floors. So my review will be somewhat biased. First of all, the hotel's fragrance or overall smell reminds me of MGM Grand in Vegas. I can't put a finger on it, but it reminds me of Vegas every night during my 4 night stay. The overly funky, hip lobby / bar area also reinforces this. The service was great, especially since I lost my key card one night and they helped resolved a business center issue (connectivity) for me another night as well. The bed were quite comfortable (King) and I think they actually had too many bathroom towels and amenities for me. Overall, for the business rate, location to work, and the service, I would rate this as above average. During my stay there were a good mix of international and domestic leisure and business travelers, and all seem quite satisfied from the body language. Keep in mind I received double-points (on top of the bonus as Gold), so this hotel is a good benefit for us Hilton folks.

<Title>“Decent location, reasonable price for NYC, but avoid lobby bar”
<Content>Selected hotel as close to business meetings and very good rate for NYC. Was upgraded to a suite - which was not luxurious, just a bit bigger than normal room. Bathroom felt tight, amenities were nice. Complimentary water replaced daily was nice surprise. Breakfast (included for hilton honors) was good & service there was good. Hotel bar was inexcusably poor service - planned to have light dinner there as arrived about 8:30pm. Only 6 people in bar when I arrived -- two men working & all ignored me & did serve the next 4 people who came in & a guy already there. I tried getting their attention & would look at me & walk away. After 20 minutes I left.

<Title>“A solid 3-star NYC hotel experience”
<Content>My partner and I spent two nights at the DT Metropolitan in late July. Prior to our stay I had previously contacted guest relations about my concerns regarding disruptions to guests from the ongoing construction/renovations in the hotel as well as other concerns I had gleaned from reading recent TripAdvisor reviews. Within a few days, I received a courteous reply from the Guest Relations Manager and contact information for head of housekeeping. I was assured that my stay would be pleasant and enjoyable. We arrived at the hotel shortly after 3:30 p.m. Even though the lobby was very busy, check-in was very efficient and we were in our room very quickly. The room was a pleasant surprise. In an apparent effort to assure that we would have a pleasant experience, the management had upgraded us from an Upper Floor Deluxe Room to a Junior Suite. The DT Metropolitan is already known as having large (for NYC standards) guest rooms for a 3-star hotel (it was built as a 4-star Loew's Hotel). Walking into the Junior Suite was like winning the jackpot. Enormous by NYC standards with two ample closets, it had a pullout sofa bed in the seating area in addition to a very spacious walk-out terrace facing 51st Street. The only thing on the small side was the bathroom (which held the toilet and combo shower/tub)--the sink/vanity is outside the bathroom and was more spacious. Upon returning from a lovely dinner nearby at Brasserie the first night, we entered the room to discover a note left by the GM with a bottle of wine and a cheese and crackers plate. It was an unexpected, pleasant surprise but I suppose the management is really serious about generating positive interest and reports about their property after some negative reports this spring and early summer. I did have a minor gripe about the delivery of the wine and cheese. We had left a do not disturb sign on the door but the sign was apparently ignored. Now, my general critique of this property. Hotel has recently been renovated/"refreshed" but it is difficult to tell what is new on the guest floors and what is legacy. Renovations appear to have been done quickly but not very carefully. Still, hotel is pleasantly appointed for an older 3-star hotel in NYC. I think the 3.5-star rating is pushing the limits a bit. Cleanliness is good, but public areas have high traffic and show it. Buffet breakfast was included in our rate, but otherwise I would not have eaten breakfast at the hotel--it was just adequate in quality and given the price if you had to pay for it, there are much better options in the immediate vicinity. Elevators were usually fairly efficient except for one morning when there appeared to be some sort of event on the penthouse level which tied up all the elevators. HVAC was a little problematic in our particular suite--despite adjusting the thermostat, our unit was constantly running and the room was rather cool (better than the 90 degrees F outside, though!). Validated parking through the hotel is an excellent value for this part of Midtown ($30 for 24 hours with no in/out privileges). Even though we were directly across the street from a fire house and police precinct, up on the 18th floor the noise was not too bad for this part of Manhattan--compared to the even older Radisson Lexington Hotel a few blocks south, noise levels in the room were very acceptable by Midtown Manhattan standards. Most of the staff encountered seemed friendly, helpful and accommodating. My request for an extended checkout to 1 p.m. needed because of a delayed business meeting was met without hesitation. I think high speed internet access was a bit pricey for a hotel at this price point and star-level--charging $14.95-16.95 per 24 hours of access. NYC is a very competitive hotel market. At the time I booked our reservation, the DT Metropolitan was very competitively priced. It's strengths are a good Midtown location for business, large rooms, and an apparent can-do attitude by a good portion of the staff and management. It isn't luxurious but is comfortable for a large, somewhat older hotel in Midtown.

<Title>“Fun hotel in a great location!”
<Content>A wonderful gem in NYC. The staff was very friendly on check-in and a great resource during our stay. The rooms were clean, well-stocked with info on the city, and had great bath products and amenities. When we came back on Friday early evening, the staff was around to welcome us back. The hotel location was perfect...right next to the Green line and a taxi was almost always right in front. The gentlemen who were working the front door and hailing taxis were really nice and quite entertaining (the one time we had to wait, during Thursday rush hour traffic). There were quite a few dining/eating/drinking establishments near the hotel. The area felt pretty safe and it is within walking distance to many businesses and tourist attractions. While we did not get to use the bar or common areas, they always seemed to have a fun crowd and nice atmosphere. At night, there was a security officer checking to make sure only guests were allowed to use the elevators to the guest rooms...noninvasive, yet a nice step towards security. There was a nice mix of what appeared to be business travelers and families. The executive lounge was nicely stocked. The people working the room were nice but when it got a little busy, they seemed a little overwhelmed with things like checking for vouchers and keeping the garbage under control. Outside of this, they did a good job of keeping the food and drinks well stocked and fresh. The hot oatmeal was a nice touch though another hot option would have been nice. Some more options for coffee would also have been nice (flavored creamers, etc.), though certainly not necessary (I usually drink black, but the coffee was a little on the burnt side). Also, it would be nice to have the lounge open during the day with sodas and snacks. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely plan on staying there again on our next trip to the City.

<Title>“Surprisingly nice, comfortable at a great online rate”
<Content>What was formerly the Loew's NY hotel, now the Doubletree, was surprisingly nice. I say "surprisingly" because I was expecting something less comfortable for the $179 price tag--a great deal in midtown Manhattan. The room was small (no suprise there), but filled with all the amenities I needed. The lobby was hip and hustling - just like you'd expect in NYC. Only drawback--the concierge made a BAD suggestion for nearby Italian (San Martine on 49th between Lex & 3rd).

<Title>“Great Hotel with easy access”
<Content>We found this hotel on trip advisor when we decided to go to New York for vacation. We had a room on the 16th floor. Rooms are small, but it is a city/business hotel, and you are not usually in the room a lot. We were there during the heatwave, and were met every afternoon by a smiling face distributing water bottles. Air conditioning worked fine, as we remembered to draw the blinds during the day as we were on the sunny side of the hotel. In room high speed internet was kinda pricey for a business hotel, but wifi in lobby worked great. Room rate included breakfast (as we booked far ahead and this is not offered currently) and buffet was always fresh and hot. I could not rate the athletic facility, as that floor was closed, and we were directed to NYSC across the street.the NYSC is not the "cadillac" of their clubs, as we are BSC members, but someone from doubletree needs to go and see the "view" from one of the treadmills, and see what they are referring their guests to. We wouls stay here again, as well as refer friends from BSC .

<Title>“Excellent Location, Nice Rooms, Friendly Staff”
<Content>My fiancee and I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel from July 9 to 12. It was our first trip to NYC. We arrived to the hotel at 1:30pm and we were able to check in. The front desk was really friendly (btw, the chocolate chip cookies were really good!). The room was clean, and decent size, so it met our expectations. It looked that the room was renovated, it also had an LCD TV (40"?) The cleaning staff was also very good, our room was clean with fresh towels when we came back from our day trips. The best thing in our opinion about this hotel is the location. It is located right next to a subway station (51st and Lex), so it took us 20 min to get to Battery park, 10 min to Central Park. The hotel is also 5-10 min walk to Time Square, 5 min walk to the Rockerfeller Center, 5 min walk to Grand Central. It is also relatively quiet, without much street noises, so we had good sleeps for our long days. We will absolutely return to this hotel.

<Content>Check-In was quick and easy. The lobby is rather on the small side for a hotel of that size making it a bit crowded at times (at least the times I was there). The room itself was absolutely ok, but nothing special. Solid 3 star quality. Very small bathroom with hardly any room to move and acceptable bedding. Overall ok, but nothing to rave about.

<Content>I stayed here this month for ten days with my family (including parents and ourselves over 21). This is a great hotel for families with older children, from teenagers to early twenties. The rooms are basic but very clean and comfortable, all the amenities from toiletries to toilet paper was branded, which was a nice thought. The toiletries provided were vast range even foaming make up remover from Neutrogena! The location is amazing as it is only a few blocks away from blooming dales and Lexington av is full of fun stuff to see and do. We even walked most of the time to times sq etc as it was so central. Good value.

<Title>“Gets the job done”
<Content>This was my first departure since 2003 from the perfect NYC Sofitel for a variety or reasons. I never expected it to compare and at the price it could not. The Doubletree had a comfortable bed, great reliable shower, good guest complimentaries and excellent TV service. In addition I found the staff helpful and the free hallway wifi as good as it gets. The room was clean and well serviced. As such the hotel is ideal for crashing out and the location is ideal not least for being adjacent to a subway station. What it does not offer is a special experience. The rooms are tired and worn out. The fittings are old and have no element of style. Worst of all the air conditioning is inadequate. I had to change rooms for an improved a/c only to discover that it was just as poor. During my stay I had NY friends visit me and they just laughed and asked whether I had become bankrupt. The hotel will not impress any visitors or guests who are there for a special occasion. But it in NYC and most hotels fall below expectations. To the credit of Doubletree they gave me a generous unsolicited credit for the inconvenience of being in a room during the renovation of the floor. So overall it is ideal to stay in while you do other things but definitely not somewhere to be to celebrate.

<Title>“Most comfortable beds ever!”
<Content>Our stay at the Doubletree was wonderful. The staff was attentive, the bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in, the room was large, and the location was great. Overall, a very positive experience and we would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Would never stay here again and would never recommend this hotel to anyone!”
<Content>When we arrived we found the reception area to be quite welcoming, the check in staff seemed friendly so we believed we were in for a good stay, how wrong I was!!! We were allocated room 943, when we arrived in the room, it was absolutely tiny and had a funny aroma about it. There was dust everywhere in the room, the wardrobe/closet was full of dust, the carpet was thick with it, the blinds were filthy. I refused to walk barefoot because the carpet just didn't appear clean. The in room safe did not work, in fairness, security promptly repaired this. The absolute worst of all was when I got into the shower, there was mildew on the surface of the tiles, I initially thought it was a pattern in the tile and thought it unusual, when I rubbed my hand against it, all the mildew came off on my hand, it wasn't between the tiles or along the edges, it was actually on the surface of the tiles, at this stage i had had enough and went to reception to ask for a change of room. Reception informed me that no rooms were available however we would be allocated a new room the next day. Although it went against the grain, we decided to stick it out for one night. I had hoped that the hotel would have sent someone up to clean the room whilst we were out but no, this wasn't to be the case. The next day, we were indeed allocated a new room, this new room was double the size, the bed was much bigger and it was certainly a lot cleaner yet for some reason it did not feel up to the standard I had expected of this hotel. For me it would meet 3 star criteria, absolutely no more than this. I was deeply disappointed in how staff dealt with my complaint and deeply disappointed in the Hilton Brand for presenting this hotel under there name. I would never stay here again and would never recommend it to anyone.

<Title>“Staff tries hard, but Doubletree needs to upgrade”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights, average overall hotel. The hallways are narrow, have a lot of wear and tear, rooms are a bit larger than some NYC hotels in this price range, and the staff are generally very friendly and attentive. We were awakened on a Monday morning at 8 AM with renovation noise either next door, upstairs or both. We were on vacation and wanted to sleep in. It continued to be noisy all day, interfering with my work in the room. I realize they need to do renovations sometime, but no warning and I'm sorry, but 8 AM is still pretty early. The breakfast buffet (included in our room rate) was very good, service very attentive, although they tacked on a modest service charge without notifying us and we had already left a generous tip in cash each day. Overall a good value for the price with good service, but the hotel floor we were on (4th floor) was badly in need of rejuvenation and that rejuvenation ongoing elsewhere was disturbing to guests.

<Title>“Awesome Service Staff”
<Content>We received this room on PriceLine at the DoubleTree. I have a DoubleTree in my town and was impressed with the hotel, so I was looking forward to the stay. We had a great check in. We were told that the hotel was fully sold-out, but that we were getting a room, on a floor that was being renovated, but that the room was already renovated, and for the inconvenience we would be having free breakfast for the weekend. They also stated that if we were not satisfied with the hallway, they would change our room the next day. The room was very clean, however, there were minor issues, scuff marks on the walls, and the AC did not work terribly well. The bathroom had mold however. We called about the AC and mold, and they sent someone immediately up to take care of the AC and stated that we could change rooms in the morning. I was fine with this, as lie I said, the room was very clean, and really that's what I can ask for. The next day, the Assistant Front Office Manager, Tony Cunaj, stated that he had heard about our disservice, and wanted to wow us with a free upgrade to the junior suite with balcony! It was such a delighted treat! The room was extremely spacious, with seating area, and king size bed. It was really such a treat. Now just to talk about the first room. This is a traditional hotel in NYC, the rooms are small. The bathroom is small, can only fit one person comfortably. This did not bother me. This is what I expected. Overall, I have to say, I would recommend this hotel as it was clean, and I was treated like royalty by the staff. They also have amazing parking... $30 a day. The W Hotel next door charged $70 a day for our SUV (needless to say we left our car at the DoubleTree).

<Title>“Felt very taken care of”
<Content>This was a good value for the money. It was a rocky start, however. When I was checked in I found a cockroach in my room. I called the front desk and the manager moved me to another room that was completely fine, and clean. He even had my room comped for the incident. The bathroom in my new room was clean and the place overall was comfortable. The hotel staff overall was very courteous and helpful and I had a pleasent weekend stay going all around town. I even walked to 5th ave and saw all of the beautiful shops lit up!

<Title>“the parking deal is a rip off”
<Content>A $379 rate was posted on the website, bu the rate changed on the second night to $779 and on the third night to $559. The website also offered complimentary parking or breakfast as follows:"ROOM ACCOMMODATIONS PLUS GUESTS CHOICE OF OVERNIGHT PARKING FOR ONE CAR DURING STAY OR FULL AMERICAN BREAKFAST FOR TWO. . THERE ARE NO IN AND OUT PRIVILEGES IF PARKING IS CHOSEN.* GUEST RECEIVES BENEFITS FOR EVERY NIGHT OF STAY " I booked the room, drove to NYC, parked the car in the proper garage and c hecked in. A very nice gal at the desk filled out my complimentary parking voucher and said "hold on to this; it's very valuable". After checking out on the third day, I trundled my bag back to the garage, offered my voucher and parking ticket, and was told there was no free parking. The voucher was only for a discount! The cost of parking was $135 -- but with my voucher, it would only be $105. I paid and vowed to write this review. Otherwise, be aware that the rooms are quite small and that some of the floors have hallways that are in the midst of renovation and that interrnet access will cost your $15 a day - $17 if you upgrade to a higher speed. On balance, not much value for the price

<Title>“Not as nice as one would expect from Doubltree”
<Content>I have nothing but praise for the staff at the Doubletree Metropolitan. I stayed in this hotel for two weeks on business, and they were consistently polite and helpful. That being said, I must say that I was disappointed in the quality of furnishings of the room. It did not meet my expectation based on previous experiences with Doubletree. The decor was outdated, and the furniture was much too large for the room. I would have preferred to do without an armchair in exchange for more floor space. While a small room is to be expected in midtown Manhattan, the large furniture made it difficult to find enough floor space to lay out my suitcase. There was also a large cabinet that must have housed a mini bar at one time. Too bad for me it was now empty, and it didn't provide useful storage. It was just another large useless item in an already small room. Besides that, the decor was a little worn. The wallpaper was coming off of the wall, etc. I do give the hotel high marks on location. The 6 subway line is directly outside the front door.

<Title>“Nice hotel but some rooms have significant construction issues”
<Content>This hotel is a nice hotel. I was impressed with the fast check-in and the newly refurbished lobby. II was excited to see that our room was also recently renovated. Unfortunately, the construction quality was very poor. The pedistal sink in the bathroom was not properly secured and the basin would rock back and forth about 3 inches when bumped. The room door looked as if someone had broken the door to gain access (perhaps an improperly programmed door didn't allow access). The door had since been repaired, but the workmanship was shoddy and the door was loose in the door jam when locked shut. All things considered, there wasn't a single 'deal breaker' that made the hotel unsatisfactory. But, the several small issues made me think that the hotel should do much better -- especially given the price of a Manhattan hotel. I phoned the front desk to ask for another room and was surprised to find out that there was a significant hold to discuss the issue with someone. Eventually, the front desk discussed the issues with me. Since I checked in a little early, they said I would have to wait several hours to see what might be available. She offered a compromise: we will fix the issues that are broken while you are out. I agreed. upon returning from a great night out, we discovered that the room hadn't been touched. It was frustrating, but we stayed in the room anyway as we were tired from staying out late in NYC. Overall, I think that we probably got a dud room in what appears to be a nice hotel. I'd still stay there again, but I'd not be talked into waiting for any repairs while I was out.

<Title>“It took three tries to get me a room that had actually been cleaned.”
<Content>The rooms (all three that I saw) were okay. Reasonably sized for the city. Decent bed and TV. They are a bit run down -- wall paper was peeling in one and the faucet was half off the wall in another. But the big issue was that the first room hadn't been cleaned -- small bits of trash everywhere and full waste cans. So they gave me a different room. It was not only dirty, but seemed like it might have actually been occupied. The third room (from which I type) is okay, particularly for the price ($199...not bad for this area).

<Title>“This was a great place to visit!”
<Content>If you are new to Manhattan, you could do a lot worse than the Doubletree Metropolitan in Manhattan. First of all: The subway system was right out the front door and to the right. Next: The walk to Times Square (not my favorite place, but a must see) was quick and not crowded until actually crossing 5th & 7th avenues. Third: Our trek to Yankee Stadium was easy with the subway system Fourth: SoHo and Chinatown were also easy to find and visit from our place Fifth: The staff (This probably deserves to be number one) was great, helpful and diligent! Sixth: There are so many eating places around that it was hard to choose where to eat!

<Title>“This place sucks and the staff sucks too”
<Content>The hotel is just ok, but totally outdated and the rooms have a weird smell to them. Room and bathroom are tiny. Definitely not a 4 star property and maybe even barely a 3 star. Worst was we were check in for 3 nights, but on the last morning of our stay they started construction replacing the carpet and wall paper on our floor. Yes we got a note telling us about it, and that we could switch rooms the night before, but when I called down to do so they told me since im checking out the next morning it wouldnt be so bad. Which was totally wrong as I was woken up to the sounds of carpet being torn out, hammering, saws blaring and other construction noises, all before 8:00am. Dust and debris came into the room under the door. If they know construction is going on during our stay, why even check us into this room if they know we are staying through this day, they could have easily just checked in people who were staying till the day before in this floor? When we stepped out into the hallway it was just nasty out there, of course the worker all had mask on, but not us obviously. Totally ruined our stay and left us with a bad memory for our last day in NYC. When we complained, not even apology was offered, just a coupon for a free breakfast. I definitely would not recommend this hotel and it totally does not live up to a hilton or doubletree hotel standard. So many better places to stay in NY, definitely not returning here.

<Title>“It was just okay. Certainly not 3 stars or Hilton quality”
<Content>I'm surprised that this is a "Hilton" hotel. The folks at the front desk were not friendly at all & no cookies were handed out (not a big deal still). We weren't surprised at the small room size, but we would have liked if it was cleaner & had at least a refrigerator where we could keep milk for our toddler. We stayed in 927 & the bathroom door had peeling paint; the walls were ugly (with stains or just ugly color choice). The only upside was that Cafe Metro was right next door and we could get a cup of coffee & breakfast there. For our next NYC trip, we'll definitely stay elsewhere even if we have to spend more.

<Title>“Not the best, not the worst”
<Content>This Doubletree property is average at best. Staff with exception of doorman was surly and unhelpful; the room was far from properly cleaned (dirty tissue from previous guest sitting on desktop - not really what I want to walk into; dustbunnies in every corner; windows positively filthy beyond all measure; overall 'feel' to the room like you better sleep on top of the sheets and not under them). It is on a very busy block on the east side (not the greatest of locations for doing business in Manhattan, but not the worst) with FDNY and NYPD right across the street - don't look to get a good night's rest here. The lobby is overcrowded (is this a pilot and flight crew preferred hotel??) and the elevator wait is absurd. On the upside, the rooms are 'large' by NYC hotel standards and coffee service was delivered promptly in the morning. Recommend for one or two nights at best, and only if you can get a discount.

<Title>“excellent hotel in a so-so location”
<Content>This bustling Midtown East hotel is clean and modern, with sleek decor and comfortable furniture. If you have business in the specific area, this hotel would be a great choice. But tourists should understand that, although the hotel is near some great shopping, there is not much else to do in this largely commercial area, particularly at night.

<Title>“You are just part of the fodder of visitors”
<Content>Reception very busy. (used for airline staff a lot) Had to give credit card even though had paind in advance. When I said I would pay for extras by cash they said they still needed it in case I trashed the room- I do not think the recetionist realised what she had said to me. Breakfast in hotel have to queue and no windows. Bar is expensive and very dark. The foyer is usually full of either people waiting to leave or those trying to get free internet connection. They need a lot more chairs. Room was small and badly designed as a large person would not have got to the side of the bed by the window as the access was very narrow. TV was too big for the room. Bathroon OK for occupany by one person but the toiletries were nice. Only got a paper on the first and last day (were the others nicked?) No tea or coffee in the room just 2 glasses and an ice bucket. Lifts were often full and slow to arrive. Costs to store luggage until the transport arrives. The luggage store man will try and con you to have a limo to the airport and quote a cost which is not matched by the driver when he turns up. get yourself a yellow cab- fixed price. Coffee next door at the Metro cafe brighter and better.

<Title>“Good Manhattan hotel”
<Content>This is a good choice in Midtown Manhattan-easy walking distance to museums, right near the subway, close to Grand Central, Rockefeller Center, shopping, Central Park, etc. My room was a bit small (although, perhaps, not by New York standards), with a rather worn carpet and nondescript decor, but the housekeeping was immaculate, the bed was good and had nice bedding (including four soft down pillows), and there was a large flat-screen TV and a desk. I had requested a quiet room, and the hotel obligingly assigned me one that faced the back, which did not get a lot of street noise. This is a well-run hotel. You can pre-order breakfast to be sent to your room up until 2AM t the night before, and mine arrived right on the dot at the hour I had requested. The lobby is cheerful, there is a pleasant bar, and the people at the front desk are very helpful. On the whole, this is not a hotel with a lot of character, but it's clean, reliable and comfortable.

<Content>Stayed for one night. Great midtown location for what I needed. Lobby was nice and had a good vibe. The room was a bit small and dated as noted by others. Paid extra for a high floor room and glad I did. This is right down the street from a police precinct and there were sirens all night. Not nearly as nice as the Doubletree Times Square where I stayed the next week, but not too bad. I'm headed back to this hotel in a few weeks and hoping for a bit better experience at this hotel.

<Content>This was our first visit to NYC, and we cannot wait to go back. We've chosen this hotel as a suggestion of our travel agent and for the price. When we arrived at 1:30 a.m they told us that they didn't have our room available, so they offerred a superior room with a king side bed, awsome! The room was big enough, the bed was very comfortable, big TV, nice bathroom, and the best of all was the location, the subway on the corner. I would only suggest the reception to have international adaptors to charge cell phones, or cameras, I had to buy one, and they're very expensive. I would really recommend this hotel to friends.

<Title>“Fantastic hotel, great location, loved it”
<Content>One of our favourite hotels on our USA trip. The rooms were good size, with everything clean and fresh. The staff were very helpful, sorting us out with trips and taxi's, directions and most importantly - free cookies! What a welcome. Wouldn't suggest having anything from the in-room snack selection - very expensive and looked as though it had been around a long time, but that's standard hotel fare. The bright, modern bathrooms were lovely - all except the loo which was hung on the wall so high I could't sit on it with my feet on the floor. An interesting experience. We were worried about the noise as our room overlooked the police, ambulance and fire service stations, but heard nothing significant during the night at all. Don't know how much it cost us (part of a package and not definined) but we would happily chose this hotel if we went back to New York. The location, directly behind the Waldorf-Astoria and in the heart of it all, was perfect for sightseeing and travelling. A very positive experience.

<Title>“Comfy, conveniently located, and surprisingly reasonable”
<Content>My fiance and I weren't expecting much from our hotel stay at the Doubletree, simply because it was one of the cheapest Manhattan hotels we found for that weekend and our past experiences had taught us that this typically results in claustrophobic, windowless rooms. Which is usually fine since we're just using it as a place to crash anyway, but for the amount of money hotels in Manhattan can get away with charging, one hopes for a bit more. The Doubletree doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside you'll find a comfy lobby, small hotel bar, and all of the expected amenities. The rooms are spacious with big windows and the beds super comfortable. The location is fantastic--you have immediate access to a number of trains right outside the front door, including the E, which will take you across town. It's a relatively quiet area (by NYC standards) at night, aside from the nearby firestation's sirens. Overall, we found that (again, by NYC standards) this hotel was a great value. We'll definitely stay there again!

<Title>“Average and friendly”
<Content>We were greeted by a very friendly receptionist when we checked in.( If you don't like the smell of very strong air freshener that takes your breath away , then please don't stay here!) We were immediately upgraded to a queen size room because our room wasn't avaliable (although we booked 7 months previous). The room was tidy and clean, just very dated. There hairdryer smelt of burning when I went to use it, so I quicky turned it off. They do supply mini toiletries, which is very nice. Towels were changed everyday if left on the floor for the maids. The one thing that spoiled the stay was the fact that our room backed on to the elevator, so you heard it going up and down all night. (very noisy). But as far as hotels go, it was comfy with friendly staff. Also being right in the heart of Manhattan, you really are not going to be staying inside much at all!

<Content>We moved here at the last minute as our first hotel was a disaster. We stayed here for 4 nights. It was a huge success. Rooms were very comfy - fantastic beds (slept like a log every night) good bathrooms (though the plug was a bit dodgy). Spotlessly clean. Huge TV too! The hotel bent over backwards to accommodate us at short notice - not easy as they had to juggle rooms to fit our three teenagers into one room. Not all have room for an extra bed. The rollaway bed was also comfy. Rooms properly air conditioned and very quiet. The front of house staff were charming and helpful - couldn't recommend a place more. Brilliant central position with excellent diner just round the corner where we had breakfast every morning (very authentic). Cookies given to us at checkin were good too! Highly recommended.

<Content>I moved to the Doubletree after a horrendous experience at The Omni Berkshire Place around the corner. For $50 a night less I got a much nicer room, and a MUCH friendlier staff. The room was clean, roomy, had a great view. Good location close to Central Park and 5th Avenue shopping, and central for about anything on Manhattan Island. Overall, a very pleasant stay. I would return and would also recommend to a friend.

<Title>“The location rocked! ...the housekeeping didn't”
<Content>This is an older hotel, but many things have been updated with consideration to style and trend. The elevators, though only two, were sufficient every time our group of 8 came or went. The rooms were spacious enough, the bar area was inviting, the water pressure in the showers was full; my only complaint was the housekeeping staff did not do their job sufficient to my preference. We stayed 4 nights, and nightly we would return to our rooms and our empty, dirty glasses from last night were still piling up on the desk and tables. Our garbage in the bathroom was changed daily, but our garbage in the main sleeping area was changed 1 time (& yes, it was piled up and spilling out...so it was obviously neglected). I started to wonder what we did wrong, because we left a couple bucks the first few nights for the cleaning service but after two nights of sub-par cleaning...we stopped that. We did not complain to the front desk. I guess we had too much to do and too little time to worry about it. Still, it would have been much nicer to come back to a fresh, clean room instead. I would give them another try though, because the location was GREAT for us, and you never know with staff...some people care about the quality of their work, and some don't. It takes all kinds to make this world of ours complete.

<Title>“Doubletree Metropolitan”
<Content>Doubletree Metropolitan Hilton hotel was amaizing,clean, comfortable and has central location. I found it in a web site called lastminutetravel. It is a cool website, were you choose a location and they fit you an hotel by your budget and needs. Since you don't know the name of the hotel untill after the booking, you get price breaking deals. The Hotel was great with Cheap prices.

<Title>“Good location”
<Content>We've stayed at this hotel many times and are generally satisfied with the location, rooms and service. On this trip, though, we felt that the rooms are getting a bit tired. The wallpaper in our room was bubbling and the caulk in the bathtub was discolored and pulling away. Otherwise the room was comfortable and breakfast in the executive lounge was acceptable. On the service side, my partner pulled up in a taxi and the doorman stood and watched while she unloaded. It was only after she was out of the cab that he offered to pull her roller board for her. On checking out the bellman asked if we wanted a cab and offered us a car service instead. It's clear the bellmen are taking a kick-back from the drivers. Because of that we said we would take a cab and it was no better. We were really disturbed to see the cab driver who had been waiting in front of the hotel, pay a bribe to the doorman when he picked us up. It was sleazy and corrupt and marred an otherwise fine stay.

<Title>“Great deal, great hotel. Would definitely go again!”
<Content>I went to the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel from February 19 to the 22nd with my best friend. I had previously been to NYC and stayed at the Hilton on Avenue of the Americas. Unfortunately, the prices were out of my budget and I could not afford to go there. Thankfully, I checked reviews on Trip Advisor and the Metropolitan Doubletree hotel didn't seem too bad. Well lets just say I am quite happy I booked this hotel and at a great deal too. For two nights and three days, the cost of our stay was less than $340 US total for a single room (tax included). Once at the hotel, the man at the front desk insisted that we would not be comfortable and gave us a free upgrade for two queen size beds. The hotel is very clean and our room was as well. The bathroom needed some renovation, as some of the plaster was coming off but nothing major. Staff was extremely nice and very accommodating. I would like to say a huge Thank You to Keith, Kathy and Doron. They were very kind and made our stay even more enjoyable, with always a nice smile and nice suggestions of places to go try. Positives: Very clean (room, hall, lobby) Great staff (Pleasant, accommodating and helpful) Great location (subway right next to the hotel and short walk to Times Square) Recently renovated lobby Negatives Next to a police/fire station. So there is the possibility of hearing sirens. We heard them once or twice only during our stay and nothing at night. To make the hotel smell nice a flowery scent can be smelled throughout the hotel. At times it can be a little strong. Bathroom needed some renovations

<Content>We enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel for people who want a friendly and comfortable hotel with a great location. The room size was excellent by NYC standards, and the price was very reasonable. All the staff we encountered were very welcoming. Thanks in particular to Dennis Jarrin and Martina Cacovic at the front desk.

<Title>“Excellent location. Service and rooms need improvement.”
<Content>A 3 star hotel...PROS: Excellent location (51st/Lexington) at subway line. Walk to park, best restaurants, shopping, etc.....Quick check-in...Very nice waiter @ Met grill (breakfast buffet) Neutrogena bath products. CONS: Noisy and leaking rooms (terrace rooms at a premium price- 18th fl), under minor renovations-sloppy carpet laid, caulking splattered in baths and hallways, wallpaper peeling from walls......VERY unfriendly check-in, tiny bathrooms, unhelpful manager, Paid double the price of the standard room- at time advertised as 400sft on line but was given a 200 sft room. Manager said I was mistaken. Sorry. Unbelievable!! There were regular rooms available for $129/$139. I paid $250! Of course that was for the premium suites. Nothing was ever done. Just very poor customer service all around. I have lived in Manhattan and was very familiar with this area of town. I chose this hotel for its location and discount on its suites. I will not return...

<Title>“Great location, but hotel needs renovations”
<Content>I would like to preface my review by stating I was pleased with the price I paid for this hotel in midtown Manhattan. I used the name your price option on Priceline.com. This hotel's location is excellent! We were only 5 blocks west of Times Square. We were within walking distance to 5th Avenue, Central Park, The NY Public Library, The Empire State Bldg, Grand Central terminal, and so much more. We experienced very helpful staff throughout our stay. Service was quick and with a smile! It was such a pleasure. We were booked into a queen room, and although small, it was quite adequate for me and my daughter. We were pleasantly surprised at the very large flat screen TV in the room and there were ample outlets in the room for charging our various devices. I did feel the room could have been more clean. The tub/shower area had mold stains - this is probably because the hotel is very old, but the grout does need to be replaced as it was chipping and stained which was unsightly. Also, wallpaper was missing and peeling throughout the room and hallways. The mattress seemed to be leaning slightly towards the center which made it somewhat difficult to get comfy, but the room was very quiet - we were not disturbed by any street noises or other guests which was a plus for sure! The room was very warm! Upon inspection of the thermostat I noticed it was turned as warm as it could go, so I turned it to a cooler temp. It didn't seem to cool the room down, so I turned it as cold as it could go and left it there for the duration of our stay. The room finally got comfortable, but something was clearly wrong with the unit, as I had it on 50 degrees and it never got near that. It was chilly wile we were in town, but 80+ degree room temp is too hot even for this Floridian! Although I do feel I received a good price for the location in NYC, I would like to see the rooms and hallways updated like the reception area. The reception area is beautiful! I would recommend this hotel to a friend because of the location and price I received from Priceline.com, but I would have to explain the issues with the hotel so they know what to expect. I did not complain about the problems with my room as I was enjoying my time in the city and didn't want take time away from the short time I had in order to deal with the little inconveniences I was experiencing. I do hope the hotel makes some updates soon, as I would very much like to return and spend more time in New York.

<Title>“Our second stay will be our last”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel once before and had decided that given the convenient location and cleanliness of the hotel, it was a good price for the hotel. Of course, it is a Doubletree, so we did know to come into the situation with lower standards than usual. Our first trip, in 2008, was truly a delight and we were pleasantly surprised by the comfortable beds and new, clean, and modern rooms. However, I cannot say the same for our return to the hotel in March 2010. The King sized bed was worn in the middle, and my husband and I were very uncomfortable. Additionally, the made service was sub-par. We had a leaky faucet. The shower was fickle. The service was mediocre at best. They can dress it up on the website, and have a nice modern lobby, but it's still a Doubletree. I doubt that we will return to this hotel.

<Title>“Hotel excelente”
<Content>We arrived in NY às 06:15 am on Sunday (02/21) and we had no problems at check-in at the hotel in the morning. The same happened to make the check out, we ask to leave at 14h and were treated promptly. The hotel has a cloakroom where we could leave our luggage while we finished the tours around Manhattan. The room has a good size, very comfortable beds. The shower is great. From the concierge to the maid, all hotel employees were very kind and always ready to help us. The location is perfect: the subway stations are on the corner, which facilitated our move to Manhattan. Great delis for breakfast, pharmacies and restaurants nearby. Great hotel.

<Title>“Excellent Service”
<Content>I had two trips to this hotel during the month of Febraury 2010 Febraury 7-10 and Febraury 23-26 both were for business In the first Trip my agency did not complete my travels but Daniel the first person I met when I got to the hotel at 10pm on the 7th, was extremely professional. He went upbove and beyond my expectations. Again, Iwas there on the 23 this time my agency completed my travels but again Danile was extremley professional and the good part was that he remembered me from my previous time. That was a great feeling; your hotel see thousands of patrons a week and for him to remeber me was great. During this time on my floor you had a woman by the name of Carmen she would be there early in the morning taking care of her tasks. I had an incident in my room and she was too excellent. Very helpfull and attentive. My room was clean and stocked during my stay. I will defintley recommend your hotel to all I can. Thanks again for a great stay.

<Title>“Great Location and Great Hotel for the Money”
<Content>My wife and I took our 16 year daughter to New York City recently to see the Tim Burton exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art and stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan right in mid-town Manhattan. We got a great deal on a room with parking for less than $200 an night that was in an excellent location that we could walk to MOMA, Rock Center and Times Square. The rooms were adequate and clean, the hotel had a shop, concierge, a bar, and killer chololate chip cookies at check in. There were plenty of reasonably priced (for NYC) restaurants within a short walk of the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel for value and location that is hard to beat!

<Title>“Great location, wi-fi cafe for non hotel guests, poor service, thin walls,”
<Content>This is the first time I stayed at this hotel. I usually stay at the Hilton Time Square and I would recommend that hotel much more over this. I stayed at this double tree for 4 nights during the Valentine's weekend. it's at excellent location - right next to metro entrances. Lots of convenient stores nearby (CVS, Duane, etc). When I first got into the room, one pillow case had lipstick mark on it (shape of a full pair of lips!). The walls were thin. I was awaken by the noises of the neighboring rooms several times a night. Bathroom was very small - it tried to separate the sink with the tub and the toilet. I used "parts" of the sewing kit and the cleaning lady just stuff it back into the box as if it was new. The cleaning lady did not replace my shower gel, shampoo and conditioner everyday, which I didn't mind. However, I used up my whole bottle of shower gel and I only got replacements of shampoo and conditioner, which I still had them full, unused. I called housekeeping for new shower gel and they just pour in some shower gels into the shower gel bottles for me, which gels still spilled out onto the bottle. Very poor housekeeping service, not to mention the dirty pillow case and the mysterious hair comb I found on the floor on the last day of stay. The hotel lobby is like a public library with free Wi-Fi access. Lots of locals just come in for Wi-fi with their own computers and AC adapters. While hotel guests are charged $14.95/day for Wi-fi. You might as well just pretend to you are a non-hotel guest (who will receive more benefit). I am a Hilton gold member and have breakfast voucher to eat on the 17th floor "executive lounge". The breakfast selection was poor - no hot food at all... the food and drinks (the most basic, coffee) was out almost everyday I went there, and until you complain, otherwise it would not be replaced. This hotel doesn't worth to be considered as a Category 7 hotel in the Hilton scale.

<Content>Stayed here for two nights on business and was very pleased. I had not been able to book a room in the city under $200 for some time! The lobby is nice and cozy with free wireless, so very condusive to busienss travelers. The lounge/bar area in the main lobby gets pretty busy at night. I did not eat or drink here, but the prices were pretty hefty. Service was great, very friendly staff. The rooms are big for New York. We lucked out with a room that was not off a street, so we had no noise at all, expect from the hall a bit. The hotel has a great sized gym too, which was a plus. I would recommend staying here. It is an older hotel that has been renovated, so just don't look too close into any of the corners=)

<Title>“A New York Bargain”
<Content>The Doubletree was well situated in Midtown on the East Side. We stayed one night to attend a family gathering in NYC and were quite happy with the price, the room and the complimentary breakfast. When you can stay at a 3 star hotel in midtown for less than $165 total with tax included along with a free breakfast that is a really good deal. The room was small but nicely furnished and on a high floor (at my request - there is a fire station on the same block). The included breakfast buffet was better than I expected, hot and cold items, all very fresh and plentiful. The next time we need to stay in New York this hotel will be our first choice.

<Title>“Better value elsewhere”
<Content>I stayed here two nights...it took forever to get a room. The room said it was non smoking but smelled of cig smoke and deodorizer. There was only a sheet and light blanket on the bed and the room was cold. I did get an extra blanket the next day which helped. There was no coffee pot and apart from a breakfast spot there was only the lounge which like the gift shop opened whenever they wanted to. Although easy to get around via the subway from this location there isn't much around it for places to eat etc. Basically there was other places in this region for the same price but with better rooms and service. I would recomend you check out other choices in the area!

<Title>“would come back again”
<Content>I flew down to watch the US Open, I normally stay in Flushing to be close to the stadium but I decided to stay in Manhattan this time, and take the subway into Flushing. I thought that the rates were a big high, but I guess I just ended up paying the market rate for a nice hotel located in Manhattan. I really enjoyed my stay at this Doubletree, I love the complimentary chocolate chip cookies. Great room and amenities. Walking distance to just about everything: shopping, restaurants, sights. We got complimentary breakfast at the hotel restaurant, the service was great. I would come back again, though would probably try to shop around some more for better rates rather than booking last minute.

<Content>I read the terrible reviews on this site AFTER I booked the Doubletree on a discount hotel site. Concerned, I called both the vendor and the hotel and couldn't get a refund. I'm glad I didn't because we had a GREAT experience at the Doubletree. I asked for an upgrade to a King room (we didn't reject the small room, just wanted a preferred bed size) at $30 a night - no problem. The room was a good size, clean, the towels were wonderful, and the decor was simple and modern. Staff was pleasant and helpful and the location fantastic.

<Title>“decent hotel, but overpriced and horrrendous service”
<Content>My boyfriend found a sweet deal on priceline.com for $110 a night, not including taxes, for the DoubleTree on Lexington Ave (Midtown East area). Our excitement was short-lived, for as soon as we walked through the entrance, we were met with terrible service. Never once did we observe a greeting or smile from any of the staff. One of the concierge workers in particular was extremely rude and curt. It became quite obvious that the workers there hated their job and perhaps hated life in general. I was furthermore disappointed that this DoubleTree would not provide complimentary travel guide booklets (in fact, it did not even carry any) for its guests. The only complimentary item you can ask for is a chocolate chip walnut cookie, one for each guest, at check-in. But beware, the cookies are of Chips Ahoy quality--not BAD but not amazing either. That said, i gave this hotel 2 stars because the 1. rooms were not that bad and 2. the location was good. Our room was of avg size, relatively clean, and had a comfy bed. The HD flatscreen (complete with many channels) was a positive. Bathroom was an okay for me. 'clean and well stocked with supplies (including Neutrogena bath products, which i appreciated). The bathroom, however, inconveniently only has 1 bar to hang your towels.. so if you are someone who uses all 6 of the towels (2 washcloths, 2 hand towels, 2 bath towels), you will have to create your own towel hanger using a clothes hanger. Bath towels are also incredibly coarse and abrasive. Overall, I still had a good trip, but I DO NOT recommend this hotel for the price it advertises ($200-400). For that price, go to the Carlton on Madison Ave. You'll find an exponentially more worthwhile purchase there.

<Title>“Fantastic! Great staff, very friendly and very helpful. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.”
<Content>Vicki Crichton at the front desk made sure our stay was absolutely fantastic. We asked for non-smoking rooms when we checked in, and she went well beyond taking care of just that. Our room was extra large, the bed was king sized and provided an amazing night's sleep after several long days of walking around the city, and we even got breakfast! Vicki wore a button that said "10," but she's clearly more like a "27!" Julio, the doorman, was also fantastic. We had a bit of trouble with our car from the airport to the hotel, and he got the driver to take us to LGA for the price we had agreed on for the car we reserved rather than the more expensive SUV that arrived. The housekeeping staff was friendly, the bartenders in the lobby bar were friendly, and the entire experience was great.

<Title>“Just Average”
<Content>Booked into this hotel for a special birthday treat for my mothers 80th, unfortunately there was nothing to make it special in anyway. We asked to upgrade our room, as the room we had been given looked out onto a roof with a/c condensers and breeze blocks. This could be arranged and although we would be given a room with a better view it had fewer beds, an additional fold up bed would be supplied at a cost of an extra $100. One of the young girls on reception was lovely and did try to help when I explained the reason for our visit, however one of the senior members of staff who she asked for advice wasn't really interested and we were told because we had already booked in this now wasn't possible. The decor is way past it's sell by date, with peeling wallpaper in the common areas and mis-matched carpets. If you are only using this hotel as 'just a place to sleep' then use it, but if you want anything even a tiny bit special or luxurious then go elsewhere.

<Title>“Ideal for NY”
<Content>We had a great 3 nights city break in NY and the Doubletree is an ideal place to stay. About 6 months ago I looked at cancelling (after reading some of the reviews) but I couldn't without loosing my deposit and I am pleased I didn't. We opted for the upgrade option when you book ($30 or so per night) and we got upgraded on arrival. The room wasn't massive but for us (2 adults and 1 child) was ideal although probably needing some renovation. Staff attititude mixed, some very good, others need an introduction to customer service. Breakfast really good and although in a temporary room was ideal with a good buffet selection and fresh eggs being cooked to order. Best thing is though as others have said is location, it is fantastic.

<Content>This hotel has a brilliant location. We just stayed for two nights, but because of the great location we were able to see a lot and to do a lot of shopping. The room was nice and clean, with a good bed. High-quality tv and good internet access. Staff was mostly friendly and efficient. It is however impossible to buy anything to drink if you arrive at night as we did. I did not feel like going out to get my bottle of water in the middle of the night, so it would be nice to be able to buy some from reception. Would really recommend this hotel if you do not know NYC and need to get around easily.

Best experience was the security maintenance guy, he was really friendly, even after repeated visits to our room as the safe was constantly breaking. He gave us 'local' knowledge of all the best places, the places that 'New Yorkers" and as a travel photographer that was excellent and really appreciated.

Steps away from subway and within walking distance to Rockefeller Center and all the great diners. Room was superb, very clean and yes on the smaller side, but that’s New York for you. Hotel staff was excellent and helped us with all of our requests, even checked our luggage the day we were leaving so that we can go out for lunch. This was the New Year’s weekend and they were extremely busy, yet very courteous and professional. I have stayed at other higher level hotels in New York and they do not compare to room clealiness or staff here. I have had an excellent stay here and will definitely return in future.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel”
<Content>My wife and I just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel and have nothing but good things to say about it. Very Clean rooms and bathrooms. Excellent service from check-in, concierge, hotel staff and cleaning staff. Excellent location-- right next to the E/F/V and 6 trains, where you can go anywhere in the city from there-- We went everywhere!-- top class restaurants, shows, etc.... while making this excellent hotel our hub-- Walking distance to lots of attractions.. but we tookd the train, walked... and did everything! The only low ratings I would give is on Noise-- (not sure if it was cleaning staff or other guests) in the morning, and the neerby firehouse and police station on 51st-- And if I can suggest some improvements, it would be to upgrade or buy new towels and sheets and also to post the weather somewhere so one can plan better (the weather channel was not always on) and the paper was not readily always available.

<Title>“Great View, Great Location, Unfortunate Experience.”
<Content>This is a decent hotel with great location, which is why we stayed here. Unfortunatly, I left a pair of sun glasses in the hotel room and upon returning no body wanted to help out. When I finally got to speak to someone who cared, they said that nothing was found. So from a pretty good experience, it went to a bad one since though this event I got to see the low quality of this hotel's staff.

<Title>“Great Location! Courteous Staff.”
<Content>If you are on a budget and location is very important to you, then this is a good choice. Currently under some cosmetic changes, the Doubletree is a comfortable, no frills place that is a perfect location for major sites and subway access. The rooms are clean and the beds were comfortable. Of course the decor needs updating but i can overlook these things when the staff is friendly, helpful, and services are good. The area of town if perfect for hitting the shops, broadway, rockefeller, etc. and you can catch the subway literally outside the door for ride down to SOHO. To me this was the right kind of hotel for a 3 night getaway, but if you are more into "W" style hotel or Ritz then this may not be for you.

<Title>“Relaxing stay during very busy time of year”
<Content>My husband and I stayed between Christmas and New Year's, although we checked out on Dec. 30th. I wrote a review about this hotel before in 2007 and wanted to update since we decided to stay again. Check in was smooth and everyone was very friendly. We received two warm chocolate chip cookies - which came in handy the next morning when I was starving and needed something! As far as our room, we did not get a free upgrade this time but we had a good room. I had requested a room that was not near the elevator, was on a higher floor and was non-smoking. Also, I did not want to be on the side of the fire station on 51st street. Our room was 1443 and met the criteria. Our view was not particularly exciting, we looked out onto what looked like luxury condos, but it was fine for what we needed. The hotel provided Neutrogena shampoo, conditioner, soaps and lotion. The water pressure was great (i always check that first) and the sinks and tub drained properly. There was some bubbling of the wallpaper near the window but other than that, the room was clean and the bathrooms were very clean. I forgot to take pictures, but the room was similar to my last post in 2007. This time we had a huge wide screen TV which was very different from our last stay. It was fun to watch TV on such a huge screen, it was like being at the movies! I had them bring us a refridgerator to help us store leftovers and drinks. There was no coffee maker in the room, but they provided a hair dryer, iron, ironing board, extra hangers and a safe was in the closet. There was only one chest of four drawers, but we weren't there that long so it was fine. There was also a sitting chair, writing desk with office chair and side table. There are two sets of window shades as well, one to prevent light and one to block out stong sunlight, one of the windows opens about six inches in case you need fresh air. It was warm in the room when we walked in so we changed the thermostat from 72 to 60 and we were comfortable the rest of our stay. The sheets were cotton and soft but the pillow cases did not seem to be all cotton, again this was not a deluxe room. We didn't order from the Met restaurant because I heard that the food wasn't very good and not worth the price. We went to the Oxford Cafe one block down on Lexington. They have all kinds of food, including breakfast, and the food is good quality. They even sell beer! The prices are reasonable, you can get a meal for under $10. If you need to go cheaper, the Metro Cafe is right next door to the hotel. The hotel was in the process of slowly re-doing the the Lobby bar/lounge. They replaced all of the furniture before we left and now have brand new couches, ottomans and chairs - all are the cushy sofa style. We didn't try the bar but it looked nice. My only serious complaint about this hotel is that they use an air freshner/flowery scent and pump it into the Lobby. The scent was so strong that everytime I was in the Lobby or the elevator I began to sneeze! It was really uncomfortable and upon check out I complained about it. I did have a little stuffy nose cold during my stay which did not help, but on my last day there my cold had cleared up and I still sneezed in the lobby. My only other complaint was that they piped-in music in the elevator and the Lobby was cheezy pop music(Brittany Spears, Usher, etc.) that I didn't really care for. It made me think that since this is a "Hilton" hotel that maybe that cheezy Paris Hilton had something to do with that! We checked out at Noon on the 30th but didn't leave NYC until 6pm, so we gave our bags to the hotel to store for us. They store them in a locked room and put numbered tags on each bag. I believe it cost $2 per bag to check them in, and $2 each to check them out. However, they charged us $5 for all 5 bags to check in and $4 to check out. Not sure how that math goes! Anyway, that freed us to head off to lunch and visit a museum before returning to retrieve the bags and head home. By the way, the hotel is located right next to the Green line Metro stop and the blue/Orange line is 1 1/2 blocks up on Lexington. The hotel location is really great, we went to four museums during our trip and took the Metro right on the corner. This was really important because one day it was 20 degrees and it was nice not to have to walk far to the station in the cold. All of the service people were very nice and service was prompt. There was no line when we checked out and everyone seemed like they were genuinely happy to help us regardless of the chaotic pre-new year's crowd.

<Title>“Fine Manhattan Hotel”
<Content>We stayed for five nights at this hotel just before the holidays. We found a great deal on the Doubletree site for $127.20 per night. Yes, the rooms need a makeover. But it really is just superficial. The beds were comfortable, the rooms were clean AND spacious (for NY), and the location cannot be beat! Free wireless in the lobby. Cafe Metro has great coffees, Ess a Bagel is just around the corner, Eggs Travaganza (breakfast cart) is at 52nd/Park for a good/cheap breakfast. CVS and Duane Reade for supplies like water, snacks, etc. are also close by. The subway is just outside. Price and location really can't be beat. We'd definitely return!

<Title>“Complainers read this!”
<Content>I paid $119 a night during the Holidays for a Queen Bedroom. Great room, with everything I need - comfortable bed, huge plasma TV, great shower. Busy lobby (but I'm not sleeping there, right?), great gym (not an exercise room, they have a very nice gym on the second floor!). Subway in front of the hotel, Cafe Metro next door with everything you would like to eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner at very reasonable price (lunch for 3 - salads and subs + drinks - $30). So I wonder why people complain so much about this hotel? If you want luxury in New York you have to pay for it, otherwise enjoy a decent Doubletree hotel in the heart of Manhattan.

<Title>“DISSAPOINTED”
<Content>Where do I start! We had two queen rooms during December 09 and were extremely dissapointed by the hotel, the rooms and the staff. The only pleasant staff were the maids in the morning who always said good morning. The reception staff, the doormen and in particular the conscieges couldn't have been more rude! Not once were we addressed straight away, but left to wait unti it was convenient for them to speak. Unfortunately it wasn't just the odd member of staff we came accross. The hotel is in desperate need of refurbishment, couldn't have a bath - hated standing in the shower then having to use old towels - the only saviing grace are the decent toiletries. The beds were ok, but the pillows were too soft. We wanted to print out our boarding passes and was told it was free, it took $10 to log on and print out the boarding passes. CAN I SUGGEST TO MANAGEMENT THAT THEY GO TO LAS VEGAS TO LEARN WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!!!!

<Title>“Overpriced”
<Content>Compared with many other hotels I have stayed domestically and overseas, this hotel is over-priced. The so-called wireless internet is not free ($14 per day); the restaurant in the hotel charges $30 for each person for the poor-serviced breakfast; the parking is across the street ($30 perday); the front-desk personnel are not customer-oriented. I have to say that I am quite disappointed at choosing this hotel to stay at NY.

Subway right by the hotel for travel to the lower manhattan area . Several restaurants and snack places within easy reach . Cafe Metro i very good next door and Duane reade for snacks and drinks on the move cant be beaten . Services at hotel were excellent . You only had to ask where places were what to do and the lobby staff were a mine of useful info . Got us a town car to go back to the airport at no extra cost . Spot on . rooms were great ..although we didnt spend much time in it . clean tidy and well equipped . Cant praise this hotel enough .

<Title>“Junior suites not worth the money”
<Content>I stayed here for a girls weekend in NYC. The location was fantastic with subways nearby and close to other major points of destination. However, we decided to splurge and stay in a junior suite. It was definitely not worth the money. The room was fairly small for a suite. The bathrooms were teeny. We called several times to get an extra blanket - there were none in the room - before they came up with one. There was no mini-bar. I also heard that the breakfast was awful. I would most likely not stay here again.

<Title>“Can't get much better than this for the price and for New York”
<Content>We stayed for a just a Friday night in October. We paid about $230 including tax (breakfast not included). That's alot of money but then again it was NY and we booked a bit last minute and really didnt have much time to shop around. For the price, it was an excellent stay. 51st/Lex is extremely subway-accessible with connections to the E,V,and 6 and also Grand Central is not far away. The staff was friendly, the room was cleaned extremely well, the view was ok. It was a little noisy with the traffic (I think we were on the 14th floor), but its to be expected. I think there was a gym but not sure. The bed was perfect. The TV was probably a 27 inch flatscreen. Its NY, so the room is going to be small - but we had a great time and it was a great room in one of the best parts of the city.

<Title>“Not worth the money, run down and worn out.”
<Content>Checked in on a Monday evening, put my things away then ran out to dinner, got back looked at the bathroom and was disgusted. wood under the vanity was rotting and falling out, rust surronded the metal underneath the counter. the shower tile grout was covered in black mold. I requested another room, the desk agreed to move my things to another room the next day. When i returned, they didn't move my things but i did get another room. The second bathroom is just as bad: peeling wallpaper, ceiling paint crackled and falling, more mold and hairs on the sink! All this for $420 a night! This gives Hilton a very bad name. No way will my company stay at this overpriced hotel.

<Title>“Solid experience”
<Content>After reading the reviews I almost canceled my reservation at this hotel. I am glad I did not. It is a solid hotel and a decent place to stay -- not the Waldorf, but clearly NOT the worst. It was a good value for the money -- basically it is what you would expect from a Doubletree. You will not be disapointed. The room was quite large and while it needed some updating, was very pleasent. The bed was great. The room was clean. Both VERY high on our priority list of must haves in hotels. We stayed on the 18 floor overlooking the back of the hotel. It was VERY quiet. Make sure you ask for a room on this side of the hotel. My only negative is that the room had a distinct BO smell to it. While the hotel tried to correct the problem the smell lingered until we returned from dinner (almost 6 hours from when we initially asked for the issue to be addressed) The lobby was very busy (and just completed) but we had no trouble getting a taxi. The subway is litterally outside the door of the hotel. We explored Soho on this trip and it was fantastic. It was well worth the trip -- a lot of trendy restaurents and shops.

We found the room comfortable, not large but with plenty of room for the two of us. We have to agree with another reviewer that the room was warm, we just left the window open and did not find the outside noise excessive. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>We had a large group of familes with jump ropers in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Staff got us into rooms after long bus trip and always helped with details. While the hotel is undergoing remodeling (and it is needed as with many NYC hotels), it was clean and comfortable. Internet is free in the lobby and the warm cookies are available all the time as a bonus. It was a very busy time and each person received individual attention and service. Hilton standards, realizing construction was going on, were maintained. Staff was most helpful and took care of our needs and more. New York hotel rooms are small and that is just a fact of life. Clean is important and our group had no complaints.

<Content>I always try and stay in the Hilton chain.. This hotel is old and run down. There was construction taking place on Nov 30, which is probably a good thing.Rooms are really small and they are for sure HOT. In NYC, most hotels turn off the AC for the winter. You have 1 choice, heat or open the window. This can be very noisy with the horn blowing etc..The staff are excellent but the one thing that was very bad was the breakfast....The chef should consider other career options. Being in the restaurant business, I couldn't believe what he put out....Cold and bland......Other wise, the location is great....

<Content>The location of this hotel is excellent if you want to be right in the heart of midtown. the staff is extremely helpful and accomodating. The rooms are on the older side and could use some general redecorating, but they are very clean and extremely spacious by NY standards. This was the 1st time Ive had a hotel room in NYC with my own large and private terrace. I have stayed here before and I will certainly stay here again.

<Title>“Not up to Hilton standards”
<Content>Great location--walking distance to many of Manhattan's great tourist attractions. The warm cookies at check in were nice, however, the service was less than great. Upon entering the lobby with our bags, 6 bellmen stood watching us...no offering to help, no greeting...they were discussing something else amongst themselves. The check in was quick and efficient with very little effort or hospitality put in to it by the gal working the desk. The lobby was under construction, and their bar was a makeshift portable bar with a few tables and chairs surrounding it. No notification of construction when booking the room--a heads up would have been nice. The room was nice and clean, minus some peeling wallpaper in the bathroom. The housekeeping staff was outstanding, very friendly and very willing to go above and beyond. I have stayed in Hilton Hotels many times and have never had this poor of service before. I was very disappointed for the price we paid. I firmly believe that the staff of a hotel makes or breaks your experience there, and this one left a pretty sour taste in my mouth.

<Title>“Neutrogena bath products AND a warm cookie”
<Content>I travel to NYC frequently and lately I've been staying at this hotel for two simple reasons - that warm cookie they hand you when you check in is lovely and I'm a big fan of the Neutrogena bath products, including the face moisturizer so I don't have to bring my own from home. Hotels of a certain class/price level are basically all the same - it's the little touches that distinguish one from the others. So these are the two little touches that keep me coming back. Silly, but there it is! Oh, my one criticism is that the fitness center is too small for a hotel of its size. Both times when I've tried to use it, there haven't been any cardio machines available.

<Content>I was disappointed with this hotel. The location was awesome as you could have walked from there to most of the great sites nearby. The staff were not that friendly, which was a bit of a turn-off. The construction going on in the hotel took away from the ambience and the lobby was always pretty busy since the wifi was free there but not in the rooms. I had to let the water run at a near trickle for it to stay hot, which was annoying. It was an okay stay but for the price, I expected better than okay.

<Title>“Under construction, good location, mediocre hotel”
<Content>I had a short, one night here for business nearby. Check-in was quick, efficient and friendly with the warm cookie offered. The lobby area was under construction as of November 2009 so the hallway to the elevators was very constricted. The "bar" consisted of a few tables and a portable bar shoved into said hallway; congestion was constant in this hallway. Room service & dining hours were restricted due to the renovation, none of which was advertised before arrival. My room on the 10th floor was average size for New York standards, but the bathroom was definitely sub-par. The ceiling paint was peeling and the tub had been worn down to the base metal in places. The bedding & furniture were quality and clean. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. Overall it is fine for a quick trip but should not be near the top of any list.

<Content>My family (2 adults and 2 children) stayed at the hotel for 5 nights. The condition of our room was significantly well below standard for and Hilton hotel brand. Our room was very dirty and dusty, some of the common areas of the hotel were the same, we had a broken closet door in our room, there was mildew in the shower and of the most serious complaint was a SERIOUS infestation of fleas and/or bed bugs. My 2 young children (ages 6 and 9) were crying, itching and are returning home with bites and welts all over their body. We were all miserable for 5 days.We travel extensively for both business and pleasure and have stayed at many other Hilton hotels from Venice Italy to Napa California to South Florida and never in the past have we been so disappointed in our hotel experience. As a result of this hotel stay in New York City, we are seriously considering boycotting ALL future stays at Hilton Hotels.

Best location in town with most of the major banks headquarters at walking distance. 51st St. subway station right beneath the hotel is priceless in cold winters and hot summers. There are plenty of restaurants and cultural attractions in the area. The rooms are comfortable and extremely tidy, spacious and well illuminated. The best thing about the place is its magnificent staff. The lobby team leaded by Mr. Dennis Jarrín is always kind, efficient, and willing to help.

The staff was very helpful, especially Keith Homes from guest services who helped us resolve a small issue with our room. In addition, he went out of his way to make sure that we were satisfied with everything during our stay. Staff personnel like this truly make a difference when traveling.

<Title>“Excellent location but the Hotel needs to be renovated”
<Content>Excellent location, good concept but the rooms need to be renovated: they are just OK for a short stay, but nothing is really enjoyable, the bed is old as well as the carpet (I would not walk barefoot...). There are much better in NYC for that price...

<Title>“Great place to stay with baby and family”
<Content>We spent Christmas here with our 16-month-old, and my mother-in-law got a room down the hall for 2 nights as well. We loved having so much close by - but this was my first time to NYC, so not unique to this hotel I'm sure! A cot was provided for our baby and we were able to tuck her in the corner and not disturb her when we went to bed. There were also blankets so she was warm enough. We faced away from Lex so there was no noise to worry about. The breakfast was great and the concierge gave us good recommendations for places to eat (including Christmas dinner!). Our one complaint was the fridge, how they charged us for taking things out to store our leftovers and babyfood in there; but this was eventually settled on checkout. We also made use of the free Wifi during evenings when our baby was sleeping and we sat in the lobby.

<Title>“Great price for a clean, quiet, comfortable room in this area”
<Content>The Doubletree is a perfectly nice hotel that costs a third or even less than the ritzier hotels that surround it on the Upper East Side. It's definitely not in the same league as, say, the Waldorf, which is down the street, but it was really very pleasant. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the room was reasonably comfy. It wasn't beautifully decorated (some odd lamps, too many bare walls, etc.), but it was clean and not at all dingy. It was also very quiet. Plus, you gotta love being greeted at check-in with a large, warm, delicious chocolate chip cookie for everyone in your party. If you want to stay in this area, and you don't want to spend a fortune, this is a good choice.

<Title>“a good deal”
<Content>We got a great deal on this hotel room - it happened to be an "accessible" room which made the bathroom layout a bit odd, but the room was big, the bed very comfortable, and overall the place was pretty quiet. Location was excellent! We would stay here again, even though the lobby and rest of the place was just so-so.

<Title>“Warm smiles with tasty cookies! :)”
<Content>I have to say i really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Hotel staffs were very friendly and professional. I shared an one queen bedroom with my friend and we were pleased that it was roomy for both of us. What more do you want if you stay in a room that has a comfortable bed, clean bathroom and HDTV with HBO channel? I thought nothing but there is a plus. Perhaps, you should try their yummy chocolate chip cookies! They were like homemade ones that mom would bake. When you check in, they hand out cookies with card keys. How great is that? Hotel manager Dennis Jarrin was kind enough to pack more cookies for my flight home. I highly recommend Doubletree Metropolitan hotel if you want to stay in Midtown Manhattan!

<Title>“Would never stay here again!”
<Content>We stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Sept. 29-Oct.1, 2009. We were disappointed from the moment we walked in the lobby. I had read online that the hotel had been renovated. It must have been back in the 70's. We were greeted and immediately helped by friendly staff. We went to our room and couldn't believe the decor and condition of the room and bathroom. The furnishings, decorations and carpeting were old. The bathroom was tiny; mold on the shower tiles and poorly repaired guages and renovations on the cheap. We looked out the window and only saw a brick wall. If my husband sat in the chair at the desk, I had to climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room. I called down and requested a renovated room. I was told all rooms were renovated at the same time, We were offered a room 2 floors up with the same configuration, but a view of the street, which we accepted in a heartbeat. The room air conditioner was old--a register along the wall. It didn't kick on at night. The only place for free Wi-Fi was in the lobby and it was always crowded and loud. The 2 positives are: staff was friendly and the location was great. It was very noisy from the outside, as well as, people closing doors in the hallway. It was like the doors were being slammed. I think it is because we were in a area were 4 rooms converged and the doors were positioned right next to each other. We would not stay here again. I used to have a positive image of Doubltree Hotels.

<Title>“Terrible Customer Service”
<Content>I have stayed in this hotel for many times, and I didn't have good experience with the hotel staff at all. I always need to wait at the front desk for help not because they are serving other guests but chatting or doing their own business on their front desk. I think many of you know how it felt like after a long haul flight to NY and how desperate to rest on the bed when the room key is not working after check-in. I am not asking the staff to attend my need within one second and I understand they have their business to deal with, but at least they can ask me to wait for a minute instead of just ignoring me. The second thing is that I hope the house keeping staff can keep their noise level down. I know they can't control the noise from the vacuum machine, but please don't yell their voice over the vacuum machine. The last thing that annoys me the most is that one time I try to call a guest in the hotel. I made the call at 1am (eastern time) to the ask the operator to connect my call. The operator replied me, "No!" Then I asked why and she replied, "Ok?" then hanged up. I wonder if she is extremely busy for connect a call at 1am in the morning. If you do have to stay at this hotel, I wish everything is smooth. Otherwise good luck if you need their help for fix something or change something. Good luck if you need to rest during daytime. You will wake up every 10 to 15 minutes by police car, fire truck or other cars honking.

Staff are pleasant and friendly, including the general manager, whose experienced vision of customer service can be felt throughout the hotel. It was a real pleasure staying there and I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Perfect location, helpful staff”
<Content>I stayed at the Metropolitan Doubletree several times during the last year, because our company had an agreement with the hotel. I never really encountered problems when checking in or out and my colleagues and I adore the warm chocolate chip cookies you get, when checking in. The lobby is clean, quite modern with free internet access. I experienced different rooms that were different in size, too. All in all I cannot complain about the bed: it was always clean and good to sleep on. Towels were clean, too and the Neutrogena toiletries highly apreciated. My AC was always working, the only thing missing is a real temperature control. Although I have to admit that the bathrooms are not in the best conditions and that some of the rooms need a refurbishment. At least the room has a new nice TV, a radio where you can connect your MP3 and a safe in the closet (not all hotels provide one!). The gym is quite big and the carpet was lately renewed. But honestly: how much time do you spend in your room, when staying New York? If you want a relaxing or romantic vacation, New York is not the best place to go. ;-) The most important thing when staying in New York is the location! And the location of the Doubletree is excellent. All the major attractions are in walking distance or easily reachable with the metro which is just next to the hotel. My experiences with the staff are good, I always encountered corteous, friendly and professional staff. Especially Dennis Jarrin was very helpful and gave me good advices. I would definitely return to the Doubletree again for a short trip to New York

<Title>“Great and pleasant stay at the DT Metro, bring earplugs just in case...”
<Content>I have to admit I tried rebooking since I was afraid of the bad reviews on the website. Upon walking into the lobby I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby was clean, modern, narrow, something I expect out of a NYC hotel and a Doubletree. I had a great time, check in was easy, with no hassles or long waits. I got to the hotel after traveling awhile and arrived at the hotel before check in time. All of the hotel staff (especially housekeeping, & the bellstaff :<)-thank you) were pleasant and greeted me and my family with smiles and a warm hello. I asked the Concierge (Jennifer) for several different suggestions, which did not disappoint. Britney checked me in and my mother very quickly. I originally booked under a package deal with Expedia (normally I book under hilton honors since I am a member), I was afraid I would be treated with disdain but the complete opposite happened. I booked a queen size bed but asked if I could get doubles instead. Unfortunetely she was unable to do that but upgraded me to a king room and a corner room which allowed for more space. It turned out to be great since my niece and nephew ended up visiting with us for awhile. I did not have breakfast there but opted for daily breakfast runs at the adjacent Metro cafe. I believe it is not affiliated with the hotel. The elevators ran fine and there was never a problem or a long wait for them. The hotel is diagonally across from the Waldorf Astoria, and is next to the subway. I felt very safe especially since there is a fire station and police station on the same block. People complained about the noise but I find that hillarious, you would think you would want to be close to such emergency departments just in case (especially if you are solo and have to go to the atm at night). I brought my earplugs which I really did not need because if you are in nyc you will be walking all over the place or on your feet most of the time so by the time you get back to the hotel you are knocked out anyway. One negative, I did see traces of mold in the shower which I thought was disturbing especially since it was a beautifully remodeled bathroom. In nyc you will see this in many hotels since the buildings are old and there is not adequate air circulation. All in all I would definetely stay here again, the hotel was clean, lively, and happy! Thank you for a wonderful stay.

<Title>“Good Value For Money. Clean. Good Location.”
<Content>Stayed here from the 29th Aug - 1st Sep. Check in was easy and pleasant. Picked up our complimentary cookies which were lovely and warm!. Stayed in room 910 which is on the 9th floor looking out to the Staples shop direct and Subway. Had a King size bed which was very comfortable and the linens were very white and clean. The TV was an L.G LCD HD 40" which was great and had plenty of channels. There was also a desk & computer chair, plus a small sofa in the room. The safe located in the top of the closet worked well but rather small as couldn't fit the laptop in. Plenty of storage for clothes and also empty suitcases. The bathroom sink counter was located in a separate side room to the main bathroom. The bathroom had a bath/shower and toilet all of which worked well and water pressure was good, also there was always hot water available. Although it might not of been the biggest of bathrooms it was just fine and for NY better than what you could possibly get elsewhere. Our floor had a room with an Ice Machine and Vending Machines in it which was handy. Lifts are quick and never have to wait longer than a minute for one. The Internet you have to pay for, but look out for a wireless connection for a local University as you can connect to that for free or you may go down to the lobby to connect for free. We didn't use any of the food services in the hotel so cannot comment on that area but the bar located in the hotel was always full with people so it must be good. Maid service was very efficient, always cleaned at suitable times. We heard the Fire engines a few times during the night but it didn't bother us as we was so tired from walking around NY that we fell back asleep straight away. Checkout was very quick and easy, no added extras on the bill like some hotels try and put on so was very pleased overall.

<Title>“If I knew this was what I was getting for $150, I would have paid $500 to stay somewhere else!”
<Content>We drove up to this hotel and found that they had a garage around the corner that had discounted rates for hotel guests. Since we have an oversized truck they charged us extra- no problem. When we walked into the very small and cramped lobby of this hotel everything looked ok. We didnt know we were in for it until we walked down the corridor to our room. It was a hotel straight out of a B movie where the hotel is dilapidated and everything is old and outdated decor. We got into the room and it went from worse to terrible. Now, keep in mind, when we got this "deal" through priceline, we believed we were getting a 3 1/2 star hotel for $150. We walked in and there was a musty smell right off the bat. We would have gone down and changed the room right there but we were running late for dinner. So we stayed there and surveyed the damage. Bathroom looked like they had a mold infestation. The closet had a musty smell in it which caused me to avoid using it. The rug was torn up in the corners, the wall paper peeling off in corners. The best part was finding someone else's eaten "parfait" ? in the corner of the bathroom. The staff never cleaned it well so there was a nice running chocolate stain running from where the cup and half eaten dessert laid. Baseboard in the bathroom was falling off and thats just the bathroom! The air conditioner was one that you find in a nasty old motel....but OLDER than anything I've seen. Really, I am too tired to go on, but you get the idea of disaster.

<Title>“Great weekend at Doubletree Metro”
<Content>Hubby and I just returned from a weekend at the Doubletree Metropolitan in New York. Our experience was lovely. The location was perfect for us. The only drawback is the fire station across the street. But it never disturbed us. Maybe we lucked out. The room was not huge but big enough. Clean, lovely modern decor. I loved the stainless steel round sink in the bathroom and the contemporary features. The bed was sooooo comfortable with crisp sheets, a pile of feather pillows and a snuggly feather duvet. I turned down the temp in the room so I could use it. We wanted to take the bed - linens, pillows and all - home with us. We arrived early but they had a room available so we didn't have to wait. Everyone was very friendly. We had a drink at the bar. Expensive but a nice spot to relax. We didn't eat in the restaurant so I can't give it a review. The location is just far enough from Times Square to not be in the thick of it but close enough to walk to, as well as walking distance to anything in Midtown. There's a subway entrance right next to the hotel and others very close by. My only complaint was the business center. I went to print out our boarding passes, which you can do for no charge. But the connection is slooooooooowwwwwww. And I had to reset 2 computers just to get one to work right. But it eventually worked so a minor frustration. The room wasn't perfect. The desk had a chip in it. The bathroom is small and someone used too much caulk in there. But those are very minor. The price is reasonable and the bed alone was worth it. We will definitely return to this hotel.

<Title>“Good location, busy and rowdy hotel”
<Content>We stayed here for 2 nights and were overall pleased with our room. Pros: - Close to the subway - Comfortable bed, lots of pillows - Huge flat screen TV with great choice of channels - Lots of mirrors, storage space and desktops/counters - Decor is modern, carpet and bathroom is a bit worn - Front desk and housekeeping staff were friendly and helpful Cons: - Very busy hotel, lobby is always crammed, no system of lining-up for front-desk assistance (I got cut in front of each time I thought I was standing in line), elevators are always full and - Our entire floor reeked of marijuana on a Sunday morning - Not very soundproof, can hear all activity down hallways and car honking and sirens from the street - Bathroom (toilet and tub) does not have a fan, leaving the room very musty and damp feeling, probably the cause of the smell that previous guests have complained about - Sink and vanity are outside of bathroom, but there is no towel bar or place to hang a towel, leaving the space practically useless if someone is in the bathroom - Very little vanity space - Sink splashes very strongly (seems silly, but we all ended up with wet shirts on our first try at washing our hands) Given the price, we would consider staying here again. I'd shop around though first and try and stay out of a less touristy area.

<Content>Really enjoyed my stay here. It is right on the subway line which was extremely convenient. Didn't need much help but the staff was great to get what we did need. We booked a rate to get the complimentary buffet which was very nice to eat at the hotel before we got out since we are early risers. Beverages weren't included in that but coffee was reasonable ( < $2) .. I'd be cautious about whatever price they charge for juice though FYI. The sink area was not in the main shower/toilet area which was nice since it was for a monther/daughter .. wouldn't want to be in the bathroom together. The cookies are awesome as always!!

It was probably decent 20 years ago but today it is dirty and a hotel to avoid. Checked in to hotel; receptionist was very pleasant and welcoming, however, arrived at room to find dirty carpet, old, outdated decor, trash from previous guest in trashcan, lock that didn't work, and terrible airconditioning. it needs a complete overhaul; stay elsewhere.

<Title>“Mold, Trash and Bad Attitudes”
<Content>When I arrived, my room smelled like a teenage boy's locker room. I contacted guest services and was moved and upgraded to a king size room. When I arrived in the new room, the bathroom smelled like mold and urine, the chest of drawers had been pulled away from the wall and a large pile of trash was behind it, the carpet was dirty with crumbs, the shower curtain had visible mold on it. The smell was overpowering. This is all in a room that had been cleaned and was "guest-ready". I paid the $14.95 for the 24-hour wireless internet access. Worked periodically. Not good for a business trip. I contacted the front desk and a nice man, said no problem, if it happens again we'll refund your money. Next morning, it continued to happen. I contacted the front desk again, the man who answered was very rude and informed me they DO NOT give refunds for internet. He checked my account and apparently the man the night before HAD given me a refund. So they DO give refunds on the internet. The bar is tiny. The lobby is constantly filled with teenagers sitting around using the internet. It smells like smoke with people standing one foot from the front door at the smokers "pole". Get the Guest Relations Manager's name-Believe me you'll need it.

<Title>“OK if you're using it as a crash-pad, but don't expect luxury”
<Content>Having already read the reviews, I knew that we weren't in for a 5-star experience, and I would rate this a 3-star hotel based on the room we were allocated. The room was fairly small - even by European standards - and dated. It could do with a refurb to bring it into the 21st century. The bathroom similarly was cramped and dated and could use a new bathroom suite. What added to our woes with the room was the fact that you could hear the aircon unit outside the hotel whirring at all hours, which wasn't entirely conducive to a good night's rest. The public areas of the hotel were good though, the bar is fine, the wi-fi in the reception was well used by us and everyone else there by the looks of things, and the concierge was pleasant and helpful. (That said, the concierge sent us to an Italian restaurant which were looking to close up at 9.30pm - in a city that never sleeps, apparently!) All in all, the hotel is ok if you're looking for somewhere clean to lay your head and freshen up, which is all we wanted it for. But a few small changes to the rooms could make it a nicer place to stay.

<Title>“At that price point, you can do better”
<Content>I stayed 2 nights at the Doubletree in June. The hotel was reasonably priced, but you didn't seem to get much. The rooms were tiny, worn and smelled. Although the lobby appears to be recently renovated, the rooms are in need of a face lift. Depending on the side of the hotel you stay on, the rooms can be extremely loud due to the street traffic. The location of this hotel was great. Close to the subway and within walking distance to restaurants and bars. Although the hotel was reasonably priced, I would think you could pay the same and stay in some place far nicer.

Once when I was out of the room (I know because the person accidentally dropped a hotel employee computer form on the floor) and the second time when I was in the room getting dressed and maintenance tried to come in to fix a service call from a past guest. For this reason only, I would not stay here again.

<Title>“We thought it was very good ...”
<Content>Stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan for one night at the end of June 2009 with my Mother. Managed to get a really good deal by booking direct online and then rechecking weekly until we left for the US - got a twin room, with breakfast for $200 which in the centre of NYC we thought was excellent. Our first impression was excellent, spacious lobby and staff falling over themselves to help, chatty and friendly but professional. Room (two queen beds) on the 19th floor was quite small but very clean with good quality bedding and towels. Free wi-fi internet in the room. Breakfast was excellent - hot and buffet both available - with no request refused. Our luggage was stored for us after we checked out (the cost of $2 per bag was explained upfront) which was very useful as we didn't leave for the airport until late afternoon. All in all an excellent stay.

<Content>The hotel is about two blocks from the Waldorf. The subway is on the same corner. You are within easy walking distance to Times Square, the Theatre, Central Park, etc. Great location. The service was great, the rooms were clean and big enough. For this price, you can't go wrong.

<Title>“Great Staff, Nice Hotel”
<Content>Stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan over July 4th weekend after getting a good rate on the Hilton website (including breakfast) and because of the mid-century modern architecture. The staff was very friendly on check-in, even though we were a couple of hours early they found us an available room. I was also able to get a late check-out without any hassle. Unfortunately, the bathroom in the first room we were given was in very bad shape, so after going back down to the front desk we were moved into a different room. The desk clerk had to speak to a/the manager, who I saw in the front desk area almost every time I went downstairs. He was very gracious, apologized for the bathroom, and even followed up with a phone call once we were in the new room. The rooms are decent size, although I'm not a big fan of the sink being exposed and separate from the shower/toilet. It was obvious that parts of the hotel had been refurbished and other parts had not, as the room and sink area looked new, but the shower area didn't. The location is great for getting the subway (6), and a fairly easy walk to Times Square. But if you want to be right in the "action", this probably isn't the best place to stay. The area is very quiet, although there is a 24 hour CVS a couple of blocks down, not much else is available at night. The lobby is compact, and even though it's a large hotel I rarely saw anyone having to wait at reception. Every single staff member I encountered was extremely nice, and the fresh cookies were an added bonus. The complimentary breakfast buffet was great, and the wait staff there was very cordial, with no one ever put out that we had coupons for the breakfast. You are charged a minimal gratuity to your room if you book with the complimentary breakfast. Would I stay here again? If I got a good rate I definitely would. The hotel is clean, fairly convenient, and the staff is great.

<Title>“This Hotel was ok, but used to be wonderful”
<Content>My wife and i stayed at the DoubleTree Metropolitan in late June 2009 for a couple of nights. We chose this hotel primarily for two reasons: 1) we stayed at this hotel back in 2005 and had a wonderful experience and 2) the price was very good. Although the price was still good, our room was a bit run down. The sheets had stains, our shower had bugs on the walls and there were a few cobwebs and dust balls on the walls. We asked for another room and the staff was very accommodating and gave us another. The 2nd room a little better. But we were only in the room for a short while anyway. The hotel has a nice lobby and happy hour bar. It is about 7 blocks east and 5 block snorth from Times Square. There's plenty of stores located up the street (51st and Lexington). The "New York Lunchenette" is one of our favorite breakfast places and is around the corner on 50th and Lexington. Cab ride from hotel to LGA is about $35 to $40....and to JFK is $45 fixed rate. You can also take the subway for a lot less to either airport, but will have to take the bus part of the way. The staff was very nice and polite. The hotel is close to central park. I think their last renovation was in 2004, so it was practically a brand new hotel on our first visit. I would definitely stay at this hotel again, although i'm sure my wife wouldn't. I don't think the hotel is bad at all for the price we paid. But just beware that if you're looking for a luxurious hotel with plush accommodations, you may not see it at this hotel. Hope this helps.

<Title>“Not too bad”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights over 4th of July Weekend. I booked though a certain low fair website that doesn't show names. It was worth that price, but not much more. Pros: Location - 6 train right outside the door (one stop from Grand Central), E and V trains 2 blocks north. Rockefeller center is a 10 minute walk away. It isn't even too unreasonable to walk to Times Square (although the E train to 42nd street/PABT is faster, but just 4 stops). Rooms: Good size for Manhattan. Private bathroom, but a small one. Parking: Attached garage offers discounted $30/night parking for guests. Just get your Valet ticket stamped at the front desk. Cons: Climate control: Couldn't find a thermostat. Just had a choice of High or Low. Overpriced amenities: Roll away bed for $50/night (glad I bought the air mattress, which the maids were even kind enough to make up every day). Don't even touch the minibar or the stuff they leave set out. There are sensors. Internet would have been an arm and a leg. Fortunately, I could connect to the Cornell Medical School wi-fi from my room. Elevators: In the morning, I had to wait 15 or so minutes before an empty enough elevator made it to the 8th floor to go down. Should have just taken the stairs. A minor inconvenience, but still. I didn't go for room service or anything else, so I won't comment on that. All and all, it's a room that would only cost $90 or less outside the city. Keep that in mind before you pay $180+.

<Title>“mediocre experience at best”
<Content>I would like to begin with the positives which fortunately for us usually involves the people part of the experience . All the staff members we encountered were courteous and helpful. The concierge receives special kudos for not only being helpful and courteous but doing so with humor and aplomb. There alas were several negatives that outweighed the positives of the staff. The air conditioner did not function properly as we needed to have it turned to the full level or the room to be barely tolerableeven at night I t was not really hot yet outside so buyer beware! I can not imagine how scorching it may be when it becomes during a heat wave. Perhaps it will be an experience either resembling purgatory or a sample of hell on earth. But alas that b is not why we go on vacation now is it? The water never became hot either in the sink or the bath when washing. There was no stopper for the drain in the sink so one had to simply waste all the water down the drain when using the sink. Also the hotel engages in deceit to gouge the innocent that would make MADOFF proud! There is a tray in the room that appears to have items that are complimentary such as a bottle of water... However one will soon discover that if you touch any item on the tray for 20 seconds (I am not kidding) you pay $7.00 for each item. Finally if you park in the garage make certain that you have the receipt stamped at the hotel as you will pay the discount rate of $30.00. If you forget to have it stamped you will pay the full price. We ended up paying 440.00 for 2 nights which ironically is considered a bargain to some for NYC. We would rather book a "room" in a suite in Central Park rather than pay that price for the value we received.

<Title>“Pleasnat Stay, Great Location”
<Content>This hotel was a great value and a great location plus it was a really comfortable, clean and pleasant. The rooms were average size. Overall a really nice and pleasant place to stay. It is not over the top service but that is not what is expected at a Doubletree. The staff we encountered were all very accommodating. The woman at check in was very nice and, of course, we got our cookies. Sometimes I think the people who have trouble with the staff in hotels are just not pleasant people to be around. I rarely have trouble with the staff in a hotel and this Doubletree was no exception. Treat people with respect and you get treated with respect. The location at 51st and Lexington is a great mid town location. For the price in New York City ($180 per night on Hilton website), this is a very good hotel.

<Title>“Good value for money”
<Content>I was very anxious about staying here after reading all the comments on tripadvisor. As I was travelling with a bunch of girlfriends from Ireland, who had selected this hotel and paid in full up front with Expedia. On first arrival, the receptionist was not the most friendliest person in the world but did however upgrade my room to a larger one for no extra cost. During my stay all the staff were very friendly and the concierge’s recommendations were excellent. The room decor was a little tired but the bed was comfortable and clean. The room had a flat screen TV. I stayed on the 3rd floor, my friends were all on different floors and we all agreed it could be a little noisy both in the corridors and from the street. I think value for money and the location I would stay here again.

<Title>“Recommended”
<Content>We bought a package deal which included this hotel for a very good value. Being a package deal, I wasn't expecting much - so it was a pleasant surprise to find a hotel with friendly staff and adequate facilities. We were in the 9th floor facing 51th St., and it was a bit noisy, especially the fire station in the next block.It was not noisy enough to trouble us - we slept fine, and the bed was very good. The room was not huge but accommodated two persons with two large pieces of luggage. Room was clean and well maintained, being serviced every day. My only complaint was the cost of WiFi in the room, although there was free access at the lobby. The checkout process was a breeze - no time at all. I would certainly stay here again !

<Title>“Do not stay here!”
<Content>From June 6 through June 8, 2009, I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel in New York, New York. After booking my hotel fare through Priceline, I called the hotel to make a few requests for my two hotel rooms. I asked the reservation attendant if she would include in my reservations that, if possible, I would like two rooms with double beds, views of New York (as this was my first visit to the city), and early check-in. She explained that she could not guarantee any of these requests, but that these types of requests can usually be accomodated. When my traveling companions and I arrived to the hotel on June 6, we were told that the rooms were not ready and that there were no double-bed rooms available. I expressed my disappointment to the front desk attendant, and explained that we had two males and two females in our party (non-couples) that would not feel comfortable sharing a bed. She offered us two cots for the two rooms, for $50 per cot, per night. This would be an additional $200 for our stay. When I asked why the cots were so much more, the front desk clerk merely shrugged her shoulders and did not reply. At this point, I felt that she was being rude, and asked if I could speak to the manager. When the manager came over, he seemed immediately confrontational and hostile. I wanted to tell him that I understood the hotel’s side, but felt upset that I would be charged so much more to keep my companions comfortable. Instead he kept repeating “what do you want me to do about it?” So, I suggested a discounted rate for the cots. He said that he would ask housekeeping if he could discount the rate, but that he wasn’t going to make any promises. At this point, other guests were watching our interaction and I was becoming embarrassed by his demeanor. So, I said that would be fine, and that I would come back in two hours to see if my rooms were ready. When I returned, only one room was ready so all four of us went up to the single room to change for dinner. When we returned from dinner, the desk attendants had switched shifts and we were helped by a different clerk. He told us that there was a double bed available for the second room, which he gave us. On the last day, as I checked out, I asked the clerk if there were any additional charges for the room. She told me that there was an $8 fee for the mini-bar, for an item that I did not purchase. I explained that I did not purchase an item, and she gave me a disbelieving stare. She said that she was going to send someone up to check the mini-bar in the room, to confirm that nothing was missing. I told her that would be fine. She then took the keys from me, told me that she took the charge off the bill, and waived her hand to dismiss me. At this point, I requested a complimentary cookie, because I had not received one during any of my check-ins. She handed me one bag, and then waived her hand a second time to dismiss me. Although I fully understand that my requests were not guaranteed, I don’t feel that I received the customer service that I have come to expect from the Hilton brand. I also found it very disrespectful that during my interactions with the hotel staff, I had the clerks iterate to me (and the manager during the initial confrontation) that I was a “Priceline customer,” as if this had a decidedly negative connotation. Beyond this lack of service, the hotel also had some amenity issues. The first room was directly adjacent to the Fire Department and did not have a cot. The second room also did not have a cot, and smelled like smoke (even though it was on a non-smoking floor). The first bathroom smelled like mildew and the sink would spray water everywhere. The other bathroom had a screw where the handle for the shower faucet should have been. Lastly, when we tried to call for the much-advertised “breakfast, lunch, dinner” room service, we were told that they were not open from 11am until 6pm. Based on the last encounter with management, I chose not to complain in person again, but instead filled out the survey that was left in the room. I dropped the survey off on the morning of my second day, and included my name, address, phone number, and hotel rooms on the card. However, I was never contacted regarding my concerns. Also, the cot situation was never followed up, and it wasn’t until the last day that I was sure I wouldn’t be charged for them.

<Content>This hotel is not up to Doubeltree standards. It must be one of the most rundown ones in the network. It is average at best, stay here for the location only not the rooms. The bathtub looked like it was on its 2nd life and needed to be replaced.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>The Doubletree Metropolitan is ideally located for sightseeing. We walked almost everywhere and we felt safe at all times. The cookies that we receieved on arrival were delicious! The hotel lobby and bar are both modern and there were lots of staff available to help if it was required. No complaints with the room or bathroom and no issues with noise. For a central hotel in Manhattan, it represents value for money.

<Title>“If service and soundproofing are what you are looking for, turn away now”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel for six nights over new years with my girlfriend for her birthday. I had a limousine booked from the airport to the hotel with birthday ballons and everything inside. It was a perfect start to what was supposed to be a romantic getaway. All that ended when we walked in the door of the hotel. On check in we paid cash as we had gotten an excellent exchange rate. Front desk staff did not welcome us, grabbed the money of us and took an extra $300 of us as a security deposit. When I asked why I couldn't use my credit card for that, he would not answer. This meant that we did not have the money for Phantom of the Opera on Broadway. He then threw the cookies down on the desk and broke. The worst thing about this experience was that he ruined the suprise I had for my girlfriend in the room (strawberries and chocolate sauce) The room was very big with large but not too comfortable bed on 14th floor. Location of the hotel was great. Just beside the subway stop. On the first day I rang for extra blankets. These didn't arrive by the next day so on the way out of the hotel to go sightseeing I mentioned it to one of the staff on front desk (Jacinta) She was not helpful at all and quite rude. I was very taken aback by her attitude. She shouted after me as I walked away. When I came back I complained to a supervisor who was very apologetic and said she would sort everything out. That never happened Thoroughly disatisfied, I rang the General Manager who was on holidays, great! I spent three days trying to reach a manager and then on the last night Miguel rang the room and asked what the trouble was. He was very understanding and apologetic and of all the staff that we dealt with, was the only one to actually care about our experience in the hotel. He apologised in person to my girlfriend about the ruined surprise and came to a very generous arrangement with us. This hotel is great for getting around the city for shopping and sight seeing. The rooms were good and the cleaner that we had was very nice and polite. Front Desk staff let this hotel down very badly and we will not be staying in it again. P.S. If you happen to have kids, I hope you are lucky enough to not get a room beside a couple that smoke and who like to stay up late in a loud manner. You will be able to hear everything....to the last detail.

<Title>“Good Location- easy acess to subway, but nothing special”
<Content>This seems to be a busy place so no time for a smile or a friendly welcome here . As is often the case for Honors members there was confusion at check in about my "if available"room upgrade- at check in I was told I was upgraded. After seeing my small allocated room I spoke to another girl at the front desk who advised that I was placed in the wrong room (it was not an upgrade from what I had booked) , given the wrong breakfast voucher etc. The changeover (to a larger room) was apologetic and graceful but a bungle nevertheless -my overall experience with upgrades at Hilton is query everthing! I was on a high floor at the rear facing another building but it was very quiet and comfortable. I had a voucher for a full breakfast in the restaurant and it was standard Doubletree fare. I also saw the Honors floor continental breakfast- very basic, disposable plates- designed for a fast on the run experience. Location is good- you can get around on the subway and their are lots of non touristy places to eat if you walk to 2nd Avenue.Nice flat screen television ,updated room decor. Free wireless in the lobby

<Content>Started here, went to Tribeca Hilton Garden Inn...and came back to this hotel because we preferred it. Excellent staff, did not get the breakfast option on our return and found two great breakfast places over on 3rd...Morning Star and another just a few doors down. Rooms are quiet, beds so comfortable, subway right there, one of our rooms had a bigger bath than the other, but no complaints! Oh, coffee in the room would be nice to get your day going. Internet is only free in lobby which seems silly

<Title>“First visit to New york - good base to work from”
<Content>Overall, the experience of Doubletrees was satisfactory. Nothing special but acceptable. The room was small & clean with a queen bed. We were there to see New york so the room facilities were OK as we were out early and back late. We were on the 5th floor and the side of the hotel we were on faced a sky scraper so we had to look "straight up" to see if it was sunny or cloudy. The hotel was well placed to get about. Situated in uptown Manhattan the hotel was right next to the Metro and 2-3 blocks away from 5th & Maddison Ave. The edge of central park was a 10 minute walk. Be prepared to walk. Comfortable shoes a must. Dont have breakfast in the hotel. Right next door from main entrance is a diner(cant place the name) that serve breakfast, lunch & dinner. Good fresh food at decent prices even at $1.45 to the pound. New york was fantastic. New York in Jan is cold but the queues for the attractions were small. Generally people in the street were very friendly when asking directions or assistance. We found that staff in diners, bars & restaurants were chatty & helpful & gave a good service but we found shop assistants in most shops going through the motions. But the worst were staff on the metro and at the port authority bus station. - public employees.They were either asleep or prentending to be or reading magazines or papers. Trying to get help was like pulling teeth. All these guys need retraining

<Title>“Perfect location and big room”
<Content>We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and this being my 4th time to NY it was the best room for money rate I have encountered so far. The location is perfect to see the Rock and have a short trip down to the Times Square and up to the Central Park. The subway lines directly at hand make for fast and easy travel within Manhattan. The check in was fast and friendly and the concierge helpful in all matters. But the place this hotel stood out was the room. We had a kingsize bed and the room was spacious, quiet and perfectly clean. Especially the size came a bit as a positive surprise. All in all I can easily recommend this hotel for eople who want to have a nice stay in Manhatten which is not too costly. We did not eat in the hotel, just around the corner you have amini market with lots of offerings and genrally NY is so full of nice places to eat I hardly eat in the hotel.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of March 2009. We got an excellent rate for this hotel through hotelpaths so we booked it. We did read some of the other reviews of this hotel so we decided to be prepared for the worse. We had a short wait before we checked in but the front desk was staffed by 4 other people. We were given our room keys and warm cookies. We got to our room, opened the door and there was another guest already in there. She said she had just checked in shortly before us so she rang the front desk and got little satisfaction so we had to return to reception only to have to wait in line again for someone to help us. After a 7 hour flight we could have done without this. When we finally approached the girl at reception and told her our predicament I expected her reaction to me more apologetic. It seems that weren't the only guests with this same problem. We got our new room keys and when we got into the room we checked for the bed bugs that were mentioned in previous Trip Advisor reviews but were glad to see no sign of them! The room was clean. The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was small but clean and had a great shower and we supplied with nice toiletries. This hotel is in an excellent location only 10 mins walk to Times Square. There is a subway next to the hotel which we only used one because everything is in walking distance. They have luggage storage facilities at $2 per bag.

<Title>“GOOD TIMES”
<Content>I read the reveiws before going and so i wasn't expecting much from the Doubletree but you don't spend much time in your hotel in NY anyway. I was so please with what i did get. We checked in to be told that we'd been up graded and given some cookies which after a 7 hour flight and 20min taxi ride was good. The room was big, which i didn't think you got in Manhattan and clean with a very comfy king size bed, with a 40" HD TV, the only down side was there were no tea/coffee making facility. The staff were helpfull when need which wasn't often, i did have a query over the minibar bill, i didn't use it but had some iteams billed for, but once pointed out to the staff they took them of the bill no questions asked. The location is very good, especially if your flying from JFK as the metro on 53rd runs just 2 blocks up from the hotel, also the metro on 51st which is outside the hotel will get up and down Manhattan. Having said that alot of the attractions are with in walking distance. I would stay here again it's not the Plaza but if all you want is a nice room, comfy bed in a good location the Doubletree is a good chocie (for the money)

<Title>“I would not stay here again”
<Content>I picked this particular hotel as it was recommended by a colleague from work. We arrived late in the evening and there was only one staff at reception. We were checked in quickly and went to our rooms. The negative comments about my room was that there were no tea/ coffee making facilities and the paint in the bathroom was peeling off the ceiling. The worst experience of this hotel was with one of the desk staff on the day of check out. I received a room statement for my room although it was addressed to my room the hotel confirmation was not the same as my hotel confirmation number (from my expedia booking) and i was shocked to see that there were so many charges for the mini bar that i went downstairs to reception to explain that there was a mistake as I hadn't used the mini bar at all and that i had been charged for someone elses use. When i went to reception i spoke to Marlyn who asked me if i was checking out i said i would be checking out later on in the morning she said she would deal with it then. At 11.30am my family and i went to check out it wasnt busy in reception and it was Marlyn i spoke to again about the room statement. Her attitude was really poor, she wasn't interested in helping me resolve my problem she asked me if i had moved items around in the mini bar as there was a sensor in there i said no. She did not confirm whether or not these items would be charged to my VISA Card but she told me to ring back in the next few days to check my account or to check my own credit card statement. I felt like i was being dismissed i was getting nowhere with my problem all i could do was to take down the desk clerks name and the time that i checked out. Talking to Marlyn took less than 10 mins - not great customer service. I left the hotel feeling very angry, and worried that i would have to ring my credit card company over the next few days. Next time i visit New York i will not be staying again at this particular hotel. Location wise this hotel was right next to the 51st Number 6 Metro line which was very convenient to visit all the major sites.

<Title>“Everything we needed!”
<Content>My wife and I booked into this hotel for 4 nights to celebrate our first Wedding Anniversary last weekend. We were concerned when we read some of the comments but in our opinion they could not be further form the truth. This hotel has a fantastic location, right at the Metro station from JFK and is decorated in a modern and fresh style. We booked a Standard Queen room and were given a Standard King on arrival. The room had absolutely everything needed including an enormous HD TV! Bathroom nice and clean with good quality toiletries. The bed was excellent and room of a good standard. We chose not to eat in the Hotel as absolutely everything you need is within 15 minutes walk in any direction! You have shopping, dining, drinking and all the sights within a short stroll. One piece of advice is to bring earplugs as it can be quite noisy outside - it is NYC after all and not the fault of the HOtel. I would not hesitate in staying here again.

<Title>“Good Hotel”
<Content>We enjoy our stay at the hotel, the staff is very plesant and have a "can do" atitude like they like to say. The location couldn't be better: you have the 51st metro station right at the hotel exit and you can just walk to several places of interest, like the Rockfeller center or Grand Central. We just had a problem on the first night: they were cleaning the room next to ours on midnight. But we spoked we the reception and never again we hear the same.

<Title>“Great location, average hotel”
<Content>Overall this is a perfectly acceptable hotel in a great location right at the heart of midtown Manhattan. With a subway stop literally outside the door it provides an ideal base for exploring the Big Apple. Unfortunately the decor of the hotel is bland and the rooms basic with perhaps the smallest bathroom I've ever stayed in! Our supposedly "deluxe" room on the 17th floor was really far from deluxe but it was clean and was fine for all the time we spent in it. Staff were friendly and welcoming. Breakfast (which was included in our rate) was a welcome bonus. If you can get a good rate for this hotel it's probably worth taking but there are certainly nicer hotels in the area if you're prepared to spend a bit more.

<Title>“An Average City Hotel”
<Content>Stayed here mid-February 09 for a city break in New York. Firstly the location of this hotel is very, very good. Easily accessible by subway as 51 St/Lexington Ave station (which is served by the E Train which runs to/from JFK Airport) is right outside the main entrance. It's also walking distance from The Rockefeller Center and only a little further to Times Square and Broadway. The reception area of the hotel is attractive and modern, and the reception staff were friendly and efficient in checking us in and out. The signature DoubleTree welcome cookies were an extra treat and very tasty (still warm too)! We were allocated a standard twin room on the sixth floor. The room was an average size for a city hotel and was functional but a little tired in places. Whilst all the surfaces were very clean, it was evident that the furniture was quite worn. There was also some evidence of dampness in some patches on the ceiling by peeling paint, particularly in the bathroom. A picture above one of the beds in the room also had some very minor graffiti written in biro on it. Another minor issue is that whilst we didn't have a problem with traffic noise (our room looked over a quiet side-street), noise does travel inside the building, particularly through the walls from guests in neighbouring rooms or walking past in the corridor. Despite these 'niggles' though, the beds were very comfortable with clean bed linen and nice soft pillows. A review here reports bed-bugs but we never found any during the four nights we stayed there. The bathroom and towels were also clean. The temperature and water pressure in the shower is just right too! The large HD TV in the room was a great bonus, with a reasonable selection of channels. Also liked the 'View on Demand' feature where you could 'rent' movies using the on-screen menus. Only other thing that would have been nice in the room was tea/coffee making facilities, rather than having to go to the cafe outside the hotel to buy it. One other minor complaint was that house-keeping weren't very consistant in their timings. They came every day, but one day our room wasn't serviced until gone 8pm in the evening. Whilst we didn't have dinner in the hotel restaurant, we found that the breakfast buffet was expensive and so only used it on our first morning. However this wasn't a problem, as New York is full of small coffee shops and cafes that serve very nice breakfasts, so you only have to go for a little walk to find something. Lastly, the hotel Concierge were extremely helpful in organising some great activities and entertainment during our stay in New York. So overall I recommend the DoubleTree Metropolitan for business travellers and the tourist who like to go out and explore most of the time who's just looking for a place to sleep. If you like a bit of luxury, this probably isn't for you. It's in a great location and is clean and comfortable. Just needs a lick of paint here and there.

<Title>“Great Location - Good Hotel”
<Content>I stayed here for 3 nights in early March 09. The location is excellent for sightseeing and business. There is a cafeteria next door which is good and adequante. The subway station is almost exactly at the doorstep of the hotel (corner of Lexington Av and 51st Street). Reception staff are efficient and pleasant by NY standards. Internet is free in the lobby and charged at $13.95 per day in the room (broadband cable there is very fast). Rates are quite good at $149 + taxes per night. Rooms were of a fair size for Manhattan. Good clean desk, and a decent bathroom, a large HD LCD screen and plenty of cable channels to choose from. I would recommend this hotel without hesitation to the business traveller who is budget conscious and to a leisure traveller in NY for a good time.

<Title>“Great Location & a lovely hotel.”
<Content>My partner and I stayed in the Doubletree Metro hotel at the beginning of January, the rooms were spacious and clean the location was great only a couple of blocks to the Rockefeller Center. The only thing that spoilt it for me was one of the reception staff, she was quite rude and obnoxious. Apart from that the hotel and location are wonderful and highly recommended.

<Title>“A slightly better then average hotel, great location.”
<Content>I arrived earlier then the 3pm check in and was able to get into a room early. The friendly counter lady moved me from a room on the 2nd floor that faces the noisy street to one on the 7th that faces a quiet alley. I went upstairs and ate my delicious warm signature welcome cookie. The room was nice enough. Clean and well situated. I noticed that the chain lock plate on my door was installed backwards, ie. ineffective (ineffective when installed correctly too). Unfortunately, there was this tumbling, knocking noise that seemed to be from the room next door (but wasn't) that began at about 8am and ended at midnight each day. Laundry chute? You will hear every whisper/drunken rant from the hallway. Some guests feel the need to talk loudly at 3am. Uh. The door also lets in quite a bit of light when closed so plan to use some extra towels if you want a good nights sleep. Even then the rooms are too bright IMO. This hotel has been renovated but it still shows it's age in its doors, beds and some carpeted areas. The beds are lumpy but soft and they are the type that you can "sink into", which I like. If you like firm, go somewhere else. There are no blankets so turn up your heat on cold nights. Beware the minibar. It actually has a first aid kit for $8! BYOB, bring your own band aids! The shower was hot and had great water pressure. Plenty of towels and good quality freebies (shampoo, soup, etc.). The toilets have a rocket powered, loud flush. The toilet paper is very cheap, one ply. The sink is powerful and you will get water all over until you get the hang of it. The closet is large and had enough wooden hangers for two people, also a safe that I didn't use. Their is a charge for net access from your room but wifi is free in the lobby. Every hour of everyday, you'll find folks with their laptops in the lobby, clicking away. The decor is modern but not overly so. Better then average hotel art adorns the walls. The palette of the rooms and hallways are nice on the eyes. The tv does not give you listings, only channels (We, MTV, etc). To find out what is actually on, you have to flip using the worn remote. I had to mash the buttons to get it to work well. Lots of news (loud talking head) channels. I did not eat at the hotel. I did notice that the bar is fairly busy in the evenings (you have to walk by it to get to the elevators). The location is right at the 51st street subway exit. A very good and convenient location for midtown travelers. The restaurants around this area are overpriced however, bring a good guide book, check the local websites and find other eateries elsewhere (west 50's is a good spot). The exception is Ess-a-bagel which is right around the corner. You must go there and enjoy their large, yummy bagels. The doormen are quick for their tips. The hotel will store your luggage for free when you arrive (which I didn't have to do but had inquired about before traveling) but they charge you $1 per bag to store and then $1 per bag to retrieve once you check out. Talk about nickel and diming you. When no one was available to retrieve our bags from the unsecured room, we got them ourselves. I noticed a bellhop began a mini-sprint to us once he saw us exit with our bags. He stopped short realizing he had missed his chance for $2. You should tip a min. $1 per bag, per handling and I certainly tip but an outright fee is silly. The fee could be due to cheapskate who don't tip. First rule of traveling/eating out, if you can't afford a tip, don't go out. This is a good hotel for those who get out of their room and explore, getting so much exercise that they can sleep through the noise. That is fairly general for all midtown NYC hotels... if you aren't accustomed to urban noise at night. If you are looking for an upscale place, this isn't it. If you like to hang out in your room and luxuriate, this isn't it. Doubletree Metropolitan is just above average in my opinion and has its pros and cons. I had a nice stay and would consider them again for the right price.

<Title>“Stay here if you like to sleep with bed bugs”
<Content>I am originally from Southern CA, but currently live in Texas, where most people are genuinely a little nicer. When I checked into my hotel, I disregarded the girl at the front desk's (Tina) unfriendly welcome as just the "NYC attitude" when she slammed down 2 bags of warm DoubleTree cookies on the counter. I shrugged it off because I was here on vacation, and nothing was going to spoil my optimism to explore this great city. Upon entering, the room was a bit smaller than expected from the pictures online. Again, I overlooked this inconvenience as another NYC characteristic. I noticed automatically that the sink and bathroom countertops were not clean. After several attempts to connect to the internet, which is $13.95/day for wifi service that is slower than dial-up, my room was charged every time I signed on regardless of the daily rate. The hotel said it was a "system glitch." I stayed for a total of 3 nights. On the 2nd morning, I found one small bug on my pillow. I thought, "Hmm, maybe it's just a random bug that got lost." The next morning, my friend and I found 4 more bugs that were significantly larger than the one from the day before. They were roaming on the bed, underneath the covers. The manager of the hotel said it's a big problem for NYC, and it happens everywhere. The Director of Operations blamed it on the European tourists. They shrugged it off like it was not a big deal, but I'd like to see them roll around with a bunch of bed bugs for a few nights. I had higher standards for a DoubleTree hotel. Don't stay here unless you want the bed bugs to bite. The only pro was that it was convenient to catch the subway on Lexington. There are plenty of other hotels along Lexington to accommodate this need.

<Title>“Not Great by any means”
<Content>The lobby and hotel exterior are what you'd expect from a Hilton, the room itself was very poor. The first room we were given was on the first floor and was mouldy, damp and smelt musty, it also looked like it hadn't been decorated for a few decades and I was pretty unhappy. I asked for a switch on the basis of the damp and was switched to a room on the executive floor (17th) by helpful and pleasant staff. This room was exactly the same in layout, size and decor and far from execituve but this time clean and with a slightly bigger bed. I was just happy I didnt have to put up with damp/mould. We decided to live with its average offerings but then got frustrated that you could hear everything from your neighbouring rooms including their wake up calls. I would avoid this hotel at all costs unless the quality of room or noise is not important. On a plus side the staff and location were spot on.

<Title>“Great Location,”
<Content>We stayed over the Christmas period with our two teenage children 16 and 18. We had 2 rooms, the rooms were tidy and comfortable with nice bathrooms. The location was great within walking distance to 5th Avenue and Broadway. The only down side was the inadequate lobby space, we were part of a bigger group and the lobby was so small that it got very crowded when waiting to meet up.

<Title>“Good”
<Content>Excellent location right next to subway and Metro Deli. Nice staff, adequate room, good comfortable bed. Coffee maker in room would have been nice. The big negative was the bathroom - musty, moldy smell and cheap, thin plastic toilet seat. Evidently some attempt had been made to redo the bathroom areas because there was lovely tile which was in direct contrast to the peeling and chipped paint and a door that had obviously been recylcled. The sink area is separate, also new and 'trendy' - but with NO towel rail or hook and nowhere to set makeup, toiletries, toothbrush etc. Our room was on the 3rd floor on the corner and while street noise was obvious it didn't bother us. Some may find it too noisy.

<Title>“OK, but don't expect too much”
<Content>Stayed for 1 night. Not the cleanest place, although the filth isn't that which would deter such a quick stay-- the lobby, for one, needs improvements to the dinged up, worn and dirty furniture. The room was seemed cleaner than the lobby by far, and was OK on comfort but nothing exceptional... definitely only what the price tag of the stay reflects: bed sheets feel cheap and scratchy, but pillows were decent. Horribly busy firehouse across the street from the even-numbered rooms, and the there was only an option for heat & no fan setting on the thermostat- which meant we had to sleep with the noise of the firehouse from a cracked window in order to avoid sweating to death. Staff friendly, although a simple concern was transfered on the telephone *seven* times. They also try to rip your bill for the MiniBar- I accidentally nudged the sensor-protected shelf of goodies with my hand and the next day had $18.oo worth of charges for food/drink not consumed- they took care of this, though not very willingly. Internet access in room wouldn't work.

<Title>“Good location for shopping/sights”
<Content>Stayed here with my partner 24th - 28th Jan 09, prompt check-in and free warm cookies from reception, 4 lifts available up to the floors, initially we were upgraded to a King Size room on the 2nd floor, it was on the corner of Lexington Avenue and 51st Street, the room appeared great until we went to bed and realised that the sheets and bedding were from the previous guest. I phoned down to reception and spoke with the manager who promptly sent the head of house keeping up to our room and also arranged for us to be relocated to another room which was on the 16th floor; again the room was spacious and clean (see pics). The bed was really big and comfortable, in the room there was an iron and ironing board, safe (free) hair dryer and large TV available. In the bathroom there are Neutrogena products (shampoo, condition, soap and moisturiser). Although a refrigerated mini bar and snack bar is available it is at a cost and if you move a product, you have between 15-30 seconds (depending on the settings) to replace it otherwise you'll be automatically charged. There is internet available in the room but it is pricey, to combat this if you go to reception and ask for internet access they will give you an access code and you can use the internet in reception and best of all it's free, ideal as I used it to confirm my flight back home and pick my seats. There is a gift shop within the hotel and a restaurant and bar which seemed busy every night we were there. The gym is location on the 2nd floor. A metro is located right next to the hotel. To walk to Times Square took us about 15-20 mins (depending on how cold it was) Rockefeller Centre was about 5-10 mins walk, 5th Avenue is about the same (for Tiffany’s, Louis Vuitton, Abercrombie etc). Overall good hotel and location, friendly staff and always helpful. Would I stay here again? Yes.

<Title>“Great all the way around”
<Content>My girlfriend and I went to New York City to see a play. I chose the Doubletree, first, for its proximity to the theater, and second, it received overall good reviews on Trip Advisor. We flew in to La Guardia $35 cab ride to the hotel. We had "carry on" size luggage so the bellman never even approached us - I prefer to deal with my own luggage. This trip was a rewards certificate from Hitlon Honors 80,000 points for two nights. Kathy M at the front desk was super nice and honored my request of a high floor (#1604). I'm just a traveling country boy so I thought the lobby looked nice, never crowded but it was Super Bowl Sunday. The Hotel Bar "The Met" was bad on so many levels. I went in one night and Abdul the bartender was so engrossed in TV he didn't notice me for several minutes. A Guinness and another beer was $13 + tip.. The decor in the bar was a hodge podge of a 70's flea market.. It seemed dirty lots of food crumbs on the floor and hardly any customers. The Staff from the maid to an Assistant Manager were friendly - I was shocked that the maids in the hall went out of their way to greet you. My one issue was in my opinion being lied to or at least misled by a female Concierge. Upon arrival we asked about going to the Statue of Liberty she tried to dissuade me by saying it would be too crowded on the normal ferries. She was much too quick in whipping out a private cruise boat and trying to get me on their cruise. I opted to go to Battery Park and check it out for myself -no lines quick to get tickets, quick to get on the ferry and off we went. The rooms are small but functional, the beds were great and did not get too much street noise. theres is no coffee service in the room. As Hilton Honor members we got a certificate to go to the 17th floor for breakfast. It was nice mainly carbohydrate type breakfast, muffins, fruit, cereals, etc. Sunday morning that was closed and the front desk gave us vouchers to eat in the restaurant. Those guys were amazing the way they moved people around all with a good sense of humor - it was a complete hot breakfast. Pros: Nice location, friendly staff, great beds Cons: Concierge misleading us; hotel bar is nasty I'd stay here again

<Title>“NYC2009”
<Content>After checking previous reviews, I was a bit worried about the room condition, but when I actually checked in on 1/25, all my concerns vanished. The room was tiny (we stayed for only one night, so it did not bother us) but clean. The furniture also looked very new and pleasant (I guess some guests were unlucky to get non- renovated rooms, so they felt the rooms were worn). The bed was comfortable, and the shower and everything else in the room functioned properly. Besides, there were several lamps in the room, so it was very bright, which was really a plus. We chose this hotel because of the good location and the cheap price, and we did not have anything to complain about.

<Title>“Bait and Switch! I Won't Be Back!”
<Content>While the exterior and lobby suggest a spiffy new image from this hotel, it's more like a classic bait and switch scam. While this hotel previousl offered a full array of services, they no longer even offer room service available during the day. Can't even get a pot of coffee sent up to your room! And the restaurant is also open every now and then. When I called to complain, the general manager never returned my call. When I again called to discuss the issue, the manager on duty explained to me with great sarchasm that "life is full of disappointments." I won't be back and suggest that there are many, many superior hotels in New York within this price range.

<Title>“Good location, amenities, reasonable price”
<Content>Have stayed here several times before, and it's gotten better. Rooms are updated if a little smallish (but typical of Manhattan), with a giant flat screen HDTV, comfortable bed, clean bathroom. Excellent location in midtown. Good place for breakfast right next door. Staff is pleasant. Free wifi in lobby, $14 in rooms (the nickel and diming of which I detest). No coffee maker in rooms, but a minibar if you want to pay the prices. Otherwise, not a bad choice and you do get a chocolate chip cookie upon check-in as is Doubletree's promise.

<Title>“There are better hotels in New York”
<Content>This must be one off the bad Doubletree Hotels, The rooms are very small and stuffy, The bathroom is tiny, the sink is in the bedroom rather than the bathroom, No tea/Coffee maker due to the fact " the guests keep stealing them so they have taken them out" quote from the front desk. The careline staff are great and very customer focused, the front desk staff are ok with the exception of a few who should not be in the service industry! lack of interest and rude. Breakfast is not great and you will get better in he deli next door for half the price, Mostly dried up and greasy left in dishes too long. Lots of managers around but no one seems to take charge and hence very bad are getting checked in and out. If you get a good deal you can put up with the faults, but they would need to make big changes as there are much much better hotels for the same value.

<Title>“Enjoyable”
<Content>My partner and I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in January. We were upgraded to a king room, which was greatly appreciated! I had no complaints about the room, it was cleaned thoroughly every day, sheets changed as often as you wanted. The bed was extremely comfortable, and there was a nice big tv (not that you're going to be watching too much tv when you're in New York!!) We were on the 15th floor, and yes, there was a fire station across the road which could be quite noisy - but really not a big deal! We never had to wait long for the lifts, and they moved quite fast, so again no complaints there. Most of the staff were very friendly and we found the concierge very helpful. The location was great - 5th Avenue, Times Sq. Rockerfeller, Central Park, St. Patrick's all within easy walking distance - but the subway is extremely convenient (right outside the door) very easy to use, and very reasonable...try to get a map early on, and familiarise yourself with it! The only real complaints that I had about the hotel were that there were no tea and coffee making facilities in the room (or even in the lobby), after a long day of sightseeing, it would have been very welcome. My other complaint is that if you wanted to store your luggage, not only did you have to pay a dollar to leave each bag in - you had to pay another dollar to take each bag out!! Why did they not just charge $2 per bag??? This to me was a matter of principle, after staying 5 nights at the hotel, I felt it was a bit cheeky! In all though - I had gotten a very good rate on the room, and felt that it was well worth what we paid, I would consider going back there if I'm lucky enough to get back to New York.

<Title>“Just a hotel after all.”
<Content>Price wise is the chepest you can get for this class in the downtown core. Staff wise, they are friendly enough to upgrade me to a better room after my complain. is clean, the location is excellent, price is reasonable, it got everything with the exception of free wifi. Pros: - Reasonable Price for the area - excellent location (right next to 52nd st subway station) - friendly staffs (most of them) - room clean and tidy Cons: - even on 14th floor (where my room was located), street traffic can be very loud, loud enough to affect sleeping quality. Police Station is right next to it, you can hear cops cars go by every hour. - I don't know who designed the doors, but whenever someone is closing the door, it creates a LOUD bang. very annoying. - if you're staying at the lower floors, rooms are very small. (but i wasn't) - lobby are often over crowded with people. - terrible restaurant they have. - lack of parking

<Title>“Dissapointed - Try another Hotel in NY”
<Content>I just returned from a weekend stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan in NY. I am a Diamond member and stay in hotels over 150 nights a year. This is an outdated hotel in need of an upgrade. The staff was very rude. I asked for subways maps, directions to the airport, restaurant recommendations, etc on multiple occassions from different people and just got blank stares like "How Dare You Ask For Help." I never once got a response to any of the questions. I called the front desk twice for assistance and both times before I could say anything they would transfer me without even knowing what I wanted. I have stayed at 5 other Hilton chain hotels in NY. All of them give Diamond members free hot meals and free internet. This place did neither. You got an English Muffin and had to pay $14/day for internet. On the positive side, the parking garage was nice. $30/day wasnt bad for the city, location is decent if you want to hit 5th ave shopping, very close to the subway (50 feet from the door), and the drinks at the bar were excellent. I give this place such a low rating mainly for the poor customer service and no benefits for Diamond members like other Hiltons in the City. If you have a choice, go Doubletree Suites Times Square.

<Title>“Good Hotel”
<Content>Me and my boyfriend stayed in this hotel from Dec 31st to Jan 6th, We originally only booked for three nights for over New Year, but because of the great location and price online at Opodo we extended our stay here. I would say that the whole hotel seemed nice, everything in our room was clean, the carpets werent worn and the bathroom area was in perfect condition. We had no problem what so ever with the lifts being slow at any time of the day. Staff were very helpful from checking in/out to giving information and directions on places we wanted to go. At the end of our stay we had a bill for the minibar for three items, when we had not even opened the fridge nevermind take things off the ultra-sensitive shelf, but the staff removed them off the bill without any fuss. Our room was also facing the fire and police station, but I think we only noticed the sirens maybe three times in our stay, no problem at all. When we extended our stay we changed rooms, we were allowed to stay in our room past check out time until the next room was ready which was before 3pm, and we were upgraded to and king size room for free which was just that bit bigger then the queen but it made a lot of difference, as the queen was ok, but a bit small with the suitcases in. I would say the one downside to our stay was being next to nosiy guests in the 1st room which was next to some very noisy teenagers who had no respect at all for the other guests, twice security was called to quieten them down, i personally think they should have been thrown out the 2nd time as they would come in around 4-5am shouting screaming down the corridors and in their room. It would seem the walls were a bit too thin. As i said, great location, only a walk away from times square, 5th avu etc, or just as easily get the subway as the station was right next door and you can get a day pass for only $7! bargain! We ate at Pax for breakfast which is just around the corner as they had breakfast specials which were cheap enough and good quality, but also try Ess a Bagel and Metro cafe next door for the sandwiches and salads. Overall, a good hotel in which i would stay again!

<Title>“A book's cover hides some imperfections”
<Content>We stayed for 1 night in January. From the outside and public areas, the hotel looks quite gleaming. The lobby area has been redesigned from when I remember it 6 years ago. There's a modern feel to it. Staff very friendly. The location is great and there are many places to eat nearby. There is a subway station outside. Parking is at an adjacent lot for $30 with hotel stamp. The bad part is that you need to leave the car with the valet, so you need to move everything out of the car. The standard room was tiny. Adequate for a single traveller, but very cramped when there's a small kid. The TV and desks are new, but the bed and other furniture seem old. The carpets were quite dirty. Internet costs extra. Wireless was a bit spotty, but the ethernet worked well. All in all, not bad if you can handle a few imperfections.

<Title>“OK not great”
<Content>Considering how mediocre this place is I'm a bit embarassed at having stayed here several times over the years through several incarnations (it used to be a Lowes hotel). The room was rather tired, with a lousy view of a/c units on the roof of an adjacent bldg. Somewhat crumbling mortar in bath adds to the feel. Nice location, a few blocks removed from Rockefeller Center and walking distance to some great restaurants (eg Rosa Mexicano). Concierge was helpful. Adjacent parking is $30/night with hotel discount, ok for the city. Unless I got a great price (like $150 or so) I'd proably stay in Beekman Towers a few blocks east.

<Title>“Overall good, great location, but a few glitches”
<Content>I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan on December 29 and 30th with my six year old son. We had stayed there in the past, but before it had become a Doubletree. Overall the stay was good. Here are the Pros; You cant beat the location. The hotel is just steps from Rockefeller Plaza and St Patricks and is within walking distance to Times Square and Central Park. The room was a good size, especially for NYC and the shower pressuer was great! The bed was very comfy, in room mini bar and gorgeous flat screen HD tv! All the staff was very friendly and helpful. Cons - No on site parking. The parking garage they've arranged with is within a half block, but is still a hassle to schlep your luggage. Also, when I went to pull in they told me the garage was full until I told them I was with the hotel and only staying one night. Bear in mind I was there just before New Years Eve and the town was packed already. When I did leave however, there were several scratches on my rear bumper. Of course I didnt notice until after I got home so check your car before you pull out!!!! Also, the lobby was very unimpressive and dungeon like. There was no room service until after 4 pm because they're doing renovations on their restaurants. There was no in room coffee. Also, the service in the on site restaurant was very slow. Overall, a good deal for NYC because our rate was $249 compared to most other hotels which were above $400. Definitely workable!!

<Title>“Past It's Prime”
<Content>We stayed for three nights starting Dec. 29, 2008 in room 832. The hotel is in a great location, but it is definitely past it's prime. The lobby and rooms are dingy, dirty and worn. The first notable mention would be the dust covering the surfaces through out the room especially the "food mini-bar", which made it kind of gross. The whole room was old and thread bare with a broken mini fridge cabinet door, chipped furniture and tired looking grimy walls . The bathtub faucet leaked, the sink drain backed up brown water, the hot water disappeared one morning, the hall noise was unrelenting along with crashing sounds through the closet, and housekeeping showed up VERY late in the day (6 pm). We had looked at another room (#932) with hopes of finding a better choice, but that one too looked similar. The hotel needs major upgrades to keep it's Doubletree reputation. We were very disappointed in this hotel. The only redeeming quality was the Doubletree comfy king bed.

<Title>“Great choice!”
<Content>Having to travel to New York on short notice to accompany my daughter for a job interview, I searched for an affordable hotel in the Midtown area. The Doubletree was a perfect deal and I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel upon arrival. The hotel, although not luxurious, is very comfortable and clean, the staff is very accommodating. The room was large and well appointed. My daughter loved her bed. To me the location of the hotel makes it my hotel of choice for future visits. Let me not forget to mention the warm, delicious chocolate chip cookies!

<Title>“Pleasant, Clean Hotel!!”
<Content>We stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan for two nights December 28-29, 2008. We checked in quickly and were pleased with our room (king size.) PROS: The bed is VERY comfy and the room is good size for NYC standards. The bathroom is rather small although the sink is outside the bathroom itself, which is a nice feature. The flat screen TV is HUGE and is great! There is a great floor to ceiling mirror in the room as well as a great big desk that is nice for storage. Elevators are extrememly fast and the conceirge is quite helpful. Subway is right outside the hotel and so are taxis. CONS: Be aware that there is a police station across the street so sirens are quite loud throughout the day (not bad at night.) Sleeping in or taking a quick afternoon cat nap is really not possible if you are a light sleeper. Also, bathrooms do not have fan blowers, which bothers some people. Walls are very thin and you can hear people passing in the hallways (turning air conditioning or heat on high definitely helps with the sirens and hallway noises.) RECOMMENDATIONS: Check out Pax which is a great breakfast spot. It is a block away- on 51st and 3rd- and has everything from bagels to yogurt/granola parfait to cereal to hot breakfasts. Upstairs, second floor seating is available for people watching or just enjoying the newspaper while overlooking the bustling NYC streets. Also, the Metro Cafe which is right next door to the hotel is great!! It has a salad bar, a pasta bar, and everything from quick bites to eat (like sandwiches and side dishes) to munchies (nuts, fruit salads, cookies, chips) to freshly made sandwiches and paninis. The prices aren't too bad (for NYC that is) and won't blow your budget. The Cornerstone restaurant is a great lunch spot down a few blocks from the hotel on 2nd Ave ( I think.) It is a fun little pub style place with a top notch lunch menu. Prices are great, too (for NYC.) Enjoy!

<Title>“Never Again”
<Content>Reserved a double standard room 12/22/2008 --12/27/2008... Room #1041 was very small, in major need of repairs due to mold in bathroom grout in shower, broken tiles in shower, baseboard falling off, TV not useable for 2 days (major games missed)., heat in room not working. Front lobby hostess lied about TV problems. When asked at 11AM day 2, we were told it was still being worked on. When asked again at 2 PM she informed me that she had just come on duty and could not leave the lobby to check on problem. When informed that I had spoken to her 3 hrs earlier, she denied that she was there. TV was fixed by 5PM day 2 with no offer of adjustment on bill. This is our 5th stay at the Metropolitan and will be our last!! The housekeeping staff are the greatest..very polite and accomodating......For what they charge for rates...look at other places....This place is rated 3 star and deserves 1 1/2 at best...What happened?????

<Title>“LOVED NEW YORK..Great Stay”
<Content>Our stay was Dec 13 thru Dec 17. Never been to New York and was a little worried. Our room was a little small and we had no view,but we didn't come to New York to stay in the room. The Staff was friendly and helpful. Only problem was when we purchased tickits for "Wicked" we overpaid by $ 60.00 each!!!! When we complained they told us it was the broker's prices. Would of liked to have know the prices before hand, but they said they would make it up to us...still waiting. Over all our trip was great. Subways are easy to use and cheaper then taking a taxi everywhere. But taxis are great when the weather gets bad. Hope You Have a Great Time In New York !!

<Title>“Couldn't find a single fault with the hotel”
<Content>I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I took my Mum away for Thanksgiving weekend to celebrate her retirement. I had written to the hotel in advance to tell them about this special event. We couldn't believe what was in the room on arrival - a retirement card signed individually by about 20 members of staff and a platter of cookies. The cookies were replaced everyday by the lovely lady who cleaned our rooms. The rooms were so clean and comfortable. The location is fantastic for shopping. Boomingdales is a few blocks north and Saks is a few blocks west. We walked to Times Square on a chilly but crisp evening and it was lovely to soak up the atmosphere of the city. We were so well looked after in this hotel. We had a call from the Careline and also from the Accomodation Manager Mr Holmes to check that we were OK. My Mum felt really special and we had a holiday to remember. I'll be telling all my friends to stay here.

<Title>“Awesome stay for this family!”
<Content>This was our fifth trip to NYC,and this hotel rates in the top 2. The best for location,a few blocks to Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall.A 15 to 20 minute walk to times square.We took this trip with our two teenage boys,and this hotel was perfect for our getaway,Loved walking the city,even on this very cold weekend in November. This hotel was spacious for NYC.Our family of four enjoyed our stay.We arrived on Friday at 11;30 a.m. and the front desk staff quickly checked us in.Our room was 438,a double with a view of the front street of the hotel.Nice warm cookies,They do have nuts and do have 2 warnings stated in bold writing on the bag,But the staff does not inform you and as a parent who does not have children that suffer from peanut allergies ,we were informed only by a previous reviewer.The staff were all very friendly,we were always greeted with a warm Hello and housekeeping and the door greeter was outstanding!! The room itself;The negatives were... rugs were a little worn,as were the bathroom door,not a wide bathroom,but shower was roomy,Thin walls,elevators very slow during 8 a.m and 11 a.m.Concierge,very busy in the mornings,use late afternoon or later. The positives.....Quick elevators besides the times above,security on Saturday nights so be ready with your room key..Friendly and helpful staff,location,cleanliness of hotel, Awesome water pressure,almost too much for cold chapped hands,unique high quality bath fixtures,soaps,shampoos,even sunscreen,TV,and the bedding is So comfy!!! Some helpful hints..Subway available right out the front door..Enjoyed the corner vendors,$3. hot dogs and Roasted Chesnuts were great!!Great burger spot 3 blocks away called GOODBURGER.Amazing burgers,fries and shakes.Also one block away ,tucked away next to Taco bell (hard to see the green sign)and across the street from McDonalds is ESS-A-Bagel ,the best bagels I have eaten in NYC,my boys loved the huge muffins too..24 hour pharmacy across the street and a Staples also.Top of the rock and walking Fifth and Madison Avenue was outstanding! We had a great experience in this hotel and in New York City,wish we could have stayed more than two nights.

<Title>“wicked location, lovely staff and fabulous cookies!”
<Content>I went with two of my friends to this hotel and we stayed for five nights, 20th - 25 November 08. We were really worried after some of the reviews that we had read, but i don't think that we could have asked for anything better. This hotel is well kept, clean and has a lovely atmosphere. The staff are friendly and helpful, i would especially recommend using the concierge service they are really helpful and can arrange anything for you from broadway tickets to helicopter rides. We had a bedroom with two double beds, the beds were really comfortable and the room was very clean. The rooms were reasonably sized and modern. The location of his hotel was great aswell, was within walking distance to everything and if you fancy getting the subway there is one right by the hotel. there is also a great cafe next door to the hotel which does everything from Pancakes to subs and salads (would also recommend the oreo cheesecake). I would also recommend Grayline Limos they are a really great company to use for your airport transfers and are far cheeper then most others in the area, they even upgraded us for our journey home to a stretch hummer limo it was a awesome surprise and rounded of our trip nicely. Overall we had a wicked time in New York and would recommend this hotel to people of all ages.

<Title>“Expensive for standard - great location”
<Content>Great location in midtown NYC, but you pay a premium for it. Overseas visitors will feel the price on exchange rate, and will no doubt think of what an amazing suite they could get for the same money in Sydney, Singapore or Paris. Rooms are small as expected, dated and not overly clean. Despite being on a non smoking floor, there were constant smokers in neighbouring rooms which became overwhelming - although staff did attempt to deal with this quickly. Hotel lobby is tiny and too small for the amount of people using it to wait for transport and check in. Bell hops leave no room for discretion in tipping, as it paid up front on delivery and retrieval of bags. Had much better experiences at Double Tree Hotels in Chicago and other places.

<Title>“Not too shabby”
<Content>After a very disappointing stay at the Radisson, just 3 blocks down the street, I decided to give Doubletree a try and am glad I did. From the moment you enter the lobby, the staff is very professional, pleasant and helpful. Rooms are very small, mine was on the 11th floor, but the room was functional. The heating worked fine and the street noise level was very low. The bed and pillows were comfortable and the room was clean. The TV is small but has good picture, however, they do not have Comedy Central channel and I missed my obligatory Daily Show and Steven Colbert Report. The Internet is $ 13.99 for 24 hours, which is pretty standard for NY. If you are a Hilton loyalist, you get coupons for free breakfast at the 17th floor lounge. The Bfast is continental style, and pretty basic, but not bad being free. There is a Subway station right outside the hotel entrance which makes it very convenient if you like to use the train. I think this is a nice hotel and very good value for NY.

<Title>“Fantastic Location, Fantastic for the Budget Minded Traveler”
<Content>The GOOD: This hotel is perfectly situated in a beautiful part of Manhattan. Everything you need is basically at your doorstep. The E train will take you downtown for $2.00 a trip. The "6" Train will take you uptown to the Gugenheim Museum and other uptown destinations. Restaurants, coffee shops and other locations are right at your fingertips. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Double Tree. The staff is utterly courteous and the rooms have nice beds, flat screen t.v.'s and all the amenities you need for a nice stay. The BAD: This hotel is showing a few signs of age if you require a luxurious room. Luxury is not a requirement for my wife and I. We require clean rooms and a comfortable bed. This room had both. Our room featured a little peeling wall paper and a bathroom door that didn't shut properly. That about sums up all of the negatives I can identify. The UGLY. No "uglies" at this destination. As noted above, we had a really nice stay. Finally, I have to mention that we booked this room directly with the property using our AAA discount for... just over $200 for the first four nights and $175 for the last night. I consider that price to be an utter steal for the location. I highly recommend the Double Tree if you are traveling with budget in mind and want a nice place to stay.

<Title>“Average Hotel”
<Content>As from other reviews, yes the Doubletree is abit dowdy after the front desks, but the rooms were bigger than i expected, there was no problem with traffic noise even with a fire station almost next door. the good point about the doubletree is its location, easy walking distance from Times Square..Central Park and many other places, I trully did not rate the Metro Grill next door, I hate picking my breakfast from a model on a plate!!!!! The free Cookies are excellant. We only got ripped off by the Yellow cab going back to JFK being charged for the Tunnel toll when we did not actually go through it,we appeared to go via all the back streets our driver knew, very poor compared to the taxi who took us from the Airport to the Hotel the charge was $50 each way includeing tolls

<Content>We had booked this hotel because it was the best price in this location. At over $200 a night, we expected more for our money. The best thing about the hotel was the location. You could walk almost anywhere and the subway was just out the door. It looks like the hotel and its rooms had upgrades, but many things were not updated. The beds were very comfortable, there were nice Neutrogena toiletries, but the walls and carpet was dirty and old. The bathroom was very small and the bathtub was very uncomfortable for taking baths.

<Content>Stayed 4 nights in October. Great location for the Metro and main attractions. The room was a good size, with a large comfortable bed, nicely decorated and clean. The bathroom again very clean with adequate towels and shower accessories. A room safe a good touch. The lobby always appeared busy with coach loads of visitors appeared to be arriving daily. Didn't use the restaurant,but had breakfast next door for less than half the price. A bit surprised when they charged $7 to store the cases for a few hours after checkout. Overall a good hotel and would stay again. Watch out for the mini bar ( very pricey) and top tray. Items picked up will be charged to your room if not replaced within 20 seconds.

<Title>“Worst NY Hotel in years”
<Content>Literally one of the worst hotel experiences in years. The lobby is lovely, but as soon as one leaves the lobby, one is shocked! The hallways are dirty, with paint chipping and wallpaper peeling. The room was dirty. There is no way to control the air conditioning in each room - and when we called they said an engineer would come right up and no one ever did! We had to call twice for towels. And this for around $300!! Never going there again.

<Title>“OK Property, Good Value”
<Content>This property has a great location, OK physical property, generally above average staff and usually decent rates, which make it a good value, especially if you are a Hilton Honors loyalist. The location affords plenty of restaurant options, including several 24 hour markets and is close to Radio City Music Hall, 5th Avenue Shopping and Grand Central Terminal. A subway entrance for the 51st St. (4, 5, 6 trains)/ Lexington Ave (E and V trains) station is immediately outside the hotel entrance, which is great. Cabs are also readily available. The property itself was renovated several years ago and the rooms are nice, but do show a little wear and tear. The rooms are small, even by NYC standards, so if you need a large space or are sharing a room with someone to whom you are not related, this is not the place for you. Otherwise, it is fine as long as the rate is decent. There is a great fitness room, with plenty of modern equipment. The business center has several computers, but charges for internet access. The restaurant provides a good, if expensive, breakfast. I didn't use it for other meals. The bars is fun and well populated. The hotel tends to be well patronized, but has a significant number of tourists (as opposed to business persons) and feels crowded as the lobby isn't large; if this bothers you, don't stay here. All in all a good value, as long as you are aware of the room size.

<Title>“doubletree fine”
<Content>my wife & I stayed at the 'Doubletree' the first 4 days of October & found it 'ok' & nothing more.It was the start of our 35th wedding anniversary tour & we wanted something nice to start with so we thought being part of the Hilton group the hotel would be nice, let me say now, the HILTON it isnt! First impressions are good, apart from porters working in a relay team with your bags, ie- 3 demanding tips, yes, I know its there culture, but being a true Yorkshire man, I found it nothing short of begging. I mean, one porter unloaded taxi, held hand out, passed to another who took to reception desk(20mts) held hand out, who then passed trolley to a third for there final journey to our room, bad bad start. However I di-gress, the room was clean with a comfy bed & an adequate bathroom & a ultra sensitive mini-bar. Found the reception/concierge staff quite helpful & pleasant. Location of the 'TREE' is great, thought the price, after looking at others, again, to be 'ok'. O, had a late 8pm flight to Vegas, so had to leave bags with porters, charged $3 for each bag. . .. . . WAIT. . . . that was for dropping & then picking up ie-$18 in total arghhh!!! would we go back? Try somewhere else first now we know the area, but if nothing available, yes the 'TREE' would be booked.

The beds were comfortable and the location was superb (right next door to the subway and 2 blocks away from the shopping haven of 5th and Madison). The lobby was very spacious and modern so perhaps the only gripe of mine is that the furniture in the room is showing its age.

<Title>“Not a place to get any sleep”
<Content>Pros: comfy bed, modern decor, couldn't be closer to the 6 train. Cons: The housekeepers are relentless in trying to clean the room. the early morning knock on the door if you forget the DND sign. If you do use the DND sign, they call the room anyway, assuming that you couldn't possibly still be in the room sleeping. They say that too many people leave for the day w/o removing the door sign and then are mad that the room isn't made up. 3rd day there, they begin changing the carpet in the rooms surrounding me. No advance notice. Slamming doors, banging around, construction guys yelling to each other from down the hall, and their radios playing. Ridiculous. Doubletree said they update rooms daily, but don't know which one ahead of time. The bellman was relentless in trying to get me into one of their "cars" instead of the cab i had planned on taking to LGA. I didn't need help w/ my bags but he grabbed them anyway and then got mad that i didn't give him a tip!!! I too got charged for merely bumping into the items in the mini-bar. Very sensitive laser system. No fridge, no microwave, no coffee maker. I will never stay here again. I'm going back to the Muse on 46th.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>We stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel from 10/2 to 10/5. We paid $303 per night and booked through the hotel's website back in July. I had researched other hotels in the area with 2 beds and a private bath, and this was the cheapest I could find, unfortunately. Rooms-We stayed in rm 1937. Although I did not like the style of the decor in the room, it was clean and comfortable. We did not have a nice view, but we were only in the room for sleeping. The bathroom was small, as expected in any NYC hotel. It was clean and had good water pressure. Location-The location is excellent. You are a 10 min. walk to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Rockefeller Center, and Fifth Ave. shopping. The 51st./Lexington subway stop is right outside of your door. You can access the 6 Train. The E and V trains are accessible from Lexington and 53rd Street. Internet Access: There is free WiFi in the lobby. I was able to surf the net on my cell phone in the hotel room. I believe there is a charge if you actually hook up your laptop to the room's internet. Overall, I would definitely stay here again, given the location of the hotel.

<Title>“Over rated”
<Content>I'd read some good reviews about this hotel but they are totally over rated. The hotel is mediocre. Beds are old and not really comfortable. Overall condition of the hotel, rooms, floors, etc., is not good. Colour scheme is erratic. Good for the location and proximity to the subway but a very high price for what you get. There must be better choices in the area. You also have to pay for leaving the luggage in the storage, and guess what, you have to pay again when you return in the afternoon to pick it up! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

<Title>“Great Choice”
<Content>The location can't be beat, the subway is only 50 feet away from the front door. This is essential because you can get where you want fast via the subway. Don't use the hotel for their car service, because while we were standing there to set one up, two different people were complaining that their car was an hour late and they had to get to the airport. Needless to say we did not use the car service. The staff was nice and the hotel room was clean and had plenty of room. We waited until two days before our trip and the rates went way down. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Title>“Great rate, great location, can't wait to go back”
<Content>We planned a trip to NYC at the last minute (three days notice) and got a great rate at the Doubletree Midtown. Subway stop (6)right outside the front door - took AirTrain from JFK to the E train which connects to the 6 station. The place was obviously doing good business - always a bustle in the lobby. We used the self check in kiosk - no problem (though talking to a desk clerk might have got us a room higher than the 2nd floor and not near the elevator). Room was recently redone and as big as any non NYC hotel rooom. Really. No lie. Big room. Bathroom was all redone, clean and stylish (and thank you for the sunscreen, too). And even with the proximity to the hall traffic, very quiet. Some people have complained about the NYPD and NYFD right next door - the sirens weren't any louder in our room than any where else in the city. Booked through the Hilton website with AAA discount - 220+tax a night for a Fri-Sat stay. We'll definitely be going back.

<Title>“Great Location, Helpful Staff”
<Content>Stayed here for one night in late August. Location cannot be beat. There is an underground stop ten feet from the front door that provides easy access to Yankee Stadium, the WTC site, and the Village. Hotel is in a very cool neighborhood to walk around and not too bad of a walk from Central Park and the Met. Room was spacious, although the bathroom was very small. There are some other, similarly priced hotels in the area that I would try first before returning. However, wouldn't mind staying here again at all. Staff also was very helpful with any questions!

<Title>“Great location great staff”
<Content>This was my first trip to NY and a birthday surprise for my god daughters 18th birthday. I had spent a long time on the internet reviewing comments about a number of NY hotels and ended up booking at the Doubletree. I sent a little note to the manager saying how much we were looking forward to our stay and requesting a quiet room away from the fire station. Our room was a very spacious 2 x double, and the beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Yes the view out of the window was a brick wall, but the room was quiet and dark at night. The bathroom wasnt that big but the shower was great and who goes to NY to waste too much time in a bathroom. A birthday card, cake and complimentary breakfast vouchers were also waiting for us which was a wonderful surprise. All the staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel is situated within walking distance of all the main tourist spots. We did have a problem with some extra items on the bill from the mini bar, the fridge is very sensitive, but there was no problem getting the bill ammended. Would definately stay their again and I cannot understand some of the other comments that have been made. Maybe some people are just incredibly fussy!!! If you want to start your trip with a limo from the airport Grayline Limos were great, despite our plane being 2 hours late, they were there with the largest white limo I have ever seen!!!! As for helicopters Manhattan Helicpoters might be a bit more expensive but they dont pack you in like sardines and you go at the time you booked Claire

<Title>“Housekeeping terrible”
<Content>During our stay we were surprised that the duvets are not covered with a duvet cover but wrapped in a sheet that only goes round the duvet. We found this very strange and resulted in you sleeping under the actual duvet rather than the cover which we found very unhygienic. The housekeepers did not give extra shampoo and products for the shower either on the second day of our stay they only gave replacements for the facewash, considering how much you are paying it should not be too much to ask to be able to shower on the second day given that with the handluggage restrictions we had not brought our own shower products. Laundry was also left on our floor from 11am until late of both days and we got stuck in the lift on the first day of our stay the doors would not open at our floor. I would not stay here again.

<Title>“Good Location”
<Content>Good location for most of the main attractions - subway adjacent but we used yellow cabs or walked most places.Hotel room adequate (king size) and clean although next to the lift and a request to move was not well received - the alternative offered was even less attractive. Not too many friendly faces amongst the staff and the general New York attitude of "take it or leave it" dominates. Breakfast was included in our deal and had a good buffet selection but plenty of options for this locally at a cheaper price. Don't bother with the concierge service unless you wish to pay a premium for theatre tickets or the airport taxi service. We got a room extension till 3pm on the day of our departure at no extra cost - anything later is charged at full day rate.

<Title>“Just okay”
<Content>My husband and I went for a 3 day getaway to NYC. We just wanted to find a relatively reasonable priced hotel that was clean and in a good location. This hotel was moderately priced and we figured that the Doubletree name was good. The location was good. There is a good cafe for a quick reasonable lunch or breakfast located adjacent to the hotel. The room was very disappointing. It had a gym smell to it. We got moved, but the next room was the same. At that point, we had no alternative but to stay. The fitness center was also poor. Wi fi is available for free, but you need to use it in the lobby. It costs to use it in the room. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Convenient stay at the Double Tree”
<Content>We stayed at the double tree for 3 nights over the labour day weekend. It cost us 730 dollars, which i thought was fair for the hotel. The rooms were clean and not terribly outdated as some complain, but I can see how they did quick fixes when "renovating" the rooms. We stayed in room 604, which faced lexingon and you could hear noise from the street, but not loud enough to keep you up at night. I also agree that the bellmen were not pushy at all. I found the reception was helpful, she got us 2 of three rooms when we arrived at 11am, long before checkin time (3pm), I also tipped her for doing that, and then only 30mins later she called to say the last room was ready and was upgraded from a queen to a king. The one thing that i didn't like was how cheap the hotel was. They wanted you to pay for everything, from the bottle openers, to using the fridge in the room, to the internet service. Considering they weren't a low end hotel, you would think they could bend and offer some complimentary services. Checkout was extremely simple, we didn't have to speak with anyone. Overall this was a great average hotel to stay at, those who are complaining must have paid more than we did, as i feel for New York City, we got our money's worth.

The warm cookies were nice - don't even touch the mini bar or snacks...You will be charged for touching! Probably would not stay again - the price was cheaper then most and now I know why.....Needs some attention.

<Title>“Less than a DoubleTree”
<Content>Great location and right accross the street from Police and Fire stations. Asked to be moved from our room and was told they could do that. Never did even after asking twice for this Hilton Honors Diamond member. One day the maids failed to clean our room even when I told her when we'd be leaving. Room service closes at 11pm which seems unusual for a 24/7 city! Offered breakfast thru their executive lounge each morning, and was very very basic and surprisingly sparse food choices.

<Title>“Striclty OK, needs a refurbishment”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel on a Sunday night. Got the rate of $280 all inclusive. Room was pretty small but thats par for the course in NYC. The rate was decent considering it was New York. Located on Lex Ave and 51st St. Subway station is next door so the city is accessible. But the hotel is in desperate need of renovations. The rooms must have been at least 10 years old. The less said about the bathroom the better. The hotel was overall chaos. You walk into the lobby and there were people waiting everywhere to either check in or check out. I was lucky I stayed there for only 1 night. I checked out at 9 in the morning and needed to keep store my luggage as I had to finish my meetings. They charge $1 per bag to check in and another $1 to collect!!!! I mean I know its NYC but after charging me almost 300 bucks they cant keep my bags for free... Shows the cheap mentality of hotels in NY. I returned in a rental car to pick up my bags and it took then almost half hour to find the luggage that they had stored. The luggage was kept completely hapazardly. Overall this is an inexpensive place to stay but is SURELY NOT doubletree standard hotel.

<Title>“great location and staff!”
<Content>My wife and I took a kid free getaway to New York and as soon as we arrived at this hotel, I was glad that I selected it. We were greated by smiles and everyone was helpful. We arrived by train around noon and even though check in is 3pm, we got right up to a nice clean room. We were on the 7th floor facing Lexington and there was no problem with noise. The concierge was helpful both for getting around town and with dinner suggestions. The hotel is 2 blocks from the E train and 1 block from the 4 train so it was super easy getting around anywhere we wanted to go. Its about a 20 minute train to Yankee stadium and about a 10-15 min walk down 51st St to any theater. Nice area and we felt totally safe even walking around late at night. The warm cookies were a nice plus after a long day of walking around. Would stay again!

<Title>“Perfect Location”
<Content>Recommended. Location was ideal. Price was good. Room was a good size, as was the bed. No real noise from the street - we were on the 4th floor and on Lexington Ave - but take earplugs in case the sirens start wailing! Bathroom was on the small side, but I didn't visit NYC to sit in the shower all day. Didn't try any meals in the hotel as there were so many other places to choose from over the city. One thing I noticed was that the bell-hops weren't pushy unlike other US hotels I've been to. If you wanted them to help, you'd ask them. If not, they wouldn't bother you. Unique Qualities: Location is right on top of the subway (routes 6, E and V) which can take you most places. Walking distance to the main shopping streets and plenty of places to eat in the vicinity.

<Title>“Good location but the staff weren't friendly”
<Content>We stayed at the Doubletree for 6 nights in early July 08. The location was great really with the number 6 subway right outside your door. The cookies were very welcome on arrival and everything felt as if it was going to be good. The room was as we expected - small by US standards but hey this is New York so no different to London really. Having no tea/coffee making facilities was a pain and there was no friendly sure we can sort that from the reception staff... On the Reception staff well what can I say... Not one of the receptionists was friendly or helpful. We took US travellers cheques with us and each day we played a game of how much will they change as every day, depending on their mood, depended on how much you could change, if you needed ID or if you could change 2 lots in one day! We were even told by one who refused to change our cheques that no one in th eUS took them any more - strange as all our evening meals and main purchases in shops were done using cheques?? Each day different rules.... The Conciege was also not very friendly. We asked him what was the best way to get back to JFK for 2 people and he just said; "get a cab". No smile, no explanations that was it. We wanted to get tickets to a ball game but it appeared to be so much trouble we couldn't be bothered and went to the theatre instead. The Porters.. When we booked out we were charged $1 for the storage of our bags and then another $1 for collection. When we went to 'get our cab' the porter tried to get us to get a hire car for $15 more. I think the porters are on a bit of a shady number here. However, with this in mind I would stay at the hotel again as it was such a great location. I will just have to remember to be as indifferent to the reception staff as they are to you. Although I do recall there was another hotel across the road - The Waldorf I think?

<Title>“Good stay”
<Content>Stayed over the fourth of July weekend. We had a room with two double beds which by NYC standards was a pretty good size. Plenty of room to move around etc. The bathroom was also fairly decently sized and had counter space which again for NYC is great. This is not a luxury hotel, but definitely clean, comfortable, and has a good location. The 6 subway stops right next to the hotel which makes it convenient to get anywhere on the upper or lower east side of Manhattan. Rockefeller center is within a few walking blocks and also has a convenient subway. Walking to Times Square/Theater District takes about 10-15 minutes. Parking at the garage next to the hotel is $30 if you get your ticket validated by the hotel (no in and out privileges though). The price was really good for NYC particularly if you're trying to find a room with two beds in it.

<Title>“Perfect & Smooth Experience”
<Content>Although our stay was short (2 days), we will definitely return to the Doubletree. The price was right ($215) , the location was key (midtown manhattan) Check-in was seamless -- (I had booked online) -- it took less than 1 minute .. the staff were so on it and available. As we walked to the elevators, we passed the lounge/bar and it was filled with young people having a drink, chilling online, etc..there was a sense of "subdued hipness" which we liked in case we ran out of things to do in the city (Not!). The rooms were clean, quiet and comfortable. The concierge recommended a great steakhouse (Old Homestead) since our first 2 choices were booked. Be careful with the minibar - there's a peculiar rule -- if you so much as move (not consume) one of the items within, you will be charged. My curious husband incurred such charge, but it was taken off since we explained nothing was taken.. Great experience!

<Title>“Great value in Midtown Manhattan”
<Content>On a recent trip to see friends in the NYC area, we decided at the last minute to go into the city for a night. It was July 4 weekend, but we had no problem finding a room. I had stayed at plenty of hotels in Manhattan on business, but my wife had not been to New York in several years. We wanted something centrally located, clean and not too expensive (unlike places I stayed on the company dime). That is exactly what we got at the Doubletree Metropolitan. Our room was good sized for New York - not suite sized, but enough room to open both suitcases and still have lots of space to move around. The bed was very comfortable, linens clean and no nasty comforter made of unknown fabric/material. The bathroom was small, but not horrible. Marble flooring, new sink and a new or refinished tub. The water pressure was excellent. Stainless fixtures were new and of decent quality. The staff was extremely friendly. They were everywhere and constantly asking to assist. A nice touch considering the typical staffing at other hotels in the area. Cons: $15.95 for internet access. I guess that's how they can afford to sell you a room for less than $150 a night. Not good if you're there on business for several days, but we weren't. Small lobby, but last time I checked, I wasn't sleeping in the lobby. Overall, we were pleased with the Doubletree and will probably stay there again when we come to New York later this year.

<Title>“Excellent Value, Fantastic Location!”
<Content>We stayed at the Metropolitan DoubleTree for one night in July to attend a NY Yankee game. In short: we were extremely pleased with our stay. Got a ridiculously low rate for NY ($127/night for a king smoking) via the hotel website and using my AAA membership. BTW...the next-best rate for the same night was $68 more. That alone made up the cost of AAA for the whole year. For for under $200 in midtown, I don't expect much, but this was a nice place. The lobby, bar and restaurant are all clean and well-staffed. Our room was on the small side for other cities but quite large by Manhattan standards. It had a comfortable King bed, writing desk, 26" tv, chaise lounge, windows that open (!), and full-sized combo bath/shower. Neutrogena products in the bath. No trouble with hall noise. As others have stated, you do have to be careful with the minibar stuff. Housekeeping had placed a notice on the counter that if you removed anything from the minibar for 20 seconds or more, it would be charged to your room. I would love to say that our minibar bill was a mistake since it was quite large, but truthfully, we couldn't find a liquor store open after 9pm so we pretty much cleaned the room out of alcohol. What ever happened to the "city that never sleeps???" In the end, we decided to stay in the room and enjoy beverages because we could smoke there plus it was still cheaper than a NYC bar....and we could wear our pajamas while doing so. The location couldn't be better. There is a metro stop right outside the hotel and it was an easy subway ride to Yankee Stadium or anywhere else throughout Manhattan. This is certainly the cheapest and most efficient way to travel in the city. Midtown is very safe so you can feel comfortable walking alone almost anytime except the very early morning hours. We parked in the garage around the corner from the main entrance for $30/24 hours which is a good price for this part of town. The hotel has an agreement with the parking facility and you just have to get your valet ticket stamped at the desk to get the special rate. Our only tiny gripe was that the prices stated on the minibar menu differed from the ones on our bill at checkout. I brought this to the manager's attention and he rectified it right then with no problem. We were very pleased and would stay there again.

<Content>This DoubleTree has a good location, fairly close to Grand Central Station. Check in was easy. Room was small, but that's fairly typical in NYC. The AC never got the room cool...but it was not bad enough, nor did I have the time in my schedule, to demand a new room. Breakfast was ok. The rates in NY are simply throught the roof, but it is all relative. I would stay here again but can't give the place a strong recommendation.

<Title>“Nice hotel with a great location!”
<Content>I visited this hotel with a few girlfriends on a weekend trip to NYC. We found the value to be exceptional (for NYC) and the accomodations comfortable. We arrived early, and were unable to check in, but we were able to check out bags and the front desk clerk was able to direct us to a nice place to have lunch. Additionally we were in need of a place to have dinner one evening and the concierge suggested a nice steak house a few blocks away - Bobby Van's. We had a great time!! Lastly, the warm chocolate chip cookies on check in were just a nice added bonus.

<Title>“Great value hotel”
<Content>Great value hotel. Good price ($175/night over 3 nights) during July 4 weekend. Rooms are relatively small (not a surprise in NYC). Staff is friendly. Location is good. They have an arrangement with a neighboring monthly parking garage ($30/night) where you can keep your vehicle for the duration of the stay. You cannot however take your the car until the end of your trip ie. there is not unlimited in-out access in the garage. They serve delicious cookies when you check in. Before checkout they had incorrectly billed us for $60 worth of mini-bar usage which they quickly reversed without questions. There is a Metro Grill restaurant right next door which stays open from 6am to 12pm. Good food. For this rate I would good back to this hotel anytime.

<Title>“A Good Choice”
<Content>Overall we were very pleased with this hotel and would happily stay here again. The Positives: Wonderful location Extremely nice staff, except for one girl who works in the bar Large, quiet room with a very comfortable bed The Negatives: Air conditioning in the room was a bit weak. Storing luggage for early check-in should be provided as a courtesy rather than charging a fee. There is no in-room coffee maker.

<Title>“Too Many Problems to Stay Again”
<Content>The positives of this hotel are the location and the beds. It is very close to a subway, very close to walk to great tourist and shopping areas, it is easy to get to almost any spot from the hotel. The beds are very good and the pillows are great. The room is a little small for more than 2 people but was adequate for us. The bathroom is newly remodeled and while small, very nice. Another positive was the doorman at 5am. He could not have been any nicer or more helpful. The negatives: Maybe too many to write all. I booked and paid for the hotel about a month in advance. I asked for an upper floor with a view, got the fourth floor with a view of a wall and air conditioning unit. Called and asked for different room and was told all Lexington Ave rooms were private apartments and nothing else was available. We were not able to check in at 1pm and had to place our bags in "storage" for a $1.00 per bag. Since we were going to walk around we placed backpack and large overnight bag so the total was $6.00. Imagine our shock when we came back in and had to pay another $6.00 to get them out of the closet. Not a bellboy bringing them to our room, but us walking into the closet and getting them. Just the beginning of the nickel and dime charges we experienced during our visit. We were not offered cookies and someone wrote about free bottled water, well, we were not offered anything that was free. I had asked when I made my reservations if there was a fridge in the room to place insulin and was told yes. There is a fridge but it is so full of items that 2 vials of insulin kept knocking a beer off to the side and were charged $6.00 numerous times. I asked if we could have someone take out the items and leave the fridge for us to use and was told no, but if an empty fridge became available, they would bring it up for a charge. They did take off the charges of the beer when we checked out (sort of). My daughter had arrived before I did and she put up a credit card for incidentals. Four days after checkout her credit card was still holding $180 pending charges. $50 a day plus the mini bar charges I was told would be taken off. They took the items off when we called to ask about the pending charges and they said the $50 a day incidental charge would come off the next day. Wow, holding this money for 5 days is really not acceptable to me. You have to pay for Internet access to the amount of $13.00 a day which is very unusual these days. I cannot think of anything that came as complimentary. I would really check around before staying here again and figure in the price of the things that are usually free at other hotels. I think this hotel was about $20 a night cheaper than the other 2 in the area and with the extra charges probably came out to be about $15 a night more expensive. The concierge was VERY rude and quite insulting when I asked for a map of the area. I suppose because I was not booking anything through them, he assumed it was ok to be rude. Once again, not what I was expecting. We were going to see if we could book a play through them and then decided we would plan everything else ourself so as to not be in a position to tip these horrid people. Overall it was not a good experience--except the location is great but there are other hotels in the exact area. We will try them next time.

<Title>“Disappointing and overpriced”
<Content>I recently spent 4 nights at the Doubletree Metropolitan, having high expectations from a 4 star, highly recommended and very pricey hotel in Midtown. Overall I was quite disappointed. A warning to all potential customers - the hotel rooms are NOTHING like what you see on the Doubletree website!! I stayed in an ordinary room (which still cost $300 per night not including breakfast) - the room was clean but the decor was very shabby - paint peeling off the walls, a completely bare, stark room, bad lighting and absolutely no space. Admittedly, it was my first experience of Manhattan hotels, but I refuse to believe that this is the best that 300 dollars can buy. The staff were civil, but not in any way warm, welcoming or helpful. Staying here, you're very aware of staying in a large hotel chain - the general feeling is totally impersonal. As for facilities, the restaurant is ok - but again very expensive and the food ok but nowhere near 4-star standard. My conclusion - this is a hotel that thinks it can charge 4-star prices for a 2-star service just because it's in Midtown Manhattan. Shop around before you stay here.

<Title>“New York City Weekend at a Doubletree Hotel”
<Content>Overall, the stay was fine. The Hilton Hotel chain took over this hotel within the past three years. Prior to this, it was a Loews Hotel. On arrival (around noon) we found out that we were going to be upgraded to a mini-suite (Diamond HHonors member) but our room wasn't ready. We checked our two bags and a backpack. We were told that it was a $3.00 fee for the three bags. OK, we would have tipped that much anyway. On our return, we had to pay another $3.00 to get the bags back. I'm nitpicking but my feeling is that if you are a guest, waiting for a room, there shouldn't be a charge (in and out) to store luggage. Room was nice with 20 plus feet of windows overlooking the street. Bed was comfortable; bathroom was very small; cable tv was decent; internet access was $14.95 a day. Hilton Honors lounge was opened only in the morning. Light breakfast items available. Overall, hotel is a 1960s style hotel, but modernized and updated. Location is close to everything we wanted to go to. Mass transit was nearby. Taxi to and from LaGuardia was around $27.

<Title>“Best place to stay!”
<Content>This trip was intended to be a nice romantic weekend with my boyfriend, that was also my birthday weekend. We had a BLAST in NY and the hotel just made it even better. It was a very retro, modern hotel, great style, very clean. The bed was absolutely comfortable and the room was a good size with a huge window. The only downfall was the bathroom was a little awkward: pedestal sink, no counter space, but lots of floor space so I ended up using the floor for my hairdryer and other girl bathroom stuff. Everything was very clean though and I was extremely please wtih the atmosphere. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are thinking about a trip to NY and Times Square. We ended up taking a cab everywhere, but if it wasn't so cold we would have walked. The price was great too.

<Title>“Doubletree Metropolitan in NYC is awful.”
<Content>Having a pretty rough experience at the Doubletree in NYC. It was the only open hotel around my office so I decided to give it a shot and I wish I decided on a place farther away. I showed up and the front desk was fine but upon entering my room found that the fire alarm cover was sitting on the bed, the bathtub contained some form of matter and there was CANDLE WAX covering the insides of my room drinking glasses. I called down to the front desk requesting a room change but they said they were overbooked as it was, so I just asked for some new glasses. The gentleman showed up 10 or 15 minutes later with a blanket in hand and I had to explain to him I just wanted some new drinking glasses and not a blanket. The gentleman brings back clean glasses and I head to bed around 10:30 PM, after receiving a call from the front desk regarding my glasses, due to a 7AM meeting on Park Ave. The last straw happened when at 11:30, I wake up to a shrill ring and it's my bedside phone. I pick it up not knowing what to expect and it's someone from the "CareLine" asking if I received my remote control. I'm never rude to hotel staff but was about to lose it at this point. I say it's the wrong room, I never ordered a remote control and the woman says, "Ok...Well do you need anything else?" I just need a clean place to sleep for under $500 a night and this will never again be the place. The only redeeming quality here is the bedding and the location.

<Title>“Great location - not so great rooms”
<Content>This hotel is in a great location, close to shopping, NY sites and the subway. The staff was great. The rooms, however, are in need of updating and the bathroom is so small you have to close the door before you sit down. There is no coffee in the room and they have the strangest mini bar I have ever seen. Items sit in a container on top of the dresser. If you lift an item off its designated area for more than 45 seconds, they charge you for the item. Well the room was so small that we had a small suitcase sitting on the dresser and I guess when we opened it, it must have moved some of the items. So we had all of these charges on our bill. Now they took them off, but it still took time. The free HIlton Honors breakfast was meager and while they had Starbucks coffe in the regular dining room, they did not in the HH room. The room temperature is controlled by a window unit that can be set to low, medium or high...that;s it. I would hate to be here when it gets really hot. The lobby is drab and also needs some restoration. I did not go into the bar area, but it looked lively enough. I was meeting my girlfriend there and I had made the reservation., When I realized she would arrive hours before I would, I telephoned the hotel direclty to have her name added to the room reservation. When she arrived that had no record of that. Unlike the previous review, we had no problem with housekeeping. But this hotel was really not great and I wouldn't stay there again.

<Title>“Perfect Location. Great Stay!”
<Content>We stayed at the Metropolitan for two nights, during our first visit to NYC. The location was perfect -- we walked to so many great places, Rockefeller Center, Grand Central (where there was an amazing market with the best food every), Central Park, and so many more locations. The room was generously sized (we had a double room), and the bathroom was great. No complaints here. We booked online at their website and got a great deal -- about $170 a night. No noise. Perfect service. Great location. Never visited the onsite bar, but it was a hot spot on Friday and Saturday night. Staff helped graciously with everything -- didn't ever wait for more than 60 seconds to get a cab. Was absolutely wonderful for the money (and for twice the price). We will definitely stay here again -- and caught ourselves saying many times during our NYC visit, "our hotel couldn't be better located." Travelled with our 16 year old daughter, who enjoyed being able to run downstairs (and one door down) for chocolates from the chocolate shop, and for things from the deli/store only 10 steps from the hotel's entrance. Close to at least 3 starbucks. Only caveat (which we read many warnings about), was that we were charged for $3.50 for something from the mini bar which we didn't touch (we had been warned about even looking at anything on the mini bar or opening the mini fridge so we didn't touch a thing and yet were still charged). But since it was a small amount, we didn't actually ask for a credit -- just wasn't worth any hassle since it was a small amount. That's it though. Otherwise, it was perfect for us for our weekend visit.

<Title>“Will Not Stay Here Again”
<Content>We received no housekeeping the first two days of our stay. Even after complaining the first day that the room wasn't clean, they still did not clean it on the second day. we asked for the room to be cleaned for us while we were out in the evening, we returned to find it had been cleaned, but some of our items were missing. The rooms are described as being renovated, but ours was already run-down with peeling wallpaper and paint, clogged drains, and mold/mildew all over the bathroom walls, ceiling and shower curtain. If anything touches the snack box above the minibar, your room will be charged, and it can be a bit of a surprise to find dozens of minibar charges when you haven't taken anything, on the bill you receive the morning you are leaving. The hotel manager whom we eventually dealt with was very understanding and was good to work with to satisfactorily resolve most of our concerns. However, we did have to spend a lot of time talking to other staff who were not so helpful or courteous before our concerns were finally resolved. The only good things we experienced about this hotel was the location as it is right on the Lexington Avenue metro line, and very easy to get anywhere in Manhattan, including all major attractions. The deli (cafe metro) just outside the hotel is great for fresh, quick and affordable breakfasts.

<Title>“Most Excellent”
<Content>I had a fantastic 3 day stay here in June. My reservation was made online through hotels.com 2 days before my arrival and I got an excellent rate (around $200 CAD per night). Check in was a breeze and was upgraded to a room with a King bed. The room were huge by NYC standards. Every single room is newly remodeled (renovations are completely finished). Flat screen TVs, great bathrooms and clean, modern decor. Didn't order any room service, so cannot comment on that. All in all a great stay, and will definitely be staying here again next time in NYC.

<Title>“Lovely stay at the DoubleTree”
<Content>Stayed at the DoubleTree for three nights and had a lovely time.. The rooms are average size but quite roomy by NYC standards. The entire staff was pleasant and very helpful. Upon check-in you are treated to large cookies that are actually very tasty, and shown to your room quickly and kindly. The maids are quick and efficient about their work and very polite. Everything was very clean and many towels were provided. The toiletries are all Neutrogena brand which was a pleasant surprise. In room amenities include fridge, hair dryer, iron and board etc. All that you would expect and the price was very reasonable for NYC. I think it was $170 a night with AAA. . My husband was annoyed that there were no coffee machines in the rooms, which as it turns out is a Union issue - as a native New Yorker I understand and sympathize with them on this - that they are struggling with at the moment but they are happy to oblige you with complimentary coffee or tea from either the bar or restaurant at any time which makes up for it. The location is great, right in the heart of midtown and mere blocks to practically everything. Very enjoyable stay!

<Title>“great location!”
<Content>We stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan for 2 nights and were very satisfied. The bed was comfortable and the shower was powerful. Make note not to touch the mini bar if you don't intend to purchase anything. There is a sensor on it and if you just knick something, you will be charged. We had a $7.00 charge on our bill for a candy bar that we didn't eat and the front desk was happy to remove the charge. The subway is right outside your door as well as a great metro cafe with healthy food (fresh juice, fruit, salads etc.) and fast service. Would definitely recommend breakfast or lunch there. You can walk (15 minutes either way) to Central Park and Broadway. Be sure if you arrive with a vehicle to remove everything you may need out of it. Once they valet park it, you do not have quick access to it. It will be stacked on lifts.

<Content>We had the pleasure of staying at the Doubletree Metropolitan on Lexington Avenue this past weekend as an anniversary getaway. The room was clean and pleasant, the bedding was comfortable and the many pillows on the bed were a definite plus. While we did not have a street view, we had a quiet room with no traffic noise. The room was equipped with a pay bar and honor snacks. I would have liked a coffee maker but there was a lovely metro cafe next door. The hotel staff was friendly and courteous. I would stay here again.

<Title>“Fantastic, caring hotel”
<Content>What a great hotel! The cookies on arrival (we had 2 each) and the free bottle of water certainly helped after our flight. The room was a good size, bathroom a bit small but who lives in there anyway. Concierge were very helpful and gave great suggestions of places to visit. The hotel is in a great location close to the subway system and in walking distance of many of the shops and places of interest. Didn't eat there so can't say what that was like. Got billed for minibar use which we didn't do but there was no problem correcting this, All staff were friendly and eager to help. We went to see Legally Blonde - fantastic. If you like the film you'll love the musical. Booked a bus tour which was great value with NY Sightseeing. For $49 we had an uptown and downtown hop on/hop off tours, a Brooklyn and night tour (which both lasted about 1 1/2 which you stayed on the bus) and a free 75 minute cruise to see the Statue of Liberty which we didn't have time for. We did catch the Staten Island Ferry which was free and goes close enough to get great photos. It only took 20 minutes too. As far as shopping is concerned everything is so cheap compared to the UK. Found more clothes to buy in Macy's but did have some lovely 7 For Mankind jeans in Bloomingdales. Bought a bracelet in Tiffany's which was too big but was able to get links taken out for free and could pick it up 4 hours later. I love New York and can't wait to return. Hoping to stay in the Doubletree Met again too.

The first night we stayed in the room, AC was not working properly, next day I went to the front desk to let them know, when we returned from our day of sightseeing, we'd been put on the 17th executive floor - very nice room-by the house manager at the time "Tony", he also threw in 2 days of Breakfast Buffet. The staff from the front desk, to the resteraunt were very nice, I'd definitely return and recommend!

<Content>The location is very good - just a few blocks from Grand Central and other attractions in the city. I have never seen a hotel in New York that did not offer a coffee maker in the room, however, and the halls were not very clean. Housekeeping was slow, not arriving to clean the room until after 5:30. The room was serviceable, if spartan. Would we stay again? We would check other places first.

<Content>Decent size room for the price. Location was good and room was clean. I had a meeting at the Waldorf located across the street. Room rates were half what the Waldorf was charging. I had a couple of minor problems. The TV came on in the middle of the night several times. I solved the problem by unplugging it. Also, the room was a bit warm and I couldn't get the AC to work. I opened the window which wasn't too bad because I had an interior room. The staff was very friendly and was able to recommend several restaurants nearby.

<Title>“Doubletree Cookies”
<Content>We have just got back from a 5 day stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan and would recommend it. Great location but close enough to walk to the majority of the attractions and directly opposite the Grayline tour bus, very good value at 74 dollars per person for a 3 day all loops tour plus a night tour along with a Statue of Liberty ferry trip. The staff are mostly friendly and especially helpful and knowledgeable was Kimberli the concierge. The guy that checked us in advised on of a very sensitive minibar snacks system and if we needed a fridge to store our own drinks just ask and they would supply us one. Beds in both the rooms we booked for our family we very comfortable, clean bathrooms and toiletries. Rooms were well cleaned and serviced daily. No tea or coffee facilities in the room which seems to be the norm for New York. The only downside to this hotel was the Fire Station & Police station at the end of the block, which due to the one way system all emergency vehicle traffic passes your room especially if you have a front or side facing room you will hear a variety of sirens through the night. Book your limo if you want one through the hotel and at all costs avoid Lincoln Limo's of New York www.lincolnlimousine.com unless you are particularly fond of rallying in city traffic in a battered filthy LIMO with only one working seatbelt and a driver who had very successful charisma bypass operation and paying 152 dollars for the experience. Not exactly the surprise I had hoped for my family when telling them as we walked through arrivals that one of the smartly dressed Chauffeurs with name boards will be for us. Ours arrived after several phone calls with a driver who matched the shabby exterior of the car perfectly. Please do yourself a favour and avoid at all costs

<Title>“Convenient, Yet Quiet Location”
<Content>We just returned from a long weekend in NYC. We stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan at 51st and Lexington. The check-in process was fairly slow, but the bell staff was on top of luggage storage...perhaps because they charge $1/bag to store and $1/bag to retrieve each piece! I found that to be a bit over the top. All in all, the hotel was great. It was just a short 3-5 block walk to Rockefeller Center and the subway stop was just around the corner from the hotel. The breakfast buffet was nothing to write home about. I'm just not a fan of buffets. It was adequate, but not worth the $24 they charge for it. Who wants to eat at the hotel when you're in NYC, anyway... right?!?! A few random notes: The hotel towels were above average quality. We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to get the elevator -- and we were on a high floor. The recent remodel was a success. The rooms are nicely appointed and the lobby/lounge are modern looking. The hotel offers Neutrogena bath products, including facial cleanser and facial lotion. You can actually open the window in your room about 4 inches to let in the sounds and smells of the city, if you dare. If you are looking for a convenient, reasonably priced hotel in Manhattan, but don't want to be in the Times Square area, you should definitely consider the Doubletree Metropolitan!

<Title>“Very Handy Hotel -”
<Content>Hotel is in a very handy spot and within walking distance of the NBC studios! Charming hotel, on check in they give you a complimentary warm cookie! Room was a decent size, well used but clean! Although the room was warm and at a constant temperature, the heater was broken which prevented us giving the room that little extra boost of heat thats nice in the evenings! The view was magnificant, although it was my first time in NY so it was rose tinted glasses all the way! Oh yea - the first night of our stay it rained buckets! - Umbrellas were 35 dollars in the hotel shop! a little overpriced if you ask me!

<Title>“Wonderful Stay”
<Content>Observations: My wife, infant daughter, and I stayed here for a weekend in May. We arrived before the normal check-in time, but the front desk was extremely accomodating. Our front desk agent, Alexandra (?) was very friendly and made us feel very welcome. Our room was clean and nicely furnished. We had requested a crib, and this was brought fairly promptly. My wife wanted some ice, and as I was wandering down the hall with the bucket, a housekeeping staff person went way out of her way to direct me to the ice machine and to give me an extra bag to get some more ice, as the bucket was on the small side. Once I arrived back at the room, we received a phone call from downstairs asking if everything in the room was ok. I definitely appreciated the effort the staff seemed to put in to making sure we were taken care of. Lastly, on the day of our check-out, the bellmen (their names were Luis and Reginald) were very helpful in arranging a car service to the airport for us at a reasonable price. Location: This is in a great location, literally right above the 6 train and a short walk to the E also. Complaints? Not many, and not major in my mind. But here they are: - Concierge desk: went to ask for restaurant recommendations and they did not seem caring, nor did they really want to take the time to describe anything, give me a map, offer to make a reservation, etc. And there was no line behind me either. I found them rather snooty. - Minibar: snack items on the desk were dusty. I didn't indulge in any items and was charged for one. However, the charge was promptly removed (no questions asked) when I brought it up to the front desk.

<Title>“Great location, great hotel, great cookies!!!”
<Content>When we were looking for a hotel in NYC, we based it on three things - location (we wanted Midtown), ratings on Trip Advisor and ratings from Expedia users. The Doubletree scored high on all three - and when we arrived, tired after our long flight from Heathrow, we weren't disappointed. The location is fantastic - a few blocks from the Chrysler building and close to Central Park. There's also a Subway station nearby. The service was excellent, warm, friendly and helpful. The room itself was great - spacious, warm and welcoming, with a great big bed and powerful shower. Best of all were the complimentary Doubletree cookies - absolutely delicious! Overall, this is a great hotel which I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone visiting New York. 10 out of 10! P.S. If you're tired after a hard day's sightseeing, pay a visit to the hotel restaurant on the lower ground floor - The Met Grill. Fantastic burgers, superb Argentinian Merlot and excellent service - at a good price! (Just don't be put off by the slightly faded 80's decor!)

<Title>“Not user friendly”
<Content>This hotel in well placed in Lexington Avenue within walking distance of most of the attractions in Manhattan. The room was reasonable although far from completely comfortable. The facilities were sparse, with no shelf in the bathroom for any make-up or a toothbrush, no mirror on the dressing table, and the bed was a bit lumpy albeit with clean sheets. The reception staff were cold and impersonal - during the check-in process the girl behind the desk could hardly be bothered and didn't actually look up once. We never ever open mini-bars in any of the hotels we stay in but I still received a bill on the day of checkout for imaginary drinks we had supposedly consumed - this charge was only grudgingly removed at my insistence and the cashier made her disbelief in my protest quite obvious. We stayed for three nights and on two nights we were woken up at 3am by the hotel telephonist trying to contact a person with a different name - when I told her she'd got the wrong room the phone was put down both times with no apology for waking us in the middle of the night. The previous hotel we stayed in was the Marriott in Times Square and compared to this place I would go back there like a shot - this one is to be avoided in my view.

<Title>“A great choice!”
<Content>For my hubby's birthday, we booked a 5 day trip to the Big Apple. The hotel was great! We loved the retro feel. The room was small but clean and comfortable. The bathroom was good. The night we arrived there was a warm cookie waiting for us, and it was a really nice touch. The towels were changed promptly every day and the hotel offered little bottles of Neutrogena products like shampoo, lotion etc. The location of this hotel was ok, but it was a decent 30 minute hike to Times Square. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel but opted for the little breakfast/lunch joint next door called Metro Cafe. Absolutely loved it! So fast, the food was good and prices just right!

<Title>“Exceeded Expectations”
<Content>When I found out that my company had booked me into a hotel that was under $200 a night in NYC I was nervous, but the Doubletree exceeded my expectations. I was able to check in early (around 1:00). No rooms with one bed were available, so I took two double beds. Although the beds took up the majority of the floor space, the room was definitely larger than expected and equivalent in size to rooms I've had in other cities, whereas I ususally find NY rooms to be miniature. Desk set up was also functional and flat panel TV was nice. I found the beds to be extremely comfortable. I was on the 19th floor. No real view, looked out onto some lower rooftops, but away from the street so it was very quiet. I also didn't hear neighbors on either side (not sure if hotel was full, but lobby was busy). I found this to be one of my quieter hotel stays and slept better than I usually do in hotels. My only complaints are that the hotel room was a bit musty and temperature did not seem highly adjustable (although I did like that you could leave the unit on for venting and background noise). Only serious problem was that the bathroom smelled VERY strongly of mildew and mildew was visible between tiles and on the bottom of the shower curtain. Given the very small size of the bathroom, this was quite unpleasant. I thought the location was good. An easy walk to Times Square and even walkable to Herald Square shopping. Not as convenient to restaurants. This is kind of away from both the tourist areas and the neighborhoods (in more of a business district) so I guess it depends on what kind of atmosphere you're looking for.

<Title>“Yes the rooms are small - and there are other small issues. However...”
<Content>I am a picky traveler - no two ways about it. I was dubious about a hotel in NYC for $150 a night (not to mention that their parking is only $30 ... compared with upwards of $50 most other places). However, I was pleasantly surprised ... my requested room type was arranged without hesitation from the staff, the front desk clerks were VERY friendly and helpful. The room is small, but it was a one-night stopover en-route from Philadelphia to New Hampshire, so space was not a requirement. The room was comfortable and well-appointed (NYC chic). I did take issue with one thing, however. Per the terms of HH Diamond membership, Doubletree properties are supposed to provide internet free of charge to members (either that or breakfast). When I contacted the property, they indicated that I would have to pay the $11 access charge for the internet ... I found that to be irritating, but would not stop me from returning. The location, at 50th & Lex is right in the heart of things, with a subway stop literally right outside the door. The staff was able to direct us to a great little area for a late dinner (midnight on a Sunday night) called Little West 12th St, in the meatpacking district. VERY hip and trendy. Overall a pleasant experience.

<Title>“Good Value”
<Content>Just returned from two night stay at this hotel. As others reviewers posted, the rooms are a bit on the small side, but doable even for a family of four. The bathrooms are small but not as small as I feared. The water pressure in the shower was very good. The location is handy, I walked with my two children to Rockefeller Center, American Girl store and even Times Square (10 blocks). The Metro Cafe down by the lobby is good for quick meals. There's an Ess-a-bagel one block away, and a Starbucks on the corner as well. The hotel (rooms) could have been a little cleaner. The first room we got faced an adjacent building only about 10 feet away. No view at all. That was on the third floor. Requested a change, got a room on the 8th floor overlooking 51st St. Not really a view but something to look at rather than a wall. This room had a bit of an odor so I cracked the window and that took care of it. The beds were comfortable, but small. Double-sized, not queens. So not a lot of room for two. Beware of the cookies if you or your kids have nut allegries. They have walnuts in them. The front desk should tell you this when they hand them out. After being on the road for 4 hours, my kids eagerly took a bite only to have me tell them to spit it out because of the walnuts. Finally, after checking out of the hotel, we asked them to hold our bags as we weren't leaving until later that evening. Maybe this is typical in NY but we were charged $8 for this convenience. Also, no valet parking available here. Overall for the price, a little over $200 per night, a very good deal.

<Title>“Very pleased overall”
<Content>This hotel was just what I was looking for in NY. Good midtown location within walking distance of 5th Ave, with a subway stop literally on the corner that made getting up and down the city very easy. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Everything seemed freshly decorated. Our twin room was nicer than I expected, to be honest - the beds were comfortable and a good distance apart, there was a flat-screen TV, a minibar, a hairdryer, internet access, a safe, and still room for a desk, small chest of drawers and closet. This being NY, I was prepared for a small hotel room but it was actually bigger than I expected. The bathroom is a bit cramped but adequate, with nice water pressure. And the room was pretty quiet (though no where in Manhattan is safe from the sound of sirens). I thought it was good value for the price. Midtown isn't for everyone - it is a bit of a restaurant desert compared to other areas - but if that's the location you're looking for, I'd recommend this.

<Title>“Comfy beds, great location”
<Content>We were in Ney York for 4 days and this was a perfect hotel for our stay. The subway is right outside the door, there are great restauraunts and bars within a 3 block radius. The rooms were clean and big. The beds were very comfortable and we got a very good night sleep. The bathroom was good and in general the space in the room was larger compared to other NY hotels in that price range. The carpets in the common areas look a little worn, otherwise it has a Double Tree feel. Staff were very helpful and informative on suggestions. I would definetly stay here again. We did not eat at the hotel but the bar downstairs is great for a quick drink or a night cap.

<Title>“Nice but Nondescript Midtown Hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the Doubletree last weekend. The location is close to a subway stop with connections on East and West sides, but otherwise in the middle of an office district in Manhattan which means walking several blocks to most restaurants and nighlife. The staff was friendly, the room was large for Mahattan standards but bland with a very small bathroom. I would say it is fine for business travel especially but I wouldn't look to stay again for a weekend getaway. Parking is $30 at the garage around the corner.

<Title>“Nice, safe option for Midtown”
<Content>A group of friends were coming to NYC for a Yankees game and we wanted to stay in Midtown for good proximity to the game and to nightlife -- in the other direction. This place is well located about half a mile walk from Time Square. Getting to the game and Greenwich Village via subway were both pretty easy. The hotel has little local flavor (though the hotel bar isn't bad), but clean and has nice appointments (TV, shower, bed) and the price is not crazy high.

<Title>“Good Location”
<Content>We arrived at the Hotel and checked in at 1 pm the receptionist said they had no Executive King Rooms ready at this time so we said that we would leave our bags and check in later,she then said she had one available on the 16th floor.The Expedia website states these Executive King Rooms are on the 17-18th floor.We went to the room and it was a small queen room.Back in reception I complained about this and was told this was an executive king so I showed the rececptionist the picture on her counter the room I had just viewed and it was a queen room.We were advised to leave our bags in the room and not touch anything and come back at 3pm to guarantee a larger room on the 17th or 18 floor. At 3pm I saw a different receptionist I explained this problem to her and she immediately called for Tony pressumeably her manager who tried to tell me that was what I paid for .Once again after the 3rd time of explaining he offered me 2 rooms to view on the 17th and 19th floor .We took the room 1708 on the 17th floor this room had a king bed and was much larger than the original room.This room was great,clean,tidy and lots of toileteries.Tony later phoned to see if the room was ok and my wife spoke to him and said it was great.Don't let them fob you of with a smaller room than you have paid for.The picture of the Executive King is larger than the real thing.The location is great,subway station on the corner of 51st..Central Park 15min walk..times square 30mins walk.If you have time go shopping to Woodbury Commons its approx 1 hr from the Port Authority Bus Terminal great prices on original designer gear.

<Title>“Doubly disappointed”
<Content>Stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan on Lexington for 5 nights from April 10 and was extremely disappointed. Hotel room was shabby, wardrobe tiny and clearly built in in the 60's - smelled so old we just could not bring ourselves to hang our clothes in it. Bathroom tiny and again maybe was state of the art in the early 60's when the hotel opened but is now dated and missing any sign of luxury. No bath sheets or bath/shower gels, just tiny bath, tiny towels and basic toiletries. During our 5 night stay our room was not tidied once - only the beds were made. Decor drab and dated. Staff were pleasant enough and location is excellent, but no way is this hotel worth the money and for value and comfort it fell way behind any other New York hotel I have stayed in - not a dive but certainly nothing special.

<Title>“Really nothing that positive about the stay”
<Content>Stayed here for 6 nights and really had nothing positive to write about the hotel (perhaps the complimentary cookies at check in). Was visiting NYC for work, and having lived in the city for a while, was looking for a clean room that would give me a quiet night of sleep. On the first day at 8:30am on a Saturday, I was shocked to hear loud drilling, sawing and construction taking place in the adjoining room. Sawdust also seeped through the connecting door into my room which started smelling like a wood shop. Called the front desk who politely apologized and said that there was nothing they could do as it was mission critical work - which I refuse to believe as this was evidently planned for a while given the scale of work. My request to have them wait an hour before I left the room was also denied, though was offered a new room. Spoke to the manager as well, who was apologetic and polite but also concluded that there was nothing that could be done. I was offered a new room but had to wait till the afternoon when one become available - inconveniencing some meetings I had in the afternoon. So clearly, day 1 started on the wrong foot. A security guard also had the nerve to tell me "we take tips here by the way". Unreal. The rest of the trip was average - room was clean, bathrooms shower curtain was old and didn't smell good, walls were thin so neighboring TV's could be heard....basically, am sure there are a lot other hotels in the area and the city for the same price, and I struggle to see why I should recommend this place.

<Title>“There are better hotels just around the corner at a better price”
<Content>As mentioned in other reviews the hotel staff are all very friendly and professional. The room was pretty shabby though. The paint in the bathroom was peeling off the cieling and everything just looks dingy. And this is really small and really picky, but they don't offer room service until 7:00 a.m. and I need to have coffee as soon as I wake up, which was much earlier. I've been to NY a few times on business and I know not to expect what you would get in other cities as far as space and value for the money. But I think this place is a little overpriced as far as quality. The location is great though.

<Title>“Good location but nothing more to say.”
<Content>We stayed here for 5 nights recently and the hotel itself was clean and had been recently updated in the front lobby area. bearing in mind you had a bit of a reality check once you reached your floor and saw the tired looking corridors/walk ways. Having been in Toronto for the previous 4 nights though, we realised how spoilt we'd been with that hotel. On arrival to which we were early we were unsure whether we would be able to check in and didn't expect it, however we were greeted by the receptionist who must had a bad start to the day and had a right face on her!! On checking in, she confirmed to us that we were booked in for 2 nights which we stated at the time was incorrect and that we were actually booked in for 5, this she argued until she actually gave me chance to show the hotel voucher which stated 5. She then proceeded out the back to which my husband and I expected this to have been dealt with on her return, to which we got an all ok and she checked us in gave us a cookie without no have a nice day or nothing. The room was small (which i expected) but clean and fresh, looked at the mini bar but didn't actually touch it realising you only had 20 secs, also some of the stuff looked like it had been on their years!!! Bathroom was ok, small and relatively clean with good assortment of shampoo etc. Best thing was the hairdryer, didn't even unpack mine as this was so good. The crunch came when after 2 nights stay we woke up to find a checking out form underneath our door!! My husband phoned down reception who were adament that we were only booked in for 2 nights and we were checking out that day. Never have i got dressed so quick to resolve this, having already contacted the company who'd organised our trip who confirmed the booking and emails confirmation all stated 5 nights!! The receptionist (different to the one on check in), just kept stating "our system shows 2 nights and you're checking out today" as you can understand things started to get a little strained. Luckily a deputy manager was near and overheard there was a problem and he informed the receptionist what to do and how to approach it, it was then we explained that we'd thought the problem had been resolved on check-in and didn't expect this half way through our stay. At this time the hotel excepted no responsibility for the error whilst they had no proof of the booking document, to which i then spent the next hour on my mobile phoning the UK to get the company to fax over the necessary documents. Even they stated that the hotel were not too helpful as they were ringing them to try and confirm that this had been received!! Finally the DM told us not to worry about this and we should wait till later to see if this had been sorted. A complimentary voucher for breakfast was given as a goodwill to try and appease us, but to us it was a little too late. After this i wouldn't give the hotel the satisfaction of giving them any more of my , Overall after this i was really disapointed with the way we'd been treated and i would have to think strongly about returning here.

<Title>“All around good bargain”
<Content>I was pleasently surprised with this place. We stayed for four nights and had a very good stay. We were placed on a high floor, away from the elevator and without much noise from either neighboring guests or the street. I requested all of these things when we checked in and they delivered. The room was a bit small, but had all the necessary furniture including desk and chair, mini bar and ample storage for clothing and luggage. Everything was clean and well-maintained. The bed was very comfortable and soft. Sheets were clean and soft, and the bed had plenty of blankets and pillows, which was nice as I like lots of pillows. Cookies at check-in were a nice surprise, and all of the staff were accommodating. I would stay here again, I feel it is a good value to stay in NYC, has a premier location in midtown, is clean and spacious enough (it is NYC after all), and has comfortable beds.

<Content>Location is great. just walking distance from 5th avenue and central park and even times square is not that far away if you are not used to do everything by car! Room was spacious and we sat on a corner where the fire cars passed but they didnt make enough noise to awake you. We had a room with a connecting door and that was irritating because you hear everything in the room next to you. So make sure you do not have that! We were on the 4th floor. Bathroom wasn't cleaned very good (hairs in the bath tub). But overall it was decent. We had dinner once because of the bad weather but I wouldn't recommend it. Given prices in NY it is value for money but I think there are better options.

<Title>“The pictures on the web site are very different to the hotel”
<Content>This hotel was under renavations when we went there, but having said that the hotel badly needed to be renevated. This hotel is 4 blocks from Times Square and is not really in the centre if things. The staff are not very accomadationg, and unless you show them money they are not willing to help you. You do have to pay a certain fee to leave your bags into storage while you have checked out of the room. It costs 1 doller per bag and 1 doller per bag when you are taking the bags out plus tip. Its a joke. We choose a double King Size room, non smoking. The duvets that they have, have no covers on them, so we desided to ask downstairs at reception and they said that they wash the duvets each time, but why was our duvet filthy. They replaced the duvet with no cover.We had dinner downstairs and Breakfast it cost €63 dollers for 2 of us for a breakfast.And for the dinner it cost €35. Everything was fried that was on the menu.& very expensive.We were not impressed with the Metropolitan Double Tree New York,Glad to go back home

<Title>“Great location and value”
<Content>We stayed at thie hotel with another couple and all of us thought it was great for the price, and the location couldn't have been better for shopping and seeing most of the sites. The warm cookie I'd heard about at check in is true..and delicious! It seems like certain parts of the hotel have been modernised such as the bedrooms and restaurant/reception area. Our room was spacious and had a massive really comfortable bed with white sheets and was very clean. The hallway was a bit shabby but that didn't matter. A few negatives: you get charged for the mini bar even if you pick something up for more than 20 seconds! You also get charged to store your suitcases if you have a later flight. Only $4 but I've never come across that before. Tips for NYC in general: Great restaurants - Balthazar, McCormick & Schmicks, Nero, and Empire Diner in Chelsea is great for breakfast! Also the Boathouse restaurant in Central Park is definitely worth a visit.

<Content>We booked this through Expedia so the price was right ($153/night for a Saturday) but we would not stay here again. The hotel itself wasn't bad, a little run down (at least the 5th floor was) but the room wasn't ready when we checked in at 1pm and they charged us $4 to hold the bags. Yes, I did read the reviews ahead of time but sometimes you can talk your way out of things although not this time! The bellboy told us that charging for luggage is a 'new trend' in the city however, I have not come across this at any other hotels, in New York or anywhere worldwide. Maybe it's a Hilton thing, because they don't already have enough money, right?! Must be why the prices were so reasonable. That and the bathrooms were literally the size of a small closet, with no exhaust fan. No complaints about the room (other than the ones other reviews mention). Great location though but unfortunately I would not recommend this place to anyone.

<Title>“Great location, nice hotel”
<Content>We've just come home after staying in the Doubletree for 5 nights and i'd say it was what i expected. I'd read some of the reviews and was a little nervous upon arrival being honest, i'm quite fussy - but not in a snobbish way. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a nice welcoming smile from a porter (good start) who directed us to the check in desk. The lady who dealt with us had a face that looked like it was made of stone, and was quite rude. The warm cookie was placed on the counter without saying a word, not even "ENJOY YOUR STAY". But then why should i expect that when she didn't even smile or say hello! Silly as this may sound, she has actually put me off from staying there again! I absolutely hate bad manners!! That was my main gripe about the hotel really, the rooms were modern and more importantly - clean! The mini bar prices were silly, as they are in most hotels, and the hotel bar was pricey, but the decor and surroundings were nice. Nice location, not too close and not too far from the main attractions. I personally wouldn't have liked to have stayed right in the middle of time square, it's too hectic for me, and i'm still young! It's around the corner from the Rockerfeller Centre and SAKS, and there's a metro station almost next door, which is very handy. It's my second time in NYC, and while i had no major problems with the hotel, i would probably try another next time, but in the same location.

<Title>“Was not impressed!!”
<Content>I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan on Feb. 15-17, 2008. I booked the hotel based on reviews, which I will never do again. First, the highlights of the hotel: The location and the warm cookie upon arrival. The following are a list of things that made me come to the conclusion that I will never stay at this hotel again. 1. The king bedroom was very small. (14 floor) 2. The toilet seat was small and plastic. The bathroom was so small when you sat on the toilet one knee touched the door and the other was on the bath tub. 3. The shower was not separate from the tub and when you took a shower the water in the tub raised to the top of the tub. For $600.00 for two nights the hotel should have had a stand up shower. 4. The restaurant inside the hotel prices were ridiculous!!!! A bowel of cold cereal with a banana was $12. Three buttermilk pancakes w/no sides costed $18. 5. The room contain a cold wet bar and a small snack bar. Check this out, the products all had sensors on them and if you picked the product up for more then 20 seconds to actually determine if you wanted to purchase it or not, the hotel charges it to your room. 6. Upon arrival there was a card on the bed from the hotel it stated, "We only clean the bed linen every three days and when you check out, if you would like your linen cleaned before then to let us know." For $600.00 I would like my bed linen washed everyday without making a request. 7. Motels have HBO, the Doubletree only had basic cable and wanted you to pay for movies. For less money the hotel would have been fine however I expected more for my money. I would not recommend this hotel for the price. I saw another review on this site from a person who stayed during the same dates and he only paid $135 per night. That's a good price for the hotel that's all it is worth.

<Title>“Nice and good value”
<Content>I stayed on Fri Feb 15 at the doubletree on lexington/51st in a room with one king bed. Good location by the subway. It was v. clean and comfortable. Clean is always key--and it was. Neutrogena products were available in the bathroom, incl. showercap, facial moisturizer with SPF30, body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, and shower gel. I was in a room on the 16th floor and it was fine. Check-in was fast and they give you a warm cookie when you get there. Overall I liked it and thought it was a terrific value. Somehow I got a great rate of $135 / nite. A few minor things I observed: The pillows were too stiff and I recommend if you can to bring your own pillow. The carpet in the hallway seemed a little worn (ever so slight), and you could hear a few doors open and close at night. (Note: The 2nd floor is under renovation where they have the gym...but its not too bad. The gym had no 3 or 5 or 8 pound weights which was a bummer--but they had plenty of heavier weights for people who like heavy free weights.) They had a lot of treadmills and ellipticals etc.

<Title>“Great location, good value”
<Content>I usually try to stay at Hilton properties since I'm a Gold member and get the "freebies" like complementary breakfast, use of gym, etc.This Doubletree was the best priced of all the Hilton group of hotels in NYC and the location, right off the subway made it a great location, especially since the subway is the one that takes you to the Air Train and JFK (which, at $7.00 for a ride, it's one of the best values in NY). The hotel basically lived up to its other reviews. Staff was attentive and cordial. Room was small, which is typical of NYC. Everything was clean, and the towels were especially plush. Yes, it was noisy outside, but we are in New York, which as an ex-New Yorker I can attest that virtually anywhere in town will be noisy. And yes, you couldn't adjust the heat, but I can recall that no matter where I lived in NY, you couldn't do that either. And if it was too warm I simply opened the window when I got back to my room, aired the room out, closed the window, and was comfortable for the rest of the night. I'd definitely come back again.

<Title>“Great Customer Service”
<Content>I have stayed at the Doubletree on Lexington Avenue a number of times and have always had a good experience. This time however, the experience was excellent. The customer service was outstanding, the staff could not have been more helpful. They answered questions, provided us with more toiletries and upgraded our room on check-in. The room was extremely quiet (we were on the 18th floor) and very clean. I like the fact that rather than bedspreads they have comforters covered with a sheet that can be cleaned after each visit. The bath products were excellend and included face cream and face wash. I like the location because it is within walking distance of Times Square, but is away from the crowds. The hotel is right across from the Waldorf Astoria which has a great bar. There are wonderful neighborhood restaurants nearby on 2nd and 3rd Avenues. One of the best things about the Doubletree hotel is that you get free warm chocolate chip cookies every day.

<Title>“great value and location”
<Content>Just count us as another set of very satisfied customers. Rooms very simple but clean and comfy, and they serve their purpose well (i.e., eight hour breaks between meals, shows, shopping, walking, etc.). Warm welcome, nice bar, perfect spot to reach just about anything in Manhattan via walk/cab/subway. Value for dollar simply can't be beat, and we know having stayed at around 12 different hotels in Manhattan on various deals over the past six years (only one we liked more - Sofitel). Will certainly go back and advocate the Doubletree for anyone that would rather spend their money on food/drinks/cabs/museums then on a hotel room. Only recommended addition would be coffeemaker in the room, but the cart on 55th had the perfect bagel/coffee deal anyways. Only "issue" was the noise factor - rooms are small and close, you can hear doors opening and closing all the time - but in the big picture it wasn't a big deal. Thanks to all the other reviewers for leading us here, we appreciate it!

<Title>“Fabulous Deal for Manhattan”
<Content>Every time I've stayed here, I've had a great experience and the last visit was even better. They upgraded me to a higher floor and the room was so quiet!! The room was a little small for two double beds, but you're not in the room much, so that's fine. The location is perfect walking distance to the Theatre District and next to a subway stop. All of the employees there were very friendly and always helpful.

<Title>“great midtown location, great hotel”
<Content>We stayed 2 nights, Feb 7 and 8, for a weekend in NYC. VERY EFFICIENT check-in. We arrived at noon and a room was ready. The rooms are small, but clean and comfortable. And, really, how much time do you want to spend in your room when you have NYC outside to explore? We booked on the hotel website with an AAA rate for less than $200 per night. Parking is only $30 a night (good rate for Midtown) and the website driving directions get you right to the garage. The hotel has a cool retro 60s decor and it works - the lobby and bar are great looking spaces. A subway stop right on the corner, good take-out sandwiches also on the corner, and Belgian chocolates (Neuhaus) between the corner and hotel entrance. NYC is a great walking city and the Doubletree is centrally located. For an interesting walking tour of the East Village, try ---.com. Anecdotal, historical facts about NYC punk/rock moments and entertaining host!

<Title>“Nearly Perfect”
<Content>We were very pleased with our stay at the Doubletree. We arrived there after a long International flight and were very tired. The front desk checked us in quickly and efficiently. For some unknown reason we were upgraded to a mini suite. Nice surprise. The warm cookies at check-in were a plus. Our room was comfortable and clean. When we checked out we mentioned the good cookies and we were given two more "for the road". Excellent service from the front desk. The location of the hotel is excellent. There is a subway station practically outside the front door. I only have one complaint. We were charge per bag to store our luggage for two hours the next day. I have never been charged to store luggage in any hotel I've ever stayed in. Usually a tip is all that is expected. Here they charge per bag and also expect a tip. I would have scored this hotel "excellent" if it weren't for their baggage storage policy.

<Title>“Beware of Extra Costs!!!”
<Content>After staying in various hotels on the west coast i booked this hotel after reading pretty good reviews on Trip Advisor. Let me say right now that maybe all NY hotels run this way but i was shocked at all the extra's i had to pay what seemes a lot of extra...which i did not find in any of the west coast hotels we stayed in on our trip. The room itself was ok, the bathroom tiny and the decor in the bathroom poor (peeling paint on ceiling etc). Having spent a week in L.A i was used to tipping but this seemed crazy! Here is a list of costs........ Mini Bar broken....anything we wanted we had to order from room service......and tip the staff! No water in the room...2 small bottles 12 dollars! (free in all the previous hotels on our stay) Internet...24 hours 12 dollars! (free in all the previous hotels on our stay) Needed to print 1 page of a receipt for a tour of NY...3 dollars! (free in all the previous hotels on our stay) Leave bags at hotel as we had a later flight after check in...Had to pay to leave the bags and pay to pick them up again!!!!(free in all the previous hotels on our stay) As i said before..perhaps this is how hotels work in NY but to be honest it left a sour taste in my mouth as it felt like at every turn someone wanted to make a quick buck out of us . The hotel itself is not great..nice reception and ground floor but once the elevator doors open on your level.....its a different story. I know it is confusing on Trip advisor....one person says great...the other says [-]....but trust me......NY has better places i am sure!

<Content>This hotel was great value for the location - it was very central and within walking distance of many attractions. Our room was clean, with good decor and comfy beds, although some small details were a little shabby and the bathroom could do with some updating. The reception area and bar looked great, with a brilliant contemporary design. Overall a good stay and excellent value!

<Title>“Not Bad”
<Content>My friend and I stayed here for a quick weekend trip and didn't expect much, what with the incredibly low rate we got through AAA. But we were both really surprised by the hotel's appearance (we expected a dump and it was anything but) and staff (incredibly friendly and very helpful). Of course, getting delicious cookies whenever we asked for them -- and it was often -- made the stay even more enjoyable. Not to mention the really comfortable beds and the incredible location. The only downsides were the food (which wasn't great but truly okay) and the bathrooms (pretty small and not so updated). But if you actually want to feel like you're actually getting something for your money in NYC? Than I'd recommend this hotel.

<Content>I stayed in the Doubletree for 4 weeks on business. The rooms were clean, the staff were friendly (and gave me cookies) and everything worked. The bar downstairs was great! The food in the on-site restaurant wasn't as great as some of the restaurants in NYC, but it was definitely above average for a hotel restaurant. The location was fab with the subway near by and Times Square a good 20 minute walk away.

<Title>“Dont Beleive The Bad Reviews!!!”
<Content>My Fiance and I and My Parents stayed at this hotel over the New Year '07. After reading mixed reviews I was a little anxious about staying here but the feeling disapeared as soon as we stepped into the hotel. After a long flight and a very long trip from the airport to the hotel we were exausted and relieved that the check - in was quick and easy and the staff were more than happy to help with the luggage, and not forgetting the yummy cookies we had on arrival. After seeing our room we were very pleased with the size (from what I hear hotel rooms can be small in New York) the bed was enormous and very comfy! As my birthday was on New Years Eve the waiter even got 3 rounds of drinks on the house! Yes the hotel is next door to the Fire Department but with air con in the room you did'nt need the window open therefore never heared them. During the stay we were waited for on hand and foot by the staff. Checking out was also fast and they even gave us more yummy cookies as I kept on about them throughout the whole trip. So dont beleive the bad reviews the hotel is really nice and situated nicely in the city. I would recommend it to anyone, would definetly stay here again!!

<Title>“Great hotel would go back again”
<Content>Me and my husband have just come back from new york. It was my first trip there and our stay at the doubletree did not disappoint. Upon arrival at 1pm we got checked in very quickly and even got a room upgrade free of charge, we were very happy that our room was already available for us as we were early. The hot cookies on arrival was a really welcoming touch. Our room was on the 5th floor and had a great view over lexington avenue. The room was spacious and extremely clean and considering how close we were to the front of the building noise was not a problem for us. Of course there is noise you are in new york after all but we had no problem sleeping especially with such comfortable beds. It is right next to the subway which is great to get to anywhere in the city. The staff were very helpful and gave great advise on things to do and places to go. On return from a long day our room had been cleaned and fresh towels in the bathroom. Bathrooms are a bit small but what else to you need to do apart from shower in a clean and tidy bathroom. On our departure check out was quick and easy and one of the door men had organised a car to take us back to JFK airport for about $54 which saved us getting a taxi and gave us a very comftable ride. In hole we will have no hesitation in staying in the doubletree on our return to new york. If you are looking for things to do the hotel gives discount on things like helicopter trips which was fantastic and they will book any trip you want for you and also make reservations for restaurants. I would recommend trying out a place call serendipity, we had a lovely meal and you have to try one of there famous frozen hot chocolates, they are gorgeous. Also the Olive Garden in times square is a really good place to eat if you like Italian food. If you are wanting to see a show get your tickets from TKTS beside the Marriot in times square they do great prices but can be busy, they open from 3-8pm.

<Title>“Great Stay! Will go back again”
<Content>Room was clean, quiet and comfortable. Exactly what I needed after shopping and walking around NYC. The staff was very helpful and I loved the cookies at night. Subway entrance is conveniently located nearby. Rooms are on the small side, OK for just the 2 of us. The mini-bar has sensors in it and will charge you for an item if not returned to it's slot within 20 seconds, I found that out when I checked out and saw $10 charge on my bill. I had taken out their items and put my own in to keep them cool. The front desk removed the charge, but they should put a sign in the room or inform you at check-in what the deal is. I liked that they stored our luggage after we checked out, so we could have a few more hours in the city. We returned, picked up our luggage and took the subway to the train station.

<Title>“Just Had A Good Stay Here!”
<Content>We got this hotel for a ridiculously cheap price- a queensize room for three nights for 350 USD for the three nights- a bargain!! Still after reading some reviews here we were abit wary of what to expect when we arrived. We were pleasantly surprised- hotel was in a super location in a very nice area of Manhattan and so close to everything! Lovely staff let us check in at 11AM- couldnt believe they had a room ready for us at that time- we were very impressed! Room was very small but very clean. Good selection of channels on the television and the safe was really handy to have in the room. The hotel restaurant was very expensive so we didnt eat there- the cafe next door does a very resonably priced breakfast which was delicious!Overall we felt we really got value for money staying here however the room was very small and I think if we had paid any more for our stay we would have been disappointed. Also a quick note- the hotel website says hotel has had a very expensive renovation-however our room was obviously a old room that had received a lick of paint and some new furniture-the bathroom tiles were broken in places and the paint chipped off the door and doorframes. Plus the halls leading to the rooms were grubby with large patches of wallpaper missing in places- i think whoever did the renovation didnt do a very high quality job of it and as a regular Hilton hotels visitor there was no comparision between this and other Hiltons I have stayed at.

<Title>“Only if the price is right!”
<Content>Hotels in NYC are never cheap and are often way over priced. Although the Doubletree Metropolitan is a decent hotel with an excellent location, I would not recommend spending more than $200 a night. The hotel's positive attributes did not influence me to think it was more than your standard hotel. The room was clean and the staff was accomodating, helpful and friendly. A major plus is the loaction on Lexington Ave and the proximity to major attractions and a subway stop. Unfortunately the TV in my room didn't work, but I didn't bother to address this issue since I was only staying for one night. Aside from the TV, I had no problems with my accomodations and enjoyed my stay.

<Title>“Not worth even the discounted Christmas Eve rate!”
<Content>There were so many mixed reviews on this hotel - either people loved or hated it. I decided to cross my fingers and went ahead and booked a room for Christmas Eve as they were running extremely low rates for that night. Needless to say, by the following day, I felt sorry for any traveler who paid a penny more than me. The Front Desk Representative who checked me in was not the least bit friendly. In fact, she seemed bothered by my inquiry to upgrade my room for a fee (I didn't mind paying but she had an attitude over having to go through the trouble of looking it up on her system). When that didn't work out, I asked to switch my room from a King to two doubles and that set off more sighs from the Rep. I don't even think she finished looking it up in the system, she just told me that she was going to give me the room I booked (King). When I asked for a roll-away bed, she told me they charge $50 for it. By that time, I had it with her negative attitude and snapped back at her. She then left the front desk and when she returned, she told me that her Manager was going to waive the $50 charge but that I should know in the future, there would definitely be a charge (like I would consider going back there after the way she represented the Doubletree). I checked in at 1:00 PM and assumed that they would be bringing the roll-away bed at some point. My family and I hit the town and came back at 5:00 PM. Still no bed so I placed a phone call to the Front Desk who told me they don't handle roll-away beds, I needed to call Housekeeping. I called the Housekeeping Extension and Housekeeping told me I would have to call the Customer Care desk. The Customer Care desk stated they would send Housekeeping right up with it. In the meantime, I ventured over to the Concierge’s desk to see if they could help make a dinner reservation for me. The Rep. was very short with me and said that all places in the area were booked. I would have to chance a walk in. Not much help there, just more of the Doubletree unfriendly attitude! An hour later I went back to my room and still no bed. Called a 2nd time to the Customer Care desk and same Rep. answered the phone. She apologized and stated she would contact Housekeeping again and have the bed sent right away. I knew we were planning on being out late and wanted to have the bed set up so my son could go right to sleep. We left for dinner assuming the bed would be delivered as promised, after all, it had been 2 hours since we were first told it would be delivered right away. We came back from dinner at 9:30 PM and par for the course, the bed still had not arrived. Yet there was a message on our phone from the same Customer Care Rep. stating she hoped by the time we received the message, our bed would have arrived. I called back down to her, but her shift had ended and I had to start all over with a new Customer Care Rep. who didn't know I was waiting for anything. She too promised to contact Housekeeping and get the bed to me right away. That "right away" ended up taking another 90 minutes. Besides all of the Customer Service issues we experienced, the room itself had an odor to it. I laughed when I looked at the bathtub area and noticed exactly what was mentioned in another Tripadvisor review, the black mold was simply painted over in many spots throughout the stall and the ceiling. We opted not to even shower at the hotel (which is rare for hygiene conscious people like us) and wait until we got back home that morning. What's sad is that on our way to the Doubletree, we walked past our favorite chain hotel, Marriott and my husband asked me why I didn't book there. I told him the rate at the Doubletree was too good to not try-out. Unfortunately, I learned the hard way that "you get what you paid for." Despite the dismal hotel experience, NYC was fabulous and if you go, there is a fantastic Italian Restaurant called "San Martin" on 49th Street that we ate at. They were reasonably priced (especially for NYC), the food was delicious and the staff were all so hospitable! Not a single one seemed to mind that he/she had to work on Christmas Eve!

<Title>“Great Location - Good size room for NYC”
<Content>If you ever stayed in a hotel in NYC, you know that size matters. Most hotel rooms are based on the 'closest' principle. 'If it fits, than what's your problem?'. The room we got was specious, modern and spotless. Nice flat-screen TV and simple but functional bathroom with over sized shower head. Cons: No view from window, other than the windows of some other hotel or dormitory. Price is always to high in NYC pros: Very sound proof. It wasn't until I opened the window that I heard what I was NOT hearing! Great! Location

<Title>“okay but a bit tired”
<Content>on the whole this hotel is fab for location. it is though looking a bit tired. beds and pillows were lovely and comfortable. bathrooms are tiny and needing work, plaster peeling off the walls and such like. in fact the toilet flooded the second night we were there so had to be moved to another room - with no help from staff to carry luggage - this other room being at the other end of the hotel where the painter and decorators were stripping the walls. the safe was not unlocked on arrival, so we could not use it, and so reported it at the desk and told that it would be sorted straight away, it wasn`t, so had to again report it the following morning and insist that security came immediately so that we did not have to carry passports and money around with us all day. security did then arrive about 10 minutes later, and was unlocked within 10 seconds. check-in was painless as was the express checking-out. staff were polite and helpful, with all this said, i would probably stay here again if only for the location. it was an okay stay, as long as you don`t expect too much.

<Title>“Good Hotel, Great Loaction !”
<Content>The Doubletree Metropolitan is a good hotel in a great location. I have stayed at this hotel on and off for over 5 years. I used to live in Manhattan and always stay at the Metropolitan when my husband and I go back to visit. We always get a AAA rate thru the hotel website. Well worth it ! We stayed right before Christmas for only $220 a night including taxes ! You can't beat it. The rooms are less than average size but you don't go to NYC to spend time in your room. The rooms are always clean, the bedding is very comfortable, and the staff has always been very friendly and helpful. The location is what is key. Only a 10-15 minute walk from Times Square. But the hotel is also located right on the subway line for the E,V, and 6 lines. Perfect for heading to Little Italy, Chinatown, Soho, or the Village. I have never eaten at the hotel restaurant or the coffee shop attached. I do think the restaurant is overpriced. For anyone staying here do yourself a favor and either walk over to 3rd or 2nd Ave. There are other more reasonable deli's, coffee shops, pubs, and restaurants. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Its a great deal for Manhattan !

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>We travelled to the Doubletree in December 2007. We have stayed at this hotel before many times on visits to NYC. This time was no different and again we had no problems at all with our stay here. Check in was very quick (especially for a busy time of the year) The free Cookies are always a bonus and appreciated after a 7 hour flight and plane food. The location is great we only took one cab during our 4 night stay (apart from airport runs) The rooms are always clean and tidy and are a generous size for NYC. For location and price I would always recommend someone to stay at this hotel. I know we will be staying here again when we come back.

<Title>“great staff, normal size rooms”
<Content>Booked on lastminute.com we got a great rate for the week before Christmas. The staff of the Dobuletree were extremely friendly and helpful....more so than normal at any large city hotel. The room wasn't huge, but was plenty big enough. Great location...walking distance to everything and a subway stop on the corner.

<Content>At check in the staff were very nice and offered us a free upgrade of our room, the warm chocolate cookies were delicious!!!! :) The bellman who helped us to our room was kind and helpful. The doorman offered us a pleasant smile everytime we came in or left the hotel. This vacation was a dream come true for us and the Doubletree made it even more special.

<Title>“Expected better - in bad need of a renovation”
<Content>Stayed on Dec 23rd and 24th. Location was great. Nearby to everything without being right in the heat of the craziness. About a twelve - fifteen minute hike or so to Times Square. Staff was phenomenal, made sure that we were taken of. Gave us extra hot cookies when we asked (a DoubleTree special). Price was great, huge AAA discount. The bad: the room and hallways. We stayed on the sixth floor. The trim was falling off, the hallways smelled, the carpets were visibly stained, and just about every single door looked like it had been through a college dorm party. The inside wasn't much better, ceiling was peeling and the paint was falling off. The carpet in the room needed a steam clean. The lighting was poor, the window shade wouldn't go down all the way. Most of these complaints you've seen on other responses as well. If you're really not picky or you're used to motel type rooms, you can definitely manage here. All in all I was pleased, but bottom line - the place is in bad need of a renovation. If I HAD to I would stay here again, but why bother when it's NYC. Go for the much better located and nicer Hyatt. Better value too. I don't have photos because other reviews have accurate photos showing the damage.

<Title>“Nice room, great staff”
<Content>I selected the Doubletree for a one-night business trip, for which I needed to be in the area. There was a choice of rooms and rates available on the website, with a higher rate for a room with a 24-hour cancellation policy -- I believe their regular requirement was seven-day cancellation. The doorman was immediately attentive to my arrival, even though he was busy, welcomed me, and handed my bag off to a bellman. There was a hostess (for lack of a better term) in the lobby, who also welcomed me and pointed me to an available front desk person for check-in, which was friendly and efficient. The bellman who accompanied me with my bag was friendly as well, and covered the hotel facilities in detail for me. The room was somewhat larger than I expected for New York City, clean, with a flat-screen TV. There was a sort of mini-sofa in addition to the king bed, and sufficient room to set my suitcase up as well. The bathroom was adequate, with enough counter size for my shaving kit; tub/shower and toilet were in a separate room. The shower head was high enough -- I hate the hotel shower head aimed at my chest -- and produced plenty of hot water with little wait. The view was of the buildings across Lexington. There was a minibar with snacks and a couple of mystery boxes -- I picked one up (it was a sewing kit, label side down) spotted the sensor, and put it right back down -- not quickly enough, apparently. You supposedly have 20 seconds on this one -- they've apparently been devalued, too. (More later about this.) I had to get a cab at 6PM, almost impossible in New York, and the bellman found something for me -- he didn't just stand and whistle, but went out in the middle of the intersection to grab one. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was fine: good selection, excellent service. There was a coffee shop as well, full of New Yorkers grabbing a cup en route to the office. I don't usually fix coffee in my room, so I didn't really miss a coffeemaker; I'm sure others will. Checkout was efficient: again, the "hostess" asked me if the bill slipped under my door was sufficient (it wasn't) and directed me to an open position. Friendly service again -- I had been charged $7.50 plus tax(es), twice for the minibar. OK, once for the sewing kit, but I have no idea what the second could have been. Both were removed from my bill -- apparently this isn't uncommon. I'd wanted a hotel where I could check in quickly, get to my dinner, have a good sleep, hot shower and good breakfast, and quick check-out. The Doubletree gave me all of that, with the plus of a uniformly friendly staff. Just watch out for the hair-trigger minibar.

<Title>“Nice but noisy in NY”
<Content>We stayed for 3 nights. The hotel staff was very accomodating. We stayed on the 18th floor ( only 19 floors), we had to move rooms after the first night due to some renovations on the top floor. We ended up being in a balony king suite, there wasnt a view, just buildings across the street. The room was nice, toliet-shower area is very tiny! The bed was very comfortable. The door to the balcony didnt block out much noise. I was woken up 3 times by a fire truck and police cars, there is a fire station down the street from the hotel. I was woken up also by banging etc above us, not sure if it was construction, but it almost sounded as if someone was dropping shoes or something above our room. The breakfast at the hotel was just ok, the hot food was cold and the cold food (milk) was warm. We had 2 free coupons for breakfast, but its isnt worth the money if you do pay. Overall the staff was helpful, and the rooms were clean.

<Content>We stayed at the Doubletree for a weekend getaway. From the moment we arrived we were very happy. The service is incredible. The location cannot be beat. Easy walking distance to Rockefeller Center and shopping along 5th Avenue. There's also a subway station right out front! The room was spacious and clean. We have no complaints at all. We'll be staying there again.

<Title>“Not My Favorite But Okay”
<Content>I love NYC and I ventured from my favorite dive - The Milford Plaza - and splurged for this hotel at $450 a night. THE GOOD: Comfy Bed Great Staff Decent Location Nice Mini-Bar / Room Service THE BAD: Desk Crammed up Against Bed Overpriced Not as spotless as it could be Location quite expensive (even for NYC!) Would I stay again? I doubt it. I am a lover of Broadway and I think I would have rather spent $150 less per night and stayed at the Milford which is in my opinion, smaller, dirtier and the very best location to be in - Times Square!

<Title>“Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
<Content>My family and I spent 2 nights at the Doubletree Metropolitan on 51st & Lexington for the Thanksgiving holiday. This place is terrific. We booked a junior suite on the 18th floor. The hotel was very accomodating and fulfilled our request for a room with a private terrace. The room was clean. The bed was super comfortable. The junior suite was very large and suited a family of three nicely. Bathroom a bit "tight" but not a deal-breaker. If anyone is considering this hotel - don't hesitate. You'll love it.

<Title>“New York New York”
<Content>Stayed for seven nights with my girlfriend, check in was fast and friendly when we got to our room it was really nice, quite spacious with a desk flat screen tv and chair. Every day our room was cleaned and our bed made up perfectly. The hotel staff were always helpful and polite, the bar was pretty pricey but I found that about most bars in New York. We stayed on the fith floor and it was quite noisy but we still slept ok. When we checked out there were a few items on our mini bar bill I was unsure about so I asked reception about them and they knocked them off without question. Will stay there again but maybe on a higher floor. There is a handy gift shop inside the hotel for any gifts you need papers sweets etc. We didnt eat once from the hotel as there are so much places to eat nearby.

<Title>“Highly Disappointed”
<Content>To say the least I was extremely disappointed and soooo very glad we only stayed 1 nite. I was traveling with my 3 daughters. Our check in was wonderful. Very nice and helpful person checked us in. She alleged she was giving us an upgrade to a deluxe rom but if it was deluxe I would hate to see the standard room. It was extremely small (even by New York standards). Cleanliness was so so. We were in our room a few minutes and preparing to go and visit the city when an unknown man entered our room with a pass key and quickly excused himself when he realized someone was in the room. He did not have a uniform or identify himself as an employee. I immediately called the front desk and they had security contact me. They took my information and said they would check into it. Over the next few minutes I found a maid and located who the man was. He was working for the hotel but not wearing a uniform and had no ID on him. I went downstairs and located the head of security. He had done nothing to try and found out who this was. Luckily it was an employee because they did not to care about our safety. When we returned later that nite around 11:15 pm and in desperate need of showers to go to bed we discovered the shower did not work. It took over an hour to get it operational and I had to be extremely demanding with management. A very long day for 3 young girls. They were not cooperative with trying to find us an alternate room until after they confirmed our shower was repaired. I had requested additional towels and they forgot to send them up. Needless to say when we moved to the Hilton New York the following day for our remaining 2 nites we were elated. We had only booked this 1 nite at the Doubletree because the Hilton New York was sold out that nite. Never again. Beware!

<Title>“Decent - some good and some bad”
<Content>Stayed at the Doubletree for one night. The good: Room is spacious - rather large for New York standards. Had a comfortable bed, nice desk, nice loung chair and a flat screen TV. The shower was wonderful, lots of pressure and hot water. The bad: Room was noisy. I could hear everything going on on my floor. Could hear doors slamming down the hall. So sound proofing is a big issue here. Secondly, the shades on the windows are bad. They do not completely block light coming into the window - there is a nice gap in between the shades. Thus, you can't get total privacy and block out light. Other bads, service was pretty terrible. Didn't get my wake up call. Unenthusiastic check in. Overall, if you need a clean bed and a hot shower, stay there, but otherwise, look around

<Title>“Great hotel. Great Location”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our first trip to NYC. We thought the hotel was great. The rooms were clean and comfortable and larger than what imagined. The hotel staff were very quick and friendly upon check-in and check-out. We liked the contemporary/retrto-chic decor of this hotel. Although our room faced the street, we were surprised that we didn't hear too much street noise. Bathrooms were tiny but probably comparable to most NYC hotel rooms. The hotel was in a safe area and walking distance to Times Square, Rockafeller Plaza, and Central Park. Subway station was right outside the front door and we had no probelms or any wait to get a cab. I just got done reading the other reviews of this property. The other reviewers obviously had high, unrealistic expectations for a hotel in the heart of Manhattan. Yes, hotels rooms are small in the city. Yes, sometimes you can hear the street traffic. Yes, all mini bar items in any hotel room, in any city are going to cost you a small fortune. Anyways, who goes to NYC to sit in their hotel room and eat from the mini bar? I would recommend this hotel over Times Square hotels because you don't have to battle crowds to get in and out. You also are not battling other people for cabs and are not sitting in bumper to bumper traffic once you catch a cab. We were very happy with our room and would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Title>“Not great !”
<Content>Just returned from a 5 day trip to New York. When we arrived our room was not ready so the four of us had one drink each in the hotel bar which cost a fortune! Eventually got to the room and was disappointed to find no coffee/tea facilities(apparently learnt later the hotel is taxed if you have this in the room) a free token to use at the cafe bar next to the hotel wouldn've been nice. There was however a minibar and a tray containing pringles, nuts, bottled water, and chocolates , all at a cost I hastened to add. Our room was on the back of the hotel looking straight onto the kitchens of another hotel where hotel/kitchen staff hung out for their breaks so we had to keep the blinds down for privacy. The room was small and the bathroom tiny. The shower was a nightmare to use. To add insult to injury on the last day I was billed for two items from the snack tray, which I had not had. Receptionist told me the tray the items were resting on had sensors and had I read the note nestling among the items , I would've been aware should you remove an item for more then 20 seconds it assumes you have purchased it! I explained I had not had the charge items in fact they all items were still on the tray, I got the items removed from my bill but No apology. On the last day they even charged you to put your luggage in the luggage room . A charged was made for each bag left in and they charged you to get them out again. Needless to say this sums up in my opinion the ethos of the Hotel nothing was free not even a cup of coffee. Have a nice Day!

<Title>“Doubletree's Metropolitan Hotel Grows Rotten Fruit”
<Content>My Review of Doubetree Metropolitian Hotel Stayed one night in Sept 2007 I unfortunately decided to stay at this hotel. It seemed like a good deal at the time. A little over $200 for a hotel in Manhattan. One with it's own bathroom. Not bad. But, alas, many things were wrong. 1. I was told I had a room with a view. Unless you consider a large building blocking out all the sun and anything else to see a view, I would strongly disagree. A park, that's a view. A landscape of city lights, that's a view. A river, that's a view. A slab of concrete? Not a view. Also, I should not, that when I did open up my blinds there was a scotch-taped sign on the window that read something to the effect of, "Construction is going on outside this building. You might want to keep your blinds closed because construction workers will be looking in." So, even if there was a view-- they were trying to get me not to see it anyway. Hey, maybe they thought the scotch-taped sign was the view! It did have nice font. 2. The air-conditioner wasn't working. So, I do have to admit I did have a sauna in my room which was an unexpected treat. Well, not really much of a treat since the sauna was the entire room. They never sent someone up as promised, and wouldn't respond to my request to change a room. Maybe the entire hotel was just rooms of saunas. 3. The next morning upon check out to find a better hotel, which would at this point have meant a park bench, I spoke to a "manager" (he had a tag that read "manager" but considering his inability to manage maybe he got them at a a real manager at a hotel he stayed at the way a kid gets those plastic pilot wings from the real captain on a plane). This "manager" had a "so sad, too bad" attitude. He actually tried to tell me that the room I had did indeed have a view. "Slabs of concrete are very popular views in New York City. You're very lucky to have had a room with that kind of view!" When I told him about the sauna, he tried to charge me extra because I was not supposed to get a room with a sauna. He didn't even realize any of their rooms had personal saunas. Okay, I exaggerate a bit. But this next part I don't. He actually asked me if I knew how to turn on the air-conditioner. That perhaps I didn't know how to switch the button from "off" to "on" and it was my fault and not the hotels. Granted, I'm no rocket scientist, but I have learned how to do that. Even the desk guy was shocked at this question, probably because the "manager" had the nerve to ask it twice. Possibly he thought I could not only not turn things "on" but that I didn't understand the english language. Sure, I speak with a NJ/NY accent but I was in NY and I have a very good command of NY language. I can say; "Not for nothin," and "are you gonna eat that," with the best of them. And I can most certainly understand lame questions because I know live in LA. My suggestion to anyone wanting to stay at this hotel is to check yourself into Bellevue first because you need to have your head examined.

<Title>“Loved the Doubletree - would definitely stay again!”
<Content>Myself and my husband stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan for 5 nights in late August. The warm cookies on check in were a God send! Just what we needed. We were in room 1629 which is in the back of the hotel but we weren't bothered - there was very little street noise - only heard a fire engine once. The staff were extremely friendly. The room was big. Bathroom was small but the Neutrogena products made up for that. Bed was extra comfy. Really liked this hotel and would definitely stay there again. It's just up a block (and around a corner) from the Waldorf Astoria on Park Avenue where there is a stop for the Hop On Hop Off Buses - way better than the subway - you get to see so much more of New York. The Metro Cafe beside hotel was great aswell and the food good. All in all had a great trip - so much so had to buy an extra suitcase going home but there was a suitcase shop just down the street so how handy was that!!! :)

<Title>“Nice place, nice location”
<Content>Just got back from a weekend trip to the Big Apple and enjoyed our stay at the Doubletree in Midtown (51st & Lexington). I had a tough time finding a hotel in this area for under $200 a night - the Doubletree was just under that (about $180), the pictures on the website looked nice and the hotel reviews seemed pretty positive so I went ahead and booked this hotel. I'm glad we chose to stay here. The room was spacious (for a Manhattan hotel in this price range), clean, well-decorated, modern bath fixtures, the bed was VERY comfortable, nice flat screen tv, great massaging showerhead. Warm cookies at check-in was a treat. Staffed security guard at elevators after dark asked to see our room key before allowed onto the elevators, nice to feel safe. Shortcomings: $10.95 for internet access, lacked in electrical outlets, limited counter space/storage space/places to hang towels in bathroom, fire station down the block. Great area of Midtown to stay, though. Easy walk to United Nations, Rockafeller Center, Fifth Ave shopping, little further to Times Square but still walkable. I would stay here again.

<Title>“Rooms need updating and attitudes are poor.”
<Content>This hotel is in a great location. The common areas look like they have been recently renovated, but the rooms are about 10-15 years behind schedule. I am Hilton Honors Gold and booked my reservation through the Hilton reservation line. Booked a king with a roll-away and was told that the roll-away would be $20 for the trip, not per night and my email confirmation stated this also. Upon arrival, reminded them about the roll-away and was told that the roll-away was $50/night. I showed them my email confirmation and they said that was incorrect. I asked to speak to the manager on duty and his attitude was the worst. Acted like he was doing us a favor by speaking to us, so I called Hilton from my cell phone and explained the situation. Soon enough the manager was taking a call from corporate and we were comped the roll-away and breakfast each morning. There are 100's of hotels in NYC, so to have a poor attitude only turns people away from returning. I will stay at Hilton properties again, but not this particular property.

<Title>“Basic hote but Great Location”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel on a short city break with my husband . The hotel was on lexington ave and ideally located for all the major attractions. The Chrysler Building and Empire State building were only a few blocks away along with 5th ave with all the designer shops including Tiffany & Co and Bloomindales.Times square was also only a few blocks away all within walking distance once you have worked out how the blocks are set out the city is very easy to negotiate. We used the subway to get to the Financial District to see ground zero and wall street. This way really easy and much quicker than a taxi as the roads are gridlock. We went to see Chicago which was fantastic Melanie Griffiths was playing Roxy and we really enjoyed it. New York is such a vibrant city with lots to do and see . We loved it and are going back in Dec this year to take my son. The hotel was quite basic but to be honest it was clean & modern and was going through some kind of refurbishment at the time but this did not disrupt our stay . I would recommend visting a shop called century 21 opp ground zero has lots of great designer goods D&G , Tommy Hilfiger , Guess etc as really cheap prices.

<Title>“An industrial hotel”
<Content>If you don't mind industrial accommodation - it's quite all right, but if you're seeking a little more homey feeling in a hotel - you won't find it there. Small rooms, staff that underscores the feeling you're just one of their thousand guests and past century decoration. Considering their rates - it's not a good deal.

<Title>“In need of a major overhaul”
<Content>My travel agent booked me in here again. I reviewed it last time and was not polite but here was a chance to be surpised, Sadly I wasn't. The good things are the location, which is excellent (and right next to my office which is why I get booked here) and the rooms are reasonably spacious for New York. But this place is so tired. To give you a flavour - the bathroom has a tin sink set in a white plastic worktop. There are rawlplugs sticking out of the tiles where previous fixtures have fallen out of the walls. The tap is barely hanging on to the wall. The bedroom was OK - clean and all the usual facilities but very tired. And this Doubletree idea of presenting you with a warm cookie as you arrive - it feels so out of date. Here I am after a long flight checking in late - what I really want from a receptionist is to give me a warm soggy cookie - I don't even open the bag before it goes into the trash. And all yours for $300 - its not as if its budget.

<Title>“Avoid this hotel”
<Content>Computer system was down all day so we could not check in until after 5:00 and that was after waiting in line for an hour. No offer of a comp of any type. Room was dirty. Discovered this after we got in at 1:30 AM. Sheets were stained and the bathroom had not been cleaned. Had to change rooms at 2:00 AM with no assistance with luggage. Were not told that we had breakfast included. New room had broken lights that were never fixed during our stay (despite calling the front desk). The remote had no batteries and this was also not fixed despite calls to the front desk. When we checked out we weren't even apologized to much less given any type of discount for the filthy room and room switch at 2:00 AM. Many better places to stay in NYC. Do not stay here.

<Content>The people at the front desk were awesome, extremely friendly. The bar was all set up for the Super Bowl and they gave us extra food for free when we ordered our appetizer. The room had an awesome view...the room was very nice, the bed was the best!! Parking was simple and easy. My husband and I would definitely stay there again with or without the kids. Ps. Gene Simmons stayed their too. :)

<Title>“Not What We Expected”
<Content>This being our first time to NYC, my boyfriend and I really wanted to stay at a nice place. We were there from July 5th to July 10th. This hotel being in an "ideal" location and looked very nice, we were sold. Upon arriving we were pretty impressed. Our room looked nice, the service was great, I even boasted to my boyfriend how great of taste I had. Unfortunately later on he would have the uper hand. The first night we found out how noisy it was. You heard perfectly the people showering above us. We can't really complain about the noise outside as it IS NYC, but I do not recommend staying on the Lexington St. side. Going through our room and walking down the hall, we were really let down. The wall paper in the halls were peeling, and the siding was falling off of the wall. Our room had water damage and beside the sink vanity looked like it was never cleaned. *we got that taken care of after 3 calls*. Our large lamp also did not work, and even after the housekeeping lady tried it infront of us, it was never fixed. Also, the ice machine and "vending machines" which was a single pop machine was the scariest site we both saw. Located in a dark, dirty room by the service elevators and janitors closet, there was garbage, old mops and broken equiptment everywhere. I definately did not go back and made my poor boyfriend make that "lovely" trip. Our "anti-slip" tub was anything but after my boyfriend took a nasty spill and still has the lump to prove it. Please get the bathmat offered if you call. Though the room service was friendly, the food was HORRIBLE. We had breakfast one morning, and then went to the restaurant the next, and both were very bad experiences. We left our room on the 3rd day by 11am and when we returned at 6pm that evening, our room was not cleaned. If we didn't have a broadway to go to that night, we would have to wait outside the room while it was cleaned or wait until the next day. Our "stocked" mini bar was never stocked even when we called 3 times. Unfortunately the only real "plus" we could think of for this hotel was the cookies. They are delicious! haha but other than that, we left unsatisfied. The hotel looks wonderful and the rooms amazing, until you really look at what you're paying for. Perhaps if we coughed up the money to stay in a guest suite or one of the larger rooms *we had a queen, non-smoking*, but I wouldn't risk the money. I only wish I took photos to back up my experience. The photos already taken though give a good impression on what it is like. The rooms are nice looking, but falling apart.

<Title>“Great Stay”
<Content>If you are looking for a great place to stay, close to everything this is it. Overall my husband and I stayed for 4 nights and we had no real complaints. Pricey- yes, but I did a whole lot of research and for the price range the Doubletree is one of the better options- the Ritz no, but its DEFINATELY NOT a dump for the money. Where the rooms large no, but most New York hotels have the same problem, the room was clean,the bed comfortable, and the service was good. The staff made every effort to make us feel welcome. The location is excellent- you are in walking distance of everything, and your options for shopping and meals are endless. For a cheap breakfast the Oxford Cafe on 52nd is great. For a nice quick lunch the Metro Cafe just outiside of the hotel is an excellent choice. We simply loved it, this is our new spot to stay when we are in the city.

<Title>“Does exactly as it says on the tin”
<Content>This hotel provided us with a clean and comfortable base in the heart of a nice part of new york city. Previous experiences of "hotels" in this city had taught us that we could take nothing for granted in terms of cleanliness or basic standards. Thankfully the Doubletree staff were always polite and welcoming and rates were reasonable for the location. There is little glitz or glamour here although it must be said that the lobby is impressive. The room was very clean and very comfortable, and for that I was very relieved and very happy.

<Title>“Not worth the price, and watch your bill!”
<Content>At over $325 a night for the week I expected a pretty nice hotel. I was embarassed at the conditions of the hallways to the rooms. It made me feel a little uncomfortable (re: safe) just walking the hall to the room. Once in the room I couldn't believe how small the king room was. And there was no view - even for the 19th floor! There is a dresser/workdesk/TV stand unit on one side, the bed on the other, and a chair between them that you had to turn sideways to get into. The bathroom was so small you could almost use the toilet and shower at the same time. Don't have high expectations when you stay at this hotel and you'll do fine. However, watch the menu bar as they will charge you every day if you or the maid bumps the tray. It automatically hits your bill whether you take anything or not. It's supposed to allow you to pick up something and look at it for 20 seconds before billing you. I didn't use the mini-bar at all and got charges everyday. Anyway, try to get a completed bill when you leave. The clerk refused to give me one when I checked out, and indeed they hit my CC for some more menu-bar charges after I left. I won't be back at this hotel and will think twice about Doubletree since the clerk said it was corporate policy not to provide a completed bill. If Doubletree cares, the clerk was working 6/29 at 6:15AM and should be fired for his rudeness.

<Title>“Adequate. No more, no less”
<Content>New York Doulbetree Metropolitan: Adequate Date: June 28, 2007 Pros: Good location; next to subway so we only had to use cabs getting to & from LaGuardia; no problems with AC or enough hot water. We did have a small problem with the shower faucet that was turned so extremely tight we had to call the front desk to send someone to correct it. After the second call, a maintenance person came right away to loosen it. Beds were very comfortable. Delicious, hot chocolate-chip cookies were given to us on check-in, which by the way they let us do upon arrival around 2:00. Staff was pleasant and it looked like they went out of their way to greet guests enterting the hotel. We stayed four nights. We had to show our room keys before entering the elevator after 11:00 so we felt they were concerned about safety.Their Mets Grill was pricey: $6 for a baked potato the size of a tennis ball that only came with sour cream but the food was nice enough. Also, there is a PAX Wholesome Foods place around the corner on 52nd where we got great takeout food, including a wonderful spinach quiche and fresh salad, made to order. Reasonably priced too. Cons: Bath was indeed small. Bed linen was never changed during our 4-night stay, with no mention of their trying to help the environment. One night we had to call housekeeping for washcloths which they delivered right away. They never cleaned the ice-bucket or changed the plastic bag insert. The ice machine on the 5th floor is located in what appeared to a room that was formerly an elevator shaft. It was a bit dark & scary. One night we noticed they were still cleaning rooms on our floor at 7:00 at night. Overall, I would probably stay there again...with better rates.

<Title>“No Frills, Great location, pleasent stay, but nothing to write home about...”
<Content>The location is excellent for with lots of nice, more up market hotels near by and convenient for restaurants, snacks and other essentials. We were given a room on a higher floor with a good view of Lexington Avenue. Rooms are small to average size, comfortable enough for a couple who travels lightly. Bathroom was small, but bed very comfortable (king). Very busy hotel lobby with lots of airline crews but still managed to check in and check out in under 20mins, which isn't bad. Bar was good and the staff very friendly. Room service is not recommended as food came cold and under cooked. Overall, pleasant for the money we paid and you could pay more for such a good location. Would stay again and not eat in!

<Title>“BEDBUGS AT DOUBLETREE ROOM #822”
<Content>After one night in the Doubletree room #822 I was covered in bedbug bites. I stopped counting after 31 bites which have now turned red and oozing with pus. They did upgrade my room and brought hydrocortisone cream but that did little to provide relief from the itching. Do not stay at this hotel without inquiring about their treatment for this problem. They had the nerve to suggest that I had brought the critters with me. I would seriously contact the NY health department if you are considering staying at this hotel to make sure the problem has been taken care of. They said they inspected the room and didn't find any but that provides me with little solace after the biting and scratching ordeal I have endured this past weekend!!!

<Title>“Yikes...bad far out number the good!”
<Content>I read some other posts here before I went to this hotel, and I agree with most of the negative reviews. upon our arrival we were put into a room on the 2nd floor..with a huge fan or exhast vernt of some kind inches from our window...since I could not be near that loud noise I asked that they move us to antoher room...we were told that we woudl be getting an "upgrade" and that we were on a higher floor. Once we got to our new room, it was just as big as our "non upgraded" room, but with a smaller (queen) bed! I didnt want to spend my whole first day whinning to the front desk, so I decided to just take the room, small bed and all...but then I went to turn on the A/C unit... YIKES! it sounded like there was a dying animal inside...it made such a terrible noise, most likely from the belt. So, once again, I went downstairs, this time to cancel all together, refund or not! There was a man working the font desk, no manager around, and he offered to once again upgraded me, and this time garantee'd it. Thank goodness this time it was an upgrade. We were mvoed to the 18th floor and had a room with a balcony!! It really was nice to have an outside area to hang out with out all the street nonsense! The room did still have major cosmetic issues, just like all the rest! there was peeling wall paper and paint...the window sills were all cracked and the tub was scratched and dented... Although the final upgrade was ok, I walked over to the Waldorf when I was having issues with this hotel, and found out that they were actaully better priced!! I would not stay here again...and I would not allow my friends to stay there either!

<Content>This hotel has a fantastic location. Really close to 5th Avenue shopping and just a short walk to central park or down to the Empire State Building. The rooms are clean and fairly spacious. Very comfy bed. I was staying by myself in a double room so it worked out fairly expensive for what it was. If you were sharing the room and the cost it would work fairly good value for money.

<Title>“Very convenient - no frills but worth considering”
<Content>The location is excellent for Midtown and convenient for restaurants, snacks and other essentials. I checked in at the computerised terminal in the lobby, which was great untilit failed to print out my room number, but the desk staff were helpful then and throughout my two night stay. Room service even brought me a single fork at my request, when I got a take-out and had nothing to eat it with! Unfortunately I was given a smoking room, but this was bearable with the A/C on and some airfreshener bought from the local pharmacy. To compensate they gave me vouchers for a free breakfasts for me and even for my brother in law who popped by the next day. The breakfast buffet was quite well stocked. The king bed room was fine for one person and would have been OK for two, but the bathroom is small - although the bath itself is big and the shower was hot and powerful. Lots of airline crew seem to stay, and the lobby is fairly frenetic but as others have said, for the price this is a good enough base for those not spending too much time in the room.

<Title>“wonderful experience”
<Content>we stayed at this Doubletree last night and I was so impressed with the hotel that I wanted to write the review before we even left. We were greeted at the door by several hospitality people welcoming us to the hotel, we were checked in immediately, and given our warm welcome cookies. Upon finding out that I have an alergy to nuts, the check in clerk went away and came back with a box of 4 delicious chocolates for me instead. Our room was on the 17th floor, which had a great view and also a free continental breakfast for hilton honors members. The breakfast was excellent and manned by very happy and helpful staff. We requested a late checkout which was no problem... our room was modern, comfortable, quiet and immaculately clean. The bed and pillows the ulitmate in comfort, the bathroom was small but had a wonderful shower and neutrogena bath products. I would stay here again in a heartbeat and this will probably convince me to search for Doubletrees again. It is an oasis in New York to find anything like this for the same price as a lot of much lesser hotels. Les Portland Oregon

<Title>“lots to like, lots to dislike”
<Content>Stayed for 5 nights mid-May 2007 for a business trip. Convenient to Grand Central and there is a subway station right at the corner. Staff and service were very helpful. My room was on the 7th floor on the Lexington Avenue side. I was concerned that the street noise at that level would be unbearable, as I'd experienced several years earlier at the nearby Marriott East Side. This hotel was much quieter than that one, which was a pleasant surprise. The room was surprisingly quiet. it was also about $100/night cheaper. However, the rooms are clearly dated despite renovation attempts. The bathroom is tiny and feels cramped when showering. Water flow is good, however. The bed was very comfortable. Circulation for A/C and heat is poor, so the best way to ventilate was keep the window open. As a business traveler, I was frustrated by the lousy electrical sockets. They are not well situated in the room, and over half of them were so loose and rickety that PC and Blackberry power plugs would slide out and not stay plugged in. The TV also seemed to reset itself and turn on at midnight each night. Another co-worker's TV would turn on but not display video. It took the hotel 3 days to correct the issue, which ended up being a simple matter of correctly programming the TV remote. Not a great hotel if you'll spend a lot of time in the room. However, if you want a reasonably priced, convenient place to sleep in midtown, this one might be worth a try.

<Title>“Enjoyable NYC Hotel Experience”
<Content>I did a LOT of research online (Travelocity, Expedia, Hotels.com, etc.) on this hotel and I am glad I did. I think I booked a good hotel because I am very happy with my experience. When I first got there they were able to check us in quite early. Check in is usually around 3, but we were able to get into the room around 10. We took the red eye from San Diego and they may have been sympathetic! The room was good size...nothing like the "shoe box" descriptions of other hotels. I was thinking about booking a room at the W, but after seeing the size of the rooms I am glad I opted for the DoubleTree. The front desk was always very helpful with any requests we had. We asked for extra towels, had them delivered within 1 hour, and then received a follow up call to make sure we got them. Nice touch. The concierge was great, he had a lot of great suggestions. The room was always clean upon our arrival back from a long day on the town. One draw back that didn't relate to us: their computer system was down one afternoon and there were some angry people checking in! Everyone got an apology letter from the management, but I am sure there were some unhappy travelers arriving. The best thing about the hotel: great location. We talked a ton and there were subway stations right next to the hotel which was perfect. So all in all, I am really happy with the hotel.

<Content>Not that it is a 'bad' hotel, but to me it was not worth the hassle. I like to have a "cool" as in temp room. This hotel had horrible air circulation/conditioning. I would actually get dizzy in the rooms! If I opened the window, it was better, but having the fire station across the street made it impossible to have the window open at night. The decor was updated, but in a 'cheap' way. Bathrooms provided little storage space and found the desk chair cheap and uncomfortable. You can certainly do better for the money. Doubletree is a nice brand, but not this location!

<Title>“No Air Conditioning!!”
<Content>I stayed here because I always stay at Hilton properties and I wanted to use my Hilton Honors points. As soon, as we entered our room, we noticed the air conditioning was not working. After three calls to complain, we were told there was no air in any of the rooms because of the outside temperature was not hot enough and we would need to open our window if we were hot. The outside temperatures got up into the mid 70's and still no air. Try getting some sleep with a fire station and police department directly across the street, not to mention the hotel restaurant's vent blowing food stink right into the window. Their website states the rooms come with air conditioning and "in room climate control". I would have overlooked the dusty furniture, dirty bedskirt, clogged sink and hair in my bathtub and on the toilet, if I had only had air. My stay there was absolutely miserable!

<Title>“"Affordable" hotel in Manhattan”
<Content>All hotels in Manhattan, especially Midtown, are expensive. That's a fact! This hotel was a value for the price. Good location and proximity to Rockafeller, Time Square, and Central Park. Rooms were clean and comfortable and no suprises. What you would expect from a Hilton property. A few things I would NOT recommend: The restaurant. Our group had dinner there and the service was mediocre and the food...... well, McDonald's can do better. I had a filet mignon and was quite surpised when it arrived covered in what looked like instant brown gravy and water from the overcooked vegetables. Also, the bar is fun and can get crowded at night. Go to the bar to get a drink though, the waitress was lazy and seemed irritated with our presence. Go accross the street to Mr. K's for Chinese-expensive but awesome!

<Title>“Jsut Alright for a Double Tree”
<Content>As a Hilton HHonors Gold member paying full price, not my favorite Double Tree. Great location and pretty lobby although, staff was stiff. I asked for maybe a better room that didnt blow smoke in every morning, I was told I was in the nicest room and they would check oozing cig smoke smell problem. I stay at lots of hotels this was more like a old Hampton Inn.

<Title>“A quick stay...”
<Content>I stayed here for 1 night in late March. The hotel is not as nice as the Doubletree in Times Square but then again it is at least $100- $150 / nt. cheaper. Well located if you have business on the east side. Not a whole lot going on at the hotel - bar was dead on a Thu. night - but there are plenty of options in the area. (The W is 1 block south and has great bar!) Staff was VERY courteous and room was clean with nice amenities. There are definitely some worn patches but overall its pretty good for a mid priced hotel in Manhattan.

<Title>“No luxury, no complaints, up to expectations”
<Content>I was there with my wife for the Easter Holiday (4 nights). I was warmly welcomed, got a cookie and found the room spotless. I would return there anytime with the corporate rate I got. The electronic safe was locked, I asked for a maintenance person to unlock it, this was solved in the next 20 minutes by a friendly employee. The bathroom ceiling is indeed peeling off (as mentioned in many other reviews), since there are no bathroom fan, which is weird, but that is the only downside I found. That said, the bed and pillows are great, the shower has good pressure, the location is perfect, next to the subway. It is not a top class hotel, rooms are small, but it is in Manhattan, so it met my expectations.

<Title>“My PROs and CONs”
<Content>PROS: No doubt that the hotel is in a very safe area, and close to everything. Subway near by; tons of bars and restaurants. My wife loves Starbucks, so there is one in evey corner. The staff is very friendly. CONS: It costs too much for the size of the room. I happened to have a relative who could get a good rate. But again, NYC (Manhattan) is very expensive. Breakfast is not included.

<Title>“Good Location BUT”
<Content>....The location of this hotel is super and I will stay in the same area next time I'm in NYC. Having said that the hotel rooms are poor. Ours was small and there was mildew of the walls.It was impossible to keep the room tempurture comfortable. Still it was good value and I suppose if you are in NYC you not going to be spending much time in you hotel room. The location probably outweighs most negatives

<Title>“ok for a short stay”
<Content>we have just returned from a weekend break in the doubletree and though it was OK it was not great. Hotel is in a great location couple of blocks from 5th ave most places within walking distance. We stayed in a room on the 16th floor, rooms where a good size but not very clean, when we arrived there were hairs in the bath, the bathroom overall was not very clean could have been a lot better and apart from making the bed I dont know what the housekeeper done!!. The bed was very comfortable, but the air condition was quite noisey and could not be altered or turned off it didnt seem to do anything but make a noise, the staff on the front desk were not very helpful/friendly but I found the staff in the restaurant very polite and helpful. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in the US and never come across the system the Doubletree had in place for the mini bar if you picked something up from the tray to see if you might want it but you decided not to so put it back if it had been out of the tray for more then 20 seconds you where charged for it also which I have done in the past and not been told I cant is put other stuff in the mini bar fridge this again caused a charge which when mentioned at the front desk I was told "well its not a fridge its a mini bar" in quite an unfriendly manner, you are notified of the charge on a small note placed in the tray which at first just looks like a price list stuck between the goods on the tray.

<Title>“Nice Hotel”
<Content>Stayed here for three nights and overall the stay was good. The bed was very comfortable and the room was nice. I found the restaurant to be a bit lacking. The first night I visited it, everything I asked for from the menu I couldn't get for some reason, I ended up settling for something I didn't really want because I was hungry but didn't each much of it because it wasn't great. The waiting staff were very friendly but seemed to be in a constant state of confusion and flurry even when the place was near empty!!! I had breakfast one morning and would never do it again - it was awful and over-priced. The bar was nice, unusual for a hotel bar and I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The cocktails were tasty but I order the same one three times and got a different version of it three times. The cocktail waitress could've been a bit friendlier - or friendly at all might have helped! The hotel itself and the room were nice and most of the staff were too just not very organised- although check in was a breeze and the receptionist very nice. The day we were leaving we checked out and left our bags with the concierge and asked to get a taxi booked for our flight for later that day, he was very friendly and took the details professionally. We arrived back at the hotel later, retrieved our bags, tipped him and sat awaiting our taxi as we were half an hour early. 40 minutes later, stil no taxi. A different conceirge came over and asked us what we were waiting on and so ensued a process where we realised that the previous guy had obviously forgotten to book the taxi and was ringing to get one now. He told us 7 minutes. 15 minutes later and no taxi - with bad traffic we knew we were pushing it for the flight and asked him if he could just flag one - something he probably should have done from the beginning. We ended up paying more for the taxi and although we made our flight I would suggest if staying here do not leave your airport transportation in the hands of this hotel!!

<Title>“Below Par”
<Content>Our assigned room would not accommodate a rollaway bed as promised. The second room was still so small that there was no space to walk to the bath room w/o stepping over the rollaway. Our room was beat to death and ceiling was peeling. Front desk staff was aloof. Concierge was good, which was the bright spot.

<Title>“great”
<Content>i booked a room on hotels.com for the marriott east. it was 4 of us total. marriott said that a room with two beds was not available (even though we had reserved them online)--they said the "reservation was not a guarantee!!" (then what is it then?) we called hotels.com, and had to wait about 25 minutes on hold. they eventually did find us a room at the Doubletree, luckily it was two blocks away--and cost $40 less per night, about $240 total. i must say we were impressed by doubletree. great staff, great location, decent rooms. the lobby was neat and modern, not pretentious like the marriott (they think they're the trump or something). the doubletree staff were friendly and helpful. (the marriott staff by contrast looked like saying hello required a tip.) our room was decent and clean. the bathroom was modern, even though there were some waterspots on the ceiling (I never understood why NY hotel bathrooms always look so bad). it looked clean at least. good soap/shampoo. the housekeeping staff were also very nice. the beds were fine. clean sheets. small flat screen tv with wireless internet keyboard (didn't use). window opens (yay), modern blinds. not much of a view (office building accross street) but who cares. the best thing about the hotel is it's location. there are nice restaurants all around (especially 3rd ave). go down to Azure for breakfast--great food cheap prices at this deli. (come out of the front of the hotel, make a right on 50th and walk down 2 blocks). $20 for an omlette if you want room service...pershaw!. it's about a $10 cab ride to chinatown (with traffic). The hotel bar was pretty trendy. drink prices were average, $5 for a beer to $12 for a chocolate martini. the wait staff there were also nice. lots of people hanging out (saturday night) so great for meeting people. like most of manhattan, parking prices suck. at least the lot is right around the corner on 50th so you don't have to valet/tip. $45 a night and make sure you get the car out exactly before the 24/hr day ends, or else you pay a huge fee.

<Title>“Satisfactory”
<Content>The rooms at the Doubletree Metro are very petite in size. The decor of the room was plain and simple, lacking charisma. The lobby was also small and many left guests where left standing where chairs were lacking. The bar right next to the lobby, does provide additional seating and has good aesthetics. The hotel was able to accommodate an early check-in around noon; however, don't expect it, as it is rare. The staff members of the Doubletee Metropolitan were friendly and knowledgeable. The room was suitable for two adults. It would be a little cramped if you planned on bringing a third guest or a child along. The storage space was minimal, and only four hangers are provided for your convenience. If you plan on spending most of your time outside of the hotel seeing the city, then you'll be fine. However, I think the hotel is a little on the pricey side for what you pay. There are plenty of late-night snacking and dining options around the hotel, as well as a subway stop is less than 20 feet away from the entrance. Upon departure a staff member booked a car service for me to the airport. It was $55 to JFK ($35 for La Guardia) at a special hotel rate. It's much easier to do this than to take the SuperShuttle from the airport (HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED). Enjoy New York!

<Title>“Exactly Right!”
<Content>I stayed 5 nights at the Doubletree last month and was very, very pleased. As I searched the web for Manhattan hotels I was hoping to find something cheaper than the $185/night I paid for the Doubletree, but lots of negative reviews on TripAdvisor for cheaper properties scared me away. The Doubletree was comparable to their best properties elsewhere, with a room that's definitely large by NYC standards. Very clean, very comfortable, and a helpful staff. If you can manage the price and want a mid-town location, I'd say you can't go wrong here. Location is excellent - subway stop at the corner, and a different subway line just one block up Lex. Short walk to MoMA, 9 short blocks to Grand Central Station. (I took shuttle bus from the airport to GC and just walked to the hotel from there.) Finally: A couple of tips for good cheap breakfasts in the neighborhood (I splurged on dinners): The Oxford Cafe at Lex & 52nd, and Ess-a-Bagel on 3rd Ave between 50th & 51st. Enjoy!

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>The hotel is pretty basic however our room was spacious for the centre of NY. The hotel itself was okay and the staff were very helpful particularly the concierge. The standard of decor within the room, however, was pretty poor ie there was a chunk missing from the door in the top right hand corner! After having read other reviews re safety (only after having booked it!), we kept the chain on and a chair up against the door but never had any problems. The bathroom is very small but the shower was great, powerful which is what we like. The bed was comfortable and there wasn't a great deal of noise.....outside our window. The noise from other guests was a different matter however, very noisy! On the whole, not bad. Would use it again on the basis that I wasn't looking for luxury, by no means, but location was great, very convenient and for the price, can't complain.

<Title>“great location”
<Content>I visited New York with my wife and 20 yr old daughter recently and stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel on Lexington Ave. The hotel was great with very helpful and friendly staff. We had a triple room with 2 x double beds which was average size and very clean with very little street noise. There was a gym at the hotel but we did'nt have time to use it though. The bar was very lively and comfortable. Breakfast in the hotel was quite expensive, - about 20 dollars each but there were 2 cafes next door which did breakfasts at a fraction. The location was great, about 15 mins walk to the Empire State, Times Square, Grand Cenral Station and about 1mile from Greenwich Village. Will definately stay here on the next visit.

<Content>Two night at Doubletree was pretty OK, location great, friendly front-office staff, comfy beds... Not so great: security, anyone could walk-in to the floors, in the middle of Manhattan this is not safe! The carpet was filthy, dusty and the room was small (but that's understandable for NY). I would go again, but I really wish they would do something about the security.

<Title>“Excellent location, great hotel”
<Content>A friend and I went for a girlie weekend and stayed in the Doubletree for 4 nights. We were upgraded on check in (great staff at the desk) and the room was big (by NY standards, small by European standards) and clean. The bathroom was very small but well designed and functional. The location is fantastic, it's a stroll from 5th Avenue shopping and there is a subway station literally outside the door. I'd certainly go back.

<Title>“Where's the coffee???”
<Content>I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan for one night on business in Feb 2007. Great location in Manhattan and was upgraded to a king sized room on check-in, which was nice! Room size was OK but the room was a little rough around the edges. Service was excellent as usual for the US. However, the stay was let down by a lack of coffee making facilities in the room. As a brit only in the US for 3 days it was pretty much guaranteed I would be awake at some dreadful time in the morning. Unfortunately room service seemed to stop between 10pm and 6am meaning I had to go 2h without coffee after I woke up, not a good thing. For the price you pay for a room in this hotel this seems a little crazy.

<Title>“So-so hotel, worth it if you get a good deal.”
<Content>Firstly, the location of this hotel is excellent, and for most people you will spend more time out enjoying NYC and not cooped up in your hotel! The hotel is also very clean and the rooms, while small (not tiny, just on the small side) are very comfortable. So if you just want a good base and you get a decent rate, this hotel is a good option. We did have a few problems however. We had booked directly through the hotel's website so we could make specific requests (twin beds, connecting rooms) which travel agents could not guarantee. It was a little more expensive, but we thought worth it to be sure of what we would be getting. Upon arrival at 4 p.m. we were told if we wanted these requests filled we would have to wait for our rooms, which we agreed to do. After 45 minutes I returned and was told 1 room was ready. We went up to the room to find it was a double with no connecting door! We returned to reception to be told they had no record of our requests (despite the previous aknowledgement). We ended up stuck with non connecting double rooms for the duration. Overall I found the staff (reception, bar staff and concierge) to be rude and unhelpful. I complained twice and asked a manger to contact me but I never heard from them. Disappointing.

<Title>“Excellent Location”
<Content>The three most important features of this hotel are: location, location, location. We were in NY just for a quick vacation, and the central location of this hotel was excellent. Subway stations, the Park, SoHo, etc. are all a quick cab ride, or enjoyable walk from the hotel. The staff was very nice and professional. As you have probably read, they give you a nice warm chocolate cookie when you check in. Actually, we would ask for a cookie every morning when we left the hotel and they happily obliged. The bar/lounge area in the lobby is a nice place to have a drink and wait. The concierge was helpful the one time I asked him a couple of questions. The rooms were nice, kind of like an IKEA sample room. There is a small flatscreen TV, and a little love seat sofa. The rooms were clean and ours had a very nice view. If I really want to find something to complain about, I could say the bathrooms are a bit small, but you are in Manhattan with some of the most expensive real estate in the world, so don't expect a luxury bathroom unless you pay a premium for it. For a middle of the road hotel, I think the Doubletree Metropolitan really has a lot to offer. Again, the location is what makes this hotel a great value.

<Title>“Convenient, comfortable - and cramped”
<Content>I booked this hotel on Quikbook for a 4-night stay associated with a business trip. The rate varied with each night (from a low of $139 to a high of $199). Oddly, Quikbook offered the four different rates for my stay, whereas the Hilton website only offered the highest rate for all 4 nights (i.e. $199 x 4). When I called to see if I could book directly with the hotel at the rates of $139, 159, 179 and 199), I was told no (although I guess I could have achieved the same result by making 4 separate bookings ....) Overall, I was happy with our stay. The location was perfect for my business trip (meetings mostly in midtown east) and for shopping. I much prefer this area (which is near where I used to live) to the Times Square area (where I'd stayed a few weeks ago - at the Westin). There is a subway stop right beside the hotel and Grand Central is a short walk away. Our room was clean, the bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was of a reasonable size and had good water pressure and reliable hot water levels. Housekeeping was friendly and efficient; the woman who cleaned our room each day did a great job of accommodating our needs (we had to spend a lot of the time in the room working and/or studying), and cleaned around us when we had to stay in. There is a decent choice of nearby cafes (Au Bon Pain is one of the best). As I recalled from when I lived in this neighbourhood, there seem to be relatively few restaurants on Lexington or Third Avenue just to the East. You'll have much more choice if you walk one more block further east to Second Avenue. There were a number of irritating aspects of our visit, though. First, most of the front desk staff we dealt with were brusque and unhelpful (the exception was the supervisor who dealt with some problems with our bill on check-out; he was very service-oriented and professional). As others have mentioned, there is no minibar or coffee maker in the room. At this price, a free cup of in-room coffee in the morning would seem appropriate. Of course, the room was so tiny, there was practically no room for either appliance. The room is so tiny, there was only enough space for a small armchair jammed up between the bedside table and the window. There was so little space, it was impossible to sit in the chair. Internet was $10.77 a day (better than some hotels, but not cheap); frustratingly, the box and wire connection for the internet had such a short cord that it was impossible to sit on the bed (adjacent to the tiny desk - and only 18" away from the box/wire contraption on the desk) and use one's laptop. (Note: There is a Fedex/Kinkos about 2 blocks north - a better value if you only need the internet for a short period of time or if you need to print something.) It costs $1 per bag to store a bag - perhaps I would have tipped that much but I think this sort of thing should be in the customer's discretion, not a fixed fee. Would I stay here again? Yes, because of the location and because the hotel is clean and the beds are comfortable - but I wish the hotel wouldn't nickel and dime its customers - and if I could afford the larger rooms, I'd pay for upgrade.

<Content>Location ideal, 5 mins to Grand Central, 10 mins to Times Square. Directly by a Subway station. Surrounded by other glamorous hotels also, making you feel your really n the top area. No problems with the staff, and the rooms, though smaller than most US rooms, not bad for NYC. Bed was cracking, very comfortable. The cookie`s a nice touch also. No problems at all, and close to it all.

We didn't eat here but I did order room service which was delicious and beautifully served. There is also a good hotel bar. The location was perfect for us. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking for somewhere central to stay in Manhattan as I was absolutely delighted with it.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>Spent 5 nights in New York. The hotel is in a great location, 3 blocks from fifth ave and a further 3 from broadway. New York is a city that is easy to travel in. The hotel as per previous reviews is good for those that don't need to spend much time there ie just for a bath and for sleeping in. The rooms were big but the bathrooms were very small. The beds were very comfy. The only downside is make sure that the do not disturb sign is put outside and that the privacy lock is on, otherwise the cleaners are constantly trying to get in and is quite disconcerting. The sound proofing needs to be better but overall the place is what you pay for in this city.

<Title>“Fantastic”
<Content>Stayed here in November 2006, on our third visit to New York. Wins hands down over the other places we've stayed, and both of them have been pretty good. Maid service daily, clean towels etc. 10 minute walk to Central Park and Times Square. Chrysler building around 10 blocks down Lexington. One thing I would say, give the restaurant in the hotel a miss, not the best by any means!

<Title>“Possibly average, but watch the details”
<Content>Stayed for 9 nights over Christmas 2006. 2 adults and 2 teenagers in one room (room 250). Tried to charge us $50 for the childrens breakfasts as max for room package was 2. Manager sorted this out but lots of problems every day re: missing vouchers etc. Breakfast very mediocre and actually unnecessary as the hotel is surrounded by lots of sandwich bars which are very cheap and excellent quality. Toilet blocked (room 250) on 2 nd day, bath outflow (room 736) very slow. Noisy lovers in next door room on 3 rd day necessitated us all moving to another room at 3 am. New room was bigger but had sink in bedroom as bathroom was too small (room 736). Internet was free in lobby - just as well as cable in room was broken - they fixed it with cable across room!! Bathroom ceiling in 250 was peeling (as in your photos) and also mould at bath edge. Also bar cost $22.40 for two gin and tonics!!!!!! Finally the concierges were really only interested in selling trips and restaurants for their fee. Example: Q: Where can we eat on Christmas Day? A: "very hit and miss, mostly closed, can get reservation at $150 each"! Theatre tickets offers had 100% markup. Actually, virtually everything was open. We ate in Planet Hollywood (excellent and cheap) and went to Radio City Show (10 min in line, excellent seats) both on Christmas Day. Hot Tip: Must get New York City Pass - saved hundreds of dollars for the four of us. The good news: the management addressed all our problems quickly and even returned our passports which I left in the lobby as we were leaving!! The location of the hotel is excellent and across the road to the Waldorf where President Bush stays.

<Title>“Good value hotel in a very convenient location”
<Content>We stayed at the Doubletree a couple days before Christmas; father, mother, and 2 small children. I was suspicious of the hotel because of the extreme "good or bad" reviews here on TripAdvisor, but a friend recommended it, it's in a great location, and I found a price under $200/night - so I booked our stay here. It turns out we had a good experience. I've stayed many times in Manhattan, and I've paid much more for much less. I found the hotel to be a solid 3-star to 3-1/2 star. The room was stylish, clean, and in great shape - small but large enough for the 4 of us, and the staff was courteous and professional. The location is wonderful for a mixture of Manhattan activities. It's within walking distance of Rockefeller Center, Broadway, and Central Park. For going downtown (or uptown to museums) the subway is just outside the door. We didn't use any of the hotel restaurants, but the lobby bar seemed to be a popular spot - it had great modern decor and was full most of the night - it could have been mistaken for the W Hotel bar down the street. Two disappointing experiences were the frequent long lines at the concierge and the storage fees for luggage after room check-out ($1/bag to check-into storage and another $1/bag to check-out ... absurd - I've never experienced this anywhere else). But overall, I will definitely consider staying at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel again.

<Title>“Good accommodation, great location”
<Content>My son & I stayed 3 nights in this hotel to celebrate his 21st birthday. Had a room with two double beds on the 11th floor. Good size room, clean, beds really comfortable. Great location for Manhattan. We didn't really use the hotel apart from sleeping and showering, All hotel staff were pleasant & courteous. There was some discolouration on the bathroon ceiling, but apart from that the room was fine. The location was fantastic, all the main attractions were within 10/15 minutes walk. It is a great base for sightseeing and shopping. I don't understand why anyone would give it a negative review, unless they were expecting total luxury. It is just like it looks on their website. I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to friends and family.

<Title>“Great NY hotel for the price”
<Content>I travel to New York on business several times each year and always stay at the Doubletree. In NY, most hotel rooms are small and well worn, but the Doubletree has more space and is recently remodeled. Very comfortable beds! The location is great, making it convenient to get to meetings anywhere in the city. The restaurant is good for meetings (they let you stay as long as you need), although a bit overpriced for the quality. The Metro Cafe next door is perfect for quick meals. I have found the concierge and front desk staff to be adequate, but when traveling on business I don't need my hand held.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>Well for starters I showed up at the wrong time to check in it was right at 4pm and I think everyone was checking in at that time. Even had lines for the self check in computers. No big deal was not in a big hurry. Very nice lobby which is always a good thing when you walk in to somewhere in NY. When I got to my room I did not know whether I checked into a match box or a hotel room. But come to find out I got stuck in a smaller room (could have been because of the stairs right beside my room). Other then that it was ok. Internet in the room was $11/per day. Bed was soft pillows were ok. Crappy view of the condos right next to the hotel. I do not recommend buying a drink down in the hotel bar/lounge unless you are ready to pay for it (beer $8 / mixed drink $12) maybe I just got the wrong bartender. Of course it is Manhattan. But in all the hotel is nice!

<Title>“one moldy and rude hotel”
<Content>I booked this hotel through Hilton web site. Looking by the past reviews in which if I had a had chance to read before going I surely would have cancelled this reservation. Front desk personal awful, Charged total stay two times to my card andwas told I would have to take it up with my bank. They would not tak care of it. I had to wait for the holiday to have the bank cancel one of there transactions. Moron at front desk when I was asked for a cookie states you already got one at check in. Now this is true but every Double Tree I have stayed at, which have been many gives out cookies upon requests. When you pay $300.00 a night I don't think asking for a extra cookie is a request that should not be honored. The bathroom had mold on ceiling. Walls are paper thin. We could he our neighbors show they were watching. Problem with toilet in which we reported to housekeeping but they never fixed it. So we took it upon ourselves to fix. Paid 50.00 per person for dinner at the restr. Ha gourmet food is was not. Took us two hours to have dinner. Stayed thirsty the whole time because servers never came around to find out how your food was or if you need any refills. Had to go hunt someone down to even get our bill to pay. Then the bill was incorrect. Do not stay here. There are many other hotels to choose from.

<Title>“New York Shopping Trip”
<Content>My best friend from school and I have just returned from the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel in New York from a 3 night stay. We booked this trip late and did not have a clue what we were going to after reading the reviews, they were either really bad or good. At the beginning of the year we stayed in a 5 star hotel in New York and it was excellent so after booking this we had mixed feelings about booking this hotel. On arriving at the hotel we was an hour earlier at check in but was greeted with our cookie and given our room number without any problem. When I asked if we had two double beds the lady said that the travel company had booked us a small room with only one double bed. When I asked if we could have a room with two double beds she said that because of Thanksgiving Day the hotel was very busy but she looked on her computer and then gave us a bigger room on the 12th Floor with two double beds. The room was of a nice size and had two double beds a small but very clean bathroom. The only think that we missed was not having a kettle in the room which was the only downfall. Our room was not noisy but it was at the back of the hotel and I dont know if it would of made any difference if we had been at the front of the hotel. The hotel is in a great location walking distance to Fifth Avenue Shops, Central Park, Grand Central Station, Madison Avenue Shops, Bloomingdales and Times Square. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful and cannot say a bad work about the people or the hotel all in all a good trip to New York with lots and lots of shopping done and food ate,

<Title>“Not the Peninsula - the Doubletree and it was okay.”
<Content>We booked a Friday night stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan, November is a notoriously busy month for hotels in Manhattan, and although we normally prefer to stay at the W - the cost was prohibitive right before the Holidays . We thought $230 for a king executive room was decent, and the hotel was not disappointing. The room was standard size for a Manhattan property, it was clean, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was decent (there was no fan, so the paint was peeling from the ceiling - but there was no mold) and as I said, the room was clean. The Doubletree is not a 5 star property, it is a 3 star and a good one at that. I've stayed at several other NYC hotels, paid more, and gotten far less. If I were a traveler on a budget, I'd definitely opt to stay here again. Pro's: cheap eats right around the corner. Cookies at check in. Comfortable beds and linens. Convenient to GCT, a couple blocks to Radio City, subway station right outside. Con's: peeling paint from ceiling in bathroom, no fan in the bathroom.

<Title>“Weak”
<Content>Weak hotel...it is NOT NEWLY RENOVATED (at least it doesn't look that way). Old and tired hotel. No A/C on warm days in the fall (hotel switchs to heat throughout...you sweat). Dingy and dirty. Cheap furnishings. Very disappointing. On my "bad hotel" list of places to avoid.

<Title>“I loved this hotel”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel on the recommendation of my employer who had also stayed here in September. I thought it was lovely and every single staff member that I spoke to made me fell like I was the only guest at the hotel. I was travelling alone and I didn't need to worry about any details, they took care of everything. I would certainly stay here again. I missed so much of my trip to New York because I keep falling asleep in the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in.

<Title>“Poor, Poor, Poor!”
<Content>I picked this hotel to celebrate my 30th birthday because the hotel website said it was newly renovated (the hotel staff said 2005). We noticed the carpet had stains near the elevators. When we got to the room, it was even worse. It looked as though the new, cheap wallpaper was on top of the old, probably cheap wallpaper. The IKEA furniture was already chipped. Some of the bulbs in the IKEA lamps were not working. The bathroom tile had mildew. The bathroom ceiling was peeling. The bathroom vanity was probably also from IKEA and was not custom fitted (pipes were sticking out of the sides). We asked for another room and were "upgraded" to an "executive room" with a king bed instead of a full. This room did not have the peeling bathroom ceiling but everything else was the same, including the already chipped IKEA furniture and the mildew on the bathroom tile. I grew up in New York City and now live 45 minutes away. I booked this hotel hoping to have a special evening. I was very, very disappointed. There are so many hotels in New York to pick from. Do not pick this one.

<Title>“Very Dissapointed”
<Content>My initial reaction was "Wow...what a tiny room!" Then I noticed the wall paper that was separating from the wall. Not a pleasant site. When I saw the bathroom, I almost threw up! the ceiling had a lot of water damage and it looked like it would cave in any moment. The bathroom was also very tiny! I would not stay there again, nor would I recommend this hotel to ANYONE. What a great dissappointment considering I've always stayed at Doubletree.

<Title>“Modern Hotel, Great Decor, Great Bedding!”
<Content>Booked through there own website, and was very impressed. I have stayed in some very poor hotels in NY, but this was very nice. Modern funky decor, in the rooms and the lobby (some hotels only spend money on the lobby!). Room was standard NYC size (i.e small), but was decent. Clean, and no problems. MUST comment on the bed, it was the most comfortable EVER! They sell the bedding downstairs, and I know why, it is so soft and lovely! Also, wired internet is available in the room at a charge, but what isn't advertised is that there is wireless internet available in the lobby, you need to get the passcode from the check in staff each day. Finally, the concierge was great, and he really helped us with his suggestions, and gave us some good discount cards too!

<Content>I stayed with my wife 5 nights on this hotel, and it was an excellent experience. The location is absolutely great. On the side of the hotel it´s the Metro Cafe where you can eat excellent salads (you choose the ingredients) at a good price and you can bring them to your room. There is a subway station just on the corner of 51 st with lexington and other on 53 st with lexington. Starbucks is just some seconds away.

<Title>“Keep looking...”
<Content>Room type: King non-smoking. Received room on a higher floor (6th) far away from the elevator as requested. Reserved thru website and got best internet rate. 3 nights stay during 2nd weekend of September 2006. Pros: Excellent midtown location, within a block of subway station, and several food options nearby. Super comfy bed and the cookie was a nice touch. A/C worked well for unseasonably warm late summer. Friendly and efficient service from concierge and bellhop although the reception service was not so good. Cons: Although the décor looked as if it were updated recently, the carpet in the room & especially in the hallways had seen better days and reeked of smoke. Had an interior facing room, which probably cut down on the street noise a bit, but unfortunately gave us a lovely view of the building next door’s broom closet. Didn’t try the restaurant as it seemed a bit expensive, but there was a very good deli next door and the W’s restaurant just a block away. Average size bedroom area, but very small bathroom. I’m a small person at 5’2” and 120lbs, but I could sit on the loo, wash my hands, use the towel rack and turn on the shower all at the same time. Impossible to do any of the prior mentioned while keeping the door open. No bathroom ventilation whatsoever, so even with the door wide open while bathing, the steam collected on the ceiling and condensed huge droplets even several hours later. The bathroom or shower curtain consistently smelled musty and even the paint /wallpaper was peeling from the excessive moisture. The in-room internet via television was circa 1992, I think. It would be faster & more legible to check your emails from your phone. The keyboard failed so we called a tech who came immediately but who could not fix the problem even with a new keyboard. Charges for the in-room internet were credited, although we had to ask twice. The President and some very important foreign dignitaries were staying in hotel across the street which made getting a cab impossible due to the street closures and high security. The registration staff seemed familiar with the President’s security measures while visiting, but failed to warn us that we’d have trouble leaving/entering the area when asked about getting a cab later that day. When the time came to leave for our international flight, the bellhop was as helpful as he could be under the circumstances, but ultimately had to walk 6 blocks with luggage to finally find a car (for a heftier fee than regular taxis) to take us to the airport - very stressful. Unless they lower the cost to stay significantly, I can’t imagine why I’d return to this hotel. Especially when there are so may other options – the W one block away was only $75 more per night!

<Title>“Great Location, Clean Rooms”
<Content>While the Doubletree Metropolitan has a fairly generic chain-hotel feel, it is very centrally located for a tourist trip to New York. I was there on business in midtown and it was great to be able to walk everywhere. You have the 6 train 51st St stop right next to the hotel, and Grand Central station not too far. The Plaza, FAO Schwartz and fancy stores on Fifth Avenue are close by. I will say that the EXACT area the hotel is in is rather bland and business-y. If you want a real "New York" atmosphere, Lexington Avenue in the 50s is not what I'd recommend. Maybe try Times Square, 5th Avenue, Union Square, Upper West Side or SoHo. I stayed on the 12th floor (room 1224), which had lots of natural light and was not noisy at all. The rooms seem to be organized with evens on one side and odds on the other, so I would recommend booking an even-numbered room. The people in the room next to mine were watching TV pretty loudly (I heard it when I was in the hallway), but the sound did not come through the wall. The room was clean, with a comfy king bed, GREAT velvet chaise lounge and smallish flat screen TV. The bathroom had Nutregena products and was VERY clean. Great mirror over the sink (the sink is in a little alcove outside of the bathroom). My only complaint: There is only free wireless internet in the downstairs lobby and bar. You can buy it in your room, but I ended up just going downstairs and sitting in the lobby. The bar seemed kind of weird, with a sort of airport/chain feeling even though it gets pretty crowded at night.

<Title>“Really bad”
<Content>What a disappointment! I booked the hotel because of its location. The price USD 200+ was not very good for a Doubletree - I could have got to a W for the same price. My room was a catastrophy: there was weird smell in the room, the airconditioning did not work, the traffic noise from the street was way too loud, the walls are of paper - I overheard the arguments in the next room -, and the bathroom was old and paint was getting off the walls. In the morning, pleased that I had only one night, I was going to have breakfast. The breakfast room was so crowded, and hot that I could not eat there but had to find another place. Never again.

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel!!”
<Content>Just got back from our stay at the Doubletree and have to say was a bit concerned after reading some previous reviews but I had nothing to worry about. We got a warm greeting on arrival and a free upgrade to a king room. We were on the 8th floor right at the end. The room was a good size (and even if it wasn't, who goes to New York to sit in their hotel room) and the bed was amazing, if I could have fit it in my suitcase it would have come home with me!! The welcome cookie was also divine! Room had a view of the 17th Precinct police station and fire department (great for spotting all the firemen!). Location of the hotel couldn't have been better, we walked to all the central attractions within about 15 minutes tops! Empire State, Rockerfella, Central Station, Times Square/Broadway, Central Park all within walking distance and as for 5th Avenue, well it's only 5 minutes away (great for all that shopping you have to carry back). Cabs passed the hotel all the time and were easy to flag down. Great little cafe down the road (Oxford Cafe) and the manager is a character with great sandwiches and cakes. Didn't go into the hotel bar but it was always busy at night and looked like it had a good atmosphere and was comfy. Didn't have breakfast there either as it's cheaper to go to a diner (and more New York!) So all in all a fantastic hotel in an amazing location and we will definitely be going back!

<Title>“Very good stay!”
<Content>Me and my girlfriend Jo recently stayed at the Doubletree hotel on a 3 night trip to NY to celebrate her 30th Birthday. The hotel was very good and the room was quite large - we received a free upgrade from a queen room to a king room (possibly due to my girlfriends pink credit card that the check in staff loved!!) The bed was fantastic - very large and comfortable with loads of pillows! The flat screen TV was very good too. The bathroom was nothing special but functional - all that matters! The staff at the hotel were generally friendly and very efficient and the cookies received on check in were superb. The location of the hotel is superb - 5 Mins from the Empire State Building, Rockafella centre, Bloomingdales, Grand Central station and all of the main shopping areas! The only mini gripe i can think off was the 2 dollars charged to leave bags in the luggage room and collect! Overall the hotel was excellent and we would definatley return.

<Title>“Disappointing”
<Content>CONS: We were in room 1248, thankfully only for one night. The main issue was the air conditioning which was unbelievably noisy and, for whatever reason, could not be controlled or turned off. We have never heard an air conditioner that loud! We did not get a restful sleep at all; we tossed and turned and woke up many times. We finally resorted to earplugs to muffle the noise of the air conditioner. The mattress was not comfortable (too soft) and the sheet was one foot too short. We had to yank it down so our feet would not touch the mattress where other feet may have touched (yuck). The ceiling in the bathroom was so water-damaged it looked like it might cave in. The bathroom door did not close completely. Despite the dark color of the carpet, it was clearly very soiled. The room and the bathroom were small (and, did I mention, the incredibly noisy air conditioner!!!). PROS: There were triple sheets on the bed so you never had to touch a dirty bedspread. There was a curved shower rod to help avoid touching the shower curtain. There were Neutrogena toiletries, a safe in the closet, an iron and ironing board and those cookies… they are absolutely delicious! I could not recommend this hotel, nor would I return; the cons outweigh the pros.

<Title>“The Doubletree Metropolitan was a great find!”
<Content>My husband, 10-year-old son and I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan over the 4th of July week. First of all we picked the place because of other fellow tripadvisor's recommendations. So a big thank you to all of you. When we arrived on July 2nd we were greeted by a wonderful woman named "Venus". She was just charming and greeted us with warm chocolate chip cookies. The place had an art deco feel to it. Very simple decorations, but sharp. There was a bar near the hotel check in desk. I just looked in. It looked like a nice place to have a drink. We never did since our son was with us. When we got to the 18th floor---we were put in a junior suite. SWEET!!!! Now this is a bit pricey, but worth the money. We had our own balcony. A nice view of some high skyscrapers. The room was just beautiful---clean, art deco furniture, and one big huge king size bed. A pull-out sofa for another bed. Great thick towels in the bathroom. Venus gave us vouchers for a breakfast---compliments of DoubleTree. Awesome breakfast buffet. I just kept eating. But what we loved the most about the Metropolitan Doubletree is that it was walking distances to everything. Great restaurants, great shopping, Broadway, Trump tower. Everything was right there. But of course---you were a cab ride away from everything too. I can't say enough about this hotel. I loved it. We loved it. And Venus---she made the stay very pleasant. We will be back!

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>We spent three nights at the Doubletree Metropolitan in June 2006 and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a high quality hotel at a good price that is convenient to explore New York. We arrived earlier than recommended check in time expecting to check into a Queen room and a twin room. As we were early they did not have the Queen room ready but upgraded us free of charge to an available King. Every guest receives a Doubletree hot choc chip cookie, which was a wonderful touch. The room was extremely clean and of a good size. The bed was one of the msot comfortable I have ever slept in. The bathroom was also spacious and clean with a a great selection of soap etc. The hotel is located on Lexington Avenue right beside a Subway station. It is about four blocks from Grand central station and the Chrysler building. It has good local access to shops and café/restaurants. The area is not as busy as the rest of Midtwon but is close enough to the tourist sites. We will stay again when we return to New York. We have stayed in other New York hotels of equal star rating but Doubletree Metropolitan out classes all of them. (p.s. If you are looking for a great restaurant at great price in New york, we recommend the Ghandi Cafe Indian Restaurant on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village.)

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>I stayed at the Metropolitan several years ago, before it was re-branded as a Doubletree. I loved the cool moderne feel it had then - huge restaurant and bar at the front; nice comfortable rooms. I thought it would only be better now that it was part of the Doubletree chain. Not so - the beds were uncomforable, the tiny lobby was PACKED day and night w/ hordes of flight crews waiting for transportation (and there's no where to sit); no organization at check-in, the staff is polite, but obviously the management doesn't want to hire the staff to accomodate the guests needs. Our room was clean, but very tight quarters, w/ no view. The most annoying was the INCREDIBLY over priced restaurant, which has all the charm of a hotel conference room - they charge $20 for a breakfast buffet and if you don't choose the buffet all the al a carte items are so overpriced, you might as well get the buffet. We spent over $40 for one order of belgian waffles, one order of lox and bagels, 2 coffees and 2 orange juices. I was so excited to stay there again, but honestly, we'll stay at the W or Waldorf next time.

<Title>“DoubleTree Metropolitan - visitor guide”
<Content>We just returned from a weekend stay at the DoubleTree Metropolitan Hotel. Here are some tips for your stay: -- Parking The hotel has a $30 daily reduced rate ($40 standard rate) with the adjacent garage on 51st street. The garage is on the LEFT side of 51st as you approach Lexington Ave. It's the building just before the DoubleTree. As you leave the garage, use the small entrance on 51st into the hotel. This will save you the walk and hauling of your bags up to the hotel's Lexington Ave entrance. Get your parking ticket stamped at the hotel desk before picking up your car ... to save yourself a trip and to get the reduced rate! -- Hotel Location The hotel's front door is the only thing on Lexington Avenue. The hotel extends down 51st street. -- Room Location All even numbered rooms overlook 51st street. The view from these rooms is a towering black glass building directly across 51st with a reflection of the hotel being your primary view. Rooms are well insulated from street noise. All odd numbered rooms look out on a series of old brick buildings, A/C units and water towers behind the hotel. Not a nice view. Many of the queen rooms are positioned on this side of the hotel. The best rooms for a view are rooms numbered 02 and 04 on each floor (ie: 302, 1202, 1404, 1602, 1604, etc). These rooms are first two rooms on each floor, are located on and closest to the corner of 51st and Lexington and have extended views up Lexington. -- Rooms As others have said below, rooms are of a very good standard. All have plasma tv's, comfortable beds, ample space and good baths. -- Check in If your room's not ready upon your arrival, simply check your bags and go see the sites. No need to wait around in the lobby. You're in NY! Enjoy the city! -- Internet All rooms have a high speed connection. Charge is $10.77 per 24hrs. The electronic safe in the closet is big enough to fit a laptop. Our notebook is about 14.5"L x 11.5"W x 2"H, and just fit in the safe. -- Getting Around Cabs are always outside the front door, the subway (4,5,6 Green Line) is on the corner of 51st & Lex to take you downtown. Crosstown lines are available on the corner of 53rd & Lex ... 2 blocks away. There's also an excellent (and free) city & tourist map available at the front desk & from the concierge. The map is well marked and includes all major landmarks, subway lines, etc. Overall, the hotel met our expectations and we would definately consider it for future stays. Hope this helps.

<Title>“Nice Stay/Some Issues/Location so-so”
<Content>We booked our room via the Doubletree phone number after seeing their Queen room rate at $179 (plus tax) for July 15-17 on -----. Since ----- charges a booking fee, I then called the doubletree directly and they quoted us the same rate so we took it. Since it was our anniversary, we requested an early check in for noon vs. 3 pm. The room was not available until 4:30 which was very frustrating. The lobby was PACKED with people waiting. We had to stand the entire wait. They agreed to hold our luggage for $1 per bag so we paid $3 for them to hold our bags while we parked the car. Parking is $30 per 24 hrs/ plus tax and is located directly behind the hotel. (The men in the parking garage are very rude. I don't think they are part of the Doubletree hotel though.) Once the room was ready, they charged us another $3 to take the bags back again. This made me VERY annoyed. THIS IS VERY CHEAP on the part of Doubletree. You don't charge people to hold their bags, especially when we where waiting for our room for so long and wasted the entire afternoon in NYC checking in. The wait was a pain in such a packed, noisy waiting area. People were all over the seating on their laptops chatting away, burning time I'm assuming as they too waited for their room. They told us we'd have a room on the 9th floor with a view. When we got to the room, it faced a brick wall. I called the front desk and they put us on the 10th floor facing uptown and the view was nice and the room was larger than the queen and looked very chic and was very clean. The king bed was very comfortable. The room came with hair dryer/iron/iron board and a flat screen TV. Internet access, although the keyboard was broken and the service doesn't allow you to access your email and it costs $10.95 for 1/2 day. Bring a laptop. The room was super quiet. The A/C is not self regulated, it's regulated by the hotel, but I found the room comfortable. Neutrogena products are available in the room (soap, shampoo, conditioner). The sink area was separate for the shower, so it was great for couples getting ready. Lots of towels and they were quite nice. Loved the bedding. All white and very comfortable. TONS of pillows. :) Chaise in the room too for putting my luggage as I unpacked. Large closet with wood hangers. Lots of drawers to store all of your clothes. Windows open in case you feel the need to hear a little NYC night noise. I loved that the windows opened so I could here the cars 10 stories below. I have to have a little noise at night so that's why I opened them. Otherwise, you could have heard a pin drop if the window wasn't cracked. Great for light sleepers. The hotel staff , in general, were quite nice. There is a bar that is nice right off the lobby and a restaurant (we didn't eat there but it smelled nice!!) I heard that a gym was in the hotel too but with all the walking we did in NYC in 94 degree weather, we didn't make it to the gym. There was also a gift shop that looked very nice. The elevator was very quick.Taxis are ALWAYS outside in front of the hotel. Around the corner is the W hotel with a bar and a place called the Whiskey Bar. There is Starbucks, Au Bon Pain, Bliss spa, a great deli with buffet foods for breakfast, etc. within one block. The train was also within a block. Times Square, Bryant Park (eat at the outdoor Bryant Park Cafe at night - great cheap sandwiches and martinis), 5th Avenue, Central Park entrance within walking distance. But, if you love boutique shopping, bars and pubs and nightlife, don't stay here. This is mostly for tourists with kids doing the tourist thing. Lots of the 40+ crowd stayed here too - I saw groups of ladies and lots of older couples. Many screaming children in the hotel too so don't stay here if you are looking for the upscale hip crowd. But again, dead nightlife in this area and no real shopping except for 5th ave, which I found so amazingly boring. 5th Avenue has ZERO charm. I was so disappointed by the large department stores. SNOOZEville. Overall, the hotel was nice and I'd stay again if I was looking for a deal in NYC. But, I would NOT take a queen room - tiny room and bed plus the bed wasn't comfortable and the space was very tight. I wouldn't stay here unless I booked a King room. I was happy they upgraded me to a King for having to wait though, so doubletree if you're reading, thanks for that. Made wasting my entire afternoon in your lobby a little less painful. Also, if you're reading, don't charge people to hold their bags, super tacky. And at the end of the stay, don't have your hotel manager standing in the lobby approaching guests in line to check out telling you to rate them a 10 online. That was very cheeseball.

<Title>“This is a great place!”
<Content>This was our 1st trip to the Big Apple. The Doubletree turned out to be a fantastic place for us to stay. Our room was pretty good sized and there was more than enough room for us to be comfortable. The bed was comfortable, the room clean and a plasma TV! That was a nice surprise. I know there are some complaints about service, room size, cleanliness, etc., but we received impeccible service and had a great experience. I would stay there again. Jason, the concierge was extermely helpful in giving us information about things to see, booking some tours, getting our JFK transportation set up and reccommending a fabulous restaurant to us that wasn't ridiculously overpriced and touristy. I can only say good things about the Doubletree Metropolitan. Also, a convenient Cafe Metro is right next to the hotel where you can get snacks, breakfast and lunch for a reasonable price. It was also pretty good!! I would recommend the Doubletree for its central location, its proximity to the subway (it's right on the corner) and its comfort and service. Fred O. California

<Title>“Great Experience”
<Content>We had a wonderful stay. The staff was very friendly or, at the very least, cordial. The bell hops speak english, most as a first language. My husband (who's a native Texan) enjoyed the "Soprano-like" accents very much and I was glad to be home. The hotel is located on Lexington 1/2 block from the subway station -- you can't get more convenient. The beds were comfortable, the room was very clean, and we enjoyed the automated check-in terminals, which we used to check into the hotel as well as to print out our boarding passes for the trip home. I booked our room through Priceline and, except for one snotty telephone reservations clerk, we were treated very well. About the clerk -- I hung up on her and called back and got a very helpful clerk. It didn't matter though, because when I checked in I was given the option to change the room I'd been assigned from a one with a queen beed to one with 2 double beds. Then I asked the bell hop for a rollaway bed and it was delivered within 10 minutes. The only thing that's keeping me from giving this hotel an Excellent rating is that the room didn't have the lighted makeup mirror and similar (luxury?) appointments that I was hoping for. I would stay here again, but I also would have liked a little refrigerator.

<Title>“Decent Stay”
<Content>Booked a room with a queen sized bed, when we arrived they didn't have a queen, so they gave us a king sized bed - but it was a handicapped room and the toilet was unusually high off the ground to the point my feet could not touch the floor. Other than that- the room was clean & respectable, the location was a good 10-15 minutes walk to attractions/shows etc. And the gym was surprisingly modern.

<Title>“The best hotel”
<Content>My granddaughter and I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel from June 23 to June 26 and found it to be wonderful. We went there as a part of a American Girl package. The rooms are great. Spacious, clean, comfortable. The only problem we had was as to how to work the shower. Very confusing. Make sure they show you what to do. The cookies at check in were a hit with the granddaughter. Soft and warm. We stayed on the 11th flood and no outside sounds were noticed. The pillows were the best I have ever put my head on. And there were four pillows per bed. We had two double beds. They provided a bed for the American Girl doll my granddaughter brought with her. They also brought a rob, but they wanted $40.00 for it and we passed on that. Be careful about the prices for food. It cost me $20.00 for a buffet breakfast and $10.00 for the granddaughter. A little pricey for french toast, sausage, juice and coffee. The buffet does have a lot of food, and it is all tasty, but just too expensive. The service was excellent and prompt. If it were not so expensive and I could get the same room, I would stay there again. I think that since we had a package deal, that the price was quite high for 4 nights and five days. Location is great. Just a few blocks from 5th Avenue, St. Patricks, Rockafeller Center, The American Girl Place, Park Avenue, etc. We took a pedi cab one night when we were very tired and it cost us $15.00 for the short rride back to the hotel from 5th and 49th. The next night we thought we would do it again but this time they wanted $25.00. I said no and told them I would walk rather than pay that much for the ride. One of the other pedi cab drivers said he would do it for $15.00 and we went with his pedi cab. So be careful about the pedi cab charges. Ask BEFORE you get in as to how much they will charge you. There is a Fromms book (not a very big book) that has a wonderful map of Manhattan that was a great investment for me. It has detailed areas and a lot of great ideas. There is a fold out map in the inside cover at the back of the book that I relied on while there. I copied the are we stayed in and kept it in my purse for a reference. Really helped me.

<Title>“You get what you pay for???”
<Content>Just returned from a four day stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan. Both myself and my friend booked a few months in advance and got a king size non-smoking deluxe room. We also asked for the rooms to be near each other (though not connecting). We were very happy to receive rooms next to each other. I was a bit apprehensive when I read all the other negative reviews, but perhaps you get what you pay for. Our rooms weren't the cheapest, but they were very big for New York standards. The bathroom, however, was tiny but everything was there that you needed including nice Neutrogena products. The bed was very comfortable (perfect after walking all over New York). The air conditioning in my room did work well but was noisy - I was at the end of a corridor so I think that was why. My friend's was not as noisy. The room was well laid out and there was plenty of room for all our stuff. It did not have a minibar or fridge in the room, which we missed especially since it was so hot in New York. The hotel itself is in a good spot - walking distance to Moma, Central Park, shops on Fifth avenue, etc. The concierge was very helpful though the front office staff were a bit snobby. We ended up paying about US$240 per night direct from the hotel's website - this included a full buffet breakfast, so I felt that it was good value for the location, the size of the room and the breakfast. Would I stay again? If I was in New York, probably, but I have decided I am more of a European girl - absolutely adore Paris and just got back from London which I preferred to New York!

<Title>“Lower your expectations”
<Content>I've stayed at this doubleTree three times, twice because my company booked it and once because I ended up with it on Priceline. I will never stay there again, but for some it might be an OK choice. First, except for the person who checked us in this last time (who was charming), the staff are either overworked, or totally indifferent, or just rude. I'm not sure which, but either way, no one really cares how your stay is. For instance I asked for more hangers three days in a row. Service is basically crappy, generally no one will answer the phone when you call reception. Location is very good, you can walk a lot of places. It's NY so plan ahead if you want to extend your stay, I've seen rates go from under $200 to over $600 in the course of one week. Housekeeping is very good, and the rooms I've stayed in are clean, and the beds are very comfortable, decent decor. AC is good (although I guess it was broken in some rooms last week). Beware that there are some VERY small rooms, but the ones I've stayed in are OK for NY. Ask at the desk not to be put in the extra tiny rooms -- I'm not sure what the numbers are but you can see from the fire safety maps on the wall -- go back and ask for a bigger room. Unless you hate NY traffic noise, get a room that is not on the back/inside side. I have stayed in both, and the big fans make a droning noise that to me is worse than traffic - zero view. The windows have heavy soundproof glass so you should be OK. try to get a room that is higher than the 10th floor or so -- there are only 18 floors in the hotel, so higher is better for less sound. My biggest complaint - we had a laptop and a hard drive stolen out of our suitcase from the luggage storage last year. Stupid me I actually said 'please put this somewhere safe, there is a laptop inside'. We discovered the loss the moment we got to the airport, but of course the hotel would take absolutely no responsibility and blamed us instead. I suppose they were so worried about liability that they could not be professional and instead were complete jerks - seriously, dealing with them about the theft was a terrible experience. No apologies, no callbacks, total runaround....nothing but hostiility. I recommend locks on your luggage, and check your luggage before you leave the luggage area. I'm sure this was a random event, or one bad apple or whatever, but I've never been so disrespected as I was when I was trying to deal with the stolen laptop. When I got the hotel again on priceline I thought it was a cosmic joke, cause i swore i'd never set foot there again.. My travel service (corporate) told me they got lots of complaints about the hotel.

<Title>“what a value for new york!”
<Content>we stayed at this hotel for 200 a night. they give you these big warm gooey chocolate chip cookies at check in. staff friendly at checkin. concierge way overworked so cant help enough. room big. style decent. bathroom had problems though. toilet was wibbly wobbley and not mounted and toilet overflowed once right afetr we checked in!. water all over the floor! bell hops helpful. modern stylish lobby and bar. though no mini bar in the room which would not be good for business travellers. i assume (hope) the toilet was just an isolated problem. so, other than that i thought it was a good value (by NYC standards) especially since we paid the same 200 bucks for the skyline hotel (motel!) in nyc which was quite bad. would stay again at the doubletree.

<Title>“Stayed every month for 6 months”
<Content>I've stayed in this hotel every month out of the last 6, not because it has anything special about it, but it's fairly close to our NY office. I first stayed here in 2003 before it went through the much publicised "extensive refurb" and to be honest it hasn't made a huge difference. The lobby and bar area have certainly been improved, but as far as I can make out the only difference in the rooms are a basic flat screen TV, better beds and window blinds that may be more modern but are already showing signs of wear. They also put new shower curtains in. WOW!!!!! My biggest complaint is the the bathrooms are ridiculously small and claustrophobic. This month they gave me room 1402 which at least has a good view up Lex, but mostly the rooms have poor views (most look out over air conditioning units and the back of office blocks). Basically, if I weren't on tight corporate expenses, and I were paying with my own money I'd look for somewhere else with more character and better value. The gym facilities are not bad and it's worth dropping in for an hour after work. The doormen also have a nice little scam going with private cabs and will charge you $70 to JFK no doubt skimming $10 for themselves in the process. They're more interested in booking you a cab than they are in anything else. When you arrive at checkin they make a big deal of handing over one of their "legendary Doubletree chocolate chip cookies". I've never eaten one of them (mostly because I arrive after midnight!!) but to be honest it's a hollow gesture that doesn't even come close to making up for shortcomings elsewhere. If you're paying with your own cash, go elsewhere. If on expenses and you like midtown, it's worth considering only if you can book a King room at least and demand one with a decent view (not at the back).

<Title>“Being Gay at the DoubleTree Metropolitan”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan over this past weekend. Some things to note if you're gay/lesbian and staying here. 1. The concierge didn't give us a room with a King Bed, like we'd reserved on Expedia. This was my partner's 30th birthday and I wanted to provide a romantic weekend for her. I mentioned that the Standard King is what we booked, but she wouldn't budge, leaving us with two double beds. It wasn't a bad room, but just neither what we'd reserved nor expected. I felt that if we were a straight couple, this wouldn't have been an issue that needed explaining. 2. The hotel bar downstairs is for super made-up straight people. We felt out of place. Because we didn't look like the Real Housewives of Orange County, we didn't get served for a very long time and we were annoyed because we had money to spend. Funny how quick people are to judge. 3. The room was surprisingly quiet for being in midtown Manhattan. The beds were very comfortable "Sweet Dreams" beds. 4. Midtown probably isn't the best part of town to stay for people who don't really care too much about shopping at Cartier and Louis Vuitton, but I will say that there was a Starbucks right around the corner and one of Manhattan's best bagel places one block away, "Ess-a-Bagel". 5. We loved SoHo, the East Village, TriBeCa and Chelsea. When we go back, we'd probably stay in lower Manhattan, which was more our speed. 6. The Russian bar in SoHo, Pravda, is great! I loved that place. Bottom line, if you stay here and midtown isn't necessarily for you, don't be afraid to take the green line subway (right outside of the hotel) to lower Manhattan. You will have a much better time and fit right in.

<Title>“Unworthy of the Doubletree name”
<Content>There's nothing wrong with the Doubletree Metropolitan that a wrecking ball wouldn't fix. This is a dingy, dilapidated property - not at all what I've come to expect from Doubletree. Our windows overlooked an airshaft, though the desk clerk said "I have a very nice room for you". The touted "flat screen TV" is tiny and the picture is bad. If you're thinking HDTV, think again. Loud "top 40" music in the halls and elevators. The carpets in the halls are old and dirty, and halls smell bad. The rooms are tiny. Need I go on? We wanted to leave as soon as we saw our room, but they told us we would have to pay for at least one night. So we hightailed it out of there after one night of a planned 5 night stay, and instead went to the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square. It's a bit more expensive, but a great value. I don't know why Hilton bought this place, or why they stuck the respected Doubletree name on it.

<Content>I stayed at this hotel for two nights while visiting friends in the city. I used to live there so this hotel was in a fantastic location... Midtown Manhattan, Lexington Ave, near all kinds of shopping (if you are into that) and close enough to cab it downtown for a night of bar hopping. The staff was friendly and courteous. Rooms were very neat and quiet. Very satisfied with the hotel and will definitely stay there again. :-)

<Title>“Great Location, adequate accomm. would stay there again”
<Content>Stayed in the Doubletree for 3 nights at the end of March 2006. Myself and my mother were on a shopping trip in New York and were looking for a cheap but cheerful place to stay. I had been to New York several times before and knew that location is far more important than room size or luxury. The Doubletree is situated on the corner of 51st and Lexington and is perfect for walking to the obvious touristy things and 5th avenue shopping. As with all hotels the foyer looked very promising and it was only when you exited the lift at your floor that the 1970's carpet came into view. We had a twin room on the 17th floor and barr the carpet in the hallways really couldn't fault it. There were 6-8 lifts which brought you up 17 floors in seconds. Our room was big enough for 2 double beds and we had a lovely clean recently refurb bathroom with powerful shower. The movie channel had all the up to date movies. Check in took no time at all and we got the yummiest choc chip cookie which was novel. We opted for express check out so had no delays there either the only thing I did find unusual was that we had to pay $2 per piece of luggage to be stored after we had checked out as we were not leaving New York City untill later that day. All in all would def recommend the hotel for basic clean rooms in great location. Will def stay there again.

<Title>“Perfect location nice hotel, good value”
<Content>We stayed from march the 5 to 12 at the doubletree metropolitan. The check-in was very easy and fast. By the way the cookie was a very nice touch. The room was clean and the bed comfy. We stayed on the 11th flooron the side where the firestation is, it was qiuet. Only the AC was lil bit loud. thats y only 4 points. The bathroom was small but clean. Towels changed every 2 days, throw it to the bathtub and u get some new one. The location was perfect, located right next a metro station. Many attractions in walking distance. Rockefeller , Chrysler Building, Central Park in only few minutes away (about 10 minutes). We def. stay here again.

<Title>“Just fine”
<Content>I stayed at the Doubletree last week and was pleasantly surprised given some of the adverse comments on TripAdvisor. My room was quiet, clean and the bed very comfortable. I think being at the back of the building on the 7th floor made it particularly quiet for Midtown Manhattan. The bathroom is small. To misquote another poster "The bathroom is so small I had to get out to change my mind!" but very clean and well equipped. The check-in/check-out and service were good and the location excellent for midtown (and my NYC office on 53rd and 3rd). The Metro cafe is right next door for breakfast. I'll definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Got Overcharged $2,600 by Mistake!”
<Content>On arrival, all was great - the cookies were outstanding. The room was also fine, we had a twin room and the size was good for a NYC room. The bed was comfortable. For our last night we booked a triple room. We did not realise that this would be the same double room with a trundle bed squeezed in. Needless to say, with three girls and all of our shopping there was no room to move. Our room was also not made up, twice - which was not great. But the worst part of our stay was that I was overcharged $2,600 - by mistake! We paid for our rooms in full at the time of our booking over the internet. No one at Hilton took responsibility for the mistake and I was given the run around. It cost me time and money (many phone calls from London to the US) trying to have the error corrected. I would find it hard to bring myself to stay in a Hilton affiliated hotel again. ...The hotel bar was great though!

<Title>“Stop giving it such a hard time!!”
<Content>I recently stayed at this hotel for 5 days for my 30th birthday, and having booked it before finding Trip Advisor I was a little worried about staying there. Well for those of you going there fear not. We checked in, and everything was ready and waiting for us including our warm cookies which were yum by the way. Must say they had not managed my request of a smoking room, but they never guarantee it anyway. There were three of us stsyong in our room in two double beds which were so comfy. The linen was pristine, and was changed after two days, I then spilt a bit of drink on there and they were changed again. The towels are not changed daily as a matter of course but there is a sign saying to put them in the bath if you want new ones which was done without fail. Did not eat in the restaurant so can't comment, but the bar was great and the little shop carried all the essentials although it did look like just a gift shop from the outside. I found the concierge's that I spoke to very busy but very helpful and knowledgable and not unhelpful as mentioned in some previous reviews. All in all the Doubletree was just what I was looking for. It was very clean, right by a subway station, a five minute walk from Bloomingdales and ten minutes from Times Square. Must mention the Cafe Metro which is next door breakfast for less than $5 and not bad, lovely cakes and fab sandwiches. Come on everyone give this hotel a break!!

<Title>“Expected More...”
<Content>My boyfriend and I had waited a long time to get to see the sights of New York, so when we found the Doubletree we were very excited! The location is excellent as are the cookies however, that's about it! On arrival the staff were too busy to take much notice of us, we didn't even get a smile with the Hello, and to us British that is very important! The room was very small with no view. The rooms, I guess, are supposed to be 'Retro' however, I would say that they haven't been decorated since the 70's but just had a flat screen TV and some new lamps added. When it came to bedtime, we tried to turn off the heating in the room as it was very noisy however although we switched it off, it carried on. We called the Engineer who was very helpful but he had to totally switch off the heating at the mains which meant no heating whilst we stayed there at all...hmmmm...March is a little cold for no heating! We also had to put a towel against the door to stop the light from the hallway shining through. We called the Engineer out on a second occasion as the TV / Internet service screen froze and we couldn't check anything, not even our bill!! Our bus back to Boston did not leave until 4pm on our day of departure therefore we asked if we could leave our bags. Not only did they charge us $1 per bag in but also $1 per bag on collection...total rip off after spending $419 for 2 nights!!

<Title>“Location was great for our stay”
<Content>We stayed for only one night in order to take my daughter to a charity event on the Today show at Rockefeller Center. The location was perfect for us, since it is only a couple of blocks from Rockefeller Center (and the American Girl Place). For a one-night stay, the Doubletree Metropolitan was fine for us. Check-in was a pleasure -- the front desk clerk was very friendly. Our room was very nice, two double-beds and more space than expected for a New York City hotel. It was neat/clean. The bathroom is fairly small, but had a full tub/shower. Beds were comfortable and we didn't hear much street noise. The walls are thin though and did hear people talking and watching tv at 2 a.m. Easy express checkout. Like others, we checked one suitcase to be held for a couple of hours after checkout -- and were charged $1 for checking them, then told by the bellhop that he gets a dollar tip when retrieving the bag-- like another reviewer mentioned, I don't mind giving a tip, but I find it very rude when someone "charges" a tip. I think that's a poor final impression to leave on a customer. Be aware that if you park in the parking garage you will not be allowed access to your vehicle during your stay so make sure that you don't leave anything in your vehicle that you will need. Overall, it was a good stay for us for this purpose.

<Title>“great cookies, lousy service”
<Content>when we arrived we was very impressed, the room was good and the bed was amazing. the bathroom was very small and the shower took ages to work with hot water. The location is great, but the service was poor. I had some valentines roses delivered from my husband in the afternoon and they didnt bring them up until 12.30 in the night and they woke me up. The suprise was wrecked and had to ring down to the front desk twice they denied they were in the hotel at all. what was worse i had to call home to find out 'what my husbands suprise was' and they charged me $19 for the 3 minute call to the uk ! What annoyed us most was the charging for bag storage. they charged once to put it in and again to take them out! and the guy on duty charged us for every single item, when we returned the people had change on duty and he said we had been ripped off! all these little issues leaves a bad taste in, in atually a not bad hotel.

<Title>“Really marginal service”
<Content>The location is great if you have lots of meetings up town. But the maid service was ridiculously bad (they *never* emptied the trash or tidied up the room. They only changed the sheets when I requested and left fresh towels). The bellhops (when they were around) let me struggle with my luggage almost the entire way, then held out their hand for a tip. Likewise they charged me for storing my luggage for 2hrs after checkout, and again, wanted at tip for taking 20 minutes to find it. The walls are thin and the hotel attracts a non-professionial clientele. There were teenagers shouting to each other down the hall, the concierge was clueless (or perhaps new), but worst of all... There was no refrigerator in the room! No mini bar, no fridge.

<Title>“Ideal!”
<Content>Stayed at the Doubletree at the beginning of February 2006. This was my 5th visit to NY and the Doubletree is undoubtedly one of the better hotels I have stayed in. It's great location makes it very accessible for many attractions and getting about. Warm cookies on check-in are a nice touch. Booked a king room and wasn't disappointed. Room was large, modern and clean, with good facilities and a decent hairdryer! The bed was so comfy - just what you need after a days pavement pounding! The Metro Cafe is located next door and open from 6a.m. (perfect for those suffering from jet lag, as we experienced). The Broadway Diner across the road is also a good choice, especially for breakfast but there are plenty of places to eat round and about the hotel. I would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Tiny rooms but got good price”
<Content>There for two nights on business a few block down the street. Got Queen bed room for Avg $170pn. Location served it's purpose, but rooms were very tiny and I agree with another reviewer, bathroom so small, you have to step out to change your mind. Given room in back of bldg, with window view of another building about 50 feet away. Kept shades closed for privacy. Small Plasma TV more a upscale gimmick. Give me a regular TV with a 25" screen. But then again because the room was so small, a small TV screen was par for the room. Would not stay here again. Felt cramped after being in a hotel in another major city with a waterfront view before this that was about 50% larger and the same price.

<Content>have stayed at a variety of nyc hotels and variety of size rooms doubletree lexington was average but the bathroom you couldnt swing a cat.... i would stay at this hotel if a good price was available and as we paid 179 usd plus tax it was a bargain for the nice white bed linen.. had a view of the fire station. i would say this hotel is a glorified travel inn with plasma tv; and fancy hotel bar which was very trendy and always busy when i passed.. the nicest hotel so far has to be the crowne plaza on times square it was lush and big big rooms... at the doubletree though only booked a queen but very nice lady upgraded to 2 doubles after being super nice to her at check in.. they charge you a doller to check in and then out each piece of luggage with the luggage man which is a bit much when you have lots of bags including carriers and un expected when you are on the way home and spent up on your dollars....i would stay here again but only if a good price... i would not pay a fortune but location for subway is ace...

<Title>“Ideal Location”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel last November for 5 nights the location was excellent if you are a serious shopper! The room was of excellent standard extremely comfortable beds to rest our weary bodies after trawling the city for bargains! The only down side to the room was the size of the bathroom other than that this hotel cannot be faulted. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel as it seemed quite expensive for what was on offer. There are plenty of coffee shops/diners near by with the metro cafe next door, which is just alright. The staff were quite fiendly and extremely helpful with organising a taxi to the airport and storing our bags whilst we shopped some more! The location was excellent it was less than a five min walk to Bloomingdales. We didn't use the hotel's conceriage but had heard from other guest that he/they were always helpful and infomative. Overall this hotel was very reasonable, comfortable and I wouldn't hesiate to recommend a stay at this hotel. I know i will be returning!

<Title>“Excellent hotel in excellent position to explore new york”
<Content>we have just returned from 4 nights in new york staying at the doubletree metropolitan. Opted for this hotel after the usual search through tripadvisor for a decent hotel, and were not dissappointed. We took the shuttle bus to grand central station from JFK ($27 return)which took approx 40 minutes. Took subway from grand central to next stop at 51st lexington avenue, which brought us out directly next to the hotel. We received our cookies on check in which were very nice. We had booked a standard double, but on arrival were given a lager room on the 17th floor. Very good room with extremely comfortable bed and pillows. We had no problems with noise as others have mentioned. The only downside was the lack of tea/coffee facilities. The maid seemed to appreciate the first day's tip, providing extra toiletries, but for the following 3 days seemed to only bother with towel changes and making the bed. The hotel is in an exellent position for tourist activities. Times square/ 5th avenue / central park are approx 10-15 minutes away on foot. There is plenty of activity in the surrounding area at all times and the streets were well lit, which makes walking back at night safe. For those that do not like to walk, there is a subway just outside the hotel and a further subway 2 blocks away which will take you to most places in new york. There is a small deli/cafe next door which serves a wide variety of food all day until late at night.We found this to be an ideal place for breakfast in the morning,as well as any late evening snacks/drinks before returning to our room. This hotel offers good accomodation at a good price, and in an excellent position which is not always easy to find. We would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Good value, GREAT location, a few problems”
<Content>Here is the text of a message I sent to the Doubletree/Hilton web site after our stay: "Many travelers now use the Internet service called "TripAdvisor" for information about hotels. I will soon be posting my opinions on that site, but thought I would first let you know of our concerns. First, your front desk staffperson was rather brusque and unwelcoming. Secondly, our room was still not cleaned one day when we returned at 4:30 pm from sightseeing. Third, the door to the room did not fit snugly in its jamb, allowing noise into the room from the hallway and other rooms. On the plus side, the room and bath were well appointed and the hotel's location was terrific. I hope you will take steps to address these concerns, as we would probably stay at this hotel again if these problems were alleviated. Thank you." In summary, I still think the hotel is a good value, and the front desk/housekeeping problems were minor. The doorways do need better insulation, however!

It is in a great walking distance to a lot of new york landmarks and just as well as we were there during the transit strike. It is a great base for tourists. There was a really nice deli next door to the hotel, good food, we recommend the sandwiches :-)

<Content>For a three star NYC hotel, it is above average. Rooms recently renovated, in a cool funky decor. Lobby/entrance nice. Bar is very expensive, but it's New York. Only problem was thermostat on wall didn't seem to work- had to call engineer. And of course, noise can be heard from hallway (near elevator). These are problems I've encountered in many older building in New York. Other than that, very nice and a good deal for under $200.

<Title>“great location and value”
<Content>We recently stayed at the doubletree in january and were very pleased with this hotel. Check in was quick and friendly and although the warm cookie was good, we thought it was a a little odd. (didnt stop us from eating it!) Check in person was very accomodating by placing both of our parties on the same floor. Rooms were very boutique-like in decor and were clean. Bathroom was small but adequate. LCD (PLASMA?) TV was pretty cool. Views were mostly office and apartment buildings. Only negative is that I usually judge a hotel by the condition of its corridors, which in this case, were a little worn (in my opinion) This hotel is wonderfully located!! For you walkers (What better way to see NYC?) it is so close to so much in midtown! So, between the quality of the accommodations, price and location, I would say this hotel is a very good value. Hint: go off the beaten bath for breakfast. a lot of the diners close by are way overpriced and appear to be tourist traps.

<Title>“Ticks 8/10 boxes, but best location!”
<Content>Thought l owe it to this site to post my review, as l spent hours trawling through this site before l finally decided to book the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel. So...location could'nt be beaten unless you can afford one of those lovely suites in a 5* overlooking Central Park. The hotel is just in the next block from the Astoria,W Hotel and other very posh ones. The only negative thing l can say, is that the hotel staff are quite short, but then l guess it is part of a large company corporate. If you re staying there over a weekend, ask for a free up-grade if they have spare rooms, as we did and got moved to a larger, higher room with a view. Overall, more than satisfactory.

<Content>I stayed at this hotel for 4 days and I highly recommend it. It's very modern and has all amenities, as most Doubltree hotels have. The location is OK but not in the middle of all shops or theaters. It's a calm neighborhood and a very safe one also. You can reach all major attractions quite easily. The subway is just in front of the hotel and the bus also passes by in front of it. The room I got which had a king size bed was spacious enough for us and 4 large pieces of luggage. They have great beds, modern bathrooms, and everything was very very nice. Just don't make long distance calls from you room. Free wireless internet from the lobby and a very popular bar. I really enjoyed it and will stay here again next time. Plus reasonable prices.

<Content>I stayed overnight in January '06 and loved it. The hotel is located on 51st and Lex and is a 5-minute walk from Rockafeller Center, Radio City, the upper reaches of Time Square, and the Winter Garden theater on Broadway where Mama Mia is playing. I lived in NYC on 51st and 7th back in the 80s, so I'm very familiar with the area as well as what types of hotels are available in the area and for the price I paid here versus what I've paid for the Hilton or either of the Sheratons on 7th I can't recommend any other place to stay. Room and bed were comfortable. Small deli/shop next door was convenient for some inexpensive grub. Easy walk to my appointments the next day.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>From La Guardia to Hotel -Cab Fare average around $30 with the toll fee Check In -We got there early around 1pm on a Saturday so I didn't expect to get into a room right away. -Service was great. We were greeted right away. They kept our bags for $1 a piece when we couldn't get into our rom. We got our room around 3:15pm. Room -We booked 1 room with 2 double beds. The room was smalll, which I had expected since it was NYC. -Rooms were clean and bedding was comfortable. Unfortunately the double beds are a little small for two grown people. -One complaint that I have is that the a/c didn't work and the heat was set really high. -We ordered internet in the room. This helped alot because we needed to get different schedules and information for our vacations. Hotel Amenties -The Met bar was nice even though the drinks were a bit steep. I didn't realized that the tip was included so I ended up overtipping quite a bit for the first few rounds. -I didn't try the restaurant, but nextdoor is a great cafe called Cafe Metro. They had good breakfast & was great for a snack if you didn't want to go to far away from the hotel. It is also opened really late. -Close to the the subway. The 6 train will take you almost all the places that you need to go in Manhatten so it was really great to be next to it. We bought the all pass for the subway which was only $7. Well worth it. Check out -No problems on the bill. -Easy & smooth check out. -The doorman got us a cab right away. Overall, I like the location and the hotel very much. I would definitely stay again.

<Content>We stayed at the DoubleTree Metropolitian prior to Christmas for 3 nights. The location could not be more perfect as it is within walking distance to Times Square as well as Central Park. The hotel is older and needs refurbashing, but if you are touring during the day and only sleep there is is sufficient. Rooms are small and the bathroom was big enough to turn around in. But, it was clean and we felt safe. Safe location for female travelers with children.

<Title>“Great Christmas Vacation!!!”
<Content>My wife and I decided to take a Christmas Vacation to NYC from December 18-21. We got a great deal on a standard room with queen size bed on the Doubletree website ($130 CAD). I was a bit nervous to see the place judging from some of the reviews here, but I am not sure what all the negativity is about. We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful front desk person, and were provided the excellent warm chocolate chip cookies upon arrival. We had arrived at 8 AM, and were not able to check in that early. However, the hotel was able to put our luggage away for us until we returned at lunch time. Check in was quite smooth and we were into a room, as they said, by lunch. We were on the 6th Floor and thought the room was great. Not large, but cozy and I found they made great use of the space. The room had been recently renovated, and was bright and clean. We enjoyed the flat screen TV, and found the bed to be very comfortable. It was greatly appreciated each night after long days touring the city! The bathroom was clean and modern, with no complaints. With regards to the noise, though we were facing the NYPD and FDNY stations, the noise didn't really disrupt us that much. Maybe if it was the summer and you had the window open it would be noticeable, but with the windows closed it didn't bother us. The hallway noise was noticed (thanks to the young children running up and down the hall), but as has been suggested could probably be drowned out with a towel under the door. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel as a great home base for your trip to New York. The rooms are clean and modern. The location is fantastic--within about a 10 block radius you can walk to Central Park, Rockefeller Centre, Trump Tower, Times Square, Empire State Building, Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue. We were there in the middle of the transit strike, and weren't terribly effected because of our proximity to everything. And now that the strike is over, it is good to know the subway is right next door as well. I recommend the Broadway Diner across the street. You can get a great breakfast there for $5. The food, service, and prices are great. The only negatives I would have were that they told us toll free calls were free from our room, then charged us for them. (They were quickly removed when we pointed it out to them.) Also, we were told the luggage storage was free, then were charged $3 when we picked up our luggage. Overall though, I would come back to the Doubletree Metropolitan again. If you ever have the chance to see NYC at Christmastime, I would highly recommend it. Nobody does Christmas better!

<Title>“Tiny Rooms, Big Price, Big Attitudes”
<Content>Girlfriend and I, lifelong New Yorkers, decided to stay over in Manhattan for two nights during the transit strike, especially when we saw how low the rates were for this hotel: we got a king room for 150/night, and were upgraded to a king junior suite because of our Hilton Honors status. Despite the lower-than-usual rate, this place was still a bust. The "junior suite", on the 19th floor, was the size of a normal small hotel room anywhere else in the continental United States. Welcome to Manhattan, kiddies. And because this hotel is in midtown Manhattan, you get no view. The top floor of this place is the middle floor of the skyscrapers surrounding it. As if the room itself wasn't small enough, the toilet and shower were crammed next to eachother in the "bathroom" to the point where if you stood in the middle of the room, you would be unable to fully extend your arms in either direction. The whole place has a very claustrophobic feel to it, and remember, this is a top-floor junior suite! The real kicker is the front desk attitude...twice, from two seperate employees, my polite inquiries or standard dealings were met with the tone of voice normally reserved for the exceedingly little of little people. Any good...location is alright, the sheets were clean, and the heat control, though carefully hidden, worked quite well once discovered. Also, the elevators were surprisingly fast for a hotel this big/busy. Would stay here again only if it was the lowest rate in all of midtown.

<Title>“Perfect location”
<Content>Had a great stay in this Hotel on 17th-22nd of December. Went to New York City for a shopping trip and light sight-seeing, so didn't really care about a view, from the room. Ended up on the 19th floor of the Hotel which faced the rear (I think)(Not much of a view-didn't care). At any rate, at check-in received vouchers for "free American breakfast" and warm cookies all 'round. Nice touch. Counter person was interested and informative. Breakfast was great, to say the least. Full buffet-can't think of anything that was missing. "Metro Cafe" next door (10 feet away) was a great little oasis for coffees and quick lunches; reasonably priced. "Marilyn Monroe" Subway entrance another 10 feet beyond Cafe. General location of Hotel was perfect and seemed central for walking to shopping and street level sight-seeing. Also, double-decker tour bus stop nearby. Great place, no complaints, will book again.

<Title>“Nice hotel - great subway location”
<Content>Checked into the Doubletree Metropolitan hotel on December 14th. Had a very personable and friendly front desk check in person who would not allow me to have a cookie since they were not hot and fresh (very kind of her). The check in was fast and efficient. The room was very clean and had a very comfortable bed and work area along wth a divan - it was pretty much slightly bigger than average for a NYC midtown manhattan room. The sink area was spacious and well designed as was the bath/shower combination. There were some minor issues with the room - toilet paper holder not fastened to the wall and some wallpaper not sticking properly and these issues kept me from rating as an excellent The location is great with next door access to the Lexington Avenue #6 local with one stop to Grand Central to transfer to multiple lines Yes, there were decent sized gaps at the bottom of the door - solved by towels I would stay there again if my business required me to be in midtown/east side

<Title>“Cant Understand The low Rating”
<Content>Stayed for 3 nights while doing some xmas shopping and cannot understand the reason for such a low tripadvisor rating (#180). I was concerned after reading the reports but to be honest we couldnt ask for more. The room was bright, clean and well decorated and the location excellent. Whenever we needed staff assistance they were good. I think some people rely too much on hotel assistance and invariably are let down, try to be a little independent and you wont have to complain about the staff as much. We usually stay in fitzpatricks but this was very comparable at half the price. Will certainly stay again once the credit card bill is paid off!!!

<Title>“Does Austin Powers stay at the Doubletree?”
<Content>Stayed 5 nights pre-Xmas; had to change rooms on the after they put us next to the elevator shaft first night. Both rooms had constant plumbing problems: mysteriously the bathroom sink would start to back up from the drain and nearly overflow. Our bathtub plug never did work despite multiple visits from "Engineering", and would jam either open or closed. Staff try to be helpful, though they have their hands full keeping this place running. Can't figure out if this hotel is trying to look 60's retro or just never got reno'd. Either way, not so groovy, baby: awfully tired-looking, especially for $580 US per night.

<Title>“Very Mixed impressions”
<Content>We have just had 4 nights at this hotel and got back today...sorry for the length but a lot to say! When we arrived we were checked in quickly and the staff were brilliant and really funny, we even had a laugh about them getting my wifes name wrong. We went up to the room and as soon as I opened the door I got a strong musty smell combined with urine like in a public toilet! There was no way we could sleep in there (decent size though I thought!) so went back down.We got a room change straight away which was in fact a little larger and plenty big enough for us although had no view but you can't have everything! We woke at about 4AM the following morning to the strong smell of cigarette smoke which my wife traced to be coming from the aircon unit, we just opened windows and carried on but we came home that evening and the room stank of fags again!! We went back down to check-in....they offered to get security to patrol the corridor which wasn't where the smell was coming from and after some discussion they changed our room again which was the 2nd in 24hrs but in fairness was not their doing. The final room was great and had a view of the Police precinct and the now closed Fire Dept. Yeah there was some noise, we were on 6th, but hey it's New York and a busy city and didn't bother us much, BUT.... As mentioned before in other reviews the gaps around the door were huge and light from the corridor streamed through...we had a ritual each evening of plugging around the door with magazines,scarves and towels which worked...but should you have to for the price you pay bearing in mind it's a Hilton and refurbished??? Also when we were waiting to go home all I seemed to see two porters in particular do was count their tips, one had a missive 'wad' of notes which he would stand in the foyer and count. I have to be honest in that we wouldn't stay here again because of what happened but the staff were extremely helpful when we went to them with the problems, I couldn't fault them at all, the problem I think lies with the hotel itself and not enough thought when the refurb went ahead... Oh yeah the cookies were great. Hope this long review helps.

<Title>“Good value and location”
<Content>I stayed here with 4 family members during thanksgiving week. We had picked this hotel as i had hilton honors points to use-and the doubletree is a hilton family hotel. Check in was very speedy as there is a dedicated checkin for honors members. Warm cookies which we received on arrival were gorgeous. We were given room upgrades and free breakfast for the week which was a major saving as eating out all the time can be expensive. Rooms were comfortable, bed linen and towels were clean. lcd tv worked fine. This hotel is very very close to a subway stop-about 10 metres from the front door and taxi fares back were always less than 12 dollars with tip..even from lower manahattan. Some great restaurants in the area on 2nd and 3rd avenues, especially zarella-mexican restaurant.Went to O'Neils around the corner which had good food but expensive. Drinks in hotel bar are expensive. Japanese/Sushi restaurant round the corner beside o'neils is excellent and very reasonable - 20 dollars for 3 course lunch. I only have 2 complaints-the air conditioning was very noisy and there was no anti-slip mat in the shower and i slipped quite badly one night and fell out of the shower... Other than that, 7.5/10.

<Title>“Great location + great rooms. Will stay again”
<Content>Overall, I was incredibly impressed with this hotel. The location is fantastic. No matter how you choose to get to Manhattan, the hotel is easy to locate. Not far from Grand Central, and on a major Subway link – it couldn’t be easier. I want to start this review with about the only negative impression I got – and that was at check in. The guy behind the desk didn’t seem interested that I’d be staying at the hotel, he just did what he had to do and that was it. No conversation. No welcome. I just got a room card. He only just remembered to give me my free cookie (a nice touch). My room was on the second floor which I was slightly concerned about as I had heard that the street noise is quite loud. However, when I entered my room you couldn’t hear anything more than the general hum of New York. This is my first time to New York, but the room was a lot quieter than in other major cities I’ve stayed in. Even during the night, there was no need to worry about the noise. The rooms were nicely decorated. The hotel had been refurbished last year I believe, but the rooms still looked like new. The beds were huge and very comfortable. There was an office-like chair in front of the desk and a chaise long in the corner of the room which was very comfortable if you get chance to sit and watch TV – which was a plasma screen – another nice little touch. The bathroom was on the small side, but it was split into two, with the toilet and shower/bath in one section, behind the door, and the wash basin was in front of the door. Overall, there was plenty of space for what was necessary, but if you like a big bathroom you may be disappointed. Despite it’s size, the bathroom was nicely decorated. The shower was very powerful (which is a must for me!) and had a number of setting depending on how you like your shower. There was also adequate wardrobe space – including quite a lot of hangers instead of the usual one or two! I didn’t have time to use the fitness facilities at the hotel, but did take a look and the equipment all looked fairly new. After my second night in the hotel, there was a message asking me to call reception. They said there had been a ‘problem’ in the room next door and they were having to relocate people to other rooms. I was a little annoyed at this inconvenience, but the hotel staff were incredibly helpful – they even offered to help me pack and then unpack my stuff. I politely declined as I didn’t have too much. I was relocated to the 9th floor and the room was exactly the same standard as my first room. I would therefore presume that they were all of this standard. As an apology for the inconvenience, I got loads of free cookies, plus another one each day in a cookie jar in my room, a free newspaper each day plus tickets for free buffet-breakfast for the rest of my stay which made the whole move ok! I was staying room only as most hotels charge ridiculous prices for their breakfasts, and the Doubletree Metropolitan was no exception, however armed with my free breakfast token, I indulged every morning. The food was freshly prepared and there was a wide selection to choose from. Everything from a traditional cooked breakfast to cereals, fruit salads, fresh fruit plus lots more. The food was very nice – but still wouldn’t have paid their price for it. The service that the staff in the hotel provided was (with the exception of the check in guy) exemplary. Nothing was too much hassle and I didn’t feel like I was asking the earth if I needed something. The concierge were brillirant and booked me a helicopter flight with Liberty Helicopters and the porters were always ready to help with luggage storage and they always had a cab ready if you needed it. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again and would definitely recommend it to anyone – businesses or pleasure travellers. I will definitely be staying here on my next visit to New York.

<Title>“Can't wait to go back!”
<Content>I loved this hotel and can't wait to stay there again. I had 4 nights there at the beginning of November with a girl friend. The room was clean and a good size for New York, particularly considering it had 2 double beds in it. The beds were so comfy! The bathroom was a little on the small side but hey, who comes to New York to spend all their time in the bathroom! It was clean and functional so that scores points in my book. We had no problems with the reception staff, check in was quick and easy - the warm chocolate chip cookies were delicious! Had trouble trying to use the internet access in the room which I was charged for (even though it didn't work) but after explaining the problem at check-out, it was taken off my account without argument. We were on the 9th floor which was lovely and quiet. The location is great - it took us about 20 minutes to walk to Times Square but it was perfectly safe, even late at night. The hotel is close to Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, the Rockefeller Centre and the subway. Plenty of places to eat nearby, lots of coffee shops. The cafe right next door to the hotel was open late and their latte was much nicer than Starbucks! And it had the most amazing cheesecakes! The whole area outside the hotel was always busy and had a real New York vibe to it - a film was being shot right across the street. Got the subway down to Battery Park on my own one morning, again felt very safe, there was a policeman on the platform who gave me directions. Can recommend doing the Sex and the City tour (not for children!) and visiting the top of the Rockefeller Centre which had just opened when we were there - the views were amazing. This hotel is in a great location for exploring New York - from Battery Park I walked all the way back up one morning, stopping at shops and walking through different areas of New York. Central Park was just a few blocks higher up - this is a great hotel and my husband and I are already considering booking it again for next year.

<Title>“Fantastic!”
<Content>The room was everything we'd hoped for - and then some. Between the stainless steel sink and fixtures in the bathroom, the luxurious down bedding and warm decor in general, it was very appealing and cozy. I slept like a rock in that bed. The staff was impressive, most notable the Concierge named Jason. He was phenomenal!! He got us 5th row seats to see Blue Man Group (on a Saturday night) with less than 24 hrs notice. He was extremely helpful and because of him we ate like kings in some of the best restaurants in the area. We would definitely stay there again. The location was very convenient. Close to Times Square, Rockefeller Center and great shopping. If you're into sightseeing, it's conveniently close to the Waldord Astoria which is where you can catch a free shuttle to the docks for one of the sightseeing cruises, sightseeing tour buses also stop here to pick up riders. Anyone who knows how much is costs to take a cab from one side to town to the other will appreciate the free shuttle. Great hotel!!

<Content>Stayed for six nights at the end of October with my wife. Comfortable, clean hotel. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful (must have caught different shifts from other reviewers). Large double bed was extremely comfortable, and room was exceptionally quiet for a large hotel with room frontage on to 51st Street. Great location in midtown with plenty of diners and deli spots close by. In house food looked a bit expensive, but didn't try so can't comment on quality.

<Title>“It did the job !”
<Content>Stayed there with my wife for a 3 night flying visit. Of course the cookies were great as was the bar area next to reception, and whilst the room generally had been lovingly refurbished, it didn't quite feel that the bathroom had been given the same attention. Don't remember which floor was on but only remember looking directly onto a not very attractive block. On the plus side I guess that reduced chance of noise from the main street. Didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment. Good location for all attractions, next to subway and 5/10 mins from Bloomingdales etc.

<Content>Stayed one night; Hilton Honors upgraded us to a suite and got breakfast for two. Had a balcony. Room was large w/all ammenities except: 1. needs a coffe pot and 2. high speed access should be free-they have it in the lobby,but it is ridiculous not to have it in the rooms--Bathroom small but well equipment, bed was extremely comfy and of course, the hot chocolate chip cookie when you check in is a great touch. We usually stay at boutique hotels and so for a large chain, this was an ideal stop for us.

The room was nice. The bed and pillows were wonderful. The bathroom is a little small but was not a big drawback. The next day I wanted to go sightseeing and Danny took care of my luggage. He also made arrangements for myself and a couple of other people in our group to have a car waiting for us to go to the airport when we got back.

<Title>“Great place to base your visit”
<Content>I booked this hotel for a five day stay in September to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. This turned out to be a great choice for a number of reasons. Firstly the room was excellent and a good size for New York, fresh and clean with the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in. The location was ideal with a subway station at the corner for trips uptown or downtown and easy access to the tour bus which stopped one block down in front of the Waldorf. You are right in the middle of midtown and you can walk everywhere, we both found the staff to be very helpful and accommodating especially the concierge who booked restaurants for us whenever we asked and provided recommendations to some excellent places. We found most people respond to a smile. The hotel is not large and as we were on the 8th floor the views were not spectacular but by the time we got back we really did not care. Could not comment on the eating facilities in the hotel as we ate out for every meal. There are a number of small cafés on each corner which serve breakfast so we tended to use these as you can watch life go by in this busy city. If you want a good base in an area with lots of restaurants and attractions within an easy walking distance then this is ideal.

<Title>“Wonderful stay”
<Content>At first, I was reluctant to book this hotel because of the mixed reviews here in tripadvisor. But after searching for so many hotels that had good reviews and on a budget price (that were near to our target destination but not available for our scheduled trip), I ended up with Doubletree Met. I was nervous at first because my husband is expecting that our first trip in NYC to be a very good one. But Im glad to say, that our experience with Doubletree Met is so wonderful my husband wants us to stay there again for our second visit to New York. When checking in, I was expecting for the people in the front desk to be rude but no, they were so friendly and cheerful. They gave us those oh so deliciousl chocolate cookies. The lobby is just ok, nothing grand. We were surprised how clean and big our room is. My husband and I just loooooved the bed. I would love to have that kind of bed in our home. I really had a very wonderful night sleep there. The housekeeping lady was very nice. But I have a small tiny problem with the bathroom though. I dont like the smell of the shower curtain. It smells like...hmmm dont know really how to describe it. Other than that, the rest of our stay in DT Met is a fab. I couldnt ask for more of the hotel's location. Its basically walking distance to so many attractions in NYC and there's a near subway station on the side of the hotel. We are definitely going to stay here again!

<Content>this is a great hotel. i reiterate what others have said - the rooms are a little on the small side, but what do you expect for new york? the rooms are new, clean, and have a very metro feel to them - even have a flat panel lcd in the rooms. my wife is really a stickler on having a clean room and this place made her feel at ease. we originally booked a room at the sheraton manhattan (the worst hotel of all time) - got into the room and it was pretty much motel 6 quality (wet carpet, mold, peeling wallpaper) - got on the computer and immediately did a search for a new hotel - found this place and jumped on it. i was a little wary, considering it was such short notice, but it turned out to be great. it's a great location, the subway stops are right out the door on 51st/lex. one stop up is bloomingdales, one stop south is grand central. within walking distance of just about everything - moma, rockefeller, even central pk isn't that far away. would stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>I am a Hilton Gold member and this was my first stay in New York. I had a room on the 16th floor and it was pretty nice, flat screen TV, the only knock was the bathroom was super small. The Location is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! I almost switched reservations last minute because of what I read and I am sure glad I didn't. 5 minute walk to 5th Ave shopping, 10 minute walk to times square, 20 minute walk to Central Park. I couldn't have been more pleased with the location. The reason I didn't give it an excellant is because the conciearge gave us an absolutly awful recomendation for dinner on Saturday before the play. My wife and the other couple we were with got up and left. I would stay here again!

<Content>For our 2,5day trip we booked for a fair price (payed in advance) a nice queen size room. Checkin was ok, the guys for the storage could be more friendly and quick - but it's ok. Clean room, nice bathroom. The rooms are not big, but when we're in NYC the room is just for sleeping. Location is perfect because of the Metro Station directly in front of the Hotel, the Metro Cafe (for breakfast recommended with a Starbucks coffee from over the street) and nice restaurants along 51st. Just a few steps away from the W hotels bar, the Waldorf Astoria, Grand Central and Chrysler building . Perfect! We had a room facing the street with the fire and police station - and we heard nothing! Much better than staying on Time Square! Whenever we come back, we'll stay again in the Metropolitan.

<Content>OK, let me start wirth this: It`s not the RITZ, THE MARRIOTT or any other 4 or 5 Star Hotel but pretty close to it! Stayed there for 6 nights and got the best deal ever on expedia (140 DOLLARS / Night for a double room withount Breakfast). Stayed on 5th floor. (544) This was actually one of the smallest rooms on this floor. (Could see that on the fire escape plan) The Room was big enough for NYC and very clean. The Police/Firestation was loud only one night (Sunday->Monday) The other nights were absolutely alright even with our window facing to that street.

<Content>This hotel is in the perfect location in new york. It is right next to the 6 train which will take you almost anywhere in New York. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The rooms have been updated and are actually very nice. The best thing is that it is reasonable. I stayed for three nights and it was an excellent deal. I will note that it is a large hotel so if you are looking for a quiet place to stay this might not be it. There were plenty of tourists crowding the lobby ,and the outside noise was a bit much at times. So I suggest staying as high up as possible. The staff is helpful but not really in the know. Get your suggestions for trendy places in advance or from locals. The overall experience was great.

<Title>“Great value, fantastic location = 9.5 out of 10”
<Content>We stayed here last week and it was fantastic. Warm cookie was a happy surprise, and super-comfy beds compensated for the smallish rooms. 2 adults and 2 teenagers for 3 nights was a little cramped, but we didn't spend much time awake in the room anyway. We got a killer deal on their website--approx $150/night, practically unheard of for this area and this level of accommodations. Awesome location just a few feet away from the subway station which enabled us to travel all over Manhattan quickly and easily! Only a few minutes walk to Times Square and Rockefeller Plaza! The Metro Cafe located right outside the revolving door was a dieter's heaven. Delicious gourmet healthy food available all day and night long (not sure of the hours but they were open at midnight when we got back to the hotel from a long day of sightseeing). They had something for everyone! I would definitely stay here again and again.

<Content>I don't understand why someone would not think the Doubletree Metropolitan is centrally located! You are right on Lexington Avenue, with a subway literally underfoot. Of course, it's not Fifth Avenue and it's not Times Square, but it's a nice -- very nice -- and pricey neighborhood! Away from the tourist madness. The room was spotless, great modern furnishings and wonderful bed. Not too small by NYC standards. The service was efficient and people friendly. Breakfast buffet left a little to be desired...no pancakes or waffles, only french toast. If you don't like eggs or meat there's only pastries and cereal. The only negative thing I would have to say is that some of the sleek, modern furniture in the lobby needs a good cleaning. Orange swivel chairs...I'm looking at you! This is a really nice hotel at a great price. Our room rate was around $200, which, when you consider it's about the same as the Red Roof, is a bargain for NYC.

<Title>“2 Thumbs Up!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here for a 2 night getaway. We booked through Priceline for $130 per night. We did drive into the city from Virginia and parked the car for $30 per day. We had a good check in experience with nice friendly staff. We got into the city much earlier then our 3:00pm check in and since they had a room available they checked us in early (10:00 am) so that was fantastic! The room was very nice. The bed comfortable and the bathroom very spacious. Many people complain about the location. I think it is a very good location. It is centrally located if you are interested in doing more than just the Times Square thing. It's perfect for going Uptown or to Central Park and just a bus or train ride away from whatever you want to see or do. You are in New York so be prepared to walk. If you want to see the city, Midtown Manhattan is a perfect spot in my opinion.

<Title>“Above Average-But not centrally located”
<Content>My family of 5 stayed here July 13-17,2005. We checked in early at 2:00pm, with no wait at all (When we left Sunday, early check-ins were coming in at 1pm, but there was a long,moving, line). One problem I did encounter at check-in was we had reserved a 2 bed room, plus rollaway. I had received an email from Hilton Reservattions stating the rollaway was at no charge, and even presented it to the clerk. He stated they made a mistake and the charge was $25/night. I was tired from the long flight and did not feel like arguing, but I will be sending a complaint letter to Hilton Cutomer Service. The room was average size ( I actually expected smaller by the reports I had read), and the bathroom is cramped, but workable. The beds are VERY comfortable, probably the best I have slept on away from home. Our remote control was missing, and they sent one up immediately, with a coupon for more cookies for our trouble (Those cookies are GREAT !). The rollaway took 2 calls to finally get it delievered, and it was beat-up, but fine. The ice machine was broken the first day we were there, but fixed later, but I found it interesting that it is tucked away in the storage/housekeeping area, and I probably could have moved one of the rollaways stored in this area to my room and save the 25 bucks ! Our room was 1407, and had a very obstructed view of the hotel next door, but we did not need a view, and it likely kept the noise down. I agree with the earlier post, the gap at the bottom of the door is ridiculously large, allowing too much light and hallway noise in. Placing a towel in it at night resolved this issue. We did not eat in the hotel, as it was never busy, and I would like to see more people eating there to feel that it is worth it. The Cafe Metro next door, and other close cafes were more that adequate for a good breakfast. Location is the only problem we had, we will likely pick a more centrally located hotel next time.The Lexington line subway is right outside the door, and this was great going to Battery Park/Statue of Liberty, but not so for Times Square/etc. My wife and I did discover that going east, instead of heading to central Manhattan, that there is a plethra of great bars to visit. I would highly recommend JD's, an Irish Pub, I think near 53 (52nd?), between Lexington and 3rd Ave. A great Irish bartender gave us great insight to the city, and the atmosphere was great. Overall, I little pricey for what we got, but clean and staff was average.

<Title>“Excellent place to stay if you don't mind the walk”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here for our 3 year anniversary. We booked it late (about 4-6 days before we drove to NY from Baltimore) and were able to get a room. I would have preferred to stay closer to Time Square... but during peak season rates, and accounting for last minute availability.. these were two factors that were not on my side. With that being said, I have relatively nothing to complain about in regards to this hotel. It was VERY clean, modern looking furniture was cool, flat screen tv in the room was nice, freindly staff, descent location (right in the shopping district). It was a bit of a walk to Time Square though. I'm not much of a walker, so by the time we strolled up to Time Square after all days walking around the shopping district... I was definitely taking a cab ride back. Best $15 I spent all weekend. :-) To be honest, if you don't mind walking a little bit... this hotel is definitely the choice for you! By FAR it was the biggest, most spacious room I've stayed at in NY. The bathrooms were clean too. That's always a plus! There's a cool modern bar down in the lobby, we didn't stop in but it wasn't very noisy and seamed pretty low key. If your out for a bite to eat, I'd recommend Georgio O'Neils Steak House only a block away. The guest services at the hotel pointed us in their direction for a reasonable and romantic place to eat. And they were right on point. But hey.... if all else wasn't said... they had me at "hello, here's a free hot cookie compliments of the DoubleTree hotel". ;-)

<Title>“Nothing to complain about”
<Content>We stayed June 28-July 3rd. The Doubletree is in a great location, most attractions are close, and there is a subway station across the street. We asked for a nice room and were given the highest floor (19th). The room was small, so was the bathroom, but except for the used bar of soap (taken care of immediately) it was always clean and the beds were very comfy. Noise was not a problem except for Sat night when someone was yelling in the hallway. I guess we were too high up for the street noise. We ate at the next door Cafe Metro almost every day for breakfast or a late snack. I think I would stay there again.

<Title>“Worh value”
<Content>We stay at the hotel for 3 nights in June 18. We arrive early for check in after a long trip and we have no problems. We obtain a room in 4th floor just in front of the police station, we talked to the reception and were change of room. Our next room has some problem with the ac. A supervisor came inmediately and as they saw it will take some time they upgrade us the room. This new room was very good, a wonderful bed, plasma tv, good bathroom and spacious. The location of the hotel is excellent. I think what we pay for this hotel was ok. And if I could have reserve it with more time in advance would have obtain a better price. Now I see it is much less in price. Maybe $170.00 is its price, but we paid $250.00 I recommed this hotel

<Title>“If Ikea furnished a hotel...”
<Content>...it would be the Metropolitan. Kinda cool at first but by the end of the week it left me cold. Which sums up my experience at this hotel nicely: It's nice, but there are some things that annoy me, too. The bed is very comfortable. Rooms are on the small side unless you get bumped to an executive level. Great location. Indifferent bell staff, great front desk people. The restaurant is decent but pricey and there are lots of dining choices in the surrounding neighborhood, too. Overall, I've been pleased enough to stay there twice and return again tomorrow, so I can't knock them too hard, but if they'd just kick the service up a notch this would be an outstanding hotel.

<Title>“Very nice city hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the Doubletree Hotel on 50th and Lex during a short business trip. The hotel used to be called Metropole Hotel and was taken over by Hilton/Doubletree recently. Almost all of the rooms have been renovated in a minimalist, designy style, and have nice beds with fluffy pillows. The television is a flat screen, which goes well with the decor of the room. The bathrooms are stocked with Neutrogena products, and you can get Internet connection in your room for $10 a day (wireless is available in the lobby for free). We stayed in the executive room, which has a bit more space than the regular rooms--- I took a tour of the smaller room and I think the price difference is justified. I would take the executive room and pay a bit more. The service is fine: the front desk receptionist Karen is one of the friendliest and nicest hoteliers I've ever met. Each guest is greeted with a warm chocolate chip cookie, which is funny considering we are in tough, very un-chocolate chip cookie NYC. One thing that irritated me was when I checked my luggage in with the concierge for storage (I had a late afternoon flight), he told me: "Oh I won't be here when you come back to pick up your suitcase." Kind of too obvious in his effort to get a tip. You can have breakfast in the hotel or at Starbucks down the block and an equally good cafe nextdoor. The W hotel is right next door as well, and you can go for a drink at the bar.

<Title>“Not bad, not fantastic”
<Content>I stayed at the Doubletree Metro over the weekend of June 17-19. I generally agree with many of the comments made by other posters including the great location, generally good value and comfy beds. I did not have the AC problems others had, but apparently the AC had been turned on by mid-June. I did not hear the fire engines, but maybe it was just a slow weekend for the fire dept. My negatives: I was not greeted at all at the front desk. The man who checked me in pointed to my room number and told me where the elevators were and said nothing else to me! He could have used some guest service training. I also agree with others about the outrageous price of the continental breakfast. I am a Hilton Honors Gold member, and was disappointed that the supposed lounge was closed on weekends. Although I was given one free breakfast coupon per day for the Metro downstairs, my friend staying with me would have had to pay full price (we did not eat breakfast at the hotel anyway). Finally, I agree with others commenting on the lack of noise buffering between the room doors and the hallway. My conclusion--great location and adequate facility that is worth it if one can find a special rate/bargain rate. Nothing overly special about the place though.

<Title>“Worth It! DoubleTree Metropolitan (51st&Lexington)”
<Content>June 10-11th: Took a shot with this one and was great! The room was recently remodeled, nice linens--even a down comforter, soft towels. Flat screen TV too. Perfectly clean bathroom. Fresh warm cookies upon arrival. Was a bit small, but it is NY--was perfect for two people. Had a personal safe in the room--bonus! The bellman even held my luggage until 7pm after checkout when I had to catch the train home. we were plesantly surprised to stumble upon the subway stop right on the corner...couldn't have been more convenient! I was reluctant to pay the price, but was worth it for a clean room, good service, safe neighborhood and convenience--would definitely stay again!

<Title>“Pleasant Stay at Doubletree”
<Content>We enjoyed our stay at the Doubletree Metropolitan. We were able to check in when we arrived around 1pm. The room was very clean, it was a little small--but I have seen smaller in NYC. I thought the bed was extremely comfy. Air worked great--thank goodness because it a humid 90 degrees outside. Bathrooms were small but clean and nice--everything in room looked new. Very modern decor. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Only one problem--when we entered our room, I was a little shocked to find a repairman in the bathroom and later that afternoon a maid just walked in the room while we were watching TV--she was very apologetic, but after that we put the "Do Not Disturb" sign out and latched the door!! Keep in mind that prices in the Bar and Room Service are a little steep, but after all, it is NYC. We liked the location-the subway entrance is just steps from the hotel and never a problem getting a cab here--we would definitely stay here again--try booking on Octupustravel--I save about 100 bucks on the going rate.

I complain twice to the front desk manager said since the weather temp. was 68-72 degrees there is no need for A/C. The individual room controls didn't work. Never again. this is a 2 star hotel. The rugs in the hotel were very dirty. I wanted to book into other hotel however everything was already booked.

<Title>“Very good hotel with some staff problems”
<Content>Although the hotel opened after renovation in 2004, I was still able to get a pre-opening rate (186 USD) for a king executive room for May 2005 on Doubletree's website including lounge access - at least so it said on my reservation confirmation. Upon arrival, I was asked by an rather arrogant front desk staff member if would like the twin bed room I reserved (?). Furthermore, she denied lounge access stating, that the lounge is for Hilton HHonors status members only. She got the manager for me, who said the same thing. Showing him my confirmation print-out which clearly stated "lounge access", he oh so generously gave me continental breakfast coupons for the Met Grill, but only for five out of seven days, stating that the lounge is closed on weekends (in fact, for those weekend days guests with lounge access get breakfast coupons, too), repeatedly saying "I don't have to do this". THANK YOU VERY MUCH! After that unpleasent incident, a bellman showed me my king room on 14th floor (I wonder if that really was an executive room as the exec floors are according to my confirmation floors 16-19, but front desk said so at check-in) facing 51st Street with its police and fire station which was NYC standard size and well appointed with flat screen TV (although NY1 and Weather channels missing) and the best bed I ever slept in at an U. S. hotel, Doubletree's new Sweet Dreams bed, with lots of cushions and downs. Bathroom featured Neutrogena toiletries and lots of hot water. Room attendants did a great job: room was very, very clean, they replaced the many towels every day. Bed linens were changed on a daily basis, too. Don't believe that the new windows are sound proof (as mentioned on some websites) - they are merely sound-resistant, but nevertheless keep enough noise out to have a good night's sleep. The biggest noise problem (as many reviewers mentioned before) comes from the inside: the very thin doors with a huge gap between door and frame which let a lot of sound and light through and which you can't close without a major "bang". IMHO, it should not be a problem giving those doors some rubber isolation. The in-room safe deposit box was a nice touch. Two features I at first wondered what all the fuzz was about were very good: the really delicious warm signature cookie you get upon arrival and the arched shower bar, which prevents the shower curtain from sticking to your wet body. I was not so impressed with the hairdryer, whichs cord was only about 6 inches long (prepare for unusual hairdos using the hairdryer head-down). Breakfast buffet in the bunker-like Met Grill with its stained chairs was a laugh riot considering - not holding coupons - you have to pay 20 USD for continental and 26 USD for an pathetic American breakfast. Luckily, there are enough diners and other hotels you can have breakfast at in the proximity of the hotel. Unlike guests rooms around me, mine never got a morning newspaper, although I am Hilton HHonors member (apparently they think foreigners can't read English, anyway). Check-out was a breeze, but only because I had some phone fees for 1-800 calls removed from my account beforehand (front desk said, they were still having problems with the phone system - Hello? The hotel is open more than half a year and is surely not the first to run this system!) Location of the hotel is great: several subway lines and downtown buslines right outside the door, crosstown und uptown bus lines only one or two blocks away. To sum this stay up: if you get a good rate, absolutely stay there! If only they improved the doors and management/front desk attitude, the hotel would be perfect.

<Content>Read some recent reviews and decided to stay at this doubletree got a decent rate through orbitz. The room was quite roomy by any standards (not just new york). Nicely furnished with a flatscreen TV. Room service prompt and staff was friendly and helpful without being overbearing. I asked for a room away from the fire station and on an upper floor- they upgraded me to a King although I only booked a queen. Excellent location! I will definitely try to stay here next time I go to New York! The only slight complaint I would have is I couldn't access internet from my room without my own laptop but if you have your own or don't mind going to the business center, everything else was near perfect.

<Title>“Great Location - Lackluster Hotel”
<Content>Step out the front door of the hotel and you almost fall down the stairway into the 51St Station of the #6 train as well as the E and V trains (53rd St). The rooms are clean and modern but far from impressive. As another reviewer pointed out, they don't even have a coffee maker and, for high speed internet, you pay nearly $11 per day. The only "perk" is the chocolate chip cookie you get at check-in but that's a Doubletree trademark and not unique to this location. The staff is pleasant enough but there is nothing special about this hotel. If you can get it very cheap and you're staying for a night or two, you will be more than satisfied. Otherwise I would look elsewhere.

<Title>“Great Location!!”
<Content>Just came back from 2 nights at the DM, April 21-22, and we loved the location. We flew in to see "Wicked" (which was amazing!) and the hotel is about a half mile from the Gershwin Theater. Hotel staff suggested we walked to the theater because traffic would be terrible that time of day and we would probably get there quicker on foot. They were right!! I had on 3 inch heels and even though we walked slowly it only took us about 15 minutes to get there. Passed Ruth's Chris Steakhouse and Radio City Music Hall along the way. The rooms are newly renovated. They are very modern looking and small. You have plenty of room to walk around, but there is no extra space or mini-fridge. The bathroom was the smallest one I have ever seen!! We booked thru hilton.com and paid $239 for a king bed. I am Hilton Gold and had expected to be able to use the Executive Lounge for breakfast, but it is closed due to renovations, so they gave us coupons for continental breakfast. The normal charge is $20 for continental and for $6 more you can have the hot food at the buffet. Very overpriced for what it is - but that's New York. There are a lot of restaurants within walking distance, so explore the city a little bit and avoid the hotel food. Loved the flat screen tv and the safe. We had plenty of towels, great bed, and because it was cool we didn't need the a/c. I woud agree with the other reviewers, you can not adjust the temperature. You get what they offer, so if it's too hot, or to cold you will have to get over it. Because of the great location we took the subway everywhere. We took it in from LGA, to Battery Park (Statue of Liberty), Ground Zero and the Empire State Building. Jamba Juice is half a block away, Grand Central Station and the Chrysler building are only blocks away. We enjoyed our stay at the Doubletree and we have already decided the next time we go to New York we will stay there. I usually stay at the Hilton New York when I am in the city, but I will try the Doubletree for a while.

<Title>“Very nice and great location”
<Content>Found a rate of $249 on Expedia for superior/king suite. The beds are very comfortable--Doubletree is giving Westin a run for their money here. There was a flat screen TV and a fainting/lounge chair in the room, both of which my husband thought were terribly cool. I had read the trip advisor comments about the doors slamming and really didn't seem to notice. I did see, however, that there is about a 3/4-inch clearance between the bottom of the door and the floor, because a lot of light was getting in to the room at night--a towel shut the light out, and maybe some of the noise. I am a light sleeper, and the doors didn't keep me awake. The room was clean with plenty of towels and the staff was very, very friendly and helpful. I really liked the fact that there aren't too many children or college kids that stay here. There was very little noise in the hallway. It seems to be an older/business crowd, possibly because of the price point. The location is perfect--not too close to the hustle but not too far away either. There is a subway stop--the 6 line--right around the corner. Metro Cafe next door has wonderful Panini sandwiches and a salad bar. We didn't eat at the hotel because it looked too expensive and we hardly saw anyone else eating there anyway. The bar was nice but I'm still trying to understand why I paid $16 plus a service charge for one drink (a well Bloody Mary). Now, for the ugly: This place is right across the street from a fire station!!! I don't remember reading about this before on trip advisor. We were really worried when we checked in on Sunday afternoon as the trucks left about 10 times with blaring sirens. I think maybe they do more checks on Sundays or something, because we didn't really hear any more sirens throughout our stay (left on Wednesday). And we don't remember hearing any sirens after about 7 p.m. Another thing--I had read on Trip Advisor that the air conditioning doesn't work well--SO CORRECT! This hotel, as many other older hotels, is on a boiler system--so it's either hot or cold air. The front desk informed me they hadn't switched the AC on for the summer yet. So all you can control is air flow--which there really wasn't any. I had called the front desk before our stay to make sure they have individual climate controls in the room--which they do, but you can't adjust the temperature at all. Thank God we stayed here in the Spring and it wasn't too unbearable--just slept on top of the sheets. I guess we would have the same situation in any other older hotel in the city. Lastly, there are no coffee makers available for the rooms. I have stayed at probably 10 different Doubletrees all over the country and they always have coffee makers. Seems they might need the money to help pay for the renovations they just completed or something. There's a Starbucks across the street, at the NW intersection of 51st and Lexington inside an office building.

<Title>“Faultless”
<Content>Visited New York for the first time, a week's visit combining a 21st and an 18th birthday trip for my two eldest boys. All of the refurbishing has been completed in both the lobby and the rooms. Could not imagine a better deal at the price of about $200 per room. Comfiest beds we have ever slept in, and among the quietest rooms - the only noise was that of the aircon units outside the hotel (we had a back room), which lulled one to sleep. Could be noisier in Lexington / Police station facing rooms. (You would expect that anyway in NY! Madrid is much noisier.) Concierge an absolute buzz at giving information. Every query dealt with immediately. Bar a bit pricey but a good meeting place before going out on the town. The location is excellent - right next to Grand Central, almost underneath the Chrysler building, and next door to the tube. Food so cheap in the location - from the Grand Central food mall to the Waldorf's restaurant. Find of the week had to be the Indian Restaurant, two blocks around the corner DARBAR. Most courteous service I've ever had, and some of the finest food at a superb price. Go on your first night and you'll have to return. Excellent place to get your bearings. When we go back, we'll re-book this hotel. Had a look at some of the other contenders which we considered prior to the visit. Nothing matched it considering location, appearance and price.

<Content>I found this hotel to be a GREAT bargain!!($150 + taxes on priceline). Got upgraded to a King bedroom at no extra charge. Warm chewy chocolate chip cookies upon check-in. Staff was courteous. Room was clean and updated. Bathroom fixtures were stylish. There was a conveniently located 2nd phone in the bathroom so you didn't miss calls. Bed was comfortable. The best part was location. The subway to the 6 line was just right outside the front door. The alarm clock in our room was busted, as the snooze button didn't work, but I guess that's a good thing if you really need to get up. I would definitely come here again. In-room safe was a great, much used amenity! :)

<Title>“Average NYC hotel”
<Content>My Husband,11 month old daughter and I stayed for 3 nights in March. We pulled up to the entrance to unload and were greeted with a smiling face. The bellhop/doorman was very friendly and helpful. He brought our bags into the hotel but did not bring them to the room. Instead he handed them off to a very strange unfriendly porter. He did not say one word to me and the ride to yhe 5th floor was very uncomfortable. I did not even want to tip him but I did. I would have rather given the extra $20 to the bellhop/doorman. The room was nicely decorated. It was modern,but not cold ,ultra-modern. The flat panel tv was great and we were able to hook up our portable dvd player to it. The bed was very comfortable. They even brought in a full size crib for my daughter. There was absolutely no climate control in the room. So therefore it got very stuffy in there,not to mention you need some kind of fan or white noise to drown out the city noise at night. The first night was rough. We wondered, why all the sirens? We looked out of our window and to our dismay, there was a fire department across the street. The door to the hallway was not very sound proof. I heard detailed conversation from inside of my room. It made me wonder If everyone outside could hear what was going on in my room. Room service was was very friendly but not worth the money. Go out of the hotel and go directly to your right for some really good food at the Cafe Metro. They have just about anything you would want to eat at great prices. I would definetly recommend this hotel to any families traveling with infants and to business travelers. My husband was there for business also. He had no problems getting online and getting a cab in front of the hotel. We did not use the concierge or go to the bar, so I cannot comment.This hotel is great for a short stay if you get a good price. We paid pretax, $299/nt online. My husband's business associate paid $239/nt for the same nights. He called the hotel direct and made his reservations. Shop around.

<Title>“Good Choice”
<Content>Just stayed three nights at the Doubletree Metropolitan. Our room had a King bed and faced Lexington Avenue, on the 8th floor. The room was very clean and simple but stylish design. I thought the flat screen TV in the room was pretty nice for that price of hotel. I really have no complaints about the hotel itself. We could hear so many horns honking, but I'm sure that just comes with the city. After awhile, I was able to tune it out and fell sleep nicely. The high-speed internet access was about $11 per 24 hours. There is a nice Cafe Metro right next door which has an assortment of things for breakfast and lunch, with late hours too. I would definetely stay here again!

<Content>Our stay was from march 4th 2005 till 7th march. For my 21st my partner took me to New York shopping he gave me the choice of hotels and i picked the doubletree met!!!!!!!!! Dreading what it would be like we pulled up and for once i had made the best decision! Staff were friendly check in was quick and the room was fabulous. Quiet, modern and spacious situated centrally to all great locations! I had read so many bad reviews on this hotel and was dreading our arrival imagining the worst, but i would like to clarify that this is a great hotel you cant go wrong with.... well worth it! If you pick this hotel your stay in the big apple will be perfect.

<Title>“Let's see what happens when the renovations are done”
<Content>Stayed three nights at the Doubletree in February 2005. The room was clean and the bed very comforatable, but they squeezed a king bed into a room too narrow for it, and the desk chair filled the space between the desk and the bed so you have to climb around it to get to the window. A lot of the hotel was under renovation: the "business center" was closed, and a couple of other common rooms on the first floor were blocked off. I was not able to get internet access in my room, and when I called the internet provider at the hotel was told to go to the business center to make sure the problem was not with my computer. When I called back to tell them there was no business center, they insisted there was one. In any case, it turns out the internet was down for two days hotel-wide. The hotel failed to inform people of this, which was the only service failure I experienced. I am sure a lot of guests wasted a lot of time on the phone with the internet provider who wouldn't have if they'd been told that the problem was hotel-wide. It was clear that they were still working out some issues in the rebranding from the old Loew's brand to the Doubletree, so I'll try again. It's very convenient to the Park Avenue business and has great potential

<Title>“Nice, but the room doors need to be quieter”
<Content>I stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan February 18-20, 2005. I had a room on the 14th floor and did not face the street. Yes, the hotel's location is excellent with its proximity to several subway lines. The hotel's hip decor is nice-- the lobby and bar, remodeled room and bathroom, and the LCD television. But my room didn't have a coffee maker, so I had to get dressed every morning and run downstairs for a cup. Fortunately, a Starbucks is a block away on the corner of 50th & Lexington. My biggest complaint was that while I was in my room, I heard each door of the nearby surrounding rooms close very loudly as other guests came and went. I felt like I was sleeping in a college dorm room. Despite this, I didn't hear any noise through the walls from adjoining rooms. I hope the management decides to fix the door-closing problem.

The room was clean, of adequate size (for NYC) and had an extremely comfortable king-sized bed. I paid 125 dollars a night before taxes and would rate this an excellent bargain

<Title>“Great Hotel, Great Location”
<Content>My partner and I stopped at the Metropolitan 10-15th Feb 2005. On arrival we were greeted by courteous staff and a delicious cookie! Our room was on the 12th floor and was at the back of the hotel (We could see the Chrysler Building from our room). The room was clean and spacious with a courtesy safe, ironing board & iron, LCD T.V, gamecube games (installed in t.v) and sony alarm clock. The bathroom was a bit on the small side but everything you needed was there (hair dryer, spare towels, Neutrogena toiletries, decent shower). Didn't notice any noise from other rooms only the slight hum of a busy city outside, what I would expect from staying in a busy city on a main road. There was no sight of construction, certainly not on our floor or near the lobby. For the price we paid we couldn't ask for a better hotel in Manhattan, close to Bloomingdales, Central Park, Grand Central Station and the Rockafellar Centre all easily within a 15 minute walk. Will definilty go back there on our next trip

<Title>“surprised since all reviews are so bad”
<Content>Not sure where all the complaints come from. We stayed there 4 nights, Feb 10-14 one of our 4 our neighbors could be heard, but that's not the hotels fault, I do believe walls are a little thin though. Check in/out was a breeze, everyone was polite, bar does close at midnight which is alittle disappointing, forced us to go elsewhere at night. This is NYC, all rooms are relatively small and the remodel I think went as well as to be expected when you can't tear down & start again.

<Title>“A good sound place to stay.”
<Content>I stayed at the Metropolitan on Feb. 11th & 12th, 2005. Most of my feelings about the hotel are positive. The Metropolitan recently went through a $30M renovation, but quite frankly I couldn't see where that much money had been spent. The lobby while attractive, is rather plain and simple as were the other community rooms. The guest rooms were comfortable but not lavish. I think the wall paper in the rooms could have been redone as I noticed a tear in the paper in my bathroom. The staff, in my opinion was quite courteous and professional. On my way out in the evening, I stopped at the front desk to let the clerk know that the toilet in my bathroom was constantly running. While it wasn't annoying, I was mostly concerned about water conservation. The clerk said he would call someone right away to let them know. I had to return to my room about 20 minutes later to pick up something I had forgotten and the toilet was fixed! I guess the mixed feelings I have are because I stayed in this hotel back when it was the Lowes Summit and I suppose it's like comparing apples and oranges. The Summit was much more opulant with more ammenities like bed turndown and Godiva chocolates on your pillow and they had a very nice hotel restaurant. As the Doubletree Metropolitan, it's much more simple with fewer ammenities and there was no bed turndown and no chocolates. If you're looking for a good clean, safe and sound place to stay that is in an el primo location, then the Metropolitan is the place for you. If you're looking for something with more elegance and ambience, then you may want to consider staying some place else.

<Title>“Impressed from the moment we stepped out of the taxi....”
<Content>We've been to NYC many times, and we both agree the Doubletree Metropolitan was a very pleasant surprise! We stayed there from February 5th to the 8th. Our room was on the ninth floor, and was surprisingly quiet, even without double-glazed windows (which we were told are being installed). It makes us wonder how other reviewers could have had such apparently bad experiences........it appears that hotel managment has taken steps to address concerns, and has done a fine job correcting things. We got a super rate on the Doubletree website, and we got excellent value for the price. Our room was newly refurbished with very attractive furnishings, a very nicely fitted bathroom (with a great shower-head), and above all - it was a decent-sized room for a NYC hotel! We found all of the staff to be attentive, pleasant, and helpful - we were greeted at the front door by the duty manager, and looked after all the way from there. Like most (all) hotels, the prices for meals and drinks in the bar were on the high side, but if you can manage to walk the length of yourself, you can find wonderful options closeby (including a very nice deli right beside the hotel). The location of the hotel is super - close to everything you want to see, and right on a subway line and bus routes. This is truly a wonderful find from our perspective, and we've been in many hotels all over the world. Next time we visit New York City, it's the Doubletree Metropolitan for us!

<Title>“Nothing wrong about Metropolitan”
<Content>Do not understand all negative comments on this hotel. Stayed there 2 nights in january, 2005. Check in was good and quick, check out too. Room was comfortable and I slept like a baby in their comfortable bed!Bathroom clean and quite big. Was freezing outside so it was nice to use bathtub, it is though small but big enough to get your body warm...Good location too, subway just on the corner! Though, I would not say they invested so many millions in hotel renovation...But come on guys, who spends long times in hotels when you are in NYC??? Clean, great bed, nice shower, great location,great rates..It says enough! Just try yourself and do not be scared about negative comments...But if you search for something hip or luxury there is enough choice in NYC. I will be back!

<Title>“Decent room, good location”
<Content>We stayed at the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel over New Year 2005 for 6 nights. It was a nice hotel, room was clean and had a nice flat screen tv with lots of channels. Bed was comfy, and they gave you Neutrogena shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion everyday (I thought the lotion (moisturiser) was best). Nice hot, powerful shower above the bath, bath was very low and not really designed for lying back and soaking in, but nice all the same. The hotel is in a good location on Lexington Avenue, with the Chrysler building further down the Avenue. There are plenty of places to eat, which is just as well as the hotel restaurant is very pricey. Try the excellent Longwood Gourmet on Lexington, open 24 hours, it is chinese buffett style where you pay for your food by weight and can eat in or take out. We ate there most nights it was so yummy! Basic but fun. We tried to go down the stairs instead of using the lift, and we found that on the second or 3rd floor there was a lot of building work going on. Credit to the hotel is due, we were on the 6th floor, and if we hadn't have gone down the stairs we would never have known about the builders. We found the concierge guy was very helpful, although there is often a queue to see him as he is so good! He helped us book our helicopter flight and helped with the problem we were having phoning the UK. He also helped us get return transport to the airport. The check in was quick and fast, as was check out as we had no charges or anything. They give you free cookies when you check in! Recommended.

<Title>“Rooms good for NY, service is poor”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Metropolitan for four nights before Christmas 2004. We expected it to be busy and it was. We were slightly early arriving at the hotel and were unable to check in, reception advised us to return at 3pm. We left our cases with the porter (bellhop?) and went for some lunch. We returned at 3 as requested and were advised our room was not ready. We were asked to take a seat, a problem when there are no seats as several other parties were waiting for their rooms. After an hour of waiting we managed to get a room, however it was on a lower floor and I had paid my travel company extra for a deluxe room that should have been on a higher floor. Check in advised all the rooms were the same, no matter what floor so I had paid extra for nothing. Finally got our room on a higher floor an our hour and a quarter after we wanted to check in! The room was excellent by New York standards - a decent size, good tv and fab bed. Even the shower was pretty good - not a power shower but not a trickle that you get in some hotels. However, after we had been in our room for 15 minutes, another couple entered our room. I was in the bathroom and my wife was laying on the bed and to say we were a little shocked and concerned is an understatement! Our room had apparently been allocated to two lots of people - not sure how this happens but it is unpleasant. My wife contacted reception and was made to feel that this was her fault which is clearly unacceptable. We went out for our evening meal and were then unable to get back in our room - all in all a frustrating first day at the Metropolitan. We were given a complimentary breakfast in the hotel but this was distinctly average and would recommend you don't eat at the hotel. The hotel bar was nicely decorated but heavily over-priced. There was also a lot of work taking place on some floors at the hotel and although we couldn't hear anything from our room, the lift often stopped on floors where work was taking place. In summary, the room was very good and the location was good being away from the hustle and bustle but a 5 minute walk to Rockerfeller and 1 minute from the subway. It was just the service that let this place down. Would I stay here again - no. The next New York trip is booked for the summer and I am off to the Trump Tower - I hope the extra cost is worth it!

<Title>“one of the best VALUES right now in nyc”
<Content>This is not a bad place at all. If you are trying to have your dream vacation in nyc, this is not the place to stay as it is under construction right now. even with the renovation it is not an especially posh place. they've made an effort with t he new bar lounge downstairs, but it's still not the w. then again you can walk 1 block over to the w bar/lounge and save yourself 100 bucks a night. anyhow i like it and will stay again. it is clean and comfortable. the bathrooms are nicely redone in marble and there are plasma tvs with cable. i have no complaints about my stay. the carpet was very clean which is unlike many hotels in this price range $120-160 for the small rooms. also the rooms aren't closets. size wise they average 250-300 sq feet vs many hotels in the same price range that are going to be 180 max. this is one of the best VALUES right now in nyc.

<Content>We stayed in the Metropolitan Hotel from 3-7th January 2005. Our room was cosy, beds were huge and comfortable, clean and tidy. Did miss a bath though as the room only had a shower. Anyway the staff were polite and the concierge department were extremely helpful - providing us with maps, subway routes and pointed us to some of the best bars in NYC. We did experience some sirens at night and traffic noise but after having very tiring days walking around NYC we were just glad to get into our comfy beds and so it did not cause us any discomfort. Overall the hotel was fine and its great location made our 4 night break run very smoothly indeed. 3*. Steph, Amy and Becky!

<Title>“Metropolitan - Never Again!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the hotel on Jan 9-11 at a great "pre-opening" Doubletree rate. You get what you pay for! Front entrance was covered with plywood. Entire lobby was under construction and under constant chaos. After three tries, finally were given an acceptable room on a floor with clean carpet. Room was nice, but facing a police station...and we heard sirens, outrageous street noise, and lots of corridor noise all night. Beds are wonderful, but it is impossible to sleep with all the noise. Complaining did nothing but result in empty management promises. We're in NYC almost every month and will NEVER stay here again.

The staff was very friendly... The hotel is at an amazing location! It's in walking distance to TimeSquare, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Broadway theatres and much more... The staff was very friendly and answered any questions that we had. The concierge was really good! When it was raining and we needed a taxi to get to Broadway they went out of their way to get a cab for us, even almost getting hit...lol Everytime I go to NYC I probably will stay at the DoubleTree/Metropolitan...I just hope I get it at the same price I got it for in December ;)

<Content>Stayed in the Metropolitan Doubletree from 23rd to 27th of December and had no problems with it at all. Our check in took a little bit longer than normal due to a small problem so the receptionist upgraded us to a kingsize bed for no charge. loved the cookie on arrival!!!! This hotel is in an excellent location. It is beside a police precinct but we heard no noise from it, however, NY seemed a little bit quieter than normal, maybe because it was Christmas time. Any staff we dealt with were friendly and courtous, the concierge booked a bus tour for us. However, as we were leaving on the Monday morning, construction could be heard from the lower 3 floors but this is sure to be finished soon. There is no construction to be seen in the public areas. All in all a great hotel!!!!

<Title>“Not worth it!”
<Content>The Metropolitan Hotel's idea of "renovation" isn't quite on the mark. Firstly, I don't know that I've ever been to a hotel that advertises parking, but does not have valet. After we self parked in a lot around the corner, we had to juggle all of our personal items and luggage to around the block to the hotel. The front desk was consistently understaffed the entire weekend, but not particularly unfriendly. Upon arriving in our room, we found that they had given us a double room instead of the king we had requested. Furthermore, the room smelled of body odor. We were moved promptly and settled into our "renovated" king room. Now let me just add, wallpapering old, water damaged and unsightly walls doesn't change the fact that they are still old, water damaged and unsightly. Similarly, putting "modern looking" furniture in a small space doesn't make it appealing. In addition, the rooms have absolutely no soundproofing and the housekeeping staff apparently felt the need to vaccum starting at 9am on Sunday morning for at least an hour, I also heard every person that walked by the room. While the room did have a safe, there was no second lock on the hotel room door and I definitely would not have felt comfortable there had I not been with my fiance. Lastly, the construction entrance feel to the hotel is definitely not charming or attractive. While the hotel location is prime, there are about 10 other hotels in a 2 block radius I would stay at before ever staying at the Metropolitan Hotel again.

<Title>“The staff from Hell (with the exception of one lovely blonde)”
<Content>My mother and I stayed one night in September after I found out that my house had been seriously damaged in Florida's last hurricane. We had been at the Omni but thought that we couldn't afford its rates due to our stay being extended. We felt that we should look for a cheaper place because there was no point in getting home before roads were accessible, etc. The rooms that we were shown when we walked over to the Metropolitan were not the rooms that we got. I literally had to argue and beg to a front desk clerk who had the personality of Lurch; basically, I cried to get a better room (the same one, by the way, that we had been shown when we first decided to take a room there). We checked out the next day and decided that it didn't matter what we had to pay: we wouldn't stay there another minute. You definitely get what you pay for. Oh, the custodial and maintenance staff were beyond nice...they just didn't have much to work with. Yeah, we had to ask the maintenance man to turn on the air because it didn't come on unless one had a pair of pliers.

<Title>“Good Hotel!”
<Content>Just returned from the Metro DoubleTree and was very happy with our stay. First, I'll give my negatives-our bed was very small (double) and uncomfortable for myself, however I am a very picky mattress person so take my opinion as you will. The hotel was very loud at night with people coming home from the bar at 4am and slamming doors but that is nothing they can control. Also, maid service would knock on our door as early as 9:30am, so make sure you put the "do not disturb" sign out if you want to sleep in. Now, the pros-the hotel was in a great location, friendly staff, good bar, internet access (for a fee), and a nail salon right downstairs. Would stay there again if I can get the same price on Priceline.

<Content>Stayed at the Metropolitan from 24th December 04 to 28th December 04. Room was perfect - Clean, Warm, really comfy bed, good shower and a plasma TV. No idea why this hotel gets so much negativity, when you're in NY a hotel is for getting your head down at night and thats it! Can't vouch for the food, room service and the restaurant was very expensive judging by the menu's, take a left out the hotel and walk for 5 mins to the deli on the corner and eat proper NY food for next to nothing. The bar was completed and up and running, looked expensive and was trying hard to be trendy, didn't use it myself. Maid service was excellent and they were friendly and pleasant enough, didn't really have much dealing with other staff. 20 mins walk from 5th Avenue and 20 mins the other way is central park. Very enjoyable Christmas break, would definitely use this hotel again (its now known as the DoubleTree Hotel as part of the hilton group to avoid confusion!) If you want a comfy place to stay and a location to see the best of NY then stay here.

<Title>“Loved the Metropolitan”
<Content>Two friends and I stayed in a suite for a weekend in Oct 04 before heading to CT and liked it so much we stayed again the following weekend before flying out. The bell staff was terrific, helping load/unload bags, stopping traffic so our car could get right in front of the hotel. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms are very nice, modern ala Stark, with great linens and a super shower. There was construction going on in the lobby but that was not an issue.

<Content>Walk to Rockefeller, Radio City, Cathedral. Subway (6 train) right there. Former NY resident so I can tell you this was a great stay. Doubletree bought it on the 17th. I was there 20-23rd, lucky me cause I got a great deal on it (about $10 more than my friend paid for a room that had the bathroom down the hall) I had a plasma TV in the room, brand new bathroom, big clean comfortable bed and a chocolate chip cookie on my arrival (yummy). I was very HAPPY.

<Title>“A Great Stay”
<Content>We stayed in the Doubletree Metropolitan Hotel the weekend of Dec 18-December 21. Our room was clean and the staff was friendly except for one employee when we tried to check in early. The hotel is in walking distance to all sights or transportation is nearby. We truly enjoyed our stay, and we loved the chocolate chip cookie on the first night.

<Content>My wife and I stayed 5 nights and would do it again. The location is great, subway, bistros,deli and bus stops. Good "homebase" to walk to Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's etc. The rooms are clean, no frills, comfortable, smallish but adequate. There was steady limited construction going on on the premises but tolerable. We didn't "hole up" in our room all day. THe housekeeping staff did a great job and were very friendly as was the concierge (booked a tour bus & broadway show, "Wonderful Town" w/ Brooke Shields, it was great) other employees were happy to help in any capacity.

<Title>“Not up to web Site”
<Content>Period of stay 4 - 7th November 2004. Having read the review of the hotel my wife and I were a little apprehensive. However, we were assured by the hotels web site that all refurbisment would be completed by the autumn. What a pity the hotel doesn't read its own publicity. The bar was still under construction. Our room had the new TV etc but also a plug in heater because the radiator did not work. This restricted the space a little. The windows were dirty although they could be opened to look at the traffic etc below. The warddrobe was very small and very old fashioned. When having a shower the water half filled the bath and took about 20 minutes to go down the plug. On the plus side the staff were extremeley helpful, including the bell hop. Howevevr, on the day we were checking out Reception did not know it was the day of the NYC Marathon, depite there being a team of Italian runners staying the hotel. Don't bother with the breakfast - to dear. Instead go to the NY Luncheon Diner on E49th Street. Excellent service and they refused a tip.

<Title>“Would stay here again”
<Content>I was very pleased with the standard of this hotel. The rooms were modern, clean and warm. There were three of us in one room and we had plenty of room. I would deffinately recomend this hotel to friends as I thought the location was great, just three blocks from 5th Ave and Bloomingdales just down the road. It had a sub way station on one corner and a deli on the other. Although I did not have many dealings with the staff on the odd occassion I did need them I found them all to be very pleasant. I don't know why this hotels has so many bad reviews some people must be really hard too please after all when your in the big apple your only in your room to SLEEP.

<Title>“Poor excuse for a hotel”
<Content>My daughter and I stayed at the Metropolitan Hotel last December for 4 nights. There was no heat on 2 separate occasions, one of which was all night on a cold December night. They proceeded to finally give us a space heater which was placed on a table by the curtains, an obvious fire hazard. Using the space heater caused the breaker to blow while my daughter was in the shower, a very scary experience for her being in pitch darkness. The hotel was nice years ago when it was Loews, but as even the bellman told us they have allowed it to go downhill because they were not willing to spend the money for updating. It was a terrible experience and after complaining to 3 managers, their response was 10% off on our next stay to make up for the problems we experienced. Needless to say that discount will never be used as I would never consider staying there again.

<Content>We decided on this hotel as it has considerably better reviews than some. The location was very handy for the subway and there was a nice deli for coffee etc in the morning just down the road, especially as the hotel only had an expensive restaurant for a sit down breakfast ! The hotel has had $35,000,000 spent on its renovation. What a shame that it didnt stretch to quilt covers, pictures, or remotely freindly staff. Do not expect your luggage to be taken to your room by the bell boy but if he wheels it 3mtrs do expect to give a tip (conversation and smiling not included) It did the job but would look elsewhere in the future, New York was fantastic !

<Content>Like a few of the others, I was very apprehensive of this hotel after reading some of the reviews below, but for the money this was a nice hotel. The room was clean, and although not too big, had enough space for everything. The bed was comfortable and the shower worked great, which for me are the most important things. It's a bit noisy, but this is New York. And the location was great, walking distance to many nice restaurants and tourist spots, and right on the subway.

<Content>In reality the Metropolitan, especially for someone who has be be E. Midtown is a perfect location. Yes it is under renovation, and is in a state of flux. I have been there 3 times in the last month on business, and I am a diehard Marriott client, but am pleased with the rates and ease of use of the Metropolitan. If you are expecting Hyatt Regency service, dont waste your time, but feel free to waste your dollars at another hotel. Bang for the buck a great place.

<Title>“Pleasantly Surprised!”
<Content>After reading the mostly negative reviews of this hotel, I was very apprehensive to say the least. However, it was the only pet-friendly hotel in the City in the location I wanted within my desired pricepoint. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. The room was extremely spacious and the king bed was very comfortable. The bathroom area was nice because the shower and toilet were separated from the sink area which makes it easier for everyone to get ready. My only qualm about the room was that the thermostat did not work. Of course, I stayed there over the Thanksgiving weekend and did not require A/C but the room did have a tendency to become quite stuffy--at night especially. The service was fine and the location was fantastic. All in all, this was a pleasant stay with all the things you would normally expect from a 3-star hotel being just as they should.

<Title>“Problems with staff attitude”
<Content>This was my third trip to Manhattan, but first time to stay at this hotel. I was able to check-in early, but that was the most positive experience I had the whole weekend. They are also a block from one of the subway stations that appears to be available 24-7 (some stops are closed on Sundays). Had requested 2 double beds at reservation, but only got 1 king (told doubles had been sold out that weekend). Room and bathroom were cramped, but appeared to have mostly new, modern appliances and furniture. Could never figure out the alarm clock. The staff at most times were rude. The concierges seem to be most concerned with selling you something related to their "contacts" (I was told to stay away from the 1/2 price tickets line which I have done each trip - better to buy full price tickets through them). Lobby bar apparently closes by 11:30pm on Saturday night. We stopped in for one drink after a show and was told they already had last call. They still agreed to serve us, but were not interested in providing us with water, or napkins to clean the mess they made in delivering the drinks. The drain in the tub was not working well, and someone had taken the stopper out. When we asked at the front desk to have it repaired, all they did was replace the stopper - nothing changed with the drainage. The morning of our check-out, housekeeping tried to walk in on us to clean. We told her we wouldn't be ready until checkout time. When we had our luggage out around 10am and passed her, she asked if we were checking out then, and why had we told her not until noon. As far as I'm concerned, housekeeping shouldn't be knocking on my door 3 hours before check-out. As long as we are out by then, it shouldn't matter. The front desk did not want to cash a check for me. At this point, we spoke to a manager - he agreed to cashing a check, as long as I had an AMEX number for them. Hopefully, when it becomes part of the Hilton family, they will have much better staff!

<Content>I ve spent 8 nights in the hotel in Nov 2004. With the price paid through Hotels, I was expecting a liitlle bit better than what I saw considering the season of my visit. In any European Hotel with a price above 300$ per night you would be a KING!!!!. Nice placement downtown, quiet and clean room ,satisfactory morning buffet, above subway station. Rennovation takes place in the lower floors without annoying the others . The staff was not the frendliest ever, needs customer orientation. If what you pay is what you get ,don´t expect to fool them .

<Title>“Fine, but no frills”
<Content>This hotel was clean, convenient, and the staff was couteous. Best of all, it was a nice price for a midtown NYC hotel. The hotel is undergiong renovations, but we were not affected by this at all. The restaurant, gift shoip, elevator and all common areas, and our entire floor was completed. However, this hotel is "no frills" -- not sure why it has such a high star rating. There is a flat screen plasma tv in the room and nice duvets. But there are very few toiletries (pack well!), there in no in-room refirgerator, and there is not even a coffee maker. Service was fine, but the staff wasn't just falling over trying to help us out. Sometimes we had to call several times to get what we needed (like, a crib for the baby, which we'd requested at booking). Also had to call several times to have hot water brought up to room for sterilizing baby bottles (had planned to use coffee maker...). Staff made it very obvious that they expected to be tipped. I would've tipped them anyway (and did!), but I didn't really like that attitude. Concierge was available but all of them were incredibly young and had somewhat limited knowledge of the surrounding area. Overall, the hotel was fine for what we paid, but next time I will spend a few bucks more for a higher quality hotel in the same location.

<Title>“Great Stay”
<Content>The Metropolitan Hotel is a great place to stay. The location is fabulous, and the rooms are clean – what else do you really need? The staff was very friendly during check in and even upgraded us to a different room free of charge. The bar and restaurant were both open and there were only a few renovations being done to the back of the hotel. The concierge was very friendly, but was not at all helpful or knowledgeable about late night dining/drinks. The concierge’s desk closes at an early 9:00pm and the attendant did not want to stay a minute over the scheduled time. I am sure the concierge would have been more helpful in the “working hours.” Overall, the Metropolitan is a great place to stay and I highly recommend that no one pays any attention to all the negative reviews posted on this web site and checks it out for themselves. I would defiantly stay at the Metropolitan Hotel again.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel, would recommend it.”
<Content>Stayed here with my mum on Nov 4th to Nov 8th. After reading these reviews we were dreading it and even tried to get hotel changed but couldn't. Now we are glad we didnt. Hotel was excellent. We got a renovated room which was spotless. It had two doublebeds , a plasma screen tv, hairdryer, ironing board and iron and a beautiful bathroom. We had nothing to worry about. The staff were all very friendly we didnt find any of them rude. The bell hops were especially good. There is also an ice machine and drinks machine on each floor which is good. Renovations still going on but look to be nearly finished and they didnt affect our trip at all. We discovered on first day our shower didnt work, after reporting it, within 5 minutes someone was up and put on a brand new shower head. I would give this hotel 5 stars and we cant understand why it got so many bad reviews so if you are planning a stay there dont be worrying like we did because it really is a beautiful, clean hotel in an excellent location.

<Title>“Pleasantly relieved”
<Content>I have to admit I was worried. My wife and I were accompanying my daughter and grandaughter on a business trip to NYC. Her company had booked her into the Metropolitan for five nights and I had read the reviews posted here. When we arrived the staff was very helpful. Granted, the renovations still continue, but what is finished is very nice. The health club is still not done, nor is the bar, and only one restaurant is done, but this is New York City. You only have to walk a few steps to bars, restaurants, etc. We were in an upgraded room on the tenth floor. It was very nice. The duvet covers are white, so you know they are clean. The room was extremely clean and comfortable. Maid service was daily and all linens were replaced every day. I can't say for sure that they change the duvets every day, but twice our grandaughter got a small spot on the duvet and in each case it was replaced the next day. The television was a flat panel, very nice, with 60 or 70 channels. The bathroom was very nice with an "optimizer" shower curtain, slate floors and walls in the shower, etc. Watch the water in the sink. If you turn it on too high it tends to splash out. As for noise versus view, if noise is a major concern ask for a room on the "back side" of the hotel. If view is, ask for a room on the front. There will always be noise in NYC, and the easternmost part of the motel is across the street from a police and fire department. Keep both windows closed to minimize noise. I don't understand the comments about holes in the windows. Each window has both an inner and an outer window. The inner opens, but the outer one didn't. I would assume this is a safety concern. Room service is expensive. Make sure you check the rates before ordering. One of my daughter's coworkers didn't, and ended up with a $30 breakfast. It was interesting watching the progress on the bar while we were there, (10/23 - 10/28/2004), and it looked like it would soon be done. Feel comfortable about going to the Metropolitan. It's nice, clean, fresh and friendly.

<Title>“Bad service!”
<Content>This hotel is not worth the money you will spend per night. We spent $250+ the first night and $300+ the next night, and for a grand total of $600, we got a bathroom door that didn't shut, no refrigerator and VERY rude staff. When we asked for a room change as the bathroom would not shut, they told us that they could not change it because it was already paid for. When we requested a room change (again) the next day, they told us to go upstairs and pack as they only do room changes between 3 and 5 pm. When we got back at 8 pm, they told us we did NOT pack (when we obviously did) so they could not change our room. After a lot of rudeness, we were finally given a new room. I would not stay here again just because of the extremely bad service!!! I've stayed at hotels that aren't as nice but had better service and i've always gone back. This hotel is a different story!!!

<Content>Stayed for 4 nights on business. I had requested a non-smoking room and was only given the option of a smoking room for the first night. This room was dull, dreary and......smelt of smoke. Upon being given a non-smoking room, there was a noticable difference in room scent and size (this one being larger) but all in all I would not stay there again. Location wise, you are near to most things but you will find better hotels elsewhere. Service was below average.

<Title>“YUCK”
<Content>If you like the smell of a sweaty, stinky gym locker room then stay here. I had what they call a "renovated room" and it was horrible. The room smelled like a sweaty dirty gym locker room. My non-smoking room reeked of cigarettes. They advertise "goose down comforters" on their website when in reality it is more like a piece of cardboard with two sheets around it. My sheets had hair on them and hair on my towels too. The lock didn't work on my door so I had to pry a chair up against it so no one could get in. The window had a whole in it and a freezing breeze was coming in. The hotel would not give us heat since the said they legally don't have to until November. I think they are wrong about that. I finally had to shove a towel in the whole so I wouldn't freeze. The wall paper was just thrown over top of crooked, bumpy un-sanded walls and looked terrible. They painted the door ways so poorly they were chipping and showing the old pink color through. My window had a bumper stick on it. Priceline sells this hotel cheap a lot so unfortunately the clientele there were rather low class. They were partying and drinking in the hallways all hours of the night and the hotel did nothing about it. Between them waking me up, the fire sirens going off all night, then the loud remodeling starting at 7 in the morning I got no sleep or rest for my meeting I had at all. Do not be fooled by the pictures on their website!!

<Title>“I Wouldn't stay there for free!”
<Content>I stayed at the Metropolitan with my partner in March for 5 nights. We were extremely disapointed and disgusted. The rooms were dirty, especially the bathrooms, where there were hairs in the bath (and It didnt look like the kind you find on peoples head!) The bath was clogged up so when you had a shower you were knee deep in dirty cloudy water and there was mildew all over the tiles. The whole time there were plumbing problems where the toilet only flushed when it felt like it, and one morning it flooded the entire hotel room. The manager reluctantly agreed to give us another room and we wasted hours packing our stuff and moving mid stay. Our new room was smaller, dark, smelled stale and had a brick wall for a view. The manager was unsympathetic, implying the flooding problems were down to us and in the new room we amazingly continued having similar plumbing problems, with strange noises coming from the toilet?!? The temperature of the room was either boiling or freezing and like the toilet problems we had to call the engineer up many many times. On the whole, it spoiled our stay and disrupted our enjoyment of an excellent city. We will never stay at the metropolitan hotel again. Its an absolute disgrace, and should be closed down until these serious issues are sorted out and they can provide the quality they display and promise on their website. I would expect this from a 1 star B&B in Skegness, but a 3/4 star hotel in one of the greatest cities in the world.....Its a joke.

<Title>“What a dump! Just one word: hair”
<Content>I wish I'd had the time to read reviews of this hotel, but I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. I work in mid-town Manhattan and couldn't get home the night a fire shut down train service in and out of Penn Station. For the price I paid ($149) I could at least have gotten a room that was clean; hair in the bathroom, hair in the sheets, ugh ugh ugh. Since it was already late and I was exhausted from having to deal with commute problems, I tidied up the room myself. When I checked in I was a little nervous because I saw the front desk clerks had fans to cool down; so I was glad when the air conditioning worked, although only too well! It was freezing and there was no way to turn off the air! I ended up putting pillows on the vent to inhibit air flow. Needless to say, this was not a renovated room! When I checked out, I asked the clerk, "Aren't you going to ask how my stay was?" I thought he was going to burst into tears; I am sure he is demoralized by all the complaints. I am grateful I had a roof over my head that night since I could have been sitting in the train station all those hours, but I'm not sure which was worse.

<Title>“Big Disappointment!!”
<Content>I stayed at the Metropolitan for a week in January, 2004. They were undergoing renovations at the time, but you wouldn't have known that from their website when I booked the reservation. The only 2 amenities that were advertised & which were the biggest draw for me were the gym & the restaurant/bar. What major disappointments! The restaurant was closed for the renovation (again no warning!)The gym ceiling was leaking & the carpets were soaked & mildewy. The stench was unbearable. The windows were open (in 0 degree weather) in an (unsuccessful) attempt to reduce the stench. It was a health hazard.The carpets in the hotel & room were also filthy & smelly. The gen. manager did not return any of my 8 calls to complain. He and the rest of the staff were unaccomodating & unfriendly. Worst New York hotel experience! I will never stay there again. Stay away at all costs!

<Content>Our stay was from Sept. 3-4, 2004. The hotel public areas are completely torn up. The ceiling is completely open, with wiring visible. Holes in other public places are covered by black curtains. There is no lobby. The only place to eat is a small corner of a conference room where they serve a continental breakfast. Rooms are okay, but lack a hair dryer and coffee pot. Staff is completely indifferent to guest complaints about the renovation, suggesting that people complain to the online services where they made their reservations. Management put a copy of a Jan 2004 letter in the elevators that tells guests that public area renovation will be complete by July, 2004.

<Title>“A disgraceful hotel, filthy. Terrrible management.”
<Content>My husband and I were booked into the Metropolitan Hotel in June 2004 for what we hoped was a lovely NY weekend. We entered the lobby to the sound of jackhammers and to find it completely stripped of all furniture. We also noticed signs all over that due to construction there were NO restaurants or bars open. After a terrible begining things got worse. Our room was a dirty, tacky mess, torn bedspread, musty smelling with peeling wallpaper. I immediately went down to the manager to insist that this hotel was unacceptable and demand a full refund. I politely stated that he had an obligation to inform guests of extensive noisy construction work and a comeplete lack of srevices. He was rude, unsympathetic and refused to give me a refund...he told me it was and "unrefundalbe" rate. My husband and I checked out and went to another hotel. I repeatedly wrote this hotel to get a refund with no satisfaction. Not only did we lose our entire nights stay, but has to incur an additional hotel bill for the same night! This hotel is apparently being taken over by Hilton. I sincerely hope they do some serious upgrading in facilties and custoerm service...which was atrocious. I wouldnt stay her at any price!!!

<Title>“Awful hotel”
<Content>Ok, I booked this hotel because it was not too expensive, even though a lot more expensive than other US towns i visited during my recent holidays. They are in the middle of a renovation, which I can understand. However, it is not acceptable to enter a lobby, if so we may call it, and have the impression to be in the train station. Everything was dirty, the works were not even covered with a screen and the staff were really depressed, which I can fully understand. At that point I would have gone away, ready to spend a lot more in another hotel, but at the end of the day I only had to stay there for one night, so we decided to stay. The only thing which was cheering us up during check in was that we had reserved a refurbished room, so we were expecting at least something decent and clean. Instead, even though our room was on the 17th floor and was indeed new, it was really horrible. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen, even worse than in a motel. We were lucky because we are thin, but I wonder what an average American would do there if when you open the door it almost touches the toilet. The ONLY positive aspect of this hotel was the plasma TV screen, which seemed even out of place in a room like that. I cannot imagine what a non renovated room is like, and honestly I don't want to know. Our only desire was to leave as soon as possible. In a few words: avoid this hotel, believe me!!

<Title>“Nice room - Right in the middle of a remodel”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel August 26-27, 2004. I booked a remodeled room and it was in nice shape. Minimalist style, comfortable beds, nice flat screen TV. But, this hotel needs some work. They are in the middle of a remodel so they can become part of the DoubleTree chain. The A/C in my room was great, but the thermostat didn't work. The windows/doors/walls are not soundproof and with a police and fire station down the street it makes for a loud night. For the price and location I would stay at this hotel again.

<Content>I stayed at this hotel for a business meeting in NYC. The location is excellent and the staff was friendly but other than that, its one of the worst places you can live in. The carpets were so worn out and dirty that it felt i was in some rowhouse. The hotel had woefully inadequate electric outlets and i was forced to unplug the lights to use my laptop. Overall, avoid this place like the plague.

<Content>Awful. The rooms are being renovated, albeit not well. I reserved a king, non-smoking, renovated room with high-speed Internet. I got a 2-bed, really smokey, beat-up room with broken Internet. When I called the front desk, the new guy on duty told me they were suddenly out of non-smoking rooms even without Internet. (They had some when I first checked in at 11:30 at night, a mere 20 minutes before.) And they are under construction for the next several months. On my way out the door at 8:15 AM I passed a woman in pajamas, who was yelling at the management due to the hammering in the next room. At 8:15 AM. Find somewhere else to stay.

<Title>“Great Location, Dingy Rooms”
<Content>We visited the Metropolitan hotel in December 2003. We had never been to NYC before and decided to take a Christmas / New Year shopping trip. We found the Metropolitan to be conveniently located for all the shops and "touristy areas". It's perfect for Bloomingdale's / Central Park / Bars / Grand Central Station etc The one down side was the actual room itself. We asked for a smoking room (but didn't realise the room actually appeared to smoke itself). The walls were a dull brown and the smell was horrible. The rooms are fairly small - as you expect in a large city, but the bathroom was horrible. When we were there in Dec 03, there were notices going up all over the place talking of a big refurbishment, so i would consider going back there due to the brilliant location, especially if the rooms are re-done.

<Title>“Awful!”
<Content>This hotel was perhaps the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I was in NY for business in the beginning of July. I booked the hotel knowing it was a budget property, but it was hardly that. Upon check in I was put in a non renovated smoking room (I had requested non). It smelled awful, I couldn't unpack, and it was filthy. I went to the lobby and was met rudely by the woman at the desk, who informed me that despite reserving a non smoking room, I would have to live with a smoking room for the night. I did not unpack a thing, and slept on top of the sheets. The only saving grace was that I was given a renovated non smoking room the next night. DO NOT STAY THERE

<Title>“Avoid at all costs”
<Content>I checked into this hotel on July 17th. What a dump!! Only part of the hotel is renovated. We booked (2) doubles and non-smoking. Upon arrival, the front desk clerk told us that double, non-smoking was an extra charge but he would accomodate us (ha ha). We were sent to an unrenovated room which had not been cleaned. The beds were made but the bathroom had used soap and someone else's shampoo and conditioner. We asked to be moved and were sent to a renovated room. Not much better. No soap or hand towels. The hallways smelled stale and old. The following day we were moved to another renovated room with double beds. Again, no hand towels, the room did not lock and the bathroom door would not close as it was at least 1/2" too big for the jam. Hotels rated it a 3 1/2 stars. It's more like a 1 star.

<Title>“Thought it was GREAT!!!”
<Content>I thought this hotel was wonderful for NYC. I had nothing to complain about at all! The rooms were very clean and so were the bathrooms. They were not the largest, but it's NYC and space is hard to come by there. For the price I couldn't have asked for anything more. I had a fairly nice view of the city and the maid service was excellent. If you are sight-seeing or on business it is perfect, but don't expect the Plaza. It is located in a perfect part of the city, very close to everything and not as noisy as being in the heart of Time Square. I would suggest this to others in a new york minute!

<Content>This hotel left a lot to be desired. I did not receive a renovated room and was appalled to find extremely stained carpeting and filthy bedding with hair! The woman at the front desk barely looked at me when I checked in. There was no clock of any kind in the room and when I requested a phone book it took them almost an hour to deliver it. As others have mentioned the renovations are not complete and there is no restaurant on site. The location is great and perhaps once the renovation is done this will be a desireable hotel. Until then, stay clear.

<Content>I was extremely satisfied with my stay at the Metropolitan Hotel. It was the first time I had stayed in a hotel in Manhattan. The location was excellent. The desk people were courteous. The room was spotless. The renovation is impressive. If you like a new modern looking room in Manhattan, this is the place for you. My only two complaints are that my bathroom didn't have a ventilation and the "continental" breakfast was $11 a person. But, there's a coffee shop right next door on Lexington. Overall, great place to stay. It's about $22 by taxi from Lauardia. Book early and take advantage of this gem.

<Title>“Metropolitan Hotel/Excellent value & location”
<Content>Just returned from a July 4th getaway to NYC. This is the 2nd stay for us at the Metropolitan in the past 2 years. The construction/renovation is still underway, but disruption is minimal. The bar/grill in the lobby is still closed (and walled off) due to construction, but our rooms were refurbished and exceptionally clean and comfortable. The staff was helpful & friendly, as well. We love staying at the "Met" due to the fantastic location and reasonable rates. We'll definately return and look forward to the re-opening of the lobby bar & grill. We learned a bit of history on the Metropolitan this trip. The builder in the 1960's was from Miami, FL. The building is designed in a curve, supposedly to represent a ocean "wave" and bring a bit of South Beach to Manhattan.

<Title>“Does not deserve 3.5 stars”
<Content>I don't have any horror stories- but the main thing I appreciated about this hotel is that it is right next to the 51st street subway stop. The room (the deluxe for 2 people) was tiny. the bathroom was even tinier with the sink jutting into the shower. The toiletries were meager (shampoo, conditioner and a tiny bar of soap) and of indeterminate brand. There were not even enough towels. I would rank this maybe as a 2 star - and I have stayed at better 2 star hotels. The room was so small that the TV cabinet was placed in the corridor so that one could not even watch TV from the bed. Before this hotel I stayed at the Mayfair, which expedia ranks as 2.5 stars. The room was huuuge as was the bathroom, and the toiletries were of good quality.

<Title>“Cheap, but not very cheerful”
<Content>I stayed at the Metropolitan in May 2004 for three nights, booked through Expedia on a 25% discount rate, which worked out at about £80 per night. On the plus side it is very well located and fairly cheap for Manhattan. On the downside it is very basic and is in serious need of major refurbishment - signs in the lifts say this is happening, but we did not see much evidence..... Some of the criticisms here are about the staff - we actually found them helpful. We had a problem with our a/c (room too cold), but the hotel were v.quick to send a maintenance man up to deal with it.

<Title>“Basic Hotel at Reasonable Rate Let Down by Crap Staff”
<Content>We got off to a very bad start here as we'd booked our rooms through an Internet company that went bust and the hotel claimed no record of our booking. This, DESPITE the fact that I had called to confirm directly with the hotel on two previous occasions. The front desk told me a mistake had been made because there was another guest staying in the hotel that night with the same name and from the same town, city and country. Sure. What aggravated me most was the fact that the hotel staff appeared to take such pleasure from our predicament, gleefully explaining that every other hotel was booked up in the city that night. (Assuming that was the case, it doesn't say much for the Metropolitan that they were the ONLY hotel with vacancies in Manhattan). Under duress, we booked in and so, effectively, ended up paying twice for our hotel room. I appreciate that it's not the Metropolitan's fault if a booking company goes bust but I resented having to hear the hotel manager's fairy story about my 'doppelganger' guest and the staff's general demeanour. The rooms were not tiny and appeared to be clean and the midtown location is pretty good. Decor is outdated and the rooms are very dark but for €130 per night, it doesn't represent bad value for NYC - assuming you pay the rate just once. New York, New York. So good they charge you twice...

<Content>Okay, where to start....! 5 women arriving late at night on 5/17, lugged our suitcases into hotel to find no bellman. Loaded them by ourselves onto rack prepared to take them up ourselves. Checked in and staff was unfriendly, perhaps too late at night for them? Headed up to our rooms and a man dressed in a black sweatshirt approached us and offered to take our suitcases to our room, we refused thinking he was someone trying to get money? Later found out it was the bellhop! (Not dressed in any hotel identifying clothing) Got to our rooms, BAD ! Old , disgusting and scary! Would not walk on carpet without socks, showered with flipflops on! Lucky we did not stay in rooms too long each day, too much of Fab NY to see! Great location , subway to your right as you walk out of hotel, always cabs around to grab if needed. After reading reviews previous to stay, knew not to expect too much! Stayed til 5/20(locked in by Priceline) checked out (front desk still very unfriendly)went to another hotel near Times Square. Would recommend if you can deal with getting a crappy room, unfriendly staff, and constant construction noise in morning! A plus was no sign of BEDBUGS! Yay!

<Title>“hotel nightmare”
<Content>This was truly the worst hotel experience I have ever had. I was booked in to the hotel on a business trip with a colleague. the nightly rate being charged was about $300. The night we arrived there were no flights out of NY due to weather only flights in. We arrived 10 pm at the hotel to find no rooms had been allocated to us for that day although we were on their list to arrive they had made a mistake. However they offered us lower standard rooms to be moved the following day. My colleague, a non smoker, was given a very smelly smoking room. She was lucky. The first room I was shown in had been used. I had just realised this and was on the phone to my colleague when a porter barged into the room without knocking. Strange!!??Another room was allocated. The room was next to the lift shaft (as was the other used room). This is a big hotel and the lift was in constant use throughout the night which basically meant it was impossible to sleep. I wnt downstaires to complain. The night porter looked very sympathetic - the room was basically not lettable - however the manageress to whom we later complained wouldn't give a reduction on the room rates. As it was in the run up to Xmas we unfortunately were unavble to find alternative accommodation as everywhere was booked (I only just found this website to warn other travellors now). Having initially settled into our rooms we wanted something to eat or at least a coffee. The hotel couldn't provide either of these and suggected we wnt to the all night deli round the corner!! (as 2 females in NY for the first time we were reticent to do this in the middle of the night). There are no facilities in the rooms and no room service. The bar (not serving coffee) was in the entrance foyer , was very noisy, smoky but I think had stopped serving although it was still crowded with the bar (or should I say entrance foyer?) TV on full blast. The rooms were dirty and had wall hung blow heaters from many years ago which you could put on if you like, a bizarre breakfast was served in the morning to premium rate guests in a strange room without proper seating at the top of hotel a meagre affair of melon and a danish pastry but get there quick cos it runs out. Staff were rude. My colleague discovered a used condom in her room when we were finally were allocated rooms on the second night of our stay. The decoration was I think from the 1940's it looked awful. The bathrooms had bugs in them.

<Title>“Not entirely what I was expecting”
<Content>My husband and I booked this hotel from Expedia when traveling to see a wedding (5.26-6.2). We viewed many nice pictures of the hotel and their rooms, but unfortunately, many of these reviews have legitimate complaints. To the hotel's credit, they are in the middle of a renovation, however, they do neglect the rooms that have not been renovated yet. The carpet was the worst. I wouldn't walk on it in my bare feet for our entire trip (7 nights). The bathroom grout was terribly stained by grout, but the bathroom smelled of cleaner, so I think at one point the mildew was out of control, and they never got rid of the stains. We had the superior room. I expected it to be larger than a typical kleenex box, but that was not the case. Between the desk, two chairs, bed, and nightstand, two people can not manuever around the room comfortably. We did not have control of the temperature in our room, which was extremely frustrating, as we like to have the room cold before going to bed. The thermostat either didn't work, or we had no control. The AC would randomly click on/off. This place IS located right by a fire/police department so EXPECT to hear sirens at least once a night. They do have double paned windows, but road noise is still very audible. In addition, the renovation construction noise begins around 7:00-8:00 am EVERY morning. On the upside: the linens were always clean, the staff was always attentive and helpful. Their concierge was outgoing and friendly, which was great. Whenever we needed something, the staff was quick to respond. Our room was always cleaned when we left our room, regardless if we were gone for a few hours or all day, which was a nice surprise. You do not get what you pay for here, but then again, you don't ever get that in NYC! Advice for future travelers: Pay the extra amount and get a renovated room, or go somewhere else!!!

When the TV and network didn't work in the 1st room, and I was knee deep in water in the tub during my shower, and I noticed that I could see the concrete under the threadbare carpet, I asked to be moved. A doorman came to move my things, but was sharp with me for not having all my stuff packed yet. Odd, since nobody had yet told me that I *would* be moved. Got to the new room, sat down at the desk and it FELL OVER ONTO ME. No kidding. Had to wedge stuff under one corner to keep it up.

<Content>I have no proof but I KNOW I put 150$ in the side pocket of my suitcase it was gone when I went to retrieve it. When I spoke with staff they did not seem the slightest bit shocked or concerned with what I was telling them. I went with my parents they did not take it. TO make a REALLY long story short. It literally took 80 minutes to be checked into a room, we had resevatons weeks ahead. They stuck us in a room that reeked, the room was filthy the bed was broken to the extent that all you had to do was look at it. We reserved a NONSMOKING 2 DOUBLE BED ROOM. We received a SINGLE BROKEN BED IN A FILTHY, STINKY SMOKING ROOM IN WHICH WHEN WE MOVED THE BED TO SQUEZE THE ROLL AWAYS THEIR WERE A TON OF CIGAREETE BUTTS UNDERNEATH. The staff acts if you are annoying them. I think they have to listen to people complain so much that they are immune to it. The tenth floor is moldy it will offend you the moment the elevator door opens. We had our room moved three times and they were all disgusting. I have never paid so much to be totally screwed in my life. I bet the shelters in NYC are cleaner and your belongings just as safe. THE ONLY REASON THEY ARE STILL IN BUSINESS IS THEIR LOCATION. I BET THEY DO NOT RECEIVE REPEAT BUSINESS.

<Title>“Never Again!”
<Content>What a horrible place. There was no ice to be found on any floor, lost money in 2 soda machines, mold growing in bathroom, shift supervisor was rude and pretended to be the manager at first until pressed for owner's phone number. If you already booked - it's worth losing the money and book another hotel. Loser hotel on Lexington! Dirty, dirty, dirty.

<Title>“Great hotel at a Great price”
<Content>We had a 4 night stay for a group of 5 of us and had 3 rooms. All of us were happy. Hotel under renovation but the noise was during the day and we were sight seeing. Clean, comfortable rooms. Excellent central location and staff helpful. No problems here.

<Title>“Okay for a One Night Stay”
<Content>We stayed at the Metropolitan Hotel December 29 & 30. We had a large party and it was not a pleasant experience. When we got to the hotel we had trouble getting our rooms. We had called earlier that day to confirm that we had two rooms with two full size beds. When we got to the hotel we found that the rooms each had one King bed in each. After a long talk with management we got the rooms but they were on different floors. The rooms were dirty and the bathrooms were terrible. The soap was open and the toilet was dirty. We wont be staying there again.

<Title>“Great hotel!!!”
<Content>Don't belive any bad things about this hotel, we stayed last year for 4 nights and had no problems! Hotel was clean and smart and the staff were really helpful and friendly. The postion of the hotel is great, only a few blocks from all main attractions and there is a underground right outside the hotel. One thing i will say is don't use the phone in your room as it cost a mint! I paid around $90 for 2 calls home (England) that lasted around 5 mins in total! Hotel has all the sevices you expect, ATM machine, hairdryers, gift shop e.t.c. All in all a great hotel, would stay again!

<Title>“Nightmare on Lexington”
<Content>I knew I was in trouble when I checked in to find that the hotel is undergoing renovations, and there was no food service other than a continental breakfast. My room had scratched furniture and stains on the carpet. Renovations or no, that is the sign of a dive. My first night was uneventful, but upon returning from a late dinner the next night, I discovered a large cockroach or some such insect taking up residence in the bathroom. Recognizing that such insects rarely travel alone, I called the front desk. They sent up someone from security (who knows why-- maybe the guy was going to arrest the roach), but by then the roach had crawled into a hole in the wall near the floor. I packed by bag and went to the front desk. The manager offered me two options. The first was to have the room sprayed. Great--I spend the night breathing in that poison. The second option is to be moved to another room -- but they only have rooms in the smoking section, so I can breath in that poison instead. I asked them to find me accomodations in another hotel, but they claimed that all hotels are booked solid from here to Laguardia. I wanted to call Amtrak to see if there were any trains back home (since I was leaving the next day anyway). The manager could not even provide a phone book to assist me (the rooms have no phone books, not even a Gideon bible). But it was already 11:15 and the next train was not until 3 AM. So, with no choice, I agreed to be moved to a smoking room. More scratches, more stains on the rug, but I survived the night. The next morning I go to take a shower (the shower heads are only high enough to give you a colonic irrigation) and the knob came off in my hand!!! I showered as best I could, packed up and went to check out. I told the manager of my experiences, and he would not offer to discount the price. Instead he offered me the laughable options of either (i) late checkout privileges (I explained to him that my goal was to escape that hellhole as soon as possible, and not delay it), or (ii) am "upgrade" upon my next visit to the hotel (which I explained was extremely unlikely). Avoid this place like the plague!!!

<Title>“Beware!”
<Content>This was the hotel from hell. We went to New York for a long weekend. The first night we were put in our "superior room" which was a smaller than normal double bed in a filthy room with stained and torn carpets. We called the manager and he agreed to switch us to another room - it was the same only a little cleaner. At 2 a.m. the toilet overflowed and flooded the bathroom. We had to go down to the lobby and use the bathroom the next morning. We couldn't shower until they fixed it after 10:00. They finally moved us to a bigger room but it was not much better. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone at this time. For $159 a night I expected at least clean and functional accomodations - even in New York City. This was without a doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The restaurant and bar are shut down for renovations, they are doing construction and renovating which they dearly need but in the mean time the guests are paying the price with construction noise, dirty old deteriorated rooms, and very uncomfortabel accomodations all the way around.

<Title>“not too bad!!!!”
<Content>we stayed at the Metropolitan for 9 nights from 1st march until 10th march 2004. we made the mistake of booking then reading reviews and as you can imagine we were filled with dread! we were told when we booked that the hotel was under some renovation but it only affected the fitness centre! not true the reception, bar and restuarant which is closed! are all being renovated so are some of the floors and rooms which is well needed!!!! When we arrived and got to our room, our fears were realised it felt dirty, drab and small stains on carpets bed cover was threadbear though the sheets were very clean it has no frills at all ! we were not happy but at that point to tired to complain. In the morning i went straight down to reception and asked for another room i explained that they must have got our reservation mixed we are supposed to have a superior room, I was told that it was a superior room at this time I asked what she meant and she told me that allthe normal superior rooms are under renovation so the best of the normal standard rooms are being classed as superior! but she moved us to a slightly better room but we lost our view. apart from a couple of other minor quibbles we got used to it. its is in a good location and the staff are friendly! This will be a very good hotel when all the renovations are finished! and having seen the plans i think the rating will go up!Having got home and reviewed the holiday we enjoyed very much and the hotel didnt deter from that so dont let it worry you any problems just speak to reception and they will help!or dont go to this hotel until june thats when everything is supposed to be finished.

<Title>“Very pleasant experience”
<Content>My wife, 2 year son and I stayed at the Metropolitan Hotel from March 3rd to 7th, 2004 and although I was a little apprehensive about the hotel due to some reviews I had read it turned out that I had nothing to fear. Our room was very clean and a good size for a New York hotel. The staff were courteous and very friendly and happy to help us out with directions and recommendations. Even though the hotel was being refurbished there was absolutely no inconvenience caused by the renovation. Some of the reviews included comments about peeling wallpaper and stained carpet but our room was very comfortable and there were no signs of such issues. Perhaps we were lucky or perhaps too many people expect a 5 star hotel for the half the price.

<Title>“Although A Bit Worn, This Hotel Is A Great Value”
<Content>This hotel is a great value in the $125 a night range given its location and access to the subways. No, this hotel is not the Waldorf. Yes, it is a bit aged and the current remodeling plan is going to help. If you are traveling and need a one or two night stay in the heart of manhattan, this is a great place. If you will be spendnig a lot of time in your room or will be entertaining, you may want to pay a bit more and stay elsewhere.

<Title>“Central location, right next to a subway stop!”
<Content>We stay at the Metropolitan Hotel every time we come to NY (about 4 times a year.) It feels like our home away from home. Yes, there is a fire department across the street, but it's never been a problem noise wise, and you can ask for rooms that don't face it if you want. The rooms are good sized for NYC (if you are not used to hotel rooms in NYC, they are generally very small compared to other areas of the country) and very clean. They are larger rooms than some of the 4 and 5 star hotels we've stayed at in the city. No, they aren't posh, and sometimes you may find some chipped paint or a corner of the wallpaper peeling in the bathroom. But for the price, this is a great hotel. Staff is very friendly, there is a coffee shop right next to the hotel, and you are literally 50 feet from a subway stop - the biggest plus, in our opinion! Plus, you are just a couple of blocks from Rockefeller Plaza and all the mid-town sites. The location and reasonable price makes this our favorite hotel. They frequently run specials (stay 3 nights, get the 4th free, etc.) through Expedia, so check that site to see what the rates are before booking directly with the hotel. The hotel also has a frequent guest program, you can sign up on their website.

<Title>“Not up to its rating”
<Content>We stayed here November 2003 for a 4 night break with our little boy. We had a long wait checking in, and they took time tracking down our reservation. The hotel lobby was very basic, in much need of renovation and the room itself was in great need of renovation and wasnt very clean. We ate in the hotel 'Grill' which was very nice but very expensive for what essentially is 'Snack' type food. Best thing about this hotel is its central location. Wouldn't advise friends to use this hotel if they were going to New York City

<Title>“Great location, probably worth it if you pay under $100USD a night”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the Metropolitan Hotel NYC on the weekend of Feb. 7th. Overall, the location is great and the proximity to the subway was excellent. The room itself was "adequate" (dirty tiles, frayed carpets, and stains), but definately in need of a rennovation. Things to avoid: pop machines on the floor may not work and just chew up your change, try to get a room at least 4-5 rooms away from the elevators (quieter between 12am-5am..but otherwise pretty loud), and if you're in a rush, electronic check out doesn't work so make sure you make other arrangements. Overall, our superior room was a little overpriced (over $100USD/night) for the quality so I would recommend you wait until rennovations are completed (May 2004) before trying this hotel.

<Title>“Humph”
<Content>Oooooh, good points: Good location, LOVELY food!!! Bad points: Bloody fire station!!!!!! Honestly!!!!! Breakfast was diiiiire!!!! Only ate there once and we recieved our money back due to the poor selection at the buffet. When we arrived our reservation hadn't come throught, so we had to make do with a cramped room after a sweaty 6 hour flight (was very annoyed). Food overpriced. Also, if they offer you a transfer to the hotel, DON'T take it! We waited over an hour after a long flight (and not a good one) and it turned out that it would've been cheaper to get a taxi, and when we were on the overly-cramped bus, the idiot driver took us to the wrong hotel. No seatbelts, and the road was bumpy and the roof was low - had a good few bumps on my head the next day! Also, the driver reminded me of Benny Hill. A very creepy old man!

<Title>“Great Hotel!”
<Content>I stayed at the Metropolitan for 2 nights. I found the staff very polite and helpful. I booked my room through hotels and got a great deal ($109.00) a night. My room was exactly what I expected it to be. It was small, but that's what you would expect in New York City. My room, bed and bathroom were spotless. The location of the hotel was the best. It is right in the middle of everything. I didn't hear many, if any, sirens during my stay. My room was also very warm, with a working thermostat. I was nervous prior to my arrival after reading all of the reviews on this site, but when I arrived and was shown my room I was delighted. I would defintely book my next trip to New York at the Metropolitan.
