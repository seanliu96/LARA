<Title>“Right sized resort, excellent service”
<Content>A medium sized "boutique" resort of around 100 units in lovely Playa. Note: Very central, walking distance to everywhere but NOT a beachfront location. A very good alternative to the massive and expensive five star "palaces" along the beach. Style: Caribbean/South Pacific faux design, yet works quite well. Highlight: VERY friendly front desk staff, eager to satisfy the customers with a broad smile and excellent service. Cleanliness and room service very good. A la Carte breakfast is ok, yet not spectacular, service is sometimes a bit lacking. Secure parking for guests can be arranged across the road, @ $10.00 per 24 hours, by prior notice. In summery: very pleasant,"homely" stay at La Tortuga. Recommended. NB :Please don't miss the incredible "Ah!Cacao" coffee/chocolate shop on corner of Consituyentes & Av 10!

<Title>“Tranquil, Great Service and Very Helpful”
<Content>We stayed here for a total of 6 days in March 2012. For 3 of these days we stayed in room 117 - one of the Junior suites. It has a private Jacuzzi on the rooftop of the room which is great to relax in after the sun has gone down. The rooms were briliantly cleaned, the staff of the entire hotel were very friendly and helpful. Laura and Yanine on Reception are very helpful for local advice and where to find the quitest beaches (get a collectivo to Tulum - about £1.50) and go and snorkel with Turtles and on gorgeous reefs etc. The restaurant staff of Arial (the manager) and his happy,smiling, nothing is a problem attitude team made our stay all the more better. The food was very good - much better than the majority of the touristy 'restaurants' in Playa. After trying a few (non-touristy restaurants - we didnt bother with the 'popular ones') we gave up and ate at the hotel instead. We really have to mention Fidel's cocktails. During our time in Playa Del Carmen we also stayed in a 5* Resort just up the coast - we can honestly say that Fidels cocktails were better than any of the cocktails that we had in the 5* resort (Grand Velas). Even if you are not staying at La Tortuga - go there for a couple of Fidel's cocktails - he makes a wicked Mojito - Mayan Style - it really is worth it. Whilst the hotel is situated very close to 5th avenue - its very quiet yet you can easily access the nightlife, the local beach or you can get a collectivo and be on a quiet beach on about half an hour. We had no criticism of the hotel at all - and we travel extensively both through work and leisure so we know what we are talking about. Jules & Laura from London, England

<Title>“Poor experience”
<Content>First I would like to say that there was nothing wrong with the room or the cleaning staff, which are the most important things in a hotel. The room was comfortable, the place was always clean, the pool was beautiful and the hot tub was the highlight of late afternoons. The real problem with this place was some staff members. Laura and Yanina, at the front desk, were always helpful. But I had a very bad experience with another front desk person, whose name I've forgotten. She was arrogant and not helpful at all. When she finally understood that I needed help she called the manager, who showed up at my room unannounced and wanted to make my undone bed his office. I cannot express in how many ways this gentleman bothered me, he disrespected my privacy and never gave me a chance to express what I really needed help with. After being told that I needed him to leave my room he turned rude and left me without a solution to a problem he never bothered to try to understand. And this was not a language problem, he spoke fine English and I speak decent Spanish. I would not stay at this place again.

<Title>“Nice people, great location, good food, OK room”
<Content>I felt very welcome at La Tortuga, and very much liked that it was close to everything - Avenida 5 and the beach - without being in the middle of the noise. Breakfast and WiFi Internet access were included in the price. Parking in the nearby garage was $10. (General advice: don't even *think* about staying in a hotel on Avenida 5 unless you want 24/7 action and noise). My room was just OK, considering the room rate. I would have liked to have a chair. There's a lot on the plus side, though. The room was clean, the air conditioning worked, there was enough hot water, and the bathroom amenities were good. The bed was too soft for my liking, but that's a matter of personal taste.

<Title>“Convenient to 5th Ave, Friendly”
<Content>Stayed at the La Tortuga Hotel. It is very convenient to 5th Avenue where all the bars and shopping occurs. Its 1/2 block walk to 5th Ave. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant had specials each day. The staff remembers the guests names. The bartenders are very friendly and willing to help you in any way possible. Booked several tours with their front desk. The tours were exactly as they described. The housekeeping dept. had a surprise for us each day: the towels were always arranged in a different way each day on the bed. They were a variety of animals or other creative displays. It was a lot of fun walking into the room each day.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>We really enjoyed our stay at La Tortuga. We stayed in a junior suite with a king size bed, small balcony, and in-bathroom jacuzzi. The hotel is located 1 block from 5th avenue, which makes it nice and quiet but still puts you next to all the restaurants and shopping with a short walk to the beach. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant is included and is good. The courtyard/pool area is very nicely landscaped and maintained. The pool is completely shaded, which was good for us (we used it when we wanted to escape the sun at the beach), but this may not appeal to all guests. The hotel does not have its own beach but you can use Mamita's beach club for free (we were told, but did not try because it looked crowded) or Ziggy Beach club, where 200 pesos per person gets you beach loungers for the day, and this fee counts towards any drinks or food ordered from the club. We also spent a day at the beach at La Tortuga's sister hotel in Tulum, Cabanas, Tulum, where we were warmly welcomed "home" with complimentary welcome drinks and excellent service. The staff was great and our room was cleaned thoroughly every day. We would stay again.

<Title>“Good not Great”
<Content>Overall our stay was very pleasant, however we came with a somewhat higher expectation based on the numerous times where La Tortuga was ranked number one on TripAdvisor, and were a little disappointed based on that expectation. High Points – Front Desk staff and their responsiveness. Breakfasts. Tranquil atmosphere. Proximity to best restaurants, shopping, and beach. Lounging areas. Lush landscaping. Staff is always cleaning, especailly the pool. Value for the price compared with the all-inclusives and other boutiques in the area (when you book ahead). Low Points – Smallish Jr. Suite and storage so you live out of your suitcase. Small bathroom. Musty air conditioning smell (needed to burn incense). Murky hot tub water. Some older, frayed, towels. Problems getting wash cloths every day. Little to no sun by the pool. Could use some sprucing up externally – paint, a few holes in thatched roofs over balconies and walkways. Would I stay there again or recommend to a friend? Yes, but I might also try some place else first.

<Title>“Buyer Beware”
<Content>This place is in need of updating and there are simply better options for about the same price like the Taj or Deseo. Managment was sub-par and I heard the same phrases throughout my stay said to guests requesting an early check-out: "Did you see the photos posted on line? Did you read the all the info in your confirmation email". But my favorite repeated phrase was "the passes for Mamitas Beach Club may not be honored"...and sure enough, the passes were worthless. I was very disatisfied. Not recommended.

<Title>“Great service, location, food and spa”
<Content>These people know service. Being Danish I am not used to it at all and it is therefore the more welcomed. From we stepped in we were warmly welcomed, offered a drink and our suitcases taken care of. NICE! The pool area is clean and nice, but small pools so don't plan on doing laps:) the food is really good in the restaurant, and you are 1 min walk from 5th street and 3 min from the beach. Our room had "swim up" which means you can enter the pool from you patio. Fun and I guess great for kids, but not something I would pay much extra for. SPA massages are well done, and pedicures amazingly good according to my wife:) only thing that could have improved the hotel was ocean front location. I highly recommend the place.

<Title>“Perfect place for a couple!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed there a while ago and we were not disappointed at all! Great food, everybody was very nice and helpful, clean and romantic! It's not on the beach but is walking distance from everywhere. The first two nights we stayed at the room with the jacuzzi on the roof but we don't think it's worth it. You'll use the jacuzzi only once. The room is big and beautiful but maybe a regular room is best. Thank you La Tortuga!

<Title>“Cute, friendly hotel with super restaurant attached”
<Content>My sister and I spent a week at La Tortuga and thoroughly enjoyed it. Staff were very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. Our room was much bigger than expected and our bathroom was huge! Located just off the main street in Playa, the situation was excellent for eating out or heading to the shops or the buses for trips out of town. The free sun lounger at beach club was an excellent addition, we went there most days (people who say the walk is too long are being harsh - it was well worth it). Le Bistro restaurant attached to the hotel served some of the best food we ate all holiday. Somewhere we'd visit again.

<Title>“Relaxing, upscale accomodations, not at all pretentious”
<Content>My husband and I spent five nights at La Tortuga in February 2012 and our stay exceeded our expectations. The entire staff was extremely friendly, the included breakfast options were plentiful and it was extremely convenient to have such a good quality restaurants within steps of our room. The outdoor environment at the hotel was beautiful and created a relaxing and inviting space. It was a pleasure to simply sit poolside and enjoy the view. We didn't feel like we were in a city at all while at the hotel but it was very convenient to be only a few blocks from the beach, shopping and restaurants for the times we wanted a more bustling experience. While not large by American standards the room itself was very good. It was extremely clean and the king size bed was very comfortable. My only wish was that there were a few drawers where we could store our belongings so that we didn't have to literally live out of our suitcase while we were there but this is a very minor point. I highly recommend that travelers to Playa del Carmen stay at La Tortuga. I don't know what the other rooms were like but we were happy that we paid a little extra for a small walk out patio that was poolside.

<Title>“A Honeymoon to Remember!”
<Content>My wife and I recently spent nine PERFECT nights in Playa del Carmen at La Tortuga Hotel and Spa. We were celebrating our Honeymoon and in our search for a place to stay in Mexico we knew that we didn't want to do the all inclusive thing. Thanks to Tripadvisor we stumbled upon La Tortuga and let me tell you it was fate. From the minute we booked our stay to the sad moment that we checked out, the staff at La Tortuga made us feel like royalty. The attention to every single possible detail could be the template for any service industry company. Everything from our room to the pool to the spa provided us with the relaxing oasis we were looking for. To top it off the crew at El Bistro Cafe made breakfast everyday an absolute pleasure. You will not be let down.

<Title>“Great Place to stay”
<Content>This was my first time in Mexico and I wanted to stay in in a place that wasn't one of those mega all inclusive resorts, but somewhere smaller but with a good service. After a long research I found la Tartuga, the service and the response was great from the start, very helpful. The place is perfect and what makes it special is the people that works there. The front desk girls are wonderful. Alfredo the guy that look after the guest, you can't love him enough, he is such a sweet fella. The restaurant waiters are also very friendly and good. The hotel delivers what it says, it's functional, clean, good value for money, great service without pretending to be something they are not. If you are going to Playa del Carmen this is a great place to stay. And 5th avenue is just around the corner, but more important the 10/15/20th av where the mexican's restaurants and real people are and you pay almost nothing to eat out. One last thing, even if the hotel is not by the sea, Mamita is not very far (Mamita being their place by the sea).

<Title>“I wanted to love it based on others reviews, but I didn't...”
<Content>Based on other TA reviews, I had high expectations, but I was disappointed in my experience. The Room I understand its humid, but our room had an overpowering smell of mildew. In fact, when we got home our clothes brought the smell back home to us! We booked a suite with a rooftop jacuzzi but in reality, it's a big bathtub with jets, which overlooked a deserted construction site. The outdoor furniture also needed a good cleaning. The side porch off our front door featured a very bright light that you couldn't turn off, which didn't make you want to sit out there in the evening. The lighting in the bathroom was really poor/dark. Doing my makeup in the evening was quite the challenge. They were also very stringent with the towels. Each day we only received 2 bath towels, yet only one wash cloth and hand towel. And most evenings we'd have a towel animal waiting for us (which I loved), but they didn't leave any other towels in the whole place. Just seemed odd. And there isn't one towel rack in the whole place so you used a towel and then what? While none of these issues independently is a big deal, all these things compounded left me disappointed.

<Title>“IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE!!!!”
<Content>This was my husband and I's second trip to La Tortuga. We just LOVE it here. it is so relaxing and perfect your life is complete once you've been a guest at La Tortuga. Everything about the hotel is perfect from the size, to the service to the little bar and hot tub. The waitstaff is amazing and even remembered us!! Jose is an amazing waiter and even had a smile on his face after being in the hospital the day before!! I can't wait to go back to La Tortuga soon! The only problem with Playa is that I noticed this time that the shops down 5th ave the owners and workers are getting more annoying and trying to get you to go into there shops. It seems like Playa is slowly turning into a more commercialized place, I hope it keeps its uniqunes and locals don't drive away the tourists by being too pushy.

<Title>“Wonderful!!! Beautiful Boutique Hotel!”
<Content>My fiance and I absolutely loved this hotel. We went in May of 2011 and got engaged at Tulum. I am so glad this hotel was a part of this memory. The staff was EXTREMELY friendly and accommodating. The location was perfect...right off of Avenida Quinta, close enough to walk around but far enough not to be "in the middle" of it all. One of my favorite parts about this place is the restaurant. The food is amazing and breakfast was delicious every morning. The waiters are very amicable and attentive. Don't forget to order the Mayan Style eggs, I've been craving them ever since! If you are looking for a hotel that doesn't feel massive and overwhelming with kids running around all over the place, look no further. La Tortuga is comfortable, intimate and beautiful. Their staff will always greet you with a genuine smile. I can't wait to go back someday!

<Title>“Very relaxing hotel”
<Content>What more can be said about this hotel that hasn't already been said. Service was second to none. Fidel the bartender was amazing serving up drinks during happy hour and sharing a story and making you feel like the only guests in the hotel The doorman and reception staff were all friendly, amazingly helpful and always smiling. We did hear a little noise from some of the local bars between 2:00 am and 5:00 am which was annoying at times but nothing the hotel could do about it. Our room was a little musty which had something to do with our air conditioner that didn't work that well. Nothing to complain about but something that may bother a complainer. We wouldn't hesitate recommending this hotel at all.

<Title>“Relaxation in the heart of Playa”
<Content>My friend and I stayed at La Tortuga last week and we thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and the friendly service by staff (a special mention for Alfredo, who always had a smile on his face and time to chat and Rafael at reception {thank you for the Tequila advice})! The hotel grounds are really nice and well maintained and it's no wonder that while relaxing in the jacuzzi, you feel as though you're in an oasis. Breakfast at El Bistro was great and whilst I initially considered myself to be crazy for ordering a chorizo and egg burrito for breakfast, it was absolutely delicious. I also recommend the fruit shakes.... papaya was my favourite. The hotel has a great location as it's just around the corner from 5th Ave and several bars/clubs. I note that a few reviewers mentioned that noise was an issue for them, but I didn't find this to be the case (we were in room 302). Although it's a bit of a walk to get to Mamita's Beach Club (one of the 2 beach clubs the hotel gives you passes to), the place had great drinks, food and music. A quick note for the single people reading this review.... I love a nice hotel which is why I picked La Tortuga, but I didn't realise until we arrived that it's more so a 'couples' hotel. Not that this would deter me from staying here again, as the hotel is amazing, but we were the only non-couple as far as I noticed... just so you know.

<Title>“perfect oasis in playa del carmen”
<Content>I can't say enough great things about this place, our stay here was amazing! Get the swim up suite or go big and try for room 116 or 117 (we were in 109, it was beautiful but lacked the hammock and pool top jacuzzi of 116 & 117). There are ~50 rooms here so it's the perfect size, my boyfriend previously lobbied for all inclusive resorts anytime I booked trips - thank you La Tortuga for convincing him that is the wrong way to go! I also loved that there were no kids/infants anywhere inside the place. This place was so relaxing and beautiful, we were sad to leave the property and the friendly staff. The restaurant is delicious and the service was impressive. It has a great proximity to the beach and 5th street but is so quiet once you pass through the lobby. I can't imagine a better place to stay while in Playa Del Carmen. The beach clubs were nice but we laid out on the beach near the end of 14th street for a few days. Access to the water wasn't the best but it was a nice quiet spot away from the crowds and vendors. Skip the tours and let the front desk simply book you a driver (Martin if possible) to take you to the ruins and cenotes. It was half the price of the tours and nice to have a private guide & go on our own schedule. Somehow we overlooked the bikes at the entrance of the Coba ruins, definitely rent them if you go.

<Title>“A perfect end to our holidays”
<Content>We stayed the last 2 nights of our holidays and it was a perfect fit for us. We were close enough to most everything, even walked to Walmart for some wine and a cable for our ipad. Upon registering, I politly mentionned some concern over the noise comments of others and they gave us a room more on the inside and it was fine for us. It was clean, had a small fridge and had everything to be expected from a hotel room. We enjoyed the beach club, 5th avenue and plenty of walking and shopping. Their was a small rest area at our floor level with an open area with one table and some chairs and we spent a quiet evening sipping our wine and looking out to a side street. Even had a late night burrito from the little snack place across the street which was delicious. It was a good feel for the end of our trip....would not hesitate to recommend ......

<Title>“A Relatively Good Value In Playa Del Carmen”
<Content>I really am challenged between giving this hotel 3 or 4 stars but have opted for the higher rating simply because it seems that Playa Del Carmen Hotels are a tad pricey for what you get. The hotel is located a stones throw from the main tourist street 5th avenue, which is good and bad. The good part is the easy access to a wide array of restaurants and shops. The bad is the noise from nearby nightclubs which made it difficult for me to sleep. This must be a big problem for all hotels near the clubs and there are many. The standard plus room is pretty small. I did expect a more comfortable room for the money and thus had some difficulty viewing the hotel as a good value. However, they made up for their limitations with the following: 1) An excellent authentic Mexican breakfast at their restaurant downstairs. Breakfast is included with the room and is not a buffet. They have some great fresh juices which are not to be missed. Get one of the green one's. The restaurant is also very good for dinner. 2) Towels and passes are made available to two local beach clubs each day. My wife and I enjoyed the beach. 3) A discounted 30 minute massage also came with the room and was outstanding, absolute bliss. 4) Although close to all the tourist mayhem, the hotel has a secluded feel and the common areas are nice and comfortable. 5) The staff are very friendly, helpful and ask for suggestions to improve the experience. I would stay there again, however, not sure if there is much they can do about the noise.

<Title>“A little oasis”
<Content>The facade is ordinary, but once you are inside its like an oasis. What a charming and cozy hotel. Likes: - The ambience and the sanctuary-feel inner area of the hotel, which has the living room, a bar, Jacuzzi, and swimming pool. - The service: everyone is so friendly and happy to assist you, things are more personalized here as it’s a smaller hotel - The happy hour - The breakfast (lots to choose from) - The free beach lounger coupon for the Mamitas beach club - The location Dislike: Our windowless room (perhaps we should’ve booked the room with balcony on the inner courtyard), which was a little depressing and gives you the feel of a holiday in the mountain rather than a beach vacation.

<Title>“Perfect honeymoon location”
<Content>We just came back from a week long honeymoon at La Tortuga and are already trying to figure out when we can go back. First, the service is amazing. The staff remembered who we are and were constantly asking how are stay was and if there was anything they could do for us. The staff at El Bistro was friendly every morning for breakfast and for the one dinner we at there. The bartender at the poolside bar was also friendly and fun to talk to. The front desk staff was wonderful. We worked with them to take a day trip to Akumal and Tulum and they helped us figure out our options. They recommended Claudio, a taxi driver that we got for the whole day for a very reasonable price. We were very happy with this decision. They were always quick to get us new beach towels, open doors or even loan us an umbrella for the rainy nights. The hotel itself is beautiful! We loved spending time in the jacuzzi and sitting on the outdoor couches near the bar. The whole area is lush and green. The pool is very clean. It rained a few times on our trip so the pool was a bit cool but we got in for awhile. We had a second floor balcony room that overlooked the pool. The room itself wasn't large but was perfect for our needs as we didn't plan to spend much time in it. The shower was a good size and had warm water and good water pressure. The location is perfect. Just a block from all the shops and restaurants of 5th avenue and 2 blocks from the beach. It is right off Calle Corazon, a short street that is lit up at night and has a great gelato shop. We loved that our package allowed us to eat lunch and dinner off the hotel property because there are so many amazing restaurants. I would not do all-inclusive in Playa. The beach is only about 2 blocks away. La Totuga guests can get passes for free chairs and umbrellas at Mamitas Beach Club (about a 9 block walk down 5th avenue). It is large with music and fun people watching. For a quieter, smaller option get a pass from the front desk for Zenzi (about a 6 block walk the other way down 5th avenue). You have to buy a certain amount of food and beverages ($200 pesos while we were there) but the pass gets you a discount. Zenzi has beach beds that are comfortable to lounge on. We got amazing massages at La Tortuga's spa. The massage therapists listened to our needs and were cautious in areas that were sensitive for us. We could not be more impressed with La Tortuga and highly recommend this location to anyone looking to stay in Playa Del Carmen. Also, if you to Tulum, stop by their sister location at Ziggy Beach. It is more of a laid back beach vibe and really beautiful.

<Title>“Welcoming retreat”
<Content>Set one block back from the main tourist street and 10 mins walk from main bus station, this hotel is the ideal retreat from the hustle and bustle of commercial Playa del Carmen. It is designed in a cave style and you can hop across the pool to get to your room. The room had a luxurious feel and was cosy with a very comfortable bed and good lighting. The en suite had a shower and not a full bath however, this wasn't a problem for us. The balcony was lovely and it was nice to look out onto the swirly pool and all the trees. We didn't think the pool was practical to use but there's a hot tub which you can use and the sun loungers are nice . The standout experience for us at this hotel was the restaurant. Friendly, curteous staff offering fresh juices and a fabulous selection of mexican and non mexican hot options for breakfast. All really tasty. We had dinner there one night and the service of the staff was amazing. Get them to make you a Mayan coffee! Overall, service at the hotel was great. The towel puppetry that the cleaning staff make was a nice touch. The spa staff were friendly and gave us a complimentary massage. The Mamita beach club passes were handy and in our opinion this club is situated on the nicest part of the beach (even though its slightly further away from the hotel than the other beach club they offer passes for).

<Title>“we're not impresssed”
<Content>standard room was small and tired; with an extremely small window, it is extremely dark and depressing. no quilt in the room (you could use the cover instead but i wonder how frequent it is washed). the room was not thoroughly cleaned (there were molds on the air conditioner; there were small insects and tiny leaves in the coffee machine!). what is even worse was the service. the nigt shift receptionist, mergana, refused to assist in confirming our pick up arrangement but making just a simple call; instead she just pushed us to her colleague. while I wasspeaking to her in english, she kept on speaking Spanish to her colleague as if I were invisible. what mergana was busy with was drinking a glass of red wine and talked to another colleague. what a job she did!

<Title>“Great Balcony”
<Content>Stayed in the Junior suite with rooftop spa pool view for 5 nights. The outdoor part was awesome, great balcony and then very private seperate spa area on top - got a lot of use out of it. Room was a bit disappointing, for a suite its just a smaller size hotel room (but if you include the balcony and roof its a very good size) still felt a little cramped, and there was a lot of moisture in the air, had a really hard time sleeping on the first night for that reason, they did bring up a dehumidifier which did help. Breakfasts were fantastic. No gym which was again a bit disappointing. I was a bit worried about the noise from the nightclubs nearby but I couldn't hear it inside the room. Overall its a great location with a fantastic balcony and spa.

<Content>We live in Playa so from time to time we go to La Tortuga to enjoy their jacuzzi. We stay at one of the suites and really spend a good time. Their TV´s are tiny so we don´t even feel like watching it, but, for a romantic weekend getaway it has proven to be a great place!

<Title>“A Relaxing Retreat”
<Content>Spent two nights here and had a great visit. Even though it is not right on the beach, it is very close to most of the attractions (restaurants, shops and bars). I opted for one of the suites with a rooftop jacuzzi. The room was small, but well equipped. The usual toiletry suspects were present - minus shampoo (???). On the first night we had a problem with the jacuzzi and although it was nearly 10pm, the maintenance staff came right away and corrected the problem. (kudos!) Breakfast at the bistro on-site was always tasty and included a multitude of options. The pool and jacuzzi are in the central courtyard and while they're attractive, they didn't seem to get much use and they don't get much sun exposure. The short walk over to Marmitas (one of the beach clubs that they have a relationship with) was worth the trip. Although, be sure to leave early. We arrived after the crowd which meant that they were out of chairs and umbrellas. After a bit of handwaving and fuss they offered just chairs - which they ended up adding to my bill. (60 pesos didn't seem worth haggling about - but ticket holder beware). I don't blame the hotel staff for this - it seemed like scamming by the beach club cabana boys. Spa treatments are discounted for hotel guests. They weren't terribly busy and I was able to make same day reservations just hours before, even on a weekend in January. All in all, I thought that this hotel was a solid bargin for the price. If you want to be right on the beach, pick someplace else. But if you want a relaxing retreat with lush greenery and super friendly staff - you'll be happy with La Tortuga.

<Title>“Mildew”
<Content>The hotel was charming but small. The air conditioner unit in my room smelled like bad mildew when I turned it on. I was unable to use the air. The place had a nice bar, and very friendly helpful staff. The spa was also nice. It was not on the beach, no beach views. You could however get a ticket to go to one of the beach clubs the for the day. It is very quiet and private. If not for the mildew would have been better. But not for the price I paid.

<Content>My husband and I just added one night onto our all-inclusive stay North of Playa, but we wished we could have stayed longer and plan to come back for sure! This small hotel is quiet and spotless and it's right in the town. The staff is kind and very helpful. If they see you struggling with a suitcase they jump in and help you. There's a great little restaurant right next to the small pool with great prices and a nice little happy hour. Just a darling place...

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel!”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed here two nights at the end of our Mexico trip, and the hotel is beautiful and luxurious! We were upgraded for free to a Standard Plus room and absolutely loved our balcony. I had sort of a hard time finding the hotel at first. I was at the corner of 10th Ave and 14th street and didn't see the hotel...apparently there are two 14th streets a block away from each other, and I was standing at the wrong 14th street and didn't understand the receptionist's description of "walk behind" to find the hotel. That caused a little stress, but she sent the bell boy to look for us, and then all was well! Breakfast both mornings was delicious and Mamita's beach club was great! Located close to all the action on 5th Ave and only 1 block away from the dance clubs on 12th street. If I visit Playa del Carmen again, I will definitely stay here!

<Title>“Went Well Beyond The Call Of Duty - Amazing Customer Service!”
<Content>My husband and I spent 8 nights at Iberostar Grand, but wanted a mini trip in the middle of the week to spend some time in Playa. We obviously chose La Tortuga based on the many positive reviews. I will not waste time repeating all of the wonderful aspects of this hotel and its staff, except for one instance that really stands out. On the morning of check out, we packed our bags and took a cab back to Iberostar Grand. When we arrived, my husband realized he had left a very nice dress shirt hanging in the closet of our room at La Tortuga (we had the room with the private pool...just lovely). He decided that losing the shirt was a casualty of the trip, but I decided to call the front desk of La Tortuga to see if someone found his shirt. Well, they did! AND, they had it delivered to the front desk of Iberostar Grand that afternoon (which is in Playa Paraiso)! The driver didn't even hang around for a tip. Unbelievable customer service. This act of kindness speaks to how this hotel is run in every way. Do not hesitate to book this beautiful little respite from the craziness of the Quinta Avenida!

<Title>“We'll be back”
<Content>We were pleasantly surprised. The pictures made it look like the place could go either way, a really cool boutique hotel, or a bit shabby. It was the former. Very relaxed vibe. Really tasteful and yet not at all over the top decor. Peaceful and quiet environment in the midst of a vibrant night club scene a block away. The bed was comfy, the breakfast was yummy, the service was more than friendly, the price was reasonable. If you aren't into the all-inclusives which might as well be in the states, and you want a bit more contact with Playa del Carmen, this is a wise choice.

<Title>“Outstanding, very kind staff, perfect rooms”
<Content>I went with my sister in april 2011. Staff was very kind, gave some great advice on activities. We went to Isla Mujueres by catamaran and Chichén Itzá (must see!) and off course to the nice beaches of Playa del Carmen. Rooms were always clean, breakfast was good and the staff was really great! They took very good care of us. Always kind with a smile. There are a lot of good restaurants in Playa, but when you have a lazy day, you can also eat very well in the restaurant at La Tortuga. Hotel is perfectly located in the center of Playa del Carmen, yet there was no noise, because the rooms are facing the garden and pool. Children are not allowed. At the reception you can get vouchers for discounts at beachclubs or free sunbeds. It's not my style to go back to places i've been before, but for La Tortuga I will make an exception!

<Title>“Very good”
<Content>So it is playa des carmen and you are neither one tattooed 20 something nor going to spend a week in an all inclusive resort away from town: la tortuga is your hotel. From the warm and friendly welcome from Anna at front desk, to Fernando who will hold the door for you, the whole staff is nice and ready to help. La Tortuga is 1 mn away from 5th avenue and very central. Free wi-fi was available from our room (but slow!) We were in room 116 which is very nice. We had a private upstairs terrace with Jacuzzi and a hammock in front of our downstairs terrace. Bathroom had a giant bathtub which was nice. The only downsides : the club "coco bongo" next door can be noisy. It woke us up around 4am the first night (but not the night after). The breakfast at El bistro is quite good except for the juices that were from a bottle and not freshly squeezed as I had hoped. Overall I would stay there again.

<Title>“Never ever had such a bad experience”
<Content>1. If you ever deal with this hotel chain be careful with your credit card, they keep your card number and charge without authorization as they want. We were overcharged for 4 more nights and have to report fraud. If you deal with that management be very careful. 2 the reason we left hotel 4 nights earlier is that rooms have no air and hotel is not clean. Room smell bad, air conditioning unit distributes dust blowing straight in your bed. When we turned it off, then we realized there are no windows except the door to the courtyard. Noise can be avoided if you have ear plugs, but what to do with the army of bugs, there is no net or curtains to protect from bugs. We spent 2 nights sitting on bed and fighting mosquitoes. Our doctor told us that there are bad diseases in MX you get via bugs. 3 exit strategy. We asked to let us out. We cannot continue vacation in such conditions. Manager became rude and told us that if we do not agree to pay for all nights we were going to stay he will get Mexican police put us in Mexican jail. I called US embassy, and will continue working with gov officials to find out if such statements are approved by Mexican gov against US tourists. Anyway, manager said that if we pay him for one more night that we did not stay in the hotel he will let us out. I gave my American Express card. Johanna on the front desk wanted to keep the card, for what? But when other tourists saw her physically fighting gave it back. When we stayed in their sister hotel in Tulum my husband gave front desk his debit card. They charred that card for extra 4 nights without authorization at all. It is a shame that in such a tourist friendly place such hotels and management can do business. It is a shame that for the first time in Mexico we have to be concerned for our safety as the La Tortuga manager (Benjamin he said his name is) stated that if we write bad review we will not get out safely. Shall it be a police matter? But who will compensate for lost vacation time? Feel free to ask me any questions.

<Title>“Amazing stay at La Tortuga”
<Content>This was our first time in Playa del Carmen, and did we ever luck out with this hotel! The reviews on tripadvisor are bang on. Great location, short walk to all clubs and restaurants, the pier (ferry to Cozumel), and the beaches of course. The service in the hotel was the best we've ever encountered - they went above and beyond to help us with every aspect of our stay. Our room was average, but very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was delicious, and we loved that they served it until 12noon (and 2pm on Sundays for the late risers). The hotel is a little paradise and we would not hesitate to recommend to friends and will most certainly return in the future.

<Title>“Playa del carmen oasis”
<Content>Hotel la Tortuga is a little oasis on 10th avenue. For everbody who hates the big all inclusive resorts this should be your choice. The hotel is nice and quiet with lots of personal attention of the staff. We had a great time and got to know most of the staff pretty well. I got sick after a few days and the girl at the reception made sure the doctor came to the hotel within an hour even when it was christmas sunday. These things make a huge difference on your holiday. The rooms are kept spotlessly clean, the breakfast is excellent every morning and you feel like you are taking care of. Its a nice boutique hotel with about 40 rooms and no children allowed. We had a nice room with a rooftop jacuzzi, what a luxury! So if you are looking for tranquility this is the place to be. And still you are only 20 metres away from the crowdy fifth avenue. I want to thank all of the staff: Mickey, Chiapas, Santiago, Fidel, Morgana, Claudia, Pablo and anyone else i may have forgotten. Is there anything to improve on? Well maybe a few things: There is no possibility to dry your wet swimming trunk on your balcony, the water in the pool is a bit cold and sometimes there is no one to serve you at the bar. But these are just minor inconveniences.

<Title>“Don't hesitate...”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga last week and have only one regret and it was that our stay wasn't long enough. We enjoyed every minute of our stay. The hotel is very well located and is near everything. The staff of the hotel is great, always kind and smiling and full of attention for any need you may have. We took a deluxe room and it was very nice and clean with a balcony and stairs to a private terrace with a jaccuzzi on the roof of the hotel. We enjoyed the small flat screen tv and the radio where you can put your ipod. The bedding was of good quality and shower works great.The interior garden and pools are beautiiful and make you forget that you are in the city. Wi-fi was woking nicely everywhere in the hotel ans the breakfast at the restaurant was very good with excellent service. I recommend this place to everyone with no hesitation and will return some day for sure. We found that you have a lot of value there for the price.

<Title>“Excellent hotel”
<Content>Excellent hotel, beautiful interior. I agree with prior reviews, pool layout in the hotel courtyard is amazing (I would go to lounge or read by the pool) but I only saw 1 person in the pool during my entire stay, still it was crystal clear and clean. Rooms were clean as well, I felt there was enough room for 1 couple, glad to see no signs of any insects/lizards in the room (occasional mosquito though). The daily included breakfast was great, made to order burritos, fruit, enchiladas, omelette etc. Everything we tried was delicious, with juice and coffee as well. That and the beach club that's included (a 10-15 minute walk away) makes this hotel a spectacular deal. Location is ideal, a block away from ave 5 (so not TOO close) and a short distance from the beach. All of the staff were very friendly, courteous and very helpful too. Will definitely stay again the next time we return.

The hotel is just beautiful and it is only surpass by the quality of the service of everyone in the hotel. The best clubs, bars, restaurants and the famous fifth avenue are all walking distance from the hotel. It has been the visit to playa del carmen for me. The personnel there they do really great things to help have the best vacation, I forgot my cell phone charge and thought that would have to buy a another one for the trip, but at the reception one of the bell boys lend me his so I could charge my phone. The hotel is very quiet so at night we could get a great sleep. Really a great place to stay

<Title>“This place is amazing”
<Content>My fiance and I just got home from a 10 day stay at La Tortuga and all I can say is we will be back without looking elsewhere. It felt like home away from home. That is if we had a multimillion dollar home just steps from everything in Playa including the beach. It is so close, yet perfectly secluded by it's design. The location is just steps from the beach, 5th street, restaurants, bars, clubs, shopping, banks, and anything you could want in Playa. From the moment the door on our transfer opened, it was apparent that we were in for a treat. Everyone, from the doorman to the manager, from the gardener to reception, was so friendly and so professional. We initially only had a 5 night reservation because we wanted to keep our options open for the remaining nights. Of course, we booked with the front desk through the remainder of our stay after we experienced La Tortuga. We had a superior junior suite and I have to recommend this to anyone considering La Tortuga. We had an in-room jacuzzi, modern accommodations, and the configuration of our room allowed us to basically open up an entire side of our room to the air. A very specific highlight of our trip and stay at La Tortuga was El Bistro, the restaurant inside/attached to the hotel. We had breakfast here every day, lunch and dinner many days. The food is incredible, but even more astounding is the staff at El Bistro. I feel ashamed to call them staff because the worst part of our trip was having to leave them at the end. Every one of them is so good at what they do, which isn't serving food, but making people feel welcome like family. Overall, if you like to get out and explore, people watch, and see things just footsteps from your door, then this is the place to be.

<Content>This cute, charming, rustic style hotel is managed very well. Whoever is in charge there has made sure to hire great personnel and make customer service a priority. Ultimately that's what's make the difference between this hotel and others that are similar in style. Also it helps that the hotel is great size (app 50 rooms) so personal attention is given to everyone. I'd like to thank everyone there for a great experience and hopefully management will keep the same mentality because I want to go back again everytime I visit Playa. Best regards VQ

<Title>“Love this hotel!”
<Content>Just returned from a week at La Tortuga; the rooms are lovely; had a junior suite with in-suite jacuzzi/rain shower; king-size bed; balcony. The bath amenities are terrific! Luxurious brand of everything you will need (great lotions!) and displayed beautifully. The Bistro restaurant is very very good; breakfast included daily (not a buffet!!) and lots of choices: eggs/Mexican specialities/yogurt; granola/fruit/juices/smoothies,etc. Had dinner there; also excellent. The bar has happy hour(s) and serves a fabulous margarita. The pool area is lush with vegetation(thus very little sun) but there is a solarium area with sunbeds. There is a pool table and library. The spa is open from 11a-7pm with full services (I had mani/pedi: CHOCOLATE!/ excellent massage). The service is really excellent; from arrival with a cool fruit juice; to anything you may need; and the staff is sure to remember your name. I am looking forward to a return visit. Oh;and as a single traveler...most important: I felt safe. The location is ideal: close to the action of 5th but remarkeably quiet. They also offer a choice of beach clubs.

<Title>“This hotel was recommended to us by a friend. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others!”
<Content>Very convenient location, around the block from Fifth Ave. No noise complaints, other than a little bit on Saturday night from Coco Bongo down the block. The hotel staff was very helpful- providing tour suggestions and directions. We went to Mamacita's Beach club twice. It's about a 15 min walk from the hotel. Don't miss breakfast! The food is great! We stayed in room 214. It was a duplex, so we each had privacy. My only suggestion would be better lighting in the bedrooms.

<Title>“Our favorite hotel in Playa--a little oasis!”
<Content>We just returned from Playa and once again fournd La Tortuga to be outstanding once again. It is a quiet oasis located right in town with close proximity to the beach, excellent restaurants and shopping. (La Tortuga provides passes to the popular Mamitas beach club). El Bistro at La Tortuga is a "must visit" restaurant for dinner every year in Playa. The staff is very attentive and welcoming--especially Alfredo. We were even able to check in a few hours early. The breakfast, which is included, is a full breakfast with a wide variety of juices. This is not your stripped-down continental stlye fare. I highly recommend La Tortuga.

<Title>“Couldn't have been better....”
<Content>Just returned from our honeymoon at La Tortuga, and would not change a thing! We stayed in the superior Junior Suite, with a private rooftop jacuzzi... Everything about our stay was just the way we wanted it. The room was comfy, the bathroom beautiful, the private rooftop ideal for me (as my husband tends to sleep in). Food was amazing (even the included breakfast). The staff above and beyond. I highly recommend!

<Title>“WOW! It has everything”
<Content>Where to begin. The location is great, one block from 5th Avenue, and close to the beach. Incredible rooms to choose from - some have swim up pool, private pools, or how about a private rooftop jacuzzi? The restaurant El Bistro is delicious. But what really sets this aside is the staff! There are many places to stay in the Mayan Riviera but few with the level of professional, yet pleasant staff. I recommend you spend a few days here and a few days at their sister property in Tulum. Cabanas Tulum. Both have an El Bistro. Oh and I recommend the tuna tartar with avacado. The entire staff went out of their way to make our stay incredible.

<Title>“We definitely will come back to La Tortuga!”
<Content>We met up with our daughter at La Tortuga for 3 days, as she is working in Mexico City and we were on holiday from the UK - what an ideal place to get together. As everyone says, beach etc is in close proximity, but we just loved being around the hotel pool,using the spa, enjoying the restaurant with their good breakfasts and even enjoyed the snack lunches (like pear, strawberry and gorgonzola salad) as well as the evening meals. Couldn't have been nicer - all the staff were very pleasant. We had everything we wanted and hope to meet up again with our daughter there next time. Never thought I'd say that either as a doting grandmother, but definite advantages to there being no young children around!

<Title>“Loved it!”
<Content>We have just returned from 7 nights in La Tortuga and have every intention of staying again....we loved it. The room was spotlessly clean, nicely decorated and extremely comfortable. The breakfast was excellent, and we found the staff both friendly and helpfull. The location is absolutely ideal being around 100 yds off 5th avenue, the beach is about 5 mins walk away (and stunning)....I would definitely recommend 'Mamita's Beach club' with which the hotel has a free arrangement. Never went in the pool....but it looks fantastic...especially at night! For those who may be concerned that you can hear 'Coco Bongo', it's true you can, but only if you really, really listen hard....not an issue.

<Title>“Fantastic stay in Playa del Carmen”
<Content>I just returned from a 5 day trip to Playa del Carmen and stayed 4 nights at La Tortuga. The hotel really impressed us. La tortuga is very well located, a short block to the popular Calle 5 and very close to beach. The hotel is very nice, the staff work all day to keep it looking beautiful, especially the pool area, which needs a lot of maintenance for all the lush vegetation. The included breakfast was phenomenal! every night we looked forward to waking up and enjoying the great selection of their breakfast at El Bistro. the hotel staff was very welcoming and accommodating, it truly made for a personalized experience. We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds, overlooking the pool. it was very spacious, clean, and sitting on the terrace felt so relaxing and tranquil, we couldn't have asked for more. My only teeny tiny complaint is that (I think) the hot tub was broken because it didn't get hotter than 90 deg (which feels warm but not hot, most hot tubs feel right at 104) and therefore we couldn't enjoy getting in every night. i'm sure they will take care of that right away. Also, just FYI, the walk to the beach where they offer free beach chairs and umbrella's (Mamita's) is about a 15 min walk from the hotel. Overall a wonderful stay, and I would definitely book here again on a return trip as opposed to an all inclusive.

<Title>“Great every time”
<Content>I stay at La Tortuga every September as part of a business trip and always add on a couple of additional days to enjoy all that the hotel and Playa Del Carmen have to offer. The rooms are very clean and comfortable and there's a view of the lovely pool area if you have a balcony, as many rooms do. I enjoy sitting in the pool at one of the many nooks reading a book and cooling off from the hot sun and humidity. Since the hotel is small and adult only, the pool area is very quiet and relaxing. I find sitting at the bar to be a great place to met other guests,and free access to the internet an added plus. I love the convenience of having a good restaurant right at the hotel, particularly if I've been working all day. Maybe because I'm a woman traveling alone, but I find the staff very friendly and attentive. I especially love that even the restaurant staff remember me from one year to the next. La Tortuga helps make this a business trip I greatly look forward to every year.

<Title>“Perfect romantic boutique hotel 1/2 block from 5th Avenue”
<Content>Outstanding front desk, bar and restaurant service. Had a 30 minute massage at the spa. Room had a private upstairs jacuzzi and the hotel provided free passes to Mamita's beach club which had beach chairs, lunch and drink service and played music in the late afternoon. The hotel even called ahead when we visited their sister hotel on Ziggy Beach in Tulum (El Bistro) to make sure we had great service. The location is perfect - just a 1/2 block from the north end of 5th Avenue which has great restaurants and shopping. Book a room in the main building - the far side does back against a wall where you can hear a night club if you are not out clubbing. The front desk offered to change rooms - we stayed and adapted. We will absolutely return!

<Title>“Perfect! An oasis of quiet in Playa del Carmen.”
<Content>We only intended staying at La Tortuga for two nights, as we are not fans of busy holiday resorts, but we felt so at home here we stayed for 10! Our room was perfect - spotlessly clean with every comfort. Our balcony had a great view of the lovely pool area, which is so quiet it is hard to believe you are yards away from bustling streets. The restaurant is excellent - the service and food are superb. The main difference here though is really the staff - they genuinely want you to have a great holiday and will do everything they can to make sure this happens. Everybody we met here - particularly the receptionists, waiters, and cleaners went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. We were here when Hurricane Rina was forecast to hit Playa and we could not have been in better hands - we were informed every few hours of the situation and incredibly they managed to continue with service as usual during the tropical storm which left the hotel without electricity for the best part of a day. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough - we will certainly be returning.

<Title>“Fun Unique Hotel”
<Content>I stayed here with two gal pals in April over the Easter holiday. The breakfast here is amazing! The rooms were comfortable and very clean. The pool was so much fun and the lounge area was inviting and relaxing. They do not allow children which makes for a more serene experience. I felt very "at home" here. I enjoy Playa but it was a loud weekend because of the holiday which made retreating to Hotel Tortuga in the evening all the better. The staff is very helpful and friendly. I would easily stay here again and recommend it to anyone who wants a kid free environment.

We loved the hotel and Playa de Carmen so much that we cut the end of our vacation in Chetmul short so we could spend another 3 nights at La Tortuga! The staff were all amazing and genuinely nice. The rooms were super clean with amazing large showers that have the best water pressure. We will always make this our hotel in Playa de Carmen from now on.

<Title>“Amazing Facial at the Spa!”
<Content>I just had one of the most incredible facials I've ever experienced. The facilities are stunning and the service was absolutely amazing - from the receptionist to the beauty therapist - everyone was wonderful. The spa is tucked away like a secret garden in the centre of this hotel and Mosquito Blue (an adjoining hotel that shares the spa) - great location right in the heart of 5th Avenue, but a perfect escape from how busy 5th Avenue is. I'm not staying at the hotel so I cannot comment on the rooms, but the spa is certainly worth visiting while in Playa del Carmen, whether you're a guest or not!

<Title>“Great stay in Playa”
<Content>We wanted to see what it was like to stay in the Playa del Carmen before heading to our all inclusive compound up the coast, so we picked this great hotel. The hotel is like an oasis in the city. Once inside you have no idea 5th Avenue is only steps away. It's the best of both worlds. The room was nice, staff fantastic and the setting very tropical. We visited both affiliated beach clubs and enjoyed Sensi a little more. We'll stay at La Tortuga again when enjoying the heart of Playa.

<Title>“Best room ever”
<Content>I don't typically write reviews, but this place is exceptional. I found it because I wanted a hotel with no kids. My room was perfect: big bed, large patio, clean, large bathroom, shower was huge! Staff was excellent and very helpful. And to boot the restaurant is Excellent (breakfast comes as part of stay). Pool is lagoon like and beautiful and encased by the rooms. I didn't go swimming but they have nice sofas to hang out by the pool, which I spent time reading books. The pool is very shaded, which I think is a plus. If you want sun, walk to the beach to swim. The restaurant being good is nice because honestly most places I ate in Playa were so so or even bad. I personally like smaller/boutique hotels. This is a smaller hotel but has the amenities of a larger one. I wouldn't even bother staying anywhere else. I booked as a package and my room was only about $45 a day. It is close to 5th Ave but if you're smart you'll spend little time on 5th.

<Title>“Quiet/Private feeling, Very friendly service, Excellent breakfast”
<Content>We went to Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, and Isla Mujeres... but La Tortuga hotel was DEFINITELY the best place we stayed. Very clean accomodations, quiet setting, very friendly staff, and an amazing breakfast included! We loved it there!!! Great location for walking to restaurants, shops, beaches, and the ferry. It's just off the main strip, 5th avenue, so it doesn't get the loud noise that those other hotels get, yet it's still close enough that you can walk to the action when you want it. They are not ON the beach, but they do have 2 beaches that you can walk to and are able to use their beach chairs & sun covers at no cost. Let's just say that if/when I go back to Playa, I would definitely stay at La Tortuga again without even thinking twice!

<Title>“Great Place with a 5 star staff”
<Content>My wife and I decided to stay at La Tortuga during our recent trip to Playa del Carmen on Sept 15 - Sept 20. We selected La Tortuga based on the the reviews on Trip Advisor, and in part the desire to stay somewhere different versuses the large all inclusive resort that are in the area. Let us say that if you are looking for a 5 star resort and all of the modern high end finishes, with the high end price, this is not the place for you. What makes this hotel special and a 5 star hotel is the staff of both the hotel and the El Bistro, they took care of all of our requests and needs. They all remembered us by name and always went out of their way to speak to us no matter how busy they were, we feel we truely have made some friends in Mexico and look forward to seeing them all again. Before I finish my review, I would like to give a special thanks to Mickey, and the guys at El Bristro. They had excellent recommendations and all the food, especially the eggs ranchreo and mayan eggs were great. Send me the recipes. And thanks for ,whipping up a to go breakfast for our early tour. And to the 2 youngs ladies who worked in the lobby/front desk thanks for your help and recommendatons and to Alfredo who went out of his way to assist us and talk with us everyday...again thanks to all of you for making our stay with you so wonderful. As for the the hotel and rooms, we loved the layout and finishes of the jr suites, and if you can afford it, I would suggest getting them versuses the standard room. The private balcony and terrace are well worth the little bit of extra money they charge for these rooms. The bathrooms were well done with very nice tile finishes. Our room was on the corner facing the corner of 10th ave and 14th North, we did not experience any problem with the street noise that some other people had mentioned in their reviews. The pool area and inner courtyard, are just beautiful, the pool is a little cool, in places because of the shade in the courtyard, but after being the sun or Tulum all day it felt good to jump in and cool off before heading to the room. They have 2 beach clubs, we tried both, and neither is that far of a walk, about 10 minutes at most, but I would recommend Mamitas over the other, better beach and area to swim and enjoy ocean, the service is better also and food was very good as well plus they do not charge you for the umbella and chairs. One tip, don't give tips to your waiter, as they will want you to tip when you pay your tab. Also good job Ernesto and Alberto. All I can say is that we love it and would return, the location is great and convienient to 5th Ave, where we found some very good food on 5th Ave and just off 5th Ave, which is better in most cases and far less costly than what we would have spent to stay in a all inclusive.

<Content>This was our first venture outside of an all inclusive and we were not disappointed. The quaintness of this place is very calming. The people are incredibly nice and very good at reading what you may or may not be in the mood for. If being left alone is your forte then they will do so as well if you are wanting to be socially engaged. Grounds immaculate, rooms very clean, modern, and cozy. Location incredibly close and convenient to everything. Would stay here again in a heartbeat

<Title>“Great place!”
<Content>My bf and I arrived at La Tortuga on Sept 3rd and stayed til Sept 7th. We arrived early and our room was ready! =). The room was small but very pretty. It definitely felt like a boutique hotel with some modern touches. It was very clean. The bed/sheets were not very comfortable but that was what I expected for the price we paid. We weren't there most of the time so that was what we wanted. Breakfast was included (from the menu, at El Bistro) every day and they were delicious. The servers were very nice, welcoming and accommodating. One day, we had an early tour planned and asked the front desk if they could have breakfast ready for us to go by 7 am (which was when the restaurant opened for breakfast). She said no which was surprising to me because I had read reviews that said that they did do that for several people staying there. She really didn't seem very friendly but everyone else was very nice. Our tour ended up being pushed back a little so we were able to get down there at 7 and ask for to go breakfasts to be ready by 7:20. We had dinner there once and it was also good. They had this green sauce that I wanted to bring back with me! The pool area was gorgeous and very jungle-like. All of the pools were very shallow though. They were perfect temperature. Overall the location of the hotel was perfect! Right in the middle of everything but not noisy from the room at all. The beaches in Playa were beautiful and very blue. We got tickets to Mamitas beach club and it was pretty crowded but very pretty. I would return! (I also left a ring in my room and they found it, but I'm waiting to hear back about how to get it back).

<Content>Had an amazing time here, stayed for our honeymoon as part of a tour of Mexico. Luxury boutique hotel, they really spoilt us. Very helpful and professional staff, bedroom and bathroom impeccable. Very good breakfast. They even brought me a cake and some sparkling white wine when they discovered it was my birthday during our stay! Bar staff were very friendly and helpful, the best I have ever come across. The hotel design is very unique and cleverly thought out, with the pool being neatly intergrated with the rest of the courtyard garden. Gives it a luxurious / spa / oasis type feel. We were really sad to leave and can't wait to return. Amazing place to relax and unwind.

<Title>“Perfect for couples”
<Content>We chose La Tortuga from a recommendation we received from some friends along with the exceptional reviews we saw on TA. To be honest, I didn't expect the hotel to meet my expectations, but in actuality, it exceeded them. For the great location, exceptional value, and perfect service, I think this is the best hotel in Playa and will never stay anywhere else. I'll try to speak to a few our main criteria below: Cleanliness - The hotel was as clean as we could have imagined. For a predominantly "outdoor" hotel with the open air hallways, restaurant, and pool, it was very clean. Maybe it was just the humidity, but we always felt like the dirty ones, not the hotel. The rooms were a great combination of modern updates with some Mexican flare. The air conditioner is unbelievable. We felt like we were walking into an ice box every night when we stepped in. (Great for me, not for Megan): Upgraded bathrooms were very comfortable. Bed is comfy too. Service - The waiters in the restaurant were great. They seemed to enjoy getting to know us throughout the week. They grew to know our tenancies (lattes and machaca). The front desk (Carlos especially) is so great. They will go to any lengths to help you out. One day we needed to break a $20 USD for an excursion to Coba. They don't really do any business with cash at the desk so they didn't have any. But, Carlos, without us even asking, ran across the street to some buddy I would assume and borrowed the money to make our change. His dedication to the clients was as good of service as we could have wished for and more. Beach - La Tortuga residences are allowed to visit both Sensi and Mamitas Beach. Mamitas is far and away the superior beach. They give you a pass for 2 beach chairs and an umbrella but you have to get down there before noon to secure chairs relatively close to the water. Location - Perfectly located a block from 5th street for a quick walk for food, shopping, beach, or just a stroll to people watch. Yet, far enough away so that you don't hear any of the loud evenings from the nigh clubs or bars. Food - The breakfast is great and free everyday. We recommend the lattes and machaca plate. You also get 25% a dinner which already has much better prices than anything comparable to 5th street. Also, across the street is "Tacos Orientales del Caribe" which were the best pastor tacos we had all week (and for 10 pesos per taco, they were a hit). Bummer about that place is they don't serve any beer, strictly food. Still excellent though.

<Content>From the outside, La Tortuga is an unassuming property, albeit centrally located in Playa. Inside is a patio with a meandering river of pools set amid a lush garden of flowers and trees. Our room was a cool retreat from the August sun, with a comfortable bed and well-appointed bathroom. Everything was perfectly cleaned daily, and creature made of towels was left to stand guard. Every hotel employee was unflaggingly attentive and helpful, even to helping us improve our Spanish. The hotel restaurant, the Bistro, is one of the top ten dining establishments in the city, and an excellent breakfast was included with the room. This hotel would be my first choice for a return visit to Playa del Carmen.

<Title>“Lovely Boutique Hotel - Amazing Included Breakfast”
<Content>We stayed here to celebrate my birthday, and what a celebration it was! We arrived to welcome drinks and fun birthday decorations in the room. We had reserved a room overlooking the pool ... highly recommend this! The foliage is so lush and extensive, you feel like you're in the jungle. And sitting on your balcony watching the colorful birds is an added bonus. This hotel is all about the details: the included breakfast was delish (as other reviewers have said, get the chilaquiles!!!) the happy hour at the bar is awesome, and even the in-room mini bar had reasonable prices. And I won't even go into what they did for my birthday ... it was beyond over the top! Let me just say, if you are staying there for a special occasion, celebrate at their restaurant. Not only will you have a delicious meal, but also spectacular fun and service. Hotel manager Jose is a gem! The hotel has arrangements with two beach clubs, I would recommend Sensi. Especially at night! AMAZING!! Mamitas we found to be loud and tacky. Overall, I can't think of a single thing to pick it. La Tortuga was perfect!! OH ... arrange your airport transfer with them. It was the best deal I found.

<Title>“La Tortuga Hotel”
<Content>La Tortuga Hotel was very beautiful once you walked onto the hotel grounds. Like an oasis amidst restaurants, shops, and the busy streets of P.D.C. We had a junior suite, which was very nice, great towel decorations by the maid daily, great size jacuzzi, and great view from our private balcony. My parents upgraded us with ease, two days before we arrived AWESOME, and without us knowing I might add, they bought a bottle of champagne, roses on bed, sign to say happy honeymoon, great touches by staff. The staff at the restaurants were "VERY IMPRESSIVE" they went above and beyond, and we always gave them a daily tip, with the included delicious breakfast, huge fresh juice, and coffee! One of the restaurant staff members even had our morning breakfast ready to go, when we had a very early morning excursion right at 7 A.M. on the dot.The front desk staff was equally helpful and gracious about giving advice on costs to places, locations of atms, and referring us to great night spots. Bring mosquito repellent to P.D.C. wear it Everywhere daily, many mosquitos because of the vegetation. I was disappointed that on several occasions our room was still being serviced into the late afternoon, when we had been gone all day, and had put the cleaning sign out. Oh well, we waited by the pool, which was great. I was also disappointed in an evening event that my dad planned with the hotel on the solarium. He originally told me he had wanted us to have a private dinner on the beach, but the hotel could not accommodate this so their solarium was exaggerated to be very romantic. The solarium I imagine is a great place to tan during the day, but at night it was not air conditioned, no fans, had the ice machine situated on it, and was not "romantic" but very hot. The waiters were great that evening, did a great desert presentation with fire, but I would have preferred just dining in the restaurant downstairs with the fans on. I would definitely stay here again most of the staff was great, many Europeans and young couples in their 30's-pro,loved the no child policy, though I have a child myself.

<Title>“Stunning boutique hotel”
<Content>Absolutely stunning boutique hotel with character, intimate, gorgeous pool, attentive service, good location, and lovely restaurant overlooking the pool. Excellent value for money in Playa. Only downside is that the toilets block easily but plumbing is a problem in Playa generally. Would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Title>“When service CAN make a difference!”
<Content>Just came back from Playa del Carmen and I feel obligated to write a review about Hotel La Tortuga... What a superb service! The staff is excellent! Specially Yanina and Carlos, super polite and friendly!!! Congratulations!!! Now about the room... Yes it was ok but really we did not spend too much time there, between the tours; Coba, Xel-Ha, Xcaret, Tulum and walking around Playa del Carmen, we were not there from morning till late night. We got a room facing the street and we were not bothered by the noise; not coco bongo, not traffic. The furniture was a bit old and tired but ok, the bathroom a bit small. Free wi-fi in the room, the breakfast is awesome!!!! Visit Playa and..... Viva Mexico!!!

<Title>“A beautiful place for a honeymoon”
<Content>My bride and I stayed at La Tortuga for our Honeymoon. I chose this place from all the reviews and it was like walking into an oasis. The enitre staff was wonderful. The restaurant was fantastic. It was great to have breakfast every morning, and we even had dinner there a couple of times...including one time up on the deck for a private dinner and the staff had rose petals everywhere and candles. Very romantic. The rib eye was amazing! The bartending staff was top notch, they even went to the point where when we would come home from the beach, they would bring the drinks to our room. We loved the pool, which isn't really designed for swimming, but just for lounging around and sitting in. We had a great stay in our large room with a spa in it. It was fun to see what towel creature would be created for us each day. Going to the beach was a very easy walk, and using the beach clubs was very nice. Also, the hotel is right around the corner from the main street, so walking around at night was fun to hit the bars, dance clubs, and shops. ! Just make sure you have your mosquito spray on! Last thing..we did pay to have private transportation back and forth from the airport in Can cun. Well worth it!

<Title>“A romantic getaway in the middle of it all”
<Content>We spent a few days at La Tortuga before getting married in Cozumel and besides for the wedding itself our stay was the highlight of our trip. The staff was amazing as well as the accomodations. It was like an oasis in the middle of a busy city with so much to do and see. We stayed in one of the superior junior suites with a jacuzzi on a private patio. The private patio was excellent and perfect for sipping champagne and relaxing. We also recommend seeing the ruins of Tulum. We hopped a shuttle to get there, and the ruins themselves are worth seeing but plan on staying to hang out on the beach as well as it is beautiful. This was our first trip to Playa Del Carmen and we very much look forward to going back and staying at La Tortuga.

<Title>“Outstanding in every way!”
<Content>To stay at La Tortuga is a vacation in and of it’s self. The experience begins the moment you enter the front door. We were greeted by Jenina as though we were long lost friends. Our room was decorated for my birthday with balloons and flowers and a bottle of Mexican sparkling wine. Which was quote a surprise. The pool is a tranquil romantic place right next to the bar and restaurant. The service, not just the front house was exceptional. And the breakfast… oh my gosh, was it ever good. We highly recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Loved La Tortuga... can't say a bad thing about this place!”
<Content>I came to Playa Del Carmen por mi desperida de soltera (Bachelorette party.) My girlfriends and I had the best time. It is right off 5th street so you can walk everywhere and never have to worry about taking a cab. We were four girls traveling by ourselves and felt completely safe. Mamitas their sister beach club was great, a bit of a walk, but not too bad. We got our ejercicio! Always someone at the door to greet you and the Bistro that is attached has great food. The service was spectacular. I will definitley be planning another trip to Playa and staying at La Tortuga.

<Title>“Wonderful Respite in Playa Del Carmen”
<Content>This was my second stay at La Tortuga, the first time was with my spouse, and last time with my 18 year old daughter. (No children under 18, which makes it very tranquil.) As we do not favor the hustle and bustle of Cancun, Play del Carmen is a small town treat. Even though, it can be quite busy on 5th Avenue. Shopping, bars and restaurants are lots of fun. This hotel is not on the beach, but provides an in-town oasis, within short walking distance of all to do. You feel as if in another world when you enter the gates. The grounds and pool are stunningly beautiful, especially for night swimming. The rooms are first class, even though a bit small. We always plan two stops for our Mayan Riviera vacations, one in town, and then on to secluded beach resorts further south. We highly recommend this hotel, and it's "outdoor restaurant", El Bistro - great food and service.

<Title>“Fab hotel, very friendly and helpful”
<Content>We stayed at la tortuga and sister hotel cabanas tulum in June and had an excellent time, one of our best holidays and we would love to come back to Mexico. Location of la tortuga was perfect, just around corner from the main shopping street and close to beach. We had a bit of rain first few days but there was plenty to do. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful both while we were there and before when we were organising our trip, they always answered emails promptly. Hotel itself feels very intimate and peaceful escape from bustle of the main street. It was low season when we were there so restaurants and bars were relatively quiet but in high season it would be very lively. Couldn't fault our stay!

<Title>“Nice hotel but had a few issues”
<Content>We stayed here for 4 nights from July 16-20th. Overall, our stay was very good. The staff are all very friendly and sweet. When you arrive, they'll greet you with a tropical cocktail. The grounds are amazing! It literally feels like you're in a tropical oasis, secluded from the rest of the world. The location is awesome as well. It's only a few blocks from 5th ave with all the restaurants and shops and just a few more blocks (or a short cab ride) to the beach. We had access to beach chairs and an umbrella at Mamita's for free. The hotel also had a deal with Zenzi but you had to spend a minimum amount. Breakfast at El Bistro (their restaurant) was SO delicious. Definitely get their Mexican dishes - they are soo incredibly tasty. You also have a choice of coffee and juice - both of which were also very good. We had dinner one night as well at the restaurant (they gave us a 25% coupon off our first dinner, as well as a free cocktail coupon) and they were really accommodating to us as we're vegetarian. Happy hour is everyday from 5-7pm and they offer 2 for 1 drinks which are really good!! Try the jalapeño margarita :) Unfortunately, we did have a few issues with the hotel. Our first room (standard) would flood every time one of us showered. So our bathroom would be full of water and it would obviously seep into the bedroom. After complaining our 1st morning and again in the evening, they upgraded us to standard plus which was very nice. The room was more spacious and had a balcony. However, once we arrived at the new room, the AC kept making a loud ringing noise. The mechanic did come right away to fix it - although it was only temporary. He had to come one last time to fix it and after that, it worked fine. So - these things were definitely an annoyance and I sort of wondered how they have a #4 rating but I don't think it would deter me from coming back. However, next time, I would definitely choose a more luxurious room :)

<Title>“The hotel is in an excellent location.”
<Content>This boutique hotel is an excellent place to relax, right in the center of Playa del Carmen. It's located two blocks from the beach and one block from 5th Avenue, the main street for shopping, restaurants and bars. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly and helpful, at all times. We took a room just a few steps from our own pool. Would definitely return to the same hotel. Can't wait to return.

<Title>“I absolutely love this hotel!”
<Content>I visited La Tortuga from July 20-24, 2011. I cannot say enough about the beauty of this hotel and the outstanding service I experienced during my stay. From the street, you would never expect the oasis that is behind the walls of this hotel. The location is perfect if you are a person that likes to be in the middle of the action. 5th Avenue, which is a pedestrian only street lined with shops and restaurants, is a block away. The beautiful beach is two blocks away. Towels and passes for Zenzi beach are provided in the lobby for the beach. Once on Zenzi beach, you are required to spend at least $20 (pesos). The grounds of La Tortuga are beautiful and look like the pictures on their website. The pool area has chaises and chairs...plenty of space to lay out and tan. The vegetation is lovely providing a bit of shade and creating a peaceful ambiance. The bar is close to the pool as is a pool table. Happy hour offers two for one drinks! The restaurant can be accessed from this area as well. I stayed in a standard plus room (#207). There is an exterior door that leads to the balcony. The balcony has a table with two chairs and overlooks the pool area. My room had a king sized bed, two night stands, a ceiling fan, ac, luggage stand, tv, safe and closet/shelving. The bathroom had a stall shower. The sink was beautiful yet functional. Glasses, plastic cups, facial tissue and cotton balls were provided. The bathroom also has a window that opens to the room's balcony which was great for ventilation (you don't need any extra humidity.) The bed was very comfortable and if you forgot a book, there are plenty on the bookshelves in the room. The mini fridge is stocked with beer, soda and water. Though the room is not a large space, it was quite comfortable. The restaurant was fabulous as was the staff. Breakfast was great and served from early (sorry about the time- I never got there early) until noon. Gloria (front desk),Alfredo and Esteban were the best! I couldn't have asked for a more inviting hotel, better food or a more perfect location. I am checking flights to Cancun as soon as I finish this review...I can't wait to return.

<Title>“We Love La Tortuga!! Even better than the last visit, looking forward to the next one!”
<Content>This was our 2nd visit to La Tortuga in 2 years & it's even better than I remember. As always the location is central & perfect for wanting to hop the bus or collectivo to neighboring places like Akumal, Xcaret, Tulum & XelHa or any of the numerous cenotes in the area. Or you can walk 2 blocks to the beaches of Playa Del Carmen and 1 block to 5th. The included breakfast is still amazing & dining at El Bristro for dinner is not only delicious, but romantic as well. The daily happy hour is great - try the mango mojitos! La Tortuga truly is an oasis in the middle of a bustling city, you would never know it - it's so serene and relaxing. The staff was wonderful & very accommodating. I always felt like I was coming home after a day/night out and not really coming back to a hotel. We love it so much here, we have already booked a 2nd visit this year, our 3rd overall. I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed. Thank you to Anna, Fidel, Claudia, Carlos & Alfredo for all of their help and kindness. We are looking forward to seeing you all again soon!

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel with Fantastic Staff!”
<Content>I stayed at La Tortuga for 7 nights during July with my Mum and loved every second of it. I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Playa del Carmen in a heartbeat. The staff looks after you from the moment you walk through the door. Our room was exactly what we asked for and we had a great view overlooking their lovely cenote shaped pool. The hotel was extremely peaceful and quiet for how central it is. It's a wonderful little retreat in the middle of Playa and you feel at home very quickly. You can be in the middle of the shops and restaurants in about a thirty second walk too. Great location! The bistro restaurant is really good and the breakfast is outstanding! Waking up, wandering down through the garden and pool to have mango juice and the best coffee ever and choosing yet another delicious breakfast was a great way to start each day! I happened to have a birthday while I was there and when we got back out room was full of balloons and flowers! Such a thoughtful touch! The rooms are very clean and the beds are incredibly comfortable. All in all the staff is what makes this place.. after a couple days everyone here you will be on a first name basis with the whole staff. We had the same waiter, front desk employee, bartender, etc everyday. They make a huge effort to get to know you and are always happy to give you tips and advice on where to go and what to do. I can't wait to go back to La Tortuga!

<Title>“Loved it and already booked a return trip!”
<Content>My husband and I went to La Tortuga in March for his birthday. We normally go all inclusive and we did spend a few days at Secrets Maroma as well. (Fantastic!) However the service from the staff was impeccable! The food was absolutely amazing! You must order the Mayan Coffee for the show of it! Anna was extremely helpful in every way from before we got there to our arrival and departure and has made rebooking for Sept such a breeze! The location is perfect for some sightseeing, shopping, partying and relaxing on the beach although you certainly do not have to leave to get the relaxing and partying that you want. The room we stayed in and have rebooked was the jr suite with balcony and rooftop hot tub. The whole experience there has completely changed our way of thinking when it comes to non AI, in a great way! Cannot wait to get back! The only (if you can call it a downside) is the room itself is a little small. Not really an issue though. Everything there completely makes up for a smaller room. Plus we spend most of our time when we were in our room either on the balcony or roof top. You will not be disappointed with La Tortuga!

<Title>“Amazing place!”
<Content>We just came back from a 5 night stay last week at La Tortuga. Though I had reserved our stay based on great reviews and pictures I'd seen here, our expectations were still exceeded by far. From the moment we walked in we were treated so warmly by all the staff and it was like walking into an oasis the place was so beautiful. Though we are gay and shared a King bed, the staff all treated us like they would have anyone else. Everyone that works here is very warm and friendly, and clearly is happy to work there and it shows in how they treat you. Our room was in the 3rd floor and the most basic, yet was very comfortable with nearly all the amenities you could want in a room. Our only complaint was that there is no free drinking water, unlike other hotels in Mexico we've stayed at that provide a water dispenser. Everything in the room worked, the AC was very efficient, and the shower water pressure was excellent and we always had hot water instantly (both of these can be a problem in Mexico). The bed was also very comfortable, not too hard or soft which is a great compromise for one of us who is a back sleeper and the other a stomach sleeper. The included breakfast is fabulous, please do yourself a favor and venture from the eggs and bacon or pancakes to the Mexican specialties which are so much tastier. We did that every morning and everything was good. One tip- they don't say that on their menu, but their chicken enchiladas can be doused in mole sauce. If you order them, make sure to get them with mole because they are far better than in plain tomato sauce which you'll get if you don't ask for it. We compared. Also a highlight was the Machaca, which is a northern Mexican breakfast specialty of shredded dried steak and onions in scrambled eggs; it was especially delicious with the fresh tortillas it's served with. In the afternoons, we always made it a point to stop by the bar for happy hour before heading out. We had Fidel serve us every time, such a great friendly guy who was always happy to share tips about the area and who's cocktail suggestions (and preparation, of course) were always on point. One evening we also ate at the restaurant on premise, El Bistro. You get a 25% off discount the first time you dine here if you're staying at the hotel, which made a dinner here a great value. We spent $34 USD (without tip) for the two of us for a shared appetizer, two entrees and two cappuccinos. They did not charge us corkage for the bottle we had brought with us from the US, though we asked in advance. The grounds were very well taken care of, the place is beautifully designed and appointed and it all feels much more intimate than it would seem for 51 rooms. Finally, the location could hardly be better. It's so close to the heart of 5th avenue yet feels so far removed. The staff was very helpful in answering every question we had and made some good recommendations to ensure we got around the place very easily and efficiently. The even sent us a personalized note after we stayed, remembering some minor details that most people would have forgotten and thanking us for our stay! We will definitely come back to this hotel if we go back to Playa, I can't imagine a better place to stay.

<Title>“Awesome location and friendly staff”
<Content>We found the proximity to 5th ave. (heart of playa) and the beach to be the biggest benefit of staying at La Tortuga. Staff is super friendly and very eager to offer suggestions for restaurants, shopping, activities, good beach spots, etc. The hotel front desk staff arranged our chichen itza tour, our pick up to the cancun airport and even our cozumel snorkling outing (I recommend going with the hotel suggestions for tours, seems like they're prices are better than what I researched online). Hotel stay includes a delicious complimentary breakfast. I found the small outdoor bar near the pool very convenient and drink prices very reasonable (the margaritas w/ Don Julio Añejo tequila are incredible). Hotel is on busy 10 ave so expect some noise all hours of the night. Didn't really bother me, but just be aware.

<Content>I was looking for an good option to rest with my family and I must say that I found the best of the best...Although it´s not a hotel from the most important brands in the world, without doubt is much better than a lot of them...His environment allows you to relax and feel comfortable, has a very good room service and also good services in the Bistro restaurant (also a varied menu) and in the bar near the pool.... There you can order a drinking, enjoy it in a very beautiful pool and gather good moments with different foreign people, under a well environment...And is only one block from the fifth Avenue and two blocks from the beach!! I reccomend it 100% as one of the best options in Playa del Carmen and surely I will want to be back soon with my family!!!

<Title>“Love love love La Tortuga!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at La Tortuga and when we return to Playa del Carmen, we will most definitely be staying there again. The staff was incredibly friendly, the free breakfast was delicious, and the bar drinks were excellent. My only complaint is that our room faced 10 Ave, which becomes quite noisy at night. But, if you can sleep through bustling cars and tourists, then it's no problem. The hotel staff was really helpful and the tours they offer were consistently cheaper than anything we found on the street. I'm only bummed that they do not allow children (well, not bummed when I left my child at home, but bummed for when we return with her and cannot stay at La Tortuga).

<Title>“Great hotel, would recommend!”
<Content>I stayed at La Tortuga with my friends and had a brilliant time. I actually surprised my two friends who were already at the hotel. I had to inform the hotel I would be staying there but they kept my secret for me, and everyone on the front desk knew not to tell my friends when they arrived that I would be joining them. The food in the restaurant was fantastic. The pool and rooms were very clean, and hotel staff very friendly and helpful. The pool setting was amazing, sun loungers comfortable and we even got a free 10 minute pool-side massage. The beach is 10 mins away and shops, bars and restaurants steps away! Even though its not a beach-front hotel, when you're inside you can't see or hear the traffic and outside world, its a tranquil hideaway! I'm not sure the hotel would suit young children but perfect for friends and couples!

<Title>“I can't say enough about La Tortuga Hotel”
<Content>I have travelled much in my years and this hotel La Tortuga is right up there in the best. I always express my feelings whether good or bad. The hotel is located a block from 5th street which is nice to stroll and 3 blocks from the beach. I heard music playing in the side street only 1 night but enjoyed as it was music from my day. It stopped at 12pm so this was okay. The rest of the nights very quite and did not hear anything even though the hotel is a block from 5th street. Also if you like a quite place in the hotel or around the pool only children 16 years and older can stay at the hotel. Love kids but I never got splashed in the pool. They have an inner courtyard which is lush in plants and flowers and a meandering pool throughout. At night it is very beautiful with all the lights and candles they lite. We stayed for 2 /12 weeks and I worried with this much time in the same hotel may end up being tiresome but not at all. The restaurant without a lie has the best quality food here and we tried most on the menu and was never disappointed. I know their is some comments in regards to the beds but found the bed very soft and my finance loved the mattress and slept and slept and slept. The staff is amazing and there to assist in anyway possible. Eduardo never stops working and he starts at 7am and most nights does not finish to 11pm. Carlos in reception is so informative about suggesting tours and places to eat that are off the beaten path and in my opinion the quality of food is better as well the prices. The staff is always smiling which I guess reflects the management of the hotel. I am not normally a smiler so this is probably why I noticed. You must try the Titi italian restaurant. I did not find the restaurants on 5th Avenue to be that great and food and drink very expensive. A diet coke was $3.00 on average. 5th Avenue was nice to walk but gets old quick as your constantly harassed by the staff at the stores while walking down the street. Some even follow you for a ways still talking. If you have thick skin then not a problem. Back to the Hotel it is amazingly clean and you do not notice the cleaning staff. Everything is very late back no one asking you to do water aerobics or swigging bear. They have a little bar by the pool and happy hour is between 1pm and 2pm and 5pm to 7pm. I don't drink but seemed popular with guests. If your going to drink water or have soda their is an OXXO down the street as the price for this is quite expensive whether in the room or restaurant. Not sure why a coke costs so much but expensive what ever restaurant you go to. Pool temperature was warm and not difficult to enter but I would think cold in the winter months. They do have a hot tub. Rooms are air-conditioned and can be controlled by yourself to a temperature that suits your needs. Room service wow, seriously you just hang up the phone and there at your door knocking. Well I think I have said more than enough but if your looking for a beautiful, clean, quiet, great staff, restaurant, pool this is definitely the place for you in Playa del Carmen. I will definitely return.

<Title>“Perfection in Playa”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon in April 2011. Parking is not included but there is a parking station around the corner which is fairly inexpensive and will keep your car safe. Check in was seamless and included a welcome drink which was a nice touch, as were the towel animals with rose petals on our bed every morning. The staff were friendly and helpful when we locked ourselves out (tip: the key only unlocks the room, not the gate to the room’s patio so don’t lock the gate). The room was a little small but the communal pool/bar/restaurant area was beautiful, particularly at night when it’s lit up with fairy lights. It is very well designed, with easy access to the pool, restaurant, bar, spa and rooms, and lots of shade during the daytime. Staff worked throughout the day to sweep poolside and remove any debris that had fallen into the water. We spent most of the day poolside, reading magazines (there is a basket of them next to the couch area), relaxing in the water and having massages at the spa. On the second night we found a little rooftop lounge area and we had some great conversations lying on the lounges and looking up at the stars. A la carte breakfast is included but the food was a bit hit and miss. One morning the food was great and another morning it wasn’t so good (probably a poor choice on my part) so ask the waiter what they recommend. We also had a dinner one night at the restaurant. The dinner menu was excellent (although not Mexican) and the waitress cooked our crepes suzette dessert at our table in a very entertaining fashion. The only thing I didn’t like was that a large group of guests had set up next to the restaurant and had a stereo playing loud music while we had dinner. It was probably great for them but not so much for us. When we asked the staff if they could turn the music down, they obliged but it was still quite loud. Also, the staff were a little pushy when we checked out, asking us if we would make sure to give them a good review on TripAdvisor and then sending us a follow up email to remind us to post our review. Personally, I didn’t like Playa del Carmen much – too touristy and Americanised – but I didn’t feel the need to leave the hotel as it was such an intimate, welcoming environment. When I did venture out, the beach, shops and restaurants were all within walking distance – but it wasn’t long before I was back lazing by the pool.

<Title>“Arriba la Tortuga”
<Content>My wife and I spend our honeymoon at Hotel La Tortuga and we loved it. The Service is great. The staff is very friendly and always helpful. Carlos and Janina from reception were always smiling and very knowledgeable about tours, restaurants,etc.. They were both very professional and competent. The inclusive breakfast is delicious. The menu provides a good variety of traditional Mexican breakfast as well as fresh fruits, juices, shakes , great pico de gallo and coffe. You cannot beat this breakfast. Dinning at the Bistro was also great. On our last night they prepare a special romantic table for ous and the food was amazing. We really recommend the Ceviches. The Hotel is located next to the very interesting 5th Avenue where restaurants , shops and night clubs are, but far enough to have a quiet relaxing day. The Beach club Mamitas is a great location, a bit far from the Hotel. The Staff is not as friendly as the Tortuga staff and they close very early (5:30 pm). We also spend a couple of days and one night at Cabanas Tulum which is also from La Tortuga and would really recommend it for a romantic getaway. Jose May did a great job making our stay very pleasant. Since we arrived he prepared a couple of Coco locos which he knew we enjoyed and a special breakfast table. The staff made an entertaining Margarita night where Jose May explain about Tequilas and how to prepare the delicious Mexican Drink. They also made a fun Coco Loco presentation and a Ceviche one. They were both great and fun. It was a great way to make the guest welcome and to get to know each other. We really enjoyed it. Chef Miguel Hidalgo made a great Ceviche and was very nice providing some of his own cooking recipes. Muchas Gracias Benjamin Fernadez(Hotel Manager), Jose May (Food and Beverage), Carlos and Janina(Reception) , Esteban, Jose and all the staff from Restaurant El Bistro as well as the Sebrina (Cleaning Lady). Gracias a todos por el excelenteservicio. Esperemos poder regresar pronto.

<Title>“Actually Better Than These Reviews”
<Content>I have to admit that I was still skeptical after reading all these great reviews. In Mexico, you just never know what you're going to get until you arrive. My wife and I just spent a week at La Tortuga and it was dreamy. This was our first vacation in 12 years without our children and La Tortuga made it worth the wait. I won't name all the staff members, but every one of them greeted us with a smile with every encounter and went above and beyond to be sure all our needs were met. The rooms, pool, and common areas were spotless as the staff worked diligently all day. For my wife's birthday, they decorated our room, left a bottle of champagne, and arranged a special private dinner at El Bistro...and asked for NOTHING in return. The jungle-like setting around the pool made us feel like we always had the place all to ourselves. The full breakfast and service every morning at El Bistro was excellent. If you are not the all-inclusive type, like us, and need a break from the kids, like us, you will fall in love with this place. If you consider staying here and decided to stay somewhere else, consider yourself a fool...this place is positively a slam-dunk! Tips - you can walk everywhere you need to go in Playa, but when you explore the coast skip the taxis and use the ADO bus line. Beautiful, comfortable A/C buses that will take you from Tulum to Cancun for less than $5. The central station is only 2 blocks from La Tortuga. We highly recommend going to Puerto Morelos and snorkeling with the fisherman's cooperative...$25 per person for a 2-hour guided snorkel at 2 locations...incredible coral gardens and fauna...some of the best, and cheapest, snorkeling I've ever done. Eat lunch at La Playita afterwards. Also, the Jungle Spa (not anything like a resort spa!) in Puerto Morelos is an experience of a lifetime. 90 minute massage from local Mayan women for $60...you will not find any marble showers or mineral baths here!

<Title>“Best hotel ever! Loved it!”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga in 14 days, and we loved every second of it. The staff were so friendly, the atmosphere in the lobby and pool area was so chill. Fidel (our bartender) was always there with a smile, and we met many new friends from all over the world. We had some rainy days, but it didn't matter, because we could just hang out in the hotel, play some pool, take some drinks in the bar or just hang out in the jacuzzi. The maid always did a great job cleaning our room, and even made us new towel-figures every day- incredible what you can make with just towels ;) The breakfast was included in our stay, and it was in the El Bistro restaurant, great food! We were going out on the 5.avenue to eat dinner at evening, but none of the restaurant could compare to the food at El Bistro, perfect- and very nice waitors. We really had a great stay, and would recommend it to everyone going to Playa del Carmen.

<Title>“Quiet and nice”
<Content>You will not find a better location in all of Playa. Customer service is excellent. We stayed in the room with the private pool and found it to be better than we expected. The facilities are well maintained and clean. The service at El Bistro is great and the food is good. Did not try dinner, but the breakfast was good. The only issue we encountered were the bed sheets. They were comically stiff and sand papery. There was no option to just change out towels. The options were clean or no clean, nothing in between. Please don't let this put this off the hotel, its great! Just ask for a little less starch if you have sensitive skin.

We attended the party referred to in another review & agree the hotel/staff did an outstanding job. Loved our room (207) clean, comfotable & quiet. If you want a smaller, quiet property just a short walk to everything this is the place to stay. Denise & Greg Dunbar Key West

<Title>“Wow, the best hotel!!!”
<Content>Before travelling to Mexico, I almost couldn't believe all the positive reviews about this hotel. But after having stayed there for 12 nights I can only say: book this hotel and you won't be sorry. First of all the staff is very friendly and willing to help you in any way they can. They give your stay that extra bit of service and a good feeling. They really make you feel at home. The location is perfect, in the centre of Playa del Carmen, so just off 5th Ave but not close to all the noise. I think I only heard people outside once and went straight back to sleep again. The hotel feels very secluded and gives you a great and cosy feeling. The rooms are perfect, I went with a friend and we requested 2 twin beds and had the best room with both our owm floors! The bathroom is nice and rather big and provides you with all you could need. The services are fantastic. Clean towels each day, beach towels is you want, GREAT food (really tasty!!!), free WiFi and a computer for you to use, happy hour, sunbeds in the sun and in the shade. Plus the nice layout and very enjoyable pool! So if you have th opportunity and you are thinking about chosing this hotel I would do it ion a heartbeat, you will not regret it.

<Title>“First time in Mexico”
<Content>My girlfriend and I were looking to go somewhere that was not "all inclusive" so we didn't waste the cost of the hotel on food and drink that were were not going to use fully. Our plans included a lot of relaxing followed with some trips and excursions during out 1 week stay. La Tortuga fit our needs perfectly as we had a wonderful place to start off our day with a real breakfast from their restaurant, but did not feel compelled to return from our trips to eat there every meal. Great service and information was provided for any questions we had. No one under the age of 16 is allowed at the hotel (huge plus for us). Very nice and quite retreat from the busier 5th ave. Day One: Dinner at the beach Day Two: Mammitas Beach and Shopping on 5th, dinner at La Parilla Day Three: Ferey to Cozumel, rented scooter drove around the island and stopped at different beaches along the way, dinner at El Bistro Day Four: Walked far down the beach (south) to a less crowded beach, dinner Day Five: Xel-ha snorkel eco-park(AMAZING) I would suggest Not doing the Tulum and Xel-ha package b/c there is plunty to keep you busy from 10am to 530pm just at Xel-ha. Hay Six: Took bus down to Tulum walking the ruin for a couple of hrs and swimming at the beach just below the ruins for a while Day Seven: Returned Home Had a couple other things that we wanted to do while we are down there but decided to keep it relaxed and not try to push ourselves to much. It was such a wonderful place I figured we would be going back and would have another change at Chcichen Itza and some other park activities. I would suggest to anyone staying at La Tortuga to only travel down 5th half of the time you are walking around b/c the constant hollering and selling gets a little annoying after a couple of days. Also if you are there on a thursday there seems to be an "art hop" that is set up in the street (on 5th) on the half north of La Tortuga. that was nice. Over all Great time and will definitely be staying at La Tortuga on our next trip to the Yucatan. :)

<Content>I loved this little place. Perfectly situated a block away from 30 block of restaurants, shops and people watching. Dinner every night at a table on the street; food was delicious. The hotel offered a full breakfast every morning. The affordable standard room was very basic, but perfect for those that prefer to venture out anyway. The staff was very hospitable.

<Title>“"Paradise Found "”
<Content>If you’re looking for “paradise found”, this absolutely charming tropical oasis hotel-spa is it. Located 3 blocks from Playa del Carmen’s beautiful pristine beach, and one block from the famed 5th avenue of Playa del Carmen, it has everything. Don’t bother to bring your laptop, they have free Wi-Fi for your iPhone and a computer with a printer available all day by the pool side. The bilingual front desk is very helpful and offered to arrange tours and information to Chichen -Itza, Tolum, Xel-Ha, Akcumal, Cozumel with the Chankanaab Park, and a visit to Cancun, and, I strongly recommend all of them. Across the street is a pharmacy and also OXXO (Mexico’s Seven-Eleven) open all day for anything from cold beer and up. In the hotel, there is gorgeous pool and jacuzzi, with great big fluffy towels. The bar is right there and has a happy hour. The hotel houses the El Bistro Restaurant with what I found was the best place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Tops service, price and high quality cuisine......believe me don’t look any further. Prices can be out of sight in many other restaurants. By the way breakfast is included. I suggest when you check their web site, look at the menu. To make things better they've got their own water front beach club for you. My wife, daughter, and I spent May 20 -26 th there and cannot praise the wonderful place and staff enough. Dr. Michael Ritota

<Title>“Very accomodating!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at La Torgtuga Hotel for the first time for our honeymoon. The staff are very warm and welcoming--they never fail to smile and make you feel at home! They accomodated us in one of their unique boutique rooms in a very delightful way. The day we arrived our bed was filled with red petals, had a wram greeting for our honeymoon, swans of love made out of towels and our jacuzzi was bubbly ready! Initially, we planned to stay for only 6 days but wanted to extend with economized budget. They offered us a different (smaller) room with cheaper price but we kind of fell inlove with our boutique room. Claudia did everything she could for us to keep our honeymoon room with a very affordable price and we ended up staying for 3 more days. My husband and I scuba dive pretty much everyday and to come to our hotel room with different towel animals everyday couldn't be more entertaining! We get our free breakfast at their El Bistro Restaurant and the foods are pretty good and real fresh. And of course, the most friendly staff at El Bistro; Santiago and Micky! Thank you so much for everything guys..We will miss you and for sure we'll come back soon! -Cirha

It's a great boutique hotel that is so peaceful yet very conveniently located to the best beaches and places to eat. Every morning my wife and I had a great breakfast thanks to two amazing employees, Micky and Santiago. Our room was very nice and had plenty of room, even with a jacuzzi tub.

<Content>We stayed here for just one night b/4 going to an AI. It was very deceiving when we first drove up. Once thru the main doors it is unbelievable.. It reminded me of a rain forest with a pool running thru it. Very pretty.. It is a small quiet hotel. There is a bar and resturant off the pool area which was great. We had a standard room and for 1 night was adequate. Rooms were very clean - small but nice. Within a block of 5th Ave. A/C worked fine. If you want to do nothing at all, this is the place for you. It's nice to be able to walk to 5th Ave for dinner.. lot's of good resturants. Would not want to stay more than a few nights because it is so quite..The beach club was approx. 7 blocks away.. we did not go since we were there for just 1 night. We're not into going to the club's so this could get a bit tiresome after a few days. I would return without a question..Felt very safe also..

<Title>“Believe the Reviews!!! Great Hotel, Staff, Location and Rooms!!”
<Content>Just got back from a wonderful stay here! The Reception staff of Yanina and Claudia are truly second to none that I've seen!! We have traveled to Mexico countless times over the years and stayed all over from cruises to all-inclusives and this place merits special praise. Our room was #301 ( jr. suite) very nice with a private roof top jacuzzi. Spacious, extra large shower and large room. Only thing is I would probably request a room overlooking the pool area......not a biggy, but next time. Free breakfast was good and enjoyable, one computer by the bar area was nice to have as well. We used the pool several times and enjoyed it very much. Not sure why some complained it was too cold.....It was about the same temp as the ocean....refreshing!! Yanina set me up with two tours, one to Coba and a cenote for $49 each and one snorkel tour at Cozumel for $25 each ( 3 hours, 3 spots to snorkel ) including beer, water and soft drinks. Great value!!! Finally a Superior location, we walked everywhere!!!

<Title>“A little paradise away from Placar craziness.”
<Content>If you're staying in Playa del Carmen, and want to avoid the massive resort-type places, but don't want to skip out on the nice amenities of one - check out La Tortuga. Located right next to the hustle and bustle of 5th Ave, it's conveniently located to all of the action but offers a very relaxing, quiet sanctuary. We had read reviews about how the lazy pool was too cold to use, but we didn't find that to be the case (and we tend to be sensitive to cold). Several folks were also in the pool throughout the day. The hotel offers really relaxing common spaces around the pool, and the lounge area is great - with couches and seating that allows you to just kick back, read a book, play some pool, or just enjoy a drink next to the lazy river. The food at the restaurant was delicious, as well. The room we had was small, but perfectly sufficient for our needs and tastefully decorated. The bed was comfortable. La Tortuga has some great staff: Yinina at the front desk was welcoming and very helpful. Carlos, working in the reception area, was also very pleasant. And the service at both the bar and restaurant was attentive, polite, and efficient. We didn't use the beach, so I can't comment on that aspect of the services. If you're looking for a comfortable place to relax, and a quiet space away from the Playa craziness - check out La Tortuga.

<Title>“Would Go Back.”
<Content>The hotel La Tortuga is beautiful, the service is excellent, the swimming pool is lovely and very relaxing… you can have a swim, you can get in the Jacuzzi or you can read a book without any noise around. The rooms are really nice and comfortable and the location is ideal… right in the center of everything and 5 minutes walking from the beach. Each room is different and unique with great amenities. The staff are wonderful! The food at the restaurant was great and so was the beach club that you get passes too. Front desk staff was always helpful and friendly. We were preparing to leave the lobby one night for dinner and they offered us a complimentary umbrella, as it was raining. The bar served the best cocktails we had in Playa del Carmen and our bedroom was cleaned immaculately every day.

<Title>“A Romantic Oasis Tucked Into A Bustling Beach Town”
<Content>Driving through the busy town of Playa del Carmen, we spot the sign for La Tortuga Hotel & Spa. It's not quite check-in time, but we decide to see if we can at least have the hotel hold our luggage while we soak up the sun and walk the sugary beaches a few minutes away. As we stand before the double glass doors, a doorman cordially opens the door. "Bienvenidos" he says with a warm smile. The front desk attendant is standing at her desk assisting other guests, but another attendant stands as soon as she sees us enter and assures us they'll be right there to help. In less than two minutes, a server arrives with two glasses of refreshing fruit juice. "For you," he says sweetly. I look past a second set of double glass doors to see an oasis of lush green tropical plants and a I breathe a sigh of relief. We've arrived at La Tortuga and I feel relaxed already. Our front desk attendant checks us in quickly (even though we've arrived a couple of hours before check-in) and a bellman shows us to our room. As we follow the bellman, we exit a busy, bustling town and enter an oasis of calm tranquility and utter peacefulness. Our room is a "swim up" room so our patio has steps that cascade right into the lagoon-like pool. An oversized tile shower, a well-appointed room and bath products that smell like a cool citrus breeze all become the icing on the cake celebrating our first impression of this paradise. Past the patio steps, the pool serpentines in and out of palm trees and thick tropical plants strategically placed throughout--allowing the utmost privacy for its guests. When we awake in the morning, birds sing outside and I feel like I've been transported to my very own jungle. When it's time for breakfast, we head over to El Bistro, as breakfast is included with your stay. We order the fruit plate and huevos rancheros with coffee and "chaya" juice (our waiters, Micky and Jose and Fidel introduced us to this healthful shake). The restaurant is open, airy and friendly (like the hotel staff). The food is tasteful and delightful. Even the bar right next to El Bistro has a friendly bartender who goes out of his way to make us feel like we're the only ones staying at La Tortuga. That's the way I'd describe La Tortuga...the staff treats you like you're their only guest. They opened our doors for us, smiled every time and offered assistance at every turn. If you're looking for a romantic getaway...this is the place to go...right through the double glass doors and into your very own state of bliss..... :) Bienvenidos ;)

<Title>“Beauuuuutiful!!”
<Content>A charming hotel with a lot of character. It is beautiful, clean, peaceful and quiet yet within walking distance to everything. The El Bistro Restaurant is not only convenient but good. The staff was warm, friendly, & accommodating. I felt completely safe no matter where I went. I will definitely be back SOON!!

<Title>“Little Oasis in the middle of everything!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at La Tortuga while on our honeymoon in February. We were immediately impressed by the service and charm of the hotel. We arrived early (via airport transfer which worked out perfectly also) and waited a few moments for our room to be finished. The room was clean and well equipped with a mini fridge, flat screen TV, soaps, shampoos, etc. Our view was lovely: over the main courtyard with the pool and El Bistro. Noise was not a concern in the room we were in, but could see how it may have been a problem on the street side of the hotel (a plus was that we did notice the french doors leading to outside block A LOT of the street noise!). For our last night we did switch rooms because that was the only way we could stay in 3rd floor jacuzzi room. In our new room the air conditioning did not work properly, so at 9:00 that night someone came up and worked for nearly an hour on the problem. Unfortunately, neither my husband or I speak Spanish, so we couldn't chat with him while he worked, but he was courteous, quick and remedied the problem. The AC stopped working well into the middle of the night, and thankfully it was our last night there, so we didn't have to deal with the issue any further. It seems that the units really work hard given the climate, which is why ours froze up and didn't work properly. My suggestion if this happens to you... ask for another room! Given the commitment to customer service, my prediction is that they'll do whatever they can do accommodate you! Enjoy your stay.

<Title>“BEST Staff and PRIME Location!!”
<Content>Not only is this hotel in the perfect location, but the staff were absolutely phenomenal, making our stay at La Tortuga one of our favorite experiences in Mexico. From the moment we arrived at La Tortuga, we were treated like royalty. Everyone, from housekeeping to management would stop to say "hello" and make sure everything was to our liking. The restaurant and bar staff would always greet us by name when we would return to the hotel throughout the day. La Tortuga is right off of the main strip of shops and restaurants (5th ave.) Yet, once you enter the hotel grounds, the sounds of the street are diminished and you feel like you have escaped the crowds. It was very nice to walk everywhere and not have to pay for a taxi or rental car. Even the beach is within walking distance, offering some of the best beach clubs that serve food and drinks right to your beach chair! This is a great alternative to the large all-inclusive resorts, because you have the freedom to venture out on the town as well as experience the personal attention of a boutique hotel. I would highly recommend La Tortuga and can not wait to return!!

<Title>“Amazing service within a quality boutique hotel in the heart of it all. Can't wait to return”
<Content>Spent 5 days here in April. All of the positive reviews are to be believed. If you are even thinking of staying at an all inclusive in Playa, forget it and stay here. The hotel is beautiful with nearly all rooms having a view of the gorgeously maintained courtyards and pool. Within a close walk is the beach and only a block from 5th ave restaurants and shopping. The staff truly make this a remarkable experience. Jose, the hotel manager is especially attentive and the bartenders and waiters are always available for a friendly chat. They make suggestions for day trips and then check in when you return because they really do care about your experience and your trip. Fidel and Estaban were always on hand and we were on a first name basis with. The hotel is clean and well kept with staff consisently working around the clock to keep it that way. The restaurant had a terrific selection for breakfast which is included and we had dinner there as well one night which was equally good. You can arrange with the hotel for the driver to pick you up from the Cancun airport and drive you back as well which I highly recommend. You will see the tourist police on your way down to Playa. This is a good thing as they are there for the tourists' protection. They are often on the street corners on 5th ave as well. Mexico has invested quite a lot of money in this area to keep it safe and it is, even walking around at night because of this. Finally, we took the advice of La Tortuga's hotel manager and rented a car and drove down to their sister property Ziggy Beach. Really wonderful spot right on the water with happy hour all day and a beach like no other. If you're looking for a good day trip, you should put this on your list. You can rent a car or arrange for the hotel to have a driver take you down -whichever you prefer. I have stayed at many hotels and chains from the Ritz and Four Seasons to the W and all the way down to a Motel 6 in my travels. (I travel a lot for work and pleasure) I would recommend this hotel highly for the level of service that you receive, the relaxing and beautiful atmosphere that surrounds you while there, and for the price, it's really a deal.

<Title>“Beautiful and Relaxing”
<Content>All the reviews on Tripadvisor are accurate. This is a quaint, beautiful, peaceful hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and also very quaint. Plenty big enough for 2-3 people. We had a beautiful balcony over looking the pool and courtyard. The pool was clean and refreshing. We went to the beach and also sat by the pool which was a nice contrast. The location is also perfect- just a block off 5th but far enough away to feel like you are separated from all the tourists. My only negative is the room we had was in the back and on sat nite the bar behind the hotel had a band until 1 or 2 am that kept us awake. Other than that nite it was very quiet. We had breakfast included every morning and the lattes were great! The menu had a very nice selection. We also had dinner at the Bistro connected to the hotel and that was very good. We would highly recommend this hotel.

<Title>“incredible staff, an oasis 2blks. from shopping and the beach, simply PERFECT!”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from an amazing 3night stay at La Tortuga. We were "wow"ed by Claudia the moment she greeted us-she immediately helped us set up a local tour and answered all of the many questions we had. Alberto and Fidel also introduced themselves immediately and provided amazing service and professionalism for us during our entire stay. After mentioning to Fidel that my husband would be celebrating a birthday during our last day, we were greeted on his birthday with specially concocted cocktails and every inch of our room was decorated with balloons, flower petals, chocolate strawberries and champagne! Our breakfasts at La Bistro were delicious with great service provided by Santiago! I do hope we can return next year....I'm already looking forward to it!

<Content>A beautiful oasis in the center of Playa. Perfect location, close to the beaches, the restaurants and the shops, yet off the main strip, which ensures quietness and serenity. Service was perfect, personable and tasteful. It was my boyfriends' b-day and they surprised us with a room full of balloons, chocolate covered fruit and a bottle of champagne. Flower petals were everywhere!. El bistro prepared a dinner table for us on the roof-private, with our own music. Upon returning to the room after dinner, we found creme brulee waiting for us! Can't say enough about this place. Thank you, La Tortuga!

<Title>“EXCELLENT”
<Content>This was the best vacation my husband and I have had in a decade. The staff treated us like family and by the end of the stay that is how they felt. Claudia, Alfredo, Estaban, Santiago, Jose, Emiliano, Julio, Omar and all the rest of the staff were so kind, friendly, knowledgable, and fun to be around. I miss them all and can't wait to see them again. This hotel is perfect if you want to meet new people or just stay to yourselves. They can not do enough for you and are always ready to help out in anyway they can. Zenzi beach is around the corner and you can get discounts from the front dsesk to get the umbrellas, lounge chairs, drinks and lunch or dinner there. Erika and Pepe are the best servers so ask to sit in their sections. We are now looking for a place to purchase because it is so peaceful and SAFE there. I wish all of you the same incredible experience we had<3

<Title>“Lovely boutique hotel with great service”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga after having read the great reviews on Tripadvisor. We had a lovely stay. The hotel is situated around a beautiful and lush garden/pool area. It's tastefully furnitured and ideally located just off of 5th avenue where all the shops and restaurants are. The beach is a 5 min. walk. We highly recommend paying a bit more and go for a standard plus room. The standard rooms don't all have a balcony. Due to that, to our taste they were kinda claustrofobic. We booked a standard plus room and had a nice balcony with a beautiful view of the garden. Our room ( I think it was 214) was on the small side (we did not really have room to put our suitcases away) but because of the balcony it didn't bother us. Othe rooms were bigger though, so if you have the possibility, try to check out more rooms! The kingsize bed was very comfortable. The tv was on the small side, but it has American channels which was lovely since we had a couple of rainy days. Wifi worked perfect in our room and is free of charge. The bahtroom was large and very clean. Great shower too. The personnel at front desk speak perfect English and are very helpful. The cleaning ladies are very friendly and everything was spotless! You can have your breakfast at the onsight restaurant. We highly recommend this since everything was very tasteful and you can order everything from sandwiches, eggs to very tasty Mexican dishes. One dish, a hot drink and a cold drink are free of charge. The only thing we weren't crazy about was the pool. It's beautiful to look at, but not really ideal to swim in. It lies in the shade all day, so it's cold and it's not deep so you can take a quick dip but that's it.

<Title>“Loved La Tortuga!”
<Content>Met a group of friends at La Tortuga and we had a great time! Service was great - they make an extra effort to make sure their guests are well-taken care of. Thanks to Esteban, Jose and manager Jose at El Bistro for serving us so well, and to Leo, Fidel and Annabel at the bar for putting up with our group! Everyone was so nice and the personal touch was very nice. The food and drinks were great, and the free breakfast is a great deal. Rooms were nice - had a bit of trouble with the toilet, but it was fixed quickly. Room was always clean and tidy, with plenty of towels. Pool area and lounge areas were lovely and always well kept. Front desk service from Carlos and Alfredo was impeccable also. My friend's birthday occurred during our stay and the breakfast staff brought a crepe dish and sang happy birthday and their room was decorated, complete with balloons, flowers, champagne and chocolate covered strawberries! So nice! The hotel is very close to 5th Avenue, and we hung out mostly at Zenzi beach, which is maybe a 4-5 block walk. Get there early for chairs and you'll love it. Service there was very good also, and great coconut shrimp and burgers. Nightly music as well. Music at Fah on 5th Ave. was fantastic!! We also hung out at Yan Ten on 4th St. & the beach for happy hour - delicious (and potent!) margaritas, great food (guacamole was awesome), and music. The band let my friend sing with them. Service a little slow at times, but it didn't matter - it was relaxing to sit and enjoy the music and beach. Prices there were very good also. Gracias La Tortuga!

<Content>La Tortuga is awesome! The grounds are beautiful, the service was perfect. The included breakfast is off the menu so it's not just muffins and juice. It's close to the main strip of shops and bars. The pool and lounge area are gorgeous. We had the room with the rooftop jacuzzi and we went up there one night and forgot about it. You don't have a view or anything so we actually spent more time on the balcony overlooking the pool.

<Title>“Great budget option, fantastic breakfast, friendly service”
<Content>I had very high expectations going into this stay, which is likely why I felt a touch let down when I arrived. The service, as everyone has said, is stellar and very helpful. And the hotel's connection to Mamita's beach club is convenient, even if Mamita's is a 10-12 minute walk up 5th ave (tip: the hotel also has a deal with Zensi beach club, which is much, much smaller. Go with Mamita's. Their beach is the best and their large size means you can almost always get a chair/umbrella). What I found somewhat disappointing was the room, which had a window overlooking 10th ave - so not-so-pretty views of the nearby drugstore and convenience mart. That meant that the window mostly stayed closed for privacy reasons, which made the interior very dark and depressing. The room was pretty small with few, if any, special touches. That said, I may return to this hotel sometime - but I would definitely choose a higher class of room than their standard double. Also, fyi, the pool was as lovely as pictured. However, like most pools in Mexico, it was not heated and so was very cool. This meant that we only saw one person swimming in the pool our entire trip. It was nice to look at but not very useable.

<Content>This was my 4th stay at Hotel La Tortuga. Again, we were so impressed by the wonderful, friendly and accomodating staff. The hotel is more beautiful and serene each time we return. We visited the spa for the first time this trip and we were very pleased with our couples massage (best massage I've ever had, honestly!). The free breakfast and all meals at the hotel were delicious! Only complaint I could have is that there is dance club a few blocks away (Coco bongo?) that you can hear sometimes late at night. This won't deter us from another visit though.

<Content>This hotel was a real gem, its like an oasis in the centre of Playa Del Carmen. Only a block from Coco Bongo and one street back from the main strip it is the perfect location to be close enough to everything including the beach but quiet enough to be able to get a good nights sleep. Only tip do not book any tours or transfers with the hotel as they seem to quote double the going rate you can get on the strip.

<Title>“Couldn't have been nicer!”
<Content>We loved our five nights at La Tortuga in February! Perfect way to get away from the winter temps in N.C. The hotel staff was fantastic. We were able to upgrade last-minute from a swim-up room to a superior suite for only $10 p/day. Worth every cent. Loved the included breakfast, and plenty of time to enjoy it b/c the range for the breakfast dining is over four or five hrs. The bar staff was great too! Didn't try the hotel for dinner - we ventured out to 5th Avenue a couple times (which can be pricey) and we also tried a couple places more of the Playa residents frequent. Amazing food everywhere! Try an excursion with YukaTreks if you have time too! Mitch was great!

<Title>“The perfect spot in Playa!”
<Content>We chose this hotel on the basis of so many positive and enthusiastic reviews. Very accurate! The hotel -- while right in the middle of the downtown action -- was quiet, peaceful, secluded and romantic. Situated around a beautiful pool with a garden of banana trees (real bananas!) lush tropical greenery, fabulous birds, it was a beautiful oasis. Our room was not particularly large, but the decor was very pleasing, the bed was ultra comfortable and our balcony -- covered in deep pink bougainvillea -- was lovely. The hotel is not right on the beach but provides easy access to it. We especially enjoyed the Zensi beach club -- a gorgeous, mostly uncrowded, beach with very good food! Our experience with Jose, the manager and the other members of the staff was very much as reviewed! They gave us a personal welcome and made us feel like friends. And those towel sculptures are adorable! We had a fabulous stay. Thanks everyone!

<Title>“Beautiful place, top notch service”
<Content>We had a wonderful stay here and they went out of their way to make everything right. The room was small, but very nice and there is a gorgeous view of the garden/pool area from our balcony. The pool is in a figure 8, with coconut palms and banana trees and other beautiful plants. There is also a jacuzzi in the middle, which was a bit cool the first couple days, but they made sure to take care of it. There was also plenty of spots to relax with sunbeds around the pool and in the solarium and tables outside the resaurant. We especially appreciated Luis, who was the supervisor for the accomodations and restaurant, and he bent over backwards to make sure our stay was perfect. When we got home, we realized our photos did not get downloaded but they were still on the computer at the hotel and they made sure all the pictures got to us. What a relief that was! The food was great, too and you can't beat the free breakfast. The hotel is close to everything, just a block from shopping on 5th Avenue and 2 blocks from the beach. It was an awesome stay!

<Title>“Lovely!! Absolutely stay here.”
<Content>Phenomenal value... I stayed here last spring with my boyfriend. I am a snob when it comes to traveling, so this recommendation comes from a hyper-critical traveler. La Tortuga delivered on all expectations. Had a great time. Definitely a better bet than those jumbo, yucky, impersonal all-inclusives (which I just did in January and will never do it again). Everyone and everything is lovely, lovely, lovely. Hotel is inn the center of Playa Del Carmen so close to generally everything. The Mamita beach club is an absolute plus... although, I didn't enjoy the walk when I'd forget things in the room. Schedule a day trip down to Tulum. Definitely worth it.

<Title>“We loved our stay at this romantic hotel but there were a couple of minor issues”
<Content>Disclaimer: We actually stayed here in Late Nov/Early Dec 2009 but TA didn't give that as an option. First of all, we loved this hotel, most of the staff and it's location near the heart of PDC. The Staff at El Bistro were first rate and made our Breakfasts and pool side dining some of the highlights of our trip. Also the Bartenders were so nice and generous, hooking us us up with the occaisonal free drink and making some of the best margaritas we have ever had(try the diablo!!!). The room we stayed in was right next to the restaurant but we weren't bothered by any noise. We loved the hammock, the upstairs deck and hotub, the modern look and our view of the pool/property. We weren't thrilled with the following: construction going on throughout the day (lots of loud banging going on), some of the staff didn't seem like they were there to go the extra mile for us, and our bathtub was majorly leaking for half of our stay. It took a few calls to finally have someone take care of it. Also the hottub in the public area was out of commission for a few days, and when they said it was fixed, it was still freezing (not a huge deal cause we used the one in our room). Overall, for what we paid(it was a discount package offered on their website for off-season) it was a great value and time. We will consider going back but ONLY if they change their policy on when construction is carried out, i.e. they should close for a month and do it all when they won't be bothering guests who want to lounge around the pool.)

<Title>“Pleasant Hotel, convenient for the nightlife!”
<Content>We didn't do our homework properly on Playa Del Carmen so when we arrived (after 2 weeks of quiet but cultural travelling through Mexico) it was a bit of a shock, as we expected the place to be a bit quieter! We were given a standard room right next to the lobby, that everyone walks past, so we wanted a change of room straightaway! However, we had to upgrade to a standard plus the next day for $50 a night to get a better room. However, the new room was much better with its own balcony and after that the hotel started to grow on us. There's nice greenery and pools with the restaurant (El Bistro) to the side so it's all very pleasant. The hotel is one street of the main 5th Avenue so it is a bit noisy, especially as we were there over New Year and the music was thumping in the distance. We'd recommend El Bistro as the food was excellent and the staff really try to give as good a service as possible. They were very busy, but be patient! Even Playa Del Carmen started to grow on us after a few days!

<Title>“Nice place, but still owe me a refund.”
<Content>We really liked Hotel La Tortuga, great location and nice people, but they accidentally charged me twice for my stay. They were very good about reimbursing part of the overpayment, but I'm still waiting for them to complete the reimbursement. They have been pretty silent about the overcharge, so I'm getting concerned. If you stay here, be careful when you pay your bill.

<Content>This was my second stay at La Tortuga. I must say that the customer service was incredible and all employees responded to my requests promptly. The interior pool area is a oasis of tranquility. A great constrast to the stimulating energy and vibe of 5th Avenue. You get the 'best of both worlds.' Each employee smiled and was extremely friendly. Feel free to contact me if you have a specific questions. What an Awesome Experience!!

<Title>“La Tortuga continues to be the best stay in Playa del Carmen”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at La Tortuga for 4 days for our honeymoon. The staff, the breakfast and the room was fantastic. My husband and I had dinner there 3 times out of our 4 night stay. We have traveled to Playa del Carmen before and La Tortuga has the best restaurant in town. The free breakfast is a great bonus and it is not buffet style. All breakfast is a la carte and made fresh. I do recommend the chilaquiles they are just fabulous. I would also recommend their margaritas. They have happy hour everyday. The rooms are very comfortable. Next time we decide to take another beach getaway we will be staying at our favorite hotel: La Tortuga.

<Title>“LOVELY TROPICAL ESCAPE”
<Content>We stayed last week at La Tortuga. The hotel is darling and surrounds a lush courtyard filled with tropical plants and a beautiful pool. The decor was wonderful throughout the hotel. Our room was one of the cheaper ones and was rather small, however it suited us fine since we spent little time hanging out in our room. It was clean, comfortable, and reasonably priced. The staff were wonderful and always helpful. We also enjoyed the hotel restaurant, "El Bistro", where we dined several times. A great place to eat with equally great service! This hotel is a jewel in Playa del Carmen.

<Title>“Great location with strong customer service”
<Content>La Tortuga is a quaint and charming bungalow style boutique hotel situated in the middle of it all at the heart of Playa. There were a few key components in selecting La Tortuga: It's strong reviews on customer service from Trip Advisor, it's location in the heart of all the shops and restaurants and within walking distance to the beach, and to be situated amongst the town to learn more about the Mexican culture and food as opposed to being stuck in an all inclusive. Upon arriving to La Tortuga for our honeymoon, things got off to a rocky start. Although we were greeted with a welcome drink and by very friendly staff, we were given a room one or two classes lower than the superior suite we had requested. When we asked about it, they let us know that the room we were supposed to get was on the side with the construction (which I know is not their fault), so they were trying to be proactive and moved us to another room. Obviously, it didn't make sense to pay a premium price for a basic room so that was my issue at that time. The front desk guy (who seemed brand new) got his manager and she promptly got us in to another room. Unfortunately the new room we were moved in to had a moldy/damp smell and was smaller than the first room. She said she'd have the smell removed and take care of sprucing it up for us while we went out for a stroll and to the beach. Unfortunately, when we returned, they had forgotten about our room and the smell was still there. The other front desk lady could tell I was unhappy with the situation. She actually approached us and came to our room to see what else she could do to fix the situation. She was able to locate yet another room for us and this one was what we had initially reserved on the website with the rooftop terrace jacuzzi, but with two double beds. That was fine with us, no problem. So we switched a third and last time. Would have loved to have that room from the start at check in. Not sure why that wasn't an option especially since it was exactly what we had booked. Anyhow, they did everything possible to try to rectify the situation so I commend them for their customer service. I think due to the close proximity of Coco Bongo, there will be noise in the distance no matter what room you're in. I think that's the case for any hotel you stay at that's in that 5th or 10th vicinity of Playa. There's nothing the hotel can do about that so I recommend either bringing ear plugs or drinking more alcohol at dinner so you can pass out. Or if you can't beat 'em, join 'em! The price of our stay included free breakfast daily until 11am at The Bistro. It was great to have such an awesome restaurant immediately downstairs. Don't forget to ask for your breakfast tickets at the front desk on your way to breakfast. I recommend getting a middle priced room, as I don't think paying the premium price is worth it (during peak season). It's not a luxury style hotel, so you're truly paying for the service level and the location. Your experience is going to be the same if your'e in a suite or one of other rooms we had seen. I wanted to point out that the safe is too small to fit a laptop, however, we felt so safe there that I left out my laptop with no issues with security at all. Also, the toiletries provided by the hotel are ample and plenty. Another note, one of our days of our stay we had a minor medical situation and we needed a doctor. The very nice lady at the front desk called a doctor, got us their new address which was within walking distance, and made sure the doctor was there. When we got there he was expecting us and it helped get us in right away. Overall, our experience at La Tortuga shaped up to be a good one. The staff clearly makes this hotel what it is and I can see how they generate repeat business over and over again. Special shout out to Alfredo who is the biggest multi tasker hotel employee I've ever seen! He really works hard and exemplified strong customer service at all times. I would return to La Tortuga and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an authentic experience in the heart of a great fisherman's town looking to learn more about the Mexican culture.

<Content>My third trip to la torturga- and once again- amazing. This trip it was my friends birthday and the staff went all out!! Amado and Rambo decorated the table at el bistro for dinner, all the servers sang happy birthday, and the chef prepared an incredible meal (try the ribeye) and a beautiful chocolate cake. My friend had the best birthday ever. While we were at dinner, Miguel had the hotel decorate our room with balloons, flowers and champagne. It was such a surprise and they really outdid themselves. Needless to say, the staff is incredible; in particular amado, Rambo, Miguel, Bernardo, morgana, and Marco. I will frequent la torturga because they all feel like family now. Thank you la torturga for an amazing experience as usual. Can't wait to get back up there!

<Title>“Believe the hype!!! This place is amazing!!!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at La Tortuga for our honeymoon back in August. And, let me just say that it was the best decision we could have made!!! We were looking for a nice boutique-type-hotel to stay at (because we're not big-resort-type people). Plus, we wanted a place that was kid-free and serene, and that's exactly what we got. We LOVED it here. Our room was perfectly set up for our first night there, and the bed was so comfy, my favorite part of our room was our private jacuzzi on our rooftop! The people at the front desk were also soooooooo helpful. My hubby and I would call up with special requests at night and they would gladly deliver, an example of this is that one night we wanted chocolate-covered strawberries, but with white chocolate. Well, they only had dark chocolate, so to make up for it, they specially ordered the white chocolate for us and had it for us the following night!! Details like these made their customer service and staff some of the best we'd encountered. The people are so friendly there. And the FOOD!! What can I say about the food? Except that it was some of the best food I've ever had-- Le Bistro is simply amazing! I recommend ordering the chilaquiles for breakfast and the natural waters. We loved happy hour at the pool. And the location is perfect-- just walking distance from the beach and fifth street. You won't regret staying here! My hubby and I cannot wait to go back!!

<Title>“Awesome staff, lovely hotel”
<Content>La Tortuga is in a terrific central location, within easy walking distance from shopping and the beach. The hotel has lovely common areas and clean, comfortable rooms. The hotel restaurant serves up very good food. But the highlight is definitely the staff. We thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Morgana, Rambo, Miguel, Oscar, and many others. They were so accommodating it was unbelievable. Kudos also to the cleaning staff, who not only kept things spic and span but also left us clever towel sculptures each day. Nice massage at the on-site spa. We stayed a week, and it was completely peaceful the first few nights. I haven't slept so well in years. However, the last two nights of our stay were disrupted by street noise (it appeared to be coming from a nearby club). The hotel staff moved us to a different room, which was very nice; that was the only downside in an otherwise blissful week.

<Content>This boutigue hotel is centrally located and very, very nice. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. It is located near the beaches and near the shopping. Inside its is very quiet and clean. Very good value. People say it is unsafe to travel to Mexico. I (in my early 60's) and my girlfriend and I disagree. At least not in the Yucatan and not at this location. My friend is actually planning to go back in January for her 50th birthday.

<Title>“Fantastico - Another Great Stay!”
<Content>This was our 2nd visit to the hotel, and again - rave reviews for the staff at the hotel and El Bistro restaurant. We made the trek down to their property in Tulum - Cabanas Tulum by La Tortuga Hotel - Gorgeous beach and very relaxing (See pic). Eduardo, our bartender and waiter for the day, was great - polite and accommodating and Johnny-on-the-Spot considering he had the whole property to cover all by himself. Our group of 5, ate lunch at the property and we each tried a different entree - all plates were presented very well (El Bistro Style), everything was fresh and all very tasty. I had the Portobello burger with goat cheese & Chipotle dressing - YUM! They are still renovating some portions of the hotel from what I could see, but there were plenty of guests staying on premises. Definitely worth a visit. Morgana at the Playa hotel told us about a package deal for both locations - Playa and Tulum - transportation included, so we'll definitely consider it for our next trip.

<Content>I have stayed at La Tortuga twice...I have never experienced the kind of customer service I received here. The hotel/resturant is beautiful, but what makes this place great is their excellent staff, and I truly believe anyone who has had the pleasure of staying here would agree. Miguel, Marco, Bernardo,Amado,Mickey, Rambo are just a few of the great staff, they act with the utmost professionalism, while still treating you like a friend. Throughout all my travels I have never felt as comfortable and welcomed than with these specific staff memebers at La Tortuga. I would encourage the management to be very thankful for what a great place and staff you have. Great Job! Keep it up! Thanks La Tortuga.

<Title>“Wonderful experience”
<Content>This was by far one of our better vacation experiences. We had stayed at the Grand Mayan earlier in the year and wanted to spend a week downtown and La Tortuga did not disappoint. The service was the best we have ever experienced as the staff came to know us by our first names and made our stay memorable. We didn't leave the hotel the first two days it was so comfortable and relaxing and we ate only two meals out the entire week as the food and service in Le Bistro restaraunt were great. The guacamole and pico de gallo were fantastic. Location is perfect as your around the corner from 5th Ave without all the foot traffic. I would highly recommend the Mayan Coffee in Le Bistro. It is quite a show. You can't go wrong with a stay here.

<Title>“Not ideal for a quiet getaway”
<Content>We booked La Tortuga months ago largely due to positive Trip Advisor reviews. However, as we got closer to our departure date we started to notice many reviewers complaning about the noise level of the hotel due to the proximity of Coco Bongo and the street noise of 10th Avenue. We read that free upgrades were given, so we were not too concerned. Upon check -in we immediately requested a room as far away as possible from Coco Bongo, and were assured that the room was quiet. The room we were given was tiny - room enough for a full size bed and nothing else - barely room to move around, and right on 10th Avenue. After a sleepless night, we requested a room change, and were told that since we were in a "standard" room, we could be moved to a "standard plus" room, but for an additional charge. I had read other reviews where guests were given free upgrades, but we were charged. We were so exhausted and stressed that we agreed to pay the difference. We realize that the hotel is not responsible for this noise, but feel that if the hotel is not full (this was the off season) upgrades should be free. We asked Bernardo, the manager, to arrange a taxi ride for us to a destination, He quoted a price, and we were told to pay him in cash, and not the driver. Once we got to our destination, we realized that we had paid $20 more than any of the other people who had travelled the same route.

<Title>“Perfect Little Hotel”
<Content>I have to agree with the majority of reviews, this hotel is really special. The hotel is all about customer service, the staff is well trained and very accommodating. Check in was very classy down to fruit drinks. The Hotel is in a perfect location close to the main shopping street and beaches. The hotel has a very nice courtyard with a lazy river running through it and is very lush, private and provides a quiet "zen" space. Many rooms are facing onto this beautiful space. The bar is the main feature of this inner courtyard and it provides a pool table and also many nice spaces to sit and read a book or have a drink. MARCO is the jewel of this bar, I have never met anyone who cares so much about the quality of service he provides and Marco makes some of the best drinks we have ever had, his "Mojitos" are the absolute best we have ever had. After a day or two with Marco you will think you are part of his family. The in eatery "Le Bistro" also had excellent staff who again really were so genuine in the friendlyness and wanting to make sure our stay perfect. Le Bistro had some of the best food in PDC and very reasonable prices, full breakfast was included in the price of our room and it was not to be missed. We also had Rambo make us a Mayan coffee one night and he truly is an artist, it was well worth the expense. As with any good hotel areas of improvement are always possible. We had a junior suite, the room was large enough, very nice bathroom, soooo very clean, the decor was very plain, the amenities were above avererage but they were cheap with towels, it was hard to figure out as they were so generous with many other things. Our first night we did not close our bathroom window properly and we were up all night because of the noise as our room faced the outside streets. When I mentioned the problem the next morning we were told to make sure our windows were closed properly as they had installed new soundproof windows, in reality they should have offered to show us another room that did not face the outside streets we were really dissapointed in how this was handled. On our last day it was raining very hard outside but no umbrella was offered by the same staff member who handled the noise complaint, we noticed as we walked around many other hotels had given there guests umbrellas that would have been nice. We also mentioned in an email to the hotel it was our birthday but that went un- noticed. No a big deal but it would have been nice to have a small fuss made...... We were offered 2 beach clubs to use during our stay, we chose Sensi and it was perfect for us. Overall a very nice hotel who in most instances has a focus on high customer service and it is the staff that just make the whole thing work, not sure if we would book the same type of room again as the noise was dissapointing. If you have any questions feel free to ask.

<Title>“I will never go to an all-inclusive again”
<Content>We had been to Playa twice before this trip, but stayed in an all inclusive. This time I wanted to stay in downtown Playa and try something different. Best decision ever!! We stayed in a Junior suite that had a rooftop patio with a jacuzzi bath, which I highly recommend. The staff was so nice and helpful and gave us a lot of privacy. We ate breakfast everyday at El Bistro, which is connected to the hotel and breakfast was complimentary. It was very good, not just juice, toast and coffee. I wish we had tried dinner there, but never got around to it. The hotel was one block away from 5th avenue, which is where everything is located and three blocks from the beach. We are already planning our next trip!!

<Title>“Pure luxury and 5 star service”
<Content>We stayed here to celebrate my 30th birthday and couldn't have picked a better hotel. Not only is the pool and bar area stunning, it's in a great location right near the 5th avenue shops and the crystal clear waters of the beach. Breakfast is included in your price so it works out pretty reasonable considering how nice the hotel is as well (and you get your choice of anything off the breakfast menu from the restaurant downstairs). We had originally booked a swim up room, however after 2 nights in the room with no sleep (we shared a common wall with the local night club), we inquired about changing rooms an were upgraded for free to one of the suites on the roof with a spa.

<Title>“Exquisite service in a great hotel.”
<Content>Just spent 4 nights at La Tortuga and it was amazing. What really sets this place apart is the service. It's a small hotel so they got to know us and greeted us by name every time we came and went. Also very helpful with arranging tours and letting us know about the area. It's a block off 5th Avenue with all the restaurants and bars, and is amazingly calm and peaceful in the pool/courtyard. Bernardo and Miguel up front made our stay! I was there with friends for a late birthday celebration and Bernardo arranged to have our room decorated for the occasion after a quick off-hand mention at check-in! The pool is small and covered with trees, so it's not the place to hang out for tanning and lounging in the sun, but it's a great backdrop for a drink with Marco at the bar. There is a sun deck, but again it's quite small and up a level so not by the pool. Also, the hot tub was not very hot. They tried to fix it, and we got some hot water pumped in the first time we tried, but the second time it was back to barely warmer than the pool. Mamita's, the beach club, is a ~10 minute walk away, but is quite nice once you get over there. The rooms are not spectacular but are leaps and bounds above your typical beachside hotel. We had the swim-up room, which was very cool, and it was a good size, well maintained, and had nice decor. One problem we had was that the A/C was either on or off (i.e. hot or freezing), and it drips when it's on. I really can't say enough good things about the service here. Miguel arranged a trip for us to the Mayan ruins at Tulum. When we were late coming back, he called the driver to make sure were were OK. You don't get that level of service at a larger hotel. I will be back just as soon as I can!

<Title>“Over all it is a good location”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga for 9 nights at the end of October. Yes, Coco Bongo was noisey as was the traffic on 10th avenue after the night club closed. After 2 nights of poor sleep in a Standard room on the west side of hotel, I approached the hotel staff and they moved us to a Standard Plus room (free upgrade) on the third floor on the North side of the hotel. Much better, did not hear Coco Bongo from there. Pool is nice looking but only for a cooling dip, not for swimming. There was also construction next door but to be fair to the hotel this was out of their control. Free breakfeasts were good, staff try very hard to keep patrons happy.

<Title>“Hell night at Ls Tortuga in Playa Del Carmen”
<Content>The following review will be based on the location of the hotel and not necessarily on the hotel it’s self. However if you plan to stay at La Tortuga you must take the following into consideration. La Tortuga is situation off 5th Avenue, which is the main spot for shopping, restaurants and bars. If you book a room with a roof top Jacuzzi expecting to be in a world of your own you will be disappointed because all of 5th Avenue’s traffic will echo, especially at night. However, that is not so bad… What gives La Tortuga a huge black eye in my opinion is the close proximity to CoCo Bongo. If you are not familiar with this club it is a rager. The club’s bongo drumming and dance music permeates as if the club was downstairs at El Bistro, and trying to get some sleep was nearly impossible. My husband and I are not light sleepers. Coco Bongo raged well beyond 3am and what made matters worse was we needed to get up early to catch our flight in Cozumel the next day. I thought about calling reception and informing them about this but really what were they going to do? Move us to another room? The noise from Coco Bongo was like a storm, there was no escape. Come morning, my husband and I were miserable and angry. The hotel treat I booked for the both us blew up on my face. My husband asked me if I had read the reviews for La Tortuga and I said yes, and that most were positive. I thought the negatives were by typical annoying Americans that demand everything to be perfect and cheap no matter where they go. Well, all I wanted was some sleep and got nearly none. When we were asked by the receptionist how was our stay I informed her that we didn’t get any sleep because of the club. All I got from her was, “Well that’s unfortunate” and proceeded to hand over a bill for the drinks I ordered. Those words almost made me forget that there are nice and very friendly people that work at La Tortuga, and they genuinely care that you have a pleasant stay…Perhaps her indifference comes from having heard it before and there is nothing she or the hotel can do about it… or maybe she simply didn’t give a sh**. Again, to be fair the night of hell administered by CoCo Bongo was not La Tortuga’s fault. But mainly the identity problem Playa Del Carmen seems to be going through. What is it? A party town or an oasis for people looking to get away from it all? Either way, I am not staying there again.

<Title>“La Tortuga -- Best overall hotel experience we've ever had.”
<Content>Where to begin? It's a quaint little boutique hotel, just off 5th Ave. in Playa del Carmen. For us it was the perfect location as it's quiet, off the beaten path a bit, and allows for easy access in and out of the city for our rented vehicle. Obviously, don't stay here if you're looking to step outside the room and feel your toes in the sand (Mamita's and Zenzi are beach clubs that the resort has ties with -- worked fine for us). The rooms are as diverse in amenities/size as you need them to be and the decor/layout/etc. are above average. We had the upgraded Jr. Suite with a rooftop jacuzzi that we didn't use once, but was a nice forethought. The upkeep of the flora, cleanliness and ambiance was outstanding. The pool/bar area is simply breathtaking, with flowers blooming, banana's hanging, lush, tropical landscaping, a gorgeous pool, and lots of places to lounge and relax. The entrance to the on-site restaurant (El Bistro) is mere steps from the bar. I never thought to ask and it may have nothing to do with La Tortuga itself, but the fare, staff and atmosphere of the restaurant was also outstanding. The staff at La Tortuga/El Bistro deserves their own write-up, but I'll devote this paragraph to it anyway. Santiago, Amado, Marco, Fidel, Rambo, Morgana, Dr. Oscar, Bernardo, Micky and anyone else I might be forgetting, really made this trip for us. They were over-the-top friendly and accommodating. On the last day, my wife and I spent the entire afternoon/evening sitting at the bar with Marco and Fidel, while Amado, Rambo, and others would sneak over and have shots with us. Hope it doesn't get them in trouble! It was so much fun. Marco even overheard my wife mention that she didn't get to try a fresh coconut while we were there, so he went out into the pool area and chopped two for us. He dressed them up and we drank concoctions from them. Just outstanding -- the perfect end to the trip. By far, this was the perfect vacation, due largely to the nature of Playa del Carmen and the surrounding areas, but more importantly, our home base and its friendly faces.

<Title>“Excellent Service!”
<Content>I honestly would've given this hotel and excellent rating, if it wasn't for the final night that we stayed we were kept awake until 3am by blarring music from the hotel next door. We enquired if we could change our room for this one night, but alas the porter at night spoke no english. It was a real shame as the rest of the hotel was quiet enough that night :-( Taking everything else into consideration - I would recommend this hotel. The service was outstanding - from our e-mail communication in the process of booking to the porters who were very friendly and the reception desk lady - who was phenominal! The restaurant as well was brilliant food and service - I can not fault it at all - hugely helpful and friendly with a great sense of humour. The rooms were pretty small but very comfortable, and a balcony is always appreciated - very safe. The pool was also not as deep as I first thought by the website buts its great to lounge around in, and the location is great just of 5th Ave. All in all I would stay there again, although I think it was a bit pricey!

<Title>“A Very NICE Hotel!!!”
<Content>We spent 4 nights here at the end of September. We read all of the reviews on TA beforehand and they are right on! Given its location one block from the center of town, it is an oasis within itself. We reserved the swim-up room and used it a lot (really cool). The rooms are spotless and the maid is so creative with her towel sculptures that we just had to take pictures. Marco, the bartender, is very nice. He makes great mojitos and he surpised us one day by serving us a drink as we were swimming under one of the bridges over the pool. Bernardo and Miguel at the front desk were very helpful with all of our needs. Finally a big shout out to Amado at El Bistro. On a day were to take a tour to Xel Ha, the driver arrived 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. We had just ordered breakfast at El Bistro so Amado had it wrapped up and ready to go for us within minutes. Thanks everyone. Though we thoroughly enjoyed our stay we do have a couple of minor inconveniences to note. There are too many coupons for services. Breakfast, beach towels, beach clubs, discount dinner, etc. One day we walked all the way to Mamitas Beach Club then realized that we forgot the coupon from the hotel to comp our loungers and umbrella. We skipped the beach that day. Our bathroom window had no screen so, because of the mosquitos, we requested one be installed. It took several attempts to get it done. Overall we had a great stay and can't wait to return. Ron & Mari San Francisco

<Title>“Excellent Hotel, Service & Location!!”
<Content>We would like to thank the Hotel la Tortuga for the lovely holidays that we spend during our stay in Playa del Carmen the last week of July 2010. In our opinion, the hotel La Tortuga is beautiful, the service is excellent, the swimming pool is lovely and very relaxing… you can have a swim, you can get in the Jacuzzi or you can read a book without any noise around. The rooms are really nice and comfortable and the location is ideal… right in the center of everything and 5 minutes walking from the beach. Muchas Gracias!! It was wonderful!!

<Title>“Best hotel/experience I've had”
<Content>My boyfriend and I spent 7 wonderful days in Playa del Carmen from 9/26-10/3 for his birthday. We found La Tortuga on Trip Advisor, say the amazing reviews and booked it. Our goal for this trip was relaxation and La Tortuga was just that. As we arrived we were greeted to chocolated covered straberries and champagne for my boyfriend's birthday and a beautful suite. Our suite had a private deck with a rooftop pool. We were so pleased. Throughout the week we had breakfast at the Bistro, and the food was OUTSTANDING! The staff at La Tortuga were amazing and catered to our every need. We went fishing one day, caught a barracuda, and El Bistro cooked the fish for us over a bed of rice and vegetables free of charge. They then brought it to our room so we could have a private, romantic dinner just the two of us. It was surely a highlight to our trip. La Tortuga hotel is a MUST if you're traveling to Playa with your significant other and don't want to kids running around or a million people.

<Title>“Unique and Relaxing”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at La Tortuga for our honeymoon and we couldn't have picked a better place. We had a great suite on the upper floor with a rooftop jacuzzi and a covered thatched roof. This hotel was so unique and beautiful. There was something to discover at each turn. Beautiful pool and landscaping. What we really loved about it was that it was authentic and not one of those sterile mega hotel places. The food at the restaurant was great and so was the beach club that you get passes too. We would come back and stay the next time we go to Playa del Carmen.

<Content>Lovely boutique hotel. Ideal for relaxing and for access to Playa Del Carmen's key areas. Morgana was great in assisting us in upgrading our room. Oscar always had a smile on his face and Marco was great with the cocktails. El Bistro provided some fine meals and entertainment (ask for a Mayan coffee!) Thanks to all the staff for making this a memorable first visit to the area.

<Title>“Relaxing and inviting”
<Content>The staff of La Tortuga make it one of the best places I have stayed on vacation. We came here after a miserable week at a nearby four-star, all-inclusive resort and were blown away by the service. From Fidel and Marco at the bar, Oscar at the front door to the staff of the restaurant, everyone made you feel welcome and comfortable. I unfortunately had a horrible head and chest cold, and everyone went way out of their way to make sure I was taken care of. It is refreshing to see a hotel with staff who are longterm and enjoy their job!

<Title>“Great Little hotel... but there is some noise from the night clubs nearby.”
<Content>I stayed with a friend in early september. The Lobby area could use some updating I was a little afraid at first but when you go through the glass door to the hotel area it very nicely done. there was one area on the back side of the hotel that is pretty awful looking. It should be covered or have a sign. It looked like a swamp with rebar sticking out of it. it may be a construction zone but it needs to be addressed. The lounge area was clean and comfortable we spent our first night just talking out by the pool. The room was clean. Don't expect dressers, there was open shelving instead in addition to a small closet. The extra touches in the bathroom like Q-tip or Cotton balls and a small sewing kit was nice. The only thing I would recommend is that they get an exhaust fan installed, it was hot when you showered and opening the window was not helpful when it was humid and hot outside. The Bistro was great the staff was friendly and helpful. The food was excellent. Although, I did get the feeling that we were lavished with attention that first night then handed a survey. By the last night, there was a definite difference in the service level. We almost felt neglected and could see that most of the attention was on the newcomers. The beach was close and beautiful, night clubs were right around the corner, and the noise from the coco bongo club can be heard so if you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs. You have have the use of beach chairs and umbrellas at Mamitas beach club, if you need to get supplies, there is a Walmart within walking distance. There are shops along the street , at least 2 ATMs that dispense US Dollars nearby. There is also police or security officers stationed along the avenue during the day and at night, i felt really safe. All in all it is a great place stay on a budget and the service is well above average. It had the feel of a private villa.

<Title>“We'll be back.....”
<Content>Can't say enough good things about La Tortuga. Great, small boutique hotel. Very personalized service. We were in town celebrating my girlfriends 40th birthday. They decorated the room (without any prompting) and left a free bottle of wine and cheese plate. Excellent location. Close to 5th Ave, close to excellent restaurants, close to local large grocery stores for supplies. Fidel and Marco were great bartenders. They would see us sitting on our patio and bring over our favorite cocktails.....without us even asking. Breakfast at El Bistro was good and included with room price. Front desk staff was always helpful and friendly. We were preparing to leave the lobby one night for dinner and they offered us a complimentary umbrella, as it was raining. We intend to go back.......the sooner, the better

<Title>“The best small hotel I have stayed in”
<Content>My partner and I spent two weeks at La Tortuga in August. We could not have been happier with the service we received and with the overall experience. Bernardo and his colleagues were always helpful with their advice and in arranging trips, the bar served the best cocktails we had in Playa del Carmen and our bedroom was cleaned immaculately every day. The free breakfast and beach sun loungers were an added bonus. There is one potential downside. We were initially given a room looking on to Avenida 10 and the hotel is very close to the Coco Bongo club. Although the club itself did not create any noise problems people leaving it in the early hours of the morning (and the occasional motorcycle) did. When we asked for our room to be changed, however, our request was readily granted and we moved to a noise free interior room. It is probably worth trying to ensure this from the outset if possible. Overall a great experience which we would thoroughly recommend.

<Title>“The best service ever”
<Content>We chose La Tortuga, only because of the recommendations we found at Tripadvisor. It was a first hotel we stayed at in Playa del Carmen and we really enjoyed our few days there. The facilities are great. Amazing pool with jacuzzi and bar. The best spa in Yucatan Peninsula the Zen-eco spa. We enjoyed the golden hands of Margi, the lady that owns it. The staff was extremely helpful, fulfilling all our requests and being friendly and polite. The room was clean but it wasn't anything special. If we stay more than a few days, we will probably request a better room. The hotel was a bit more pricey than the others but location was great. We stayed in Mexico for more than to weeks, travelled the whole Yucatan Peninsula and at La Tortuga they definitely looked after us the best.

<Title>“Were they tunnelling in? We did not get it either!”
<Content>Five nights in a jaccuzi room felt like 5 on a construction site! Woken every morning by incessant banging that was so loud it felt like they were tunnelling into our bathroom - and, apart from a lunch break - this went on every day until 7:00pm. Had we not pre-paid we would have monved to another boutique hotel, of which there are many - and better from what we saw. We asked to see rooms in others. We were not warned of this at all and on check-out the rather rude clerk appeared shocked by the report of the noise that could be heard all day in every part of the hotel! The bar staff were very nice, the waiters at breakfast also fine (we did not eat dinner there, there are far too many places to go in Playa),breakfast was also good and include din the price. The room was somewhat musty and smaller than expected. Only two towels a day was rather poor and the rooftoop terrace lacked good furniture - although the bath up there was novel. Lighting was very poor in the bathroom also. We had a massage at the spa whcih was very good for the price. It is in no way anything close to a 4 star location, it verges to a 3 star with pretensions - we would not stay again, but Playa is a wonderful location and we will be back in the town itself.

<Content>Best of both worlds: small hotel in central Playa (off Avenida 5!) with free access to Mamita's or Zenzi beach club. Tastefully furnished rooms, fun pool with plants all around, very good restaurant, with 25% discount for first visit by hotel clients. Swim-up bar. Around the corner from Avenida 5 for great restaurants and fun shopping. Drugstore and convenience stores across the street, on Avenida 10. Fairly close to new ADO bus station, in case you decide to take the first-class bus to Tulum or Chichen Itza (recommended).

<Content>We can't say enough good things about our stay at the Tortuga! We give it excellent marks in all aspects and qualities. We only intended to stay for one night on our way to Tulum and after one day and night decided to skip Tulum this time and spend the rest of our time on the Mayan Riviera at the Hotel Tortuga. The staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. The room and the grounds were beautiful and well kept. The location is perfect and the price is just right. Fidel makes one of the best Mojitos you could hope to consume as he leaps over one of the meandering streams of the pool to deliver it to you as you swim. Oh that pool! All I can say is next time we hope to get a swim up room - yeah, that's right - they have rooms you can swim up to.

<Title>“I plan on staying at La Tortuga again!!!”
<Content>I loved La Tortuga Hotel and Spa!!! I would highly recommend it to anyone who isn't looking for one of those big impersonal resorts. They met us at the front door with welcome cocktails. The check in was quick and easy, and they answered all of our questions about excursions, and even set them up for us! We wanted to do a tour to Coba and cenote diving, however the tour wasn't done on the day we could do it. They arranged to have a cab pick us up and take us to Coba and Grand Cenote, and back. We had him for the whole day, and even took us to a great restaurant for lunch! I would have been disappointed if I couldn't see Coba, and I never would have been able to figure that out on my own. The staff at La Tortuga was incredibly friendly and couldn't do enough for you! The rooms were clean and well laid out, the hotel itself had that great boutique hotel feel, the pool was great for a post-excursion soak and I loved the pool bar! The food at El Bistro was delicious, as well. It was conveniently located to everything, and the best part was that it was right around the corner from Avenida 5. Many people are worried that they will hear the crowds from Avenida 5 if their hotel is in close proximity, however we heard absolutely nothing from Avenida 5. When I return to Playa del Carmen, I plan on staying at La Tortuga again!!!

<Title>“La Tortuga = FANTASTIC TIME!!!”
<Content>My girlfriend and & I recently stayed at La Tortuga for (4) nights...I was referred to the resort by a friend...and all I can say is I am glad I chose La Tortuga as my resort for our stay. The minute we walked into the resort, we were greeted by name, offered a free "welcome" cocktail, and the vacation started. The resort was very clean and neat. We especially liked all of the palm trees and exotic plants they had inside the resort by the pool area. I asked the management to plan a "romantic" dinenr for us at their fabulous restaurant as I was proposing to my girlfriend that evening...They went to the trouble of putting a table on the top of the resort, candles, lights, rose pedals, and a bottle of champagne at our table...The service at this resort is incredible. If you are looking for a place to "get away" and not hear kids playing all day, this is YOUR place. Not only that, but 90% of the people we met were "repeat customers" and wont stay at any other resort in Playa. This resort is near 5th street, close to the beaches, and last..."A MUST" if you are going to Playa Del Carmen. I will be back next year!

<Title>“overall-great”
<Content>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at La Tortuga. You really get an incredible value with your stay. The pool is excellent, we had a good time swimming in the pool we had all to ourselves at night while everyone was out for the night scene. The workers are constantly cleaning and tending to the facility. The free breakfast was awesome and very filling. We always had good service. My only complaint would have been with the bartender. One night I went to place a room service order at 10:55 and he wouldn't take my order (although he did take the order the night before) he explained that he was "closed"...I placed my order with a waiter from le bistro only to see him serving drinks to someone else immediately after telling me he was closed. Basically, he didn't want to work if he wasn't going to get any money off of the order. Then, the second problem was with the same bartender the next night when he was too busy flirting with a way-too- young teenager to ask me if I wanted a drink. It kind of grossed me out a little. Other than that, this place was GREAT, two minor incidents that didn't affect my opinion of the place, but I felt was worth mentioning.

<Content>La Tortuga is a wonderful place to stay. I felt so relaxed from the moment I arrived. Everyone working at the hotel goes out of their way to ensure you have everything you require to make your stay amazing. Claudia at the front desk was awesome in taking care of all my needs and answering any questions, as well as suggesting things to do during my stay. Marco is by far the best bartender on the planet. He along with Fidel are the perfect team. The level of customer service these two exude well exceeded any of my expectations. The room was well appointed and the balcony was a peaceful retreat. I am in the process of booking a return visit in March.

<Title>“LOVED our stay at La Tortuga Hotel!”
<Content>We traveled to Mexico in July to celebrate our anniversary. We spent a night in Playa del Carmen and we were lucky enough to book our stay at La Tortuga Hotel. I wouldn't change a thing about this place. It's more of a boutique hotel which makes it private, peaceful and wonderful. Here is a rundown of some of some of our favorite stuff about the hotel and Playa del Carmen: The ROOM: we spent a bit more and booked a swim up room. This was totally worth it. The steps from our patio literally walked down into the pool. It wasn't a typical pool but more of a water path surrounded by vegetation, so it was pretty private and secluded. We ended up hanging out on our patio a lot during our stay. Overall the room was very comfortable and clean. We slept well and space-wise it was just the right size for 2 people. The MINI BAR: I was shocked to find out the price of our beers from the mini bar in our room were only $2/each. Obviously this isn't an all inclusive place but it is so much better and so worth it! Plus, I've never cracked open a mini bar in the states and been happy about the bill I've gotten on check out. The POOL: The pool area in the middle of the hotel is beautiful and meticulously cared for. There really is no large open pools but rather and handful of small pools connected by paths. This makes for both a clean fresh design and a feeling of serenity and privacy. There were both beach beds and plush beach loungers in several of the pools patios. The hotel also has several cool built in couches and benches throughout the pool. The STAFF: from the moment we arrived everyone was friendly and new our name. They handed us umbrella beverages the minute we hit the lobby for check in and the service standard never dropped from that point. That's more than I can say for some all-inclusives and bigger named/chain hotels I've been too. No KIDS: I believe the policy is that no one under the age of 16 can check into the hotel. Since we were looking for an adult escape this completely fit for us. The pools and courtyard area are just too small and quaint for kids to enjoy anyway. The PERKS: Upon check in we were giving 2 beach passes to a club at the beach. When we arrived at the beach we gave them our pass and they gave us 2 chairs and a palapa (umbrella) for shade. We also enjoyed a complimentary breakfast and the restaurant on site. I thought that would mean buffet but it was actually our choice of almost everything on their breakfast menu. The LOCATION: La Tortuga does not sit on the beach but it was a short walk down the main pedestrian drag to the beach. Even in July it was not a bad walk. I've never been to Playa del Carmen but hands down I loved it. We did Cancun last year and it was all inclusive which had it's perks but for most part wasn't satisfying. Playa del Carmen feels less resort-y and has managed to keep at least part of it's town feel. 5th is the main pedestrian drag and I was really impressed with the decor of all most all of the bars and restaurants. No plastic chairs or giant lobsters to be seen. The decor of most of the establishments was pretty chic. Also, the prices at most of the places were great. We splurged on a booze and surf and turf and only spent about $70 for 2 people. I highly recommend both Playa del Carmen and La Tortuga Hotel as a vacation destination. I'm already planning for my return visit.

<Title>“Solid hotel in Playa del Carmen”
<Content>We decided to stay here after reading so many great reviews on TripAdvisor, and also because we saw they offered pretty good last minute deals. We ended up being able to get a Junior Suite room because of the last minute prices. The staff was very friendly throughout our stay there – from our booking phone conversation to check in to check out. The waiters all had great senses of humor as well. The room was pretty good. There was not a lot of natural light, which was a little disappointing, but I think the fact that we had air conditioning made up for it. We also had an incredible bathroom, which even had a Jacuzzi. Some of the Junior Suite rooms have Jacuzzis on their balcony. I think our room also offered a lot of privacy. Many of the rooms surround the pool, which is very pretty at night. Our package deal included breakfast, beach towels, and passes to two different beach clubs. The breakfast turned out to be great, especially because it was so big that we often just skipped lunch. Of the two beach clubs, we liked Mamitas better. They played better music and had better quality beach chairs and beds. The beach gets pretty crowded, so it’s best to arrive by 10:30am. I would recommend La Tortuga as a good place to stay in Playa.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel”
<Content>La Tortuga is an excellent hotel all around. The details of the environment are inviting and warm, it’s the perfect place to make you feel like you are in your own oasis. The staff was friendly and courteous, Marco the bartender was FABALOUS and Miguel at the front desk always helped me and my boyfriend find something to do. The location is ideal for restaurants and lounges and Mamimatas beach club was clean and delightful. My boyfriend and I will definitely return to La Tortuga.

<Title>“Super, great value, excellent service and staff”
<Content>La Tortuga actually has a TripAdvisor award for best service and it shows! They offer excellent service, pampering their guests, making you feel important. Had a nice welcome with cocktail. They showed us different types of available rooms and for us, the standard room looked even better than the standard plus (bit larger). The hotel restaurant is really good, enjoyed our complimentary breakfast in the morning and we even went dining there in the evening. I can also recommend the spa, very nice massage! The people working in the hotel (bar/restaurant) were all very friendly. Excellent location, just walking distance from the main street (5th street). La Tortuga offers you free towels, chair and umbrella at one of the best spots available at the playa! No disappointments what so ever for this hotel.

<Title>“Great oasis in Playa!”
<Content>My fiancé and I spent a week in Playa... 3 nights at Tortuga & 4 nights at The Royal. We found Tortuga to be a wonderful oasis in town, with clean facilities and friendly staff. The rooms were comfortable & clean. The pool area was well kept and relaxing. After asking about the cold jacuzzi, they were fixing it right away. tortuga is a great hotel for those looking for a smaller, quiet boutique hotel. We enjoyed the local fare recommended by hotel staff... El Fagon and La Pesca. El Bistro was great too. The breakfast was great and dinner was even better. I'd recommend the seared tuna nachos- amazing!

<Content>Except for tropical depression which checked out a few days before our arrival - a great time. Great staff, clean and comfortable rooms. Hotel is close (but not too close) to everything. No noise problems. Hotel resturant was good and reasonably priced. Would recommend (or return again) with no reservations.

<Title>“Second time I have stayed here and will come back again”
<Content>This is the second time in less than a year I have been to Playa and both times I have stayed here. When I come back I will stay here again. (I am a pretty picky person). This time I traveled with my teenage sons. They loved it too. The hotel is at a great location, one block off fifth street where everything is happening, close to the beach, close to everything. The hotel has a central open courtyard with a gorgeous pool, landscaping, bar and restaurant. Has very upscale yet relaxing tropical vibe. We spent some time every day chilling in the pool. We had a swim up suite and were able to get in the pool right from our balcony. The food here is amazing. Breakfast is included, make sure to try the montelenos and have a fruit water as well, you will be hooked. Marco provides an exceptional happy hour from 5-7, drinks are 2 for 1. The staff is incredible and service is exceptional. ALL the staff greeted us by name, always went the extra mile, really seemed interested in us and went out of their way over and over. As others have mentioned, the rooms are adequate and clean, not palatial. The beds are comfortable and nice. Aside from sleeping, we spent little time in the room, we were on vacation! The hotel is very clean, teams of people are cleaning and landscaping continually. As mentioned in other reviews, there is a slight mustiness that can be detected from time to time due to the humidity. It is the area/climate, not the hotel or lack of cleanliness. This is Mexico, it feels like Mexico. If you are looking for a fancy all inclusive where you don't leave the grounds, don't mind spending your vacation budget on accommodations or plan on spending your vacation in your room, an all inclusive may be a better choice for you. If you would like to take part in the many things to do in Playa/Cozumel/Telum, enjoy the many restaurants, are looking for a great place to chill and want to have money left to enjoy your vacation, this is the spot. There are so many great things to do here, don't miss them! We booked on line and pre-payed and saved 25%. We had a wonderful vacation and I can't wait to come back.

<Content>Stunning hotel with incredibly gracious staff. Spent hours by the pool sipping on delicious margaritas! The only heads-up.... the Tortuga gives its guests a pass for a free chair/umbrella on the beach, however, when I went (on a weekend) the beach was swarming with visitors and no chairs were available. Go early if you want a chair/umbrella!

<Content>From the reviews on Tripadvisor we chose La Tortuga and were not disappointed. Great staff ( Marco, Daniel, Jose, Miguel, Morgana, Bernie, Rosita). Excellent location. The property was beautiful and well maintained. The swimming pool was excellent and beautifully landscaped. And did I mention Marco? He was the best ! Happy hour with friends we met duiring our stay was one of the highlights of our trip thanks to Marco. El Bistro was excellent and we looked forward to our breakfast each morning. Only downside was the darkness of the room and a little noisy in the morning if facing 10th Avenue. We will look forward to returning and staying again at La Tortuga!

<Title>“Seven-star service, Five-star price, Three-star hotel”
<Content>We've always relied on TripAdviser, discounting the over-the-top and way-at-the-bottom reviews, but this time we're down there at the bottom too. We booked a Superior room with balcony - admittedly the weather was dismal for most of our stay - but the room was remarkably small, even cramped, for the price, the balcony not much better; the pool was artfully designed to look at but hopeless for swimming in (dunking was OK but that's about it); and the breakfasts were unimaginative and, after a few days, frankly dull. The beach club was fine if you like regimented sunbeds, overpriced drinks and blaring music (and if you get there early enough to snag a bed). But the hotel staff were, as everyone says, simply wonderful - courteous, attentive and ever-helpful. This may all be coloured by our despair at Playa itself; this was our first time on the Caribbean coast after years of travelling up and down Mexico's Pacific coast, and we much prefer the latter.... Playa has the reputation of being much nicer than Cancun, but God knows what Cancun must be like. Fifth Avenue turns its back on the beach and the ocean, and the shops repeat themselves in frenzied monotony; the high-end restaurants were good (but very high-end); and at the base of the street a US/Euro designer mall (though at least in the open air) -- overall this felt like a million miles from the Mexico we've come to know and love. Never again.

<Content>A pristine, small tropical hotel perfect for honeymooners or 50th anniversary. State of the art rooms with a great shower and signature bedding. No kids allowed. The beautiful pool is totally designed for adults. Excellent staff, El Bistro Restaurant, and full service. Located one block from Playa's Fifth Avenue. If you like tranquility, this hotel is world class. Ask for a balcony facing the pool and just sit back and relax.

<Title>“Felt like a princess in a dream”
<Content>This was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at--every morning when I woke up, I truly felt like a princess! The rooms were stunning and very comfortable, and the beautiful peaceful swimming pool area truly feels like a world apart from the madness and commotion of Playa Del Carmen--but what really set this hotel apart was the service. I didn't even know what service meant before I stayed here! The concierges were always so helpful and wonderful, and the breakfast at the hotel restaurant is to die for--I recommend the traditional Yucatan egg breakfast the most! Sometimes, in the bar-pool area, there are even free tropical shots! Every detail is so beautifully attended to, I would have been perfectly happy never leaving the hotel during this trip! (But of course the area is wonderful too...) Thank you La Tortuga for everything.

<Title>“One place that is always improving...and it was already great to begin with.”
<Content>I've been coming to this hotel for about six years now...many times each year. It amazes me that there are always improvements being made. It's not like they need to, though because the rooms are always clean and the service is excellent. Another good thing is that they hold on to their staff so it becomes like a family. Fidel, Mikey, Marco, Bernardo and Morgana, Saul....everyone in every position from the restauant to maintenance greets me when I arrive. I really like the way the courtyard and pool is so private...it's like a tropical oasis. It's not a place for small children so it stays peacful and quiet almost all the time yet close to the heart of Playa.

<Title>“Better than an all inclusive!”
<Content>Room had all the basics you need (bed, shower, w.c.). Ambiance is what this place has more so then the big all inclusive resorts. Trust me, my husband and I were traveling with friends for a wedding at the Royal Playa Del Carmen, and to save a few bucks we decided on this Trip Advisor pick. It was worth it!!! We wish we would have stayed here the entire time. The pool is a wonderful little oasis away from the world, but the beach and main strip of Play del Carmen are right out the front door.

<Title>“Can't Wait To Go Back!”
<Content>My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our eight night stay at La Tortuga. From the moment we arrived to the time we had to depart we were met by the friendliest, most hospitable staff. The staff was especially helpful in arranging our commute to and from Cancun Airport as well as our exquisite excursions to Chichen Itza and Tulum. With easy (and free) access to Mamita's Beach Club and a hop, skip and a jump away from the bustling La Quinta Avenida, La Tortuga is definitely an ideally located and affordable place to stay while in PDC. Make sure you spend some time at the bar with Marco and Fidel, where you will for sure enjoy your cocktail and the ambiance, perhaps over a game of pool, while chatting it up with friendly people from al over the world! When we go back to Playa there is no doubt in our minds that we will be getting another room at La Tortuga!

<Content>Wonderful hotel, staff is extremely helpful and kind. Love Playa del Carmen... Our new friends, Moraga, Bernado, and Miguel in reception told us about activities related to going to the ruins, Eco-Water parks, the beaches, and the great restaurants is town! The restaurant at the hotel was very good, and the staff , Santiago, Daniel and Roberto were attentive and kind. ALL the staff were awesome and everyone gave us a kind smile and said 'Hola!' every time we saw them! This boutique hotel has a romantic, really quiet and unique jungle feel with the beautiful grounds and a "river" like shaped pool. We had a room with the swim up pool off the patio, it was quiet and relaxing. in a perfect location, two blocks away from the Avenida 5 ! The only negative was that we went in July and it was VERY Hot and Humid... Next time, we will plan to go in to March. Again Awesome trip and served its purpose, to relax and slow down!

<Title>“"One of the best hotels we ever stayed at !!"”
<Content>My wife and I decided to stay at this hotel based on previous reviews on Trip Advisor. An excellent choice! We stayed from May 20-25, before going to Cancun for another 5 days. We were celebrating my wife's birthday on the 24th and were total amazed on how the Hotel went out of their way to make her day special. The entire staff goes way above standard on how to treat their guests. We felt like part of their family by the time we left. It was very hard to say our goodbys. We want to thank the director of the hotel, Jesus. He is without doubt the best hotel manager we have ever come accross in our travels.I told him he should lead classes in the States on how managers should run a hotel. Believe me, he is star quality and others in the hotel business could learn a lot from him. We also want to thank Morgana and Berny at the reception desk for their special efforts in making our stay one of the greatest. Santago and Caamal and Carlos at breakfast were wonderful each day and we really enjoyed the meals too. We have to give special thanks to Roberto, Amando, and Paty in the restaurant also. In addition to being great servers, they were very entertaining too. The housekeeping staff was great and my wife got an excellent massage at the hotel one day. As for the hotel itself, it was perfect, exactly what we were looking for. We had a room overlooking the beautiful well taken care of pool which we also enjoyed at night. The room was very clean, we slept great and the location close to 5th Ave was within walking distance of many shops,restaurants and nightclubs. A short walk to the beach although we never made it to Mamitas. A great bonus to this property is the restaurant ; "El Bristo". Excellent and well prepared food. We ate outside near the pool for breakfast each day and even had some special dinners and deserts here. Again, excellent service, wonderful food at this hotel. When we return to Playa and we will, there is no doubt where we will stay. "LA TORTUGA HOTEL!!"

Since we arrived at this hotel, the staff were kind and helpful. We did not even have once any issue with the service at the hotel. I would also recommend the reastaurant -5th ave and shopping centers were just around the corner. -Walking distance to the pier for taxi boats to Cozumel. -2 blocks away from beach. -clubs and bar all around the hotel and still the Hotel was quite and we had no problems with noise at all. -Also free wireless internet which came out handy with Magic Jack lol

<Title>“Maravilloso”
<Content>We go to the Playa del Carmen/Cancun area two to three times a year and usually stay at our resort. Because we love the Playa del Carmen area so much, we decided spur of the moment to do a quick trip up there. Our party consisted of my spouse, my cousin, my 22 year old son and a college buddy of his. At first we booked a room to accommodate the five of us, as the reservation clerk said it would be sufficient for our party. To our surprise the two bedrooms were open rooms with no privacy. Two full beds upstairs and one queen bed downstairs, but the two story suite was open concept and very snug for the five of us, once we were able to view the room in person. We went to the front desk to explain the situation thinking they would not be able to accommodate our request. To our surprise they were so NICE and worked with us on finding rooms to suit our needs. They even apologized which we were not expecting because it really wasn't there fault. It was partially ours for not investigating further the lay out of the room when booking the reservation. Needless to say, they room situation for us. The rooms are smaller than what is viewed on the internet but are comfortable and cozy. The first night the air conditioner did not cool as we would have liked it to, so my husband ended up walking and buying a small traveling fan at the nearby Wal-Mart. Once we told them the next morning, they apologized and maintenance came and fixed the problem right away. The free breakfast is tasty and dinner was delicious. The bar area is right by the pool and has a computer with free internet access. The hotel is down the street from Coco Bongo and within walking distance to Quinta Avenida and the beach. We felt very safe in the area while walking and people were so friendly. Across the street was a laundry mat where the owner charged us $4.00 to wash all our clothes. She charged by the pound which was very cheap. This was great because we did not have to come back home and do all kinds of laundry. It is not a hotel that accepts children, so we will not be able to come with our seven year old but we will definitely be back when it is just me and my husband.

<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga at the end of June, and could not be happier with our choice. The hotel is very clean, and the service is outstanding. The hotel staff is extremely friendly, and will go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and happy. The food at El Bistro is very good, especially the breakfast every morning - even after a week we were looking forward to breakfast. As other reviewers have noted, the rooms are a bit smaller than you may be used to, but the balconies and common bar / pool area more than make up for it. We would recommend this hotel to others, and would definitely return.

<Title>“Great pool and the best staff!”
<Content>We had a last minute reservation at La Tortuga, booked an hour before we arived and didn't really know what to expect. We arrived at 12 noon, and they had our room ready 15 minutes later after we had enjoyed a complimentary fruit drink on arrival. Steps led from the balcony straight into the lagoon style pool (not all rooms have this) and the pool was clean, refreshing and very well laid out. Every member of staff smiled and greeted us as we walked by, the bar and resteraunt staff were great, the receptionist very helpful and knowledgable, helping us track down great coffee and answering all sorts of questions about the area and the hotel. Onsite spa facilities offer relaxing massages at reasonable rates, which was a great perk and well utilised after we had spent many days hiking around ruins! We loved our stay here, location is pretty good too - not far at all from the beach and calle 5, the central shopping street in Playa. We will definitely stay again, after being treated so well and enjoying the hotel facilities so much.

<Title>“A great little hotel”
<Content>My friend has a rare talent of finding hidden hotels that worth their weight in gold, and this one I think was one of the most memorable! There were a group of 6 of us, and we all agreed that it was a steal for the high quality and location it offered! The food was great (I recommend the steaks, they are brilliant here) and the staff just went out of their way to be friendly and accommodating. The room was amazing, we had one with a Jacuzzi outside and a private covered lounge area on the ground floor. Very romantic :) The area isn’t smack bang in the busiest part of the town but set around one or two streets off the main walk about 2-5 minutes walk from the restaurants and bars. Its not heavily populated by the Brits either, and as a Brit myself I found this quite refreshing. The cocktails at the bar of an evening were fab, and the pool and surrounding area was always spotless. I was also a big fan of the little geckos that scurry around the place, they are fast movers though! Got up and close to one when it fell of out a tree and landed in the book I was reading at the time. Slightly concussed, it STILL managed to get away for I could catch it. Boo! :) One thing, I would say have a wonder down the street if you are looking for excusions, they might work out cheaper! People, 500 ‘excellent’ rating’s can’t be wrong, I really recommend this hotel!

<Title>“Great Time... Will Be Back!!”
<Content>We recently returned from our 1st trip to Playa Del Carmen, stayed at La Tortuga & it was even better than we had expected. Most of the reviews here are spot on. The staff goes above & beyond for you, our Jacuzzi Suite was absolutely adorable, El Bistro was the best restaurant we dined at in all of PDC - we had breakfast here every day (included in the room rate). Be sure to get Mango Mojitos at the bar - they are excellent!! We did have an issue w/ the A/C - it leaked every day of our stay. I guess they were having a problem w/ a few on the 3rd floor, but it did not put a damper on our stay. The wonderful service & friendly staff more than made up for it. This was a great home base for all the activities we did - Xcaret, Xelha, Tulum, Cozumel etc... We are in the process in planning a return trip to PDC & will definitely be staying at La Tortuga again. Stay here - you will not regret it!

<Title>“Amazing time at La Tortuga in Playa del Carmen”
<Content>I am so glad I read all the great reviews on Trip Advisor and chose to stay at La Tortuga. This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in and the most relaxing vacations I've had. We stayed here for a week and it was amazing. The hotel is beautiful and very well kept. The beds and pillows are soo comfortable. It's in a great location, close to shopping, restaurants and all the action downtown. I had my doubts about the hotel not being located right on the beach. But the beach is easy to get to. The service and staff were great. El Bistro was also one of our favorite restaurants that we ate at in Playa. We had breakfast here every morning which was included with our room rate. The breakfast is soo good and the staff at El Bistro was so nice and professional. We also had dinner there too one night. The mango shrimp was soo good! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone going to Playa del Carmen. And I can't wait until I can go back!! Thanks again to everyone at La Tortuga.

<Title>“Beautiful Wedding and Honeymoon at La Tortuga Hotel”
<Content>My wife and I picked Playa Del Carmen out of the blue as the place to have our destination wedding. Then, we chose La Tortuga Hotel as the location to have the actual wedding ceremony. We were definitely nervous in both decisions, but could not have been happier with both the wedding ceremony at the hotel and for choosing beautiful Playa Del Carmen. First of all, Playa is absolutely gorgeous: beautiful white beaches, warm clear blue water, wonderful restaurants, great bars and clubs and hundreds of excursions and water sports to choose from for your leisure. The Mexican people were extremely friendly and polite, ready to assist us in anyway they could. I never felt unsafe or anything like that the entire trip. Secondly, the Hotel La Tortuga will forever be a special place in our hearts. Our experience lasted 10 days and was a magical time. We had our wedding ceremony at the gorgeous pool area, right on the deck. Everyone at the hotel pitched in and it went off without any problems. It was actually very beautiful moment for us that will live in our hearts and minds forever. Roberto, fabulous waiter in the fabulous El Bistro Restaurant at the hotel, actually videotaped the entire ceremony for us. Marco made us drinks before and after the ceremony and they were perfect as always. The staff made sure everything was taken care of for our big moment, and it was. La Tortuga is a beauifully manicured hotel, very clean and well taken care of by the hard working staff on a daily basis. The service is second to none, starting with Morgana (she rocks), Bernie and Anna at the front desk will take care of everything for you from providing the beach passes to arranging a waterfront dinner at Wickey's. They strive to do everything they can to make your trip easy and stressfree. Morgana and Bernie will take great care of you. Just ask them for whatever you may need. The pool bar is a hot spot not just for happy hour, but we found ourselves partying with the best bartendar in Playa, Marco, throughout the day and evening. Marco, not only makes a great drink, but became a good friend that we truly enjoyed meeting. He is very personable and makes you the best "Mexican Water" in Playa. Fidel is another bartendar that was very good and polite. The restaurant, "El Bistro", is definitely a gem at the hotel. Your free breakfast, (is not some continental Holiday Inn) but rather a great selection of tasty dishes made to your liking and served by excellent staff members, like Daniel and Mario, to name a few. In the afternoon and evening is where you will find the restaurant amp up and come alive with the lights from " The Jungle", (pool area), offering a beautiful and romantic setting that is second to none. The menu is great and food is even better. There was'nt one dish we had that was not absolutely fantastic. The service you will receive is truly the five star treatment. Trust me, I know, we ate their 12 times. This is where we met our great friends Roberto, Amado and Patricia. I may be leaving out a few people, but they were all awesome. We especially loved Roberto and Amado, who took it upon themselves to be sure our stay was first class and all our needs were met above and beyond their responsibilities. We think of them as our good friends and thank them so much for taking such great care of us for 10 days. You cannot get much better than Roberto and Amado. We look forward to seeing them on our next visit, our 1 year anniversary, June 1, 2011. My only regret is that I could not catch Amado and throw him in the pool, he is too fast. The SPA at the hotel is a must. The ladies there give the best massage we have ever had, at very reasonable rates. Overall, Playa is a great choice for your vacation. You will not be disappointed with La Tortuga Hotel, whatsoever. The location is one block from the hot spot of 5th Avenue and two blocks from the beaches. It may not be right on the beach, but you will forget all about that minor detail when you experience the beauty of this little place, the phenominal service, wonderful staff, great bar and first class restaurant. Outside of the hotel, here is your guide: Go to Kool for the beach day, great service, thick padded chairs, great pool and perfect location. You are one block from the hot spots for nightlife. Coco Bongo is a show that you will never forget. Check out the watersports at Kool, there are many to choose from for very reasonable prices. Fusion is a good restaurant on the beach, of course Wickey's is the place to spend that one night out for luxury dining. Blue Parrot bar is pretty cool for lunch and in the evening. The Tequila Barrel actually has sports betting, which enhanced our stay, thanks Lakers!!! Day trip head up to Tulum. The beaches there are mind blowing. Also the ruins offer you the historical piece of your trip. Cozumel is a ferry ride away. Best bet is to rent a little car while your there and go driving up the road on your own for the day. Just remember to chill, relax and watch out for the "Mexican Water", it will take you to places you have never experienced. That's TEQUILA for you new people to Playa. Ask Marco, he will you show you the way.Thank you La Tortuga for a dream wedding and vacation. See you in 356 days!!!!!! Tequila!

<Title>“Great time at Tortuga - want to come back”
<Content>We stayed at Tortuga for 6 nights in a swim up room. What a great idea. It was so relaxing to go straight from our room into the water. The rooms were a little on the small side but as weren't there much so it wasn't too bad. The maids were excellent in keeping the room tidy and clean and leaving towel creations on the bed for us. I think the decor and bedding could do with an upgrade. The location is perfect. Two blocks from the beach and one block from 5th Avenue, you couldn't ask for a better location. The hotel is intimate, relaxed and personal. Its not a 600 room resort on the beach. You can easily be at the beach in five minutes (walking) and 5th Avenue in one minute. Who needs an all inclusive package with so many fantastic local restaurants to chose from at great prices. This was one of the reasons we chose Tortuga as we didn't want an all inclusive package. We did eat at the hotel restaurant (El Bistro) two out of six nights but the rest we dined on or around 5th Avenue. It is very close to Congo Bongo nightclub but we didn't have any problems with the noise. All the staff are lovely and very friendly, they really go out of their way to make sure you have a fantastic holiday but they also want to get to know you. I think Mexicans are the friendliest culture I have ever met. We had a few happy hours at the hotel and Marco and Fidel were wonderful. Not only did they make fantastic cocktails but they take the time to have a conversation with you and get to know you. We enjoyed our happy hour with them. Breakfast every morning (included in the room tariff) was wonderful. We had Santiago for most of our mornings and as we couldn't speak Spanish he wrote down the basics on a piece of paper for us. He got us speaking the language and was only too kind to help out with our questions. On our last day Fidel, Marco and Santiago came over to us to say goodbye as we were waiting for our car to pick us up. Overall I absolutely loved his hotel. The rooms were small but cozy, the pool spread out around the hotel and not full of people, the location is superb and the staff were incredible. Highly recommend Tortuga if you want to stay away from the large resorts and great value for money.

<Title>“Great Honey moon memories”
<Content>I should have written this review last year around June 2009, but I didn't. I guess coming upon the one year anniversary of marriage started me to revisiting the great time I had at La Tortuga for my honeymoon. We stayed for one week from June 22nd to June 29, and every aspect of the positive reviews that I read on trip advisor was accurate. By writing this I hope I'm able to encourage honeymooners to book this trip and enjoy PDC at its best. First, let me begin by mentioning that I had some difficulty booking through pay pal. I don't think that there was anything wrong with the hotel but pay pa itself. I explained my situation to Anna, who was our contact, at that time, and they allowed me to wire over a payment. The payment didn't process before we left and I was a little anxious, but they reassured me that everything would be fine. We arrived through a hotel ordered transportation and rode the 45 minute ride through Mexico to the hotel. Our driver was Poncho and he was really cool, explaining the sites and such. But this is probably what you must of heard already. What was really noteworthy to me and my wife was the fact that they didn't annoy us because I wire did not transfer. In fact it didn't go through until the final day of our trip. Instead when I would ask every morning they would tell me to just relax and enjoy my honeymoon. That said alot. Our room was immaculate and we had the best champagne and cheese and fruit after our travel. We stayed in our room from the afternoon we arrived till late. And actually, although we took excursions to tulum and xel-ha, which is awesome awesome awesome, we really just enjoyed relaxing near the pool and bar. It was great, affordable and we really felt catered too. It was worth it. And it was the right choice. I hope that if you are choosing a honeymoon spot, you choose this place. We will return on our fifth year anniversary.

<Title>“LOVED This Hotel!!! I miss La Tortuga!!!!”
<Content>I don't even know where to begin when it comes to this hotel. All the reviews on Trip Advisor are right on. My husband and I stayed here from May 9th to May 14th. We had an awesome time and I can't say enough things about this cute little hotel. When we arrived, check in went so smooth and quick thanks to Morgana and Miguel. We were given all of our information and some delicious cocktails before we were on our way to Room #34. As some have mentioned previously, the standard rooms are small but we are not in our room much on vacation. Just to sleep and changed so that did not bother us. The beds were comfortable and the rooms are VERY Clean. Our housekeeper, Rosa did a fantastic job! We enjoyed happy hour with Fidel and Marco almost every evening. There are two things that made this hotel awesome for me...the staff was number one. Whatever we asked for it was never more than a 2-5min wait. Things were taken care of right away. Walking around the hotel we were always greeted with a smile and Hola! The servers at El Bistro were awesome (You have to try the Apple Flambe-I had it twice). The food is also reasonably priced. The 2nd things we loved was, location, location, location! This Hotel is on 10th and 14th. It is one block away from 5th Ave and all the hussle and bussle of PDC. NEVER did we feel unsafe walking around. A few times we came back to the hotel past midnight and we always felt safe. This was our 1st time to Playa and one of our favorite trips. Not only due to location but b/c of the hotel. We met some great people that were staying there also. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. But the pictures really do speak for themselves....Miss you La Tortuga!!!

<Title>“Totally Awesome...Worth Every Penny (or Peso)”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here for too short of a time. We had a week to stay in PDC, but wanted to try different hotels during our stay; A mistake. The staff at La Tortuga greet you upon arrival with air conditioning, a cool tropical drink and fantastic hospitality. We upgraded our room to the "swim out" room. This was awesome as we had a great view of the courtyard. I highly recommend this option. The bar is small but the right size for those of us who grab your drink and swim, lay in the sun, or sit around the outskirts of the courtyard and read. We had two fantastic bar tenders, Marcos and Vidal. They made awesome drinks and had great personalities. The Bistro serves good fresh bistro food. They have a nice mix of pastas, meats, soups, etc. The rooms while a little on the smaller side, are totally adequate for anything you might need. This place is a total bargain. If my wife and I return to PDC, we will totally stay at La Tortuga.

<Title>“great location, great service”
<Content>The reviews of La Tortuga are spot on. The location could not be better. It is one block from the center of 5th ave. shopping/restaurant district. The grounds and pool are lovely. Every single person who works there is friendly and helpful. The rooms are not luxurious, but they are clean and nice. The only downsides.... we couldn't get a good internet connection. There is one computer near the bar, which was always occupied. For some people, this may not be a problem, but we left our small kids at home and I had hoped to use our laptop to check in. We also had a spa massage and while the staff was very nice, I'd have to call that a "backrub". I don't think this is uncommon for hotel spas, but if you are looking for a real massage, this is not it. The restaurant breakfast (included) was sensational. I wasn't crazy about the dinner, but I'll save that for the Bistro review. In all, a wonderful place to stay in the heart of PDC. Will return.

<Title>“Awesome Boutique Hotel”
<Content>Wonderful boutique hotel in Playa del Carmen. Excellent location, great staff - very friendly, attentive and helpful. The hotel is very clean and the pool area ws an oasis. Happy hour is from 5pm to 7pm daily and the bartenders (Marco & Fidel) were fantastic. There is a computer & printer at the bar for guests free of charge and wireless throughout the property for those bringing their own laptops. Breakfast is included at the conveniently-attached restaurant, El Bistro. We had a standard plus room with a balcony overlooking the pool. It was on the small side, but did accommodate a king-size bed. It did not have any kind of dresser for clothes, but had a closet with long-hanging space on one side; and shelves, a safe and mini-bar on the other. Bathroom was average size with just a shower but very clean. Hotel is not on the beach, but you can get vouchers from reception for free chairs & umbrella/palapas at the nearby beach Mamita's. It is one block away from the main tourist street of 5th Avenue so much quieter location, they are located by the club Coco Bongo so at night you do hear the bass from the music, but nothing to keep you awake or cause sleeplesness. We are planning on returning in November and will stay at La Tortuga again.

<Title>“A Good Place to Base”
<Content>Upon arrival at La Tortuga we were welcomed with cool and colorful fruit drinks, a welcome refresher from the heat outside. The staff is very helpful and pleasant. We stayed here twice, once on our way to parts south and again on our way back to Cancun airport. The first time we stayed in one of the special suites w/ hot tub....nice touch, but didn't really work well and the water temperature was hard to set. The room faced the street, so it was noisy to sit on the small balcony. On our return trip we booked a regular room, with a room facing the interior courtyard - and this was a great change, much less expensive, functional shower. This hotel has a great location, was quiet, had a good courtyard bar w/ happy hour, breakfast included...but I wouldn't pick it if you want to be on the beach or hang out at the pool. It's a good place to base from and come and go.

<Content>La Tortuga is quiet and peaceful with beautiful surroundings. Its located close to 5th Street and just a few blocks from the beach. The spa, pool and deck are gorgeous and meticulously maintained. The hotel is perfect for a romantic getaway; Our room had a private jacuzzi that looked out over the pool area. The staff is great, friendly and very helpful in planning excursions. I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.

<Title>“best bartender ever!”
<Content>Marco at the bar is a fantastic bartender and makes pretty much the best margaritas that I have ever tasted. He squeezes his own lime juice for them, and they're so good that I never had a hangover once! (don't know how he did that...) The hotel is very guest-friendly and accommodative. The pool temperature was cooler than the ocean, but I enjoyed it, despite the fact that it was rarely used. Perhaps that was due to the volcano that prevented a lot of European guests from arriving. The beds were comfortable and the pillows just awesome.

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel, what a find!”
<Content>There is nothing to fault at La Tortuga! The service, food, and location were all fantastic. Although you can hear a little noise from the main road at night, this is what I had expected for chosing to stay somewhere so close to all the action. The staff were extremely friendly and helped with local recommendations on where to eat and things to do during the day. A visit to El Fogon restaurant to sample real Mexican food is a must, as well as Marco's cocktails by the beautiful pool at night. I would definitely return to La Tortuga and would recommend it as a perfect hotel to stay for a holiday that offers both relaxation by the sea, culture at the Mayan ruins and tonnes of activities for those not wanting to stay in an all inclusive.

<Title>“Great time in Playa”
<Content>We had a great time in PDC. La Tortuga was a great place to stay. The location was perfect and the pool area was beautiful. I would have like to have had more use out of the pool - but the water was just too cold. The hot tub was just right for me - but usually occupied by other guests. We did stay in a suite with roof top jacuzzi - but we didn't use it that much. The first time we tried there was no hot water. The second time there was hot water but it took a while to fill. It just was something I didn't want to deal with on a regular basis. Our room was quite and large, sparsely decorated - but I'm okay with that. The bathroom was beautiful with a giant soaking tub/shower. Best part for me, by far, was breakfast. I had egg enchiladas every morning (the mole was great!) while my husband had yogurt and granola. The selection of fruit juices was amazing - we both settled in on the papaya as our favorite. We had the chance to eat at the restaurant for lunch and also the 5th ave location for dinner. Both of those meals were very good! The staff at the hotel were all nice. Others have mentioned problems sleeping because of the noise. I generally sleep like &%^ but slept like a baby while we were there. For me the A/C was enough to block everything out - along with general tiredness from long days in the warmth. We ended up not using either of the beach clubs that the hotel has agreements with. Mamitas wasn't our scene. Zenzi looked great but they had more of a futon style loungers that you couldn't really reposition to stay in the shade (a must for both of us!). We ended up spending 3 days at Wicky's next to Zenzi. That was fine for us - decent food, somewhat slow - but friendly service, and good, low key live music. At Wicky's you paid 50 pesos for an umbrella and then you had to spend at least 100 pesos per person on food/drink. La Tortuga was nice and we had a good time but I'm not sure that I would stay there again just because of the price. For our room category, at over 300/night, I just didn't feel like it was a good enough value to do it again.

<Title>“Great little hotel”
<Content>Three of us were travelling together, we had had a week in Panama then two weeks in Mexico. This was the fifth hotel in Mexico – all very different. We don’t do beach/disco type holidays, rather cultural and environmental (in this case seeing a number of Maya historical sites – truly amazing). This was definitely not the sort of hotel we normally stay in, nor the resort. BUT it was by far the best hotel we stayed in in Mexico. Firstly it was clean, we had more than two water glasses and (joy of joy) we had a plug in the wash basin in the bathroom. The other hotels had all been four/five star, by the way. We had a ground floor “Swim-up room”, we faced on to the central pool/bar area with the pool up to our outside sitting area although we didn’t actually swim from/to our room, but could have done. All the staff were really nice and helpful. A couple of little instances – when the three of us arrived and went into reception the young lady there immediately got up and got an extra chair so that we could all sit down. Later I was using the computer in the bar area and trying to see if the little printer was switched on (there was no on/off light), there were no staff around but a lady came up to me to see if she could help, she then told me she didn’t really know about this but if I dialled “0” someone would come and help me. In some previous hotels in Mexico the staff seemed either indifferent and usually positively chose not to see things. We had dinner in the restaurant, very good food and reasonably priced with very good helpful staff. We had a most enjoyable evening so ate there again the next night. The staff recognised us and spoke to us; another enjoyable evening. On both nights the restaurant was very busy. The gentleman who was the general manager was often walking around checking on things, I spoke to him and complemented him on his staff.

<Title>“2ND Time at La Tortuga, will be going back soon.”
<Content>I can't say enough about this hotel, the staff is the best. From Marco and Fidel at the Bar, Bernie and Miquel at Reception and the whole wait staff at El Bistro. We will be going back for years to come. No other hotel we have ever stayed at offers what this one does. They are a small botique hotel, because of this they are able to provide excellent service. It had been almost a year since our last visit, well we must have made quite an impression because Fidel remembered us instantly. Thanks everyone at La Tortuga, Will see you all again soon.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay!”
<Content>First and foremost: TOP NOTCH service! The entire staff is helpful, friendly and looks like they enjoy being there! The hotel itself is gorgeous. From the moment you walk in you forget that you aren't ON the beach. The pool is beautiful, but could've used a little bit of heat. Since the sun doesn't spend too much time on it during the day it is rather cold. The decor is tasteful and thoughtful, everything really compliments their style and the delightful ambiance. It's definitely relaxing. We chose to stay in a swim-up room and I am glad we did. We were in Room 108 - in the swim-up room closest to the bar and although I was worried about that, it wasn't a problem. In fact, I believe we had the largest patio! Although we didnt have French Doors leading to our balcony, we had a private patio area with our door to the outside, a table, two chairs and a couch built into the wall. It was fabulous! When we arrived the TV didnt work so they replaced it immediately. The AC was AWESOME - remote controlled with all kinds of settings. And the bathroom was well stocked. To be noted - the items in the mini-bar were fairly priced and the drinks at the hotel bar were fairly priced as well. 2 for 1 during happy hour makes them approx. $2-$2.50 US. Our complimentary breakfast each day was great. Especially since it's offered until noon. Thank you guys for that! Seriously thank you. The best part of breakfast is being allowed a hot and cold beverage along with your meal. **The juices are AMAZING** We stayed for seven nights and my husband still hadn't tried them all! The hotel is relaxed and quiet, the guests are friendly and I enjoyed that it was adults only immensely. However, Coco Bongo is literally next door - only a vacant lot separates the two properties so you softly hear the music until 4am. However, once you're inside your room with the AC on, it disappears. Since we are club goers this didn't bother us. Another benefit to this hotel is that it is located on 14th, and all of the clubs are on 12th. It is also on 10th, and all of the shops are on 5th. So you are one block from the avenue where everything happens and two blocks from all the clubs. Similarly, you are about a four block walk to the beach. Mamitas is kind of a walk and there are other places that are less crowded. I recommend Zenzi beach club. The chairs are cheap and La Tortuga guests receive a discount on chairs. It's about the same distance but it's less crowded! Definitely explore this hotel as an option. If you aren't looking to stay on the beach this is my recommendation! :)

<Title>“Great service and atmosphere”
<Content>We could only stay one night but if I had to do it over I would have stayed longer. La Tortuga was one of three places we stayed. LT has the best service and attitude of service of any of the three places we stayed. The room was clean, charming and very comfortable.We did not have our luggage the first day and the hotel staff was kind and considerate and provided phone assistance with the baggage claim personell at the airport. Stay here and check out lovely Playa Del Carmen...you will not regret it.

<Title>“A pleasant, charming hotel...”
<Content>La Tortuga is a pleasant, charming hotel perfectly situated one short block from the approximate center-point of 5th Avenue. The hotel strikes a nice balance between upscale and casual. The staff are well-trained and attentive without being overly doting. The architecture is open-air yet very intimate with numerous nooks and crannies to escape to. The pool area is beautiful, quiet, lushly landscaped and very well maintained. This is not a hotel for an action-packed day around the pool but rather for a quiet, contemplative respite from the hustle and bustle of Playa. We booked a junior suite with a (very) private rooftop jacuzzi and sun bed. Anna did an excellent job of coaching us through room choices via email and we were well-pleased with the result. As noted by others, our room was modestly-sized but very clean and well maintained. We rarely used the air conditioner as the overhead fan kept us cool enough. There were really only two minor things we would suggest as improvements. The bathrooms could use more shelf space and towel hooks, and the pillows were a little too thick for our preference. El Bistro restaurants (under the same ownership as La Tortuga) are truly among Playa's best. Breakfasts are excellent, plentiful and free (with our room anyway). You could easily eat something new every day for a week or two. Dinners are outstanding in both locations and reasonably priced. The wait staff are engaging and enthusiastic about their jobs. Our servers, Perla and Morgana, were both so personable and pleasant that we found ourselves returning as much for their company as for the excellent food. We have traveled to Playa several times over the past ten+ years. It has certainly changed over the years, but in many ways for the better. If you want a hotel that is beautiful, romantic, close to restaurants, shopping and the beach, yet quiet and out of the way, you will not do better than La Tortuga hotel. Other restaurants we experienced that are worth noting follow. Read carefully as they are very different from one another but we enjoy a wide range of experiences when we travel. Las Brisas: This authentic, open air Mexican restaurant will not be for everyone as it is definitely NOT elegant and upscale. But if you want the best guacamole and chips in town, give it a try. We also highly recommend the fried, whole grouper for an authentic Mexican experience. Yaxche: Extremely imaginitive Mayan food with the most unusual, elegant atmosphere in Playa. This experience is a feast for your eyes as well as your palate. Babes Noodles and Bar: Unpretentious to say the least, but serving excellent Thai and eclectic themed dishes at amazingly low prices. The Red Snapper and Pepper Shrimp were both just wonderful. We wish we had discovered this gem earlier in our trip.

<Title>“Best bang for the buck”
<Content>Would stay here if in PDC Positives: * Located near the best part of 5th avenue * Grounds are beautiful and well-kept...shady in many places during the day giving you a relaxing reprieve from the scorching sun. Solarium or beach passes to Mamitas if you want the sun. * Bartenders are awesome...friendly, made the best, high quality drinks in PDC and the 2-1 happy hour is a great deal. Do your drinking here...I found the drinks in other establishments to be made with cheap liquor and yucky mixers instead of real fruit. * Food at La Bistro was great and very reasonably priced for the quality. Ate dinner there twice and breakfast each morning. Service was good, unlike what others have said. * Rooms were very clean * Truly a great deal when you factor in the free breakfast, beach passes, etc. "Negatives"...and these are very minor * Swim up room was on the small side and basic...but remember you aren't there to spend time in a hotel room anyway so not a big deal. * Spa prices were very high...prices were on par with what you find in the best spas in a major US city. Not sure why when you consider that everything else the hotel had to offer (room $, bar, minibar, restaurant) was reasonable * Pool too cold / hot tub too hot for my liking

<Title>“An oasis in Playa”
<Content>La Tortuga is an oasis of low key tranquility. The courtyard and pool setting are stunning. The whole place is unpretentious, yet elegant. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Our room was spotless. The food in the hotel restaurant was fantastic. And the location was perfect. I could not recommend this hotel more highly- we will be back.

<Title>“Loved La Tortuga”
<Content>I loved La Tortuga. I had never been to downtown Playa Del Carmen before, so I was relying on other Trip Advisor reviewers to help me determine whether this area would be safe and/or intimidating for me. I felt right at home at the hotel. Everyone was very pleasant and personable, much more so than other resorts I have visited in Mexico. The small size allowed for a much more personal experience. The pool area was unique and very charming with a winding pool and hot tub in the center. Pool chairs were comfortable and always available. Was quiet and elegant, not overrun with beach bag toting tourists. The room was lovely. The food was excellent at the Bistro! Loved everything that I had. I used the beach pass to Mamitas twice and although it was rather crowded by the time I got there, it was very nice also. Had lunch there twice and it was very good. Fresh fruit, caprese salads, nice drinks. The walk to the beach club was several blocks, but you could access the beach closer to La Tortuga if you just wanted to walk the beach or use a towel instead of a chair. I really enjoyed the walk to the beach along Fifth Avenue. I was never bothered by any vendors, stopped in several shops and the people were very pleasant. Was really pretty and charming. Would visit there again tomorrow if I could, lol. Thank you La Tortuga for a lovely stay!

<Title>“Can't Wait to Return!”
<Content>Everyone on this board and playa.info was right: La Tortuga is AMAZING! My partner and I stayed here for four nights in March, and it met every expectation. We arrived late in the afternoon and reserved a couples massage at the spa that evening. After our 90 minute massage, we were served a cheese and fruit plate with wine on a double lounger by the pool. it was the perfect way to start the trip. Service was second-to-none. Everyone was friendly. The free beach passes are excellent. The hotel is gay friendly. Seriously, I can't say enough good things about this place. So why not a five star rating? My only complaint is that breakfast takes forever. We sat down one morning at 8:10 for breakfast. The restaurant was 80% empty. We didn't order anything fancy. Our food didn't arrive until 40 minutes later. This happened every morning. Dinner at the restaurant was very different. In a packed restaurant, we got our food piping hot shortly after it was ordered. Not sure why breakfast was so slow, but if you have to get to a tour by a particular time, you should order breakfast early, or plan to eat somewhere else. Other than that, the hotel is incredible. We are already planning our second trip!

<Title>“A very nice private hotel”
<Content>Just returned from La Tortuga, positives and negatives below: Positives – cleanliness and general hotel appearance (spot on) – impressed with the gardens especially. Your staff – all kind and genuine (and hard working) Rooftop solarium – superb for me and my partner as we are not major beach lovers Hotel Position – SPOT ON!! The pool (though for some people it could be too cold – not for me or my partner though) WIFI – great, had no problems connecting anywhere I was in the hotel. The weather!! (Only slight) negatives – breakfast (a European style breakfast offering or choice would have been nice, we got bored of mixed omelettes after a fortnight). Air con unit in our room (117) had a slight water-drip problem Club Brahma – AAARGH, the vibrations from the club kept me awake a few times, note this is 2 blocks away from the hotel, if you are taking a Deluxe Junior go for Room 101 (also has a private pool but no rooftop jacuzzi, so whatever you prefer, though you will be further away from the vibrations from the club in room 101). Slight ant infestation problem on the roof top of our junior suite (117) Some English Language channels on the TV please (quite surprising considering the guests seemed mostly to be English speaking) Marmitas Beach Club – was not that impressed – would be nice if the top-paying guests (like us) could have had use of the paid-facilities (such as the larger beds) for free. Note if you have a Deluxe Junior Suite (and want a rooftop jacuzzi) for 116 if you prefer to have a larger private rooftop (which catches the sun earlier and better and has larger sleeping/chill/bed areas). Note if you take 101 you will not have direct access to the main pool (which is more of a water feature to be honest but heaven when you need to chill in the midday heat) and is closer to reception. I would definately recommend the hotel - we felt as if we were the only guest most nights, it felt so relaxed and private. Note I would not decrive this hotel as "trendy" - if you are looking for a more modern hotle then I suggest either Mosquito Blue (note though this is closer to the dreaded Club Brahma so the noise levels could be worse) or Mosquito Beach (actually ON the beach itself). Deseo looks nice but seemed to be a bit devoid of activity. I hope this helps.

<Title>“Cool town - Very Nice Property”
<Content>Would recommend this well located reasonbaly priced small hotel. Excellent front desk and doorman with secure parking across street (150'). Room was clean and well appointed. Mine even had a terrace overlooking 10th Avenue. The Hotel is 1 block from 5th Ave which is the several block long strip of shops and restaurants. Hotel is at 14th and 10th which places it almost directly in the middle of the the 5th Avenue set up. Playa is much, much more than I expected and a cool diversion form Cancun. Cancun is very nice but Playa is much more quaint than Cancun and the ferry connects to Cozumel.

<Title>“We'll stay here every time we travel to Playa.”
<Content>This hotel was recommended to us by a friend who travels to Playa often. We had a wonderful stay. The hotel is very quiet, private and beautiful. We upgraded from a basic room to a room with a balcony. We debated whether we should book a room that you can swim to from the pool but decided against it and are glad we did. We enjoyed being on the second floor overlooking the pool and the beautiful landscaping rather than at pool level, and we used our balcony to read and enjoy the sunshine. Breakfast at The Bistro is included in the price of the hotel. We loved restaurant, which includes outdoor seating in the hotel courtyard. Breakfast ranges from fresh Mexican fare to fresh fruits and toast. Fresh smoothies, juices, coffee and teas are also available. The service at the restaurant is excellent--try to sit in Daniel's section! We also ate dinner at the restaurant a couple of nights; we enjoyed dinner as much as the breakfasts. There is also a great bar in the courtyard with two-for-one drinks every night. The bartender was wonderful and definitely added to the lovely atmosphere of our stay. The pool and hot tub are beautiful, and the landscaping is spectacular. Our only complaint is that the pool was a bit cold despite the 80-90 degree weather. We would have spent much more time in the pool had it been a bit warmer. The hotel also includes a beach pass that provides free beach front seats. The beach is about a 2-3 minute walk from the hotel, and the major shopping and restaurant district is less than a block away. The rooms are spacious though I agree with a previous reviewer that the bedding was a bit course and we aired out our room every day when it felt a little humid and dank. The room service was outstanding, however. At night with the balcony doors closed and the fan and air conditioner on we could not hear a thing. Overall we loved our stay at La Tortuga and will definitely go back very soon!

<Title>“Nice bit of luxury at the end of our trip”
<Content>My husband and I had just spent time in Tulum so we wanted some luxury and nightlife in Playa del Carmen. La Tortuga was a perfect choice. The grounds were well kept and beautiful. The hot tub surrounded by the pool was a nice touch. I loved the grounds because they were designed such that small groups or couples could find a little nook or cranny and it would be a perfectly private area. We were in a suite, with an AMAZING jacuzzi tub with a large swinging window that opened to an outdoor bed. We took a nap on it and loved it out there so much we contemplated sleeping out there. But the bed...oh my god, the bed was the softest thing I ever slept on. After soaking in the tub at night, we would lay on the best and be snoring in seconds. There was a tiny bit of bass coming from Coco Bongo (I think) but with the AC on I had to strain to hear it. The location is actually very good, a couple seconds from the nicest part of 5th Ave and 2 blocks from the beach. I wouldn't want to stay on 5th Ave or the beach in Playa del Carmen since it seems like it would be VERY noisy. The access to the beach club was perfect, 5 minute walk at most without the hassle of staying right on the beach. Benny and Ivan at the front desk were great, they helped us get our deep sea fishing trip booked. The only criticism I had (and its probably unique to me) was the there was a touch of "overservice" One bartender tried hard to get us into a restaraunt downtown and to give them his card. When we got back at night, we got a couple phone calls which were probably the front desk asking how our stay was but we didn't pick up because we were afraid it was someone trying to sell us on El Bistro. We didn't eat any of the food there since we spent most of our time out, but I just don't like overly attentive service to the point of selling. Otherwise it was an amazing stay and I'm very happy we chose La Tortuga.

<Title>“Comfort and friendliness in the city for good value”
<Content>After making ourselves crazy by reading all the reviews for multiple AIs, we decided to stay in town at a smaller hotel for our first trip to Playa del Carmen. And we were very happy with our decision overall. We used frequent flier miles to get down there and made our reservations online using the hotel website and email. We also arranged for airport transfer using the hotel website form. Payment was through PayPal and very easy. We were sent confirmation and instructions from the hotel. We arrived at the Cancun airport on a Wednesday morning with transport arranged by the hotel for two people. After we made it past (barely) all the blue-shirted salespeople after customs, he was waiting for us outside in a yellow shirt with his name on it just as described in our instructions from the hotel. We rode in a passenger van which was in good condition and our driver offered to stop at a convenience store at the start of the trip in case we wanted to buy drinks or snacks. As we got into Playa, the outskirts of town looked fairly gritty, but the hotel is one block from 5th Ave and the tourist district. Check-in was right at the front entrance and quick with our room being ready immediately, which was lucky since we were pretty tired. We stayed in room 207 (standard plus) with a view if the pool and a small, but nice balcony. The room itself was fairly small but we got used to it and learned to make do by opening the door and windows to make it feel bigger. Air conditioning is not necessary on any but the most humid days... it was 80 degrees most days we were there. Room and bath were very clean and simply appointed but comfortable. Staff is exceeding friendly with pleasant little restaurant and bar. Restaurant is open to the public street which was nice and gave you a sense of not being so closed in. Breakfast is included with voucher from the front desk each morning with several fresh choices and generous portions. We had dinner at El Bistro on just the first night -- pasta with large shrimp and cream sauce and shrimp fajitas, both were very nice. Pool, solarium and bar area at La Tortuga are all very comfortable, pretty and tidy. Pool is not really designed for swimming exercise but is great for cooling off and is fairly large. It was not very crowded while we were there and so we stayed by the pool on several days without even going to the beach. Vouchers are available for both the Mamitas and Zenzi beach clubs. If you get to Mamitas before 10AM you have an OK chance of getting the free beach cots and umbrella. Instructions are not clear on where to go and what to do once you get there, but in general the rules seem to be just grab the first loungers and umbrella you see. The guy managing the chairs will come by and ask for your voucher and then give you a wrist tag which allows access to the bathrooms and shower. If the umbrellas are all taken, you can wait from someone to bring you a lounger and place it near the area you want to lay. There are also big beds available just next to this main area and closer to the hipster lounge/music area. Beds are an extra fee with a minimum purchase of a bottle of liquor for US$100. We ended up with an umbrella near the music and although the music in the morning as great (Brazilian jazz, etc.) it got a little too loud and eventually left. Zenzi is much closer to the hotel and a lot smaller but you pay about 50 pesos for each chair and another 50 pesos for an umbrella. The rule here also seems to be to grab the first open lounger you see, but the guys managing the drinks and chairs are roaming around more frequently than at Mamitas. Supposedly you get your fee back through your drinks order and a 20% discount on drinks with the voucher. Not sure I saw evidence of this, but maybe we drank more than I thought. They had a barbecue lunch on Sunday if you wanted and seemed to be burgers and such for a another fee. My boyfriend liked Zenzi better than Mamitas as he thought it was more laid back, comfortable, smaller, less crowded -- certainly the music was not as loud and they had a live band on Sunday which was fun, playing lots of US covers. Overall La Tortuga was a very pleasant and nice stay with the friendly staff being one of the best aspects. The only things which could have been better would be minor: 1) would be nice if less staff was visible all day working on the pool area and with cleaning carts in our hallway 2) more capacity for bar service at happy hour since it gets busy and 3) room was a tad small small. We did look in on a smaller hotel right on the beach and decided we La Tortuga was much nicer. We would recommend La Tortuga to anyone looking to avoid the AI experience and to get a chance to see the town and sample some local food at the smaller restaurants off the strip.

<Content>We enjoyed our stay at the La Tortuga. The breakfast at the Bistro cafe was very good. We really didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel, but the hotel was within walking distance to everything we did: shopping, eating out, the beach, socializing with friends. I also appreciated the free internet in our room!

<Title>“Pure Paradise”
<Content>My friend and I had spent just over two weeks on the Mayan trail travelling through Mexico, Guatamala and Belize. We knew that our accommodation en route could be fairly basic and that we would be exhausted so wanted to spend a few days of luxury and pampering at the end of our trip in Playa where our tour ended. And that is exactly what we got. Once we had got over the fact that it was possibly the most romantic setting ever (we were friends not a couple!) we couldn't have agreed more that it was the perfect end to our hoilday. Everything from the restaurant (excellent Mexican and International cuisine) to its position in the centre of town (a short stroll to the shops and bars) was just what we wanted. The hotel has an afiliation with three beach clubs we chose the the Blue Cacao which is a cab ride away but well worth the journey. However, without doubt the single best factor was the service which was outstanding. This is an exceptional professionally run hotel that understands and values the importance of customer service. A realy jewel in Playa's crown.

<Title>“Loved it!”
<Content>My 21 year old Daughter and I just spent a wonderful week at Playa and throughly loved our stay at the La Tortuga. The place is a relaxing oasis. We loved everything about it... well mostly... ( a small side note; wish that the bedding was better)... but other than that we loved the La Tortuga and would definetly recommed it. We also stayed in a 5 star inclusive during our stay and preferred the La Tortuga Hotel. At the La Tortuga we felt at home and pampered, unlike the all inclusive (which was nice) but you were one of many and were committed to their food and lack of privacy. The location of the La Tortuga is not on the beach but only a short walk to their beach space which is very nice. The hotel is also just around the corner from all the nicer shopping and resturants that 5th Avenue has to offer. Perfect location yet tucked away from it all.

<Title>“Great place for a break, highly recommended!!”
<Content>My husband and myself choose this hotel based on the comments from Trip Advisor and we really think that they perfectly match with our experience. We spent 11 nights in La Tortuga hotel and we must say that we had the relaxing holiday we were looking for. We had a standard room which was pretty small, however, we spent the whole day on the beach or outside and we only used it for sleeping. The purpose of the trip was to celebrate my husband's birthday and on the arrival day we received a free bottle of local bublie, strawberry cake and a nice flowery decoration on our bed. As already previously mentioned, we cannot praise the staff enough: everyone was always helpful, kind and made you really feel welcome. Special praise as well for the breakfast: a lot of typical Mexican breakfast dishes, and this is what you want to a place like this, for buffet continental breakfast, we can as well stay at home. We had dinner as well in the Bistro, very good food and prices which are not higher than anywhere else. Minibar was cheap as well. The happy hour at the bar was a good occassion to meet some other people in the hotel as well. Only little downside of the hotel: depending where your room may be located, it can get a bit noisy at night, but on the other hand, this is a hotel in the heart of Playa, so this was expected. The spa was pretty expensive, prices similar as in Europe, recommend you to use Veronica's Spa on 5th Avenue. All in all, just believe the comments and stay here if you want something different than the typical resort factory in Playa.

<Title>“Very quaint boutique-style hotel with excellent service”
<Content>We just got done staying at your hotel 1 March through 8 March and we couldn't have been more pleased. At first I thought it was nice but just o.k., but then by the third day the level of service and hospitality was really a stand out. This was our first time not staying at an all-inclusive and I don't think we ever do an all-inclusive again. We were quite pleased with the level of service at your hotel, the attention to detail and the personalized attention. We had a minor problem with our air conditioner which was handled immediately. We were glad to run it because you could hear a little Coco Bongo base from down the street. But I'm a light sleeper. The bathrooms could definitely use some storage space. Perhaps some shelves for personal items, but who spends time in the room anyhow? We felt our swim-up room wasn't the best value because of the unseasonable cool weather Mexico was having at the time. I would say I could use a little less trees near the pool, and perhaps more sunny areas to bask in. We caught a grouper going deep sea fishing and your chef prepared it for us at lunch. We were expecting just grilled fish, but he went above and beyond, putting rice and vegetables with it. Very impressive. Daniel was so sweet to be around at El Bistro, I wanted to take him home. The food at El Bistro never disappointed either. We really enjoyed the atmosphere the hotel provided and the breakfast was great. I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about when he said breakfast wasn't free, because it definitely was. You just needed a voucher from the front desk and you had to select certain entrees. So, not sure what the trouble was there? I also liked the 2 for 1 happy hour, which I never seemed to miss even on my wedding day. Speaking of our wedding, everything we did through Caribbean Blue Wedding was perfect. I forgot to request a flower for my hair on the wedding day and within a half-an-hour of leaving to be married at the beach someone from the front desk sent a young man to get that for me just before I left. INCREDIBLE! Not just a flower, but one that exactly matched my bouquet, was wired into a hair comb with a ribbon, perfect! I thought I was going to cry, I was so happy to have it. You also took care of our return flight confirmation when we couldn't find the flight number on the internet. You folks are wonderful and we've told all our friends about you. Also, Zenzi beach was a 8 minute walk at best. It was literally closer in walking distance that the all-inclusive resorts that claim to be 'right on the beach'. It was nice to have either beach or lounging pool side in case it was too windy. We've told all our friends back home how great it was and would love to be there right now.

<Title>“Nice little place - very friendly and helpful staff”
<Content>Great stay here. I reserved the lowest cost room, and it was basic, with two single beds, but a very nice bathroom, and the room was kept very clean. AC and TV. Lisa from NY at the front desk is a brilliant concierge, and "Dr." Marco at the bar a great friend. The included breakfast at El Bistro was very good - full meal with a smoothie and coffee. There's a PC available for free at the bar, and limited WiFi coverage. Hotel is right near downtown, a few blocks from the beach. Very beautiful, pretty quiet, although Coco Bongo is about a block away, but not too noticeable at night if your door is closed. No gym at the hotel, but there's one nearby. Wish I was there now, next time will go for one of the suites.

<Title>“Absolutely wonderful experience!”
<Content>I just had my first trip to Playa del Carmen, and I was lucky enough to stay at La Tortuga. It is small and quaint, but it is definitely not short on accommodations. I only have wonderful things to say, and I cannot recommend it enough! Excellent atmosphere, service, restaurant, bar, and 2 for 1 happy hour. Beautiful grounds, pool, and spa. Restaurant's food quality was fabulous for either your included breakfast or a more high-end dinner. The staff is more than accommodating and provides impeccable service. Very cute rooms, good beds, plenty of hot water, and just off of busy 5th street so that you don't have to worry about noise. Very short 5 minute walk to Zenzi beach, shopping, and dining. If you are going further, the staff is happy to arrange transportation. I could not have been happier!

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel with Excellent Service”
<Content>We stayed in a Suite with the hottub on the roof for 4 nights in Feb. 2010. The room was very comfortable, the breakfast each morning was steps from our room was great. In fact all the food we ordered at the hotel was made from fresh ingrediants, tasty and nicely presented. The staff at this hotel go out of their way to please. They all work so hard, so don't forget to tip. We even enjoyed a massage at the Spa. I would stay at this hotel again, no questions asked. It's one block from all the action in Playa Del Carmen. Also, a 5 minute walk to the beach makes the location awesome. I don't understand what others say about noise. The only noise I heard is whan I opened the door in the morning and heard the native birds singing.

<Title>“Loved hanging out at La Tortuga”
<Content>We booked La Tortuga based on the glowing Trip Advisor reports, and we were not disappointed. The room itself was good but not great (but well worth the price) but the service was excellent and the hotel facilities were inviting and welcoming and we felt very at home there. The internal pool and lounging area is really nice. We enjoyed the happy hour drinks served by the charming, young Dany . The included breakfast is very good and the reception staff went out of their way with useful advice and onward arrangements. The free internet at the bar was a welcome extra, as was the newspaper reading area. The room itself was immaculately clean and comfortable and the staff made a different flower/towel presentation each day of our stay. The room itself is not particularly upmarket in style but has its own charms, The hotel is linked with Momita's beachclub, and this is a great way to enjoy the beach. Highly recommended!

<Title>“Great Hotel in a Great Location”
<Content>I stayed at La Tortuga from 2/25-3/1 on the recommendation of a friend. I'm glad I took his advice! I stayed in a junior suite with 3 friends. The room was large, comfortable and clean and the grounds of the hotel were beautiful.. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They helped us book excursions and were able to answer our questions about different restaurants in the area and how to get there. El Bistro, the restaurant on site had excellent food but we wanted to venture out a few times. The breakfast that is included with the stay was far beyond what I expected. It wasn't your usual continental breakfast or buffet. Mostly anything from the regular menu + a hot drink (coffee, tea) + a cold drink (juice, fruit-shake) were included. As for the noise that some reviewers complained of: I barely heard anything. We stayed in room 36 which is on the top floor and close to the club next door. If we were on the roof-deck patio we could hear the bass but it wasn't so loud that it was bothersome. Once we were in the room we could barely hear it. PROS: friendly staff, clean rooms, beautiful hotel grounds, restaurant on site was good, awesome free breakfast, location (a few blocks from the beach, within walking distance of restaurants/bars/shops), happy hour in the hotel bar 5-7pm, delicious margaritas & mojitos. CONS: We noticed an odd sewage-like smell on the patio a few times...not constantly but it would waft through from time to time. Also, the jacuzzi drain would not stay closed. We didn't use the jacuzzi till our last night there so we never complained about it. Also there was some confusion about the breakfast vouchers. We either misunderstood or they forgot to tell us about them. No big deal, but you just need to go to the front desk each morning and get a voucher for the free breakfast and we weren't aware at first. Overall I really enjoyed staying there and would definitely go back!

<Title>“Home away from home !”
<Content>My husband and I recently stayed at La Tortuga and could not recommend it enough. The hotel is like an oasis in crazy Playa del Carmen and you feel like you are cocooned in this lovely safe space. The service is impeccable. The people that work there from Berny at the front desk to Heraldo/Jose and Daniel in the restaurant could not do enough to make your stay enjoyable. They truly seem to love working there and looking after people. It is a short walk to the beach and the hotel bar is wonderful if it rains. The happy hour is a true bargain. I would recommend booking a swim up pool room to avoid some of the noise that comes from being in the heart of Playa. The breakfast at the restaurant is amazing and is included. It kept us full all day. We thank Lat Tortuga for a wonderful trip.

<Title>“Small, Quaint, Accommodating, and Romantic!”
<Content>We were recommended this hotel from our wedding coordinator and could not have been more impressed. Anna was incredible when it came to the booking of our Honeymoon Suite and Lisa was more than excellent with the check in and providing information for us during our stay. We had a large portion of the wedding party staying at the hotel and I know they were more than impressed as well. The hotel provides great service, the rooms are very clean/well kept, it is close to 5th avenue/beach, and the food is some of the best in Playa! We will be returning for our Anniversary to this hotel year after year! A huge thanks to La Tortuga and the staff to making our wedding trip/day the best it could have ever been!

<Title>“A Wonderful Sanctuary in the Middle of Playa - Glorious!”
<Content>We highly recommend Hotel La Tortuga, for the accommodations, the Bistro and the service that we received at both. We appreciated the care with which the hotel was maintained and staffed – Wonderful! We wanted to upgrade our room once we got there, and the staff found a way to do that. It was my birthday while we were onsite, and the staff decorated our room, complete with balloons, dessert and champagne! (A pleasant surprise after a day at the beach.) Part of our vacationing is enjoying great food. The Bistro was as good or better than any restaurant we tried on 5th Avenue (please experience the eggplant hummus – stunning). Additionally, we very much enjoyed and relaxed in the lush, quiet courtyard after spending the day shopping or sightseeing. We can’t say enough about how much we enjoyed staying at La Tortuga and the service we received while we were there. It's off the 'strip,' so it's quiet, but 2 blocks from the beach. We will definitely stay there when we come back. We’ve been home a week and have already discussed another visit.

<Title>“Excelled all expectations!!!”
<Content>I travelled to Playa with my two teenage daughters. It was our first visit to Mexico and we are so pleased we found La Tortuga - thanks to Trip Advisor. From the time we walked into Reception for the first time to be warmly welcomed by lovely smiley Lisa we realised all the positive reviews we had read about La Tortuga were to be believed. She gave us lots of info about the hotel and a fresh fruit drink which went down a treat after out very long journey. All the staff were so friendly, always had a smile and a" hola" and were helpful. The hotel was well run, maintained to a high standard and the pool area was beautiful and lush. It was hard to imagine that just outside was the buzz of 5th Avenue. The hotel couldn't be located in a more convenient position, the shops, bars and restaurants right outside the door and the beach just a stroll away. We spent our beach days on the sun beds at Marmitas beach club which La Tortuga had an arrangement with (along with another venue nearby) whereby we collected "a beach pass" each day from Reception which enabled us to use the beds free of charge. La Bistro served a varied menu for the complimentary breakfast and, unfortunately as we were only there for 7 nights, we didn't manage to sample every item but what we did order was always 5 star and the fruit drinks were delicious. We visited their other La Bistro on 5th for breakfast one morning and, naturally, the staff there were just as pleasant. The evening menu was top class; we ate there a couple of times and enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. Happy Hour was just that thanks to the lovely Marco and Fidel. A very relaxed atmosphere and the free internet access was handy to have if we needed it. It was so pleasant sitting by the pool sipping campari and soda not having a care in the world - for 7 days at least. We stayed in a standard plus room which was spotless; we were most impressed by the powerful shower. Our room had a balcony overlooking the pool which looked lovely when illuminated at night. We looked forward to returning to our room at the end of the afternoon to see what "towel sculpture" our maid had left for us on the bed. This was one of the extra touches that made the hotel so special to us. When we wanted advice on trips the man on the Reception desk (sorry I didn't see his badge so he can't be named) was able to recommend Xel-Ha as he had visited three times himself. It was a memorable day out, especially the swim with dolphins which was something we'd always wanted to experience. The hotel guests were all friendly. The whole holiday was one we have so many happy memories of and to a greater degree this was because of The Tortuga Experience!!! We are planning to return in 2011 and for two week stay, definitely. Highly recommend if you visit Playa del Carmen.

<Title>“Wonderful!!!”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga over New Year's and had one of the best vacations of our lives. The staff was friendly, the restaurant was wonderful (especially the complimentary breakfast) and the setting was perfect. We spent almost every day at Zenzi Beach Club and enjoyed dinner along 5th avenue every night. Cannot say enough about not only the hotel but the area in general. If you are interested in a European like setting to enjoy long days sunbathing, shopping and people watching then Playa is for you!!!

<Title>“Excellent servic and staff, attractive central hotel, shame about the noise”
<Content>This is a perfect hotel in every way. The welcome is wonderful and. the staff cannot do enough for you. The rooms are spotless, but there is a lack of storage space. Our suite had a jacuzzi bath on the roof top which was idyllic. The free internet accesss at the bar was invaluable. This is a small cosy hotel just off 5th avenue, the main shopping and dining street. The complimentary breakfast was very good once you realise the limitations on what you can order. they also kindly provided us with a packed breakfast for us on the day of our departure as we left early. Unfortunately for us and for them, there is a nightclub that has just opened next door. There doesn't seem to have been any consultaltion with the hotel and they are very upset about it. The place runs from 11pm until 6am, 7 days a week. it's not so much the music but the constant bass thump that keeps you awake all night.. The staff in the hotel were very apologetic, and clearly it's not their fault, we were offered a change of room, but it was next door but one and we couldn't see what benefit we'd have from moving. They gave us ear plugs and after the third night invited us to dine in the restaurant where they would provide us with a "good bottle of wine".

<Content>We loved staying at La Tortuga. The staff was extremely welcoming, attentive and friendly. We felt like we were part of a large extended family. The breakfasts were included and exceeded our expectations. You have a variety of menu choices and all were excellent. The location was close enough to the beach and walking distance to many excellent restaurants. We would definitely stay there again. Judith and Frank (Chicago)

<Title>“Awesome Hotel!”
<Content>My wife and I have travelled to Mexico close to a dozen times over the past 15 years or so, but we usually stay at large all inclusive resorts in places like Cancun or Puerto Vallarta. For my 40th birthday this year we decided to do something a little different and chose a smaller hotel in the town of Playa Del Carmen. We had an amazing time. We loved both the town and the hotel. The hotel's location is perfect, basically within walking distance to everything we wanted - the beach, restaurants, shops, etc. We were a little concerned about not staying right on the beach, but the 5min walk to the beach was quite pleasant and the hotel has arrangements with several beach clubs that allow you to use their chairs and umbrellas which worked out really great. The staff at the hotel were awesome. From the moment we got there we felt at home. The room is a little on the small side, at least compared to the resorts we are used to, but it was clean and comfortable, and we really didn't spend much time in the room anyway. When we were relaxing at the room we were usually on the terrace or up on the private rooftop, which was very spacious and a nice treat. I definitely recommend booking a room with a private rooftop jacuzzi and relaxing under the stars at 1am !! Also a nice touch was the happy birthday balloons, champagne and birthday cake that was waiting for us in our room when we arrived! Free wireless internet was also a nice perk as we researched restaurants to go to from the comfort of our room on our laptop. I would definitely consider staying at La Torguga again and would highly recommend the hotel to anyone booking a trip to Playa Del Carmen.

<Content>This was our first stay at this hotel and the 2nd stay in Playa del Carmen. The hotel was clean, reasonably priced, well kept, the staff was very attentive and the location was 1/2 block from all the shops and restaurants in Playa. Its only 2 blocks from the beach but its the best deal in town. The hotel has a restaurant the breakfast is included and its a full cooked meal. Happy Hour is daily from 5 to 7pm and is well attended.

<Title>“Excellent service”
<Content>La Tortuga is a very nice and clean hotel, but the staff makes it exceptional. I've stayed in 5 star resorts and never experianced the attentive service I had at La Tortuga. The room was always spotless and when we needed extra towels or shampoo there were always housekeepers near by or we could call the front desk and they'd respond immediately. One time we needed extra bath towels and we saw a service man actually run them to our door. At their restaurant, El Bistro, we had the same great service. Daniel our waiter was SO friendly and attentive. One morning we were taking a tour at 7:30am and Daniel watched outside for our van!! We didn't ask, he was justthat sort of guy. Lisa, at the front desk, and the entire staff went above and beyond for us. From allowing us to check out late, calling taxi's, to giving us discounts when our plane was delayed for 48 hours and we needed a room for 2 extra nights. Instead of charging us an expensive last minute rate for the room, they gave us the same rate as our previous nights stay. I can honestly say that when the trip was over, I felt as though i was leaving family.

<Title>“Once you have the right room, great stay”
<Content>As others had warned before, we had a big issue getting checked in to a decent room. Had booked on Expedia for two Queen beds and they tried to put us in a tiny room with two TWIN beds. Not the same, and not romantic at all if ya know what I mean. First there were no other rooms available, then they pressured us to pay $100 a night more for an upgrade. Finally we found the confirmation email, and the manager came out to try to convince us to pay 50% off the difference- for giving us the room we had already paid for?! Huh? That's when I finally lost it. I was ready to walk right down to Luna Blue where you can sleep easy- on a REAL full bed- for $70 a night! Finally we got the right room, along with a bottle of champagne about two hours later than it should have taken. But we did love our room, the lovely grounds, and breakfast at their restaurant was a wonderful surprise. Please note that breakfast is not included in all room rates. In a nutshell: LOVED Playa, and loved this hotel once we fought our way to get the room we had paid for. If you book through Expedia, email them to confirm details- I've learned my lesson! Thanks fellow trip advisors for having warned me ahead about this same problem.

We loved the cozy, intimate feeling of the hotel! It really is like a little oasis right in the heart of Playa! The location is perfect for walking around Playa, and very close to a wonderful beach. The resturant on the premises was very good. But the best part about staying at La Tortuga were the people! We were treated like royal guests! Everyone was so gracious and helpful! Lisa was a great resource of information and help. We still miss Marco and his drinks! We really bonded to the people and the place. It is a real gem! We will definately be back!!!

<Title>“Very nice hotel but some problems.”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga for 2 weeks in January and had a pleassent staying. But mabye we had too high expectations after reading all the great reviews and we think the hotel is great but for us it wasn´t 5. The staff at the hotel are so friendly and we felt very wellcomed. We liked our room, warm colours, and very nice and big beds. Also a nice balcony with a fine poolview. Our maid kept our room very, very clean. The only problem we had at our room was that some nights there were very noicy from a bar at the back of the hotel (it was a open wall towards 5th ave outside our room). At our last week they also started a constructionwork outside, starting hammering very early). Off course we could have asked for a new room but after staying for a week in our room we didn´t feel like packing again. And we had earpluggs. It might be good advice to avoid room 210. Le Bistro was one of our favourit restaurants in Playa del Carmen, the food was excelent, both at breakfast, lunch and dinner. And the service was good most of the time. BUT there were som problems. On morning we were told that we couldn´t have breakfast until 07:30 even though the breakfast was to be servet from 07:00. Several morning we didn´t get any toast even though we asked for it. Our last dinner was a big disapointment. One of the vaighters treated us very badly, gave us a louzy table (gave a much better table to a couple that arrivet much later than us and not guests at the hotel). After having vaited for moore than 20 min without no one showed up to take our orders we left. Fortunately we got help from Anna at the reception who got very angry. So after lots of apologizes from the restaurang we got a coupple of free drinks, discount at our menu and was served by the management of the restaurant. We have to say that the other nights we had dinner at Le Bistro the food was very good and the vaighters nice. The boys in the bar vere great, served wonderful drinks. Always with a big smile. All the staff at La Tortuga were so friendly and helpful. Mamitas beach-club was clean and quite nice. We didn´t bather that it was a 10 minutes walk. All in all, we liked La Tortuga a lot. We enjoy staying at smaller boutique hotels. We also like that the hotel don´t welcome children.

<Title>“good times!”
<Content>We had a lovely stay at La Tortuga last week. The breakfast (served until 12pm) that is included with your stay is not your average continental fare - we we really impressed and tried something different each morning. The entire staff were both helpful and friendly. The hot water in our rooftop jacuzzi was not working when we arrived but after we spoke to someone at the desk, maintenance came by and fixed it for us. I worried a bit about the walk to the beach club, but we actually found it enjoyable. It was only about 10 min and you can shop along on 5th while you make the trip. Best to get to Mamitas before 10am in order to get a chair with umbrella. I know the noise from the nearby nightlife has been an issue for others, but we heard nothing. We stayed in room 301, which faced Calle 14. Good food and good fun, we had a fun and relaxing time.

<Title>“Two thumbs up, way up!!!”
<Content>La Tortuga is an oasis in tourist-heavy Playa Del Carmen. If you are looking for something other than an all-inclusive in Mexico then La Tortuga is a must. The hotel is lovely - the rooms cleam and bright, the grounds lush and tranquil, and the staff warm and friendly. Breakfast is provided as part of your stay. Usually this means some bread, jam, juice and coffee - not at La Tortuga. Guests are afforded the option of selecting items off a vast menu and all the food is fresh and has a Mexican twist. Although not located on the beach, they are affiliated with a beach club a mere 10 minute walk away and will provide towels. La Tortuga also has relationships/partnerships with other beach clubs both in Playa (ask about Blue Cacao - it is worth the taxi or walk) and in Tulum if you feel like changing it up. I would definitely go back and will recommend others to the hotel. The only thing that should be noted is that there are discos near by - and you can hear the bass pumping throughout the night if you are a light sleeper. To avoid this being a problem ask for rooms situated closer to Calle 14. We found that closing the window and using the fan was enough. This is a beautiful hotel that made our trip a memorable one.

<Title>“Charm, location, tranquility and an authentic environment - who could ask for anything more!”
<Content>Hotel La Tortuga was a delightful retreat located in the heart of Playa del Carmen. The rooms all open on a tropical courtyard with a "lazy river" running through it. Most have balconies. The breakfasts at the attached restaurant, El Bistro, were delicious and generous. We also ate dinner there with a discount provided by the hotel. Staying at the hotel gave us access to Mamita's Beach, a short walk away, as well as free towels, lounge chairs and umbrellas. My husband and I celebrated our twentieth wedding anniversary on this trip; and we were especially touched that, when the hotel found out about it, they decorated our room with rose petals and love birds made from towels. The staff is universally friendly and helpful, and our stay was truly memorable.

<Content>The location is nice but noisy. You cannot sleep, the music from the Clubs close to it is too loud. It is too expensive but the quality of services they provide. Moreover, the payment in Luxemburg is very suspicious. The personal is not very polite and they do not care about your stay.

<Title>“A wonderful hotel and great location”
<Content>Our first time back. We bought a house on Lake Chapala in Mexico in '99.Can not believe how Playa has changed and yet kept it's charm. La Tortuga turned out to be a real jewel. The hotel is in the heart of everything, beach, shopping,etc. It is beautiful, quite and the staff is fabulous. Enrique, the service manager is the best hotel management person I have ever come across. He set up a special private dinner for us in a small courtyard that was to die for with a personel waiter the most romantic night We have had in a long,long time. Thank you Enrique!! Also Markos and Fidel--bartenders were topnotch.I will return to La Tortuga every time I'm in Playa de Carmen.

<Title>“Tranquil hidden hotel right in Playa”
<Content>Why choose a massive all-inclusive resort when you can experience exquisite surroundings and staff who know the meaning of service right in the heart of Playa? That's "La Tortuga". We felt we got to know Marco, Fidel, Esteban, Santiago, Jose, Berny, Jessica, Lisa and Anna (sorry if I've left anyone out). My husband and I chose a "swim-up" room which I loved. Step right into the pool from your room and swim around the lazy river. Even though it was winter and the water was cool, we enjoyed it. Happy hour is not to be missed. Our other travelling companion, "Olive the Ostrich" fell in love with Fidel and Marco and MANY Long Island Iced Teas later. (see pics) Along the beach at night we enjoyed the live music at Bad Boys bar and Fusion. I'm sure you can fit in lots of tours and sights, but as lazy travellers we just enjoyed the little local taquierias, the beach, meeting locals and wandering off the tourist map a few blocks back off the beach. It's the relaxed but professional staff who make La Tortuga a great hotel for its guests. Many thanks from Amy and Santa Klaus

<Title>“great hotel in great location”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel recently and have to say that I loved everything about it. The location was great, right off of 5th ave, and near all the good nightlife spots. Staff is extremely pleasant and accommodating. Food at El Bistro is great, and the prices are very reasonable.

<Content>An excellent hotel with staff always onhand to make your stay a memorable one. The breakfast served in El bistro was excellent, although, the one evening meal we ate there was disappointing. We very much enjoyed our stay and hope to return.

<Title>“Wondeful hotel”
<Content>My partner and I stayed for Christmas/New Years 2009. The hotel is really pretty and is just one block away from the popular 5a Avenida (5th Avenue) in Playa del Carmen. I chose this hotel because it was No Kids and it was NOT all inclusive. This meant we got a really quiet hotel and could go out to dinner every night to the myriad of restaurants Playa has to offer. First things first: this hotel is NOT on the beach. I knew this going in, but when all was said and done, I kind of regretted not getting a beach-side hotel. You get a free The beach club pass every day (and freee towels). but the beaches were so full for X-Mas and New years that you had to get to the beach club at 8:30am to get a decent place near the water. And they place was crawling with kids, so my investment to avoid their noise and general ruckus did not really pay off since we spent a lot of time on the beach. Still, none of this was the hotel's fault, the location advertised is Excellent, one block away from all the commotion of the main street. The hotel is right next to the CocoBongo night club. I read from some people here that the noise from the club was too much, but I actually stood OUTSIDE the club at 2am and could barely hear anything from the street. I really doubt you could hear anything from inside the rooms in the hotel, but I guess it depends how sensitive you are to noise and vibrations and stuff. Still, this was no problem for us at all. The room included breakfast each day from 7am to 12 noon, which is great because you can get up relatively late and still get a free breakfast. The restaurant at the hotel, Le Bistro, served really high quality food. We got to sample the entire breakfast menu the week we were there and loved everything (especially the Machaca!). They give you a 25% off dinner coupon and we used it up and the dinner was also excellent. The hotel staff was always extremely friendly and welcoming, always happy to give you more towels and breakfast passes. They weren't always too knowledgeable about the touristy stuff (like a concierge would be at a larger hotel) but they had lots of brochures and everything was always a short walk away, so you could just go and ask. For example they didn't have any details about skydiving or cheap ways to get to Tulum (not by tour bus), but the answers were either in their brochures or just a 10min walk to the skydiving office (skydiving was AMAZING, btw). We got the standard room, not the jr suite, but it was very large and had remote-control powered A/C. The bathroom was HUGE and beautiful. We didn't get a window or balcony, so that kind of sucked, but we only missed it to dry our swimsuits after a day at the beach. The pool area was beautiful, we got to sit in the central jacuzzi at night and it felt very private. We even got drinks served to us there (oh, and the bar had a 2x1 happy hour from 5pm to 7pm every night! Great margaritas!). I really liked this hotel, and even though next time if I go in such a high season date, I will chose a beach-front hotel, this place is still wonderful in any other time and is a really great value. Great for couples and romantic getaways.

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel That Left Us Disappointed”
<Content>I must say that we were extremely pleased with La Tortuga Hotel when we first arrived and stayed that way until it was time to check out. My wife and I stayed for one night as we were on our way to Cozumel for a 4-day weekend. I decided to book into a Jr. Suite in order to get the private jacuzzi, which unfortunately was our downfall. Everything with the hotel was wonderful, from the front desk staff to the pool area to the service at the restaurant. The only problem was when I went to fill our Jacuzzi at about 11:30 pm. After about 45 minutes, the Jaccuzi was finally full enough to use, so my wife and I got in and tried to turn the jacuzzi on. It made a humming noise for about 10 seconds and then quit. We waited and tried with a few more times; each time with the same response: the jacuzzi simply didn't work. Even this didn't leave us overly bothered, as we figured the hotel would do something to make this right -- given we'd paid an extra $100 for a Jacuzzi Suite. We went to check out the following morning and informed the front desk of the Jacuzzi problems. Their response was that we should have contacted them the previous night and they would have moved us. They were seriously suggesting that we should have moved rooms between midnight and 1 a.m. When we told them that wasn't reasonable at such an hour, they responded that they could have sent maintenance to the room. Again, we had no desired for someone to come and repair the jacuzzi in the early hours of the morning; that is something that should been done during the day when no one is in the room. It was clear they had no interest in making the situation right, so we chose to continue on our trip to Cozumel and enjoyed the rest of the weekend. I must reiterate that I was extremely happy with the hotel up until it came time to check out. I would even go so far as to stay there were I to return, but I certainly wouldn't choose one of the Jacuzzi Suites, after the problem we had this time.

<Title>“Cozy, nice pool and jacuzzi, helpful staff”
<Content>Caught a quick 5 day, last minute siesta in Playa del Carmen, and enjoyed the accommodations and hospitality at La Tortuga Hotel. Clean, cozy, nice central courtyard with a pool and jacuzzi where you could have your happy hour drinks 2 for 1 every evening. Helpful staff, centrally located. A nice place and a good value. Would stay there again.

<Title>“Can't wait to go back!”
<Content>I'm so glad I chose to stay at this small boutique hotel. The location was perfect, a block off 5th ave in the heart of everything. Everyone was wonderful from Lisa(front desk), Marco and Fidel(bar), and the waiters in the restaurant. We stayed in room 116 which was perfect-next to the Bistro, steps from the pool and jacuzzi, rooftop hottub and next to the rooftop solarium. Included breakfast was wonderful with a good variety (loved the mexican style eggs). At night the lights around the pool area make a wonderful atmosphere for relaxing. The drinks at the bar are so addictive (I wish I could have one right now). The only negative I would mention is the internet connection is very spotty so don't rely on it. Also the pool was a little chilly for my taste but the hottub was perfect. Other than that the next time we are in Playa we will definately be staying at the Tortuga again.

<Title>“As good as it gets.....”
<Content>We just returned from a 5 day trip in Playa. We stayed @t La Tortuga Hoteland I cant say enough good things. The staff was very helpful (our Spanish is very limited and they helped with all our questions in English) and the hotel facilities are beautiful and safe. Pros; Location – right in the middle of it all but far enough away from the clubs to be quiet and restful. Facility – beautiful in every way with a great pool, bar and restaurant. Rooms – our room was large, clean and the air conditioning can freeze you out if you want. Safety – there is only one way in and it is always watched. Price/Value – Its pricy compared to some locations but if you consider the free breakfast (its order off the menu at the wonderful restaurant not some dinky continental buffet) and the free beach club you save $30 to $40 USD each day. Cons; The only thing wasn’t great was the fact that the spa was closed for repair and they didn’t tell us that until we tried to book services. Summery – Go to Playa and Stay @ La Tortuga Hotel. We spent the extra cash and got a junior suite. The room came with a rooftop deck and hot tub that maid our trip.

<Title>“We felt we had won the lottery with this charming hotel !”
<Content>We were so pleased we bypassed the all-inclusive megqa-resorts in Playa, for us they were too far away from the action and required transport to go everywhere, but I guess thats a personal choice. We chose La Tortuga after much research and were thrilled with our choice. Set only a block back from 4th Ave where all the restaurants, bars and shops are, and 2 blocks or so from the beautiful beach, the location couldn't have been better for us as it was nice and quiet at night. The grounds and hotel common areas were immaculate and the gardens were well tended and beautifully leafy offering plenty of shade, especially around the pool. Our room (205) was light and airy with whitewashed walls, terracotta tiled floor and two queen beds. Double doors led out to a sunny balcony with table and chairs and overlooked the pool, restaurant and bar. The bathroom was modern and there was plenty of storage. Alas, due to some of the rooms being updated, we were affected by noise during the day. Our concerns were met immediately and we were offered a choice of rooms to move to which was nice. We were fortunate to be upgraded to one of the hotel's best rooms at no extra cost which made us very happy. This superior suite was fully refurbished throughout with king sized bed , a flat screen tv, private jacuzzi set into a bay window, decent wardrobes with ironing board and iron, and a bar fridge and drinks trolley. The powder room had marble twin sink vanities set into a huge wooden beam for a counter top, hairdryer, and a separate room housed the spacious shower and wc. Outside on the deck was a king sized outdoor four poster bed for lazing around on. Bliss ! The pool was large and irregularly shaped and wound its way around the whole hotel. An indoor/outdoor lounge area with lovely soft lamps, couches and coffee tables was the perfect place for pre dinner drinks and the adjoining restaurant served tasty and well priced food. We ate there 6 out of 9 nights. Marmita's Beach Club is a leisurely 15 minute walk from the hotel where you can use the beach lounges and umbrellas all day, or you can take a 15 minute cab ride to another swanky private beach club and rest on queen sized matresses on the sand - ahhh!!!! Thanks to all staff at La Tortuga for their friendliness and great service, you were all super, especially our favourite barman "Diabalo" who makes the meanest tequila cocktails in Mexico.

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel!”
<Content>This was an excellent hotel- definitely 4-5 stars. Very big room, nice big walk in shower. We had a jacuzzi tub for 2 in our room which was wonderful! The room had a swamp cooler in addition to the AC & ceiling fan, and the staff didn't empty it (we should have mentioned that to the front desk), though they did always have towel animals, and lots of fresh towels and cleaned the room every day. The location was excellent, right off the main tourist street-- noise was never a problem in our room- the hotel was very quiet and relaxing. The attached restaurant was very good. There was ALWAYS someone friendly at the front desk- it's a boutique hotel so general people off the street aren't going to be wandering around- so I felt very safe. There were no children which was awesome for a Honeymoon couple like us! Wonderful landscaping at the pool & never overcrowded. For the room type I felt we were getting a 4-5 star hotel at a 3 star price.

<Content>If there is such a thing in the hospitality business it exists here.My husband and I have stayed twice, both times in the supierior Junior Suites. The owners of this hotel are truly fortunate to employ the staff they have. Every one who works there , from the maintenance , houskeepers, restaurant staff and the front desk are sincerely interested in providing the best experience for you, the guest. The food is excellent as is the service.The hotel is relaxing and beautiful. The finest 5 star resorts can not hold a candle to this hotel.For selfish reasons, I was reluctant to share my good fortune as I dont want the hotel to get so popular that it changes- as happens frequently. La Tortuga - Don't ever change ! Special thanks to Bernardo, Lisa and Anna at the front desk, and Esteban , Daniel at the Restaurant and Fidel and Marco at the bar .

<Title>“Simply the best!”
<Content>La Tortuga is a wonderful hotel with a very attentive staff that makes you feel special. For us, it is the perfect size hotel. It has all the amenities; beautiful lush grounds, gorgeous pool, and a terrific indoor/outdoor restaurant. There is an inviting outdoor bar by the pool with a great happy hour (or two). Marco welcomes you with refreshing drinks and friendly conversation. Our accommodations were perfect - an immaculate swim-up room with a private terrace. La Tortuga is very accessible, only a block from 5th Ave. for shopping, restaurants, and nightlife. Also, an easy walk to the beach. The staff is exceptional. Everyone is so gracious and helpful. El Bistro restaurant is excellent. The service superb. The Apple Flambe fantastic. Daniel, our waiter, greeted us each morning with coffee, fresh fruit, a newspaper, and a smile. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and highly recommend Hotel La Tortuga.

<Content>Our son was married in Playa on Saturday, November 7, 2009. We stayed at La Tortuga, as did several other wedding guests. On Sunday, we hosted a wedding brunch for over 40 people at the restaurant at the hotel. We could not be more pleased. The food was wonderful and the personal attention from Enrique Ventura, the manager, was simply phenomenal. He helped us plan the menu, arrange the set-up, greeted guests and just made us all feel so welcome. The staff at La Tortuga is extremely attentive and assisted our guests in making airport transfer arrangements as well as sightseeing trips.

<Title>“Very likely the best hotel in Playa!”
<Content>Hotel La Tortuga is everything it is purported to be by the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor. My advice: 1. If you have never been to Playa, make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. It is not a bad place, but it is much larger, busier and tackier than I realized. 2. If you do decide to stay in Playa, stay at La Tortuga. 3. Splurge for the Junior Suite...any room with the rooftop jacuzzi. Let me tell you, enjoying a bubble bath under the stars with tequila (or bev of choice) and a Cuban -er, Mexican, cigar is PURE HEAVEN. That, my friends, is what vacation is all about. It's close to everything as it's situated right in the center of town but feels extremely private and relaxing. The pool is incredible, the lounge areas are beautiful and well maintained, and the service is fabulous. Every person on staff is a gem, particularly the gentleman at the front desk, whose name escapes me at the moment. The bar is small but well stocked, and the bartender is fantastic. The food at the restaurant is very good. Their wines are great! Lots of European and South American imports. Be sure to visit the sister restaurant away from the hotel. They usually give you a promotional discount if you eat there, and that applies to alcohol/beverages, too! Like 30% off or something. The food at that restaurant is excellent. The beaches in Playa are so crowded. Not my thing. Ask the staff where to go to enjoy a more relaxing setting and you won't regret it. Bottom line: If you've settled on Playa and can afford Hotel La Tortuga, don't think twice.

Breakfast was free everyday and it is an extensive menu with lots to choose from. The fresh juice was awesome. All the staff were so friendly and respectful. Checkout was a breeze with absolutely no hassles. Its a smaller hotel so its perfect for a big group of friends that wants to have majority of the hotel. I highly recommend this hotel and can't wait to go back!

<Title>“Really not sure you can stay anywhere better”
<Content>Everything about this hotel was fantastic. Service, location, rooms, food. The initial welcome was really friend and when we shown our rooms we were presently surprised by the fact that we had our own personal jacuzzi on the roof (on the ground floor you can swim out of your room into the pool). The breakfast the next day (all included) was fantastic and it is not surprising the restaurant is considered the best place to have breakfast in the town. The location is also fantastic is that is far enough away from the 5th Avenue to get away from the noise and tackiness while still being round the corner. The spa is also excellent (massages are good value). If there is one down side it is that the pool is not really somewhere you can hang out and the beach club (for which you get vouchers) is a bit of a walk but La Mimosa is excellent and worth the walk. Would highly recommend this hotel

<Title>“5 Star Service at a 3-Star Lovely Hotel”
<Content>The prettiest and best managed place we've stayed at after 9 trips to the Playa area, that more than makes up for any minor deficiencies. Location is ideal, off the northern end of 5th's walking mall, and a short walk to the best white sand Mamitas Beach where they deliver good food and drinks all day long. Entire hotel is immaculate with pleasant seating around the pool in the center of the courtyard whose landscape architect should have won an award for the pool's shape, wandering paths and private, intimate, tropical paradise atmosphere. My husband, who has never sat by the pool a day in his life, enjoyed 2 days poolside here, using their Wi-Fi service while I luxuriated alternately in the sun and water. The rooms offer air cond. and fans and private open-air decks overlooking the pool/courtyard. Bedsheets are crisp and the beds are comfortable, but I prefer fitted bottom sheets that stay put. Would like better bedside reading lamps. Room frig. is stocked with beverages, snacks and the bathrooms have quality shampoo, etc. but no tub. Could also use magnifying mirrors for contact lens wearers. Restaurants El Bistro at the Hotel and its sister on 5th are both Excellent Plus in food, service and atmosphere, including healthy mark* meals and fruit/veggie smoothies to satisfy health oriented diners, although nothing is compromised in quality, taste or value. The breakfast-included selection is the best with fresh eggs, etc. After dinner you MUST also order the table-side "Apples Flambe!" ...better than at the Ritz! Finally, Enrique Ventura manages the place with grace, style and a lot of class, and all of his staff are warm, friendly and speak English very well. Stay at La Tortuga, you will not be disappointed.

<Title>“Wish we were still there”
<Content>From the moment we checked in to the day we checked out, our stay at La Tortuga was pure bliss. We had read previous reviews of La Tortuga on tripadvisor and since it was so highly recommended, we knew we had to give it a try. We're so glad we did. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, but what makes it different from other hotels we've stayed at is the staff. Lisa checked us in our first day and continued to be most helpful during our stay - from booking tours to answering questions, she does her job very well. The restaurant staff at El Bistro was excellent also. All of our waiters were extremely friendly and helpful - Daniel, Micky, Jose, Santiago, and Esteban. We looked forward to breakfast every morning to see them again. La Tortuga is so close to everything in Playa del Carmen - the shops, restaurants and the beach. We walked everywhere. We went to Mamita's Beach Club several times and had great service there also. Our 7 days in Playa del Carmen went by so quickly. We can't wait to go back and see our friends at La Tortuga again!

<Title>“Outstanding! Skip the big resorts and go to La Tortuga!”
<Content>I chose this hotel because some of my friends were already staying there. So we met for a day or so and I stayed on for a few more days. I have to say that the staff and service at the hotel were outstanding. I was worried that I'd feel awkward staying there by myself, but everyone made me feel like I was part of the family. For my birthday, they surprised my by decorating my room with flowers, balloons and a bottle of champagne. I was very indecisive about sight seeing, so, at the last minute (which was at 7:30 AM) Bernardo booked a private driver for me and I was on my way (at 8:00 AM) to see the Mayan ruins. I never got to meet Anna since she was on vacation, but my vacation really started with her, since I was in touch with her prior to my trip. Everyone else at the hotel (Bernardo, Rafael, Lisa and all their bartenders and waiters) are without doubt some of the nicest people I've met. I highly recommend going to La Tortuga and I'm sure I'll be paying a visit soon again.

<Title>“Fabulous hotel and staff”
<Content>I went with a large group of 17 people for two of my friends birthdays. The hotel, ambiance, staff, and trip exceeded what I thought possible. Every meal the hotel served was incredible--and I'm very picky about food. I'm not going to waste calories on food that isn't wonderfully delicious. The breakfast (included in the room rate) offers so many choices. I had Eggs Benedict the first day. And then swicthed to Chicken Enchiladas for the last 3 mornings. Both of these dishes were loaded with flavor. I had dinner at the restaurant one night and lunch two of the days. The shrimp cocktail is worth trying--it is more like gazpacho with shrimp in it. The hotel staff is very kind and informative. Everyone is so easy to get along with and they make it easy to have a great time. We forgoed the Hotel's beach club and went to "Kool" instead. About a 10 minute walk. They played club music, charged us $7 for cushy chairs, and waited on us like royalty. I got a $45 massage under a tent and it was top notch.

<Title>“A place to come again!!”
<Content>14 days in Playa del Carmen, at la tortuga was the best idea ever. The rooms fit perfectly, really nice hotel with a great view over the pool that looks like a little river. Lots og palms and flowers. The service from all over the hotel the best. You can get what you need, and the people at the hotel, will help you every time you ask them. La tortuga is very near the beach where the hotel offers you free sunchairs. At the same time, it is close to the city, where you at everytime of the day can go at get a great dinner. The hotel also have el bistro, that serves the best food all day long.

<Title>“Loved this quiet hotel...just steps from the center it all”
<Content>We loved how peaceful and quiet the location felt though it is less than a block from the man walking street through the center of everything in Playa and just a couple blocks to the beach. Our room was nice and we loved having a private balcony to sit also. One thing I really liked about this hotel was that the pool area is shaded. I know that wouldn't be a plus for everyone, but I love to sit and read by the pool (and enjoy a beverage) but can't stay too long in the sun. For those that love the sun, there is an adjacent patio with sun beds and umbrellas just steps away from the pool (upstairs). The staff was nice though not overly helpful. They were able to help us set up a trip to Tulum and Xel-ha, point us to restaurants and the beach, and provide wonderful service at the restaurant and bar. There are only 50 or so rooms which make this a welcome change from the giant resort properties of Cancun. Some rooms have swim up patio areas and others have rooftop balconies. Our room was on the 2nd floor with a private balcony which afforded a view of the pool as well as some privacy. I would gladly stay here again on our next trip to Playa.

<Title>“Best Hotel in Playa”
<Content>Wow is really all I can say. My twin brother and I (along with 15 of our friends) just got back from La Tortuga after celebrating our 40th birthday there. The staff, service, accommodations, El Bistro (restaurant on site), bar, pool, etc. were truly amazing. Our favorite part of the trip was happy hour from 5 to 7. We went to Mamita's Beach Club the first day and were a little disappointed. Highly recommend Kool Beach Club which is right next to Mamita's. We had our birthday party @ El Bistro and couldn't have been happier. The breakfast they serve is second to none. Thanks again La Tortuga for a wonderful time.

<Title>“Absolutely Fabulous!”
<Content>Enrique and his staff is wonderful. The hotel is nice and casual. It has a wonderful atmosphere, very relaxed. Everyone is incredibly friendly and helpful, without being overbearing (which is an art form). The rooms are nice and clean. The pool is beautiful. The food was wonderful. The bar at happy hour is the place to be. The staff is always willing to help you decide where to eat and will make the reservations for you. El Bistro at the hotel is wonderful as is the newer location on 5th, and the prices can't be beat. Its a couple of blocks to the beach where they wait on you hand and foot while you relax under your umbrella. If you want a quiet beach all to yourself, Blue Cacau is the place to go, for people watching and fun Mamita's or Kool are the places to be. Overall this is one of the best vacation experiences I have had.

<Title>“Beautiful and friendly La Tortuga exceeded our expectations and became our home in Playa del Carmen”
<Content>My husband and I chose La Tortuga because we wanted to avoid the mega hotels and experience Playa del Carmen from a central location in the city. The reviews for this charming boutique hotel were great, but when we got there, La Tortuga exceeded our already-high expectations. Our suite was awesome - clean yet welcoming, with a super-comfortable bed and a patio balcony with stairs leading up to a roof-top hot tub. SO romantic! We LOVED the pool area and courtyard. Even though we came to Playa for the beach, we were so content to come back to the pool at La Tortuga and spend the rest of the afternoon relaxing and swimming. The courtyard is gorgeous during the daytime, but the way it is illuminated in the evening is absolutely stunning. The hotel is extremely well-kept and rustically beautiful. Everyone on staff is extremely kind and hospitable and very attentive to your needs. Marco and Fidel at the pool bar are great, and Lisa and Anna at the front desk make you feel like you are at home. Whatever trips or adventures you want to take, the crew in the main office will take care of it for you and make all the arrangements you need. The restaurant, El Bistro, serves fabulous food and the waitstaff are super friendly - Daniel and the other morning waiters, especially. Don't miss out on El Bistro on 5th Avenue - the chef "gets" cooking, and loves it - and it shows in the food he prepares. My husband and I seriously struggle to recall a dinner experience better than the one we had there. By the time we had to leave, it felt like we were leaving home - not just some hotel where we were know only by our room number. We left friends at La Tortuga, and hope that someday we can go back to have another fantastic experience and create more amazing memories.

<Title>“Great Experience”
<Content>After 13 trips in the area to all inclusive, not only was our stay at Tortuga a great experience giving the opportunity for a more cultural type visit, but we also enjoyed the dinning experience of eating in local restaurants, which of course included both the Bistro at the hotel plus the new location on 5th Av. The people at the hotel were every bit as good as Grand Velas a $7,000 a week hotel. One of the reasons we continue to visit the area is the friendliness of the people. Special thanks to those who served us most, Marco & Fidel pool side, Daniel the Bistro, Lisa reception, not forgeting Sylvia who kept our room clean. Give it a try once you pay for all inclusive you tend to miss out on so much more. Britex

<Title>“Best combination of genuine elegance without glitz”
<Content>We spent 6 delightful nights at La Tortuga. I have nothing bad to say. Our room was perfect...comfortable, private, clean, with towels sculpted each day depicting a different figure. It was my 61st birthday which was celebrated by the staff with champagne, chocolate crepes and flower petals and chocolate kisses decorating the bed. The breakfast was excellent, the staff was friendly and helpful and always immediately responsive to any concerns and ready and willing to advise or direct as the occasion required. I would certainly stay here again and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. Location was ideal. Close to everything but away from the noise. The grounds were picturesque: an inner court with a meandering pool, beautifully landscaped gardens and restaurant seating for breakfast until noon! I was not disappointed in any way. Even one night when a party of young adults was celebrating a bit too loudly, within less than 1 minute they were quiet. This was the only time there was any undue noise. The gardens, pool and rooms were all kept clean and invitingly decorated. I can't even think of 1 hting I would change!

<Title>“Great hotel”
<Content>This is our last day of 14 here at La Tortuga and the Playa. We booked this hotel through a hotel agency in sweden and have nothing but positive things to say about the stay in general and the hotel in specific. The staff were very professional and welcoming and really seems to be interested in who you are. There is a desktop computer available on the bar to check your email (this) and we used it to transfer images from our camera to a menmory stick. We had a few meals at the El Bistro, right at the hotel, and they did not disapoint at all. The waitors (they of course knew us by name), seemed to go out of their way to make sure everything was ok. All in all, if we return to Playa, we will make sure that we stay at the La Tortuga again.

<Title>“fabulous small hotel”
<Content>Booked this hotel online after reading so many great reviews and it certainly lived up to its reputation. Service was very friendly and very helpful. Maid service was great. Marco the bartender was fantastic! make sure you try a watermelon water if you are looking for something refreshing without alcohol. For tequila, try the clase azul at the bar for happy hour. its in the pretty white and blue bottle. From the front desk to the waiters in the restaurant the service could not have been better. Location is great. one block from 5th ave. Be sure to try the new el bistro restaurant on fifth and try the sea bass. yummy! Oh- and breakfast comes with the room and has anything you could want.Why stay at an all inclusive? There are many cheap and wonderful restaurants around and this hotel has it all! We will be back next year! thanks again Marco! Ronny and Nick

<Title>“The only place we want to stay in Playa!”
<Content>This was our second trip to La Tortuga, and our only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer! Between the extremely attentive staff, charming pool and manicured courtyard, and one of the best restaurants around (El Bistro), we can't say enough nice things about it. I was especially impressed that some even remembered our names from our last stay. Our deepest appreciation goes to the entire staff for making our stays so memorable, and to the maintenance and housekeeping staff that are always busy making sure everything is in order (with a smile on their face). Special thanks to Bernie, Lisa, Anna, Ivan, Daniel, Santiago, Mickey, Fidel, Maurizio and Mario for making a lasting impression and showing what true customer service really is.

<Title>“Absolutely terrific!”
<Content>We traveled to Playa for our honeymoon, and chose La Tortuga based on reviews on this site. We did not want an all-inclusive experience, due to a bad experience last year in Antigua, and our desire for a more 'free-form' vacation. From the moment we arrived, we were treated to the first of many special treats for the week. Our bed was made up with two towel swans in the shape of a heart, along with a room full of rose petals. The room was a little cozy, but more than comfortable for 2 people and a week's worth of luggage. The balcony (which we used frequently) overlooked the pool, which as a 'lazy river' type of arrangement, was a welcome departure to the typical pool shape. The palm trees surrounding the pool provided a welcome respite from the very strong sun. There was even a banana tree with young fruit on it. The staff were nothing short of professional, friendly, and welcoming. The place is small enough that the staff quickly learns and remembers your name. You are not just a room number here. Requests are responded to quickly and courteously, such as bagged ice for both of our sunburns (mine on the second day, hers on the next-to-last)! The two bartenders make a mean drink, and the 2-for-1 happy hour every day leads to a lot of experimenting with the cocktail menu. There is a desktop computer available on the bar to check your email or Facebook. The hotel had wifi and we never had any problem accessing the network on our personal laptop. While we had a week's worth of incredible meals throughout the town, one would be amiss to overlook El Bistro, right at the hotel. We ate breakfast there every day, along with 2 dinners. The food is flavorful, robust, and loyal to local cuisine. Again, the servers knew us by name, and seemed to go out of their way to make sure everything was right with the meals. They remembered the little details which made our meals that much more enjoyable. Itza Spa had a wide range of services available at the best prices I have ever seen. They were responsive and able to make suggestions for services based on my interests and concerns without being pushy. Their masseur was phenomenal and I had two massages with him over the course of the week. We booked 2 excursions through the front desk, and Lisa was able to secure space on one of them late the evening before. She was also able to reschedule an excursion at the last minute due to my sunburn. All in all, when we return to Playa, we will not hesitate to stay at La Tortuga again. We cannot think of anything that we would change about our stay to improve the experience.

<Title>“Magnifico!”
<Content>We vacationed at La Tortuga Hotel, Playa Del Carmen week of September 10th thru the 17th, 2009. This was our first experience at Play Del Carmen, and it was a very relaxing, enjoying experience. The Hotel met all of our expectations and more. From the all of the Restaurant Staff, especially Daniel, Santago, MIguel and Esteban, who were very proffesional, but show us a lot of specail attention. We cannot forget Marco, who made special drinks for us and always had a smile on his face. The house Keeping Staf were wonderful too. Each day we would go out sight-seeing or on an adventure and could not wait to come back to the room to see what new art creation they had made with the clean towels cnetered on the bed. We will defiantely come back to this hidden treasure again. All of the front desk staff were so graciuos and accomodating to our every need, especially Ralphel and Anna who over saw the running of the Hotel while we were their and made our stay just perfect.

<Content>This is realy a great hotel. Not only the ambience is magnificent but also the whole grew of the hotel and restaurant (El Bistro at la tortuga & El bistro an la quinta) are amazing. They give you a feeling of being at home (but then offcourse in a paradise ;) It is near the beach and fifth av. (shopping and eating street) but when you are in the hotel it looks like it is placed somewhere in nowhere land. If you want tips for trips you can easaly ask the grew by breakfast or Lisa at the reception. Greetings from Holland

<Title>“Felt like your own little island”
<Content>We stayed at one of the swim up rooms though we really did not need to but it added something special to the room. The pool and the landscaping is charming and inviting. The decor is really folky feeling vs. your stereotypical hotel room. It has a window in the bathroom that is for air circulation and that was also a nice touch though ours just went out in the hall. The bar and restaurant is right there on the poolside. The food was nicely done, not too fancy but still different and more authentic for the area. Of course they would always make one of those cutesie towel arrangements on your bed for you to come back to after basically shopping down the one street in Playa del Carmen. Did not care too much for the city for that reason. It gets old after a while if you don't plan on doing anything else. Kind of like a Playa del Disney. Make sure you get out and do other things. We went during spring break and for the most part you never felt like there was a big party going on or any really loud people running amuck. I think they mostly stay in Cancun. Do enjoy the poolside though. We spent hours out there just napping, reading and swimming..

<Title>“Paradise”
<Content>I stayed at La Tortuga the last weekend in August for my birthday. Everyone knew it was my birthday, even the taxi driver wished me a "happy birthday". The staff was so wonderful and helpful. Hanging out by the pool in the afternoon and sipping mohitos at happy hour was the highlight of our stay. Our room (#36) was huge and had an awesome roof top deck with a great view of the pool. The hotel is located close to 5th Ave and the beach. One day we took a trip up to the Bluecacao Beach Club. It is worth the taxi ride up there, it was so sucluded and the beach was absolutely beautiful!!! The kite surfers even came out in the afternoon! Next time we go back it will be for at least a week. There are so many things to do, but so easy to just relax and do nothing. Thanks to all the staff at La Tortuga for making our stay the best ever! We'll be seeing you again soon.

The location is great, rigth in the middle of the action and very close to the beach. The room was great with its own jacuzzi, nice terrace and bathroom. Every night the room was prepared beautifully. The pool area super nice and quiet. The Bistro restaurant excellent and great value. We had a wonderful time.

<Title>“Super vacation at La Tortuga!”
<Content>We've spend our 2009 vacation at La Tortuga in Playa del Carmen from 28th July till 12th of August. From the moment we arrived it was perfect. We were welcomed very friendly with cocktails by Lisa. Our first impression of the Hotel was "a little paradise". The room (212) was perfect, very clean and had a nice view at the swimming pool. During our stay we had breakfast (every day) and dinner (sometimes) at El Bistro which is located in the Hotel. It was perfect. Good food, nice drinks and very friendly staff (all of them but especially Esteban and Marco). Playa del Carmen is beautiful. The beaches are nice. A good place to go is Zenzi. We did excursions to Tulum, Xelha, Xcaret and Sian Ka'an. Mexico was a great experience for us. Now we're back in Holland in the rain......We'll be back! Many thanks to the La Tortuga-staff for a fantastic vacation! Dennis and Daniëlla

<Title>“If you are looking for the perfect place... THIS IS IT.”
<Content>My husband and I researched a lot of places before deciding on La Tortuga. I've read the good reviews and the bad. La Tortuga has it all. Really. I'm in the hospitality industry... hotels, restaurants, nightclubs... etc. I know what to look for. Let me tell you my friend, look no further. You will not be disappointed. The property alone is absolutely beautiful, but I don't want to waste time or words when you can see the pics of the property. What I want to describe to whomever may be reading this- is service.... Trust me- it makes all of the difference. The reception... Anna and Lisa- thank you for just being who you genuinely are- helpful and full of smiles. It was an honor to meet you. The restaurant El Bistro that belongs to the hotel...not only is the food the best in Playa- but this night owl was anxious to wake up at 8am to start our day and see our "friends" at breakfast. This is the attention to detail that I want to point out. The servers rival the best fine dining service I've ever received or trained my own staff on. As a matter of fact, I've used Marco, Fidel, Esteban, and Mickey as examples in my latest staff meeting. Thank you all for making my morning coffee all the more enjoyable. The location is convenient to everything... I actually preferred where we were after learning the layout of Playa... I just want whomever reading this to know that I am a realistic critic... and I recommend La Tortuga over everywhere else.

<Title>“You can't beat the service at La Tortuga. Excelente!”
<Content>While in Playa Del Carmen, I stayed at La Tortuga for six nights in a junior suite. My only complaint was that the room was a little smaller than I expected. In the photos, it looked much bigger. The balcony and rooftop jucuzzi made up for the small room. Anna, Lisa, Fidel, and the entire staff were excellent. They made me feel very welcome. Most addressed you by your first name which added a nice personal touch to the hotel. This is one of the advantages in staying in a small hotel. This hotel is all about service. The servers, bartenders, housekeeping, and front desk help were all very courteous. I was traveling alone. The hotel was mainly couples. It was not the best location to meet other singles but I still enjoyed my stay. The location was perfect. I was one block from 12th street and one avenue from 5th. 12th street is at the heart of the nightlife and 5th avenue is the main strip in Playa Del Carmen. I was also a 5 minute walk to Playa Mamita's ( a trendy beach with beds, dj's, and beautiful women) .I would highly recommend this hotel to those looking to stay in Playa Del Carmen.

<Content>From the welcome drink, to the friendly staff, nice pool, nice restaurant, and great location, this is the place to stay. Despite not being a fan of hotels in general, this is a place I enjoyed staying in. There are great spots to relax and the staff is always willing to provide recommendations or simply chat. From the hotel, the beach is a easy walk, Avenida Cinco is at your doorstep (from back entrance), and it's a easy walk to the shared taxi stand or hail a taxi. Whether you're looking to make the hotel a base for your day trips or simply relax, this is a great place to stay.

<Content>Really enjoyed our stay at La Tortuga! Peaceful and beautiful! So nice to have El Bistro right there....breakfast was great(included in the stay). Had a really yummy dinner there as well. Mario makes a mean apples flambe! All the hotel/restaurant staff were so nice and friendly and helpful! (thanks Lisa!) Really liked that the hotel was just around the corner from 5th ave. Not too close but not too far! Our first day we went to one of the three beach clubs...Blucacao....more private than the others and simply beautiful. (do have to take a taxi there but soo worth it!) Our last day we just lounged around at the pool...very relaxing and quiet. Also went to Spa Itza in the Hotel for a massage. Loved it! Would definitely go back to La Tortuga!!! Wish we were still there!

<Title>“Best for the money in Playa del Carmen”
<Content>We found this hotel by chance. Looking to go back to Mexico after Argentina devaluated it's currency. If we wanted to vacation outside Argentina. Prior to 2001 we could afford 5 star hotels, but later, only 2 star was on our budget. We took our chance with La Tortuga. Because it´s room prices. Never got disapointed. After that first ocasion in 2004, we went back again in 2008. Hotel is clean, cozy, the rooms (even the standard ones) have air conditioner, a decent bathroom, good beds. We always used a queen size bed, and always stayed in the Standard rooms. You will find free internet. A great pool. Excellent front desk representatives. They are 4 blocks from Playa's downtown beach, but they have an arrangement with Mamita's (the trendiest beach club in Playa). It is 15-20 blocks away. There you will have towels, chairs and umbrella included in the hotel fare. All in all, an excellent hotel for the money paid in Playa del Carmen.

<Content>I've just returned from 5 nights at la Tortuga with my teenage son... We had previously toured round other parts of Mexico, but La Tortuga was the HIGHLIGHT of our trip! Great room/pool and grounds, but most of all, the staff really made our holiday special. Lisa on reception was FAB, and our fave barmen Marco and Fidel made us feel really welcome..and couldn't do more to make our stay unforgettable.. Le Bistro had the most magnificent food - especially the giant shrimps! Pool table was great to keep us amused, and also free www access at the bar. The pool was open till 11pm at night and lit really beautifully! Forget all the huge all-inclusive beach hotels in Playa - where you are an anonymous guest....go where you are treated like one of the family! I'll be back to Mexico, and La Tortuga will be my number one choice! Jo

<Title>“Wonderful staff, beautiful hotel.”
<Content>My fiance and I had the pleasure of staying at La Tortuga hotel for a week in February. As soon as we walked through the door, we were greeted by Lisa with a great big smile and a couple of refreshing drinks. As we were escorted to our room, the awe and beauty of the hotel was astounding. Our room was a standard, cozy room with everything we needed. The beds were comfortable, there was air conditioning if we needed it, a fan, and it overlooked the beautiful pool, restaurant and courtyard. El Bistro's food was amazing, we kept coming back for dinner because we quickly found out that no other restaurant on 5th avenue compared to it. Make sure you try the pear and gorgonzola salad. We were always so pleased at how attentive and nice all of the staff were. When we would pass them, they would always smile and say 'hola'. And the servers in the restaurant were incredible as well, thanks to all of you, especially Santiago, for making our stay so memorable. The only thing that surprised me about this hotel was that it was a further walk to the beach than I expected (about 20 minutes or so). Luckily, the walk was mainly on 5th avenue, so it was always interesting. The hotel provided fresh towels for the beach whenever you needed them and when you got to the beach, Mamitas beach club had everything you needed to get comfortable. Drinks are really expensive though. Make sure you get to the beach before 10am to get lounge chairs. The beach was busy but absolutely gorgeous and always worth the walk. The hotel was a little loud at night because of the bars closeby so be prepared for that. And the pool at the hotel looked nice, but was cold and a little dirty so it wasn't very inviting. All in all, the service we received here was incomparable to anywhere we've ever been, and the beauty of the hotel and the nearby beach were astounding. When we return to Playa we won't stay anywhere else.

<Title>“Living La Vida Buena!”
<Content>We just returned from a wonderful 6 day trip at the La Tortuga in Playa. We never had a honeymoon, so this trip was meant to be our delayed honeymoon. We asked for a romantic setup and that is exactly what La Tortuga delivered. Our room number was #218, which is a quiet & secluded superior junior suite. The room was beautifully decorated (and kept completely spotless and immaculate by our wonderful housekeeper every day). After checking in to our room, we immediately went to dinner. After we returned from dinner, we were very surprised to find our bed was decorated with 2 swans (formed from towels) and rose petals. The Jacuzzi was filled with hot water and rose petals, with a bucket of iced champaign and glasses. My husband looked at me, like I had planned this little surprise but I was just as surprised as him. Nice touch! Breakfast at the hotel (El Bistro) was free and delicious! The portions are so big that you are full all day long until dinner. My husband ate the spinach omelets every day, while I ate scrambled eggs, beans & tortillas with Pico). Breakfast comes with yummy bread and condiments and fresh juices and coffee. We were greeted by the same smiling faces every day but Daniel and Mickey kept us entertained most of the time during breakfast. My husband loves magic tricks so Daniel taught my husband a really cool magic trick and my husband taught them a magic trick too. The hotel bar is right next to the pool. Marco (our favorite bartender) was there every day with a smile on his face always asking what we would like to drink. He can make anything you ask, plus drinks that you’ve never heard of. He also makes a few ‘Marco Specials’ that are really good too! Happy Hour is only from 5:00-7:00pm but on our last day, he managed to stretch it out a bit more for us. Lisa works at the reception desk and was always there to give us wonderful recommendations for food and excursions. As we were leaving the hotel for the day, she would always ask us what we had planned for the day. Whenever we returned to the hotel she would always asked how our day was. She was a sweetheart and really helped us to make the best of our trip! The guys were always opening the hotel doors for us when we were coming in from our day. 5th avenue is a hop, skip and a jump from the hotel and the beach is a fun little 10 minute walk. La Tortuga has the best location, quality and service of any hotel we have ever stayed at. We created wonderful memories and great friendships while staying at the La Tortuga. Everyone here became our family away from home. We will definitely come back to Playa and stay at La Tortuga again!

<Title>“A great hotel, a couple of small negatives points only.”
<Content>We stayed 9 nights in La Tortuga recently. We had a swim up room which was nice and clean. The air con was a little loud but you get used to it. The room was big enough although I expected something a little roomier. The room doesn’t let in much natural light but it’s not bad. The hotel is very nice, the pool area is great. The hotel seemed quite quiet when we were there which is probably luck as there aren’t many seats near the pool to laze around on. We went to the beach one day but it is a fairly long walk and it’s busy most of the time. We couldn’t be bother to go again as you need to carry the towels and all the rest of the gear there. The hotel location is good. It’s right on 5th Av which is great for shopping. There were a couple of nights when we heard loud music. I guess it was from Coco Bongo. It went on very late. We enjoyed the food there, the breakfast was fine once you get your head around the menu. Some days we had to pay for water at breakfast which is a bit strange, most other things are free. I would also like to thank the staff for helping when I was sick. I got a stomach bug from something I eat or drank (not from the hotel) and was in bed for a couple of days while I got my energy back. The staff called a doc straight away and he came within 30 mins to check me over. Thanks! Overall we enjoyed our stay here, we found the weather a bit too warm for us with the high humidity. 9 nights was a bit long, we should have went for 5 or 6 and spent a few more days in New York or somewhere in the low 20’s. The house keepers were great. The room was well cleaned and we like the different towel designs every day.

<Title>“Best Vacation in Playa del Carmen”
<Content>We spent 4 nights at "La Tortuga" over the 4th July holiday. We have nothing but great things to say about the hotel, staff and service. The hotel is conveniently located in the middle of the tourist area in PDC (10 Av. between 10th and 12th street). The hotel's beach club (Mamitas), which is 8 blocks from the hotel, offers excellent service and the amenities are in great condition. The restaurant (Bistro) served traditional mexican breakfast. Best of all, it was included in the rate. The pool at the hotel was a great place to hang out apres the beach. There is a jacuzzi and an exercise swim area. The rooms were very clean and very well maintained. The entire staff at the hotel was incredibly friendly. They always made sure that our stay was enjoyable. Special thanks to Daniel the bellboy, Lisa and Bernardo at the reception desk and the guys at the bar and restaurant, who made our stay wonderful. If we're ever back in PDC we'll make it a point to stay at "La Tortuga". Margarita and Manuel (Mexico City/Philadelphia)

<Title>“Another great stay at La Tortuga - this time solo”
<Content>When planning a solo trip to Playa there's only one place I even considered staying - La Tortuga. It is a peaceful oasis and a perfect place for a few days of much needed R&R. The rooms are beautiful, comfortable, well-appointed. The grounds are gorgeous. The pool is a great place to cool off after a day at the beach. Happy hour is a nice way to meet fellow travelers or to just chill out with a book in a quiet corner or check up on friends and family back home from the free internet right there at the bar (Fidel makes the BEST mojitos in Playa). As a solo female traveler, security is of course a consideration and I cannot recommend La Tortuga highly enough for making one feel comfortable and well taken care of. Every single member of the staff is wonderful, from the front desk to the office to the restaurant. Speaking of which, El Bistro is a great place to eat, and the fact that a full breakfast is included with your stay is a real bonus. The hotel will provide you with towels and passes or coupons for either Mamitas or Zenzi beach clubs - try them both! Also during this trip, the hotel staff recommended the Bluecacao beach club as an out-of-town (about 10 mins by cab) alternative, and that club was beautiful and very nice - gorgeous setting, inifinity pool, amazing food and impeccable service. It was extremely quiet while I was there ( I was one of two or three other guests) but it was perfect - just what I needed! I will definitely return to La Tortuga - it is the perfect in town hotel when traveling solo, as a couple, or with a group of friends.

<Title>“Wonderful boutique hotel, oozes charm”
<Content>I was pleased that the FCO lifted the swine flu travel ban in May, as my partner and I were looking forward so much to staying at La Tortuga. This was our first trip to Mexico and although a serious topic, the local and global media, as per usual, like to create devastation wherever possible and the impact has been felt in Playa, an area where there has not been a single case! Onto the hotel itself. In a nutshell, I agree with the other travellers. A1 service, awesome room (we had 312 with rooftop jacuzzi, stunning), amazing oasis in the middle of a built-up area, great food at the adjacent Le Bistro, lovely quality breakfast, good cocktails and above all, we did not see or hear a child all week (11th-18th July) which was bliss. Also my partner and I were staying due to our 2nd anniversary and the team kindly laid on flowers on the bed (see photo) and a free bottle of local champagne. We did not venture out much during day due to crippling humidity (for me personally that is) but with two books, great drinks and food and fantastic staff, I was pleased, unusually for me, to spend a whole week just chilling out. In particular I must mention Marco who was exceptional. The only minor downsides are that the noise from the clubs can be VERY loud, however if you can sleep with the doors shut and with air con/fan on, sleep is OK. My only other comment would be beware the biting ants, or whatever they were. I have never seen so many people with bites and despite using anti-insect spray, we picked up 3-4 fresh bits every day. The locals also have this issue, but just a friendly comment, be prepared and purchase some repellent. The absolute beauty, effort in styling and quality of service makes this a 5 star all the way for me, but I must mark down the noisy clubs, giving it a very healthy and well deserved 4 out of 5 stars. We would return for sure to this oasis in Playa.

<Title>“Loved it!”
<Content>We had a great time in Playa and loved La Tortuga. Our Jr. Suite wasn't incredibly spacious, but the king size bed was very comfortable, the shower had plenty of pressure, our patio was comfortable and looked out over the beautiful pool area, and our rooftop deck with hot tub provided a pleasant way to end the evening. Happy hour at the pool from 5-7 every evening was lots of fun (and a nice way to transition from the beach to a night on the town.) Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with restaurant recommendations, excursions, etc. El Bistro was good - not amazing, but good. We took a tour of Spa Itza and thought it looked nice enough, but based on Tripadvisor reviews we opted for Veronica's Massage and received some really good massages at half the price. There is a bit of street noise at the hotel at night. It didn't keep us up, but if you are a light sleeper you might want to bring ear plugs (and request a room along 14th street rather than 10th ave.) Or, have an extra shot of tequila!!! Stay at La Tortuga. You will love it. Message me if you have any questions about the hotel or about places to eat.

<Title>“Best Stay Ever”
<Content>We spent a few days in Playa and La Tortuga was the best. The staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcomed and takes care of your every need. The restaurant staff remembered our names and greeted us each day. The food is excellent. The rooms were very very nice and clean. Ours overlooked the pool area which is wonderful. The setting is so tropical and you'd never know that you're in the midst of everything. The location is also perfect. A couple of blocks from the shopping and some great restaurants. This is definitely the place to stay if you want to experience local flavor. Can't wait to go back.........in November.

<Title>“AMAZING Stay at Hotel La Tortuga”
<Content>La Tortuga was the best place we could've stayed at in Playa. We did not want to be confined to a resort, but also wanted a luxurious stay. La Tortuga was perfect! It's a small boutique hotel, with a bungalow feel to the set up. You can choose rooms with a a jacuzzi, swim up, hammocks. I stayed in a regular room which was comfortable and clean. My friend stayed in a junior suite that had a private jacuzzi and view of the pool that was very nice as well. The hotel was kept in very good condition, pool was clean, restaurant was clean. The staff is so helpful and the sweetest people you'll meet, then again everyone in Playa was friendly. The free breakfast from 7-12 pm was a huge perk and very delicious. I'd recommend this hotel 10 times over and can't wait to go back!

<Content>This hotel was absolutely wonderful… very romantic and a wonderful escape from the world. If you are looking for a quick get away or you are on your honeymoon this is definitely a very beautiful place to be. The staff is super friendly and the restaurant has some great food. I did not care too much for the shower head in my room but a very small complaint to such a great place. Caution the pictures on their website do no do this place justice. You have to see it to really capture the beauty. Happy Travels to all… I hope you try this hotel.

<Title>“Best ever experience”
<Content>We just got back from Playa and after spending a week at La Tortuga, i must admit that i was pampered and serviced like never before. This hotel puts every other one to shame! Excellent service, impeccable personal touch - every member of the Tortuga family makes sure they know your name and your preferences and make sure you get the best ever vacation. We were upgraded to an amazing superior junior suite, had the best amenities and always felt very comfortable. The swimming pool is refreshing and stays open late; their restaurnt Bistro is not only delicious but extremely reasonably priced and the whole ambience is unmatched I can't wait to go back....

<Title>“Better than the "Best"”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here for our 11 day vacation - We needed a place to stay for 2 nights before we could check into our "Big Resort" The Tortuga was better and nicer than the "big resort" (the room was a little smaller but they made up for it in views, ameneties and hospitality) The breakfast at the Bistro was the best Eggs Benedict I have ever had! It was great to be a small block away from the main walking street. The people at the Tortuga were unbelievably friendly and helpful. I would deffinitely be going back next time we go to Playa del Carmen.

<Title>“My top choice once again!”
<Content>My fiance and I stayed at La Tortuga last October. This hotel is greatness. The service is top-notch... from the moment you check in and are greeted with a delicous "welcome drink" to the beautiful grounds and delicious (FREE) breakfast. The ONLY 2 things wrong with our stay at the time was the bathroom (no shower pressue and water kind of sprayed everywhere), and the standard room was a bit small but I was willing to overlook this since we didn't spend much time in our room anyway. I heard recently that the hotel has upgraded/improved all the bathrooms with glass doors, pillowtop mattresses, and replaced some of the windows of the rooms facing the street to block out noise. This is exactly the needed improvements for La Tortuga and I can't wait to stay there again!

<Title>“Never wanted to leave!!!!”
<Content>I love La Tortuga! Not sure where to begin. The gardens/pool area is so inviting. I could see coming to this hotel and never wanting to go to the beach in Playa! The gardens are lush and green - surrounding a pool that encompasses many levels and many small swimming areas. The loungers are so comfortable and the service so speedy - you never want to leave. My room was wonderful! The bed is soooo comfy. The water pressure in the shower so strong. The jacuzzi tub so relaxing. The staff so well trained and funny! Anna and Laura Bassi went above and beyond to make sure my stay was special. Mario from El Bistro had his staff treat me like a queen. I loved every single minute of my stay at La Tortuga! I was only able to leave because I KNEW I'd be back! Otherwise...I'd be there still!!!

<Title>“Best place I have ever stayed! A slice of heaven that is 100x better!”
<Content>Just got back July 3rd from a 5 night stay. What a place, what a place! Everything good I read on the web was true - this place is the best! Don't second guess, and wonder "IF"... This is a true hidden gem. Booking a place that you read about can often be a bit un-nerving – especially for my husband, whom had never been to Mexico except on a cruise. I, on the other hand, have traveled a lot. EVERYTHING about this place is amazing!!! From my first email to Anna I knew this was the right spot for a romantic getaway with my hubby. Responses were immediate and very helpful. Anna and Lisa always got back to me within a day. We booked the Standard Plus and at the last minute I upgraded to the Superior Junior Suite as a surprise for my husband (first time away from the kids in 7 years). When we got there we were greeted by Berny and 2 great drinks. Then taken on a tour of the hotel - The grounds and pool are amazingly kept - and then to our room. It had flower petals and a towel swan on the bed and a bottle of champagne waiting for us. The room was amazing. We were in Room 101. Had our own private pool, a huge Jacuzzi tub and a cool shower head right in the middle of the tub. We never used the tub, as our own private pool was so inviting everyday. I would recommend this to anyone! Breakfast is everyday starting at 7am and goes till 11 (maybe noon??). You get a FULL great breakfast, served at your table. It was enough to keep us going thru the day, only needing a few snacks, until dinner. The wait staff always saw you coming and escorted you to your seat. They got to know you by name.  The Eggs Benedict and the Egg Enchiladas are wonderful. Ask for extra pico to go with. Happy hour is from 5-7 with 2 for 1 drinks and they make a mean Cancun Margarita. The bar tenders also like to experiment, as well. Great place to meet others and learn what they had done that day, get suggestions of activities, etc. Also a great way to learn that every room in this boutique hotel is different. I had read at times that the pool could be cool – NEVER was. It was great! (the swim up rooms looked amazing as well…) The location is wonderful – just one block off of 5th Avenue where all of the shops/vendors/restaurants are located. We would walk 5th Ave, buy stuff, bring it back to the hotel, and head out again. It was great to have it so close to everything, yet feel like you were in your own private, quiet world. The beach was only 3 blocks away. Lisa and Berny were great in helping us know what to do and where to go. When we got back from a trip they always welcomed you and asked how your day was. it's great to be a person and not just a number, like in the large all-inclusive places. They made all of the arrangements for whatever we wanted to do/go/ and see. We got a great tip – if you want to spend a lot of time in the water snorkeling then go to Xel-Ha and do NOT combine with the Tulum trip. If we did combine the two trips, we would have had about 3 hours less at Xel-Ha. We just took a cab on our own to Tulum one day and this gave us plenty of time to do our own thing. Lisa gave us great ideas for places to eat. There is a great chocolate shop at the round-about (the brownies are to die for… be sure to bring one back for Lisa). Another great place to eat is Fusion. Tikki torches on the beach, jazz in the background, and a fire dance show at 10pm. The fish tacos and caesar salad are great. There are no words that can truly express what a wonderful place this is. Pictures do not do it justice – you cannot capture the pure warmth, emotion, and friendship, along with every detail of the facilities and the rooms. We will be back to Playa and the only place we will ever stay is La Tortuga.  (Note: I will post photos when I get them downloaded from the camera)

<Title>“A welcoming small hotel”
<Content>Overall, we liked this hotel a lot and would definitely consider staying there again. I'll give a quick summary, then pros and cons. Summary: A reasonably good value, but you could probably find rooms that are comparable for less. It's beautifully maintained and well located with a friendly, welcoming staff. The courtyard, pool, bar, and restaurant are attractive and comfortable. Landscaping and architecture are attractive. Staff were helpful with other travel arrangements like shuttle from Cancun, tours, and diving. PRO: Very friendly staff, especially in the bistro and at the bar. Great happy hour, with fine capirinias, margaritas, and mojitos made right, to order. Good breakfasts included. Scrupulously clean and well maintained. Comfortable bed and luxurious towels. Good lighting, decent number of outlets. AC works great (if noisy). Good location just off the heart of 5th Avenue. Good recommendations on tour guide (Pepe Lopez of Mayan Expeditions), scuba (Pluto Dive, Alberto), and flawless pick-up from Cancun. Good free wireless connection accessible in most of hotel; free internet access (1 PC) in bar. CONS: Rooms (we were in a standard plus) are a bit small: no seating area except in the unsecured balcony, no drawers and little closet space, no shelfs in bathroom, not enough drying hooks. Got bad directions from the front desk staff twice (to dive shop, to book store). AC was noisy (but effective) If you are at the south end of the hotel, I think noise from Coco Bongo and Club Dubai would be bad. We were on the north end, 3rd floor, and could hear it but it was not too bad.

<Title>“perfection from the minute we arrived”
<Content>Our stay at La Tortuga far exceeded our expectations from the minute we arrived. I had originally planned to stay at La Tortuga in May on a ladies only trip but the swine flu derailed our plans so my husband and I rescheduled for last week. Anna was amazingly helpful for the last few months in answering my questions, helping to make decisions about our trip etc etc. She knew I bought the trip for my husband's birthday and we arrived to our beautiful suite complete with balloons, flowers, champagne and delicious cheesecake. We had an amazing Junior Suite with a large outside private patio area with a lounge area great for naps in the afternoon and a rooftop jacuzzi and lounge area. The bed was large and comfortable, the A/C cold and the bathroom roomy and super new and updated. The ground of the hotel are immaculate and the staff is incredible. We tried both beach clubs and loved them for different reasons. The location is great, you are steps from 5th avenue but can feel a world away if you want quiet and relaxation. El Bistro is great for breakfast and dinner. I couldn't imagine staying ANYWHERE else after La Tortuga. We checked out some other hotels and they are clearly the best in Playa!

<Title>“Romantic, Beautiful and Clean!!”
<Content>Ok, to start I did not stay at this hotel. My sister and her boyfriend did. I stayed at the Royal Hideaway. La Tortuga was amazing and my boyfriend an I found ourselves heading over to hang out at my sisters hotel quite a few times. The pool was beautiful and the staff was amazing! The hotel itself is absolutely charming and the rooms are a perfect size. My sister stayed in the standard plus room and she and I thought it was great. The balcony was a good size and with a charming view of the pool surrounded by beautiful flowers and trees. Im surprised by the previous travelers review of the bathroom because I was quite impressed by it and hotel the location is great (central to everything). Check out the place for yourselves...I included pictures I took. Oh and if your worried about traveling to Mexico...stop! It's fine! The nightlife as usual was amazing and the Mexican goverment has done an amazing job at protecting the Yucatan from the flu. GO TO MEXICO!!!! :)

<Title>“Great Stay at La Tortuga!”
<Content>Hola, Recently, my wife and I visited Hotel La Tortuga, Playa del Carmen, Mexico. I had no desire to travel to Mexico due to all of the recent bad press concerns about the flu, etc. We vacation every year to a different island in the Caribbean, usually at All-Inclusives, so when we arrived I was a little hesitant as to what to expect. This is a small boutique hotel in the heart of Playa del Carmen and I must say that this little oasis of a hotel is a true gem. Our room was a Superior Junior Suite and it was excellent. The only thing that I missed and thought that the room could have used was a dresser for clothes storage. This could have easily fit under the flat screen TV that was mounted on the wall across from the bed. I didn't like stacking our clothes on shelves in the closet. Although the closet was roomy, it would have been nice to have a chest of drawers for additional storage. The air conditioning worked great and the cleanliness of the room was A+. The king bed was excellent...very comfortable. Our housekeeper with her decorative art (towel animals) was excellent. The hotel staff could not do enough for you and always with a smile. The food at El Bistro was terrific. We ate at restaurants outside of the hotel at least nine times and the hotel was better or equal to anywhere we ate. The prices are good as well. The pool was a great retreat after spending the day at Mamitas or Zenzi. It was always nice to go back to the pool and relax. Mamitas has the better beach but Zenzi has the better food. But, both were very nice. If you need any food or supplies while staying in Playa, Walmart was a three block walk from the hotel and had everything you could possibly want, including a great bakery! One of our favorite aspects of this hotel is being just one block from Fifth Avenue and all of the restaurants, bars, shops, etc. Everything that Playa del Carmen has to offer is within walking distance. The Fat Cat Catamaran day sail is an excursion that we highly recommend. It was a four hour cruise of snorkling, lunch, swimming and beverages. The crew was fantastic. The boat leaves from Puerto Adventures where they also have swimming with the dolphins. This is a very clean, safe, beautiful and well run tourist operation. Our final comment on the hotel is the concern about the night club Coco Bongo. If Coco Bongo would simply turn down the volume and the banging of the bass, most people would probably never know that they were nearby, especially with the AC on. It didn't stop us from having a wonderful vacation, that's for sure! Hotel A+ Hotel Staff A+ Service A+ Pool A+ Cleanliness A+ Food and Restaurant Staff A+ Special thanks to Luis at El Bistro and our favorite, Poncho, from the Front Office. We will definately be back for a return visit. Pablo & Michele Boston, MA USA

<Title>“dissapointed”
<Content>We chose this hotel based on the great reviews. The website made it seem luxurious, comfortable and clean. But......The rooms were very muggy and the A/C was loud. The street noise was loud and made it difficult to sleep and the beds were not very comfortable. The most horrific thing was that the shower had mildew/mold. Maybe there is just a different standard in Mexico..... The staff was friendly, location excellent, and the food was pretty good.

<Title>“Wonderful hotel”
<Content>We loved this hotel... the interior is lovely, lots of foliage and a pool winding around. At check-in, you are greeted with a tall glass of lovely juice. The staff is wonderful. We stayed in two different rooms. Our first room was on the second floor and was neat and clean, but small. Our second room was one of the swim-up rooms, and we loved it. A wonderful little patio with steps down into the pool Only two drawbacks to this hotel... 1) the pool is freezing cold. It does not get much sun due to all the foliage around. 2) It's about 6-7 blocks to Mamacita's beach club (however, the walk is down 5th, and you can window shop :) We will definitely be back to La Tortuga.

<Title>“Nice place if you like to stay if you like night club noise all night!”
<Content>We have only just got back from our trip to Playa Del Carmen and stayed at La Tortuga for 3 nights and playa palms for 7 nights. I have to say that I was disappointed with our stay at La Tortuga after reading the reviews. The hotel itself is well maintained and pool area pretty and quiet thru out the day, BUT the noise at night from Coco Bongo nightclub ( a couple of doors away) was HORRIBLE!! We had a swim up room which would have been the furtherest point away from the noise but this did not make a difference.The noise did not let up till 5am every night! Our room was very small and dark, in fact the smallest we have ever stayed in. I would not be happy with this room again, so maybe if you are considering staying there go for a standard room and save your money. The staff were lovely and very helpful and everything was well maintained and clean, but I have been asked if I would recommend this little hotel to my friends and unfortunately I would have to say because of the noise and the location of its beach club...no! The distance to their beach club Marmitas is a LONG walk, and unless you get there early you dont get a seat. It is very crowded and everyone is virtually sitting on top of each other.. So to sum it up, nice boutique hotel, nice breakfast included, helpful pleasant staff, bad room, VERY NOISY at night ,too far away from beach, but good location to 5th Avenue.

<Title>“As Good as it Gets”
<Content>It's interesting to see a bad review of La Tortuga during the same week that we were there. We too had a junior suite with rooftop whirlpool. We LOVED our room. Beautiful balcony overlooking the pool. This hotel is tops on service (Alfonso is great!) and the bar makes the best drinks I have ever had (Gracias Fidel y Daniel). Having breakfast included is such a nice perk. I travel a lot for work and this hotel is the most wonderful I have ever stayed at. PERFECT!!!

<Title>“Totally Terriffic”
<Content>My husband and I spent our 15th wedding anniversary at La Tortuga. We had a wonderful time. From the time we were greeted by Alfonso with 2 fruitful delicious drinks, I knew it was an anniversary I would never forget! Our room(219) was overlooking the pool. It was a good size with a mini refrigerator, robes, slippers, flat screen television, jacuzzi, balcony, and lots more!! The location was right off 5th street where all the action goes on in Playa. Everything you needed was within walking distance like beach, food, shopping, parking, and the church. We enjoyed the staff and their hospitality. Fidel, the bartendar, is very courteous and made some great "mojitos." The breakfast at the Bistro was very delicious. They arranged for flowers to be there upon our arrival. Overall, our stay was an unforgettable one and we plan on going back!!

<Title>“My definition of Heaven on Earth”
<Content>We stayed in Playa the week they lifted travel advisories (swine flu). -although that was a coincidence, we had already decided to go anyway. For weeks we debated whether to cancel our trip or not. I contacted Lisa and Anna several times, and was assured that it was safe to visit. We were so glad we went!! This was our wedding anniversary vacation and our BEST vacation ever. The experience at the hotel and Playa in general made us want to renew our vows again (talk about having a good time!). We stayed in a superior junior suite with a private jacuzzi in the rooftop. The room was amazing, the food at El Bistro was the best we had in Playa. The pool was great and my husband really enjoyed the aquatic threadmill it has. All the hotel employees went above and beyond and made us feel so welcomed. Special thanks to: Lisa, Anna, Alfonso, Fidel (the bartender- order the Fidel special!), Bernardo (great suggestions for tours!!), Enrique - night security who at 12:30am volunteered to go to the pharmacy to get benadryl when i developed a random yet serious allergic reaction to something i ate), Isabel & Maria for the wonderful massages and the entire staff at El Bistro who organized the most romantic private dinner for the night of our anniversary (as well as our regular meals). We are definitely going back and staying at La Tortuga....our definition of Heaven on earth.

<Title>“Absolutely Amazing! Can't wait to go back!”
<Content>Alright, where to start! This hotel is everything you want while on vacation....we had a Junior Suite, a beautiful room, beautiful patio overlooking the pool. An absolute bargain for this time of year on the price as well! Not a chance you'd find this quality of a hotel or room during May in any of the States! The service is impeccable, and very welcoming! Everyone is so nice, and will do anything you want! The hotel staff is by far the best I've ever experienced. El Bistro is great as well! We ventured off onto 5th and tried some restaurants, always finding that it didn't compare to the quality of El Bistro! The staff at this restaurant was top notch as well! We also found the location to be great! We loved being so close to everything, yet whenever you wanted you could be in the confines of the pool area and feel that you are on your own resort! It was perfect and sooooooo relaxing! We simply can't wait to go back! Thanks again to all the staff!

<Title>“A Night in Paradise!”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel La Tortuga for only one night about 2 weeks ago and it was by far the highlight of our month in Playa del Carmen. I can not say enough about how much we loved the hotel, our room and the staff. We had stayed at La Tortuga many times in the past, and though we have always enjoyed it, it exceeded even our own high expectations. Because we love Playa del Carmen so much, we tend to go for long stretches at a time (a month or more), making it more practical to stay in an apartment instead of a hotel. This time we made a huge mistake in our choice of apartments and found ourselves in a bit of a dump. A few weeks in, we really needed to splash out for the night and checked into room 116 at Hotel La Tortuga. It was amazing!!!! It is almost a free standing bungalow, there is another one right next door, it is not in the main building. We had our own little deck with a hammock looking out into the pool garden. The room was clean, simple, elegant (I LOVE that bathroom with the sinks sitting on top of a beautiful piece of wood) and the tub/shower was large and lovely. But the best part, the best part by faaaar, was the jacuzzi tub upstairs on our own private roof terrace! We took a bubble bath under the stars! It was amazing! And the bed was so comfortable, I refused to go to the gym in the morning, I wanted to stay there until the last minute! I should say, about the bed, some people prefer a really firm mattress, I am not one of those people. This bed was so soft I just sunk right in and never wanted to leave. There was a really lovely flat screen TV in the room, but to be honest, we never turned it on. We stayed in the bubble bath/jacuzzi on the roof most of the night. We spent the day by the pool which is situated in a really lush garden. It is its own little oasis in there. The architecture of the entire hotel seems to be created in an organic way around large trees that have probably grown there for decades. It is a wonderland in there. A grown up wonderland. The pool is serpentine and there are little bridges and various seating/lounging areas. There is a jacuzzi on a small wooden deck/island in the middle of the pool, but to get to it, you only have to wade across the shallowest portion of the pool, ankle deep or so. Or you can come around from the back side and cross over a bridge. And at night the entire garden is lit up with twinkling lights hung in trees and torches near the pool. Yes, at dusk, there are mosquitos. But you can't have a lush, tropical pool garden in paradise without them. And Fidel, the bartender, had some repellant on hand to scare them away. We ate lunch and had drinks poolside, but decided to go to the restaurant for dinner. The menu changes from lunch to dinner, but we both loved our meals there. In fact, we went back for lunch another couple of times before we left Playa because the pechuga de pollo a la plancha (grilled chicken) was so delicious and, frankly, an amazing bargain! Oh, and the guacamole was delicious, too!!!! They also had a nice selection of salads (I had the scallop salad which was really good!). Anyway, we really loved it. Everyone was kind and attentive, the room was gorgeous, the ambiance is not to be beat and the restaurant was really good. If we could afford to stay there every night for a month, we would have done it in a heartbeat. We would, and certainly will go back to La Tortuga. In the 4 years since we first stayed there, the hotel has expanded and improved and still never lost its unique charm and character.

<Title>“Home away from home......”
<Content>From the moment you walk through the front double glass doors you are greated with a friendly smile and a warm hello......There were two champagne glasses filled with some wonderful concotion that we still do not what it was but appreciated every sip.......We were there only what seemed a few minutes to say hellos grab our drinks and we were taken to our room......The moment you walk into this place you know you are somewhere very special....... Our room was perfection.......We entered into a balcony overlooking the pool....The grounds are pristine from the grass being cut by hand clippers to the guys sweeping the decks every thirty minutes to keep them clean from any falling leaves, to the guys skimming the pool with the baskets to keep the pool perfect......I love that pool.......I love this place...... From the patio we walked into out room and both E and I went ahhhhhhh......Kind sized bed......two windows that opened up into the room that allowed you a nice breeze and to view our little paradise within paradise......A built in Amoir unit for our things and in between that was our flat screen tv.......The bathroom I would love to have here........ The staff from the top to bottom was the best I have ever been around....We did not feel like guests but part of a family......Everyone had smiles on their faces and asked If there was anything they could do for us around every corner.....I have also never seen a staff work so hard at a place and yet be so happy....I loved talking to one of the grounds keeper about the Mavericks and Dallas in general...... The staff at the restaurant morning, noon, or night was a delight to be around........The food there was as good as any food we have ever eaten in or around Playa....For the price, the service, and the presentation we spent alot of time there.......Breakfast was complimentary....That blew me away.....They had a great breakfast menu and had many things too choose from but E and I got hooked on the eggs benedict with coffee and orange juice....... The bartenders in a day knew what we were drinking and were as attentive as all the rest of the staff and the one thing I loved about the bar is they served your drinks in glasses......No plastic here......We drank our Don Julio Reposado in small brandy like snifters assuring us no spillage what so ever...... We loved everything that La Tortuga has to offer and as I had siad earlier during the week when we were there it has taken the number one spot for us to stay while in Playa.....If you have stayed at the rest now stay at the best because you will not be disapointed.....It took us three days to finally say we need to get out and see Playa........ We would also like to sincerly thank Anna, Laura, and Lisa for taking such good care of us during our stay........They are beautiful ladies inside and out and we would have liked to spent more time with them but they have these things called jobs there........

<Title>“Small, but the Cockroaches come free”
<Content>I really wanted to like the La Tortuga Hotel, so many reviews are glowing... but my stay was horrible. When we arrived in our room, #21, I noticed how small it was, the "Queen" bed was more like a "Full" and that there was a strange smell in the room, but I thought maybe it just needed to be aired out. Took a shower and the curtain just would not hold the water in the shower, bathroom a mess, and that is when I saw the first rather large Roach. I killed it and didn't tell my wife, she hates bugs. When we got back to the room that night, the sewage smell was still there and then I heard a scream as my wife moved her bag and the Roaches went running. I went down to the front desk, but the Security Guard on duty said there was nothing he could do, but to take up my complaint in the morning. After I killed a few more Roaches I had enough and caught 2 under one glass and 1 under another, then I made the Security Guard look in the room and THEN he agreed to move us. The new room still had a bad shower curtain that always seemed to come loose. Now these rooms I am talking about were "Standard" I was told the only difference from a "Standard" and a "Standard Plus" was a view of the pool, could not be more wrong, the "Standards" didn't seem to received the new upgrades that the other rooms had. The next night we got back late again (hey we were on vacation) and went to set the alarm, that didn't work. Now I called the front desk but was told it was too late to place a wake-up call... and I could not make the person at the front desk understand that I could not call at 6:00 am for a 7:00 am wake-up call AHHHH. Now the staff was nice, but I had lunch at the hotel one day and the waiter said it was 200 pesos, I said I wanted it charged to the room and when the bill came for me to sign it was for only 160 pesos... still a bargain, but I don't like being conned. The last night we were there I killed yet another Roach, didn't tell my wife until we checked out. Then a friend pointed out that we probably had the Roach problem because the rooms were right above the restaurant. The same place we had been to... I felt sick. To sum up - Roaches in room 21 & 22, small, showers curtains were horrible, bring your own alarm clock. Do not book a "Standard" Best bet stay somewhere else! Hope this helps, there are so many good reviews.... it is up to you, I had a bad experience.

<Title>“Not stayed but wanted to review on service”
<Content>So we unfortunately had to cancel our stay at La Tortuga for our honeymoon at the end of this month. Totally gutted! But I wanted just to quickly write in praise of their communication and service. All elements of my direct booking were handled with profession and I had brilliant communication from them when trying to arrange something special for my new husband on his birthday during our stay. We have just been forced to cancel and they couldn't have been more understanding. My money has been returned without hassle and straight away. Bless them. I wish them the best during what must be a difficult time and I will definately be trying to holiday there in the future!

<Title>“I cannot wait to go back! Great, great hotel!”
<Content>This is truly a great place to stay. Right in the middle of the town, a block from the beach... and serene as can be! The hotel is set up like a little resort with a great pool, tree, plant area in the middle that's so fresh and tranquil. You never would know it was there if you didn't peak in. I had a great two-story room with roof-top hot tub and sunny areas/table/hammock. It was really great and cannot wait to stay there again. The breakfast was great, and all the food from the restaurant was delicious. The guacamole alone was worth it- so fresh! Service and staff was amazing, friendly, fast... just what I want when I'm on vacation.

<Title>“Exceptional Hotel!”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga last week for our Honeymoon. We were in room 117 which is a superior junior suite. We were there for 1 week. The reservation process was very easy. Anna at the hotel responds immediately to email and made it a very stress free process.We paid in advance and received a considerable discount. We arrived to the hotel via a private transfer arranged by them. Smooth sailing with the transfer. Upon check in, we were greeted with great fruit drinks and Bernando went over all of the details of our stay with us. Our luggage was then brought to our brilliant room. We had first floor room on the pool with a rooftop jacuzzi. It was a very nice room The bed was very comfortable and th IPod dock in the room was very convenient. It had a large jacuzzi tub and a rooftop jacuzzi that could be hot or cold. This was very nice late night and early in the day. Our patio with 2 chairs was right on the pool and private. The grounds were meticulously taken care of. There was always someone around sweeping around the pool, or cleaning up. Housekeeping was great and there was towel art everyday in our room. The best thing about the hotel was the SERVICE! Everyone was so friendly and helpful. We never wanted for anything. Daniel and Fidel at the bar made delicious mojitos. They also endured my bad Spanish. They worked very hard and made high quality drinks. It was a pleasure having them as bartenders for the week! The pool area was great and we spent many days relaxing by the pool. We also went to Blue Cacao beach club which was arranged by the hotel. This place was secluded and had excellent food and service. It was about a 10-15 minute cabride from the hotel.It was worth the drive and was one of the best days of the trip. We did not venture to Mamitas as it was too crowded for our taste. The food at El Bistro was very good and a great value. We also had 25 percent off for one of our meals. Breakfasts were included in the price and were very hearty. The eggs benedict and Mexcican style breakfasts were a nice way to start the day. I just cannot say enough about how great this hotel was. The location, food, drinks, and especially the service were all top notch! We plan on returning next year for our First Anniversary. Thank you La Tortuga!

<Title>“As good as it gets in Playa...”
<Content>I guess this is just another glowing review of La Tortuga Hotel but I feel obligated to give credit where credit is due. This hotel is perfection.... quiet, small, great service, excellent location, etc. The staff is super friendly and helpful, the pool is lovely and private, the rooms are comfortable, spare and clean. The restaurant is great, the food delicious. The included breakfast is way more elaborate than the usual "continental" offering, with freakishly yummy Mayan coffee and great Mexican heuvo offerings. The wait staff is sweet and considerate. Located just a block from 5th Ave and all hub-bub, you can't expect it to be deadly silent at night but it's only the usual street sounds and local discos that can be heard echoing in the distance. If you want total silence, don't stay in Playa. This hotel is a gem, I hesitate to review it so glowingly as I fear it will be impossible to get into in the future.

Then our bags were whisked away to room 117. It has a pool view with a jacuzzi on the roof top. Highly recommend having the Superior Suite. The beds were so comfy and the food at El Bistro is fantastic with great pricing. Next time we come to Mexico we are definitely staying at La Tortuga!

<Title>“Wonderful vacation!”
<Content>We went to Mexico for the first time this past March. Our stay at La Tortuga was fabulous. The service and staff at the hotel are wonderful. They truly go out of their way to make your vacation enjoyable and stress less. We used their service to and from the airport and that too was hassle free. Our room was spotless and was ample in size (standard plus). We ate at the Bistro for dinner two of our nights and really liked that restaurant as much as, if not more than any other place that we ate. The service at the restaurant is excellent. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at La Tortuga the next time we visit Playa del Carmen.

<Title>“Fantastic in every way”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga from 21-25 March 2009 as part of our honeymoon. When we arrived we were given a cool drink and able to check in much earlier than normal. They showed us to our room and they had decorated the bed with rose petals, towels shaped like kissing swans, and a bottle of bubbly was chilling. The most amazing part of our room was that if you went out onto the balcony there was a little spiral staircase, leading up to our own rooftop hideaway. It had a jacuzzi and couch areas, just gorgeous for relaxing in the beautiful sunshine. The hotel is in a fantastic location really close to Avenida Quinta and Calle Corazon. The beach passes were a great idea but unfortunately we showed up too late to Mamita's and couldn't find a seat - oh well! Breakfast was fairly basic but nice with enough options that we didn't get tired of it during our stay. A fantastic hotel with excellent service. Really, really didn't want to leave and wanted to take the rooftop with us!

<Title>“Best boutique hotel, ever”
<Content>We booked La Tortuga after reading all of the wonderful reviews here on trip advisor, and can confirm they are absolutely true. Highlights: 1) Fidel the bartender and the entire bar staff. They went above and beyond on every occasion. We brought him a fresh coconut from the beach, and he expertly carved into it with a machete and made us the most delicious umbrella drink we've ever tried. FYI- you'll notice the bartenders all take the utmost care in preparing cocktails. They take a straw and take taste tests, before adding a splash of juice, a pinch more rum, whatever it takes to make your drink perfect. By the way, 2 for 1 happy hour is great deal! 2) The pool and setting. Despite what a lot of folks have said about the cold water, once you jump in it is actually quite enjoyable. Plus, around happy hour time, you're bound to find someone hanging around the hot tub, drink in hand, who will be able to point you to a fun activity or good restaurant. 3) Breakfast. Very delicious. Try the cactus. Would definitely recommend for a romantic getaway!

<Title>“La Tortuga is a true gem!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at Hotel La Tortuga two years ago and have been thinking about it ever since then. We returned for a 4 night stay last week (end of March). We absolutely love this hotel! The grounds are beautiful with lush, tropical vegetation, and the staff is incredibly friendly. They make you feel right at home and are so attentive. Reserving the room was very quick and easy. Last time, we stayed on the third floor in a standard-plus room with a balcony and view of the pool. This time we stayed in a standard room on the second floor with a smaller balcony looking out over the pool. The standard and standard-plus rooms are small but very clean. There wasn't a huge difference between the standard vs. standard-plus rooms, but I don't think many of the standard rooms have balconies, and we really enjoyed having one. The breakfast at the hotel is phenomenal, particularly because it's included with the price of the room! We loved the fresh juices (I recommend the papaya juice) and the "Mayan" omelette - eggs, peppers, mushrooms, spinach with a side of black beans and yuca (or maybe potatoes?). You're allowed to choose one juice, one hot beverage, and one main dish. The portions are generous, and they also give you plentiful bread and jam/butter, so you can really fill up. We've had both lunch and dinner at the hotel restaurant (El Bistro) and enjoyed our meals there. The hotel gives you a 25% discount on dinner one night at the restaurant. There are a lot of good deals around town for happy hour, but we preferred to relax by the bar area/pool at La Tortuga during happy hour (5-6pm) and enjoyed their 2 for 1 drinks. Although the pool area at La Tortuga is very nice, we took advantage of the free beach club passes every day. We really like Mamitas Beach Club, which is about a 10 minute walk away. Most of the walk is on Quinta Avenida (5th Ave) and goes by very quickly. Mamitas is a beautiful beach with very fine white sand that never seems to get hot. Some days the water was calmer than others, but it was always a pretty turquoise color and warm. During our trip the air temperature was usually in the mid 80s during the day (low 70s at night), but there was a constant breeze that kept you cool. If you want a palapa to get some shade, I'd recommend getting there early (i.e. before 10am), however, palapas open up throughout the day. One day we went to a newer beach club called Blucacao (again getting free passes from La Tortuga). It was a 5-10 minute cab ride away (~$8-10 each way), but we thought it was well-worth the trip for a day of relaxing in a small and secluded beach club by shallow pools that look out over the beach. The beach is much smaller than Mamitas and less attractive on either side of Blucacao, but the stretch right in front of the pool area is very nice. Overall, we love vacationing in Playa del Carmen and think that La Tortuga is the perfect place to stay. I'm already dreaming of our next trip there!

<Title>“A Must Stay!”
<Content>My two friends and I spent a fabulous week at La Tortuga this March (2009). Looking for a fun getaway for 3 single 20-something girls, we opted for La Tortuga thanks to a friends recommendation. We loved it! The hotel staff was awesome! They made perfect recommendations for restaurants - we didn't have a bad meal - where to go, what to do, etc. They were very attentive be it with taking bags, delivery towels, etc to the room promptly, showering us with welcome drinks, and were just overall friendly. The waiters and bartenders were so nice too! Two for one happy hour each night from 5-6pm was a treat when most hotel guests would gather at the bar for the hour. It was very low key and relaxing. Definitely a good place for couples - there were lots - but also great if you're just looking for a quiet getaway. 100% recommended!

<Title>“Wonderful Stay at La Tortuga”
<Content>La Tortuga is a small, intimate hotel right in the center of town. I guess the only better location is right on the beach, but with that, you are off the main strip of 5th avenue. So, that stated, you can't get a better location than La Tortuga. I loved stepping out of the hotel and turning the corner to be right on Fifth Avenue with all the action. We stayed in a standard room and it was cute, clean and just fine. The air temperature in the room was perfect at all times. We never heard any sounds at night from Coco Bongo. We made some suggestions to the front office staff, and within 24 hours, 2 out of 3 of our suggestions were in our room. We were amazed! The staff are very attentive and nice. I know lots of readers wonder why it got a #1 rating. At first, you wonder as it is small and just an average place, especially if you are used to the 4/5 Star resorts and such, but then you start to see the attentiveness of the staff, appreciate how clean your room is and how comfortable the beds are and the sereneness of floating around the pretty pool without anyone bothering you or making noise. This hotel is comfortable for a single person alone or even a family. I will never stay at an all inclusive resort again. We felt safe our entire trip. The breakfasts are good, but in general El Bistro was just average, but my guess it will become even better as they are very attentive to feedback. Yes, internet is slow, but it was nice having a computer to use. And the Mamitas Beach Club is just a short walk away. We enjoyed the tiny talk there - no big deal at all and there were plenty of chairs for everyone. I would recommend to anyone and we will definitely go back.

<Title>“Lovely hotel”
<Content>This is a lovely hotel if you want to be near the center of the action in Playa del Carmen. The staff was wonderfully attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed the happy hour from 5-6pm, where we met some interesting people. The inner pool and solarium area are very nice, pretty quiet (we thought) and generally laid back. It would have been nice to be located directly on the beach, but being away also has its advantages. We stayed in a standard plus room and found it to be nice. There wasn't a huge amount of space, but we really didn't need it since we did not spend very much time in our room. We were also able to access the wireless internet perfectly well in our hotel room on the third floor. The computer in the bar area is quite slow, however. We didn't have a problem with the noise from 10th street or the clubs. The restaurant was not so special, but overall the prices for food and drinks were very reasonable. All in all, we had a wonderful stay at the hotel and would definitely consider going back.

<Title>“charming retreat-great location-wonderful staff”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from La Tortuga. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. The layout of the hotel with the pool and lounge within the center of the room made a very peaceful and charming retreat from the craziness of Playa. It is one block from the famous 5th Avenue, right in the center of the action, yet quiet once inside. The room was small and bed firm, but was fine for us.

<Title>“Hotel La Tortuga”
<Content>We spent the week of March 8th, 2009 at the Hotel La Tortuga and were pleased with the hotel. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and maid service was good. Location to 5th Avenue is good. The only downside is beach access. The hotel offers vouchers for beach access with chairs, umbrella, etc but these were not available late in the morning and there was a considerable walk to get there. However, there are plenty of other places offering the same thing for $8 to $10. Overall, we were happy with our visit and would do it again.

<Title>“Adequate with some surprises”
<Content>My girlfriend and I stayed for three days at La Tortuga for a long weekend. Generally the hotel is quite nice. Average accomadations very typical of Mexico. Bar is quite nice solarium is a great touch. Happy hour from 5p to 6p language barrier a problem at bar so happy hour not really a big deal. Spa Itza is attached provided generally adequate service. El Bistro is very nice nothing special typical Mexican resort food. Some issues with non guests entering hotel in the evening. Staff provided us with an additional two hour extention of our room on check out day for inconvience of being woke up at 3 am by strangers knocking on our door. I guess thats fair if not satisfying. Over all a good experience wouldn't return as there are too many other small hotels in PDC that are on beach at which im sure experience would be about the same. One thing worth noting Blue Cacao Beach Club is accessible through La Tortuga. It is a short but somewhat confusing cab ride away. It is clearly worth the effort. 5 star service and food with miles of a nearly private beach and beautiful calm clear water. Way better than the Mamitas experience. Have to agree with other New york reviewer cant understand why this hotel is rated #1 unless playa just isnt all that great. Overall good value for basic services

<Title>“Amazingly Serene And Pleasant”
<Content>Stayed with husband and teenage daughters. Our first time in Mexico. What a fab place to stay. Perfect place to stay. Staff warm and friendly. Drinks on arrival even though it was after 9pm. Very attentive staff. Safe area for teenagers to walk around. Extremely clean. Close to laundry, ATM, beaches, shops. Room small and noisy due to proximity to street but minor distractions. Food in the restaurant was very well presented and delicious. The waiter (Daniel?) very attentive as they all were. We will definitely be returning and telling all our friends and family. A wonderful trip. I love Playa del Carmen and the people.

<Title>“Great Atmosphere and Service”
<Content>My wife and I stayed in here for our belated honeymoon in March. We had room 101 which came with a private pool. We really enjoyed our stay due to the service of the staff and the general quaintess of the hotel. Most of the other reviews seem to hold fairly true as far the pros and cons of this hotel. Lucky for us, we stayed during the off nights of Coco Bongo so we did not have an issue with club noise. However, we were on the other side of the hotel so we would probably not have heard it anyways. As far as road noise, yes you will hear some, but the rooms are not very far from the road, unlike resort hotels, so its not that unexpected. I did not have an issue with it, maybe thats because Ive lived in much louder places and just blocked it out. Room Size: The rooms are fairly small. However, we found ourselves in the room rarely other than for sleeping and one day of vegging around the room/pool. Ideally, it would be nice to have a larger room, but at the same time, this is a boutique type hotel, not a motel chain or resort. Staff: Very helpful and polite. One of the selling points of this place. El Bistro: Nice place to relax and grab a quick breakfast. Food is not "wow" but it is not expensive and I did not have any issues with it. Location: Its one block off of Avenida 5. So in my opinion you lose some noise from people traffic but gain road traffic, no biggy. As far as the construction, I do not see how you can fault the hotel. Maintenance has to get done and some of the other work is out of their control. Cost: Its a toss up. I really enjoyed my stay there, so I did not have a problem with it. Compared to staying at a resort around the Riviera Maya, yeah it might be a little up there, but you also are staying right off Avenida 5.

<Title>“Why is this hotel rated number one?”
<Content>This is a nice hotel, but it's simply not worth the relatively high price. Noise from Tenth Avenue was an issue in our room, and the noise seeps into the inner pool courtyard because so much of the hotel is open-air. The room was small, the bed was supposedly a queen but seemed more like an American full-size, and the shower had an unattractive plastic curtain. The venetian blinds needed dusting. The clean, attractive pool is unheated, and I never saw anybody in it. What a waste. On the upside, the staff are friendly, helpful, and numerous. The garden is very pretty. And the location is terrific, near midway along Avenida Quinta. The included breakfast was good but not great. I recommend booking a cheaper, quieter hotel without breakfast, then finding a breakfast spot with the dishes you really want.

<Title>“Ab fab!!”
<Content>Absolutly the BEST property in Playa Del Carmen! We have traveled to Playa for years, and have stayed everywhere from the ALL INCLUSIVE resorts to the modest properties along 5th ave. PLEASE trust me when I tell you.... don't hesitate to book this property! The entire staff is extremely helpful with the entire booking process. I was a travel agent for 4+ years, and they handled everything from the transfers to the luggage. Everything they stated, they delivered!!! I will stay @ the La Tortuga next Feb 2010, room # 219 is worth the extra $ BOOK IT!!!!

<Title>“Everything I was expecting and more...”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga February 27-March 3. I picked this hotel based on other Trip Advisor reviews and I was not disappointed. I had originally booked our vacation at a large all-inclusive, but decided that a small, boutique hotel was more our style and changed the reservation. Best decision I could have made! La Tortuga is small, with great service, a friendly staff, and a wonderful ambiance. We really enjoyed the daily happy hour from 5-6 pm (2 for 1 drinks) - many hotel guests come down to the bar to chat, relax, sit by the pool, and share stories. We found the other hotel guests to be very pleasant, down-to-earth, and friendly. Most of the other guests were young (20's) or middle-aged (30's-50's) couples, although I did see 1 family of 3 (with an older daughter) and a pair of best friends in their 20's. It's definitely not a crazy "party" crowd, just really cool people. It looks exactly like the photos on the website. We stayed in a swim-up room, which was great, although we didn't use the pool much. It was VERY cold, but we did take advantage of the hot tub one evening. Another great thing about this hotel is the complimentary breakfast. It's so great to wake up, throw on some clothes, and leisurely walk down to a delicious breakfast by the pool. The staff is friendly and the food is very good. You get 1 free juice, 1 coffee, and 1 entree per person (you have your choice of about 15 entrees ranging from fruit & yogurt to pancakes to eggs benedict to omelets). The location is outstanding. When I first booked the hotel, I was concerned that it wasn't directly on the beach. But after arriving, I didn't care at all! The indoor courtyard is beautiful, and the Mamitas Beach Club is a short 10-minute walk. Plus, the neighbors in the room next to us told us that the public beach in Playa isn't very nice because fisherman use it to bring in their catch, so using the private beach clubs is the way to go anyway. The hotel is 1 block from 5th Avenue - every night we wandered down 5th, looking for a place to eat dinner. I could have stayed in Playa for 3 months, eaten at a different restaurant for every meal, and still not have visited all of them. It's great! To address the music issues expressed by a few others - yes, there is a loud, obnoxious club about 2 blocks away called Coco Bongo. And yes, you can hear the bass at night, but it was faint and wasn't enough to keep us up, or detract from our experience. La Tortuga's location is part of the package - if you want to be close to everything (i.e. 5th Ave), then you get some noise along with it. But it was good noise...the sounds of people out walking around, having fun, enjoying themselves. We didn't find it to be annoying in the least. If I had to complain about something, it would be the shower. It leaks. Big deal. The pool is too cold. So what? One last thing - the hotel restaurant, El Bistro, is excellent. It was the best meal we had on our entire vacation (I'll be writing a separate review for this). If you're looking for an ultra-luxury hotel with all the amenities and room service ona silver platter, this isn't your place. But if you're a chill, low-maitenance person who appreciates good service and a relaxing enviornment, you'll love it. Overall, La Tortuga exceeded my expectations and when we return to Playa (hopefully soon), we will definitely stay at La Tortuga again.

<Title>“Lovely Setting, Not a Relaxing Stay”
<Content>La Tortuga has a lovely setting (pool & landscaping) and provides good service and a central location. However, our overall impression was that we did not receive great value for what we paid, and more importantly did not have an overly relaxing stay while at the hotel due to the noise factor. We stayed in a Standard Plus room on the 10th Ave side which faced onto a busy thoroughfare with non stop traffic noise- too noisy to sit on balcony or open door for fresh air. For two days there was hours of power washing noise from the street, and the last couple of days, the smell of chemicals as plant pots were being painted in the hotel. I had specifically indicated prior to booking that we wanted a quiet place to stay so this was particularly disappointing and would have booked elsewhere if I'd know about the noise. Alot of the noise seems to be out of the hotels control, however disclosure that we would be staying next to a major street would have been appreciated. The front desk was able to move us for two nights to a room facing the pool where we were unfortunately subjected to club noise from approx midnight to 4:30am- walls vibrating - not relaxing at all. Was nice during the day however to sit on the balcony and look out at the pool. As other reviewers have mentioned the rooms are quite small, and while not overly impressive, they have some nice features, and are kept very clean as is the entire hotel. My husband appreciated the great water pressure in shower! The restaurant on site provides good meals at reasonable prices. If your plan is to go to Mamitas (free passes) it's a brisk 15 minute walk, and our experience was you had to be there by 9:00am in order to get chairs/palapas. The hotel pool is more of a "dipping" type of pool, not really for swimming. We had a couple of enjoyable days sitting around the pool when there wasn't noise from repairs being done. Overall, not a bad hotel, room for improvements like anything, need to get the noise situation resolved somehow. Don't think the value was there for what we paid. Would book a condo or a hotel closer to beach in a quieter setting for a future trip.

<Title>“Incredible Service!!”
<Content>The secret to La Tortuga's high ratings on this site is indeed their service. From the check-in staff to the waiters, everyone works to make sure you have an incredible stay. They did not disappoint. Everyone was indeed friendly and all aspects of the hotel seemed to be built around traveler's recommendations. The size was perfect - big enough to have all the amenities you would want, but not so large as to become crowded or overly commercial. The pool was beautiful as were the restaurant and rooms. Perhaps the only real downside were the beds. We stayed in a room where 2 twin beds were pushed together to make a Queen ... not very comfortable sleeping with the seam in the middle.

<Title>“One night was enough”
<Content>I just wanted to experience this place. The place that get's such great ratings. I would say what I liked best was the absolutley wonderful service from the bellboy and staff. I wish I knew his name, but he would bend over backwards for you. He emptied our car and brought lots of luggage to our two rooms and then parked our car a block away in the ramp for us. Then upon check out he retrieved our car and packed up everything in there better than we could have done. I gave him my brand new boogie board that I never even got to use. (and a tip) The breakfast was another highlight. It was very good. Service was a tad slow, as they were short staffed. But it was fine. I was quite disappointed with the room though. I know that I only got a standard room, but it was still $180.00 and I thought it was very dungeon like and worn around the edges. The "patio" was more like a prison cell. Unattractive. I just prefer to be on the beach. Been here/done that. Mosquito Blue gave us a tour and that place is gorgeous. Still not on the beach, but I think it could give La Tortuga a run for it's money.

<Title>“Noisy but nice”
<Content>I spent my honeymoon at La Tortuga 8-22nd Feb 09 and although there were a lot of possitives, there was a major negative. The noise. We booked a Superior Junior Suite and were alocated room 117 which has a rooftop jacuzi. First impressions were good, and we were met with a complementory bottle of bubbly, and a fruit basket. The room was lovely. However, the room was not so lovely when the building work started. The hotel is currently redeveloping an area in the solarium, this is part of the block that includes rooms 116 & 117. The work starts at 8:00am and is so lound that it makes the rooms unusable during the day. We raised a complaint with reception who moved us to an alternative straight away. We were moved to room 218, which is actually a nicer room and was happy with the move, and the way our complaint had been dealt ith however.... Behind the hotel are 2 nightclubs Coco Bongos & the Dubai, and there is nothing to stop the sound between the nightclub and the exterior wall of room 218. It's not just loud, you can actually feel the room vibrating with the beat. After a night of no sleep whatsoever we were moved again (nightclub open until 5:00am!!). When we were moved a second time we were asked to fill in a complaint form as the hotel is having a lot of problems with the noise from the nightclubs (the receptionist showed us a full screen of complaints about the noise to highlight the fact that we were this time getting moved to a room which had not had previous complaints). We were moved to room 119 and although we could still hear the nightclub, we could not feel it, so this was a massive improvement. The Hotel is currently doing everything they can to address the problem, including replacing doors & windows in the affected rooms, however unfortunatly this meant more noise from building work. As most of the reviews on this website reflect, the staff are excelent, and the pool area is lovely. I thought the rooms were good, but not exeptional particulary as the superior suites are the best rooms available. I have sympathy for the hotel, but can only review on what I experianced. We wanted a relaxing holiday, and this was not what we got.

<Title>“Not the best...”
<Content>We paid alot of money to stay in the best rooms this hotel offers as it was our honeymoon and i have to say we were quite dissapointed. I must say on first impressions I was over the moon....we had champagne and fruit on arrival and our room was "dressed" up for our arrival beautifully- the staff were also very welcoming providing us with welcome drinks. The pool area is lovely, not great for swimmers, but great for just lounging and popping in and out of the water. But with the general maintenance work being carried out all around the hotel ( from building walls in the solarium to replacing doors and windows ) it wasn't the most relaxing place to be. However the beach clubs ( Zensi and Mamita's were both nice.) The rooms are nice...not great, certainly not the best I've stayed in. The staff are excellent from the front desk through to the breakfast staff at the Bistro restaurant . What lets the hotel down is the noise from the 2 large nightclubs which are almost next door...if you are in one of the rooms on the far side of the hotel, the noise was very bad. The hotel is doing it's best to try and help ( the above mentioned replacing of doors and windows is just one thing they are trying in order to rid this issue), but the fact still remains.

<Title>“Nice PLace with One Caveat”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at La Tortuga in early February. It is a nice place with great staff. I will list pros and cons below, but I think there is one major issue that people should be aware of. The club next door, Coco Bongo, is very loud until around 5:30 AM almost every morning. I guess some people's ears work differently -- for example, it did not really bother my wife -- but to me it sounded as if someone had a subwoofer leaned against my room door. I actually resorted to NyQuil two nights into our vacation, or I doubt I would have gotten any sleep. Obviously the location of this club is not the fault of the hotel, but the noise is something you have to deal with if staying there. Pros: The pool area is beautiful. A lot of comments about the temp, but I found it refreshing. The restaurant where breakfast is served is nice with good variety. The staff were all friendly and helpful without being overbearing. Location is great for beaches and 5th Ave. Cons: Hotel location's proximity to Coco Bongo. Room size and amenities were slightly above average, not great.

<Title>“Very expensive for what you get!”
<Content>I know Playa Del Carmen is pricey but please! We paid a subsantial amount of money for a junior suite (which only consisted of the one room by the way). Now this room was by far the smallest we stayed in in the whole of mexico incuding the Poc-na youth hostel on Isla Mujeres which cost $30 a night! The selling point apparently was the shallow bath tub up some narrow stairs on the roof of the hotel (this got the sun for 4 hours in the morning only). The hotel is spotlessly clean the grounds lovely & immaculatly kept, the staff professional & polite but I've stayed in the luxury of the Datai for a lot less money. Overall - nice Hotel to stay at but I wouldn't advise splashing out for the extras unless you like bumping into your Mrs 15 times while trying to unpack..

<Content>First of all, I'll list my basic requirements with my comment: Hot Water: Plentiful Water Pressure: The best I've experienced in Playa del Carmen... Toilet Flushing: Perfect...the toilet in our room actually did a kind of "double" flush. Air Conditioning: Worked like a champ Bed: Extremely comfortable Safe: In working condition Towels: Thick and large The hotel property in general was immaculate and the "cool" factor was high. The gardens are lush, there's always a cool Bali style lounge chair to sit on or other couches throughout the property. The spa was really nice...hot and bubbly. We had a swimup room, which I never actually did "swim up" to, but it was still nice to look at and provided easy access to the pool, spa and hotel grounds. The room itself was a bit small for two people, but we managed. The rooms were kept clean and our towels were always formed into some sort of cool sculpture each day. The refrigerator was well stocked and the prices reasonable. The hotel restaurant, Le Bistro, was spectacular. We're from San Francisco, and are quite picky when it comes to food quality and taste. This place was superb. The Cioppino and Pear Salad were my favorites. The hotel breakfast (included) is excellent. Many choices and good quality. We even ate at different areas of the hotel grounds and were served with no question. The hotel is a couple blocks up from the beach, and they have partnered with a couple beach clubs, however our experience at Mamitas was met with huge crowds and poor service, which was expected at this time of year. In all, I have no complaints, other than the price of the room.

<Title>“Very comfortable”
<Content>A really nice hotel. It is comfortable and quiet, but you are very close to 5 avenue where all the action is. The staff of both the hotel and the restaurant are very friendly. The food is good and healthy, very nice after a week of those heavy Mexican meals. The hotel feels really homely and has a nice pool area. But beware, the jacuzzi is very hot.

<Title>“Relaxation!”
<Content>We booked at La Tortuga based on Tripadvisor reviews and certainly weren't disappointed. The hotel itself is just beautiful; pool is gorgeous, hot tub is fantastically hot, gardens are lush and everything is immaculate. Like many others have noted, the rooms are not spacious, however, this minor drawback did not diminish the vacation at all. It seems like if you're looking for a huge room with marble bathroom and such, you're better off booking at one of the all-inclusives. Breakfast was excellent everyday: many choices on the menu, great juices and coffee, and excellent service. All in all, we couldn't have been happier. I really loved swimming in the pool during Happy Hour, however, I seemed to be the only guest doing so, as the water is kind of cold. Also, this is not a rockin'-party-scene hotel, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll probably be disappointed. We spent our first day at Mamitas, which is a nice walk, yet the beach scene wasn't exactly what we had in mind. Lots of people packed in and drinks were kind of expensive. We rented a scooter from the guy across the street from La Tortuga (he's awesome; highly recommend this service) and went to Xpu-Ha beach instead, which is about 20 km down 307 towards Akumal. This beach looks like a travel poster; turquoise water, beach bar with live music if you want it, miles of sand to walk and escape if you want solitude....much better (and cheaper) than going to Mamitas.

<Title>“La Tortuga never dissappoints”
<Content>Just returned from my fourth visit to La Tortuga. I always know I'll be greeted warmly and with a fresh juice at check-in. Room is always clean and staff incredibly hospitable and friendly. Language is never a problem as everyone speaks English. The included breakfast is delicious and the restaurant menu is excellent. The only downer, if you can call it a negative is the amount of closet and storage space.

<Title>“Loved the Hotel and Staff”
<Content>We made the adventure to Playa Del Carmen from Northern California for our daughter's destination wedding in Dec 2008. We had a wonderful stay with great service at La Tortuga. We loved the hotel restaurant, and we were glad that we didn't pick an all inclusive hotel. The entire staff made us feel welcome...a special thanks for Anna, Lisa, Pablo, and Alfredo who extended themselves to our entire group of 16+ friends and family (ages from 30-80) who stayed with us at La Tortuga. We had a small reception for 60 people on the terrace three days before the wedding. Pablo and his staff did an outstanding job with this party. We enjoyed the proximity of this hotel to 5th Avenue and the beach. The setting for this hotel is simply beautiful and we plan on coming back for another stay at La Tortuga in the future.

<Title>“Great value great service”
<Content>My husband and I really enjoyed our one night stay. We were only stopping through town on our way to other parts of the Yucatan. Throughout the process, the communication and the treatment was extremely professional and very friendly. It felt like a personalized service. We liked the fact that the hotel was not too big and that the interior court yard was spectacular with the serpentine pool and the vegetation. The bar serves great mojitos and caipirinas. Breakfast is also great at El Bistro! all in all a great value (we had the standard room). The only downside is that you are not right on the beach... but there is a price to everything!

<Title>“Special gem”
<Content>My husband and I went away without our children for the first time in ages. La Tortuga was perfect-- private, relaxed, amazing location, comfortable and friendly. The restaurant was terrific. We spent a lot of time lounging around the pool & at the solarium. Happy hour in the hot tub was a daily treat. The staff was superb-- friendly, unobtrusive and always helpful. The rooms are very clean but also basic (if you are looking for a luxe Four Seasons experience, this is not for you). This hotel is an excellent value and we would absolutely come back again.

<Title>“We loved our stay!”
<Content>Like many others, we booked this hotel based on the reviews listed here. We were not disappointed. It's a beautiful hotel that is well maintained, clean, and peaceful. We found the service and staff to be first class. They were all so friendly and helpful. It really made it an enjoyable stay for us. Each morning we had breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. You can tell that the quality of the hotel carries over to it as well. For the price, the food, service, and wait staff can't be beat. I regret that we didn't eat more dinners here. It's just that we really wanted to try out as many new places as we could during our short stay. The hotel's location is such that it is only a few blocks from Walmart and the beach, and also just a block off of 5th Ave. Easy walking distance of all the things we wanted to get to. If we plan a trip back to Play Del Carmen, I'm sure we will book our stay at La Tortuga again!

<Title>“Will be coming back!”
<Content>Not sure what I can add that the other 442 reviews before me haven't. We booked based on the reviews here on TripAdvisor, and got a very reasonable room rate ($128 USD/night) during January with a free upgrade upon check-in. The hotel grounds are great, the hot tub is fantastic, Le Bistro restaurant for dinner was a bargain, and the daily breakfast (included) was very convenient with great latte's. The free vouchers to Mamita's beach club were great. Overall, a very good value!

<Title>“Great Stay At La Tortuga”
<Content>I stayed at La Tortuga from Jan. 8 - 16 with my wife and two adult children. The hotel is as good as everybody says it is in their reviews. Because there were 4 adults, we got a room that had beds on 2 levels with a terrace and jacuzzi off the second level. The rooms are extremely well kept, clean, and comfortable. The only drawbacks to the rooms were that they are small and there is not a lot of closet or storage space. All the people who work there couldn't have been more helpful. They arranged transportation to and from the airport for us. Arranged a car rental one day, and were very helpful with restaurant and general information. The breakfast that was included was very good and the waiters were very friendly and helpful. I always left a good tip for breakfast and was bothered by people that I observed leaving nothing or very little. All the service personnel work very hard and depend on tips to make a living. I also left the maid a good tip every day to show my appreciation for the excellent job she did cleaning up after the 4 of us. With the car rental, we drove down to the Tulum ruins and on the way back, we stopped in Akumal and snorkeled at Yal-Ku. We went to Cozumel one day on the ferry and was very disappointed. It is very commercial and the vendors in the shopping areas are very aggressive. We took a cab to San Francisco Beach and it was nothing but a commercialized beach club. Zenzi beach club is short walk from the hotel but the beach is not that nice there. Mamitas beach club is a longer walk but is a much nicer beach. Some days we went to the Playa Maya Hotel and rented beach chairs with nice cushions and umbrellas. The food and service at Playa Maya is excellent. The beach is rocky but if you walk a little to the left, the beach is much nicer. Went to the following restaurants: Yaxche, Babe's, Chicago Don Jose, El Baretto, La Famiglia, El Bistro, and Alux. We enjoy nice restaurants and I did a lot research before we left. These are some of the best in Playa. Some are a little pricey for Playa standards, but if you enjoy good restaurants, these are some of the best. Alux restaurant is in a cave and is a 50 peso cab ride but it is worth seeing. The food isn't as good as the prices they charge but it wasn't bad. If you don't want to spend the money for food, go to the bar area for a drink and walk around the caves.

<Title>“Best hotel we ever stayed at”
<Content>We felt at home at La Tortuga even before we arrived in Mexico. Anna and Jessica informed us about everything we asked for via the internet. When we arrived at the hotel after a total of 24 hours of traveling Lisa gave us a very warm welcome. When we saw our room we couldn’t do anything but stare at it. There was a bottle of Champaign waiting for us, the bed was covered in rose petals, the towels were folded into two swans (the housekeepers folded them differently every day!), we had a rooftop Jacuzzi so we could watch the stars at night and the big LCD TV came in handy after long days of amusement . The next day we came to met Bernardo, the reception worker. The guy is great! He knows everything about Playa del Carmen and the surrounding areas so we constantly harassed him. Luckily he didn’t mind at all and he was always very friendly and helpful. He showed us the best places to go to and explained us how to get there, what to reckon with and what to expect. Lisa, the other reception worker was great as well. She scheduled and rescheduled our excursions and was great fun. The restaurant of La Tortuga (El Bistro) was awesome. They have the best food in the area and for more than acceptable prices. We went to a restaurant in town where I had a piece of salmon with 2 glasses of wine and my wife had a pizza margarita and a bottle of water. We had to pay around 750 pesos (= around 40 euro’s). At El bistro we had more and better wine, way better salmon and the greatest service and hospitality for literally less than half the price. Because it was our honeymoon, one evening we had a private dinner on top of the restaurant. It looked so unbelievably pretty with all the candles and lanterns. Pablo, the restaurant manager, was our waiter and we liked him from the first second on. He is just so nice! We were allowed to pick any bottle of wine (even more than 1, but we’re not that much of drinkers) and anything we wanted of the menu. He gave us a private flambé show and was of the best service I’ve ever experienced. In the morning they had a young team of breakfast waiters (Santiago, Daniel and one more who’s name I forgot (sorry!)) and they were so much fun! They did everything to make their guests feel at home. The last morning, just before we had to go home, they did some tricks with cutlery and one of them made a grasshopper out of a piece of reed as a farewell gift. The barkeepers were Daniel and Fidel. They really made the best Mohito’s in town. Not only better than in the Netherlands, but also better than all the bars I’ve tasted them in Mexico. And they were cheap! The Margarita’s we’re great as well. There was one particular Margarita (La Tortuga… ) that was more expensive than the rest but so good! It had Gran Marnier and Tequila in it and I’m planning on begging for the recipe. The housekeepers did an outstanding job. We heard lots of British, American and Dutch people complaining about the cleanliness in their all-inclusive resorts, but our room was as clean as it can be every single day. My wife is allergic to dust so that was great! A very nice extra were the figurines the housekeepers made every morning of the clean towels. And special thanks goes to Alfonzo who assisted at the reception and supervised the pool- and garden area! This is becoming kind of a large piece of text. Last thing: we’ll definitely go back to La Tortuga as soon as we can!!!

<Title>“High recommendatoin from the Irish !”
<Content>Over my years living in and holidaying in Mexico (I'm living in Ireland now), I have to say this is the first time that a hotel has really exceeded my expectations in all areas of service. Right from the start (at checkin time), we were treated well by the staff, and the surroundings and environment of the hotel were really perfect whether we decided to stay on our own, or to meet new people. The Jacuzzi in the centre of the pool area was really fun, and the restaurant (where we had breakfast most mornings and dinner on 3 evenings) was really great. Couldn't thank the staf f enough really (all with perfect English), but I have to say my medal either goes to Lisa on reception, or the lady (I don't know her name) responsible for the "towel origami" each day on our bed - complete with flower petals. We'll be back.

<Content>This hotel was fantastic. The staff is so friendly and the pool area is gorgeous. We almost never left the hotel because it was so beautiful. Prices at the hotel bar and the attached restaurant were extremely reasonable (esp. compared to the downtown area) and the restaurant food was so good. We loved our time here. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to have a great time in Playa.

<Title>“Believe the reviews”
<Content>Just got back from New Years there. Everything in the reviews were spot on. There is a reason this is rated number one. We received complimentary drinks on our arrival, beds were super comfy, drinks at the bar were the best in playa (they seem to be the only ones who used real fruit and juices). I won't go on as everyone here already did but just affirming what has already been said.

<Title>“Wonderful!!”
<Content>We have just returned from celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary at La Tortuga and agree with all the reviews on this wonderful hotel. The included breakfast is very good and drinks at the bar are delicious, my husband loved the margaritas and the mojitos were by far the best I have ever tasted! Although I didn't find our room to be anything special it was clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and we never ran short of hot water. We stayed in a junior suite with jacuzzi and at around $320 a night (due to the holidays) thought it to be a bit overpriced. The hotel grounds are well maintained, very relaxing and were always quiet. The location of La Tortuga is perfect for 5th Avenue and the beaches without having to put up with the noise. We found all the staff to be extremely friendly and definitely plan to return at a time when the room rates are less expensive.

<Title>“Engaged at La Tortuga”
<Content>My new fiancee and I spent our Xmas at La Tortuga where I proposed to her. We booked the Junior Suite with rooftop jacuzzi. For the booking the only odd thing I encountered was having to wire over the full amount 1 month in advance. This is a policy the hotel has in place for any stays that include the days between Xmas and New Years. The wiring wasn't a problem and Jessica, who I emailed with constantly, was very helpful. I mention it here in case anyone is wary of wiring money (which I am). There were no problems at all. The staff was also very readily available preparing for the trip. As I mentioned, I emailed with them constantly. I wanted to prepare the perfect evening for my proposal and they were very accomodating. They decorated our rooms with rose petals, created towel swans, and provided a bottle of champagne (just like in their pictures). It was beautiful. The hotel itself is every bit as gorgeous as the pictures. They are situated in a very nice section of Playa. Nothing felt too far away and was within walking distance. Also, we weren't so close to the busy nightlife where it was terribly loud. The windows and walls are well insulated and it's very quiet. Thier restaurant next door (Le Bistro) is quite nice. We ate there for dinner one night which was very good. The best part is breakfast is included at this restaurant every morning. I think the hotel reception deserves special mention. Lisa was absolutely wonderful, greeting us with her beeming smile and great conversation. It was nice knowing that every night we came back to the hotel we would be greeted so warmly. We spent many evenings talking about random things and her family back at home. Overall, I would highly recommend La Tortuga. The staff is very professional and will do their best to attend to your needs. Given this hotel as an option, I don't see why anyone would ever want to do an all-inclusive - unless you have kids younger than 16.

<Title>“Can't wait until next year”
<Content>This was our second stay at La Tortuga, and can't wait until our next! The place is beautiful and exceptionally well maintained. What makes it truly special however, is the hotel staff. Our first morning there, Santiago (breakfast waiter) greeted me by name. (It's been a year since our last visit). Daniel the bartender, always called us by name and was so pleasant as was the other bartender. Everyone from the ladies and gentleman in the reception area to the waiters went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. One of the breakfast waiters (his name may be Hector) actually hugged both my husband and me on our last morning. We had the included breakfast each day at El Bistro as well as two dinners. The food was quite good. The hotel is in the best location with easy access to 5th Avenue and all the restaurants, shops and bars it has to offer. Strolling down 5th Ave in the evening is something I will never tire of. We went to the Mamitas beach club a few days and relaxed under a palapa, jumping into the ocean every now and again. We also walked down to the ocean by the Zenzi beach club, and walked along the beach toward the ferry. We discovered little restaurants along the way, stopping occasionally for a beer on the beach with our toes in the sand. Both years we have booked room 219, which is a jucuzzi suite on the second floor. The jacuzzi is in the room and the room has two entrances and a large porch under a palapa. I am very particular about the bed comfort, and this bed was comfy! We bought a bottle of wine at the Mega Mart, and each evening sat in our pajamas on the porch drinking a glass of wine taking in the beauty of the hotel. At night, the palms all have rope lighting and tiki torches are lit. Happy hour at the hotel was great with some of the best mojitos ever. (take your bug spray- got that at Mega Mart also.) The drinks were really good, and at 2 for 1, what's not to love! Babe's Noodles, Caboncitas, Cueva del Chango, Las Ruinas, Los Aluxes, HC Monterey, and El Bistro were our favorite restaurants. Unlike others, we did care for El Fagon. We have traveled to various parts of Mexico over 20 times, and Hotel La Tortuga and Playa del Carmen are by far our favorite vacation spot and hotel.

<Title>“Love, Love, Love ,This Gorgeous Hotel!”
<Content>If you are like me researching were to stay in Playa Del Carmen... let me say that you need not to search anymore. This little gem of a hotel has everything you need and a whole lot more. Forget the big all inclusive resorts... where you are just a number attached to a credit card. Wouldn't it be nicer to stay at a place where you felt like part of the family ? I can not say enough about the friendly staff and the lovley accommodation at La Tortuga Hotel. Everyone and I mean every member of the staff that we encountered were so warm and welcoming we just loved this place and highly recommend staying here. The locaction is perfect walking distance to everything, shopping, night life, and great places to eat. The best Restaurant however for both price and quality food and service was by far was El Bistro (the restaurant at La Tortuga) the food was fabulous!! again I can not put into words how much we enjoyed our stay at La Tortuga. This was definately one of the best holiday experiences we have had and will be booking again in the future. I work as an international Travel agent in Australia so I can speak from years of travel experience that you have found the perfect place to stay in Playa Del Carmen so don't delay get your booking in this is a smaller Hotel so you would hate to miss out!! We stayed in a Jr suite with roof too jacuzzi.... again we loved it!!

<Title>“Great Hotel in a Perfect Location”
<Content>We were recently lucky to have spent three nights at La Tortuga. It was, of course, way too short. We had arranged for the hotel to provide our transportation from the airport and were very pleased. The driver was waiting for us and off we went. Having landed at 10:30, we were in our room before noon. Check in was quick and easy. Front desk staff were always friendly and I never had to open a door. Our room was the standard room, and have to say, it was quite standard. I would have liked to have seen some of the other rooms, but in the end, we were happy with our cozy set up. We had a small balcony overlooking the gorgeous pool area as well. Our room included a frig with bottled water and sodas for an additional charge, but the prices were very reasonable. You were also allowed a one time coffee use. Room amenities, like shampoo, were also quite decent. We never went without hot water for our shower. Vanity space was very limited ladies, but it is a basic room, afterall. Beds were firm and comfortable, not hard as a board and awkward. Breakfast is included, and it is off the menu, not just donuts and coffee. We aren't breakfast or morning people, but found ourselves taking advantage of this because it was offered up until 12 noon! We also enjoyed dinner one night at the Bistro to take advantage of our 50% discount. Even without the discount, the prices were a steal! We loved the atmosphere of the grounds. The pool area was very nice and found it relaxing to sit in the afternoon. Don't expect much sun, however they have an area a floor up with a few comfy beds and all the sun you need! The water in the pools was dramatically cold. We spent nearly 45 min inching our way in one day to finally make the plunge. We lasted about a minute before having to get out. They do have, however, the hottest hot tub in town. What a difference from the pool. One afternoon we decided to take advantage of Mamitas beach club. Included are two chairs and an umbrella. It is about 10 blocks away, which really isn't a bad walk. It's kind of a busy beach, and when we arrived at about 11am, we had no problems getting chairs, but the umbrellas were already taken. This would be a short stay as we can only take the direct sun for so long. Let me say that the beach and water were possibly the nicest we have seen in a long time. Unbelievably gorgeous water! After about an hour, one of the waiters let us know an umbrella had opened up. Very nice of him, as there were plenty of people that probably would have liked the umbrella! We then were able to relax a bit and enjoy a few beverages and some nachos. Great food and very reasonable. The walk back was a bit longer as we were hot from sitting out. Oh well, we certainly survived. Ah, to be that hot again as it is barely zero degrees here today at home. The small pool bar is cozy and friendly (just like the whole hotel itself.) We enjoyed a few very well made drinks one night, checked our email on the computer supplied at the bar, and were only a few steps from our room. That's what we love about these small boutique hotels-everything is right where you need it! Possibly one of the best features (for us) was the location. Just off of 5th, you felt like you were definately out of the action enough and yet close enough to be there in seconds. Plus, you were smack dab in the middle of 5th, which was really nice. We couldn't have asked for a better location. All in all, we highly recommend La Tortuga. If your room is important to you, I do suggest that you consider booking one of the "better" rooms. We just felt for the money, that was not necessary to us.

<Title>“Why stay at an all inclusive resort?”
<Content>We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Tortuga in Playa Carmen. The hotel is small and once inside offers a degree of tranquility. (With an exception noted below). Located one block away from the main shopping street (5th Avenue), it is easy walking distance to beaches and all the activity. Unlike most of the large all inclusive resorts sprouting up like weeds on Riveria Maya, the hotel has charm and individuality. (Also its less expensive if you do the math. We averaged about $130/day per person. You can also choose from 200 restaurants instead just a few) My only negative comments would be that the pool is not heated and was not just cold but frigid (Hace Frio). At night it gets to about 65 degrees and the pool is in the shade all day so it never warms up. You really can't stay in for too long. Also, the hotel almost resembles and amphitheater, with sound carrying easily. We had a wedding party that was staying in the hotel, and they decided to party from 3AM to 5AM so sleep was out of the question (even with the balcony doors closed). I also wish the hotel had a on-line booking system to make reservations easier. Some pointers. The hotel offer passes to two beaches, we preferred the one in town (Zensi) on 10th Ave. You can use the beach pass they give you for mamitas (This beach club was really crowded even in off season). It is not free, but they wave the fee if you spend $20 or more (quite easy to do buying drinks from the wait staff). We Carboncitas as recommended here. It was the best food of the trip. Most Playa restaurants while inexpensive were only average or below. The restaurant itself is quite unimpressive, however. You will be tempted to walk away. We used the car service from the hotel. It was a good deal for $98 (plus tip). On time and helpful. We expressed interest in seeing Porto Morales, and the driver offered to take us on the way to airport for no extra fee (although we gave him a bigger tip). You want to arrange transport ahead of time in Cancun its quite chaotic to wait until you arrive. Use the Bank ATMs to get Pesos. Don't exchange money there. You always get a much better rate. We got 13.8 from ATM versus 12.5 in town. Don't pay for items in stores with dollars, the exchange rate they will give you will be horrible. They will assume you cant so the math. Many tried to give us a rate of 10 pesos/dollar. We had a superior room which was quite adequate. I can't see spending the extra dollars for the bigger rooms because on average you will only spend a few daylight hours inside. The difference will pay for all your daily meals. If you like good wine, bring it from home. The wine is overpriced and usually quite poor. A bottle that costs $8 in U.S. will be $20 in Mexico.

<Title>“Perfect for our wedding & honeymoon”
<Content>We hosted our wedding at La Tortuga on November 16th and stayed there from November 13-24th. We had about 60 guests for two days of celebration on the terrace and at their restaurant El Bistro. Many of our guests stayed for up to one week at the hotel. The location and size of the hotel is perfect to host a small group. People could be at the pool, lounge area or bar and meet up with others easily. The hotel is walking distance to everything you need - shops, bars, restaurants, etc. Anna was wonderful to work over e-mail for months of planning and Lisa was at the desk each night to offer ideas for the next day and dinner recommendations. The food in El Bistro is terrific, the small bar has happy hour each evening and all the staff is so helpful and friendly. We stayed in two different suites - one was a regular junior suite and one was the deluxe junior suite. Both had great pool views and comfy beds. Many of the rooms have been renovated. The only negatives I can think of are that the rooms still have bed spreads - they are not horrible looking but I travel quite a bit and think that all bedspreads should go away and be replaced with down comforters and washable duvet covers. Also, it is not a loud place at all but you can definitely hear everything going on outside and in adjacent rooms when you are in your room. Both beach clubs (Zenzi & Mamitas) are nice and we always found space no matter what time we arrived. We recommend Tacochido and Dr. Taco on 10th to grab a cheap lunch or dinner!

<Title>“The best place to stay in Playa Del Carmen”
<Content>My husband and I wanted a more personalized, in-town experience for our second honeymoon trip to Playa Del Carmen, a change of pace from the usual all-inclusive route. We chose La Tortuga based on the reviews on Trip Adviser. We stayed in room 302 from Nov. 24-28, 2008. Here are the details: The Room: Exceptionally clean and comfortable. Although it is true the rooms are small, our room provided everything we needed. It was well equipped with LCD TV, comfortable bed, safe, two closets, double sinks, etc. It felt like home to us and was easy to enjoy. I loved reading on the patio outside, opening the windows and letting the sounds of the city reach us. The Grounds: Pristine. The pool area snakes through the grounds. The pool was chilly but so was the ocean. We didn't swim much, but enjoyed relaxing by the pool and catching some sun. The Service: The staff goes above and beyond to accommodate guests. A special thank you and shout out to the bartenders, Daniel and Fidel. Both were fantastic at their jobs and the bar became our favorite spot for taking coffee/chiladas/tequilas and meeting other folks, practicing our Spanish, and learning about Playa. Also, thank you to Lisa for working so hard to find an out of the way restaurant and checking up on us before and after our stay. The restaurant: Delicious. We ate dinner their once and breakfast everyday. Try the Montulenos- a traditional Mayan dish. Coffee is strong, hot and delicious. Staff is courteous and aims to please. We both left on Friday feeling more rested, relaxed and happy than we had in a long time. La Tortuga was a great choice for us and we'll return as soon as we can. If you're looking for a romantic getaway or a quiet, relaxing, easy stay, I recommend this hotel without question.

<Title>“perfect relaxation”
<Content>after a roundtrip throughout Mexico, we were pleasantly suprised by this lovely, relaxing hotel in the middle of the very busy Playa del Carmen. It was a oasis round the corner of lively beaches and nightlife. The restaurant of the hotel was one of the best, not to say the best, place to eat in this area. The discount offered by the hotel to their guests was a surplus. Surely a hotel to be recommended to all travellers searching for a nice, reliable and quite "home" in the middle of a lively neighbourhood.

<Title>“As Advertised”
<Content>We recently returned from our honeymoon in Mexico where we spent the first 3 nights at La Tortuga Hotel and the remaining 5 nights at one of the larger all inclusive resorts between Playa Del Carmen and Cancun. Prior to making our hotel selections, I reviewed heavily the reviews and feedback shared by other travelers on this and other websites. I'm happy to say that our experience at La Tortuga was as good as we had hoped for based on past reviews. The general atmosphere at La Tortuga is very laid back and relaxing. The rooms are very nice and unique, certainly based on the price point, and the pool area is absolutely beautiful! The only thing we didn't enjoy about the pool was that the water was absolutely freezing, especially given the pool area is mostly shaded. If this pool were heated, I would guess the guests would never leave as the landscaping and scenery is so relaxing. We did take advantage frequently of the hot tub however which was very enjoyable. The restaurant, particularly breakfast, was also excellent and the waiters are a lot of fun to get to know. During our stay, a larger wedding party was using the hotel for their wedding and we got the impression the hotel staff was at times a little overwhelmed, or potentially understaffed for handling both the wedding and serving the other guests. The bar area is a lot of fun but the bar was very often unstaffed, particularly during happy hour which we found somewhat disappointing. During our stay we visited the beach club each day that is recommended, and comped, by the hotel. We liked the club very much and enjoyed the short walk through town each day to get there. This is a very different type of experience than staying beachfront at some big resort but we would highly recommend this alternative for both variety and a more unique experience. While it's always nice to be beachfront, we very much enjoyed the change of pace that came with being a part of the "in-town" experience of Playa Del Carmen. All in all, we considered our experience at La Tortuga to be a great value and a unique alternative compared to the all-inclusive we stayed at during the second part of our honeymoon.

<Title>“Great service!”
<Content>Stayed at La Tortuga Hotel for my honeymoon and it was perfect! The service is excellent. Very quick to respond to your requests. The breakfast (included) is very good - not buffet style. You have several options to pick from. The swimming pool is very cold but in the middle of the pool area there is a hot tub. Location is great - a block from all the restaurants, shops, etc. but far enough that you are away from all of the town's noise. And short walk to the beach. Overall, I would highly recommend that you stay there!

<Title>“Decent, but not great”
<Content>We stayed in the Junior suite, it was a nice stay, the staff are very friendly, the room was nice, although we did have to kill a few mozzies at night! The pool is surrounded by trees, which is apparant on the website, so can't blame that on being a surprise, but it does make the poolside quite chilly, and un appealing. So with no pool, a beach a few blocks away, that takes away from the overall mark. Other than that, it was a pleasant stay. I was happy. I would give it 7/10, but in the absence of a 3 and a 1/2 star, I will give is 3, 4 is just a bit too strong

<Title>“An in-city Oasis!”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga with about 6 other couples as part of my daughter's wedding party. The staff was extremely friendly and accomodating, the rooms were terrific and the grounds....a tranquil paradise isolated from the "outside world". Quiet, romantic, ideal for couples wanting to be close to 5th Ave but not in it. This is the place to stay in downtown Playa!

<Title>“Excellent Service”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga for a friend's wedding. The service was excellent, and the rooms were serviceable. We stayed in superior king suite, and the room was spacious, but some of our friends that stayed in regular rooms complained about their room size. The hotel restaurant (El Bistro) offers a good breakfast that is included in the room rate. However, the dinner we had there was mediocre (I suspect this has to do with the extremely westernized dinner menu; we had Mexican breakfasts each day that were quite good).

<Content>My boyfriend and I were there for 5 nights, 6 days and we had such a relaxing time at the hotel. The staff was super nice and friendly with us and always ready to help and please. That meant alot to us! The hotel is not on the beach, but is in close proximity to the beach, nightlife, pharmacies, shops and restaurants. Perfect location! The hotel also has a kick (---) restaurant and bar. They also have a spa, which unfortunatly we didn't get to go to. So, all in all, it is a quaint, pleasant and relaxing retreat.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>We stayed at La Torguta for almost a week at the end of October and had a great time, the hotel is very nice and the people there are also super friendly. Breakfast was always good and the bartenders and great and it's cool that they have a computer/internet at the bar for guest to use and the hot tub under the trees is dreamy after a long day at the beach. We went to Mamitas the first day and really enjoyed it and the walk was not bad at all as you can walk down Fifth Ave and enjoy the walk, on the second day we went to Cozumel and once there we ask for info on renting a car and the person at the info booth was actually connected to a time share deal, he was nice so we didn't mind too much and he got us a discount on a rental their at Cozumel and also a GREAT deal on tickets to Xcaret (2 tickets for $20 USD)which I was not planning on visiting since I thought it was too expensive but I am glad I did it was a great experience and the show at the end of the day is a MUST! (we went to the time share meeting early the next morning, 90 minutes, it was raining pretty hard so it was not too bad even though they were not happy we didn't buy)We also went to Tulum one day and it's beautiful and the beaches around there are incredible, on our last day we went to the other beach the hotel offers tickets to which is Zensi and it was nice but we liked Mamitas a lot better even if it's not as close to the hotel. The Walmart is not far if you need to buy anything and for dinner there is a place called El Fogon that is yummy and way cheap.

<Content>I just got home from a very relaxing stay at La Tortuga with a large wedding party! The location is fantastic, the staff is incredibly friendly, and the rooms are great. I also can't say enough about the food. It was very, very good and again, the wait staff was super. The moment you want into the hotel you are blown away by the ambience-- the website just doesn't do justice to the beautiful pools inside. Thanks to everyone there for making your spot so welcoming.

<Title>“Fabulous La Tortuga!”
<Content>We just returned from a week's stay at La Tortuga, Oct 23-30, and we had the most wonderful time! Anna handled all our reservation requests promptly even when we were booking 10 months in advance, and she then handled all the expected changes to our flight times and arranging our airport transfers with ease. It was great to have everything in such capable hands! We arrived very early in the morning on the 23/24th and even though our flight was early, our driver from Zuley was right there waiting for us. When we got to the hotel we were shown directly up to our room (312) which was wonderful! Lovely king size bed with a balcony and jacuzzi on the rooftop, and the bed was so lusciously soft! Unfortunately we did hear some noise from whatever nightclub is around... My husband hears everything and even with the aircon on in the evening he was very conscious of the distant thumping noise... I heard it but could easily ignore it and it didn't bother me at all. The desk staff were fabulous, Lisa and Bernie in particular - they helped us with so many questions about Playa and excursions. We did the Mayan Encounter through Altournative, and when the winds were so high the harbour was closed so we couldn't dive, Bernie quickly got us booked on a tour to Chichen Itza. Both tours were very good! They also helped us find this fabulous candle shop we heard of through the PDC forum - Artevelas - I love looking at those gorgeous candles now that we are home and remembering PDC... The location of the hotel is also fabulous - so close to all the action and the beaches! I know being close to the nightlife contributed to the nightclub noise that bugged DH, but I thought it was well worth it to be that close to everything. Definately go to Ah Cacao for a treat or two - it is so close, and the brownies are to die for! And our favorite restaurant, Carboncitos, is nice and close - we ate lunch there as many times as we could! We also tried La Pesca (not impressed), Yache (ok), and Babe's (ok overall- but great margaritas!), and La Cueva del Chango (50/50 on this one) - all within walking distance from the hotel! The beaches were beautiful! We walked to Zenzi but preferred the wider, more popular beach at Mamitas and went there three days of our week - gorgeous! Even when the winds were high and the red flags up elsewhere on the beach, at Mamitas you could still swim and the lifeguards were out in full force so you always felt that someone was around if needed. Walking along the beach, though, back to the hotel the beach erosion in front of some of the big resort hotels is quite evident, so I was really glad we had the option of Mamitas to enjoy! We also would like to say a big thank you to our waiters at El Bistro - Jose in the morning and Marco at night. - the staff everywhere at the hotel were terrific and really made the trip! The breakfasts were fabulous (I haven't had that much fresh OJ for years, and my husband is still missing the chilaquiles... I loved the sincronizadas!), and the suppers were excellent and so reasonable with the 50% discount on three meals. We highly recomend the filet mignon and the beef filet with porcini mushroom sauce! We would definately return to Playa in a heartbeat, and I would only think of booking back with La Tortuga - just perhaps in another junior suite on the other side of the building that was a bit more sheltered from the noise?... Loved it, loved it, loved it! Definately give this hotel a try - you will not regret it!

<Title>“Overpriced!!!”
<Content>This is for me the number 1 !!! Yes is the first hotel where I paid for a late check out of 90'. Hotel in a good central position but far from the shore and with a little and nice internal lake that for me cannot be sold as a pool. Very kind and smiling staff and good meal. But the junior suite that we paid US$ 217 (special offer during raining season), was nothing more than a standard room with some problem with the lights. I won't go there anymore.

<Title>“The best kept secret in the Mayan Riviera”
<Content>My husband and I plus my in laws just came back from this wonderful hotel and I don’t have enough words to describe what a great place this was. From the beginning Lisa greeted us and answered every question we had with great sense of humor and friendliness. The location of this hotel is excellent too; it’s in a corner where the traffic is not so laud and only one block from fifth Avenue and two blocks to the ocean. You can’t hear any of the music from the bars or the traffic in the street. The room was absolutely spotless, the bathroom was clean, every day we had some one clean our room in a timely manner and I left us the cutest towel animals. The grounds were cleaned every day. The pool is inside and the rooms surround it which gives it a lot of privacy. The grounds were like a little forest with pools and trees; everything was always in its place. I have children but I was glad to stay in an all adult resort as it made the experience even more relaxing for us. We had breakfast included every morning at the Bistro at La Tortuga. The food was great but what made this place so much better was the wonderful staff. Everyone is so happy and treated us like royalty without expecting anything in return. We also had dinner at the bistro most nights and the food was amazing. The desserts are made right in front of you, everyone really enjoyed the flambé fruits. I know I will be returning and I am glad I don’t have to worry about finding a place to stay because I will be staying at La Tortuga from now on. Thank you to Lisa, Alfredo, Mario and their staff. We can’t wait to return. Tania and Patrick

You get 50% off dining at their restaurant and it makes it really cheap to eat there. It's raining a lot in October but it makes it worth while even if you just stay at the hotel.

The front desk staff was warm and welcoming and very efficient for all of our requests.The pool, our room, and the restaurant were all very clean and inviting. Speaking of the restaurant, I dream of sincronizadas for breakfast. Absolutely DELICIOUS breakfasts and great service. All of our waiters came up to us as we were leaving with our bags to say goodbye, shake hands, and thank us. We cannot wait to go back!

<Title>“Cozy, friendly, casual luxury”
<Content>My husband and I spent a week at La Tortuga during our honeymoon on the Yucatan Peninsula. It was by far the best part of our trip. After driving from the Cancun airport, finding and entering this quaint, cozy boutique hotel was such a sight for weary travelers! Everyone at the hotel is friendly and professional - beginning with Lisa at the front desk. Actually, beginning with Anna who I emailed with and who booked the trip. She was great too, although we never met her in person! We also loved Alfredo- he's the best! We were greeted with a rose petal-sprinkled bedspread and a bottle of chilled champagne when we arrived. We had two different rooms during our stay; a third floor Junior Suite with rooftop jacuzzi and a swim-up room also with rooftop jacuzzi. The swim up room was bigger and had a nicer bathroom, but we actually really liked the smaller third floor room. It was room 306, we think, and it had the BEST little patio outside the room with a view of the pool where we could just relax and have a beer and enjoy the tropical weather. We never had trouble with bugs and the a/c worked great. The pool is beautiful and refreshing, and the restaurant is FANTASTIC. With the coupons they give you, it's a steal too. The wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. And that you get free breakfast there every morning is so nice and relaxing. The hotel gives you beach towels and passes to either Mamitas or Zensi. We walked to both beach clubs and enjoyed both, although we liked Mamitas best. We actually liked that it was a bit more crowded and the servers were more accessible, and you don't have to order anything. And there were no water sports to speak of there, whereas there were some boats and jet skis nearby Zensi. (And you are supposed to spend $10) We walked to Fifth Avenue often in the evenings and found a couple of laid back bars. Some of the restaurants are a bit too touristy and expensive but you should try Babe's Noodle bar - delish and inexpensive. We also went off of Fifth to some local places and had good luck. Each day we had clean towels, new toiletries and a clean room. After some rain there was a sewer back up and our bathroom had a smell for a few days but the hotel was accommodating and brought up some air fresheners twice. It's Mexico, you gotta deal with it and the hotel is very professional. I think some reviews talked about how the tub on the roof takes too long to fill. Really, it's completely not a big deal. So have a beer and wait for it to fill up - what else do you have to do? My husband and I had such a nice, relaxing time here at La Tortuga. From eating yummy food at Le Bistro, to lounging at the pool or having 2 for 1 drinks at the bar, or playing cards on our patio, we really could have never left the hotel and would have had a great time. We threw in some day trips and some walks around the vicinity of Playa and it was just a perfect trip. I highly recommend Playa Del Carmen and I would say you HAVE to stay at La Tortuga when you go.

<Title>“Great Place for Couples”
<Content>This was our honeymoon trip, so I wanted things to be great and was doing quite a bit of research before traveling. We had a timeshare at a big resort for a week, so we only needed 3 more nights of hotel. I had read reviews on trip advisor and other sites prior to booking. We had checked out of our timeshare and were checking into the hotel right around noon (check in time). This was the first time we met Bernardo at the front desk. Check in was simple and efficient. Then we were informed that our room wasn't quite ready yet. Uh-Oh... the panic sets in right? Actually, it turned out alright. They gave us hotel towels and a voucher for the beach club mamita's. We went and got our swim suits, changed at the hotel, and went to the beach club for a few hours. The beach club is worth a visit. We came back and Lisa was there at the front desk, and Bernardo was apparently done for the day. But there was no problem - I said our room wasn't ready earlier, is it ready now. She knew who we were, gave us fresh towels and we went up to our room. The fellow at the door sees my wife struggling with her bag and just grabs it and hikes it up the stairs to our room. Before I could get out a tip, he had already left. They had rose petals and a towel-swan-heart thing setup on the bed, and a bottle of champagne chilling in a bucket with two glasses. That's a great way to start your honeymoon stay! Each day was a new towel sculpture on the bed. They were all great. The breakfast is included, and its excellent food. Not just a bagel and fruit - its anything on their menu. Beware the habenero pepper vinegar stuff. It is incredibly hot. We also ate dinner at their bistro restaurant one night which was also excellent (and the price is right). I had grouper with a lobster sauce and she had a beef filet. The pool is great fun, and don't miss the bar happy hour. Its only for an hour, but who doesn't need 2x1 shots of good tequilla? Thanks to Bernardo, Lisa and the rest of the staff for making our stay excellent. Staying here beat the big resort timeshare!

<Title>“Lovely Tortuga”
<Content>Ola, We just came back of the lovely hotel La Tortuga and we anjoyed it very much. It was really relaxing after a week travelling around Yucatan. The atmosphere was nice, the service was good and it was real cosy. You must try the restaurant, it was really very good compering some restaurants on the 5th avenue. The location is very near the 5th, just a few seconds walking. The beach club is about 10 min. walking and well provided with beds and umbrellas and a good service. We loved our stay in La Tortuga and hopefully we will return some day. Ron, Ineke, Rob and Silvia Amsterdam, the Netherlands

<Title>“Loved La Tortuga”
<Content>Beautiful small hotel in a great location. Staff is very attentive and friendly. The pool is very pretty. It was my second time in this hotel. I would definitely advise staying in a Junior Suite or Superior Junior Suite. The Standard Plus left something to be desired and didn't match up with the beauty of the rest of the hotel. They have a few gorgeous Suites with hot tubs and even one with a private pool in it's own gated courtyard...Very Romantic!

<Title>“Place to be in Playa Del Carmen!”
<Content>We had a great time in Playa Del Carmen and a lot of it had to do with La Tortuga Hotel. We are quite picky when it comes to hotels and restaurants - La Tortuga surpassed our expectations. First, in terms of location - it's in a great place to experience both the beaches and the village/shops and restaurants. It's a 5-10 minute walk to the beach and one block away from 5th Avenue, where most of the shops/restaurants are. Second, ambiance - the hotel is relaxing - the pool flows throughout the grounds and the open air bar/restaurant is a great place for any meal. There are a lot of places to go and relax - by the pool, in the open air lounge, the solarium (one thing to note is that the pool area is not really a place to get sun - it is a lush area with trees and pockets of sunshine - anyone wishing to tan would prefer to use the sun deck or go to the beach). In terms of amenities, you get a lot for your money here (please note that we stayed here in the low season, so it was even more of a value than during high season) - free admission to two beach clubs located nearby - this was great because it meant we were able to sit on comfortable lounge chairs at the beach! - free breakfast every day - the best part is that they serve breakfast from 7AM until NOON! No rushing to wake up and get down to breakfast! The breakfast is great as well - eggs, pancakes, etc... - 1/2 price off of three meals at The Bistro - La Tortuga's restaurant. We only took advantage of this once for lunch because we were out and about a lot, but this is a great value. - the staff is wonderful - they genuinely care and the service is exceptional. - the rooms were great - we were in a third floor room and slept on a comfortable bed. It was quiet and clean. Maid service was exceptional - every evening when we returned to the room, the bath towels were arranged in a sculpture on our bed! Pretty creative! All in all, when we return to Playa Del Carmen, we will definitely want to stay at La Tortuga again. One other thing to note is that this is not the kind of place for families with young children - it's more suited for singles, couples and families with older children.

<Title>“A little gem!”
<Content>I had only 5 days to recharge the batteries and thought what better place than Playa Del Carmen. Thanks to fellow travellers, I found La Tortuga and what a little gem it turned out to bet. From the welcome drink on arrival where the front office staff explain everything to you and offer advice on excursions, places to eat and of course, the on-premises Spa. For the first three days, I had a swim-up room which was wonderful - slip off your patio directly into the pool! My last two days were in a Suite (Room 118), which was stunning - if you can get this room, grab it! The rooms were comfortable and clean with good amenities. A nice surprise every evening was arriving home (and yes, it felt like home) and finding your towels folded into cute animal shapes. I used the Spa four times and it was excellent - the massages completely relaxed me. Best kept secret is their restaurant El Bistro, which is the best value for money in Playa! I found all the staff friendly and helpful and cannot wait to return!

<Title>“Kiwis had an awesome honeymoon!”
<Content>Tortuga is just great, from the time we arrived and were greeted with a friendly face and a welcome drink to the time we left we had an amazing holiday. Our junior suite was lovely and we arrived in our room to find a bottle of champagne and our bed laiden with a rose petal love heart and a lovely message thanking us for choosing Tortuga for our special occasion. Our balcony looked over the pool area which is another great feature of the hotel and our rooftop Jacuzzi was pretty cool to say the least! The bed was huge and I found it really comfy. Every day when you return you will find that room service had created another piece of art on your bed using your clean towels, it was quite neat to see what they would do next and they always did a great job of cleaning the room etc. Back to the pool, its a cosy layout right beside the bar and surrounded by lovely trees and landscaping, check out the rooftop sun area where you can lay on double cushioned loungers under umbrellas and order drinks and food delivered to your lounger table! We had a late lunch up there whilst basking in the sunshine! El Bistro the restaurant is fantastic, the food is delicious and the prices so reasonable it was tempting to eat there for every meal! The inclusive breakfast is from El Bistro where you get to order something from their yummy breaky menu and it never failed to disappoint! If you love mexican food the Mayan breakfast is to die for! The staff at El Bistro were fantastic too! So yes, Tortuga was truly a neat place to spend time in Playa and so close to 5th ave only a 30 second walk away if that! We also checked out Mamitas beachclub which you can lounge at free witha Tortuga pass and that was really lovely too... If you want somewhere with authentic Mexican charm and with the personal touch this is the place for you! Thanks for such a great honeymoon we are hoping to return for our 10year anniversary!

<Title>“Great Hotel Experience!”
<Content>La Tortuga was everything we expected and more. This was our first experience in a botique hotel in Mexico and it was a refreshing change from our normal giant all-inclusive type vacations. The hotel is beautiful. It was very romantic and quiet , yet only a block away from all the excitement on 5th Avenue. My husband and I enjoyed visiting the different restaurants and pubs available just steps away. We also loved La Bistro, the restaurant at La Tortuga. It is a great value since you receive a voucher for 50% off for three meals with your stay at the hotel. As most who post a review mention, the staff of La Tortuga is great. The weather during our stay was not perfect , much rain, but we were able to make the best of it since we were at a wonderful hotel and great location in Playa del Carmen.

<Title>“Great resort near the beach”
<Content>On the recommendation of friends who stayed there last year, we booked our spring vacation at La Tortuga. We were greeted with drinks when we arrived, and given a tour of the lovely grounds. We had a swim-up room, it was small but clean and well air-conditioned. Walking off our deck into the pool was a real treat! We loved that the hotel was a block off the "main drag" of Fifth Avenue, but still walking distance to all the fun nightlife and an easy walk to the beach. La Tortuga is not like the all-inclusive, massive city-sized resorts that line the beaches. The staff are friendly and helpful. The small size of the hotel(50 or so rooms) makes it feel almost "homey", and we had a great time getting to know the other guests who were there during our stay. The breakfast (that is included with your room!) is VERY filling, we would eat around 10 and skip lunch, which was a good money saver. The hotel pool is beautiful and well maintained, it was a great place to spend the day reading with a margarita in hand. The two things we would do differently on a return trip: - Book excursions outside the hotel. We booked a trip to Chichen Itza through the hotel, and discovered that it was overpriced - others in our van had paid much less for the same trip by booking through one of the vendors on Fifth Ave. - Not pay for the hotel airport shuttle. There are public buses that run from the airport to a bus station about 5 blocks away, for MUCH cheaper than the $50/pp rate that the hotel offers. All in all, we loved it and would go back in a heartbeat!

<Title>“Amaaaazing honeymoon!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at La Tortuga for our honeymoon back in June ('08). It was the first trip to Mexico for both of us so we stayed FAR away from those cheesy over-priced "all-inclusives" and we're SO glad we did! We're both 25 and love to drink and have fun- but you can do that anywhere, we came to Mexico to experience Mexico, to explore on our own, taste new foods (not crappy buffets), check out all the hot-spots and shows, go on our own excursions not ones that are appointed to us. We were on our own schedule and it was p e r f e c t!! Plus it was all WAY cheaper than an all inclusive, nothing went to waste! I've vacationed all over the states but I've never been to a place as fantastic as La Tortuga! It was made for us! It was romantic, inviting, cozy, unique, modern, natural, intimidating, clean and fun! Everyone, even the guests, were very welcoming and happy to see us- (I would say we felt at home there but people up here are no where near as hospitable and relaxed). We came to Mexico to chillax, go on some adventures and soak in the sights and tastes of PDC and we did just that and more! We did everything we planned to do but were mostly spontaneous, which was exciting and romantic. I have so many great memories of this hotel but the courtyard was my favorite- the water is cool and clean, the layout is unique and modern, there are plants and trees all around you, and the pool-side bar was almost as fantastic as the servers. We had a swim-up room the first 4 nights which I TOTALLY recommend! We stayed in the Superior room also, which I can't say enough about- private fenced in courtyard, private pool, a huge jacuzzi, huge bed- perfect for two young honeymooners (p.s. the spa is awesome too)! My advice: Stay at La Tortuga! Like I said, this was our first trip to Mexico and they took care of everything! Our private ride to and from the airport, booking personalized excursions, delicious breakfasts, honest recommendations, anything we needed, we never hesitated to ask. Thanks La Tortuga and Bernardo! We had the time of our lives!

<Title>“Best hotel we've ever stayed at”
<Content>My husband and I have traveled all over the world and La Tortuga was definitely the best hotel we have ever stayed in. La Tortuga has the perfect mix of hospitality, luxury, and personal service - especially amazing given the price we paid. We stayed in the Standard plus King room for 9 nights in September 2008. The bed was comfortable, the shower was huge with great water pressure and plenty of hot water, and the room was very clean - even behind the bed! The room also had a great balcony looking out over the pool. The pool was spectacular. The pictures don't really do it justice. There are several lounge chairs (that are very comfortable) and some off in more secluded areas. After a few days on the beach we almost preferred the pool to the beach. El Bistro is the hotel restaurant - where you get breakfast every morning (breakfast is included in the meal). The menu has a lot of variety and the food is quite good. The staff at El Bistro was very attentive. Finally, the hotel staff were great. Everyone had a smile and a genuine warmth about them. Anything we needed - we got. The bar staff were great as well. We echo the recommendations for the mohitos. We arranged transportation through the hotel to and from the airport. We literally got out bags, got through customs and was at the hotel (30 -40 minutes drive) less than an hour from the time we landed. The hotel also included passes to Mamita's Beach Club which we really enjoyed. We read some reviews that called it loud and crowded - we didn't get that. However, we were there during the start of slow season.

<Title>“Feels like home”
<Content>Me and my girlfriend had a perfect time at La Tortuga. From the first moment we came there, we had a very warm welcome (yeah it was also hot outside). The hotel is a little paradise on the backside of a huge shopping street. Everybody was very nice and if you need something you only have to ask. From the moment we came in till the moment we left we felt like home. we had a great room with a beautiful view from the balcony. The service is something to talk about. Everything was perfectly arranged. Thank you to every person who works there for the great time we had there. See you guys next year. Alex Nagy & Kjersti de Jong

<Title>“La Tortuga is fabulous”
<Content>I can't say enough good things about La Tortuga. There is a reason that they are number one in Playa, they earn it. We spent only 4 nights at La Tortuga and wish that we could have spent more time there. Everyone goes out of their way to take care of you, they honestly make you feel like a guest at their home. We had an unfortunate event happen when we first arrived, I lost our passports in the taxi. They made phone calls for us, filed reports for us, printed out paperwork for us, everything and anything they could do to help us out. We did not get the passports back but the hotel staff genuinely cared about us and our situation and did all they could to make us feel better and comfortable. We feel as if we truly made friends with the staff. Anna at the front desk even emailed me the other day to check and see if we made it home okay without passports. A word of advice, always get the taxi number. The food and service at El Bistro was very good. They give you so much food for breakfast (included in your room rate) that you don't need to eat lunch and we didn't any of the 3 days. I highly recommend the Moultenanous and Chiliquales for breakfast. I know my spelling of those is absolutely horrible. For dinner, they have a wonderful grouper with lobster sauce and they even have lobster which was also good but not on the menu. All of their food seemed to be very good and reasonably priced. We stayed in a junior suite, room 302 and it was beautiful. The room was always clean and had a nice bathroom. It had a rooftop jacuzzi which we used almost every night. A word of warning though, if you use the bubbles provided make sure you don't use too much. I accidentally poured in almost half a bottle and bubbles were flying everywhere. We had no street noise and no hotel noise. Things are pretty quiet around there anyway. Even the music at the open bar is soft. The pool was beautiful and very relaxing. They have a hot tub in the pool area as well as a water treadmill too for those who want some exercise. We took the ADO bus to Playa from the Cancun airport and it was an hour long bus ride and only cost $17 for both of us. The busses are very nice and inexpensive for those on a budget who don't wish to arrange private transportation. It's not a chicken bus. The busses are actually better than American Greyhound busses. To get to the busses, walk out of the Cancun airport and walk to the right, you'll see the busses parked there and you can pay the attendant at the bus to get your ticket. You luggage goes underneath. When you arrive at the Playa bus station, walk out to your right to grab a taxi at the corner of Juarez. The fare should only be $3 U.S. don't pay any more. If you wish to hoof it, take a left out of the bus station walk about 5 blocks to Calle 14 and hang a left, La Tortuga is on your left at the end of the street. About a 15 minute walk with hassling from the street vendors on 5th. Hope this review helps. I found La Tortuga on Trip Advisor and I'm glad that I did. Go to La Tortuga, you will not be disappointed unless you are the the most picky person on the planet.

<Title>“Pure Magic!!!”
<Content>Where or where do we start with La Tortuga??? When we arrived from Dublin, Ireland after a long day of travelling we were treated with 1st class service! A very refreshing and welcomed fruit juice upon arrival was waiting for us with Lisa, who throughout the holiday (2 weeks) was an absolute pleasure to deal with! Never any problem regardless of our requests, questions, trips, breakfast vouchers, dinner reccomendations.... We had a quick shower in our lovely room (212) and made our way to El Bistro for a bite to eat. You would be pushed to find any faults with the Hotels restaurant. Compared to 5th Avenue, this restaurant is such great value for money and they have a varied menu which gave us great choice. Pablo (who hopefully will be manager by now) was fantastic at his job and again, no matter what request, no problem! A special mention for Santiago and Esteban too, I hope they read this review, because they were so friendly always had a smile! Plus you can avail of their meals for half price with the vouchers you get at reception!! Beach Club? You have 2 Choices, Zenzi or Mamitas.... Personally we preferred Zenzi, about 10 minute walk, mind you that was a very slow walk looking at shops etc on the way. We have read people on this site say mamitas is too far away....? Don't make me laugh, your supposed to be on holidays and its about a 15 minute stroll away, but worth every step! Back to the hotel... Every time we passed staff in the hotel we were greeted with a genuine "Hola" from all the staff. They were constantly making sure the hotel was in great shape and done this without being intrusive on anyone! We were in room 212 and no noise to be heard at night, so a great sleep was had on lovely beds! I took pics of the towel art everyday, but rather than put them up on this review, go to la Tortugas and look for yourself, you wont be disappointed! The pool lagoon set up to cool you off is very unique and different, but a lovely surprise compared to the usual square pools! The water tread mill takes a bit of getting used to but hey, your on hols so take your time! The geckos scampering around the trees at the lagoon are a lovely addition and the hammocks laid out and around the place are worth at least 30 mins in to just lounge the day away!!! Pablo, Esteban, Santiago, Lisa, Anna, and the rest of the staff of this hotel are a credit to the tourist industry and the hotel will go from strength to strength in the future!! Being irish, we have to comment on the bar....pure bliss....la tortugas mojitos could not be described in words, just taste your first one and your in Mayan Heaven!!! Well Done Daniel!!! Would we go back? In an Irish heartbeat! David - Dublin, Ireland!

<Title>“Brilliant towel art was the least of it!”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at La Tortuga from September 1 - September 6, 2008, and everything was perfect! The staff were amazing and helpful, the room was comfortable and immaculate, the food at El Bistro was delicious, and I've seen some towel art in my time, but this was A++. The location was convenient to everything - Quinta Avenida was only one block away and Mamita's Beach Club was easily within walking distance. I can't rave enough about La Tortuga or Playa del Carmen, and I really don't think it has anything to do with the fact that I arrived with a boyfriend and departed with a fiance (so cheesy, but awesome.) If you have any specific questions, please feel free to contact me, because this trip was so worth it!

<Title>“Heaven on earth”
<Content>Myself and 3 girlfriends stayed at La Tortuga last year. The pool and gardens actually are just as beautiful as they look on the website - the best i've ever experienced in a resort. This is a small, beautifully designed hotel with a great restaurant (not to mention the mojitos!) and charming staff - thanks Anna and Danni :). The rooms are clean and comfortable and in an authentic but tasteful mexican style. You will also find the location (just away from 5th Ave) to be convenient yet quiet. Its a bit of a walk to the beach, but you just shop as you go! :) Having had two of us with lost luggage when we arrived at the airport in Cancun, it was such a relief to have the staff at La Tortuga arrange communications with the airport until it was found. I would highly recommend this hotel, and look forward to returning one day. Claire, 22, Australia.

<Title>“MOLDY ROOM”
<Content>When we walked into our top floor room we were hit by the overwhelming smell of MOLD. It was so overpowering that immediately I got a sore throat. Anyone suffering with asthma or allergies would not have been able to spend 1 minute in this room. We decided to see if we could just air it out for a few hours but no luck. It was just pervasive. We let the woman at the front desk know and asked to change rooms. She said "No , that would not be possible but we will give you a dehumidifier." This did nothing. We barely slept that first night and in the morning my husband went and spoke with a gentleman and was told that he would try to put us in a different room that day. What a surprise! He was able to do this. Later that day we moved to a new room. It also had a faint smell of mold but NOTHING compared to the first room, so we were just grateful for that. BUT... later the air-conditioner broke in our room. This was repaired promptly. We spoke with others guests in the hotel and they did not notice the mold problem in their rooms so this may have just been bad luck. Unfortunately I don't remember the room #s or I would just suggest to stay away from those. Although my sister also stayed here in April 2008 for one night and she did notice a faint smell of mold as well. The hotel grounds are quite nice , the staff pleasant with the one exception of the female receptionist, and it is a great location. We really loved Playa but would not return to this hotel.

<Title>“Best Kept Secret in Playa!”
<Content>After extensively reviewing hotels in Playa, we decided to book at La Tortuga based upon its TripAdvisor rating. Of all the places we visited in Playa, our favorite was hanging out at the hotel! We had very high expectations, but were blown away on every level. The reservation process was our first great experience...Anna with reservations responded in a timely manner each time we had a question or needed to make changes to our schedule. We booked more than thirty days in advance, and we were able to save an additional 10% by paying in advance via PayPal. When we arrived we were greeted outside the airport by our driver that the hotel arranged for us. (They also advised us well to ignore the abundance of salespeople trying to sell transportation and excursions when making our way from customs to our pick up just outside the airport.) A few days before our arrival we called to arrange excursions through the hotel, and Bernardo within 5 minutes had our whole weekend planned. We opted to do half-day tours, so we could spend time on the beach...although we spent more time at the hotel. (One recommendation: If you do not like riding buses or carpooling with others, you may prefer to have private transportation setup.) Upon our arrival Ivan and Bernardo knew us by name, and gave us refreshing non-alcoholic cocktails. We soon met the two bartenders Fidel and Daniel who were extremely nice and attentive to us during our entire 4 night stay. Since we booked a Swim Up room and had direct access to the pool, we could swim up to the bar and drink Pina Coladas made to order...and we didn't have to even leave the pool as a simple nod to Fidel or Daniel meant we were ready for another Pina Colada. The room was a perfect size, and the maid service was exceptional. A couple nights we asked that all our sheets be replaced since we brought in sand from the beach, and they happily replaced them and left us tower sculptures each time. And if being in Playa is not enough of a stress reliever, there is a full spa attached the hotel. We opted for a couples full body massage, and were very pleased. Our last night, we reserved the rooftop terrace for a private dinner. This was the exclamation point to a perfect vacation. We could order anything and everything on the menu...that night they had fresh lobster from the Yucatan that we indulged in. In addition, we had desert flambeed table-side and experienced exceptional service. (The cost was fixed at $120US and was charged to the room.) In general the restaurant was great and a great value...on top of that we received a half-price voucher for for 3 meals making it a steal AND breakfast was complimentary. We are already planning on returning to Playa and will look no further than Hotel La Tortuga!

<Title>“Relaxing and very enjoyable”
<Content>Loved our short stay here. From check-in, where we were presented with a complimentary drink after a long journey, the service was excellent. The hotel has a great pool area, with unusual but relaxed pool with loungers and garden and a fantastic bar, serving great juices and cocktails. Perfect to come back to after a day out. Our room (a jnr suite) was spacious with a jacuzzi and hammock on the terrace, which we made good use of. It was good value for what you get. Location is also excellent and the hotel is a very short walk from shops, bars, restaurants and the beach. There's also a decent restaurant in the hotel. Only downsides were that hot water didn't seem to be available at all times and that our stay was very short! Would love to come back.

<Title>“FAR Better than expected!!!”
<Content>We were SO happy with everything! I can't say enough great things about this place. Everything from the location to shopping and beach, the cleanliness of the entire grounds and room, the super-friendly and helpful staff, the FANTASTIC food in their El Bistro restaurant and on and on and on....The only negative was that we wish we could have stayed longer!! If we only knew! So next time we will book at least a week there. The most beautiful and lush tropical grounds with a pool that was "out of this world" unique and one last thing, but far from least is that our first night at dinner we paid and added a 20% tip to the bill and when we walked out of the restaurant the waiter (Estaban/Steve ?) came running after us to tell us that the tip was already included and we did not need to double-tip. We were so impressed with the service and honesty (not to mention probably the best fresh lobster we ever had) that we told him to keep the tip anyway! Even the room had a small frig that was stocked with complimentary goodies! (yes complimentary!) Oh and did I forget to mention that if you stay there you get free breakfast and 50% of dinner? In Playa we will not look anywhere else to stay. La Torguga is by far the best of Playa Del Carmen!!! We felt very safe there too, the "Policia" were everywhere on the streets and very nice and spoke English!

<Title>“A great time in Playa del Carmen!!!!!”
<Content>Hello! What a great time my boyfriend and I had at La Tortuga. We stayed there from August 11-15th for a bit of a getaway from New Jersey. I picked La Tortuga after reading everyone's reviews so I think it’s only fair I add in my experience. We arranged pickup through the hotel to and from the airport. The ride from Cancun's airport is about an hour in a standard sedan type. Everyone we were in touch with through La Tortuga was extremely friendly. I booked the hotel directly through their website and was given a certain discount because I was booking so much ahead of time! (Any little place to save money helps!) During the drive down to Playa del Carmen, the driver (his name escapes me!) gave us restaurant suggestions as well as how to find our way to Tulum - - a great start to our trip. Our room at La Tortuga was a standard room, number 24. It is right off the bar on the 2nd floor with a small balcony facing the pool. The room was a standard room, with a simple bathroom and amenities. Everyone had said how amazing the beds at La Tortuga were but unfortunately that wasn't the case in our room! I guess ours was missing that great bed. We had absolutely no problems with the room other than the bed as well as at night you do hear the cars driving up and down 10th avenida (a main road). If I may suggest, ear plugs are a great thing to have there! The hotel also provided a safe in the room which made me feel very comfortable knowing my belongings were safely stored while out for the day. As far as restaurants on 5th Avenue, there's a huge amount to choose from. We went to Blue Lobster (sit on the top balcony looking over at the street because mariachi players consistently ask you if you’d like a song played ), 100% Natural (I had an amazing smoothie “Oasis” but be aware as far as the ice. . .a general Mexico tip. The food there also was very good), Babe's Noodles (one is near Mamita's beach club but that does not open until 4pm so we went to the one further down 5th avenue). Also one night we walked to Ah Cacao chocolate café - - it is in the direction towards Mamitas and heading further north (5th ave + Constituyentes). They had amazing chocolate moose and ice cream! For day trips, we took the Colectivo (very easy to use!) that leaves from Calle 2 Norte between Av. 15 and 20. It is probably about a 10 minute or so walk from the hotel. You will see a line of white ‘minibuses’ lined up and someone comes up to you asking your destination. We were headed to Tulum ruins and specified we wanted the ruins and not the town. I thought it was 20 pesos per person but we were charged 30 pesos. . . I don’t know if prices have changed or they made extra money off of us. The bus is air conditioned (a bit?) and used by tourists and locals. It’s an easy way to get from one destination to another without having to rent a car. The colectivo dropped us off on the road that leads down to Tulum and from there we walked about 10 minutes or so to the entrance. There is a beach at the ruins so you can always plan a full day there, to see the ruins and then relax on the beach. The cost to get into the ruins is about 50 pesos per person. Another day trip was a half day trip I planned as a gift to my boyfriend. We went with Mexico Blue Dream, a company I had also found on Tripadvisor. They have several options for either full day, half-day, etc and me and my boyfriend did the half-day trip to Cozumel. I arranged, through email, for the company to pick us up at La Tortuga because I did not know where they were located. The owner Patrice and his son Pierre picked us up in a cab and from there we went to the Cozumel ferry. The tour was very well priced (I believe 35 per person and then the cost of the Cozumel ferry). Once in Cozumel, Mexico Blue Dream has a set relationship with another snorkeling company there. I do not know how their other tours function but I’m sure as smoothly as ours. With the Cozumel trip we visited 3 different reef sites on a small glass bottom boat. There were about 10 people on the small boat which was a nice, small group. My boyfriend loved the gift and I highly suggest brining underwater cameras to capture the sea life!! I ended up putting together an entire "playa del carmen" guide - compiling everyone's reviews here on tripadvisor. It was a great reference for me and my boyfriend as far as finding somewhere to eat for the night and other little tid bits around PDC. If you'd like that, send me a message because I'd be happy to send it around!! Overall our experience in Playa was great! We’d certainly stay at La Tortuga again and try out another room!

<Title>“Best vacation ever”
<Content>My wife and I spent our honeymoon at LaTortuga. I can't rave enough about this hotel!!! I booked the hotel based on the reviews by trip advisor. I was a little scared because I saw an occasional review that wasn't great. All I can say about that is trust me, this hotel was wonderful. It was incredibly clean. The shower was great, there was no mold, and the room had no smell of smoke whatsoever. The grounds were meticulous. The pictures simply do not do it justice. It seemed that every time I looked down at the pool there was a person skimming out the occasional leaf. The staff was the best I've ever seen. Oftentimes you encounter staff at hotels who are very nice but for some reason it just doesn't seem that genuine. The people here are genuinely nice. Lisa, Fredo, and our maid Noemi were wonderful. Oftentimes, when we returned to the hotel Fredo and Lisa were there with a smile. It was a nice touch. With the hotel you get free breakfast. You get your choice of what's on the menu at the restaurant next door which is part of the hotel. The restaurant is great. We only ate breakfast there but it was always delicious. The restaurant staff was amazing and at the end of our trip went out of their way to hug us good-bye. You should stay here if you are looking for something a little different from an all-inclusive. This allows you the opportunity to eat lunch and dinner out which is what we were looking for. La Tortuga is in a great location, just steps from all of the action. You get free breakfast, free beach towels, free passes to an awesome beach, and a beautiful scenic ten minute walk to the beach. Finally, it is quiet. No loud noises or parties. I'm writing all this because it was trip advisor that made me book this hotel. My only hope is that La Tortuga stays a little bit of a secret so we can go back whenever we want.

<Title>“Can’t Beat the Turtle”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel La Tortuga for 10 nights in July and August. We were married in Playa Del Carmen, and many of our guests stayed in La Tortuga as well. I believe our party had 16 total rooms at the hotel. This was our second stay at La Tortuga. Previously (5/2008), we had stayed in a Standard (or maybe Standard Plus) room, which was comfortable and relaxing. This time, we stayed in a Superior Junior Suite (I forget the number, but it was near the lagoon with a large hammock in front… maybe 16?). The room was incredible – the bed, shower, closet, roof terrace with hot tub… everything exceeded our expectations. I remember the bed in the Standard room being fine, but the bed in the suite was the best I have encountered in Mexico. I was blown away at the friendliness and high quality of service from every employee. Seriously, I didn’t encounter a single bad apple. Every morning we would head to the restaurant and choose from one of the incredible breakfasts (The Mayan-style eggs, or motuleños, were my wife’s favorite), a cold drink (watermelon/sandia water was excellent, as was pineapple and chaya/Mayan spinach), and a hot drink (if you ordered one of their incredible iced cappuccinos, they would let that count as your hot drink). Hands-down, the greatest “free continental breakfast” I have ever had at a hotel before. After 10 consecutive days, there were still more items on the menu that I wanted to try. Breakfast was served until noon every day, but one day my brother and his wife were too late. They were then offered lunch instead (equally excellent – as were the dinner options), and STILL got a free meal. All of the restaurant staff (Jose, Esteban, Pablo, and Danny to name a few) were absolutely top notch. The other staff were excellent as well. At the front desk, Lisa and the man who worked the day shift (I can’t remember his name) always greeted us with a warm smile every time we passed through the lobby. They were very helpful with all of our questions and requests (and with over 30 guests staying at the hotel… we had quite a few). Alfredo carried bags and opened doors always with a smile. The women who cleaned the rooms were always cheery and left us with a new towel friend every day. Plus, at all times there were countless others working to clean the pool, squeegee the deck, sweep the solarium… it was all like finely coordinated clockwork that kept the place running smoothly. We stayed in the hotel through a tropical storm, and when we woke up the next day all of the fallen leaves and debris had already been whisked away. I only had two complaints about the hotel. The first was a minor one: the air conditioner leaked water into our room. Sure, I was probably at fault by pushing it too hard and trying to create “the coldest room in Mexico”… but it was kind of a bummer to wake up to water dripping on some of our things. The second complaint is a bit more significant: the hotel’s swimming lagoon was far TOO appealing for my own good. With so many sights to see in Playa and the surrounding areas, there were many days when I found myself missing out on daytrips, beach adventures, etc. because I was drawn to the lagoon. “I’m just going to go around another time… let me go swim under the deck again … okay, just five minutes playing in the water treadmill … fine, fine, how about visiting our friends in the swim-up room … what’s that you say, I can order a drink while I relax on this sunning platform OR in the hot tub … sweet, but then I am going to hide under the bridge…” I think one of the other guests summed up the lagoon best when she said that the lagoon made you feel like you were in elementary school all over again. Lots of fun… but I found it very difficult to pull myself away! I still have dreams about that lagoon. Hotel La Tortuga is hands-down the best hotel I have stayed at or visited in Playa Del Carmen. It has the perfect blend of service, facilities, atmosphere, and location. While Playa Del Carmen has many great hotels, this one simply can’t be beat. Our guests were spread out over 8 different hotels for our wedding, yet everyone was drawn to the Turtle. It deserves to be #1.

<Title>“Great Stay will be back!”
<Content>Everything from the staff to the room was amazing. My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon and loved everything about this hotel and will be back after our daughters are old enough to stay. The breakfast was amazing, they had champagne and roses on our bed when we arrived. We did have dinner our first night here also the waiters were great and the food amazing. The pool area was so beautiful. We used our terrace jacuzzi every night the most amazing thing I have ever seen. We did go down to the beach club one day and hung out at the pool. I highly recommend to all honeymooners, romantic getaways.

<Title>“We want to go back to La Tortuga again!!!”
<Content>I have stayed at La Tortuga about 12 times over the past 6 years. When I got engaged, I just knew that I wanted for my now husband and I to stay there for our wedding/honeymoon for 9 nights!!! We reserved one of the new deluxe junior suites. We were picked up promptly by the transportation arranged by the hotel. The driver recognized me from my previous trips there. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by the always friendly Bernardo. We were given a welcome drink and then Anna, who works in reservations, came out to greet us. Our room was ready for us and with the help of one of the staff, we were in our gorgeous room. Oh my gosh...this room was super nice!!! They had the room decorated with flowers, balloons, and a welcome sign. The room was large and spacious. It had double sinks, a very nice glass shower, and the bed was super comfy. Loved that jacuzzi right in the room (which we used later)!!! Our room was in the back and we had one of those cool mattresses outside our door and we loved lounging on it after we came in out of the pool right before going into the room. We had made all of our wedding plans through the wedding coordinators that La Tortuga recommended and we were quite satisfied and amazed of how wonderful the two ladies were. It was even more beautiful then we imagined. We decided to have our reception on the rooftop solarium that we arranged with Pablo at the hotel's restaurant, El Bistro. El Bistro has some amazing food and the food at the reception was superb. The waitstaff did an excellent job and the setting on the solariium was stunning!!! All of our guests stated that the food was the best they had ever had at a reception!!! When we returned to our room after the reception, they had our room decorated again with beautiful flowers, a fruit tray, and sparkling wine!!! Some other things to add.....we enjoyed many afternoons in the lovely pool sipping on Pina Coladas (best in town, imho), the staff was very accommodating to each and every request we asked for, and the hotel is in such a great location. Very central to the places we enjoy going. We miss La Tortuga already and can't wait to return. Already planning our next trip back......

<Title>“La Tortuga is great!”
<Content>We had a great time at this hotel! The staff is super friendly and the food at El Bistro is really quite good. Esteban was so nice and helpful with some great travel tips. We stayed in a junior suite and it was nice, our only complaint is that we had bed bugs! We got bitten alive every night for 7 nights! Bug spray seemed to help, but you shouldn't have to spray yourself down each night before crawling into your bed on vacation! Other than this we had a great time. The pool is lovely, and all the palm and banana trees make it very relaxing and a beautiful hotel. The only other thing I would suggest is that the bar open earlier and stay open later if possible. I would definitely go back here and reccommend the hotel to a friend, however the bed bugs might prevent me from booking again.

<Title>“Nice”
<Content>We stayed in La Tortuga in the last week of July at the end of a 3 week holiday to the Yucatan. We decided to book Tortuga because of the rave reviews it has been receiving on Tripadvisor. Yes it is a nice hotel. Check in was quick and easy and even though we arrived early our room was ready in 15 minutes. In the mean time we were given a complimentary drink, which was welcome in the heat. We had let the hotel know that this was a second honeymoon for us as our honeymoon proper had been a disaster. When we were shown our room we were delighted and surprised to find that the bed was decked out with petals and flowers and lovely towel sculptures! There was also a bottle of Cava chilling for us. Lovely touch and much appreciated. We were in a swim-up room. It was amazing to be able to step out of the room and into the water. The room itself is fine. We had 2 queen size beds as all the king sized had been booked up. The beds are comfortable and the air conditioning is very welcome. There is a safe and mini-bar in the room; although restocking of the minibar was a bit haphazzard. Our coffee was never replenished and the bar itself wasn't refilled for a few days. The bathroom was not great. The shower was abysmal. It was nearly impossible to wash my hair as there was not enough water to get the shampoo out of it. The pool is very nice, although it seems to be very highly chlorinated. It turned my husbands white board shorts a lovely green!!!! The staff are exceptional. Nothing is too much hassle and everything was carried out with good grace and a smile. Makes a huge difference. Beach clubs: We tried both places during our stay. Mamitas is free with your voucher. It is a little bit of a walk but not too bad. It gets very very busy though and the music is very loud and quite annoying. Zenzi is much closer and much quieter. If you spend ten dollars each on food you get your beds free. The food is really really good here so you should have no trouble spending the money! One thing to watch though is that the canopies do not offer much shade. The sun can still shine through and burn. Just watch out! The main complaint I have is to do with the room. One afternoon we were taking it easy as I was sick for a few days. We were watching tv in our room when we noticed someone on our terrace. He was moving around and then tried to open the door. Luckily we had it locked. My husband shouted and the man left very quickly. We rang the front desk and informed them what had happened. They told us they would get security on to it. Later on my husband went down to check on something else and asked them what had happened. They told him that it had been a man who was having lunch at the restaurant and said he wasnted to "see the rooms"!!!!!! He was escorted of the property. I don;t know if we would have been informed of this if we didn't ask. Yes I would recommend this hotel, but it is not the ultra amazing place that a lot of reviews have made it out to be.

<Title>“La Tortuga Exceeded Our Expectations”
<Content>Our daughter was married this past weekend in Playa del Carmen and about 30 people in our party stayed at La Tortuga. My husband and I were fortunate enough to have 7 full days and we could not have been happier with the location or the accommodations. Like many, we chose La Tortuga because of its rating on Trip Advisor and while I'm sure that our experience was enhanced by the presence of family and friends, I cannot begin to express how beautiful this hotel is or how wonderful it's staff. From Alex, who met us at the airport to Lisa at the front desk, to Anna who held my hand (via email) through much of the planning to the wonderful breakfast crew who seemed to genuinely share in our pre-wedding excitement we could not have been surrounded by a more amazing group of people. We had a swim-up room which was small but cozy and housed the most comfortable mattress I've ever experienced. Pictures do not do justice to the view from our patio and I'm already missing the incredible breakfasts. We used our 50% voucher for a couple of dinners and were not disappointed. The food was amazing. Always peaceful and never crowded the pool and courtyard provided a perfect retreat from the heat and humidity. I would return in a heartbeat, a sentiment that was echoed throughout our group. Kudoes to everyone connected with La Tortuga. You and your hotel deserve to be #1.

<Title>“Great Time at La Tortuga!!”
<Content>Absolutely Wonderful Stay! Five friends (all women) were there celebrating my best friends bachelorette party. From the welcoming by the hotel staff all the way till our good-byes, and everything in between was great! The breakfast was excellent with a lot of variety. The room was left spotless every day after the chamber maid came by (her name was Rosa). The entire staff was very attentive. They place itself was very low key. Would recommend some mood music by the pool during the day. Would highlhy recommend this hotel. 5 stars in my book! BTW- Make sure you don't leave without a visit to Senor Frogs (within walking...crawling distance from hotel).

<Title>“perfect wedding!”
<Content>We found La Tortuga after doing lots of research on this site, and stayed there last May when we got engaged. We loved it so much that we chose to stay there with our guests for our wedding. There were 9 couples total and we felt like we owned the place. Both of us work for a major hotel chain, and this is our favorite hotel. It is charming and unique, and the service is unbelievable. Jessica helped us with our reservations for our guests and was very responsive. Pablo managed our welcome dinner at the solarium and it was amazing. Esteban served us at breakfast and got to know our whole group. Fidel and Daniel worked the bar and were really great. We still remember their names 3 months later. When we left we got hugs and kisses from all. We stayed in room 117 right next to the pool, with a hammock and 2 chairs in front and a rooftop jacuzzi. The room was modern and comfortable, great a/c, double stone sinks, big glass shower. Hot breakfast is included daily, our favorite is the montulenos. Happy hour is 5-6pm and is 2x1, try the frozen mojito and don't miss the Clase Azul tequila -- very smooth. The location is great, steps from the center of town. The beach club is a good 10 minutes but a nice walk, or you can walk 2 blocks to the public beach. We love Playa so much we often consider buying a condo, but would miss our friends at La Tortuga! We plan to return for our anniversary if not sooner. La Tortuga deserves to be #1!

<Title>“Fabulous Boutique Hotel in PERFECT location!”
<Content>This hotel was amazing! It was homey and relaxing. The staff were wonderful, and we loved the free breakfast every morning. Definitely recommend the fruit plate and whole wheat pancakes. Dinner was also excellent, especially with the hotel guest discount on top of the already reasonable prices. The bed was super comfortable. We had a junior suite on the 3rd floor. Our room could use some updating as we saw others that had been, but it was nice and clean. Perfect distance from 5th ave. Didn't really hear much noise at night, but had the luxury of a short walk to all of the action. The beach at Mamitas was beautiful. We had no problem getting lounges and umbrellas. The pool was just right and fun to swim around in. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay, and would 100% stay here again, as well as recommend it to any of our friends & family.

<Title>“Dream Hotel”
<Content>Just got back yesterday from Playa. We have stayed at many large hotels that were beyond belief in services offered. The La Tortua is by far now our favorite, even given it's small size the staff can seem to never do enough for the guests. We never once encountered anyone without a smile on their face. This hotel is the cleanest place we have been to. We can't wait to return again and would go back tomorrow if we could. Located right off 5th avenue there are places to eat everywhere. With the beach located a short 2 blocks away. Slept like a baby every night and wondered about the posts about noise cause we never heard any. You can't go wrong with this Oasis in Playa Del Carmen.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay at La Tortuga”
<Content>Typically we stay in all inclusives, but we want to experience more of Mexico. We chose La Tortuga based on all of the reviews on this site. We stayed 3 nights (a bit too short) in a superior jr suite. The bedroom was smaller than I expected, but nicely appointed. The bed was very comfortable, the tv and air worked great. They even emptied the mini-bar for us so that we could fill it with our own beverages. The bathroom was beautiful (although the lighting was not the best). Also, house keeping never hung up our towels let alone replaced them (not a big deal, but worth a mention). We did not use our jaccuzzi tub on the roof top, but we did frequent the pool in the afternoons (very nice). The restaraunt was wonderful as was the bar (try the palmarita's or the mojito's). There was construction early (8:00am in the morning) but we are early risers. We did not hear any music from the night clubs. Overall, it was a great stay, and I would not hesitate to return.

<Title>“Excellent Choice in Playa!”
<Content>Stayed at La Tortuga in mid June while in Playa for a wedding, traveling with my brother. Had read good reviews and agree that the hotel is a great find. Staff - cannot say enough, they were excellent, friendly, helpful, and well trained. Anna in particular was great and helping to make arrangements prior to the trip via email. Laura was also helpful. Rooms - rooms are clean and comforable. I had a swim up room and my brother stayed in a standard plus. They were a little small but perfect for one person. Couples might want to stay in a slightly larger room, but would recommend them all. The air conditioners were a little noisy, but I got used to it. Bath products are great and towels shapped like animals were fun! Food - breakfast was excellent, great choices. Other meals were good and sitting outside to eat was really nice. Spa - spa is very nice, though double check if you are getting your nails done that the staff is trained. I had a great massage and body treatment, but the woman doing my nails had not been trained and it took multiple trys so I would not recommend nail services until Spa Itza hires/trains real manicurists. It was slow, so maybe they use used this woman who was a trained masseuse. But, nail services were not worth the money and I should have just done it myself. I was dissapointed after getting a great pedicure there the year before, during a trip to Playa in 2007. Tours - the hotel will arrange tours at reasonable prices. We went snorkling off the beach. If they don't have a tour that meets your needs they will recommend someone. Pool - very peaceful and cool....extremely nice pool and refreshing on VERY hot days (beware that it is very hot in June!). Overall, highly recommend and can't wait to go back!

<Title>“Love Love Love La Tortuga!!”
<Content>Staying at La Tortuga was one of the best hotel stays we've ever had! Eight of us stayed there in May/June 08 for our wedding (coordinated by the hotel's wedding planners, Caribbean Blue Weddings, which we highly recommend), and we couldn't have asked for a better hotel for this very special occasion! From the beginning, our emails to Anna Bassi were responded to very quickly and with such helpfulness and friendliness, I felt as if we had been friends for years :). Her assistance in providing me with preliminary information on having a wedding there was fantastic, and made our decision to hire Caribbean Blue Weddings very easy. Upon arrival, we were greeted so warmly by Anna and Alfredo, making check-in a breeze (those welcome drinks made it even more pleasant :). Our party had 2 standard plus rooms and 1 standard before the wedding, then my hubby and I stayed in a junior suite thereafter. The standard plus rooms were roomy (one was more roomy than the other...all the rooms at the Hotel are configured a little differently, lending to its charm) with a nice balcony overlooking the wonderful pool oasis at the center of the hotel. The standard room my aunt and uncle had was quite small but nicely appointed, and a good bargain considering the price! The junior suite was great, very spacious and with a nice jacuzzi on the rooftop - very romantic! (staff also beautifully decorated the room for our wedding night - a nice touch with the complimentary champagne too!) All the staff at the hotel and restaurant (Bistro) were excellent, almost all of them knew we were getting married and made it a point to show how happy and excited they were for us, which made us feel right at home. The food at Bistro was excellent! We ate the included breakfast there every day and were very impressed with the quality and quantity. We had dinner there our first night and it was great too. On the day of our wedding the van that was supposed to pick us up broke down, so the wedding planners and the front desk staff (special thanks to Fernanda!) were on it to get us to the chapel as quickly as possible, and it all worked out fine. Bernardo was another staff member who was very helpful and nice to us too...I wish we could remember all the others' names, but honestly every person we came in contact with was awesome. We love that the hotel was not all-inclusive and not a mega resort (only 51 rooms). It's location was perfect...although it's not on the beach you are only a block from the action on 5th Ave and a couple blocks to the beach. We went to Mamita's beach club (the hotel gives you a voucher) one afternoon and loved it...it is a bit of a walk but well worth it. The sand is so soft, no rocks and the water is just gorgeous. Food and drinks there were good too! The only thing that I want to point out to future guests is that the hotel does not have an elevator....while we had no problems with having our luggage brought up, we were traveling with older family members so at times they were a little tired going up and down (but it didn't take away from them liking the hotel, in fact they can't wait to go back!). Also, the jacuzzi didn't have a railing to easily get in/out, so my dad who's in his 70's had a little bit of trouble. Aside from those two minor issues, we LOVED La Tortuga and CAN'T WAIT to return!!!!!!! I can now see why it is rated #1!

<Title>“Absolutely Fabulous!!”
<Content>We traveled to Mexico for our honeymoon in June of 08, the first 2 days we were there we stayed in Tulum, south of Playa, it rained but it was nice anyway. We had stayed in a cabana that had no electricity and it was pretty humid. It was excellent for winding down but I was ready for some action and A/C!! Continued up to Playa and had planned to stay only a few days then going to Cancun. Once we arrived at La Tortuga, I felt like I was a movie star...it's beautiful and the service was spectacular! They greeted us to drinks, escorted us to our room where they had decorated for our honeymoon and had the a/c running so it was nice and cool. The room was very nice, our patio was overlooking their fabulously designed pool. I was so impressed, we decided to stay for the remainder of our trip, we actually never made it to Cancun. During our stay, the service was excellent; thanks Ana, Lisa and Bernardo! There's a resteraunt off of the hotel which actually is set just off the pool. The setting is romantic and the food was excellent.. If you're looking for a smaller hotel with a modern feel, this place is for you.

<Title>“Great Hotel and great location!”
<Content>We love the hotel and all the employees were very nice and friendly. We stayed there June 11-18th for our 10th Anniversary. The check in was quick and easy. We were given our welcome drinks and taken to our room. The room was beautifully decorated with rose petals and flowers on the bed. There was a bottle of chilled champane waiting for us to open! What a great way to welcome us from a long day of flying across the country. Anna, Alfredo, Bernado, Marco were all wonderful. I also have to mention one of the front desk person( I'm sorry I didn't get her name) she has an English accent, she was wonderful made us feel at home! We had the swim up room and it was great! A BIG THANK YOU to the maintenance crew for keeping the place beautiful and clean. One morning I woke up to a zipping noise and I didn't know what it was. I looked outside and he was cutting the grass with his hands using the long scissor like tool. ( sorry I don't know what its call, maybe a branch trimer?) All of them work so hard in the hot sun to make our stay an enjoyable one. We sure appreciate their hard work! The only thing I would suggest for the people that booked their transfer from the hotel is once you get outside of the airport, head towards the bus area. When we walked outside and saw people holding up signs and thought this must be the place to wait. We waited and waited and kept looking for a yellow shirt guy holding a sign with our name for about 30 minutes. In the meantime we had about 5 people coming up to us wanting us to take a taxi from them, for cheap but we kept saying "no thank you". Finally I went inside to call the hotel to have them page the driver who was there, but in a different area. He said he was talking to his friends and was waiting in the bus area. Who would have known to go there? I saw many people with signs waiting for their guests and thought that this was the right place to wait. That was the only miscommunication we had experienced so I thought our trip was great! The ride back to the airport was on time and went smoothly. Overall our trip was great, relaxing and low key.

<Title>“Stay at La Tortuga!!”
<Content>Our experience at La Tortuga was GREAT! My husband and I were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and after reading all the wonderful reviews we booked La Tortuga for a week. The staff was wonderful and you could tell they worked really hard to keep their #1 status in Playa. The hotel is close to 5th street and great restaurants. Another guest told about the Blue Lobster he had read on tripadvisor, and WOW it was really good, our favorite! The breakfast and service at the hotel restaurant was good. Mamitas Beach Club was fun but if you really want a nice quite beach that is not so busy try the other beach club you get access to, ZENZI. Eventhough you have to pay $5 for the other chair it's well worth it and it's way closer!! Thanks to La Tortuga for making our stay a pleasant one, and when we return to Playa del Carmen we will stay there again.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel”
<Content>I returned on Sunday from my stay at La Tortuga. When I arrived last Monday, there was a problem with my room, so I was upgraded to what I think was a Jr. Suite. It was room #116, by the pool. There was a large patio with table and chairs and a hammock that could be strung up. The room was lovely, the bathroom fantastic and a door in the bathroom that led outside and up to a private rooftop sundeck with jacuzzi. I don't think it would afford enough privacy to be naughty, but definitely made me think that this is somewhere I'd want to take a significant other. My friend who was vacationing with me flew in the next day, so I got my bearings by wandering around 5th Ave, which is only one block from the hotel. Tons of shops, restaurants and people watching to keep you busy. I had room service that night...the food from the hotel restaurant was good, nothing I craved again later, but it was fine. I went to the Mamita's beach club the next morning...after breakfast it was a welcoming walk. I don't know why anyone has complained about the walk...perhaps they're not in very good shape and the walk was taxing? When my friend arrived that afternoon, we had to wait around to be moved into the new room, which was a minor inconvenience...I had things in the safe so wasn't comfortable with the hotel staff's suggestion that they move my belongings for me. The person at the desk was a little difficult as he was wanting me to vacate the room I had stayed in the night before because he had other people coming, but didn't have my room. So we had to wait around an hour at the hotel waiting. After the upgrade, the swim up room was a little disappointing. No tub, only a shower and just didn't have the same high end feel of the other room. Probably wouldn't have thought anything of it had I not stayed in the other room first. The swim up room is a novelty...we could have certainly gotten by just fine without the swim up, but I appreciated being close to the pool, bar and restaurant, especially when I saw people trudging up the stairs. Babe's Noodle House was a good spot for lunch, we had a dinner at John Gray's Place...my friend didn't think her dinner was that great, but I enjoyed mine. However, it did have the feel of most typically higher end restaurants. While the staff was pleasant, they were nowhere to be found after our food was delivered...they hung out with each other and ignored us. Our favorite place to eat was El Oasis...best shrimp tacos ever...we went back 3 times! La Parilla and Media Luna on 5th Ave. were not good at all, I wouldn't waste your time. Food was definitely not a highlight for us on this trip. We took the ADO (bus) to Tulum and to Xel-Ha...it was easy and cheap, about $4.40 each way...defnitely cheaper than securing a tour. Xel-Ha is a beautiful place, but I think the price tag is high because of the all-inclusive angle...the food was not very good and I didn't want to overindulge in cocktails or beer since we'd be in the hot sun all day. I enjoyed the bicycles and snorkeling...don't know if I'd go again now that I know what it's all about. All in all, it was an enjoyable stay, the hotel and pool are truly beautiful and I can't wait to show off my photos to friends. I think if I stay here again it will be with a boyfriend though....my friend and I appeared to be the only ones not part of a "couple"...lots of honeymooners around as well. The staff was very friendly, the guys at the restaurant truly engaging and interested in talking to us...then again, we were a couple of single girls! :) Definitely recommend it!

<Title>“Wonderful, Quaint Hotel”
<Content>Our trip was absolutely fabulous. Your hotel was very quaint and beautiful. We very much enjoyed the layout of the pool, the bar, and how the room overlooked that area. Everyone was especially friendly and courteous. Each time we visited the hotel lobby we were greeted with a smile and speedy service. The young man at the front desk was always very helpful; I wish I could remember his name. Our spa service was definitely a relaxing experience that we truly enjoyed. But our most talked about evening was the romantic dinner on the private solarium. Your staff made us feel as though we were the most important couple of the evening. It was as though no one else was around. It could not have been more perfect or more romantic. And we would especially like to send a thank you to Francisco, our waiter, and the other restaurant staff. They did a fantastic job. And the food was so delicious. With sincere thanks, [--]

<Title>“Great find!”
<Content>This boutique hotel is absolutely everything we were hoping it would be. We stayed there for about 10 days while we were in Playa del Carmen for our wedding at Yaxche Maya Cuisine. The rooms are thoughtfully decorated and if you can book a room with a balcony, it's well worth it. They have recently changed their mattresses, for the better, so they are no longer the typical rock hard mattresses found in most Mexico hotels. The pool is just breath-taking and cleaned every morning and also throughout the afternoon. And I did notice that the day of our wedding they were chopping down all the dead leaves from the trees... I don't know if they knew we were going to do our photos there that evening, or if it was just coincidence. Either way, it was a very nice touch! The staff was so helpful, always with a smile and and a friendly greeting. We will especially miss Fidel at the bar and Fernando at the front desk ... El Bistro serves a fantastic breakfast, one that made sleeping in late nearly impossible b/c we did not want to miss it! Try the huevos mayan, you won't regret it! We did not get a chance to eat there for dinner, mainly b/c there were so many other places that we wanted to try. A few of our guests tried it though, and said it was very good. We miss the pool, which is the perfect combination of shade and sun. The hotel offers a free entrance to Mamitas Beach Club, which basically gets you two chairs and a palapa. It's about a 10 minute walk from the hotel or a $2 taxi. It is clear to us that La Tortuga runs a tight ship, very clean and accommodating. I couldn't think of a better place to stay for the week of our wedding.

<Title>“Great value!”
<Content>Just got back from a week's stay with my wife, daughter and her boyfriend, both recent college graduates. Great place for the price. Super location, an easy walk to the main drag and the beach, but far enough away to be peaceful. Clean, friendly, with lots of charm. Central pool/garden/lounging area was very attractive and comfortable. Complimentary breakfast offered a welcome range of choices and the 15% off coupons were appreciated for lunches. The nachos supreme were the best weve ever had & we couldnt resist ordering them several times. The staff was very accomodating. Example 1: We were tired and wanted to rent a DVD to watch and have a night in. The staff brought and hooked up a DVD player in our room and then accompanied our daughter to Blockbuster to rent a movie using their card. Example 2: At our request, the staff emptied the room fridge of minibar food and allowed us to stock it with drinks and fresh food of our choice. Wonderful! Regarding restaurants, there are so many in the area and yet we never had anything approaching a bad dining experience. We even had fun at La Cueva del Chango (the Cave of the Monkeys), which serves what is accurately described as hippie-Mexican food and has a stream running through the restaurant. If youre in a playful mood, its a laid back place that doesnt take itself too seriously and encourages you not to also! I would be remiss not to mention Xel-Ha, the "eco-park". Go towards the end of your stay, when you are beginning to get bored and want your entertainment to be served up to you on a platter. All inclusive, it offers free food, drinks (alcoholic & not), tubing, kayaking, snorkeling, swimming, cenotes, rope bridge, bicycling, rope swing into a pool, cliff diving, etc. We booked, with transport, through the hotel and got a price for $5 less than at the tour agencies. Alltournative tours is also a great group, combining seeing Tulum with swimming in cenotes, seeing a Mayan ritual, biking and ziplining (with a significant pucker factor). Quite a day! And our guide was awesome, speaking good English, but retaining enough of his own culture to remain authentic. Bring lots of dollar bills for tips! Have fun, amigos!

<Title>“Loved our time at La Tortuga”
<Content>My fiance and I stayed at La Tortuga for 5 lovely days in late April of 2008. We chose the hotel based on reviews found on this site and were definitely not disappointed. When we travel, we tend to stay at 5-star, often all-inclusive properties, so this was a different experience for us. We found the staff to be attentive, warm, and helpful. We stayed in a swim-up room which was comfortable and clean. As other reviewers have noted, the rooms are not large or particulary spectacular. However, we didn't find anything lacking. Slept great. No noise problems. Comfortable beds. The food and drinks were excellent. Many of the waiters learned our names and favorite drinks. We also enjoyed the international crowd that we mingled with at the bar and in the pool. I have never been a big "pool" person, but I looked forward to a cool dip after walking around Playa and sitting out at the beach in the heat. After a few days, we spent more time in the pool than in the ocean. We spent the second part of our vacation at a much more expensive all-inclusive. More than once, we remarked that we wished we had booked the entire trip at La Tortuga. We missed the personal touches that the larger resorts can't reproduce. We will definitely be going back to Playa since we are having our wedding there, and we are planning on renting out La Tortuga for our guests. They made a great impression!

<Title>“The Pros out weighed the Cons”
<Content>I must say I got a little obsessive with all the write ups and positive reviews from trip advisor. While the place is beautiful there are a few needs improvements. Let me first start with the positives. The beds, ohhhhh the beds, I have never in my life slept so well, they were amazing, the linens were very clean, the bed was comfortable, we called for extra pillows and they were brought up promptly. Thanks to the people who wrote about them not providing wash cloths, I brought my own. The first day there were two wash cloths, the second day there were none, so we called, they brought dish rags, they were the size of wash cloths but they had a texture on them that didn't make it very comfortable to wash your body with. I took out the wash cloth I brought and used that the rest of the time. I loved the towel art we found on our bed every evening. The air conditioning was amazing in the room, unfortunately housekeeping always turned the air off, so when we arrived back to our room after a hot and sticky day, our room was a little uncomfortable, but it cooled down quickly. We reserved a junior suite with the roof top Jacuzzi, the Jacuzzi takes about 45 minutes to an hour to fill up, so keep that in mind if you want to book a Jacuzzi room. The location is great, you are on block from 5th avenue, and the beach is a few blocks away, not as bad a walk as everyone makes it out to be. We barely heard the music from the bar that so many people wrote about. A few suggestions for the hotel. 1. It would be great to have the staff come around the pool during happy hour to ask if you would like a cocktail. On another happy hour note, let the guests know what time the happy hour runs when they check in. 2. It would also be nice to offer appetizers to purchase during the happy hour. 3. We had terrible luck with dining; it would be nice to offer to send your bellmen to some of the local dining establishments so they could suggest some dining options. It was the biggest thing we missed about staying at a smaller hotel, no concierge to make recommendations. 4. Let the guests know when they check in if they want to use the room safe, you have to get the lock from the desk, we were creative with hiding our credit cards and jewelry. We finally asked if someone could come fix the safe in our room when they told us they provide the locks. 5. While there are no non-smoking rooms at this facility, you could not smell any second hand smoke in the rooms. What was disappointing was there was no designated non smoking area for breakfast, if you are a non smoker, there is no better way to ruin a meal then trying to eat with someone’s smoke billowing over your food. There were a lot of smokers at this facility who would actually have a fork in one hand and a cigarette in the other, take a bite, and take a puff. Thank God my husband is so patient with me and didn't mind moving away from the smokers, although there was no escape. 6. Housekeeping might want to check the soap and toilet paper supply when they clean the rooms. We had to call down to ask for more toilet paper and soap, that's a first for us for staying in a hotel. 7. Slippers in the room would be nice since the tile floor is a little dusty, and leaves a film on your feet when you get into bed at night. I wore my thongs from the time I got out of the shower; I didn't think to bring any slippers. Some of the above and beyond things that we found at La Tortuga. Jose the waiter was so personable and friendly; he would come and shake our hands every time we saw him. The wait staff has a difficult time communicating because their English is so limited, but what they lack in their communication skills they make up in their warmth and welcoming attitude. Anna and another person working there went above and beyond looking for the directions to a monkey reserve we had read about. We ended up getting really lost but the effort was not forgotten. Alfredo the bellman, he usually worked nights, was amazing, we wanted to take a cab to a place we had read about (La Cueva Del Chenga, don't waste your time, it was the worst!) He pulled 3 cabs over to make sure we were getting an honest and fair deal. We just loved him; we couldn't believe the extra effort he went to for us. Some of the dining bloopers we at were Madras Tierra, don't waste your time, and the other La Cueva del Chenga, those two were the worst! The best Mexican food was at La Cocina at XCaret, it was amazing! We also really liked Yaxche, Babes noodle house was very good to. Le Bistro was good too I ordered the chopped steak expecting a ground chopped steak burger and got a bone in rib eye with caramelized onions that were amazing. Don't miss trying dinner at Le Bistro, the food is very good. Overall it was a nice experience, all the hype about how everyone was so friendly was a little over rated, there were a few that stood out, other times there were people who sat at the front desk who never bothered to lift their head to say hello when you walked in the door. When you walked by the housekeeping staffs who were always working to keep the place clean, they were always friendly and said hello. If you are planning on staying at La Tortuga here are a few items we suggest you bring. 1. An insulated water bottle, the hotel does not provide free bottled water, you can go across to the OXXO and buy a couple of bottles, or you can bring your own and fill them up at the water coolers located next to the pool tables. 2. Slippers for in the room already mentioned. 3. If you don't speak Spanish bring a translation book. 4. Wash cloths. 5. A sweat towel to carry around when you walk around town because it is so steamy hot! 6. Bring a hat. 7. Make sure you make time to take the ferry to Cozumel, the water was amazing. And last but not least, we could not end this review without mentioning Happy Hands the $33.00 massage, the place is located next to 100% Natural and is amazing, we went twice. The first was the deep tissue, the second was the relaxing massage and both were amazing, the place was clean, the staff was excellent, and the price was a bargain. When you leave La Tortuga, and you were impressed with the staff, don't hesitate to give them a little extra tip. You will notice they aren't tipped in the morning when you get your free breakfast, these guys work hard and any little extra means a lot.

<Title>“quiet and romantic”
<Content>La Tortuga grounds are what stand out to me the most, especially the courtyard pool area. The hotel felt very private and quiet. This was our ten year anniversary and when we arrived in our room, there was champagne, roses on the bed, and a note to us on the bed as well. I think my expectations of the front desk were set high because of all I read on tripadvisor before I came so I was a bit disappointed with that.Check in was smooth with cocktail drinks served, a nice touch. Fernanda, I believe her name was, was friendly,knowledgeable and helpful. However after the first few days of our stay, a gentleman was then working the front desk who seemed unfamiliar with the front desk position. Example of this is Fernanda called my room the day before I checked out to see if I would like to get a boarding pass printed for my flight the next day. When I went downstairs to do so, she was gone, and the gentleman looked at me puzzled when I mentioned it and said they dont print boarding passes and that I needed to go across the street to the cyber cafe and do it over there. After I explained that Fernanda called my room about this, he said he would make an exception but they usually dont do this and had me walk around the desk and use the front desk's personal computer. I felt awkward. Also, when I asked him for restaurant suggestions he was puzzled and couldnt recommend any to me although he looked through a drawer for some restaurant menus. The bellman always opened the door into the lobby for us which was nice and was polite and helpful. There is happy hour by the way between 5-6 pm where you get 2 for 1 drinks (mixed drinks costs 60-70 pesos usually which is 6-7 dollars so you get 2 drinks for that price from 5-6). After a day at the beach or site seeing it was nice to come back for cocktails by the pool area. The restaurant's prices were reasonable as well. (breakfast was free) I dont know about 50% discount for lunch and dinner like someone else mentioned on here. You may want to ask the hotel about that. The first 3 nights we stayed in a jacuzzi suite with a rooftop jacuzzi. This room is larger than the standard rooms (which we stayed in the last night). The bathrooms in the suites are also modern with bowl sinks and shower glass doors and much nicer than the standard rooms (regular sinks and older bathrooms). Also jacuzzi suite had flat panel tv with good reception and standard room #24 had regular tv with fuzzy reception. But they were both clean and well cared for. I would recommend the suites if you can swing it. We really enjoyed the jacuzzi at night.

<Title>“A quiet oasis run by people who care”
<Content>From the moment Alfredo grabbed our bags off the shuttle and got us our welcome drinks I knew we had picked the right place for our first visit to Playa Del Carmen. These are people who are aware of their number one rating and strive to keep it. Tired from a long day at the beach, without fail, we were amazed to see a staff member literally run to the door to open it for us. We felt pampered and indulged. This is a popular place so be sure to book early. Although we booked 13 weeks in advance we did have to make a room change over the course of our 10 day stay. Our first room # 302 had 2 levels and a roof top jacuzzi with a spacious private outdoor area that included a bed tucked under the stairs. In a word charming. Our second room # 211 was a superior plus which was certainly more of a "no frills" situation, however , it had a better view overlooking the pool. Both were quiet and well appointed. Mamitas was great and breakfasts were fabulous. What more can I say. Go........! You'll love it.

<Title>“Slightly Dissappointed ....”
<Content>I was extremely excited about my upcoming vacation and after reading all the reviews on this site, I instantly booked this hotel and headed to PDC for my first vaction of the year. I was very pleased with the following: 1) hotel location (1 block from 5th ave); 2) property is lovely & well maintained; 3) hotel arranged arrival & departure with Zuley (best option); 4) free passes to Mamitas (eventhough was 7 blocks from hotel); 5) breakfast at (el Bistro) was included with 50% coupon to use for lunch or dinner; and 6) and staff was attentative upon arrival / departure. I stayed in room # 24 and was very dissappointed to learn that the shower curtin was too short, hence the water overflowed all over the floor each time I showered. I contacted front desk immediately and was given extra towels to place on the floor. I was not happy with this resolution so the manager (Benny) came & doubled the links on the curtin which was merely a temp fix. He promised to replace the curtin, however that never happened & I never heard from him again & yes the shower continued to overflow daily ! The front desk staff refused to move me to another room due to property being booked. Had problem with ants in bathroom. The staff was eager to provide dinner /lunch suggestions, of which I only found Oasis to be worth dining more than once. I ate breakfast at hotel which was nice. Did not experience problems with noice (slight sounds of loud cars) but was not an issue. Overall I did not find many of the locals to be friendly , but made the best of my vacation anyway by spending most of time on the beach or shopping on 5th ave. Will most not return to PDC or hotel and would suggest to hotel management to ensure the shower curtin is replaced to avoid someone being seriously injured. Sorry, but hotel or PDC just did not live up to my expectations...

<Title>“Perfect Place in Playa”
<Content>My husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a vacation with no kids. We have two young children and we were ready to get away for a bit. We booked La Tortuga at the beginning of February and we were able to secure a great nightly rate by booking early (20% discount). They do not allow children younger than 12, so we didn't run into any kids at the hotel and secretly wish that we brought ours! The staff is amazing, they are very responsive both by email before you arrive and at the front desk while you are there. The drinks by the pool are great, not the usual watered down fare that one might be used to on vacation. We booked a standard plus room (205) which has two queen beds, a nice sized bathroom with a large stand-up shower and balcony overlooking the pool. For those that are concerned with noise pollution from the street, book a pool-view room. It is very quiet and you won't hear a thing.

<Title>“40th Birthday Celebration”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at La Tortuga from May 2nd through May 7th to celebrate my 40th - no kid's, it was wonderful! Overall the hotel was great during the day. We stayed in Room 101 (Superior Junior Suite) with its own pool, king size bed, and jacuzzi in the bathroom. The rooms were just the right size, the bed very comfortable, the in room mini refrigerator was great for keeping water, beer, soda and whatever cold. The service was fantastic - the front desk booked a trip for us to Chichen Itza, which was wonderful but don't take the trip it you get car sick from bumping around - the trip takes 2 1/2 hours each way!! But was great and well worth it. The shuttle service to and from the hotel was great too - for $98 USD both ways for 2, you can't beat it. They were on time, which was appreciated! They also decorated the room the day of my birthday with balloons. They had 2 pieces of cake and a bottle of champagne chilling too - that was such a wonderful touch and very thoughtful. The hotel does do a good job on the little things! The breakfast was great and the menu had enough variety for us. The OJ was yummy! We didn't eat here for lunch or dinner as we were out and about. For a quick and good Mexican meal, try Oasis just around the corner from the hotel. Great margs and more reasonable than most places on 5th Ave. We did use the 2 beach clubs that come with your hotel stay. Zenzi was not very crowded, but you do need to spend $30 USD to get the chairs for free. No big deal if you are staying all day and eat lunch there. Mamitas doesn't require you to have a minimum purchase, it is a little bit of a walk, but not bad. The beach is more beautiful and they have palapyas, which tended to keep the sun out better than the cloth shades at Zenzi. Now some not so good - the traffic outside our room at night was terrible - very, very noisy. The first night, I don't think I slept much... We eventually got used to the rumbling, but bring ear plugs!! We did figure out how to turn the fan on high on the AC and that did help drown out some of the noise!! But the thumping was not easy to get rid of!! During the day everything is great, but the nights were kind of tough with all the noise. Not much they can do about the traffic, but just be aware of it it your room is on the street side. Overall, our experience was fantastic. This was our 5th time in Playa but our first without kids. We usually rent a house/condo in Playacar, which is easier with the kids... But for a couple or friends traveling together, this place was great!

<Title>“Can't wait to go back!”
<Content>My friend (38) and I (29) stayed at La Tortuga 4/26-4/29. First a little background… This was my fifth time to the area. I’ve previously stayed at Gran Porto Real, Copacabana (Catalonia Tulum now I think), Iberostar Paraiso del Mar and Iberostar Cozumel. It was my friend’s third time down here and he’s previously been to the Iberostar del Mar and Oasis Grand Cancun. Having done only all-inclusive before, we wanted to try something non-AI so we could go into town and eat and explore on our own a bit. So we booked here the first three nights of our trip before moving to the Royal PDC. We were so glad we did! We booked directly on the website and Anna was very quick and pleasant to work with over email. We used their one way transfer from the airport for 55. Check in was very quick. We booked a junior suite with two double beds and the rooftop jacuzzi. The room was very nice and had a balcony overlooking the pool. We never got around to using the rooftop jacuzzi because it was very hot up there during the day and we were usually wiped out by the time we got back to the room at night. The beds were very comfortable and there is a mini bar in the room. You have access to two beach clubs while you are there – Mamitas and Zenzi. We used Zenzi because it was closer and I heard it was less crowded. You pick your passes up at the desk with your towels and you receive two chairs and an umbrella if you spend 20 ( I think) in food or drinks. Make sure you check the receipt before you leave because they forgot to take off the charge for our chairs and umbrella, but quickly corrected it when I pointed it out. Zenzi was nice and clean. The pool at the hotel is very peaceful and we liked relaxing there in the afternoon after the beach or being out. There is a bar at the pool and the drinks are great. The breakfast at the hotel was delicious and the menu had plenty to order from. We never got around to eating at the restaurant for lunch or dinner, but they do give you a discount for staying at the hotel and the menu looked good. The service here is top notch. We rented a car to drive to Tulum one day and hit up the Mega on the way back to stock up on beer and stuff for the room. They saw me walking in with our bags and immediately took them up to our room. Everyone was always willing to go out of their way for you. Tips: 1. Bring bug spray because I got a lot of mosquito bites around the pool probably because of the vegetation. 2. Eat at Casa de Agua in town. BEST meal in PDC ever. Pricey but definitely worth it! 3. Pizza Pazza is all over town and has great pizza. 4. Go to the Mega to stock up on drinks and snacks to save money for while down at the pool. After three nights we headed off to the Royal PDC, but we both agreed we would stay at La Tortuga again. In fact, we’re planning to go there again for a couple nights next year, followed by the Royal PDC again and then extending the vacation on to the Royal Cancun! Email me here with any questions.

<Title>“Loved it.”
<Content>To celebrate our wedding anniversary and finally take a trip without an entourage of children and family members we wanted some place quiet and intimate. We loved the hotel. Great pool, great way to relax, met great people poolside at teh end of the day. Booked a superior junior suite, but never used the rooftop jacquzi. One block Avenida Cinco and it was quiet...except for local construction next door during the day. Nice change from the all-inclusive trips we've done before.

<Title>“Its only when you're gine you realise how much you'd like to be back”
<Content>After reading all the reviews on tripadvisor I booked to stay here for 2 weeks in March. I was expecting a lot and I first I wasn't sure if it was going to live up to my expectations, but as time passed on I just loved it here and really didn't want to leave. Lazing around the bar area, slipping into the pool, just total relaxation. The rooms were fab, the staff were terrific, the restaurant food was some of the best we had in the whole of the resort. I would really recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Nice, clean, friendly”
<Content>We stayed in La Tortuga for a week in mid-April 2008. This was our first visit to Mexico, and we had a very positive overall impression. People in the Playa area, be it in our hotel, restaurants, bars etc were generally very friendly. La Tortuga is very welcoming. We stayed in what was described as a Junior Suite, but what in reality was a moderate sized tourist hotel room. The "suite" type features were limited to the jacuzzi on the balcony (fantastic!) and flat-screen TV. Oh, and a HUGE comfortable bed. The hotel is ideally located for anything in the central Playa del Carmen area, including beaches. They now have two beach club options - Mamitas, which is v nice, and busy, and Zenzi, a newer more luxurious option. The daily breakfast was great, with a very wide choice, including the opportunity to try a few Mexican-style breakfasts. The hotel areas were always clean, and staff helpful. Our only "complaint" as such would be outside the hotel's control: if you are a light sleeper, you will hear music from a nearby nightclub at all hours, and during the day at the moment, there is some construction noise also. Neither were excessive, but you would be aware of it. A few recommendations from the Playa area and around: Restaurants: Oasis, Babes Bars: PicaPica, Deseo, Pousada Freud Activities: Xcaret, Tulum, Hidden Worlds

<Title>“THE place to stay in Playa”
<Content>La Tortuga is a fabulous hotel in Playa. We went for our honeymoon and definitely want to go back. The hotel is beautiful, the staff is so friendly, the rooms are clean and well designed. We highly recommend the rooftop jacuzzi rooms, they're perfect to come back to after a day at the beach. The location is ideal. Just one small block from all the restaurants and shops but still quiet at night if you want it. Their airport pick-up service is also very much worth the money. We got from the airport to the hotel and back without any worries. We HIGHLY recommend this hotel.

<Title>“A MELTING POT OF SO MANY GOOD THINGS....”
<Content>We just got back yesterday and I'm planning the next trip! First of all, we'd like to thank Anna, she's the BEST - and all the wait staff, Esteban, Danny, we miss you. Absoluely everyone at the hotel went above and beyond. Thank you all for all your hard work. Room: we had a room w/rooftop terrace w/jaccuzi. It was FAB. We stayed one night in a room we called outrtree house, then moved to the Sup. room. Either one would have been great. The comfort level is a 10! Noise: we felt a slight thump from the disco, but did NOT need earplugs, the AC helped and we had no problems falling asleep. Breakfast - and even Lunch once or twice: Mucho delish. Beaches: Both beach clubs were great. We went to Kool two days as well. Loved it. Food in town: HC (local, $), Aqua (excellent, $$$). La Famaglia (home make Italian pasta's $), Ristorante Italiano (EXCELLENT, $$). Make sure you head uptown to the "little italy" section. Throughout town, walk down the side streets, that's where you find the gems. OH and John Grays, very good, GREAT wine, can be expensive if you go to for the bottles - get a glass or two instead. We found may resturants in town to be very expensive (esp. for Mexico), so again, go off the beaten path, go local, you'll find great places. Hotel: I can't say enough. I will post pictures this weekend. It was a melting pot of people from all over the world. Hello to our friends in Seattle (we heard you got snow after you left!). Australia, France, South Beach and Dallas. Every day around the pool was heaven, just relaxing and chatting with people from all over the globe - you can't ask for more. I really would love to post negative things about LT, just to keep this little gem a secret, but in my heart I can't!! Thank you for a little slice of heaven, we'll be back soon... OHHH... one MAJOR suggestion. The wine list and storage. I'm thnking since you have such a global group that visits, some of us truly enjoy our vino! It needs to be stored correctly, the reds - not in the cold refrig and certainly not on the shelves - it gets too hot. This is what led us out to John Grays for our before dinner glass(es) of wine.

<Title>“Happy Birthday To Me!”
<Content>This hotel is gorgeous! The grounds are phenomenal and the location is perfect! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Our room was lovely, though the bathroom was a bit cramped. My husband and I stayed in swim-up room #108. We had easy access to the bar and pool table, not to mention the ease of going for a swim in the morning or dipping our feet in the pool in the evening. We had contemplated reserving a Jacuzzi suite instead of the swim-up room, but we were both thrilled that we decided on the swim-up room. No stairs, no hassle, everything at your fingertips. When we go back we’ll request the same room. We were in Playa del Carmen for 4 nights celebrating my 30th birthday and I wouldn’t have celebrated it any other way. I’m thrilled with the trip and Playa and look forward to going back! The front desk staff said April is the best time to come to Playa and September is good, too, if you don’t mind the possibility of an hurricane. We enjoyed Babe’s Noodle Bar for their garlic & black pepper shrimp (seriously, the best meal ever) and El Oasis for the fish tacos. We purchased a map of Playa del Carmen from http://www.mapchick.com/ before leaving and it was very helpful. We stayed away from Cozumel and the ferry area (nothing but cruise tourists and spring-breakers). However, after we left Playa we were told that Cozumel holds some great snorkeling, so we should’ve at least tried it. We got to Playa by taking the ADO bus from Terminal 2 at the Cancun airport. It was very easy! The ride only took about an hour. We took a colectivo from Playa to Tulum for a day trip to check out the ruins (about $3 US/pp). The ruins were okay but super crowded with tourists. The admission was under $5 US/pp, so very reasonable. The beach from the ruins was gorgeous but, again, super crowded with tourists and too small for the crowd. It was also a great deal warmer in Tulum than Playa.

<Title>“Absolutely stellar hotel, staff and location at the La Tortuga Hotel”
<Content>Just got back from 8 days at La Tortuga Hotel after my husband and I decided we couldn't face the dreariness and restraints of an all-inclusive. I was wowed by La Tortuga's reviews here, and simply have this to say: everything positive that has been written is correct. This hotel offers personalized, unparalleled customer service (from Anna at Customer Services, to Fernanda, Alfredo, Bernardo, even the waiters, bartenders and cleaning crew). The team booked our day tours for us (we recommend the Jungle Crossing but not the Sian K'aan one - when we explained to Fernanda what a bad experience we had on this tour - we were the first to take it -- she immediately took measures to correct the situation and went above and beyond the call of duty to help ease a bad situation and instantly agreed not to recommend it to any of their other visitors). They also suggested and reserved restaurants for us, helped my husband plan a suprise day of activities for me, and even bailed us out of a horrible situation when we lost our in-room safe key and needed it drilled open! They handled everything calmly, quickly and efficiently. The team take pride that they are number one in Playa, and they earn this accolade through hard work. We relaxed immediately (an incredibly easy hotel transfer to and from Cancun certainly helped), as did the welcome drink, and enjoyed the immaculately kept grounds, the brilliant lazy river pool (not a place for laps, but a nice cool respite from the heat), and the chilled out hotel atmosphere and slightly more upmarket clientele (no children!). We even made a few friends there! Yes, the rooms are smallish - but are you in Mexico to stay in your hotel room? No! We had a superior plus room that was kept sparkling clean by our maid (who left us with entertaining towel creatures every day!). It's not big, true, but had a huge, comfy bed, a nice bathroom/shower and a cute, private balcony overlooking the pool. What more do you need! (Although I did hear some people complain about the room size, it didn't bother me). The restaurant offered perhaps the best service we experienced in Playa and the meals were prepared fresh and with fine ingredients. Again, all the serving staff were friendly and very, very helpful. The breakfast was just right - and we were offered quite a nice choice of eggs, or croissant, and a hot and cold beverage. You can also top up if you pay a little bit extra and get a yummy fruit and yogurt plate or other extras. As for the "noise" of the nearby disco that some of have complained about, with the airconditioning on, we heard it maybe two nights out of the 8 and just put a pair of ear plugs in for a few hours. It really didn't both us too much. There was some early morning construction at a site next door, however, which was a bit irritating, but it was more fun to get up early anyway - and I usually prefer to sleep late! Would I go back? In a heartbeat. Highly, highly recommended. And all I can say to the Tortuga team is our heartfelt thanks for making our vacation truly special.

<Title>“Quaint Romantic Boutique Style Hotel”
<Content>We loved the hotel & agree with most of the good reviews that we found on this site. The hotel is small, but it feels even smaller. The hotel is situated a courtyard covered with beautifully maintained native foliage. A lazy river meanders through the courtyard with small waterfalls. It is very shady due to the large plantain trees & birds of paradise. We rarely saw other guests - usually only @ breakfast or @ the bar in the afternoon. Our room was a swim up room along the lazy river, in the back of the property, across the pool from the bar on the first floor. The courtyard is beautiful & our room was placed so that when you sat on out balcony, we were almost completely obscured by the foliage. So it made our balcony very private. However, there were a couple of drawbacks to that foliage that made our balcony so private & romantic..... First, we were woken a couple of times in the middle of the night by late night swimmers giggling as they hid in the foliage, after the pool was supposed to be closed. Also, b/c of the dense foliage stratgically placed around our room & consequently the portion of the lazy river that passed in front of our swim up room, the water in front of our room was very cold!! (It was February though....)So, it was hard to use our 'swim-up' feature that we paid for. However, if we enter the pool @ other areas of the lazy river, that were a little sunnier, the water was nice @ warm... I think it was just b/c our area was so shady & secluded that the sun was never allowed to warm up that section of the pool... Although I am sure that by April, all of the water in the lazy river is warm enough to use.... I'm not complaining... We aren't big swimmers, you just have to realize that if you get one thing, you may have to sacrifice another (seclusion, vs. warm water to dip into off of your balcony....) One thing that should be pointed out is that the rooms were VERY small ~ the pictures on the net make them look bigger than our room actually was. Literally, there was only 3 feet on either side of the bed to walk around. (I could tell b/c the floor was made of one foot saltillo tiles.) And we had a swim up room which is supposed to be bigger than the standard rooms. We did book our room @ the last minute & it was the last room available when we booked, so it is possible that we got the smallest room, but we got the most private, romantic balcony & a great location. Also, the hotel is a bit of a hike to the beach club that the hotel allows you to get into for free ~ Mamitas. So along your hike over to Mamitas, you pass 3 other beach clubs along the way! There hotel /beach club agreement should be with a closer beach club! It makes no sense!! Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I'd definitely stay again...even in the same room. Things to do ~ ~Rent a car & drive to the Coba ruins. ~Do a half day snorkle in the cenotes & zipline adventure with "alltournatives" adventure tours.

<Title>“Small beautiful cozy hotel with several local touches - Loved it!”
<Content>Because we don't like staying in a 300 rooms all-inclusive resort in Mexico, we discovered this beautiful small boutique hotel in the center of Playa Del Carmen. The location of the hotel is perfect; far away from the loud music decibels during the night and close to 5th Avenue & all major hotspots in Playa. The rooms are very clean and have all comfort that you require. During our stay, we changed rooms and realized that some bathrooms where re-furbished (both ok, just a different style). We certainly think that the staff is one of the biggest assets of this place; always a smile and a friendly greeting. They really try to please their guests as much they can. For the small story, I forgot my car keys at the hotel and they have sent it back to Belgium through UPS courier. Swimming Pool area is very cozy, even though very few sun beds are available. The Mamitas Beach is around 10 minutes walk from the hotel and as a guest of the hotel you receive free sun beds and umbrella. The co-operation with Mamitas was for me the only down side because this beach is used by several hotels and to have sun beds & umbrella you need to wake up at 7am. If you arrive later you can start looking for a palm tree to find some shadow. Nevertheless we spend an excellent holiday in La Tortuga and would like to recommend it to all travelers who like a small beautiful cozy hotel with several local touches. Thanks again to the entire staff of La Tortuga!!!

<Title>“Couldn't have asked for more!”
<Content>I just got back from staying at La Tortuga for 3 nights. I don't know what else I can add that the other reviews haven't already covered but it was wonderful! We stayed in a standard room because we were on a slight budget. The room was medium sized with a nice bathroom and a small balcony. It was very clean and the beds were extremely comfortable. I loved the shady pool area and it was a nice relief to be able to jump in the pool and get out of the sun after being at the beach all day. They have 2 beach clubs to choose from and we decided to head out to Mamitas. It is a bit of a walk (about 10 minutes) but we enjoyed walking through town to get there. We got there early to reserve a place in front (probably around 830) and while it was full around 10ish it didn't feel super busy or overly crowded. The breakfast that was included was very nice and they have a wide variety of choices including some vegetarian options which was perfect for me. The staff was very friendly and helped us pick out some good restaurants for dinner and would call to make reservations for us. if you do like to sleep in, I could see how this hotel might be a little noisy. We didn't hear any of the music from the club but that might have been because of where our room was situated. We did hear some noise from the street in the morning but that didn't happen to bother us since we are early risers. I would imagine though that the noise is a lot less than some other hotels who happen to be situated right on 5th ave or closer to it. Overall I was surprised with how developed Playa was but we really had a great time. Our stay at La Tortuga was one of the best we had in Mexico. I would definitely go back!

<Title>“Delightful in every way!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed the La Tortuga Hotel over Christmas while we were in Playa del Carmen, thankfully after staying at one of the big all inclusive style hotels. We were enchanted with the quiet, little, beautiful, boutique style hotel immediately!! The hotel has an amazing resturant, and the sundeck was one of our favorite places to hang out. They have done a wonderful job of blending everything to keep it cozy and romantic, with that small hotel feel. What a wonderful change from our previous all inclusive nightmare. This hotel was spotless, everything was so clean, and our housekeeper was so sweet. I think that was our favorite part of the hote, the people that work there, everyone, and I do mean everyone give you the best attention, and such wonderful, friendly, service it would be impossible to ever stay in an all inclusive large resort again. The reception desk are so helpful, and very professional. If they recommend a resturant, take there advice, they never steered us wrong. We plan to return to the LaTortuga, for the romantic atmosphere, the great food, their amazing spa, and most of all the wonderful staff that makes it all the better and ever so special. Can't wait to go back, hopefully....very soon!!

<Title>“La Tortuga is Top-Notch!”
<Content>We booked with La Tortuga because of all the great reviews from Trip Advisor. We were so glad we did! The hotel is exaclty what we were hoping for. The location is perfect, close to everything, very convenient! Quinta is right around the corner which has everything you need. The beach is a short walk, and it's easy to get to any transportation you need. The hotel amenities (pool, spa, restaurant, bar) are great! The free breakfast was very filling and delicious. Lots of options, and the service in the restaurant is very good. The pool area is very clean and the pool is constantly being swept by the staff. The hot tub is great after a long day of activities and a good place to meet other visitors. Our room was perfect! It was cozy and had everything we needed. We were on the top floor (3rd floor) and had a private rooftop deck with jacuzzi which was so great! The best part of the hotel is the customer service. The front desk was so helpful in everyway and it was such an easy check-in and check-out. It was my wife's birthday during our trip and they decorated our room on her birthday. We feel that they really went above and beyond. We would plan on staying here again when we go back to Playa. No wonder it's #1 on Trip Advisor...

<Title>“Noisy, Noisy, Noisy”
<Content>Recently returned from an 8-day stay in Playa del Carmen. This is a very touristy, party town with the beaches staying very crowded. La Tortuga Hotel is not "steps from the beach" but more like 5 blocks from the beach. Mamitas Beach is a private beach that is available to many hotels for free, which means you need to get there early to get a lounge chair, which are rows and rows and rows of people. We paid extra for the swim-up room. I probably wouldn't have used the pool had it not been right outside my room. The pool area is beautiful with many tropical trees, which means there was mostly shade around the pool. They have a rooftop area for sunbathing, which wasn't too appealing. The hotel staff was great, the complimentary breakfast was wonderful, the room clean. The room was very small, but the reason I am writing this is to warn future travelers about the noise. Recently, a nightclub opened up behind the hotel. We were awakened every night about midnight to the thump, thump, thump of nightclub music. It went on until at least 4 a.m. We complained to the hotel personnel, but they said their hands were tied. No offer of a room rate reduction or anything (we paid $220 per night). They did find me some earplugs, which helped, but I wouldn't spend that much money to have to wear earplugs to bed every night. Too bad, too, because this is a nice place. Oh, the other noise issue was the early morning grounds/pool cleaning crew. They chatted loudly at 7 a.m. When I'm on vacation, I really like to sleep in, but no go here. Hope this helps!

<Title>“Nice stay at La Tortuga”
<Content>My friend and I visited La Tortuga in March. We would rate this hotel a 3.5, but that was not an option. Honestly, we were expecting a bit more from the hotel, being that it is the number one rated hotel on TripAdvisor, but that said, we did have a nice stay. My friend has previously stayed at Playa Maya, and she said that she would choose that hotel again over this one, since it is right on the beach and she enjoyed her stay just as much, if not more. We stayed in one of the swim-up rooms, which was nice, but not worth the money in our opinion. We really never used the swim-up feature. The rooms are spacious. The beds are comfortable. The air conditioner was working very well. Actually, we think it was was a bit broken because it was just working so well that we were quite cold on the warmest setting. We were constantly turning it on and off during the night, which was a little bothersome. The bathroom is basic. There were a couple of little bugs in the bathroom, but I think that is sort of to be expected. We had an annoyance with our key cards. Almost every day we had to get them redone so that we could open our door. The setting of La Tortuga is lovely. Very peaceful and relaxing. The pool is not as much functional for swimming as it is pretty, but we still enjoyed going in. The staff collects leaves out of the pool throughout the day, which is nice. The jacuzzi/hot tub is also nice. There aren't many chairs to lounge on poolside, so if you want one, you should probably put your books and towels down early. We read that people love the solarium. It wasn't a draw to us, but some may like it. Having a computer at the bar with free internet access was a plus. The restaurant was pretty good. Breakfast was average. The lunch menu was small, but we ordered salads off the dinner menu and they were very good. We also had the shrimp cocktail, which was good. The staff at the restaurant and bar are very friendly. We especially liked Danny. At reception, Bernardo and Ferdananda were lovely. They were very warm and helpful. The next part, I am copying from another review b/c we felt the same way: "The beach: Two options --- Mamitas is very crowded and loud but fun party atmosphere. There's another beach option, but sometimes they accept the "coupons" you receive from the front desk every AM and sometimes they make you pay. I saw several people arguing with the staff there, although the nice beds with mattresses and more quiet atmosphere was more attractive to me than Mamitas." We felt the same as the other reviewer. The quieter beach, Zensi, had great beds/chairs. Some clarity between the hotel and beach club is needed, though, in terms of what La Tortuga guests are entitled to. Everyone seems to have their own opinion. Even the staff at the hotel had different takes on their "deal" with this beach club. We found, we either had to pay $5 each for our chairs of consume $15 each in food/beverage, and then the chairs would be free. The food is not good at the beach club and overpriced. I highly suggest you walk down the beach to Playa Maya and eat there. We had a great stay in Playa. We highly recommend the restaurant, Negrosal, for dinner. I had one of the best meals I have ever had. I am still dreaming about the ricotta and spinach ravioli and the filet mignon.

<Title>“Would go back again and again!”
<Content>I picked this hotel after reading other reviews on trip advisor. The reviewers were right. This is a lovely hotel! The staff was friendly and totally accomodating. Our room was very nice. I believe it was called a junior suite. The door opened onto a small private patio with an enclosed jacuzzi tub. You opened another set of french doors into the bedroom which had a king bed. The room had air conditioning that worked great and also a ceiling fan. The bathroom was large, all tiled and very nice. The hotel was sparkling clean. The pool grounds were beautiful with plenty of tropical foilage and an open patio and bar area. There is a restaurant off of the pool area. Your breakfast is included and not to be missed. It is a full breakfast, not continental, and the food was delicious! Had lunch there also which was very good. The hotel is only one short quiet block off the main Avenue (5th). The beach club you can use is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. It was nothing special but the beach and water is beautiful. Make sure you get there early (before 10 am or so) if you want to get a lounge chair near the water. We had the hotel arrange to pick us up and drive us back to the airport. It cost $98.00 total for 2 people roundtrip. If you catch a car from the airport it costs $80 one way! We will certainly be going back to this wonderful hotel again and again! ENJOY!

<Title>“Great location, good hotel”
<Content>The good: Property location can't be beat. Steps away from Fifth with every type of food or bar or shopping available. The fair: Room is decent. For the price in Mexico, I would have expected more. Booked a junior suite and the rooftop jacuzzi was very nice. The AC does not get very cold in the rooms however. Flat panel TV although I never turned it on. Bathroom not well designed with no place to put toiletries in the shower - you have to put everything on the floor and lean over to reach it. The service: Housekeeping is good, although you will have to ask for additional toiletries. Front desk is nice. Actively requests feedback. The beach: Two options --- Mamitas is very crowded and loud but fun party atmosphere. There's another beach option but sometimes they accept the "coupons" you receive from the front desk every AM and sometimes they make you pay. I saw several people arguing with the staff there, although the nice beds with mattresses and more quiet atmosphere was more attractive to me than Mamitas. I don't know if this hotel was much cheaper than others, but I would probably stay on the ocean next time.

<Title>“A Great Little Boutique Hotel”
<Content>This is a great little hotel with an equally great staff. La Tortuga made our stay in Playa the second week of March. We stayed in the swim up room #111 and then switched to # 302 which had a roof top Jacuzzi. We did not switch rooms because of a problem with the room, but we switched because we wanted to experience two types of rooms. I was surprised by the small size of our swim up room (111). For two people it’s a little tight, but you get used to it quickly because the mattress is worth it. I slept the best I had in four years on this mattress. Oh, how I wished I had that mattress. This room faces the pool since it’s a swim up room, so you may hear some people swimming in the morning, but I’m sure you could list worst things to wake up to. Room 302 with the rooftop Jacuzzi had so much room compared to 111. You have a private stair case up to the rooftop Jacuzzi and seating area. This was so nice I can’t begin to tell you. They provide spa robes, but if you want to be one with nature run up there in your birthday suit if you want. The shower is built for two, no bathtub. This room is extremely quiet. There were a couple of problems with the Jacuzzi, but were fixed immediately. I had made a special request for a birthday and all plans were executed beyond my expectations. Part of the birthday request was a Tres Leches cake (house cake). We liked it so much we wanted more of it two nights later, but they were out of it, but the waiter and chef offered to make a special trip that evening to go out and get another one since that don't make it in house. Twenty minutes later we had two more pieces of that delicious cake. To say they accommodate is an understatement. The complimentary breakfast that everyone writes about here is good, plentiful and filling and will carry you beyond the lunch hour. There’s not one bad pick on the menu for breakfast. I am NOT a coffee drinker, but their coffee was fantastic. So was their Mango/Cranberry juice! By now everyone knows this hotel is not on the beach, but after eating that breakfast everyday you are going to need that 15 minute walk to Mamita's. We only used the Mamita’s beach pass once. It was too crowded for our liking so we turned left on the beach and found a less populated area about five minutes away. No chairs, but more privacy. For even more privacy, we took the colectivo down to Akumal where the beaches are probably like what the Playa beaches were seven years ago. Palm trees for shade and more privacy. The collective is the way to go if you want to visit anywhere south of Playa. No matter what the distance, the cost is $2.20 (22 Pesos) it is so convenient and takes only twenty minutes. A taxi would have cost us $25 for two one way and $30 coming back. The walk from La Tortuga to the colectivo station is 10- 15 minutes, then the walk from the highway where the bus drops you off at Akumal beach is only 10 minutes. Tortuga’s pool area was so lovely to come back to after a day at the beach. There is the slight sound of waterfalls that lull you into a comatose state. The meandering river type pool doesn’t allow you to swim laps, but they do offer a water treadmill that allows you to swim in one place. There are different levels and steps in the pool that if you don’t watch it you can stub your toe. There is also a seating area above the restaurant that you can sit and watch the stars. For the small size of this hotel, they really utilize the space well. Every area of this hotel is smartly utilized and thoughtful. The location is great and away from the noise of 5th ave. I would highly recommend this hotel for the exceptional staff, location, service, pool, romance and relaxation.

<Title>“Very Unique”
<Content>Well I thought I should put my two cents in on this very unique hotel. First of all the service and friendliness is second to none. Everyone and I mean everyone treated my wife and I excellent. We stayed in a two floor suite with an upstairs outside veranda with a true two person jet tub. At night you could see the lights of Cozumel. We stayed the last week of Feb. through the first week of March. The second day at the hotel they put brand new mattresses on both beds up and down. The food was great along with the wait staff. La Tortuga is right in the middle of Playa. Only one block from the infamous 5th ave. 2 blocks from the beach. Bernado at the front desk has the inside line to what you need to know. Pictures on La Tortuga's website do far better justice than mine. But any ???'s I will be happy to answer. Yes I would go back here in a second!!!

<Title>“Fantastic, but....”
<Content>All the reviews for this hotel I agree with, and they are all great. La Tortuga is amazing: The service, the pool, the staff, the breakfasts. This you can get from all the other reviews. I will tell you some things that are not so great. The type of information I could not find easily before I booked. Location: La Tortuga is not on the beach. It is a 5 minute walk to the beach. And the 5 minute walk is to a beach that is not the best in Playa. Mamitas = Bad: La Tortuga has a partnership with a beach club called Mamitas that is on a great beach, but the walk is 10 to 15 minutes...not so easy to do with all your beach gear. Mamitas Beach Club is VERY crowded. Good luck getting a chair or an umbrella unless you want to get there before 9am to claim your spot. Dealing with hordes of people is not something I cam to Mexico for! You can however buy a bed type lounge chair if you buy a $150 bottle of booze! (is this Miami or Mexico?!?!) I had to walk way down the beach to find a spot, away from Mamitas. There were no umbrellas or shade. Not good for 5 hours in the Mexican sun with out shade! I ended up buying my own umbrella and gave up on Mamitas for the rest of my trip. Mamitas is a crowded disco on the beach, just like a club in Miami. Rooms: The rooms in La Tortuga are great, but since it was very booked, we could only get the Superior Junior suite. This was totally over kill since we spent little time in the room. Also, in our Junior Suite, rm 118, the sink, mirror, vanity etc. are NOT private and are part of the general room. If you like your privacy, this room is not so good. Only the toilet and shower are behind a closed door, with no mirror. We switched to s standard room, # 308 wich was a lot cheaper, and we liked it A LOT better. Was simple, had private bathroom, and just made more sense. Overall: This is in no way a bad review, just pointing out some things that are not so great. La Tortuga has amazing service, the friendliest staff and go out of their way to help you. Any problem is fixed immediately. Breakfast which is included, is fantastic. The pool is beautiful. The lounging areas are fantastic But, La Tortuga is more than we needed since we were doing day trips, scuba diving and sight seeing. I felt there was so much to La Tortuga that we did not get full use of like the pool, their bar, pool table, lounging areas. If I had to book again, I would take a hotel with a room right on the beach, with less to offer and let Mexican nature take care of the rest. Probably would be in Tulum though.

<Title>“Nice Little Hotel”
<Content>La Tortuga really is a fantastic little hotel. The pool area is a great oasis away from touristy 5th Ave, the room was quite quaint and cozy, the balcony was relaxing, the staff was fabulous and the daily breakfasts were awesome. It was terrific to be able to walk out the door and to be so close to 5th Ave with so many dining options. And few more blocks and you are at the beach. 5-10 walk from the bus station or the ferry dock. Its convenience is awesome. The welcoming decorations and bottle of champaign for our honeymoon was a pleasant surprise for my wife. I am on the fence with the hotel because as great as it was there were some problems. As others have noted, the neighboring disco music until 5AM was very aggravating. The weather was so beautiful that we wanted to sleep with the windows open. But, that was impossible with the music. Closed windows and turning on the AC is the trick for this. I know they are working on the problem but they should have acknowledged the problem when we booked the room. I didn't see any other rooms with open windows in the early morning. The bed was incredibly hard. However, they did replace it with a nice new bed half way through our stay. Mamitas Beach just didn't do a thing for me. I didn't go to the beach to fight for a spot on the beach. And that is the feel that I had during our stay. GET THERE EARLY! Overall, a great hotel that is diminished by a few nagging problems.

<Title>“La Tortuga Restored Our Faith . . .”
<Content>The room was somewhat small, but nicely done, and the large balcony (we were one-step above standard) doubled the living space and provided nice fresh air and views of 10th Av. The reception staff was very accommodating and friendly; they addressed me by name every time. The pool and lounge area are cozy and beautiful; instead of going to the beach, we just stayed there all day and the time just flew by. Perhaps the best part was the friendliness and good service of the restaurant, and the great quality of the food. La Tortuga provided the best part of our trip, from an otherwise disappointing experience with Playa del Carmen itsely.

<Title>“Beautiful, Tranquil & Convenient la Tortuga”
<Content>La Tortuga Hotel surpassed all of our expectations. The staff (who were friends by the end of the week) were phenomenal, the grounds were impecable, the rooms were spotless and inviting, rave reviews all around! Not to be forgotten, the Mayan Eggs at breakfast - unreal! La Tortuga's location was great, just steps away from Quinta (5th Ave.) but you never heard a hint of all of the activity from there once inside the grounds of the hotel. All you can hear are the birds in the palms, and the bubbling of the pools. The main concierge, Bernardo (Bernie), was a great help to us for anything we needed information on such as good local spots for dinner, things to do, etc. I can't wait to go back next year. There's so much to do in the area we still haven't covered everything in two separate trips!

<Title>“Wonderful hotel!”
<Content>We have just returned from 5 days in Playa del Carmen, staying at the wonderful La Tortuga Hotel. We booked La Tortuga because of the great reviews on this site and it did not disappoint. We stayed in a Junior Suite which was spacious, well laid out and had a very pleasant private balcony, where we sat for a drink each sunset. The best feature of the hotel is the beautiful swimming pool shaded by lots of trees, with the solarium area with its spacious sunbeds coming in a close second. We weren't so impressed with the very crowded and 'touristy' 5th Avenue, but we loved Mr Kiwi, a small open air cafe on 10th Avenue, where we frequently ate freshly grilled tostas and delicious juice smoothies. We would definitely return to La Tortuga.

<Title>“Love La Tortuga”
<Content>My husband and I have just returned from La Tortuga (2/22-2/27) and we loved it. I read a lot of reviews on Tripadvisor before selecting this hotel based on other reviews and photos. All of what you read is true! The staff is excellent and the hotel is spotless. I've never seen so many employees staying so busy all of the time making sure everything is in order. The location is also wonderful - every bar and restaurant you could want is within walking distance. We highly recommend Babe's Noodles - a great Thai place and also Dr. Taco for authentic tacos/burritos. You won't be disappointed in this hotel. I know we'll return as soon as we can.

<Title>“Magnífico!”
<Content>Just returned from sun'fun to snow n'shovel! Stayed at this lovely hotel Feb 17 thru 23rd and for two people that like to experience diffferent people, places and things...this place (as well as PDC) makes you want to turn into a repeat visitor again and again! Our last stay at PDC was our first in the "all-inclusive" realm (Playacar Palace) and although we had a great time and enjoyed the Palace and the "mindlessness" of an all-inclusive [and I mean that in a relaxing nice way :-) ] my heart is with La Toutuga and experiencing local flavors as the way to go. The location, staff and facility was excellent. As repeated on this site over and over - the staff are great. Friendly, communicative and very hard working. I have to tell you, some of them are working 12 plus hour days - and they continue to smile. Believe me, we travel a lot - and the little touches like making efforts to open doors for you going in and out, always saying "hello"; "how was your day?", smiling while they are sweeping (continually in the awesome pool area!), offering services and to help...all staff members were polite and engaging - but not intrusive. It's can be a fine line - and they draw it here well at La Toutuga. We stayed in Room 116; a superior junior suite. Spacious (sparse for furntiure - maybe one interior room chair in these rooms of great size? Just a small suggestion?). Few steps up to very large open room bath with huge tub/shower you could share with several of your closest friends. Large closet with many shelves/safe etc in this are also. Very adequate for storage. Rear door with private staircase to a rooftop jacuzzi with two large day beds - it was awesome to watch the recent lunar eclipse and stargaze at night! Certainly room in this rooftop for even a small table with chairs then you could eat, sleep and get clean under the sun and stars! Great covered patio with chairs and table and a hammock - we were right next to the restaurant outdoor seating (but enclosed by half wall and plants/solarium staircase etc) and it was still exceptionally quiet (as overall this entire hotel is). The room was immaculate - and kept that way. They have a stocked small refer, not any room to store anything - so we just took out the sodas and water to make room if we needed it (left in the beer so it wouldn't skunk). I realize any hotel doesn't want you stocking your own supply - but how can you pass up liters of Sol beer for 3USD across the street at the OXOX convenience store! They provide extra large bottles of water everyday - so we only bought a few extra for toothbrushing etc. Roof solarium was nice - we snoozed on those big beds too! Umbrellas and drink stands attached and they had no problem bringing drinks or lunch etc to you up there also since other guests took advantage of that. Pool area was wonderful, quiet and serene. Overall, this is certainly an adult hotel (no guests under 16 yrs) and the atmosphere is extremely relaxing. There is a treadmill section of the winding pool so you can swim/exercise against a current, and a six person hot tub in the middle. I'm an Atlantic coaster - so the pool temp was perfect - expecially after being under the hot sun. Loved the tropical plants, huge shade trees, bunches of bananas hanging from the trees, and the birds (hidden in the trees singing). At night...this area was beautifully lit - great views from your room or to walk to and from. Just a lovely atmoshere. Small bar next to a large sitting, reading, lounging area - shaded, very nice. Reasonable prices and guests enjoying happy hour in later afternoon (as we arrived after full days at the beach or day trips). The daily included breakfasts were good, plenty of choices. We had pancakes, omlets, eggs and ham - just ask - they made scrambed eggs upon one request after we got a spanish lesson and exchanged some hand signal descriptions (which is what's wonderful gertting to know people rather than just putting it on your plate from a buffet or impersonal restaurant). The waitstaff was very attentive and overall communicated very well. Believe me, they all speak great english compared to my pretty bad spanish - we both got better; smiles goes a long way. We never got to eat lunch or dinner at the Agora - although it looked good - so many restaurant choices to experience in PDC you need weeks! Just like, too many PDC happy hours in a day too! Rest assured comunication is very easy here in PDC, overall locals are very friendly and helpful. USD for everything - but ATM for pesos if needed (sometimes better on the outskirts of PDC area) is best way to go. For you coffee addicts - the coffee is good here at the hotel - but also go to Java Joe's on 12th (between 5th ave and 10th) the owners are from Jersey, then LA to PDC and very colorful to talk to. We met one morning there before we took off to Akumel for the day - and we started talking after we heard this very fluent spanish speaking (obviously) transplanted American say "caawfee" and I smiled to her and said "hey....now that's spanish I understand!" She was great to talk too about local stuff and gave you the local low down. Private transport arranged through the hotel via the airport went smooth. Private car that zipped us to and from (and with late arrivals and long days traveling it was worth every penny). They also arranged taxi to pick us up at the hotel and go to Akumel very early one AM - so that was just convenient (with equipment etc) and same price as walking and attempting to flag one for ourselves. Although know (really) taxis are everywhere, especially on 20th or toward Juarez (major roadways running up from beach area). Location was excellent, extremely safe, walkable to everything. XOXO conveinence across the street on 10th, Banamex Bank a block away (ATM), and walking along 10th (toward 20th and beyond) there are also good restaurants (Argentinian, local Mexican) and within that area (known as the Little Italy) toward the beach many other choices - if you want to explore other than the 5th Ave multitude of restaurant choices. Mamitas beach club (voucher for chairs and umbrella are part of your hotel stay) was great, not a far walk at all. Beach was beautiful, long stretch for nice walks. Suggest to just walk down 20 (Constitutients Ave) and go to end, takes a left at the beach and walk to Mamitas along the oceanfront - just another way for variety. Stop at Ah Cacao at the rotary (half way down 20th) - awesome chocolate shakes/brownies/chocolate anything! Mamitas gets crowded - go early (most umbrella taken by 8:30am!) so stake out the few palm trees if needed. (HINT: the cashier comes around near 10:30am (pay up time) so some people abandon the beachchairs anbd umbrellas after they have sunned for a few early morning hours for free...) Mamita's service is okay (can be wandering and slow to find) but...your on vacation remember....so every once in a while it's good to walk yourself to the bar (smirk). Food was pretty decent there (nachos, guac, quesadillas etc). Bartenders were nice guys and certainly provided better service than beach staff. Can't complain much - it's a beach bar! La Tortuga - for it's amenites included, staff, location, price and overall accomodations it's an excellent value and choice. It'll make you a repeat visitor with a new home away from home.

<Title>“Ditch the Hiltons, Sheratons, Carltons !”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at La Tortuga for 6 nights after reading all the positive reviews on trip advisor. Aside from the good reviews, we picked La Tortuga because it was in Playa del Carmen and it seemed more personal. We reserved one of the standard plus rooms on the second floor with a balcony. The room is clean and quiet with a spacious shower. We had no complaints about the room nor the service at La Tortuga. The service was personable and attentive. You are always greeted with smiles and staying there 6 nights allowed us to get to know the staff a bit more. We loved Alfredo who is immensly helpful and Esteban, who starts your day off right in the breakfast area. The staff had great recommendations for our tastebuds. We followed Alfredo and Anna's suggestion to go eat at certain non touristy restaurants. They were fantastic! A real culinary experience. The pools are great and the great layout of sunbeds and lazying around beds makes for a great slow day at the hotel. We highly recommend this hotel for people who are interested in less touristy accomodations, who dislike waking up in a generic hotel room and can't tell if they're in the hilton in japan or america.

<Content>I recently stayed at La Tortuga Hotel with my sister and had an amazing experience. The room is a good size for 2 people and is clean. The staff are extremely friendly. The service and food is excellent. The property is very cute and charming. The location is right in the heart of Playa del Carmen and not too far from the beach. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Playa. You will not be disappointed!!

<Title>“Exceptional Service - A Beautiful Property with a perfect location!”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel La Tortuga for a week to celebrate his birthday. The staff was aware that it was a special occasion and went out of their way to decorate our room with roses, balloons and a lovely card! We were completed blown away by the personalized service we received - we are both in the hosptiality industry and NOT easy to please by any means. The location of this hotel makes it so very convenient, literally a 2 minute walk to dozens of restaurants, shops and nightlife on 5th Street. We walked off delicious meals every night on the way back to the hotel...but did not retire before having a tasty slice of pizza at Cara Mamma just around the corner from La Tortuga (see photo). The grounds of the hotel are very comfortable with an understated type of relaxed, casual environment we were looking for. The staff called us by name and were exteremly helpful with everything from directions to explaining our bill. Check out the roof top lounge, perfect for afternoon sunbathing and relaxing. All in all, I must say that our stay at La Tortuga was the best experience I've have in Mexico, between Akumal, Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Puerto Penasco, etc. I am already trying to find a reason to return!

<Title>“It's Perfect!!!”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from a 7 night stay at La Tortuga. The experience leaves me almost speechless. It was perfect! We are a couple in our 30's with 3 children. We did quite a bit of research before we booked our trip. We wanted our vacation without children to be peaceful, relaxing and well...... perfect. La Tortuga provided just that. The grounds are beautiful, the staff is very professional and helpful and very knowledgable, the restaurant has excellent food. Mamitas was a nice walk from the hotel and we always managed to find chairs and shade. The beach club attracts all different kinds of people. It was fun to sit back and read my book, when I was tired of that watch people around me, when I was tired of that go for a swim. Then of course order drinks and food. What is better than a beer in Mexico on the beach? After a day at the beach La Tortuga was so nice to come back to. We can not wait to go back!! By the way, if you have a problem with something during your stay at La Tortuga, just tell them about it and they will do everything to fix it :)

<Title>“Best Ever Holiday for Sun, Service & Chilling out at the Hotel en Beach”
<Content>This is the best place in Playa!! The nice blue pool in the beautiful gardens are so nice and relaxing. The ambiance breathes vacation and the small bar with good, affordable wines and friendly service is perfect. In the morning you can enjoy a varied breakfast in de morning sunshine in the garden at the side of the pool. On a short walking distance thrue the pittoresque streets of playa you can easily find the beach whitm whom they made good arrangements for beds in the shades/or sun, as you wish. Not to forget the jacuzzi on the balcony overviewing the gardens enjoying a good glass of wine.... This is a must go for a nice, quiet, real holiday breathtaking little paradise in playa i stead of those massive tourist machines where you are treated as a number....

<Title>“VIva La Tortuga!!”
<Content>This was without question the finest vacation ever. I stayed in a "swim up" for 10 days and enjoyed myself throughly. The pool, while very different in size and shape from anything ever experienced, proved to be relaxing and a pure joy to walk into from my deck. The hotel is quiet, well located and the staff is EXCELLENT. I have nothing to criticize about the place. From the beginning to the end of our stay we loved it and planned to return.

<Title>“Good but not perfect”
<Content>Me and my husband went here for our honeymoon, because we wanted a small hotel close to the center. We read a lot on tripadvisor before we decided where to go. It was great, but not as good as it was hyped up to be. The staff seemed very clueless, apart from Alfredo the guy who carries bags and Pablo in the restaurant. The guys spent most early evening playing pool. I don't like going up to staff and interrupt a game so I just didn't play (and they charged you for playing!). I know it's not all-inclusive but pool should be free. I did like the bookshelf with books people left behind, I found a great Swedish book, that I put back when I was finished and my husband put the two books he had red during the holiday. We had booked a suite for the first night and everything was perfect in the room (we got the honeymoon package with sparkling wine, fruit and cheese). After that we stayed in a swim up room, I think we got the smallest one and we still got to pay the same amount as the people in the other swim up rooms (I presume), which is a bit unfair considering our room and balcony bit was half the size of everyone else (apart from our neighbours). The last night we had a standard plus room, which was very strange on two levels with two beds, no balcony - just strange. Make sure you don't stay in 214 unless you have kids with you (then it would be perfect). I love that you can have your breakfast whenever you wake up. And the fruit cocktails when you arrive. All in all, I like it. It's calm apart from the hotel bar music till 11pm and the disco next door. And unless you love the beach, don't go to the beach club. Useless, useless, useless.

<Title>“Paradise in Playa”
<Content>We visited Playa del Carmen for the first time in August 2007 and stayed at La Tortuga. We liked the hotel and Playa so much we went back in December 2007. Need I say more? :) In August we stayed in a junior suite which was very roomy and the view was spectacular! In December we thought we'd try the superior junior suite and it was definitely superior - the rooftop jacuzzi, sunning area and sitting area was like a little piece of paradise. The hotel has a lovely pool and jacuzzi with the bar a few steps away. How perfect is that? The hotel is very well maintained - everything is really clean and fresh. I could go on and on and this review would be pages long. Everyone (front desk, housekeeping, busy boys, waiters, reservations, etc.) was so accommodating and helpful. Service like that makes you feel so pampered. We had a wonderful relaxing vacation. By the way, if you want to check out the Mayan ruins, go snorkeling, go to the beach, parasailing, etc. - all of that is nearby. We look forward to staying at La Tortuga again the next time we visit Playa del Carmen.

<Title>“Same as what you read in trip advisor”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga for 5 nights. Really loved the hotel, service, free breakfast, cocktails, quiet beautiful surroundings. There were just two negatives, in my mind. We paid 200 for our room. It was miniscule. Had one king bed and the room was no bigger than the bed, no kidding. My husband and I couldn't even get past each other to walk in front of the bed. It was not a big deal - but if we could have gotten a larger room for just 31 bucks per night, we would have. I think I was a little annoyed reading previous notes on tripadvisor of constant upgrades at no cost. Nothing at all was offered, and when we inquired about a larger room for any night of the 5, they told us it would be an additional 31 bucks. Second, Mamitas was overcrowded, too public and the chairs were so uncomfortable. The walk was fine, it was a lousy beach club with lousy food. We paid each day 10 bucks to another nicer beach club which included padded chairs, an umbrella (or two if we wanted) and most important, clean bathrooms. Mamitas bathrooms were disgusting, people were changing in there constantly, so they were soaking wet. If we had not found another beach club to our liking, the vacation wouldn't have been as good. As it states on Tripadvisor, the hotel is exactly the way it seems, only a few lounge chairs, a tiny sun deck with no breeze obviously as this was not on the ocean/beach. But, you could get a chair if you wanted. We really loved La Tortuga for the beauty from the balcony and the peace and quiet.

<Title>“Delightful in all ways but one!”
<Content>We stayed at the very lovely La Tortuga Hotel the last week of January. Every positive comment in previous posts we found to be accurate. The small size (only 50 rooms), comfortable room, gracious staff, and beautiful outdoor lounge/pool area make this a real gem for the price. We had a problem with our toilet the first night but help arrived within five minutes of our phone call. The staff efficiently and happily took care of all of our needs. Unfortunately, we, too, experienced disrupted sleep from the disco down the street. We were in a third floor standard plus room and found the only way to quiet the thump, thump, thump of the music that began at midnight was to close our balcony doors and run the air conditioner. It really was too bad as it was the only black mark on an otherwise enjoyable stay. We will consider going back but maybe pack some ear plugs!

<Title>“lovely hotel but too noisy at night”
<Content>Spent 2 nights here in early January in a standard plus room. The hotel was very clean and more beautiful than expected. The grounds were lush with vegetation & there is a multi level lazy river curved around it. The view from the room balcony into the center courtyard was actually more private than expected due to the landscaping and trimming of the plants. The room we had was beautifully appointed. Had a problem with ants in the first room we got in but the attentive staff was more than gracious in moving us to another. The bed was clean & comfortable enough but the pillows were small. The free breakfast ordered off the menu was delicious. I had motuleños both days. For lunch or dinner, the Agora restaurant onsite had some great food too but don't remember exactly what we had. Liked the pool table downstairs near the bar to shoot a game or 2 while enjoying a happy hour drink. Only problem is this hotel is it's located too close to a relatively new disco. This isn't the hotel's fault since it was there before the disco opened, but there were the same pounding beats over & over all night till 4am weekdays & after 6am weekends, which left us both dragging. This left about 2 hours to try & sleep so I wouldn't fall face down in my breakfast. We couldn't wait to get out of there to our next destination to get some rest, and wouldn't recommend this hotel unless this disco closes or one plans to stay out all night.

<Title>“Absolutely Wonderful!”
<Content>Hotel La Tortuga was a perfect boutique hotel for our first trip to Playa Del Carmen. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. We reserved a Junior Suite with a rooftop jacuzzi (which was a jacuzzi tub) and loved it. The included breakfast is more than ample and the waitstaff was wonderful. As many have mentioned, the pool is gorgeous. We would spend our mornings at Mamita's and once it got busy, we would return to the hotel and relax poolside in the shade. There is an Oxo across the street, which was convenient for purchasing snacks and water. The hotel location is near perfect; just off of 5th but right in the middle of everything. We highly recommend this hotel, you will not regret it!

<Title>“Romantic Hotel”
<Content>The hotel was wonderful!!! It's a beautiful gem in the center of town. One block from Fifth Avenue where all the shops, restaurants and bands are located. The food at the restaurant was excellent - we ate there three out of five nights. The beach club is about a 15 minute walk which is fine because there is no erosion at that section of the beach. Try to get to the beach between 8:30 and 9:00 to reserve your chaise - fills up quickly. We are definitely returning next year.

<Title>“We come back again and again because....................”
<Content>My wife and I found the La Tortuga Hotel several years ago while we were in Playa staying at one of the big "mega" all inclusive style hotels. We fell in love with quiet, little, private, style hotel in an instant. We booked our next trip as soon as possible and have returned every year since. The hotel added several new rooms and remodeled the pool, resturant, and sunning deck since we started but it did a wonderful job of blending it all together to keep the original cozy, private, feel of everything. This hotel is and has always been spotless, everything is so clean, and so fresh it is amazing. But the true jewels are the people that work here, everyone, and I do mean everyone give you 100% attention, and such wonderful, friendly, service it would be impossible to ever stay anywhere else again when in Playa. And I would like to add that it looks like all of the same people still work here that did from years ago when we first came. I think that says a lot about the managment. The people at the front desk are the very best you could meet, so helpful, and so professional, and if they recommend a resturant take there advice, they have never been wrong. We will return year after year to the LaTortuga, for the romantic feel, the great food, and most of all the wonderful staff that makes it all so great.See you again in March this year! Mr & Mrs S.Fisher Illinois, USA PS I almost forgot, Try the Itza SPA while here, it is paradise within paradise .

<Title>“Fun Girls Trip”
<Content>The hotel was amazing! Very quiet and intimate. Perfect for honeymooners or just a casual vacation. We (two young female friends) had a blast. The staff was on top of everything from before we arrived making sure our ride from the airport was in place to cocktails upon our arrival to remembering our names and using them frequently ("Daniella, Jenni, Bienvenidos"). They made our trip worry free by helping plan some extra activities like snorkeling, and recommending fabulous Mayan cuisine. Highly Recommended.

<Title>“Lovely hotel, great staff, but nightly disco music kept us awake”
<Content>Our family of four (parents with two sons, ages 19 and 23) spent a week at La Tortuga between Christmas and New Years. We booked the hotel based on positive reviews. What we didn't know was the hotel is across the street from a disco that is licensed to stay open until 6:00 in the morning and sometime after midnight, the disco amps up the music which doesn't let up until closing. Our first night at the hotel with the windows open to take in the wonderful evening air, was a disaster. Out of the four of us, the only one that had a good night's rest was our 19 year old son, a college student use to dorm living. We learned to keep our windows shut and to turn up the air conditioner and keep the ceiling fan going to block out the ceaseless beat of loud disco music. At best, we were marginally successful as my husband and I are light sleepers. We spent much of the vacation exhausted. We were told by management that the hotel and other hotels nearby were aware of the problem and concerned as La Tortuga has been an established hotel for years and the disco has only been in the neighborhood for a year and the owners were trying to work out an arrangement with the local authorities and the disco owners. That said, the staff were sympathetic, kind and understanding. However, our vacation was a disaster from lack of a decent night's sleep for a week, all four of us counting the days until we could fly home.

<Title>“Extremely service-oriented property”
<Content>Echoing what fellow travelers have written before me, the service at this property was exceptional! All my email inquiries were responded to in record time - including last minute room and airport transport changes due to a cancelled flight. The front desk - Anna, in particular - helped me recover lost luggage promptly. In general, there seemed to be plenty of staff around, making sure the grounds were tidy and guests were happy. They seemed genuinely interested in their jobs. Finally, as a single woman traveler, I felt very safe at La Tortuga - close to the action on 5th Ave, but not too close.

<Title>“La Hotel Tortuga”
<Content>La Tortuga Hotel was an oasis from the crowded beaches & streets of lively Playa del Carmen. Conveniently, it is steps away from 5th ave. & despite its close proximity, i found the hotel to be very peaceful & quiet. There is a beautifully landscaped tropical courtyard intertwined with a refreshing swimming pool & relaxing hot tub. Just off the pool area is an inviting lounge with a bar, pool table, books, & games to keep you entertained. There is also internet access available. The bar tenders were very amicable. The hotel's restaurant is newly renovated & is one of the top restaurants that I dined at while in Playa. As for the rooms, many of them have private jacuzzi tubs either in the bathroom, on the balcony, or on the rooftop. Other's have spa like showers, and all modern fixtures, including hairdryers. The rooms have balconies and nice city views or courtyard/pool view rooms. Other amenities include airconditioning, wireless internet, cable television-many rooms w/ flat screen tvs-and most importantly, coffee and coffee makers with bottled water, and access to a mini bar. This hotel is an upscale hotel, well worth the rates, you might as well book a suite.

<Title>“This is Truly the #1 Hotel in Playa!”
<Content>We took a vacation with our extended family (mom, dad, kids and significant others). There were 8 of us (4 couples) in our group. We ranged in age from 21-50. We carefully planned our trip and kept detailed notes for this trip report. This is a very long report. You can just read the summary section or one of the other sections that seems of most interest. If you are a little crazy (like me) you can get our full trip report including more information and photos on La Tortuga, Playa del Carmen, Chitzen Itza, Ek Balam, Tulum, Coba and Xcaret at our website: http://www.danandjanean.com/Playa.html LA TORTUGA HOTEL SUMMARY. We stayed at the La Tortuga hotel 9 nights from December 15-24, 2007. This is a first class hotel that has earned and deserves the #1 rating on Trip Advisor. With all that La Tortuga has to offer, what really makes La Tortuga an outstanding hotel are the people. Every single person at the hotel is friendly, attentive and dedicated to guests. At the front desk, Anne Marie was always smiling and greeted us by name every time we came in or out of the hotel. She made suggestions for dining, trips, etc. Everyone greets and watches each guest to make sure everything is perfect for your whole trip. Alfredo the bell captain is a charmer. He is always laughing and joking and made us smile every day we were there. He interacts with all guests. Our dining servers added to the experience. With servers Daniel, Jose, Pablo, Luis, Micky and Santiago, we felt like we were with a group of close friends in their home. Dan now knows a new word – tocayo, which means a person with the same name – he learned it from his tocayo, Daniel. Dan also learned a few Mayan phrases from Santiago and others. At the bar, Fernando, Victor and Armando took great care of us. We learned several new Spanish expressions and how to make some of the specialty drinks at the bar. Overall, this is a world-class hotel delivering an exceptional experience for their guests. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. The hotel is just a few steps away from 5th Avenue with all its action. The street buzzes during almost all hours of the day and night. You can shop, sit and sip a drink, watch the crowds go by, enjoy the breezes off the Caribbean or participate in active bargaining with the local vendors. It is also just a few short blocks from the shores of the Caribbean. ARRIVAL. Arrival at La Tortuga was a joy. Anne Marie at the reception desk welcomed us and quickly checked us in. Everyone in our party was presented a free welcome drink in the reception area. We arrived a little earlier than expected. We had booked 4 standard rooms for 9 nights. We discovered first-hand why La Tortuga is rated #1 by guests on Trip Advisor. We also learned that they are not sitting back happy just to be the best – they are continually improving their property (more on this later). Our standard rooms had just been repainted and Anne Marie was concerned about the fumes, so she immediately offered us upgraded rooms for our first night at no additional cost. We were given 4 junior suites – one a superior junior suite. Our rooms on the first night were 101, 304, 305 and 306. There is more on the rooms in a section below. GARDENS & GROUNDS. The hotel property and grounds are more beautiful in person than they are in the photos. The hotel property is shady with numerous cozy sitting and lounging areas. It is serene, quiet and peaceful. The grounds are immaculate and the tropical gardens are meticulously maintained. TIP: Find the solarium patio. It is an open air public patio just above the bar. You’ll find padded lounge beds with drink trays and tables and chairs. It is wonderful at night. They will serve your drinks and meals in this area if you ask. HOT TUB & POOL. There is a hot tub large enough for about 8 people. The hot tub is surrounded by a unique swimming pool. The water in the pool was ambient temperature. It was refreshing during the hot afternoon, but a little chilly in the early morning and in the evening. We enjoyed the hot tub in the cooler evenings and the pool when we needed a refreshing dip. BAR AREA. Every hour at La Tortuga was a happy hour. The official happy hour at the bar is from 5-6 PM with 2-1 drinks. Our buddies at the bar – Fernando, Victor and Armando stretched that hour beyond its limits several times and kept our drinks flowing at happy prices. We learned about several local specialty drinks including the Yucatan. They also carefully followed our instructions when we asked for a drink to be prepared in our customary way. There is free internet access at the bar. The maximum time per guest is 30 minutes so the computer is always accessible, sometimes with a short wait. Other guests were always considerate when someone was waiting – I think the friendly spirit at La Tortuga rubs off on everyone. There is a pool table that costs 5 pesos (50 cents) per game. The charge is a great idea because it is inexpensive, but you can usually get a game in without waiting or after a short wait. AGORA RESTAURANT. La Tortuga isn’t sitting back now that they have achieved the #1 rating on Trip Advisor. They are making systematic, continual improvements to the rooms and the hotel. They have just completed a full remodel of the Agora restaurant. The remodel project was completed during the last few days of our stay. The newly refurbished Agora now features new tile flooring, a new bar/serving area, new ceilings and new décor. They were nearing completion of the new front enclosure and full AC system for the restaurant when we left. BREAKFAST INCLUDED. Free full breakfast is included with all rooms at La Tortuga. The free breakfast includes the breakfast entrée, juice and coffee or tea. If you order a soft drink or extras, there is a small added charge. There are multiple breakfast options including huevos rancheros, omelets, fresh fruits & breads, yogurt, baguette sandwiches, quesadillas, cheese plate, eggs any style and specialty dishes. The specialty dishes we tried were sincronizadas (ham & cheese quesadillas with beans & guacamole), motuleños (2 eggs sunny side up on corn tortillas with black beans, tomato salsa, ham, cheese, potatoes and fried platanos), chilaquiles (fried tortillas topped with tomato salsa, eggs, beans, onions and potatoes) and tasty and the servers again were warm, friendly and personal in the way they treated us. The coffee is perfect – strong without any bitterness. There are also a variety of fresh and flavorful juices. DINNER. We also ate dinner several times in the newly refinished Agora restaurant. They gave us a 20% discount for every dinner and the food is delicious. The 20% discount is not available during the high winter season at the Agora. The favorite entrees for our group were the pasta Carbonara and the Chicken Cordon Bleu (mmmmmm….). SERVERS. Our servers at La Tortuga made breakfast an experience. We felt like we were with a group of close friend in their home. Our servers were Daniel, Jose, Pablo, Luis, Micky and Santiago. ROOMS. There are 51 rooms at La Tortuga. Our group of 4 couples stayed in 11 different rooms during our 9 nights. We were happy with all rooms and only changed rooms because Anne Marie and Laura graciously offered upgrades at no additional cost. It was also nice because we are travel agents and we were able to see more of the rooms at the property. On the first night, Anne Marie upgraded us to 4 junior suites at no charge because our standard rooms had just been painted. She was concerned that the fumes would bother us. We spent the 2nd night in our standard rooms. For nights 3-7, Laura generously upgraded us to the other available rooms at no extra cost. We had 4 rooms for 9 nights – a total of 36 “room nights”. These are the rooms we were in: 101 - Superior Junior suite (8 nights) 219 - Superior Junior suite (7 nights) 201 - Junior suite (7 nights) 303 - Standard Plus (7 nights) 304 – Junior suite (1 night) 305 – Junior suite (1 night) 306 – Junior suite (1 night) 22 - Standard room with small balcony (1 night) 23 - Standard room with small balcony (1 night) 24 - Standard room with small balcony (1 night) 25 - Standard room with small balcony (1night) All rooms at La Tortuga are wonderful. Every room comes with AC, TV, telephone, alarm clock, ceiling fan, mini bar, in-room safe, coffee machine and hair dryer. Most TVs have now been upgraded to flat screen. We watched a little TV during downtimes (and while waiting for significant others to make themselves adorable before leaving the room). We didn’t count the channels, but there are quite a few channels available in both English and Spanish. Spanish stations are generally dubbed in English or have English subtitles. The safes are about the size of a toaster oven – large enough for wallets, cameras, jewelry, small purses, etc. Laptops and larger video cameras will not fit in the safes. There is no deposit for the safe key, but there is a charge if you lose the key. DISCO NOISE. We have read online complaints about disco noise at La Tortuga at night. When we tried really hard from our deck or with our windows open, we could hear the disco music. Our group of 8 stayed in 10 different rooms at La Tortuga and the disco music didn’t interfere with anyone’s sleep on any night of our stay. Even the most sound-sensitive sleeper would need is a cheap pair of foam ear plugs at night. If you are worried, bring the ear plugs – everything else makes this hotel worth the stay! STANDARD ROOM. There are 12 standard rooms at La Tortuga. Of those, 4 include a small balcony with a table and 2 chairs. Our group spent 1 night in the 4 standard rooms 22, 23, 24 and 25. These rooms are very nice. All four rooms had very small private balconies. The balcony in room 25 had the nicest view of the grounds. Room 22 had both a queen bed and a single bed. There is a small private patio area with table and chairs serving just these 4 rooms. Our group of 8 enjoyed our “private spot” for the 1 night we stayed in these rooms. All these rooms had queen size beds. Three had new flat panel TVs. All included the standard amenities listed above. We had plenty of closet space and drawer space for our 9-night stay. We have read some reviews on Trip Advisor with complaints about lack of space in the rooms at La Tortuga, but we do not share that opinion. All rooms we stayed in, including these standard rooms were very comfortable, recently refurbished and well-worth the low standard room price. The standard rooms are a wonderful option if you are on a tight travel budget and still want to experience the #1 hotel in Playa del Carmen. You’ll still enjoy this prime location, the outstanding service and enjoy most of the same amenities STANDARD ROOM PLUS. There are 22 rooms in this category. These rooms are larger than the standard rooms and offer better balcony options. One couple in our group spent 7 nights in room 303 which is in this category. The room is larger than a standard room and has a very nice balcony with a great view. SWIM UP ROOMS. There are 5 swim up rooms at La Tortuga. These rooms are the same size as the standard plus rooms. They are on the ground floor and have direct access to the pool from the balcony. We did not stay in one of these rooms, but they looked like fun. JUNIOR SUITE. There are 10 unique junior suites. All include a VERY LARGE Jacuzzi tub, a private terrace or deck, bathrobe and slippers. Some Jacuzzis are in a private roof-top terrace and others are in the room, in the bathroom or on the balcony. Our group spent a total of 10 nights in 4 different rooms in this category – rooms 201, 304, 305 and 306. These suites are spacious and luxurious. If you want to enjoy a private Jacuzzi for 2 under the stars, ask for one of the junior suites on the third floor. SUPERIOR JUNIOR SUITE. There are unique 7 superior suites. All include the VERY LARGE Jacuzzi tub and INCREDIBLY COMFORTABLE Spring Air King beds. Other options include a small private pool, a private balcony, a private lounge mattress or hammock or an in-room sofa. We can safely say that “YES! There is a SOFT, LUXURIOUS bed in Mexico. If you love a top-end bed, this is the room you want. Guests in this category can choose to have their free breakfast served right in their room. You can also choose to have dinner service provided in these rooms. Our group spent 15 nights in 2 rooms in this category – 101 and 219. Suite 101 is ground-level, includes an in-room Jacuzzi with an access door from the Jacuzzi to the private pool and the wonderfully comfortable king bed. Suite 219 is on the 2nd level, has the in-room Jacuzzi a sofa in the room and a large private balcony with a table and 2 chairs looking down onto the beautiful interior patio and grounds. If you want to splurge at the #1 hotel in Playa del Carmen, reserve the superior junior suite. You will be amazed with the incredibly comfortable king bed and other amenities in these amazing rooms. OTHER HOTELS IN PLAYA. We have previously stayed in Playa del Carmen at the Shangri La hotel, another top-rated hotel on Trip Advisor. We loved that hotel and location on the beach, but their service is well-below the service we received at La Tortuga. We booked this trip 10 months in advance. We had originally planned to stay at Luna Blue Hotel & Garden, which at the time carried a higher Trip Advisor rating than La Tortuga. We read a few snippety comments from the Luna Blue management on Trip Advisor which concerned us. Luna Blue also started their holiday season rates earlier than La Tortuga. We were actually able to book La Tortuga for about the same price as that offered by Luna Blue. On this trip, we took a walk to Luna Blue and looked around the gardens and hotel. From our observations, La Tortuga is in a category well-above Luna Blue. If you are comparing these hotels, or any other hotel in Playa del Carmen, do yourself a favor and run to La Tortuga. If you book anywhere else, you are doing yourself a disservice. 5th AVENUE & THE BEACH. La Tortuga is a just a few blocks from the beach and a short block off Quinta Avenida. At anytime of the day, you can get your favorite drink at a bar or restaurant, buy a snack or a beer for about a buck at a store, have a patio or restaurant dining experience or shop for an endless variety of artwork and souvenirs. This is where the action is. You can shop, sit and sip a drink, watch the crowds go by, enjoy the breezes off the Caribbean or participate in some dickering with the local vendors. Many restaurants offer 2-1 margaritas and $1 beer to attract patrons. Playa del Carmen is the perfect size for us. It is big enough to offer fun, varied activities, shopping and great restaurants. It is small enough that it still has an authentic local feel. TIP: Get up early and see the Caribbean sunrise. The view is incredible! PIZZA. The best place to grab pizza almost anytime: Express Mandarina’s which is only about 100 yards from La Tortuga. Head to 5th Avenue, hang a left going north and you’ll spot them on your right (beach side of the street) right in the dip in the road. For 50 pesos (5 bucks) you get 2 huge slices of pizza and a beer or soft drink. SEAFOOD. The best place for seafood: The Blue Lobster which is just a few hundred yards from La Tortuga on the corner of 5th Avenue and Calle 12. Our favorites were the shrimp. We loved the coconut shrimp, garlic shrimp and shrimp appetizer. The portions are very large, the lobster and shrimp are exquisite and the prices are good. They also serve a huge refreshing jumbo iced tea if you have had too much tequila. And they have really cool Blue Lobster t-shirts for $12. MARGARITAS. The best sidewalk deal for margaritas and/or a meal. Karen’s Café on 5th Avenue between 2nd and 4th north on the west side of 5th Avenue. You can get 2-1 margaritas almost ALL the time. If they take longer than expected, they throw in more free margaritas. Be careful here! We had to stagger back to our rooms after a lunch with all the margaritas. Their arrachero beef tacos are great. They also have wonderful live Peruvian music. CANCUN AIRPORT. On December 15, 2007 we arrived at the Cancun airport at 3:30 PM. The immigration counters and waiting area have been updated since our last trip in 2006. There are now restrooms easily accessible in the waiting area. There were 8 active counters when we arrived. It took us about 30 minutes to get through immigration. The wait for our luggage was quite long. There were 4 flights which arrived at about the same time. The luggage for all 4 flights was placed on the same conveyer while at least 2 other conveyers sat unused. Our luggage didn’t make it to us until about 1 hour after we landed. Once we had our luggage, we quickly cleared customs and made our way through the time-share vendors to the outside of the airport. Our flight out on December 24 was uneventful – we just didn’t want to go! GROUND TRANSPORTATION. We reserved our airport transfers online at www.entertainment-plus.net/tour_transport.cfm with USA Transfers. This was the best price we found for our group of 8 for round-trip to Playa del Carmen. The cost was $115 round-trip for all of us. We paid cash $85 US to the driver at the Cancun airport and the $30 US balance to the driver on the return trip. We also tipped each driver $15-20 each trip for their help with our 12+ bags. The USA Transfer service is excellent. Everything worked for us exactly as promised. Brant Boston sent us a separate confirmation email for each leg of the transfer with very clear instructions. He also sent us a reminder email 2 days before we left home confirming the dates of arrival, flight information and hotel information. Their driver met us outside the airport with a large sign clearly displaying our name. It was a quick, efficient and professional routine at the airport. If you have ever had ground transportation hassles at the airport, you know how much that peace of mind is worth. We highly recommend USA Transfers for transportation between the Cancun airport and the Riviera Maya locations. USA Transfers offers private tours and transportation around the Riviera Maya locations. Their prices are most competitive if you are based in Cancun. TIP: Stash some US currency in your wallet or suitcase for use on the return trip. You’ll do well using your ATM card to get pesos for expenses while travelling in Mexico, but you’ll want some US dollars for the return trip. USA Transfers accepts pesos, but their price is best with US dollars. Also, you’ll want some US dollars for the return flight, airport purchases in the US and parking fees/tips on your return trip. TIP: Carry your hotel address and phone number with you when your fly out. It will help assure that the driver knows exactly where you are staying. Many hotels have similar names in the Maya Riviera. Even with the longer than expected wait for our luggage, we were out of the Cancun airport in about 90 minutes. Our USA Transfer driver took us to our hotel quickly and safely. The trip from the Cancun airport to Hotel La Tortuga in Playa del Carmen was about 45 minutes. PRIVATE VAN & TOUR. The best deal we found for our day trips to Chitzen Itza, Ek Balam, Tulum and Coba was through Playa.Info located right in Playa del Carmen. We paid about $300 per trip plus tip for van and driver Raez for 2 - 12 hour per day trips the Mayan sites. We didn’t count the seats – we think it was a 15 passenger van, but it had plenty of room for our group of 8. The van was brand new and very comfortable. Raez was prompt, safe, spoke English well and very informative. He even accompanied us on our bike tour of the Coba ruins. Their website is: //www.playa.info/

<Title>“La Tortuga Dec. 2007”
<Content>I stayed at La Tortuga for 10 nights with my husband and my family. La Tortuga Our first night was fantastic. We arrived after a long flight and then the drive from Cancun. Apon arrival, they immediately brought us delicious fruit drinks to welcome us. The small, friendly atmosphere was very inviting and relaxing. Before heading to our rooms, we enjoyed a few minutes out by the pool-which didnt have another soul in or near it. They brought us drink menus and made us feel very welcome. Since we had arrived hours earlier than was originally planned, the hotel was not quite ready with our rooms. Instead, they upgraded us to junior suites for the night. Room 304 My husbands and my room was very comfortable. We had a king size bed, flat screen TV, refrigerator, personal safe, AC, ceiling fan, and a beautiful bathroom with double sinks and very large shower. To top all of that off, we had a rooftop jacuzzi. Our cute little balcony had a spiral staircase up to the private area on the roof with two couches and a large jacuzzi. As hard as we tried (climbing on the couches, looking over walls) we were not able to see any other private areas on the roof. The jacuzzi did take a while to fill up, but that just gave us more time to enjoy the beautiful view of a church steeple and the people below-dont worry, they can't see you. Except for the bar and resteraunt, we were able to stay out in the pool or hot tub as long as we liked. During the entire trip, I felt like we had the place all to ourselves. With it being such a small hotel, there were not many guests which made our stall all the more peaceful. Room 23 The next night we were moved from our upgraded suite to our standard room. The staff was very helpful in moving our luggage (as they were the first night) to the new room. The standard room was smaller and obviously didnt include the rooftop jacuzzi, but still very cozy. We had a nice full size bed, refrigerator, personal safe, AC, and ceiling fan. Our standard room did have a balcony, but was overgrown and did'nt provide much of a view. Room 101 The next day, we were informed that due to the construction below us (they were expanding their resteraunt) they were upgrading us again to suites for the remainder of our stay. I was surprised by the move since I had not even noticed the construction. Our new room was very nice, much like the first suite we had, but it was ground level. Instead of the rooftop jacuzzi, we had our own private swimming pool. We did have a jacuzzi in our bathroom that also worked as our shower. This room also came with all the amenities as the others. Our air conditioning in the room was not cooperating (although it could have been the user...) but the staff was very helpful and very prompt in solving our problem. The Resteraunt The restraunt was wonderful. We were served a free breakfast every morning, which included one plate, one juice, and one coffee. I personally preferred their pancakes to the many breakfast options. It included 3 cakes, a whole bananna, one strawberry, and one grape. My husband preferred the quesadillas. For Dinner I had their Chicken Cordon Bleu. I would recommend this plate to anyone and everyone. It was by far the most delicous Cordon Bleu I have ever had. The staff was amazing. They were there whenever you needed them, the majority of them spoke English very well, and were very professional. The Bar Even though it was a small bar, they were very capable of making any kind of drink you requested. I tried their mojitto, Long Island Iced tea, Taquilla sunrise, and strawberry daiquiri. My personal favorite was the Daiquiri. The area La tortuga was conviently located near "5th Ave." This Ave is just for walking-no cars allowed. It has every kind of shopping you could need, even groceries. If you're looking for souveniers, the best place for prices are the larger stores. The only problem is that you're not able to bargain with the sellers. The small shops really want to sell you their products so their always willing to lower their prices to make a deal with you. La Tortuga is also close to the beach. If you want to lounge on chairs, you have to get a pass from the hotel and go to Mamitas which is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. If all you want to do is walk along the beach or go swimming, you can head to any beach around. All in all, my stay at La Tortuga was a excellent experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone in the Playa Del Carmen area and would return in a heart beat. I would like to thank La Tortuga staff for making my stay a wonderful experience.

<Title>“Encore Performance by La Tortuga and Staff”
<Content>The bottom line at this hotel is whatever you need (or want), they will do their very best to accommodate. This was my second stay at La Tortuga this year (see review from May) with the first being just the guys. This time it was two couples and yet again, La Tortuga delivered. Booked and paid for the rooms over 90 days in advance, earning a 20% prepay discount. Jessica and Anna, as always, were great about responding to emails or phone calls and arranged for airport transportation, a fishing trip, a golf outing, and spa appointments weeks prior to our arrival. Bernardo at the front desk arranged for a short-notice (same day) private driver and car to Tulum for an afternoon. We had an A/C unit go out in our room after our first night and were complimentary upgraded to one of their best suites for our remaining three nights. Though the restaurant was undergoing some renovation, I think enclosing part so it would be air conditioned, they remained open for full service and the included breakfast each morning was always a great meal. Can't recommend this hotel and its service-oriented staff strongly enough -- we will return to this hotel any time we're lucky enough to visit Playa in the future.

<Title>“None better”
<Content>We had originally booked 5 days at an all inclusive resort at Playa and then we read the reviews from Tripadvisor and cancelled the reservation. Tripadvisor listed La Tortuga as one of the 5 most highly rated and the comments listed made it seem like the right match for us. The hotel was outstanding, 31 rooms tucked around an amazing 'lobby' comprised of palm trees and a winding pool river with small bridges and lounges. The service was some of the best we have ever encountered- everyone was friendly, responsive and seemed to be enjoying themselves making other people happy. I think ours was the best room, 101, a junior suite with our own pool and private garden with a large chaise and private cocktail table and 2 chairs. The included breakfast was offered from a menu of delightful choices which ranged from typical Mexican to fruit plates to pancakes, great assortment of juices- mango/cranberry was my favorite. We ate dinner twice at the hotel, the food was excellent and again a nice range of choices. La Tortuga is on 10 avenue, surrounded by shops and hundreds of restaurants within a block or two. Felt very safe- no issues walking around at night. Two blocks down is the infamous 5th avenue, blocked off from cars and a stroll at any time of day or night will result in offers for tours to cuban cigars to gold jewelry. Definately for the tourists, tons of bars and night life, fun to see, felt like a carnival. The hotel belongs to a beach club which provides 2 lounge chairs and a thatched unbrella. The beach it self is breath taking- the sand is from ground up coral so it is not hot to walk on and the water is perfect temperature and crystal clear. No snorkeling- have to take the ferry to Cozumel for that, which is a great day trip. If you plan on the beach go early, it tends to get crowded as the day progresses. There are also free beaches near where the ferry comes in. It is all the same water. No problem with the water or ice, they use filtered, so did not even worry about brushing my teeth. Fell in love with Margarettas, ( with no sugar!!) and the bar tenders quickly remember what you drink and how you like it. Met lots of friendly people, from all over the world: Holland, Canada, Korea and of course the US. There were families, honey moon couples, single folks, nice variety and it was fun to see folks in the morning, and then around the pool in the pm to share adventures. You do not need a car- transportation is easy from Cancun airport- there is a shuttle for $24 a person or a private cab for 4 is $82, but with limited baggage space. It is easy to rent a vechicle for a day to venture out to the Mayan ruins , cenotes, snorkeling, etc. which is what we did. Driving was certainly an adventure- there a lots of small and large excursions to take if you don't want to drive. The hotel can make any arrangement s for you. If you go to La Tortuga look forward to the towels each day. I recommended the hotel to my girlfriend for her honeymoon and she is going. We will definately be back next year.

<Title>“An Awesome Boutique hotel with a European Feel!”
<Content>I had several friends refer this hotel to me, and then after checking on Tripadvisor, I was surprised at all the great reviews but somewhat skeptical. Let me tell you, it was a wonderful experience! The rooms themselves were not spectacularly appointed or super large, but it's probably the grounds themselves (they are beautifully kept and landscaped) and the absolute friendliness and personalties of the staff that make this boutique hotel so wonderful and charming. I'm not one for all-inclusives, and when I travel for pleasure, I'd rather have something unique with personality, rather than the typical large chain hotel. So if you are expecting the amenities and rooms that you may find at a Westin, for example, this is probably not the place for you. But if you like charming, unique properties with their own personality, you must stay at La Tortuga! First of all, all of the hotel rooms are on the exterior of the property, and surround a large, lushly landscaped courtyard with a pool, swimming lanes, and outside dining and a bar. We booked a swim up room, and off our little balcony on the first floor, we could enter the pool and get to any of the little areas. They are absolutely meticulous at caring for their landscaping; every morning the gardeners were skimming the pool areas for stray leaves and such. The grounds are beautiful and romantic in the evening, lit up with candles and torches and Christmas lights. We enjoyed several evenings having a cocktail while sitting on the comfortable couch seating around the grounds. The staff is phenomenal; they greet you with a smile and a salutation every time they see you; you really feel that they appreciate you as a client. After visiting several other areas in Cancun and Isla Mujeres, I felt that the service at this hotel was exceptional and genuine; as I did not get they same level of service at other places. The wait staff will come and talk to you if they have a free moment, and it was fun practicing my Spanish skills with the waiters and bartenders as they practiced their English skills with me. And the hotel concierges were extremely helpful with information and guidance. Playa itself is wonderful; not too much of a party town, like Cancun, but more laid back and classier. Cancun reminds me of a cheap Vegas hotel strip; Playa seems like an upscale European town. They have a great selection of restaurants and bars to choose from. One hint: from the ocean to tenth street is the plaza area, really aimed at tourists; wander outside of this area and it's not as pretty and a little more rougher. I really did not feel that we were that far from Mamita's beach club; it is somewhat of a walk, but we actually enjoyed the exercise getting to the beach. We never had a problem getting chairs at Mamita's either. One problem which is unfortunately not La Tortuga's fault: there is a disco a couple of blocks away that is open until 5am every night, and when it starts to get quiet at the hotel after midnight, you can hear the pounding music as if it's right in the hotel. This led to many sleepless nights. However, I can't say that it would be much different at other places, as many of the other guests commented on having this same experience at other hotels both in Playa and in other cities in Mexico. Quite honestly, as I'm on vacation, this would not stop me from staying at La Tortuga again; I loved this place so much!

<Title>“No Hotel like La Tortuga”
<Content>At last I have experienced this wonderful hotel recommended by so many travellers to PDC. My stay was from Nov.27 to Dec..6, 2007, and I wish I could have stayed longer. I can't say enough about the wonderful staff from the front desk , the bell boys to the waiters. So very personal with genuine smiles and a true desire to do anything they can to make your stay a happy one. My first room was standard, on the second floor, Small,yes, but very comfortable with a comfortable bed and the best pillows I have slept on. Small balcony looked out on the pool and gardens. I am handicapped and walk with a cane and every time I went up or down there was always someone there to offer help or just to watch over me. Next day I was transferred to a swim up room on the first floor with a lovely terrace and steps into the beautiful pool. I made good use of the terrace with lots of room service, always served with one of those great smiles. There are two dining areas; one in front, open to 10th Ave., and a beautiful outdoor area beside the pool. Lovely in the daytime but especially at night when the pool lights are on and lights in the trees. The food is good and especially the breakfasts which are included in the room rate. This is no Holiday Inn but a very special hotel hotel with a very special staff. I will return.

<Title>“A lovely hotel”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga for 10 nights in November 2007. It is a genuinely lovely hotel and although it does not look like much from the street, once you walk in the main pool/bar area is stunning and feels like a little oasis - it's particularly nice in the evening when it is all lit up. Our room was simple, but very nice. Everywhere in the hotel was always immaculate. The staff were friendly and the breakfasts and 2for1 cocktails were great. It's a good location, and we did not mind the short walk to the beach. It was great to be able to use Mamitas, although it did get busy at times. We would thoroughly recommend this hotel and the resort of Playa del Carmen.

<Content>We've stayed at this hotel on two other occasions. Its location is great, as you can walk to everything. Give up your all-inclusive urges and go local. The hotel is within walking distance to everything, well maintained and very clean. I suggest the swim out rooms.

<Title>“Loved the Turtle”
<Content>Wow! Everything met our expectations. This is such a nice place, one block off of Quinta Ave. Upon arriving we were greeted by a friendly staff and a beautiful tropical drink. Our room was everything we needed a comfortable bed, a/c and a mini bar. We have been to the Cancun/Playa area numerous times and have stayed at the mega resorts and small boutique places and this one is simply the best. We were pleasantly surprised by the breakfast, it is not just a continental one, a full meal with a lot of variety. Also happy hour can not be beat, 1pm-11pm 2x1 drinks. The Mamitas beach club is also a plus. The only minus is its a pretty long walk in the heat from the hotel. The only negative I can think of is parking, the hotel does not have a lot so its street parking only. As for Playa itself its still a beautiful place to visit and central to many other Riviera Maya attractions. We drove one day to Coba to see the ruins, about an hour plus drive. We also went to Cozumel which is just a ferry ride away, we definately recommend the Chankanaub park for snorkeling and swimming with Dolphins. We had great meals throughout the week but we definately would say to stay far away from Las Mananitas on 5th, that place was awful, the food was so bland and portions tiny. One of the musts is La Pesca, this is not in the touristy area, its up on 30th right across the street from the Mega Store. Very good prices and very good seafood. We also got lucky because we got to catch part of the jazz festival at Mamitas. Since we are from the SF Bay Area we were suprised to find Tower of Power out there. We can't wait for our next trip back to Beautiful Playa, no other beach compares! And definately will stay at La Tortuga...

<Title>“Just what we wanted”
<Content>My wife and I went to Playa for a friend's wedding over thanksgiving and stayed three nights here and were really impressed. The staff are all super nice and helpful and patient with our limited Spanish. The room was great although I will say that getting the rooftop jacuzzi was disappointing in that we thought it was more of a hot tub than a bathtub that we needed to fill. well if you're there for a wedding you're not in your room much so we never used it. I would recommend one of the interior rooms as it looks out onto a lovely little oasis in the center of the hotel, away from the noise of the street. The breakfast that was included was great and we would stay here again for sure. Close to the center of Playa so you can walk just about anywhere.

<Title>“Another Rave Review”
<Content>What can I say, we loved it too! I am a budget traveler so this was a huge splurge for me. No special occasion, but I still felt like a queen. From check-in to check-out, the staff was above and beyond friendly. The desk is temporarily located in the restaurant, Agora and there is no La Tortuga sign right now. Be sure to get your coupon for the complimentary breakfast, beach towels, and Mamita's coupon for free chairs and palapa. Our jacuzzi suite, 202, was quiet with a faint construction noise that did not bother us. The view might be prettier over the pool, lit with lights and white lights in the trees at night, but we enjoyed the jacuzzi on our private terrace. Simply decorated, there was not a thing on the walls, glass shower and stylish dual sink bowls, towels, bathrobe, Agua products, mini-fridge and king-sized bed were all superb. The weather was rainy for one day of our stay, the last day of the trip we went to the beach, so the pool will have to wait for next time. The bar looked nice as well with happy hour all afternoon and evening, pool table and cushy, white couches. A busy computer is available for use. Breakfast is downstairs at your leisure and it's your choice off of the regular menu. Eggs mexican style served with beans and mashed potatoes, interesting but good of course. We loved our special treat of La Tortuga and highly recommend it!

<Title>“Loved La Tortuga”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at La Tortuga and loved it! We're both in our 20s, live in SF and LA and are accustomed to mid to high-end accomodations. LA Tortuga was perfect - intimate but chic, a great location, clean, hip (but not overly trendy like Deseo) and totally accomodating. The breakfast was great, drinks were awesome... and when they found out it was a 'special occasion' they provided champagne and rose petals on our bed when we arrived. We stayed in a junior suite with a jacuzzi balcony. We only used the jacuzzi once bc it was like a bath tub you had to fill up... not quite instant gratification. But it was nice. Our only complaint was the construction that woke us up at 7am, but hopefully thatll be done by next year... Feel free to email me if you want Playa recommendations. We loved it!

<Title>“Fantastic hotel, great service”
<Content>I booked this hotel for myself, my husband, sister and brother-in-law and my nephew. We were staying in Playa for one week for my son's wedding. After reading many reviews on Tripadvisor, there was no question that this hotel would be perfect. I was correct. It was booked through the hotel's website and I exchanged emails with Anna and Jessica. They were always answered promptly and with all the information that was required. It was a pleasure working with them. From the moment that we arrived at the hotel, we were treated as if we were special. A cab that we took from Cancun left us in front of La Tortuga. Immediately, a man came and greeted us on the sidewalk and took our bags. He accompanied us to the front desk for check-in where we were immediately seated and were given a fruit drink while we completed the process. This took less than five minutes. We were given a key to the safe in our room which was much appreciated. The bell man accompanied us to our room with our bags and welcomed us to La Tortuga. He couldn't have been nicer. We had a superior junior suite room #117 and it was lovely. The pool was about four feet from our patio. We made great use of the patio with its chairs and table. It was not very far from the hotel's Agora restaurant and beyond that, the bar. The room itself was immaculate and had a large bedroom with a mini refrigerator that the hotel kept stocked with beer, soda, and water. We found this very convenient. It also had a large bathroom/dressing room with a good sized closet. Another wonderful feature was the private rooftop jacuzzi with a bed and wonderful sunshine. It was decorated with lush tropical plants. This was just wonderful. When my son, the groom came to visit us, he couldn't believe how spacious and unique our accommodations were. The bedroom was a nice size and each evening there was an animal sculpture on the bed. We even had the royal treatment with the flower petals a few times. The king size bed was very comfortable. Now on to the staff at the hotel- they could not do enough for us. From check-in with Lusero to the waiters in the open air dining room who were Santiago, Daniel and Alfredo they were all so pleasant and helpful remembering our names and always asking how we were doing. I can't say enough about the staff, they are just a group of great people with a common mission to make those who stay at this hotel very comfortable. We had a delicious dinner for eight at the Agora restaurant on our first night at the hotel. My family raved about the food and the excellent service. Breakfast every morning was enjoyable. We ordered from the hotel menu and everything was just fine. There was something for everyone, pancakes, bacon, omelets, cheese and fruit, eggs, cereal and many Mexican dishes. This was all included in the room rate, a real bargain. Also, if you're up early like my sister, they brought her coffee right to a lounge area where she was seated. She didn't have to ask. They came over to her and asked if she would like some coffee. All served so beautifully with doilies under the teacup on the saucer. The hotel itself is a beautiful oasis away from the bustling crowds on Fifth Avenue. It is peaceful and the pool with all the tropical trees and plants is just wonderful. It is constantly being cleaned and it is so nice to come home to after a hectic day. We went to the beach by my son's hotel on 8th street because everyone always met there. There were sixty guests at this wedding and they came from all over. So we were busy every day. La Tortuga was a respite from all the excitement and I tried to make it a mini vacation for my husband and myself. I succeeded. When it came time to leave, Santiago and Daniel came to our room and took our bags to the waiting taxi. How's that for service! In closing, I would like to thank the entire staff at this hotel from the woman who kept our room so clean to the bartenders and waiters, busboys, greeters and all the people behind the scene who made our stay here so enjoyable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone seeking a truly relaxing and over the top vacation. We have been on many cruises and stayed at many hotels through the years but none has ever topped this hotel for service.

<Title>“We loved La Tortuga”
<Content>We stayed in room 218 for 5 days in mid-November. We are freguent travelers to mexico but haven't been on the east coast in 8 years. La Tortuga Hotel now gives us a reason to return. The central location is great since you are only one block from 5 th ave, yet you are far enough away to escape the crowds and the noise. Our room was one of the newer rooms with a king size bed and jacuzzi. It also had a large glass shower and a sitting area overloking the courtyard. Unllike a lot of mexican hotels, the bed was extremely comfortable. The service was wonderful and the staff were all very friendly. Breakfast was included and you were able to choose what you wanted off the menu. Their dinners were also very good and resonably priced. If you go make sure to ask Benny about Ai Cielo. It has a great swimmable beach and close to gourmet resteraunt about 20 minutes south of Playa.

<Title>“Unforgettable vacation at La Tortuga”
<Content>Our experience with La Tortuga and its staff was more than satisfactory. From the very beginning while still searching for the hotel that would most please our personal taste, Anna from the hotel’s reservations helped us tremendously with her prompt and accurate responses. And then, from the moment we arrived and were greeted by cheerful Mariana, and throughout our stay we knew we chose right. We absolutely enjoyed this charming place! It is well maintained, cozy and clean with a beautiful tropical courtyard pool where one can relax without limitations. The staff was extremely friendly, helpful and warm. They definitely made us feel at home. The location of the hotel is more than perfect, just one block from the main 5a Avenida, where all the restaurants, bars and indispensable shopping are, and a 10-minute pleasant walk along the beach to the Mamita’s. Close to night life, yet peaceful and quiet. Their breakfasts are delicious and the cocktails prepared by Justo’s fun and friendly team are too good to be skipped. The happy hour prices are unbeatable! All in all, we had a wonderful time and are already looking forward to returning next year. We would definitely recommend La Tortuga to everyone who prefers smaller boutique style accommodation over large impersonal all-inclusive resorts, and most of all who will enjoy spending time in friendly, colorful and picturesque Mexican town setting of Playa del Carmen.

<Title>“Already booked return trip to La Tortuga”
<Content>My husband and I took my mom and dad for her birthday to La Tortuga. I had previously stayed at Mosquito Blue and loved it, but wanted to compare the two hotels. While there, I booked a return trip for myself and three friends this January. The pool was beautiful and well manicured. We had a swim-up room, and took a private dip first thing every morning and last thing every night. The restaurant serves a made to order breakfast that is included in the room price and it was delicious. We also had lunch and poolside snacks which were also very good...highly recommend the grilled vegetable platter and the guacamole. The outdoor lounge offers two-for-one cocktails every afternoon. The staff was EXTREMELY polite, helpful and well informed about the area. They spoke perfect English and arranged all excursions for us. La Tortuga is definitely a gem in the heart of Playa, but two blocks away from the late night disco noise. Forgot to mention the beach club...a little bit of a walk and so-so chaise lounges, but adequate. Overall, great experience.

<Title>“Treasure in the Heart of the City”
<Content>The night of our wedding we still had no idea where we were going to go for our Honeymoon. I spent a lot of time researching the day after the wedding and based on Travel Advisor's previous reviews and the hotel's website, we chose La Tortuga. I cannot tell you what a great decision that was. Everything you read on this website is absolutely true. The location is fantastic! It's close to everywhere you want to be, but far enough away to relax in peace and quiet. The hotel itself is beautiful! The pool is amazing! Our room was great! Better than we hoped for! And, the prices are incredibly reasonable. There are other hotels in the area charging far more, for wayyy less. The staff were so attentive. From the moment we got there to the moment we left they attended to our every need. We had a couple of problems (not related to La Tortuga) and the manager (Benjamin) went far out of his way to rectify both situations for us. The pool bar is adorable and well stocked. They can make anything you could want. The restaurant at the hotel is wonderful and well priced. We will be going back for our one year anniversary and every chance we get after! It was the perfect honeymoon!

<Title>“The best of the boutiques”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at La Tortuga for 5 wonderful nights. If you're looking for a quaint, boutique experience, you will not be disappointed in La Tortuga. The staff was amazing. So accommodating and friendly - they know you by name almost immediately. The location is perfect - one block to 5th avenue and a short, pleasant walk to the beach club. The price is more than reasonable and includes a fabulous ala carte breakfast which you can have at anytime throughout the day. The hotel really takes on a magical, romantic quality by night with the lighting and surrounding pool. I would have liked to have actually used the pool but the water was a bit chilly by my standards. The ocean (sea) on the other hand, was perfect.

<Title>“La Tortuga rocks!”
<Content>We stayed at Hotel La Tortuga last week 10/24-10/28/07 and we were not disappointed! The hotel is beautiful, just as the pictures show only prettier in person. Our swim up room was small, but very comfortable (including the king-size bed). Mini-bar and in-room safe, access to Mamitas beach club, beach towels, onsite bar/lounge, breakfast from the Agora menu were an awesome plus. Plenty of closet space. Nice big shower and bath amenities. We enjoyed the patio with steps into the pool. All of the staff were professional, and so friendly and nice we wanted to take them home with us! Only a couple of minor problems that were promptly taken care of. Right around the corner from all of the lovely restaurants and action on 5th Avenue. Street parking was limited near the hotel, but was not a problem. Great recommendations or tour booking available at the front desk. Just can't say enough good things. Will definitely stay again!

<Title>“Loved La Tortuga!!”
<Content>Wondering where to stay in Playa??? I'll tell you, hands down the place to stay is Hotel La Tortuga!! The location was perfect (one block away from the action but still quite enough to get a good nights sleep) and the service was impecible. The staff was amazing at making sure every need was met. They really make yuou feel at home- feels like family! The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, Agora, was amazing- the perfect way to start off the day! I would really recommend eating dinner at Agora too. The wait staff was awesome and the food was great. Just got back on Sunday and already planning my next trip. Will definitely stay at Hotel La Tortuga next time I'm in Playa! **I know this sounds like a cheesy review from someone who works for the hotel, but I have to make sure the word gets out- Playa Del Carmen is THE vacation spot and La Tortuga is THE hotel!! Check it out for yourselves. You won't be disappointed.

<Title>“Don't think twice about it!”
<Content>Just go! Hotel La Tortuga is a rare find amongst the literally hundreds of hotels in Playa. I booked the room based on other reviews I read on Tripadvisor. I was really hesitant but went with it figuring so many people couldn't be wrong. And they weren't. Everything about this place was great, from the friendly and very accommodating staff, to the clean, comfortable and extremely affordable room. Everyone we met, from staff to guests, felt like extended family. Our stay at La Tortuga truly made our trip to Mexico special. Thanks to the friendly staff who made it that way...Benjamin, Santiago, Alfredo, Marianna and all the rest who made it a great stay! Thank you. To everyone else reading this, just go!

<Title>“Treated Like Family”
<Content>Where do I start……. My Husband and I stayed at La Tortuga for our honeymoon. From planning our honeymoon with Anna over email, to our stay we where treated like one of the family. The entire staff welcomed us with open arms and went out of their way to make our honeymoon perfect! We stayed in room 117 and we could not have been more pleased with our accommodations. Everyday we even got flower peddles on our bed and cute animals the housekeepers transformed out of our daily towels. The pool is gorgeous and the hotel is always kept very clean. Oh Yes and lastly, Danny make’s some amazing mango margaritas and Pina Colada’s!!!!

<Title>“Romance at La Tortuga”
<Content>We've just returned from our 5day/4night stay at La Tortuga. From the moment we arrived we were greeted like family. Bernardo and Mariana at the front desk were delightful. Ivan showed us to our room after greeting us with refreshing welcome coctails. I was in awe when I reached the courtyard area and the pool. It was like an oasis with lazy rivers, cascading waterfalls, bridges and an endless pool. We were pleased to see that we got suite 117. I had read reviews and was hoping for that very room. We arrived to find an anniversary surprise waiting for us in the room. Thank you Anna and Jessica! Ivan showed us all the amenities that the room had to offer. We had a self serve mini bar in the room and a rooftop jacuzzi. The tub was gorgeous and huge and halfway enclosed with clear glass. The showerhead was adjustable and the double sinks were very modern. The closet was huge and we got good use from the complimentary safe. There was more than enough space for all of our belongings, and I tend to overpack. Our suite was very clean and smelled nice. The bed was fluffy and I actually slept sounder than I ever have at any hotel. The fact that they don't allow kids under 16 is also a plus. It was nice to have some peace and quiet for a change. The room had a plasma tv and american news channels, which was nice to watch on our down time. The room rate includes a la carte breakfast from the menu at their restaurant Agora. We had breakfast there every day. It was delicious. I recommend the omeletes and the pancakes if you're really hungry. I really enjoyed the cappucinos too! We had dinner there once and the food as always was very good. The waiters were always friendly and ready to answer any questions. We had lots of fun with the restaurant staff. We also enjoyed the bar and the outstanding mojitos. Oh and the pina colada was the creamiest I've ever tasted. We enjoyed the pool both day and night. It was always being maintained by the grounds staff. Everything was always immaculate. The banana trees and the tropical palms surrounding the pool made it feel like an oasis. There were areas with shade and areas with sun. There were more than enough lounge chairs to go around. We had fun swimming through the lazy rivers and under the bridges too. The tropical jazz or spa like music playing in the background is really relaxing. I swear we never heard anything other than birds and and the waterfalls from the pool. I especially enjoyed the multi levels of the pool. The pool was heaven, seriously! We never had a chance to visit the spa but we did use our complientary beach passes to Mamita's Beach Club. The hotel even gave us towels every day which was a plus. The beach club was nice. We got here after 12 noon most of the time and found two or three palapas available with chairs. From what I read, they are hard to come by. Also September may be a slower season, don't know. We shopped up and down 5th. We ate fajitas at "La Parilla" which I recomend. We also dined at "La Adela" which was stupendous. The Margarita I had there was the best I've ever had. We also tried the famous "HC del Monterrey" and had the best steak ever. I really enjoyed the typical mexican fare on 10th as well. You must try the ice cream bars called Paletas. There are a few places on 10th. Well I don't have enough good things to say about this lovely boutique hotel. My husband is not a man of many words and he cannot stop telling our family and friends about it! We loved, loved, loved our stay at La Tortuga and would definitely book there again. I will be counting the days till we can return to La Tortuga in Playa del Carmen.

<Title>“Love La Tortuga!!”
<Content>First off, let me start out by saying that there is no way I can say enough good things about La Tortuga & its staff. My wife (then fiancée) and I were married in Play on Aug. 18th 2007 while staying at La Tortuga with friends and family. All though we had arranged for separate services for our wedding coordinator Anna & Jessica at the hotel went out of their way to set up spa services and our wedding dinner. From the moment we checked in every question was answered and then assisted with. I can almost guarantee you will not find a more personable, interactive and friendly staff in Playa. We were even lucky enough to be there through hurricane Dean and La Tortuga was ON TOP OF IT. They had food, supplies, lights and hourly updates delivered to our room. The hurricane was not all that bad but they had the pool and grounds cleaned and running by the time we got up the next morning. I have been to Play 4 times now and will always go back to La Tortuga. If you have questions on anything please feel free to e-mail me. The 16 others with us would say the same thing! PS – Our wedding dinner there for 18 was fabulous!!

<Title>“Absolutely amazing”
<Content>We booked at La Tortuga based on the countless positive reviews on Trip Advisor, and we certainly weren't disappointed. In all honesty, this was one of the best hotels that my husband and I have ever stayed at, especially with cost-value considerations. We highly recommend spending the extra per night rate to get a swim up room, you won't be disappointed. On their website, they have an early booking discount, which is an added bonus! The breakfast is delicious, a la carte, and included in your room rate. No silly meat and cheese buffet, but good Mexican food options and other more standard ham, egg, cheese croissants, too. And, if you like to sleep in, there's no stopping time for breakfast to be served, so no worries. Whenever I book a hotel, I'm very keen on the location, to make sure that it's convenient to get anywhere that we'd like. La Tortuga did not disappoint here either, as the location was perfect to the main shopping/restaurant/bar street in Playa, and very close to the beach. The Mamitas Beach Club, where you will have a free lounge chair as a part of your hotel rate, is a bit of a walk from the hotel (about 15 minutes), but a very nice location. We spent two of our four afternoons here. It was a very nice feature as well, that they did not allow children at the hotel. For those of you that need to get away from the family resorts, this is your place. If you prefer five pre-set all-inclusive buffet restaurants with the same food everyday and kids running around with employees bugging you to join in on pool games, with loud music and whistles, etc. - then don't stay here! We also used the spa for a few services, including massages. The massages were incredible. Highly recommended! I have already recommended La Tortuga to many friends, and if we find ourselves planning another trip to Playa, we'll certainly stay here again. In fact, we may travel to Playa just because of the hotel! Thank you to Anna, Marianna, and the rest of the staff!

<Title>“Nice hotel, very friendly staff”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga the first week of September and overall, had a good experience but the room itself (#21) was somewhat of a disappointment. The noise from the traffic was quite loud and if it hadn't been for the earplugs I had brought with me, it would have been very difficult to fall (or stay ) asleep. The room and bathroom smelled slightly moldy but it didn't bother us enough to complain. The staff, however, were extremely friendly, helpful and responsive and made the stay pleasant despite our less than perfect accomodations. The pool is very nice to look at/sit by but isn't the best for swimming. Considering the cost and location, I definitely recommend La Tortuga but travelers may want to spend a few extra bucks and get a better room. For anyone renting a car, parking is only available in front of the hotel at a daily cost but it might be worthwhile -- the spare tire on the back of our jeep was stolen overnight (we were only parked a block away), costing us upwards of $500 to replace!

<Title>“perfect honeymoon”
<Content>My husband and I visited Playa del Carmen in mid-August and stayed for 7 nights at La Tortuga. We were treated like royalty the first night-- the staff is really exceptional. We booked a suite with a rooftop jacuzzi (one of the newer rooms) and it was simply lovely. Spacious, comfortable, and clean-- and specially decorated for our honeymoon! We had a small patio with a table/chairs and a hammock outside our room, so even when all of the lounge chairs were taken we had a spot to relax with one of the excellent mixed drinks from the bar. The pool and courtyards are immaculately kept. There are lots of tasty choices for the free breakfast in the morning (try the Mayan omelet), and we ate at the restaurant for dinner once or twice and enjoyed our meals then as well. We had a great time joking around with the restaurant staff and had nothing but good service from them. We spent some time at the Mamitas beach club, but be forewarned-- you need to get there *early* if you want a chair, let alone an umbrella! Overall it was a fantastic honeymoon spot that I would recommend to anyone.

<Title>“Stay here. Seriously”
<Content>First of all, Playa is a lovely place to stay. It’s clean, safe, low-rise and leafy. The hotel is in an excellent location, within one block of 5th Avenue (Avenida Quintos, where all the restaurants, shops and bars are) so near enough to be convenient in the evenings but far enough to be quiet. There are also restaurants on 10th avenue where the hotel is located, there is a launderette with 24 hour service nearby, and the dive shop we used is a few blocks away on 10th. The hotel is lovely. From the minute we arrived and were given a welcoming drink, to the towel art on the bed every day when we got in, every detail is taken care of. Staff are friendly and efficient, they learn your names and use them. The rooms are not large but they are clean and comfortable, equipped with AC, a dehumidifier (it was very humid in August), a ceiling fan that we used a lot more than the AC, fridge and room safe. The bed was huge and lovely. The bathrooms are fairly basic, ie. no marble, but again very clean and comfortable. Towels were soft and plentiful, lots of hot water (not always the case in hotels in Mexico we heard), and they provided extra towels for swimming. What made the hotel for us was the pool. We had a swim up room which made all the difference; from our little terrace two steps lead down into the pool. It’s not a big square ‘swimming lengths’ pool, instead in a enclosed courtyard there is a lazy river type pool, with another circle of pool inside that circle of water, and then a deck with a Jacuzzi in the middle. Bridges and stepping stones link it all together, and the space is filled with banana trees and palm trees so it is always cool and shaded. There are also loungers and chairs around, and the hotel bar in very easy reach. Given that you are unlikely to be swimming lengths but more likely cooling and relaxing after or during a hot day, this was perfect for us. The water was always clean and clear, thanks to numerous staff attending it every morning, and because the pool was curved and sheltered by trees, our little piece of it felt very private and was a lovely place to unwind at the end of a day’s sightseeing or diving. The restaurant is also by the pool, so the open air tables are a lovely place to sit in the morning. Speaking of the restaurant, we didn’t eat dinner there but the breakfast every day is included in the room price and is excellent. The choices available run to two pages with the various juices and drinks, servings are large and include any number of Mexican dishes as well as the more usual European type breakfast dishes. I had the fruit plate every morning which was generous and very fresh, my husband had variations on eggs with tortillas, beans, salsa, cheese etc. It was all delicious. We didn’t eat there in the evening for no other reason than we didn’t get round to it. There are lots of places to eat nearby. 5th Avenue is the most obvious location (turn right when you get there, Tropical and Capricioso were both good, La Adele had indifferent food and poor service), on one of the streets between 5th and 10th we found YaxChi which was a fabulous place to eat lunch and a rather smarter place to eat dinner) but the best place we ate was on 10th, where the food tends to be more casual and a good bit cheaper. Turning right and going north out of the hotel, after a few blocks you reach Tocameron, a little place where we had fantastic rice with chicken and sesame, and tortilla with shrimp filling. No alcohol but enormous smoothies, and friendly service. It was almost next to the dive shop; we dived with Pluto Dive who were efficient, friendly and very professional. It takes about 10 minutes to walk there from the hotel, as long as you ignore the map on their website that tells you that they are on the beach. Things to do? We booked trips with the hotel to go to Chichen Itza, Tulum and Coba, all of which were very professionally run and very much worth doing. For two of the three we were picked up at the door; for the third we had to walk to a hotel nearby. We could have gone to Mamitas beach club but never did as we were too busy and the hotel pool was so lovely. The hotel also organised our transfers to and from the airport. Essentially this is one of the loveliest hotels we have stayed in, and we’ll definitely go back. I recommend it without reservation.

<Title>“Perfect in all Aspects!!!”
<Content>We started our 11 day trip on Friday, August 10th and stayed at La Tortuga for 5 days. After flying all day we were greeted by Mariana, who was extremely pleasant. While we were checking in, our bags were whisked away to our room. When it was time to go to our room we were greeted with a wonderful beverage, and escorted to our swim up room (highly recommend), it was beautiful, we were celebrating our "official" honeymoon and they had decorated our room with balloons, and towel swans, it was heavenly, they had beers waiting for us on ice (I pre arranged this through Anna!), the room was very intimate and had a wonderful King size bed (very comfortable), it was perfect! Since it was so late when we got there, we were starving and thought we'd try the hotels restaurant, it was very good! The staff were very pleasant and attentive during our stay. The grounds and pool were amazing! It was like being in your own sanctuary. The roof top lounge was very nice too, a great place for an afternoon siesta on a very comfortable bed for two. The hotel was within walking distance to everything....the steak place around the corner I believe the name is Sol, was spectacular, our favorite meal while we were there. Mamita's Beach Club, is a little bit of a walk for some, but we enjoyed the leasuirely stroll, it was wonderful! The beach was amazing and we had really good service. We had our laundry washed across the street, although a very good price $5.00 for wash/dry and folded - we came back home with pink underwear/socks...be aware.... I can't speak highly enough about this hotel and their staff, we will definately be back!!!! We were always greeted at the front desk by our first names, what a nice personal touch. The only negative thing I have to say, is it would be nice if they had a dresser for clothing or more shelf space, so you didn't feel like you were living out of your suitcase.

<Title>“Tortuga was great!”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel August 1st-8th. Loved the location, couldn't get any better or closer to all the main restaurants/shops/lounges that Playa has to offer. Hotel was VERY peaceful and VERY clean. The free breakfast is such a great deal and you don't have to rush to get down there at a certain time, they serve breakfast pretty late. Try the Mayan Omlette and the Chilaquiles!!! mmmm!! The staff was very friendly and we would sit and chat w/ the bartender, and especially Mariana and Alfredo, very friendly front desk! We never really got to check out the pool as we are beach people so the free passes to Mamitas Beach Club are worth it! GREAT beach and can't beat that warm caribbean water! But the pool was very clean. All the common areas are immaculate and there is always someone cleaning. We loved La Tortuga and wouldn't mind coming back again! We Loooooved Playa Del Carmen.

<Title>“Hot Tortuga”
<Content>Pros: The pool area was like an "oasis" in the middle of the hotel. It is completely closed off without ever really hearing the street noises outside. Great, great atmosphere to relax with a bar, pool table and jacuzzi. 2x1 drinks during happy hour-great mojitos.. Free breakfast is definitely a plus, it's an a la carte type menu, not continental style. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Location was good. Housekeeping made our stay fun with bed accented decorations using bath towels each day-it was always a treat to see what was going to be next. Cons: Wireless internet service was not reliable. Rooms could have been a little bigger. Dinner at the hotel restaurant left a little to be desired. The seafood linguine was not very tasty and over-salted. They were slow on getting food out to us as well. Overall, the hotel was very romantic and peaceful. After a day of exploring, it was nice to come back to this place to relax. We would definitely recommend this to others.

<Title>“hot, hot, hot”
<Content>My Mom, Sister and I stayed at the hotel from August 5th through the 9th. We had a rooftop jaccuzi and a great view of the pool. The staff from the main office to the resteraunt was outstanding. During our stay we did have a door lock issue and the hotel seemed to have some plumbing problems however, for the price the visit was still a good one. The one thing I would say is if this is your first time visiting this area go in the winter because the heat was miserable and 90% of the resteraunts and shops had no air, including the hotel resteraunt that provided only fans. If I had to choose between staying at La tortuga again or a 5 star hotel I would most definetely go back just for the superb staff.

<Title>“Gorgeous little gem!”
<Content>La Tortuga was a delight: from our warm welcome by the lovely Marianne to the margueritas by the pool, to the wonderful breakfasts. It really is a gorgeous little oasis and the staff are just wonderful. We particularly loved the fact that you could have breakfast at whatever time you chose, there's no time limit. The omelettes were amazing and the juice so fresh that we were set up for the day. Dinner at the restaurant is very nice with huge portions. It's a real shame that there isn't a menu on display as had there been I'm sure that we would have discovered it earlier. The only small criticism that I have is that I was surprised on check out to read our bill and find that every time we had charged something to our room a service charge had been added. I have absolutely no problem with tipping (we left cash tips every time) but would have liked to have known this was being charged (and also to have confirmed that this was going directly to the staff) Also when we ate in Aurora there were huge signs outside stating that you got a free cocktail with your meal: we didn't and were charged. It's not a big deal but I think needs addressing. We'll definitely be back and recommending La Tortuga,what a gem!

<Title>“Service Excellence”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at La Tortuga from July 10-15th to celebrate our wedding anniversary with four other friends. This trip could not have been better! On a dollar for dollar basis you just can't beat staying at La Tortuga. The hotel is wonderful. Great pool and common areas. GREAT bar (drank so many frozen Mojitos my skin should have turned green!) and restaurant. Convenient to everything. Sure Mamitas is a walk but if you were not staying on the beach you'd probably end up there anyway! Service is amazing. After I registered the first day everyone remembered my name and room number. Anna and the staff had a great champagne suprise waiting for my wife and I on our last day. We booked a rooftop jacuzzi junior suite and ended up in #312 which was close to Spa Itza and away from any traffic. I wholeheartedly recommend La Tortuga and will return without hesitation. I also recommend the Playasia restaurant at the 5th Ave Blue Parrot Hotel for amazing Thai & sushi. Check out El Quid Roe for the Thursday Night Foam Party as well! Thank you Anna and staff for a very memorable anniversary!

<Title>“Loved it”
<Content>This hotel certainly lives up to reputation. I read previous reviews with caution as I couldn't quite believe that so many people loved this hotel so much - however, having stayed here for ten nights in Jul-07 I have to say it was just fantastic. We booked a junior suite with a rooftop jacuzzi, and given the price of the room (about $140 per night) we were taken aback by how nice the room was. Although not necessarily luxuriously fitted, the room was spacious, clean and modern. The bathroom was very large and stylish and the rooftop jacuzzi together with sun terrace was the icing on the cake. The hotel grounds are beautiful, with the pool set around a tropical garden. The hotel is about 40-50 rooms in total but the place always seems so quite and tranquil and is very romantic. The bar by the pool has reasonably priced drinks, in particular the cocktails during happy hour 95pm to 6pm each night). The hotel also has a nice looking restaurant right next to the pool area though we didn't eat there in the evening, only for breakfast which is free and is good. The staff are friendly and attentive. The hotel is not directly on the beach though is only a few hundred yards away. The Mamitas beach club (for which hotel residents get free passes) is about 10-15 mins walk further down the beach, though as the beach around Mamitas is the nicest along Playa Del Carmen we tended to go there each day rather than the beach nearest the hotel. Also the beach club adjacent to Mamitas has much more comfortable chairs and is only $7 per chair per day so we tended to use that one instead. The hotel is also directly around the corner from 5th avenue which has numerous shops and restaurants, though many are very touristy and overpriced and we struggled to find really good Mexican fare along 5th avenue, though the Argentinian steak house called Sur which is right by the hotel on 5th Avenue was excellent. 10th Avenue however is less touristy and has some more authentic looking Mexican restaurants. If we come back to Playa Del Carmen would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Amazing Hotel in Playa”
<Content>We booked La Tortuga on a friend's recommendation, so we expected a nice experience. Needless to say, La Tortuga completely exceeded our (already high) expectations. Wow. We were impressed. The grounds are lovely -- the pool, a beautiful place to lounge and cool off. We met many nice people from all over the world, and all were very much "of the vibe" of the hotel. That is to say: relaxed, nice, and low-key. No kids under 15 is the policy (and actually, we didn't see any kids at all at the hotel). I love children, but this is definitely a hotel for couples and singles. Somewhere to go if you are looking for a relaxing, stylish, luxe, romantic retreat. I have to say too that the service was outstanding. The front desk staff especially was extremly pleasant and very accomodating. Our bed was decorated every day with fresh flowers and fresh towels twisted into interesting shapes. Also, on my birthday, the staff put ballons in my room, a bottle of wine on ice, and rose petals all over my bed. That was very sweet. I loved it. Also, the location is really good. It's very close to Quinta, but just removed enough that it's quiet at night. We passed by many lovely hotels during our stay, and alwasy turned to eachother and said "But, I'm soooo glad we're at La Tortuga." Would recommend to anyone visiting Playa.

<Title>“Precious little hotel”
<Content>Our stay at La Tortuga was a great experience! My husband and I went for three nights at the end of our honeymoon, and we loved it! The hotel is PERFECT location for the main street with all of the restaurants, bars, and shops. It was one block off of the main street which we thought was perfect: still quiet and peaceful but a short walk. The staff was awesome! Everyone was SO helpful and truly strived to please us! The pool area is beautiful. Great breakfast at the restuarant connected to the hotel. Free Internet. Lots of TV channels.

<Title>“Hotel La Tortuga--Honeymoon heaven”
<Content>I booked our honeymoon with La Tortuga, and after a 10 night stay, my new wife and I were thoroughly satisfied with the hotel. The grounds were well kept and extremely clean. The pool area is in the center of the grounds, and the banana trees, palm trees, flowering trees, and landscaping were gorgeous. My wife and I could completely forget about the busy restaurant/shopping district just a block away while lying by the pool. I can't really say enough about how well kept the grounds were. We booked a superior junior suite, and we were very pleased. The jacuzzi on the roof was private and was a good way to unwind after a busy day. The beds were firm, but we still thought they were very comfortable. The room was spacious and always clean. The A/C sufficiently cooled the room from the heat outside with ease. The restaurant in the hotel offers free breakfast for guests; I recommend the mayan style omelet. Be careful not to order something so small that you get up hungry. Everything on the menu is tasty. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. They knew our names and room number, and would go out of their way to speak to us and make our stay as pleasurable as possible. We booked a tour through the front desk, and they did a remarkable job of handling that for us. We have already recommended this hotel to our friends and family. We loved it. For our needs and desires, it was just perfect.

<Title>“Perfect small hotel, best location possible.”
<Content>Just got back from 8 days at Hotel La Tortuga, based partially upon reviews written here, and the place certainly did not disappoint! To the contrary, it lived up in every way to what I had hoped for. The location was absolutely perfect for me. 1 block from 5th Av., the heart of the downtown shopping, eating, nightlife area. Being a block away, the hotel had none of the noise, but had all of the advantages of being so close. It was an ideal location - close to the dive shop that I wanted to use (Tank-Ha) so that I could get there in 5 minutes each day, and so close to the best restaurants and shopping on 5th. Mine was a completely dive-focused vacation... if you plan on spending each day at the beach, you might not be as enthusiastic with the location. It's a very short walk to the beach, but Tortuga's reserved chairs are further down... so it might get to be a drag, especially if you have kids... might want to try a hotel with their own beach. That said, the hotel staff was exceptional... They know you by name right after you check in, and everyone greets you with very sincere friendly greetings. Maids, waiters, front desk staff... everyone was excellent and friendly. Didn't try the spa, but it looked excellent. Rooms were very comfortable. I had a swim-up room, and it was quite nice, though not "spacious" by American standards. For me, it was fine, as I was alone on a dive vacation. I love the terraces out to the pool area. Pool area was beautiful and comprises the whole of the courtyard area. I had room 305, a jacuzzi suite for one night and that was nice. Jacuzzi is up on the roof with private stairs to get there... they've made it pretty private up there with plantings and shades, but one room could certainly look out to see you coming up those steps. (and they lose a little privacy due to your steps that practically look right into their balcony and room.) but the room was nice. "Suite" was a little generous for this room... it was about the size of a normal room at a large american chain like a Hilton. Certainly not like an Embassy Suites-sized room. But all was tastefully done. I had swim-up room 112 for the rest of the stay. There are 5 swim-up rooms, and if you can you should ask for 112. It's the end room, so it's not only quieter, but has two other advantages: it's larger than the other swim-ups because the hallway ends at this room so it gets a bit more space. AND, it's the only swim-up room with step-out access to both the upper pools and the lower pools... a nice advantage. Wasn't sure I'd use the pools, but they were great after a long hot day... so relaxing... lots of nooks/crannies to hang out and read or just relax. very nice. There's an upper pool area and a lower pool area, connected by a few little spillovers, it's very well designed. The hotel could probably add a few more english language TV stations. (CNN was reliable, but many other stations were dubbed into spanish including Disney, Nick, etc. so kids may be disappointed in that if TV is important to your family.) There's wi-fi and a free internet PC in the bar area. (was sometimes hard to get on it... they might want to add a 2nd PC soon). Here's another tip... something I couldn't figure out before I came: Cellphone access. This hotel had VERY strong Verizon coverage (or whatever provider I roamed to...) my cellphone worked just great here... in fact it did throughout the downtown Playa area. Everything worked as expected... decent showers. (no tubs in most rooms), fresh filtered water bottles delivered to you each morning and night. I only had breakfast at the hotel's restaurant, but it was great. (and Free!) - omelette's, fruit, juices, coffee, other egg dishes, meats... all great. And the staff here incredibly friendly too. In summary, if you're interested in a quiet, friendly, safe, beautiful hotel close to the action and beaches of Playa without the noise of being above a nightclub, then Tortuga will be excellent. The only caution is that if you're expecting a beachfront resort with games and toys for kids, or you want to stumble out of your room in the morning directly onto a beach chair in the waves, then this isn't your place. All in all, it was an excellent stay and I can recommend this hotel highly... --josh

<Title>“Pretty good experience, would stay again.”
<Content>Well, I think my rating would be more like a 4.5, because we really loved the hotel, but did have some minor issues. The positives: LOVED the pool!! It is really awesome and everyone worked really hard to keep it clean and maintained. At happy hour the waiters come around to offer 2 for 1 drinks. The sunbeds are absolutely phenomenal. The pool area is a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. The breakfast was excellent. I didn't find the choices to be monotonous, and I was expecting small portions since it was included, but they were huge. The coffee was great (sometimes hard to find American tasting coffee in Playa), the bread was tasty, and overall loved the food. Favorite was the Chilaquiles w/scrambled eggs. Check in was so easy, but I felt like this was an extension of the planning process, which was, literally, the best vacation planning I have ever had. Anna is fantastic, responsive and thorough before you get there, and the staff is that way when you get there. We were greeted with a fruit drink when we got there, which was a nice touch, and check in was a breeze. We didn't experience any nickel & dime charges, which I have seen mentioned here, and coffee was available in the mornings at the bar area (complimentary). The rooms were very nicely decorated, plain but nice (most hotels we have stayed in Playa are similiar). The linens were nice, loved the furniture on the porch of our swim-up room, and I didn't think the room was small at all. Just the right size for two people. There was plenty of hot water and the shower pressure was good. The room had a small flat screen with some American channels. We had an issue with a travel companion missing a flight, but they were so gracious and accomodating in rearranging the transportation for her. We were so grateful to have Mariana at the front desk to help out. The negatives: This was my fifth stay in Playa, and this was the absolute hardest bed I have ever slept on. We had fellow travelers in the hotel, and their beds were practically pillow-top, so I think I would just ask for a different room next time. We had a swim up room, which faces the pool. Every morning by about eight or so, they would start playing the new-agey music by the pool/bar, which I could hear in my room and could not go back to sleep. The music is cool, but it seems like it could be turned down lower or later in that area. We had one cleanliness issue, which I raised, and it was resolved immediately. I noticed a couple of other minor cleanliness issues, but I did not mention them. Perhaps the staff needs some further pointers on hitting the details of the room (i.e. edges of the bathroom counters, light switch areas, baseboards). I am pretty nit-picky, which is why I didn't complain, but others out there may be as nit-picky as I am. Last, there were no wash cloths for bathing. Maybe it is an American thing to use wash cloths for bathing, but they didn't provide them at all. We thought that was strange, but would just bring our own next time. If you normally use them to bathe, bring your own. Overall, we really liked the hotel. This was our fifth trip to Playa in about 3 years, and this is the first hotel we would do a repeat in. I would just ask for a different room away from noisier areas and request one of the rooms with the newer beds. Thanks again Anna, Mariana and Bernando, as well as the staff of the Agora for all of your help and hosting. (Other properties we have stayed in: Mosq. Blue, Luna Blue, Vilas Sacbe Condo, Iber. Quetz. AI

<Title>“Perfect Hotel”
<Content>We just got back from visiting Playa del Carmen during the week of July 4th, 2007. We stayed at La Tortuga Hotel the whole week and had the best experience!! We had arranged with the hotel manager, a private car to come and pick us up at the airport. Even though our flight had been 3 hours late, when we stepped out of the airport, the driver was waiting for us. Obviously, the hotel is very responsible toward guests. We were so relieved and happy!! When we arrived at the hotel, the doorman, Alfredo, was so helpful and kind. Mariana, the woman at the front desk was so welcoming and explained everything clearly. During the entire week, all of the staff, including the cleaning staff, were so wonderful. They never failed to have a smile on their faces and say a friendly Hola to us whenever we were on hotel grounds. We had never had such wonderful and attentive service ever in another hotel. The free breakfast every morning was too good to be true. Next door, the restaurant let us choose a free beverage and free meal (ordered from a menu) each morning. The room itself (we stayed in a Suite with a rooftop jacuzzi) was a good size with plenty of closet space. There was a t.v. with many many channels (some in english, some in spanish), A/C which saved us from the heat many times, a fan, beautiful balcony, comfortable bed, and everything was very clean. The rooftop jacuzzi was very well maintained and great for cooling off!! The location of the hotel is too perfect. It is on a quiet street, but right as you walk out the front door and turn right for a block, you hit the main street, which is bustling and lively, full of restaurants and shops. We enjoyed being able to go out every evening and come home without having to walk miles. We highly recommend this wonderful hotel, which we would love to stay at again in the future. Hats off to the wonderful manager, Anna Bassi, and her wonderful staff!!

<Title>“Nice pool, decent room, good ambience, add 12% to your quote.”
<Content>Photos are accurate. Pool is excellent... very relaxing and unique. Hotel is small-medium sized, so there is a certain feeling of intimacy. Not close to the beach, but not too far to walk either (about 10-15 minute walk). The rooms are decent... nothing to brag about. Our room was clean, but smallish. The bathroom layout is annoying. The glass shower door barely has enough room to open due to the poor placement of a bidet right in front of it. The beds are very firm, but not uncomfortable. The maids turned the A/C off every day despite my polite notes requesting that they leave it on. And, the A/C takes a long time to cool the room... so, leaving it on would've been helpful. The restaurant gives you free breakfast... as long as you are careful not to order "special" items (soda, latte, shake, etc.). After about 2 days of eating from the restaurant, you quickly get tired of the food selection... it all starts to taste the same. Service at the restaurant is very friendly, but somewhat slow. We had a slight ant problem in the bathroom near the sink. The ants stayed in the sink area... so, it wasn't that big of a deal. The hotel charges you $1/day to use the in-room safe. They also add 12% to your total bill for tax upon checking out. I would highly-suggest requesting a pool-facing room. The rooms that face the street are noisy at night and the view is anything but pleasant... abandoned lots, etc. The hotel is conveniently-located close to shopping, restaurants, drug store, etc. The hotel staff was courteous, friendly, and helpful at all times. I think that for the price ($140/night average after tax), this hotel is a good pick. The things I've pointed out may seem negative... but, I am just trying to give a thorough review. I would recommend this hotel to others, while pointing out the details mentioned.

<Title>“Loved it!”
<Content>This hotel was perfect for our honeymoon. It's not too large and not too small. The landscaping is gorgeous. The staff is super friendly and helpful. We stayed in a swim up room and enjoyed having such easy access. We had been concerned that perhaps noisy pool-goers would disturb us, but the portion of the meandering pool that passes in front of the room patios is narrow so folks don't hang out there. My hubbie says that one night he did hear music (probably from the clubs or bars on Quinta Avenida) playing pretty late into the night, but I didn't hear anything during the 5 nights we were there and slept soundly. A/C or a ceiling fan is available to keep you comfortable through the night. Breakfast was included, and the selections were very good. We loved every breakfast dish we ordered. Fresh mango shakes and fruit juices. Very close walking distance to the main drag with shops, restaurants, bars, clubs, etc. The beach club is a little bit more of a walk, but I can't say exactly timewise, because we drove there. It is a very nice beach, with comfortable lounge chairs and large attractive thatch umbrellas. Nice facilities to rinse off the sand and changing rooms. Across the street from the hotel is a quickie pharmacy for any emergency needs like antibiotic ointment, bug spray, feminine items, soft drinks, etc. A bank is about a block away to exchange your currency. Only complaint may be that there was a little bit of damage to the mirror in our bathroom, but the mirror was very large horizontally so it didn't get in the way of two people getting ready in front of it. The bathroom was a good size but the room was a little on the small side. It didn't affect us at all though. I can't stop gushing about this place.

<Title>“Absolutely loved La Tortuga”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at La Tortuga for 4 nights the beginning of May. I had intended to write a review once we returned home to help others make a decision but only found the time now. We chose a swim up room for the novelty and it was great to just walk out the patio and take a dip whenver I wanted to. Everyone on trip advisor said the rooms were tiny, so we expected such but it was fine. This is what you get....3.5 feet, a king bed, and another 3.5 feet. I would say you get 3.5 ft from the bottom of the bed to the wall as well. I found a niche to put my suitcase in and my husband used his 3.5 feet of floor space. On the positive side, we never lost anything!!! The bed was hard, but we had no difficulty falling asleep. The room was clean, and plainly decorated, but we spent very little time in it. Next time, however, I might select a larger room. The grounds are gorgeous and very relaxing. I found myself taking hundreds of photos of the scenery, and I couldn't improve from the ones you see on the website taken by other guests. There is always someone tending to the property. Breakfast was great. You get to order 1 cold drink, 1 hot drink and an entree. I tried something different every morning. The first day we went outside and ate on the street side of Agora. But we much preferred eating on the side that faces the swimming pool. Things we had and enjoyed were: omelets, pancakes, fruit platters and even a ham and cheese sandwich on a baguette (if you are not a breakfast person) One day I tried the Mayan Omelet, which includes everything but the kitchen sink. It was interesting and freshly prepared, but I only tried it because we were in Riviera Maya. Mamita's is truly the best beach in town, as we took the beach route one day and other beaches are rocky and small. We arrived before 10 a.m. every day and had no trouble getting an umbrella and beach chairs. The walk there was about 15 minutes and pleasant. When you've had enough beach and want to get back to the hotel, the walk seems a little longer. But then I thought about that great pool awaiting me. My husband took advantage of the new spa upstairs and really enjoyed it. Happy hour....2-for-1 around 5 p.m. was great. The drinks were better here than in other places in town. It was also nice to meet other hotel guests. We met a young couple, Matt and Chris, that were a joy to talk to. They had traveled the world and were working their way up the Mayan coast. Location.....right around the corner is Fifth Avenue. You don't even have to cross a street and you are in the pedestrian walkway. We took a walk one night to the southern end of the Avenue, and it was noisier, Carlos & Charlies, cruise ships, etc. So, we liked the area near La Tortuga to dine and shop better. I know I'm forgetting some things....but all in all, La Tortuga was my kind of hotel. It was clean, service was good and I wouldn't hesitate to return. Just as an aside....we checked out 2 other hotels that we were considering and that received good reviews on trip advisor. We are confident that we made the right decision!

<Title>“Great choice in downtown Playa”
<Content>This hotel has a great location and superb customer service. The pool area is kept very clean and it is a short, pleasant walk to the wonderful beach club "Mamitas", that the hotel provides passes for chairs and umbrella to. We had a jr suite which faced outward of the property. Not the hotel's best view and I would suggest a room overlooking their pool area. Breakfast provided daily with a good selection of Mexican and American choices. Walking distance to all of the bars and restaurants on and around 5th Avenue.

<Title>“My slice of heaven”
<Content>We had our entire wedding party (38) stay here & everyone was delighted not only with the hotel itself, but also with the entire staff. Anna & Jessica were extremely helpful during the booking process and went above & beyond their duties to help us organize transportation & excursions. Mariana & Bernardo at the front desk make you feel like family. Location is ideally located - near everything. Passes to Mamitas Beach is a nice touch. I'd definitely recommend others to stay here if they're looking for a boutique type hotel. I can't wait to return to La Tortuga some day in the not too distant future.

<Title>“First Class at Budget Prices”
<Content>I have always use tripadvisor to do my travel research before booking hotels, but this is the first time that I have been so blown away with service and quality for the value that I was compelled to write a review. I chose La Tortuga hotel based on all the excellent reviews listed below and I could not been more pleased. I recently got married at a beach in Playa del Carmen and had myself, family and all guests stay here and no one had any complaints at the end of the 5 day stay!!! The staff was more than delightful, attentive and on top of every detail. By the second day they knew most guests name and were very helpful in informing/helping them with things to do in the area. Mariana and Bernardo were an absolute delight from "Bienvenidos" to "Adios". We were so sad to go. Management, Anna and Jessica, are very quick on email responses and more than able and willing to assist with any requests. The hotel breakfast that is included was an excellent selection and always tasty. Whoever posted earlier about the cappucinos was dead on - they were great!!! They updated some of their rooms and now have a suite with personal mini pool that looked amazing. I didn't realize this upgrade/update until I was there and it was already booked up for the entire stay, but all rooms are clean, comfy and cute! The jacuzzi suite rooms are very romantic and nice. As you can see I could go on and on for this place and the wonderful experience that I and 38 other guests had. Highly recommended even though it is not on the beach! Playa is a great town and the beach passes to Mamitas Beach Club make it even more worthwhile!!! Love the Staff and Love Playa!!!

<Title>“Absolutely wonderfull”
<Content>We've stayed in this hotel for 8 nights and I can only say that it was an amazingly perfect time. I have no remarks whatsoever and can only compliment the hotel and it's employees. In advance we had some contact with ms. Anna Bassi and all answers were prompt and very clear. I would like to give remarks in several points: Room: We had a standard plus room with 2 queen beds, the size of the room was satisfying, in other reviews I read that the size was a point of issue, but I thought was big enough to stay with 2 persons in it. The balcony was also acceptabel, it had a table and 2 nice chairs and view of the pool. The beds were hard at first, but after I asked the reception for a solution they changed the matresses the same day for brand new ones. Also everything was kept very clean by the housekeeping staff, so no remarks there! Staff: Always very friendly and they never seemed irritated or anything. Restaurant: The breakfast was always enough, you can order from the menu every morning and we tried several products. They always tasted perfect! The dinner was also very nice, allthough we had the complete restaurant for ourselfs (it never is very crowded). Swimming Pool: Very, very nice. It's not a huge pool with volleybal nets etc in it and we think that is a absolute plus! It's very well kept and everything looks very tropical. Concluding: We will definatly come back to this hotel, and I can recommend it to everyone that likes small, intimate and non-all inclusive hotels. Best regards, Johan Baars & Linda de Bruin

<Title>“Loved La Tortuga”
<Content>We really enjoyed our stay at Hotel La Tortuga. The location was central to the popular 5th avenue. The swim-up room we wanted was booked, but out Standard Plus room was very comfortable. We stayed in room 210 and had a nice view of the pool area, which is beautiful. The pool area is a great place to relax if you want to take a break from going out. The bar and restaurant is located right next to the pool along with internet access and they have seats next to the pool for those who don't want to take a dip. They also have a pool table for those rainy days. The friendly staff provided superb service. They made us feel welcome the minute we arrived when they brought us drinks while we were checking in. Breakfast was included and they had a good selection to choose from as well as a friendly staff. The rooms were clean and each day after the room was turned around they would leave a towel origami arrangement that changed daily. I would definitely stay at Hotel La Tortuga when I come back to Playa and would recommend this hotel to my friends.

<Title>“Charming Hotel Tortuga”
<Content>This is our third time (May 12-19) at Hotel La Tortuga and it just keeps getting better and better! This is a wonderfully charming hotel that manages to get it all right. If you want a nice hotel that has a Mexican/jungle feel while at the same time giving wonderful service then you won’t be disappointed with the hotel. It is not huge like the hotels you see in Cancun, but rather it almost feels like a bed-and-breakfast even though it’s not a B&B. I would say that if you like big Vegas-style-hotels this probably is not for you. I forget how many rooms it has exactly (20’ish?) but they have gone for a smaller more intimate setting that captures the feel of being in Mexico. The staff could not have been nicer and helped us many time in planning trips, giving recommendations and just being darn right friendly. They were prompt in answering emails and managing transportation from the airport. They even took the time to memorize your name and call you by name as they saw you come in and out. I had a little problem with a shower curtain being to short and it was fixed immediately. The hotel is clean, safe and the new pool additions plus the Jacuzzi make for a fun time just hanging out at the pool and at happy-hour. I can’t wait to visit again and look forward to staying there again.

<Title>“Cute but not comfortable”
<Content>We spent our vacation days in Cozumel to dive but flew into Cancun because it was hundreds of $ less than flying into Cozumel this time. We came back to Playa for our last night to make getting to the airport for our early morning flight easier. La Tortuga was kind enough to book us for one night only and we were excited to be able to check out this property in Playa. The other reviews are right on about the great friendly service. The staff is top notch. La Tortuga is a charming property. The inner courtyard and pool are beautiful and look serene but were spoiled for us by the yelling drunken crowd also staying here. That can be a problem any any hotel. It is especially discouraging at a small boutique hotel. OUR ROOM Our room was small . I could live with that except our bed was even more horrible than the other hard as rock beds we find most everywhere in Mexico. We travel with roll out thick cushions , but even those could not soften the blow of this cement like, tilted to one side mattress. I find this" any excuse for a mattress" thrown on a frame ,no box spring, propped up on wood blocks (in a room priced only $10/night less than the beautiful oceanfront condo we had in Cozumel ) inexcusable in a "SPA" hotel. Our night there was the most miserable we have ever suffered. I hate to see a hotel with so much going for it lose out because it seems to not understand basic sleeping comfort. Maybe we had the only room with such a horrible bed, maybe not.... we won't go back to find out. In the past I myself have been guilty of packing blow up rafts and cushy matts (on our flight home i was planning to purchase an aero mattress to take on our next trip)so we could sleep on the miserable beds we find traveling. In essence I suppose thats tantamount to saying its O.K. to charge us big money and not provide basic comfort. Now that Mexico wants to charge like upscale areas in the tourist industry I am going to demand comfort or take our vacation dollars elsewhere. I hope you do the same! Sorry La Tortuga, a room like that should not be rented to anyone!

<Title>“Last night at Tortuga and I don't want to leave....”
<Content>I'm sitting at the bar at Hotel La Tortuga on my last of 14 nights here. What a great little hotel! It's my third hotel of my 5 week trip and it has been perfection. The entire staff has been exceptionally nice and friendly. I won't know what to do with myself when I get back home and don't have Juan Carlos, Carlos, Miguel, Martin, Dany, Alfredo and especially Fidel to take care of me. I think I have forgotten how to open my own beers! I stayed in one of the suites and it was beautiful. Very modern and secluded in the back corner by the pool. I've really enjoyed meeting all of the other guests and have made some new friends at the bar and by the pool. The friendly staff and laid back personality of this place were exactly what I was wanting for this leg of my trip. Kevin and Lisa, Michelle, Vicky, Angie and Carl, beautiful Rebecca - the best conversation night ever! - and all of the other guests that I met while I was at La Tortuga made these two weeks fly by. I will definitely return to this hotel again.

<Title>“Quality and personalized service in quaint hotel”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at La Tortuga in mid-May of 2007. We had a swim up room across the pool from the bar. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, our expectations were properly set. We travel quite a bit and we would easily stay at La Tortuga again. The hotel staff was excellent. When we had questions about where to eat or what to do, they provided great recommendations. Anna and the front desk staff were fantastic. We even had fun learning / practicing our Spanish with the bar and restaurant staff (even though they spoke English - they were very patient). Our room was relatively small but it was very clean and quiet. I'd stay in the same room again, no question. It's great being able to step out on your patio and right into the pool. The pool itself was very fun and the staff keeps it clean. It's not a lap pool, it's sort of a free form pool with some open spaces and some narrow channels. It's beautiful.

<Title>“Over Rated by People with Lower Expectations”
<Content>I am kind of disappointed not to the hotel initially but most of the fellow trip advisor reviewers who claimed this hotel to be "absolutely perfect", " dream", "out of this world" etc. Some peoeple have real low expectations I guess. This is simply a normal hotel with minimal service quality and old rooms. It works with nickel and dime philosophy. There are some good and some bad aspects to this hotel that charades to be a Boutique Hotel, which is nonetheless getting to be a motel. Believing all the super positive and over exaggerated reviews, we expected too much perhaps. The hotel: The online reservation was easy with help from Ms. Anna. Also, the check in (as well as check-out) was a piece of cake with a smiling front desk person. Nevertheless, bellboys at La Tortuga do not have the habit of at least offering to carry your luggage to your room after 10 hours of traveling, even if they are two small carry-ons. As we all know, even the most modest hotels have some sort of bellboy system that assists customers on this. This would not only improve service quality but also help the bellboy earn extra $10- 20 a day. I have seen the same thing happening to other new customers who were checking in later in the week. The room was absolutely old and run down, although clean (and kept clean as it should be in any other hotel). The bathroom/shower was old and almost rusty (but clean). The size of the room was no bigger that a medium size bathroom, although we do not complain about the size at this point. Hotel is relatively small and cramped but no complaints on this as well. Bar is placed I between the pool shower, restaurant entrance, and stairs that goes up to the rooms. I would suggest owner to place the bar to the hidden but gorgeous roof top or all the way back under the trees so drinkers can have more privacy and guests can walk to their rooms with avoiding shouldering drinking fellow guests. Pity that the hotel is trying its best to skim dime from customers. The pool table, which is right next to the bar, is pay-as-you-play. You need to put in 5 pesos (50 US cents) to play a game. Besides the low cost, main issue is the fact that pool table which is part of the hotel amenity should be free to hotel guests to use. This only gives this hotel a truck-stop quality at the gain of several 50 cents. After seeing this, we decided not to spent a dime in this hotel and went out to eat and drink in local establishments (luckly). The hotel lost several hundred dollars of business just because it was trying to get 50 cents from guest by charging to use the pool table. To many, this may not be an issue, but for us, this issue is a good indication of quality for this hotel. The pool look gorgeous visually, but it is not very functional as it is narrow and non-continues if you like to swim around. But as we observed, the stuff spent good time to try to keep it clean as it is under several large trees. There are several good aspect to this hotel, well mainly one: the breakfast. Unlike some other complaints, the menu is sufficient; service is proper as it should be. This is not Dennys and you cannot have all you can eat breakfast in a hotel. The room was cleaned on time, as it should. AC worked, as it should. Water pressure and temperature were right, as they should. Mamita’s Beach Club: The free beach club is about a mile walk, but no complaints again, it is a good opportunity to see around and discover if you take the 10th avenue rather that the tourist trapping 5th. 10th avenue is the one that you will exit when leaving the hotel. There are several hidden restaurants, eateries that are not overpriced and serviced well. The beach club opens early, if you like to get beach chairs with umbrellas (which is a must in Playa’s heat) go there before 10, or even 9:30 am. The food and drink service, if you order while on the beach is very slow with low quality of menu, but high prices comparable to New York City. (See my playa review to learn about new Playa del Carmen of 2007, as cost and low quality is a major problem in Playa del Carmen today). If you like to eat during the lunch while at Mamitas, lay towels on your beach chairs (no worries, no one is going to steal them) and go to the next beach clubs restaurants called “Kool” on the left to eat as food Is not free in both places. Kool has excellent service and lower prices with greatest selection. Mamitas has separate section called ‘lounge” on the right side which is not free for hotel guests and staff will try to charge you anywhere between 20 to 40 USD. This part is supposed to be cooler section with “hype” Mexico City fellows. In final, I would say following: This hotel has nothing extra ordinary to offer. The photos on its website is very “Photoshopped” as rooms are old. It does not even have minimal quality understanding to assist its checking customers to carry their carry-ons (like Motel 8). Paying 50 cents to play to Hotels own pool table is cheap cheap cheap. La Tortuga is a less than average hotel/motel with no quality, no extraordinary service and facilities. About Playa: This is our second time in Playa. Playa is getting very expensive. It is fine that it is getting expensive as it is getting popular. But in contrast, the quality of service is falling down as well. If Playa is as expensive as New York City, it should offer facilities in comparison to NYC. Nevertheless, most of the 5th avenue restaurants have been typical expensive tourist traps. Fortunately, you can find good eateries on 10th avenue priced from $4 to $24. Best low cost eateries are Mr. Kiwi and Doctor Taco with excellent tacos unlike you have ever tasted in the USA. Mr. Kiwi has super large T-bone steaks for less than $8. Yes both places are pretty simple and local looking but they are also very original-Playa and safe as well. Both places are on the left when exiting the hotel and great for lunch and late, late dinners. On the left of the hotel, on 10th again, about quarter mile down, try Parillo Argentin steakhouse, which is a nice and small place to have some of the best steaks you can have ever. Prices ranges from $9 to $22, with bottle Mexican table wine for $14, try the chorizo appetizer. Also not on 10th avenue but 10th street, do not miss the famous Babe’s Thai restaurant with great food and $3.5 UDS margaritas and mojitos, which are very well made. Again service is great, get a seat on the bar and eat and drink there if possible. Also, AVOID “Los Rancheros” restaurant on 5th Avenue horrible food and non-English speaking waiters who took your orders wrong and try to charge you for it. I hope my long review may help some new visitors to Playa. Thanks..

<Title>“Birthday Memories to last a life time.”
<Content>I have stayed at this hotel 2 years ago and had an excellent experience, so I brought a group of 11 people this time for a surprise 40th birthday. Anna and the rest of the staff worked with me for months organizing the rooms and hiring drivers and recommending restaurants. We even came back to unexpected birthday decorations in our room one day that the hotel did for us. It made us feel very special. Questions were quickly answered and Anna was a saint to put up with all my emails. The new renovations were fantastic! The pool and pool area were enlarged quite a bit with a new jacuzzi added. The whole courtyard was absolutely beautiful. It seemed so much more spacious and private. You would never know that Shangri La was merely steps away from the quaint area of shops and restaurants. And in our case, after a lot of Tequila, it made for a short stumble home. If you're like me and prefer smaller hotels with personal service, this is the place!!!

<Title>“We only wished we had stayed longer”
<Content>Where to start? After months of reading reviews, looking at warm locations, and researching numerous hotels I decided on La Tortuga. I had never been to Playa Del Carmen only to the other side of Mexico ( Puerto Vallarta). Playa Del Carmen was so beautiful it was breathtaking. The hotel is one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed in, ( I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton on numerous occasions). It was even more quaint and beautiful than I have imagined. Down to basics, The room. We stayed in room 117. A king size suite with a jacuzzi hot tub. It was not a swim up room but it was 2 feet from the pool to our patio. The room had a large king size bed, and yes, the bed was hard, however, we slept at least 10 hours peacefully every night. The air conditioning for my boyfriend was wonderful. He loves having it cranked and they keep an extra blanket in the closet for those who don't like it quite as cold. The new suites are very hip and modern in my opinion. We also had a jacuzzi tub in our bathroom that we did not use. There is a place to hang your clothes and also a suitcase rack to put one suitcase. The room is not very big however, you have a cute patio with 2 chairs and a hammock to lay in and watch the gorgeous pool, and vegetation. The rooftop was awesome. We had numerous evenings that we used the jacuzzi. I brought bath bubbles from home for the full effect. The hotel is very convenient. We were so close to everything however, the way it is designed we never felt closed in or too close to allot of people. The staff here is WONDERFUL! They were so genuinely nice and helpful on all occasions. Anna was wonderful on email, our transporation was set up through the hotel and was $80.00 round trip. It was nice for us traveling there for the first time to not have to worry about getting to Playa Del Carmen. The driver was on time on both occasions. We had our room made up every day along with turn down service at night including ice cold bottled water left on our bed. Our favorite part of the day was happy hour... We planned our day around 5 pm. My boyfriend drank beer I drank fabulous mojitios. At 5pm drinks are buy one get one free... The bar does get alittle busy around 5pm and it gives you a chance to interact with other guests if you like. Most guests seem to be in couples and there just to relax and have a good time. There is also beer stocked in your hotel bar, for $2.00 a beer. You can go purchase beer at almost any little store for a $1.00 a beer, however, it is quite convenient to have it stocked for you. The pool is beautiful along with the vegetation surrounding the pool area. There are about 6 lounging chairs along with grass or bridges to sit on around the pool. There is also a bed in the shade that we would read books on when returning from the beach and needing shade. There is a lounge area a few steps up from the pool that they call the solarium. It is furnished with comfy sofa like laying places and big umbrellas. There is a jacuzzi in the pool area that we never used due to our own private jacuzzi. You can check your email or reseach on line trips. I have to admit that I was happy to never check my email while there. The Beach: O.k. I am one who likes to be beachfront on vacation however, I didn't mind it in Playa. It is about a 10-15 minute walk which is great after breakfast when I am so full.... We always walked down to 5th avenue and went through the quaint streets. At the hotel they give you beach towels every day along with a pass to MAMITAS BEACH CLUB. The beach is so GORGEOUS.!!! Just stupid how blue the water is. After reading many reviews, I always worried about getting chairs with an umbrella and we always had one. We were never later than 10am. You must get an umbrella, it is too hot to sit in the sun all day. We had drinks from MAMITAS every day, it gets very hot and you want drinks. Make sure to bring cash because they do not take credit cards. We also had a snack there one day. Nothing to write home about but pretty cheap and decent. Food: I think we are kinda light eaters.At the hotel the breakfast every morning was huge and I always felt so full... The pancakes are great. Fresh fruit with yogurt was one of my favorites also. I ordered a ham and cheese baguette one morning and it is literally a sub with mayonnaise. My boyfriend ate it and I ate his pancakes. I did order a strawberry shake one morning which was additional but I wanted to try it, quite good.... Ask about the MAYAN Omelette, our waiter enjoyed explaining it. We never ate lunch at the restaurant. For dinner we had shrimp and chicken fajitias. HUGE PORTIONS and they came with french fries, very good.... Also we loved their calamari. We also had the bruschetta which was good. I ordered a salad one night with pears and gorgonzola cheese, did not like the balsalmic dressing, too much honey or something weird in it. Out to eat: 5th avenue was overwhelming for me. Trying to decide to eat. We ate at an Italian restaurant one evening and it was not good at all and more expensive than it was worth. I would probably stick to places that are busy and serving mexican food. Our last night I demanded that we go to HC Monterey because I had read numerous reviews about it. It was our BEST MEAL of the trip. It is alittle far, so we took a cab there and walked home. For $9.00 you get amazing flank steak, baked potato, half an avocado and a pepper. I was so full, it is alot of food. We also had corona's. The waiters only speak spanish and the menu is only in spanish, however, it is well worth going off the beaten path to get. The only excurision we took was XEL-HA. We LOVED IT! The only thing we didn't love was buying the $16.00 environmentally safe sunscreen lotion and still getting burnt. I would recommend trying to buy something in the states or on 5th avenue that is o.k. However, if we were going away I would probably just spray 30 on me very heavily before leaving the hotel. You are in the water and sun all day long. We took public transporation to XEL-HA for $4.00 a person each way. The bus station was clean and easy to take about a 45 minute ride. Also, MAKE SURE You buy an water camera for the day. I am not sure how much they normally are, however, they are expensive at the park and you really will want one. I didn't swim with the dolphins due to the $$ price. For an all day pass inclusive, which I highly recommend it was $60.00 to swim with the dolphins for 1/2 hour it is $80.00 a person. On our next trip we HAVE to go to the Ruins along with a trip to Cozumel. We stayed 5 nights and it just wasn't long enough to see everything and feel relaxed at the same time. All in all, I am sure that we will be back to Playa staying at the La Tortuga Hotel. My boyfriend and I agreeded it was the best vacation we had ever had. If you have any questions about Playa or La Tortuga please feel free to drop me a note. If you are going to La Tortuga, please have a happy hour drink for me:)

<Title>“Loved It”
<Content>We arrived in Playa with no reservations so that we could walk around and see the different hotels before making a decision. On the first night we stayed at Las Palapas in a beach front cabana. It was beautiful, but the European atmosphere was not our style. The next day we visited several hotels near Fifth Avenue and on the beach. We chose La Tortuga because the pool was beautiful and the room that we were shown was cozy and clean. Our intentions were to stay at a couple of different hotels during our ten day visit, but after checking out a few more hotels, we decided that we liked La Tortuga the most. Due to other folks' reservations we changed rooms a couple of times in order to stay the entire length of our vacation. Each time we changed rooms the incredibly friendly staff placed our luggage in the new room while we went on excursions during the day. The breakfast was excellent, especially the baguettes and hotcakes, and the poolside bar made the most sinfully tasting banana daquiries. The attentive staff was always helpful and made us feel at home. We will definitely return!!!

<Title>“A little bit of heaven...”
<Content>LaTortuga is a three-star hotel with four-star service. It is one of the smaller, boutique hotels built prior to the large, mega-resorts that have recently taken over the Maya Riviera coast. This is the perfect antidote to civilization...a fantastic place to relax in warm, friendly ambience and soak up the sun. La Tortuga is just around the corner from 5th Avenue shops, restaurants and bars, but otherwise in a quiet town location. Most rooms overlook the beautiful tropical garden/pool area. Pleasant new age music plays as you loll in your own private corner of the pool or relax on one of the sun beds while the efficient staff quietly goes about their job of keeping the pool area spotless, or serving tropical drinks and delicious food in the adjacent Agora bar/restaurant. I ate most of my meals here because it was elegant in an unpretentious way, the food was delicious and the service very friendly and attentive. Why go elsewhere? I did opt for pizza one night at Pizza Pazzo as I was just too filled up after all those huevos rancheros breakfasts with homemade bread and fresh squeezed juice and dinners with homemade tortilla chips and tangy pico di gallo to snack on while waiting for the main course. The 15% discount offered to hotel guests was a definite plus. The Itza Spa is on the premises, a good place to detox in the sauna or vapor lodge, get a great massage (Gina is the best!), or an elaborate beauty treatment. I love small homey hotels and with the added convenience of Agora restaurant and Itza spa, you can't go wrong at La Tortuga. This hotel is perfect for couples or single travelers who are seeking a tranquil, aesthetic atmosphere. BTW - try the mango margaritas...pure bliss!!

<Title>“Spa Like Hotel”
<Content>The hotel, its beautiful central garden, patio, bar and pools made the place like amini oasis and some where you want to come back and relax after a day in the sun. In the after noon they have happy hour 2 drinks for one and I would get a plate of mangos and chill out by the pool. Breakfast and beach club access were in the nightly rate which was a great value. The only thing I did not like was the food that we had for lunch the very first day. I guess besides breakfast they are not very big on food. Then again there are tons of resturants around.

<Title>“Absolutely Lovely....about as perfect as you can get!”
<Content>To all my fellow traveler's- My wife and I stayed at this hotel May 04 - May 10, 2007. I thank all those reviews before mine in as it solidified our choice. Before our arrival, I corresponded with Anna on several occasions. She was very prompt in returning my emails and answered all my questions. We flew into Cozumel and took the ferry to Playa. This, I must say is more convenient then flying into Cancun and then taking the $80 for two people round trip shuttle. It cost us about $5 for a taxi to the Cozumel Ferry and then it was $10 per person on the ferry. Not only was it a neat 30 minute ride, when you get off the boat, LA TORTUGA is about a 10 minute walk or 1 minute taxi ride away. Simply put, everyone working at La Tortuga and Agora's (hotel restaurant) were delightful and were genuinely concerned about making our experience that much more comfortable. The only drawback was Silvia (front office). She was not so friendly as everyone else was. Some employees who really went out of their way were Santy and Armado in Agora's restauarant. ROOM: We stayed in 206. The room was plenty big. It had a king size bed and a balcony that overlooks the tropical oasis type pool. They provide most toiletries. There is a closet to put your clothes but there is no dresser. Also in the room is a television with very few American channels and a small refrigerator that had sodas, water, and beer for a nominal charge. POOL: We spent a lot of time in the pool and hot tub. Absolutely Bliss. The tropical plants and trees, clear water, small water falls, top of line pool furniture, hot tub, cozy areas for shade and sun, Santy and Armado making sure our drink and food needs were met, open aired lobby, tiki torches and the different bird calls all made this a very tranquil place. Simply put. AGORA RESTAURANT: Breakfast that is included consists of a menu item, bread, coffee and juice. This will fill you up. The food as pictured tasted great. We had lunch a couple of times. It was delivered right to your lounge chair by Santy or Armado. The restaurant has very reasonable prices and large portions. Detail and presentation were top notch. MAMITAS BEACH CLUB: Another nice touch about La Tortuga are the free beach passes. You get beach lounge chairs and a palapa umbrella. You will need the palapa as it gets brutal in the sun all day. Waiters deliver food and drink to your chairs for a somewhat reasonable price. The menu hasn't changed for several years now. Now, if there is a drawback, it would be the walk. It is a good 15 minutes away from La Tortuga. I personally enjoyed the exercise but there are some that would find it difficult. But then again Playa Del Carmen is a city that you can walk to everything. SPA ITZA: Of all the massages that I have received, the one I received here was by far the best. The spa has very reasonable prices. Don't forget the one time 10% discount you get when staying at La Tortuga. MORE NOTABLES: Pay attention to all the detail and decor in this hotel. Its really amazing. For light sleepers such as myself, there is a club one street over that starts playing some music at 1 am and continues to 6 am. There is so much more to say about the hotel and playa but go experience it for yourself. Email me if you have any questions or need advice.

<Title>“Lots to like”
<Content>My boyfriend and I (we are 56 and 49) just had a great week in Playa Del Carmen, staying at the La Tortuga. The hotel is in a convenient location - one block from the "Quinta" - the main shopping street. So, it was quieter, which we liked. We were very happy with the onsite restaurant, where we had breakfast every morning. One menu item, coffee and a beverage is included with with your room, other items are extra - which the waiters remind you of. All staff were friendly and tried to help us with our Spanish, though most knew enough English to get by. There is also a small, cozy bar between the restaurant and the rooms where you can get an early morning cup of coffee, have a cocktail (they make excellent Mojitos) or get on the internet. We also had some lunches and two dinners at the restaurant. The best thing about La Tortuga was the pool. The hotel does not look like much from the outside, but when you enter - you walk down an open air walkway that leads to a courtyard where the pool is the central feature. The pool has several deep areas, connected by narrow, deep river-like smimming areas. There are lovely walkways - either made of stone or teak - and a hot tub in the middle. The only down side of the hotel is its proximatey to the beach. The hotel is a member of beach club "Mamitas," which I think was the best beach in the area. However, it is a good 7 blocks away. So, if you don't mind the walk, the beach is very nice. Get there by 10:00 if you want to reserve beach chairs with an umbrella. If you come a hair past 10:30, only chairs in the blazing sun are left. Lastly, save some time at the end of your stay for a massage at the adjoining "Spa Itza." My boyfriend and I booked together and ended up having our treatments in the same room, which was pretty nice. Go at least a half hour early and enjoy the roof top sauna. We only had enough time for 10 minutes in the sauna. If we were to go again, we would have gotten in the sauna, stepped outside and cooled off in the rooftop shower, and stepped back in the sauna again. There seems to be a small rooftop sweat log that we did not use. Have fun. Thoroughly enjoyed it and would go back. Perhaps not for the young who want to be in a hipper part of Playa.

<Title>“Absolutely loved La Tortuga”
<Content>Our 2 week stay was absolutely perfect. I was expecting it to be good having read so many great reviews, but it surpassed all expectations. The room 117, a junior suite with a rooftop jacuzzi. The bed was huge and very comfortable, the bathroom was delightful, with a huge tub and great powerful shower. The pool was just 2 steps from our terrace, I am sure this must be the best room in the place. The staff were all fabulous, front desk, restaraunt, bar, maids, all were constanty smiling, and very thorough, clearly happy to please... I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough, we definitely made the right decision. The location also was excellent. There is not a single bad thing I could say. I would stay again in a shot. Totally loved it. Thanks everyone

<Title>“The best place to honeymoon in Playa!”
<Content>We had an incredible stay in Playa del Carmen, thanks to La Tortuga. The location is perfect! The landscaping and vegetation around the pool are stunning - very natural. The breakfasts (which are included) were superb! The bar is fantastic - they have a very skilled bartender. Everyone there made the experience very personal for us, with special details acknowledging our honeymoon, yet - we also had plently of privacy in the Junior Master Suite, complete with in-room jacuzzi! They even saw us off when we departed. If you want to stay at a lovely, clean, quiet, adorable hotel with wonderful staff and great food, do not hesitate to book your stay at Hotel La Tortuga!

<Title>“Relaxing Getaway”
<Content>My Husband and I had a much needed escape without the kiddo recently and loved staying at La Tortuga. We stayed in the small room, but had no problem with the size. It fit into the budget and was clean and well kept. We were hardly in the room with the beautiful grounds and bar area. We had a minor problem with bugs - however the manager immediatly transferred us to a new room. The service was wonderful and the pool was immaculate. We loved the generous breakfast (absolutely perfect - mexican style eggs and chilaquiles) and the happy hour was a nice touch. With such a large breakfast, we hardly had a need for lunch! The pool was a nice sanctuary to return to after a fun day at the beach. I would definately stay here again.

<Title>“Heaven?”
<Content>Playa is an excellent place on the planet. La Tortuga a jewel. The staff was so excellent, I wish they were still around, non-obtrusive, yet attentive. The room was nice, large, had an indoor/outdoor hottub. The pool was luxurious, I loved swimming throught the "tunnels". The beachclub was excellent, and to get there you got a nice walk throught cool streets with nice shops and resturants. The hotel resturant prepaired a mahi mahi some new fellow Texan friends of ours we met there caught deep see fishing. Most excellent fish I"ve ever tasted. Anna was excellent and J.C. thank you, man, you really did help us! We will stay again and again as long as they'll have us for sure.

<Title>“Very satisified with La Tortuga Hotel”
<Content>Just returned from a week long stay at La Tortuga, and am happy to say that we enjoyed it very much. The best part is it's location...you can walk pretty much everywhere. The staff are terrific...very happy and helpful. For example, we found the beds very hard and when we asked them for assistance, they put extra blankets on the matress in order to make them softer. It wasn't perfect, but was 'less hard". They did the best they could, which we appreciated. The common areas at La Tortuga are wonderful. We really enjoyed relaxing by the pool and catching up on emails in the evening in the bar area. The breakfast every morning was very good, and the service was great. The only disappointment we had was the actual rooms themselves. We booked a junior suite w/rooftop jacuzzi. Well, this was not a "suite" by our normal standards. The room had two queen beds and that's about it. No place to sit...except on the balcony. The rooftop jacuzzi was "underwhelming" as well. We looked at a couple other rooms, thinking we might change rooms, but they were just as small and bare, so we stayed put. It was fine overall, but not what we were expecting. While there we ate at an offbeat restaurant that served the best flank steak we ever ate. It's called HC Monterey. You must eat there...truly an experience. We also had some spa services. Good services and prices! Enjoy your trip to Playa Del Carmen!

<Title>“NIce little hotel”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at La Tortuga for a week. We chose the hotel b/c he's a big fan of small, boutique hotels (read $$$), but I'm a fan of a bargain, so after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor, this Tortuga seemed like a good compromise. Happily, we were both fairly satisfied. We didn't get off to an auspicious start as we arrived well after midnight on our first night. The staff was not there and we were greeted by security. They did not know where our room was and we schlepped our heavy luggage around the entire place only to eventually end up in a room right off the reception area! The room (#116) was large and modern, but it also seemed unfinished. There was no dresser or luggage stand--no place to put our luggage excpet the floor. A small flat screen floated in the middle of a huge wall. The room was also dark and right next to the staff room and restaurant (as we discovered the next morning being awakened by the noise). But, we were exhausted after a long flight delay and a ridiculous experience with Mexican immigration, so we went to bed. After, a nice breakfast, we explained the situation to Benjamin and he arranged for us to have a different room. It was smaller and on the outside of the hotel (street noise), but it had great light, enough furniture to be complete and we still had a roof-top jacuzzi. All in all, the staff was very nice, especially the restaurant staff, and we loved coming back from the beach to find a different towel creation and chilled water by the bed. We would definitely recommend getting a junior suite--the privacy of a personal terrace and jacuzzi was relaxing and romantic. The management really seems to be intent on keeping the place up and continuing to invest in the property. And the price is great. Some of the other boutique places we looked at were up to US$600 per night!! The location is great (one block from 5th) and central, so you can walk either way for shops and restaurants. Mamita's was a nice beach and the walk didn't bother us at all. The attached restaurant served good food and offered good prices. The complimentary breakfast was really good, with lots of choice. There aren't a ton of chairs around the pool, but the solarium is very nice (cool lounge fixtures--my high-end bfriend was impressed) and the pool is only a few steps away. This is not a luxury place, if that's what you're looking for, but it is a great bargain, well-kept, comfortable, clean, well-located, relaxing and low-key. We would definitely recommend it for those reasons. The only negative experience--do not purchase tour packages from the hotel. There is a HEFTY mark-up as we discovered later. You're better off walking into one of the tour places on 5th (we liked Odyssey) and buying directly. You get the exact same tour with the exact same tour operators for at least 20% less.

<Title>“La Tortuga”
<Content>We just got back from a trip to Playa. We have always stayed at the all inclusive resorts (Riu Palace) before so we decide to try something different after reading the good reviews. We loved the hotel. We were very impressed by the helpful staff and the great service. The pool and grounds are really neat and we enjoyed spending a couple of days not leaving the hotel. Rooms were small but clean. Breakfast was really good and convenient. The location is great as well. We stayed in two different rooms ( b/c of availability). I would suggest trying to get a room that is quiet. The first room was a standard that faced the street. It was very loud at night. The next room we stayed in was facing the pool which was much more quiet. This was a great experience and we will definitely reccommend this hotel to anyone and probably stay there again.

<Title>“Amazing time in PDC at La Tortuga”
<Content>This March, staying at La Tortuga was the best idea ever. My husband and I have always stayed at huge All inclusive hotels and this was our first time staying somewhere this intimate. When we got to the hotel the staff was very friendly and my husband planned an anniversary surprise for me. They decorated the room with fresh flowers and a bottle of wine. The pool was beautiful but the area isn't very sunny. If you want a spot in the shade get a chair early since it is so limited. The beach club was nice as well. (Guys will like it, lots of topless women) It wasn't that far of a walk, (maybe 10 min) but we rented a scooter and got there in less than 2 minutes. Scooters are a great mode of transportation there because you can park anywhere and drive it right up to many resturants. If you stay at La Tortuga don't be cheap and get a standard room. We stayed in one of the new junior suites with a jacuzzi in it. I would seriously recommend that since the outside jacuzzi is always crowded, and with your own jacuzzi there is no need to wear a bathing suit =) The room was huge and brand new, we couldn't have been happier. I heard that the standard rooms and even swim rooms were smaller so stay in a junior suite. I would def. recommend our room #118... it was so private and right next to the pool. The food at the restuartant was very good, but take advantage of all the amazing restuarants on fifth ave, which is only a block away. Bernando at the front was so helpful, as was everyone else. My husband wasn't feeling to good one night and they actually went to the drug store for us... I couldn't have asked for better service. After staying at La Tortuga I would love to go back without a doubt. If your like me and have never stayed at a small, intimate hotel before, I bet La Tortuga will change your mind about it.

<Title>“Two great weeks, wish it were longer!”
<Content>We have just returned for a two week stay at La Tortuga Hotel and our only complaint was that two weeks was not long enough. The hotel is a delightful place. The common areas are exceptional with a courtyard and pool area lush with tropical foliage and many options for sitting or lounging to suit your every mood. Beach towels for the pool or the beach are readily available throughout the day. The small bar in the courtyard is a great place for a casual chat or to use the free internet. An excellent restaurant, Agora, is on the premises. The menu is extensive, the waiters are cheerful and efficient and the coffee is strong, hot and plentiful. Complimentary breakfast is served there every morning. This is a very well staffed facility. The pool, courtyard and common areas are being cleaned and serviced throughout the day by a very friendly and attentive staff. The front desk staff are exceptionally welcoming and make every effort to make your trip to Playa and their hotel a memorable one. The hotel is situated a block off 5th avenue so access to shops, bars and restaurants is convenient but you are away from the noise and crowds. We had a standard room and it was a bit small but since there were so many public areas to spend time in, it wasn’t a problem. We had a balcony overlooking the courtyard and in the evenings we would come back to our room and find fresh towels, water bottles on the nightstands and our lights on to welcome us back. We definitely plan on returning to this hotel.

<Title>“The Good and the Bad”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga for one week in Feb. '07 and I was VERY excited for our trip. We had visited in Dec. '05 and loved Playa Del Carmen and our hotel (The Blue Parrot). Unfortunately, we couldn't stay at the same hotel because they were booked, so instead I researched hotels on this website. Immediately, I was very excited to read the amazing reviews of La Tortuga. Hands down, it was/is one of the best reviewed hotels in Playa. It deserves some of the praise - nice pool/lounge area, Mamitos beach passes and amazing breakfast..... Now the bad.... When we walked into our room (standard, small balcony facing pool) I was a little put off by the small size, but it wasn't that bad. What was really inconvienent was there wasn't a dresser or anything to unpack your suitcase. There was a small closet with one shelf, but that's it. We had to live out of our suitcases all week. Also, and this is minor, I had ordered a bottle of champagne for our check-in because this was a special vacation. When we got in the room, the champagne was warm in an empty bucket. I had to call for a bucket of ice and then wait a couple hours to have it chilled. So far, minor issues by my standards. After all, it's a vacation! Next though, we took a shower and the entire bathroom flooded because the shower curtain was old and small and didn't even reach the ground. We had to use all the towels in the room just to soak up the flood. At this point, I asked the front desk if we could maybe switch rooms or upgrade and she said she didn't have anything else all week. (To their credit, they replaced the shower curtain the next day and it kept about 80% of the water in the shower - which was a big improvement.) We decided to just go with the flow but then after dinner the second night we went back to our room only to open the door and have a HUGE cockroach greet us. Yeah, I wasn't happy - at all. As the rest of the week progressed, other minor things were annoying. For instance, in order to adjust the airconditioner you have to climb on the refrigerator. Also, because we were in a standard room, we were the last ones to get our daily housekeeping. We would come home from the beach at 4pm and our room still wasn't cleaned. Each day after the beach we had to go get clean towels at the front desk and then rush to take a shower so we could leave the room around 5PM for them to clean - really inconvienent. As I mentioned, on the good side - the place is cute and the staff is pleasant and as accomodating as they can be. That being said, we won't be back. Too many cons and not enough pros!

The recent expansion of the grounds compelled us to, for the first time, spend an entire day lounging by the pool rather than at the beach. It was an oasis! We loved the beautiful layout of the hotel, the very friendly and knowledgeable staff (Saul, Bernardo, Anna etc etc), the terrific breakfast at Agora (the hotel's restaurant), the interesting "towel animals" that greeted us in our room every day, and our frequent walks through the heart of Playa en route to the beach or simply wandering around after dinner. Some folks don't like the walk thru town to the beach - we look forward to it. Slightly softer beds would be the only improvement that comes to mind. Note: We had pulled our proverbial hair out trying to make a reservation for part of our stay at another local hotel that is reputed to have ~4 "quiet rooms" and ~40 "regular, i.e. near the disco, rooms". Amazingly, the manager (owner?) of that hotel would only record our preference for a quiet room, but not guarantee one way or the other whether we could get one. He told me that everyone requests a quiet room, which we took to mean that we would have a 10% chance of actually getting one(!). After this experience it was a relief/pleasure to call La Tortuga and be told immediately the exact room that would be held for us.

<Title>“Best accomodations ever.”
<Content>We have just returned from a week at the La Tortuga Hotel and Spa. The hotel was wonderful and we have never experienced such incredible service before. An example of the service was when one of the members of our family became very ill. The hotel went out of their way to call a Doctor to the hotel and to make arrangements for this person to be transported to the hospital. The entire staff at the hotel went out of their way to help us during this stressful time. Again, I have never experienced such concern from strangers before. Beyond this the hotel was very nice, clean and provided us with a very enjoyable experience. The hotel had a lovely pool area, they were close to the beach as well as shopping and eating areas. The cost of the room was very reasonable, under $100 per night which included breakfast. There is no question about returning to this hotel in the future.

<Title>“Nice hotel in the heart of PDC”
<Content>Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at La Tortuga. The service in the hotel and adjacent resaurant was excellent and always friendly. The breakfasts served (and included in the price) were always very good and far better than one normally receives. The grounds and pool areas were as beautiful as the pictures suggest. The location of the hotel is also great...just a block off of 5th Ave. where there's a ton of shopping and dining choices available. If you don't want to do the all-inclusive thing, staying in town is great and affords the opportunity to try a variety of restaurants. Now for the downsides: The mattresses are REALLY firm (woke up every morning with back pain). Also, some of the rooms are near a fairly busy street...the traffic noise was somewhat bothersome. Finally, the beach club, while only about six blocks away, requires a bit of a walk. If you want to be on a beachfront property, I wouldn't suggest La Tortuga. Overall, however, we were very happy with our stay and really appreciated the attentive service.

<Title>“4 Couples from Montreal - Sweet Time”
<Content>We were 4 couples and we had booked back in August to stay 10 nights starting Feb. 19th/07. I must say that for us our experience was exceptional. True some found the beds a little hard and the disco down the block was annoying, but after the 2nd night we settled in and all was good. We kept the AC on at night and shut the bathroom door to keep out the faint boom boom you could pick up while sleeping. This hotel was exactly right for us and we would go back in a heartbeat. We enjoyed the convenience of having the Agora restaurant right next door, it was as though it was part of the hotel. Daniel and Armando were there each day to get our day started with a great choice breakfast menu. They also went back and forth to the bar for us while we relaxed by the pool or the hot tub. The service was exceptional, front desk were always doing their absolute best to keep the guests "happy" - after all they would like you to return. However, it is impossible to achieve that with everyone. We are not big beach folks so the location of this hotel was perfect. Just a 1 minute stroll to 5th Ave and a 15 minute stroll to Mamitas Beach Club. We paid the extra dollars a couple of days and enjoyed the facilities next door at "Kool" beach club. We purchased the Playa Deal Card and found that for 10 days it was worth it. With the exception of Le Sur Restarant, we had no problems with the card. We enjoyed meals at Mannies Beergarten, Chicago Don Juan, Babe's Noodle Bar, Playa Maya Beach Bar just to name a few. Also used it at the SPA next to the hotel for a couples massage. The ladies who looked after the rooms worked very hard and did an excellent job. Beunos Dias to Sylvia, lovely lady, always had a smile and kept our room spic and span. Bernardo, Alex, JC, Jessica, Anna and Sylvie thanks again for taking care of us and doing a great job running the hotel. Hope to see you soon

<Title>“An Oasis in Paradise”
<Content>My wife and I were looking for a relaxing short vacation with plenty to do should we choose. Playa del Carmen fit the bill perfectly. We also wanted a small boutique hotel just outside all the action, Hotel La Tortuga was perfect. It's location, one block off 5th ave (the main tourist street) made it convient to everything but just far enough away that we weren't disturbed. Our room was clean, although a bit small, and the lazy river style pool came right up to our private patio. The small room doesn't matter much as any time we spent in the room, was on the patio overlooking the lush courtyard and pool. The restaurant in the hotel was excellent although we chose to explore the town for most meals. The white sand beach is a mere 10 minute walk as is all the action; bars, restaurants, shops etc of 5th avenue. If you are looking for a relaxing vacation with a little fun mixed in, Playa del Carmen is the place for you. Although there are several smaller hotels in town, I can't imagine any one being more perfect the La Tortuga.

<Title>“Loved the Hotel!!”
<Content>My husband and I were in Playa for a friend's wedding and stayed at Hotel la Tortuga for 5 nights. Playa is not where we would have chosen to visit in Mexico, we tend to avoid touristy destinations and so we wanted to find a place that was not directly on the main ped mall. La Tortuga was exactly what we were looking for, close to everything but not on top of the action. We thought the hotel was absolutely gorgeous. The grounds were very well maintained, the unheated pool was clean and refreshing, the staff were friendly and helpful, and the free breakfast was a great value. I was very pleased with the prompt email responses I got from the office prior to my arrival- they are very organized and were willing to accommodate our requests. We booked a swim up room (#112) and it was very private. Unlike some of the other rooms in the hotel, we thought it was a decent size. One critique I would make is that the room itself lacked character, bare walls, no music, and white bedding, I guess the hotel spends most of it's income on maintaining the grounds. Other than that the bed was comfortable enough and housekeeping came twice daily leaving fresh towels each time and water for the evening. We always had hot water, good water pressure, and plenty of counter space in the bathroom. The hotel tended to attract a more mature clientèle, mostly couples, definitely not a party scene. There were comfortable sun chairs around the pool (but limited sun due to the lush landscaping) and a terrific roof deck with elegant, luxurious, round, reclining sun beds. Although I did not sample the spa personally, a few of my friends had a wonderful experience there. We were pleasantly surprised by how much we liked the place. We'd definitely go back if we're ever in Playa again.

<Title>“Great little hotel”
<Content>La Tortuga is a great boutique hotel situated off of the main strip of Playa del Carmen. We stayed for 5 days and it was our first trip to PDC. After much research, we settled on La Tortuga after reading some of the great reviews on this site. As for my comments, I'll be to the point: Pros: 1. Spectacular staff!!! Everyone was helpful and attentive to our needs before and during the stay. 2. Gorgeous upkeep of the hotel...the maid came in (after we left at like 10pm for dinner) to "re-make" our bed one night (after she had already cleaned it earlier in the day). We don't even know how the maid knew we had left for dinner, but it was nice to have the turndown service. 3. Great pool with hot tub in the middle 4. Breakfast is included in your price, and it is actually tasty!! Cons: 1. The hotel is directly adjacent to a major nightclub. We stayed on the third floor of the hotel, and it sounded as though the club was in our bathroom blasting music until 6am. On the other side, when you are on the first floor, you can't hear the club...so it may just depend on where you are in the hotel. Either way, it was extremely annoying and made it incredibly hard to sleep. 2. The beach club is a trek past other fantastic beach clubs. While the entire beach strip is GORGEOUS, it's kind of disappointing when you go 7 blocks (through like 3 other beach clubs), just to get to the one where you can sit on a chair for free. We were tempted to just rent a chair at a closer club. 3. The suites are significantly larger than the standard room, so you may want to consider that if you are booking. We tried repeatedly before our arrival to upgrade our room, but there weren't any available :(

<Title>“Good Value...would recommend it.”
<Content>We went to Playa to celebrate our 4th anniversary and stayed at La Tortuga in a standard room. Pro's: 1) Price (way less than rates in the US) 2) Free beach passes to Mamitas Beach Club, Free breakfast (which is really good) 3) GREAT service & friendly staff (unlike a lot of places/restaurants in Playa where we felt the service people were rude) 4) Very clean rooms 5) Nice pool 6) We have a soon-to-be 2 year old son, so nothing against kids, but it was VERY VERY nice to stay at a hotel that doesn't allow kids under 16. I enjoyed not hearing kids acting up or crying while we were celebrating a romantic getaway. Con's: 1) Bed wasn't very comfortable (I got used to it after the 1st night but my sensitve sleeping husband never could get used to it) 2) A bit of a walk to Mamitas Beach Club (we're young & active people, but it was hot and after a long day at the beach we didn't really like the longer walk back). Other: We didn't notice a problem with noise at all. In fact, we thought it was quiet. Like I said, my husband is a sensitive sleeper (who claims our cat wakes him up) and he didn't notice noise. One reviewer said they couldn't get wireless internet in their room. We couldn't at first either. My husband asked one of the staff for their network password (or something like that), which they gave to him. Then we had no problem accessing the internet on our laptop in our room. That said, we never saw a line for the computer by the bar and almost wished we hadn't messed with bringing our laptop. Mamitas is the best beach club in Playa. BUT, make sure you get there sometime in the morning....the sooner the better. If you go in the afternoon, they will be full. That happened to us one day, which made us mad because we couldn't use our free passes and had to go to another club and pay $6 each. It's better to go in the morning anyway before the sun gets too intense in the later afternoon. Waiters brought us margaritas and food (right to our umbrella!), and the prices were reasonable (cheaper than in the US). We didn't stay in one of the junior suites, but overall I'd say don't stay here if you're expecting luxury. If that's what you want, go stay in one of those fancy all-inclusive places. We like luxury but wanted to try different restaurants every night, and this place was certainly much more affordable. The pro's definitely outweighed the con's, and we would stay here again.

<Title>“Escape to Relaxation!”
<Content>We just returned from our first visit to Mexico! On a recommendation we went to Playa Del Carmen and chose La Tortuga based on the reviews seen here on TripAdvisor. The facilities are beautiful, clean and comfortable. We stayed in one of the new jacuzzi rooms tucked in the back. It was very clean, roomy and quiet. We always had fresh towels and clean floors. After several trips to the beach, keeping the sand out is nearly impossible, but they did an excellent job. The pool is beautiful and the breakfast is unbelivable. We were expecting continental, but we were able to order off a menu. This was great given we'd head to the beach and spend hours swimming and relaxing without needing to hunt down food. The staff was very helful, curtious and good for a few jokes. We even tried a restaurant off the beaten path on a recommendation from one of the staff and loved it (El Fogon). The only recommendation would be that although the beach club is wonderful, it is sometimes difficult to get lounge chairs on a goregous day when everybody is out early. We ended up renting next door so we could lay out. The staff said they would talk to the beach club regarding this and I believe they will as they were so kind. THANK YOU ALL!!!

<Title>“La Tortuga disappoints”
<Content>We booked La Tortuga based on their inviting website with lush pool and attached spa. The pool is indeed unique, but there were so many problems with this place I can't recommend it. 1. Noise. The poor guy who paid for a swim up room (on the interior of the hotel!) said it was noisy- imagine being on the street side. We could hear conversations on the street below because the windows are so thin, and the flow of traffic and drunks is never ending. 2. Linens/ Bedding. The bedspread looks 20 years old, the towels are rough and scratchy, and the mattress was hard as a rock. The pillows need help, too. 3. Ants. I know it's the carribean, (their excuse), but we didn't see them elsewhere in PDC, and it took 3 calls to get them to attend to them. I finally plugged the obvious hole they were using in the shower and they dissipated. 4. The breakfast. You get one hot drink, one cold, and a menu item. That's it. The quality is good, but the volume is low. 5. Room quality. The tilework was shoddy, the woodwork is cheap, and the bath hardware was confusing, (a blast of unintentional hot water on your sunburn isn't fun). 6. The safe. They charge you $1 per night for a lock and key. Really annoying to be nickeled and dimed. 7. Vouchers. To get breakfast, a towel, or go to the beach club, you have to go to the front desk and get a voucher every time. There are always people checking out in the morning, so you wait in line to get a stupid piece of paper. This is convenient for them, not me. Good stuff: The beach club they're associated with (Mamitas) is one of the best. These may sound picky, but we stayed 3 nights at Magic Blue across the street for virtually the same price, and every single one of these issues was non-existant. See my review on Magic Blue for details.

<Title>“La Tortuga is Great!”
<Content>We stayed for a week at La Tortuga. The week before our stay, I contacted the hotel for a restaurant recommendation for my husband's birthday. When we arrived, not only had they made the reservation, they had decorated the room! That is just on example of their exceptional attention to detail and service. We stayed in a junior suite with a roof-top jacuzzi. The room was very large with a separate staircase that went to a private roof deck. The jacuzzi is sort of an over-sized jacuzzi-bathtub, but nice. The next category down has tiny rooms. The property is very clean, the pool was nicely laid out, and the deck and the solarium were always comfortable and pleasant. The hotel is well located near 5th, so we walked everywhere. The transportation to the airport is worth it. They pick you up at the airport (even though our plane was 2 hours late) and take you back for your return. Two things that could be improved: the beds are rock hard! you do get used to it after a few days. The other issue is the beach club. La Mamita beach club is not a positive experience. We arrived a bit late (10 am) and we were told that chairs and umbrelllas are held until noon for people who arrive early. If they don't return to claim the chairs around 12:30, they are released to people waiting. Although we waited quietly, we forgot to bribe the beach monitor. Available chairs were given to a group that showed up at 12:30 and slipped him some money. The next minute a girl showed up - had some interaction with the beach chair monitor - and voila' - she had 4 chairs and an umbrella. We mentioned these problems to the La Tortuga, so they would know. We did not return to La Mamita. We did go next door to the Tukan club (which by the way has better service and nicer chairs) and had a very positive experience. My recommendation is to explore other options so you don't waste your time at Mamitas! Aside from Mamitas beach club, we would definitely stay at La Tortuga again. The staff is excellent - Juan Carlos (JC), Silvia, Anna and everyone else goes out of their way to be helpful and nice.

<Title>“Our annual visit to PDC”
<Content>My husband & I just spent our annual week in PDC. This is the first time at La Tortuga. We had room 310. It was nice. The grounds are pretty. Juan Carlos was the most friendly and helpful of the staff. This room is considered standard plus. Our balcony overlooked the pool and beautiful trees. The room was clean, we like the firm mattresses in Mexico, which is funny cuz we have a temperpedic style one at home. There was some construction noise in the morning, but it wasn't too bad. Something is being built next door to the hotel... The biggest disappointment we had is that their is no wireless signal in your hotel room. Since we were on the third floor, it was kinda inconvenient. You must go to the lobby to use your laptop. During our stay, we like searching for local info online for things to do and restaurants. We also like to listen to music off our laptop (smooth jazz) in our room. It is not possible at La Tortuga. They have a lone computer in the lobby/bar/common area, but everyone is always trying to use it. If you get on it, you feel like someone is breathing down your neck for their turn, so hurry up. The music in the bar/lobby could use some help. They play the same new age in the day and Puerto Rican salsa tape in the evening. I would have loved to listen to some Mexican artists when in Mexico. We would play pool listening to their tired tapes... the bartender didn't have much of a personality. It was quite hot the week we were there, and they would not turn the ceiling fans on in the bar/lobby unless we asked them to. ??? The water pressure was not the strongest in the shower, and the temperture would change throughout our showers. The safety depsoit box is on the small side. Your laptop will not fit inside. We have stayed at other hotels in PDC that do have larger safety boxes that can accomodate ours. This one also has a key as apposed to the electronic combination style. There is a $1 per day charge to use the safety box, which seems a little silly, nickle & diming. It should just be included. The breakfast served was excellent! You get one hot drink choice, one cold drink choice, and one hot entree. We loved the huevos rancheros and chilaquiles the best. Some of the juices are not fresh squeezed. The hotel location is central, right at Calle Corazon. But it is 7 blocks north to Mamita's Beach Club, and then about 2 blocks east to get to the beach. It is a bit of a hike, and part of it is with the sun beating down on you. We would be sweating by the time we arrived at the beach. The problem with the beach club is that many hotels participate in letting their guests use Mamita's. Hotel guests are limited to the blue & white lounge chairs, on the southern part of Mamita's. It didn't seem like their were enough lounge chairs to go around, much less umbrellas. Many people seemed to get there and 'reserve' their lounge chair early by putting their towels on them, and coming back later. So after your sweaty trek to the beach, you have to battle it out for a lounge chair and umbrella. On Saturday's and Sunday's, it is packed. You not only have tourists, but the locals enjoying their day off. Good Luck getting a lounge chair. We ended up paying to use the one's considered Mamita's Lounge, and the price was different each time! We like boutique hotels. This one is acceptable. There was a problem with Silvia at the front desk not checking names and letting other guests take our van back to the airport. We were in the lobby right at 4pm, our pick up time, for a 7pm flight. We had also been using the shower in the pool area to get ready, and Jessica had helped us get started with that, so they knew were en route to the airport. The other guests bus (the kind that makes stops at a few hotels before heading to airport) came a few minutes later and she tried to get them to take us to the airport, but the girl told them she had others to collect and couldn't get us there in time. Good thing I understand spanish! They ended up putting us in a taxi. Then we ran into a horrible accident about 6 kilometers from the airport. 5 fatalities. 307 was a parking lot. After some time, all traffic started crossing over to the southbound side of the highway! It was very scary, especially in a little taxi. The driver had to get out to pull some sticks and brush from under the taxi. Then we had to cross back over through the ditch to the correct side again! 4 wheeling in a Mexican taxi! Boy did I wish we were in our van! We just barely made our flight home due to this mistake made by the hotel. We got major attitude from the airline personnel checking us in for being late. The only reason we made our flight was bcuz it was running 35 minutes late. Even with this incident, I would still recommend the hotel. We might even stay there again next year...but I think we might be happier a little further north and closer to the beach. We travel quite a bit, and we are not high mainteneance. This is a basic kind of place. If you are looking for a wow factor you won't find it here. But it is clean, safe, centrally located, and the grounds are pretty.

<Title>“Very quaint but noise was still an issue”
<Content>La Toruga is a nice, quaint hotel. If you want a bit of luxury, this is probabaly not what you're looking for. We stayed in a swim up room... very small but kept clean. The people who work here clearly take pride in their work and maintain a a very neat place. People are right to rave about the breakfast. It really is very good and certainly one of the best I've ever had when compared to any hotel I've ever stayed in. My only issue had to do with noise. Maybe becuase we were on the ground floor, but the noise from the local disco continued every night we stayed until 4 am. I am a light sleeper and so the bass from the techno music kept me up most nights. Unfortunately, I couldn't wait to return to my home to get a good night sleep. This seems to be a prevalent problem in this area, although I admit one of my mian reasons for choosing La Tortuga was becuase I thought it would be it would be less noisy at night. Hopefull the management may be able to rectify this in the future.

<Title>“Wonderful stay at Tourtuga”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from a week in Playa del Carmen. We had a very relaxing vacation at La Tortuga. We took the $8 ADO bus from the airport and the hotel was within walking distance (approx 10 min walk) I enjoued staying on 10th ave. In years past we stayed at hotels on 5th ave and this was a nice change of pace, a little quieter and really in the middle of it all. The common areas of the hotel and the pool are beatifully manicured, there were always people sweeping and cleaning to keep it this way. The pool area was nice to relax by especially at dusk when the lights begin to come on. The hot tub in the middle of the pool was very rejuvinating at the end of a hard beach day. The staff was friendly and helpful. We had a bit of a slow down on check in, there was a small problem findidng our reservation which made us a little nervous, we had paid in full through pay-pal before arriving. But soon the reservation was found and we were told our room would be ready in a half hour or so, even though it was only 5 -10 minuets before official check in time of 3:00. Not really a problem, we just went down to 5th Ave and had a margarita. Once we returned we we finished up our checking in process to find that a safe box although included in the room is an additonal charge of $1US a day if you actually want to use it. We began to fear a snownball effect of charges but this was indeed the only one we came across. Again not a big problem for sure but it would have been nice to know about this ahead of time. Juan Carlos helped us to our room with our baggage and showed us how to use the safe and a/c etc. Our room was pretty small although that is what I was expecting with a standerd room. If you travel with alot of cosmetics it can be tricky to find a place to put you things. I consider myself a pretty light traveler and I was doing a bit of juggeling. We had a small balcony with privacy but no real view, this was a nice suprise, I was not expecting a balcony. Outside of our room was a small common area which helped alleviate the size of the room. Thoughout the hotel the common areas were nicely designed, inviting and clean A/C works great when you need it, Mini frige in the room and one bottle of water.The bed was very comforatble, and the breakfast was great. With a ticket you pick up at the front desk every morning you recieve your choice of hot and cold drink and one plate off the menu. The mamitas beach pass was nice to have, one of the best beaches in town.(10-15 min walk) You have to get there early to get a palapa and by early I mean before 9am. We arrived at 9 thinking we were deffinately getting a palapa but we actually had barely made it and grabbed one of the last ones up. Food is available but after the first day we enjoyed food and drinks at the next door beach club restaurant Kool. A little more expensive but worth it. While I'm on the food topic try out Los Delicious while you are in Playa. I think this place has the best margarita (great pina colada too). The food is some of the best we had and suprisingly affordable with a friendly staff. Located on 5th ave & calle 22 Overall I would recomend La tourtuga to you highly, if you can afford an upgraded room I think it would be worth it. I have stayed at 4 different hotels in Playa and this is one I want to go back to. Lovely hotel great location. Have fun!

<Title>“3rd trip -- better than ever!”
<Content>My husband and I made our third trip to Hotel la Tortuga and Playa del Carmen Feb. 3 - 10. We have never stayed anywhere else in Playa because we enjoy the location of the hotel and the friendly atmosphere. The employees -- from the housekeepers to the managers-- strive to keep their guests happy and are exceptionally friendly and helpful. On this trip, I saw the poolboy run out to the hot tub in the pouring rain to place plastic underneath and on top of a guest's towel and clothes so that they would not get wet. We stayed in one of the new rooms (#219) and appreciated the new, more modern look. The mattresses are still firm but are less hard than they used to be. The bathrooms have also been updated. Our room had a minibar and a flat screen TV, which are also new. We had several electrical problems, and these were addressed immediately by the staff. The best new additions are the expanded pool and the hot tub. The pool is in a lush garden, and you can completely forget you're in downtown PDC while you float in the pool and watch the butterflies flit by. We used the hot tub most evenings after coming home from the beach. We enjoyed making new friends (shout out to Alisa & Todd and Troy and Virginia!) in the hot tub and being served drinks from the bar. I do wish they would bring back Happy Hour, though! Some of our friends were staying late at the beach for 2-for-1s when they could have been back at La Tortuga with us! In short, it was another wonderful stay, and we are already planning to return next Nov. The atmosphere is unparalleled in PDC, and we would not willingly stay anywhere else.

<Title>“Great location!”
<Content>Really neat boutique type hotel. Very friendly front desk and very willing to help you. The pool area is so cool and very beautiful. Don't really see many people in the pool probably b/c it is mostly shaded through out the day. Great hot tub in the center of the pool area. We stayed in a swim up room and a suite with roof top jacuzzi. The swim up room is soooooo tiny, smallest room I've ever stayed in, yes it is nice to have pool right there, but the room really is too small. The suite was great with great views of the downtown. You can't beat the location, it is right there by everything, yet one block away so it is quiet. The beach club is about a 10 minute walk and on sunny days the chairs do get all taken, so keep that in mind if you want to be able to sit. Breakfast was good, slow on service, but great food.

<Title>“Wonderful time at La Tortuga”
<Content>My husband and I just returned yesterday from PDC where we stayed at the Hotel La Tortuga. This is a very nice, neat and clean property which has an excellent friendly staff. We loved being one block from 5th Avenue, close to all the restaurants, etc. but far enough away to not hear the partying crowds late at night. The passes provided to us to use at Mamita's Beach Club made each day a very relaxing day on a beautiful beach with excellent food and drink service. The pool at La Tortuga is a nice little winding pool with a new teak deck and a new jacuzzi which was nice to use in the cool evenings. We had a third floor room with a roof top jacuzzi which was very romantic. To fill the hot tub with warm water, start early as the water did run slow. On warmer evening using the cold and hot taps would help fill the tub faster. We usually do the all inclusive resorts so this was a different experience for us and we enjoyed it very much. We would return to this hotel for another stay in the future.

<Title>“The Turtle Hotel lives up to all expectations”
<Content>My best friend and I stayed at La Tortuga from December 30th - January 6th. I found La Tortuga solely by searching online and reading reviews.. reviews from THIS site and others. I chose the hotel because of what was already said by previous guests and it looked like a nice place with a good atmosphere and location. While some guests' reviews included complaints about construction noise, there was a constant theme of positive comments. Well here's MY review. Construction noise - It was a non-issue. Didn't hear or see anything (inside the hotel).. Playa as a town is growing rapidly so there's lots of construction elsewhere. The Room - We had a Standard Plus room with our balcony overlooking the pool ... 2 queens that at first felt firm but proved to provide some serious long sleeps (perhaps it was the long days of sun, heat and alcohol that assisted with the good sleeps too). A/C worked great! Our room had a good signal strength on the hotel's free wifi network so we could mess around on our laptops from our balcony. The pool and patios - not your average swimming pool.. it's a very creative custom designed pool like none other. The wood decking is very nice and the walk ways around the pools, patio and access to rooms is all very creative and well thought out! Patio loungers are comfortable for relaxing and reading however there isn't too much sun that get through the thick garden trees and greenery (it's kind of a tropical paradise at La Tortuga). The hot tub is nice and hot and the whole setting of the pool/patio at night is perfect.. they have the lighting set up very nicely. The restaurant - While there's plenty of good restaurants in Playa, the breakfasts at the hotel (included) were good ("The Hot Bakery" around the corner 20 steps is better for a few bucks) and the one dinner we had was very good (partly because the chef cooked the 53lbs Wahoo I had caught earlier that day ;-).. that's right.. 53lbs! The service - What can you say? This place is owned by a couple that cares and is run by people that perhaps care more. Little things are done well, the atmosphere is relaxed if you want to relax or fun if you wanna have fun! You can't match the service! Location - La Tortuga is just 2 blocks from arguably the busiest walking intersection in Playa (5th street and 12th avenue I think?.. the hotel is at 10th street and 14th avenue ... remember, avenues go in even numbers east/west and streets in 5s north/south). We were there for New Years and all I can say is that Vancouver Canada could learn a thing or two about street parties that are under control but out of control ... good times every time we ventured out... new years was over the top. Mamitas Beach Club - the beach was a packed!!!! I'm sure new years was the busiest time of year in Playa! Mamitas beach club (access included with your room) is very nice.. it's on the nicest part of the beach (IMO) and the food/drinks are tastey! We sat next to a local lawyer who said it's the best beach and nicest section of beach on the Mayan Riviera.. take THAT from a local. The schedule - to really feel Playa I'd recommend napping from 6PM - 9PM and then going for dinner and then out.. 5th street and the beach bars don't even get going until 9PM and midnight respectively. Would I go back? Without question! But next time I'd go with my girlfriend..... it's perhaps too nice for two dudes...

<Title>“A Wonderful and Romantic Boutique Hotel”
<Content>My husband and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary at this lovely hotel on January 8th. We were able to stay 4 nights. I made a great choice in both husband and hotel! It is such a romantic place to get away with your special someone and yet you are so close to everything. Every single person employed at La Tortuga is happy, helpful, and just makes you feel special. You walk in the door and they know your name! Thanks Anna, Jessica, Bernardo, and the rest of the front desk crew. To our surprise, our daughter had ordered a nice bottle of wine from the hotel and when we returned from Mamito's our room was beautifully decorated with kissing swan towel art surrounded with rose petals and Happy Anniversary sign. The bottle of wine was in an ice bucket with a flower on top, two stemmed glasses, and handwritten card. You don't get that at an AI resort. The hotel had recently extended the pool, added a nice wooden deck with tucked away Jacuzzi (seats 8 to 10 comfortably) and several Jr Suits. (I'll be in one of those next year!) What a great addition to the lushous courtyard! The restaurant and bar are ran by Saul and his staff. What a super job he does! Not only will you enjoy the breakfasts (Sorry, we didn't get a chance to eat any dinners there.) but you must have one of the BEST margarita's in Playa from Saul or Fidel at the bar or in the Jacuzzi. (Also loved the mint juliup.) Thanks Senors! I could go on and on but you should just go and experience La Tortuga and the surrounding Playa for yourself. It doesn't get much better than that. My husband and I are sorry to be back in the snowbelt but we still dream of beautiful Playa. Thanks for a great getaway, Dan and Elly from Ohio,USA P.S. We had such a great time that Dans sister and B-I-L went there several days later and just loved it.

<Title>“A Delight!”
<Content>Thank-You Anna, Bernardo, Jessica, and everyone else for being such warm and thoughtful hosts! La Tortuga provided much more than we had ever thought to expect: a central location, a private pool oasis, clean and comfortable rooms, cozy nooks, real breakfast, bar & billiards, a beach club, friendly atmoshphere, five-star staff, and an entertaining community of like-minded travellers. We've stayed in rooms 208, 111, 26 and 33 and can't wait to go back for more! Get a swim-up if one's available, what a way to start the day!

<Title>“La Tortuga is a class act”
<Content>We have stayed in Mexico many times over the years but never in PDC. We didn't know what to expect but were more than pleasantly surprised. We arrived in town on the ADC bus in the evening. As we walked out of the bus station on to Fifth Ave I thought that we were in a Mexican version of Bourbon Street in New Orleans. The people, the energy, the restaurants, the stores, the atmosphere, the buildings all suggested that this was going to be a great vacation and it turned out to be. Thanks to this site we selected the La Tortuga as our hotel. It was even better than advertised. The initial contacts were followed up immediately, reservations were confirmed, and they didn't shuffle through papers looking for our reservation when we arrived. They were expecting us and we were in our rooms in minutes. All of the help is very pleasant and do whatever is necessary to make you feel like a real guest. The hotel is boutique in nature and really delivers. It is close to the action of Fifth Ave but just far enough away to give you a feeling of seclusion. A plus is that people from all over Europe, South America as well as the US stay here. There is plenty to do and see in and around PDC. We especially liked the trip to Tulum to see the ruins. As i walked through the wall into the grounds I had the same feeling of awe that I had at the Forum in Rome and Westminster Abbey in London. The Mayans were amazing people. We rented a car for the day and had no bad experiences. I was slightly surprised that many of the res taurants and shops do not take credit cards. They prefer cash.By the way taxis in town cost only $1.50 wherever you want to go. More expensive if you go out of town. We have plans to return next year in January and will definitely return to the La Tortuga. The Bassi girls are a class act.

<Title>“Great Hotel, Great Staff”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga 8 nights and we wish we would of booked more. We stayed in a swim up room the first two nights and then changed to rm. 219 Jr. Suite the last 6 nights. Do yourself a favor and upgrade to the Jr. suite, it is twice the size and well worth the extra price. It had a hot tub and couch separate from the bedroom and double bowl sink in the bathroom w/ a nice size closet to store your clothes. The patio was double the size of the other rooms and it overlooked the pool and hot tub. The staff was more than helpful and Anna in reception does a wonderful job of answering any questions you have via email in a timely manner. Thanks Anna it was great to meet you! This is a what I consider a boutique hotel so if you are looking for total relaxation this is the place. At times we were the only ones in the pool which is unheard of at the all inclusive hotels. The beach club is a short 10 minute walk and was always pretty busy by 10 am so get there 9 am if you want a palapa and chairs. The breakfast that is included is great and we always paid an extra 25 pesos for the mixed fruit plate. Restaurants in the area are wonderful, do your research and try to stay away from the tourist areas and you will be delighted with the local fare. Do not be afraid to eat local, I have been to all inclusive resorts 4 times prior to this vacation and was sick every time, this trip I ate at places w/ all locals and never felt sick once. Knowing what I know now I will never go back to all inclusive resort but would recommend them to a first time visitor so they can get their bearings on where things are located. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting a relaxing stress free vacation. Don't forget to take advantage of the $80 roundtrip private transfer from the hotel. You can't beat the price and it is a lot more convenient than sharing a transfer w/ others.

<Title>“perfect hotel in playa”
<Content>We had a great stay at La Tortuga for Christmas. The hotel is beautiful and a quiet solace in busy Playa. It is located off of 5th ave, and far away from the Cruise ships and dock. We found that our end of 5th had plenty of cute shops and restaurants. The beach club Mamitas is great, but you need to get there by 8 or 9 in the morning to be sure that you have a spot under an umbrella. From the start the staff was extremely helpful. We arrived late at night, and they had complimentary champagne for us as they heard we were honeymooners. We had one of the new rooms recently built. It was absolutely gorgeous. There were some kinks since we were the first to use it, like the shower flooding. It is important to note, that the staff fixed it efficiently. There were also ants, but with an outdoor style hotel in a warm climate this is not unusual. We told them about it and the problem seemed to go away. Every hotel will have its problems once in awhile, our attitude was that if there response is helpful and effective then we have no complaints! The staff was very friendly and inquired often about our stay. We felt it was the perfect room for us, spacious, comfortable, and beautiful. It is very minimalist and modern. The breakfast is actually a great deal. You get your choice of espresso, type of eggs with refried black beans, and a big basket of whole grain bread. We found it would fill us until late in the day. Pedro booked our trip to Chichen Itza through the hotel. It was a long day, but worth the visit to the site. There are several side trips in the day, and my only complain about that was that it would have been nicer to spend more time in Vallaloid. Chichen ITza is an amazing monument and recommend everyone goes there. We also loved the following restaurants: Yaxche (we ate there the last night and wished we ate there EVERY night!), 100% natural (i am a vegetarian, and its a great place for healthy food) I would recommend La Tortuga to anyone, esp. people who want a romantic boutique hotel.

<Title>“I Loved the Omni”
<Content>I stayed at La Tortuga in February 2006 and fell in love with the hotel. Great service (Bernardo, Anna, Jessica and everyone down to the maids), great location, beautiful clean and comfortable rooms. I booked again for Christmas 2006 and WOW!!!!! I arrived just after they opened the new part of the hotel, what a sight! I wasn't prepared for it. The pool is double the size it was, still meandering through the beautiful lush garden. They have put a jacuzzi in the middle of the garden with very hot bubbly water, great for relaxing at night, sipping wine. The restaurant is bigger and has more tables facing the garden - very beautiful setting for breakfast (included breakfast is great, eggs, cappuccino, fresh juice, and side orders for a little extra money). Most of the lounge chairs are around the pool under beautiful trees, so not much sun, but they are due to open a sundeck with large beds just a few steps up from the pool, so that will be great. I didn't stay in one of the new rooms but I did see a couple before leaving and they are fantastic! Big, very modern fittings, very clean. They all have their private jacuzzi. Thank you La Tortuga for such a warm welcome and wonderful stay. I really hope to be back again soon.

<Content>We will be back next year. My wife and I had an incredible time during the week before Christmas. I don't really have any complaints. Everything was top notch. The beds are a little hard, but they did not keep me from sleeping. The bartenders make great drinks and have great stories. My wife thought it would have been nice to have a fruit option with the free breakfast. Location is key, Mamita's Rocks, and make sure you check out Tango Taco for a steak that will knock your socks off.

<Title>“Warning,Construction”
<Content>Be Warned, lots of construction at LaTortuga. I just returned , I had reservation there for the Thanksgiving week, planned to stay all that week. We finally gave up after three nights. They are adding on to their pool. Work starts at daybreak and continues untill nightfall. They constructed a makeshift plywood wall next to the existing pool in an attempt to separate it from the construction. The hotel staff was sorry for the inconvenience, but offered no solutions. I was never notified by my tour operator or the hotel that ther was any construction taking place. I suggest if you have travel plans that include this hotel you go elelsewhere until the construction is finished. Also, there is construction of a 4 story condo project across the street. I ended up at a all inclusive south of Playa, nice an quite.

<Title>“The right choice”
<Content>For our third trip to Playa, we chose to stay at Hotel La Tortuga. We normally go for an on-the-beach location and had stayed in the now-closed El Faro in the past. With that option gone for now, we considered a variety of hotel options in Playa. Those included on the beach midtown (Playa Maya, Fusion, Alhambra) or on the north beach (Shangri La, Las Palapas) and off the beach midtown (Illusion, Basico, Deseo, Mosquito Blue, La Tortuga) or in north Playa (Riviera del Sol, Luna Blue). All had pluses and minuses. Looking for mid-to-upper-range quality and price, we chose La Tortuga and are very glad we did. Visits to all of our alternatives during our stay confirmed our good choice. The location proved to be great. We were around the corner from everything. While we missed not seeing the water out our window, we could actually see parts of it from our balcony high atop Tortuga. We greatly preferred Mamitas Beach Club (privileges come with staying at Tortuga) to the cramped beach scene midtown. Mamitas may have been the best beach scene we have ever experienced. Thus we did not mind the hotel’s not being right on the beach. We were not troubled by traffic noise – the excellent AC drowned out most noise. Construction noise in the area is hard to avoid with so much building going on in Playa – a price of its growing popularity. We heard no Fifth Avenue or disco noise. The hotel itself is very attractive – a romantic hideaway. While the hotel’s expansion construction is temporarily detracting somewhat from the beauty and peacefulness of the pool and courtyard, it is still lovely and should look even better in the near future. To be fair, they really should warn guests of this construction in advance of booking, since it really impacts on the quality of some of the rooms. The swim-up rooms have temporarily lost their luster until this work is done, and the current construction noise could be annoying. Our room, however, a junior suite with rooftop Jacuzzi, was a wonderful experience that I highly recommend. We spent a lot of time sitting on our porch soaking up the atmosphere and sunsets and in our hot tub just plain soaking. The beds were comfortable – not wickedly hard – and the bathroom was quite nice. The attached restaurant was perfect for breakfast, and the cozy bar met our happy-hour needs quite well. We also took advantage of the adjacent Spa Itza’s facilities with great pleasure. Free internet access at the bar came in quite handy. Above all else, the key to La Tortuga is its staff. From Anna, who arranged for our stay by e-mail, to all the many smiling and helpful people at the front desk, the bar, the restaurant, and cleaning the rooms, the service was outstanding. We also availed ourselves of the $80 round-trip private van ride to the Cancun airport – another service plus that was worth every penny. Staying at La Tortuga made us want to return to Playa all the more.

<Title>“Loved La Tortuga....one little problem”
<Content>We loved La Tortuga! From the minute we walked in the door we were greeted warmly! Pedro is just a sweetie, Bernardo was perfect at the front desk, very friendly and helpful, Luis was terrific at the bar....which was great for a before dinner drink, bar could use more comfortable chairs..can you say "ouch"..ha! Anna was also great, always there to answer any questions or recommendations. The ladies that clean the rooms, so sweet, always leaving towel art and doing such a great job! Breakfast was included, it was also very good, just enough to start your day! Our only minor complaint was that there was construction going on (La Tortuga is expanding) which we were not informed about and the noise started at 8am each day, our room, we had a swim-up room, was right next to the construction. We were awaken each day with loud talking, hammering & all kinds of loud machines. Would have liked to have been warned about it! Loved Playa, it's pretty, safe and lot's of fantastic restaurants, can't wait to go back.

<Title>“A good hotel, excellent staff but loud environment”
<Content>We spent one week at Playa del Carmen´s "La Tortuga Hotel" end of October 2006. La Tortuga is a clean, friendly and well furnished hotel with excellent service and nice staff. Unfortunately it´s located next to a construction area (where currently work starts before 8am) and two famous (and loud) discotheques only a couple of hundreds of meters away (potential risk to your tight sleep between 3 and 5am). The hotel sales and reception desk team proved to be helpful and friendly trying to make the best out of the situation for us. There´s excellent breakfast at "Hot (pot)" only 50mtrs next to the hotel in "calle corazon". Furthermore it´s only a 7 mins walk to the beach.

<Title>“Loved It, Would Go Back in a Heart Beat”
<Content>We stayed in one of the rooftop junior suites for part of our honeymoon and loved it. The tub on the rooftop was private and romantic. The view from the balcony was relaxing. The place was well kept and classy and the people were very friendly. We were bummed to leave. The hotel is set up in the shape of a square looking in on an inner courtyard. In the courtyard there is a pool, lounge area, and bar. The place was very affordable. It has a great location. Although, it is not right on the beach it is close and within walking distance of some great resturants and shops to check out.

<Title>“Great Stay except for construction”
<Content>We stayed in swim up room 112 from Oct. 14-19th. I found this hotel through reading reviews on Tripadvisor so pretty much I already knew what to expect. I wanted a small hotel with a more intimate experienc - not one of the large all inclusives - this hotel was perfect in that sense. Our first night our air conditioner broke and when we reported it the next morning, someone came right out and took care of it. We also had a clogged toilet during our stay and that also was taken care of immediately. The room was very small but quaint and well maintained. We loved the turn down service, though we only got it 2 out of the 5 nights we stayed, for what reason we don't know. The maid service was great, all staff very friendly. The bar kind of opens and closes whenever so you can't always count on getting a drink when you want but that wasn't a huge disapointment. The biggest disapointment was the construction. Throughout all of the reviews that I read, no one has mentioned the construction. I was so looking forward to laying around in that adorable courtyard without hundreds of other people around - as in other larger hotels - but you really couldn't because the construction was so loud. They are adding on to the hotel which is great, but I just wish I was notified about the construction - no one ever said a word about it, what we could expect, etc. Our swim up room was on the end closest to the construction so they were working only a foot away from us - it kind of took away from our whole experience. When I returned home, I received an e-mail from the hotel asking how my stay was and I told them I loved my stay besides my disapointment in the construction noise. When you save all year to go on vacation and plan to relax at your hotel and can't, it's a little disheartening. I did get a response right away with an apology and a wish that we will return after December - that is when the construction will be completed. So, if it wasn't for the construction, I guess the only thing that I could have asked for was a larger room - other than that, and the construction, it was great. We only did one tour while we were in Mexico. We planned on doing more but after what we did, I don't think anything could have topped it. We booked with Edventure Tours - they have a dive shop at the entrance of the Tulum Ruins. I found out about them through TripAdvisor. It is a married couple who own the business. Ed is from Mexico and Bonnie came to Mexico on vacation from the states some 10 years ago, they met and the rest is history. They provide personalized tour service either in your rental car, or you can pay them to use their car. The personalized service was wonderful - so much better than going on a tour with a bunch of other people. Ed picked us up at our hotel and took us back to the dive shop to get us fitted for our snorkel gear. Before we left to get started on our tour, my husband and I walked through Tulum on our own. When we were done, we met back up with Bonnie at the shop and started on our way. We did the zip line first, actually my husband did, I chickened out. Then we went to Hidden Worlds where we snorkled the cenotes. All I can say is wow. We have snorkeled in a few other places before, but never seeing anything like that . It was great. After the cenotes, we went to a bay in Akumal where we only saw two sea turtles because the surf was rough but heard that it is normally filled with turtles. Next we stopped for lunch at an adorable resturaunt on the beach in Akumal. By this time it was almost 5pm and we had one more stop - snorkeling in a lagoon which is like an aquarium with tons of fish. During lunch, we sat talking to Bonnie about our lives and she told us of one of her best friends who moved from the states to Mexico - as she did and just by chance has ended up running a Monkey Sanctuary with her husband. They take in who are discarded by their owners and others who are hurt by poachers. They nurse them back to health and take care of them as their own children - they have even had a birth of a new baby there. They bascially take care of the monkies from donations from visitors and revenue from renting out any one of the three homes - that they built - on their land surrounding the sanctuary which is out in the jungle. Well, once I heard about the monkies, I had to see them so we stopped at the lagoon and took some pictures and Bonnie drove us to The Jungle Place to meet her friends Heidi & Joel and to see the monkies. My favorite was Lady who had her baby Luna on her back and all the while she was reaching out to me putting her arm around me and patting me on my back. I fell in love. All I can say is that the visit with the monkies and spending time with Ed, Bonnie, Heidi & Joel was probably by best experience on a vacation my husband and I had ever experienced. I never would have expected spending the end of my tour in Mexico with my tour guides and their friends at thier home in the jungle surrounded by monkies having drinks and talking about our lives - all the while the newest baby - Maya is jumping back and forth from Heidi and Joel's laps. If you go to Mexico and want a tour - contact Bonnie at Edventure Tours - also, you will be doing yourself, and the monkies a great service if you visit The Jungle Place - it is an experience that you will never forget.

<Title>“Restful stay, perfect ambience”
<Content>In July, we decided to plan an excursion in Playa del Carmen in Mexico. We chose to stay at la Tortuga, and wow, that had to be the best decision we made during the whole trip. The Hotel is located on a quieter end of town, but only a few blocks from the best shopping and dining in the city. Central to all the sights, and a few blocks from pristine beaches, this Hotel looked almost too good to be true when we arrived. I guess the best part about our stay at la Tortuga. was the atmosphere that the staff painstakingly attempted to maintain. Granted the Hotel is on the luxury end of the scale, so much should be expected, so I was very happy to be consistently greeted warmly, accommodated promptly, and treated like I was an important visitor. The truth is that where you stay while on vacation can either make or break your trip, and I am thrilled to say that La Tortuga Hotel did an amazing job at providing a relaxing, fun, and exotic place for us to relax.

<Title>“WHAT A BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE!!”
<Content>It's so nice to find a place out of your town where you feel better than in your own home, and the place to be is La Tortuga Hotel. Honestly I worked the whole year to take some days off at the Riviera Maya and even when this is not my first time there, I felt like in a renewed paradise. There's nothing better than a small hotel where the staff treats you as one more in the family. At the restaurant we got the best attention, specially from this excellent gentleman named Benjamin. Every night when I got to my room I always found a different detail from my maid. The guys at the front desk were always so kind and willing to help and give different information about the area, transportation, tickets, eco-parks and even the best "palapa" to eat fresh sea food at different paradise beaches. The gardeneres we so nice giving us explanations about the beautiful flowers and different plants at the hotel's garden and some other native from the area. Thank you all for giving me the best reason to work one more year and save money to come back to your hotel. Loops R. México.

<Title>“ok hotel nice staff, lousy room”
<Content>we booked our honeymoon at the tortuga. when we arrived the room was ready and we checked in ok. the bed was hard. the shower leaked all over the floor. there was no place to sit except for the bed. the toilet backed up. we asked to have it taken care of and went to dinner.they said it would be uncloged right away. we returned about 4 hours later and it was still not fixed. i had to hunt down somone to find a plunger and do it my self. i really hate being told something will be done and then not having it done. the towels were paper thin. we felt let down by the service and wanted to leave a day early. they said we would have to pay for the last night we would not be there. i exlpaned our reasons for leaving and after a "long talk" we did not have to pay for the last night. overall the hotel was ok but i would not stay there again for the price we paid. At 120.00 a night i expected a lot more.

<Title>“My new favorite place to stay in Playa!”
<Content>We absolutely fell in love with this hotel! From the moment we arrived in Cancun we were greeted with open arms! We made arrangements with La Tortuga for pick up at the airport. Zuley was our driver and he loaded our bags and we headed to La Tortuga. Upon arrival at the hotel Bernardo at the front desk greeted us readily by name and told us of the amenities that come with our stay. We received breakfast every morning, a pass to Mamita's beach club (you get a new one everyday) and 20% off dining at Agora restaurant. He gave us our keys and towel cards (for the beach club) and Pedro the bell hop carried our Akona Dive Bags to our room (# 109 a swim-up room). Pedro showed us all the amenities of or room. The free coffee for the morning, the air conditioning controls (which worked perfectly everyday), the mini bar and fridge, the safe box and how the lights worked. Our room was amazingly cozy! There were flowers strewn around the room a bottle of wine and two swans made from crisp white towels on the bed. Our room had double doors that stepped out on to a patio which stepped into the pool! The grounds were immaculate! Big bougainvillea, huge philodendrons and a beautiful banana tree with bananas on it. The pool was like a lazy river meandering around the courtyard with an open area near the bar. The bartender Luis made the best Margaritas in Playa and they were always 2 for one! The location of the hotel is perfect! Not too close to 5th ave (main shopping, dining street) but only a block away! It was a little stretch to Mamita's but we didn't mind the walk! Every morning we had breakfast at 7:30 because we dove early. We were always the first to arrive. Daniel was our waiter and he made sure we had fresh coffee and juice. The breakfast was very good you had a choice of style of eggs I usually got the rancheros with black beans, juice and cappuccino. Then we left for the day. When we returned Silvia the housekeeper had made new towel art and our room was spotless! She deserved good tips everyday! La Tortuga staff Bernardo, Henery, Silvia, Luis, Pedro, Jessica and Anna at La Tortuga were exceptionally friendly and accommodating! We will defiantly be coming back to stay!

<Title>“Good location, nice staff”
<Content>Overall, the hotel is in a great location, is small enough to feel cozy and quiet, and has a pretty courtyard and pool area. The rooftop suites are really cool, but if you're expecting privacy and quiet - ask for one in the back. Three of them face 10th Ave - a very busy street (although only room 304's jacuzzi area is street side). The pool bar is almost always deserted, and closed much earlier than posted. No problem, we just brought in our own, but had to buy ice across the street (it's cheap). Suggest bringing a small cooler for the room. No ice machine at the hotel. Free internet at the bar laptop was nice. Mamita's beach is the most popular and is crowded with mostly Italians or Mexicans - you either like that or hate it. Plenty of young beautiful people to watch, and a few families. You get free chairs and shade there, or can pay $6 for the "hipper" Mamita's Lounge area, which might be less crowded and has swing or beach beds and techno music. Had to pay $2 to use the bathroom (you get a bracelet) - makes you think differently about those without them that walk into the water waist deep, huh? Sunday was a zoo; Tuesday the Lounge area was closed. Needs improvement: 1. We never had towels when our room was cleaned. It became the joke that every evening before dinner we'd have to "kill" the swan (the towel sculpture on the bed) in order to take a shower. Every day, we'd go ask for towels, and they would bring them; the last day, we were just tired of the routine, so we just shared the towel from the sculpture. 2. The A/C in room 212 never worked well. Loved: 1. Pedro - he was always on duty! He was helpful, friendly, and cheerful. 2. Fresh flower petals - in the room, in the little wooden bowl near the lobby. 3. The junior suite would have been great - IF we had one of the ones in the back of the hotel. The bathroom had a bidet - always fun. Some had hammocks. 4. The pool area is beautiful, with a sexy but relaxing vibe. 5. The staff - everyone we encountered offered warm hospitality. We'll be back - and that says alot, as I rarely return to the same hotel.

<Title>“OK experience, expected better”
<Content>After reading so many glowing reviews, I had high expectations for this hotel. Perhaps we were there on an off-week, as our expectations definitely were not met. We stayed in a swim-up room (#111), which was smaller than I expected, and near a maintenance door that we heard being slammed frequently. The room was clean, but somewhat tired-looking and could use some sprucing up. The water pressure in the shower was very low. The first couple nights we were out of the room during turndown service and a cold bottle of water was left on one of the nightstands. But when we were in the room, we only got extra towels, even though we asked for water. The one day we used the pool, it wasn't very clean -- there was an oily layer and lots of bugs/plants floating around. The pool was cleaned the next day, but we had gone to the beach instead, which was another issue. Apparently, you need to get to Mamitas by around 9am in order to get the complimentary palapas and chairs. We arrived after noon, and had to pay $6 instead. The breakfast at the restaurant is good and filling. Probably the best thing was Spa Itza -- great treatments and facilities. Regarding the staff at La Tortuga, we mainly dealt with Pedro and Henry, who were extremely helpful, which we appreciated very much. Other pluses: good location and we were able to get internet access in our room. However, I doubt we'll stay at this hotel again. Even with the 20% discount, it didn't seem worth the money, especially if you can get a similar room at a beachfront hotel for about the same price.

<Content>La Tortuga was very comfortable and peacefull. It's hard to say what was best, the staff, the location, the breakfast or the swim up room. I'll definately stay there again and highly recommend it. Again, the swim up room was great.

<Title>“Lovely hotel in great location”
<Content>La Tortuga was a small but friendly and charming hotel. The staff were all only too happy to help and always greated you with a smile or joke. The hotel is just one block away from the main street (which is another block from the beach front which is hard to get to) so it's right on it's doorstep but yet not at all noisey. The standard plus room we had was lovely with nice little touches left by the maids. The only thing I would say is that we booked a suite with a balcony hot-tub for our last night and it smelt quite damp. I think there must have been a problem with leakage from the heavy rain. If we had known we have just kept our standard plus room for the entire duration. The pool is small but right next to the bar and it has the stream that goes past the doors of the 'swim up rooms'. Again if I go again I wouldn't book one of these rooms as you don't get much privacy on your balcony. All in all we had a great time here and wouldn't definately book this hotel again.

<Title>“A home away from home!!!!!!!!!!!”
<Content>My trip to Playa was one of the better vacations I have had over the last couple of years. The La Tortuga hotel played a big part in that. If you crave peace and quietness, and want to just hide away from the every day woes of working your life away, This is the place to stay. First off the staff is awesome, Sonia, Anna, Jessica, Bernando, Pedro, Pepe, Carlos etc etc. The atmoshphere is quiet and tranquil., And the hotel is centrally located in the heart of the town of playa. Playa is a great town/village with tons of restaurants and boutiques, And beaches all in the palm of your hand, Everything is in walking distance. They even have a super walmart in town, Along with a great huge supermarket called Mega, This food store rocks, If you go to playa check out Mega. The restaurant Angora in the hotel is excellent, And the manager Pepe is excellent, They serve a very nice light breakfest, The fruit salad is great, Comes with papaya, Melon, Pineapple, Grapes, Bannanas, Etc Etc. If you like expresso, Those are great to. Carlos makes an awesome lemonade, And Pina Colada in the resaturant. He is an excellent waiter. The tiramusu, And crepes for dessert, Are off the hook. The reataurant makes nice dinners also, And everything is made from scratch. The rooms are very nice, The beds are a little hard, And the towels al iittle rough, But all in all they are very cozy. The pool lounge couch area has lap top internet access, and at the bar they have a computer, Where you search the internet. The pool is nice a relaxing, Nothing to big, But just right. We took a trip to Tulum and saw all the big resorts on the way that are in the middle of no mans land, And your just confined to the resort area with no place to go. When you stay in Playa you are free to roam safe, And free in an all inclusive town with everything at your disposal. We stayed nine nights, And if I didn''t have to go back to work I would of stayed for a month. Thank you La Tortuga for making my vacation this year a great one, And I will be back!!!!!!!

<Title>“Best Bet in Playa”
<Content>My wife and I spent 3 nights of our honeymoon at the Tortuga and 4 at The Azul Beach Resort. We preferred the Tortuga. The people were nicer, service was better, the location is perfect, the pool was nicer, and it was half the cost even after paying for all of our meals. The Room was amazing. We stayed in the Jacuzzi suite which was a spacious loft with plenty of room, a rooftop terrace, and a flatscreen tv (it only got 10-15 mexican channels but it looked cool). Housekeeping kept it clean for us. They serviced our room everyday even when we didn't leave it till 3. They provided complimentary wine and floral decorations for our wedding (the Azul did not). The pool and bar area made us feel like "this is where we belong". Just look at the pictures and realize that they are all very representative of what the place is like... very relaxed, open, and inviting. We did have some services at the spa, namely a pair of hour-long massages that were the best we've ever had. I cannot say enough about Spa Itza. Absolutely Amazing. The beach club had the nicest beach I saw during my vacation. It was pretty far away, we walked there and always ended up taking a taxi back. We spent 10$ to have the use of a swinging bed for the day, it was well worth it. They waited on us all day long. We spent about $80/day on 2 beach beds on an amazing beach with non-stop cocktails and water lunch for 2 all at the newest/trendiest spot on the beach.... amazing. We also spent $50US for the 2 of us to be taken on a private snorkeling tour for a couple hours. This place offers a great deal of service and value for the price if you are willing to spend a little bit of money. WARNING - for those with children, Mamita's does have quite a few topless women. This was not a surprise or a problem for us, but it might be good to know. We WILL go back to Playa and we WILL stay at the Tortuga the entire time, not some wannabe all-inclusive that misses the entire point. The Tortuga is an Authentic hotel that provides a top notch level of service in the heart of true Playa Del Carmen.

<Title>“Fantastic”
<Content>I just returned from La Tortuga PDC 6/15-6/22. First let me say that I am not a fan of giant resorts or all inclusives so this may be a bit biased but this hotel was just perfect for my tastes. I absolutely loved this hotel it is small, no kids under 15 allowed, the staff is fantastic & very personable. My friend and I stayed in room 305 which was very spacious, more than enough room for her 3 bags & my 2, it had doube queen beds and a rooftop "jacuzzi". The room was clean and had great air conditioning. Our balcony over looked the pool and since we were directly above the bar we were able to pick up the wirless internet access from our balcony. I do not know how they manage to keep the pool so cool but it was an incredible escape from the intense heat. (Here in Phoenix my pool feels more like a warm bath in the summer) The lounge by the pool is so inviting. The breakfast items that were free were limited but wasn't an issue for me since I rarely eat breakfast. Plus there is a bakery around the corner if you want a bigger selection. My only words of caution would be that there is construction going on nearby and it doesn't look like it will be done anytime soon so there is no sleeping in. I slept with my headphones on every night but it still woke me up. So you'll have to get up and go to the beach for some extra zzz's (there are worse things). Also the "jacuzzi" is more like a whirlpool and takes a while to fill up. I would absolutely stay here again. I hope to find more hotels like this on my travels.

<Title>“4th stay, as great as ever”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga for eight days in the beginning of May. This was our 4th trip to Playa del Carmen and our 4th stay at La Tortuga. Can never get tired of this hotel. I wish we could live there. The place is only getting better and nicer. They are putting in flat screen tv's in all the rooms, and upgrading the grounds. The staff is unbelievable. We feel like we are at home everytime we stay there - everyone knows our names and treats us like family. At the front desk, Bernardo is always helpful and accomodating. Anna - you know we love you. You're a joy to be around and you make us laugh. La Tortuga is in a great spot. Close enough to the main strip but far enough from it to conceal the noise. The breakfast is great and filling, and the beach passes really help. The beach is beautiful and I think it's actually bigger and wider since the hurricane. We spent all our days there. Just a bit of advice: don't bother with taxis and shuttle busses from the airport. Its a waste of money. Take the bus. When you walk out of the airport, head to your right and you'll see the huge ADO busses. They leave every 30 minutes, have air-conditioning, really comfortable, and cost about $8 per person. And it will not take you much longer to get to Playa on the bus then it will on the shuttle. The bus makes 2 or 3 stops, but the shuttle has to drop other people off as well. Overall, La Tortuga is the place to be. It has charm and character. The hotel is spotless clean, and has the most memorable people working there. The service La Tortuga provides is very hard to find elsewhere. As long as we visit Playa, we will never stay anywhere else. And if you don't choose this hotel, I would have to thank you, because that leaves more room for us!!

<Title>“Pretty good”
<Content>My fiance and I just got back from a five day stay at Hotel la Tortuga from May 28-June 1st. I was a bit apprehensive going to a non-all inclusive, but this place was pretty nice. There are some things I would change/update/remodel, however. The good points: The pool, the hotel staff and service, Playa itself, 5th Ave, complimentary breakfast, outdoor walkways and foilage are beautiful, location of hotel The not so good points: the rock hard beds, tough as sandpaper bath towels, the rooms in general need to be remodeled and repainted This place had good points. Most of the time I enjoyed laying out by the pool, and the free internet access was a plus. My fiance and I are from San Francisco and didn't do too well in the heat. The humidity was intense and I got sick for a couple of days (don't drink margaritas from the beach side bars). Playa itself is beautiful. I loved shopping 5th Avenue (which the hotel is right next to) and walking the beach (once the sun had set). I would probably do an all inclusive next time just because I am very sensitive to the elements but this hotel with a little remodeling and updating of its rooms would be much better. I feel guilty about writing an average rating, especially for a place with such great service, but the rooms really do need work.

<Title>“Best Hotel Ever!!!”
<Content>My boyfriend and I just got back from a weeks stay at La Tortuga and could not be more pleased. This was our first time visiting Playa Del Carmen and we can't wait to return. We both feel that La Tortuga was a huge part of what made our trip so great. The hotel staff is so friendly and helpful. Every staff member greated us genuinely with warm smiles and really made us feel at home. Our swim up room was awesome - we loved waking up each morning to the birds singing right outside our patio door and spending each afternoon lounging on our patio with our feet in the pool. Watching the tropical plants sway in the afternoon breeze from our room was so peaceful. The central layout of the rooms makes it very easy to socialize with your neighbors but also allows you your privacy as well. Silvia kept our room immaculate and we were greated with warm clean towels each night. 5th Ave is just around the corner - location wise we're so happy that we stayed in town rather than at one of the all inclusives on the outskirts of Playa. Mamitas beach club is great too - it's only a 10 minute walk away and has the best palapas on the beach. Overall La Tortuga was a dream come true. We wouldn't change a thing

<Title>“La Tortuga Tremendo!”
<Content>Our blended family of seven stayed for a wonderful week in Playa at La Tortuga. We found the staff: Henry, Pedro and Bernardo extremely helpful. The ambiance was cozy and perfect for our group. We all enjoyed the Mojitos - Pedro's specialty. Our rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. All rooms (we took up three) had balconies. Two balconies were more like patios leading into the room. We had wanted ground floor rooms with swim up access from the pool. Fortunately, we didn't get one of those rooms as I think they do not offer too much privacy. We loved the circular pool and found it a respite from the heat of the beach. La Tortuga allies with Mamitas Beach Club and offers the use of their palapas. The seven block walk to the club can be daunting after a day on the beach. Our only complaint was the loud partying by the pool that was allowed very late into the night. Fortunately, our air conditioner drowned out the noise so there was no loss of sleep. We highly recommend La Tortuga. One member of our party has visited La Playa about ten times over the years and votes La Tortuga one of his favorites. We will be back, definitely!

<Content>I stayed at Hotel La Tortuga from May 15th - 21st with my sister and one of my friends. The Hotel has a great location, right off of 5th Avenue. The staff are all very accomodating and friendly (Bernardo is the best!). We had no worries the entire stay there. Mamitas Beach Club has the best beach in the city. Breakfast was great also, and the staff in the restaurant are just as nice. We always felt at home, and are already planning another trip to Hotel La Tortuga for the Fall.

<Content>Wow! This place was awesome! My Husband and I really enjoyed our stay here. This is the perfect place for a quick recharge of the batteries. The pool area is quiet and relaxing with a lounge area that is perfect for reading books. The location is also nice, as it is a short 5 minute walk to 5th Avenue with lots of restaurants and shops. Their were only two minor downfalls I noticed. They were: Parking. There is no established parking for hotel guests, so you might need to walk a bit after finding a parking spot. Jacuzzi Tub/ Shower Combo - ummm...it does leak onto the bathroom floor, but no worries, there is a drain. Do yourself a favor and stay here. You won't be disappointed.

<Title>“The Real Paradise In Playa Del Carmen!”
<Content>We have just came back from a two weeks vacation in Playa Del Carmen and there is no doubt in our mind that the grand success of this trip is due to our stay at the wonderful hotel La Tortuga. We will have to start from the initial correspondence we had with the attentive Jessica and Anna, who were so kind and efficient in helping us with our room and transportation's reservations. We will continue with the best service we have ever got (And we travel a lot, mostly in Europe) from the super professional staff at all the hotel areas, especially from Bernardo, Henri and Pedro. Nothing was too much trouble, any question was answered with a pleasant smile and the help we have received with the trips' organization was superb. Though we didn't get one of the swim-up rooms (we booked too late)- We got a lovely spacious room on the second floor with a king size bed, a great air-conditioner and all the facilities a traveller can ask for during his/her holiday. Needless to say, the room and sheets were spotlessly clean and it was a major joy to see each day the new art crafts made for us from the towels. The breakfast at the Agorá Restaurant was perfect and the massages' sampler at the Itzá Spa were to die for. Just made the whole experience - Divine! In case the Mamitas beach club is full- We recommend you to stay instead on the Tukan beach near it (Only 4$ for 2 sun beds and a parasol) and don't forget to chill out also in the magnificent pool, which makes this hotel a real paradise retreat! We couldn't have asked for more- Only that we'll be back real soon!!! Muchisimas Gracias A Todos Nuestros Amigos En La Tortuga! Ojala Que Nos Vemos Muy Pronto!!!

<Title>“Wonderful Swim-Up Rooms”
<Content>We stayed in a Swim-Up room at the Hotel La Tortuga for 2 nights following an all-inclusive week at one of the large 5* resorts in the area, and found this hotel to be very charming. While the bedroom was slightly on the small side, both the bathroom and balcony were quite spacious. And taking two steps into the pool was just sublime! We are planning to return to this little corner of paradise soon, as the location and price are both ideal. Breakfast was good - the croissant option was a bit skimpy but the eggs (served with beans and potatoes) was heartier and came in several different styles, the orange juice freshly squeezed and the capuccinos perfect. Location - perfect as only 1 short block north of the main shopping street. Also a 1/2 block away from the Hot Baking Company for snacks. Overall we found this hotel to be very relaxed and laid-back, the staff friendly, and the rooms clean. One caution however - there is a major construction site right next door and while there was no noise during the weekend, the sound of jackhammer right next door on Monday morning would make it impossible to lounge by the pool during the day, in my opinion. My advice is to check and see if the construction is still underway before you reserve!

<Title>“Wonderful stay”
<Content>This hotel is wonderful. I was nervous of what to expect when we booked because this is our first time staying in PDC as we have always stayed in the large all-inclusive type chain hotels. However, I shouldn't have been nervous at all. From the moment my husband and I arrived, we were treated graciously. The hotel is so beautiful and charming. You feel so secluded even though busy 5th avenue is only 1 block away. We had a swim up room which was great. The pool was bigger than it appeared in the pictures - just the right size and kept very clean. The bar area next to the pool was very relaxing with a pool table and couches to enjoy. Also, happy hour at the bar is nice with 2 for 1 - US$5 is a great deal. They make very good margaritas. Mamitas beach club was awesome. The beach in this area is the most beautiful along the whole coastline. The food and drinks here are very good as well. You will definitely not be disappointed with a stay at La Tortuga. We would definitely return and will most likely never go back to the all-inclusives again.

<Title>“We loved the warmth and charm”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel La Tortuga May 8-18th, 2006 and we can't wait to return. This was our first attempt at venturing outside of the all-inclusive vacation, and we weren't disappointed. This small boutique-like hotel had such a warmth and charm about it that far surpassed so many of the large all-inclusives we were accustomed to. Our many thanks to the entire staff who were so attentive and made us feel so welcome. The cleanliness of the hotel and level at which it is maintained is so impressive. When we return we plan to bring some starbucks coffee packets. Each of the rooms has a small fridge and coffee maker. After the 1st complimentary coffee pkt, they charge 15 pecos, which includes the water. We had no problem with the cost, but being Starbucks fans, Mexico's coffe just didn't do it for us. Although their resturant, Angora, had excellent expresso and cappuccino, we liked to enjoy a cup of coffee on our balcony in the early morning. There is construction going on next door to the hotel, and this I would have to say was the only draw back about our stay. However, that being said, I would have to think that at the rate Playa is growing this may be hard to avoid. Just bring a set of ear plugs, this really helped me a lot. I would highly reccomend this hotel, it was everything we were looking for.

<Title>“Nice hotel for Playa, pity about the noise”
<Content>I give it 4 stars and not 5 but that's not because of any fault of the hotel but because of the fact that ALL the hotels in Playa are very noisy as the town itself is very noisy: in the day because of construction works, and during the night because of loud disco bars (starting around midnight and going on until 5 or 6). You can close the windows but if you like to sleep with open windows it's pretty hard. Another noise factor, for European visitors, is the following: as around 50% of the guests are from the US/Canada, they can be pretty loud and you might not be used to people talking at the top of their voice in the garden or in the lobby at any time of day or night like the average american does..I was woken up by some of these people once. So if you want to go to a quiet place you should go to Tulum or to one of the hotels outside Playa (Shangri-La for example). Apart from this point the hotel is really nice, rooms are spacious and comfortable, reception desk is very good (Henri is very nice and friendly), breakfast is good (although not the fantastic thing some people rave about...), and the location is next to 5th avenue but not on it (which for me was good). There is an internet computer in the lobby, which is very useful and free, and they also have books you can borrow. Overall a very nice hotel, although maybe next time I would book a beachfront hotel in Tulum, which is of course a totally different type of holiday.

<Title>“Loved Hotel La Tortuga”
<Content>Hola, I just got back from staying at Hotel La Tortuga (March 29 - April 2, 2006). What a beautiful boutique hotel and what a great staff! Our room was fabulous and HUGE...we stayed in the rooftop jacuzzi suite (room 31). The room was clean and everyday we had a new towel decoration on the bed. The margaritas at the hotel bar are the best (and I tried a lot of them in Mexico). The hotel is not located on the beach; hence, why the prices are reasonable. Breakfast is included at the restaurant next door. If you drink coffee, definitely order a cappucino. It is awesome! The hotel supplies towels for Mamasitas beach and the walk to it is about 10 minutes or so - there were plenty of lounge chairs. It is an easy walk. Take Avenide 5th to get to the beach...it is more lively and interesting. The margaritas at the beach bar are terrible - they tasted fake - stick to beer when ordering. I would highly recommend Las Delicious for dinner one night - it was one of our best meals. Remember to bargain with the vendors selling their handicrafts. Check out Spa Itza too. Wow! A very nice spa - great massage and organic body wraps and facials. Take your Visa or Mastercard, very few places accepted American Express (Note: The hotel accepted AMEX though). Had a great time! -Sharon

<Title>“Stylish comfort and convenience”
<Content>Stayed here for the second time and loved it even more. Our room on the third floor was spacious and cool, with a lovely little balcony overlooking the pool. The rooms were cleaned well and regularly. Once when we left our Do Not Disturb sign on, the management even sent someone to ask us (while we were in the pool) if we wanted our room cleaned. Extra towels were sent when asked. The free breakfast is delicious. The room includes paid admission to La Mamitas beach club, which is becoming the best place to be on the beach. The pool is charming though small. And the common areas for lounging and reading feel like home, not a hotel. After a day at the beach, this hotel is a great place to come back to, take a dip in the pool and relax before going out. Best of all was the service...everything done in a cheerful and efficient manner. The location makes it easy to walk out your door and go shopping on Fifth Avenue, but also easy to park and load up the car when you leave.

<Title>“Excellent Service”
<Content>We just arrived back from a week in Playa del Carmen and stayed half the time at the Tortuga and another at an Adults Only AI. My boyfriend and I thought the service was great and very accomodating. We visited many beaches from Cancun to Tulum and thought that Mamita's was the best beach overall. It is a walk but we enjoyed the sightseeing. Families with children may think otherwise. We also loved the proximity to 5th. My only complaint is that the pool is extremely cold (didn't see anyone in the pool the whole stay).

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel in Playa”
<Content>My wife and I just returned from a 5 night stay at La Tortuga. We booked this hotel after reading many good reviews about it on this site....and every review we read was absolutely correct!!! This was a great little Hotel, it is just a block off of the main drag of 5th Ave (like Bourbon street...but cleaner). We had a swim-up room our first four nights, and a standard on the 3rd floor our last night (we booked kind of late). The swim-up room was very nice, easy to just hop in the pool and cool off (it was HOT down there), while the room was a little small compared to what you might expect in the US, it was still plenty big for us, and we very much enjoyed it. The front desk staff are very accomodating, and extremely friendly, and they can offer a lot of advice on what to do while your their. We went to Mamita's Beach Club on 3 of the 5 days we were there, the 1st day we went the club was very busy, and we didn't get a spot under an umbrella until afternoon, but the other 2 days we are able to get there in time to snag a couple of nice spots. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be away from the big resort All-Inclusives, it was very nice, and just what we were expecting.

<Title>“Best in Playa”
<Content>There are many reviewers of the Tortuga and they are all pretty much right on the money. The location of this place can't be beat. You're one block off 5th Ave which is the main pedestrian street where all the action is. And then just another 2 blocks from the beach. To be truthful though, the pool area here is so secluded and comfortable, we spent virtually no time on the beach except for some walking. The pool area here is more like a living room complete with couches, reading materials, a pool table, bar, and a computer with internet access. Staff is great, breakfast is fine (you can do much worse), and the rooms are clean. Given the price, what more could you want?

<Content>My husband and I just got back from our first visit to Playa and La Tortuga Hotel. We had such a wonderful time. The staff was so nice! Bernardo, Henry, and Pedro always made sure we were well taken care of. The cappuccinos are the best in town! The rooms were quaint and the mini bar was actually reasonable! Nothing too fancy, but exactly what we were looking for in a standard room. The pool was refreshing and the free internet service made staying in touch with our dog-sitter easy. The maids were very talented with the towel art! We would definitely stay at this hotel again! We also loved the central location!

<Title>“great location, but not as nice as we expected”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga the first weekend in March 2006. We had a junior suite (all that was available when we booked), and did enjoy having the jacuzzi. The combined jacuzzi/shower, however, was prone to flooding the whole bathroom, so if you want the jacuzzi, ask for a third-floor suite with a separate rooftop jacuzzi. Also, the rooms were a little musty and dirty (tons of stray hairs on the sheets/blankets). The breakfast is OK but not great. The location is perfect: one block away from 5th Av, and just north of the bar/clubs on 12th St. I guess it's reasonable given the rates.

<Title>“Loved La Tortuga”
<Content>This hotel is a great option for staying in Playa. We were pleased by the lovely touches throughout the hotel, the comfortable and pleasant pool & lounge area, excellent and friendly staff, suberb and reasonable cocktails, hearty & delicious breakfasts. This hotel is just off 'main street' in the most lovely section of Playa. We were so impressed that we saved money by not staying 'on the beach' and then had access to the best beach club in Playa (a far better area of beach than many of the other hotels in town since Wilma). In a town full of nice boutique hotels, we would still return to La Tortuga! Hopefully the nearby construction will be complete by then.

<Title>“Nice hotel”
<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga in January, 2006. This was our 7th trip to Riviera Maya, but the first one staying at a small hotel rather than a large all-inclusive resort. We were happy with our choice. Our room was small, but had all of the necessities, and was always clean. The shower had lots of hot water and good pressure. The staff - from the reception area, to the bar, to the maids - were all pleasant. With some help, we were able to get our laptop to work with the hotel's wireless, high speed network. The pool area is relaxing, although there was some construction noise while we were there. If it weren't for the noise, and the noise at night coming from La Santanera, we'd give it 5 stars. Breakfast was so-so: you have a choice of eggs or a croissant. Don't let the extensive menu fool you: the free breakfast is limited to these 2 choices. :) No big deal though, we didn't choose the hotel for the free breakfast. Overall, we were very satisfied with La Tortuga, and will stay there again, after we try all of the other hotels in Playa del Carmen. :)

<Title>“Good All Around”
<Content>My husband I had a wonderful time at La Tortuga and I found the reviews on the travel advisor very helpful in making my decision for where to stay. Other than the chilly water in the pool, Andrew and I cannot think of anything that would have made our stay better. The breakfast was very good, more than to be expected for a Continental breaKfast. Ask for eggs to be spicy if you like, awesome breakfast and good strong coffee. Usually continental breakfast includes only bread and juice! We went to Coco Maya, which we had been to before, but it was very nice to have the passes so we didn't have to pay the extra money for the beachchairs ($3-5 if your not staying at La Tortuga) Mamitas beach was always too packed and was always much windier than Coco Maya. We both played pool every night, pool table was fine, maybe bring your own cue if you like to play. Maid service and turndown service was great, very attentive and thorough. It was nice to have clean sheets everyday. Also nice to have internet, one less errand to run during the day, very convenient. Nice bar area, Bernardo, Luis and Pedro are all very good hosts. Pedro took our laundry to have it done for us! That saved us some time as well. Andrew said the only thing he could think of that would have been nice is to have the beer included during happy hour. We will definitely be back, we have stayed other places before but none have compared in terms of price or cleanliness. Very close to everything in town We did not have any problems with noise and we just got back on feb. 18th, 2006. If you like all inclusives, you will probably not enjoy La Tortuga. Quaint and personal without all the hype of an All Inclusive.

<Title>“Me Gusta! Me Gusta!”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at La Tortuga for a week at the end of January. The hotel was wonderful, both from a service standpoint, and the beautiful, relaxing atmosphere it provided. I would highly recommend a swim-up room, not only because you can step onto your patio and jump right into the small but cute pool, but also, because these rooms offer great people-watching at the bar, which is next to the pool (which closes at 11 P.M.,for those of you concerned about noise). The beach club, Mamitas, is excellent, with its rustic, traditional thached-palapa side, as well as the ultra-modern, sophisticated techno music infused "Euro Banana-Hammock" side. The food at the beach is also good, notably the grilled shrimp and ceviche. There are only two minor complaints: Hotel La Tortuga isn't far from a place tha plays live music really late at night--that or it's very close to a garage band who likes to practice Black Sabbath's "Paranoid" (poorly, too) at 2:30 in the morning on occasion. But, this only happened once or twice. Secondly, the air condidioners in the room are loud and poorly laid out, which actually helped drown out the Black Sabbath music, at the expense of having the dry, cold air shooting directly at us in bed. Everything else about this hotel will exceed your expectations, including the complimentary breakfast at Agora. Must try: Cappuccino at Agora that was as good as any that I have had in Italy. If you aren't into all-inclusives, and are more interested in botique-type hotels (like my wife and I), you will love La Tortuga. Oh, and the towel-oragami that the maids expertly do to your room towels everyday is a nice touch. My wife and I would actually look forward to coming back in the afternoon and seeing the latest object or creature that the maid had created with our bath towels that day.

<Content>Cute place. Hard beds but after a busy day had no trouble falling asleep. Air conditioning was nice. Stayed in a Jr. Suite Rm 201 - Jr suites on ground floor have private pool and those on 3rd floor have tubs outside (so would not recommend paying the extra cash for the 2nd floor units). Our tub was not level and the top of the shower leaked so the bathroom floor flooded with every shower. The people that work there are very nice. It was clean and we did not see any bugs. Our friends who also stayed there said the beach area was great. When you land at the airport ignore the guys at the booths close to the exit unless you are interested in buying a time share/vacation club.

We had a small problem with the balcony door (a little difficult to open)We called the front desk to report it and a maintenance guy was there the next minute to fix it (a little pebble was stuck). Later, a manager went personally to verify that the problem was solved. We felt that he was going the extra mile for us. The rest of the staff, very attentive as well! We left with a warm feeling!!

<Title>“Great, but”
<Content>Everything was great and as expected except for a few key things. 1. Construction next door did not lend itself nicely to a siesta or sleeping in, which is needed in a town like PDC. 2. Would have like to use the jackhammers from next door to loosen up the bed we were sleeping on. I've stayed on some firm beds before, but concrete is softer than the ones offered here. 3. Walk to the beach club was a bit long, seemed dodgy in a few areas. Not a big deal. OTOH, breakfast was excellent, location was good, pool was nice. Good, but overpriced drinks at the bar. Room was kept clean and we got the decorative towel treatment. Staff was friendly Would stay again in a heartbeat if construction was completed and beds were replaced.

<Title>“overall a great experience”
<Content>I researched hotels for a long time on this site, and found this one to be the most promising and the best value in Playa del Carmen. Overall we were very pleased. It is very clean, awesome atmosphere, great staff, great location, no ripoff scheme. We spent 4 nights there. They charge $1 per day for the use of the safe deposit box in the room, which is kind of silly given the high price of the room. We found that prices in Cancun/Playa in general are out of control compared to the rest of Mexico. We could not help but feel somewhat cheated. But then again, this comment applies to the general area, not this particular hotel. One issue was the tap water which was very salty. You get out of the shower with that unpleasant sticky feeling, as if you had just been in the ocean. This is definitely an issue specific to this hotel, as we did not experience it anywhere else in the area. Overall a great experience staying at La Tortuga.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>Hotel Tortuga is a beautifully warm hotel in the heart of Playa Del Carmen. I was initially apprehensive of staying here, because I wanted to be on the beach. However, when looking at all the choices there may not be a better location because the hotel is one block off fifth ave, it is quite and allows sleep at night, and it such a short walk to the beach. The staff was very friendly and accomodating and the room(junior suite) was very nice. If I were to come to Playa del Carmen again there is no doubt I would stay here. I must disclose I am not the type of person that would stay at the inclusive large resorts I prefer the more intimate places and this is just that.

<Content>Dear TripAdvisor: I have utilized your website on two occasions when we were in the process of finalizing the booking of a hotel.....and we have been 100% satisfied because of your website....our compliments and congratulations!!! La Tortuga was suggested to us by Eti Krance of Worldlinks. Her strong advice that the staff and property were excellent and overall comments on the property were on the money. And the deal was sealed by the comments in TripAdvisor by other persons who have stayed here. The staff were absolutely fantastic, making every effort to accommodate needs, information and requests. The website pictures are accurate and not exagerated, i.e. rooms and overall site pictures. Provision of beach privileges was good. As previous reviewer mentioned, still some daily work ongoing with hurricane recovery but wasn't a factor in our stay. An excellent facility which we would recommend to anyone for a stay!!!

<Title>“La Tortuga is an excellent hotel”
<Content>Stayed there for the last 2 weeks. The staff are very friendly and helpful, nothing is too much trouble for them. The best hotel staff I have ever met. We were issued vouchers to use the Coco Maya beach club with sunbeds, parasols and waiter service but Marmitas should be up and running by next week. Some repairs still being done to the upper floors and the hotel is being painted so we were awoken at 7.30 each morning by the builders but this should be complete soon. However the heavy construction next door may take a little longer as they were just carrying out demolition whilst we were there using jack hammers all day. Having said that, the hotel can hardly be blamed for the noise made by their neighbours. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending La Tortuga to anyone.

You feel right at home as you take a nap by the pool or hang out at the bar during happy hour. The included breakfast is delicious and you can sit in the garden while you eat it. Overall, it's very peaceful considering it is in the middle of busy/loud Playa. On the downside, it is a 15 minute walk to Mamita's beach club. Also nearby are the Spanish language school and the connected spa. I would recommend both. Enjoy.

<Title>“Very good hotel, but still some post hurricane issues to check before you go”
<Content>I have stayed at this hotel four times and checked the website to make sure there were no hurricane related issues before booking it again. I have always had a good experience with them. Unfortunately, although the website portrays few problems post Wilma, there are still a few. First, there are still repairs ongoing to the upper floors of the hotel (with equipment starting at 8AM) to some of the rooms). I don't know when these will be completed, but this is my second day and as I write I hear both electric equipent and manual sawing and hammering quite clearly. Also, Mamita's, the beach resort, although scheduled to be open november 15, will not be open for several weeks (maybe mid december). While this is not the hotel's fault, they have not yet arranged for another beach club and the website still shows Mamitas as an amenity. Had I known this, I would have gone somewhere else. Not because the hotel is not a nice one, but because the absence of Mamitas means that you will not have anywhere in particular to go on the beach (no beach loungers or umbrellas, no beachside drink service etc.) - the hotel will still give you a towel, but that is it. If you don't mind just plopping down on the sand with your towel and bringing your own drinks down to the beach or getting drinks at the beach restaurants (there are not as many as you would think), then you won't mind this too much. But, Mamitas was a very nice club and made this hotel a great bargain because it was both close to Calle 5 without being noisy and also had a very nice beach club that involed a minimum hassle, except the walk over. They are trying to find another beach club to use until Mamitas is back together, but you should check on this before booking because the hotel only has six beach loungers by the pool and once they are taken by guests there is only a small patch of rough grass to put down a towel on. That being said, any other time I have been here, this has generally been a really nice place to stay, which is why I have come back several times. The addition of wireless is a plus to a hotel that is already a good value for playa. Also, when I told them that I would be cutting my reservation short (from 9 days to 4 days) because I wanted to go to a hotel with beach chairs and services for part of my stay, the woman at the front desk (who has always been very pleasant) waived the 1 day cancellation fee because I was a repeat customer. Although the man at the desk was not very pleasant regarding the cancellation - this is the first time in four visits that I have been unhappy with the way I was treated by the staff and as I think you will see from most of the reviews, that they are generally very friendly and helpful. The bottom line is that this hotel is an excellent value for playa with a good location and nice amenities, albeit offsite at Mamita's. If you go in the next few weeks, call or email for specifics as to the beach club and construction status. Once things are back to normal, this hotel will remain one of the best values in town.

<Title>“Feel-good hotel!”
<Content>This is the kind of place I could end up going back to over and over again. The great welcome, nice garden with a small but very lovely pool, and rooms with stairs from the balcony that go straight into the pool. Great detail, ask for the swip up rooms, they are the best!Agora is a restaurant with great service (as the whole hotel), but if you feel like eating elsewhere, everything is close by. Very sweet people all over the hotel, and a GREAT spa just dowstairs!can you wish for more?I recommend this hotel to everyone looking for a nice vacation, with staff that make you feel welcome, and take care of you, and will help you with everything. And they do seem to know everything as well..

<Content>We had a great time in Playa Del Carmen, stayed at La Tortuga, staff was really helpful, always smiling (cleaning staff was amazing) and the food was absolutely divine at the Agora (the drinks too...)! Playa del Carmen is still a Mexican place, and we recommend it to everyone, and the Hotel is perfectly located for everything you want to see there. The beach was always very clean!

<Title>“Great place!”
<Content>Having spent ages researching which hotel to stay in Playa del Carmen, my girlfriend and I settled on the Tortuga after reading so many rave reviews. Thankfully, it lived up to all expectations - the staff were amazingly friendly, the service great and the rooms nice and spacious. It's also in a great location just a short walk to the beach and very close to the main restaurant and bar 'strip'. I'd thoroughly recomend this hotel to anyone...we're already planning our next trip back there!!

<Title>“Camera Stolen--Management Indifferent”
<Content>Our camera was stolen our first night at Hotel La Tortuga by the young porter who brought our bags to our room. Because we wanted to be absolutely sure that we had not left our camera at home--we did not want the young man to be fired because of our mistake--we did not lodge a complaint but instead checked out early. We were charged about $300 to do this, and we paid the fee. (A stupid move on our part, in hindsight.) When we returned home, we found that our camera was indeed missing. We contacted the hotel about the theft; they replied that, according to their electronic key record-keeping system, the boy had in fact entered our room while we had been out. They told us we would need to come to Mexico to press charges. We replied that we could not go back to Mexico to do this (!) but would like to be reimbursed for our camera. (Under British and American law, hotels are liable for their employees' thefts.) We never heard from them again depsite repeated e-mails on our part. We were disappointed that Hotel La Tortuga did not respond to our request for reimbursement, given the good reputation of this hotel, and feel we should let others know about our experience. We were particularly upset that the hotel did not respond to our messages even after they admitted the theft had occurred. We will never stay there again. Also, we did not like Playa del Carmen, which is basically a mini-Cancun. The beaches are extremely crowded and techno-music blares in the background. We enjoyed Isla Mujeres much more.

<Title>“amazing hotel!”
<Content>Well i dont usually write reviews, but do check Trip advisor when booking, and all the positive reviews of this place were spot on. What an awesome place, great rooms, reasonable price, super super friendly and helpful staff, relaxed, quiet, yet only block to the bars and restaruants. Just had to post a comment on here to recommend it. Sure the beach is a litle walk, but most hotels in Playa are not on the beach. And the ones that are on the beach are not on the good beach. So you will end up walking to the good beach - where Tortuga gives you vouchers for beds and umbreallas anyway. I even left my swimmers there and they found them and posted them to me in Australia! How good is that. And they have free internet in the lounge, and a big bonus that i didnt realise till i got there....free wireless internet.. so if you have to do a bit of work on your laptop it is a breeze. I stayed on 1st floor in room 208 which was great with private balcony. My friends had a swim-up room, which was exactly the same as mine except faces onto pool. Its only a bit more for swim up, but I personally dont think its worth it. Would definately stay again if back in the area. So if you're going I'd highly recommend the hotel.

<Content>Hotel La Tortuga is a GREAT hotel for the price. Fantastic location, very clean, great free breakfast, free Internet. The pool area is a nice quiet oasis from the busy streets of playa. Finally, the staff was so kind. We messed up our reservations and came two days late and they didn't even charge us for the extra nights. I would definitely go back. My only complaint is that the beds were hard...but I found that in every hotel in Mexico.

<Title>“Superb atmosphere and service!”
<Content>I was looking for a good place to spend my summer holidays when I came upon La Tortuga on Trip Advisor – the numerous positive comments on the Hotel's general atmosphere and location made me decide to go. And I was not let down at all. I was looking for a swim up room but as there were no available, I opted for a Standard Plus. I was surprised to find a spacious clean and comfortable room … and it even had a coffee machine! The location is great: just around the corner from Quinta Avenida – close but not too close to where everything goes on! The pool area was a great place to relax after a day on the beach – the summer does get very hot over there! And at the pool bar we had free Internet access all day long! All the staff was always very helpful with information on tours and the best places to visit in the surrounding areas. The beach club we were given a free pass to was a short walk from the hotel but having tried other beaches in Playa, we decided it was definitely the best one around … it has an excellent restaurant right on the beach which means you don't have to walk under the scorching sun to look for some lunch! Really an excellent holiday in a superb hotel!

<Title>“Great place...great staff”
<Content>It was our first time in Playa Del Carmen. We picked this hotel on line and were not disappointed. It was beautiful. We had a first floor room with our own private pool which was wonderful. The Agora Restaurant gave us a great breakfast every morning (included in the price of the room) and the staff at both the hotel and the restaurant were fabulous - very friendly and spoke english. A block up from 5th Ave, it was an ideal location for evening strolls and restaurant access. It was a bit far to the beach club and we would recommend a taxi...only 200 pesos. Great beach club and fun bartenders!!! Defintely worth the taxi cab fare! We were there when Hurricane Emily hit which definitely had a negative impact on our stay but becuase of the staff at the hotel and their care of us during the oreal, a very bad situation was made as good as it could be. They provided us with food and water and kept us informed of what was happening every moment. They even cleaned our rooms the day after the storm when we had no power. Bernando, at the desk was wondeful and helped us get a flight out two days early because the beaches were not opening for 5 more days. And they even refunded the two nights we didn't use. We will go back to Playa, we loved it and we will stay at the La Tortuga because the people who work there are special and the hotel is beautiful. At the airport in Cancun we talked to many people who did not have our good fortune...not all of the hotels took as special an interest in their guests during the hurricane as La Totuga did.

<Title>“A great place to stay...we would recommend it to anyone!”
<Content>My partner and I went to PDC right after the hurricane Emily. We arrived July 25th and stayed through the week. Of course we were disappointed at ALL of the destruction around the town itself, but we were VERY impressed at how wonderfull the Hotel was. Very very clean, modern, quaint and the staff was very friendly and truly helpful. We feel like this is the best kept secret in town. Quiet (important unless you are there to party all --- night)and the air conditioning works like a charm. The attached restaurant is fabulous, you get breakfast included with your stay-so take advantage of it. Very fresh and delicious. The only, and I mean the ONLY semi-complaint we would have is the distance to the Beach Club Mamitas. Yes it is nice when you get there, but be prepared for a little bit of a walk. Of couse we are being petty-I mean we should love to get out and have a walk to the beach for heavens sake, but if the beach were right outside the door-this place would REALLY be heaven on earth..... Do not let our sloth deter you. Hotel La Tortuga is fantastic and we will be back!!!

<Title>“La Tortuga 1 vs. Hurricane Emily 0”
<Content>Before I make any comments about our stay let me congratulate the staff at Hotel La Tortuga. I live and work in a coastal area in Texas and we have a serious hurricane potential every year. My stay during the hurricane was an eye opener, not the storm but the way the staff assisted us. I heard nothing but horror stories at the airport on the way back from guests at other locations on how they were treated by their hotel or resort. Bernardo and everyone took care of my wife and me. They went above and beyond what I would expect of hotel professionals. I can not say enough about how the entire staff treated us during the crisis. That alone would give the hotel 5 stars on any review. But for those who want to know about the hotel during calmer times I say, stay nowhere else when visiting Playa. The location is wonderful, the rooms are great and again the Staff is made up of dedicated professionals. The took care of all ours needs and desires from transportation to the tours. I can not say enough about the hotel. S. and N. Wright Seabrook, Texas USA.

<Title>“Hotel La Torgua is the Best in Playa del Carmen!”
<Content>We just returned from spending our honeymoon at Hotel La Tortuga in Playa Del Carmen. I have to give it absolutely the best rating possible, 20 on a scale of 1 to10. We spent a lot of time researching hotels in the area and read through all the reviews on Trip Advisor regarding this hotel. Going to a different country was a little intimidating and picking out a hotel from the internet was nerve wracking but we didn’t want to go to just any big resort. If we were traveling to Mexico, we wanted to experience a little local flavor. The hotel staff, Anna especially, was fabulous and quickly put to rest any fears we had regarding our hotel choice. They answered question after question for me in preparation of our arrival. I felt like I knew them before we arrived. The room they suggested was perfect, exactly what we were looking for and exactly as they described, everything was very clean and tastefully decorated. The rooftop Jacuzzi/terrace was a wonderful amenity. The sunrise from our terrace was fabulous. The tub does take a little while to fill but well worth the wait and not so much time that it was annoying as had been mentioned in previous reviews. The hotel courtyard is almost like your own little paradise. The pool was wonderful and very refreshing. The maid staff was great and had the room beautiful for our arrival, rose petals and fresh flowers were everywhere and a bottle of wine chilling for us. Breakfast at Agora, the restaurant at the hotel, was incredible. There was more food than I could eat but I suggest you also try the fruit with yogurt plate also. It is very reasonably priced and the mango is the best you will ever try. The location was perfect, within walking distance of everything you needed. The noise, mentioned in previous reviews, was never a problem for us. Our room seemed very private and quiet. The beach club, Mamita’s was one of the best on the beach. The walk there was not too far. The food and drinks were great. They served us our food right on the beach at our palapa. There was a computer at the hotel bar available for checking e-mails for those travelers that need to check in with the real world. However, be prepared to want to drop all contact with the outside world once you enter the doors at La Tortuga. If you are looking for a place to get away from the cookie cutter, all inclusive resort, but don’t want to feel completely secluded, you can’t go wrong with Hotel La Tortuga. They definitely earned our repeat business and we highly recommend them!

<Title>“What a great hotel!”
<Content>I live in Cancun and had a friend come to visit so we booked La Tortuga online in January. We requested a swim up room with two queen beds. Late June I confirmed the reservation. We arrived on Friday pleased to find our very clean, vey accommodating room exactly as expected. Everything and everyone at this hotel is top notch. The staff goes out of their way to accommodate their guests: providing fresh towels mid-day, prompt and unobtrusive maid service, friendly assistance at all times. I will stay at this hotel again should I return to Playa del Carmen in the future. Bernardo, Luis (in the bar), Slyvia our maid, and every other person we were in contact with make you feel like a VIP.

<Content>We stayed at La Tortuga for 5 days in April and were totally enchanted. The rooms, though small, were beautifully appointed and totally functional. The hotel was immaculate and the service impeccable. La Tortuga was our home away from home for 5 days and a great little sanctuary after walking the busy Avenida all day. We'll always remember margaritas on the spacious patio each evening before going out to dinner. We LOVE Playa and La Tortuga. We would go back in a minute and recommend La tortuga to everyone!

<Content>La Tortuga Hotel is THE place to stay in Playa de Carmen! Classic Spanish architecture with cool breezes sweeping through quiet hallways. Beuatifully tiled rooms with private balconys overlooking the peaceful pool garden. When sitting by the pool the soft sounds of relaxation take you mind away to utopia. The staff and pool bartenders are extremely helpful and always willing to answer your needs with smiles on their faces. And don't miss out on the amazing food at the attached restaurant. Plus its located just one block from the famous 5th Avenue. This hotel is a wonderful spot and I couldn't ask for a more pleasant stay in Playa. Enjoy!

<Content>I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights from tuesday the 24th to monday the 30th...i switched rooms every night for some reason but am glad i did...i got to see all the different types of rooms available and what each has to offer...they were all unique in their own way...i enjoyed every one of them for different reasons...some for the rooftop jacuzzi's for a midnight dip while looking at the beautiful night sky, some for the spacious rooms, some for the overall lighting/ambience. The hotel is in the perfect location...right in the middle of everything, but not TOO much in the middle,right around the corner from everything so its even better...The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful when needed...shout outs to the names i know...Bernardo, the girl from italy, and especially the short dude who got everything done i cant believe i dont remember his name, and Sol (spelling?)...she was the greatest...the highlight of every day i was there was passing her in the lobby every afternoon and evening and looking at how beautiful she was. I felt like a little boy...i couldnt wait to see her again the next day...I have never been taken aback by a girl before...the first time i looked into her eyes and how sweet she was i knew i was smitten. She had a bf so i was bummed...i would have really liked to have taken her to dinner or something but i didnt have the guts to ask her. oh well...it was a great hotel and i will stay there again for sure...

<Content>Playa del Carmen is a lovely town, quickly getting more touristy, so go in the next 2 years before it gets overtaken by plastic. But if you do go, I highly recommend La Tortuga. Lovely rooms with balconies with chairs and table, spacious inside. For our last 2 nights, we took the room on top with the jacuzzi on the roof - absolutely superb for all-day sunshine and very private.

<Title>“Loved the Tortuga”
<Content>I just returned from my week long stay at La Tortuga and I am so happy we picked this hotel! The location is perfect, right near the best part of 5th ave. We initially had a rooftop jacuzzi room facing 10th and it was too noisy for us so they moved us to another room facing the pool. This room was great, we very much enjoyed our stay and plan to return next year. The hotel is nice and small so you don't get all of the hustle and bustle of a larger hotel. You can sit out and relax by the pool and have a drink or just take a nap. It is such a cozy hotel. Now if you are expecting auto flushing toilets and all sorts of pool side activities this is not the hotel for you. It is quiet and relaxing and the staff is so nice. The free breakfast at Agora next door is the best, I thought a free breakfast was going to be buffet style but it was sooo good I enjoyed it every morning. Thanks for our wonderful stay Delia

<Content>Our 8 day vacation in Playa, March 11 - 19 was wonderful. We decided on a small hotel for a change and stayed at the Hotel La Tortuga on Calle 14 and 10th Avenue. Loved it. Small and intimate, exceptionally clean with friendly staff, small restaurant and bar, pool and our own private rooftop jacuzzi! Beach club was a bit far - 6 blocks - but otherwise - thumbs up. 5th Avenue a constant parade of people - loved the international flavor and European ambiance. The ruins were spectacular. Returning next year for a two week stay with one week in Cozumel and one in Playa - it gets in your blood!

<Title>“Hip, Charming Inn in the middle of the action”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here in September 2004. The hotel itself was very clean and comfortable. The decor is fun and modern; there is a lounge area with little areas to hang out and relax after a day at the beach. The pool is small, and a little claustrophobic feeling because it fills in the entire courtyard area, which looks neat but isn't very inviting for a swim. The room was cleaned nicely everyday, and the staff was very friendly for the most part. We were there during a slow season, so there wasn't much in the way of tours/excursions offered, so we had to book them from local tour agencies, which wasn't a problem. The adjacent restaurant is very reasonably priced and offers lots of delicious treats. Like most restaurants in Playa del Carmen, it is open air which is pleasant in the hot humid nights, the view is of a busy back street which may not be as romantic as some other places, but still is lively and interesting. The only down side (depending on what type of person you are) was the music from the neighboring night club. Loud music pounded into our room until 3:00am every night.

<Title>“Not the best place to stay in Playa”
<Content>We stayed here for 3 nights. We booked the rooftop jacuzzi. Our room was not ready until 4pm. Upon arrival it REEKED of heavy cleaners. Even with the doors and windows open and the ceiling fan going full speed the smell was overwhelming. The bed was EXTREMELY HARD. The rooftop jacuzzi had no shade and the tub was cracked and dirty. TO top it off they sent us an email saying that it would cost 128 US dollars tax included. Well, like many of the Mexico establishments they used an exchange rate to their benefit which meant that when we got back it really cost 136 dollars. THIS WAS NOT WORTH THAT AMOUNT!!!!! At best it was worth 50 dollars. We definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It was noisy, smelly and overpriced. The Hotel Maya Riviera Caribe was much better for a much lower price.

<Title>“Great Location, Good Value”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at this boutique hotel twice (May 2004 & Nov 2004). The staff is very nice and helpful, always smiling and greeting you. Most of them speak very good English, although on our last stay there was one front desk rep who spoke very little English. My Spanish is ok, but I still found it difficult to communicate with him. The rooms are nicer than any American room of the same price ($50USA in the low season for a standard room, w/AC and cable tv w/English channels and a full breakfast). On our first visit we stayed in a standard room and on our second visit, we tried the Standard Plus Rooms. They cost a bit more and are not much nicer but they have a mini fridge and extra closet space. Some of the Standard Plus rooms are also swim-up rooms (direct pool access from your private patio) and these rooms are every bit worth the extra money if you plan to use the pool. The hotel is beautiful at night, tastefully illuminated, trendy (but quiet, no "scene") and even romantic. The location is superb, a block from 5th Ave and a short walk to Mamaita's Beach Club (the hotel gives you beach towels & vouchers). There is an bank/ATM at the end of the block and internet access across the street. The hotel can offer you many day trips at good prices and on short notice (ruins, snorkel trips, the parks, etc.) And they offer RT airport transfer for 1-3 persons for $70USA. This is is a bit more expensive than a taxi but the Cozy Hotels car is a much more comfortable ride, as the cars are brand new, tinted and they use the AC.

<Title>“Why the rave reviews?”
<Content>We stayed for 14nts from 28Dec 2004 @ Tortuga based on some of the rave reviews on TA. If you get a room near the road you WILL be woken up at ALL hours by the Mexicans and their love of very loud and probably illegal exhausts on their bikes and cars. Our second room was much quieter, helped by having all windows rather than windows and poorly fitting wooden shutters. This is a nice hotel though and good value. Dont get a room ending in 03 or 04 for the road noise issue though. Dont bother with their beach club. Get your free towel from reception and walk to the nearest beach at Coco Maya (next to Blue Parrot) where it is only 50pesos for a bed for the day. Much quieter, cheap food and drinks (nachos = v.good). Go to their beach club if you really want to be next to a loud speaker, hemmed in like sardines and surrounded by pretentious people. Maybe try the Mosquito Blue which is on a quieter street and has a usable size pool.

<Title>“Best place in PDC.”
<Content>My wife and I had checked the reviews in reference to this hotel and they were always great, well I have to say we agree. We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights the week before Christmas 2004, and it was awesome. The staff, the room, the restaurant and the location were excellent. Every request we had the staff took care of and the hotel itself is beautiful and makes you just want to relax. The only recommendation we have is pay a little extra and get the swim up room, we stayed in a standard room and it was small, no place to really unpack. And on the aspect of the restaurant, couldn't ask for better food or service and they were even helpful in assisting us in choosing other restaurants to try. The location is literally less than a block from 5th ave. You walk out the hotel take a right and go down fifty yards and you are right in the middle of 5th ave. We would definantly stay again at this hotel and planning on returning as soon as we can.

<Title>“My favorite facation destinaiton”
<Content>My boyfriend and I have stayed at La Tortuga 3 times over the past 2 years. We travel often, but La Tortuga is the best hotel we've ever stayed at. Personally, I'm not fond of all-inclusive big hotels, and La Tortuga has the perfect setting to really make you feel on vacation. The staff has always been very good to us, and very helpful, people at the restaurant were great. I have read some reviews where people weren't happy with the staff, and all I have to say to that is maybe they should adjust their attitude. People treat you like you treat them, and after all, you're on vacation, so don't be so uptight! Where else are you going to get private beach passess to a gorgeous beach (better then Turks and Caicos and Hawaii, by the way), good breakfast and spotless rooms for $50/night? Our every request was always fulfilled and we were always greeted with a smile. Playa del carmen: a fresh breath from Cancun. Great shopping, great food, great beach (the private one). For amazing stake, check out Tango Tacko. There is also an amazing little Italian restaurant tucked away inside an art gallery on 5th avenue. Also, look for a Crepe cafe on 5th ave. The owner, Emil, will take good care of you. There is also a restaurant inside a cave about 10 minutes away by taxi. I can't recall it's name, but every cab driver would know what you're talking about. The food is not the greatest (just go in for a few glasses of wine), but the surroundings are out of this world. Unless you like cold weather, don't bother going in December. Everything in Playa is outdoors, and temperatures in the evening average about 14 C. The best time to go is in the spring. Stay at La Tortuga, and I promise, you will not regret it. But the beauty of Playa del Carmen is that even if you don't like your hotel, you can step outside and find about 100 other hotels you can move to without any hastle. please e-mail me if you have any questions: inka_g@yahoo.com

<Title>“Book the junior suite with rooftop jacuzzi”
<Content>My husband and I just returned from a 5-day stay at the Hotel la Tortuga. At first, we were disappointed since we arranged for transportation from the airport and no one was there for us, and we booked a junior suite online to find out later that only 2 junior suites have open air rooftop jacuzzis like in the photo on the website. However, once we got our room switched and worked it all out with the management, our hotel was great (beside the mattresses, which we both felt were a little too firm for our liking). The people that run the restaurant were very friendly and the location of the hotel is superb. It's literally around the corner from 5th Avenue which has all of the cute shops, restaurants, bars, etc. Mamitas Beach Club was great too! We are walkers so we didn't mind the stroll, but if you aren't, it may seem far to you. We would definitely stay in this Hotel again, but will always book the suite with the rooftop jacuzzi. Regarding Playa del Carmen: This is by far our favorite place in Mexico! We had travelled numerous times to Cabo San Lucas and Rosarito, but the Caribbean side is much better. One of the reasons we especially liked Playa del Carmen is that it's very cosmopolitan - lots of Europeans: Italians, Spanish, Germans, French. etc. And, the town is very clean, the decor of every restaurant was stylish and hip, and the people were all really friendly.

<Title>“just ok”
<Content>The hotel was fine, but not somewhere I would choose to stay again. When we arrived we found our bathroom in bad condition. The toilet seat was broken with a brush in the toilet, and the bathroom lotions and things had been opened by the prior occupent. The evening staff person wasn't helpful at the time and didn't speak english well. We had a swim up room, which looked nice, but no one used the pool. It was just part of the decor. The walk to the beach club wasn't bad. With so many other hotels in the area, you can probably find a nicer one closer to the beach.

<Title>“nice place to stay”
<Content>My sister and I just returned from an 7 day trip to Playa Del Carmen and our stay at the Hotel La Tortuga was one of the highlights of our trip. The staff was helpful and friendly. The room was clean and charming. The staff was very efficient in helping us with anything we needed. Our air conditioner had to be fixed and they gave us a lovely suite to relax in while we waited. The housekeeping staff surprised us with lovely towel "sculptures" each day. The free breakfast at the restaurant next door, was very generous and good. Great coffee! We did alot of relaxing by the pool, reading and resting, very NICE. We did have one complaint. The hotel offers a free beach club pass to Mamitas Beach Club. After a very long, hot walk to the club the first day, we were informed that they were full and by the looks of the club, VERY CROWDED and LOUD. So, we headed closer into town and found a great little club at the Hotel Alhambra. When a nice waiter heard our Mamitas story, he let us stay there at their club free whenever we wanted. It was much quieter and alot closer to our hotel. I hear Mamita's has a great beach and lot of action. If that is what you are looking for then you should check it out. All in all, Hotel La Tortuga is a wonderful place to stay, with a very helpful staff and a charming atmosphere.

<Title>“They left me stranded at the airport!”
<Content>I read many favorable reviews of this hotel and decided to book with them. I am a petite girl travelling alone and so I requested airport transfers because my Spanish is just so-so and I didn't want to be"taken for a ride" with another taxi. My greatest fear had come true: I was alone at night in the Mexico airport with no one there to pick me up. I arrived at 9pm and no one was there with my name on a little sign. I had to call the hotel and needed to buy a phone card to do so. When I did get through, the employee on duty said that he didn't see my name "on the list". I had been there an hour already and didn't want to miss the end of my friend's party so I asked when can someone come for me? and he said it would be another 45min-1 hour. That was too long for me to wait so I tried to split a ride with some other family taking the 45 minute drive. A half hour later I found a couple and wound up spending $25.00 to get to the hotel (much better than $60 that was quoted by taxis if I left alone). When I arrived, the employee told me that I would be reimbursed if I provided the receipts. I did so the following day and I made sure that I would have a transfer back. I reminded them every day. I was told that the taxi company never confirmed their reservation and that's why no one came for me. It was too late to go to the party so I went straigt to sleep. My girlfriend had become worried when I didn't show so when she came to look for me and asked if I had checked in a new overnight guy was there and told her that I wasn't in that hotel! Well, I never got reimbursed for my phone card and taxi transfer even though I e-mailed them and sent them copies of messages that show that I did request transfers in advance. The breakfast was good even though I had to wait for someone to appear at the front desk (almost always someone different-4 different people at desk while I was there) to give me a "ticket" to eat. The room was clean but small. The housekeeping staff would make little animals out of the towels (cute) on the bed. Machinery of some sort woke me up very early every morning I was there. The lock that was given to me for my safe didn't work correctly and when I requested another it didn't work either. The hotel wads in a good location and the housekeeping staff and wait stadff at the restaurant did their job well. Breakfast was very good. They gave me a choice of a croissant and any type of coffee (cappuchino, espresso, regular) or eggs "the Mexican way" with beans and whipped potatoes. Both came with a basket of bread. If the rest of the staff could do the same it would have made a world of difference. I would not recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Excellent Little Hotel”
<Content>This hotel was excellent. Close to the fifth ave and only minutes from the beach. Staff was awesome, they look after our needs as we asked. Plugged toilet was fixed fast. Breakfast was included and was very filling. 300 yards from the famous fifth ave. Was an excellent location. 20 minute walk to the ferry over to Cozumel. Great small bars and lots of shopping within 2 minutes of the place. There was some noise from the local bars on Friday and Saturday nights but nothing out of the unusual. Would go back in a heart beat!!

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>The only disadvatage to this properity was not being lacated on the beach. That and the room that we had was somewhat on the small side. Other than that the location was great, close to 5 Ave., shops, resturants, bars and anything else you may want. The staff was the best. Very helpful and knowledgeable about what to do and where to go and considerate about a cheap Gringo budget. The resturant was great for breakfast and dinner and the wait staff was fun. Happy hour was a time to behold. We had more fun and were introduced to some great people from all over the world while Antonio mixed the cocktails. The pool that snakes around the hotel is cool and a bit chilly but quite refressing. The beach club is fun but a distance from the hotel if you are on foot. We have stayed in Playa three times and I would not hesitate to go back. Adios for now.
