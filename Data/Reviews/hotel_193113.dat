<Title>“Central location, very good value for money”
<Content>I wanted somewhere central and not too expensive. This hotel was perfect. The location is fabulous as Oxford Street is just 'round the corner'. Staff were very pleasant. My small single room had everything I required and was comfortable. (flat screen TV, tea/coffee, toilet accessories, hair-drier, information pack etc). I also wanted a hotel with a swimming pool and only paying £5 to swim and use the sauna and steam room was good value. Good selection of bars and restaurant. Very busy hotel, but staff seemed to cope and everything went smoothly, but taking the lifts was sometimes annoying if you were in a hurry (check-out in the morning) as too many people are also trying to take the lifts. I would definitely stay again, but leave more time for check-out/catching a train!

<Title>“Typical London hotel”
<Content>It's a central as it gets; 30 second walk from Oxford Street, 2 minutes from Covent Garden. Expect no thrills, some rooms have been partly refurbished, but most of the hotel feels like it is in dire need of a touch-up. But this is typical for London; if you want a fresh and clean hotel you have to fork up some 250EUR. First night I went down to the reception to get my room swapped at 3.30 in the morning. The reason? The AC outside my window kept me from sleeping (it was broken). But they gave me a new room instantly, so I have no complaints concerning service. So; my ratings is set compared to hotels in other parts of the world. If I would compare this hotel to other "3 star" hotels in London, the rating might have been higher. But I think that when a hotel in London is 1000 times dodgier than a hostel in Berlin, than the rating should reflect that.

<Title>“Excellent location”
<Content>We stayed here for two nights, the hotel is right next to Tottenham Court road station so easy access to tubes/airport etc. The hotel is just off the end of Oxford street. The hotel was clean, our room looked as if it had been recently renovated. The staff were friendly. We used the online check in so we only had to collect our key from the concierge at the main entrance and then straight to our room, no fuss no queues. The hotel also provided storage for our case after we checked out

<Title>“Great location and value for money...”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The location was very convenient and the hotel was great value for money. I stayed in an Executive Suite on the 9th floor. The room was spacious, immaculate (recently refurbished) and had great views of London. The room had a sofa, double bed and everything else you could need (iron, safe, TV, fridge etc). The bathroom had a large shower and a bath (it also had a built in TV). The breakfast was good and the staff were friendly. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Great Location and price”
<Content>We stayed at the St Giles at the very beginning of our our trip to Europe and were very happy with our stay so we booked it again for the end of our trip. The location is excellent about 150m from Tottenham Court Rd station (on the central and northern line), 1 block from oxford street and has easy access to most of Londons attractions. The rooms themselves are nothing fancy, the decor is somewhat drab but for the location and price this was no concern at all. We only spent the nights in our hotel room so it was not a problem. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to stay a few nights in an affordable hotel right in London.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>I selected this hotel for a weekend stay in March based on three main criteria – location, swimming pool and price. The St Giles is a busy and bustling tourist hotel, located in central London. There’s an NCP car park underneath the hotel and guests receive a discounted rate. Tottenham Court Tube station is a 2 minute walk and Oxford Street/Bond Street is 5 minutes away. Covent Garden is a 20 minute amble and there was plenty of people about when we walked back at about o’clock in the morning. There’s also plenty of black cabs about to take you in all directions. Service throughout the hotel was fine enough, efficient and helpful. Receptionists friendly, requests for more pillows, towels were met with ease. I found the concierge to be particularly good, securing theatre tickets at the last moment at a good price. The rooms were a tad on the small side but clean and comfortable enough. Usual bits to be found - safe, TV, kettle, hairdryer. Rooms were well lit but lack wardrobe space/place to hang/lay clothes. Full breakfast restaurant, buffet style, plenty of choice and food good. There’s also three restaurants, a bar and a lounge area but as there’s such a huge selection of places to eat at nearby we didn’t use this facility. There are ‘pay as you go’ internet spots throughout the ground floor and you can also hook up to the internet in your room at an additional cost. The leisure facility is independently operated by the YMCA and there’s an additional cost of £5 per guest per visit. There’s a 25m indoor pool, sauna/steam room, fitness room with equipment and massage & beauty therapy available. We used the various facilities and found them to be good. I don’t think for the location and price that you could go far wrong here, the cost for a two night stay for five people was £450.00 and we consider this to have been very reasonable value for our experience.

<Title>“Fantastic location, great value, clean but plain”
<Content>I have stayed here a few times over the years, and the main reason is always the same: can't beat it for the price and its location, right in the heart of London. The rooms are clean, on the small size (welcome to London), plain and anonimous but comfortable. I was on my own and this place is extremely convenient and feels safe. Breakfast wasn't included but there are plenty of cafes around the corner (which are better quality and better value than the hotel's own breakfast place). The only big negative: no free wi-fi.

<Title>“Good Hotel”
<Content>I have just spent a night at this Hotel, it is the second I have stayed there and cannot fault it. The staff are helpful and friendly, the rooms I have stayed in have been clean and smart. The main attraction for this hotel though is its very convenient location, 2 minutes from tottenham Court Road tube station and minutes walk away from Covent Garden and other attractions. The prices are very reasonable too.

<Title>“Perfectly acceptable for a short stay...”
<Content>I am currently sitting in the "lazy dog" bar and this is probably my least favourite part of the hotel. It does not know what it is trying to be... It ha old skool, cheesy, music, lots of tacky signage and everything just looks a bit rough. The entrance is actually quite impressive and although the rooms are small they have everything that one needs for a short stay. Wouldn't like to stay much longer than a night or two tho... The location is fantastic though... Staff everywhere, except lazy dog bar, are polite and professional with the best customer service without a doubt being offered in the casino.. :/ Overall not bad and quite reasonably priced too...

<Title>“Absolutely fine for a London central hotel and a short break”
<Content>The Ritz it aint, but then this isn't Ritz prices. I have stayed at the St Giles before. There is everything the traveller needs. Only a few minutes walk to Tottenham Court Road and Goodge Street Underground Stations. Cabs almost constantly outside and busses on Tottenham Court Road too. Easy to walk to most main attractions, or indeed find a "Boris" bike and cycle if you dare. I was warmly welcomed by the Reception team. There is a convenient bar and food to match appetite and pocket. Small but perfectly fine rooms, mine was clean and probably just decorated. Slightly annoying habit of putting spare loo rolls etc, out of reach of the loo! A bit tired in common parts, lifts much in demand at peak times and very noisy fan above the window, so had the window open for a while which was noisy. However, I had walked so far and the bed so comfortable, sleep wasn't difficult. Do use the concierge facilities if needed, very helpful and saves a lot of time and effort...Lots of restaurants handy in Charlotte Street especially, and this is only a couple of minutes away. Enjoy ! Oh and there is car parking opposite, but its pricey...

<Title>“Great breakfast! Soho fun!”
<Content>First of all the breakfast was AMAZING! Eggs, meats, cheeses, yogurts, fresh fruits, tons of juice options and coffees! The concierge service was amazing! They helped with every single detail including helping us receive tickets at discounted rates and giving us maps and suggestions on what to eat and where to go! This hotel is all you need - clean and comfortable- place to sleep, shower and get back to London sight seeing! The location was in the heart of the center of London however it was a bit of a walk from the tube- but Only a few blocks from a double decker bus hop on hop off pick up so that made it much more convienent. Also there is a large YMCA connected to it- but you do have to pay about $5 to go every time. Its very nice! No wifi. You have to pay to use their computers per minute.

<Title>“Very Good Value”
<Content>Stayed for four nights in February with two grown up children. The location is the bestest ! Nowhere can beat it. Very clean, good-sized rooms by London standards. Helpful, professional staff. Average English breakfast. No lighter continental alternative which is a pity. Never had to wait for lift for more than four minutes and that only in the so -called morning rush hour. Price was very good value. It was our first time but certainly not our last

<Title>“Not bad......but.....”
<Content>Fantastic location. Perfect for a short stay. Staff were polite and helpfull. We were told when we booked in that unfortunately they didn't have any standard double rooms so we would have a free upgrade to a de luxe double room - I then pointed out that it was a de luxe double room that I had actually booked !! The de luxe part was good and consisted of a separate room with a comfortable double sofa, table, TV , dressing table and a miniscule wardrobe.The shower room was small, but did seem to be quite recently modernised. It would however have benefited from some sort of shelf to place our soaps / shampoo etc. The bedroom part was so small we had to walk sideways between the bed and the wall to get in and out of the bed !! We stayed here a couple of years ago and had a standard double room, which had plenty of room round the bed. There was quite a bit of noise from outside, but this is due to the location. If you want the convenience of the location, then the noise bit from the street goes with it - can't really complain about that. Whereas its corridors and bedroom were tired, they were clean in fairness. Overall - great position - staff good - clean. The rest is reflected in the price - if you want a bit more pampering than merely basic, then stay elsewhere but I suspect it will be more expensive. I thought it was a bit pricey, but that is probably down to city prices and location. We would stay here again, based on location and price.

<Title>“Great value, it's central London so of course the rooms are small for the price!”
<Content>I have to admit that I didn't check the reviews before booking this hotel as it was just for a business trip and I was running out of time, after reading some of the reviews I was worried because a lot of people were complaining about small rooms.  Well I had a double bed en- suite room & paid £96 for the night, that was good value compared to what else available and although the room was on the small side they are quite adequate, perfectly clean & the bathrooms are fine with good showers and lots of black granite. Only down side I could find was that there was no shaver point in the bathroom. There's no air conditioning either, or none you'd want to turn on because it was so noisy, but then it's also in central London so there's going to be noise one way or the other. The location is excellent though as its just around the corner from the British museum, Oxford street & Soho is only 5 minutes away too.  I only realised after the second night there that I had actually visited the place nearly 30 years ago before it was the St Giles, I'm sure it used to be the central London YMCA back then which would explain the small rooms & the excellent health club facilities linked with the hotel for a small fee, I think run by the YMCA

<Title>“Well placed good value hotel”
<Content>This hotel is in a fabulous location for visiting London if you want to be able to reach Oxford Street and the theaters around Leicester Square. Its within easy reach of Tottenham Court Road tube St and not far by taxi from Kings Cross Station. We booked tickets and an overnight stay via a theatre booking site and could not have been happier. The room was small but clean and offered the usual amenities, including a hair dryer, kettle, TV etc. The bathroom was tiny but nicely finished, the only disappointment was a luke warm shower. Breakfast was continental or English with plenty of food, but the restaurant area was a bit like a canteen with slightly over zealous clearing staff practically removing your plate before you'd finished but at least there were no dirty plates lying around and the area was clean. Be warned you cant get into your room until 2pm but you can check in and leave your bags with the incredibly helpful concierge service. The hotel bar is as usual expensive we had a glass of wine and a jack daniels and that set us back £14 but the noise from the bar is carefully managed as when you leave you cannot hear it within the hotel. Check out is 11am which with breakfast running from 7.30 to 11am is managable. Overall I would say it was worth the small room and luke warm shower to stay in the location.

<Content>Stayed here for my partners birthday and the location was very good, just at the end of oxford street and easy to find. Restaurants and pubs nearby, rooms a little small and could do with decorating. Had a problem with the light wouldnt work was told someone would come up but didnt so had to tell them again and we then figured out the problem however no staff had came therefore bad service on that front. The staff were a little rude waited to check in and stood for a while whilst staff talked away. I was expecting more considering I had paid over £100 pounds without breakfast.

<Content>Excellent hotel. Great location, very close to Oxford street. Easy to get to- Tottenham Court Road tube station is a short walk. Close to nice restaurants, convenience stores and shops. The hotel staff were very helpful and polite, concierge staff were excellent when we asked them for directions and information on tourist attractions etc. The bedroom was clean and tidy, perhaps a little bit smaller than most budget hotel rooms, but this was fine. Theres a built in wardrobe so theres plenty of storage room. I would absolutely stay here again, I did a lot of research before booking and it was one of the cheapest hotels in London, definitely excellent value for money!

<Content>Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights from 29th Feb. Booked show and stay. A busy hotel. Reception staff very pleasant. The room was adequate although a bit warm. Bed comfortable. Undisturbed nights sleep. Good shower. Breakfast was self service and very good. Sets you up for a days sight seeing. Location is excellent. Easy walking distance to theatre land or Trafalgar Square. On leaving, the doorman was extremely helpful. He went to the main street to flag us down a taxi cab and helped us with luggage. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a reasonably priced central hotel in London. I would have no hesitation in booking this hotel again should I return to London.

<Title>“Only plus: location”
<Content>I can imagine tourists appreciate this hotel for its location. However, I stayed here on business and did not appreciate the hotel at all. It started after check-in: I couldn't use the elevators as there was a fire alarm, but hotel staff in the lobby encouraged me to use the stairs 'as it was probably a false alarm'. I did consider going up the stairs, but the staircase was very narrow - and flooded by hotel guests coming down because of the alarm. I decided to wait for a while until the chaos cleared. Once in the room, it was really small - even for London standards. Two things I really didn't appreciate: there wasn't a power outlet in the bathroom and the windows had a type of blinds that could not be completely closed. As I went to bed I also realised that - being in the so-called 'West Tower' of St Giles - my room was looking over the very busy Tottenham Court Road. This meant a really bad night with a lot of street noise. I couldn't wait to check out.

<Content>Just needing somewhere to sleep for a night, I didn't want to pay £200 for a room. However, I didn't want to stay in a basement in South Kensington either (thats what you normally get for £80 in London) St Giles Hotel was a pleasant surprise. I paid £85 for a room (incl. breakfast) and got a perfectly adequate nights stay. Nothing 5 star about it, but if you want 5 star the Dorchester or similar can be easily booked :-) Overall, the staff were friendly, check-in efficient and the rooms clean and tidy. Breakfast was OK, don't expect a full english. If you normally use a Travel Inn or similar, check this one out as an alternative. Well recommended for those on a budget.

<Title>“Enjoyable stay!”
<Content>We stayed at the St Giles overnight on the 21st Feb. with friends. We had tickets to see We Will Rock You at the Dominion (excellent show!) and decided to make it a shopping / theatre trip. Our booking was made through www.activehotels.co.uk and we opted for Deluxe Rooms as the price differential was so small. When we arrived at the hotel we found we had been upgraded to Executive Rooms at no extra cost. Even though we arrived at 12:30pm the rooms were ready and had adjoining rooms with interconnecting doors (we had not requested adjoining rooms so this was a pleasant surprise). The rooms were on the 10th floor so we had wonderful views over London. Complimentary tea, coffee and water in the room. Plenty of towels and very comfortable bed. Bath robes also provided. The rooms had air conditioning which allowed you to set the room temperature for your own comfort. A further surprise was as we had been upgraded to Executive Rooms breakfast was included. This was served in the Hakuba Restaurant - choice of full English or hot selection cooked to order in addition to cereal, pastries, juices etc! We had driven to the hotel and there is an NCP Car Park underneath the hotel which if you speak to concierge before you leave is at a discounted rate. We found all staff to be helpful and yes the lifts (4 of them) did tend to be busy in the morning but this is a large, city centre hotel! Did not have to wait more than a couple of minutes for the lift! Have experienced worse! All round a very enjoyable stay helped perhaps by the upgrade (I normally use activehotels.co.uk to book hotels and this is not the first time we have had an upgrade). Would certainly stop at the St Giles again whether for leisure or on business.

<Title>“Excellent location...”
<Content>We got the tube to 'Tottenham Court road' from Euston took less than 5 mins! The hotel was easy to find a 5 min walk straight up the road and it was the 2nd avenue on the right hand side. There is a theatre as soon as you come out of the tube station on the street, currently showing we will rock you... Lots of shops right outside the hotel! Appearance from the outside wasnt anything special although the reception area was lovely. Freindly, helpful staff on check in. Information staff were rubbish, they were all foreign and when you asked directions and information on a map they couldnt help! There was a bar with sports showing on the tv to the left of reception that was open till late and a coffee shop above. Check in was quick and easy, but we had already booked online with laterooms in advance, we just paid the balance £197 for 2 nights and got the key to our room. We were staying on the 3rd floor, the room was tiny and as for the bathroom it was impossible to dry yourself in there it was so small! To be honest the room did have everything we needed, we werent in it long as we were out sight seeing etc. Shower was good, very clean... For a cheap stay, in a great location this hotel is perfect! Dont recommend if you want a nice hotel room to spend time in...

<Title>“Won't be staying again.”
<Content>My husband & I went to St Giles hotel in london on 24th Feb 2012 and we were highly dissappointed. The room was tiny & we had the worst nights sleep ever due to a hard creaky bed & rubbish pillows. After a day walking round London & being 6 months pregnant a good nights sleep is essential. Because of our lack of sleep and back ache we did not enjoy our second day in London. We will not be returning to this hotel in the future, you would get more for your money and a better night sleep at a premier inn.

<Content>What an awfull hotel the rooms and the bathroom are so small with tiny narrow windows it reminds me of a prison cell. not one English member of staff . The dining room is like a school canteen. Location is good but that's all I would not stay again a travel lodge would be more comfortable and half the price

<Title>“Good location, disappointing room”
<Content>I stayed in the St Giles hotel, London, for one night on business. Location wise, it couldn't be better. Just over the road from Tottenham Court Road tube station, and only 15 minutes walk from Covent Garden. The building itself is not good looking at all, a horrendous piece of architecture, but the reception area is okay, and I was beginning to think that things were looking up. The room was a twin, wasn't very big, but for one night on business, it was fine. Clean and comfortable. The bathroom was stupidly small. It's amazing how they fit everything in there. Breakfast was a complete nightmare. I hadn't booked breakfast with the room, so was informed that it would be £9.95. Pretty much average for hotel breakfasts, so I agreed. When staying in a hotel, breakfast is usually a fairly relaxing experience. Take a seat, order some coffee and a couple of rounds of toast and peruse the menu. NOT in this hotel. It's self service so you have to grab a tray and then queue for anything unto 20 minutes in order to get a hot breakfast. On the way to the hot food I passed a tray of croissants, bread rolls, cheese, ham etc. After grabbing some hot food, I made my way over to the juice, only to be told that there wasn't any orange. Okay, coffee then! Then I looked for a table. The place was packed and people were having to share tables, which were packed in so tightly and I had to get up and move at least four times to let other people leave the table or get to a seat. My hot breakfast was a bit of a letdown, so I decided that some toast would have to do. After walking around looking for toast, I asked a member of staff, who informed me that they 'don't do toast'. What? A hotel that can't provide toast at breakfast? Instead I was offered croissants or a bread roll! Not quite the same thing. The only way that I can describe breakfast is that it's like a busy service station. Too many people, no where to sit, and poor food. Never again! The hotel itself is fine. Great location and okay rooms, although it needs some serious updating. And the lifts are very slow. Expect to meet a lot of people marching down the stairs on a morning, after having waited what feels like an eternity waiting for the lifts to arrive. I would stay again, but only on business, and I'd take a walk down the road and find somewhere else to have breakfast.

<Title>“Handy for shopping”
<Content>Im going to start off by saying you get what you pay for; this is one of the cheapest hotels in the Oxford street area of London. So don't expect the Ritz for travelodge prices! I stayed in a single room which is very small and fitted out a bit like a cabin on a ship. It had everything you need and is clean but dated and the furnishings are a little 'tired' looking. The shower room was tiny. This meant the room became a little stuffy, and the window only has restricted opening. Breakfast is self serve and to be honest a bit of a cattle market. Mine was included in the room price, but even so there are plenty of good coffee houses within a minutes walk so I'd skip the experience and head out. What makes this hotel good is its fantastic, enviable location at the end of Oxford street and within walking distance of Covent Garden. Personally, I only use it for sleeping in, so I can put up with slightly lower standards in a trade off for convenience to the main shopping areas. If you want luxury, don't come here. If you just want a clean bed to sleep in near the shops, this might be for you!

<Title>“Very convenient hotel”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in February. The hotel has a great location and is very easy to find. Tottenham Court Road tube station is only a few minutes walk from this hotel which was perfect for us as we do alot of tube-hopping when we visit London. The rooms were a little bit on the small side but the beds were extremely comfortable and the room was very quiet. Bathroom was also small but very functional with a great shower. The only complaint I had was that the lifts were very slow and sometimes when they arrived they were full. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel as it is very good value for money.

<Title>“London Weekend”
<Content>Didn't enjoy the stay in this hotel one bit. The room was tiny, the hotel would not rectify the mistake of room booking so we had to stay in a twin room with 2 very small beds in a small room with very small cushions rather than pillows. Staff were not helpful and the breakfast was poor - the hotel was very busy but had the feeling we were cattle as opposed to guests!

<Title>“St. Giles Hotel & Leisere ClubLondon”
<Content>This was our first time to London and we found it to be as every bit expensive as people had said. With that, we found the St. GIles NOT to be very expensive and for the location we just could not find a better hotel. Great central location with wifi, walking distance to most tourist attractions, souvenir shops, restaurants and nightclubs. I personally found the hotel to be a bit older and not as impressive as some of the others aesthetically speaking, but the wood panalled walls and desk were a very nice and elegant touch. For the price and location we highly recommend this hotel. The staff was very helpful giving us tips on were to go for shopping or dinning, using the concierge name helped us get a table without waiting even when the restaurant had a 30 min. waiting list! I don't recommend using the London Black Cabs however. One drove us around the block when we were trying to make the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace in time. We missed it and we ended up paying for a trip around to the back of the hotel. Good luck arguing with them either, as we found out this is a nasty little trick the cabs tend to play on tourists. The cleanliness of the hotel in my opinion could have been better. Upon inspection of the room I found the sheets to be crisp and clean with the bathroom smelling of bleach which I'm not complaining about so I did like that part. As with most European hotels there was no A/C unit so we had to open the window which was nice but being in central London street noise into the early morning hours was a bit of an issue. Overall yes I would stay at this hotel again but steer away from the cabs and just use public transportation. The bus drivers are very forgiving for tourists and go pretty much where you need to anyways. For rates and availability on this hotel just go to www.Jalooka.com. "Would Jalooka That!"

<Title>“Fab London location”
<Content>Second visit to St Giles and even better than previous experience. Hotel couldn't be in a better location, one minute off Oxford Street, 30 seconds from tube. Staff are nice, concierge in particular are very helpful and friendliest people we met in London. Several nice restaurants on site and bar with nice atmosphere. Also swimming pool, health club, coffee shop, casino. I was visiting London with my Mum and had booked a twin room. I asked if it were possible to get a double bed for my Mum when booking and this was provided at no extra charge. We in fact had a fab room with a separate adjoining room/alcove where my single bed pulled down from the wall - once down it was a proper single bed and exceptionally comfortable. Rooms are tiny but spotless and with everything one would need. I would in particular recommed our room (743) as we each had our own little bit of space and privacy and it was also a quite room. The hotel in general looked refreshed and cleaner than on my last stay in 2008. All in all, highly recommend.

<Title>“Not Over Priced, great location”
<Content>Found that London can be a bit of a Nightmare for hotels. Lot of Hotels have extremely small and out dated rooms. My one at St Giles was not big, but was great for me, I had a double, but single occupancy. Clean, with new amenities which was appreciated. The location is fantastic, right bythe tube and a supermarket very close by. Would definitly stay here again. Only down side was the lack of seating to cope with all the customers at Breakfast.

<Content>My friend and I have stayed here twice, in January and November of 2011. The first time we our room was extremely small, but we really didn't mind. The second time we got a much bigger room located on a higher floor. It was so amazing to watch the sunrise over London from our window! This hotel is great for a girl's weekend in the city, with lots of shopping and drinking. For a romantic getaway? Not so much.

<Title>“Excellent location - shame about the rest...”
<Content>Firstly, you cannot fault the location of this hotel, five minutes walking distance from Oxford Street, 15mins walk from Covent Garden - most excellent. Swift and efficient check in / out. However, from there on in it significantly goes downhill fast. The corridors are old and tired - a labyrinth of corridors, all tatty and in need of recordation and new carpets - ASAP. My friend and I stayed in a twin room for two nights and although we weren't in them long there were extremely claustrophobic. Again decor and carpet need lots of attention. We stayed at the rear of the hotel and on the Friday night we got no sleep at all - noisy bar or club downstairs that went on through the night - boom, boom, boom noises constantly... Breakfast is a complete joke - I appreciate we stayed the weekend before Xmas 2011, however it was so overcrowded I wished we'd not booked breakfast and eaten out. The large breakfast room was completely self service once you'd entered, and the stations with the food were so inadequate - my friend queued for a cooked breakfast for over 20 minutes and having still not gotten sight of the front of the queue decided against it... So much of the food had run out and was not replaced on either morning. Waiting staff did nothing but clear tables, hardly any replenishing took place. Our first morning we were saved by having a croissant (remind me how much we'd paid for the room including breakfast) and a coffee. Our second no croissant in sight even though we were in the room for 30+ minutes. Finally, whoever heard of a hotel that didn't serve toast at breakfast??? I stay in a fair amount of hotels on pleasure and business - in this country and others, and not once has there never been toast!!!! You even have to pay a fee for each bag left with Concierge (!?!?!?!?!) - thought this wasn't a budget hotel?! I'd give this a wide berth until they've addressed a number of fundamental issues...

<Title>“Average - okay at St Giles”
<Content>I have stayed at St. Giles a number of times but this was the first time for a while - and nothing has changed. It is a hard review to write because some things are good and some things are less so. The location is superb, it is at Tottenhem Court Road tube station and the top of Oxford Street. The lobby is impressive, marble and very well presented - it looks like you are staying somewhere very classy. You also have access to a swimming pool - and you can tell because the smell of chlorine overpowers reception. Check-in was quick and easy and staff excellent. The negatives are the rooms - they are small (average I suppose for London) but they are dated (tv's are quite good), carpet and sheets very old fashioned and carpet in room and in halls is torn and frayed. It was, however, clean. Overall I would not say don't stay at St Giles, for its price (I paid £90) it's more than acceptable for London and for work or if you are only going to be in the room for a short time or a few days. However if you are coming for a week or so or are looking for a romantic stay with a bit of style I would look elsewhere.

<Title>“location and leisure club”
<Content>Honestly saying, there are two good things to be said about this place. It is the location and the unique access to the Central London YMCA Club – any guest of the hotel is allowed to use all the facilities in this gigantic leisure and fitness club for a nominal fee of five pounds! You are supposed to pay for it at the hotel reception desk and then you only need to use the hotel lift to get to the YMCA club which is located just in the basements of the hotel. I recommend a swimming pool with two types of sauna just next to the pool. Well, since I was regularly going to the club and having a shower there I was lucky to avoid using my room’s bathroom – tiny with an old shower and peeling paint… The room was tiny too, one of the smallest single rooms I have ever seen! But I would not say it was not clean. It was clean and have all the necessary equipment except the internet which is accessible but not free (10 pounds per day). Still, I would come back there because all the inconveniences are compensated by the location – just in the heart of London.

<Title>“Two night midweek stay Central London”
<Content>We booked a twin room and a single room by phone direct with the hotel. On arrival we were pleased to find the single room was upgraded to a twin. The rooms had single beds and tight on space for two people but adequate for a short stay. The rooms were on the 5th and 7th of 9 floors so it was nice and quiet being high up. Rooms were very clean, beds were very comfy. Bathroom was small with a good hot shower. One room had a blocked shower tray but this was fixed the same day after reporting it to the very polite and friendly reception staff. The concierge service was excellent providing transport info. Breakfast was good with lots of choice from continental to full English. I recommend the croissants and the scrambled egg.( no fried egg or mushrooms). Nice little cafe in raised front lobby area. Fantastic location a short walk from British Museum, round the corner from Tottenham Court Rd Tube, lots of buses to all tourist spots. The no.1 took us to and from the Aldwych Theatre on the Strand in less then 10 mins.I highly recommend this for a short stay.

<Title>“Fab Service- Night in from the snow”
<Content>My mothers late birthday treat with my cousins & friends could have not had a very happy ending all due to being stuck in London, coming out of the theatre and finding ourselves in the heavy layerd snow fall. Although it was a lovely suprise with a few hidous giggles it took us all by suprise. Living just a few miles away in Kent, the taxi ride home, was becoming a nightmare. We walked for 20mins trying to get shelter as taxis were taking an hour or longer just in Covent Garden to be arranged due to weather conditions. My nan and my aunts were in their early 70's but getting them into the warmth was priority. I rang my husband to try get him to find us a place to stay but having managed to walk around we came across to the St Giles a big hotel with a very helpfull and politefull door man Dave whom met us on arrival, my aunt and i went up stairs to try ask for a room or beg that they would put us up for the night knowing prices for a Friday was to deter us away or just being told no rooms, however a big saviour at last as one of the young kind hearted gentlemen; Shihab on his way up to the desk greeted us. I was tierd and cold and although a bit rudley asked if he could help us only knowing he was the night manager through the warm conversation by offering a room. He did what he could, as we waited patiently least in the warmth reasured by the security man Bart that Shihab would be more then going out of his own way to arrange a room for my elderly nan & friends and kindly assisting to finding the rest of us a close room at the My Hotel just the opposite road from the St Giles and putting in a plead for the prices qouted. So thank you. We took what he had presented us with & i must say we was delighted at being able to be provided of such delightfull service in the middle of snow struck London. You could never tell when in doubt, you would recieve such hospitable warmth like we did, but it sure gave us a roof over our head away from the cold snap.

<Title>“Good for a couple of days”
<Content>Just returned 4/6 Feb. Went there with my husband to see we will rock you great location 3 mins walk away which was quite handy, as we left the theatre it had snowed. The hotel is really close to the tube station so thats a plus. Check in went well even thou i had forgotten to print of my reciept got my e mail up on my phone no problem. Having read on tripadvisor about the lifts i e mail ahead and asked for a low floor i got the first floor and a recently refurbed room. It takes a while to get used to the set out and after 2 days i still did not find the stairs although i did not look to hard. As the lifts were ok and we were always lucky, by the lifts is a vending machine with chocolate crips soft drinks and beer, this was great for late night munchies. Did not bother to unpack as only there for 2 nights, was surpised to see in the bathroom only 1 hand towel and 1 bath towel for the two of us also only one pillow each had i unpacked would have found extra of each in the wardrobe , found them the next day. The room is possibly the smallest ive ever stayed in but it was clean as ok for a couple of days would have asked for a larger room if staying longer. Also found the room a little cold had the heating turned up full and because of the snow not warm enough but for all the time we were in the room not too much of a problem. later we walked to covent garden took us about 30 mins ate there walked back went to see the show, after the show went into the hotel bar for a night cap the service was very good Had a good night sleep no noise either inside or out. Breakfast went down just before 8 no problem got seated straight away and yes because it is self service has a bit of a canteen effect and like others have said miss a bit of toast, but i was happy enough with the choice, fruit, yogurt, pastries, cold ham and cheese, boiled egg, jams, cerals, bread rolls and the hot choice of scrambled egg, sausages,bacon,has brown and beans, left me full enough. This day walked to leicter square again about 30 mins. That night slept better having found extra pillows, breakfast next morning fine again no problem ,checked out by leaving the keys in the box on reception and made our way home. Would i stay again yes but as i said good for a couple of days and would recomend it on those conditions

The staff upon arrival couldn't have been more helpful , they helped us with our baggage ( which we had alot of ) . The rooms were cosy with one double bed and a pull out single bed , suited us all fine , no complaints :) ... Would like to say a big thank you to the staff on the concierge , the were so helpful , very polite ,... The bar and restaurant in the hotel are fab , staff very friendly . the buffet breakfast in the morning was nice , fast service . . It is situated in a great location just a 5 minute walk to Oxford street and a ten minute taxi journey to the west end . We will definitely be back to stay here and we have recommended it too all of our friends and family .

<Title>“St Giles Hotel, London”
<Content>Didn't start the weekend too well as we arrived at the hotel to the news that we didn't have a reservation (booked via a Theatre package on line), but this was quickly resolved. Great location!! Small slightly out of date room. The room could do with a drastic update. The wood pannelling is out of date and in the bathroom there was mildew on the edge of the shower tray and the shower head dripped. Breakfast was good with a choice of continental and english but no toast !! Towels weren't changed daily and we had to ask for this to be done. Other inconsiderate guests were rather noisy returning to their rooms in the wee hours of the morning but, even though the hotel was just off of Tottenham Court Road, you had little sound from traffic and the hustle and bustle of a big city. Would stay there agin for a weekend but no longer.

<Content>The rooms were a comfortable size, were very clean and smartly presented. The staff couldn't have been more helpful, and when we got stuck in the snow at Tottenham Court Road and the central line started to experience severe delays, the concierge Miguel still made the time to organise a car for us to get to Liverpool St in time for our last train. This was despite us having checked out that morning, so were not even really guests at that time. The people couldn't have been more friendly. We also arrived at the hotel for check in to find out we'd accidentally booked a double instead of a twin (I went with my mum) and they changed us to a twin without any trouble or charges. This good service is extended to the Lazy Dog bar next to reception, where the bar staff are keen to help and provide table service in a reasonably priced and smartly presented environment. It was a good place for a couple of drinks before bed close to the room because we had an early start the next day. I would really recommend the hotel to anyone, the price is excellent for where the hotel is, and the rooms are warm (once I turned the heating on which you can adjust to your personal preference), clean and comfortable. I'll definitely be staying again next time I'm in London, and would be more inclined to stay in London after a night out now I know this hotel is here.

<Title>“Great location, but poor quality”
<Content>This hotel is perfectly located just a few steps off Tottenham Court Road and two blocks from Oxford Street, as well as the British Museum. Unfortunately the rest is not so good. My room was very small, with peeling paint in the bathroom, and mildew stains in the shower. The breakfast is served in an environment that strongly reminds me of a loud high school cafeteria. The only plus, apart from the location, is that you for five pounds can get full access to a gigantic YMCA facility next door with pool, gym, fitness classes etc.

<Title>“Lovely weekend”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel for two nights with my elderly mother. I was a little concerned as quite a few of the reviews I had seen on trip advisor had been awful! I asked for a quiet room and was given a newly re-furbished room on the 8th floor. It was on the small side but more than adequate for a two night stay, clean and smelled fresh. I found the staff more than helpful and would use this hotel again.

<Title>“Good location and value for money”
<Content>I often stay here when in London. The location is excellent, right next to Tottenham Court Road Station. The quality of the rooms is also very good and I have always enjoyed the breakfast. The staff are OK, pretty average for London, and the hotel is reasonably clean and tidy and has the advantage of a swimming pool, though I have never used it. I have found their admin to be a little shoddy. Nearly everytime I stay here there is a problem with the booking and before I check in I am usually bracing myself for an argument at reception. To be fair to them, this has not always been their fault but I never seem to have any problems with other hotels and I do stay in a few. None-the-less I will probably stay here again next time I visit as the value for money is excellent for this part of London, though not all of the rooms have air conditioning.

<Title>“Once again, great value for money and great location”
<Content>We returned to The St Giles Hotel in January having stayed here in July last year. In July we booked a double room which was at a very favourable rate of which i cant remember. Anyway, the room we had was quite small, with only a little room around the bed. But it was clean and served the purpose for what we wanted. This time, we opted for a twin room and again was lucky to have got a rate of £90 prpn inc tax. This time our room was more spacious than the double and we booked this on the basis that twin beds would need more room than doubles and upon entering the room were proven right. So, apart from getting a great rate and being in great location for our needs (being close to the gay scene in Soho) if you are a couple and don't mind sleeping in separate beds for a few nights, might we suggest you book a twin as you will probably have a little more room. Another suggestion, the lifts can be slow at times so a room on a low floor might be worth thinking about and using the stairs might be quicker. BTW, we dined at the Ledbury and The Square on this visit, check out our reviews here on Tripadvisor...

<Title>“A very nice stop over”
<Content>We stayed overnight at the St Giles on January 30th as part of a theatre break deal. Check in wa quick and easy and the staff friendly and helpful. Room was small/compact but clean and functional. Tea/coffee making facilities good. Lovely constant hot water and the bed comfy. Although in the centre of theatre land we had no outside noise keeping us awake and I slept well. Concierge was very helpful - nothing too much trouble. Late night bar very lively but nice for a nightcap. Breakfast - although the restaurant is much like a school canteen it is clean and tables are cleared promptly. We ate at 9.30 - no major queues plenty of seating space and lots of choice. We've done overnight theatre stays on a few occasions and this would be my hotel of choice. Right in the heart of the West End and does the job at a reasonable price.

<Title>“Weekend break”
<Content>The hotel is situated near Tottenham Road underground and in a great location for shopping. We stayed for the weekend over the new year and paid a reasonable price. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. There were very tolerant and always happy to help. The facilities were great and the leisure complex attached is great value for £5.00. The room we had was comfortable, clean and great for the two of us. We would definitely stay again and a big thank you to the staff for a great weekend.

<Title>“Not great - but good if on a budget”
<Content>Stayed here at the last minute as I was going to meet some friends in London. I knew I wouldnt need to the hotel much so I went ahead and booked. Wow - i booked a single room...it was arguably the tiniest space I have ever locked myself into...however, saying this, it did contain everything I needed during my stay... There were problems with dirty carpet and bathroom was minute but, it served a purpose. All in all, it wasnt worth £74 a night... probably around £35... and as for the brekky, forget about it... its horrible. The coffee tastes of smoke (yes smoke!), the sausages are disgusting, the orange juice tasted like diluted juice with too much water, there was no proper Britich / Irish bread - the breakfast is a complete no go..! The good thing about this place? Its a terrific location but perhaps too central... its difficult to sleep in in the morning given its proximity to traffic, crowds, loud noises etc. Stay here if you are on a low budget, if you have a few quid, stay somewhere else...

<Title>“Convenient but manic”
<Content>Looked really nice online so booked for a couple of nights to go to the \theatre and Christmas shopping. Fab location for all theatres and shops, really central and near to underground. Room was tiny though, would have a like a bit more space - and this was before we went shopping !!!! I was really dissapointed. Breakfast the following morning was like a mad house !! No structure at all, it was a free for all, get a table where you can, if you can - as most were full, then queue for breakfast and drinks. Not the best start to what was going to be a busy day of shopping. Food was good though to be fair. Got back to room after shopping for hours, tired and in need of a shower and a rest, to find room had not been serviced. Complained to housekeeper who offered clean towels, we decided to make the room up ourselves - not happy with this even though the housekeeper apologised. All in all, great location, rooms small but adequate, service average, breakfast service poor but probably due to time of year - food was good. Would I stay again - No - Even though it was a busy time of year, I expected better for the centre of London.

<Title>“Excellent location, good value for money”
<Content>I stay here for two nights at the end of January. Check in was quick and easy and our room was clean and roomy enough. The bathroom was small but fine. The location of the hotel is fantastic and a good base for exploring the city. We didn't book for breakfast but there was a very long queue in the morning! Also we had to wait ages for the lifts as the hotel was so busy. Overall, I would definately recommend the hotel for those who want a reasonably price mid range hotel and would stay here again.

<Content>Booked very last minute to get in some Chrsitmas shopping in early December. My advice - don't leave your Christmas shopping so late! It was manic - the hotel was busting the shops so busy and public trnasport a nightmare! My room at the hotel was very well decked out but very small. The bathroom was excellent but the rest of the room very small. Their is a YMCA next door for those wanting a gym and a pleasant surprise was the breakfast which was good value. Overall a good expereince but far too busy and a bit cramped for me

<Title>“Location is everything”
<Content>Stays here for a week every January. The best thing about this hotel is the location; it is located next to Dominion Theatre and Tottenham Court Road Station, just next to Oxford Street. Very convenient for almost anything in London. The single rooms are tiny but clean. Breakfast is barely decent, but they don´t have toast. On Saturday mornings you might have to wait more than half an hour to get seated. There´s a good gym and swimming pool, but you have to pay a small fee to use it. The wifi access is a complete joke, and a bad one as well. I paid 45 pounds for one week access, and what I got was a very sluggish network. To make things worse I could only access it from the computer I bought the access from. So, no code which you could use for your other devices. There are also far too few (and too small) elevators, so during breakfast-time you can just about forget getting down with the elevator.

This hotel is VERY VERY tired and could do with a complete refurb.Rooms are dirty and no bigger than a shoe box, laundry and towels resemble "cream crackers" and the breakfast can only be described as the worst motorway service station platter but worse.AVOID!.

<Title>“Poor”
<Content>When I checked in there were 5 staff and one customer at the desk. One member of staff was attending the customer, two were on the phone, and at the Executive check in two young ladies stood chatting. Eventually one of them looked up, beckoned me to the desk and checked me in whilst she continued her gossip with her mate. She barely glanced at me, I was given no instruction about any of the facilities, time of breakfast etc, they couldnt get rid of me quick enough. Not a good first impression. Room, I had a double for single occupance, small, reminded me of being in a caravan. The bathroom was tiny, no bath just a small dingy shower. Attempted breakfast but room was packed and tables were on top of each other, queues everywhere. No chance of a relaxing breakfast so quickly abandoned that idea. Stayed 2 nights, didnt enjoy the experience, a colleague booked in at the same time was woken by a fight outside his room at 2am. I was booked in by my company, I am returning to London this week and was again booked into the St Giles. I have moved my hotel to one nearbye.

<Title>“Good value busy central London hotel.”
<Content>St Giles hotel is a large busy hotel, popular with tourists and business visitors requiring a good value hotel in central London. It is just off Tottenham court road close to the tube station on the central line close to British Museun, Oxford street, st Paul's, covent garden and so on. The rooms are a bit on the small size but very clean functional with tea making facility, TV, hair dryer and so on but a bit tired looking. I enjoyed the breakfast which offered continental and full English with lots of fruit and cereals. This is a good value no frill hotel that I use when on business, with access to the west end, but if you are looking for a high end hotel it's not for you!!

<Title>“So many things need changing”
<Content>I stayed at the St Giles hotel as I was attending a meeting in central London. I come to London around once a month and am limited to cheaper hotels by my employer's budget. I've stayed in a few hotels in the area which are roughly the same price per night and they are generally acceptable. The hotel is big and very busy, which you would expect for a hotel which is so well positioned. I was allocated room 729 which I knew was a twin room. When I got in to the room it was really warm and smelled stale, so I looked for the air conditioning controls, only to find that there isn't any air con, there was a fan in the cupboard, but all of the plug sockets were so far away from the bed I wouldn't have been able to position it anywhere useful. Another thing I noticed was that the room didn't have curtains, it had some venetian blinds inside the two panes which made up the window. The blinds did nothing to keep out the bright blue light which was outside my window, which made my room really bright (it looked like there was a sunbed on directly outside my window). As my room was positioned near the lifts I expected noise, but wasn't prepared for the relentless noise well into the early hours. Every time a lift comes to the floor it chimes loudly like a door bell, not once, but 4 times (although one lift chimes 6 times - I know this detail because I was kept awake until roughly 2.00am listening to it). Why the lifts have to do this I really don't know, I find it hard to believe that I am the first person to complain about this. The doors bang quite loudly on some of the lifts too which is irritating. The bathroom was very small, but functional, there is a huge amount of storage space in the room too, so I imagine if you are in the room for a long time this would be a bonus. I had breakfast included in my room rate, I went down for breakfast at 6.30am, so I could try and beat the rush which I have read about in other reviews. Breakfast is really basic, not much selection, but what was there was of ok quality. Bit surprised that there was no toast though. I think looking at the other reviews of this hotel it is the luck of the draw whether you get a good room or a bad room. I'm not prepared to risk getting a room like that again, so I definitely won't be back.

<Content>Being just off Oxford st & Tottenham this hotel is great for getting to all the West End has to offer. The room was on the small side, with little room around the bed. The shower room was also tiny. Overall it was a little dated but clean & tidy. The heat was a bit too much but opening the window sorted that. Hotel reception was good & check in smooth. The bar attached to the hotel was a bit grubby, with loud music & service without a smile. Hotel casino was a nice late night edition.

<Content>As I stay in London often I see many different standards of hotels. Everything about this hotel is average. The beds are ok, the shower is hot (no bath), the breakfast was filling. It is a hotel in desperate need of a re-furb. My room had no curtains and the decoration was cica 1975. BUT... if it is just somewhere to stay in the heart of London then it is ideal. Close to shopping, rail and tube stations etc. Loction 10/10... the rest 5/10

<Title>“If you're going to be busy in London and need a good base this is for you!”
<Content>The St Giles hotel is ideally located right at the crossroads of the shopping on Oxford Street and the nightlife of Tottenham Court Road, Soho, Covent Garden and Leicester Square. It is also really handy for the British Museum. It is also practically on the top of Tottenham Court Road Underground station, this gives access to both the Northern Line and the Central Line. In a few years, 2017 I think, this will also be really close to the new Crossrail Line that is currently being build. This is not a laid back hotel by any stretch of the imagination, you know that it is a big hotel as soon as you walk in the reception area. Having said that there has always been enough staff on hand to check you in swiftly. The rooms vary in terms of size, if you book a single room the room is really, really small, however if you book a bigger room then there really is plenty of room, i.e. you get what you pay for in terms of size. The hotel has a really cool bar on the ground floor, not the cheapest place to drink, but does give you a feeling of being in the buzz of central London. Many hotels have vending machines and ice machines on each floor, however this is the only hotel that I have ever come across where you can get cans of larger from these vending machines which I think is a really nice touch if you get back to the hotel and want an ice cold beer in your room. Just one thing that isn't a bad thing, but that you probably need to be aware of is that the breakfast is not what you might expect. It is very much like a mass canteen and is probably the only part of the hotel that lets the rest down. I think that they have to run the breakfast like this because of the size of the hotel. As I say, this should not put you off visiting, but if you're really into your full English breakfast this will not rank amongst the best you will have ever tried! The prices for the St Giles are usually fair, especially for it's location. It is not what you would call a hotel with the personal touch and you could feel like you are one of many many people staying there. Sometimes though if you're busy shopping, sightseeing, eating, drinking and taking in shows you really just want somewhere to rest your head for a few hours whilst you and London rests.

<Title>“Back again and again...”
<Content>We have been back to St Giles, off Tottenham Court Rd, many times during the last 20 years. Why? Mainly because it´s reasonably cheap, and it´s central both for shopping, restaurants and entertainment. It´s big and busy, but service has improved a lot in those 20 years. We usually stay in an executive suite as many of the standard rooms tend to be very small and cramped. This time we had a twin room, spacious as far as workspace is concerned (see below), but no free wifi; high up, so no noise from the street or the construction work on the new underground station. Here I´ll just list the drawbacks of this particular room: only one bedside table; almost impossible getting into bed on the window side (both of this because of lack of space); not enough luggage space if you´re staying more than 1-2 nights and have two suitcases +; light in the bathroom insufficient for make-up etc. The breakfast is good, and one can use the YMCA swimming pool next door for free. There´s a good Sainsbury´s just across Tottenham Court Rd, as well as a chemist´s. You walk to Leicester Square or Covent Garden in ten minutes easily. Along New Oxford Street there are a number of good restaurants/ cafes (5 min walk). The area is full of computer & camera shops. I´m sure we´ll be back again, one of these days!

<Title>“feel at home at the st.giles”
<Content>I have been staying here for the past several years since it was recommended by my Brother. Its the perfect location for a visit to London for the things I like to do. Near the theatres , soho, oxford street. I grab my camera and its a pleasant day walkabout to trafalgar, buckingham palace, big ben and so many sites. Its adjacent to the tube. In the evening a mere stroll to restaurants and theatres. The rooms are small but for the amount of time I am there, it makes no difference, I dont visit London to stay in my hotel room all day. The bar and restaurant are fine for when I need them. I've had pleasant help from the staff..and yes the elevators can be slow but thats because its always so busy because so many people stay there, and many are repeats like myself or are there on recommendation of others. I have recommended this to many people and everybody has thanked me, especially when you consider the price ..a great value for your money .I travel a lot , all over the world.Places like St Giles make it possible for me to make affordable trips ..i.e. i get to travel more often .I'll be back in a few months and cant wait...

<Title>“Nice holidays during New Year 2012”
<Content>Was there with teenage daughter and really we have no complains about the hotel (only the elevators are a bit slow). Service we got was ok. Everybody complaining about the size of the room I would calm down. They could pay more than 100Eur per night and maybe get something better. But I have experienced more expensive hotels in central London and already being very disappointed with really small rooms (and even only 70 cm wide bed!). Well, back to St Giles: Concierge immediately help us as we step inside the hall. Check in was quick and with no problems. Room (we used twin room in one of the middle towers) - for the central London located hotel can't imagine bigger as this. Room was nice, two normal size beds, with good quality mattress. Bathroom, small but clean and nice smelling. Room and bathroom was nice cleaned every day. Also there is tea&coffee heater, sugar, milk, tea&coffee bags every day. Stuff was very friendly. Who want to buy something extra food or drink can do it cross the road in a market. I would recommend this hotel to everybody who want to stay near West End, few minutes from British Museum and very close to many points of interest in central London. We spent very nice 6 days holidays there and last but not least - New Year's Fireworks was amazing :-)

<Title>“Anything lacking is made up by the location.”
<Content>I have stayed here on a few occasions now and on all occasions have felt I have had value for money. The location is brilliant. Rooms are small and quite basic but adequate for a cheapish centrally located hotel. Breakfast again adequate. Plenty of choice I did miss toast though. There are a lot of things which could be improved but overall it is a fair price for an average hotel.

<Title>“St Giles STOLE MONEY FROM MY CREDIT CARD”
<Content>Seriously, DO NOT stay at this hotel. Two days after i left, my bank informed me that they ILLEGALLY CHARGED MY CREDIT CARD WITH 400 GBP. I try to contact them, i talked on the phone with three or four people from the hotel, i sent five emails , I faxed them and they were just keeping me telling that " you need to speak with my colleague" . They refunded 300GBP, and and they just STOLE they rest. 100GBP STOLEN FROM ME BY THIS HOTEL. worst travel experience ever, especially for the way they treated me and ignore me. Of course I plan to sue them.

<Title>“Value for money”
<Content>I spent 3 nights at the St Giles Hotel at the beginning of December 2011 with 3 friends. We had 2 twin rooms. The rooms were small but clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. Breakfast was very busy, but that's to be expected from a busy West End hotel. We would definitely stay here again. I think it is a value for money hotel and those who have complaints about the size of the rooms, breakfast etc should pay for a more expensive hotel if they have too high standards.

<Content>Arrived to our pre booked standard room, which was tiny, dirty and very overpriced. Staff were helpfull in trying to relocate us, you get the feeling they do it a lot. Eventually had to pay for an upgrade to have any room half decent. It is close to the tube and the dominion theatre so as a plus you dont have far to go to get to the major attractions. We saw a travelodge furhter down the road, next time i will go there!

<Title>“Good Budget Hotel in the centre of London”
<Content>Had a minute single room. However it was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was adequate, although the breakfast room was more like a canteen than a Hotel restaurant. Having read some of the reviews, I was expecting the worse, therefore I was not expecting too much ! I would certainly use again if in London for up to four days. 50 yards from Oxford Street and 300 yards from Tottenham Court Road Tube station. Certainly better than some of the low budget Hotel chains. Next time will certainly use the Spa. This must be one of the best fitness centers in the area !

<Title>“Ticks all the Boxes for short stay in the West End”
<Content>We have stayed at the St Giles on numerous occasions for our annual theatre trip. We use the St Giles because it has fantastic location for our needs and is good value. We have never had a bad stay here and I wanted to add my comments to praise the hote, in light of more negative reviewsl. Always check you get the excellent value buffet breakfast included, we did not ,one year and missed out,getting Coffe'n Go instead (our fault). This year we checked in at 11-45 am with no problem. Yes the rooms are not massive, but what do you need for an overnight stay. The bed is comfortable and there are extra pillows. There is a kettle for a reviving cuppa and no problem getting extra coffee, milk etc. The bathroom was large enough and very clean, with a powerful hot shower. We were warned at reception that breakfast would be busy around 9 am and to avoid that time if possible. We went a little later and had no problem. The hot food is cooked fresh and an array of options on other items, including fruit, cheese, ham, cereal, etc, to satisfy the multi national guests. If you start your day hungry, you are an extremely fussy eater. You can leave your luggage at the concierge desk for no charge( we always leave a small tip), if you want to have a stroll round central London. You are a few steps from Oxford St, Covent Garden and the West End. It's only a 10-15 min stroll to Trafalgar Sq and then on to all the other main tourist attractions. Check out the various hotel booking sites on the internet for a few mins and you will always get a good deal on the St Giles. It always ticks the boxes for our annual theatre trips.( by the way- go to the Leicester Sq ticket booths, for half price or less, theatre tickets)

<Title>“Accomodation Size on St Giles Central London”
<Content>Stayed on this hotel for 2 day stay. Found the hotel quite nice and more than enough for what I needed. The relation quality/price is good, comparing to other hotels in the area. Location is the big plus here. It is very well located. Staff were great, nothing to point out. The worst for me was the room size. It is very small. I got a double room and still its very very small. I haven´t measure but I would say its 4sqm, and the toilet 1/3 of this. So very small. Apart from this I only use it to sleep. But if this would have been a relaxing trip and to enjoy the hotel I would have been very disappointed.

After complaining the manager told us they were full.They gave us another room, old and small bathroom, very small room...we were 3 in this room and we didn't have space to move or to open the baggages. They told me we payed for a 4 stars hotel but ST Giles is probably a 2 stars hotel...breakfast awful,service less than a zero... The only nice thing is the location...but do not go!!

<Title>“The people staying in the hotel let it down!”
<Content>I stayed here on a business trip on 14th December, booked by the company. I got an impression of crazed activity in the bar off reception, and shrieks of laughter every couple of seconds. The receptionist was obviously stressed and polite but distant. I think she was surprised when I smiled at her and said thank you. Plenty of lifts, and an ice machine in reception- plus points for those! The corridors were a bit maze-like but smelled of fresh paint so I thought it looked hopeful that the rooms had been refurbished. My room was on the second floor on a side branch of the main corridor and was through a fire door that screeched every time it was opened- which was frequently throughout the night. A bit of oil might do it good. The room was small but had been refurbished and was clean and tidy. The wooden surrounds around the bed and wardrobes looked fairly new and unmarked. The bed was comfortable ( I was in a twin) sheets were clean and had been changed. Pillows were fine. The television was a smallish flatscreen on the wall. Perfectly adequate! Tea and coffee, yes..again, fine. Hairdryer under the table..no trouser press, which was a bit of a minus. The shower room was newly refurbished, clean and tidy, no faults there. The only thing was the towel was too small. I'm little so just about managed but anyone over 5'2 would struggle! I didnot like the fact that there is no room service in the St Giles. When I am away on business I am alone and do not like eating in a restaurant on my own. Well, I had to on this occasion and the noise downstairs had put me off going into the chinese restaurant incorporated into the hotel. The bistro similarly looked frantic. This was only early in the evening. So I opted for the in-house Italian restaurant. I was glad that I had. Very peaceful, calm service, lovely Italian waitress who took her time and the trouble to talk to me about the food. The steak that I had came with a lovely salad and fries which were fresh and crispy- just too many of them for me! She went a step further at the time for dessert and when I asked about icecream with espresso, she said that the soft icecream that tehy served was no good with coffee on it, but she recommended the hard Italian icecream with expresso coffee on it. I have had them before but this was honestly the best one I have had in my life. Delicious! back to the bedroom. All was well until it was time to sleep. the traffic noise was minimal than kgoodness, but the noise from other guests returning to their rooms was loud and disturbing. People let their doors slam, they called upon their neighbours with bangs on the door and loud talking. Obviously these people had no manners. In the morning, all was hectic downstairs and I could not face struggling to have a civilised breakfast in that atmosphere, so I skipped breakfast even though it had been paid for. Would I stay there again? I might, and if I do, I'll go to the Italian restaurant again..and take my own breakfast and earplugs.

Shower: slow and dripping but clean (and a hole in the wall as the plumbing was a mystery, short pipes???) Breakfast feels like something you would get in prison and coffee HORRIBLE but the location made me forget all those small irritating things. Also very reasonable room rates, and very friendly and helpful staff. I would stay here again!

<Content>I stayed at this hotel on a theatre break was a good location for the show, Oxford Shreet and the train starions. The only bad points are that the rooms were quite small so can be a bit tight when both getting ready and that if you have more than 2 strands of hair the hairdryer will be no good, as you are better of with a towel. But I cannot complain about the location or the breakfast.

<Title>“A little gem in the heart of the City”
<Content>After reading other reviews we were not sure of what to expect, however as always we make our own minds up. We arrived early on 12th December for a two night stay (approx 12:30) and check in wasn't until 2pm. The receptionist asked if we had any preferences to which we said if possible could we have a refurbished and quieter room. There was going to be a slight wait for this room to be ready and so we were able to leave our luggage with the concierge. Check in was quick and when we got to our room we were pleasantly surprised. We were given room 508 on the 5th floor, the room had been renovated and had everything we needed (see photos). The room was compact however this suited us, everything was to hand - after all who needs a massive room with lots of unused floorspace? The bedroom had a double bed, x2 spare pillows were available on the wall unit as were x2 spare towels. The carpet was new and freshly vacuumed.There was also a small flat screen tv, electronic safe, kettle with tea, coffee, milk & sugar, fan and also a hairdryer. Everything was immaculate and very comfortable.There was a handy window with privacy blinds (this was great as the room did get a little warm from time to time). The bathroom was refurbished and had a bath and powerful shower, liquid soap and shower gel was also provided as was a shower cap and plenty of loo roll. There were a couple of big mirrors that were handy for getting ready to go out. There was also a full length mirror on the back of the room door. Each day we went for breakfast early and then came back to the room to get ready. After leaving the do not disturb sign on the door (correct way round) we were not hurried to vacate. The first day we left the room at 9:30am and the day of leaving 9:45am. Each floor had a handy vending machine, surprisingly the goods were not that expensive, 50p for crisps and £1 for water, there were also cans of alcohol and fruit drinks available. Breakfast was from 6:30am, we decided to get there early and beat the rush. The buffet style presentation comprised of bacon, sausage, hash browns, beans, scrambled eggs and rolls & spread. There was also cereal, croissants & jam, grapefruit & ham - more than enough to set you up for the day. If you get there early there is plenty of seating which is not crowded. Beverages consisted of fresh orange and apple juice and tea and various coffees - all self serve and unlimited. What we liked was the unobtrusive staff - they were very friendly and helpful when you needed anything. We did also take advantage of the coffee to go on the mezzanine level - lovely frothy cappuccino for £1.50. Check out was 11am on our last day - really quick check out and we left our luggage with concierge again until we got our train. The helpful concierge even hailed us a cab to the station. There is no actual charge for leaving the luggage - this is totally voluntary and more than deserved by the staff. I can only think that the bad reviews are from visitors that did not get a quiet refurbished room, the staff were great and we cannot fault the service we received. Would recommend this to anyone visiting the capital.

<Title>“great location and value for money”
<Content>The position of this hotel is ideal for sight-seeing. We asked for a quiet room so were on the 9th floor overlooking the frontage. The room was very small, but well appointed and adequate for our needs. it was immaculate and well decorated. The bed was comfy and the shower-room, again tiny was quite adequate. There were smaartly dressed polite helpful doormen and concierges and all staff were very polite and helpful. The 2 criticisms are that the bar area on the ground floor is too small and noisy when busy andthe buffet style breakfasts were much too canteen-like. This WAS a youth hostel and one can see why it is like it is, however for what we paid and wanted we can't complain.

<Title>“Central, clean, comfortable and cost effective”
<Content>We stayed at the St Giles for 2 nights on the 4th and 5th December. We had booked at the Comfort Inn, Edgware Rd but walked out after seeing the disgusting state of the Hotel. The St Giles was ideal. Situated right next to Tottenham Court Road tube station, it is an ideal base to explore central London and for shoppers it is around the corner from Oxford St. The hotel was clean, the staff were professional and it more than catered for our requirements. We were worried that the Hotel would encounter major noise but there was no problems whatsoever. If you are looking for a simple, affordable and centrally located hotel, the St Giles ticks all the boxes. We stayed on the 2nd floor overlooking a quiet street and the room although small (where in Central London isn't!), was clean, modern and airy. It also has a leisure facility, bar which has SKY Sports and a casino on site. We will almost certainly stay again.

<Title>“So Central”
<Content>Just back from stay at St Giles. Location could not be better for us ie sight seeing,shopping and going to theatre. Right beside tube and bus stops. Get daily ticket for zones 1 and 2 for £6.50 per day. You can also walk to most places from here. Good choice of places to eat nearby and not expensive. The type of dining we do on a city break is more of a food pit stop than sitting over food for hours. Rooms are basic but everything one needs on a city break are there, shower ,tea/coffee facilities, hair dryer. On day of your departure luggage can be left in a secure place for all day ,if required at no additional cost.I left a small tip for this service. Only downside for me was access to lifts. Because of number of floors they are nearly always full..

Room noisey at night due to location by Tottenham Court Rd & lacked good double glazing. The staff were amazing, so polite & helpful. We ate both nights in hotel, Italian restaurant served great food, lasagne £8.95, Chinese was similar price, with great food also. Hotel charged us only £1 per bag to keep bags after check out. This is a great hotel for the price & location. I will stay again.

<Title>“Excellent for the money”
<Content>After booking this hotel as part of a theatre break I was nervous of what to expect after reading some truely awful reviews. However, I was more than pleasantly surprised. On arrival at the hotel just after 2pm we checked in swiftly and easily, despite the girl checking us in hardly raising a smile I really don't care, she did her job swiftly and efficiently and that's what counted for me. We were given a room on the first floor and found it easily. Upon opening the door I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room. We had a twin room at the back of the hotel which was immaculately clean and smelt fresh. The bathroom was also sparkling and although there was no bath, we hadn't gone to London to spend hours soaking in a bath! The beds were very comfortable and the linen clean and crisp. There were tea and coffee making facilities in the room for a hot drink when you came in from a long day/night in London. There is a flat screen television if you want to watch a bit whilst relaxing in your room. I was also pleasantly surprised that there was a massive, well lit mirror above the dressing table, under which was located a good hairdryer meaning it was easy to blow dry and style hair without having to stretch to other mirrors or have none at all which so often happens at other hotels. I found the temperature of the room to be perfect for me, however if it was too warm a large, quiet fan for you to use. In the morning we went down to breakfast around 8.30am and yes, it was very busy. However there were plenty of places to plonk yourself down for a quick breakfast. The breakfast was nothing special but perfectly edible. Continental wise there were croissants, rolls, preserves, yoghurts and three types of fruit. Hot food was limited to Bacon, Scrambled Eggs, Sausage, Beans and Hash Browns. Perfectly acceptable for a 3* budget hotel. If however this isn't to your taste there is a Cafe Rouge and a Garfunkles literally two minutes round the corner which both serve breakfast. Upon checking out we asked if we could leave our luggage and it wasn't a problem. Not sure why people were charged £1 per item, we were not charged at all. The concierge who organised the left luggage was cheerful and happy to help, as was the girl who checked us out, very smiley and extreemely professional. The location of the hotel for the price is absolutely fabulous. About half a minutes walk away from Tottenham Court Road tube station, The Dominion Theatre (Currently hosting the absolutely brilliant 'We Will Rock You') and Oxford Street. During our visit we saw the musical 'Wicked' at the Victoria Apollo and would reccomend to anyone, an absolute spectacle! For those on a budget it is absolutely perfect, and for those who complain all I can say is you can't have a champagne lifestyle on a lemonade budget!

<Title>“Worst hotel in the UK”
<Content>Well I was unfortunate enough to be booked into this Central London Hotel for (thankfully) one night. Quite simply it is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, anywhere. The room was dirty, I would not have wanted to walk on the carpet barefoot and there was a large chunk of enamel missing from the bath. Please bear in mind this is a central London hotel, literally in the heart of the shopping district. When paying Central London prices I expect a few things to come as standard - as they do in EVERY other hotel I have ever been to. These are: Free wifi both in the hotel and in the room a selection of coffee, tea and hot chocolate with a few biscuits in the room toiletries to be provided such as soap, shower cap, razor and toothbrush, shower gel etc double glazing that WORKS... I had to clean the bath before I used it and was still wary of getting in due to the chunks of enamel missing. The standard stuff like a few sheets of notepaper and a pen/pencil by the phone was also absent. There was a note stuck to the wall in the bathroom stating that toiletries could be purchased from the vending machine by the lifts on my floor. I looked and it only contained a few bars of chocolate and some cans of beer. There is an ice machine but its on the ground floor and nothing was provided to carry the ice up to my room. In the end I didnt bother. Somehow they manage to block the London-wide free public wifi signal forcing you to use their own very expensive service. The rooms in the pictures on the hotels website are certainly NOT rooms in this hotel. They might be in one of the other hotels in the chain but definitely not this one. The air conditioning was far too loud so had to be kept off the entire night leaving the room extremely hot. There were no curtains on the window. The window itself was double glazed so I mistakenly thought I would get a peaceful nights sleep ready for my meeting the following morning. Despite the window being firmly closed I was awoken at 5.30 the following morning by very noisy traffic and shouting outside. I should not have been able to hear any of this, especially considering I was not facing the street and I was 5 floors up. The breakfast the following morning was a cheap disgusting hot buffet. The scrambled eggs were completely flavourless and the bacon overdone. Again, in Central London I expect my breakfast to be cooked to order not a help-yourself affair with every other guest breathing and coughing over the uncovered trays of food. I had a very unfullfilling breakfast which made me feel sick afterwards. If the room was clean, the bathroom repaired and the breakfast cooked to order, the facilities would be just about passable in a small town outside the city, maybe somewhere on the coast. Not in central London. The room was tiny, maybe 10' x 10'. This might be ok for a single room but mine was a double. One final gripe, the water pressure was so low it took me more than half an hour to run a bath. I will never again trust the rooms shown on a hotels website and I will certainly never be staying in a St Giles hotel group hotel again either. I did make a complaint but it has been ignored. Very, very poor.

<Title>“DONT EXPECT MUCH”
<Content>What can i say about the St.Giles in London we arrived Fri 2nd Dec at 13.00 our room was not ready but we expected that because booking in was from 14.00 fair enough, on our at 15.15 return we handed over the slip of paper we had been given at 13.00 thinking this would not take long WRONG it still took the reception another 10mins to locate what room we were in the only thing i liked about booking in they have a barrier system and nobody can push in front of you. the room we had was very small on the 6th floor you could not open the window very wide to look out over London due to the room only being small there was only a shower which is ok if you did not want a soak in the bath,also sometimes you were waiting a long time for the lift. the breakfast room I found was like siting in a works canteen also the waiters not very helpfull. just a tip also on your last day when you book out of the hotel our Train was not until 15.00 so we left our suitcase in the left luggage they charge you £1.00 for looking after your case other hotels I used they have never charged me before so on a trip to London make sure you don't spend all your money keep £1 for that service. me and wife had a fantastic weekend and if you are booking a weekend away for a show you must see GHOST THE MUSICAL fantastic but pick another Hotel.

<Title>“Couldn't have asked for more”
<Content>We stayed for one night at this hotel and found it to be perfect. We found our twin room to be a good size for the price, especially as it had a separate sort of annexe with a door leading to the bathroom. The room was very clean and comfortable. Check in was easy peasy and very quick. The room wasn't ready as we were earlier than the check in time stated on our reservation, so the excellent concierge service took our luggage whilst we went off to enjoy ourselves in Covent Garden. After a good night's sleep, as the hotel was surprisingly quiet, we had our excellent buffet breakfast the following morning. Limited choice for the cooked breakfast, but piping hot which is very rare for a buffet breakfast. Nothing was greasy, and it was all very fresh. The breakfast room had plenty of empty tables and all tables were cleaned as soon as people left. We checked out, again very easy, with no problems. Then for a nominal £1 we were able to leave our luggage with the excellent concierge again, whilst we went off to enjoy the British Museum. When we got back to the hotel to pick up our luggage, the concierge hailed a taxi for us (right outside the door of the hotel) to take us back to the station. Could not fault this hotel in anyway. Great location, great service, all for a great price. We will definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Great Location excellent hotel”
<Content>We stayed for three nights at the end of November and booked a deluxe room. The romm was good with a separate seating area with tv, fridge, safe, teamaking facilities and aircon. Bedroom and bathroom were small but we expected this. We arrived early from our flight and when we asked if we could drop our bags reception checked and found that our room was ready so they booked us in. We were surprised to find that the price included a full cooked breakfast in a private restuarant. Location is perfect next to Oxford Street and within walking distance of theatres, museum etc. Would recommend the hotel.

<Title>“St Giles is what it is, a fair 3 star in a fab location.”
<Content>Stayed here with a large group on business for three days. Very easy to find, just a couple of minutes from the Dominion Theatre on the Totenham Court Road tube (now re-opened) or from Holborn. Rooms very very clean but most of our group moaned on about thiers being very small. Were were short of towels and coffee but after a chat with reception they were brought up in minutes. Bathrooms tiny but hey you don't live in them. Good shower. No toiletries you can "steel" but a bottle of generic soap supplied...stuck to the wall and shower cubicle. The room was typical of a 3 star, oakwood paneling anddecor which could have been any hotel any place. Compact, yes but very clean. This is a very very large hotel and you will battle for a seat at breakfast if you are not early enough to beat the old folk on bus tours staying at the hotel. Get to breakfast early, you have been warned. Food was fine but no toast or fried eggs or banannas...bummer. Fair selection at breakfast but not extensive. The food that was there was good enough for me. Buffet style for continental or full english...I had both. To pay for full breakfast is £9.99. Some used the small onsite shop. Reception is always very busy in the morning but if you are checking out you can just drop your key in a box and go. Concierge was on hand 24/7 and answered all our questions, though a smile would be nice. We arrived early but we were able to leave our luggage. The hotel has a small shop selling hot and cold drinks with sandwiches and snacks. The rocky road cheese cake was fab. The £2.98 special of a drink and a cake was handy. Enter the hotel, go up a few stairs, then turn hard right up another small set of starirs and its next to the loo. VERY useful as its open to the pulic and it's much cheaper and quieter than the surrounding tourist trap cafes. For £5 you can use the impressive sports centre of the YMCA as the hotel has its own entrance. Very nice 25m pool and loads of gym stuff. Some classes. They have lockers for £1 deposit. I have two major beefs with this hotel. 1. the lifts take forewver to arrive. Most times I just took the stairs. 2. our party had two people per room but they would not issue a second keycard or allow us to leave our keys. This caused us MAJOR logistical headaches as our group often spilt up and on many occasions a person was left waiting for the other to come back. Staff - the cleaning staff were always polite. The reception staff were to the point but without personality. Watching them do thier job from the chairs in the small shop it was clear they had to "process" large numbers of guests and they often worked long hours, but a smile costs nothing. Location - a couple of minutes from Oxford Street and the British Museum. Right in the heart of shopping. Other guests - Due to its size the hotel seemed to attract its fair share of touring groups on buses and many internatioanl groups. pretty much as you would expect. Would I go back...yes. London has far more crappy hotels than good ones and this one was ok for the travelling person on a budget.

<Title>“Pleasent stay”
<Content>Worried a little about this hotel after reading some reviews on here. Emailed hotel asking for a room above floor 7 & at the back of hotel. When we got there they hadnt recieved the email, anyway we were put on 4th floor but room at the back of hotel. Room was fine, didnt find it noisy, there is a fan in room if u get too hot. Only complant i will mention there was always a wait for the lifts & were usually full. This is a very busy hotel & breakfast is a nightmare with the amount of people i would reccomend a late breakfast to be sure of actually getting in, food plentyfull but was a queue for the cooked food.. Will use again

<Title>“Good location”
<Content>The location is good. The room we had was tiny. We hardly had space to move around in a twin bedded room. My roommate had to squeeze along the side of my bed to get to the one cupboard we shared for her clothes. To use the drawers for her underwear was so awkward, she shared the drawer with the bible on the small bedside cabinet. On using the tiny shower cubicle I tried to alter the temperature of the water and almost scalded myself - once you're in there, there's nowhere to dodge out of the way while you get the temperature right. In the restaurant there is not a teaspoon in sight - just plastic things to stir your coffee or retrieve the tea bag from the cup. On the plus side, it is clean and the concierge were friendly and helpful. The impression you get on arrival is let down by the rest.

<Title>“perfect location, clean and friendly for a good price”
<Content>myself and a friend spent a long time looking for a hotel in central london for a reasonable price, this ticked all the boxes so we booked a twin room for 2 nights. i was a bit concerned as a lot of the reviews were poor. however we had a pleasent suprise. we got there early and checked in with no problem, as we were early we were able to safely leave our luggage in the hotel (free). its not a grand or posh hotel but for £200 for 2 nights in a twin room - it was friendly, comfortable and clean and the rooms were big enough. we had coffee to go option in the price which was fine - a drink, pastry and piece of fruit. location was about 2 min walk from Tottenham Court Road Tube so was great for accessibility.would def stay again and reccommend to friends.

<Title>“Could not sleep”
<Content>The hotel was nice,clean and in a great location. The windows are not sound proof and I did not get a wink of sleep. The streets are soo loud and London doesn't sleep so neither did I! Did not enjoy the pillows either they were thin and uncomfortable. housekeeping woke me up at 8:25am and I didn't have to check out until 11am so I wasn't happy after a terrible nights sleep to be disturb at that time.

Service was fine, room was clean and because the window was wide open when I got there not too hot (unusual for London hotel). About the only negative was that virtually every chair in the bar had ripped seats - otherwise hard to fault

<Title>“wouldnt return”
<Content>This hotel does have a great location central to most things. But the rooms were dated and are very small and extremely hot and you couldnt leave the window open as the latch was broken.The bed was certainly not a double more like 3/4.Again the bathroom so very small felt very claustrophobic in the shower,taps leaked all the time and only one bath towel was left.I was a little let down as the pictures on their website looked lovely!It was nice and clean though.We put a do not disturb sign on the door and staff still came in!Our day of departure staff woke us up knocking the door at 8am asking what time we were leaving-so rude, when you dont have to vacate until 11am.Breakfast leaves alot to be desired it was like a cattle market we had to return twice until we got a table.Maybe a reservation system would be good?They do not serve toast first time iv ever seen this in a hotel and only one type of egg scrambled.Very disappointed and few staff members were very rude.Next time i will stay on the outskirts and travel in to the centre would rather a nicer hotel like the crown moran.

<Title>“Hotel centrally placed for all attractions and shopping”
<Content>Stayed for 5 nights in this hotel It is in a great location a few minutes walk from soho and oxford street, it is 50metres away from the underground and 50 metres away from the Dominium Theatre which was a bonus for us as we were booked into a show there. Unfortuately the first night we didn't get much sleep as there was so much traffic noise we were on the 6th floor on a corner of two noisey streets.The room was fine and had been updated although the bed was a bit soft. We asked to change the rooms the next morning, which they did straight away the receptionist was very helpful and understanding. We were put on the 9th floor where we heard very little noise for the rest of our stay although the room was ok and practical it could have done with up dating and a lick of paint but was clean.The buffet breakfast was average but there was choice.All in all a good stay.

We were told we had been upgraded but as our room was the smallest we had ever stayed in I don't see how that was possible! We stayed 3 nights and if it hadn't been for the location we would have moved. Oh - and the shower was cold every day despite telling reception. Not great people!!!

The place itself is good, the restaurant food was lovely and good value for money. The beds and pillows were awful. This was worse than a travel lodge and that's saying something for basic. It's a shame but would not stay there again on that basis.

<Title>“Perfect Location, good value for money”
<Content>Before booking into this hotel, I had read awful reviews in the net. Given the perfect location, especially when you have a small kid and need to be central AND reasonable in price, I was sure I would give it a try. So I learned from the reviews and made sure, they booked me into a renovated and quiet room. Therefore my experience was positive and I will be using this hotel again during my next trips. Yes, the entrance of the room is tiny, the door doesn't open widely, as well as the window, which is small and doesn't fully open. The bathroom was nice and in order (black tiles). Small TV, water cooker plus free coffee/tea, safe. I declined from breakfast since there are lots of coffee shops and supermarkets around, so no experience with that. I also had a coffee in my room before I left in the morning. There is a nice bar in the hotel, and the fitness club below the hotel. Entry is 5 LE per person, you can buy tokens from a machine and then use the club with the hotel towels. Pool is quite cool, not advisable for kids (yes, I tried ;)), it's a sports pool (of course in a fitness club). All in all, try this hotel, make sure you get a renovated room and accept, that for this location and price, the room HAS to be small and a bit old-fashioned. Just don't expect too much. For a few days, it is absolutely fine and in 1 minute you are on Oxford Street, or in 5 min. at Leicester Sqr.

We found the staff friendly, the breakfast plentiful, the rooms small but comfy & the location fantastic. The ONLY negative was the room got extremely hot, we had the heating off & had to open the window during the night which cooled us down but let in a lot of noise.

<Content>Stopped at this Hotel Sunday 20th November for one night - very helpful staff, check-in quick and easy - good and not expensive restaurant's / cafe's within the hotel complex together with a Spa pool and gym (cost £5 to use the Spa). Breakfast was very adequate for a Bed and Breakfast Hotel and the turn-around for clearing the tables and service was very good. All the staff in the Hotel were very friendly and efficient. Rooms were small but had everything you could need and want from toiletries to T.V. and tea/coffee making and a safe. Very good value and would recommend it to anyone. The Hotel is situate at the corner of New Oxford Street and very Central to all the attractions - 2 minutes walk to the British Museum (free entry) and within walking distance to Covent Garden/Soho/Theatreland etc.

<Title>“Good Stay in Central London”
<Content>I stayed here with my mother on a cultural visit to London for her birthday. I thought the price was pretty good considering the usual rate for hotels in central London. The hotel is quite basic but you get what you pay for. The location is excellent expecially for the British Museum, China Town, the Underground station right practically right the doorstep and the whole of the West End at your disposal!! The room was quite hot but it was understandable for such a large building plus there was a fan provided so it wasn't too bad. Overall the cleanliness was to a good standard but it would have been nice to have real teaspoons instead of little plastic stiry things which melted inhot water! (silly little details but my mum and I like a good cup of tea so it was noticed!) Reception staff were efficient (not very talkative) but check in was fast and smoothly done. We were pleased by the ice machine located on the ground floor by the lifts but slightly disappointed WIFI is not free in the hotel as it was measleadingly advertised on the site I booked through. We had dinner in the Italian on site restaurant and on the whole were pleased with the food - it was quite basic but value for money. The bar at night was quite lively which was nice, they serve the drinks at the table so you don't have to stand at the bar for too long. All in all it was a pleasent enough hotel and we were pleased with our stay here. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it.

<Title>“Fantastic hotel in heart of London”
<Content>My 15 year old daughter and I stayed here for a sight-seeing/ theatre/ museum/ shopping trip. We found it to be an excellent, central and great value place to stay. Staff, especially the concierges, very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. We had a twin room on the first floor at the back (Room 180) which was perfect. Amazingly quiet at night as not on the main road. (I imagine rooms at the front might be noisy.) Compact but clean and tidy room with both bath and powerful shower. Great all-channel TV which impressed my daughter! Another reviewer had suggested having breakfast in the Cafe Rouge round the corner rather than in the hotel. This was a lovely suggestion and the staff there were very welcoming (and the breakfasts delicious). Trafalgar Square, Oxford Street, British Museum, lots of theatres and restaurants all easily walkable. But also a stone's throw from Tottenham Court Rd underground and on good bus routes. (We took the No 24 - virtually outside the hotel - to Camden Market and back for a great day trip.) Would definitely stay here again. A great, good value hotel allowing more to be spent on London's many attractions.

<Content>Travelling on business, when I get to my hotel I just want to relax. The room was small and stuffy and very hot with no air con. A slightly damp smell too. I think there a probably better options in a similar location for a similar price. Try the Radisson Kenilworth just round the corner. Much better hotel.

<Title>“good every time”
<Content>i have stayed at this hotel several times , rooms although not the largest are well appointed with all you will need for an over night stay ,right by tottenham court road tube ,on the door step of we will rock you show ,this hotel is very well located .20 mins walk will get you to other theatres restuarants etc. if an offer with your booking book the breakfast a self service job , very busy at times ,food hot and plentyful , the hot servery could be bigger to speed things up a bit. otherwise the £10;00 they charge is a little steep only because off the self service cafe enviroment , this is not a relaxed breakfast affair ,its a bit fast paced and noisy at times.

<Title>“Staff 5*, other NOT NOT worth the money”
<Content>First of all all my congratulations to most of the hotel staff...they were great!! Chinese male receptionist kind ands patient, a waiter at coffee shop above reception(think he said he was from Albania ) great and pleasent and at the end-a portugueese doorman, best of all. And that is where my kind words stop. The hotel has so small rooms and I supose it is ok but only if you are alone. The bathroom was ok . The pillows were so so small and they smell bad.It was not possible to open a window( only a little), the main light did not work but only thethree small once so I needed to light up all of them to see.....The hairdryer did not work...only if you would keep the red button all the time. The guest directory is full of informations on how hotel is not responsable for lot of things and they do not guarantee for lot of them, but I never found , for example, how to call from room to room???!!??? Aha, the breakfast, poor and like you are in a hostel, even worse ....the food so so not good... All in all , I would recommend it only to somebody who wants to be in a Centre of London and does not mind the food and accommodation....

<Title>“Doss house”
<Content>From the outside and at the reception, the hotel looks fine, but the illusion ends there. At reception, I was greeted by a rather surly chinese woman, who barely looked up , handed me my key, and informed me that I was on the third floor. Got to my room and couldn't believe how dark and pokey it was. The decor was wood-chip wall to wall, the furnishings were from the 1970's and the bed had a distinct sag on it. The carpets in the room and hall were so filthy I didn't dare walk on them without shoes. The only concession to the 21st century was a wall-mounted flat screen TV which was so pootly fitted that they hadn't even attempted to hide the cables which ran back to a plug and socket perched precariously above the desk and mirror. Breakfast ranked amongst the worst experiences I have ever had. The choice for cooked breakfast was dessicated bacon, some cheap sausages, plastic scrambled egg and a potato and onion "rosti" which was swimming in grease. The layout is terrible - everything is everywhere and the experience/decor is what I can only describe as a second-rate school canteen.....I got in and out as fast as I could. Apart from location, there is really little positive ti say about this hotel and at £135 for one night I can't even say you get what yuo pay for......terrible, avoid like the plague. I won't be back under any circumstance.

<Title>“Great value and location.”
<Content>Ok this is really simple to review. It's in a great location for shopping, nightlife and theatres and by using booking websites, meant we got b&b for £50 pppn. Absolute bargain! Overall, this is ok but as you imagine, in a central location like this it has a massive turnover. Therefore everything looks 'well worn' and a bit battered and tired. The rom was ok but small but hey we didn't go to stay in the room all day. Athroom howecver was large modern and spotless. Breakfast resembled a staff canteen and again, everything was a bit battered but clean. We're staying here again next month but won't bother with breakast. I'd rather go to a Costa/Nero etc. In summary, this DOES represent xcellent value for money for central London. If you're seeing a show or doing xmas shopping you won't get better vfm or location.

<Title>“Nice hotel, great location, very reasonable priced”
<Content>I booked this hotel as part of a theatre package deal, and have to say I was pleasantly suprised. Great location for central london, so easy to get to from the tube station, and a quick and easy check-in. We had a twin room, which was quite small but still ample room for two of us to be comfortable in. Very comfy beds, and it was clean and pretty quiet considering it was central London. There was plenty of storage space in the room, and the bathroom was nice and clean. Breakfast was included in the price, all you could eat and plenty of choice, and no queueing for anything. As we had to check out at 10am but weren't leaving London until late afternoon they let us leave our luggage there, which was easy to leave and easy to retrieve again. I would definately recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Great For The Price”
<Content>I first stayed here for a weekend in july 2009 and returned in August 2010. I found it to be great value for money, the rooms were clean, breakfast was generous and tasty. The location is fantastic, in walking distance of the theatre district and picadilly circus. It isn't a five star luxury resort but it certainly doesn't cost as much, and if like me you just want a base from which to explore all day, then it's perfect.

<Title>“Reasonably priced central hotel”
<Content>We stayed here beginning of November 2011. We used it as a base for shopping and the Theatre This hotel is basic however it ticks all the boxes as its very central for shopping, theatre.and the sights.Yes I am sure ther are alot better hotels in London but we paid £211.00 for a double room for friday and saturday. The room was clean plenty of hot water and it served its purpose.It has Tea & coffee making facilities as well. The double room was small. A twin room is alittle larger. This was our second visit to this hotel. I consider it was value for money considering the hotel prices in London.

<Title>“Great location, comfy room, great breakfast, great facilities”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at the St Giles Hotel and Leisure Centre end of 31st October/ 1st Nov 2011. Its a lovely modern well run hotel with great facilities, very nice spacious and comfy rooms, nice restaurants and was reasonably priced for a 3 * hotel. Its in a very central location near the British Museum. The staff are all very professional and helpful and speak excellent English which is a novelty in a London hotel. I do have arthritis and some minor mobility problems and getting up and down the stairs at reception and to the self service restaurant was a struggle but I was offered the wheelchair lift (which I declined as I managed ok if slowly). We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone on business or a shopping, sight-seeing or show break. There were lots of French families with children so its obviously good for families too. The food in the self service restaurant (and the decor) is very nice and plentiful.

<Title>“Good location, dated hotel.”
<Content>I have stated here several times on business and have never had any reason to complain. The staff are polite. The rooms are small and fairly clean, but are very tired and dated. As with the rest of the hotel, I feel a refurb is overdue. As this is a busy hotel, you can sometimes hear other guests moving around the corridors, which is irritating. Also, make sure you hang your DND sign if you don't want to be woken up by housekeeping! Overall, good value for money considering the area, however it is nothing special. Great if you just need somewhere to sleep for the night.

<Title>“Very average trying to look good and failing”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel 3 times already, mostly because of the location. But I decided that this time is my last time. I had enough. It is bad value for money. Its one of those cases when an average hotel tries to look better than it is, and fails miserably. First of, my booking was messed up. Twice. I had to call twice to correct it and when I arrived I found out the second part of my booking was still messed up! I'm very tired of the staff that just isn't qualified for their job. When I was checking in, I specifically asked for ai quiet (very light sleeper) non smoking room (as I have allergies), and a good view. I get to my room and guess what I get - first room down the hall from the elevator, the noisiest place! and I open the door and guess what - strong smell of old cigarette smoke and the view at the wall! I go downstairs to change the room and the guy who checked me in immediately disappeared as soon as he saw me. The other girl immediately gave me a room on a different floor (ask for 7th, it was renovated, unlike 6th). On my second part of stay I had an Executive double. The only good thing I can say about it is the size of the room. Everything else is... There is no single drawer in the room, or a proper shelf for clothes or underwear or cosmetic stuff. I guess they think foreigners don't wear underwear and don't need a discreet place for tampons (sorry for being so blunt, but I'm so mad!). Its just stupid! Cheap plastic in the bathroom instead of tile, smell of sewer, tiny sink, cheap plastic shelf thingy where they put the hotel provided shampoo and other stuff, a shelf for the shower itself that doesn't stick to the wall, a very old blow-drier and the list goes on and on. Seriously. If you call a room executive double and charge the money you charge for it, have the decency to furbish it as such. The room where I stayed at the beginning of the trip, a simple double, had this very old blow drier that is stuck to the wall of the bathroom, very loud, very broken, very sad... And non existent sound proofing. The door is heavy but I was woken up every morning by the knock on someone's door at 8am with loud words "housekeeping". The elevators are a joke. They are programmed in such a stupid way it will take you ages to wait for it and then ages to get to the floor you need. The only good thing about this hotel is location. But there are much better and cheaper hotels in the area. Seriously. I tried to get used to this hotel for a while, but I just had enough. It was my last stay.

<Title>“Good for the money”
<Content>Me and my mum stayed here for a girls shopping/theatre trip and wanted a hotel with a car park and very central. However we know that is hard to find in London unless you pay alot for it. But this hotel was great, basic rooms which are quite small but clean and comfortable for our stay as we were hardely in our room. The bed was comfy and it had a tv with all the main channels which was great! Come out of the hotel, turn left and a sainsburys is there so you can get abit of food shopping or grab a paper, then head further down the road and your at oxford street! I couldnt fault this hotel however if your looking for luxury, expensive, big rooms it isnt for you. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will be returning in the future.

<Title>“BETTER THAN EXPECTED”
<Content>Hotel was adequate and breakfast fine with enough variety to suit all. Its very big and reception was quick and professional. Our room was good and relatively clean - we asked for an upgrade for double glazed windows as we were told it is very noisy - met people who had not slept for the noise. As previously stated its very near to lots of sites. Walking distance to Leicester Square and Covent Garden and in other direction Oxford Street etc. The waitresses were a bit too quick at whipping away plates and cups when you had not finished which needs addressing but overall for one night it was good enough.

<Title>“Good value”
<Content>We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights in October, I have stayed at the hotel before last year. It is a very average hotel, but the location is really good. We stayed in a twin room, it´s very small, but it´s clean, the carpet seems a bit worn out and maybe not so clean. One very bad thing was that the room was extremely warm, and we could only open the window a little bit. I will probably stay there again.

<Title>“Average. Lovely desk staff but rude breakfast staff.”
<Content>We arrived at the hotel as part of a thompsons sport group. The hotel seemed nice our room wasn't ready but they did there best to get it ready for us. The room was really small and they where hammering in the room next door. The room was so warm and the windows hardly open. What I didn't like was the breakfast. I appreciate it was busy was the weekend at half 8 so I was more than happy too wait my turn I say down at a booth type table I pulled a seat do my boyfriend could sit opposite. A member of staff ran over and pulled the chair away and spoke to me like I was 7 saying I could not put a chair there. I shrugged it off and went for breakfast. I went too get hot breakfast and went for the spoon, I dropped ONE bean and one of the kitchen staff where disgustingly rude and snapped at me too put my plate closer, when I did he looked at me and and said it doesn't matter now it's been done picked up the bean and threw it into the kitchen. I'm sorry I dropped ONE bean and was spoken to disgustingly. I was do upset I proceeded too check out early! I was too embarrassed to complain.

<Title>“Don't stay here ! Simple as that !”
<Content>On arrival at reception, the staff member was quite surly, not a good start, but never mind I thought, it's not personal ! The key did not work on arrival at room and I was told I was doing it wrong, I'm 48 and capable of flashing a fob at a door ! The tiny single room was very basic, and the bed was ok, the bathroom tiny with the most enormous step into the shower. The worst thing was the breakfast arrangement, it is more expensive to buy online than in the hotel. It was, as others here have said, like a school dining room, with long queues for everything, You collected a tray for a self service buffet, very poorly laid out, not enough tables, if there is two of you, unless you left your belongings on chairs while you waited in the queues (they admit it can be 20 minutes queuing !) then you would have to take turns to eat ! Madness ! The food was very poor quality too. The lifts were crazy, with people waiting for ages at peak times, because people were so fed up they were cramming into the overcrowded lifts, to the pont that several times people had to get out so it could move. Just dreadful, they just cannot manage the amount of people they squeeze in there.

<Content>A very last minute stop so was lucky they had a room, though staff on desk could have been friendlier. It's a bit of a labyrinth through the corridors but once found the room whilst it was hardly cosy in its smallness it was functional. The shower wasn't the best in terms of cleanliness but decent otherwise, and luckily I wasn't interested in the view as windows were a bit mucky. Clean room elsewhere though. Bit friendlier on check out and didnt take breakfast so can't comment but for the location it's ok for a night.

<Title>“Anarchy at Breakfast”
<Content>Mobbed from the minute we arrived until we left. Room was OK, small and rather hot with no aircon and it was to noisy to have the window open. when trying to get to sleep noise from lifts was annoying, it must have been pergatory for those with rooms next to the lift shaft. Breakfast was like a primary school canteen with long queues, too few tables and very sad food. The hotels was full of tourists as its situation was good for shopping [ Oxofrd Street ] or visiting the theatres in the west end.

<Title>“Beware”
<Content>Stayed at St. Giles as a part of a sports package for a game at Wembly. Room was so tiny suitcase had to be stored in front of exit door. Shower had no water pressure and no hot water, forget washing hair. Mold in shower tile and on shower curtain. Room was on 11th floor and street noise was so loud could not sleep. Hallways are so narrow could not pass with suitcase when maid cart was out. Toilet did not flush and when we reported it were promised service. Had to go to lobby or next door to casino to use toilets. At check out still no service received. Breakfast room is very large but bread rolls were cold and stale, orange juice was watery and sausages were inedible (had to spit them out). Breakfast is served early (6:30am) so we were able to eat before leaving for early flight. Hotel is not handicap-accessible (flight of stairs up to lobby area where lifts are located) and elevator to advertised 12th floor and rooftop was out of order with a "will be fixed soon" sign during entire stay. Not at all close to Wembly so not a great choice for any sports packages, ie. two tube rides with over an hour travel. Beware walking anywhere near the front door of the hotel, impossible to breathe with a constant crowd of smokers directly blocking the doors. They have a touch key system in which the key cards must be expensive since the key card has a 6 inch x 1 inch plastic fob attached with a warning about charges for lost key card. Very inconvenient to carry in pants pocket. So relieved I had chosen another hotel for the previous part of the trip.

<Title>“Mediocre tourist hotel”
<Content>Many of the previous reviews have summed it up pretty well. It's a hotel aimed at the mass tourist trade. The decor is a bit worn and the rooms are normal for London - small and poky but typical of the area. The bed in my room was broken, so I asked for a room change and this was granted without any hesitation. Full marks for that. The second room was a slight improvement on the first, except that the fan was extremely noisy as a bearing seemed to have worn out. The lift doors at the far left hand would not shut properly, leaving the lift stranded on the ground floor with people (including myself) in it. A bit scary for a minute. There is an ironing room, which was very handy. I wondered how I would get an ironing board up in the bedroom as it was so small, but this was not necessary. If you use it make sure the iron is clean. Someone had melted some material onto the iron and I had to rub it off once the iron heated up. The breakfast experience was awful. The dining room, whilst large, was crowded. I had to queue to get a table, and when I managed to sit down the food was poor. The coffee was weak, the "orange juice" was orange water and the sausages were very cheap, overcooked rubbish. As for the rest of the food, well I can only say that this was a one star experience. Any tourists visiting London from another country please do not think that typical English food is normally anything like this. However it was obviously not all bad - The concierge was helpful; the hotel was packed with people, and there were lots of smiles and laughs, so a lot of people were obviously enjoying themselves. If you want a hotel in the centre of London, near the underground railway network, in close proximity to the theatres then this will probably suit you. If you are a business person, or looking for a carefree romantic weekend then my advice is to look elsewhere.

<Title>“Even for the money - I wouldn't recommend it”
<Content>The location is fairly good - and that's the best thing this property has going for it. It's quite worn out - best way to describe our floor and room was like a college dorm that was past its prime - decor along with a slight odor. The place was obviously a favorite for tour groups as it was very full. We were able to check in/out quickly, even though it was busy, the desk staff was helpful. The coffee bar was just too busy, so we opted out of the free coffee offer (no coffee maker/etc. in the room) and bought our own on the street - the concierge was mobbed. Neither of those are deal breakers for us, you just have to wait your turn - but we wanted to get out and roam about... Bottom line, if you are looking for a romantic weekend or a comfortable stay with modern ammenities - don't book this property. If all you are going to do is crash in your room and you require fairly cheap accomodations - then go for it - it makes sense. Our goal was to have a fun weekend - fast and furious - shopping during the day, catch a play and stay out to the wee-hours & sleep till' we rise - so it worked out ok. We are heading back to London in three weeks and chose not to stay here again (actions speak louder than words).

<Title>“One night stay”
<Content>Bedrooms a little on small side but clean and beds comfortable. On arrival we were not satisfied with the first room as there was a very noisy fan we could not turn off. we were quickly installed into another without fuss. After spending the evening out we returned to the lively bar before we retired for the night. There was a party atmosphere and mixed age range. Staff served at table so no queueing for drinks. Our room was on 7th floor so were not disturbed by noise from the bar after we went to bed. we were woken by noise from the street in the early hours when the clubs turned out, but sleep with the window open, it was soon remedied by closing it. I can't comment on breakfast as we decided not to et before we left but can comment on bar snacks that were tasty if a little pricey. I would definately stay again as location is perfect. But not for more than 2/3 nights.

<Title>“Great location, too expensive for the quality”
<Content>Perfect location for London, especially for West End shows, and shopping. Hotel is not bad, but service is too slow, rooms are tiny, and beds are not quite comfortable. This hotel would be great if the room was priced somewhere around 60-70 GBP per room, but as iti s double than that, it is not such a great choice.

<Title>“Well worth a stay!!”
<Content>Loved this hotel. Very near a tube drop off point from Heathrow airport. About a 5 min walk from Oxford street and a 10 min walk from the best theatres. Everything you need within walking distance. Large hotel, rooms somewhat small though considering the size of the foyer. No air conditioning however rooms provide a large fan which works very well. Reception staff not overly friendly, still not exactly ignorant either. Very nice chinese restaurant downstairs and Italian one above foyer too. Internet access was handy as well. Swimming pool and sauna, and if you wanted you could have a facial or a massage which was well documented in the rooms guide. All in all, this hotel was good value considering its location and also considering the fact that nothing went wrong! Highly reccommend.

<Title>“Good location but unbelievably noisy!”
<Content>We stayed one night, a Saturday, for a late birthday present. Yes, it is a superb location especially for the British Museum. However, I agree about reception. Very unhelpful. I went down and asked politely if we could have some decaff coffee sachets, she did not seem to know what I meant and just said NO! The room was on 5th floor and perfectly OK and very clean but it was very hot as it was sunny and there is no a/c. The Concierge were much more helpful and did provide us with decaff coffee. BUT the big problem is the noise!! The windows were double glazed but did not shut out any of the street noise at all. Usually you can hear the sound get quieter as soon as you shut the windows but not here. The noise was awful. All night there was shouting and yelling and sirens sounding. Luckily I had a small radio with ear plugs and just plugged them in and listened to classic fm ALL night which did not shut out the noise but helped me not to focus on it. Never again. There may be rooms away from the street or, if you can afford an executive room, it may be different. We did not try the bar or restaurant.

<Title>“Location, Location, Location”
<Content>Stayed here for a whistle stop London theatre fest and the hotel is ideally situated for theatreland. However, this is not the place to stay if you want a place to stay with charm, character and a warm welcome! Checking in was a soulless experience - the member of staff we dealt with hardly looked up from her computer screen and so we weren't off to the best of starts. The chirpy chappy at the concierge desk next morning made up for it though - he managed service with a smile, which goes a long way in my book! Our room on the 6th floor was small but clean. Breakfast is an experience akin to a large High School cafeteria - and the menu limited if plentiful. The St Giles is a clean, handy place to sleepover in the capital if you are on a restricted budget and want to be centrally located - just don't expect any frills or ambience! It may also be worth pointing out that there is some construction work going on around the nearest tube stop, Tottenham Court Road, so not all services stop there at the moment.

<Title>“Popular "hotel machine"”
<Content>This hotel is very large, and very popular. However, it is a hotel machine, and the reception area is totally chaotic at times. Reception staff not particularly friendly, some of them seems to be pretty sour, but it varys. Chaos by the elevators, so don't be in a hurry. Problems with the electronic keys, we had to go down twice in two days to get the key "re-charged" as it didn't work when we came in again. We had a executive suite, and it was ok. 28 sq.meters with a double bed, living room area, and large bathroom. Some will probably react to the frosted glass in the window between the living room and the bath room, and also the frosted door to the bathroom. The room had good AC and a fridge with complimentary water. Nice cleaning. Ate a great meal in the Italian restaurant on the arrival-day - friendly staff and great food. The breakfast was served in a separate place for executive rooms, and it was never crowded, the food good, and the staff was really friendly. Will probably not stay here again, because of the logistic problems they seem to have when it comes to reception area and elevators, and the constant crowd that was there. But, if you just need a place to sleep, this hotel's location is unbeatable.

<Title>“Great location but shoddy hotel with comical staff”
<Content>Stayed here for one night as a business trip. Reception fine, room tiny and bathroom likewise. Middle of the night I smell tobacco smoke. Could not tell where it came from save for through the airvents. At a loss about it but it was very strong and unpleasant. Made the mistake of eating in the restaurant as it was a corporate do. What a nightmare. I have never eaten such a poor meal. Soup was seriously like water with bits in and the waitress managed to pour it all over my jacket and down my back as she attempted to pass it to another diner!! The rest of the meal was just so awful that I went to bed starving gave breakfast a miss and had a croissant on the run from starbucks. Not a great hotel, adequate at best, dreadful food but in a good location.

<Title>“Threadbare carpets but friendly service”
<Content>Location of this hotel is brilliant and the staff were very accommodating and friendly - which is not always the case in London! The hotel seems to be a favourite with tour groups which makes it crowded most of the time. The rooms are really small (not unusual in the UK). The carpets on the 7th floor were really worn - a renovation is long overdue. BUT I would probably stay here again as it is in the budget price range that is affordable.

<Title>“Great location shame about the hotel”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel last weekend, simple message AVOID, AVOID, AVOID ! The only positive to report is the location the rest is terrible. Breakfast was a joke (you cannot even get a slice of toast !!) rooms tiny decor old and tied and the staff either don't care or or are so badly trained they don't know what to do. Reception is a joke and when you have the cheek to complain they just shrug and ignore you and then we get to the cost, you get all this "wonderful experience" at a premium rate and that does not even include entry into the leisure centre for which you have to pay £5.00 PER VISIT !! NEVER AGAIN

<Title>“This hotel is tired and in need of refurbishment”
<Content>The location of this hotel is quite good as right by the Tottenham Court Road station and the shops in Oxford Street.However the hotel is extremely tired and in desperate need of refurbishment. The check in staff lack personality and are rude in their approach. We were passed from pillar to post with one girl looking at us as if we were aliens! The girl that finally dealt with us was very nice but one out of four is a poor ratio. The first room we were given smelt so we requested a change. The next room smelt exactly the same... assuming they would all be the same we accept it. The rooms are very small as was the bathroom. When the shower was on the rest of the bathroom was soaked. If you want a good nights sleep I would not suggest this hotel as extremely noisy. If you open the window the traffic noise is unbearable. Breakfast was very good. The concierge was also very helpful. Considering the price of the hotel compared to a Premier Lodge I think it is quite good.

<Title>“A Great Deal”
<Content>I too was a little apprehensive about staying here based on some of the reviews. I chose it because of it's location and it's cost was very reasonable. Check-in was easy, receptionnist pleasant and effecient,we arrived around Noon hoping to at least stow our bags, but the room was infact ready. We were on the 9th floor. Room was clean and functional. No smaller than other central city locations I have stayed in. A nice view of th BT tower. The exhaust fan didn't work, so first time the shower was used the room did get a little steamy! Lifts were no great problem, there were tea making facilities and the flat screen tv worked fine. I would certainly stay here again. The rooms could be a little warm during the Summer, as I didn't see any evidence of air conditioning, but in London I doubt it would be a deal breaker. For the money I thought this place to be a good deal. I didn't take the breakfast option, as there are many cool little places to explore in the vicinity. If I was paying 300 GBP a night as an average cost I would be disappointed but for the value we received it was great deal.

Dont know if the air conditioning in the bathroom was broken but after a luke warm bath(NO HOT WATER) and cold air blowing all night we were both frozen to the bone all night. We got up very early as we could not stop shivering . The room was otherwise very clean but small, and the breakfast o.k.

<Title>“What a dump”
<Content>Our hotel hadn't been cleaned. The carpet was covered in bumps and looked like it hadn't been shampooed in years. The woodwork was pretty shoddy. The divan bed bases were torn and were very shaky. The shower room was a hole in the wall, the tiles were covered in mould and all the seals were pealing off. This is supposed to be a 3 star hotel. we couldn't get to sleep due to noise from extraction fans or heating systems. Breakfast was basic with what looked like powdered eggs. The milk machines were broken and mugs were wet on the trays.

<Content>Since 1999 I've stayed at the St Giles if I can't find a good London hotel deal anywhere else. The location is fantastic just by where Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street meet so I can walk to all the shops, bars and restaurants. The rooms are basic but at least you know they'll be clean and the price is good. Its a good bedroom factory. Counter staff and doormen are always friendly and efficient.

<Title>“Great base for your London city break - but don't stay next to the lifts!!”
<Content>We recently stayed at the St Giles for 4 nights and, overall I'd say that our stay was a very good one. OK, the rooms are a bit on the small side but ours was clean and tidy and well prepared every day. At the end of the day, the chances are that if you've stayed here you're only going to use the hotel as a base for your shopping / sightseeing / business so you'll only be sleeping / getting changed there anyway! You'll certainly struggle to get a better location with Oxford Street less than five minutes walk away and some fantastic restaurants in Soho only five minutes on top of that! What I would say is make every effort to have a room that is situated away from the lifts! We were iniitially allocated room 532 which was great - until about 3am the next morning when it was obvious that the herds of drunken elephants trampling noisily past our room on their way to and from the lifts were going to continue doing so for quite some time - and so they did!! Next morning we got in touch with reception and told them our tale of woe. I would suspect that this was not the first time they'd heard this tale as they allowed us to change room with no hassle at all (I would have to say that I found the staff to be very helpful at all times) . After that, a great stay was had!!

<Content>We recently returned from a long weekend in London and stayed at the St Giles Hotel. The location could not have been better. Although we did buy a ticket to use the tube, due to its location this was not needed, as all the places we wanted to visit were within walking distance. If you are taking a theatre break then this hotel couldnt be better, We took th option which included breakfast which was plentiful. In fact we could not find fault at all. The only negative point was that they charge £1 per bag if you would like to leave your luggage following an early checkout! Would recommend this hotel for anyone spending a short time in London.

<Title>“A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE /FALSE IMPRESSION”
<Content>For all visitors coming to London, Do not book into this Hotel. A very false impression of warm welcome, swish facade, porter to greet you, belies the very basic accommodation this hotel provides. Rooms are tiny,box style, fitted out with open plan wall mounted fitments, no drawers space, and one has to be very careful when walking past this unit due to danger of head injury. Window of approximately 18 inches wide, no daylight as you are facing a concrete section of the building, so can see no skylight. Ventilation poor, noisy from main road traffic and noisy revelers, so no sleep. A three night break left us exhausted. Do people know this was previously the Youth Hostel of London. Now redone up as a glorified hotel or hostel! Cost of over £100 per night, a very expensive hostel. Breakfast for over 700 guests, a nightmare experience, cafeteria with massess of uncleaned tables, took ten minutes before finding a clear table, machines for coffee, juice, milk and queues everywhere for food. Worse I am sure than Butlins Hokiday Camp, or indeed as my brother commented, worse than his experience of the Military Barracks. Bedrooms poorly serviced. Central to theatres and British Museum, but unfortunately this did not compensate for the overall dreadful experience of this hotel. Concierges helpful and polite. Would not reccommend this hotel.

<Title>“For the price in the West End, its a good hotel”
<Content>We (my partner and I) decided that a trip to London was in order. We wanted to stay in the West End and so I stumbled upon this hotel thanks in part to Ryanair. We checked in, no problems. The room was very average but at £100 a night for the two of us, we weren't complaining. The room was clean and quiet and that's all we really cared about. I don't see the point in spending £250 a night when I'd rather spend less on a hotel and go see a couple shows and have dinner! So thats what we did. If you book this hotel, please have realistic expectations otherwise you'll be disappointed. It's lovely, the location is incredible with a Starbucks right around the corner, good restaurants, close to soho, 1 block away from the tube station, I mean, what else do you really want in the heart of London? This place is great for couples or small groups who don't need shiny, new amenities, big T.V,'s or robes and slippers in order to enjoy themselves. We liked it so much we've booked another trip in December for the craic. :)

<Title>“rooms too small, staff unfriendly, noisy, poor breakfast”
<Content>I have stayed in this hotel a few times already. The rooms are small, as in most London hotels but the difference struck me ven more this timee as I moved to a Marriott the next day where my bathrom was about the same size as the St Giles room. Check-in is always a mess. Queue up and wait 20 minutes is just not what customers accept anymore. Unfreidnyl staff, taking the phone andhandling all other matters while they check you in, resulting in an even slower check-in process. A friend of mine spend 20 mintutes waiting to check in and 20 minutes at the check-in desk. Breakfast is horrible. Somebody has thrown blocks of cheese on a plate, one of the guests asked for a fried egg and was told to take boiled eggs instead. The breakfast room has no ambition to be cosy or inspiring, this is just a place you want to get out of as quickly as possible. In the rooms there is a lot of noise from the street. No mini-bar. Staff in the bar downstairs have that dollar look in their eyes. The waitress was very friendly but I overheard some comments from the chef about a couple that had just ordered their diner and they had to pay before they got served, the manager insisted on that. Horrible place.

A special mention to the breakfast staff who were very efficient at clearing tables and re stocking food,crockery etc,although they seemed overworked.We stayed Friday-Sunday and left cases with concierge on Sunday so we could go to Covent Garden,this only cost £1 each.Woken up early due to nearby building work,but nobody goes to London to stay in bed!!A bit noisy outside at night but it is central London,but no noise inside the hotel.Location great about 15min walk to covent garden,tube 2 minute walk,5 minutes to oxford street.We booked a package through superbreak which included tickets for wicked which was fantastic.We also has afternoon tea at Charing Cross Hotel for £19.95 which was lovely.Avoid the hotel bar-extortionate prices!!All in all a great hotel for a short break.If you want somewhere clean to sleep and shower would highly recommend it.

<Title>“Dirty handkerchief in the bed.”
<Content>I have just returned from a 5 day stay in London where I attended a conference. The choice of this hotel was based on location and on some favorable reviews I found in Tripadvisor. But I was very disappointed. Upon arrival I found a dirty handkerchief (see photo) between the bed cover and the sheets. I called the reception and the person in charge came to my room. He apologized a lot but was unable to spontaneously offer a solution. My requests for a bed change or a room change were denied. He said the hotel was overbooked and at that hour (around 10 pm) the housekeeping services were unable to provide clean sheets and the bed change. He offered me a free breakfast for the next morning. I did not accept his offer because it did not address my problem. One last remark, internet access only if you pay. Even in the lobby.

<Title>“Central location but night long police and ambulance sirens.”
<Content>This is a busy hotel in central London. At night the streets are noisy and unfortunately the noise makes it up to highest floors making for a broken nights sleep. Stayed for 6 nights and they were all bad. Rooms are small but functional. Breakfast had a good choice but the cheapest sausages they must be able to buy. Overworked staff seemed permanently fed up.

<Title>“A Basic Hotel with Few Home Comforts”
<Content>When I came to check this hotel out before visiting, the latest review I found was for 2009! In this case, I thought, I would prepare a detailed update. When I come to upload mine, suddenly there are 100’s of reviews, all of which in one way or another agree with what I found. It is a large concrete monstrosity in a very central position. Reception, on arrival, seemed busy but efficient. I asked for a room with a bath rather than a shower and this was provided. On reaching the first floor, I was guided by signs through the smoke (illegal) filled warren of a corridor to a bunker that was to be home for the next three nights. On entering the room I found there was one small 4’ x 2’ approx window which did not give enough light to find any of the switches or lamps despite it still being daylight outside. After struggling to find a lamp and then locate its switch, I managed to find two switches camouflaged on the door jamb, immediately inside the darkened entrance. One illuminated the bathroom and this allowed me to find other room lamps. To this day I did not discover the point of the other switch. Like many hotels, good lighting was a missing luxury. By far the best lit area was the bathroom, which was not that much smaller than the actual bedroom. It contained the promised bath and was ideal for anyone less than four feet tall! The modern trend of not supplying toiletries (allegedly to help save the environment, but actually to cut hotel costs) was abundantly clear. There were two shower caps and both the basin and bath came with soap dispensers. These were designed by a rocket scientist as the liquid soap would fly across the mirror (from the basin) or down the entire length of the bath from the other pot. The trouble was that this was fixed at shower height, so no good at all for those wanting to use the bath. This was most unsatisfactory. Once the lighting in the bedroom had been located and switched on, one waited in hope for a reasonable level of illumination which, sadly, never arrived. I felt pleased that I had not brought a cat to swing now that I could see the room. The cramped room was, or seemed, clean, as did the bathroom. A double bed indicated that the room could be shared by two people. I would challenge this. The room contained no cupboards, mainly, I think, because there would not have been room to open the doors! There were shelves (see photo) and a one foot wide space for hanging clothes, which was actually difficult to reach, even without a door, due to a large (for the room size) 1960’s style chair and its close proximity to the bed! Tea and coffee facilities were provided, as was a sort of air conditioning, (switch found on the second day due to the darkness) and the first floor window could be opened a crack, but is recommended only for deaf people and had to be shut at night if you were to sleep in the reduced, but not eliminated, street noise. The howl of emergency sirens could be heard quite well, even with the window closed. A fan and safe were provided, both of these were good points and there was no extra charge. A small TV is glued to the wall above the shelving, just below ceiling level. This made the only viewing area from the bed. I could not find a radio. The TV came without instructions or lists of channels available. It seemed like Freeview. Many channels suffered from pixel break-up and it took ages to flick though just a few of the channels. The bed was lumpy and basic, but seemed clean. There are IKEA lamps either side of the bed. One had an unreadable PAT certificate, whilst the one on the other side, which was faulty, had no visible certificate at all. The breakfast was quite an experience. We were warned on arrival that it could get busy around 8.30 am. I arrived just after opening time (6.30, good for business people) one morning to find it half full. The cooked choice at breakfast was a poor introduction to those not knowing what a full English breakfast looked like. The room key card actually calls it a ‘European Breakfast’. I reckon that the sausage could have almost passed as vegetarian, it was dire. The rest was passable but it was the same every day, no changes at all, other than ‘take it or leave it’. The bread rolls were of poor quality and there was no bread for toast. Most other items were acceptable. It was self service and this seemed to work well when the place wasn’t too busy. This is a large basic hotel which seems mainly used by busloads of tourists and people up for shows and or short work periods. My stay of three nights was more than enough for me. I noted that some people had booked rooms for a honeymoon. There is probably little hope for that marriage! It is one step up from the very basic hotels that have become popular in recent years, but you pay quite a premium, but if you want somewhere central for a couple of nights in central London it would pass as OK, but don’t use it for a special occasion!

<Content>My friends and I stayed here one night so we could enjoy the musical 'Ghost' at the Picadilly Theatre.It was in a very good location for all of the nightlife and for shoppijng the next day! Staff were friendly and we could leave our luggage with the concierge whilst we visited nearby Oxford Street.The rooms were quite small but very clean and comfortable - all you would need for an overnight stop in the heart of London.

<Title>“Basic but not as bad as Travelodge/Ibis . Location is excellent !”
<Content>On arrival to the hotel I was pleasantly surprised . Lovely reception and easy check in . Room was fine . Clean , decent bed , flat screen tv , small shower room . I normally stay in nicer hotels to be honest but this was more than adequate . The location of the hotel was excellent , very close to the tube station and very central easy walking distance to Covent garden .I would definitely stay here again and recommend the hotel.

<Title>“Good location”
<Content>We went to London to see Much ado about nothing with David Tennant and Catherine Tate, wounderful play by the way, and wanted a hotel close to the theater. The location was good even if there was a lot of roadwork close by. The room was OK for one night, but I would advise you to ask for a room on a high level. We had breakfast included otherwise it wouldn't be worth it! Go out and have breakfast instead.

<Title>“worst hotel i have ever stayed in”
<Content>I arrived at this hotel for my honeymoon having booked a double bed room but to be told i was given a twin room after 15 minutes they finally gave me the smallest dingiest dullest room that they had after going back to reception to complain the room that i booked online was advertised in reception i explained to the receptionist that that was the picture i booked and was told :well you didnt expect to get that one did you: well for your information St Giles yes i did we were finally given another room which was slightly better than the first but still a diappointment. To make matter worst was the hot breakfast buffet what a joke your choice sausage bacon scrambled egg potato rostti and beans I aske could i have fried egg was told no so i asked for some toast where i was rudely told madam i am not hiding anything if its not out here then we dont do it. On our last night stay we were woken up at 3am by some German tourist kicking on our door and shouting what a joke the hotel was if it wasnt 3am i would have gone out and shook his hand but it did take the hotel security over half an hour to remove him, not only am i leaving this reveiw but i will be sending one to the hotel as it was the worst place i have ever stayed in and will never advise anyone to stay here

<Title>“Well placed and well priced”
<Content>I stayed at the St Giles earlier this week and chose it mainly because of its' proximity to the theatre I was visiting that evening. The hotel is about one minute's walk from Tottenham Court Tube station and is really easy to find. The room was quite small, but very clean and well appointed. If you want somewhere to stay in the middle of London and don't want to pay a ridiculous price, then this would be a good place to start. There is a big reception desk, so no queues checking in and out and the staff are really friendly. My only two complaints would be that the pillows are bizarrely small and also that there always seemed to be a huge number of people waiting for the lifts, but these are small points from a picky traveller!

<Title>“Blatant profiteering by management- very disappointing”
<Content>Booked this hotel through booking.com on Monday mistakenly for that night. 3 minutes later (to the second) realized genuine mistake, phoned booking.com who amended the booking to correct day Tuesday the next day, confirmation e-mail, so far so good. Received a phone call from hotel Tuesday stating a no-show for Monday, no reservation for Tuesday. Despite me saying I was in afternoon meeting hotel had zero interest in helping me resolve, appalling customer service, essentially saying my problem, Ill have to fix it. In the end hotel invoked their 24 hour cancellation policy and since was booked and cancelled within 3 minutes for the same day I had to pay for 2 nights. Fully understand policies are there for a reason but seriously no way they can argue that due to my cancellation they could not sell room that night. Really frustrating and customer service was non-existent. If you want decent customer service Id stay somewhere else.

<Title>“Great location, but some things need improving”
<Content>I went to the St Giles as part of a package option, so I'm writing this bearing that in mind. The room itself is nice, clean and, understandably basic given the amount we paid for our trip. However, there was no air conditioning which makes it difficult to sleep in Summer, even with the window open, when the temperature is hitting 24 degrees centigrade and above. The bathroom is nicely laid out, but because there wasn't an extractor fan, the room would mist up when you had a hot shower. The range of breakfast is very much as you'd expect from a City Break hotel with a choice of cereal, Continental breakfast or English breakfast. However, the hotel may wish to loil at who provides their sausages as they are a little bland. All in all, a nice hotel IF you were on a package deal like I was.

<Title>“Good location for exploring London”
<Content>The location of this hotel is it's greatest asset - only a few hundred metres from Tottenham Court Road tube station, you can soon get to most London landmarks in good time. Just by walking for a couple of minutes you can be at the British Museum and Dominion Theatre. Currently the area has a lot of building work and disruption due to the expansion of the tube station (it will soon be linked to the Northern line improving the connection north-south), but by the completion in winter 2011 it should result in a new open space and an improved appearance. I agree with some previous comments on the length of time it can take to get to the upper floors (I was on the 11th), especially when parties book in and put pressure on the four lifts. My room was fine, not as confined as I imagined, although the bathroom was compact. But it was clean, and more than sufficient for a short stay. Breakfast was a straightforward self-service cafeteria style, and I was glad to see the start time of 7am on a Sunday meant I could get out into the city early. Overall a good stay, and combined with a good deal through the internet, I was happy with my choice.

<Title>“Good location - quite OK hotel”
<Content>We've stayed here several times - mainly because of the location. With only about 200 metes from the tube station at Tottenham Court Road, and nearly on Oxford Street and just two blocks away from the British museum, it is a perfect location for shopping and culture. The rooms are quite nice, but the double beds are a bit narrow. The rooms can get a bit stuffy in summer, and the windows don't open very wide - but fortunately they have got a fan in the room, which helps. The safe works, the flat screen TV has a wide range of channels and the coffee/tea making facilities gets you coffee in the morning. The hairdryer is not very good (bring your own) - and the elevator capacity is bad. In the morning you can expect to wait for quite a long time to get down to the lobby. The WIFI-charge is a bit steep with 10 pounds a day.

We went to see We will rock you, at the Dominican theatre, which was just about a hundred yards from the front door of the hotel! Perfect. The travelodge is a little further, but shop around, you will find rooms cheaper, and possibly more spacious. Oh, and the coffee2go option is good!

<Title>“I do not reccomend this hotel!!”
<Content>I went to London on August 26th with my partner and of course we wanted an hotel close enough to the city center, so St Giles seemed a good choice. I regret now not to pay a little bit more but go into a decent hotel! Our room (if it can be called like that....) was on the second floor (nr 268); having two bags we wanted to take the elevator but it was broken or unavailable at that moment, so we took the stairs which were dump, dirty and full of electric cables and garbage! So we arrived at the second floor, we approached the corridor that smelled of garlic/smoke/stale air; as soon as we opened the door of the room a horrible stink of sweating feet assaulted us so we went straight away to open the window which could only opened a tiny bit! The room was a panic room, so small that we couldn't move! The bathroom, tiny as well, but the worst thing was finding hair in the shower! The cleaning crew did not even change the used soap we left on the sink, they didn't throw the garbage away and didn't read the DO NOT DISTURB tag on the door and barged into the room while we were in bed! During the night we woke up because drunken people were shouting in the corridor, knocking on doors and trying to get into the rooms! We called the reception and asked to call upstairs and sort the situation. Nothing! And the next day they didn't even bother to apologize for the troubled night! I think people should deserve better when they pay 120£ pp! I advise people not to book with this hotel!

<Title>“Perfectly Adequate!”
<Content>Before staying here I was a little apprehensive due to the negative comments I'd read about the hotel, size of rooms, cleanliness, breakfast bar etc. However I was very impressed with this hotel - we stayed in a twin room which although quite small, was nothing like the shoebox that some people had led me to believe it was. There was plenty of storage space and hanging space for clothes and it didn't feel cramped or claustrophobic at all. We had a bath and shower in our room which was a bonus as I'd heard that all you got was a shower cubicle. The bathroom was very clean with clean towels and complimentary toiletries. There were a couple of loose tiles in the bathroom but that was a minor thing and didn't detract in any way from our stay. We stayed here for 3 nights and each morning we were down for breakfast before 8am as I'd heard about the problems with space etc. Judging by the amount of people there, they had heard about it too but we had no problems with getting a table. Food was good and staff were friendly and helpful. The only negative thing I'd say about the hotel is about the lifts - there are only 4 serving a 700 room hotel which is clearly not enough. On our checking out day we had to walk down the stairs with our bags from the 6th floor as the lifts took ages to come, and when they did arrive they were full with people going down to breakfast. The beds were excellent, much more comfortable than my own at home! Only problem we had was it was quite hot so we had the windows open all night on the first night and I had problems sleeping due to the noise. This was remedied the 2nd night as we kept the windows closed and used the fan supplied in the room to keep us cool. Overall then, great hotel, great location and great value for money. I would definitely stay here again!

<Title>“Horrendous.”
<Content>Small, pokey room, worn furnishings, uncomfortable bed, basin loose, blocked, taking 5 minutes to drain. Shower so small you could hardly move. We did complain and eventually got a slightly better room. Breakfast facilities extremely bad. Dirty crockery & cutlery. People pushing to find a seat. It was more akin to a badly run holiday camp. Leisure complex not part of hotel so there is a fee for using it. I normally do pretty good when booking hotels online, but got this one badly wrong.

<Title>“If location is your priority, St. Giles is your man!”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel with quite a large group for two nights. The location is excellent: very close to the tube, British Museum, Oxford Street and just a short walking distance from Covent Garden and Trafalgar Square. The rooms themselves are fairly basic and on the small side (particularly the singles) but comfortable, clean and in perfect working order. We found the staff to be efiicient and pleasant and any requirements we had specified regarding food (gluten-free / diabetic etc) had been catered for without having to remind them, as so often happens in other hotels. There are several lifts but trying to get down to the ground floor at breakfast time was a bit of an endeavour (10 min + wait) so something to keep in mind if you're in a tearing hurry to check out. Having looked forward to the full English breakfast, I was a little disappointed to find that they don't either toast or fried eggs, but other than that the food was fine (we ate there in the evening too). Nice bar just off the lobby, perfect for relaxing with a late-night drink. I would definitely stay at the hotel again, most of all because of the freedom it gives you in terms of location.

No air conditioning in rooms, lift did take a long time to get to the 11th floor, sometimes upto 5 mins!! then got stuck in lift, doors jammed on us trying to get out, then wouldn't open for 5 mins. Staff were very helpful, and if there was a problem fixed it straight away. Restaurant food in the evening was beautiful, bed was made everyday, was nice to come back to. Shame the rooms were too small. Ideally situated, not far from Covent Garden, Oxford Street!!

<Title>“Drilling at 9.30am???”
<Content>Me and my sister have just stayed in this hotel for a weekend break. Although the hotel was nice and the location was great we had some sort of work being undertaken in the next room to us!!! Drilling started just before 10am on Sunday morning and just after 9am on Monday. Drilling right into the wall by the beds. Not very nice and no one informed us this would be happening. I realise work needs to happen at some point but surely it could have been sorted a bit later in the day.

<Title>“You get what you pay for ;)”
<Content>An ok hotel with a good location close to shopping, theaters and the all essential tube (Tottenham Court Road's station practically around the corner). A lot of nice restaurants within walking distance. We stayed three nights in a twin room up in the 6th floor. The room wasn't too big but it was clean, though there was some what weird smell probably due to the carpet. No A/C in the room (there was a fan), so had to keep the window open all the time. There was quite a lot of noise from the street and humming from ventilation machines, so ear plugs will come handy if you're a light sleeper. It's big hotel, so if you're in a hurry when leaving, it's best leave enough time for the check out procedures. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. All in all an ok experience and ok value for money. Could stay there again.

<Title>“Great location, Small room!”
<Content>Stayed here for 2 nights on a business trip, the location was fantastic, handy to enjoy Londons attractions, the food was good at breaksfast, simple typical hotel breakfast but good value for money. the bar prices were reasonable, and the check in and out speed and service was quick and efficients. Downside the room if you book a single could be tiny, My colleague a 6ft4 bloke had us laughing about being able to sit on the loo and turn the TV channels over on the other side of the room at the same time. I had a very small single room, shower cubicle tiny and JUST enough room for the bed and furniture......Would stay again but even without family would consider booking a bigger room or making sure the hotel check me into a larger room.

<Title>“Adequate given the location”
<Content>Given the location of this hotel, it is very adequate. The bathroom and showers are tiny, so if you are overweight, it is a bit of a squeeze! There is only one plug, so if it is warm and you need to use the fan that is provided, you can't use the kettle or any other electrical device! The breakfast is fine, but can be very busy at times! It is very well situated, with the tube and restaurants and shops very close by. It is fine if you want somewhere reasonably decent in a central point in London, it is good.

<Title>“IF YOU LIKE THE ROOM THE SIZE OF A JAIL CELL, YOU WILL LOVE THIS.”
<Content>This hotel came with a theater package for Priscilla, Queen of the Desert and was a good price for both. But this hotel is a DUMP. The rooms, with no A/C, are smaller than a jail cell, the bed was lumpy, and the small bathroom had a black tiled shower with no light. Forget it if you dropped the soap!!!! The staff is all Eastern European with an " I don't give a damn" attitude. Breakfast, if you want to call it that, is served in a steam tray/metal table/linoleum floored room with massive mobs of tourists milling about. In the bar you have to pay for drinks each and every time, no running tabs here. Could not wait to leave. Never will darken the doors of the St. Giles again. The good location does not save it. Stay away. ~Rich

<Title>“GOOD PLACE TO STAY”
<Content>I have stayed in many hotel in central London and find this one of the best for value. The reception staff were very pleasant and accommodating, the room, although small, was adequately equipped and very clean. The double bed was comfortable. There was only a shower (no bath) and the bathroom was very small but, there again, adequate. The only problem that I met was the long queues for breakfast on the days which I stayed. I am unable to stand in queues due to a physical condition but I was unable to alter my booking which would have allowed me to eat at nearby cafes. I wrote to the hotel following my visit explaining the problem I had experienced. I was quite surprised by the extremely rapid response by the management who went out of their way to alleviate my concern. Customer service in this respect was admirable and I will certainly stay here again.

<Title>“great location”
<Content>The hotel has 11 floors and is so busy it seems a bit impersonal , but as we only stayed 1 night his was fine with us. There are only 4 lifts so waiting times seem a bit lengthy. Our twin room on 7th floor was small but had everything we needed including a safe and proper hairdryer and was really quiet. We ate out, but restaurants, and bar seemed nice as was the option of 'breakfast to go' from the coffee shop. The location was great as only a short walk from Tottenham Court rd Tube or about 10 mins from Googe st tube. There were also plenty of restaurants within walking distance and didnt take too long to walk back from Regent St area. I think if we visit London again in future we would choose this hotel again as the location is so central

<Title>“Great location, okay hotel”
<Content>Stayed here for a long weekend in August 2011 with a family member. Booked a twin room on recomendation from a family member who has stayed here before. On arrival there was no problems checking in. The room was a little bit of a let down. It was divided up into two separate areas with the beds and tv mounted to the wall in one room and the desk, wardrobe and bathroom in the other. Just didn't seem very usable if you wanted to dry your hair and watch tv at the same time! Also there was two windows that only opened a tiny bit and NO air-conditioning. Not the best for a VERY warm weekend in London. Although there was a fanit would have been very loud to leave on all night. We did not avail of the breakfast or dinner in the hotel, instead opting to head out for it. We used the coffee to go area once for a sandwich which was nice but nothing fancy. We used the bar at nighttime after being out for dinner and a show. It was ok but nothing fancy. Seemed to be busy enough but one thing that Bugged me was when you got your drinks or food you were made pay for them straight away, no option of having a tab to buy several and pay at the end. Just seemed a little rude. Also when they gave you back your change it was on a blue tray which of course must be collected so therefore making you feel like you should be leaving a tip every time.

<Title>“Central Location, okay hotel”
<Content>The hotel is a 15 minute walk from Euston Station. Towards the end of Tottenham Court Road. Check-in was straight foward. We were given to single rooms on either sides of the lifts. My room was 431 which was by the lift but you couldn't hear them. My room I think was a renovated one as it was different layout and style to that of my friends. It was facing Great Russell Street. So i could open the window at night and not be distribed by the traffic nosie outside. The bathroom was small and compact and had a shower curtain for a door, the sink was in the shower and there was no space to put your toiletries. But overall was very clean. The bedroom was an okay it had plenty of space to move around with a leather chair and vanity table, there was a big fan in the room. There was no actualy wardrobe in the room only a space with a few hangers. There was a couple shelf's to put things on. There was tea/coffee making facialties in the room as well as a room safe. My room compared to my friends had plenty of plug sockets while there was only two in the whole of theirs. The rooms were service daily. Breakfast was okay it buffett style with cereal, fruit, cold meats and hot english breakfast. We went down just before or around 8am and could find a seat fine, it was quite quiet at this time. As are train was late in the evening, we kept are luggage in their store room for the day for free. The hotel was oppsite a Sainsbury's, in close walking distance was Tottenham Court Road tube station, Oxford Road, SoHo and Leicester Square.

<Title>“Hectic, but central at a good price”
<Content>There is nothing subtle about the St Giles. A beast of a place towering over Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, you don't stay here for subtle charm or the Olde World English Experience. But for location and comfort at a reasonable price it would be hard to beat it. Rooms are small but well equipped, you'll be amazed everything can be crammed into such a small space. I had a room at the front on the busy road which was fine with the window closed but deafeningly noisy when open, and with no aircon (only a mini portable fan) you kinda need the window open. Breakfast was rather like taking part in a rugby match in an office staff canteen, but the range of full English breakfast should set most peaople up for the day. If you're only in London for a couple of days you don't want to spend any more time than is absolutely necessary on public transport, so stay central, and the St Giles ticks that box. But do ask for a room at the back away from the road!

<Title>“Wouldn't stay here again”
<Content>Excellent hotel for theatres, shops etc. all within walking distance but the room was very small. When we entered the room we got a strong smell of body and foot odour so had to open the window qucik to let in some fresh air. The carpet was very worn and the decoration was very shabby and in dire need of a refurb. We had twin beds and one of them must have been broken as it rocked and made creakling noises if you moved and felt it would collapse at any moment. The extractor fan in the bathroom didn't work so after a shower the room was full of condensation and very hot. There was no air con only a desktop fan and the window was small and only opened halfway so room was very hot. The lifts, although there were a few of them, were very slow, often didn't work and were always full We used their cafe for a quick snack and found the choice of sandwiches to be limited and tasteless. They'd obviously been hanging around a long time as the tomato had made the bread soggy. If you want somewhere just to lay your head for one night whilst you see a show or something then this hotel will probably do but no more than that. It wasn't that cheap either.

We stayed for two nights bed and breakfast, and found the staff very helpful, especially for directions as it had been a long time since we had been in London. This trip was through Superbreak and it included a threatre trip of our choice,we went to see Dreamboats and Petticoats,FANTASTIC SHOW on the Friday evening and Saturday we went to see Jersey Boys. again FANTASTIC SHOW. We can be certain we will return there very soon, as we love the Theatre Shows and this Hotel is so convenient as most are walkable no need for the tube ! The hotel is very clean and could not fault any part of it.

<Content>I booked this hotel for a long week-end stay, May bank holiday. I had booked theatre tickets for my husbands birthday and wanted a central hotel in London. This hotel is on Tottenham Court Rd, it is in a perfect location for almost anywhere you wish to go in London, without using public transport or taxi's, it has restaurants and a coffee lounge, so you don't have to go looking for anywhere to eat if you don't feel up to it, it is just a 2min walk from the tube, really couldn't be better. The only thing I could find fault with, and thats if I wanted to be petty, is the rooms are a wee bit small, but then you only sleep in them, they are clean and well equiped

<Content>If you're looking for very basic accommodation and somewhere to rest your head and wash and shower then this place is perfect... The Hotel is nice and generally clean. Maybe a little dated but nothing that would put you off! The rooms are a tad on the small side, but it has all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. Some of the rooms have had new bathrooms installed so try and request one if possible. Only exec room have AC, although the rooms all have fans in them to help cool down which is well neededin the summer as the building tends to get hot! Location is amazing, literally 2min walk from Tottenham Court Road Underground which will take to all of the sight seeing parts of the city... I would stay at this hotel again but would definately opt for the more expensive option of having an executive room, just for those added creature comforts :-)

<Title>“Location, Location, Location!”
<Content>Stayed for 3 nights in a standard room - which was satisfactory for our needs as were out for the day & only used room for showering & sleeping. We were on the 4th floor so the noise was not an issue. Breakfast not included in our booking and we ate in a nearby restaurant - there is so much to choose from at reasonable prices. Travalgar Square is a 20 minute walk away & Big Ben, Westminister etc... about a 40 minute walk. The National Museum is just a 5 min walk & loads of theatres. The Dominion Theatre which shows We will Rock You musical is literally beside the hotel! Highly recommend going to see if you can get reasonable tickets - £25 each we got seats for!

<Content>Ive been working in London as a guide and knows a lot of the hotesl around this town. My first choice everytime I go back with friends visisting, will always be St. Giles. And that is because of the excellent location. From the hotel you can walk to almost anything; covent Garden (one of my favourites with narrow interesting streets on the way), trafalgar Sq., Soho, Leicester Sq. Bloomsbury, etc, etc. And you are just a couple of minutes away from Oxford Street, where the buses passes by along this treet all the time, so its very easy to get around without the use of the underground.

<Content>We stayed here just for the one night with my in-laws so we could go to a London musical and it was all fine for that. The hotel is very conveniently located, right in the middle of everything in central London, and we spent a great day roaming around the city, visiting museums and having lunch out. We were able to walk from the hotel to the theatre, enjoy the performance and walk home again with ease. The rooms were small but comfortable, and the beds were fine. Breakfast in the moring was buffet style and extensive, and it was very tasty! The bathroom was pretty poky though and the hot water seemed to be stuck on a single setting - either v hot or off. Also being in central London there was noise from traffic through the night but that is only to be expected. Overall, for a visit to London for business or a quick tourist trip, I would say this hotel is ideal.

The staff were rude and unhelpful and glad I am not staying there. If that's what they are like before you get to the hotel god knows what they would be like in the place.... Derek W near York

Most of the time it's quiet at night. I have never had the breakfast, I always grab something on my way out. The location in the very centre makes it possible to walk to many of the interesting places in 10-20 minutes. The room rate is great for London.

<Title>“Clean, functional and well located”
<Content>Most of the other reviews cover my comments: the location is great, the price is reasonable for London and you are able to get some good deals through Hotels.com and Expedia. The rooms and public areas were very clean. There are four lifts, but during the morning peaks there were more guests using the concrete stairs as the lifts were very slow. We had four rooms in total for a Saturday night on the fourth floor and there was no air conditioning in any of them. The slender corridors were very hot and the rooms required the window to be open - which inevitably brought the London noise in to your room. There were fans in all the rooms so they do try to help with the problem. We had one single room on the front of the hotel and I will just say it was 'compact' - but sorry I have to put 'tiny' for the bathroom. Breakfast was OK. It was busy (09:00 on a Sunday morning) and laid out like a school canteen. It was a buffet style on a hot plate so you could have a hearty portion but there was a lack of variety compared to other hotels and the addition of pastries would have improved it for me. Staff were not super helpful, but they were busy, but a smile now and again would help. Would I stay again? probably for one night because of price, cleanliness and location - likely to go elsewhere for breakfast though.

Casino entrance from reception area, and fitness center (not used this time and availible for a fee). Rooms are OK, little small as was the bathroom, but we were not in London to stay in our room :-)

<Title>“Great choice-recommended”
<Content>I spent two nights at this hotel on business. The room was comfortable, spacious, had every amenity necessary for a nice stay - the room was not lavish by any means, but very tasteful and modern. A tea kettle, coffee, tea and biscuits were also offered. I was on a high floor and did not have any problems with street noise. I was able to crack the window to get some fresh air ( nice as in some modern hotels the windows are sealed shut). If I had to complain I would only say that the bathroom sink was quite small and awkward to use. I did not have the hotel breakfast- so unable to comment on that. The location is extremely convenient - just a few minutes walk from Tottenham Court Rd tube station, and Oxford street. The hotel has pool and gym facilities -but I did not try them either. Would recommend.

<Content>I stay quite frequently at this hotel for one reason only; location. It is hard to fault the central london location, handy for shopping, shows & many attractions are walkable. Breakfasts are good & food plentiful, however, if you want to eat before 9.30a.m. be prepared to wait for a table & use your elbows at the buffet stations. It is packed! A post 9.30a.m. breakfast visit recommended. My principal complaints here are that the rooms are terribly cramped, walkways are narrow & staff are pretty much universally disinterested in their guests. Be that as it may, balancing negatives with price & location, I would certainly recommend this place

<Title>“Mama Mia! love being here!”
<Content>I went with my friend on our second visit to the St. Giles hotel, london. I can say it was as good as the first time we went. It was my friends birthday and we went to see a show, Mama Mia. Because it was my friend's birthday I wanted to make it special for her, so I got in touch with the staff at St. Giles and explained to them and asked if there could be some flowers for her in the room when we got there. We communicated by email. They were brilliant, and asked me what I wanted, gave me a price list and asked what colours. And sure enough there in the room were these beautiful flowers waiting for her with a card in a nice big vase. The staff are so lovely there, so helpful. The rooms are spotless, the beds are very comfortable, and no matter where you walked around the hotel there is not a speck of dust or rubbish anywhere. It's in a great location, with a 24 hour sainsbury across the road, a boots chemist too. Round the corner is a cafe rouge, Garfunkels which are both great to have a meal in. Staff lovely there too, couldn't do enough for you. If you go on line on 2 for 1 you can download vouchers which is great to have a saving, especially if there are a lot of you. We booked the show through last minute. com and they are very good too, so easy to use and instantly your seats are booked. We had brilliant seats and a brilliant price. I think if you are stopping in London for a few days, the St. Giles is the best place to go, its great for value for money, it's central so oxford street is just around the corner and all the shop to drop is there. I hope this helps you decide where to stop. We would stop there again hopefully next year.

<Content>we got this hotel as part of a package when we went to see Take That. great position a few steps from the undergroud and it looks good as you enter. the greeting we recieved was less than ordinary though. there were lots of staff but they seemed disinterested and the young lady who served us was surly and aloof. we had to change room because the first one had a terrible feel to it. the breakfast staff were lovely and attentive and the food was good.

<Title>“Great Location, not so good on the inside, still great value though”
<Content>I stopped here for two nights whilst visiting London. Located a 15 minute walk from Euston Station and sixty seconds away from Oxford street/Tottenham Court, it is in a very good location for seeing most of London's sights. The room was a double, but on the small side, big enough for a bed and a small walkway down each side. It was summer and blazing hot, but there was no air con in the rooms, and my biggest gripe was that the room smelled very musty. The bathroom was ok, but there was no toilet brush and the toilet bowl was dirty from previous guests, the shower worked fine however and the shower curtain seemed brand new. Wi-Fi was availble in the rooms at a cost of around £5 a day, I am 22 years old and have lived most my life with internet and hundreds of free wifi spots, so this seemed extortionate to me, i was very dissapointed. The hallways were quite cramped and during roomservice times you'd struggle to get past the carts, even sideways. They did do a thorough job of replacing all the sheets and towels however. We only used the hotel as a base to explore London, so we didnt spend a lot of time there, the only interaction we had with the staff was check in (We got stuck with a trainee, a little slow but very polite- we all have to start somewhere) and check out. where a helpful gentlemen walked to the next street to hail us a taxi. Overall I would say the hotel was great value for its location, not the nicest I have stopped in, but you get what you pay for and at £115 a night smack bang in the middle of everything, I was pretty happy with my overall stay.

<Title>“small, old and dirty”
<Content>I had one of my worst experience at this hotel. Extremely small room together with old furniture made my vacation a total mess. No air condition. The safety box was damaged, the ice machine from lobby doesn't work. A lot of tight corridors and doors between us and our room...look like a fire escape instead of hotel

<Title>“great location, good value”
<Content>You don't find luxury here, but St. Giles Hotel offers good value for money and is a very decent place even when compared to double or triple priced alternatives. Location is excellent. Service was good. We used the luggage room on the day checked out, it's a lot cheaper than leaving luggage to a railway station. Rooms were clean and faucets, showers etc. worked fine. We had two twin rooms, the other was small and the other ok. I'll may well stay here again and next time I'll know to ask for a bigger room at check-in. Weather was cool during our stay, but if it is hot, then you are out of luck, since there is no air conditioning. There are plenty of cafes nearby for breakfast, so we did not go to hotel breakfast. There was a rush hour in the morning at the elevators, but that was not too bad and not a problem for us.

<Title>“No sleep!”
<Content>I think I would have slept better on a bed of nails located in the middle of the M25! My room was tiny, sheets and bathroom had someone elses hair still on it. My room was right next to a corridor and the tiled floor meant I could hear footsteps all night. Also the windows let all the noise in and I think I got about 2 hours sleep. Wont be going back.

<Title>“what do people want”
<Content>Just returned from a 2 night stay in this hotel and after reading recent reviews was getting very worried, but I shouldnt have been. It fit the bill for a short stay in the centra of London. What else do you need great location, clean room, plenty big enough to shower, change and sleep, comfy beds and we found staff friendly. Good selection at breakfast. Like I said ' what do people want' would stay there again when next planning a short stay in London.

<Title>“Great location, small tired rooms”
<Content>In brief, lovely greeting from front of house. We arrived before 9am but they found us a room which was a bonus. Location was brilliant, 50m from Dominion Theatre and Tottenham Court tube station. Sainsburys, boots, burger king, cafe rouge all within 2 minutes walk. Rooms very small, bathroom minute, tiny shower tray with only curtain so wet floors regularly!! Breakfast was included in our trip but optional purchase for £8 seemed pretty reasonable for London. Finally, if you go there, listen out for that really naff lift music...

<Title>“Basic clean hotel in a great location”
<Content>We stayed here for 3 nights in July 2011 and got what we felt was a good price. It worked out cheaper than Travelodge and Premier Inns so we thought we'd give it a go. (Less than £300 for 3 nights over a weekend). We knew we'd be out most of the time, so would literally just be sleeping and showering in there so all we needed was somewhere cheap, clean and comfortable in a central location. The St Giles achieved all of these things. It is a basic room and is pretty small with not much of a window but I will say it's very well designed so all the space is used well! The bathroom was nice for the price too. It's definitely a step up from a Travelodge/Premier Inn if that's the kind of price you're wanting to pay. The lobby is fairly average and the halls are a bit like an office building but you spend a few minutes each day using these areas so who cares! Service was fine - not overly friendly, not rude! We didn't have breakfast but our friends have before and queued 20 minutes and were less than impressed so I'd give it a miss unless it's free or virtually free! There's a Sainsbury's two minutes from the door we just went and grabbed something from there. There's also a Starbucks & Cafe Nero less than 5 minutes away. The hotel is just off Tottenham Court Road so is in a perfect position for seeing all the sights. The tube station is within a couple of minutes and Oxford St & Soho are less than 5 minutes walk away. I sometimes worry what the area will be like at night but this was fine, we came back at around 1am some nights and there were always cars and people around. Would definitely recommend for anyone on a tight budget looking for somewhere in central London that's clean and comfortable.

<Content>Hotel very nice, centrally situated 2 mins off Oxford St and the Dominion Theatre, Tottenham Court Rd tube also 2 mins away, easy walking distance to Covent Garden, Soho, and other sights too! The staff are very friendly and helpful, left out bags because room wasnt ready and also when we checked out as were staying the day in london, small concierge charge of £1 per bag. Breakfast is buffet style so eat as much as you can! All in all a top wknd away and will definately be back!

<Title>“Good value for money, central location”
<Content>Located just off Tottenham Court Road- so great if you are planning a shopping or theatre break. Check in was very slow, the receptionist's took forever & after waiting around 15-20 mins (at the desk!) we discovered they had only checked us in one room out of two! Apart from this mishap, the rooms were clean and comfortable. Tea & coffee facilities were available. There was no natural light in the room which I didn't like & There was quite a bit of noise- but I suppose this is to be expected in a city centre hotel. Overall, for an overnight stay I would recommend this hotel based on it's location & cleanliness. We would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Not Great!!”
<Content>Although the hotel was extremley easy to find just two streets away from Tottenham Court Road tube station it wasnt great! From the outside the hotel looks good and the facilities all stack up well but once inside it a whole different ball game! The reception staff were far from friendly not even breaking a smile, not a great welcome! we were however able to check into our room early of which was a bonus as we were attending a function and needed to freshen up and change. Our room was a twin as i was travelling with my sister, it was extremley small and had the tiniest window with no curtains, no bath just a shower cubicle, it actually reminded me of a travel lodge room, very basic and pokey! The breakfast was a Coffee to Go, this was a piece of fruit, a hot drink and a bacon or chesse roll of which the roll was hard and stale! The only good point for us was the location as it was within easy reach of our destination and easy to get back to Euston on the tube, we could also walk into Covent garden within 10minutes. i dont think i would stay again as i am sure there are plenty of other hotels that perhaps reach a better standard than this one!

<Title>“Robbery. No curtains, tiny rooms, noisy”
<Content>Other reviews rate this hotel highly because of it's location. It's in a horrible cheap part of London centred around discount stores and takeaways. Yes it's ok for theatres etc and tubes but you can stay in covent garden RIGHT IN THEATRE LAND for almost the same price. The cells, sorry rooms, are very very small. The window was about 2ft wide with no curtains so in July the morning sun wakes you around 4 am just before the 5am delivery trucks start. The weather wasnt warm for the time of year but the rooms were very very hot so staying in a hot spell would be grim. There is noise throughout the hotel you have road noise from tottenham ct road which is busy all night or the Clunk of lifts and extractor fans if you stay at the rear of the block. The whole feel of the hotel is budget and you can see they have tried to save pennies everywhere. Beds are tiny I'm 5'8-9 and my feet were hanging over the bed. The mattress was thinner than the pillows! If you can get this hotel as part of a theatre package in the winter it might be worth a go but for a 1 night stay it's worth spending another £10-20 and get a really good hotel. I stay fairly regularly in london and this was the worst hotel I've stayed in for years.

<Title>“Average hotel but great location”
<Content>Stayed here with family for a 2 night stay. Rooms are very average but probably on a par with most London hotels in this price range. We had a very small double room which was extremely hot during the day and night, no air con but they did provide a small desk fan. You can open the windows to a certain degree however its far too noisy at night and you wouldnt be able to sleep. I wouldnt say it was the cleanest hotel the rooms were slightly grubby and in need of updating however the bedding and towels were very clean indeed. Only other criticism is the lifts !! they are a nightmare. There were 4 very small lifts and we were on the 3rd floor. Unfortunately you will have a very long wait to come down from your room as they are always full up by the time they have been to the upper floors and on the day we checked out we waited 10 minutes and ended up taking the stairs with our luggage Overall an average hotel however the location is superb being close to Oxford Street and within walking distance of most of the other attractions. Would definately stay again but would request a room on a higher floor due to the lift situation and probably pay a bit extra for a more up to date room !

<Content>Great London hotel - smallish rooms but very clean and well equipped for that short stay in the city. The best thing is the amazing location - just minutes away from the underground, Oxford Street, Covent Garden, theatres etc - all easy walking distance - would highly recommend for that reason alone and will definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Very nice hotel - central location”
<Content>We stayed at the St. Giles hotel for one week and enjoyed it very much. It is a large hotel with 700 rooms. The bedroom was small when comparing it to American or Canadian, but it was quite adequate for our purposes. The bedlinens were snowy white and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was quite modern with black marble tiles and the water pressure in the shower was excellent. The hotel was very clean. Breakfast was provided every morning and although it was listed as a continental breakfast it was actually a full buffet breakfast serving eggs, bacon, sausages, beans and potatoe pancakes. There was also fresh fruit, rolls, cheese, ham, yogurt, sliced peaches, many kinds of cereals and a vast array of juices and hot beverages. What more could one ask for? There are several restaurants on the premises and we were particularly pleased with the one called Il Grasso which served delicious Italian food and wines. We made a point of congratulating the chef. Not only was the food excellent but the prices were very reasonable. There are also several pubs very nearby which also served good "pub food" again at very reasonable prices. Since we wished to use the "tube", we were very glad that the subway station was just around the corner. We purchased am Oyster card which made our travels very economical. At times the subway cars were very crowded, but that is all part of the fun of being in a new place. Be prepared for a lot of stairs as not all the stations have escalators. Also remember to swipe your card again as you are leaving the station. The hotel had concierges who were extremely kind and polite and who could make arrangements for you or give you advice on various tourist attractions. One small criticism...we had asked for a wake-up call on the morning we were to leave. We did not receive that call. Fortunately, my husband had his alarm clock with him as a backup. One other criticsm... there was access to the internet, but it was VERY EXPENSIVE. All in all, we were very pleased with the St. Giles hotel and would return again.

<Content>The rooms here are very very small. We were told we'd been upgraded and we did have a bedroom plus a small lounge but both together were smaller than an average hotel room. However this should not put you off if you're looking for somewhere clean and central. It was certainly worth the money and was perfectly situated, just behind the Dominion Theatre with good access to the Covent Garden area and Oxford St shopping areas as well as transport links. We did not take breakfast so I can't comment. Staff seemed friendly enough. The only thing I would say that's negative is that there were some comments overheard about lack of security in the rooms.

<Title>“Very Good, Clean, room very small”
<Content>Stayed here on a recent trip to the theatre - a treat from the family for our birthday. Had a twin room in the newly refurbished 'East Tower' - it really was the smallest twin room I have stayed in, but it was on the quiet side of the hotel so slept very well. The staff were very friendly and the choice of restaurants was very good offering a 2 course meal (Italian) with a glass of wine, a beer or a soft drink for just £12.50. Breakfast was included and there was plenty of choice - cereals; continental; meats; cheeses; full english - pretty much everything. Very good value for a central london hotel being a short walk to main shops in Oxford and Regent Streets and of course the theatres. Perfect for us.

<Title>“Great Location, Great Hotel”
<Content>Been reading reviews for a while about this Hotel as I had it booked for my wife's 30th so kept checking in. I had understood from the reviews that the rooms were small so I took a punt and decided to upgrade to the Executive Double Room. Firstly, I would definately recommend this option. We had a separate living area with table, a huge bathroom with LCD TV panel in the wall with Bath and Shower. The room was clean and looked out towards the BT Tower (not the most exciting view but couldn't complain) and we had bath robes and slippers included with an LCD panel TV next to the seatiing area in the bedroom. In addition to this we had a note on our bed explaining that as an Executive Room occupant we got to eat in the Executive Breakfast lounge (which is just the Hakuba restaurant underneath the hotel) but this is a cooked to order breakfast with service and it was a great add on which we never expected. Next the Location: simply couldn't ask for better. The other reviews will concur this too. A few steps to Tottenham Court Road tube station, 5 minutes walk to Covent garden and Jamies Italian restaurant which I highly reccommend, 1 minute walk to the Dominion Theatre where we seen We Will Rock You, 5 minutes walk to Oxford Street, all in all, cracking location for those wanting to get out an about on your feet! After a night on the town you can go back to the Lazy Dog bar downstairs which is open until 2am and you don't even have to get out your seat to get a beer as the waitress will spot your down to your last sip and come over to offer you a new one! Hope the review helps anyone thinking about staying here.

<Title>“Great Location but Poor Hotel”
<Content>Only stayed it this hotel for two nights and have to say the location was perfect!.. In the middle of Theatreland and some fantastic eateries BUT the hotel was of a poor standard for a city centre London Hotel... On checking inn the staff were friendly and helpfull but the room was the smallest room i have ever stayed in. The bed was lop sided and the matress was in dier need of replaceing. The carpets were threadbare and the furniture was old and badly marked in places. The bathroom was the size of a telephone box and was old and poorly fitted and the grout round the sink and shower needed replaceing. The television only worked on certain channels and when it did it only worked for a few minutes before the picture broke up and it became unwatchable. The price included a cooked breakfast which cold and was dry. The coffee was fantastic and that came out of a machine. They have a speedy check out which we took advantage of as i could not wait to leave this disappointing hotel.... Word to this hotel... Re-invest some of the profits!!!

<Title>“Top Location to Theatres, Shops, Restaurants”
<Content>My wife & I had a 3 nights stay at St Giles which in our opinion was ideal. If your reason for being in London is to visit the West End, for shopping along Oxford St and the surrounding streets and indulging in food and visits to the numerous attractions, you can't go past St Giles. The room on the 8th floor was comfortable although it could do with some renovation/upgrade to improve the presentation. Ask for a higher floor room, if available, as this will reduce and/or eliminate any noises coming up from the street level, given that this is a busy strip around St Giles. The teams at the front desk and concierge were ever so helpful (as you would expect). We had a problem with accessing our room with the keycard and a front desk staff attended to us right away when told of the matter. No waiting and this is important when one had just checked in and trying to unload the luggage. One downside at the hotel is the small lifts in place and during the peak periods in the morning, any guests on the lower floors tend to wait for a relatively long time to get into a lift to the lobby. Unless one is keen and fit, one may resort to using the stairs which we did on two occasions. St Giles is ideally located with easy walking distance to Tottenham Court station, short walk to the open top city discovery bus route (blue line) and steady stream of cabs outside the hotel.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>I booked this hotel for an overnight before a conference. I was wary about booking it, but it wasn't expensive and located just 10 minutes walk from the conference venue. The room itself was very small, but adequate for a single person - but I don't think it was a single room. Check-in took a bit of time, and was late in the evening, so I was tired. However, there was an excellent menu available in the bar, so I didn't have to go wandering the streets of London for food. I didn't avail of breakfast, because I knew there was coffee at the conference check-in. I would recommend this hotel for it's central location. The staff were helpful. The room was clean and the shower was good. I didn't spend a lot of time there.

<Title>“makes travels lodges seem spacious & luxurious!”
<Content>As a group of colleagues visiting London for an evening function we were a little concerned being booked into an independant hotel. We had low expectations, and I had upgraded to a deluxe room as with my partner. Very unnecessay channeling of guests through airport queuing system at desk. whole entrance totally inappropriate for wheel chairs witnessed twice in 24 hours. Our bedroom was 6' wide, hardly move around the bed, the shower room was tiny, the towels small and rough. There was a mildewy damp smell. our opinions were echoed by all. Those who had breakfast said it was like a noisy school canteen. Really nothing positive to say at all.

<Title>“I hate it and hope I'll never be back”
<Content>The suggested title for a review is "we loved it and we'll be back" ... now take a second look at the actual title. Lets start with the positives. I was staying here on business so the main priorities is work through the day, then social on an evening. This hotel was within walking distance of the office, and it is also within walking distance of Oxford Street and other touristy areas. Now for the not so positives. First impressions are lasting ones, the foyer was dirty and the reception staff were rude, undertrained and unwelcoming. The breakfast room is set out like a school canteen, often with dirty plates / stains left on the tables. The breakfast itself costs £7 and is basic. The majority of mornings I have eaten the cereal as it comes pre packaged and looks like the only edible option. There is fruit available, if it is fresh is rather questionable. There is also a full english option available too. The hotel does have a swimming pool and gym facilities however there is a £5 surcharge, which is rather steep for the facilities available. The rooms them selves are small, dated, hotel and either smell of smoke or dust. The rooms do not have air con but you are provided with a fan. To cool your room you can open a window, but as the hotel is on the corner of oxford street and totenham court road the noise from the streets are 24-7 so is unadvisable. The bathrooms are small and as per the rest of the hotel could do with a lot of TLC. Personally I was pleased there was a small group of us to dine with on an evening, as I would not have felt safe walking to restaurants or near by areas on my own on an evening.

<Title>“O.K.”
<Content>The location of this hotel is excellent for visiting the West End and Soho. Our room was a standard twin, which was small, but ok for a 1 or 2 night stay. We appreciated the fan provided in the wardrobe as the window only opened a few inches. Breakfast was reasonable value and better than we expected. We had no wait but can imagine that weekends could be quite hectic. We found the concierge very helpful. Would we stay in this hotel again? Yes for an overnight stay, but not for longer.

<Title>“A total dump - awaful rooms, cramped, noisy - like a prison”
<Content>I was disgusted by this hotel. I stay in a lot of hotels for work and although I would like perfection have learnt that most hotels have their faults. Well this hotel only has faults. It is expensive for what it offers - because it ought to pay you to stay there! The rooms are a DISGRACE. They are cramped, falling apart, with mouldy bathrooms and horrible worn out furnishings. The windows are awful and believe it or not I had an upgraded room! Having seen the feedback on tripadvisor I had asked my company to get me a larger room so they sent confirmation that I would have the superior room! I was supposed to be in the room with my husband and we wanted room to keep our bags and do work! There was no room just for me! And the extra space was a horrible horrible annexe leading to the bathroom - a bit like a junk room space. And the bathroom - I will post photos but it was mouldy and tiny. The room was noisy - you could hear everything in the corridors and the clientele was noisy and didn't care about talking at three in the morning. But then why would anyone have any respect in such a horrible hotel. The corridors seriously look like a the back corridors of a hotel not the public areas. A friend I was meeting, a Londoner, said that he was suprised I had been put there because it had been a YMCA - believe me - it still is! You can do better than this in London. Don't stay here. I was woken in the night by the noise, burst into tears and had a mini-existential crisis - it was that depressing to be in this hotel and frankly rather scary. There is NOTHING to recommend in this hotel at all. I didn't even stay for breakfast - but shook the dust of it from my heels and had wonderful porridige in the charming Quakers Meeting House where I had my meeting.

<Title>“Couldn't fault this hotel at all...”
<Content>I know writing a review 10 months later isn't too helpful as a lot could change, but i thought it may help some people looking to book this hotel for this summer like i did last year. Where to start... firstly, the location! It is a superb spot, less than 5 minutes walk from the tube station Tottenham Court Road and literally 5 minutes from Oxford Street (perfect if you're into shopping... like my girlfriend!) We arrived at the hotel around an hour earlier than the check in time, however they said we could still check in as our room was ready. We booked an executive double room on the top floor, bathroom was amazing, room was very nicely decorated and finished, maybe a little on the small side. But to be honest, you're not going to find a massive hotel room in London unless you're prepared to pay over the odds. We literally only spent half an hour in the room before we went out and then an hour getting ready before our meal. We ate at the chinese restaurant located on sight. The food was TO DIE FOR!! It was absolutely gorgeous!! After a long day of walking, eating a chinese with a nice cold cider was the perfect end to a wonderful day! The staff were very friendly and helpful, we did not need to complain or bring something to their attention as everything was just as we needed. The concierge was quite happy to look after our bags for a fair few hours the next day because we had to leave by 12 and our train wasnt until 6.30... something that was very helpful: didnt quite fancy dragging my clothes around on a boiling hot day walking the whole length of regent street and oxford street (both walking distance from the hotel) I honestly would recommend this hotel to anyone! The facilities are very nice, the hotel is in a great location, and for the price... its a pretty good deal. One word of advice is i would recommend getting an executive room as the room wasn't the biggest, so i could only imagine what a normal double size room would be like!

<Title>“Really disappointed”
<Content>I booked this hotel to stay overnight with my daughter. I booked a twin room costing £101 for the night on a special promotional rate. All started well with an excellent greeting at the door and easy early book in. All went downhill from there. We were apparently in a superior twin room but if this was the case I dread to think what the standard room is like. It also smelt like someone had been smoking in there before us - or maybe it used to be a smoking room. Either way - our clothes smelt like we were smokers. On the afternoon I decided to use the pool only to be told that there would be a charge of £5 each for the privilege and had to use our room towell. It was a lanes swimming pool which was hardly any good for my 7 year old who wanted a bit of a splash around. Total waste of money. Our deal included breakfast but we were told it did not when signing in on our departure day - we insisted that this was not the case and were allowed to go through only for someone to come and find us and tell us it wasn't included while we were 'enjoying' breakfast - how embarrassing! And all this only to have it confirmed at reception on departure that we our breakfast was indeed included. Overall a great disappointment and for what we got this was overpriced.

<Title>“Dont do it!”
<Content>I like the 2 reviews below was made to stay at this dump while on a training trip with work. My room was small, hot, dirty and smelly!!! The shower was a hole in the wall with very little room to move around in. The breakfast was nothing to write home about! They dont even do toast! What kind of hotel does not serve toast??? and all the cups are dirty, The coffee is cold even though it came straight from the earn! My door didn't lock, the window bearly opened, the walls were so thin you coudl hear the people next door, above and below. Reception staff were very undertrained and ignorant, The bar was overpriced and nearly as dirty as the rooms. I would advise anyone planning on staying here to change their mind and pay a little extra to enjoy their stay. The very sad thing is work have booked us up again here for sheer entertainment (i'm sure)

<Title>“The spearmint rhino hotel”
<Content>I would advise anyone booked to stay here to seriously re-think their options. Dont be fooled by the price, you are not getting 3 star quality not even 2 star quality. Pay a little bit more and get a hotel that is safe and clean. I was forced to stay here on a business trip and it wasnt a pleasant experience. To sum it up... the rooms are dirty, small, hot and very noisy. The window opens a measly couple of inch so dont expect any fresh air. The walls are like paper you can hear everything. They dont even have constant hot water. Breakfast is like a school canteen its a fight for a seat. The croissants are like rocks, the orange juice is powdered, the only good thing is the kelloggs cereal (something sealed you can trust). The area is pretty dodgey, quite a few suspicious characters and "working" girls hanging around. The staff dont listen and dont care so dont even bother complaning they wont do anything. You would be better of saving your money and camping out in regents park. You have been warned!

<Title>“Not a Happy Camper”
<Content>For those of you who would like to opt for the prison experience then St. Giles Penitentiary is the place for you. St. Giles features welcoming stone beds, a filthy bathroom (if you're lucky enough to get a bathroom), and a pleasant ambiance of drunks, traffic noise and crime, but don't worry there is a big enough window to jump out and land on the construction site below. I just hope my luggage is stil there when I get back from work.

<Title>“Good hotel, nice location”
<Content>I travelled to London on business for a week in August last year and stayed at the St. Giles Hotel in central zone of the city. I may say that the location is perfect, as the hotel is set near Oxford Street, Charring Cross Road and the Tottenham Court Road and underground station. The reception zone is nice and all the people working there were very polite and helpful to me. I was accommodated in a nice double room on a lower floor, which I found rather small in size but very clean and I was not waiting for the elevators. I was happy to find out that I had a view towards the London Eye, which was a bonus. My room came with breakfast, which was tasty and I had a good choice of dishes and fruits. Sometimes at evening I had a drink at the hotel bar, where I met some other travellers from all over the world, mainly people on business, but also leisure time travellers and families also. I was disappointed I had to pay for the internet used. In most of the hotels I have been to this service is free of charge. On the other hand, the price for the room was very reasonable providing that you are in the center of London, near the main shopping street and close to the business district as well. All in all, I can say this is a good hotel and the price is right.

<Title>“Perfect Location!”
<Content>I booked this hotel as an optional extra as part of a theatre break package before looking at reviews on here, and I was quite worried when I saw what was written. I shouldn't have been. Being my first time in London I was worried that it would be difficult to find, would be miles from any of the sites, would be horrendously small and noisy. Although it was small, and our room was a tad noisy (being located above the hotels extractor fans, and it was so hot we had to leave the windows open), it became just a base and somewhere to fall asleep. It was within walking distance of many major sites, and we managed to cover Madame Tussaud's, Buckingham Palace, London Eye, Aldwych Theatre all in one day without the need for tube travel! The hotel was very easy to find (just a short walk from both Tottenham Court Road and Goodge Street tube stops) and had a coffee shop, bar and restaurant on site - the 2 former of which were good for purpose, but after dining in the breakfast room on a morning we decided to skip it for an italian meal later in the evening as it had quite a cafeteria feel! All in all, it was a fantastic hotel for location, although the rooms themselves (and the dated decor within) let it down a little bit. I would still recommend it as a base for people wanting to see the sites, after all how much time are you really going to be spending in your room in the capital?!

<Title>“Location, Location, Location, well done St Giles.”
<Content>Looking through the reams of reviews for central London Hotels, we finally decided on St Giles because of its location for Theatre Land and proximity to the nearby Tottenham Court Road Tube Station. Whilst it was a tad more than I wanted to pay I was also conscious of the numerous 'small box rooms' being bandied about by other reviewers and as a guide per square metre was given for each room at this hotel I knew what size to expect. Let's say we were not disappointed! Even better, on arrival we were upgraded from a deluxe double to an executive double at no extra cost and another lovely twist, free breakfast thrown in as well. Ok, so now we were really happy. But what was it like realistically? The room was a good size, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was a really decent size (which for my frame is always a plus) and it WAS CLEAN! Evening meal was spot on being as cheaply priced as anywhere else we had checked out through the day and breakfast consisting of everything from cereals to continental to full English was as good as anywhere else we had visited, which included continentals in various areas of Europe and the especially good one in Venice. The staff were ALL extremely friendly and helpful and the facility of being able to leave our luggage on day of checkout (at no charge) for collection after we had spent a day visiting the sites was a further bonus. Well done to ALL at St Giles. You made our short break a great success. Thankyou - and yes we'll definately be back. R&J

<Title>“Great location.”
<Content>The best thing about the hotel for us was the location - more or less central to all the London sites worth seeing. Given the location, the cost was value for money. Initially we were located in a room opposite some construction work, the noise from which was unpleasant. We complained to management and were immediately transferred to another room and even upgraded. The upgrade meant we were entitled to breakfast in the restaurant rather than the buffet breakfasts where you serve yourself. The service at breakfast was excellent. The room was always tidied up and spacious for two especially after Europe accommodation.

<Title>“Location is great”
<Content>We stayed here last weekend just for one night on a hen weekend, we went to see mama mia and its about a 20 min walk to the theatre from the hotel. And 2 mins walk to Oxford Street We had triple rooms a double bed and single, and there was enough room for 3 adults. lots of tea and coffee to make up. There was a fan in the room but still had to have window open as it was so warm, which meant it was very noisy so did not get much sleep. Breakfast was good there was queues but one of us got a table while the others queued up, it was eat as much as you want. The only down side was the lifts, only 4 for a very big hotel and i think while we were there one was out of order. Coming down to check out on sunday morning we had wait 20 mins for a lift! But i would stay again as the location is so central and the price was very good we paid £140 for a triple room and that included breakfast.

<Title>“WASTE OF MONEY - Worst suite ever”
<Content>Stayed here on Thursday 12 May 2011 in a suite on the 8th floor. The suite was more like a shoe box. You could only just walk around the bed without banging your feet. I stayed with a business partner and we were both very disappointed. Paid £185 for one night excluding breakfast. When we complained to the reception all they said was 'that was the type of room you have booked' (IT WAS A SUITE, NOT A SHOE BOX) The reception staff made no attempt to move or remedy the situation. And, the hotel has a casino next to reception, but you are not allowed in if you don't have your passport or photo driving licence. Not much good if you traveled from Sheffield by train. Rude staff, poor hotel, avoid at all costs.

<Title>“Location!”
<Content>Location is what makes this hotel. Could use an update for the interior since it appears they last had one in the 1970's. Also, if you stay in the summer please note that air conditioning means opening the window (only 6 inches) and using a fan! The rooms are small; but since I don't spend any time in the room except to sleep it was fine. No real closet space but I pack light. If you are an early to bed person please note that you are in a busy nightlife area. Fortunately it rained on Friday night (I was to leave Sat) so I got a good nights rest. Shower is good; sink has the old fashion separate hot and cold faucet. Did not eat breakfast so can not comment on the food. There are plenty of good restaurants in the area with breakfast specials so no need to worry. I would stay again since it is close to where I want to go without riding the Underground. I would classify this a an inexpensive, no frills place to put your head at night. If your into high end luxury where they fluff your pillow at night this is not the place. This is fine for those who want to spend their money on the sites.

<Content>I had the misfortune recently of staying in the St Giles Hotel, I was staying on business and had a single occupancy room reserved for myself. The room was the size of a cupboard with a make shift bathroom, I use the term 'bathroom' lightly as it was infact a toilet cubicle with a shower built in to the wall cavity. The cleanliness of the room was poor and the overall feel of the hotel was tired...........very tired with a strange smell of stale food in the corridors!

<Content>Stayed here again (before in April 2010). This time we were lucky our room was on an exterior side of the building so we had a better view for the window. Most room have a total lack of view. The building itself is very ugly, a real seventies style concrete monster. The location next to the subway station Tottenham Court Road and walking distance to Oxford Street en "West-End" region does it all. (Bath-) Rooms are small, even the double bed are ( 1.40 x 2.00 m), but still sufficient for a weekend trip.

Our room was at the back of the hotel overlooking a small side street, so very little traffic noise. Room a little on the small side for 3 of us, but clean and comfortable for the length of time we stayed in it. Very good breakfast served each morning. Hot and cold buffett. Found staff very helpful especially Concierge. Would definitely stay there again on a return visit to London. Margaret Fletcher Dublin, Ireland

<Content>Super location for shopping on Oxford street and easy access to the sight seeing busses and the tubes. Very small room with only 3 clothes hangers... breakfast was like I imagine it to be in a prison... loud, cantina like, walk araound with bricks to collect your scrambled eggs from large trays, thin coffee, lines everywhere and not enough tables for all the guests. We quickly decided to have our breakfast at a nearby cafe - eventhough it was already paid at the hotel. Try Cafe Rouge just around the corner - that was a nice and good experience. Friendly staff, perfect service, nice bar, The Italian restaurant at the hotel served a decent meal at ok prices. Also here the staff was friendly. Same location as at breakfast by the way. The spa/fitness/pool was closed for renovation during out stay... the pool was one of the reasons why we picked this hotel in the first place...

<Content>My girlfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights. After an initial "mix up" with our booking upon checking in (in which the staff were very unhelpful) we made it to our room. The room itself was quite small and very dated. The hotel is 1 min from oxford street so the location really is the best thing about this place. If your looking for simply a place to stay close to all the action and you can get it at the right price, then the St Giles is more than fine. But if your'e looking for good service and a nice looking or spacious room then go elsewhere.

<Content>We stayed here in 2 rooms. It was the hottest Easter on record and we were on the 12th floor. In a word, it was HOT. The room had a fan provided, which was no where near enough to keep us comfortable. To have air con was an extra £50 per room per night. The room was tiny, barely enough for double bed, wardrobe and dresser. The bathroom was clean but again tiny. For 1 double and 1 single for 4 nights cost £700+. The rooms were made up daily, the water was hot, the shower was adequate, towels clean. To use the gym would have cost, and part of the YMCA and not really part of the hotel. I would not rate the hotel higher than 2 star, but the on the upside, the location was excellent.

<Title>“My go-to in London”
<Content>Surely the best located budget hotel in London. 5 mins walk from Leicester Square, 2 mins from Oxford St and in the very heart of the theatre district. The rooms are more than adequate; comfortable beds and decent size bathrooms although the vast size of the place means there's always a lot of traffic in the corridors and the long waits for the lifts. Really like the breakfast - good range of hot and cold food, a minor quibble would be the unappealing room and the prevalence of guests who arrive down in slippers (hadn't really seen that in hotels before). Breakfast room doubles as an Italian restaurant by night and there's a Chinese eatery adjacent to the lively bar downstairs. Always buzzing with activity, this hotel is perfect for a weekend break to London

<Content>My boyfriend & I spent 2 nights at St Giles Hotel for a weekend break in London. After reading some of the reviews we were slightly concerned but when we arrived at the hotel it was lovely. The check-in went very smoothly and our room was ready for us. Our room was clean and had all we needed including hairdryer, coffee/tea facilities, air conditioning, TV etc. We didn't eat in the hotel so cannot comment on the restaurant/bar facilities. The hotel was situated right in the middle of the West End and it was perfect for us. We took a bus to Camden Market which was so straightforward and the stop was virtually outside the hotel. A perfect hotel for a London mini-break; we would definitely go back there.

<Content>I've stayed at the St Giles a couple times while leading a college learning abroad group -- I would never book it independently. The hotel is dingy, crowded, inadequately serviced, and pinched for space. The corridors and elevators are dark and too small, and this applies to the rooms as well. For a hotel with 700+ rooms, the four small elevators will keep you waiting and waiting (and if someone in the lobby pushes the call button while the door's still closing, you'll be caught in an endless and frustrating loop). If you're on floors 11 or 12, expect an elevator transfer, and yes, more waiting. The breakfast room is a zoo. Long lines, mediocre food and scarce seating will greet you unpleasantly.

<Title>“Seedy, Nasty, No Thanks”
<Content>Have stayed here a few times on business, as my other colleagues like it because its handy for the office. If I had control of booking the hotel, the St Giles is NOT where I would stay!! Rooms are dark, dingy and dirty and if someone told me that they hired rooms by the hour - I wouldn't be surprised!! (They don't) Beds are old and very soft. Bed linen is some of the worst I've ever experienced. Rooms are odd shapes - due to the architecture of the building and the windows only open a small crack. Some of the rooms I've stayed in have good views - London Eye etc, but others don't. The bar downstairs attracts a mixture of clientele - I wasn't a fan. Didn't eat here ever, due to the fact that you are in Central London, there is a wide choice. The lifts are very slow and small, and they have an ironing room which isn't particularly inviting to use. All in all, I've only stayed here because I've had too. If I had the choice, I'd find somewhere else!!

<Title>“Fabulous”
<Content>Stayed here on recommendation from another family member and was totally delighted. Close to the tube station, close to Oxford Road and within walking distance (if you're willing) of several other London highlights. We were upgraded to an executive room- staff at reception were quick, curteous and very helpful (as was the concierge). Breakfast was in the Japanese restaurant, again staff were fantastic. The cooked part of the breakfast was a little "minimalistic" but for someone like myself who prefers continental, I was more than happy. Unfortunately we didn't get chance to use the leisure facilities, but this is just one reason why I would be tempted to return. We went to the hotel bar a couple of times, and really enjoyed the busy, lively atmosphere. Really enjoyed our stay here.

<Title>“Good location, needs a major facelift”
<Content>We stayed for one night only. The room was small and the bed was a small double. It was very warm and we couldn't easily get the temperature down. The breakfast was fairly good but was served in what can only be described as a cafeteria. Not a great experience, especially for the price.

It was very hot in the rooms it was noisy when the window was open overnight but we were in central London. Breakfast was fine, plenty to eat shame that it was struggle to get a table.

<Title>“Not impressed”
<Content>A few friends went together, asked for rooms together and were given all over the hotel. Shared room with my daughter and it was very small. Although no smoking allowed in the Hotel the room was over come with it. The window only opened slightly and the queue at reception meant I didn't want to waste my time reporting it. Bar area dark and dismal, the resturant for breakfast was worse than the motorway services. Just like a shcool canteen. Only 4 small lifts not adequte for the amount of rooms, found many people having to use stairs, even with suitcases. Conciege very helpful, only goood thing!!

<Title>“Great location / Poor hotel”
<Content>The location is excellent with easy acces to the underground and plenty of shops, pubs and resturants. Concierge staff was very helpful. Front desk staff struggles with basic English and basic customer service. Room was awful. Zero ventilation. Window opens about 5 cm and drowns the room at all hours with noise from fans and compressors on the roof many floors below. Room was HOT, 5 degrees C outside and 25 degrees inside, with the window opened. Forget about life safety as there are no sprinklers in this highrise building.

However room was far to hot an aircon did not seem to be working, called reception twice but no-one ever came to fix it. Breakfast was good in the Japanese restaurant, table service so no queing.

<Title>“Great Location and free upgrade!!”
<Content>This was my second stay in The St Giles, and for a second time it was pleasant. The staff are really helpful and the guys on the door help you with your luggage. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Roof top executive suite, which also included breakfast in the japanese restaurant in the morning with table servive, rather than the buffet restaurant. We were going to the theatre, so went to the Japanese restaurant inside the hotel which was gorgeous and had a great pre-theatre set menu. The room had great views over the city and was near to Oxford Street and the theatre. It was clean and well manitained. I would definately re-visit the St Giles for a third time!! :o)

<Title>“Smallest room I've ever stayed in”
<Content>The room was extremely small, more like a corridor, only 4 ft wide. The location is handy for the tube at Tottenham Court Road, but because the window wouldn't shut properly I had a lot of noise coming in from outside traffic. The lack of carpet in the outside corridor meant that other guests made a lot of noise coming and going as well. Hence sleep was a challenge.

<Title>“run, run away.”
<Content>Not only would I not recommend this ‘hotel’ to ANYONE, I would actively stand outside the establishment and warn people about to check in to run, run away. In the 3 weeks prior to staying in this hotel, we had stayed in 8 hotels of the same rating, all of which cost less. We were skeptical from the start as to why we had to pay upfront, as this is usually only required to secure a discounted rate, but agreed, as we had no other option. I now realize why this was insisted on, as we definitely would have insisted on a HUGE reduction in our final bill if we were to have paid after the farce that was our stay at St Giles. Of a plethora of unpleasant experiences, these were just some: 1. Reception staff were slow and unhelpful on every occasion we dealt with them 2. A call from our room to reception (at approximately 7pm) to inform them that the cleaner had not left toilet paper when the room was cleaned went unanswered 5 times. A subsequent call to the concierge to ask what the deal was ended with us being put through to the reception again! Really helpful considering this was the problem in the first place. And yes, this sixth call also went unanswered. 3. The hallway carpet was ripped and stained with what looked like chewing gum. 4. Our room’s toilet was broken and wouldn’t flush. This was fixed, and a bent, laminated note apologizing for the defect was left in our room (this left us with the impression that these defects must be quite a common occurrence in order for laminated notes to be necessary). 5. The safe in our room was also broken. A complaint to reception about this went unactioned for our entire weeklong stay there. 6. 3 of the 5 TV channels in our room were too fuzzy to be watchable and the other two alternated between being fine and fuzzy also. 7. The window in our room wouldn’t open more than 10cm due to the great planning of putting the TV in front of it. This was lucky in a way, as some sort of LOUD buzzing generator was just outside and sounding like a helicopter. Great fun, as you can imagine. 8. The housekeepers knocked on the door at 8.30am – several times. Surely a system where you leave you keys at the front desk when you leave your room would allow the cleaners to know when guests had left their room and prevent them from interrupting guests attempting to have a sleep in on their holiday? 9. The ultimate catch was that, as our room was not air conditioned, we needed to leave the window open. However this meant we were kept awake by the generator. Ended up having to sleep with earplugs in order to get any sleep at all. Very relaxing I’m sure you’ll agree. 10. A long one, but a perfect example of the inept customer service on offer from St Giles. Two Internet kiosks in the lobby sat side by side. My friend and I went on these at the same time (note that this had to be paid for, whereas internet was offered for free at all other hotels we stayed at). My access was fine however my friend’s would not allow her to click through on many links, the timer simply counted down and the status bar read ‘done’ although the page had not updated at all. We went to speak to reception about this and the manager told us abruptly that nothing was wrong with the Internet and that the problem was due to the fact that she was trying to access online banking. Once I pointed out to him that at that very moment I had just completed mine, he pretty much accused me of lying, saying that online banking could not be completed in the hotel for security reasons. I pointed out to him that my screen was in fact still logged into my Bank’s Netbank but he ignored me and continued to insist that online banking could not be accessed. I pointed out that surely this is the main reason that hotel guests would want to access the Internet during a holiday but he again insisted. I ended up becoming so frustrated with this man that I had to leave and go back to my room, as I was very close to loosing my temper completely due to the fact that he was not speaking logically. After being refused her money back for the defunct computer, my friend then jumped onto my computer and was able to complete her online banking also. 11. The lifts were ridiculous. The lift from reception was always packed to the point that you could be buried in the armpit of a fellow guest for much of the trip, something I do not wish upon anyone. The line for the lift often spilled out of the lift lobby area and into the main reception area. Getting the lift down from your room meant a wait of about 10mins, and once the lift did arrive it was often full and you would have to wait all over again for another. We ended up walking up and down 7 floors of the fire stairs several times as it was quicker and less traumatic to the nostrils. 12. Despite paying more than any of the other 8 hotels we had previously stayed in (all of which included breakfast), breakfast was not included – although by the look of the overcrowded breakfast room, that was a good thing.

<Title>“Noisy, small, uncomfortable, unfriendly”
<Content>Tiny rooms (even the deluxe), very noisy, very hot and we couldnt turn the radiator off, and the pillows were virtually non-existant. I only encountered the staff on check out (my wife arrived a day earlier than me) but I found them surly, rude and unhelpful. The breakfast was very poor too, much better is available round the corner in McDonalds at half the cost.. It would probably be ok for one night if you were in London for a shopping or theatre trip but for anything else I would avoid like the plague, especially if your visit is for leisure and relaxation.

<Title>“very central but very noisy”
<Content>We stayed with friends for just one night Friday 11th March as we were going to see The Jersey Boys. The hotel is very central to everything and very easy to find from Waterloo. We were given rooms 503&504. The rooms were the smallest we have ever stayed in and as both my husband and my friends husband are very tall manouvering around the room was quite difficult. Having said that the rooms were very clean and the showers excellent. The staff were also very helpful.The worst problem was the noise. We were situated on the corner overlooking Tottenham Court Rd opposite Sainsburys who had a food delivery at midnight. The noise level of the metal crates being crashed off and on the lorries was so loud and went on for at least half an hour. Also the road itself isalso very noisy with all the sirens and people shouting. We all had very little sleep. I do not know if it is quieter at the other side of the hotel but I would not like to have spent anymore than one night in that room. Breakfast was on offer and was quite acceptable although we did have to queue a while. We probably would not stay again.

<Title>“Great for large groups”
<Content>I stayed here as part of a group of over 30 women for a hen do recently. Having stayed here before, I knew that an opinion of the hotel could have a lot to do with what room you are allocated. This wasn't a worry, we were only staying one night. We just needed a clean bed (all twin rooms) and bathroom. The location of the hotel is as good as it gets for what girls want - Oxford Street, the theatres, bars and somewhere to eat. Especially because we were only there for 2 days/1 night, it was important to not spend too much time travelling around (believe me, when there's 30 odd of you, this isn't so easy). This is why people keep going back. Unfortunately, the quality of the hotel isn't great. It is a large hotel, so there are long waits for the lifts (needed if on the 8th floor with a big suitcase), a queue for the canteen style restaurant for mass produced breakfast and lots of noise from other guests at night. The cleanliness is a bit dubious, I was pleased our bathroom was clean though. However, there was a not-so-nice-smelling damp stain on entering the room, we suspected from the bathroom. The room wasn't the largest by any standards but was fine for a night. The beds were clean and mine was quite comfy. The bathroom was small but nothing unusual there. I would recommend to anyone to take their own bath towel, the postage stamp size towels don't hide a great deal! There were spare towels in the wardrobe but these were only slightly bigger. Also, take a hair dryer if you use one. My friend discovered that the air is not warm enough to dry hair but the actual dryer heats up enough to burn your hand. Overall, if going to London for one night again, or travelling with a group, this hotel would be ideal. It suited us perfectly for what we needed. If part of a romantic break though, I'd book a Premier Inn instead. If you have booked this hotel, don't worry. It's not amazing but it's not terrible either.

We stayed in second floor over entrence side very quiet windows double glazed had a lovely relaxing time. There is a swimming pool and large leisure centre at an extra cost plus a casino. Some people have slated this hotel looking at some reviews I personnally would recommend this hotel to anyone. The hotel is very central, walkable to many theatre and shops. Has a good range of breakfast for all nationalities and there is always a taxi outside!!! Try it ..

<Title>“Better than I expected”
<Content>We stopped at the St. Giles hotel from Wednesday to Friday and wasn't expecting much. As we approached the hotel, it looks great from the outside and as good in. We were given a room on the eighth floor and although it was nice yet basic, it was quite small. We put that down to being at the end of the row, but it was still small. We also found that we heard most conversations next door and people walking directly above us. This was quite annoying! Our rooms were cleaned to a high standard and towels were changed. We booked bed and breakfast and as it's advertised continental breakfast we wasn't expecting much, but we was wrong. The selection was fantastic. Everything from croissants and coffee to full English and as much as you can stomach. It was all fresh and delicious. The hotel location was perfect, literally 3 minute walk to tottenham court road station and 4 minutes to Oxford street. Overall, very pleased and when returning to London, I'll book again.

<Title>“Noisy hotel”
<Content>The hotel is centrally located. Rooms are reasonable sizes for Central LOndon. Issue is the noise level. On floor 1 over front entrance. Generator going 24/7 noisy road outside and windows not keeping any sound out at all! Not a great place to stay for business as so little sleep due to constant traffic, banging and even voices from the street being audible. I travel a lot and this is noisiest hotel I've ever been in. Breakfast is European buffet of poor canteen style. Same room doubles as Italian restaraurant at night which is also poor. Might be writing this grumpy at 6 in the morning, but that's because this place is too noisy to sleep!

<Content>I have stayed here many times but this time I feel the standard has dropped tremendously since the last time I stayed. First of all I had paid for breakfast they tried to charge me again for all three of us. The single room I got was absolutely disgraceful I have a bigger cupboard at home. The dining room is so full we had to queue for ages for breakfast we couldn't tell anyone because I didn't find anyone who spoke English. I always recommended this hotel but I definitely wont in the future.

<Content>Great location. Friendly and efficient staff, especially the chap who sweeps the pavement outside the Hotel entrance in the mornings. But, the room was tiny. The T.V. reception was poor. The T.V. remote only partially functioned. The sound insulation, both inside and outside was awful, and being central London, it was very noisy. No heating control in the room. But - great location. Couple of minutes walk to Oxford Street, Charing Cross Road, Tottenham Court Road Tube station. I stayed for 4 nights which I wouldn't recommend, but you should be okay for 1 or 2 nights if you're in London for a bit of shopping, sight seeing and a show.

<Title>“Location,location,location”
<Content>Booked for me as a valentine treat break to London. Read reviews and waited to see with own eyes ... Location is fantastic literally fifty yards from Tottenham Court Road tube and easy walking distance for Covent Garden, Leicester Square, British museum, Theatre land, Soho etc really mean walking distance as I am a walking woose! The hotel has a concierge and large efficient reception. There are 3 restaurants, a bar and access to the attached Gym, sauna etc. I cannot comment on any of the restaurants or gym as did not use these facilities. The bar was nice was table service however this was expressed in London prices. The hotel is large, almost 700 rooms, ours was a deluxe occupying a corner of one of the wings, it consisted of a small double bedroom, very small shower room and small sitting room with setee, TV, kettle and wardrobe. The rooms were very clean and with windows closed pretty quiet. Faults - no over head lights so putting on make up tricky. Flip side only blinds within windows to block out light , no curtains so wake early if so affected! We did not have breakfast included in our deal, Hotel offered for £7 extra. We breakfasted each day at Cafe Rouge turn left at end of road and a few doors down, very pleasant. The only other comment is regarding the lifts rather slow trying to get downstairs. Overall experience very good, service good,location excellent and value for money excellent. Would we stay again? Yes

<Title>“Excellent Location!”
<Content>The first thought i had of this hotel, whilst entering, was wow! The reception area is posh and welcoming. The corridors are a bit shabby towards the room. I was very worried about this hotel as heard there were rats in the corridor. I can't see how this is the case! We stayed on the 8th floor and i doubt rats would go that high up... the corridors aren't the nicest, but I doubt there are rats there. The room was a bit small but for a city hotel that's expected. The beds were very comfy, the TV had a lot of channels which was nice, and the bathroom was nice and most importantly clean! There is one thing that is a disappointment with this hotel, that is the breakfast. There is a large room for it, and a lot of staff. But our table wasn't clean where we sat. The food was very disappointing.. all me and my friend ate was a bread roll and a croissant. It is a shame because the hotel is very nice and the location is perfect!! Even though the breakfast wasn't what we expected.. we would definitely consider staying at this hotel in the future when we re-visit London.

<Content>This hotel is not that bad! I am fussy and was worried after reading other reviews. The rooms are not that small. Rooms are clean and beds are comfortable. Complimentary tea and coffee in rooms which is always a bonus. Breakfast was sufficient. The only negative comment is that we did have to wait for a lift - especially during peak times. Excellent location for Covent Garden and Oxford Street. Tottenham Court Road tube station is opposite the hotel. Concierge staff were exceptional and we did not have to pay to leave our luggage for a few hours after check-out. This is not the Ritz but for location I would stay here again.

<Title>“Fabulusss”
<Content>We arrived for a 1 night stay not expecting much. What a great hotel in the centre of London, the best we have ever stayed at. We were upgraded to an executive suite at no extra cost & thrown in a fully cooked breakfast, but the room was to die for, faultless, spotless, modern, all the facilities at hand. Next time I visit London & I do it 3-4 times a year, I will certainly stay here. Great food, great area, friendly staff. The only reason that the sleep quality was marked 4 is because we are not use to sleeping in a big City were thing happen all night.

<Title>“Excellent location, but that was it!”
<Content>We picked this hotel for its location but we paid £90 per person. The room was tiny. The lighting was terrible, even in the bathroom. It was hard to put my make up on. The window which had no curtain was small and opened up onto a brick wall. The tv was up really high and not even teaspoons with the cups, just stirrers. I work in a Travelodge and the rooms are double the size and you can see what you are doing. Much better value for money!!

<Title>“Very Central”
<Content>Last week we have spent two enjoyable nights at this hotel. It is very central, a minute away from Tottenham Court Road Station/Oxford Street. Room was small but clean and comfortable. Staff was helfpul overall. Asked the concierge for info re taxi service to Heathrow Airport (The Piccadily Line was not working to Heathrow last weekend). In a couple of seconds, the concierge on duty calculated a bill of £80 (reaching Paddington Station by taxi and then onwards to the airport by express train)! He said he would be able to find a taxi at £50. Eventually we were have found a taxi service (very recommendable) at £30! Bakc to the hotel, the only complaint we have is when one comes to use the lifts. There are four lifts but used continuously. So much so that we (as did other patrons) often used the emergency lifts. Also, we noted a long queue of people waiting to enter the El Grasso breakfast room.

<Title>“speaking as we found”
<Content>We had booked this hotel for a two night stay on a trusted friends recommendation so it was somewhat worrying to read some of the reviews posted lately. We arrived on a very busy monday afternoon to a long queue for check in however the efficient staff kept the queue moving. Elisabett? gave us a geniunely warm welcome and had us checked in in no time. We took the lift to our room 676 and first impressions were good the lifts and public areas all clean and tidy. Our room was in the east wing and yes it was small but absolutely spotlessly clean. As we only intended to use the room to sleep and shower in the size wasn't an issue, cleanliness far more important to us so no complaints so far. The bathroom was small but again cleaned to a high standard the shower was good with lots of hot water the towels pristine white and fluffy. The room didn't have a view but again not important to us there was tea/coffee making facilities, hairdrier and flat screen tv. The bed was a standard double but very comfy made up with snow white sheets.All in all, after worrying about all the negative reviews, we were more than satisfied with our room. The only noise we heard during the night was that of thoughtless guests who make noise returning to there rooms but this happens in most hotels! Location was brilliant within walking distance of the landmarks, shops and theatres with a Sainsburys central shop across the road. Breakfast was a slight let down as the breakfast room had a bit of a " canteen" feel to it very busy and you had to search for a table, however the extremely hard working staff soon cleared and cleaned tables and kept things moving well. There was ample choice of cereal only one type of bread roll, cheese and ham, croissants but no pastries there was sausage, bacon, hash browns etc available and again the efficient staff worked hard to keep all toppped up. All in all the St Giles provided us with a very enjoyable stay and we have absolutley no complaints at all .

<Title>“Brilliant Central Location”
<Content>We stayed at the St. Giles Hotel on the 19th February. Check in was a bit chaotic and we did have to wait an hour to get our room. We had booked an executive room and eventually got our keys at 3pm. We were dealt with an employee called Mark, I think, who was very good and offered us coffee while we were waiting for our room to be prepared. Our room was very nice on the 9th floor. Not quite as large as I had expected, but all the facilities promised were there. We had breakfast in the executive breakfast room which was excellent. There was a good choice of cereals etc and a lovely freshly cooked breakfast. The staff were very nice and efficient. All in all, after a bit of a dodgy start, we really enjoyed our stay at this very central, really busy, hotel. I think we would stay again if were going to a theatre in the near vicinity.

<Title>“Great location, lovely clean rooms .....”
<Content>I was a bit wary about staying here due to the mixed feedback - however I am glad I ignored their advice ! This hotel is in a great location, next to Tottenham Court Road tube station. We were able to check in much earlier than 2pm, and our room (deluxe room) was fine. It was very clean and all amenities were presented well. I can understand that the rooms would be tiny if a standard room was chosen, however the small lounge area with the deluxe option was definately worth the extra £10 ! The bathroom was slightly small, but it had a great high powered shower, but hey its central London! The staff were very friendly and helpful, and the consierge service was a bonus. One tip I would give is the cleaners are rather keen to get the rooms cleaned nice and early in the morning - so I would get your 'do not disturb' on the door the night before ! I would definately recommend this hotel to people on a sightseeing trip to London, and will be staying again.

<Title>“Find a better deal than this!!”
<Content>You can find a much better place to stay than this hotel which is in a great location walking distance from Trafalgar Square and the British Museum, but has TEENY rooms, no curtains with HUGE SPOTLIGHTS all around the hotel which shine right into your room!! We'd never stay here again. Out a bit farther is the Rhodes Hotel Bed and Breakfast near Hyde Park - great deal and includes breakfast, much nicer rooms and esp. nice bathrooms, and much prettier area. Close to Lancaster Gate and Paddington Station tubes.

<Title>“Fantastic location, room not as website”
<Content>We stayed here for 2 nights the location was fantastic! A stones throw from Oxford street and 10 minute walk from covent garden. My partner was disappointed with the size of the room, we had upgraded to an executive room and although it had everything we needed it was no more executive than a bog standard premiere inn. The main thing I would say is if you are clostraphobic do not book an executive room, the standard lift only goes to floor 11 & beyond this u use the executive lift, this was a squeeze with three people and not big enough to turn around in! Breakfast was lovely the first morning however poor on the second with our boiled egg and soldiers turning up hard boiled, also choice was limited. We ate in the Chinese restaurant which although nothing to look at served lovely food. All in all we had a great time but would choose another hotel for our next visit.

<Title>“Gret location, not good hotel”
<Content>This hotel is in a great location right off Oxford Street, so very handy for shopping, West End and sightseeing. Rooms are very very small, carpets need a good clean, Sink and shower were very grubby - yellow scum stains in both. Bathroom is miniature hard to get in and close the door. Only 1 power outlet available, very poor lighting in room. Room very warm no way to adjust heat and window faced another wall so no air coming in there. Lifts were so busy we were 20 mins waiting at peak times for them (with an injured party on the 11th floor so stairs were not an option) This hotel is fine if you just spend the minimum amount of time in it - great location.

<Title>“Smelly rooms!!!”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel with my two children and a friend. We had two rooms on the 6th floor adjacent to each other. The hotel location was ideal, two minutes walk from the underground. Both rooms with twin beds were small. There was also limited space in the bathroom. A previous reviewer commented that the hotel was far too hot. I have to agree. It was very uncomfortable, so much so that sweat was constantly running down guests faces. I tried to open the bedroom window to cool the room but upon doing so a nauseating smell entered the room. My guess is that we were situated right above the kitchen extractor fans. The smell of fish and stale fat was was revolting. We were unable to locate a temperature control in the room so had to sleep with a noisy fan which consequently disturbed our sleep. We paid 250.00 UK pounds per night for this room. The hotel is so busy trying to get the lifts is a joke. After waiting far too long, we always ended up going down the back stairs to reception. This proved problematic when we had our heavy luggage. The dining area of the hotel was like a free for all, works canteen rather than a restaurant. It was far too hot. So much so, we began to feel unwell. We struggled to find seats and wandered around aimlessly in the hope that someone would vacate their seat. The food was average, rather plain and tasteless. On a positive note, the reception staff were very efficient and polite and the conceiege staff were fantastic, going out onto the street and hailing a taxi for us and holding the taxi car door open like a true gentleman. Upon having to vacate our room at 10am we requested our luggage be stored for a couple of hours. We got charged for this service. Over the years, I have stayed at many hotels throughout the world and never have I had to pay for this service previously. Would I recommend staying at this hotel - most definately not!!!

<Title>“Great location, comfortable, bit pricy...”
<Content>I stayed at the St Giles twice on my last trip to the UK, just before Xmas and just after New Years 2010. My first stay I stayed in a single room which I dont recommend. I may as well have slept in a shoe box - the room was tiny, the bed even tinier (Im an average height 20 year old girl and my feet were hanging over the end) and I could barely stretch my arms out either side of me in the bathroom (forget about the shower). It was also quite noisy at night (but I suppose that has to be taken with a grain of salt with a hotel in this location). My second stay I upgraded to a double room which was a huge improvement - I definitely recommend paying that little bit more for the upgrade. The room was much bigger and the bathroom really nice - quite modern with a large shower/bath. It also wasnt as noisy I noticed. The bed was really comfy too. I would recommend this hotel (just dont go for a single room). The reception staff were really friendly and efficient, the bar downstairs was pretty cool and decently priced, and the location is excellent. I love the Bloomsbury area and the hotel is like a 2min walk from the shopping on Oxford St and about 5 mins from the theatres of Shaftesbury Ave. While the price was a little high, it was definitely worth it to be so central to everything.

<Title>“Great location but missing the attention to detail”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The location is excellent with all of central London in easy reach thanks to Tottenham Court Road tube station literally on the hotels doorstep. There is plenty of shops, restaurants and bars locally which gives you the chance to escape the confines of the hotel should you choose. I stayed in a standard double which at £139 per night wasn't overly expensive for London but certainly isn't the cheapest. The room was very small with a fully built in wardobe, cubby holes for clothes etc including a desk with chair , the problem was the TV was above all the built in storage meaning that when seated at the desk you couldn't watch it. There wasn't enough room for anything else other than the bed & the 2 bedside cabinets so no occassional chair or seperate table. The room was clean & functional but lacked basic expectations for a room of that price. It had soap & shower gel but no moisturisers or shampoo or conditioner, it also lacked biscuits with the tea coffee facilities and didn't offer any food that could be delivered to your room, all stuff I would expect for £139 per night. On 2 occassions I ate in the chinese restaurant (Lazy Dog - I think its called) located just off reception and the food was very nice and the service brisk, however on the first night and despite leaving my credit card details at reception I had to abandon my drink to go to reception with the waiter as the restaurant couldn't put it on my room tab, only to arrive at reception to be told it was fine! The breakfast was ok and offered a variety such as cereals, english breakfast or continental fayre but again similar to other areas it was lacking that extra little bit, for example the cooked breakfast didn't offer mushrooms, tomatoes, eggs (other than scrambled) or black pudding, the continental consisted of 1 type of cheese slice and 1 type of ham & other than a bowl of apples there was no fresh fruit to speak off like you get in other quality hotels priced at that point. Also everything is self service including toast & coffee. Best point about the hotel is the location, least favourite point is the value for money in relation to what you receive.

<Title>“I would n't stay there again”
<Content>The location is perfect. Next to a metro station (Totenham Court), next to Oxford street (shopping, walking etc), within a walking distance to Picadilly Circus, Oxford Circus, Leicester sqr, Covent Garden. BUT... The rooms are the smallest I have ever stayed in. You cannot imagine how small. If someone wants to open a bag the other one has to be on the bed or in the toilet, that is also small, very small. You could say that this is a hotel for Hobits. Only Frodo would be comfortable in such a room. When I asked for a bigger room they showed me a plan of the hotel and explained to me that I had the bigger room of the floor. All the others are even smaller. Also the heating was not working properly and instead of fixing it they brought us a carrying heating device that we put in the plug (one of the two that this room has). As a result the room wasn't heated properly and we could not charge both our cell phones because we only had one plug. Finally when we asked for an adaptor to charge our phones they made us buy one from the concierge.

<Title>“Avoid this place!”
<Content>Poor reception staff. Steps up to Reception with no alternative to carry cases. Awful dated concrete building shared with YMCA. So-called double room tiny, claustrophobic, poorly furnished and equipped - all very dated and inadequate. Blind would not close. Grubby chair and carpets. Ancient TV with no picture just snow. Paid £91 through Expotel which seems a rip-off given how dreadful the place is. And they have the cheek to charge £6 per hour for wi-fi when now it is free at many other hotels. The worst hotel I have stayed in for a long time. Would have filled in their feedback form but that was missing from the folder. Avoid this place.

<Content>On the positive side this hotel has an excellent location right in the heart of London and you couldn't get a more central hotel at the price. On the negative side the rooms are VERY small and the hotel is desperately in need of renovation. If you're not going to spend much time in the hotel then it is perfeclty adequate but it is very far from luxurious.

<Content>Stayed two nights for theatre break.. Location is ideal, close to many of the theatres and night life but only a minute from tube station and many bus routes. Very busy when we were there (midweek). Breakfast area not the most appealing although staff couldn`t be faulted. Actual breakfast was fairly basic but well cooked and plentiful. Our room was fairly small but was okay for a few nights, probably more suitable as a single. Fitness facilities appear very good if that way inclined

<Title>“Horrible”
<Content>Stayed in this hotel for business. Rooms small, breakfast very minimal. Staff unhelpful. The conference facilities were a joke. Small conference rooms, bad lighting and not properly trained staff. A video screen was set up instead of a projector,- making it impossible for the participants to read the power point presentations. Nobody on site were able to handle the equipment or turn it on properly. Conference staff did not show up before 10 minutes before start, no coffee the first day, and no lunch. Apparently a booking mistake had occured placing 60 people in one 35 square meeter room, causing a lack of air. When we asked for a projector we were told that this couldn't be arranged. Conference person also refused to lock up a group room we had ordered even if it was available due to that the booking personnel had made a mistake in setting the time a bit later during the day. Will not ever ever go to this hotel again.

The Exec rooms which i usually stay at are good. It is clean and quiet. Very nice staff in the exec breakfast area Exec check in is useful The Bad :- All Non Exec rooms are TINY The standard breakfast is OK if you want cereal :) The service (reception) is hit and miss. The lifts are a joke !! Stay away from the rooms near the lifts and lower floors. To be honest - I would recommend this to others (i am using this hotel for a personal visit in a few weeks)

<Title>“very pleasantly surprised!”
<Content>I had already booked - and paid for - one night at St Giles as part of a Theatre break package THEN read some awful reviews on this hotel! I sent an e-mail to the hotel outlining my concerns and requesting a clean, quiet and high room.......ALL my requests were met and I found ALL the staff we met from Reception to the Dining room at breakfast were polite and helpful. The location of the hotel is perfect for Theatres - we enjoyed 'Grease!' I would recommend this hotel !

<Title>“Location! Location!”
<Content>Stayed in a twinbedded room for a shoppingweekend and after reading different reviews I didn't know what to except, but I was happy with my choice for this hotel. It is a very large hotel, and the main reason I would go there again is the location. The highstreetfashionshops are just around the corner and also Covent Garden is within easy walking distance. Tube just a few steps from the hotel. For this pricerange in the touristcenter of London, this is certainly a good value hotel. The room was big enough, and the streetnoise was not too much. Only we had a room near some sort of ventilationsystem, so that was noisy during the night. Shower was hot but small. Bed was ok, but offcourse not very very comfortable, but in this pricerange this is ok. The room was also clean enough, but also not very very clean. At least no dirty stains or whatever, so that's also ok. Used the breakfastbuffet, and that was also ok, enough choice. We were a little to early but our rooms were ready. And when checking out, you can leave your luggage free at the congierge. When you're looking for a very central hotel for a normal price this hotel is ok for you! But if you can't stand the noise and looking for a very very comfortable and very clean place don't go there. But remember that it's central London and that the standard there is different. And for this location and for this price it's hard to find a better deal I think.

<Title>“Location for sure...pot luck with bedroom allocation. We were very lucky”
<Content>Firstly, I think we were lucky to get the room we did. We had e-mailed the hotel prior to arriving asking for a nice room. We were in room 754 and we had one of the biggest rooms on that floor according to the room map on the back of the door. I really think this would be an entirely different review had we got one of the rooms which appeared to be half the size of ours. Check In : We arrived at the reception desk at 11.30 and our room was ready. Pleasantly surprised. We reminded the receptionist of our room request, she said to go up and take a look at our room and that if we were not happy to come back down. This sounded very reasonable so we took our bags to the lifts and made our way up. Lifts: Worked fine for most of our 5 day stay. The only time they are slow is when most of the hotel wants to use them at the same time. There are 700 rooms and 4/5 lifts. Otherwise they were not a problem. The Room: Pleasantly surprised on arrival. Bathroom is small but the shower was great to be fair! Plenty of hot water every time. We had enought storage space for all our stuff, and a small tv on a stand in the corner. It was more than adequate. Our only problem with the room and our stay in fact was the in room safe. It wasn't working from day 1 and despite numerous requests was never fixed. We put our cash etc in the hotel reception safe the 1st time but we didnt bother doing this for the rest of the time. Luckily we got away with it. The room was clean and our sheets were changed every day. Towels weren't a problem either. Location: As all other reviewers say, this one has it. Outstanding location. Would I stay here again? Absolutely, but I would ensure I got the same room, not one of the smaller ones. I think this is where the majority bad reviews come from. People paying same money as us 100gbp per room per night and getting allocated a box to stay in.

<Title>“Used Condom found on hotel room floor.”
<Content>I booked a single room, and they are very small. Have everything you'd need for a short stay, but very pokey. I checked into my room and was rather disgusted to find a used condom on the floor by my bed. Do they not clean their rooms? I was moved to another room (no upgrade offered, barely a word of apology). Although cleaner, it faced on Tottenham Court Road. Sounds of revelry and traffic were heard through the night. Great location, poor service. Rooms adequate but small. I won't be going back.

<Title>“A decent priced hotel in a perfect location for London "newbies"!!!”
<Content>My husband & I stayed here during a 36 hour (extended) layover from Heathrow. We just wanted to take some time to explore London and St Giles was the PERFECT place to be for this! We were centrally located to the tube station, within easy walking distance of one of the on/off bus tour stops, and within easy walking to the major Christmas & shopping sites. As for the hotel, don't be scared away by the negative reviews. Check in was easy and quick, the hotel lobby & amenities were nice, and my room was clean. The room was small, but we used it as a crashpad-- obviously don't stay here if you like to lounge about in your hotel room & want to watch television for hours on end. But, if you're looking for a decent safe hotel in a location convenient to theaters, shopping or sightseeing, this is an easy, inexpensive choice to make!

<Title>“Great location, decent value, modest and comfortable room”
<Content>St. Giles is located just off Tottenham Court Road near the junction with Oxford Street. The tube is only a few minutes walk away and you are within easy walking distance of all the shops. If you know your way around central London by foot reasonably well then Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Soho and attractions like the British Museum are all within 5-15 minutes walking distance. The rest of central London is also very easily reached by tube from this location. The area in which the hotel is situated (Bloomsbury) feels safe enough as London can be an overwhelming place if you aren't familiar with all the crowds and a city that never sleeps. If you want a hotel in a quiet and chilled out area then St. Giles might not be for you with it being just off the Tottenham Court Road. There is discounted access to the gym and pool next door but we didn't have time to try the facilities as London has too much to offer. The room we stayed in was modestly sized, decorated and furnished (nothing luxurious but nothing off-putting) and it was also clean as was the bathroom. It was also warm and comfortable. I wouldn't have any issues with staying at St. Giles again if the price remains competitive.

<Title>“An Hotel with lots of smiles, thats what you get when you stay at St. Giles!”
<Content>My friend and I went to London for a few days before Christmas to do a bit of shopping and go to the theatre. We decided to stop at St. Giles on the recommendation of my friend who had been before. From the moment we came out of the taxi to the moment we left the staff were so helpful. They were extremely polite at all times, and nothing seem to be any problem to them. The hotel was beautiful, very clean and looked so inviting on first glance. The rooms were good. We shared a room with two single beds and it had an ensuite, although a little bit small but it was okay for us. It was very clean and the maids came every day to change the towels and clean rooms. The hotel was in the right location for us, just round the corner of oxford street where all the hussle and bussle was going on, but you couldn't hear anything from our rooms. The Dominon theatre was just round the corner, and so were cafe rouge and Garfunnkels where we had a lovely meal, and breakfasts in each! There was a lovely restaurant in the Hotel its self. It was a japanese one, where we had a lovely Christmas dinnner Japanese style and the waiters were so friendly. All in all we had a funtastic three days there and would recommend to everyone that St. Giles with a smile is the best hotel to stop a while!!!

<Title>“An absoloute rip off!”
<Content>me and my boyfriend booked the stgiles a month early before our shopping visit, we booked on the phone and the reservations lady seemed friendly and asif she knew what she was on about. We had never stayed in london before and when we saw this hotel online we thought it looked lovely as we had searched through the pictures, thinking this is what we will get! Little did we know it would be so different! So we made our booking for 2 nights, the reservations lady gave us a price of £135 for both nights i thought it wasnt right so i made my boyfriend call back and double check, and we were given the same answer a TOTAL of £135 for both nights. We were extremely happy and couldnt wait to get to london. We travelled for almost 3 hours from portsmouth to london and arrived around 9:30 in the evening. When we got to reception was when the problems started.The lady at reception said its £135 PER night, the reception staff seemed asif they didnt have a clue how to deal with our complaint about being given wrong information. we were told we had to pay for the 1st night and speak to reservation in the morning. So we decided to pay for the 1st night and do so. We checked in got our key and went to the lift. The corridoors and interior of he hotel were very nice, but our room was something else. We got in the lift and were on the 9th floor. We struggled to find our room as it was right in corner behind the door we were holding open, So if u were to walk out of our room door and someone was to be entering the corridoor you would get smacked in the face! When we opened our room door i physically couldnt help but laugh. It was the size of a box and looked like something from the 1960's. it was very basic, a bed a kettle a tele and a phone. All of which were dated! NOTHING like the stgiles websit photos. We payed £135 pound for this room which personaly i wouldnt pay £35 for. So we werent happy at all. But in the morning we spoke to reservtions about the booking and the room. They couldt do anything apart from lower the price and upgrade our room but i was still £109 which frankly we couldnt afford. We basically got fobbed off and were told the rate we had payed was too high! but wouldnt give us any money back. So all in all. Reservations - useless, Manager - useless, Room - RIDICULOUS, Value for money - NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST, Location, Brilliant. I wouldnt reccomend this hotel to ANYONE NOT EVEN FOR THE LOCATION

<Title>“Tiny but perfect”
<Content>Yes, the room was small - looked like a cruise ship cabin. But it seemed recently redone with nice classy clean and simple fixtures and furniture. They managed to effectively maximize the space and keep all amenities in tact. There was a coffee maker and plenty of tea and Nespresso packs, hair dryer, great shower, plenty of lights around the room and a clean and comfortable bed. If you don't want to hang out/entertain in your room and just want a convenient, clean, safe and comfortable place, this fits the bill. Also, I did not notice any outside noise at all and had a great night sleep. All this for what I thought was a very reasonable price in London.

<Title>“You get what you pay for, but hotel feels unsafe.”
<Content>Stayed at the hotel for two days in November. The location of the hotel is good, just off Oxford street- close to Tottenham court Road tube station. I was looking for a budget hotel in London- I arrived early and was told to come back some hours later, the first room I got was stinking of old cigarette smoke and there was noisy work going on from the floor beneath. The kind man in the reception changed my room within two minutes when I complained. The hotel is HUGE- and there are plenty of people in the reception all the time. I cannot quite imagine that security(is there is any) can get a good picture of who walks in and out of the hotel. There are also many rooms on the floors, and unfortunately as a solo traveller it is designed in a way where sometimes you get a feeling that someone with not good intentions could hide. The elevators also goes very slowly, and I couldnt find the staircases so I felt this was very uncomfortable. The hotel-rooms are small, but if you are on a budget, and with someone the hotel might be ok. I would rather look for a smaller hotel- or pay a bit more to feel safe.

<Content>Rooms are tiny and very very dated. If you want to relax then this isn't the hotel for you, if you purely want to get your head down for a few hours after a night out then its ok. Location is central however that obviously means noisy too. Restaurant is poor as is the bar. Shop around, there are much better hotels in London for the same price.

<Title>“Very Tired Looking Hotel - Tiny Room - still in the 1970's”
<Content>Use this hotel for location only.. Its right in the centre of everything.. however other than that avoid.. its very tired looking 1970's decor compliment the tiny cramped rooms.. peeling paint, dirty mould in the tiny shower / toilet area, fuzzy tv (only basic 5 channels), and still cigarette burns in the duvet cover (shows how long since they have been replaced).. all add to the rather sad characteristic of this hotel.. which I sure was a top notch hotel in days gone by. At average price at approx £110 per night.. (room only), I think next time I will get a far better chain hotel, with the cleanliness space and quality.. (at less money), and endure a 5 min tube ride to the location. This hotel survives entirely on its location.. (Unless of course the seedy 1970's themed, scruffy style hotel is for you..)

<Title>“Location, Location, location.”
<Content>The price was cheap, the room was tiny but this hotel is in an amazing location. 30 Seconds walk to the Tube and many stores etc. As i said the room is small but the hotel is fine. The lifts were slow so ask for a lower level room (if you need to take the stairs). I would stay there again but it was only me in the room so if you're traveling with two try one of the bigger rooms. I didnt see them but i was told that they are bigger. Hot water was constant (unlike other London Hotels) but maybe in summer it could get hot. No A/C in the room i was in but it did have a portable fan and a heater. The window did open for air circulation

<Title>“avoid this hotel if possible”
<Content>Stayed here on business due to many other hotels being fully booked – it was very poor. The room was scruffy, cramped and dated with a bizarre layout. TV was small with poor signal and very limited channels (1-5 only). The hotel website mentions that guests have access to the gym in the basement but don’t make it clear that you have to pay £5 to use it – they might as well say you’ve got access to any gym in London where you can pay on the door! Bizarrely I found the feedback form from the previous guest in the room which had been left in the hotel guidebook – they were scathing and you’d think the hotel would try to make sure the next guest didn’t see their feedback…. Very poor. one plus point is the location - but you'd be better off finding a park bench nearby to sleep on....

<Title>“Excellent Location, room size was a bit of a shock..but hey, it's London”
<Content>I booked St Giles hotel because I read alot of good reviews about the place. After reading all the rave reviews I expected a bit more than what we got. I think we paid around 110 pounds a night for the room. I recommend printing out a map to help you navigate from the tube station to the hotel as we were lost for almost half an hour with our luggage. It's down a side street in the main shopping street. My boyfriend and I had never been to Europe before and had only traveled around asia. For anybody who has been to asia you will know that for $150 a night you can stay in an amazing 5 star hotel with buffet breakfast included. I guess we were expecting our room to be alot bigger than it was. We were a little shocked when we arrived in our room and the bed literally filled the room. There was a tiny tv up in the corner and a little station where you could make tea/coffee. The shower was probably half the size of a normal sized shower and the curtain would blow in and stick to you while showering. The bathroom floor would flood too. The breakfast was a pastry and piece of fruit per day with the choice of an orange juice or tea/coffee. It's called 'coffee2go' so you can't sit down if one of the 4 small tables and chairs are being used. I think that for a hotel with such a great location in London its good value for money. I think I would have preferred to stay a little further out and just catch the tube in to where I wanted to go and have a bigger room. I found one of the staff members to be a little bit rude but for the most part they were friendly. Not 'go out of your way' type of friendly, just pleasant to deal with. If you've only traveled to asia before then be prepared for a shock when you see the size of your room and the breakfast. If you're a seasoned Europe traveler and are looking to stay in central London then this is the place for you. Oh I forgot to mention that it has a great leisure center which we joined for only a few pounds for the week. Theres also a supermarket across the road and plenty of pubs around if you are looking for something to eat. Enjoy London!

<Content>The location is one of the best in London if you like the club scene and like to shop. The hotel itself is like a airport, crowded, noisy and not very clean. The elevetors are old and most of them are all the time out of use. We had two false fire alarsms during our stay and nobody never told why? But it was a mess in stairs. Our room was in 12th floor so not street noise and nice wiev. Although so small and the bed is just too narrow for two. The staff is neutral but the guys in concierge are just great. Thanks! For a reasonable price and great location i recommend this. But when your budget is better try other options.

The rooms are tiny and dated with little to none light but a bedside lamp ridiculous1 for two people staying in a room its to hard tomove about.The TV is very old and you can only watch 1 hour and an alarm goes off and shuts down. We ate in the restaraunt and I found hairs in my food when we told the waiters about it their response was ''how long has it been there'' nothing else was done. Without doubt the worst place I have ever stayed. A DUMP AVOID

<Title>“The perfect location to stay , if you want to shop in Oxford Street”
<Content>When I am in London, I always do some shooping in Oxford Street. I used to buy very few things because the bags were a nightmare to carry on. Now that I have disovered St Giles, I can buy as much as I want because the hotel is very near and I leave the bags there without having to carry them with me all day long and I dont spend time coming-going at the hotel ( again because it is very near). Also, the area is very close to other attraction like Madamme Tusaud etc. If you plan to have a short visit in the UK and you want a perfect location to stay, this is the one. All though, I dint like the rooms as very small and old furniture. The food also was very expensive at the hotel, so dont even bother to try it. I suggest this hotel to all persons that intend to shop in Oxford Street and also dont intend to spend time in the hotel. I have found a great deal using booking.com.

<Title>“Ideal location for the West End!”
<Content>Having stayed here in September 2009 on a weekend break in London to see a show in the West End, my mum and I were so impressed with the location and price of the hotel that we decided to stop again. With a tube stop just 2minutes away (Tottenham court road) and the majority of theaters in the West End within a 15minute walk it is the ideal location to get anywhere within London. The rooms come equipped with everything we needed, an en-suite with a shower, a kettle, adequate lighting, a comfy bed and a tv it was ideal for a busy weekend where we would only spend time sleeping in the room. At a very reasonable price, with breakfast the following morning included it was a bargain and we shall continue to stay there for our weekends away. The only two criticisms I have are the lifts seemed to be playing up whilst we were there and no one was really doing anything about it, and the hotel does have a slight smell similar to a retire home. But it was very clean.

<Content>I booked this hotel for my mum and I as we were going to watch a show. I was a little worried about it becuase of some of the reviews, but once we got there it was absolutley fine. The reception area is nice and roomy and the staff are friendly. The rooms are basic, but perfect for a few nights stay, we had tea making facilities, plenty of clean towels and the bed was comfortable. The hotel is situated in a great position, just minutes away from oxford street and a 15-20 minute walk from many of the theatres. We ate in the Marquess of Angelesey pub, near the Lyceum Theatre, which is definatly worth a visit, friendly staff and excellent food.

<Content>Everything starts when you enter... just the look is like a mass tourist hotel and you feel like you are just a number, not a client. Check in was okay (friendly and helpful), the elevator: mid 80s, slow and only 4 for a 12 story building!!! and if you are unlucky you have to change the elveator to go to the top floors (wasn't my case). At the room door, the key doesn't work... and there you have to go back down 7 stories (plus waiting for the elevator), once in the room it smelled of damp, the bed looked like an IKEA one (nothing against them, but in a hotel!!!), the bathroom was good. The room was a "prefered"... and don't want to know how the regular one looks like... All-in-all, I would never send even my worst enemy here!!

<Content>I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in October with my mother. We were both pleasently surprised, from a lot of the reviews it sounds like it is a terrible hotel, but it is ok. For the price and in this location, I think it is just fine. We stayed in a twin room, it was simple, but ok and clean. Location is ideal for restaurants and shopping, just around the corner from Tottingham Court tube station, so it is easy to travel around London. I would stay there again.

<Content>my stay at this hotel was a pleasant one, clean rooms and nice bar in hotel but do not take the breakfast if you are staying here. there was no fried eggs and no toast, the sausages looked like they had been reheated 4 or 5 times and the beans were rotten.( you have been warned, get your breakfast outside of this hotel )

<Title>“Great Location, good value for money”
<Content>I have seen some poor reviews for this hotel but for the life of me I don't know what people expect. This is a good hotel with a great location in the centre of London. OK, it is not exactly 5 star accommodation but then you don't pay 5 star prices. It could do with a refurb, and the room was quite small, but then who visits London and spends all their time in the hotel room? The buffet breakfast was good, although I would advise leaving it to after 9:15, or before 8:00 as it got quite chaotic in between. All in all I would stay here again as the location was great, the staff helpful and the room very clean. Perfect stay for visiting London and theatre land.

<Title>“Room is not good enough”
<Content>Great location but drab, drab, drab. Dismal room looking out through a slit of a window onto noisy Tottenham Court Road. If you're out all day, then OK, but it is drab and I really wouldn't want to spend a week here. Dinner in the Italian restaurant was fine and so was breakfast, but I ate early for both meals and avoided the groups. Great value for money for this part of London, but does it have to be so dark and dismal?

<Title>“Good location, modern and not too expensive...”
<Content>St Giles has a very central location, most everything you want to see as a tourist in London is within walking distance, and it´s also very close to a subway station. Rooms are small indeed, but my experience is that seems to be an issue with some London hotels that are a lot more expensive as well. Our room was clean, none of the problems reported by others here, the bed was comfortable enough and there wasn´t much noise heard from outside despite the central location. St Giles is a huge structure with many rooms and quite busy, so it can be a long walk from elevators to your room, and you may have to wait for a long time for an elevator as they are. But apart from that, this is a good hotel for this price range and location. I would stay there again, and try the swimming pool and fitness center - at additional cost though.

<Title>“Hotel Best Avoided”
<Content>Having been booked in here by business contact, I was dumfounded to find my room was small and less than clean. both beds had 'time-served matresses which threatened to engulf anyone either sitting or lying on them. Sleep was almost impossible, there was only tepid water for the shower and a dangerous, broken wire basket had been left in the shower which was a hazard if unoticed. Management have yet to repond to complaint!!

<Title>“Can't wait to come back!”
<Content>Most American tourists might not be used to European accommodations, most being smaller than U.S. hotels, but what the St Giles lacks in space they certainly make up for in service! My husband and I were treated to some of the friendliest , warm regard we've ever been. The staff of the hotel, particularly the concierge desk and Steven the night manager were as delightful and helpful as can be. WE'd like to commend the owners on keeping such gracious employees. The mezzanine staff were so friendly and delivered scones , clotted cream [ our new addiction ] and jam with smiles and conversation. The front desk was wonderfully helpful especially on the day of our departure, the concierge staff made us feel wholly welcome and by the time we had to leave felt like old friends. We'd like to thank them all for a terrific stay and say hello from " the friendly couple"! We've passed the word on to all our traveling friends. Warmly, Rebecca Parris and Paul McWilliams

<Title>“Don't ignore the Italian!”
<Content>All the reviews on the site reflect the truth of the St Giles-it's in a great location but there are some major issues lwith room size and room comfort.However having stayed there on numerous occaisions in 2010, I would suggest that anybody who finds themselves at the St Giles gives the in house Italian a try! Excellent! Great service great food and good value. Yes, it is in the same location as the bizarre 'Bus Canteen' breakfast hall-but the place is transformed on a night time! Really! Also,the pool down stairs is great! £4.00 or thereabouts to use this facility whilst you are staying at the hotel is money well spent if you are staying more than a night.

<Content>I booked this hotel for one night relating on the good reviews of this place... Well here is what I can say about it: 1) Yes, the bedroom are clean, pretty big and....well let's say that the conciergerie people are cool Now I took some pictures so you can judge by yourserlf, so I don't get too subjective but seriously if you have a few more pounds to spend (I said i you had..'cause this hotel is already pretty pricey right??!!...) go somewhere else... But please booking website, stop lying to costumers telling this is a three or four star hotel when it's just a seventies building where nothing as been changed since then..(don't get me wrong I like the seventies but when it was actually the seventies). Otherwise It's ok!

<Title>“Travelodge here we come...”
<Content>I swapped my usual budget stay at the Travelodge for what I thought was a very good "deal" on a lovely little hotel near Oxford Street for my London course this week. How wrong could I be... I was shoved in what can only be a corner wardrobe with the barest of Windows probably just for legal requirements if nothing else. The room is dirty and doesn't look like it has been dusted in a while. I would like to think it's a one off, however from what I have seen in the corridors and other communal areas me thinks not. I'm getting a little itchy even thinking about sleeping here tonight. The TV (circa 1980) is bizarrly attached to what seems like the ceiling so don't even think about trying to watch it from anywhere other then the furthest reaches of the bed. That is of course if you can work it, because giving you controls where you can read what each button is for is most definately not allowed. I think I shall be heading back for my trusty cheap, reliable, CLEAN travelodge in future.

<Title>“Location is good, but not much else”
<Content>Can't beat the location of this hotel, right in the middle of the theatre district and steps from the British Museum. But the service is something else, indeed. Housekeeping is terrible, never delivering the right number of towels, taking my washcloth and not returning it, not cleaning the bathroom floor. When I called down to get assistance with these problems (and I was polite), one desk person told me she didn't know anything about housekeeping (and didn't offer to find out or transfer me); another told me they were too busy and it took 3 hours to get the towels. There are too few lifts for the number of rooms, so waits are long and the lobby is a mob scene. Staff in the breakfast room are either surley, or zombie-like. When I asked a young woman working there where the bathrooms were, she told me there weren't any. There were, which i discovered later, right outside the breakfast room door. The room is small, which we expected, and dreary, which it wouldn't be difficult to remedy if they cared, the window is tiny, there is no air conditioning. There is no WiFi in the room, and it's expensive to pay for it in the common areas. Good lighting, though. It used to be a YMCA, so I understand there's a nice pool. All in all, it was an unpleasant experience, and next time I'll look for a nice B&B - I see highly rated ones in the area that are better priced.

<Content>Stayed in this hotel for two nights. Front desk seemed friendly, but could not attend to my complains about my aircon that was not working (three complains in total). Otherwise, good hotel and I would like to believe that what happened was an exception than the rule; I will hesitantly recommend it due to other positives it offers; such as the location, room sizes, views of London (stayed in the 13th floor).

<Title>“comfortable, but front desk not pleasant”
<Content>Contacted hotel prior to making reservation to ensure we would be able to check in early as we knew it would be a long day of travel 20+ hours. I informed them that I had have hip and back surgery and would need to rest. Upon arrival we were told that their "computers were down" and could check no one in even after I explained my situation and provided my confirmation page. Yet they were still able to check people out. They told us to check our bags with concierge and come back in an hour. Which turned into three (3) hours and magically at 1400 we were finally checked in. This delay definitely messed up our day as we were only in london for 1 1/2 days. Room was quiet and comfortable. Nice water pressure and very clean. Concierge was fantastic even during tube strike. The front desk was never personable, friendly, or helpful. Price for room was a little high when we booked it but upon arrival we were given free breakfast. Price is expected as it is London. Bar in hotel. Friendly staff nice selection of beers and wines.

<Title>“Perfect for a short visit”
<Content>It is a huge hotel with more than 700 rooms. Located very central, near to Soho and Oxford Street which is a perfect start spot for a short shopping / weekend clubbing trip to London. The reception area is prepared for servicing more guests at once, which despite the large number of guests allows the whole process of check in/out pretty to run smooth; moreover the hotel is prepared to store a large number of luggages of those guests who will be leaving London in the late afternoon hours. It isn't very luxurious or spectaculars place, be definitely recommendable because of the good price and a great localisation.

<Content>I have just returned from one night at the St Giles hotel i was very happy with the location of the Hotel as the last time i went to London i spent £50 pounds in taxi's.We came down for one night for my birthday on the 4thOct and booked a show We Will Rock You i couldnt believe that the Theatre was just round the corner.That meant we could go out shopping all afternoon then we got back in time for a meal in the Hotel we went for the Chinese that was very nice,then slowly walked round the corner for the Theatre.The breakfast was included it was a full english and more to choose from the only trouble was that the coffee in the urn had run out that was because we were late coming down for breakfast (9.30am) but the machine was working.All in all i would recommend this hotel we paid £121 pounds i think that was very good.We are Birmingham people and we got the Virgin London Euston train from New St at 11.30am and got it back on Tuesday 12.03am i booked it on the Mega Bus site for the grand total of £8.50p i think we will be doing this again VALUE FOR MONEY.I like to pass on tips to save money.

<Content>Having read the very mixed reviews on this site I wasn't sure what to expect when I arrived. Check in was very good, quick and recepionist polite. The lifts were no slower than anywhere else I've stayed. The room wasn't massive but was more than suitable, bathroom ideal very clean, good clean towels. Also on arrival in the room it was nice to sse a note saying as I'd booked an executive room this now included breakfast in the executive dining room. This breakfast was very good, with a choice of cerial, toast, pastries, fruit, full english. Located less than 5 min walk to the tube and not to bad to walk to a lot of the central London attractions.

<Content>Isn't it depressing when the bedroom at home is 100 times better than this hotel? Very disappointed, rooms are very small, reminds me of a 70's hostel, cheap, tacky MDF everywhere. To be fair, they have tried with the bathroom but the quality of the workmanship is shocking. The pedal bin in my room has multiple stab marks in it - the carpet and beds have seen better days. There is no central light in the room so they are dark and dingey - get me out of here!!

<Title>“Great for the Price”
<Content>We stayed here for I night before our flight, we thought considering the price it was good.It is only a few mins from the high street (which we did not find intimidating at all), a good Whetherspoons for food and also 24hr ASDA. The staff in the hotel were very polite and helpful. We left the car in the hotel car park for 2wks, you park your car and take the keys with you so no one moves it to an offsite compound. The bus for the airport is literally 2 mins away and runs from 03.38 till 01.28, so almost 24hrs. The bus No.is 490, and costs £2 each way.When you return through arrivals the bus stop is just out of the doors to the left, bust stop No 6, then bus No 490 back to the hotel. It is very simple and convenient. The rooms are very simple but ours was clean and had everything we needed. If you want a 4 or 5 star hotel then pay the money, you can't expect a Hilton when you have only paid for Travel Lodge.

<Title>“awful stay at st.Giles”
<Content>Arrived with 3 friends on sat evening, when checking in they told us they had double booked. We booked this hotel in April! they took 30minutes to find us suitable rooms. Eventually offered us 3 rooms on 3 different floors, which we declined. then they eventually gave us 2 double rooms on 2 separate floors, which meant we had to share beds. the room was a kitted out to suit a person with a wheelchair although very small and claustrophobic it was kept clean. the next day we were moved out to our twin rooms, which were worse again. bathroom dated, tiling grouting gray and unpleasant looking. the room was stuffy and very warm. the window could only open out a small way so no air could get in. The pillows on the bed were awful feather pillows. i felt i couldn't breath in the rooms and hated every second of being in them. the front desk personnel were very manic.

<Content>Located by Tottenham Court Road, the hotel is well placed for the Northern Line, a walk into the city sights and easy access to theatreland etc. My single room was not tiny, was well appointed,and had a most attractive, spotlessly clean shower room. For a one night stay with full breakfast, I thought the £90 cost was reasonable, as London must surely now be one of the most expensive cities in the world. The Reception staff were welcoming (and I observed how patient they were dealing with visitors of many nationalities) all with ready smiles. Good to see, as this is not always the case in many British hotels nowadays.

<Content>This hotel was sadly disappointing, despite its quite central location to the West End. The room was very small and poky, the carpet was dirty. Cooking smells were very intrusive through the open window. The towels were small and very worn. The noise at night was very disruptive from the street below (which I appreciate is not the hotel's fault). The only redeeming feature was the breakfast which was very sastisfying, although as vegetarians, there was a limit to what we could choose from the cooked breakfast. I would not stay there again.

<Title>“Perfect central hotel for shopping and going out in Soho”
<Content>The St Giles is the perfect hotel for a shopping trip to London. Close to Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Seven Dials as well as Soho, it's perfect top shop and drop everything off, and go out in Soho in the evening. Rooms are tiny, though, and not state-of-the-art, but prices are cheap for the loaction. There is supplementary breakfast, but I'd rather go out to one of the places like Pret a manger or Starbucks that are close by. The good thinhg is that you can have acccess to the YMCA gym (with pool) in the basement for one or two pounds extra.

<Title>“Distinctly Average”
<Content>This hotel is a great location for central london shopping or entertainment. However, I really wouldn't want to stay here more than one night and I certainly would not stay here for a relaxing stay! Hotel staff are welcoming and friendly but this hotel has seen better days. It's like a rabbit warren and the rooms are small even by London standards - they are also dark, noisy and hot. It was impossible to put makeup on anywhere in the room as the lighting was so awful! We stayed here as we were going out and we got back late so it was fine, but the road noise was horrendous, even 7 floors up. Also the queue for breakfast at peak times is a monster! I wasn't too impressed and would rather pay more next time for a more relaxing

<Title>“Great location but not a good deal overall”
<Content>My husband and I stayed in this hotel for four nights while moving house. We had chosen it for its excellent the location. However, everything else was utterly disappointing - in fact it was so bad that when it turned out that we would need accomodation for two more nights, we moved to a different hotel. It started when we were given a room in the 12th floor, where one cannot get to by lift from the lobby, despite the fact that we had six suitcases between us. We schlepped the suitcases to the 12th floor in a rather complex operation, taking us several trips in two different lifts. When we arrived in the room we found out that we had been given the smallest category of room they have. Not only was the hotel very noisy (we were woken up by other guests laughing and yelling in the hallway in the middle of the night on several occasions), but we were once woken up by a piece of a lamp falling down unprovoked (the person at the desk did not even offer an apology when we informed him of this). On Sunday we were woken early in the morning (half past seven) by a persistent knock on the door; it turned out to be room service who brought us a hairdrier, although we already had one. Thus, overall the hotel did not offer good value for money for us, despite the convenient location.

<Content>Stayed in room no 284 a corner room on 2nd floor. Room on the small side but the beds were comfortable and the room was very clean. However the noise from the revellers in the street went on until 2am then just as we were going to sleep a large air conditioning unit under our window down on the ground floor started, we could still hear this with the window shut. So no sleep for us. If you stay at this hotel ask for a room in the middle high up.

A particular staff was very unprofessional and rude and when I was looking to complain, the hotel info sheet guided to complain to the duty manager. Had a shock when I found out that its the duty manager who was rude to me. Never ever would stay here again. There are other good small hotels which are much more neat and professional.

It's just around the corner from Tottingham Court tube station. Outside and lobby look very nice. Rooms were just okay. Small and basic, but comfortable for one night. Good location and great transportation links!

<Title>“Not Worth the Money”
<Content>As everyone says rooms are small, TV you get 3 channels that fade in and out, bed uncomfortable, My pillow case had mold on it and the sheet had a stain on it, Rooms was very warm, had to open window to cool it down, and the was kept up all night from the noise on the streets. One pillow only nothing extra, It had room safes which was nice. Breakfast was like a round up of cattle, One lady in front of me stopped to get a bowl for cereal and was told to hurry up and keep moving by the staff, powdered eggs were available, but don't ask for anything else. Every Hotel in London is very overpriced and the rooms are crap.

<Title>“Very Small rooms”
<Content>I stayed hear on business a few times- the rooms are tiny for the single traveller- usually in a corner of a corridor. Single bed with toilet and showever room at the end of the bed- very small dressing table if you lean to your right out of bed. No air con- which in summer si unbearable and you can't leave the windows open as it is too noisy. The only consolation for me was that it was near to where I was working (and the shops) The breakfast is quirky- simple things like not haveing toast??? Although I have to say I did find the crockery clean and there is plenty of it. I ate in the italian a few times- it was ok- ususally went for the specials. In summary if you want somewhere near to tube and oxford street- not bad (if you are not going to spend a lot of time in your room) - No room service either!

<Title>“Coming up to our 5th stay”
<Content>We've stayed here 4 times in the last few years on weekend trips to london and we love it. Yes the rooms are small but it is in the centre of london!! And the rooms are clean and tidy. Last time we paid only a little extra and had an executive room. These are much bigger and have floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city. We also had a great executive breakfast in the quieter restaurant. The usual breakfast is still good but in a large crowded canteen style area. We're off to London again next month and we'll be staying at the st giles again.

<Title>“Great Location, Good Hotel, Would Stay Again!!”
<Content>Having read some of the reviews I was unsure whether to book this hotel or not but for the price that was given I decided to go ahead thinking it would only be for two nights even it was really bad. However, I am glad I booked this hotel...The location is great close to all attractions and the tube station is only about 2 mins away from the hotel! The hotel itself was fine for what was required - a bed for the night and a place to leave our things! The rooms are small but how much time do u spend in them when in London, so this was not a problem and they were clean which is the main thing! We were on the eighth floor so would have preferred to take the lift but on a couple of occassions we did take the stairs as the lifts seemed to be taking sometime to arrive but this was not a big problem for us! Breakfast was not the best have ever had but it was warm and it was filling enough! We went down around 9 - 9 30 for the two mornings we stayed and did not have a problem getting a seat. The staff we encounted were all very friendly and helpful. Overall there may be a few areas for improvements mainly the lifts but I would stay here again without hesistation!!!

<Title>“Nice location...but not much more to say about the hotel”
<Content>We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in the smallest hotel room we have EVER stayed in - there was nowhere to put our suitcase so we had to step over it all the time. The bedroom had what they described as a Queen sized bed, but it was more like a slightly large single bed, and it was as soft as a hammock. There was just a sheet as a cover and a heavily stained bedspread that I suppose you would have to use on winter days if it was clean...yuk! The towels we had every single day looked like they had been through a shredder and were grey, not white as they probably once were. The breakfast is a circus...so don't go too late at weekends, and go early during the week or you will find yourself in a stampede to get a table. The chairs in the breakfast room were so disgustingly dirty - why use chairs with soft seat that can't be removed and washed?? Very odd. The staff in Reception were not very friendly at all, but the Concierge lads were always extremely helpful and friendly. Oh, and if you are in a hurry press for the lift at least 30 minutes before you need it - the 4 lifts have got to be the slowest we have ever come across. Waited 20 minutes one morning!! Not joking. This was my/our first stay at The St. Giles and it will must certainly be the last. The hotel needs a good clean and total renovation. But if it is location you are after, then I guess it is in the right spot for that at least.

<Title>“Cheap and cheerful. Some say you get what...”
<Content>Cheap and cheerful. Some say you get what you pay for and this hotel fits that category. You won't pay too much but you shouldn't expect too much. The rooms are small but they are clean. The housekeeping staff seemed determined to wake you as early as possible. Lots of noise in the corridor in the morning. The breakfast was OK, again not first class but sufficient. Good location for getting around London. Nice bar area and friendly staff. Not too bad but wouldn't be the 1st choice for my next visit.

<Title>“OK Hotel in Great Location”
<Content>We stayed at St Giles for 4 nights, our room was small, dark and stuffy, however it was very clean and perfectly adequate for what we needed. Sleep was fine, double glazing meant very quiet, however no air-con meant it was a bit stuffy, even though cold outside we slept with no covers, bathroom recently done up, cheaply, but very clean. Great location for meeting friends and exploring, was good value for the price (I imagine)

<Title>“excellent location”
<Content>Just returned from a 5 night break at the St Giles. Reception staff helpful and efficient. We had a double room which was a little small but had a wardrobe, fan and tea/coffee facilities. The room was quite dark even with lights on and blinds open. Bathroom was small and quite dated but it was clean enough. The bathrooms seem to all have old 'on the wall' hairdriers. They do work well but become hot quite quickly so need to take care when using on young children as they can burn! No real bad points for the hotel apart from it really needs to be updated. There was tape across sections of the carpets that were threadbare, towels are looking a bit over used, artex walls and dated looking bedding could do with an overhaul. There are lifts to the rooms, but for over 700 rooms there are not enough and constantly queued for lifts at all times of the day. The big plus for the hotel is it's location, literally 2 mins walk from Oxford Street and very close to Tottenham Court tube station. Seen reports about queues for breakfast but we did not experience any problems, would be nice to have option of toast but enough choice to fill you. Would stay here again and would recommend for the location, not the rooms

<Title>“Enjoy Queuing? This could be your heaven”
<Content>Do you enjoy queuing? Then come here for breakfast any morning and you can savour your heaven; even better come on a Saturday and you will have to queue just to get into the dining area before joining an even longer queue to get your food. 720 bedrooms in this hotel; the catering facilities are just not up to that volume. "OK Apart from that, Mrs Lincoln, how was the play" There are many plus points. Most of the staff are good, some very good. Our receptionist was genuinely welcoming and took an interest in what we were planning. Brief encounters with others were also good. Even the chambermaids gave you a cheerful “Good Morning” whenever they saw you – possibly their only words of English but it was impressive. OK occasionally you meet ex-Qantas cabin crew but these are the exception. The standard rooms are compact, no way can two people move around at the same time but the bed was comfortable, the room clean and an obvious effort has been made to keeping everything fresh, carpets clean, paintwork regularly repainted – all very spic and span, If you do stay here the sports facility are good, a superb swimming pool awaits you and an array of equipment for the really keen. Something to do while you wait for breakfast.

<Title>“Value for money”
<Content>We recently spent a weekend in London and stayed here. Don't expect to much, but the hotel is good value for money. The rooms are OK and very clean. And the location is fantastic. In the centre of London and near the subway. The breakfast: plenty of food and choices. However the area is to small for the amount of guests. So long lines and crowdy tables. The service is not so good. The cereal was overdate, we told the management, but the next day nothing was changed and the overdate cereal was still there. Another problem is the elevator. For the amount of guests the elevators are to slow/ not many enough. We stayed on the sixth floor and took the stairs all the time, since the elevators were packed when they arrived on the 6th floor (the hotel has 12 floors). For us not a problem, but when your not as mobile it could be a problem. All in all, good value for money: clean and great location, but don't expect to much.

<Title>“Really convenient hotel, minutes from Tottenham Court Road station and easy walking distances of west end.”
<Content>Rooms OK - very clean. You are in the centre of London so some noise is inevitable. Very busy hotel. Breakfast - plenty of food and choices. However, no toast was available nor facilities to make your own. One word of caution - rooms are very dark now that energy saving bulbs are used. Impossible to see to put on make-up. Next time (and there will be a next time!!) I'm thinking of taking a torch with me so that I can shine it in the appropriate place. Fitness centre available for a small fee as it belonged ot the YMCA next door.

<Title>“not bad but could be great”
<Content>less than a minutes walk from the tube st. giles in in a brilliant location. reception staff friendly and even though we were early our room was ready so we could make use of it straight away. we wre on level 4 and as reported there is sometimes quite a wait for the lifts . the room was small but fine for me and my son . beds fine , wardrobe space ok, small tv with 5 channels, as no a/c a small fan was provided. bathroom was small and could do with either a really good scrubbing or a revamp . bedding and towels were clean and replaced daily. breakfast time was the biggest letdown and for us a bit of a waste of money as the food was not good , most of it cold including the strange scrambled eggs and bacon. there was only rolls or croissants and no toast, sorry i just love my toast at breakfast . my main concern with the breakfast is how unorganised and manic the dining room is . no queing system and blind corners making carrying hot drinks or milk for the cereals a little bit of a task. there are some good restaurants nearby so i would choose the room only option next time . yes i would return as the location is just ideal and i found the staff lovely and attentive making my 13 year old sons first trip to london memerable.

<Title>“Perfect Location”
<Content>I read the reviews before I booked and wasn't expecting much so was pleasantly surprised. The location was perfect for me - almost on the corner of Oxford St and Tottencourt Road. The room was small but for a one person was adequate had everything I needed. No it's not quiet - but if I'd wanted quiet I would have gone to the Cotswolds!! I opened the window and soaked up all that noise and atmosphere!! The concierge and staff were helpful and friendly and apart from the lifts which were extremely slow, I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Can't beat the location!”
<Content>We chose this place because the price was good value for a centrally located hotel; just a few blocks from the British Museum, 10-15 minute walk from Leicester Square and one block away from theTottenham Court Road tube station. Ours was a twin standard room with a tight, small bathroom (a few hooks in there would be helpful). Room needed updating, harsh overhead lighting, shabby carpeting, however, it was clean and the beds comfortable. There was a very substantial storage area, safe, and coffee/tea maker but no clock. Ice maker was on the lobby floor and non-functional for the week we were there - had to go into the bar for ice. Reception staff not particularly friendly or helpful, concierge we spoke with didn't seem to know much about public transportation. WiFi available only in lounge at the cost of 20 pounds for a week! We found free WiFi at the Pret-A-Manger on Oxford Street, a few blocks away - they make great cappuccino so we had our morning coffee there. Caffe Nero also makes great espresso drinks (and yummy pastries/baked goods). If all you want is a clean and convenient place to sleep, this place is a good deal price-wise!

<Title>“Simply the worst - don't go there!”
<Content>Location of the hotel is excellent for theatre and shops the front of the hotel looks quite impressive however it's seriously downhill from there. Room was so tiny we couldn't find anywhere but the bed to open the suitcase. The ensuite was tiny, very dark and dingy with a disgusting shower curtain that had mildew mold on it. The towels were disgusting - they had a terrible smell - could not have been clean. Reception staff were indifferent and clearly couldn't care less about us - I assume they must hear the same complaints all day every day! We had booked 3 nights but left at 8am on day two, I could not have stayed another minute and couldn't wait to get out. We paid £125 per night booked through booking.com - wouldn't have paid £1.25. Do yourselves a favour and go ANYWHERE ELSE!

<Title>“Value for money, some people expect 5* quality for 2* prices!”
<Content>Although we were initially told we couldn't check in until 2pm, our room was ready at 1pm. True, the rooms are quite small but when you go to London you aren't living in the room, it's just a place to sleep. The room was spotlessly clean - no sign of mould or damp in the shower room. Complimentary soaps, shampoo and shower gel. Kettle with tea and coffee. Extra pillows available in the wardrobe. The window didn't open too far but if you were creative with positioning the TV, this did allow air in, although with the hotel being on Tottenham Court Road, it is a fairly noisy location. The electric fan in the room was very welcome, as there was no air-con. Could only get a decent picture on one channel (Channel 5), but this was not a problem, as we weren't there to watch TV - can do this at home at any time of the week! Often a bit of a wait for the lifts, but this wasn't helped by able-bodied people using it to travel one floor ..... I see there are lots of complaints about the breakfast - can I say I have been in much worse hotels in London. There are a variety of breakfast cereals, fruits, cheeses, meat, bacon, sausage and fresh bread buns, so you won't starve. Check out very easy, just leave the key in the perspex box at reception. The concierge was very helpful when I wanted to leave my case in the hotel for a few hours after check in. I would use this hotel again.

<Title>“Disgusted! Seriously, do not use if you are in London for business!”
<Content>I was allocated this hotel through my business' corporate policy, needless to say there is a strong email to them today. The first room I was given was so small and dated; I could touch all the walls at the same time and there was a noise outside of the window similar to the sound made by ventilation drone., i realy thought they had given me an unused room by mistake. The second room I was given was also tiny and dated and not much better. It was humid but I couldn’t open the window due to the noise all night! The toilet was dirty and stained; the shower cubic was the smallest I have ever seen and the grouting was mouldy. The bath towel they provided was so old and worn that there was a hole in the middle. The Safe in the room had obviously not worked for some years and the reception on the small portable TV was terrible other than on one channel (only 5 channels anyway). What little sleep I did get was disturbed by the banging of doors during the night (probably due to the hen party I saw waiting for the lift). There was no iron in the room, not a huge problem but there was an 'ironing room' signposted near the lifts – I found a room with nothing in it! The hair drier which was in the bathroom was so old I thought it was gasping its last breath! Breakfast was another unique experience; I had to wait 10 mins to get into the ‘dining room’ only to find out is was self service cafeteria style. The food was disgusting, the ‘hot’ selection was warm baked beans, reconstituted scrambled eggs (don’t dare they say they weren’t!), bacon swimming in fat and dried up sausages which were very obviously the cheapest brand available. The best for me was the dirty mugs provided at the coffee/tea vending machines, there wasn’t one clean mug which was difficult to see anyway as they were black mugs – obviously black was deliberately chosen to hide the dirt! I asked for a clean cup and was offered a plastic vending mug – at least I could see it was clean. Check out was not much better. Having to walk down from the 6th floor as the lifts were that long coming and when arrived were all full, I had to walk down several service passages to get to reception where the young man on reception seemed to think I was an inconvenience as I wanted to checkout, I could do without arrogant staff. Please don’t believe the pictures on the website as they are not the rooms you will get. This is a very cheap hotel not concerned with ensuring people want to come back for repeat visits.

<Title>“Not the greatest but what do you expect?”
<Content>We stayed one night (a Saturday) to see a play in the West End, and were told by the person who booked it was a 3-4 star hotel, which it's not. TripAdvisor shows it as a 3 star and this is pushing it. A 2 star rating is fair as the amenities, though reasonable, do not provide a 3 star experience. If you want privacy this is not the place, if it's intimacy your after then fill your boots because the place is so tight everyone is literally falling over each other!!! With over 700 rooms there are up to 1500 guests when it's full in a space on bigger than your average supermarket. Breakfast in the 'cafeteria' was comical... simply not enough staff or tables to cope; tip of the day..on a Saturday or Sunday go to breakfast either early or late, but not between 09:00 and 10:00. The standard double rooms are OK but again very small with no aircon. There was a table-top fan, but this could not cool the 'cooker' we tried to sleep in. For the same or less money I'd rather stay slightly out of town in a Premier Inn where I can at least stretch without touching the walls! I feel I must mention that the staff were great and hats off to them for keeping smiles on their faces when it seemed the majority of Europe had just marched through their doors. Summary - OK but not my choice.

<Title>“If you like queueing, this is for you -otherwise, forget it”
<Content>Queue for reception, lifts, concierge, breakfast, no organisation - pretty awful actually. We aren't talking short, fast queues here - these are seriously competitive ones!! Hotel needs to get it's act together and sort this out. Concierge - smart and is a good representative, shame about the rest. Forget breakfast unless you enjoy rugby scrums. Room 536 is tiny, ok, that's acceptable as you aren't spending your day there, but there's no aircon and it's stifling because the window has restricted opening - probably as they don't want you to hurl yourself on to the noisy air conditioning unit below (yes, there is one- but where does it get used?). It's on a very noisy street too, 3am bin bashing and singing outside - yippee!! Forget watching tv as it doesn't work and hurry with your shower in the tiniest one in the world - unless you are into mould. Sorry guys - never again.

<Title>“I would stay again....honest review”
<Content>I was initially wary after reading some reviews, however I would definitely stay again. I stayed with my husband for 2 nights. The location is fantastic. The rooms are small and basic, but they are clean and have everything you need when visiting London. At the end of the day you don't go to London to relax in your hotel room. You go to sight-see and enjoy the nightlife. The reception area and bar area are really nice. If you get the breakfast included I would take it but there are plenty of nicer places nearby. The breakfast room is VERY busy, but the food was nice and there was plenty to choose from. We only ate one morning in the hotel. The hotel is very reasonable for its location in London and you get what you pay for. You don't pay the price of a 5 star hotel in London so don't expect 5 star quality. If you want luxury don't go to St Giles but I would have no hesitation in booking here again. Lots of bars and restaurants nearby and tube station is just round the corner.

<Title>“basic hotel, terrible customer service”
<Content>Booked this hotel for my parents as a birthday weekend gift, wanted to pay in full but the hotel would only let me confirm booking with my card and pay on departure. My parents stayed 2 nights, a basic hotel but central to Oxford Street and Theatres so no complaints about location. On departure they paid in full with their card. 5 days later the money was also taken from my account so we paid double, this was 2 months ago and still fighting to get my money back. I would not recommend confirming your booking with a different card, they are happy to take your money but don't want to give it back. Won't be booking there again.

<Content>This is the 4th time we've stayed at this hotel and have booked another stay. As I'm a wheelchair user we have to use the wheelchair adapted room (which is now on the 2nd floor). With it we get the executive breakfast on the ground floor so don't have to use the staff lift. The room is better than the other disabled room, the bathroom is bigger, it's easier to get in the door and was very clean. The staff as always were very friendly and helpful especially the concierge's. The outside concierge always got us taxi's and helped me into them and one of the night time concierge's even ordered us a pizza to our room.

<Title>“Beware... tourists and business travelers”
<Content>The location of the hotel was very good - close to the tube, British Museum and short walk to shopping. However the hotel itself needs to be seriously updated. The room itself was disappointing. BIG NOTE: the rooms only have dial up - there is no wifi. This was a huge issue for me as I was in town for business and since my company doesn't use dial up, I was unable to use my computer in my room. The only other way to get internet access was to use a common computer down in the lobby which will cost you £1 (one pound) for every 20 minutes. Upon opening up the door to the room, the smell of body odor which emulated was over-powering. As there is no air conditioning in the rooms, so I had to turn on the small, two speed fan and open the window which opens about a quarter of the way. The next thing you notice is the size of the room - which is very small - which was not ideal but I could be fine in it. I had to turn my suitcase sideways to get in the door. The closet was not tall so the longest thing that you can hang in them is a suite jacket. The room had a small tv (fine) which received 5 channels but only one that was not all static and the remote had no back cover so the batteries kept falling out. The walls are also quite thin so you can hear your neighbors. I also did a test and found out that the staff does not change the sheets at all on the beds during your stay. You have to request that. There was a small desk which if you pulled the chair out hit the bed. Even their welcome package which they leave in the room was not helpful. None of the topics related to pages and I am not sure when the last time was that it had been updated. For the fitness center and pool, they are not actually in the hotel - instead located at the YMCA which is underneath the hotel. You also have to pay additional to use the facilities and you need to fill out paperwork and the manager needs to approve your usage of the facilities. Also make sure you are aware of the check-out times - which is 11am. I was up early on my last day on my way out for breakfast at 9am and the cleaning person tried to come in my room. When I told her yes I was indeed checking out today but was just going to get some breakfast she informed me that I was late and that I needed to leave. I had to show her the welcome book to prove that check-out wasn't till 11am. I wish I could have written a better review. I know that the hotel has the potential to be really good, just hoping that someone else at the hotel sees this too.

<Title>“Brilliant”
<Content>Arrived early and was greeted at reception and even managed to check in there and then! Room wasn't huge but well furnished clean and tidy. Breakfast selection in the morning was fantastic, plenty of seating and plenty of foods to choose from. Coffee bar was a bonus and nice for a treat. Concierge desk and staff were brilliant next day looking after baggage whilst we went out again for the day. Two minutes from the Dominion Theatre, fantastically situated for getting around, tube 1 minute around corner. Tesco just across the street for emergency rations! Shops ten minutes down the road!! Vending machines on each floor selling cold drinks and beer - clever idea! Only down side, which is nothing really is it was a hot weekend and the room was hot and the lifts were none to quick. But other than than, brilliant hotel, would use again even if seeing another show across town! Oh the bar was good too, we sat out for a while as it was so hot but later came inside, very comfy.

<Title>“Average hotel”
<Content>We booked a deluxe double as we wanted an air-con room as it's summer. We were grateful for the air-con as it's pretty hot when we arrived, although we'd prefer that the air-con is stronger. Hated the towels as they're old and smelly! Bathroom was small and shower area just nice for me who is petite. Will be cramp for taller and bigger size guests. Room safe looked so old we didn't want to use, no instructions how to use as well. My room phone is not working too! Hotel and room seemed aged and I think they needed renovation. Lift was extremely slow and there's always many guests waiting in the lobby. Had to pay for internet access. Average service staff. Location was pretty ok, 3 mins walk to the tube quite accessible and 10 mins walk to British museum. Vicinity felt safe, not too noisy as the hotel was located at the side street.

<Title>“tired hotel with pokey hot room”
<Content>We stayed here for one night which was enough. First impressions were unhelpful concierges watching guests struggle with heavy luggage up stairs to reception as they laughed and chatted amongst themselves. Reception has constant queues(allow plenty of time!) corridor carpets poor. Our room was in a rabbit warren of corridors (probably confusing in event of an incident) and the room we got was small and had cobwebs above the bed but was quite literally a sauna with no air conditioning. Small window made for an oppressive atmosphere. Yes we like others chose it for its location which is its ONLY good point. Also read the small print on the health facilities (its £4.50 extra to use them and you need a "breakfast ticket" too...presumeably you dont use if no breakfast is paid for? I didnt ask as when I saw the reception area for the health suite it put me right off going in... and looked 3rd world! Would opt for a Travelodge or similar budget type hotel chain anyday of the week over this hotel. Would not return. To be fair we stayed out of town (Docklands) the night before and were treated to luxury at the same price...I'd opt for out of town again albeit a short tube ride. better value for money.

<Title>“Great Place to stay ...”
<Content>The St Giles hotel is in an excellent location, very close to Covent Garden so ideal for anyone doing a show. Yes the rooms are small but I would say the majority of people visiting London are just looking for a base . Our room was clean and comfortable. Breakfast is a bit 'canteeny', but the food was piping hot something which most 5 star hotels can't manage ! The concierge in the hotel was very informative and gave us an invaluable map ! Another reccommendation for anyone thinking of it we went to see Dirty Dancing which was fabulous . So all those considering the St Giles get yourselves booked in we all had 'the time of our lives' !

<Title>“I would never stay there again!”
<Content>OMG!!!! I have stayed in some places but this hotel I would never recommend to anyone. On booking into the hotel they messed up our booking and gave my friend and I a double bed instead of two singles, the reception staff refused to change our booking as they claimed the hotel was full and didnt have any other rooms available, and even refused to hunt out availability in other nearby hotels to accomodate our requirements. After a row at reception we decided that because it was one night we would top n tail. The hotel had rubbish in the corridors and dirty laundry in huge heaps sporadically placed these were there throughout our whole stay..The pictures on the website are not what you get, the rooms are dated and need a chuffin good clean by proffesionals, the rooms are small and basic, and the windows only open 8 inches.....as for the air con......its a fan sat on a shelf and the blades are thick with muck and dust. The hairdryers are a throw back from the sixties and looked dodgy, I brought my own TG which was just as well. The breakfast buffett was the only thing the hotel had going for it, there was plenty of variety and was cooked fresh, no gripes there. The hotel lifts are alot to be desired for, please dont be in a rush to get to your room or if your late going out somewhere then my advise to you would be to use the stairs, and if your leaving your luggage at the hotel on your last day while you do last minute shopping before going home...be prepared to part with a pound as its not in with the price you originally paid, for your stay at this hotel......... Overall view.....breakfast ok, hotel not!

<Title>“Great Location, would stay here again”
<Content>Great location and value for a London hotel. Clean and comfortable, and by London standards, not horribly cramped (note: All moderate to cheaper priced London hotel rooms are small). Very convenient for theatre, British Museum, Tube at Tottenham Ct. Allow time for the elevators during heavy use periods. As with many London hotels, no AC, so on warm summer days need to open windows for fresh air, but also noise. Good double glazed windows, so didn't have problems with noise when closed.

<Title>“Smallest hotel room in London”
<Content>I know that hotel rooms in London can be compact, but this must have been the smallest single room in London. I could stand in the middle of the room and touch all four walls! The ensuite bathroom was very tight for space, but the room, whilst a little tired, was clean. This hotel can be reasonably priced for London, but it comes at a cost (which is still pricey) of low level service and feeling more like student halls than a hotel. The breakfast was served in a large canteen type room - the food and choice was basic, but there was a good quantity. The hotel has a considerable number of rooms - and as such at busy times the lifts are just too infrequent/cramped, so if you find it difficult to manage stairs then ask for a lower level room.

<Content>Great location and close to the subway station (Tottenham Ct Road). Only a small walk away is Oxford street, Soho and a lot of restaurants. We had a deluxe room, clean and big enough. The bathroom is comfortable. We had a room close to the street - It was a little bit noisy at night. But the location is perfect for our weekend trips - therefore we will come back.

<Title>“Dont waste the money !”
<Content>Where do I start ? After getting a half price deal we thought for £190 a night the hotel must be ok, god how we were wrong. We started off waiting for about 10 minutes to get checked in - plenty of staff standing around doing nothing whilst we waited. After eventually getting our keys we then had to get in the lift which was filthy - not the best start. We eventually found our room, however, we soon wished we hadnt. The room itself was tiny and smelled of smoke. We booked a double bed which was only slightly bigger than a standard single bed. The room had no main light switch leaving the only lights to be bedside lamps (ikeas cheapest and finest !) which had as much light as lighting a matchstick. The 20 year old TV was on the top shelf and boasted 5 fabulous channels (luckily we were tall enough to reach it to put it on !!). I have to admit it was a warm day in London, so we were pleased to see a switch which had a little fan above it, again we wish we hadnt. The air con was pathetic, no air conditioning just a mass of noise (to be honest a double deckrd bus could have been stood next to us with the engine running and it would have been quieter!). The bathroom was cheap and nasty and to top it off no extractor fan, therefore making the room even hotter after we had been in the shower. The hairdryer was at least 50 years old and cut out in seconds of it being on. The towels were hard and the 'bath towels' were no bigger than a standard hand towel, which also reflected in the pillows where we were each provided with one pillow which was slightly bigger than a cushion and no-where near the size of a normal pillow. Overall, would I stay here again - not on your nelly. The only plus point in the hotel was the bar - but no amount of alcohol could prepare you for a night in hell, and thats what it was !!

<Title>“Nothing to get excited about !!”
<Content>We arriived at the hotel too early for check in (our fault) and were told to come back at 3pm as the room wasn't ready. We left our bags at the hotel and went for lunch. When we arrived back at approx 3.10pm the room was still not ready and we were asked to wait in the hotel lounge for a few minutes. After about 20 mins we were told our room was ready and checked in. The room was extremely small (put me in mind of a caravan for available space) but it was clean. We had asked for a twin room but had 1 double bed in one small room then a single bed in another which pulled down from inside the wardrobe. The TV was a small old portable with a very poor picture that was barely watchable in the double room. it couldn't be watched from the other bed as it was in a different room. After going out sightseeing for a few hours we arrived back at the hotel at the same time as an American coach party checking in. Trying to get a lift up to our floor at this time was very annoying and we had to wait for a long time as the lifts struggled to cope with the people and luggage. The next morning at approx 8am we were awoken by the fire alarm and had to run down 8 flights by the fire escape. After waiting for 10 mins outside we were told to go back in as it was a false alarm and it had done the same thing the day before. The bathroom was extremely small (again caravan came to mind) and although the bathroom door was frosted it didn't provide much privacy. Their was a long line for breakfast but it did go down quite quickly. Once inside the breakfast room the tables felt crammed in but there was a good selection of food. The position of the hotel made it very easy to get around, either walking or on the tube, with a stop almost straight outside the hotel. Overall it was nothing special and if I stayed again it wouldn't be for more than one night. In fact I am thinking of going to London next year but I am looking at other hotels so I suppose this means I wouldn't stay again.

<Title>“A great Weekend!!!”
<Content>When arriving quite late in the afternoon in from Dublin quite frankly you step into a factory processing unit the front desk visible by the clean white ceiling and chandeliers looming with front desk clerks rapidly move on checking in one guest to another outside the weather boasting summer’s perfection. The reception and lift queue were slow and upsetting what looked like a whole bunch of youngsters from overseas.. Anyhow we checked in to our rooms as booked in under same name as it was our niece’s wedding. The rooms were pre-allocated we were told, as two clerks dealt with us pleasantly...the rooms are small and needed an inspiration (why not go for the theme of their New York partners which the website shows as we wondered later or more like the room our niece was in the Executive they said more modern)...well we left our luggage’s and headed into the atmosphere of the warm bar, mind you the drinks are mainly expensive but service was delightful & rested to watch the world cup games and go about our Hen Party.. Mind you a lot of Norwegian ad Swedish people tend to outdo others in conversation. We ladies decided to head out in to the City in the evening and make it a good night, more thanks to the Concierge and what looked like change of reception staff whom work wonders we felt clearly more welcomed by the friendly and jolly late evening staff who must have experience dealing with mad people all over the place late into the night. They recommended several sights and things to do which we took upon before returning back in late and although the problem with my sisters husband stepping out of bed and wondering the reception in the early hours of the morning was a setback and funny moment for us. I my sister felt very pleased by the young & caring lad who returned him back to the room. Our niece now married we feel we enjoyed a great weekend away from home. We will look upon these as great moments and will be back again for more good nights!!

<Title>“Very poor Hotel”
<Content>We have stayed here five times before and there has been no improvement in the standard of the rooms considering that "renovations" have been taking place. The bedrooms are small, carpets are filthy and smelly, the sink was blocked, the toilet handle loose. The furniture in the room is old rubbish and the beds the same. the first room we had was a joke, it was like someones atic with drawers piled on the bed. Our second room was as described. very expensive to eat there, and we complained to the Manager who halved our bill. We won't stay there again. KEEP AWAY!!!

<Title>“Great Location - Shame about the rest!”
<Content>The hotel is the perfect location for what we had planned for the week. The cost for a central london hotel was very good. after staying there for 4 nights you understand why its very cheap. On arrival we were welcomed by a grumpy receptionist who barely looked at us let alone smiled!!! we were not explained any facilities available at the hotel. just our room number and that the lifts were over there. The room we booked 'exec double' was ok. very very basic. for a double room there was only one bedside table. the pillows were very uncomfortable but mattress was good. The lifts are a nightmare if you catch it at the wrong time, they are very small, apparently you can fit 12 people in. i wouldn't want to be in the lift with that many. you can be stood waiting for ages and 7 floors is a long way to walk i think there are further 5 though! There was a letter to state that as an executive customer we could have breakfast, this was very good. the 2 girls who served us were very pleasant and looked after all customers at breakfast very well. this was the best thing about the hotel (apart from location). The 'FRESH?!! Towels' smelt very fusty. the had obvisously not dried properly before being folded up in laundry. when we booked this hotel we noticed very mixed reviews about it but thought we would give it a go. i would possibly stay again only because of location and cost of room. dont go if you are expecting good customer service i have stayed in better youth hostels in the past.

<Content>Liudmyla T., Kiev, Ukraine I stayed at St. Giles for 7 nights on my vacation trip to London, chose it for its close location to the British Museum. What I definitely liked about the hotel is its cleanliness and staff efficiency. Though the rooms are two small and somewhat dated, the bathroom is comfortable. It was a little noisy at night but I could get quite a good sleep. The food at breakfast is very poor and resembles a school canteen, would recommend Starbucks cafe just round the corner. I visited Dominion theatre (two steps from the hotel) to see the musical "We will rock you" - highly recommend. On the whole the hotel is more than average and I would stay at it again if travelling alone, its too little space in the rooms to stay together with a partner.

Plenty of choice & very good quality. Excellent location for Theatres & Covent Garden. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a good value hotel in Central London. It may not be the Ritz, but perfectly acceptable for that long weekend theatre or sightseeing break!

<Title>“terrible but good location”
<Content>we had two standard rooms. one room with 2 single beds and one room with a double bed. the room with a double bed was a lot smaller than the one with 2 double bed. the room smelt musky, and there was no air conditioning. the colour tv was placed in front of the window. so when the window was open, the colour tv was almost falling off the tv rack. the toilet is small, and the shower area was worse. i could not even turn when i was showering. my height is 158 cm and weighing about 40 kg. when the shower curtain is being drawn, there wasn't any light coming through to the shower area. the bed was worn out, didn't have much sleep due to that. not to mention that the room was so small that we resorted to putting the bags on the bed, in order to pack our luggage. much being said, location is fabulous. other than that, breakfast was horrid in the hotel. I felt like a refugee, picking up breads from the bread dispenser. the breakfast at the hotel was more like mass production rather than quality and cleanliness.

<Title>“perfect for shopping”
<Content>St Giles couldnt be situated in a better spot that it is. Oxford street is literally round the corner. More centre than that. Other important and major attractions are one or two stops with the underground, or even a 15 minute walk could take you to the Trocadero, soho etc. The hotel is very clean, offering you a very good cooked breakfast. However, one downside is that a double room is very very small. So if you are looking for a relaxing room forget it..otherwise staff was very helpful..

<Title>“Fantastic - dont listen to bad reviews!!!!”
<Content>I booked this hotel about 3 months before actually going to London, and then read some awful reviews and was a bit apprehensive - £292 for 3 nights is quite a lot to pay for a bad hotel! Anyway, when we got there we couldnt believe how lucky we were to have paid so little for such a great location! The tube is literally a two second walk from the front door, the Dominian Theatre is about 3 doors down which is great if youre going to see We Will Rock You (which we were). Oxford Street is literally across the road which is where you want to be if youre hitting the shops! Leicester Square and Soho are about a ten minute walk or a tube ride if youre feeling lazy! Basically the hotel was bang in the middle of everything! It was fantastic! When we got to the hotel the lady on reception was very helpful, everything was lovely and clean and we paid and got our keys in a matter of minutes. We stayed on the 1st floor which is still quite a trek on the stairs so we used the lifts (which were fine!). Our room was quite a small one but definitely big enough for the two of us! We had a nice big (and EXTREMELY comfortable!) bed, bedside units with lamps, we had an all in one dresser, wardrobe and shelving units which was absolutely fine - electric heater was provided in case it got cold, which it didnt - it was quite warm. We had windows that part opened and air con - the air con was actually really noisy but at least it was there. People complaining about the noise absolutely baffles me - its in the CENTRE OF LONDON - of course it's going to be noisy! That's the charm of London. Saying that, it wasnt so noisy you couldnt sleep?! It was general hustle and bustle, some sirens etc. Hardly worth complaining about at all. The only thing we found noisy in our room was next doors air con - again, it wasnt loud enough to stop me sleeping and im the lightest sleeper ever! The bathroom was just lovely - very modern, very very clean and really swanky!! The shower was heavenly, we had fresh towels every day if we wanted, fresh toileteries every day. The thing i have to emphasise is how CLEAN the room and bathroom were! For breakfast we had the coffee 2 go option which was fantastic. You got a choice of pastries, a choice of fruit and hot and cold drinks (you get one of each) which was great for us because we spent quite a lot of money on lunch and teas and we didnt really want a lot for breakie - just wanted to get out and about! They also have pay as you go internet access which we actually found really useful as we needed to look for places to go and find where all the Samuel Smiths pubs were!! I have to say, as i have never been to London before this trip, the drinks were so expensive. At most pubs it cost us about £9 for two pints. Sam Smiths pubs are all over London so we went on a little pub crawl between them all - for 2 pints at a Sam Smiths pub is about £5 which is a lot better than £9 on a night out! All in all, we had a great experience with the hotel, a great experience with the location and we will DEFINITELY be going back again. The price of the hotel is an absolute bargain for what you get and where you are - we saw more expensive hotels further away from the centre and they didnt look too hot. Keep this in mind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>“Fantastic location!”
<Content>We were a group 24 on a theatre break trip. The location of the hotel was absolutely fantastic. The hotel itself is fairly basic but has everything you need. The staff were very friendly, although check in could have run smoother. I was given a box for group reservations with everyones name and keys in, which would have been fine but the names had not been sorted out into the right rooms so I had to do this in the middle of reception! However I think this may have been the travel agents fault and not the hotels. Breakfast was suprisingly good, its set up like a students union, but I've had far worse breakfasts at much more expensive hotels. For groups in particualr this is a good hotel.

<Title>“+ Location, - Standard”
<Content>Location ++++ : The hotel has a perfect location, just a five minute walk to Tottenham Court Road Underground, and also a five minute walk to Oxford Street. A pharmacist is located across the street, also selling beatu- and helthproducts with reasonable prices. Facilities ++ : In the lobby you can find an informationdesk where you can get all sorts of help regarding your London-stay A tip: Don´t take the "Original bus tour". It costs 25 punds each and you don´t have the time to get value for your money in the 24h time limit. It´s easier to take the underground train, where you can do what you want and in your own pace. It´s also much cheeper, a maximum of 4.50 per day if you buy an OysterCard. The hotel includes a spa, wich we unfortunatly didn´t have time to explore. A Thai restaurant is located on ground floor with good Thai food. Ground floor also has a pub. Internet is avalible on four PC´s and costs 1 pund for 20 mins. Breakfast (Coffee2go) - : Includes one cup of coffee/the, one piece of bread and one fruit. You are not guaranteed to get a place to sit. Was looking forward to the typical egg and bacon-breakfast, but was really disapointed. Rooms (we stayed in room 488) + : Feels like a trip back to the 70´s. Really shaggy and without any luxury at all. Two single beds (comfy though) put together and the bathroom contained a small showercabin, a small sink and a WC. Windows towards the street let a lot of noice in, so we slept with earplugs. Summary: We think we did a good hotel choice considering what location we got for the money we spent. But if you would like to feel a bit of luxury in a modern hotel, I suggest you add up a couple of punds and chose another hotel.

<Title>“Excellent value - our third recent visit - with two more soon.”
<Content>Overall we cannot fault this hotel. We last stayed two nights ago, on May 13th. - two rooms this time - there were three of us this visit. One of the three is a lady nearer 90 than 80. She thought it was excellent . The very helpful and pleasant Reception staff made sure our rooms were near one another on the same floor. The room my partner and I had was small, but quite adequate - and quiet!! We had noticed on our two recent previous visits how good the sound proofing is.The TV reception was poor, but we moved the aerial lead which sorted it out.. The bed was very comfortable: the room was clean: the water hot: tea and coffee in the room: plenty of wooden hangers in the closet: Adequate towels (2 per person): small safe. We liked the bar - drinks were very reasonably priced and the wine good. The small coffee bar on the Mezzanine over the hotel entrance was fine. Good coffee and outstanding, large, Danish pastries. We have not tried their two restauants nor had breakfast other than in the Coffee Shop.

<Title>“Low quality”
<Content>Maybe it is hit or miss on whether you get a refurbished room or not, but mine certainly wasn't! Room 629 was close to the lift so I heard the 'ping' regularly. Carpet was threadbare, towels were thin, shower was cell-like, shower head was so furred up that the water sprayed everywhere, shower curtain stained so I chose to shower with it open rather than it stick to me (red bacteria at the bottom - an all-too-common site in hotels), tiles were cracked, grout was dirty, bedroom window was tiny (but nice view of BT Tower), window was hard to open as TV was in the way!, TV reception poor, bottom sheet on bed was not even 'tucked' in, lighting poor, dated furnishings, breakfast seemed extensive, but scrambled eggs were typically en masse, breakfast room reminded me of a youth hostel, drinks from machines - yuk. Generally poor - booked last minute for £111 - could have done better if I had time to hunt. Location is good - close to T Ct Rd tube, Soho, Oxford Street etc

<Title>“A comfortable stay”
<Content>Having stayed at the St Giles Hotel for 1 night we decided to stay again and make it 2 nights to experience all the good reviews we had read before. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay and met our needs when required. The room was on the 8th floor and not to far a distance away to get around the hotel. We had a nice view and a refurbished room which had a very comfortable bed which provided us with a good night's rest despite being in the city with all the overnight noise and marble bathroom with shower. No bath but the power shower sure did its job effectively and had hot running water. The location was perfect for us as we were going to see We Will Rock You at the Dominion Theatre. Also, Oxford street is just around the corner and Tottenham Court Road Underground Tube station is very close to access all underground networks. The best thing with the hotel for us was the location and the comfort of the bed. We would certainly recommend this hotel to our friends and family and we intend to stay there again when visiting London.

<Title>“location +++”
<Content>Right in the heart of the West End with many theatres nearby, including 'We will Rock You' a couple of doors away. This is a BIG hotel, slickly operated - a bit like being on a conveyor belt. The rooms are smallish but perfectly adequate and we actually had a good night's sleep. It is ideal for a city break, being a short walk to so many attractions, including the National Gallery and Covent Garden. The 'Breakfast 2 Go' consists of a small counter where guests are handed a drink, a pastry and a piece of fruit to start the day - unusual but it works as it fills a gap and takes up so little precious sightseeing time. Nearest station is Tottenham Court Road - about 5 mins walk.

<Title>“Not impressed...”
<Content>I found some of the reception staff quite rude and dismissive. However the Manager took over and apolgised for the language barrier. My friend's room smelt of sewerage/drains and the rooms were cold. Breakfast was ok but I would never stay here again - stayed in much nicer hotels in London.

<Title>“Great Value - Basic”
<Content>Booked for one night due to central location. The room was small but clean and the bed was comfy. The staff were reasonable. The bar stayed open till 2am and drinks were average price for London. Breakfast is a crowded self service affair but reasonable as it is included in the price, continental or cooked is available and there is a coffee machine doing the fancy coffees. They advertise the use of the pool (Part of the YMCA) but this is at extra cost approximately £4. Overall I was pleasantly surprised! Good stay.

<Title>“Not as bad I was expecting....”
<Content>I stayed for 2 nights for business. Given all the reviews I did not have high expectations, and hal thought I may have to look for somewhere else to stay! Upon arrival, my bags were quickly taken inside whilst I paid the taxi driver, and then there was a very long queue to check in - although it was only just after 2pm (their check in time). I seemed to be the only person who did not have a problem checking in - had been done via the works travel agent. Every other person had problems with their bookings - had been booked online on various websites but those bookings had not been processed by the hotels reservation team, resulting in many people sat on the mezannine level, and some very unhappy people. I was on the 6th floor, which seems to have been refurbished. As expected, the single room is tiny - but was ok for what I needed. The bathroom was quite special though, I don't think I have ever seen such a good/ bad use of space! - I have been in bigger broom cupboards! The bathroom seemed to be one area which had not been decorated recently. Bed was reasonably comfortable. Usual inner city noise with window open, but couldn't hear anything with it shut, so slept surprisingly well. Breakfast - wouldn't bother paying the extra for that again, would either go for breakfast on the run, or pop into a nearby shop/coffee place to get something. Wifi is available on the mezannine level - at a cost of £10 per day! Speed is ok though. Access is not available in the rooms - although it did say you could connect via a cable - didn't see this though. Tv reception - incredibly dodgy, usual 1-5 channels, plus the odd periodic appearance of a couple of freeview channels. I didn't try the bar/restaurants, I grabbed tea from an m&s a short walkup the road. If you are only staying a couple of days, and have a small bag, then there shouldn't be any problems, as other people have said, its not like you spend that much free time in your room. The biggest negative was the constant smell of cigarette smoke. It was so bad at some times I was expecting a smoke alarm to go off! - this seemed to be coming from neighbouring rooms. I didn't actually see any signs in any of the rooms, or in the hotel to indicate no smoking, so I can assume that tourists were not too familiar with the smoking ban here!

<Title>“Location, Location, Location - and that's it...”
<Content>Just back from the 'St Grotty Hotel' as we dubbed it. Like a mass transit camp for evacuees, full of 'today is London, we stay here' coach parties. My SO was appalled at the room, me, well I've seen worse in time spent overseas. Reception and flunkies on the door look fine for clicking fingers for taxis, but go beneath the glitz and this place needs serious money on it. The room was a dingy lit double, so small with a bed, nothing else could fit in. The lifts are so slow (5? of them) we used to walk down from 8th floor. Shower needed serious deep cleaning / retiling, bathroom not painted for ages, room/bed linen smelt of smoke or just unlaundered for quite a while, the hot water took ages to come through - but hot when it arrives.The bed was past its prime, you could feel the springs digging in. Breakfast was like a military cookhouse or school canteen (they are cleaner and more organised) with help yourself in the teeming masses to overcooked scrambled egg and burnt bacon etc. The dining furniture should have been thrown out, it was that bad. The pool is near the hotel, not in it, you find out when you arrive, so we never made use of it. Fantastic for 5 mins walk to British Museum, tube 1 min, Oxford St & Soho 5mins. And that is its one redeming feature. If someone bought this place and upgraded it, they would have a real jewel in the crown, but either the current owners cannot, or do not have the dough to spend on it. If you want comfort, go elsewhere, if you want no frills fare just to crash out in and use as a base, then it suffices. Even a Travelodge is 5* in comparison with this. Would I use again - only if I had no other options.

<Title>“Thank you”
<Content>We were booked into this hotel via a website and it was a secret saver hotel. One night was booked with 15+ days parking for a little over £100, no complaints there. I checked the hotel once we were aware of its identity and found other reviews to be accurate; clean, convenient to Heathrow, quiet but probably not somewhere you would want to book in for more than a few nights. The restaurant in the hotel was good standard and not too expensive but for me the best bit, having been stranded for eight days due to the volcanic ash fiasco was that I did not return home to yet another bill. Our car was at the hotel for an extra 8 days for no extra charge and little things like that can make a big difference when every other company you have dealt with have used the situation as an opportunity to make a quick buck so Thank You St Giles Hotel

<Title>“Won't be back!”
<Content>Stayed here for 3nights for the London Marathon 2010 with a group of fellow running friends & their supporters. The location was perfect - great transport links for the marathon start and finish, and for the 'touristy' stuff after - close to the theatre, shops, lovely cafes, restaurants & other attractions. However think it may rely to much on its location and lets other items slip... Check in/out staff rushed and rude - manners cost nothing! Rooms were very small and I'm pretty sure it wasn't a standard double bed. However, it was clean and the cleaners friendly & polite. Room had very little daylight & poorly lit (good luck doing your hair & make up). Terrible reception on the 5-channel TV (but hey, we weren't staying there to watch the TV). Italian restaurant is meant to be good.. but sadly closed at weekends! (Serious money-making opportunity missed there - a hotel full of runners craving pasta??) I'm no Londoner, but the price didnt seem that great value for what we got. Price for using room phone is ridiculous! £2 to transfer an incoming call?? But my biggest complaint had to be breakfast. Our rate didn't include breakfast, which was fine. I'd phoned ahead and asked if on marathon morning I could possibly use a microwave to heat some milk & porridge - no problem, i was told. But on marathon morning I was disgusted to be charged £9.95 for heating up MY OWN porridge! The catering manager was rude and obnoxious and instead of diplomatically settling the situation, preferred to argue it out infront of a packed breakfast room. Absolutely no customer service skill what so ever - and that goes for the majority of the staff in the hotel. If you do decide to go to this hotel - make sure you don't get breakfast included with your rate - there are so many lovely cafes close by you will get a much better deal and quality food! [Porridge situation excluded] the food choice is poor and not particularly fresh - and you certainly won't get service with a smile! yuk See my other reviews - I'm not a persistant complainer! But this hotel really took the biscuit (or porridge perhaps?? haha)

Only thing going for it is the location. I complained about the lack of hot water and cleanliness of the room, and the staff didn't care a hoot. Spend the 50 quid extra and stay somewhere more comfortable. BIG NO NO HOTEL.Luckily I only stayed one night

<Content>We stayed at the St.Giles when we went to London for a New Year weekend break. It's a great location, just off Tottenham Court Road near the Dominion Theatre. The room was cozy but comfy and more than adequate for our needs. The bathroom was nice and roomy and clean. We didn't have breakfast but the menu looked good, there were also a few restaurants attached to the hotel that provided a wide range of cuisines - Italian, Chinese, Australian! Because of being in the capital we didn't really use these facilities, but the staff at reception were very welcoming and the concierge staff were helpful as well as entertaining!

<Title>“Perfect location but small rooms”
<Content>The hotel is located in a perfect neighbourhood if you want to do some shopping, go to the theatres or just visit the city. Breakfast is good, but the only problem is that there are so many rooms for a smaller place to eat. If you want to make sure to have a bit of room for sitting you should be at the breakfast room before 8.30 AM. The rooms are small but ok, the bed is good. There isn't much place to put your things away. I've been there a few times and it was always good, i didn't have any complaints. The people were friendly and helpful. Everything was fine. It's a nice hotel if you want to be close to the center.

<Title>“Lack of sleep, due to noise from main roads”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this hotel as we were visiting the West End for a show. The front of the hotel is very dated, but once inside we were pleasantly surprised by the reception area. It looked quite grand and staff seemed very polite. All in all we were delighted with the initial appearance. This changed when we got the keys to our room. We stayed in room 509. The room was very small, smelt damp and was extremely hot. I am always very cold and find it hard to get warm, but the heat in the room was incredible... it was like sitting in a sauna. It was so bad we had to sit in our underwear to cool down, the sweat was running down our faces. There was a small window in the room, that opened slightly but didn't make much difference. Also ALL the hotel rooms face a very busy main road. The noise was awful, there were police sirens going off all night, loud music and taxis passing our window. At night with the heat, we tried to have our window open to cool down, but the noise through the triple glazing was bad enough, yet alone having the window open. It was liking sleeping next to M6 motorway. We both tried to sleep with cotton wool in our ears but it was impossible. The best thing about this hotel was the 'coffee to go breakfast', the coffee and baked goods were lovely. We have stayed in London numerous times at various locations and this has got to be the worst hotel by far.

<Title>“Great location, shame about the rooms!”
<Content>Chose this hotel because of its convenient location. Pleasant and helpful staff but room bore absolutely no relation to pictures or description. Just enough room for double bed, only 1 bedside table/light (no central light) and a tv. The additional seating area, for which we paid a premium, was in another small room, with no view of tv. Hanging space not long enough to hang a skirt, let alone anything full length. No mirror over the dressing table so hairdryer not well placed. Safe and fridge useful additions. Almost impossible to sleep due to noise from street and airconditioning unit. Can't comment on food as didn't try any. Very disappointing.

<Title>“Noisy and cramped...”
<Content>Stayed in a single room that was so small that it was difficult to open my suitcase. The really bad thing was, however, that it was very noisy. Noise from corridors, traffic noise and noise from a fan in the room. I am usually not bothered by noise, but here I could not sleep at all. Tried on day 2 to talk to the reception to get a decent sized room that was less noisy. The receptionist only told me that I was lucky, because my room was probably better than most. I accept that there must be some noise in a London hotel, but this was too much for me.

<Title>“Small, noisy but well located”
<Content>Stayed here for on night, did not spend much time in the room except to shower and change for a night out. Small shower, small room, small tv with a terrible signal, small bed with just a sheet and bedcover, the towels were a bit threadbare and it is very noisy because you can here everything from the other rooms and the halls where even the corridors are tiny, cost us £110.00 for a double room but it is very well located and £110 in central London is cheap, not the sort of hotel we would normally stay in if we were to stay for more than one night as you would not want to spend any time in the room. After reading some other reviews it seems that you can get an even cheaper price. OK if all you want is location and are not a light sleeper who likes to watch a bit of tv with a choice of channels!

<Title>“Brilliant location but give breakfast a miss !”
<Content>Stayed here with my better half for two nights 2/3 Arpril , we chose the hotel as we used air miles and we knew location to be good . Double room very cupboard like with a small double bed ( why are double beds in European hotels so much bigger ?!!) Room was clean ,tea ,coffee making facilities ,usual riubbish hairdryer in bathroom ladies best take your own ! The main problem was breakfast ,with such a vast number of rooms you would expect to find a large enough area to eat ,sadly this was not the case .At 830 the place can only be described as like Piccadilly Circus in rush hour full of lots of overseas students taking up most of the space! The breakfast was average but as there was no space to eat i ended up grabbing a box of cereal and eating while standing up in lounge area not a pleasant experience ! The next morning we decided on a more relaxing start to the day and ate at Cafe Rouge next door to hotel . If you are on a tight budget and can cope with hot bedrooms ,small beds and not doing breakfast then location is all !!!

<Title>“The hotel is well positioned for a theatre break, the rooms are good and the breakfast is plentiful.”
<Content>We booked through Show and Stay and would recommend that agency. We wanted a hotel that was near to the theatre so that was why we chose the St Giles on Bedford Avenue. We had two twin rooms and whilst not massive the rooms were clean, well furnished and the bathrooms of both were a good size. The only complaint on the rooms was the television, as the picture had constant interference and it was the same in both rooms. We had the European breakfast and this was a buffet style with cereals, fruit, coffee, tea, juice, yoghurts, bacon, egg etc. All you could expect and in plentiful supply. It was very busy in the breakfast room and you had to be nimble to avoid fellow guests on their way back to their table from the buffet bar. Perhaps not a good place for young children to be. During our visit with teenage sons the residency tended to be older guests or groups of overseas teenagers. The staff were helpful, check in very good and the concierge service professional in looking after our bags after we had checked out on the final day. All in all we would recommend the hotel. The theatres are in easy reach and you can walk to trafalgar Square in fiteen minutes.

<Content>I was staying in central London for one night on busines and the priority was finding somewhere central, cheap and cheerful. That's exactly what the St Giles is. The room was tiny, but that was fine. The hotel was reasonably clean although a bit shabby and outdated. For the price I paid (about 80 EURO) it was excellent value with a great breakfast and even a free newspaper thrown in.

<Title>“Location great, double rooms good, single rooms like cupboards!”
<Content>The hotel is very central, The double rooms were good and clean. The single room I stayed in can only be described as a 'box room' or a 'cupboard'! It reminded me of the halls of residence I stayed in as student! The bathroom is tiny. Dont go in the shower if you are claustrophobic as it is very small and dark, and take care when stepping out of it as your are stepping onto the toilet! Breakfast was good - no toast though, only croissants or hard rolls.

<Title>“Good in many ways, but some problems”
<Content>The hotel is centrally located in London. The twin room I stayed in was clean and tidy, but rather small. I liked the city view from the 10th floor, but it might not be everyone's idea of a good view. Reception staff were friendly and helpful, and I was able to book a "boxed up" breakfast for collection at reception early in the morning, since I was checking out before the breakfast hall opened. Bad points were erratic lifts (that sometimes cancelled your floor selection on the way, and returned all the way to the bottom), luke warm shower, and the small rooms. Personally, I'd rather stay in a similarly priced hotel slightly further out, with better rooms, and use the tube to get to central London.

<Title>“excellent location good value hotel.”
<Content>Have read other reviews deriding this hotel and found them to be incorrect. Rooms are on the small side but you are in london to go out and see sights not spend all day in your room!. Hotel spotlessy clean ,food more than adequate all hot and fresh. staff very friendly and helpful. hotel is excellently positioned for theatres and sight seeing,only a short walk from tube station and oxford road shops. will definately stay again when we go to london to see another west end show.

<Title>“Awful rooms, so bad we decided not to stay”
<Content>Well what a disappointment this hotel is, the nice foyer and entrance are very deceiving, the rooms certainly do not look like the ones on their website. My mother daughter and I were allocated a triple room on the 7th floor, we opened the door and couldnt believe it, the tiniest room divided by a partition with prison like windows. It was dark, where the double bed was there was zero storage, my bed was a pull down out of a wardrobe which left us with half a wardrobe for clothes, not enough for 3 nights stay. You could not walk around any of the beds it was so small. There was no way that we could stay there so we cancelled our booking and found a room at the Travelodge on High Holborn Road around the corner which was 10 times better. Location might be good but the room we were given was the worst I've seen.

<Title>“No complaints, great hotel, excellent location!”
<Content>Arrived at hotel at 10.30am. No queues at reception and our room was ready straight away. Room was on no 265 2nd floor and was standard twin room. Room was quite small but there was a separate area with table & 2 chairs and work table. Bathroom and shower were good size, no problems with mould or smells like other people have said. Breakfast was lovely just try to get down before 8am or leave it until 9am or after - gets very busy and hard to find a table in between times. Conceirge were helpful in getting us taxi to train station and providing us with any info we needed. Lifts were slow but we used stairs so best to try and get a room on the lower floors. No problems with outside noise at night and beds were comfy. Brilliant location, only 1 min from tube and at end of Oxford Street which was good after a days shopping! Walking distance to almost everywhere, we didn't have to use the tube. Would definately stay here again and reccommend to others.

<Title>“Hideous!!”
<Content>Oh my goodness!! i can't believe i spent almost £100 on this hotel!! We stayed one night in a standard room whilst out for the night in London. The entrance was fine and check in was ok. We were on the 12th floor. You take a lift to the 11th and then another to the 12th.....that lift is the smallest thing i have seen....me and my hubbie just about fitted, and when we took our friends up to see our terrible room, we couldn't all fit in (we are not big people). The 12th floor stank of smoke!!! Our room was the smallest room i have ever been in, just room for the bed, which only had a sheet, a tiny window, a cupboard with a safe but no room for clothes and a small shelf for the kettle....the room was damp and had horrible artex walls. The shower room was even worse with horrible tiled walls and the tiniest shower ever!! well...our room made our friends feel a little bit better about theres.....they were on the 7th floor....room was tiny and damp, but it did have an extra small room with space to hang clothes and dressing table. still a tiny shower but they had nicer tiles!! I would have complained if it wasn't for the fact that we were literally staying to sleep and it actually gave us a good laugh at how hideous the place was....my husband dropped the shower gel in the shower and didn't actually have any room to bend down and get it and smashed his head on the tiles!!! I would not of stayed here if i had have to of spent more than one night or any amount of time in the room when i wasn't sleeping. Location is good though and i guess thats why it is expensive. So glad we chose not to have breakfast at thie hotel.

<Title>“Great location for shopping”
<Content>I came to London for NY, or should I say sales :) Stayed in this hotel for 9 days. Yes, the room was small, but I wasn't planning to have a party in it for 20 people. Very comfy bed, tv, heater, fan, small kettle, chair, enough room for couple of suitcases, it's own safe, a great view (I stayed on 11th floor). What else would you need? This is London, so don't expect big rooms in hotels, this one is not an exception. So I don't consider the size of the room as a negative. The hotel itself is nice and clean. 0.5 minute from Oxford street and the tube. Exactly what I needed. A grocery store right in front of hotel. I got a very nice room with recent renovation. I was right near the elevator and at times it was too noisy (but I don't mind the noise). But you should ask for a room away from the elevator, cause it gets quite noisy when the elevator moves up and down. Also, 2 sides of the hotel are facing pretty busy streets with a noisy intersection. But it'll bother you only if you open windows. I didn't hear the street noise with windows closed. The receptionists and consierge where welcoming and helpful. I asked for a possibility of a late check out (at 2 PM) and they even offered me to stay until 3PM if I needed (i was leaving for the airport at 4pm). You can also leave your bags with the consierge if you are checking out in the morning but leaving later in the day. It'll cost you 1 pound per suitcase. I don't know how's the food in this hotel as I booked the room without breakfast and didn't use their restaurant. But there are lots of small cafes and restaurants nearby. My personal favourite was (and still is) a small chinese place at the begining of Oxford street. Bottom line is I received everything I expected - good service, great location, clean comfy room - for the money I wanted to spend vs. location. I travelled alone and didn't have any problems. I'm definelty coming back to London for winter sales and will be staying in St Giles again.

<Title>“Satisfactory hotel, but could have been better”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel as it is very close to the British Museum. This and its poximity to Oxford St were its best features. The hotel room was adequate, but the shower room was horrible. The grout between the tiles was mouldy and anyone of above average build would not have been able to use it as it was minute. Reception was a nightmare. We queued for 20 minutes to check in, and then for two further 20 minute periods during our stay when we had queries about our room. (No use ringing reception as no-one answered). Surely they could have arranged things more efficiently. I also resented having to pay extra for the swimming pool, (which was advertised as part of the hotel on its website), for leaving my luggage with the conciege, and for internet access.

<Content>I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. Location is best- 1 block away from oxford st & 1 block away from tube. Saved some $$ for taking tube. Takes ~20min leisurely walk to Piccadilly. Good selection for free breakfast...just go early to avoid line up. Concierge is helpful, as they helped us find a cheap car service to airport (as tube not in service early in am)

<Content>Good checkin, room small but had everything we needed and was clean. We asked for an extra pillow and it was delivered to the room straight away. Breakfast was good and always hot,but no toast or fried eggs. Staff very friendly and always helpfull. The only negative was the lifts, they were often busy, and full by the time they got to us, we were on the 6th floor, still we were on holiday, so had the time to wait. The position of the hotel is fantastic, walking distance to most places of interest.

<Content>Great Hotel , within walking distance of so much and tube station only across the road . Rooms are a little on the small side but how long do you plan to stay in them ? . We were on the 9th floor and yes you can hear the usual city noises but doesnt stop you sleeping . The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful !! The hotel was full over the weekend so they must be doing something right !! Wouldn't hesitate in recommending this Hotel to anyone or returning to stay .........its a gem !

<Title>“Very good hotel with excellent location”
<Content>This is a very good hotel. It's located reight beside everything you's want in London - West End, Oxford St., museums, sights, theatres, pubs etc. Easy access to the rest of the city either by tube or walking. The hotel itself is functional. You get a decent breakfast. Service is good. The rooms are very small but clean. We;ve stayed there twice so we;re happy with it. The street noise can be a problem but it would be the same in any other city hotel. The aircon might be a bit inadequate though.

<Title>“Excellent hotel which I would use again without hesitation”
<Content>Having read some Trip Adviser reviews I was a bit dubious about staying at this hotel expecting it may be noisy, the room inadequate, and unfriendly staff. My friend & I had none of these! The room was very clean, small but had all the facilities expected & required, and very quiet. The service at reception was efficient and friendly. Whilst the breakfast room was very busy, it is only what to expect with a large, fully occupied hotel! The choice of food was perfectly acceptable and there was always somewhere to sit. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable stay.

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>Arrived at the hotel around 3pm and rooms were not ready had to wait an hour for some rooms to become available. Once I opened the door to the room it was the size of my living room. Now I have a decent sized living but I dont want the whole room to be the size of it. The lighting was dark in the rooms with all of them on, tv was a small 13 inch, no irons in the room you have to go to a floor to iron in a room. Bfast is available but its the same thing everyday. On the up side it is in the middle of everything, you can walk to all the restaurants, clubs, stores, movie theaters, and broadway shows. The hotel has a lounge in the lobby and they can charge drinks and food to your room but it is not part of the hotel, the system they used to charge stuff to your room was constantly not working. The tube is a block away and can get you where you need to go quickly, if you want to get to Picadilly Circus it can be walked in about 30 minutes.

<Content>This hotel is not 5 star but it is ,for a central london hotel an ideal place to stay. We stayed in a double room,yes they are quite small and the bathroom was also quite small but it was clean and warm.The breakfast was not Gordon Ramsey but the quality was fine, more than enough to set youself up for the day.The hotel seemed to be very busy all the time but at night it was very quiet. Location is superb 10mins walk to Leic square and covent garden Oxford Street on the door step,1mile from Euston and most thearters on walking distance. To sum up we stayed for 3 nights and yes if we stayed for more than a week then this room would have been rather small,but if you stay for a short time then this hotel is ideal.

<Title>“Excellent location and good value for the money”
<Content>We stayed three nights over New Year and were pleasantly surprised. Reading the reviews online made us expecting far more less. Location is excellent and central. A couple of minutes walk to Tottenham Court Road tube station, British Museum around the corner and Oxford Street just 100 meters away. Check-in was fast and friendly. The room was on the smaller side but clean. In the winter I suppose you can find it a bit cold, but that didn't bother us. A hint of mould could be found by the window facing the street, but nothing disturbing. Street sounds were minimal. The room was attended daily. Breakfast was a positive surprise to me. I had read about how minimalistic it was, but to us it seemed ok. You could eat as much as you liked and we left satisfied every morning. Good value for the money if you're not expecting luxury. I'd recommend it for anyone going to London and want a central location and a decent price.

<Title>“Average hotel, but great location”
<Content>I have been to London many times and have yet to find a good, centrally located hotel. Having said that, St. Giles Hotel is definitely one of the better places I stayed at. The hotel in itself is nothing special. It's massive and the breakfast area reminds you of a high school cafetaria. The rooms are a bit outdated and small (it's London, what do you expect?), but clean. The concierge was pretty helpful. The best thing about this hotel is its location. It's right on Oxford Street, so if you're up for some shopping, I can definitely recommend St. Giles Hotel. Halfway through our shopping spree we stopped to drop off our shopping bags, without losing too much time. The hotel is also within walking distance of Leicester Square, with loads of restaurants, bars, theaters, coffee shops and other shops around. The nearest underground station is just around the corner. If you're not looking to spend too much time in the hotel and would rather go out, St. Giles is a good choice.

<Content>Stayed here for the night when out in London. Great location just of Tottenham Court Road, the place is clean with nice staff and is really good value. Rooms are small but clean and with basic facilities but the bed is comfortable and as long as your not staying for too many nights then it's all fine. I didnt really use any of the facilities but think there's a pool in the basement - really cant fault the place - even had a vending machine with cans of Carlsberg which was handy. No complaints would defo stay again and is far better value than a lot of others in the area - they aslo do a late check out on a Sunday for £10 or so which lets you keep the room until 6pm

<Title>“Good Clean Hotel in Great Location”
<Content>I agree that a lot of these reviews are tough on this hotel. I went with a group of MBA/MAcc students from Birmingham, Alabama and we stayed at the St. Giles for a week. The rooms are small, but very clean. We did not spend much time in our rooms, but who needs to when there's so much to see in London! I also recommend opting for the full breakfast. It was great to have a good warm breakfast for mornings when we had sites to see early. (Although we were shocked that beans are served for breakfast...haha) The concierge was extremely helpful and we even booked a Golden Tours tour to Windsor, Stonehenge and Bath through the concierge desk. Reading the reviews before the trip I was a little worried, but I was very pleased after staying at the St. Giles!

<Title>“Good Location, Budget Hotel....you get what you pay for.”
<Content>As others have said, fantastic location. You couldn’t be much closer for Oxford Street. Short walk to Soho/Chinatown/Leicester Square/Trafalgar Square and Covent Garden. For a slightly longer walk we walked down Pall Mall to Buckingham Palace (but it’s not too far away). The rooms are indeed quite small, so if you’re in London and intend to spend too much time in the room, it’s adequate for sleeping in. Breakfast is very busy and it’s okay, not fabulous but enough to kickstart a day sight seeing, there is a burger king and café nearby so if you’re in a rush it would probably be better to go elsewhere. In terms of the staff, we found all the guys working on the Concierge desk more than helpful, very nice and friendly. Wish we could say the same about Reception where an attempt at a smile would have been nice. There are parts of the hotel that are shabby, but as a base to explore London on a budget I think this would be hard to beat. One last bit of advice, take a hairdryer, the hairdryer in the bathroom is from the 1970’s and would probably take a week to dry your hair!

<Title>“Excellent location, bad hotel”
<Content>We appreciated: a) the location : just by Oxford street, walking distance from Trafalgar square, 1 minute walk from Tottenham Court Road metro station, it's an ideal situation if you want to go shopping or visiting the center of London b) the staff at concierge booth were very helpful and nice. We didn't appreciate: a) the freezing room : we had an executive room, but it was at the end of the building, in an area that was FREEZING. So for 2 nights in a row we came back from the cold and had to wait a couple of hours till the room warmed up. People at the reception couldn't care less. b) the furniture in the room. Was the lowest quality from IKEA c) being told "we don't do room service" when calling the reception for an additional toothbrush d) only Irish newspapers available. They seem to be quite proud of their Irish background, but come on, when you're in London you would like to read some news of what's going on there, not in some obscure place near Dublin!.. e) the long wait by the lifts. Ok, this is not something they can easily change, but their lifts are rather sloppy and not sufficient for the number of rooms. Their doors are buggy and keep opening a few times before closing. f) the long wait for the eggs and bacon at the executive breakfast place. I don't think real executives would have that much time to waste... g) the reception staff was very slow and not very helpful h) the fact that for New Year's Eve they didn't organize anything at all in the hotel. I mean, they could have arranged some kind of party. Nothing of the kind.

<Title>“Bad hotel”
<Content>I went with a group of friends for a short weekend. When we checked in the guy behind the desk was so confused, we had 4 different rooms under the one booking, he had to do them all separately, that took ages and the queue behind us multiplied. We were "lucky" to get upgrades on our double rooms, I would hate to see the standard rooms if we got the deluxe twins. One of our rooms only had one set of towels, we had to argue with house keeping to get them to send up a set of towels. The bathrooms were dirty, rooms were very dusty, carpets had not been hoovered. Corridors in the hotel are very dark, and if you have no sense of direction you could get very lost because there are no signs to show you how to get the lift. Breakfast in the morning was alright as long as you didn't want hot food, it looked horrible. I would not stay here again, I would spend the extra money on a nicer hotel.

<Title>“Stop Whining”
<Content>What with all the bad reviews for this hotel? Its really not that bad. I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and upon arriving at the hotel at 6 AM, we were able to check-in although check-in time is 2 PM. The rooms were a bit on the small side but in densely populated London, all hotel rooms are small. The room's furnishings were also slight dated but the room was clean and the housekeeping staff would clean the rooms everyday. The room's bath room is slightly bigger then a bathroom you would find on a cruise shop but it was more then adequate. Has a shower stall, sink basin, and WC What more can you want from a bathroom?? For the last 2 days, we hanged the do not disturb sign on our door knob and on the 2nd day we receive a call from the housekeeping department informing us our rooms was not cleaned as we had hunged the do not disturb sign and asked if we need fresh bath towels. We were pleasantly surpised! Location wise, this hotel is also less then 3 minutes walking distance from Tottenham Court tube station and a GBP5 taxi ride to the west end theatre district. This hotel also has internet kiosk charged at GBP1 for 20 minutes. Expensive. For a cheaper althernative you could go directly oppoisite the hotel where there is a small cafe that offers internet service at GBP1 for 1 hour. During our stay , we also used the concierge extensively and they were able to give us the correct information and even helped us hailed a cab on one occassion. The disadvantage about this hotel is that in order to get to the hotel check-in counters from the hotel main entrance, one has to walk up a flight of stairs. Quite troublesome. Also, at certain times of the day, the check-in counters can get very busy. Despite of this 2 disadvantage, i would stay at this hotel again.

<Title>“Great Location good value”
<Content>I was in London 2 nights and just needed a place to stay close to leicester Square. The Hotel was great for my purpose, and the room was nice and clean. The room was also small, but it was ok since I jut needed a place to sleep. Conclusion + average low budget hotel. great location close to the Tube and oxford street I would stay there again

<Title>“avoid it like the Swine Flu”
<Content>Just returned from a one night stay at this hotel with my Daughter and i am glad that is wasn't for longer. The room does not represent any acuracy compared to the photo's on the web site, it was a twin room & very very small & basic. the ensuite was just like a little square box, there was two of us & only one set of towels and NO face flannels at all, The cleanliness had a lot to be desired. one plus point was the water was hot (not a lot of good if you have nothing to wash with) The Breakfast was another experience altogether, I can only experience it as a likeness to a Works Canteen On arriving at the breakfast room there are rows of tables with nothing on them at all. it is all self service right down to the satchets of salt & pepper. There was no organisation what so ever , The cooked Breakfast looked appauling, sausages so overcooked there was nothing in the middle of them, bacon burned to a crisp, beans dried up around the edges, & overcooked scrambled egg (i hate scrambled egg anyway but that was the only choice), needless to say i did not even bother to try it. My Daughter did try to eat something but it was all lukewarm so we gave up, On check out i asked them to take off the Breakfast element from the final bill and was told that breakfast was not charged for seperatley as it was all included.( included in what i wonder?) we had to go out and get breakfast from an outside venue ,but that was much more preferable that to eat that muck provided. I have stayed in a few other hotels in central london over the years and this one is by far the worse and NO cheaper, peole say you get what you pay for, well believe me you do NOT get what you pay for at this hotel STAY AWAY TRY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!

<Title>“Try to avoid it, but if you can't - go with the flow.”
<Content>The only good thing about this hotel is its location. Other than that, there is nothing good to say. The room resembled a box with uncomfortable bed and a tiny - tiny bathroom. It's actually a bed with a sink. The furniture is old and dark. Don't look at details in the bathroom if staying there - it is scary what you can see. As the rooms are tiny, there are hundreds of them on each floor, so plan to wait for the elevator. Having breakfast at this place, was closest to having breakfast in prison - I suppose. I really felt like a character in OZ. But the minute you step out of this stinky hole, you forget about it since you are in the heart of this amazing city. If you can afford just an extra 20 to 40 Pounds, go somewhere else. I certainly did.

<Title>“Like living in a wardrobe..”
<Content>Hi All, I just recently stayed at this hotel, work related. There were about 19 of us staying here and we all agreed the rooms were tiny!! Most of us were allocated single rooms, which were very small. You open your door and the bed is a foot away, rooms are extremley hot! I tend to get cold easily and even I was feeling too hot to be comfortable. Its very centrally located so you dont really have the option of leaving your window open at night as it is quite noisy outside. I slept with the window closed and didnt sleep very well mainly due to the room temperature and noise. Rooms are very out dated, the bathroom is very compact and if your claustrophobic please dont stay here. Im trying very hard to think of a positive for the room.. they have a safe box there. The dyer is not very good, so if you have long hair, best to take your wn or you'll be dying your hair for hours. The hotel itself is quite nice, the restaurant food (dinner) was nice and breakfast was ok. Our company payed for accom/dinner &breakfast, so not sure what the rate was. They had a bar on the ground level and a lounge area upstairs. On the whole I wouldn't stay here again and wouldnt recommend it to any of my friends out of embarrassment and cursed by them! They have really tried to make as much money as they possibly can by making rooms in what possibly should be storage rooms...

<Title>“Nice hotel terrible rooms”
<Content>The hotel is nice but they have spent so much time, chopping the rooms up, double beds barely fit in the room, standards don't have a bath only a small shower, the bathroom is tiny, unless you pay for a suite, which you wouldn't u'd stay in 4 star hotel, then u won't have wireless in your rooms, ironing board, aircon (and the hotel is very hot) I had to buy eye drops and had nose bleeds it was so hot at night. The rest of the hotel is nice but I would not recommend staying here as the rooms are awful as they have tried to make as much money as possible out of us by making the rooms very small to get more in and u get nothing, u even have to pay to use the hotel pool!? What.

<Title>“definitely won't go back”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights, I will never go back again. The price is not cheap at all, I have read the review but still try b/c I think London's hotel is like that, small and expensive. My goodness, after I slept one night, my legs have red dots, but I saw there is a nanny working in this hotel, therefore the room should be cleaned up. I don't feel comfortable at all in this hotel even though the location is great. The receptionist at the lobby is a trainee, I think she is very tired of her job, you can't hear what she says, she just talking to her nose. She looks very sleepy. It is a busy hotel, and when we check out, the elevator is not working, end up we need to walk to the ground floor, very outdated hotel. Walking distance to British Museum.

<Title>“Excellent - go for a suite, it includes fab breakfast. Great location, comfortable room”
<Content>Thoroughly enjoyed staying, we are not seasoned travellers but know what we like. Excellent location for theatres, good restaurants and Oxford Street. Good transport links, bus straight to and from Victoria, Tottenham Court Road tube just round the corner. British Museum round the other corner. Staff friendly and helpful. We chose a top of the range suite which was excellent and included luxury breakfast so in real terms paid £149 (£169 minus 2 x £10 breakfasts) air conditioned on 7th floor so no noise. Worth every penny. Hotel was full and busy but everyone kept smiling (except the barmaid at 11.00 at night who had obviously had a long day!) concierge desk excellent help to those who are not used to London. Plan to make this our base for next trip.

<Content>great location very close to tottenham ct rd tube-theatres all very accessible. I think slightly overpriced for what is classed as 3 star. adequate enough though for 1 night stay & breakfast to go(danish,drink & fruit) was included in the price. Room small but fine for short stay-would not want to stay there in summer as there is no aircon(some rooms have it but at extra cost).

<Content>I am surprised this hotel hasn't gotten higher reviews. It in a perfect location just off Oxford st. Rigth beside Tottenham Court rd tube station. The hotel is basic enough and reception is always busy but I'm not surprised it's busy as it is a fab price for city centre. Staff were so helpful with advice of restaurants/getting cabs/general friendliness. I will definitely stay here the next time I visit London.

<Title>“Excellent Location”
<Content>Arrived in Heathrow from Dublin, got the underground to hotel, only one change, cost £4 for one way. You get off at Tottenham Court Road, cross over Oxford Street & the hotel is just off to your right. Check in was Ok, the rooms were TINY!!!! They were clean, but you wouldnt spend much time in them. Excellent location, just off Oxford Street, about 10mins walk to China Town, 15mins walk to Leister Square & Picaddily Circus. Get down for breakfast early as it does be packed. Its a very busy hotel, book early. I would recommend the hotel, only for its location, next time I might try the Thistle Hotel, Marble Arch, its at the other end of Oxford Street.

<Content>we stayed at the St Giles for one night only, we where pleasantly surprised with the location, the staff, accomodation + value for money. Yes the rooms are small but tell me someone who wants to spend time in there other than to sleep, the location of this hotel means you are in easy access to all the sites, shops, landmarks +theatres with the tube station only 50 metres away. This was our first visit to this hotel and we will definitely be back for another visit + longer stay! We were recommended this hotel by a friend who uses it while on business in London.

<Title>“Great location, terrible bed”
<Content>We stayed for 12 nights which put some extreme pressure on our backs with a terrible bed. The room was small but it is only a spot to sleep. Location was great with easy access to the tube or any of the city sites. It was lovely to stroll through soho and all the great restaurants there. Breakfast was ok but, you need to get there early. Breakfast choices seemed fairly limited after 12 straight days. We had a very noisy room with sirens on Tottenham Court Road all night. I would not recommend the hotel during summer as the rooms were very stuffy even at this stage of autumn.

<Content>I did reserve in this hotel several times before . Each time in a standard room . The where smal but clean . It was the good location of this hotel that kept us going back . But last march i was in for a surprise , out of the blue i booked the executive suite at a verry decent price . When i arrived i could believe it , a view over London from every window , even the bathroom . Luxury verry warm and nice, spacious , in every room a flatscreen Tv etc .. After a sightseeing day in london a pleasure to return to . In short a nice price for such a lovely room . Will be going back April 2010 , booked the same room .

Needless to say there was no space in my room for me and my suitcase at the same time.

<Title>“Small room but well located”
<Content>We paid £111 for a double room with breakfast on Saturday 24th October as we stayed in London after seeing a show. The hotel is well located just a 3 minute walk from Tottenham Court tube station. When we arrived at around 2.30pm, there was a long queue to check in so we went for something to eat before going back half an hour or so later and the queue was down to one or two people. Efficiant check in for us, directed to room 252 on the 2nd floor. The room was small with a small double bed, in fact the room was smaller than our room at home and we have a king sized bed as well. There's not much wardrobe space, no mini bar, a few drawers, the tv was hidden away in a cupboard, you had to pull the shelf out a little way but had Sky Sports One, which we weren't expecting. There are tea & coffee making facilities and more importantly, a plug socket right by the large mirror, ideal for plugging a hairdryer or straighteners in and much better than those horrid hairdryers in bathrooms. Our room seemed to be in a fairly quiet part of the hotel, no disturbances during the night from road noise or other guests. The bed was comfy, the bathroom was also small with just a shower cubicle but a good shower, shame the towels are pretty little, I'm a five feet nothing size 12 and it only just covered the important bits :) The alarm went off around 9am the next morning and several guests were wondering if they should go downstairs, we did using the staircase but I was surprised to see not one member of staff directing people or just telling us it was a false alarm - which it was it turned out to be. The lifts seem to take an age to arrive any time we wanted to use them so we did use the stairs quite a bit, along with several other guests, particularly when going down for breakfast. Breakfast is in a huge great canteen style room, basically you grab a table, sit down then one of you goes up at a time to get what you want. There's no table service at all, apart from clearing the tables, you make your own hot drinks and queue for your breakfast, but there's a decent choice, bread, fruit, cereals, bacon, sausages, beans, hash browns and scrambled eggs, which had a powdery taste. That said, it was hot and you just served yourself, so could pile up your plate if you wanted to. Check out was again efficient. I would stay here again as it wasn't an unreasonable price for the location in Central London, but I wouldn't stay for more than the one night due to the lack of space in the room. It's a big hotel, slightly confusing corridors as another poster commented but the location is excellent.

<Title>“What's all the Fuss about?”
<Content>Four of us travelled from Liverpool and stayed in this hotel in October 2009 - ages ranging from 27 - 80. We had twin rooms which were more than adequate for what we wanted i.e. a reasonably priced central hotel to avoid getting on the underground late at night. Our first night there we spent all day sightseeing and then went to the theatre so we didn't actually check in until after 11 p.m. I telephoned hotel to say I was going to be late and they told me not to worry just have a good time, the rooms would be kept etc. The rooms were sure big enough for us (what do you need a ballroom for?) Beds were comfortable and clean, hotel warm, bathroom clean, clean towels, hot water, good shower, complimentary toiletries and teas and coffees. Hairdryer in room. TV Bar open till 2 ish. Plenty of lifts. Breakfast was fine - pretty standard stuff - but nothing to complain about. I would definitely stay here again as it was so close to Leicester Square but set back so was quiet and what is more.......on the Sunday morning we witnessed them filming an episode of the Bill!!! Yeah and my favourite Sam Callis was there, so I was well chuffed. Only one complaint........our stay in London wasn't nearly long enough!!!

<Content>stayed for 3 nights for the first time because of its location. after looking at the web site , i had hoped a pleasureable stay; but here is the summary-chaotic check-in, small room, worn out dirty carpet, dark room, bath room insuffient light for shaving in the morning (just guessed where would be my beard hair); bad cold breakfast, cold boiled eggs, bad scrambled eggs, noisy bar, and worst of all-continued intermittent noise at night probably from boiler to keep you awake--no relaxation at all. only good thing is location but then there is Edwardian, ibis, Thistle nearby-much better. i will never go there again. please don't stay here. there are better places. total waste of money.

<Title>“Blackpool in the heart of London”
<Content>Having witnessed a French visitor doing a spinning act and making a meooowing sound next to me, I had an idea of what he was trying to get through to the vacant girl behind the reception, she was totally uninterested in what was going on and just ignored him and checked me in!! Not good start? Having checked in and then faught for a lift to get to our room (760) 7th floor, we entered and then backed out to check we had a double. Space around the bed was limited to a foot on one side and two feet on the other, minus the wardrobe and dressing table. Bathroom was even better, nearly 4ft square in total, it was like a phone box with a toilet and sink! :( Lights in the room were all low calorie bulbs and took an age to light up. What you actualy get for your £120 a night is a Blackpool B & B bedroom, which is then complemented by the Canteen at Longbridge, where queuein for your food is mandatory and then a fight for a table ensues. The bedrooms have all the splendour and comfort of trying to sleep on Boeing 757 across the atlantic or in a shop doorway down on cCharing Cross Road. In 30 years of world travel this is without douibt the worst hotel we have ever stayed in and a complete rip off at £120 a night, however, it is in a great position within walking distance of the Picadilly Theatres (5 minutes) Oxford St (5 minutes), if you feel you can suffer the rest and have money to burn, then you have yourself utopia! car park at rear is subsidized by 50% if you stay at the hotel, just have the conciarge stamp your ticket. Tip for all London travel is go at the weekend not in the week as prices are down by 40% and the choice of rooms is geater.

<Title>“Terrific Location and Decent Service for Budget Travelers”
<Content>Being next to Soho and the West End theaters, two blocks from the British Museum, very short walk to Tottenham Court Road tube station, and the fantastic price, all make up for a lot of minor complaints that other reviewers have mentioned. The rooms are small but clean. The elevators are usually crowded but elevator time is reasonable. The concierge desk was very helpful. Breakfast was fine--busy but well-organized and on a par with mid-priced (more expensive) hotels in London. Street noise substantial with windows open but closed windows at lights-out time virtually eliminates the noise. (Closing of windows in the high summer might be problematical, though.) Taxi pickup for the airport was smooth. I may be easy to please, but I will go back to this little find. As a home base for London cultural and shopping activities, it's great.

<Title>“A few downsides, but altogether fine for the basic purposes.”
<Content>Not half as bad as most reviews I have read. The service was fine. The Concierge indeed very helpful and pleasant. The room (single) was very small, and far from luxurious, but clean and sufficient for my needs. The elevators were sometimes slow to arrive (3rd floor). The European Breakfast was great! And I never had to wait in a long line (came down to eat everyday around 08:00. If you come later it may be different). The location is perfect! Although it also means there is noise from outside most of the time. Altogether: if you're looking for a hotel to spoil you, this is not it, but for bed+shower+breakfast - it's fine.

<Content>So if you are stuck for somewhere to sleep for one night and you get offered this hotel, thats fine, if you are looking for somewhere to hang out for a week/fortnight - keep moving. Some of the comments in the other reviews hold true. - the rooms were small (Everyone in my group said so - the sample size is >10) - My room was a bit grubby (And had a weird smell) - The beds were short (And single in my case) - WFi was absent i the room and paid for in the lobby However - The location is good (British museum less than 3 mins) - I found the staff fine - Breakfast was passable (Lunch was good) - The bar was ok and the staff entertaining This is a tourist class hotel servicing what seems to be coach parties, budget holidy makers and the clubber market - It is not as one reviewer said "A hostel". Price point is keenbut expect what you pay for.

<Title>“Executive Suites are an amazing bargain”
<Content>I really wasn't expecting the rooms to be as good as the description but was extremely happy with the quality of the accommodation, particularly the huge windows. I had a big room on the east side of the 7th floor for my first week - wonderful panoramic view across London. This room had a microwave and crockery, which was a welcome suprise. The room for my second week had views to the west, with the sofa in a perfect position to admire the sunset across the rooftops. Both rooms were very spacious and comfortable with xcellent showers/bathroom fittings. My only grumble would be the long wait for the lifts at peak times. I got a good price through booking.com and would thoroughly recommend these rooms.

<Title>“MORE OF A HOSTEL THAN A HOTEL”
<Content>Very disappointed with the so called 3 star hotel. Location is fantastic but the hotel is really awful. Rooms are tiny, facilities minimal and moreover the hotel is so big that it is a problem even to find the stairs- I suffer from claustrophobia. all in all NOT A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE!!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!

<Title>“Tiny room!!”
<Content>This was the smallest double room my wife and I have ever stayed in anywhere. The bright blue illuminated hotel sign outside the window also made it the best lit room we've ever slept in, which is not the best thing at 2/3/4/5 in the morning!! It was also noisy, being on Tottenham Court Road, which meant that opening the window wasn't an option so that the room was stuffy. Breakfast was okay, but rather lukewarm. We won't be coming back!!

<Title>“One of the best for the Price”
<Content>Just Stayed for 3 nights earlier this month. We have stayed in this hotel on 2 previous occasions because it is central for Oxford street and withing walking distance to many of the shows. Some of the rooms, although at the same price, are quite small so you have to be carefull of this. Forget the breakfast - too expensive and there are may places within 100 mtrs from the hotel. The pool & gym doesn't belong to the hotel so there is an additional charge. Very helpful staff.

<Title>“I would not stay here again”
<Content>On the surface this hotel presents itself as smart and business like. However get passed reception and the rooms are small and dated with the same limited facilities as a travelodge, just less up to date. I could not bring myself to use the tiny bathroom with yellow hair dryer. I have had better breakfasts in backpackers hostels, the included options was limited and there was no seating. I don't mind basic but this hotel pretends to be more than that and disappoints when you get there. Honesty would be a much better policy.

<Title>“Good Value For Money”
<Content>We have stayed at the St Giles for 3 years running. Very close to the West End theatres & the tube. The rooms are on the small side but we didnt plan on staying in them all day! There is no air con but they have now provided rooms with fans which does seem to help. It can be slightly noisey with the window open but it is the centre of London. The breakfast has a great choice of either full english or continental. As long as you go down early there isnt much of a queue. Any time after 8 in the morning there is a rush which also means that the lifts are slow.All in all a totally adequate, clean hotel which we thinks is good value for money.

<Title>“Terrible hotel - even at the price”
<Content>This is probably the worst hotel I can remember staying in, the reception looks fairly promising, although goodness knows how anyone disabled would manage the steps to it ,but the single room was around 10' x 6' and grubby. No bath just a dirty shower with a broken shower head, Thank goodness it was only for 1 night had it been more I'd have moved, as it was I arrived at about 10 pm so had no time to find another place. The lift service in the morning was laughable and took around 6/7 minutes to turn up. Overall a terrible hotel and I got the feeling from other residents that they shared this view.

<Title>“Good budget Hotel, for Central London”
<Content>I have always used this hotel, after I left living in London. It is clean and staff helpful, plastic stirrers in rooms instead of spoons, I did not like. Hot breakfasts were cold. Rooms are okay, bathrooms a bit tired not all with bath. Generally a good located spot. I think from now though, I will stay in Richmond and tube in, Richmond House Hotel is lovely and with Parking, but this is due to how dirty London now seems.

<Title>“Excellent Location”
<Content>Dont expect too much for the price, the rooms are very small but ideal if you are just looking for a bed for the night. People complained about the noise from outside but there isn't a lot you can do in the middle of London! The main thing that lets it down in not enough lifts, people were waiting over 15 minutes on higher floors for the lift. Breakfast you need to get there early, there are queues for hot food if you leave it too late but the selection is excellent for the price you pay. If you want to leave your bags in reception after checking out they will charge you a fee. Would recommend for somewhere in easy reach of everything.... I will defiantely use this hotel again

<Title>“Very compact but convenient and clean”
<Content>It is the rooms that are compact, not the hotel, which is a huge 1960s concrete horror (architecturally only... read on!!). We got a huge discount which put a very different spin on the place. If we had paid full price I think I would have found the lack of air conditioning (although there was a cool air fan, thankfully!) and the minute scale of the room a bit of a let down. For what we paid, though, it was good enough and clean and reasonably equipped. The shower was fine and the hotel restaurants were alright as well, although the mass catering for breakfast is a sight to behold, being the rather like the United Nations on an especially well attended day. The staff were more friendly and helpful than I would have expected from a central London location and it is that central location that really makes the place worthwhile, you are 3 minutes walk from the British Museum and the tube station is just across the road. If you can get a good price and cope with a small room, then I think you could do a lot worse. Less noise than expected too.

<Title>“Enjoyable Stay”
<Content>Having read a lot of these reviews after I had booked the hotel I was expecting to see a hotel that was filthy! Infact it was very clean, everybody was very friendly and helpful, there was plenty of choice for breakfast and lifts didn't seem slow to us and we were on the 8th floor. The rooms were hot but they were only somewhere to sleep I wasn't expecting to stay in room all day so that was fine. It was noisy but then again we weren't in the country so what do you expect! It was close to all theatres and they were all within walking distance and the shopping was great. As a family we could not fault this hotel and would certainly go back again. People obviously want 5 star luxury for 3 star price!!

<Title>“Great for a Theatre/Shopping trip to London”
<Content>I was really impresssed with this hotel considering the location and the price we paid. Central location is fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool, which was an added bonus. Stones throw from Oxford st, China Town, Theatre's, Sights etc. Room was small, (never had a large room in central London hotel tho!!) but very nice & clean. I would definately recommend this hotel, it's is a great base for a break in london if you want value for money and a great location. I thought the buffet breakfast was good also, great variety available, just help yourself. We are coming back here to stay for another christmas shopping/threatre break this year.

<Title>“Good Value for Money”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel on a Hen Weekend for one night. We checked in early, and were allocated rooms straight away which was brilliant. The reception staff were very helpful and ensured that most of us were able to stay on the same floor. The lifts in the hotel are incredibly slow and don't work properly (we pressed to go down and we went up). The room was tidy and fairly clean. One complaint was the shower which wouldn't drain properly and the water wasn't very hot. The Concierge was always very helpful, and able to call us 3 taxis, which weren't very expensive. The Concierge also has a large room for left luggage, which was very useful for when we went out after having checked out and waited for our Limo home. As part of our stay we went to watch Dirty Dancing at the Aldwich Theatre, which didn't take long to get to so the hotel was conveniently located. I thought the Breakfast wasn't very good and pretty basic, (long queues at peak times- about 9-10) I didn't even see any toast available and the orange juice wasn't very nice. All in all for what we needed the hotel was fine, there were just a few things that could be improved.

<Title>“Great location and excellent value for money”
<Content>Location was of paramount importance to us and after reading some reviews I was not expecting much else. I am pleased to say that I was wrong!! We were able to check in early with the help of a smiling receptionist, the conciege was weloming and all the staff we came into contact with were friendly and helpful. We had 2 twin rooms on the second floor and both were of reasonable size - they also fronted on to Bedford Ave which was a very quiet road so we were able to leave the windows open all night. The rooms were clean, extra towels were provided and the shower was perfectly adequate. We went for breakfast at 8.30 and did not have to queue. The breakfast was good, hot and had a lot of choice. I would certainly stay again.

<Content>After reading some of the reviews I was extremely nervous when we arrived at the Hotel especially as I was the one who had chosen the Hotel in the first place. Check in was v ery quick and pleasant and they even let us check in early. The rooms were clean and adequate for our needs. Can't understand people complaining about the size of the room what on earth are they wanting to do in there? There was plenty of menu choices at breakfast time and the bar in the evening did a lovely Pimms and Lemonade. The staff were all very friendly and I would come back here again when I visit London. An excellent base right in the centre of the city

<Title>“Great hotel, good location and an amazing breakfast”
<Content>I have stayed in the St Giles hotel 3 times now. It is very conveniently located, right by Centre Point and about a 2 minute walk from Oxford Street. The rooms are clean, but if you are a couple staying there, make sure you have a twin room as the double rooms are a lot smaller than the twin rooms. The best thing about the hotel is the breakfast, so make sure that when you book breakfast is included. There is a choice of rolls and croissants, then there's fruit and yoghurt, also full English. There's many choices of tea and coffee and also hot chocolate and cold drinks. The only downside to the hotel in the lifts (elevators). It can take a long time to get there sometimes. I think that the hotel can accommodate at least a thousand people. I found the price for this hotel average for what you get in London.

<Content>As with every business hotel in London it seems, the rooms at this hotel too, are so small you have to step out to change your mind. Thankfully we were able to upgrade to a junior suite. Other than that the hotel is absolute OK. Location is great, no need to take the tube to go shopping. The access to swimming pool and exercise facility must be one of a kind in central London.

<Title>“Great for a one or two night stay-don't be put off!”
<Content>This is the second time I have stayed here, with two different groups. For a short visit to London, it's a great place. Check-in was efficient and we could check in a midday. the rooms were as requested and very clean, Small, yes but what do you expect for £80 a night b&b in central London? I have learnt never to book a single as all hotels seem to offer cupboard space for these rooms, wherever you go in the world!. We were in the breakfast room by 7:45 on Friday morning and there was plenty of space,There also seemed to be more tables than on our previous visit. I have also stayed on a weekend and found it ok. Breakfast was plentiful, a choice of continental meats, fruit, cereals, and a hot selection, it was back bacon too, not that streaky rubbish I've had in other places! If I were to spend a longer period of time in London it would be better to have a bigger room and a view from a window which opened and I can understand tourists who are on organised tours being disappointed with some aspects of the St Giles, there is no room service, the windows don't open very far, the rooms are very small and there is a lot of noise outside.It can also be very warm as there is no air-conditioning in the standard rooms and you have to balance this with the noise from the street. However, for those of you who have already booked and are worried, it's nowhere near as bad as some reviews make out, especially if you have just booked for somewhere to rest your head for a night in central London.

Also when I complained about the room which was tiny I was told they only have one room adapted for wheel chair users (the hotel has over 700 rooms). The location was excellent for the westend. The price was a little high for the room sizes

<Title>“Not the best Hotel or room”
<Content>We stayed at the St Giles for one night in July. I had requested info on the car parking prices on my booking request but got no reply, when i checked in the guy commented "oh you want to know how much car parking is ...ask him (conciege) he will sort out a discount" - he couldn't. The room was so small that the door would not open far enought to get the cases through (and they were only pull along overnight cases!) the bedding was clean - but i was not convinced anything else was.... There was only one, very dim, light in the bathroom so that when you closed the shower curtain you were showering in the dark! I wish that i had spent an extra £20 or so (the double room was £90) and stayed somewhere nicer!!

<Title>“Enjoyable stay”
<Content>I was a little worried having read some reviews. We arrived hours before the booking in time and were expecting to leave our luggage with the concierge, however when we arrived at the desk the concierge suggested we try and check in. The receptionist was most heplful and looked up our room which was ready so we checked in. The room was small but had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and the bedding very clean, as was the bathroom allthough small it was pristine. On the downside it was noisy with the window open but that is what you expect in that location, poloce sirens and theatre goers were to blame. We ended up closing the window at 1.30am. There was a fan provided. Breafast was busy self service but catered for all tastes.We used the stairs except for when we had cases it was quicker than waiting for a lift. It just goes to show how different travellers experiences can be!

<Title>“great value and would stay here again”
<Content>Great location - a 2 min walk to tottenham court road tube station, in walking distance of covent garden/leics square/theatres. Check in went fine, we were a large group, the staff were friendly and even though it was very busy they took time to arrange us rooms on the same floor. The rooms werent ready straight away but this wasnt a problem as one room was available so we could put our bags in there whilst we went to see the show. We has a mixture of twin rooms and single rooms, yes the rooms rooms are small but more than adequate for a wkd in london, if you want big luxurious rooms, then you will have to pay the price!. The rooms were very clean and comfortable bed. Ladies, remember to take your own hairdryer though as the one in the room is very old fashioned!. Lots of choice at breakfast, full english, cereals, crossiants etc. Check out was at 11am, but you pay an extra £20.00 to keep a room til the evening. If you are going out for the day and dont want to take your bags, then you can pay a pound to the concierge who will store them and give you a ticket for collection. There is a nice area with settees in reception, and although we didnt use the hotel bar, it was modern and looked very popular. I would come back to this hotel and would recommend it, but not for a romantic break where you want luxury.

<Content>Rude, rude, rude! There was no service to speak of at all. The hotel staff was the rudest I have come across in my many years of traveling. I am a budget traveler and have stayed in many hostels and cheap hotels but this takes the biscuit! I had cleaner bedding when sleeping in stilt huts in the Amazon. In fact the walls were thicker there too. After one night of listening to my neighbours enjoying their stay, I decided it was time to leave! That plus the hairs in the bed and bathroom were enough to make me want to go to a YHA! Run, run for the hills.....in fact save your money from not staying in this hotel and you'll be able to take a cab there!

<Title>“Overpriced Thai Prison Style Rooms”
<Content>If you end up there with a single room and can't find another hotel in time try to get the older room. They're more like western prison cells in size. Only tiny luggage will actually fit into the room. In the renovated single rooms the toilet is only separated from the rest of the room via a thin curtain. So if you ate mexican, you and your clothes WILL stink the next day! Other guests solved that by sleeping in the lobby or using the public bathroom in the lobby. Your sink is inside the shower which is a tiny area by itself. And judging by the position of the sink it is only designed to wash your private parts. The room is basically a long narrow chute leading up to a tiny bed area and on the way there you pass the curtained bathroom. No in-room Internet and it'll be £10 a day only in the lobby! Phone system has terrible quality, you can barely hear the other person, vending machines don't work properly and their cooling is off way too often to save them money (as one of the maids told me after I had 2 warm Evians in a row). The corner rooms get all the smell from the thai kitchen directly into the room if you open the window. If you don't open the window over night you'll wake up with a headache because the room is too small for the oxygen needs of an adult.

<Content>Unfortunately, we hit London during a terrible heat wave. However, while everyone else in our group enjoyed rooms that required blankets during the hot nights, our room was like a blast furnace. We made daily requests for 3 days and for 3 days nothing was done to make things comfortable. We were finally able to get the mgmt. to open the window, which helped a little; however, since it overlooked the local train stop, it wasn't too quiet. It's a very inconvenient distance from central London, taking about 35-40 minutes to reach the city during non-rush hour traffic. Breakfast was good and reasonable, although we ate no other meals there.

<Title>“GREAT LOCATION AND BRILLIANT VALUE HOTEL”
<Content>Got to say I was quite impressed with the St Giles. Checked in early in my room at 11.30am which was a bonus. Room (double) was small but very clean. Big plus point is the Sainsburys central which is a 30second walk from the hotel which is ideal for cheap snacks and drinks. They sell warm bacon baguettes for £1.50 which is a big saving on the £9.95 the hotel wanted for the buffett breakfast. Other plus points are the nice bar downstairs and the on-site gym in the basement and of course the 5min walk to the west end etc. Minus points are the rooms are a bit small for 2 people and the lifts can be really slow at times, the outside noise can be quite loud and the lack of air conditioning in the rooms. Will definitely be staying again though on my next visit to London.

<Content>Perfectly happy with my stay at the St Giles, don't quite understand why there are so many bad reviews. Checked in an hour early with no queue (on a Wednesday), quickly got room key (although the receptionist seemed to insist on speaking to my mother instead of me even though I was the one paying - I know I look young but even so)! Didn't have to wait for a lift going up, had to wait a few minutes coming down each time but we were on the 11th floor so that was to be expected. The room was very clean, lovely size, with opening windows (noisy on the Tottenham Ct Rd side but what can you expect in such a prime location in the middle of London). Nice little bathroom - small but it had a shower, sink and toilet so what more could you need! The whole hotel was stiflingly hot but we went on one of the hottest days of the year (easily 32c outside). There was a fan in the room (though make sure you have a proper look around when you get in as we didn't find this till the next morning)! They could do with investing in air conditioning for the hotter months, even if only in the reception/restaurant areas. Breakfast was ok. Wouldn't rave about it but they had a good selection - full English, cereals, fruit, yogurt etc. Only complaint I have here is one that could be applied to many UK hotels - I am lactose intolerant so therefore have either lactose free or soya milk with my cereal. I asked a (foreign) member of staff if they had this because I'm lactose intolerant and she said sorry, we don't have skinny milk, we only use semi-skimmed! She thought I was asking for low-fat milk (!) - I couldn't get through to her that drinking normal milk made me ill, which just frustrated me! I went to Sweden recently - they have lactose free milk behind the counter that you just have to ask for - great! UK hotels should follow suit. Other than that little gripe, great stay at this hotel. It's perfect for being central to West End theatres (this was my reason for staying) but it's literally 10 steps from Oxford St for shopping heaven too, and just across the road is Soho Square - a rare green bit of London - which was perfect for relaxing in the London heat waiting for shows to start. And, if you happen to go up soon, you'll have the pleasure of one of the many park pianos that have been placed across the city, where anyone can just walk up to it and start entertaining you!

<Title>“Great Location - Shame About The Hotel”
<Content>The twin room was tiny, bathroom was extremely tiny and the shower unit !! - well I think swinging a cat comes to mind. I must highlight the fact that I did ask on 2 occasions that something be done about the noisey, wobbly bed. Neither my friend nor I got any sleep during our weekend break to London because of this. I did threaten to take the mattress off the bed and sleep on the floor but things were made worse when I saw the state of the heavily stained mattress. Decent breakfast but breakfast room (cafeteria) was very tired and shabby.

<Title>“Room not ready on arrival”
<Content>Arrived at 2pm to be told that room was not ready and could not be given a time. As we had a flight booked on the London Eye and tickets for Oliver, we had to leave our luggage at the concierge desk with not chance of freshening up for our afternoon and evening out. We did not get to see the room until we arrived back at midnight. The only plus that we had as we had a room for 3 adults, at least we had 2 rooms but they were small. The bathroom was unbelievably small with a shower that did not have a nonslip floor (I felt very unsafe). There was a fan, thank goodness as the room was hot, no extractor fan in the bathroom and opening the windows was a non-starter (traffic noise), however to plug the fan in we had to move a unit and unplug the TV. The last trip down to lobby resulted in a 10-minute wait for a lift (on the 8th floor so did not fancy the stairs). The lifts were small and 6 people plus cases were enough to stop anyone else getting on. Pluses - a few. Central, breakfast OK but busy. Lazy Dog bar - excellent Would I use it again - extremely unlikely

<Title>“Glad I wasn't paying!”
<Content>I stayed for one night on business, so I had not booked the hotel myself. The lobby of the hotel is deceptive, giving a good impression to guests. I was shocked though when I arrived on my floor. When the lift doors finally open, something reminicent of my university halls of residence is revealed. A pink carpet which does not fit the floor properly in drab hallway. My room was a double, but i was glad I was staying alone as there would not be enough room for two women to get ready in a room of that size. The TV was so old that the symbols on the rubber buttons had all worn off, so it took some guess work to operate it. It was an old style tv with a big back, so when I opened the window I nearly whacked the tv onto the floor. The traffic is loud and the room is hot, so one or the other must be endured before sleep. The location of the hotel is excellent, so traffic noise can be expected, which is why proper air conditioning should also be expected by the traveller. For me though the real disappointment was the bathroom. I have a bit of a fear of nasty bathrooms. Small spaces, noisy pipes and poor lighting, leave me feeling very anxious, so I'm afraid I didn't manage a long shower at this hotel. The shower was built into a cubicle space in the bathroom, which meant that when the shower curtain was shut there was no light. Tired and old fashioned bathroom, and tired dated room. I have stayed in travelodges and etaps which were much cheaper and much nicer.

<Title>“Great location... everything you need for a city break.”
<Content>Stayed at St Giles Hotel beginning June 2009. This hotel is huge 11 floors and I think it has 1000 bed rooms. The rooms are quite small and compact... but they are very clean. They deliver everything you could want for a weekend break. Although they do not provide irons in the rooms. But they have designated ironing rooms. The only downfall of this hotel is that at times we waited almost 5-10 minutes for the elevator. We were on the 9th floor, so facing the stairs was a challenge. There are four elevators for 1000 rooms, so atpeak times the elevators were really busy. Reception was large and all the staff we met were very efficient. However the whole lacks any personal touch, it's very impersonal and you can easily feel like a number. Breakfast takes on a buffet format, very much help yourself attire. Nice and simple. The location is great. Right next to Central Point. Tottenham Court Road Underground. Also right beside the 'We Will Rock You Theatre'. Just round the corner from Soho. The location was a great selling point. The hotel always semmed to be well staffed. Always a concierge on to help. The Bar attached to the hotel is very nice. We did not dine within the hotel - except breakfast - hence I cannot comment on the restaurants. Overall, simple, large - but nice.

<Title>“Basic central London accommodation”
<Content>This place is in a great location a dew mins walk from Tottenham Court Road Tube and very close to main theatre areas. It is however basic, ie very small shower, no bath, small beds and rooms and decor wise is stuck in 1992! If you are looking for somewhere convenient and you are not bothered about the frills and luxuries such as flat screen tv etc, it's ok. Feels a bit like a youth hostel. They need to get better lifts though as itd fine going up but you seem to wait an age to go down. It's never more than £100 for a basic room though so for central London is Ok. You can get more for your £ though if you head out to somewhere like Bayswater.

<Content>Stayed at the St Giles recently and was really happy to see a great deal for breakfast and great service from the staff. Managed to get my room inc breakfast with HC (link below) who seem to have some kind of offer on here. The location is great and the staff are friendly and helpful, the hotel is a little old and worn but for this location at this price its certainly a good option for the £100 a night mark. http://www.hotelsclick.com/index.php?&country=UNITED_KINGDOM&city=LONDON&hotel=ST._GILES&hotel_id=4806&distributor=Tripadvisor

<Content>We were on the 9th floor, the room was tiny, but clean, and as we werent in it that much it wasnt a real problem. It was also quiet which I really like whilst away. The buffet breakfast I thoroughly enjoyed and thought was of a high standard. Didnt get info from desk staff re breakfast etc... But managed to find out own way easy enough. This hotel has easy access to lots of transport.

<Title>“dont be shocked!”
<Content>Thats what the receptionist told us as we went to look at a single room! We thought we had booked 2 doubles. We were shocked!! Room was tiny on the corner of the building and very claustrophobic. Receptionist was very helpful and managed to move us to two twin rooms which were fine. Rooms were clean. No noise from the hotel but very noisy when window open but cant be helped in central London! Ideally situated for everything touristy. Breakfast was fine. Staff very helpful and friendly. Would use again for an overnight stay.

<Title>“Better than expected...”
<Content>Booked this hotel months ago, for a two night midweek break, then read the reviews which made me worry a little. However had booked an executive double which was just as the pictures, with a lovely big modern shower room, marble walls and spotlessly clean. We were on the 9th floor at the back and were not bothered by noise at all. The rooms were warm but we had the benefit of air con which we spotted the second day! The room wasn't huge but just right, very comfortable and with a digital TV on the wall. When I looked on the map of our floor I could see how small some of the rooms were-literally half the size so I can see what people mean about room size. We didn't realise until we got to our room that we were entitled to an 'executive' breakfast. This turned out to be in the Japanese restaurant and was lovely, with a choice of hot breakfasts which were served to our table after we had helped ourselves to cereal, juice, croissants etc. There were only half a dozen people in at the most so very quiet. That was on the first morning. Second morning, arrived to find that due to technical problems there was no executive breakfast so we were directed to the main buffet breakfast which was ok because it wasn't that busy. I soon came to realise though that we had been spoiled the previous day as the food wasn't as good quality, I had cereal and the milk was sour, I pointed this out to a member of staff who told me where there was another milk machine but unfortunately this was also sour. My partner had the cooked breakfast which looked ok though and the coffee was alright. I must say though that other than this we had a good stay. Reception were polite and efficient, although queues were a little slow at busy times, concierge very helpful, lifts were always busy but we didn't have long to wait, the hotel is perfectly situated for the West End and compared to other hotels in central London that we priced up, I would say that this is great value for money. We also tried the hotel bar and found it to be cheaper than some of the bars we had been in in the surrounding area and had the benefit of waitress service. We would stay here again without doubt.

<Title>“Choose another hotel if you have the option”
<Content>I was booked into this hotel on a business trip, so did not voluntarily choose to stay here. Its location is right in the heart of the tourist zone: at the corner of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street, so all the theatres and China Town/Soho is on its doorstep. However, this optimum location for sight-seeing is not great if you are trying to get to sleep as the road outside is very noisy all night long (even with ear plugs) making it impossible to leave the window open. I suspect it would be stifling in the summer, as there is no air conditioning. The check-in was painfully slow and as the hotel has crammed in as many rooms as possible into its square footprint, this makes the lift service inadequate: be prepared to wait a long time or use the (hidden-away) stairs. I have stayed in hotels all over the globe but was deeply disappointed at my room given the price (£70+). I couldn't quite touch both walls of my room with my hands outstretched, but not far off. The single room was so tiny that it reminded me of a cabin on a ferry - especially the microscopic bathroom (opening the door of the bathroom would remove the knees of anybody sitting on the toilet!). In addition, the cistern of my toilet had a constant overflow into the shower unit, so the noise of this dribble did not aid my sleep. The quality of the food at breakfast was OK but it's a mad canteen service where you grab some food and try and find a space to sit next to other guests. The cleaner came to do my room at 8.20am and at 8.30am, somebody came to try and clean the inside window! At this point, I gave up and left. I did not sleep well here. I did not enjoy my stay and I was not in a good mood for my meeting. Sorry, but I can't recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Would not go back”
<Content>I stayed in St Giles Hotel from 30th April to 2nd May, I work in a Hotel myself, so I know what to expect. Check in was slow-20mins-no information given by male receptionist re breakfast, directions to rooms, bar, facilities etc. Room was tiny, no room to "Swing a Cat"! It was clean but not worth 74GBP per night for a single room. Bar man and concierge were friendly, this was only redeeming feature. This hotel lacks class and friendliness. Only thing good about it was its' location. Poor value for money and poor rooms. I never write a review but felt compelled to this time.

<Title>“Not for me”
<Content>Yes the St Giles is in a great location with easy access to the tube, but that is all the good news. We stayed one night and I found the room to be small, musty, and loud. The cupboards are not finished and the carpeting needs to be replaced. The hallway on the first floor has patches taken out with duct tape holding it down. Breakfast was plentiful but very busy.

The breakfast is lovely but at busy times, no place to sit! All in all, i would go back again as its in an excellent location. Just at the end of oxford street which is the main shopping area.

<Title>“excellent position”
<Content>A london hotels go i would recommend this one as excellent value. The rooms are a little on the small side - but most people don't spend much time in their room when in london. Breakfast was included which was a bonus. Choice of cooked or cold but very busy so a bit of a fight for seats! Try coming back 5 minetes later as it could be half empty then! The position is ideal for the centre of london. Only a few minetes walk from tottenham court road tube and walking distance to oxford street. I would use this hotel again.

<Content>I stayed for one night with a friend when we went to see Phantom Of The Opera. We had a twin room that was ample enough in size for two of us for the duration of our trip. In all honesty, who stays in the hotel room when on a city break?? Service was excellent from check in to check out. Extra pillows were supplied when requested. Rooms were all clean. We had a bath tub with a shower over which was lovely and warm. Yes there was noise, but the hotel is in the heart of the West End not in the country! Double glazing did its best to curb the street noise. This hotel is great for a short break, breakfast was ample and if you have a lay in like we did, we missed the rush and walked straight up to the buffet. Would stay here again if on a short break.

<Title>“Great for one nights stay - not so good for a holiday”
<Content>I stayed at the St Giles Hotel on a recent business trip. For me it was exactly what I needed - a clean bed and a clean bathroom. BUT - I wouldn't want to stay here for more than one night. The rooms, although clean, are small. The rooms were a bit hot too - with only the window to use for ventilation. The bathroom was also compact (shower cubicle only - no bath). I could maybe manage two nights here if i was on holiday - any more and I would try and get somewhere that has a bit more room. Breakfast was actually quite good. Considering there are about 600 rooms (12 floors with about 50 rooms on each floor), the breakfast service needs to be quick (which it was). Yes, it is a self-service buffet, but it does contain all you need for a sensible breakfast. The location is great if you are a tourist (being on business the location doesn't bother me). The tube station is very close by. Oxford street (great for shopping) is on your doorstep, and the west end for all those theatre shows is around the corner too.

<Content>I found the room to be a bit on the small side (no cat swinging room). If you suffer from claustraphobia this is NOT the place for you. Apart from that it is very handy for the Underground/buses & West end Theatre. Rooms clean and tidy. Staff polite and courtious. Breakfast is very good, plenty of variety, food for the skinny freaks to eat along side the full English if you fancy that. I personally would not stay there again. I don't have a problem with the hotel but I like my room to be a bit bigger.

<Title>“Little Boxes”
<Content>OMG, I did not realize that a building that has rooms this small could legally call itself a Hotel. However, If all you want is a bed for the night then this hotel is ideally located at the top of Tottenham Court Road. Oxford Street is 2 mins away and most of the West End Theaters are within walking distance. Could not fault the breakfast or the selection. You need to be an early riser however if you want to avoid the queuing. Overall, it suited our purpose, but I would not stay for a week!!

<Title>“perfect place for a short visit”
<Content>St Giles is perfectly situated for visits to theatres, Covent garden central attractions and shopping trips. By London standards it is very good value. We travelled down by train from the Midlands into Euston Station. Travel mid week and mid day and get amazing deals from Rail Easy. The hotel was a short taxi ride away, another bonus. We checked in very quickly but it was mid afternoon. There were queues in the evenings. Our double room on the 6th floor was small but had everything we needed. If you are on the large side it might be a bit of a squeeze in the bathroom. The room was clean and the view was what you would expect from a central City hotel but at least it was quiet. The bed was a small double, we have different ideas to the Americans what a double is but again it was adequate for our 2 night stay. We had a show on the first night so decided to eat in the Hotel and the Italian Restaurant offered a reasonable menu and our choice was well cooked and presented and enjoyable. So good in fact that we ate again the following night. Was not impressed with the bar area. Did not try the Breakfasts which apparently only offered a fixed rate Buffet style. My Wife is only a small breakfast eater so we chose to take an early morning walk down to Covent garden, took about 15 minutes, and ate at the Ponti Restaurant which was excellent. We like to walk and found we could cover all the Theatre area, the Embankment, Westminster, London Eye, Trafalgar Sq, Piccidilly circus, Oxford St, Shaftesbury Av etc. For that reason alone I would recommend this hotel. Even if you dont care to walk there is a tube station within a few yards that will link you to all the underground system. Our final show was "We will Rock You" at the Dominion. Thats brilliant by the way.And that entailed our shortest walk as its only about 200 yards away, a real Bonus.

<Title>“Excellent Location, But..”
<Content>This is a late review, but my friend and I stayed at this hotel for one night last june for a shopping weekend. The location of this hotel is excellent!!! One minute walk from underground station, sainsbury's across the road aswel as a McDonalds. The rooms are very small, but are fine just for the one night. The shower room was VERY VERY small, and we found that it hadn't been cleaned properly from the previous people that stayed. Breakfast was included in the cost, but had a very good variety!! Small cereal boxes, aswel as bacon, pastries, beans etc. There is a swimming pool at the hotel, but is at an extra cost. We stayed on a Saturday night, and they had a special offer for a late check out (2pm) on the Sunday at a charge of £15 which we done and found was very useful!!

<Title>“Heres the thing its not that bad!!”
<Content>Stayed at St Giles on the night of the 14th March 09 with a group of friends for a 50th Birthday celebration. Having read loads of bad reviews I feared for the worst. When we arrived reception was a bit busy but the staff were very polite, warm natured and apologised that we couldnt check in until 2pm so we left our cases with a helpful concierge. Then we went to the see Priscilla Queen of the Desert which was a brilliant show very flamboyant and glam. On the return to the hotel, we were checked in quickly and found our room to be spacious, clean, tidy, big enough for two girls and all our clothes. The beds were firm and linen clean and crisp. There was plenty of tea and coffee and a tv that worked and was big enough for the room. The bathroom was fine, a bit old but clean and compact, plenty of hot water, mini toiletries, tissues etc and plenty of clean towels. The shower was hot and the heating in the room was a little warm so we turned it down. We went out for dinner and returned to the hotel bar in the early hours and got waiter service as we were staying at the hotel. Slept well and the next day had a good hearty hot breakfast, the dining room was very busy and manic but it was 10 a clock on a Sunday morning and I was starving so didnt care!! The food was good and tasty. Check out was quick. So all in all no grumbles apart from canteen style breakfast similar to eating at a Ikea cafe on a busy Saturday afternoon, would stay again and would recommend.

<Title>“Great Location, Good hotel”
<Content>Was able to check in earlier than time stated on website, as room was ready. I was staying with my 15 yr old daughter and had a double room (567) (booked a double by mistake!) which was small but adequate for a 2 night stay. The room was clean & tidy on our arrival and as we were only there for 2 nights, we didn't need the room cleaned again and made sure the maid didn't go to the trouble, though she offered us clean towels & asked if we needed anything else. The room was quite cosy, but not stuffy in my opinion, though I do like a warm room! Bathroom, small but again adequate, good shower and enough toiletries for the stay. Had breakfast on the Saturday morning about 10 am, restaurant busy but all the breakfast items were replaced as soon as it was used up. Much the same on Sunday morning, maybe a bit busier but again the staff worked well providing breakfast and tidying up, very efficiently. Reception area looks impressive but the corridors (carpets, walls, paintwork etc) looked worn out. Didn't use the bar, restaurant or pool this time though stayed here last year and found the bar & restaurant ok for a few drinks in the evening as a nightcap. Thought the hotel was very good value for money at less than £200 for 2 nights B&B in the centre of London. It really is a very central hotel, 5 mins from Oxford St. for shopping, 5 mins from the nearest tube station, short walk or taxi ride to theatreland. I will definately use this hotel again and would recommend to anybody.

<Title>“Had a pleasant stay”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel for three nights. The room was clean and fresh, and not at all cramped.It was very warm on the first night, but the next two nights were fine. The breakfast was great, and yes, the dining room was very busy, but surely this is to be expected from a hotel in the heart of London? I was impressed by how quickly and efficiently the hotel delivered breakfast to so many people. The choice was wide and the food was fine. The hotel is what i would describe as basic and functional, but where it excels is in its location. It is great, really in the heart of everything. I did experience a small problem in that our towels and toilet paper weren't replaced on once occassion but I phoned reception and both were delivered very quickly. All in all I had a good stay. However one thing that did ruin my stay was the rip off taxi fare I was charged to take me to the train station from the hotel. The concierge summoned someone he knew with a people carrier to take some of my party to the train station. We were charged 3 times as much for the trip compared to others in my group who took exactly the same journey in a registered black cab, so be warned!

<Title>“I wouldn't house my dog here!”
<Content>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not ruin your trip by staying at this hotel. I arrived after being on the go for 12 hours in a day. All I wanted was to relax for an hour or two and then maybe go out. I couldn't because I could hear drilling and banging. The room was dirty with bad lighting and there was a bad smell in the hallway. I had to escape and leave the hotel room and not come back until after 9pm because I was shattered and thought I might be able to just sleep and get the bad thoughts of the hotel out of mind. What a Joke that was... It was freezing cold in an uncomfortable bed. I managed to walk into the doorway of the bathroom twice during my one night stay such was the tight nature of the room... And I wasn't even drunk. The only way I would think about it would be if I needed somewhere to store my luggage close to Tottenham Court Road and Leicester Square.

<Title>“I've never checked into and then out of a hotel so fast before - never again!”
<Content>I have never checked into and then out of a hotel before and I'm pretty tolerant of most small oversights but this hotel was truly awful. I had looked on line and selected a "mini-suite" - the rate was significantly reduced. On check in I confirmed that I had a double bed and a bath. On arrival in the room I found the room to be grubby, the sink didnt empty, and the toilet didnt flush. I called down to ask if I had been given the correct room. The reception told me that it was the correct room, denied that I'd been told that I'd have a bath or a double bed and that they had no other rooms with that air of helpless finality. Mini suite ? - more like a small room divided by a wall with a grubby chair and a desk between the bed and the bathroom (cracked tiles, tired shower and NO bath -arghhh) I rang a nearby hotel and went down to reception - checking out Sir? Yes please - my room is not acceptable - we have several other rooms for you to try - are any of them clean or have a bath? No Sir - we dont have baths in most of our rooms. I checked out and walked a short distance to another hotel. I dont know if they charged me at the St Giles - if they refund me the money I'm happy to dontate it to charity. I wouldnt stay there again or recommend it to anyone. urghhhh - nasty... nasty.... experience. Peter

<Title>“Good location. Mediocre hotel.”
<Content>First, the positives: Good location--right around the corner from the Tottenham Court Rd tube station, a couple of blocks from the British Museum, walking distance to some OK restaurants and pubs, down the block from a grocery store and chemist. Affordably priced for central location. Access to big YMCA with excellent fitness facilities. Second, the negatives: Loaded with badly behaved tour groups. Room not ready for check in as arranged, leading to logistical problems for us. Miniscule, badly lighted bathroom with faucets that would not turn off. Mildew in the shower. Had to go get towels from the housekeeping cart several times because they weren't replaced. Small, cramped, not-too-clean room with bad lighting and no temperature control. Uncomfortable bed and old, lumpy pillows. School cafeteria style breakfast buffet was crowded any time of morning and not worth the hassle. Concierge desk gave downright incorrect directions several times. Not enough internet access for a hotel this size, with only two terminals available for hire in the lobby (hogged by unsupervised teenagers whenever we tried to check email). No designated smoking area outside, so we often walked through cloud of smoke on the pavement coming and going from the hotel. Long wait for elevators made getting to and from high floor an annoyance. If you only need a place to shower and sleep, and you don't mind the problems noted, the St. Giles might work for you. Otherwise, stay someplace else.

<Title>“This hotel is TRULY terrible”
<Content>This was not really a hotel, it was a hostel. The rooms were tiny, decor was severely dated and the room was dirty. We stayed for two nights, they completely failed to clean the room on the second day. We had to phone to request clean towels etc. The breakfast resembled a school canteen arrangement and was probably the lowest budget meal I have ever eaten. Brilliant location, but just not worth it.

<Title>“Functional hotel, very cheap and cheerful”
<Content>Stayed in a twin room @ £95 per night, very reasonable considering its location right in the heart of London. If I were to go to a West End show with my partner I would definitely consider this place. The beds were almost comfortable but the rooms were big and clean, not fancy but a good place to stay the night.

<Content>We stayed for 3 nights and walked everywhere. This hotel is in a terrific location. The rooms are really small but very clean. The staff were friendly and helpful and there are very nice couches to sit and relax. The breakfast is good but very canteen style, long queues with tray and huge piles of food which you serve yourself. The coffee is good and ther eis a good variety of juices and cold meats and fruit. I would recommend this hotel because of it's location and value. I will certainly stay here any time I visit London.

<Title>“Much Better than Reviews led me to believe”
<Content>We booked a theatre package last year for 'Oliver' which included a one night stay in the St Giles Hotel. It was very reasonable for such a centrally located hotel (only a ten minute walk to Drury Lane). We failed to look at the Reviews until the day before we went, and I am glad we didn't read them too early or we might have tried to alter the accommodation, and I think it would have been a shame. The reviews were terrible, so we were expecting the worst. When we arrived we were met at the curb and led to reception. We were an hour early for check-in but got our room on arrival and found the check-in staff friendly and efficient. The room was on the small side but clean and well presented. The bathroom was minute, but we were'nt planning on spending that much time in there. The one dissapointing thing was that despite requesting a 'non-smoking' room there was a distinct nicotine smell about the room. Still I can't blame the staff for the antics of visitors. The room was a little cool, but then it was sub-zero outside. During the night the room was reasonbly quiet for a hotel of this size. The breakfast was a good buffet breakfast with all you could want, and staff were very attentive. I would advise anyone going to get down to breakfast early. We made it down for 7.30 and had a leisurely breakfast, but by 8.00 the queues were just starting to develop. Having now stayed at this hotel I feel the previous reviews were unjustified. No its not the Savoy but then I wasn't paying Savoy prices. For the money I thought it was very good, especially considering its central location.

<Title>“never again”
<Content>We were on a coach outing to see 2 shows in London, the bedrooms were on the small side ok for one night. A meal prior to the evenings show had been booked, and it left a lot to be desired, there was no menu, so we had no idea what to expect, when it came it was just plonked down on the table in silence, some chicken, vegetables and small portion of potatoes. For the men in the party totally inadequate. The sweet was not a lot better, a fruit salad. The buffet breakfast the next day was marginally better. The two shows we saw " Mamma Mia" and "Hairspray" were excellent, highly recommended, made up for the poor hotel.

<Title>“Ok hotel, centrally situated”
<Content>I stayed here for 3 nights in the middle of January. The hotel has a great location at the corner of Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road. You are at a walking distance to many of the most famous sights in London. British Museum is only a five minute's walk away. Shaftsbury Avenue with all the theatres is also very close. So are Soho and Covent Garden. Tottenhan Court Road underground station is right outside the hotel, so for getting around in London, the hotel is a very convenient base. The hotel itself is big with 12 floors and 705 rooms and with only four lifts (one of them not working at the time) it could be a rather long wait sometimes. My room was small and so was the bathroom, but it it was clean and functional. Breakfast was OK and the staff was friendly and helpful. I paid £97 per night which is not bad for a centrally situated hotel in London. All in all everything was OK, but no luxury. I will probably stay here another time as well.

<Title>“very basic overpriced”
<Content>We stayed here as family for 1 night as we could only get theatre tickets if we booked a hotel package. We had 1 double room and 1 twin room. The hotel rooms are clean and if you have to stay here i would advise booking the twin room rather than double as room was bigger. The decor was very dated and unappealing. We werent expecting luxury but it wasnt a treat to stay here. If you owned the tv in the room you would have thrown it out 10 years ago.The bathrooms look clean but smell strongly of urine. The hair dryers are weak and very old fashioned. The concierge are very helpful-the reception staff miserable and disinterested. If you walked into the canteen in the high street you would walk out -its way past its sell by date-ripped faded uninviting furniture.Again the staff were helpful but the food was at best mediocre but you would NOT choose to eat here-plenty of it but surroundings really dampen your appetite! We really wouldnt recommend staying here there are better hotels in London-the experience was fortunately overshadowed by having a great time in London as tourists-but its spoilt when you re not looking forward to coming back to the hotel.

<Title>“Excellent location....not bad hotel for central London”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights over the New Year. As per previous reviews the rooms are very small compared to other hotels we have stayed in but did the job for the 3 nights. Check in was quick for both ourselves and my parents. The lifts were quite slow and you could be waiting a while for one to come. However, the rooms were clean and modern along with the bathroom which also had a good shower and usual provisions. The room also had tea/coffee making faciities and a TV. The room was serviced every morning with the bed made and fresh towels provided. The location was excellent for the city centre with the tube station on the doorstep nearly! We all had good nights sleep to think we were in the middle of the city- the odd sirens could be heard, but you wouldn't expect anything else really. I would recommend the hotel for anyone who is looking for a short break and a good location for a good price.

<Title>“Good Location, but a little else was good”
<Content>We came to London in February half term of last year to see Phantom. We were initially really pleased with the location as it was east to reach and right by the tube station as well as being within easy walking distance of Soho and the West end. However, the room we checked in to (after queueing for about 25 minutes to check in) was small, dingy and hot. We were on the top floor and our room was adjecent to the lift so we heard that whirring every time anyone on any floor called it. The bathroom was clean and provided us with the needed hot shower when you've been walking all day! But was less impressive than your standard travellodge style bathroom. On the first morning we went for breakfast which was like a cattle market and felt like a school canteen, the food was ok but not really worth the money we paid. The whole place had a rather dated feel and didn't inspire us to want to make a return visit. If you want a good location for sightseeing and are not worried about where you crash at night then it's fine, but if you are looking for anything more, look elsewhere.

<Title>“Hotel ? NO. Its a HOSTEL”
<Content>jan 2009. Spent only one night here which was one night too many. Was staying with a group of people so had the opportunity to view other peoples rooms so this is not a biased report- the hotel sure is consistant; consistantly shabby. The day of my return (today) I found out a very interesting fact that this hotel was previously a YMCA hostel .. that equals the standard it is at today and explains the broom cupboard size of the rooms. I am writing my review so soon on my return is because I would like to warn people off staying here. small threadbare bathroom towels (one had a stain on which I swapped) the so-called carpet had the look of a trampled doormat the rooms are barely bigger than the beds the beds are on wheels so if you nudge the bed, or nudge the wall while on the bed it starts rolling didnt feel comfortable in the bed at night. Although the sheets appeared to be clean the valance sheet was clearly not freshly changed because it had black marks around the bottom of it there was no duvet or blankets over the sheet just a limp topcover with a faded pattern on unhygeinic bathroom, the sink and shower had mould around the edges the shower curtain looked old and grey the entrance to the shower was so small it was difficult to not touch the rotton curtain condoms in the hall vending machines I can't tell you about the breakfast because i didnt dare eat any except a bowl of cereal. I went to the canteen area and the croissants were hard and even if I believed the kitchen was clean the cooked food still did not look appetizing.

It was pretty warm inside the hotel but there was a fan in the cupboard; the bathroom was clean as was the room and the breakfast given was very tasty. Good hotel, good location no complaints

<Title>“Great value for Money!”
<Content>We stayed for 2nights at the beginning of December. The location of the hotel is excellent, literally 2 mins walk from the tube Station - Tottenham Court Road. A sainsbury within a 1minute walk, and all the main shopping streets all around us. Location, was key to our stay and the hotel from this perspective gets 5 out of 5. Check in was quick, and from time to time the hotel did experience problems with the lifts, however, this tended to be at key times, eg check in and breakfast. Rooms are small, but I feel you have to take into consideration costs. It had what we needed for 2nights stay, it was clean, tidy and had the facilities we needed. The rooms have showers, and are compact, but its managable for a couple of days. Water was hot, bathroom was clean, so was adequate for our needs. Decor is a dated, and flowery bedspreads are quite bright, this did not affect our stay, as we really just used the room to sleep in!The rooms were really warm, and we did have to open the window for some time. We did not experience any issues with noise. Breakfast does get busy, and they open up the restaurant tables in stages to manage the high number of people that come through the breakfast room. Due to the mixture of european nationalities staying at the hotel, tables were being put together, and there was a selection of both continental and hot breakfast available. All food was hot and plentiful. Hotel does offer 2 evening restaurants, would give these a miss, as they are not open at the times that they should be. I did not pay a 5* price to stay at the hotel, and feel that we did receive value for money. I would stay at the hotel again in the future. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me.

<Title>“Zero Service”
<Content>This is by far THE worst hotel I have stayed at in recent years and served as a reminder of similar experiences when staying in East Bloc country hotels during the communist era. Five nights without a single smile from the sour faced staff. Five nights in one of the smallest room one can imagine.Absolutely zero value for money with the so called breakfast being the ''highlight'' and worse than a school canteen. This is not a hotel but a sleep only factory for those willing to put up with zero service.

<Title>“Would stay again!!”
<Content>I have just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel, i was a little worried to what it was going to be like after reading some of the reviews on here but the hotel was not that bad and i would most likely stay again. Check in was fast and staff were friendly and helpfull. The rooms were fairly small but fine for the amount of time we spent in there but they were clean and cleaned everyday, the only thing was the bathroom which was very old and in need of a change and the hairdryer was terrible so i would recommend taking your own. The noise wasnt too bad and both me and my friend slept well but i suspose if your a light sleeper it could be bad. Breakfast was ok but there wasnt a great deal of choice, just a small selection of cereals, bread rolls, croissants, beans, scrambeld eggs, hash brown,sausage and bacon but it was all nice enough. The hotel was in a great location only a few mins walk to most places and the nearest tube was more or less just across the road.

<Title>“Great location, not a bad hotel!”
<Content>The St. Giles Hotel has a great location (2 minutes walking to Oxford Street, 5 minutes walking to the british Museum, 10 minutes walking to Covent Garden, 5 to 10 minutes walking to the Soho or Chinatown...) and it was not too expensive. that is why we decided to expend 3 nights there between 5 and 8 December 2008. The lobby was quite nice, and the check-in was fast the people at the reception really nice. For instance, we did not have to pay anything neither in advance upon the reservatrion through internet nor upon our arrival, but only at the end (it was something many other hotels in london asked us for, in some Corporate apartments they even asked us to pay 100% 4 weeks in advance!!). The rooms were small but comfy. However, no extra bed could have been fitted since there was very little place left. There was a table for working and a very small wardrobe (this is what I disliked the most, since it was a open wardrobe, more like selves actually, and I didn't like having my clothes there... Other thing was that the safety box didn'y work, so we had to carry always all our money with us). The bath was pretty small too. However, it was very clean, the room was cleaned daily, the towels were changed and the bathroom facilities replaced. Considering the short time you would be in the hotel in such an interesting place as London, having a small room is not a problem. Instead, having almost everything in London within walking distance is great!

<Title>“You get what you pay for!!!”
<Content>A number of colleagues stayed at this hotel for (thankfully) one night, it was booked for us by a London based colleague who evidently didn't want us to enjoy ourselves!! Some of us were booked at different times which caused significant confusion whilst checking in. We were accused of not pre booking or having paid for the rooms (they were all paid for up front). It seems that due to my having read other reviews on Tripadvisor i got the best of a bad lot, i asked for a high room and got a little view and no noise as suggested by a previous reviewer. My room was also a twin which was the smallest twin i'd ever stayed in. My colleagues had single rooms which it seems were smaller again, with only one bed, no view as they were lower and significant noise from the roads around the Hotel. The bathrooms are so small that bending down leads to the serious possibility of cracking your head open on the sink! The shower cubicles are minute, you bang your elbows when trying to shower!!! We paid £60 per night at this Hotel, so, as i say, you get what you pay for, it is quite central for London and i doubt that you would get another Hotel as cheap, we didn't book breakfast i'm pleased to say, residents were queuing for ages to fit into the woefully inadequate dining room when we left. All in all, i wouldn't go near this dump again, but if you're going for a Stag/Hen night it is probably fit for purpose!!

<Title>“Never Again!!”
<Content>We have just returned from a girls shopping/birthday weekend which we were thoroughly looking forward to. This hotel was recommended to us but unfortunately we will not be recommending it to anyone else!! Although an ideal situation for plenty of shopping, this hotel doesn't have much else to offer. (Just the very good service of the concierge staff) On checking in we were told that a double room had been reserved instead of a Twin and that our other room booked would be opposite! Once the info was entered into the computer system we were then told there was a problem and someone else had a hold on our room and as the hotel was completey full we would not have rooms near to each other or twin beds and ended up on the same floor but in different parts of the hotel. Both rooms required attention and were very small. On returning to the hotel in the evening, we overheard a member of staff offering a room to another guest (for a very cheap rate), so how could the hotel be full?? After a long day on Saturday we returned to the hotel early evening to find there had been some sort of sewerage pipe that had burst and unfortunate for us our room was flooded. Obviously not the hotel's fault, these things happen and two of the staff were very helpful in moving us to a higher floor. For this inconvenience we were offered a free breakfast the following mornirng. This was very poor, long time queing and luke warm food! The dining room was very much like a school canteen and very poorly maintained. On our day of departure we decided to hold on to one room in order to store our bags, we arranged this at reception to find on our return our key would not open the room. (no communication between the staff obviously! We asked to speak to the Manager on our departure who seemed to be hiding behind closed doors when she eventually appeared her attitude was very brash and no sympathy of our complaints was offered apart from a £20.00 per room discount or a special rate for our next stay, I DON'T THINK SO!!

<Title>“Worst ever hotel experience!”
<Content>I regularly stay in hotels due to business and pleasure and have had good and bad experiences but never anything that I felt the need to have a rant about...until now! On arriving at the hotel the initial impression is 'nice'. The reception area seems a bit small but the fact that you are instantly faced with the concierge desk gives a kind of big hotel feel to the place. How wrong we were! This was a trip we had arranged for our first anniversary. We had tickets to the theatre booked along with a meal etc, etc. We arrived at the hotel with enough time to get ourselves ready and get ourselves to the theatre only to be delayed by the receptionist who, apart from being quite difficult to understand, took an absolute age to process our details although we had in fact pre-booked. When we eventually received the keys to our room there was a fire alarm which meant the lifts were off limits. We were told that there was a problem and that we could take the stairs. Being on the 6th floor carrying our own cases, needing to get ready to get to the theatre...I don't think so. We decided we would have to leave our cases with the concierge and go as we were. The alarm stopped so we decided we would go to our rooms to get changed. When we finally got to our room I was appalled. A little dinky twin room (we had requested a double) that would have looked more suited to a pay-by-the-hour motel you see in American films. And it didn't smell too clever either! It was totally unacceptable. Being as we didn't have time to complain before the show started we decided we would request a different room on our return. We arrived at the theatre late (dodgy directions from a receptionist led us over 1/2 mile up Oxford St before we asked a policeman. The theatre was no more than 200 yards from the hotel entrance!) On our return I spoke to the staff and voiced our concerns only to be met with blank stares which said "What do you want me to do about it?" I asked to see the duty manager. On his arrival he was quick to tell me that they were fully booked and had no other rooms. My argument was that we hadn't been given the correct room to begin with but he insisted there was nothing he could do. I asked him that if we wanted to book one of their expensive suites would there be one available. He went silent. He then offered us a free breakfast to compensate to which I replied a free breakfast will not stop our room form being crap! He then offered us a 10% discount on the room but point blank refused when I said that 50% would be more like it for the inconvenience. I then requested a full refund and advised we would go elsewhere. After arguing the toss for another 5 minutes (they were reluctant at first even saying they were not allowed to do that) we left. We then jumped into a cab where a wonderful taxi driver named George phoned around for us and organised a room at another hotel. God bless you George! He didn't even want to take any money fro m us but we felt we had to thank him somehow. I am amazed that the hotel has actually received good reviews from people but then you can't really rate customer service experiences unless you actually have a situation where you have to engage a customer service representative. I believe the hotel would fail miserably. I would not recommend this hotel to a single soul. I would rather stay in a cheap motorway hotel as at least you know exactly what you're getting for your money. It's really saying something when even the staff feel obliged to mention that the rooms are rubbish hey?

<Title>“Avoid this "hotel" at all costs”
<Content>This has to be possibly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Filty small room , filthy shower ,cigarette burns on all the furniture. Slept with my clothes on as would not sleep in the room otherwise. Remember to bring a torch if you stay here as the lighting is so poor you cannot read a paper probably deliberate so you cannot see how bad the rooms are. Although booked for Bed and Breakfast rate did not bother to eat here if the rooms were anything to go by. My collegue reckons his room was even worse so those that have given good reviews must be the staff. £135 per night you would have expected more. Wipe you feet when you leave !!!

<Title>“Could do better”
<Content>Excellent location for a short break to include shops and West End theatres. Very busy and popular with both business people and tourists. Room was small and the shower cublicle (no bath) minute. Breakfast food was ok and there was sufficient choice, but be prepared to queue with a tray (no waiter service) canteen-style like in a school dining room. Staff were friendly and helpful. For a short city break, (3 nights with Superbreaks) we managed, but there are better hotels around.

<Title>“Better than I expected!!!”
<Content>Found staff friendly & helpful. Room was clean with reasonable facilities - but I did ask for, and got, a room with a bath, after initially being allocated a room with a tiny shower room. Location was excellent - noise didn't keep either me or my wife awake. We ate in 'Il Grasso' - hotel's own restaurant - on first night and really enjoyed the experience. Didn't have to wait too long to register or check-out. Total cost for the two of us for two nights was £226 (room-only). Didn't have breakfast, so can't comment on value-for-money (£9.95 pp).

<Title>“Very Good Value For Money Hotel”
<Content>Stayed in this hotel for three nights. I was very worried having read reviews but I had left booking to the last minute and wanted a central location. I am glad to say that everything went really well. The foyer was lovely. Marble finish floors, long wood polished reception desk, very smartly turned out staff. We checked in quickly, possibly because it was a Sunday afternoon. Our room was adaquate in size and perfectly comfortable and clean. ( I think the rooms vary a lot in size) Note- All rooms are now non smoking. There are no curtains and the room was noisy if the window was open, but this is central London. There is a very nice residents lounge on the mezzanine floor, with wireless access and paid internet access. This is expensive and you will get much better value by popping across the road to the Internet Cafe, which also has very good coffee, sandwiches and outside tables for those needing nicotine. The breakfast was a bit works canteen in terms of presentation , but a very good selection of food and plenty of it. The buffet choice included cereals, cold ham, cheese,bread rolls, croissants, and cooked English. We had no problem with getting tables. The attached pub was good value and had a local custom, always a good sign. Also outside seating for nicotine fiends. There is a Chinese restaurant as part of the hotel and we ate there the night we arrived. A very good meal. However, we went to the Japanese fusion restaurant attached to the hotel the following night and I was amazed at the high quality and value for money. This is really very good and the set menu is superb value. The food was as good as I have eaten in Japan. A friend who dined with us that night thought it the best value to be had in a Japanese Restaurant in London. We checked out on the Wed morning and the very helpful Porters desk took our luggage and assisted us with sorting out tubes back to Heathrow. Overall I liked the hotel .

<Title>“Never again...”
<Content>On arrival, one of the hotel desk staff was having a laugh with the other staff about a "demanding" customer who had dared to ask for decaf coffee. The lifts weren't working (watch out if you're on the ninth floor) and the stairs are very narrow with pipes running across at head level you have to duck under. There are no signs (so I came across several lost people in the maze of stairs and doorways) and the stairwells are badly lit. The rooms have narrow doors to get in, much smaller than standard doors, with metal plates on the corners of the walls to stop the place from falling down presumably. The rooms are so tiny you can barely move round the bed. The bath had a hole in it and the water in the sink came out so murky you couldn't see the plug. The windows didn't fit the frames so the wind came in. The heating didn't work so the room was freezing. The top sheet on the bed was filthy and stinking of someone else's stale B.O. The carpet was filthy too. The tv didn't work. The hairdrier didn't work. There is no dead lock or chain on the room doors. There is a vending machine next to the lift in the corridor that sells a selection of condoms next to the chocolate bars. Breakfast was chaotic, not enough seats, terrible food. You can't even get toast. They tried to overcharge us each room by £40, and took an hour to resolve as the manager wouldn't help the girl trying to serve us, who was new and didn't know how to fix it. She kept asking for help and the manager didn't even look at her, ignoring her as she spoke.

<Title>“Can't fault it...”
<Content>When people complain that the bedrooms and bathrooms are small or that the hotel is noisy, I can't seem to think why...they are staying in a hotel in Central London on one of the busiest streets there is!! Yes, the rooms are small and the bathrooms are tiny, but you can't expect more from a central hotel. To be honest, if you are visiting London on a sightseeing trip then all you need a hotel for is a base; somewhere to wash and somewhere to sleep. If you want bigger rooms, then you will be paying more than double the price for a hotel just a few minutes down the street! And as for noise, it is obvious there will be noise because it is so central. I couldn't really fault the hotel. It was clean and central and that is all one needs when they are visiting a city. The only criticism I have is that check-in took longer than necessary because the staff seemed to be incompetent. But other than that, I would stay there again just because of the location.

<Title>“Unbelievably noisy hotel”
<Content>We were there for 2 weeks on Theatre tour from Canada. It was incredibly noisy, small rooms/bathrooms and the only thing going for it, was the location. I would rather pay more money and stay at a quieter, downtown location. We got moved to another room on the other side of the hotel and it didn't make any difference to the noise level and the condition of the room was more run down after the move. The elevators were incredibly slow, not an option to take the stairs on the 9th floor. Would only stay here if staying 1 or 2 nights and couldn't afford to upgrade to better hotel.

<Title>“Too big”
<Content>We stayed here for 1 night on 24/10/08 as part of a theatre break to see The Jersey Boys at the Prince Edward Theatre.The Hotel was close to the theatre that being the reason we chose it.That is the only point in its favour. Basically the hotel is too big there are lots and lots of people staying there. You have to queue for the lifts bearing in mind that there 11 storeys most people would have to use them. The room was very small and the shower room was very very small. The surrounding streets are busy and noisy it is difficult to walk through the crowds to and from the theatres. Getting breakfast was a problem .The queue was long but the breakfast was OK when you served yourself with it.It did seem to quieten down around 10am but if you left it that late a big part of your day has gone. The problem with the Hotel is the number of people staying there the staff are good but cannot cope with the numbers. Sorry but I dont think I would stay there again even though the location is good.

<Title>“Worth it if you're on the run”
<Content>Just did a two-night stay at the St. Giles, sandwiched between staying with family outside of London. First, it's not all that close to Covent Garden as they claim. Not a huge deal...and my fault for not MapQuesting it. Got a great rate considering I booked it a week out. The hotel itself isn't pretty. They seem to be in a constant state of repair as when we arrived several baseboards were ripped off and some carpet was peeled back in the common areas when we arrived...but by the time we returned after our first day it was fixed. You could just tell it had seen it's share of travelers stomping in and out. That said, the room was VERY clean, including the bathroom. If you opened the window for air it was noisey...but if closed, silent. This is a perfect stay if you're going to London to see London. We were out early and home late (and the hotel bar is open late, which is a plus for a nightcap) and really had no need or want of any hotel services. I imagine, if you're looking for something more "comforting" this isn't it. But if you're just looking for a clean room to flop in after a day of museums, shopping and pubs, this is nice.

<Title>“Too big and too noisy”
<Content>Too big hotel with too many people. We stayed in 12th floor in tiny room with the terrible view. The breakfast was the worst I have ever eaten. The breakfast room was in chaos, the staff was unfriedly. The leisure facilities we were able to use was o.k. but the members of the sport club were complaining to the club manager that the hotel quests were allowed to use their facilities. They did not like children swimming in their pool. Even we went in time which allowed people in all age to swim there. Never stay there again - good thing was the location. Near British Museum and Oxford Street but thats all. Next time we will find the smaller hotel in near by.

<Title>“Great location shame about the worn out old Hotel”
<Content>The Hotel is in a fabulous location in the West End with a 3 minute walk to Tottenham Court Underground Station, this is sadly the only real benefit of this Hotel. Check in for my 2 nights was ok apart from the large groups waiting, (There seemed to be a large number of coach groups staying along with groups of school children who regularly blocked the entrance and foyer in the morning and evening). Waiting for one of the 6 lifts to your floor was a regular nightmare as the lifts were so slow and the lift well crowded no matter what time of day. It was faster to use the fire escape stairs up and down, luckily I was only on level 1 so wasn't too inconvenienced. My room smelt like a musty old bar with a stench of stale cigarettes, the reception assured me it was recently made non-smoking, the bed was relatively comfortable and the room clean. There was no air-con in my room so I opened the window for fresh air and slept with ear plugs to avoid the street noise and constant sirens. In the morning there was always hot water but a word of warning the hot water seems to run out in the evening so save your hot shower for the morning and expect a tepid shower at night. The English Buffet Breakfast was reasonable the only thing is you line up like sheep as there are so many guests and it's a bit of a fight in the line for trays, food and eventually tables. It is clear this place hasn't had a renovation for a very long time, surely they could afford one as it seems the place is doing good business.

<Title>“Location, Price Excellent!!”
<Content>I have just come back from a stay here and I would say that you get more than what you pay for considering the location and what you want a hotel room for in London. I stayed here for 1 night whilst going to the O2 to see Queen. The hotel was ideal as it was one change on the tube to O2 it takes 30 mins. Next morning you are in the heart of London. Breakfast was OK as much as you can eat and for two northern lads filled us all day. You can leave your bags for free but gave a tip anyway. They allowed us to use the lounge to rest later on as our train did not leave until 9:30pm. Would I recomend this hotel? YES! central London, buffet breakfast and only £100.00 per night. Yes it is a bit tired but heard very little noise due to thickness of windows. Bathroom was clean but tired. This hotel is all about value for money and location, location ,location. I will stay there again and have no problem taking my wife and 2 children.

<Title>“Bagain, but tired”
<Content>A surprisingly large hotel which you wouldn't notice unless you looked up, then you'd wish you hadn't.... This hotel gets 4 starts from me because of price. In the centre of London, this concrete monstrosity is home to tiny rooms, faded decor and small bathrooms, but I was charged £100 per night. For business travel, where you hardly see your hotel room, it's ideal. The staff were courteous, but they need to smile more - mostly foreign, they have assumed that to be in london you need to be grumpy. Below the hotel there is a huge "londoners-after-work" gym. It's functional, ie yuk, and very busy. But the 25m pool is a rarity in a city hotel.

<Content>Great Location for Central London, cheap, but you get what you pay for. Rooms small, but clean , they use blinds not curtains so the light wakes you up. Can be noisy. The lifts are very slow, we waited over five minutes for one on 9th floor. Breakfast OK for buffet style, again, cheap for Central London. Would not want to stay for more than one night.

<Title>“Decent sized, clean and comfortable room, fantastic location!!!!!!!!!!”
<Content>After I had booked this hotel I read the reviews on here and was seriously considering cancelling my booking but I would have been a fool, please dont take the comments too seriously as this hotel is great. Ive already recommended to a friend and I would definately stay again, could not fault it. Everyone has different expectations and experiences but mine was a fantastic one and from what I saw this weekend I think you would be very unlucky to have a bad one. We got the tube from Kings Cross to Tottenham Court road and the hotel was literally 2 seconds walk, you could see it straight away, it saved a lot of time looking at maps and wandering around with luggage. Check in was at 2pm and we arrived at 20 past 1 and got checked in straight away with no problems, check in staff friendly and efficient. Was worried about what the room would be like but no problems at all was it was a decent size and clean and comfortable. Only thing would say was quite warm but it was a very warm day also. Because the hotel was centrally located it was noisey on a night but after a lovely meal in nearby china town (too many restaurants to choose from) and a few drinks from the nearby pubs we soon got to sleep. The next day we checked out early and left our luggage for the day so we could go shopping this cost just £1 per bag bargain!! I cant stress enough how good this hotel is, the location is fantastic and we could see the London Eye and Big Ben from our window!

<Title>“Adequate for short stays”
<Content>St Giles is a large, impersonal hotel, probably built in the 1970s. Unsuited for business travelers, and those staying several days would probably find it substandard Bu for short, non-business stays, it isn't a bad option. Pros: * Friendly staff, efficient reception and checkout. * Surprisingly decent modern bar and Malaysian restaurant. * Clean rooms and baths. * Bloomsbury location: British Museum just down the street, theatre-land and Soho within 10 minutes walk. * Reasonable price. Cons: * shows some wear -- frayed carpets, scuffed walls. * My room was tiny; almost a cell (however, I could see from the "fire maps" that my class of room was the smallest in the hotel). * Tiny, fuzzy television, very limited selection of channels (no CNN or business channels). * No wireless Internet, except an expensive hotspot in lobby. * Very noisy if you are placed on the first five floors overlooking Tottenham Court Road. * Concierge really pushes a dodgy "car service" to Heathrow, overpriced and wholly unnecessary. I was there two nights, to attend a meeting Friday, have Saturday free, and fly home early Sunday. For that, the St. Giles was fine. Had I stayed longer, the room size and noise would have become a problem. Had I been there on business, I would have found it wholly unacceptable.

<Title>“Great location but small noisy room”
<Content>Good location, can walk to Leicester Square, Covent Garden and other Central locations. Right opposite Tottenham Court Road tube station. Superior Double Room was very small (maybe OK for a short weekend but I stayed for 6 nights) even if it was for single occupency. Bed comfy enough though chargeable Internet access and lack of wireless in rooms not great. Also small TV with poor signal. I was on the 2nd floor and my room overlooked Charing Cross Road. Even with window shut I could hear every single car that drove past, and the road wasn't shy of emergency service vehicles either (or early morning idiots with megaphones). The only thing I could do to drown out the noise was to put the air conditioning on which made a sound like a loud road drill and didn't seem to work. Overal: great location but rooms too small and noisy.

<Title>“Not Very Nice”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel at the end of August for one night. We chose the hotel because of it's location to the Dominion Theatre because we went to see 'We Will Rock You'. The hotel is not even a five minute walk to the Theatre and I would say that location is the only good thing about this hotel. We arrived at the hotel and the check-in queue was about half a mile long and it took ages to get seen to which was not a very good start. The staff were incredibly miserable, their faces were enough to make anyone feel depressed. None of them smiled and it was as if all the guests were a burden. We were given our room, which was small. I've stayed in small rooms before but this one really topped them all! The bed almost took up the entire room and the bathroom was tiny. Plus the window hardly opened so the room became really fusty when we got ready to go out that night because there was no air. We just got on with it because we were only there for one night and at the end of the day it was just a base but the breakfast the following morning just topped it all off. We got to the restaurant at about 9.30am and it was absolutely packed. There were no spare tables and people were just wandering around all over the place with trays of food looking for some where to sit. By this time, their food was going cold. The queues for the breakfast were really long so by the time we managed to get a table, I had to sit and wait while my boyfriend went to get his breakfast and vice versa. This meant that when I came back with mine, he had already finished so we didn't even eat together. In my opinion, the staff should give you a time for breakfast to make sure there are enough tables for everyone. The food was horrible and we both left it. I hate moaning but it was just like a cattle market. When we checked out, the staff were still really miserable and not even so much as a thank you was said. I don't expect royalty treatment but some customer service skills wouldn't go a miss. I really wouldn't recommend this hotel. There are plenty in this area and I would chose another the next time I go to London.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>We have just returned from a short 2 night theatre break to see Wicked at The Apollo. The hotel was ideally located for walking and for the tube. The rooms were smallish, but clean, and to be honest who's going to spend all day in a hotel room? You're only going to sleep there after all. The bed was very comfortable, and yes, there was a lot of noise from the street at night, but we were in central London, that's hardly the hotel's fault is it? Breakfast was adequate and you could have as much as you wanted but the coffee was ugh! and I would have liked to have seen fried eggs on the menu. The Concierge staff were brilliant. They couldn't have been more helpful and pleasant. On our last day, after we'd checked out, we were able to leave our bags for as long as we wanted which freed us up from dragging our luggage around all day. This only cost a small tip (optional). Would I stay there again? For location - yes, but I tend to try out different hotels each time I travel. Wicked was, well wicked, a real must see, awesome!

<Title>“Great Hotel - BRILLIANT location”
<Content>i initially booked this hotel BEFORE reading the reviews on here and was extremely worried about going here after reading them!. We arrived at Tottenham Court Road tube station and made our way onto the busy street and were met by the dominion theatre which is showing we will rock you we continued to walk up the road and about 45 seconds later we arrived at the hotel. From the outside it looked lovely and the inside also didnt dissapoint. It was around 11:45 when we got to the hotel and we part checked in as official check in isnt until 2pm. We were allowed to leave our cases at the hotel and went out for the day. Arrived back around 3pm collected cases and were allocated our room. Reception explained everything to us regards to breakfast and using the leisure facilities. We had a room on the 3rd floor, 2 single beds, telly, view facing the front of the hotel with a view of the BT tower. Nice wardrobe and drawers for storage, a safe and a basic bathroom with a LOVELY shower. Next day we used the pool (around 06:45) £4.00 per person per stay so is worth doing. lovely pool staff very friendly and helpful. Went to breakfast after that. Around 8:15 and it was already VERY busy. Theres cold food and hot food. All very nice - we thoroughly enjoyed it. At the end of the stay :-( the checkout was just as easy - official time is 11am but we chose to do it @ 9am so we could go out for the day. Again we left our cases at the hotel and went back for them in the afternoon. All in all a really really lovely stay. There is only 1 plug socket in the room but we took a double plug with us so no problem. I will definitely use this room again and hope that it will be sooner rather than later!.

<Title>“Miserable, small but clean.”
<Content>Boy are the staff miserable, but I find that more so with hotels in London than outside the M25. The reception area is nice enough, the corner room was very very small, but as we went for one night to watch the "We wil rock you" production, the girlfriend and I was not planning on spending a lot of time in the room, so not a big issue. Restaurant food was very nice, asked if we could take glasses back to room had to leave a £5 deposit and pick up from reception in the morning when leaving glasses. Had a problem with reception as they refused to take glasses back and give deposit back as the restaurant is independent from the hotel. Argued the toss saying they only need to do a bit of basic communication, became a point of principal, after 10 minutes and a huge sigh from the guy in reception, I got my deposit back. Food, really enjoyed, breakfast was really nice, definitely filled up on the way home. Location, could not have been more perfect, a few minutes to get from the room to the theatre and the same with the underground. Was a great base to do some shopping during the first day. I wouldn't look to come here again, but if I saw a promotion I would definitely consider coming back, my gripes are trivial and nothing major. The show was great by the way, if you like rock or Queen go and see it, you'll love it, we are actually thinking of going to see it for a second time.

<Title>“Worst hotel ever!”
<Content>From the moment we entered the room until we left was awful. The room was so small, it smelt, when we tried to open the window it was stuck. The sheets had holes in them, only two towels. The bathroom was even worse, a dripping tap, cracked sink, the flush was loose and the shower so small and coved in mould. After spending our first night in the hard and small bed we were woken early when the alarm on the TV went off which could not be switched off. Later when we wanted to watch a film the TV turned it's self off every two minuets. As for breakfast I have never stayed in an hotel where you have to collect your breakfast on a tray like in a works canteen! Had a glass of juice (not real juice) and left. What a dump do not go there!

<Title>“Brilliant Location - Hotel OK”
<Content>The St. Giles Hotel is a brilliantly located hotel if you are looking for somewhere to stay just for a couple of nights whilst you visit London. It is a good hotel if you are just looking for somewhere to put your head down for the night. The hotel is literally two minutes away from the tube station so you can easily get around London from there. Although, we didn't find that we needed to use the tube a lot because the location is brilliant. The hotel is just off Oxford Street so is in walking distance of most main attractions. The hotel is clean but could do with being refurbished. Certain areas are starting to look a bit shoddy. The rooms are fairly small but adequate for a few nights. We had a brilliant view right over London from our window. The only problem was the window didn't open very far which meant that the room got very hot, especially with being on the 9th floor. If you want to spend a lot of time in the hotel be prepared to be about boiled to death. The water is also boiling hot and we couldn't find a way to turn the temperature of the water down in the shower! The breakfast was a bit manic and you must be prepared to queue for at least 20 minutes if you want a full hot breakfast. We didn't - we just stuck to cereal, croissants and fruit juice. The Italian restaurant at the hotel is brilliant. There is a brilliant menu to suit all food requirements and the drinks menu is also fairly extensive. The food is good but be prepared to pay a little extra that average for this food. (Also, if you want chips make sure you order them separate because you just get what you order, i.e. Lasagne and that's it - no salad, garlic bread or chips!) The staff at the hotel were all very friendly and the staff at the Concierge Desk were extremely helpful, made you feel welcome and couldn't of been better. Everywhere you went in the hotel, if you met a member of staff the politely smiled and said hello - some asked where we'd been and if we were having a good time. So, I couldn't really fault the staff. All in all, a good hotel if you are visiting London for a few days and plan on just getting out to see a few sights or shows. Not bad value for money, a fairly inexpensive no thrills hotel but brilliantly located.

<Title>“Absolutely fine”
<Content>My boyfriend booked a theatre package for us through superbreak and got this hotel for a good price. I was intially worried about the choice as I know of a very nice b&b just up the road but when we arrived it was fine. Long queue at check in but it is a huge hotel that is very easy to find so we expected it. No difficulties with getting our room key and the room was better than I thought it might be. Quite clean, everything in working order, no noise from the road and bed plenty large enough. Breakfast in the morning had plenty of choice but also very busy so good idea to get there early or at the end of service if you are in a large group so that you can get a table. P.S cocktails in the bar are very yummy should you want to wind down after a night at the theatre.

<Title>“Shock, horror, I've stepped inside the Tardis!”
<Content>Well I think I managed to hit the jackpot this time in the St Giles, I've had the largest room I've ever seen; I sat in bed, stretched out and couldn't touch the sides. I think the closer you are to the center of the towers, the bigger the room. Last time I stayed I had the room at the end of the tower, this time the centre. I stayed here again, only due to location, which is superb, otherwise the hotel is let down by constantly busy reception, queues for lifts and the worse breakfast known to man. As Phil and Kirsty would say, Location, Location, Location...

<Title>“Theatre Break”
<Content>We stayed for a one night theatre break on the 12th July. My wife and I met up with three other couples for our friends 40th birthday and went to see " We Will Rock You " at the Dominion Theatre.The ST Giles could not be better placed, literally just round the corner from the theatre. The lobby was quite nice with a fast check in as they had plenty of staff on duty. The room was clean and tidy but very small. The room gave you the feeling of being in a small cabin on a ship, with the bed which was just about a double, taking up all of the floor space. The bathroom which again was clean was also very small with a shower, toilet and sink crammed in - no room for a bath. The hotel bar was quite smart and minimalsitic but was very pricey even for London standards. After the show and a meal at a local restaurant we returned to the hotel in the early hours to find the hotel bar still going strong with a good crowd in which was nice to finish the night off. Breakfast was a bit of a nightmare, very much canteen style self service for absolutely everything. We were queing at various machines for coffe and tea and another for juice. After grabbing what you need on a tray you then had to fight your way through the crowds to get back to your table. It really reminded me of the college refectory. No waitresses as such just general staff clearing, stacking, crashing and banging!! We checked out with no problems and the concierge desk has a very good set up so that you can safely leave your bags and wander around for the morning without hauling your luggage. Overall if your going to the Dominion then the hotel is okay at a good price, just don't expect the Ritz.

<Title>“Great staff - shame about the room and breakfast.”
<Content>A party of eight of us - ranging from 14 to early 50's stayed at this hotel and all in all found it a mixed experience. The staff made a good impression on us as they were so friendly and helpful. There endeth the comlpiments! The rooms were accessed by an exceedingly small and slow lift service. Once inside the rooms, our hearts sank! Despite all having booked under one name, we had two rooms on the 8th floor and 2 on the 12th. Where's the logic in that? We examined all four rooms and found that they all had their faults and virtues. Good points: 1) One of the rooms had a good view of London - Big Ben and Westmisnter Abbey could be seen. 2) Sheets and pillowcases were crisp and white. 3) Each room had an ensuite bathroom. 4) The location of the hotel - close to Covent Garden and British Museum. 5) The concierge staff - friendly and helpful. Bad points: 1) The excessive heat. It was like being in a sauna. It was so stiflingly hot that even breathing was an effort. 2) The smell - our room stank. It transpired that the ensuite rooms didn't have an extractor fan and so the damp air simply circulated around the room and bathroom. 3) The size of the shower - I have NEVER seen such a small shower cubicle. 4) The duvets - synthetic covers which didn't smell or feel clean. 5) The view from our window - a wall and a filthy dirty little balcony area. 6) Curtains which did not hand properly. 7) Only one chair per room - so the other occupant could only sit or lie on the bead. (Hence, I feel, the unclean feel to the duvets). 8) A fan which was meant to cool the room could only be plugged into the single plug that existed and was too noisy and ineffecient to do more than shift the hot air around a little. 9) The breakfast - only just about edible. The bread rolls weren't. Queues were massive. More like an ineffecient school canteen than anything else. I think that however cheap a hotel may be, ( and it wasn't THAT cheap!) it is fair to expect sweet-smelling and comfortable conditions. If I was a hotel inspector, I would close it down as I feel it is not fit for its purpose. I couldn't sleep or make myself comfortable in the room - thank goodness I only had a night to suffer! My daughter said that her room was better (the one with the view) and that it wasn't too hot either. Neither did it smell - so I suppose you could be luckier than I was!!

<Title>“Great value - have paid double for half as decent in the capital”
<Content>I booked 2 twin rooms to visit London for some Christmas shopping last year. The friends I was travelling with were not familiar with London, so I chose St Giles as it was close to the tube and the main shopping/tourist areas. I did not expect grandeur for the price but was more than pleasantly surprised with the stay. We arrived quite late in the evening, around 10.30pm and were pleased to find that the "close to the tube" claim was actually correct, unlike many others. Just a minute away, even with luggage to carry. Our rooms were clean and tidy, with prefectly adequate facilities for a short break. We went downstairs and took a drink in the bar, which had an excellent range of international and domestic beers, wines and spirits. A point to note, although some other reviewers have complained that the rooms were old-fashioned (because you want to spend loads of time in your room when you are slap-bang in the middle of a capital city?!), the bar was cosmopolitan in decor, with soft and modern lighting and design. Although we did not have time to use the fitness centre, it was good to have such a facility included in the building. Breakfast was pleasant, a good selection on the cold buffet, nice to have the option of hot chocolate as well as tea or coffeee, and although not cooked to order, the hot items were hot and edible which is not always the case with buffets. We ate in the Italian restaurant on our last night, the food was not incredible but filled a hole. Service was fine throughout our stay and although there were sometimes queues for the lift, we found an ingenious way of avoiding this - taking the stairs. If you want to spend most of your time in the room, then perhaps book somewhere larger and more expensive. The St Giles is more than adequate for short business trips/tourists/shoppers/concert/theatregoers. If you consider that the average London hotel charges £150 - £250 a night and we paid £70, if I was visiting London again for a similar trip, I would certainly prefer to book the St Giles and spend the other £100+ a day on fine dining, shopping, entertainment etc. If you take a look at my other reviews you will note that I do not give praise lightly, but as the manager of a 5 star hotel I do understand what does and doesn't represent value for money and what should be expected for a certain price/star grading.

<Title>“Great location, good value for money.”
<Content>I read the reviews before I went and was a little concerned. When we arrived we were given rooms which smelled very strongly of smoke. As a non smoker and with two teenagers I decided to ask reception to move us. They could not have been more helpful and and the alternative rooms were fine. The view wasnt great but I wasnt there for a view....I was shopping and seeing a show. The location for those things was perfect. I would only say that there are some small things the hotel could do to improve things massively...first reseal the shower to get rid of mould, secondly add a curtain as the blinds dont keep the light out in the morning. We were impressed by the breakfast and we thought we got good value for money from the hotel. Would I stay there again? Absolutely...its a perfect spot for the theatres (walking distance) and the shops. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned the racket with London cabs....ask first an approximate price. One took us all round the back streets and charged us far more than we had paid on the way out for the same journey. They blame roadworks but its an excuse to rip people off by trying to lose then round the back streets. Back to the St Giles....you get what you pay for and the staff are nice....they stored our luggage all day after we checked out.

<Title>“Dreadful place - hated everything about it!”
<Content>Don't book this place! Don't go there! And definitely avoid it if you have any claustrophobic tendencies!!This was the tiniest, grottiest hotel room I have ever had the misfortune to stay in - and I've stayed in plenty all over the world - none before have ever been so small and so depressing! Not only was the bedroom extremely cramped, the ensuite was too small even to house a bath, i.e. there wasn't one! I'm sure the bed was smaller than a standard double - my husband and I slept terribly. Not only was it very small, but it creaked noisily every time either of us moved (we spent the whole night waking each other up) and it was really lumpy and uncomfortable. This hotel is extremely ugly - a 1960s/70s concrete block - a total eyesore. And once inside, it doesn't get much better - the ambiance and decor is like something out of the 80s - it seriously needs updating and I would suggest they either knock the whole place down and start again or knock every 2 rooms into 1 to give the poor guests some breathing space. Breakfast was totally below parr - really tasteless, poor quality food. We were advised in the hotel information folder to get to the breakfast room before 8.30 "to avoid queuing" so we were there by 7.45 and the place was absolutely heaving. The atmosphere was like that of a factory canteen. The orange juice was not real juice, there wasn't any toast, and the scrambled eggs were clearly made from a powdered substitute and had the consistency of blancmange. Revolting. This hotel made me feel ashamed to be british. If people visiting London from abroad stay at the St Giles hotel and experience what my husband and I did, what on earth must they think of our country, our food standards and our taste in interior decor??! It is appalling - just plain embarrasing. How this hotel can call itself a 3 star establishment I just don't know. It's more like a hostel. The St Giles Hotel makes Travelodges (which we use quite regularly for short stays) seem like 5 star luxury!

<Title>“Perfect as a Central London base.”
<Content>After a very long journey we did not have to queue to book in and were served by a lovely young lady, who was a trainee. (Tammi??) We were given a room on the 4th floor facing the front of the hotel. (4 lifts accessing all floors). The room was extremely hot and there was no air conditioning, but on further inspection there was a large fan stored in the bottom of the wardrobe! Being on the first floor the window did not open fully and was quite small, but we managed. The bathroom was very small, but clean, and i just hoped that i didn't drop the soap on the shower!!!! The bedding was immaculate, very comfy beds and spare pillows if we needed them. A lack of plugs though, one for the tv and one next to the dressing table - fan, hair straighteners, mobile phone charger??? Hmmmm. Breakfast was self service, which obviously meant you could have as much or as little as you liked with a lot of variety from European to good British breakfast. My only complaint here is that there was no toast. How can you have breakfast without toast????!!!! Very, very central. 3 mins walk to Tottenham Court tube and the same amount of time to Oxford Street. Brilliant location. We would definitely stay here again, good value for money, good food and nice friendly staff.

<Title>“Good value for money & great location”
<Content>We were prepared for our visit to the St Giles as we had read up on the reviews however we were pleasantly surprised. Arrived at approximately 7.45pm on Friday 15th August & was greeted by a friendly receptionist. He asked us if we required a smoking or non smoking room (I was under the impression you couldnt smoke in a public place anymore) ?? Anyway he then went on to say that he only had 2 smoking rooms left of which he offered one of them to us & said that it wouldnt smell of smoke & it was the nicer of the 2 rooms he also went on to say that if we unhappy with the room in any way we were to go back to see him & he would sort out another room for us. The room did not smell of smoke & it was a reasonable size (not a shoe box) room 211 for reference..the bathroom was small but adequate & was clean & tidy. The bedroom again was clean & tidy with nice crisp clean sheets. I did not find the room too warm & if you keep your window closed the noise is minimal in my opinion. Breakfast was a bit of a free for all, it was very busy in the mornings but we always managed to get a table straight away. You then proceed to get a tray & follow the other sheep in the queue until you have your required breakfast on the 2nd day of stay the queue was quite long & I suppose by the time we sat back down with our breakfast we had been queing for approximately 7 to 10 mins. Selection of food was good eveything from cereal, yougurt, cheese, ham, rolls etc & the good english breakfast of bacon scrambled egg,beans, sausage..unfotunately was was missing for me was toast...they only served rolls. I have to praise the concierge guys they were very helpul at directing us around London & giving hints & tips. I would stay at this hotel again as the location could not be faulted & the fact that you can leave your luggage at the hotel until you are going home.

<Title>“Smelly small rooms”
<Content>Rooms and corridors were smelly, rooms very small with windows that would not open and very uncomfortable beds. Flushing toilet resulted in raw sewage smell entering the bathroom. The resturant was like a school canteen, long lines of people waiting in line to collect their food. They missed our morning call at 5am and could not book taxis for our party. Avoid this hotel unless you like sleepless nights in smelly rooms.

<Title>“A perfect location”
<Content>I have stayed at St Giles several times, and I also did during my stay in April 2008. Why do I like to stay here? It's not because of the hotel itself, but because of the perfect location near Tottenhan Court Road, Oxford Steet, British Museum and Covent Gardern. The hotel is not bad, rather average, but prices are OK when you think of the location. On St Giles you get what you pay for. I'm therefore a bit surprised by many of the reviews here; do people really think they can have a 4 or 5 star hotel stay, when they pay for a 3 star? If you want a better hotel, well; just choose a more expensive one! On the breakfast issue: yes, it's a lot of people at 8-9 o'clock in the morning, but this can be solved by turing up just before 8. Simple as that! Why do people expect to be almost alone in such a big hotel as St Giles? Get up 15 minutes earlier, and you'll have a good breakfast! And what about the traffic issue? Yes, it's a lot of cars outside, but again; why do people expect something else, like the quiet of the country side? This is central London! I don't think the traffic is any problem. All in all; I recommend St Giles.

<Title>“Location a saving grace”
<Content>I spent 3 nights at the St Giles from 1st-4th August 2008. Check in was quick and I was given an upper floor room as requested. When I arrived at my room on the 9th floor I was amazed at how hot it was (it had not been a paricularly hot day). The room and bathroom had a general grottyness about them. The bedspread had a hole (possibly cigarette burn) in it, I had to sort through the towels to find the ones without marks on them, the window didn't open properly because the TV was in the way and I was unable to deadbolt my door. After a long day of travel I ventured down to the hotel restaurant (the Italian one) it was average, but just couldn't bring myself to go any further away. Thought I might relax and watch an inhouse movie after dinner and was confronted by girl on girl porn which had no warning or security controls on it, which I felt was completely inappropriate. The lifts were inadequately small during busy check in and check out times (I walked up to the 3rd floor to catch the lift one day so I didn't have to wait in the huge queue in the lobby). Only one power plug in the room which is incredibly annoying as I was unable to charge my phone and have the fan on (which despite the mild temperature was absolutely necessary at all times) at the same time. The room was small, which wasn't a surprise, but I was quite glad that my friend decided not to stay with me as 2 would have been a squeeze. Basically the only thing this hotel has going for it is the location (and I guess that is why they stay in business).

<Title>“Small, sticky, claustrophobic!”
<Content>I thought this was a horrible place to stay, although the lobby was quite nice, the room was so small and hot and sticky (no temperature control...only a fan!). The decor was dated, I bearly had enough room to put my case down because the space around the bed is so limited (my case was small). Repeating what someone else said, the shower was tiny and quite claustrophobic! Never thought I would champion all the generic Travelodge/ Ibis/ Express Inn's but I would always choose these over th St Giles if I had to choose again! I left feeling quite stressed!

<Title>“Bed in a Box”
<Content>This was our second stay at the St Giles, the previous time was in 2003. So I knew the room was going to be small but had forgotten how claustrophobic and noisy it was. This time we were staying for six nights. It's in a fabulous location just around the corner from Oxford St. close to buses, underground, theatres, and any other attraction you're heading for in London...but..... it's basically a bed in a box. The receptionist took a while to find our booking and kept asking me if I was such and such a person even though she had all my details written in front of her. I'd made an early bird booking through Expedia.co.uk. (at least 30 days in advance) It stated that early bird bookings means run of the house rooms which are allocated at time of arrival. I did think from reading that, that we may have the chance of a bigger room than last time, how wrong was I? The room was stifling, the A/C was so noisy that we had to turn it off and open the window which made us feel like we were sleeping on the street with the amount of noise that came in. I was sharing the room with my husband and we soon agreed that if one of us was trying to move around the room the other had to stay on the bed as there was no room to move about at the same time without bumping into each other. The duvet was not particularly clean and smelled of 'someone else' although the bed sheets and pillows seemed fine. There was a very handy safe in the room albeit in a very awkward position near the window so you had to move the large standard lamp out of the way before you could get to it. There is internet access downstairs near reception which costs one sterling pound per 10 minutes - a rip off... but I needed it urgently so put in my pound - nothing happened, stupidly I put in another pound again nothing. I told the concierge who informed me that it was not the hotel's responsibility and I couldn't have a refund. I would have to take up my complaint with the internet company. I told him he was having a laugh and he pointed me in the direction of the Guest manager who after hearing what had happened immediately refunded my money without question. Thank you Mr Concierge. On one of our days there my husband was feeling unwell so I put the "Do not disturb" sign on the door before I left so he could get some sleep. He had four phone calls within an hour asking him when he would be vacating the room for the cleaners. He explained the situation but they seemed not to listen and he was constantly pestered until he refrained from answering the phone. If you are only staying in London for a couple of nights and not planning on spending any length of time in your room then St Giles standard room is fine particularly if you're on a budget. However our room was particularly dingy and depressing and I would have to be pretty desperate to go back again. I forgave it the first time because of it's brilliant location but ....twice bitten so to speak. Next time I'll make sure I go to the Jury's Inn in Islington instead.

<Title>“Great location - But has a few problems”
<Content>We stayed here as part of a large group of girls on a hen weekend. Having struggled to find a hotel which would accomodate 23 of us, the St Giles was really our only option. Anyway, I must say, I was abit wary after reading some of the reviews. The room is a bit small, and the bathroom is quite possibly the smallest I have ever encountered, but it does have one major thing going for it... the location! The hotel is just off Tottenham Court Road, and about a stones throw away from Tottenham Court Road tube station. The British Museum is about 5 minutes away, too! As I said, the room is a bit on the small side, but unless you're paying loads, you're not going to get much bigger in London. We were on the 12th floor, and it was hot! We checked in at 2pm (Standing in a queue for 20-30mins), and as soon as we walked in we opened the window. When we returned to our room at 12.30am, it was still baking hot! There is a small fan, but I would hated to have been staying in this hotel if it had been really hot. Noise is a bit of an issue, but my advice with any city centre hotel... take earplugs! Cleanliness wise, it wasn't bad. Looking a bit tired, but ok. Could do with more sockets in the room. We had one, which when you are trying to straighten hair, whilst the fan is on isn't possible!

<Title>“Location is the saving grace!”
<Content>First impression was absolutely awful which didn't help, as it was late arriving and people were all drunk in London seemingly!! Certain noises were very very off putting and our first night really made us question where we had arrived at all!! While originally I really thought it was poor and shabby, I realised after the first day in London just how great it was to be so centrally located. We could drop back to leave bags and change so easily. It was very handy for getting taxi's, getting to the underground stop (1min walk) so overall, I think I probably would stay again. I just won't be expecting what the hotel website describes it as - they must be looking through rose tinted glasses!! It's relatively cheap - so on my budget - it's just fine! No breakfast was included so can't comment on food. Was kind of happy to wander about for something though!

<Title>“clean, friendly and great location”
<Content>whats all the moaning about... i really dont know what people expect for their money. St Giles is clean, friendly and is in a fantastic location. Especially if you want to go to 'we will rock you' at dominion theatre (5 mins walk away) and use the tube as tottenham court rd tube station is 5 mins away too. Near all the shops and resteraunts, sainsburys directly across street. cinema accross road. The only two negative things i can say are : -its hot, no air con -its very noisy, even from the 12th floor .. but then again if you want to be in the middle of where everything is, then it is going to be noisy! We found the whole place to be very clean and staff very helpful and friendly.. has luggage room and staff can offer advice on tubes / attractions and directions. Room was clean, maid service every day with fresh towels. It is small but for us it was only somewhere to shower and sleep so that was all we needed. Breakfast was 6.30 - 10.30 and consisted of cereals, fruit, yoghurts, breads, bacon /sausage /egg / hash brown/ beans, juices/ tea/coffee. Lovely bar with leather settees but drinks on the expensive side. Also nice pub just up the road but last orders are at 11pm. we did 'the original tour' (open top bus) which cost us £22 pp for 24hr , as traffic moves slow and you have to pay to get in many of the attractions you see, i would advise getting a 1 day tube pass instead as this only costs £5.30pp , lasts longer and gets you around much quicker, we did this the day after. unless your VERY fussy then this is a good base for a theatre break or just a London break.

<Title>“"Don't Go - Awful"”
<Content>This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I booked a superior double and it was like a rabbit hutch and the bathroom was so small, you had to stand in the shower to shut the door!! The bed was not even the size of a double bed. The noise from the road is a constant 24hrs a day. There is no air conditioning in the room, just a fan in the wall that circulates the hot air around. You can not keep the window open, as you would never get to sleep. It was the hottest day of the year while we were there and the room was unbearable. You couldn't come back to your room during the day to relax, so my husband and I who had come away for a relaxing weekend without our children, just stayed out all day and only went back to get showered and changed. To make matters even worse, which they didn't tell me when I booked the room with the hotel direct, there is a building site that is next door and they were unloading scaffolding trucks all day. The wardrobe held about 5 items of clothing and had no door on it and the table lamp shades were all covered in water stains. The restaurant is like a school canteen, where you all line up with a tray and pick from burnt bacon, cheap sausages and sloppy scrambled eggs. You have to get your tea and coffee from a machine as well. The breakfast was so bad, even though we had pre paid for breakfast we didn't go down again and I am not fussy at all. If this hotel had been cheap, I wouldn't have minded so much, but it isn't. The fire alarms went off at 3am in the morning while we were there also. Which wasn't an issue. We rushed downstairs and guests were just opening their bedroom doors and shutting them and going back to bed. When we got to reception, there was no muster point, no staff on hand to inform you what was happening and the fact the hotel has 560 rooms and was full, there was only about 20 guests who had bothered to get up. We waited outside for 20 minutes and still no-one came out to see us and let us know what was happening. After 30 minutes and then finally having to ask the guy at the reception desk what was going on, he said it was a false alarm, but up until then no-one knew any news and all those guests were still in bed. It was frightening and dangerous. We went back to bed and it went off again at 3.50am, I rang reception and asked if it was a false alarm and they said we will ring you back!! When they rang back to confirm it was a false alarm we couldn't get back to sleep, as you were not confident that it was. If I have had our children with us, we would have left and gone somewhere else. I could go on forever about this dire hotel. Just if you have booked cancel and if you haven't don't even think about it!!!!!

<Title>“Good base”
<Content>We only stayed at the St Giles for one night , we used it as a base for a short stay in London , as some of the other posters have said the room was small but clean tidy and comfy, the room had a double bed , TV , tea & coffee making , a small bathroom with a sink, WC & shower , no air con but their was a fan we could use in the wardrobe. The staff seemed friendly enough and check in was quick & uncomplicated , breakfast was a buffet which was plentiful and a good selection , the hotel is situated close to Tottenham Cort road tube ( 5 Min's walk ) ideal when you want to be out & about, we would use this hotel again , 5* it aint but its a clean and comfy place to rest your head while you do the sights .

<Title>“Slummy hotel with delusions of grandeur”
<Content>When I arrived, I thought the hotel looked quite promising. Fairly impressive reception area, and concierge. But the room! I could not believe it. I've stayed at more appealing youth hostels. The room was miniscule, the beds uncomfortable, way past their best and too narrow for anyone other than a child. The small TV was propped on a scabby MDF unit that looked like it had been chucked together. The carpet was sticky! With what, I dread to think, but it was deeply unpleasant, whatever it was. The hotel is on one of the noisiest streets in London so I got hardly any sleep whatsoever. Breakfast was like a war zone, with a buffet style help-yourself set-up, but the quality of the food was poor so we decided to give it a miss. We were booked in for three nights but only stayed for one as it was so vile. I'd rather have slept in a bus station! The final insult was that we both were itching like mad for a few days afterwards. Fleas? Bedbugs? Whatever it was, I don't really care to think about it! Avoid this hotel at all costs. It's a disgrace.

<Title>“Not the best place I have stayed in”
<Content>We stayed at the St Giles more out of convenience since it was in central london. I had read various reviews about the hotel so was very aprehensive about staying here but for the price £99 a night in central london you can not complain really.Yes, it was noisy, yes the room was so tiny you cant move, yes it got warm and yes the room was not very clean. ( I had read the reviews mentioning bed bugs and I have to admit I did check my mattress!) But to be honest if you want to stay in london, cheap, and very central, St Giles is fine. I can imagine staying more than one night may grate on your nerves as you wont get a good nights sleep because of the noise but YOU ARE IN CENTRAL LONDON!! The city that never sleeps!!We will not stay here again because we have found a nicer hotel nearby for an extra £20 a night. For the sake of an extra £10 a night each I would rather stay in more luxury.

<Title>“centre of attraction”
<Content>a perfectly adequate hotel right in the heart of all the action, theatres ,shops, restaurants etc although it was a bit noisy at night but you cant have it all ways. The room was cosy enough and clean , our hot water was only tepid but we notified front desk on our way out to theatre and when we came back it was sorted. No fuss. Breakfast was ample , self service buffet but loads to choose from , my hubi had a bit of everything....greedy thing....we will definately go back and we even had a choice of smoking or non ! Ive not stayed in many london hotels but this one is certainly good value. We had show tickets, hotel london eye and train fare all for less than 100 pound each !!

<Title>“Well located budget hotel”
<Content>I stayed at St. Giles hotel for one night as part of a hen party visiting London on a theatre break. I felt that for the excellent room rate for a cetral London hotel, the room was a decent size with basic but clean facilities and privded us with a comfortable night's stay. I shared with my sister and our room offered two single beds with space between, a dressing table area with plug sockets and independantly down-lit mirror and the bathroom had a shower rather than a bath, which suited us fine for our short trip. Toiletries were supplied and there was an average speed hairdryer in the bathroom. I realised that I had forgotten to print out some information for the hen night and the concierge staff were extremely helpful, allowing me to access my email on their PC and to print out the information I needed. I noticed that they also allowed some other guests to print out ticket information. as the public internet access does not have printing facilities. We arrived back to the hotel at approximately 1230 on Saturday evening after our night out and proceeded to the bar for a night cap. We were happily ensconced here for a good few hours and on the receiving end of some very helpful advice from the staff about new and interesting drinks to try, which ended our evening nicely. The breakfast was plentiful and vaired with choices from fresh fruit, cerals, yoghurts, cold meats and cheese to full English fry up. We also found the staff to be helpful and attentive in the dining room. We left our luggage on checking out so that we could spend some more time in the City and the concierge again exceeded our expectations by taking some of the hen night paraphenalia to store for when our hen returned to collect her bags. We were advised on the best routes and transport methods and generally, these guys were most helpful. Location-wise the hotel is a short walk from shopping areas, one tube-stop from Leicester Square and a good base for most of the main attractions. Overall a good stay in a hotel that offers excellent value for money.

<Title>“great location, good value”
<Content>I had some fear about booking this hotel, due to some of the recent reviews. However, the location looked excellent and we would not be spending a lot of time in the hotel anyway. We were not booked in for breakfast, so i can not comment on the quality or service of this. The service of the staff was generally very helpful and good. The rooms are small, but they are clean and the beds are comfortable. They are hot, so a fan is needed. It would be great if they could get some air con for the hotel. The lifts are slow too, and often very full. However, this hotel is a practical and reasonably priced one for central London.

<Title>“cant beat its location !”
<Content>I was bringing my daughter to London as an 18th birthday present and booked into St Giles for 2 days as according to maps it was in close proximity to the shops. I was pleasantly surprised when coming out of Tottenham Court tube i could see the hotel signs and how close it was. Like all places you cant check in til the afternoon but we were able to leave our luggage all day whilst we shopped and again on our last day once checked out - left our luggage secure all day til we were ready to catch train home. We never had breakfast but that was only due to us wanting to eat out. The hotel is perfectly placed for all the shops and sights if you fancy a stroll. 2 mins away from closest tube station for further afield places to visit. you cannot beat it for location in london. yes, rooms are fairly small but we had a twin and it was perfect for a couple of nights. We had large industrial fans below outside our window and yet were able to sleep with window open all night. Good shower, clean towels, everything worked in the room. to be honest i used to work in a top London hotel and am very critical of my surroundings now but was pleased with St Giles and will deffinately stay there again. Infact we are back down in about a week and am booking a room now - hence why i remembered to do this review!

<Title>“simple, cheap, honest, perfect location - everything I want”
<Content>I had heard positive things about this hotel and then in November I stayed there (work conference) - I was very pleased with the place and booked again for a weekend trip in May for a shopping trip with a friend. This hotel is perfect for my needs. I like things simple, yet clean, a place you can trust and reasonably priced. Cheap (in London) normally means dingy and far from the west-end. This hotel is perfect. Just off of Oxford street - walking distance to theatres, attractions and shopping - or you can just hop on a bus/tube to whereever. The hotel in itself is an old YMCA that has been refurbished - so that gives you an idea of what to expect. The entrance hall is very grand and that in itself can give the wrong impression - the rooms are a let down in comparison yet I still think they are well worth the money. Checking in can go smoothly but if you are unlucky you can be waiting a while in the queue. The staff are pleasant, mostly foreign, English their second language - but goodwill and patience is a virtue. My room in November was on the second floor and in May it was on the third - both times they were a “corner” room. Maybe we were lucky there. We could use the stairs - when there were queues for the lifts, but beware the second floor is not really the second floor. The rooms where a pleasant temperature (I like it cold at night) - I turned down the heating on arrival and opened the window while we were out. I did hear of a few people complaining that the rooms were too hot - I don´t know if their thermostat was broken. Yes, the rooms are small and the bathrooms are as small as they could be - but my friend and I didn´t need more - we slept and showered. .. and then we shopped The evenings where quiet - but the walls on all sides up and down are thin - so you can hear some noises. Mornings are noisy - so if you are a light sleeper and want to sleep in I recommend ear plugs for the early hours. The hotel leaves a “welcome letter” which advises what time to go to breakfast. If you do go at the “wrong” time then expect a bit of waiting. The breakfast is fine if included in the room fee - you can eat light or eat for the day. It is not strictly an english breakfast and not “continental” either - they seem to have tried to cater for most (european) tastes - maybe a bit pricey if you pay extra (I think it was about 7 pounds) - but seven pounds is not bad for London. Starbucks is not far away and a brilliant tiny tiny shop over the road that sells wonderful coffee and fairtrade chocolate. Problems: We booked both times direct with the hotel, first time a group booking over the phone, second time using their website. The first booking they had seemed to have lost my booking (but not the rest of our group) - the hotel was full yet they were very helpful and found us a room (don´t know who they had to kick out) - everything took a bit a time but all was well. The second booking, through the internet, went better. I received a booking nr but no e mail confirmation. I rang the hotel to confirm my booking and I was booked in and everything was fine- so the internet system worked but email confirmation failed. Both times I booked about 3 months ahead and paid about 98 pounds a night - excellent for London, for the location and for the quality. I am familiar to the area and wanted to stay in the Bloomsbury area for my weekend. St Giles is the place for me now whenever I return -especially with a friend or my husband. I would probably not take my kids there - if i took my kids to London I would probably stay Hamstead Health way or Holland park (more residential).

<Title>“Sadly in keeping with other reviews”
<Content>We wanted somewhere central but after booking saw all these other reviews so was obviously quite worried. Sadly the hotel was in keeping with what other people have said. Yes it is brilliantly located and yes you can eat a big breakfast but it does get very busy. I had requested a quiet room but with the room we got it would have been impossible to have slept with the windows open. The shower room was ridiculously small and generally the room was too small to be comfortable in. I think though it would serve as a one night place if you needed somewhere to sleep and were not fussy. I think the saddest thing was the lack of smiles from any of the staff.

<Title>“Great Location...not the best night's sleep”
<Content>We were a bit concerned having read some of the other reviews, but also aware that people have different standards and expectations of hotels. You could not have got a much better location for the price, we came out of Tottenham Court Tube station and could see the sign straight away. We checked in with no problems and went to our room on the 7th floor. The room was very small but it is the centre of London so to some extent we weren't suprised. The bathroom was extremely small with barely enough room to turn around. One of the main problems was the heat. The room was baking hot, with no air con but we did have a fan which we had to have on every night (and it isn't even proper summer yet!) The bed was small as was the tv, but we didn't spend a lot of time in our room so it wasn't a major issue. We had a drink in the bar downstairs, The Lazy Dog, and other than London prices it was a nice bar. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel even thought it was included, nor did we eat there but that was just because we were in London and wanted to go out. We found it useful to get 3 day tube tickets, and couldn't believe it when on the fourth day we had to pay nearly the same amount for a day on the three day ticket just for a single trip to Kings Cross. Overall not a bad hotel but definitely not the best or the biggest!

<Title>“Great location, but....”
<Content>Booked hotel as part of theatre/hotel package as a birthday surprise for my husband. Great location, but the double room, although clean, was very tiny and in need of an up-date! No curtain at the window, only blinds which did not keep the early morning light out of the room. The bathroom was in dire need of a make-over, very small shower, tiles looked very old and dated. The toilet seat did not match the rest of the sanitary-ware. The hair-dryer looked like something out of the the 1930's!!! Although our room overlooked side street, the traffic noise from Tottenham Court Road all night was awful - could have done with some sound proofing. The only air-con was a large noisy fan!!!! TV had dreadful reception. On the plus side, apart from location, was that the check-in staff were polite and helpful. The full English breakfast was very good. The brilliance of 'The Jersey Boys' more than made up for the hotel room. However, glad we were only staying one night. I felt I did not get value for money as we have stayed in fairly standard hotels in USA which have far more and far better facilities.

<Title>“Good location - very small room”
<Content>We stayed at the St Giles hotel for one night last week. We chose it for its location, which is ideal, literally seconds away from Oxford Street...However, its location is the only good point I can really think of. The room was small and in need of updating... The bathroom was okay and had recently been redone, but the bedroom was old, dated and tiny! The staff at reception were polite and helpful, and so was the staff at the bar. However, the big deception was breakfast. The breakfast room is like a canteen. You have to pick up a tray and help yourself to food. The food quality and choice wasn't that great and the staff walking around looked really miserable and not one person said hello... Again, good location, but I don't think I will stay there again...

<Title>“Ideal Location, In Need Of Updating”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for one night with my friend which was fine. The staff was friendly, breakfast plentiful and great atmosphere. I do agree that for the money, the quality of the rooms are poor. Rooms are very small (and noisy if you open the window due to the position of the hotel on a busy road). I booked a twin room but only received one set of towels. Bathroom was clean and the shower hot. For an overnighter I think this hotel is adequate. Maybe slightly pricey for the accomodation you get, but nicely situated in the heart of the city.

I think the best points have been raised along with the bad all I can add is that having stayed on the 11th floor - Hot water never seemed to reach the bathroom shower and what is it about the ghost lift in the night!, the 4th floor - so noisy I think it may have been quiter to sleep in the lift! My favourite floor so far is the 7th - room 714 its small for a double but spacious for a single bod, the shower worked perfectly and it was a clean room. The telly is up high so no chance of turning the telly on and off with your feet I'm afraid. There is also a vending machine in the lift area on this floor, chocolate,crisps soft drinks and lager. The lager could help for those who wish to sleep! People have mentioned the chinese at the hotel, I never tried it because if you turn right up Tottenham Court Road then cross the road, take the 2nd left there starts a whole array of restaurants and all quite resonable. If you head up to Googe street there are several Italian restaurants some not just pizza and pasta! The Rising Sun and the Jack Horner Pubs also serve resonable food and real ale. I have another 2 weeks at this hotel - so lets see what other floors I can get to.! I've stopped waiting for the lifts in the morning its quicker by the stairs. The breakfasts are just as described but the coffee is good and there is no restriction on how many times you go up to the small hot buffet or the cold selections! I wuld however suggest you either get down before 8am or after 9am as it always appeared busy between these times.

<Title>“Appalling - Avoid at all costs”
<Content>Ok so this hotel has a good location but there are many hotels in London which are reasonably priced and do not treat their customers like this. Check-in was confusing and drawn out, room was tiny, in disrepair and unclean. There was no heating or aircon so room was cold and smelly, shower did not work, blinds did not close, safe did not work and reception did not answer my phonecall. Also average wait on a lift was about 10 minutes. Breakfast was, as noted by other customers, canteen-style buffet so you have to queue and someone else decides how much food you can receive. Even the dining room was filthy. I intended to complain but the queue at reception was so big I didn't want to arrive at my business meeting late (in addition to not being properly clean or rested). I will be putting this in writing to the hotel. This experience is wholly and completely unacceptable and could so easily be avoided with a little care and attention.

<Title>“Terrible Terrible hotel”
<Content>Stayed at the St Giles for one night in May 2008 - 'double' room was tiny - could touch the walls with my arms outstretched. Bathroom was small and unclean. I had no air-con so had to open the window - big mistake - is on a very major road - got less than 3hrs kip (not good prep for a meeting the next morning). But worst of all was the reception - a new start was working her first shift and the manager (or more senior person), Mark, kept shouting at her and putting her down in front of guests as she made a few errors (really small things) - felt really sorry for her. Food was ok - ate in the Chinese restaurant. My company paid £99 for this hole - but hey it's London so they can get away with it - any other city in the UK they would be out of business in a month. Tip to anyone thinking of going from overseas- get on a train to York/Manchester/Leeds/Newcastle/Durham and stay in a proper nice hotel in a nice part of the world.

<Title>“Mixed feelings about the St. Giles Hotel”
<Content>The good – location (near Oxford St) and rich buffet breakfast, clean rooms, moderate pricing The bad – Shabby, worn out hotel. Small rooms, lousy beds (mattresses are probably from the Queen Victoria era), noisy & busy, bad internet (non-inroom, I’ll elaborate: The hotel is located near the east end of Oxford St, nearby Tottenham Court Road and its associated tube station, within a 3 minute walk. From Heathrow take the tube (underground) Piccadilly line and change at Leicester Sq for the Northern line going north for one station. The hotel itself holds hundreds (600?) of rooms which makes it quite a busy hive during peak seasons. This is well noticed during breakfast, check-in, check-out, storing luggage or any elevator ride. The moderate condition lobby conceals the worn out condition of its guest rooms. The rooms are small and clean but the furniture condition is quite in bad shape. The beds, for example, are inconvenient to sleep in probably due to mattresses which have been manufactured during the late 80s (19th Century). The room has some basic equipment like a safe, hair drier, electric kettle (with coffee and tea supplies). The rooms may become noisy both due to the location of the hotel and also the room density (narrow corridors and number of rooms per wing per floor). I myself had some trouble sleeping (not only due to the mattresses…). The hotel supplies a good breakfast, buffet style – items include: cereal variety, eggs, ham, sausages, cheese, European coffee machines, juices etc. We managed to book this hotel for about 100 GBP per night for a couple including breakfast. I’ve stayed in other hotels (even worse) which charged me double. The business facilities of this hotel are unnoticeable. For example - first obstacle for getting a fax was finding the hotel fax number which the main one goes to the concierge which is typically busy handling other stuff. Internet – none in the rooms yet the lobby has 2 options – a coin internet machine and WiFi through daily/weekly subscription. The wireless option is unreliable, not stable and bottom line not usable. Refunds were out of the question. So what’s the bottom line? This depends if this stay is for business or pleasure and if you value location and breakfast over busy and noise. I personally won’t stay again at this hotel.

<Title>“Nice Hotel”
<Content>I thought i would come onto this website to review St Giles as some reviews almost made me cancel and book another hotel but was really not necessary! I stayed here for my hen do with a group of friends, the hotel staff were nice and helpful. The breakfast was really nice and a good choice. The rooms were small but adequate. I booked through an events company which was the only problem i had as i booked 4 twin rooms and one triple. When i arrived the rooms were not ready so i left our luggage in the one room that was and hit the shops. By the time i returned to check in they had run out of twin rooms and only had one left - this could be a problem for others but was not for me. The doubles they gave us were Deluxe so much nicer anyway. I believe the only problem with this hotel is the companies that make the bookings for them, they book more rooms than they have available. That aside the hotel is a great location and comfprtable and clean. you get what you pay for!!

<Title>“Pleasantly Surprised”
<Content>Recently stayed here for two nights on business. Was slightly worried by some of the very negative reviews but in reality my stay was very pleasant. Staff were VERY helpful and polite, the room was clean and comfortable (I was on the second floor) and even with the window open I didn't experience it as "unacceptably noisy" as some reviewers suggest. Vending machines for snacks and drinks and an Ice dispenser on the ground floor were useful additional facilities. Breakfast was a bit "hectic" but after all this is a busy hotel right in the heart of the City and you would have to go considerably further "up market" to get a genteel breakfast experience! Overall a pleasant surprise compared to many similarly priced city centre venues. I would use this hotel again for both business and leisure. Thanks to all the staff!

<Title>“Very good Location”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews i was very worried about going to this hotel. We had planned a 4 night stay. When we arrived at the hotel it looked HUGH and very fancy reception. We arrived at 11, check in is not till 2 but there was no problem they checked us in straight away. we were in room 307. Myself and my fiance were a bit taken back by the room. It was small just enough room both sides of the bed. But just for sleeping in, its fine. The bathroom was a bit on the small side but it was grand. WARNING the room is very very stuffy did not sleep the first night the window only opens a little. the next moring i asked concerge for a fan and it was brought up straight away, it was the best idea kept it for the rest of the nights. The hotel is in a perfect location got the tube to everywhere. The lazy dog bar is nice and comfy, we did not eat in the chinese but it smelled nice :) Overall this hotel was nice but only if you are using it just to sleep in(dont forget to ask for the fan) oh and go see mama Mia it FAB Hope this helps:)

<Title>“Ignore the poor comments........”
<Content>My wife and I just spent a most enjoyable night in the St. Giles. We also were a little worried about some previous comments that were negative, but thought we would take a chance.......... I am glad that we were not put off, we had a De luxe Double, en-suite and were delighted with everything. We were able to check in just after 11.30 a.m. and found the rooms clean tidy and quite o.k. for a London theatre break. Staff friendly and the late night bar not too expensive compared to the pubs around the area. Well done St. Giles..... we would recomend to friends and also use again.

<Title>“Great stay, great location”
<Content>Only stayed one night at the St Giles, and it was great. The location is excellent, very central we were visiting the British Museum which was 5 minutes walk away. The reception/ Lobby was very impressive plenty of staff on hand to help, check in was very quick and efficient. we stayed on the 7th floor at the back, very quiet room was lovely, clean and comfy clean bed with crisp white sheets. The rooms and hotel were lovely and warm on an icy cold weekend in London. Tea and coffee making available. The bathroom was small but perfectly adequate, plenty of toiletries. Went in the Lazy dog bar for a nightcap after a walk round Covent Garden ( 15 mins walkaway, ) not bad for london prices, £2.50 for a small beer. Breakfast room was nice, but somewhat canteen looking, plenty of food available and a nice cup of tea/coffee. Plenty of food available hot and cold buffet, bacon egg, sausage etc juice cereal croissants, also continental ham and cheese, and plenty of fruit. My only complaints were the food was a bit on the warm side, not piping hot. Also no toast available ( petty I know but we Brits love a bit of toast with our breckie ) Also no teaspoons for coffee, and no small plates for croissants. This was not a major catastrophe LOL but little details make a difference. I would certainly stay here again and recommend it to all, we paid about £80 per night, ( though Newmarket Holidays, visiting for Terracotta Warriors and King Tutankhamun exhibitions ) which I thought fantastic value. I wish we could have stayed longer.

<Title>“A Great Weekend”
<Content>Well, Im just glad I didn't read these reviews like our friends did. They were dreading it..The Hotel in itself was very nice to arrive at. Bright clean and friendly. The room was clean, smelt nice and had just been decorated. Nice wood efect furniture. Athough slightly smaller than expected, it was cozy. Bathroom was ok although could of been slightly wider. The hot water was constant and never ran out. Tea and coffer in the room was good after a day out in the town. The Italian Restaurant served good food and very reasonable for London.. Breakfast was a good choice of both full Englich and Continental. You could have both if you wanted to and fresh fruit avaliable as well. We realy thought it was good for the price and location, So have a good time and stay there for your trip

<Title>“dont go there”
<Content>as a central hotel it was ideal, within a short distance to good restaurants and the theatres,the hotel bar in the evening was lively and the bar staff were very helpful and friendly. As for the hotel , I wouldnt stay there again. The room was adequate for a 3* hotel but very small, the linen was clean but the room and bathroom was poky. A mistake was made ( by the hotel)with the booking for my daughter and her belongings were packed up and moved to the housekeeping department which was very embarrassing for my daughter, the minimum apology was given. I booked the hotel for the parking below the hotel,only to find after my stay to find my car with the window smashed.

<Title>“Not a Favorite”
<Content>I was on the 12th floor and the elevator only went to the 11th. The lobby was nice and the concierge wonderful in helping book West End seats, but the breakfast was a bit cold and they continually ran out of room, the floors were stained, wet, and had an odor, my room had no heat and only 1 available outlet, and there was thumping club music playing at night all night long. I thought the windows were open, it was so loud and cold. There were leaks in the ceiling and buckets underneath and open electrical panels all over. Wouldn't return (but thanks to the concierge!).

<Title>“better than expected”
<Content>I was very surprised at what a good hotel this was. Others thought so as it was packed. The staff were friendly and efficient and there was lots of them. Best of all was a desk where they gave out maps and told you how to get anywhere. They were very patient. For a tourist from Canada this hotel fit the bill. It was close to the subway which is extremely easy to use,and a cab from St Pancreas only cost 8 pounds which is cheaper than the subway when there are 3 of you. We were there to go to the theatre and there was at least a dozen within easy walking distance. Although the room was a little small it was adequate. This is a large hotel but the lifts were well marked so you could not get lost. Breakfast was busy and we found going from 9.00 to 9.30 avoided long lines. Lots of food, If I do theatre again I would stay there given the location and the helpful and friendly staff.

<Title>“Fine - if you know what to expect”
<Content>There are some shocking reviews of this hotel... but if you read-up beforehand, and know what to expect, its really just fine. We just wanted somewhere to sleep when exploring London during the Easter weekend. I found a rate on their website for £80... not bad when travellodge were quoting £120. The location is excellent, and the biggest strength. Literally 1 minute's walk to the permanently busy Tottenham Court Road tube. Check in was speedy and reasonably friendly - although it was about 9pm. The reception looks very nice, in marble, but the corridors could really use a re-fit. Creased carpets, scuffed walls and sofas in hallways that look quite scruffy. Bedrooms are adequitely sized... we had no problems with lack of space. They're not big by any means, but I've stayed in smaller rooms in central london before. The design of most guest rooms means there is only a very small window in the corner... feels a little gloomy, but the hotel can't really do much about the design. Cleanliness was OK - although there was dust in some corners, some nasty mould on the cieling above the window, and some traces in the shower. I could easily ignore it for a single night however. We ate in the chinese restaurant on-site... it looked quite new, and was nicely decorated. The food was great, and the hosts very polite and pleasant. A nice little bar immediately next to it, where we enjoyed a drink. Beds were cumfortable and we slept well. Was quite hot though, even thought it was snowing outside! Last time I stayed, breakfast was crowded and unpleasant - they just don't have the space to accommodate everyone. So - I took my friend to Tavistock square, about 5 mins walk away, where there's a wonderful cafe on the green itself. We had eggs and hot chocolate, and watched the squirrels jump around outside. Very pleasant, and also cheaper than the hotel! Nice old buildings around, like BMA house. Check out was speedy and efficient. The concierge stored our bags for free while we explored London more before travelling home. Myself and my friend quite enjoyed it - quite good value in a non-pretentious hotel, in a great location... just overlook some shortcomings and you'll be fine!

<Title>“Loved it”
<Content>My partner and I were going to White City to the BBC TV Studios to watch a programme recording. I wanted overnight accommodation, that was cheap and near to the Central Line tube. This was the best I could find. £58 a night with breakfast - booked via Superbreak. Double room with shower. The room could have been bigger, had we stayed more than one night it might have been hard, but the room was adequate. Bathroom was small, but the shower worked and the selection of foods offered for breakfast, catered for every taste. There was cheese and ham, bacon and egg. Didn't see anywhere to make toast (visions of the queues for the toast machine in hotels abroad - always got Brits in the queues there), but there were rolls, croissants and cereals. Thought it was really good value and will be booking there again, via Superbreak. Our train fare from Swindon was £33 each return (part of the deal) as compared with £38.50 using my railcared.

<Title>“stayed 4 nights, it was fine...”
<Content>Myself and my husband decided to take a few days away in London. Booked the hotel on line for 4 nights Friday - Tuesday. The hotel was very central, close to the underground station. Check in was quick and easy, not much information given though, had to ask for basic information. We were dissappointed that breakfeast was not included in our rate, it was 9pounds per person extra for breakfeast, we found a pub about a 5-10 min walk away, The Camebridge, breakfeast worked out less than 10pounds for both of us and was lovely! so didn't bother with the hotel one. our room had a good view considering. The room was quite cold come evening time and noise was obvious, though it is city centre so can't help some noise. We were jaded each evening by the time we got back to the hotel so decided to get the pay per view as they had some movies we hadn't seen and not much on the TV, pay per view wouldn't work, rang reception and was told it would be checked and he would ring me back, no call to let me know either way. Same again the next night so we rang reception again, pay per view was fixed within minutes, payed for it to find that none of the movies that were advertised were on, the movies that were on were like very bad pirate videos from the 80's, sound etc was diabolical the only movies that came in clear was Porn! typical! The room was small but fine for what we needed, bathroom was tiny, cheap shower gel/shampoo - so bring your own! behind the bathroom door didn't seem to be cleaned behind properly, ledges in room were dusty but other than that rooms were clean enough, no tea spoons though!?. The porters were more than helpful, they were the only ones we had good contact with and were always very welcoming. We left our bags with them on our last morning and came back and collected them that afternoon which was very handy. had a drink and a snack in the chineese restaurant before leaving, the waiter seemed to be agitated that we hadn't ordered a 3 course meal! The prices were quite high in comparison to the rest of the area. check out was fine, male receptionist was quite nice, made good eye contact etc but obviously the lack of customer interaction lies with there standards of operation or the lack of.... it wasn't bad but not hotel standards considering our check in and check out were both at very quiet times with no other guests waiting. There was a YMCA leisure club with easy access from the lifts but didn't even get down to have a look around I'm afraid!

<Title>“Poor Guest Service”
<Content>Hotel is in a fantastic location and has great potential, i have been to this hotel about 3 times, every year in November as part of a group. It looks good when you first go in, the rooms are very small but what you would expect in a city centre hotel, they are clean and acceptable. Breakfast is just dreadful, its mass buffet style and of poor quaility, bacon is dry and fatty, its like a very bad motorway style, the breakfast staff all look so missrible and as if they dont want to be there, the staff i encountered were on the whole unhelpful, evasive and sometimes even rude. A word of advice would be to go to Macdonalds just over the road for breakfast, even though i generally hate Macdonalds, its much better. I will be going back again this year so its not that bad, its just a shame that a hotel with such potential is managed in such a way. Needs some Northern TLC and some staff that want to there, to many forign staff with little knoledge of English, communicating is difficult to say the least.

<Title>“Don't bother”
<Content>Booked over the internet several weeks ago, confirmation said non smoking room. On arrival waited ages to be booked in, went to room and straight away noticed stale smoke smell, although we thought someone had been smoking, when they shouldn't have. On leaving next morning noticed the "Designated Smoking Room" signs on all doors on the second floor. Asked at Reception and apparently even with the smoking ban they can designate rooms for smokers as long as they smoke in the bedrooms only. If I wanted a room that smelt like a dirty ashtray i would have asked for one. Queued 15 minutes to get into breakfast room and then had to chase staff for trays and cutlery, although the breakfast was quite adequate. Please ensure that if you go to this hotel and you are a non-smoker don't get a room on the second floor.

<Title>“Ok for a night”
<Content>We stayed at the St Giles for one night for a trip to the theatre and after reading the reviews on here, I was worried!! We checked in with no problems, reception guy was polite and swift, no more no less. The lobby looks quite nice. We got the lift to our 6th floor room. The hallways are a bit tired but hey its only a hallway! The room was tiny. Just enough room each side of the bed to get in and out of the bed. If you had a suitcase or two, there would be no room to move at all. It was quite noisy, but not as bad as reviews have mentioned before, you are in central london! The bathroom was very very small. Just a square with a loo, a basin and a shower with a gap to get in it with a shower curtain that stuck to you when you showered - uugghh! Everything was clean, but it was a bit old and tired and smelled a bit fousty. It was ok for one night, no more!!! Breakfast was ok, nothing fantastic. Croissants, cerials, bread rolls, cheese, ham and a few cooked items. Juices, teas and coffees. The location was excellent for the Dominion Theatre for our show, and good for Oxford street etc. This hotel was just ok. But more like a hostel/cheap B&B than a hotel.I wouldnt want to stay more than a night.

<Title>“Good Location, But Everything No More Than Average”
<Content>We stayed at the St Giles just for one night, and the location of the hotel is very good, so close to theatres, museums and shops. The room was disapointing, very tired, smelt smokey, and noisey at night, with what sounded like air conditioning units coming from on top of other buildings nearby. Breakfast was more like a canteen, tea & coffee self service, and minimal cooked breakfast, not including mushrooms, fried bread, tomatoes or even fried eggs. The carpark below the hotel was quite scary. Very narrow approach, lift out of order, and stairs dirty and smelly, with people actually sleeping on the stairs. Worth noting the hotel adjusts parking ticket to half price if you ask which is a help. We were glad we were not staying any longer. Note: Most drinks in the bar are served with loads of ice unless you state otherwise. This means the actual drink in glass is minimal!! We had a lovely meal at the Pizza Express in Coptic Street which is very near the hotel.

<Title>“Value for money”
<Content>This hotel is quite basic, with rather small rooms. Good size bathroom though. I would surely recommend it to people who visit London and use their hotel only as a place to sleep and have breakfast in. The location is great: you are in central London, at the corner of Oxford Street and at a 10 minutes walk from Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square. Underground station Tottenham Court Road (Central and Northeren Line) at a one minute walk. I think this hotel is great value for money.

<Title>“Great Value, Great Location”
<Content>I stayed at the St. Giles for seven nights in April of 2007 and although the room was very small, it was clean and the service was outstanding. Staff were polite and quick to attend to my needs. Concierge service was wonderful and the location cannot be better. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who wants clean rooms, great location and friendly service.

<Title>“St. Giles was not so bad”
<Content>Before going on my trip, I read some pretty bad reviews on the internet and prepared myself for the worst. My experience at St. Giles was not as bad as some of the reviews said. I stayed there for 3 nights in one room and then came back to London a few days later and stayed 1 night in a different room. It is true that one side of the hotel is nosier than another. The bathrooms were fine and the shower is relatively small, but I've been to hotels with smaller showers than that. The room was perfectly acceptable and was comfortable. Breakfast was pretty good, with hot food and a selection of cereals and fruit. I would stay there again. My only advice is, when you check in, you might have to tell them that you want a non-smoking room.

<Title>“Absolutely awful - less than YMCA standards! Noisy, tiny lumpy beds - horrible!”
<Content>Give this hotel a wide berth! What an absolute nightmare! Double bed pathetic size! Two average sized adults could not lie down straight! The triple "bed" was a 2' 6" pull-out thing which my skinney 12 yr old son could hang his feet. The emergency vehicles fly past (full sirens) all night long......and couple with a fire alarm at 5am, we managed about 2 hours sleep which wrecked our time in London! Following a room change request, we got changed to another room which you could not "swing a cat" in!!! Breakfast was a 20 minute queue for a "bun fight" in what i can only describe as a canteen!!! No way was this deserving a 3* status.... an absolute joke for £125 per night. Please pay a little extra and manage some sleep! Ally

<Title>“DONT GO THERE”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel for a two night break. First room stank of stale smoke sheets stained and with pubic hairs on. We moved rooms but not much better. I have never been in a room so small. No main overhead light, only cheap ikea bedside lamps. Bathroom dirty and mould growing in shower, disgusting. Extractor fan did not work so everything steamed up. This hotel was not cheap, but to be honest I would not stay again even if the rooms were free.

<Title>“avoid it if you are claustrophobic”
<Content>Picked this hotel because it was reasonably cheap and close to Oxford Street. We were given a very tiny double room facing Tottenham Court Road and since we stayed over a weekend it was very noisy. The bathroom was so small it couldn't even accomodate 2 people at the same time. There was no wardrobe, but a few shelves over the headboard. A crib for my baby was put in the room, but we had to fold it to be able to move around. It was like a cubicle. breakfast was at the extra charge of £7 per person. We had it only once and it wasn't worth it. The hotel is huge and there are always loads of guests. I liked the gym and the swimming pool, but didn't have time to take advantage of them

<Title>“Disapointing”
<Content>I decided to stay at the St Giles Hotel in London due to its fantastic location, however this was all that was fantastic about the hotel. When i first arrived i felt like i have just walked into a youth hostel due to the shere amout of teenagers staying at the hotel. this wouldnt usually bother me when staying at a hotel but the reason i was in London was for a University interview therefore i needed a good night sleep, which i just could not manage was the kids felt the need to press the lift button what seemed like all night long. once i have finally got through the night, i decided to have a shower in the 1 by 2 metre bathroom. As i needed to be at my interview for 10am i really needed everything to run smoothly, but the water in the shower didnt have hot water running untill i had left it running for 25mins. Then once i had had a shower i needed to dry my hair only to find that the hair dryer in the room didnt work and they didnt even think to provide a new one. (Something that i thought should automaticly me done when something like that isnt working, as i used to was as a cleaner in a hotel, this was somthing i had to check every day) NOT IMPRESSED! luckily my parents came with me so i could borrow the hair dryer in their room which was working thankfully. When i have finallt managed to get ready, i went down to breakfast, to find a massive queue to breackfast which was nothing more than just a canteen. the food wasnt bad but i must say i did expect better. If that wasnt enought, the next night i was there, the fire alarm went off 3 times during the night, the first time at 2am however it only lasted for about 2 mins so no one even left their room as there was no information given to any of the guests by any of the staff. then again at 6.30am the alarm went off for 45 mins. only then did people think to leave thier rooms and head down the fire escapes. Once i had got to the fire assembly point outside the building, all the alrms had stopped. my dad then went to reception to find out if it was safe for us to go back into the building but the staff just looked at him as if he had 2 heads. i this point things had just got beyond a joke and none of the gues knew what to do. at 7.30 i finally got back to my room and back to sleep only to be woken up again by the alarm at 8.00. As we had been told nothing previously not one guest took the alarm seriously, which could have been extreemly dangerous if there was a fire. overall i just couldnt wait to leave, the only good thing i have to say about the hotel would be that the concerge couldnt have been more helpful. he was actually the only member of staff that gave any of the customer the time of day. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!

<Title>“Never again...”
<Content>I was booked into this hotel for a meeting so I had no prior knowledge of what to expect. Due to flight delays I booked in during the early hours of the morning. I had phoned ahead twice to warn them of my late arrival however they had no knowledge of this when I arrived. I was booked in quickly however on arriving in my room it was tiny, very cold and stank of stale smoke. I phoned reception to ask to be moved but was informed that there were no other rooms as I had arrived too late to be accomodated elsewhere. Even at 2am the noise from outside was terrible. Groups of young people shouting and screaming at each other that carried on until after 4am, sirens and general noise from the streets that made it impossible to sleep well. The room was so cold that I had to sleep fully clothed with towels and spare sheets on top of the bed covers. As I had a meeting the following morning at 10 I went for breakfast at 08.30. Queue' s werent too bad when I arrived with about a 10 minute wait for a table however the dining room itself was reminiscent of a school dinner hall, total chaos. Breakfast consisted of tinned fruit and lukewarm, poor quality items. On leaving the queue was very long, approx 50-60 people so go as early as you can. A colleague also in the same hotel had the misfortune of having to use the underground car park. Only access to the hotel was by several flights of stairs which is not easy with a suitcase. These stairwells also served as a gathering place for groups of teenagers who refused to move and were generally intimidating, not a safe place for a lone female traveller at all. Even if its only for 1 night I would seriously recommend you go elsewhere.

<Title>“Give it a miss!”
<Content>For the price it's alright. As far as location goes - fab - but that's all this place really has going for it. I'm sure there are other centrally located hotels that are nicer! Rooms are small and cramped, just enough room in the bathroom to step in and out, poor lighting in the shower and the taps on the sink in our room had a mind of their own with it taking a few minutes jiggling to turn them off! Lifts to the rooms very temperamental, on more than one occassion only 1/4 working. Staff helpful but disinterested. Unable to get snack in the bar, it seems you can only have proper meals. Best bit though is breakfast. I have never seen such a queue for breakfast anywhere, ever! There were around 50-60 people waiting in front of us and a good 20 minutes later when you see the dining area it's like a school canteen! It's not so much individual tables as benches really, then you have to queue again for hot food which consisted of bacon, sausage, scrambled egg, beans and hash brown - no toast even! After all that effort it's really not worth it! If you are staying for location - eat out!! Only stayed 1 night so not too bad, but if I was staying in the city longer would have been very disappointed.

<Title>“Noisy, small rooms, no temperature control, hotelling on a mass scale”
<Content>Was sent here on a business trip, so had no idea what to expect. Positives: - Location - right by the junction of Tottenham Court Rd & Oxford St - great - My view - included the Houses of Parliament and the London Eye. That's a pretty good view. Negatives: - Rooms were small - a bit like student halls of residence if you've ever been in one of them - Everything in the room pretty basic and worn - Noisy - everyone walking along the corridor can be heard very clearly, and the rooms are cheek-by-jowl - Temperature - my room had neither air conditioning nor heating control, and as a result was much too hot during the night - Breakfast - as other reviewers note, this is chaos. School canteen is a good analogy. Crazy madness, particularly if you're not primed. To be avoided and not paid for if you can do that. - Lifts - not all in action, and this is a BIG hotel. Loads of floors, loads of rooms = long waits and full lifts. Mostly, one isn't in London to mooch about the hotel, and the location is great. At the right price (and with ear plugs and appropriate clothing) it could be alright. I couldn't recommend it though.

<Title>“Bad Choice”
<Content>I booked this hotel for a weekend get away for me and my boyfriend, we were both disgusted with the service and state of the hotel!! We were fooled into thinking it would be a nice hotel by the marble reception area, do not let this trick you! We then stood in the que for about 15 minutes, once we entered our room we found it hard to move 2 of us and 2 suitcases was just too much! We then took a shower to find the shower head was broken along with the toilet seat!! We complained and were told it was to be fixed when we returned from our night out...it wasnt, so then we complained again and got upgraded (apparently) this room was suppoesed to be supierior to the once previous only it was smaller and stunk of smoke we then complained again just to be moved to another average size room, the staff were rude and not interested in helping. The only good point i would have to say is there is a good selection at breakfast and the location is good!! **I would NOT reccomend this hotel to anyone!!!**

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>The location makes this hotel unique choice for those who want to be within walking distance of downtown London. We booked through the hotel website a "deluxe double" room meaning a double room with an additional seating area, which was in fact an extra room with a desk, small wardrobe, couch and space to leave the luggage. I highly recommend booking this type of room, as the price (~20 pounds) is well worth the upgrade. The room was clean and airy, although the lobby and corridors, especially downstairs, had an unpleasant smell. The four lifts are not adequate during busy hours as the hotel has some 700 rooms. We never had breakfast there, as there are plenty of excellent choices all around, from Sainsbury's opposite to Pret a Manger and Soho's Fernandez & Wells and thousands others. Within 5 minutes you can be practically anywhere in central London.

<Title>“Hated It”
<Content>where do I start? My sister & I were sent away for a relaxing weekend & this hotel was hell on earth. We were told we could check in at 2pm, yet when we got there the rude man on reception said we couldn't check in yet & he didn't know when we would be able to, so we were sent away! Now I wish we'd never been able to check it ever, because it went downhill from there. We returned at 8:30pm & were allowed in our room. It was filthy. There was thick mould along the shower grouting, the extractor no longer worked as the dust within it was so thick. There was goodness knows what splattered up the bedroom walls, dead bugs that had been squashed and left. The window was tiny & the room therefore very stuffy and the noise at night was terrible. the following morning we went down to breakfast at 9am. The queue was so long, I have never seen anything like it! There were between 40-50 people in front of us & when we did get to the dining area is was a huge disappointment. Chaos is the best way to describe it. It was like a school canteen in design & staff seemed to be dashing about everywhere trying to keep up with everything. Drinks were all out of machines, so no fresh juice or tea/coffee. Also we had to have squash in a mug because there were no glasses left. Fruit was all tinned and there was no toast or cereal. I could go on for hours, but will leave this review before I get too angry.

<Title>“avoid this hotel”
<Content>I booked this hotel for a two night stay to celebrate my husbands birthday. I booked through airmiles. The hotel is a cheap budget hotel in an excellent location. We were lucky when we checked in as there were only two reception staff and I only waited 5 minutes. The queue that formed after us was very long. We were given a room on the 11th floor- having read reviews on here, i thought this would be less noisy . The room was very small- the bed was 4ft- not a double. The bathroom was very small but all was clean and well equipped. There was a safety deposit box in the room. I have two main issues with this hotel. The breakfast which was included in the price was awful. we queued to get in then we queued to get our breakfast. It was like a revolting canteen. The tables were dirty and it was chaos. I have never been to prison- but I think this was what I would expect. No toast/pastries/cakes/fresh fruit. Soggy croisants/frozen stale rolls. The bacon was covered in disgusting white deposits and the egg had seen better days. But the worse thing was the queues- 15minutes to get to the food. Then a good hunt for a table We couldnt face it the next day. The second issue was building work and the staff's attitude. If work needs to be done thats fair enough but customers need to be housed away from it and warnd- there was none.We didnt go to spend much time in the hotel- just as well. When we returned with one hour to change and dress for an early night out we were greeted to the most dreadful noise from building directly above our room. No human could have stood the noise. Reception took 5 minutes to answer and just said we could move rooms- not very helpful when you are on a mission to get ready and go out!! If I had known there was building work I could have stayed elsewhere and there is no way anyone should have been put in those rooms- sheer exploitation. They have agreed to refund some of my money and I have spoken to Airmiles to advise them of this experience. The size of the rooms was not a problem and the location was great but the customer service and breakfast were awful-the worst we have ever encountered. There are plenty of similarly priced hotels nearby.

<Title>“Discusting service..........the worst hotel I have ever stayed at!”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel for three nights whilst on a business trip in the city in February 2008 and would advise anyone to avoid this hotel at all costs. I arrived at the hotel to check in at 6:00pm only to be faced with about 10-15 marble steps to be able to get to the lobby area. At 6 months pregnant and armed with a heavy suitcase this was not ideal. I went across to the concierge desk which is located next to the stairs and requested a member of staff to help me carry my case upstairs. He looked at me like I was making a completely unrealistic request and expected a tip for the privaledge. He didn't speak a word to me and literally chucked my case at me when I reached the top. I was then faced with the biggest queue to check in that I have ever seen. I queued for over 30 minutes which was very uncomfortable only to reach the reception and be told that my reservation had been cancelled. I assured them that it had not and they told me that I needed to speak to reservations which was not located within the hotel. I had no choice but to leave the reception area whilst it was sorted out. I then had to wait a further 45 minutes whilst my work telephoned the reservations desk (which was constantly engaged). During this time the only seating area was up another load of stairs and the toilets up a further set. I was heavily pregnant, thirsty, exhausted and needed the toilet. I asked the desk if there was a lift to take me to the seating area as I had nowhere to leave my case and I was told no, I would have to take the stairs. As i couldn't lift my back, I then had to stand in the crowded lobby area for the 45 minutes which eventually resulted in me collapsing on the marble floor. Instead of the staff checking to see if I was OK they just stepped over me. I made a complaint when I paid and the man gave me a very pathetic apology and laughed the whole way through it, I was discusted and was offered no form of compensation for putting both the health of me and my baby at risk. My room was finally sorted out and I went up only to find that although I had booked a double room with a bath I was given a very pokey small twin room with a shower. The beds were on wheels and everytime I rolled over in the night the bed rolled away. I spent the whole night afraid that I was going to fall out. The bathroom was so small there was barely room to turn around. I must have had about an inch between my bump and the shower entrance, which was very uncomfortable. The room was also like a sauna when I walked in and the heating was turned off. I opened the window but as it only opened a small amount the room remained constantly hot, which in February was very strange and uncomfortable. The breakfast was absolutely discusting and if your offered the choice, I would go out and eat. If you try to go between 8 and 9 the queue is huge and you have to wait until there is a free table. The resteraunt is set out like a greasy spoon cafe, and the cooked breakfast consists of sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, hash browns and baked beans. It's lukewarm and tastes like plastic. The eggs weren't cooked properly, the bacon was covered in fat and the sausages were tiny, you'd need to look really carefully to see the meat. The fruit was all tinned and they had no toast available, it was all self service including the tea served in mugs and the juice from a machine. I had apple juice which claimed was pure juice, only to find that it had been watered down...YUK, I actually felt physically sick after eating here. When I returned home I realised that the hotel had taken two payments from my card, in the region of hundreds of punds, one which was for payment of my room and another which I had no idea about. The two amounts were different and I did not authorise it or sign for it. I telephoned the hotel as soon as I noticed the error and was told that only one payment was made and that I would have to wait until the Monday morning, (two days) before they could look into it. This is still being looked into, but if you want to stay at a hotel which has absolutely no customer service, horrible rooms, discusting food and who steals money from you then this is defiantly the place to be. I will defiantly not be staying here again.

<Title>“Great location but wouldn't class as a 3*”
<Content>We stayed at the St Giles for one night and kept telling ourselves just that, it's only for one night but really I wish we'd booked somewhere else and payed extra. The location was great almost next door to the underground station. Unfortunately this is where the greatness ended. The room was quite possibly the smallest hotel room we have ever seen!! The bed was also extremely small - meant to be a double but was more like a biggish single! It was very uncomfortable too. When we got into the room there was a large radiator turned on full blast, we went to open the window only to find it only opened approx 4 inches. There was alot of noise from outside as we were at the front of the hotel, but even so the room stayed very warm and stuffy so we had to sleep (well try) with the window open. Breakfast was just (only just) edible. The bacon was thick with fat, sausages were vile and thats the only thing I could face so we checked out and went for food elsewhere. My advice book elsewhere because even if your only using it as a place to lay your head you'll be very disappointed.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>This hotel is in a brilliant location. We paid £90 for a double room which was a special offer -I probably wouldnt have been happy with the quality of the room if Id paid any more as it was fairly basic but for what we wanted -proximity to Oxford Street, theatres etc it was perfect. The reception staff seemed very nice and we were able to check into our room when we arrived at 10am which was brilliant. Great option for budget travel in London.

<Title>“OK hotel to a OK price”
<Content>I know it's almost a year ago, and things could have changed since then (or we were very lucky), but I thought I should write the review anyway. When I first saw this site, which was today, I thought I should search up the hotels I've stayed in. The first thing that shocked me, was all the negative comments and rewives on this hotel and I thought this cant be the same hotel I lived in... (Well, I just saw some pictures from the worlds worst hotels, and compared to them this is a luxoury hotel...haha) For the price it's an ok hotel, you get almost what you pay for, there are some minor problems, like the breakfast. We got a warm welcome when I walked in, the stab was smileing and offerd to take our bags up the stairs and etc. The Lady behind the counter was nice (and spoke perfect english, as the others we talked to working there)and the man in the information/tourist counter was really nice and helpful too. The service was great. (We were 3 friends, sharing one dubble room with an extra bed) The room was ok, not modern, but not the 50's motel-room look eighter. Smelled cleand and nice, it looked nice and clean aswell. (Which is REALLY important to me) The size was ok, it was plenty of room for ourself and our stuff. The bathroom was also clean and nice, but could been a little bit bigger, though. If you have problems with your back or have problems sleeping, you should be prepared.. because the bed's are quite hard, the dubble bed could also been a bit bigger, but I wasn't a huge problem. However ther's one thing I really disliked, out side the rooms in the hallways, there were some places you were aloud to smoke, inside...! Which is terrible for the guests and the staff who works there. I don't know if that's changed, but I hope so... The breakfast was also terrible, not any avalibale seats at the begining, it was over crowded and a chaos with people in the breakfast area. The food wasn't any good, but I have to mention that I don't like any hotel foods (And I've been to alot of hotels..) The location was GREAT we could walk to everything: the shooping streets, both expencive and cheap, museums,theatres, guided tours etc. A really central location! But I have to say it was hard to find any decent place to eat, if you wanted to eat in a resturant and not a pizza or burger place, you had to look for a while... I have a friend who recently stayed on this hotel (november or december 2007), and they thought it was ok, too. If you aren't planing to stay in your hotel room all day and want a cheap hotel in a good location, then this hotel is ok.

<Title>“Excellent Surprise”
<Content>After reading reviews on trip advisor i was dreading arriving at the St Giles Hotel. Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised. The reception staff were very helpful. The rooms we were allocated were clean, smelt clean and regardless of what others have said about the size of the rooms, all of our rooms were of adequate size/roomy. The overall stay we were completely happy with. We booked our room and breakfast was included. The dining area was a very large area to cater for the number of rooms and was what you would expect for a three star hotel of it's kind, if not better! The location of the hotel was ideal for the theatres. In fact it is a stone throw away from the nearest tube station so getting anywhere in London would not really be an issue.

<Title>“Surprised by the negativity”
<Content>I must say I'm surprised that someone has complained about the size of the shower cubicle. I weigh 16.5 stones and it accommodated me perfectly well. Location couldn't be bettered. Yes noisy, especially the Astoria but what do you expect on a Friday night on the fringe of the West End? Check-in was a breeze despite lengthy queues when we first arrived. I take the comment about the size of the bed, although my partner and I slept pretty well and didn't keep bumping into each other. Pillows could have done with being a bit bigger, mind. Maids were conspicuous by their absence from our room, which we left at 8.30 for a perfectly adequate breakfast. Only had to queue for 5 minutes( the advice is to get down no later than 8.30, if you read the info sheets in the room ) Could have really pigged out on a plentiful supply of cereals, fresh meat, cheeses, fresh fruit and the customary Full English. I would certainly stay there again but would perhaps prefer a room at the back of the hotel, which looked appreciably less noisy.

<Title>“Better than expected”
<Content>After reading some very varied reviews we were pleasantly surprised. As most reviewers agree the central location of this hotel is excellent; we were able to walk to all the locations we wanted to visit. Staff were polite and helpful and accommodation was clean and tidy. Yes there was some traffic noise but that is inevitable. A good selection of food was available for breakfast in a capacious but basic cafeteria style room. We would certainly use this hotel again and consider it good value for what we paid on an indirect internet booking.

<Title>“Worse Than Terrible *AVOID*”
<Content>It was with some aprehension that I booked a 1 night stay in a triple room at the St Giles. I always check out the reviews on trip adviosr prior to commiting to a booking. The St Giles had mixed reviews, but due to it;s excellant location I took a chance....... Big Mistake! Check in was ok, given the key to our room at 1.30 and on first inspection the room seemed ok. The triple room consisted of the smallest double bed I have ever seen (a large single is a more acurate description) and a single pull down (hide away) bed. In all seriousness if you are larger than small build, the double bed would NOT be wide enough for 2 people. There was a charming view from our room of the london eye and a building site with huge (noisy) crane, of course this is'nt the hotels fault. The bathroom is a subitable size for a hobbit.!... the shower cubical is so small that the shower curtain sticks to you throughout your shower, regardeless of the position you stand in. Upon returning from our evening out, i realised that the "Pull down" bed did'nt have any pillows, I rang reception and was assured pillows would be bought up immediatly..... 40 mins later my pillows arrived. There is more road noise (Tottenham Court Rd) than I had expected, however sellted into a resfull nights sleep..... Only to be abruplty woken at 8.00 by the miad entering our room. I attempted to go back to sleep only for her to return 20 mins later and enter the room again. I can only assume that she expected us to be up, dressed, packed and ready to leave in 20 minutes. I attempted to address this with the maid, who spoke vertualy no English howver mutted something about the " Do NoT DisTurB" sign. There was NO sign in the room. I promptly got dressed, and headed down to reception to complain. The Receptionist who spoke in very broken and only basic english explained that it's a compnay policy to enter rooms if a Do nOT Disturb sign is not dispalyed??? I clarified that the compnay train housekeeping staff to enter customers rooms 3 hours prior to checkout out time, if the sign is not displayed. This was comfirmed by the receptionist! To add insult to injury, after being woken an hour earlier than we planned for our relaxing weekend away, we haeded down to breaksfst. We waited 20 mins in a que outside the resturant to be seated at a dirty table (we cleared the dishes ourselfs) and stood for a futher 10 mins in a que for the breakfast hot plate! The breakfast is possibly the WORST i have ever tasted, luke warm and basic to say the least. I picked up a Crossiant as i pused the hot breakfast aside, howveer this was rock solid and 100% stale. We left the St giles immediatly after breakfast and returned our cases to the NCP car park located under the hotel. We discoveerd that 2 vehicles parked next to ours had been broken into, with the drivers window smashed and completly ransacked. Our car was undamaged but this is NOT a secure car park. we were also advised by the hotel thet our parking cost would be £15. We infact paid £27. The customer service at this hotel is TERRIBLE. all the poor reviews are justified, i can unfortunaly vouch for this. If you are in two minds and thinking you will take a chance on this hotel as the location is good DON'T. Book into The Bonnington (5 mins away on foot) Much nicer, better service and decent breakfast. The St Giles is in desperate need of renovation, All Staff need retraining and policys need to be reviwed. AVIOD THIS HOTEL... Staying here is likely to spoil your stay in our wonderful capital city.

<Title>“Great location great value”
<Content>LOCATION- Great location just off oxford street and 2mins walk to tottenham court road tube station. we would stay here again due to location ROOM- we booked a standard double got a room on 7th floor all fixturres & fittings were v.modern, the room itself i think was a triple room as there was a tiny room just big enough for the bed then like an annexe which had a fold away bed, dressingtable and wardrobe we used this as a dressing area and kept our luggage here so we had plenty of space. there was a hairdyer, kettle tea hot chocolate etc and plenty of little toiletries shower cap in bathroom the only bad things were i think the bed was not a full double it seemed to be like one of those single and a half bed like in between a single and a double as me and myboyfriend are slim and we were squashed up a bit. But i suppose yu are not in your bed for long in London! Also it was just a shower room not a bath and it was teeny like showering in a cupboard but all fistures and fittings were v modern like nice silver showerhead with chest height and overhead attachments. BREAKFAST- we gor full english included in the price so was great value you have to take a tray and queue up in morning but great selection ie yoghurt, fruit,kellogs cereals, bacon ,eggs, croissants tea juices so cant comlplain here at all. :-] CONCIERGE- they were very helpful with directions luggage staorage etc. CHECK IN - we arrived at 10am expecting to have to store our luggage until check in time at 2pm but were pleasantly surprised thAT our room was ready so we could go up ,store our luggage and freshen up before sightseeing. the bar and restaraunt are nice and overall the hotel is busy, modern and well staffed and very clean. Ok the rooms/bathrooms are small but the whole package is great value if you include the breakfast and location. 4 out of 5.

<Title>“Not Very Friendly At All..”
<Content>We arrived at the hotel. Everything looked lovely on arrival until we got to the reception desk. they were not in the least friendly. They asked for payment in full for the duration of our stay even though we had not yet got to our rooms or had a chance to check out the facilities. We had already secured the booking with our credit cards so they had that. The Rooms were so small and as for the bathrooms they were tiny.. The Food was the best part of all. They had 4 lifts to the bedrooms but they were constantly breaking down so we had to use the stairs alot and that was not appropriate as we were on the 8th floor.. We booked a late check out on the Sunday morning and payed extra for doing so which was fine but when we went to check out they had no record of our payment. They put our credit card through for the full amount of the room for the weekend without our permission after us telling them four times we were only securing the booking with the card and paying cash on check out. We had a luvly time in London but this hassle really upset us. We would not recommend this hotel to anyone after all this trouble.

<Title>“Very helpful”
<Content>I was dreading my stay at the St Giles hotel after reading some of the other reviews posted but on arrival I was pleasently surprised. The hotel was very clean although there was a slight smell coming from the swimming pool. All the staff I spoke to were very helpful. We booked a double room, it was very small but this wasnt a problem ,as we didnt spend much time in it. The only problem that we encountered was breakfast - it wasnt very organized. The food was ok, there was lots of choice, but you had to fight for a table, there just wasnt enough of them to go around. The location of the hotel was ideal, its only a 5 minute walk to theatres, soho, chinatown. Oxford St was just across the road. We would stay here again, it was good value for money.

<Title>“Good location”
<Content>The positives: The location is perfect: near the British Museum, and very near a tube stop. I paid £255 for three nights. The room has tea and coffee making facilities which is essential for dehydrated travellers. The negatives: There were four lifts to take me from reception to my room on the third floor. In general, only one was working. The card-key I was given as my room key was in very bad condition: it was split and buckled. The bed sheets smelled clean, but had some stains. On the last night I found an insect was sharing the bed with me. I made a collect call, for which they charged me £1.50 Despite these adverse facts, I would stay there again, as it was good value for a hotel in such a good location.

<Title>“Hideous!”
<Content>My company booked me into the St. Giles for one night as I had a couple of days in London (including a Christmas do!!). At short notice we could only get a Exec twin including breakfast for £130. When I checked in at 3.30pm there was huge queue at check in which was made up of what appeared to be affluent tourists, young couples and a lot of eldery people. When I entually got to my room it was really hot. There was no AC just a radiator and a window. I switched off the radiator and opened the window which resulted in a stench of chinese cooking coming into the room - so I closed it and quickly got ready to go out. It is not possible to have an iron and board sent up to your room instead you have to use the communal ironing room. The room itself was small but lookingon the fire plans on the wall I had one of the bigger rooms and you couldn't swing a mouse in there let alone a cat! The beds were old, saggy and had blankets rather than quilts. The TV was a 14" portable on the wall with a remote control that didn't work. The bathroom was tiny, brown and whilst clean had a horrible feel to it. Breakfast - More like a school canteen affair with food layed out all over the place with no organisation, hard tables and chairs, lino flooring and a dimly lit series of rooms. People just grabbed trays and then bundled in to get what they wanted there was organisation or structure to the layout. The quality of the food was very poor and bland tasting. Again the area was very wam. Upon leaving the breakfast aea as quickly as I could I then went and queued again to check out. My over riding thoughts of this hotel were summed up as I was at breakfast. I felt embarased to be english in an english hotel that tourists and pensioners had saved up to visit a great city at Christmas and then end up in a disgusting rip off of a hotel. One of if not the worst I have ever stayed in!

<Content>Hotel room basic little clothes space , rooms could do with updating. our bedside cabinet was on a major lean.Staff were quick to deal with problems though, when we found an english speaking one. Breakfast very poor on new years day only scrambled egg sausage and bacon not even any toast. Bit like being in a noisy canteen. Struggled to find clean empty tables. Its a good job its included in price, you wouldn't pay for it. On a positive note the hotel is very central and great for underground. Plenty of shops outside so can pick up essentials.

<Title>“OK but dont ask for anything at the reception/concierge”
<Content>I stayed at the St. Giles for a week, sunday to friday included, checking out Sat early morning. First 5 nights booked via a travel agent used by my company (it was a business trip) last night, due to flight cancelled, reserved at the front desk. Well actually they do not tell you whether there are rooms available at the reception, they direct you to a white phone 5 meters away, you need to call reservation, they will book a room for you, then you go back to reception. Hotel is basic, I stayed in a twin room, nothing too fancy but OK, TV with standard channels and then PAY-TV. Bathroom ok, in first room the sink had difficulties to drain the water. Staff at front desk was OK althought the last night I asked for a wake up call at 5am for my early flight i was never called, fortunately I had my mobile alarm set. Considering how important that wake up call was I consider this a big fault on their side, I even saw the front desk guide write down my request in a regstration book, the same guy who did the night shift and was supposed to wake me up. Concierge organized a car to bring me to Heathrow, said it was 40 pounds, at destination it turned out to be 50, even if I asked before there were not many options at that hour of the day. What buggers me is the price change...cannot recall the name of the concierge guy.

<Title>“Basic but OK”
<Content>We stayed on the 12 Dec for 2 nights on a B&B basis . The hotel location is perfect for the West End/Tottenham Court Road Tube/Dominion Theatre and Piccadilly Circus was a 10 minute walk. There is a Sainsburys and Boots across the road and numerous eateries and Pubs so you won't starve. Hotel does have a bar and restuarants which did not use. Hotel appearance was modern with a wide and well presented reception area. Free tea & coffee available on the mezzanine flooring just above reception. Check-In was efficient at 1530 and I even managed to get the receptionist to smile. We did notice there were check in queues at 1700-1800 as the business folk arrived. We were allocated on the 3rd floor at the back of the hotel. Lifts had minds of their own and sometimes never came when called. Not too far to walk down fire escape stairs for us, but could have been a real pain if you are on the 11th floor. Our room was small, clean and cozy. There is no AC so that could be problem in summer. You do get tea & coffee facilities,hairdryer, TV plus pay per view movies (didn't use) and a free digital safe. Bathrooms are small and only useable by one person at a time, the shower was always hot and powerful even at 0830. Towels were rather threadbare, but I guess that stops people stealing them. Our room was located next door to the cleaners cupboard and we did get the odd whiff of cigarette smoke as the maids had a break. As we were at the back of the hotel noise was not too bad (from Bedford Avenue) but we could here the Cops whizzing up and down Tottenham Court Road. The bed was firm but comfortable and the maid service was efficient on both days with all towels/tea/coffee/milk replenished. There is NO fridge or mini-bars in the standard double rooms but there are vending machines in our corridor selling sweets and beer (£2 a can). We bought carry outs from Sainsburys for when we returned from our long days out! In the room info pack there is a letter from the Manager advising you not to go to Breakfast at 0830 as there is usually a 20 minute wait to be seated. We went for breakfast at 0830 on both days and there were plenty of free tables thanks to the Managers letter,nice one! Maybe that is more for summer time? Breakfast was a self service affair with either bacon, sausages, scrambled egg, hash browns and beans or you could have cereals or the Continental Breakafast selection. Tea was Twinnings and served in mugs just like being at School again. I did find that the tea tasted medicinal and I think that was due to the water boiler needing cleaning. Coffee was good however so I stuck with that. The restuarant/canteen staff were very efficient and cleaned up tables straight away. We checked out at 0930 and there were no queues either and again a smile from the Receptionists when I wished her a Merry Christmas. Overall, we were happy with our stay at the St Giles. It's a 2/3 Star, so don't expect the Dorchester!

<Title>“Hotels from hell fame awaits St Giles!!!!!!!”
<Content>From the moment we arrived till the time we left this hotel sucked in a big way!! Recieved nothing but attitude on check in, double room was smaller than a B&B single room, no pressure or hot water from the shower in 3 days (morning, noon & night), loads of outside noise even on weeknights, clening maids knocking on your door at 7.45am and shouting down the corridors to thier cleaning buddies all morning. no sa tallite tv as stated and the 10" tv perched ontop of the wardrobe (about 7 feet high!) and as we booked through a website were denied breakfast even though was clearly stated on our paperwork! With so many problems reception would not do anything exept tell us they were fully booked and it was take it or leave it, communicated in the ugly, rude and obnoxious manner we came to expect for the staff at st giles! we were not the only ones to be treated this way as there was a line of people waiting to complain about a number of things. We understand hotels in London ecember and did not expect top class, personal service. But being polite and making a little effort is not much to ask when paying £100 a night. Our advice is spend the extra £15 and stay in a real 4 star hotel or save £50 and stay in the Travelodge which has better rooms and staff have at least a handful of manners! Other than that the location is great!!!! x x x

<Title>“Hated the St Giles”
<Content>A lot of the reviews for this hotel have a high rating mostly due it's ideal location. If you're headed to the west end then yes, the hotel is right in the middle of it all. However, that's all it has going for it and what I realised very quickly is that it doesn't really matter where you stay because the tubes are great for getting about and you can get to the tourist attractions very quickly and easily. In other words... pick another hotel and you'll still have everything you're looking for close to hand. We were greeted by a young lady at reception (one of an endless row of trainees) who couldn't even manage to crack a smile, a facial expression many staff seemed not to possess. The hotel corridors smell funny and the rooms are beyond basic. The concierge had pittiful knowledge of the main tourist attractions which seemed to be one of his main roles. The bathrooms are in need of more than a quick once over that they get each day, I was nervous stepping into the shower. The breakfast room looks like a small school canteen and after seeing what was on offer we opted to eat out each morning. We had a great time in London but the icing on the cake could have been the hotel had we stayed somewhere else. Do yourselve a favour and pay a few quid extra a night for better service, cleanliness and cuisine.

<Title>“Good location”
<Content>Swift check in, request for quiet room accomodated (room on 12th floor), lift only goes to 11th floor! Small room with feature black mold around window. Appeared clean, bed and pillows comfortable. Wardrobe with 5 coathangers, approx 1.5m tall. TV with channels 1 - 5, pay TV for a selection of movies which I had never heard of. Bathroom very compact, mold around tiles, shower only. Hot water took 20 minutes from turning on tap/shower to come through. Complained and was offered the facility to shower in another room on a lower floor but didn't feel that appropriate. Small, thin towels. Breakfast, shambolice organisation, basic choice, not high standard (fruit juice was like squash, tinned fruit, urn for tea/coffee). On the plus side the hotel is in a great location a couple of minutes from Tottenham Court Road tube.

<Content>Arrived after a 20 hour flight to rude and lazy reception. The room smelt of BO which I suppose was dampness. Medium size accomodation for our 3 nights stay, outdated and very noisy if put on the Tottenham Road side. Breakfast was like being in a school canteen, food average. Apart from the location which is central to everthing there is not much else appealing about this hotel.

<Title>“Very shabby and dated”
<Content>Booked using Superbreaks. Chose this hotel due to location just right for theatre and easy link to Waterloo and Eurostar. The Hotel was cheap, excellent location and the public rooms fine. The lift was slow and on the 5th floor took it's time. Our room was about as far from the lift as possible and through several fire doors. I guess we were in the budget rooms as the room was tiny and the bathroom very worn with a loose toilet seat. The window faced a nearby air con unit which was very noisy and as there was no air con in our room, we had to sleep with the window closed. The room looked out on Tottenham Court Road and that was noisy all night due to nearby Hospital and Ambulances. Toiletries very cheap. Overwhelming impression was the shabby state and worn decor and not least the problematical door locking mechanism. We had to leave early and took away a packed breakfast ... which was very nice. Overall . shabby, cheap, good location ... OK for one night in town.

<Title>“Rip off!”
<Content>I stayed for 2 nights, the room was tiny, clean but dated. The whole hotel had a very dated look to it. The reception staff seemed annoyed that I'd interrupted their conversation when I asked for info on local bars/clubs and were generally impolite. On the first night I visited the bar downstairs, but wasn't stupid enough to go again the second night. The prices were incredibly unreasonable, even for London, I found drinks in another bar on the second night for almost half the price. I was in the bar until late and am pretty sure the prices increased after the till closed (no receipts, no proof). I definitely paid £4 per bottle at 1.30 whereas I paid £3 earlier in the evening. If I'd been smarter I'd have walked out after being ripped off for the first bottle.

<Title>“Don't Go”
<Content>This has to be the worst hotel I have stayed in. This was a business trip and hotel was only used as a last resort because it was National Travel week and all other hotels fully booked. I am glad I wasn't paying for it. Nothing was right. Hotel shabby but certainly not chic. No smiles from the Reception Staff, Bill incorrect. Service poor in the Chinese restaurant attached to hotel and again problems with the bill. If you like having breakfast in the equivalent of a transport cafe/greasy spoon then you will love this place. The only thing this hotel has going for it is the location only 50 m from Oxford Street.

<Title>“Perfect Location in central london”
<Content>I've recently stayed at this hotel on 14th November and I have to say it is an excellent location for getting around central london. The rooms are very compact but there is plenty of storage space, rooms were also spotlessly clean. I did'nt find the breakfast great, would recommend going to a nearbuy cafe (which there are plenty). We ate in the restaurant on our nights stay as we didn't hve time to find a nice restaurant, have to say food was good for dinner. Conceirge staff were excellent, had no problem in holding our bags for us next day while we shoped etc. Also excellent location from tube station (Tottenham Court Road), only a 3/4 min walk. I'd definetly stay here again......

<Title>“St Giles London”
<Content>I have just returned from 3 nights at this hotel, i was very worried about the hotel after reading some of the reviews so I upgraded our room to an executive room for about £25.00 extra a night but it was well worth it. The room was very clean, with all you need i.e. bath, Plasma TV, etc. The staff in the hotel were very helpful with information and directions. The tube is just 3mins walk away. One thing I noticed was the amount of people waiting for breakfast so we just went to a cafe up the road very cheap & cheerful. I will return to London next year and stay here again. The bar downstairs has a nice atmosphere a great place to meet up. Location is great.

<Content>We've stayed here 3 years on the run, it's clean, compact and reasonably priced. You can't get closer to the centre of London, it's walking pace from major shopping sights and just minutes from Tottenham Court Road tube station. Rooms are a bit on the small side, but it's only a base for sleeping, showering, shaving, etc. Rooms are very clean and plenty of storage, can be noisy of a night time if you have the window open. Breakfast is fairly good, but there can be queues to get a seat, better if there is 2 or more as you can get a table and then one go for food whilst the other waits. I'm certainly planning our 2008 stay in the same place.

<Title>“More basic than a travelodge, yet not as nice”
<Content>I stayed here for a single night while in London on business. Our usual hotels were all booked, and St Giles was the only available option. Check-in was reasonably quick - I arrived just before a japanese coach party which would have slowed things down. The desk staff were, however, more interested in their conversations than in informing me about any of the hotel facilities. In hindsight, this was probably because there weren't many! My room on the 11th floor (1130) was a twin, of average size. The bathroom was very small; the shower was very under powered. Overall the room had a rather dated and tired feeling. This matched the hotel in general. I would have preferred to stay in a Travelodge, at least you know what to expect! I will be asking my office not to book this hotel for me again!

<Title>“Small rooms, great location!”
<Content>We stayed two nights, 7th&8th November. We booked through Superbreak which included Dirty Dancing at the Aldwych. The rooms at St Giles are very small, but they have everything you need, tea and coffee making facilities, hair dryer, satellite TV and the room was very clean and smelled fresh. It had only a shower though because of the size. Towells were changed daily. We were not in the room very much and this was good because I think we would have been tripping over each other all the time. The location however, is perfect, Tottenham Court Road Tube station is a two min walk which means you can catch the tube and be anywhere in minutes. The hotel has 11 floors, so obvioulsy hundreds of rooms which means a lot of hotel guests which meant breakfast was like a conveyor belt. The first morning, we went down for breakfast at 9ish thinking that it may have calmed down, but there was a long queue for food and I had to sit at the table whilst my husband went and got his so we could save our seats as most of them were taken. The second morning though, we left it until after 9.30am and it was a lot quieter. The food was good and all the staff very pleasant and helpful. The hotel bar had a nice and friendly feel about it as well, I would definately go there again.

<Title>“Great for shopping!”
<Content>I stayed in the St Giles Hotel for four nights and was looking for somewhere central for shopping and theatre. The room I had was quite small but clean and for a short stay perfectly acceptable. It is situated very close to Oxford Street so was ideal for dropping off shopping bags etc. The staff were very friendly but as we stayed room only I can't comment on the food. The bar appeared to be quite lively in the evening and I would definitely recommend the location.

<Title>“Fab Location, Fab Hotel!”
<Content>I stayed at the St Giles for 1 night, with 7 friends to see a matinee performance of Dirty Dancing. I found the hotel clean,with an easy check in/out process and the staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The hotel is perfectly located for shopping on Oxford Street and close to the theatres. The rooms are small but all were well equipped with tea, coffee etc. The bathrooms were also quite small but we did have a bath with a shower over it, where as the others in our party just had a shower cubicle. The breakfast was fab but would definitely recommend going before 9am as the queue was very long after that. Also, at breakfast/check out time you can wait quite a while for the lifts. Would definitely return to this hotel for our next theatre trip to London.

<Title>“great location - full stop”
<Content>There is not much to say about the St. Giles beyond that it has a great location in London (central and near the tube stop) and the price is quite reasonable. You dont stay here for a great london hotel experience as the rooms are quite small, TV selections are very limited, breakfast is bland beyond belief (run to Starbucks for a coffee and muffin), the internet connection in the room is still a dial-up, and you can grow old waiting at the elevators. But again - if you want something centrally located and affordable dont hesitate to stay at the St. Giles.

<Content>We stayed for 3 nights in October. The hotel was fantastic, clean and friendly. The staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast was excellent and there was plenty of everything. Location was brilliant, walking distance of most places. A pleasure from start to finish and would definitely stay again when on London.

<Title>“Not that clean - room very small”
<Content>Stayed in St Giles for 2 nights in Oct. I found the room really small and Claustrophobic. The location was brilliant and the breakfast was good. Be aware -It took 30 mins to queue and pay for our swimming pool tickets. I thought the hotel had it's own pool and gym rather than been affiliated to a public one.... My main complaint was the smell of the quilt. On Friday night I went to pull the quilt cover over me and got an awful smell of BO. I phoned reception the following morning asking them to replace it. On my return to the room the following night, the room looked lovely and tidy with an extra blanket on the bed, but the same quilt cover over the sheets (it was never replaced). The smell was so bad that the manager stepped back after smelling it. I actually put a little mark on the inside of the quilt cover so that I would know if they replaced the quilt or just sprayed it with freshener. The toilet paper was also very sarce, you would not want to have had an Indian the night before!!!

<Title>“Fantastic!!”
<Content>On arriving and entering hotel there was a very clean and lavish reseption area. Checked in very smooth and fast and four lifts to rooms. Room was very clean and bright with tv and kettle and tea, milk etc. Situated across road from tube station and round the corner from Oxford street, couldn't ask for better location. Our room was on the front of the hotel and had views of Big Ben in the distance. Already looking to go back next time I'm in London and would definetley recommend.

<Content>Stayed here for 4 days to see Terracotta Warriors exhibition at British Museum. Ideally placed being less than 5 minutes from hotel to museum. Walking distance of theatres and shops. Excellent value for money considering the proximity to the attractions. Hotel was clean and welcoming. Staff efficient and polite. Breakfast room busy at times, surely a good indication of the food on offer? We intend to stay here on our next visit.

<Title>“Bad service, great location”
<Content>I stayed in the St Giles Hotel in July visting London for two days going to a musical. Upon check-in the staff were very unhelpful, they couldn't find my reservation and this whole scenario took around one hour to sort out upon which we had to rush to make our meal and show that night. These things happen, I made my views known but this is a huge hotel in a very good location, don't expect great customer service but its worth it if you need to be in this area. We had time to shop for few hours the next morning before we had to check out because of its proximity. Also my brother stayed here before and had warned me the rooms are small, so I booked a renovated Executive room which wasn't big at all (average size of any standard room in my opinion but maybe London is different) so I would recommend booking this if your claustrophic as I can't imagine what the standard rooms are like!

<Content>We chose this hotel after searching the internet. It turned out to be an excellent location, close to tube, easy to get to. Staff were very helpful. Rooms are small and there is no air conditioning, but they did supply a fan. We kept the fan on all the time even when we were not there, or it got too hot to sleep. I would stay here again for the locations and friendly staff.

<Title>“Great location!!”
<Content>I don't know why people are so fussy about the room size, european hotels have small rooms, get used to that!! and who wants to stay in the room anyway. This hotel is great, I've stayed there 3 times and would recommend it to anyone, you can walk everywhere, go to all the shows and come back late at night without any problem and you don't need to have breakfast at the hotel when you have all these nice places near by where you can eat. If you book through the internet you can find some good offers, I stayed there for 5 nights and I payed 453 GBP for a twin room. So, I definitely recommend it and I'll stay there on my next trip to London.

<Title>“Broom cupboard sized rooms!”
<Content>Do not be fooled by the plush lobby! As we walked further away from reception, the carpet, walls and furniture got worse... we stayed in the pokiest corner room you could imagine (room 185). It was right next to a generator of some type as the noise was like a Boeing 747. The bed was not a double - as a double wouldn't have fit - the bathroom was tiny and the tv was on top of a unit, so you'd get neck ache watching it! Ok, the location is good, but the rooms are just too claustrophobic.

<Title>“Central Hotel - good location”
<Content>This Hotel is very central for all the London Shows and the Tube station is not very far away giving you easy access to all over London...Plenty of Taxis parked outside the Hotel and very busy location. We were put up in this hotel by a company so we did not actually pay for out stay, but the rates are very reasonable £124 for Bed/breakfast. The reception area is spacious and very clean also has a nice feel about it and a rather grand enterance. The rate on this hotel is 3 star, the rooms we have to agree with other reviews are very tiny but adequate and clean - no air conditioning and the shower head had seen better days in our room on the first floor - clean beds/bedding. No fridge which we could have done with. Lifts a nightmare not big enough and a lot of waiting around - don't neogotiate the stairs as what a hike and we were only located on the first floor................we mean a lot of stairs. The breakfast well...............like dried up bacon and no fried eggs just a scrambled mess..........stick to the ham/cheese/fruit you won't go wrong there believe me tea/coffee fine. After 8.30am at weekend you will have to wait at leat 3/4 hour for a table and gawd is it basic ..there is a good breakfast bar around the corner for your information. This hotel is a 3 star and provides the needs for a traveller, 1/2 nights stay maximum small rooms but you could live with that and the plus side is it is centrally located and a good tube service. My advice to you is eat out, its part of the fun anyway. The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help - late checkout Sunday until 6pm extra £15 - we thought that was fantastic gives you a bit more time in London without having to trail bags around. There is use of a lesiure complex and its very good to go for a swim to help take those extra pounds off after eating out....This hotel is good value for the price paid but just eat out otherwise enjoy your stay................There is a super Hotel on Great Russell Street which knocks spots of this one and the location is just the same for you information it is the Jurys Doyle Hotel Chain if we had been paying that is were we would have stayed...................

<Title>“Fantastic location”
<Content>This is arguably the most central hotel in London. We stayed for a long weekend and it is on the corner of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street. It is next to Leicester Square and all the Theatres. It is on a bed and breakfast basis and the breakfast were from 7.30am to 11am. Every thing you could image was on offer. Full English, Continental, fruits, buns etc. The room was small but compact with TV and ensuite. No complaints would recommend to anyone.

<Title>“Worst Hotel Ever!”
<Content>If you were to judge St Giles Hotel from their website, you would be forgiven for thinking that it was quite a nice place to stay. The only positive I can say about the place was the location...nothing else. We encountered problems immediately on our arrival. The reception queue was never-ending, and three of the previous night's guests were arguing with a front-desk attendent over discrepancies with their bill. When we finally got to the desk, they had no record of our booking, even though we had the internet confirmation with us! When that was eventually sorted, I made my way to my room - once again, the queue for the lifts was incredible, and frustrations among fellow guests was pretty high. However, I was prepared to forget all the problems once I saw my room. But what a shambles! I could hardly get in the door, it was so tiny. The room was horrible - the carpet was dirty and stained, the bathroom smelt of damp and there was mold in the grouting. The heat was stifling even though the window was open (you had to close this at night because it was just too loud outside). The only relief was a little electric fan - no air con. My friend was also having the same problems, but she also had to put up with a couple arguing loudly next door, and having very noisy sex the night after! She asked if she could book one of the films being shown, and was told that her room wasn't enabled for pay-per-view, even though the menu sat on top of her TV. I could go on...there were so many things over the three days that we nicknamed the place 'faulty towers', and began to laugh at everything instead of moaning. But never again - my next trip to London will be more thoroughly planned and will not involve St Giles. Beware!

<Title>“Appalling!!!!!”
<Content>My colleague and I stayed in the St.Giles last night whilst on business in London. Our expectations were not particularly high as we often stay in London and rooms are often smaller than average, however nothing prepared us for the size or the general standard of the rooms we were given in the St.Giles. I racked my brains as I was sure in my lifetime I must have stayed in worse accommodation; but so far I am yet to recall anywhere ... I guess it may still come to me! The bathroom, although convenient if you wished to shower, use the loo and wash your hands simultaneously, was the smallest I have ever seen, I would warn more generously proportioned guests that they should consider using the shower at their peril as I fear if they make it in, they may not make it our without sufficient lather!!!! The decor was tired and generally grimy and I did not risk a peak at the mattress in case it kept me awake; after viwing a spare one in the corridor the next morning, I'm so glad I didn't otherwise I would never have slept. I twice asked for a blanket as the bed only had a sheet and a top cover; regrettably it failed to materialise so I slepy with a coat over to top of the bedspread. My colleague reported that her TV ( a small portable circa 1986) was not working as was promised a repair; once again no luck so no TV! The communal areas on the1st floor were also fairly grim, although the reception lulls you in to a false sense of security as this area was perfectly acceptable. The only positive I can take from this experience was that chap on the desk was very pleasant!

<Title>“great location, reasonably priced!”
<Content>this was the third time i have stayed at the st. giles hotel, and its a great location for discovering london. the hotel is right at the top of oxford street, and is 100m from tottenham court road tube station, which is on the central and northern lines, which can take you to many of the tourist attrations. the hotel itself is clean, but the rooms are quite small. the hotel has a nice bar, and the concierge will keep your bags after checkout for £1 per bag until your departure. their is a small sainsburys supermarket across the road, which has anything extra you might need. st giles do a great breakfast that is included in the price of your room, its a buffet that has english and continental breakfasts. the only downside to this hotel is that there are no views out of the windows, and it can sometimes be noisy outside, with it being on a main road, and it can make it difficult to sleep. overall, i would definitly recommend the st giles to anyone visiting london, especially a newcomer to the city, as it is very centrally located.

<Title>“Good hotel, Great location”
<Content>The St Giles hotel is situated in an excellent location just off Tottenham Court Road. It is so close to the main shopping district in London (Oxford Street) that you can see it from the Tottenham Court Road Underground station stairs. The rooms were quite small but very clean, the bathroom was very adequate and clean too. There was no noise from other guests or from outside of the hotel too. Breakfast was excellent, You get a wide choice of tinned fruits and a hot breakfast as well. I would reccommend the Hotel St Giles and I will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to London.

<Title>“Perfect location”
<Content>We stayed at the St Giles for a couple of nights to see two West End shows, one of which was 'We will rock you', and we found it to be good value for money, and a perferct location, as the Dominion theatre was just a stones throw away from the hotel (best show I've seen, by the way). The hotel is probably 2/2.5 star rating and not a 3, though for £70 a night including a decent breakfast, we couldn't really complain. I would warn people,however, that the noises outside from the roads/people/building work is pretty loud and because we finally had some good summer weather, the room was very warm with no AC. We had to suffer the heat at night as it was too noisy outside to leave the window open, so don't expect a peaceful nights sleep. Overall we enjoyed the short break, loved the 2 shows, and the hotel certainly didn't spoil the experience, just don't expect too much.

<Title>“very pleasant staff”
<Content>I booked a single online so breakfast was not included. I was given a very nice room albeit very small but everything worked just fine and it was clean. I found the staff excellent; e.g. desk clerk, concierge and cleaning staff. After I arrived, the lady in charge of cleaning visited to make sure everything was ok. I later returned with a friend who also booked a single. Her room was even larger than mine but she couldn't get the safe in her room to work. The hotel responded quickly and fixed her problem. This hotel mainly has European clients. There are 6 elevators and about 700 rooms so waiting time for the elevator can be a few minutes. The year before I had the breakfast and found it unappetizing but there's a huge Saintsbury's across the road and also a nice internet store. The location is just fantastic being a block from Tottenham Court Rd underground. Walking distance to Covent Garden, Chinatown, bookstores, theatre district. One item I would have liked would be a small refrigerator, but iron and board and fan are included. The nights were cool so air cond unnecessary anyway. Street repairs were done late at night so there was a noise factor but not the hotel's fault. I was able to get my suitcases and myself on a little elevator run by the concierge to reach the desk clerk lobby so anyone who can't climb the stairs can use this also.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>This is the third time I have stayed here. I chose it because the location of the hotel is great and it is value for money. totenham Court tube station is two minutes away. You are within walking distacne of soho, restaurants, theatres and shops. Perfect if you want to see We Will Rock You, it's almost next door. The hotel and the rooms do need some refurbishment in places, so do not expect to get luxury. The rooms are small but clean. The main areas are nice and clean. Tried the Chinese restaurant in the hotel and found it very good. They have moved the breakfast area since I last visited and didn't like it too much. Too busy and too small. However the food was hot and plentiful. For about £80 per night in central London, it was good value and a great base to go walk about. If you want more luxury, pay more and go somewhere else.

<Content>I stayed in the hotel with a friend for three nights last week. We had been planning a trip to see Grease in Picadilly Theatre and this hotel was listed as being very near the theatre. I had read the reviews on this site and I have to say I was very worried about what the hotel wouold be like. I can now say that I need not have worried at all. When we arrived, the check-in was speedy and we were in our room within ten minutes. We stayed in a deluxe twin room, which was small yet spotless. The staff were extremely friendly and did everything they could to help us and make our stay enjoyable. Breakfast was lovely and you could have as much as you wanted of a variety of foods. We had dinner in the hotel restaraunt on the last night of our stay and it was delicious and very reasonably priced. Even though we were near to the road the room was very quiet and we had no trouble sleeping. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a central base which is near to all amenities.

<Title>“Phew”
<Content>I was given a weekend in London as a gift which included staying at this hotel. The day before leaving I looked it up on this site and found so many critical comments that I was concerned. The booking-in and key systems seemed to defeat the receptionist who took a long time - at the end of which I was told that our room was in the Tower - the West Tower. Our room was larger than we have had at other hotels. Everything about it was clean - the welcome tray, sheets, ledges, carpets, shelves, bathroom with freebies and towels. We had no complaints about the standard at all. The concierge staff,( who cheerfully delivered extra milk to our room late at night ) dining room and bar staff and receptionists were friendly and exceedingly helpful. Noise - the only noise that irritated was that from outside the building which was settled by closing the window! Breakfast - This was excellent in quality and quantity. The tables were clean and were cleared and cleaned in a friendly and professional way. I would have no hesitation in staying here again While I accept that every establishment can have its off day our experience is one of satisfaction at St Giles

<Title>“dreadful!!!!!!”
<Content>The reception was unhelpful on arrival, rooms were very small, basic and in need of decorating. Breakfast time was chaotic and the food was of poor quality and cold! Even though we complained at the time there was little interest in attempting to resolve the issue. On our return we wrote a letter of complaint and the response was of any problems or issues. This hotel is an embarrassment to the British hotel trade.

<Title>“Hostel-like accommodations at Hotel prices”
<Content>Not a bad place to stay... as long as you know what you're going to be getting. The location is at the Northern tip of Soho, downtown - very central and 1 minute from the closest underground station (Tottenham Court). The service was fine, and the hotel lobby was actually quite clean and nice. The rooms, however, are extremely, extremely small, non air-conditioned - and not what you would expect based on the appearance of the lobby. Although the rooms appeared to be clean, the furnishings are very old. The best way to describe it would be an old college dormroom, or a typical average hostel room. The carpets are old and stained. The bathrooms are generally clean, but clean freaks won't want to step barefoot on the floor or leave toiletries on the sink. The sheets, although appearing clean, have dried colored stains on them (don't ask). One wouldn't want to sleep without pajamas in these beds. All that being said, if you are fine with dorm-type accommodation, and location is a high priority, then this place will probably meet your expectations if you manage to get a good price for it (I booked mine through otel.com). If you want any level of luxury that you might associate with a mid-range hotel or above, I would not choose this place. Will post pictures soon.

<Title>“Great Hotel and Location”
<Content>It really amazes me how some people can slate this Hotel, myself and my wife along with another couple stopped here for two nights, the reception/lobby was spotlessley clean and we checked in within 10mins, once upto our room it was adequate for our needs, at the end of the day your not living in it only sleeping, it was clean and well presented. The bathroom was also very well presented and the shower was a real treat after a hard days shopping with my wife!! The Breakfast area was well presented but, could do with being slightly bigger as it was a little cramped when it seemed like the whole guests had decided to eat at the same time. If your looking for good Hotel at probably the best location in London for anything and everything you wish to visit, then this the one for you. Extremely close to the Tube, the theatres are approx 10minutes away, and for all you shoppers Oxford street is 5 Minutes aghhh i still have the blisters to prove it!!

<Title>“great base, average hotel....”
<Content>Hello. Stayed her for three days in a suite (believe me the extra room just fits a sofa in it) and cost just over £300. This price is not bad for London and great for the location the hotels in. We went for a few days break and found the hotel ok. Its not grand by any stretch of the imagination but serves its purpose for been a great base for London. I cant comment on the food as we were always out and about but the rooms were clean and they did provide an ironing room. There were also vending machines around some floors which were a great help. One thing I will comment on was the smell on the corridor, it was vile a bit like open sewers but only on a certain part of the corridor. Also watch out for holes in the corridor floors, it wasnt dangerous but you could feel the carpet supporting your weight, it felt like the service duct covers had been removed and not replaced! i think St Giles could be better but for the money its still a great base, Thanks

<Title>“Staff don't have a clue!”
<Content>When checking in at the front desk the staff told me that i didn't have a room booked under my name! Having already paid i had to ring my friends who were all also staying there (we were on a hen weekend) who told me that my room was 136 and the key was put aside with my name on. Finally i got the correct room key, went upstairs, about to get in the shower and a couple walked into my room! You can imagine my horror at the fact that i was completely naked and the hotel had double booked my room and that they had just walked in with their key cards! I don't know who was more embarrased! I ended up having to ring the manager who explained that it was a computer fault. She then spent half an hour trying to work out what had happened and what room i was suppose to be in. I stayed in the room which was a double, very warm, but i used the fan. The bathroom was small and i wouldn't say that clean. Hairs were left in the sink and the plughole didn't work that well. The location is near tottenham court road and is very central, the road its on is very busy so take some ear plugs!

<Content>Don't be put off by reviews. The rooms are not spacious but this is a capital city and you are smack bang where the action is!! There is a fantatstic gym and swimming pool underneath the hotel, and the rooms are clean and well kept. The TV reception was awful, but if you plan this as a base to explore London and then just get your head down at night this is the place for you. Food OK too.

<Title>“cupboard like room.”
<Content>Excellent location, for the West End, shopping and sightseeing. The room was incredibly small and the bathroom was miniscule. Our room was situated in the East wing, I suspect directly above the kitchen, the noise and smells from the extractors was horrendous; No air conditioning left us with a choice of not sleeping because of heat suffocation or being kept awake by noise and cooking fumes. Breakfast was plentiful but not particularly good. All in all not a good choice, we would definitely not stay there again.

<Title>“Perfect location”
<Content>Just returned from a stay in the St Giles. Can't understand the bad reviews. A great hotel right in the heart of London. Staff very friendly and helpful. Single room small but twin /doubles room fine. Very clean , tea ,coffee ,hairdryer free in room safe. A little noisy if you need to keep the window open. Room warm in summer but ask for a fan. Breakfast great , usual fruit, ham cheese, cereal + bacon eggs etc. Swimming pool and gym also available for just £4 per stay. Would definitely stay here again just steps from the shops and attractions . Great value for city centre.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>After reading many reviews on this hotel, it was fair to say I was a bit apprehensive prior to travelling. Firstly, the location of this hotel is excellent. Staff are very friendly, and helpful. Impressed with the choice at breakfast, good selection for either a continental breakfast or full English. Very nice. Ok so the rooms are a bit small but everything was clean, the shower was excellent and clean. The bar and staff were good. Open till 1am on a Sunday which was good. To me this hotel had everything you would require for a night or two in London. I would definately visit this hotel again.

<Content>The room (single) was very small. The bed seemed to be clean and the bathroom too. The breakfast had limited options, but anyone could survive for 3-4 days. My room was at the 6-th floor and during friday night the noise was terrible, I couldn't sleep. The employees were nice and helpful if asked. It was OK for 3 nights, but if I'll come back, I'll choose another hotel.

<Title>“A suprisingly good hotel at reasonable rates”
<Content>I travel a lot with work around the world, and am always disapointed with London hotels in comparison to the rest of the world. Being a work trip, I try to keep to a reasonable budget, so for the £95, wasnt expecting a great deal from the St Giles hotel. From the point of entering reception which was pleasant enough but really busy made me feel like I was going to get the same tired old rooms and service I have come to expect from reasonable priced hotels in London. Once in the rooms though, I was really pleasantly suprised. (Although tiny - as you expect in London) it was clean and really modernly furnished. A plasma screen on the wall, and some really nice touches that just make it seem nicer than your average budget hotel - nice water glasses etc and free bottled water in the rooms. The bathroom was modern and immaculately clean again. A great hotel location, just off Tottenham Court road, and relatively quiet throughout the night. All in all, a really excellent attempt at a budget London hotel and I think would be great for business or leisure as long as you weren;t planning on spending a lot of time in the room.

<Title>“Really good stay”
<Content>I did read a couple of reviews on here and must admit I was expecting the worse after what I had read about the rooms and the lifts. I stayed in London for 3 nights. We checked into the hotel very quickly and did not wait long for a lift at all. Our room was on the 6th floor but did not have to wait for more than 2 mins the whole time we were there. I have stayed in bigger rooms, but when your in London (for leisure) I guess you are not planning to stay in your room that long. The bathroom was small but adequate and the rooms where clean. I found my bed very comfy (could have done with one more pillow maybe). Yes, it was noisy, but what do you expect - its just off Oxford Street in the middle of London, and after very long days of sightseeing and shows we were too tired to notice. We only had breakfast on one of the mornings. It had everything you would expect and there was nothing wrong with the food at all. It was set out rather like a canteen but that would be my only criticism. I found the staff very helpful, and the concierge told us everything we asked of them, and stood on the street with us to hail a taxi when it came for us to leave. The hotel itself is right next to Tottenham Court Road Tube which is only 3 stops from Euston so getting there was very easy. One stop to Leicester Square but easy walking distance to anywhere. The location just made the whole stay that bit more enjoyable. For the price and locatation I would absolutly reccommend this hotel for anyone on a leisure break in the city.

<Title>“Great location crap service”
<Content>I have stayed here a total three times. Yes the location is great but it is noisey. I can get over that also as you are in the west end but they have these blinds in the rooms that don't keep out the light. The rooms are very small but then again you are very centrally located.The last time we booked a mini suite and they firstly could not find our booking. Then when we got to our room there was work being done on the floor above us and they did not tell us about this. The drilling was unbeleivable. We rang to complain and ask to be moved and they did not see the problem eventually the next day we were moved. The customer service was appalling we had to ask for a deduction as we moved back to an ordinary room. But we will not be returning to this hotel.

<Content>This hotel is very busy but does not seem to spend any money on upgrading itself. The rooms were very small and not very comfortable. One of my party was badly bitten on her back by bed bugs and it turned my stomach to stay there. There are so many better hotels in London that there is surely no need to stay in this old, cramped and dirty place.

<Title>“Appaling Customer Service - Wont be returning”
<Content>This hotel really does eptimise the shocking customer services. After booking and paying on line we waited 20 minutes to check in after a member of staff could not find us. We were told 6th floor, no times for breafast or anything. After queing for a lift space we found our room (small would be being complimentary) although the room was clean and tidy shame we could not say the same for the bathroom. The tv was no programmed correctly so many channels coudl not be watched. After repeatedly trying to book a film and calling a manager to complain we were told they did not have a credit card to secure the room thus we were not allowed to watch - we wernt asked for a card at check in!! The 2 nights we stayed at the St Giles were probably the 2 worst nights of my life, a rock hard bed, pancake pillows and so much noise with the window open it was a joke. Why dont london hotels have air conditioning? Didnt even bother with brekfast decided to use the high street for something decent. Reception were at most - useless and conceirge a waste of time. Duty Managers couldnt be bothered to help when my wallet was stolen and the GM didnt even return my calls to complain. Steer clear and use the Jurys Inn round the corner is my best advice.

<Title>“The Smallest Room Ever!!”
<Content>The location of this hotel is what attracted me to it, and it is indeed in the centre of London. Oxford Street across the road and a few minutes walk to theatre land. The down side is that the rooms are tiny, hot and not particularly clean. No room to place suitcases and tiny, tiny wardrobe space. We were in town for shopping and to see a show so the time we spent in the room was minimal and probably just about adequate for a two night stay - I would not have liked to stay longer. The Breakfast is a bit of a survival of the fittest as it is very chaotic but given the volume that they are producing it was acceptable. The best place to be in the hotel is either the bar, which has a great atmosphere, or the restaurant which adjoins it which serves a very nice meal. My travel is usually for business so I looked at this trip in a slightly different light as it was for leisure. I would not have been at all happy staying here on a business trip, no space to work and street noise are issues for business travellers who need a good night's sleep.

<Title>“Noisy, and in need of upgrade”
<Content>Perfect location right next to Tottenham Court Road subway station. A large hotel with acceptable prices. We paid 129 pounds per night for a double room upgraded to a suite. Well, the upgrade was a extra room with a sofa and an extra telly. Bathroom was with a shower, but should have been renovated. We spent three nights in St. Giles London. We have been at St. Giles 4 times before. Extremely slow elevators, so we spent quite a lot of time in queues... Hotel offer swimming pool and more, but we did not try it this time. The breakfast is way much better (and cheaper) in one of the many cafés in the area (Nero, Starbucks, Pret-a-Manger, Grab-a-bite etc.). You'll find Oxford Street just around the corner. There were a lot of noise from the street, so it was almost impossible to keep the window open. It is a few shops across the street, with deliveries and garbage pickup causing a lot of noise. Seems like something happens every minute of the night.... it was like this every night. And early in the morning, like 7, construcion workers started working with the hotels top floor. The hotel could have warned us about all massive construcion work, since it was impossible to stay in during this work. Next time we'll choose another hotel for sure, even if we need to pay more. Rooms need an upgrade, especially the bathrooms.

<Title>“Dont waste your money”
<Content>We stayed at St. Giles from 16 - 20 may, and had booked a superior double room for 2, so we expected a standard above average, but no no no...... When we arrived, the check-in was quick. Getting out of the lift on second floor, there was an odd smell and the air was warm and a bit moist, it only got worse the longer down the hallway we came. Opening the door to our room we found the smallest room we have ever stayed in, having to go sideways trough the door with our suitcases. At least the air wasnt smelly but it was very warm, so we opened the window, but it couldnt open more than 8-10 inches. At first look the room seemed clean, but at a closer look we fond dirtmarks on the walls, small cracks in the tiling on the bathroom, and dust in the corners. Also there where no ashtray in the room, but we had speceficaly booked at smoking room, it first arrived after 2 complaints to reception over an 9 hour period. Getting up the day after to shower we found out that the air-vent / fan in the bathroom wasnt working, so all the moist and condensation from two people showering got out in the room, not very pleasant. We contacted reception and was promised that it would be fixed, but nothing happened. The bed was very small and uneven, if you sat in one end you would go down 10-15 inches but in the other end onle 3-5 inches. Also it is very short, so if you are taller than 175 cm. you cant lie stretched out. The tv in the room is badly tuned and a third of the channels listed in the guest directory, wasnt working. The hotel has only 4 lifts for 700 rooms so we often waited a couple of minutes before it arrived. The only good things at this hotel is its location, close to the tube and shopping / attractions, and its concierge who is very helpfull. The last morning of our stay, there was no warm water, so we had to leave without being able to shower. The only reason that we didnt left and found another hotel, is that we didnt spend more time there than to sleep and shower. We dont expect luxurious executive rooms to this price, but having booked a superior room (above standard) we at least expect the basic things to be in order. Having stayed in London hotels many times we know that London standard is often a bit below averege, but the St. Giles is simply at the bottom of the scale. We will never stay there again....

<Title>“Stay away”
<Content>This was without doubt the worst hotel I have stayed in. The interior was poor (no pictures on the walls and paintwork in need of repair). The lifts were also poorly decorated and slow - you often had to wait 10 minutes for one to arrive. The rooms were very small and the bathroom couldnt fit 2 people in (wasnt big enough for a bath either). The rooms were also too hot so who knows what the atmosphere would be like in the summer. There was even a queue for 30 mins for breakfast in the morning - once there it was like a cattle market and you had to share tables. If you like hotels cheap and tacky this is the one for you. If you have money to burn just send it to me - you will feel better that giving money to this franchise. Good luck - you'll need it.

<Title>“Okay, certainly not impressed”
<Content>I was here for one night on business, and did not find it a particularly pleasant experience. Check-in was horrendously slow (the business traveller will recognise this bugbear), both in the queue and at the desk, none of the receptionists seemed to have a clue what they were doing and it took about 30 minutes from entering the lobby to getting into the room. Check-out was almost as bad. The rooms were okay if small, bed was pretty small and uncomfortable. Bathroom also small. The location was okay - have been in both better and worse, guess it depends where you are going - 5 minute walk from Tottenham Ct Road tube. On the plus side, a nice bar was attached to the hotel. In summary, if travelling for leisure and you get a good deal on this hotel, you should take it, but if it's not cheap, go elsewhere. If you're on business I would suggest that you go elsewhere.

<Content>As a family of four (2 kids 14,12) we booked two doubles. The hotel is quite big and located near Tottenham Court TUbe station and various buslines. Also only minutes walking from Covent Garden and less than 15 minutes to Soho(Leicester Sq. and Pic. Circus) Rooms are not too big (they are nowhere in this price category, most of them are smaller). Very clean, good beds, good English/Continental breakfast. No noise Best value so far for London.

<Title>“Great Hotel & Location”
<Content>my Wife and I stayed at the St Giles hotel during the May Bank holiday week end. The first point to make about this hotel is the location. Just off of tottenham court road at the bottom of oxford st. minutes from all the major london attractions. If you decide to drive to london the there is a secure car park in the depths of the hotel which is ideal. If staying at the hotel you get a discounted rate of £15 for 24 hours. The hotel itself is great the room we had was a double superior. It was quite small but very clean and comfortable. You had all the usual amenitees in the room including en suite shower room , tv , tea and coffee making facilities etc. There is a hotel bar and resturant which are very nice and all the staff make you feel very welcome. The conceirge are very helpful and can give you all the advice you need for a great stay in london. All in all a great hotel. its highly recomended and we will no doubt be staying here again.

<Title>“Best in London for the price”
<Content>I have been using St Giles Hotel for about 10 years and have absolutely no complaints whatsoever. You get what you pay for and in the case of St Giles, you get a whole lot more than at other hotels I have paid double the amount. The rooms are small, no question about it and it can be very hot and noisy during the summer as there is no air con in most of the rooms and if you open a window, the sound of the streets is overwhelming. That's because it's in the best location in town, right slap bang in the West End. I have stayed at some of the world's best hotels but for the money, St Giles beats them all - I just returned from a 2-day stay at £88 per night, upgraded to one of the hotels few executive rooms which included full buffet hot and cold breakfast in the rate (HotelsRus.com). I notice that some of the rooms are now being offered with flat screen TVs, aircon and full amenities, but obviously will be priced accordingly. Check the rate anyway as it's still going to work out cheaper than some of the fleapits masquarading as hotels in Central London. Rooms are always clean and well stocked, beds are comfortable and there are tea and coffee making facilities in every room. I wonder sometimes what some people expect for less than £100 P.N. in London?

<Title>“good central accomodation”
<Content>hi We found this hotel to be clean and suitable for our needs. Check in was quick and easy and our room was suitable for our needs which was as a base whilst we were in London for 3 days. The breakfast was a reasonably priced buffet with a selection of just about anything juice, cereal, croissant, bacon, sausages, hash browns, and eggs anyway you like them as long as it scrambled. The bed was comfortable and the shower was okay never really hot but suitable. The lifts took a long time in the morning and it was a long walk down the stairs, from our room anyway. The true appeal of this hotel would have to be the location. We were able to walk to the open air tour bus stop from the hotel which just happened to be next to the British Museum. We had to stop at this amazing art shop Cornellissen on the way and make a few purchases. We were able to easily walk to the theatre that showed les miserables and yes We Will Rock You is 2 doors down from the hotel. There is a Boots and Sainsburys on the same street, as well as a lovely japanese restaurant around the corner.(cant remember name sorry). Probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from Covent Gardens. I am sure all hotels do this but these guys held on to our luggage after checkout until we came back that night about 8 pm and would not give it to us without the ticket which i think is a good thing even though it took us ages to find it. What more do you need.

<Title>“Perfect Downtown Location”
<Content>We were extremely pleased with this hotel. The room was very clean and quite comfortable. The location was the best part of the stay. We were able to walk to nightspots and clubs and not have to worry about not being able to find a late night taxi or getting back before the tubes stopped running. The breakfast was also quite good. We have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and plan to return very soon.

<Title>“ideal location for short city trip, basic amenities”
<Content>It has all been said in other reviews: situation of the hotel is right in the centre, so you can walk easily to soho, chinatown, trafalgar square, british museum,... A 3-store bookshop nearby closes at 23.00h: perfect for my 14 yr old son who didn't want to go to bed too early but is still too young to go clubbing... And the breakfast is more than "continental". Downside: the rooms are not too spacious, there is no a/c, no bath (only shower), the lifts are indeed very slow (we took the stairs). But if you are not intent on staying in your hotel too long (and who does in London?), the location makes up for all this.

<Title>“Great!!”
<Content>After reading the reviews on TripAdvisor I thought the Hotel was going to be terrible but when I got there I was amazed! Its right near Oxford Street great for shoppers!! Walking distance to all the tourist places and walking distance to great pubs and clubs!!! The hotel room was a twin and wasn't small or smelly it was very clean, the window was a bit small so during the summer months i can imagine the room be very stuffy! The only problem we had was a bit of noise on the Monday morning from some construction work but other than that i enjoyed my stay and will return soon!

<Title>“Not what it was”
<Content>I booked the St Giles because it was convenient for where I was going and I'd stayed there before several years ago. On arrival, it took ages to check in because there were only three staff on the desk and a crowd of about 25 wanting to check in. They didn't seem to have the people or systems to process guests quickly. I'd provided all my details (name, address and credit card) on the website when booking, but I still had to complete a manual form. They still take prints of your card and don't have chip & pin equipment for cards. Checking out was also slow. They claim to be the biggest tourist hotel in London, and they have four very slow lifts. When I was there, it seemed like only one or two were working, which is poor for a high-rise hotel. I stood in the lift lobby on floor 5 and, having seen one lift go up from 5, had to wait for the same lift to come down again. I'd use the stairs, but not with my luggage. The single room was tiny, which is fine, but warm and stuffy. You can open the window (there's no air con), but the traffic and street noise is loud, until after midnight. Fortunately, they had provided a desk fan, which I left running all night. This hotel was fine when they were charging GBP79 per night, but it is now overpriced for what it offers in terms of comfort and service.

<Title>“A Mixed Bag”
<Content>My my my - isn't London a big place? Yes, of course it is. So you will be pleased to hear that you can stay right in the very center (well almost) of it at a reasonable price. Provided you choose the St Giles. The hotel is located on Bedford Avenue (between Holborn and Camden Town), the intersection of Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Street is a mere 100 meters away. You have access to the Tube via Tottenham Court Road Station (Central and Northern Lines). Oxford Street, Soho, the British Museum, Leicester Square, and even Piccadilly Circus are within a comfortable walking range. There is a variety of restaurants and snack bars in the vicinity, athough for a REALLY good meal I recommend the Marsala Zone, which is a bit further down Oxford St (on Marshall St, off Oxford Circus) and serves an amazing range of Indian specialties at a competitive price. Staff at the St Giles are generally helpful and the concierge service is above par. Breakfast is served buffet-style in a large breakfast room not unlike a company cafeteria or college dining hall. A good choice of hot and cold breakfast options, cereals, hot and cold drinks. So why have I not given the St Giles an "above average" rating? Simply, in one word: the ROOMS. Now, if you've read any of my other reviews, you will know that I'm not the kind of person who pays for budget accomodation and expects the Ritz. I also basically need my room for sleeping or napping, but not for much more. However, I do take offense when I check into a room and find the previous occupant's humongous TURD swimming in the toilet bowl. Ok, water pressure can be a bit low in London but this just tells me that room service did not bother to have a look (and probably didn't do a very good cleaning job in the first place). However, during the rest of the stay room service was ok. Maintenance staff also went out of their way to fix the door of our in-room safe and were very quick about it, too. Sheets were clean but there was a slightly musty smell in the corners of the room. Which leads me to something else: The room felt stifling hot (and this in April). I can't bear imagining what it must be like in August as there is no a/c and the windows do not open all the way. Wrapping it all up I do believe that the St Giles is a very good deal if you want to be in central London and are not willing to spend too much money. Just bring a fan and some air freshener and you'll be right as rain.

<Title>“Ideal for weekend”
<Content>Mar 31st -April 2nd We stayed in the St Giles Hotel for 2 nights mainly to see We Will Rock You at the Dominion Theatre which is a stones throw away. We found it to be very clean with good service from staff, the location is excellent for central London and we were able to see many sights easily on foot. We had arrived at the hotel with a good deal of trepidation having seen dreadful reviews on several websites claiming the hotel was dirty with bad service, these could not have been more wrong.The only things if we were being picky were noise at night especially Saturday from passing revellers which you expect in central London and breakfast a little chaotic on Sunday morning, (it was better on Monday) but quite adequate with a good selection of choices.

<Title>“Very central and good value for money in rip-off London”
<Content>I found the hotel to be very good and the only real complaint was that the pool was closed for maintenance, which was very annoying as this was one reason for booking the hotel. Our room was spacious and practical and had everything you could want. Reception staff were courteous and helpful and soon arranged for a blocked sink to be repaired promptly. This is a very big and very busy hotel, so breakfast was very busy, but there was a good range of food and staff worked efficiently to keep the dining area clear and clean. Because the hotel was so central we walked everywhere but were rather stunned that on the one occasion we did use the tube( when arriving from the station) it cost us £4 each, £4 being the minimum fare. Needless to say we walked back to the station!!! I know that a travel card costs just over £5, but we didn't need one. Cannot echo any of the criticisms contained in previous reviews. This visit confirmed for us that London truly is one of the most expensive cities in the world, but the St Giles is good value.

<Title>“Perfectly adequate”
<Content>Staff at reception were perfectly polite and efficient. Room was small, but clean and comfortable. Bathroom smelt of wee. I don't know why, but having been visiting a relative in an old people's ward for the last week I know what it smells like. When I got back from my meeting in the late afternoon to have a bath before going out for the evening there was a note under the door from the hotel management to say Thames Water were working in the area and the hotel's water had been turned off. It wasn't their fault, but it meant I couldn't have a wash before going out for the evening. As I walked out of the room I could hear the cistern beginning to fill up as the water came on again. Let's hope it was a one-off and won't happen to you... This is one of the most convenient hotels, for the price, in the whole of London: to be almost at the junction of Oxford Street, Charing Cross Road and Holborn is almost as good as it gets if you're wanting to do things in the area. I've stayed here four or five times in the last five years and it's always been okay- good value for the location. I would suggest holding your nose in the bathroom and if £104 for a double room to be in the centre of London sounds about right for you then you won't be disappointed.

<Title>“good weekend”
<Content>Just stayed Friday 23rd to Sunday 25th March 2007. A little apprehensive after reading reviews on trip advisor. Arrived at 5.30 pm, hotel reception not too busy and check-in staff very pleasant. Room in west tower on floor 6. Clean, good sized twin, plenty of wardrobe/cupboard space. Small but adequate bathroom. Good selection of hot & cold food for breakfast but VERY busy breakfast room after 8am. Superb location for theatre land, Oxford Street etc and straight down the Northern line tube from Waterloo to Tottenham Court road then 2 minutes walk to hotel. Good value for money in central London.

<Title>“Appalling, absolutely appalling!”
<Content>I had booked a twin room and ended up with the smallest single room I have ever seen, apparently there was no availability even though I had the booking details in front of me. The staff were rude and unhelfpul, not to mention untrained. The check out procedure was an utter nightmare and took around 15 minutes. Another piece of advice... check you credit card / bank statements after you have paid. I was charged twice for the same stay. Apparently this was normal procedure as they take a guarantee from your card.... however a week after checking out the money has still not been refunded into my account even though my bank tells me this is something that can be done instantly. I really recommend to stay away from this hotel.... much more hassle than its worth.

<Title>“Absolutely disgusting!”
<Content>This hotel was absolutely disgusting. The reception is not bad and the hotel staff are very friendly, but when I went up to my room, things went wrong pretty quickly... When I got out of the lift, I was greeted by an overwhelming smell of urine and had to walk through stained halls before I got to my room. When I walked in, my room was incredibly shabby. On my bed, the sheets had not been washed, and appeared to have urine stains on them. In addition, the towels in the bathroom had not been bleached, and you could see faint stains on them. The room was so sickening, I went straight back down to reception and immediately checked out, refusing to pay. Yuck!

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>I booked this hotel with some friends for one night, the location is great, and we could walk everywhere we wanted to go. When we arrived the lobby looked well, but as we arrived at 11 am everyone was checking out and the queues were long and slow, it seemed to be very badly organised. However they did have rooms ready that we could use, although check in wasn't until 2 pm. The rooms though are tiny, we could put up with it as it was only one night, we were in twin rooms with a small overnight bag each but if you were staying longer these rooms are not suitable. In one room the bathroom was an ok size, in the other it was just absurd, you had to turn sideways squeeze past the loo to get to the shower and there was no bath. We didn’t have breakfast in the hotel so I can’t comment. We had a drink in the bar, the prices were ok for a hotel bar however the service was very slow and they couldn’t make two of the cocktails we asked for, as they didn’t have the ingredients. The hotel is very reasonably priced for a central London hotel, and is clean so if you want to spend your money on the rest of your weekend’s entertainment and simply sleep in the hotel, then you should book here.

<Title>“Expected better!”
<Content>I stayed at St Giles on 24th February 2007 with my mum for one night. Generally ok, but a few problems. 1 - The service at reception was slow and a little infuriating. We were sent back and forth between reception and the luggage storage. After waiting for about 15 minutes to be served in a very hot reception we eventually got checked in and were then able to leave our luggage. 2 - The room smelt slightly of a chemical toilet. The size and decor were standard for a hotel in the centre of london and the bathroom was average, shower was nice. 3 - When we returned to the room after dinner the room was very hot. I had to open the window all night to keep the room at a normal temperature. Unfortunately, as it was a saturday night, the party goers were out in force and seemed to camp outside our window and scream for no reason until 5am (we were on the fifth floor), I of course do not blame the hotel for hysterical drunk people, but had the room been a normal temperature i would have been able to keep the window shut. Luckily I had earplugs and managed to get to sleep about 5.30am. 4 - Breakfast was varied, lots of different types of cereal, cooked breakfast and fruit.

Good reception team, excellent pool (ymca) below the hotel for £3. The buffet breakfast was superb. Location ideal for the theatre ( i went to see Equus ) a short 5min walk from the hotel. I will certainly book the St Giles again.

<Title>“Never Again! Don't go there!”
<Content>We have just returned from a weekend in London and we were extremely disappointed with the St Giles a pure disaster! 1. We arrived on Friday at approx 12.00 and upon check in there was no rooms available the receptionist was on work experience and took about 10mins to find our booking she finally found it and then we had to store or luggage with concerige who I have to say were very helpful. 2. Arrived back at hotel at 5.00pm to be given our room. We waiting approx 15mins for lifts then we went into our room and I have never smelt anything like it the fusty smell, the dirty stains on the carpet we were afraid to take our shoes and socks off. and there was no room to even open our suitcases such a squash. Then as we were heading out to theatre for a show we had to get ready the shower was luke warm and then would not turn off we had to call maintenance up, then the toilet would not flush and there was 1 plug in a room for 3 people - no plugs for hairdryer, laptop, phone charger a bloody joke and the power kept on cutting out, the towels were stinking just not acceptable at all....at this we called reception and demaned another room and they arrived up in 10mins and gave us another room which to be fair was cleaner and the smell was much better than the last hovel. Went out for our night out and dreaded going back to the hotel, I have never seen the likes of this before maybe we just got a few bad rooms as they were triple rooms and in what looks like an old part of the hotel. 3. At 8.30am on Sat morning there was the hammering of nails and a drill going that really finished it for us we simply got up, got dressed and checked out and went to a hotel in Mayfair 4* and only cost £20.00 extra in comparison to St Giles. The hotel lobby was busy and this hotel must do well but it really was a horrible place I really wished I had booked into a travel lodge as it would have been half the price and clean.. basic but clean the the St Giles is very basic and a dirty hole at that. Very disappointed and we have stayed at many 3 star hotels but you would really be better in a hostel or a travel lodge this hotel is definetly one to be missed!!!!!!! To be fair the staff were very good its not their fault the place is so run down the hotel just needs bulldosed and these people given jobs in a decent hotel. Thank god we got another hotel cos if we had to stay here all weekend it really would have spoilt our whole weekend!

<Content>We booked this hotel for three nights, because my daughter had booked tickets for a show in the West End for us as part of a Christmas present. This hotel is in a prime position in the West End. We where looking for a budget cost hotel. We found the rooms small but very comfortable with good beds, the breakfast was plentiful with good selection of food. We decided to use the hotel for our main meals at night (before going out) and we where not disappointed .This was our first visit to London, we managed two shows and a bit of sight seeing. We will return later in the year to this hotel.

Rooms on the small side but what else do you need when you are in London!! Breakfast - wide selection - something to suit everyone. The hotel also hosts 3 restaurants - Italian yummy - Chinese slightly overpriced but good food nonetheless. Would definitely stay here again!

<Title>“Tiny room, great location”
<Content>I've stayed in The St Giles lots of times over the years. The rooms are tiny but fine if you're not going to be in the room for long - and as long as you're not too big and bulky and neither is your luggage! The position is great - right on the corner of Oxford Street/Tottenham Court Road and one minute from Tottenham Court Road tube. The bar and 'restaurant' are pretty dire but you're five minutes walk from Covent garden - why would you eat or drink in the hotel?! One BIG benefit - the biggest gym and pool complex in London (I think) is under the hotel and you get direct access for only £3. Note though: The gym is very gay friendly - if an appreciative glance (or stare if you're attractive!) in the showers is going to upset you - steer clear - or go back to your room to shower!

<Title>“Absolutely fine for the money!!”
<Content>Booked a single room with [--] - £50.00 inc breakfast in central London - midweek......I have to say I was dreading what I would get for the money.....however I was more than pleasantly suprised! 1. Location - perfect - couldn't be faulted. Two minutes from Tottenham Court Road tube station - buses running past every few minutes - most central locations easily accessible on foot. 2. Check In - fast, courteous, friendly. 3. Room - a single - probably best described as compact, but nicely furnished with tv, phone, tea & coffee facilities - and lets be honest...I wasn't planning a party!! Bathroom was a shower only, but again - absolutely fine. 4. Breakfast - as much as you can eat buffet - tea/coffee, cereals, fruit, juices, croissants, danish, plus of course the usual fry up. I couldn't say it was cordon bleu, but it was absolutely fine. The breakfast room was hugely busy, but plenty of tables, and speedy clearing away meant that you weren't hunting for a place to sit. 5. Great leisure facilities - pool, gym etc...available for a token fee ( £3.00 I think) however not for me...I preferred a stroll to Covent Garden and a nice meal in a little bistro! Overall - highly recommended for a good, cheap, clean, safe and comfortable hotel in central London.

Went to the London eye that was great stopped in a pub in westminster for a drink en route that was good too ! Had alovely evening meal in one of the Angus Steakhouses good too ! Then returned to St Giles - Had a drink in the very smokey bar which was full of kids with loud music playing, went up to our room, couldnt get off to sleep because of the noise coming from outside. We were on the 7th floor and it sounded like the traffic shared the room with us, Anyway if you are going I hope this is an honest review for you to read.. I sound like I didnt enjoy our break but Honestly I did!!!

<Title>“Recommend St Giles”
<Content>The St. Giles in centrally located by Tottenham Court Road underground. You can walk to the theatres in soho, the British Museum. There is a Boots pharmacy and Sainsbury supermarket across the steet. Staff were extremely helpful. Eventhough it is on a busy street, the double paned windows really work. Only problem that the room is not well lit. There are two small desk lamps with low wattage. Had to ask for an additional desk lamp to work and they accomodated me instantly. Would recommend this hotel. Large room by UK standards. Book through their site for great deals.

<Title>“fantastic”
<Content>Stayed in this hotel in Jan, and have done a couple of times previously. The rooms are small but its central London. The staff are friendly and helpful - sometimes you have to queue at peak times to check in or out but I have found if you avoid these times its very quick.On the one occassion I had a problem with the shower I spoke to a very helpful duty manager who moved me straight away to another room. These managers I am informed are on duty 24hours a day to assist with any problems. Excellent service.

<Title>“St Giles is fine”
<Content>Having read other reviews I was a bit apprehensive but it seemed to be well-located for the west-end and for general sightseeing. Some people are obviously hard to please because I found the hotel to be fine, staff helpful and general standard good. Yes the bedrooms are not big but ours was on the 11th floor and was clean with a very comfortable bed. We were booked on a B&B basis and while it can be a bit like a school canteen there was a good selection of fruit, cereals and cooked breakfast. The dining room was particularly busy on the Saturday morning but a little patience goes a long way. Our room was serviced each day and we had no complaints. The location on the edge of Soho, close to theatres and shopping, as well as the tube and buses was really handy. All in all a very good value hotel for the price and one which I would have no difficulty recommending to anyone. I intend to return. By the way dont miss "We will rock you" in the Dominion Theatre beside the hotel.In a word Fantastic.

<Title>“Could not wait to get out of there!”
<Content>After spending what seemed like an eternity checking we were horrified when we got to our room. Ok we had heard the rooms were small but it was beyond a joke. The room had a disgustin smell to it (we were staying in a non smoking room) that we could smell from outside the door and once we got in it took a whole lot of deoderant to make it bearable. There was mould in the shower, the toilet had not been bleeched in years and the water would not drain from the sink due to a mountain of hair in the plug hole which i refused to clean. The pillows on the bed were so old they were practiclly as falt as pancaes and with only one each i can tell you i didnt sleep much. After waking very early with the most horrible back ache we decided to go for our breakfast which was very much like a school canteen with no one speaking english and the food not very apertising. Sorry to anyone who likes this hotel but this was booked as a birthday present from my boyfiend who spend the reast of the next couple of days apologising for ruining it for me. The only good thing about this hotel is its location.

<Title>“Great Soho experience at the St Giles”
<Content>We (party of 4) stayed at the St Giles over New Years for 2 nights, having booked directly through the hotel's website for 89 pounds/night. Main reason to book this hotel was location - you can't beat its proximity to the theater district and rest of Soho. Check-in went smoothly with friendly and helpful front-desk staff. We were given 2 rooms on the seventh floor. Room was quite small (but I've seen much smaller in London) but hey, what do you expect in London at these prices.. More importantly the room was clean and looked new or at least recently renovated. Bathroom was very nice, marble and impeccably clean. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, partly since we understood it would be very busy (staff even posted in the elevators mentioning this!). Instead, we opted to go out to one of the many Pret A Manger and Starbucks places, closest of which are only a 5 mins walk away. Regular concierge service was available, which proved very useful for storing luggage on the day we left, arranging taxis etcetera. Main disappointment at the hotel was the (un)availability of the elevators. Morning, day and night - there is almost always a queue at the ground floor elevators. That, and the fact that the elevators are quite small was a bit annoying. My overall experience with this hotel has been positive and I would certainly stay here again.

<Title>“Small but great location”
<Content>I've stayed here twice. Stayed in a double room with my wife. While definitely small, private bathroom was much appreciated. You can get breakfast as well, which is good if you're hung over! I will say that if you're 6 feet tall or taller you will have to stoop kind of low for the shower head. The concierges are very helpful and can arrange for theater tickets for you. Also, the location is outstanding, right near the Tottenham Court Road tube stop and near the British Museum.

<Content>We stayed at this hotel as part of theatre break. Despite some of the reviews i was optimistic. I neednt have worried the hotel was lovely, the room wasnt a palacial suite but who needs that when your in london, it was in an excellant location right next to tothenham court rd tube, the breakfast was fine and everything was clean. They also let you keep your bags there after you have checked out with no charge. I will definately use the hotel again and recommend it to any friends.

<Title>“Always stay here!”
<Content>I have stayed at the St Giles 3 times this year. The location is fabulous, the rooms may be compact, but you are in the west end FFS! I have stayed a couple of streets down, in the Berner's Hotel, which is more expensive, and still tiny rooms. The hotel allows you to pay £3 to use the gym below for the entire duration of your stay. The breakfast is good, as long as it is included in the price of your stay. This hotel is so busy it does take a while to check in and out, but that is the price you pay for budget accomodation in the city. I have recommended this place to loads of people, and they have returned too since their first visits. Absolutly fabulous base for any london break, right next to "we will rock you" and close to the rest of the theatre discrict, and soho, and a 2 min walk to oxford street.

<Title>“Value for Money”
<Content>Stayed here on the Thursday 14th December for a works christmas night out in Mayfair ideal location for central london. The hotel reception was very busy for booking in and booking out, but I expected this. The room we stayed in was an average size for a twin room the bathroom was small but as you dont sleep in the bathroom who cares however on the subject of the bathroom the shower was slow and the tap to turn on and off the shower was loose or broken I think broken. If this is my only moan which it is that aint bad The Hotel in general its ideal for no more than a couple of nights stay the bar has excellant facillities it looks trendy and modern and the range of drinks are plenty to chose from the actual bar itself is small and service when busy is slow However you would of thought running up to the xmas week and call me old fashioned the idea of more bar staff would be good idea and English is a good language to kick off with but hey ho I got served eventually so if your thinking of staying here give it a go its clean and very pleasant and for central london the prices are very good

<Title>“Great Location!! Great Hotel”
<Content>I stayed at the St Giles the other night for 2 nights and I could not have asked for a better stay in such a prome location. The hotel is located on Tottenham Court Road bu walk through Virgin and you are on Oxford Street so in an excellent location for shopping. The Dominion theatre (showing 'we will rock you') is located about 3/4 doors down from the hotel and about 5-10 mins walk from such shows as the sound of music and mary poppins. I stayed at the hotel a part of a weekend of shopping and to see Dirty Dancing. The hotel is about 20 mins walk from Aldwych where the show was which was fine for what I wanted and the short walk from Oxford Street (literally across the road) was idealic. My sister and I had a twin room and the size was on par with alot of London hotels that I have stayed in and compared with the numerous hotels that I have stayed in (which is loads as I work for a travel firm) was of a good standard. The rooms were clean, warm and the beds comfortable. Check in/check out was quick and efficient with no problems. The breakfast was fine, it is a bit like canteen styley but the food tasted fine and was plenty for what I wanted with a choice of cereals, croissants, rolls, hot breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon, beans, hash browns), fruit, cold cheese and ham, yogurt etc. We got the original sightseeing tour bus from round the corner frrom the hotel in great russell street and for £18.00 for two days worth of bus travel around london (winter offer) was fantastic. We did not use the tour for the sightseeing but for our main transport around the city as it goes to madame tussauds, london dugeons, london eye etc etc. Not only do you get 2 days worth of travel for the price of one at the moment but you also get a free river cruise up the thames which was a nice relaxing trip to end one day. The hotel uses Great Russell Street underground car park. If you drive into London an park there give your parking ticke to he concierge and he will put an extra barcode on it to get you the prking half price!!! Well worth knowing considering it is around £30 per day normally. The hotel was an all round good stay and I will definitely be going back.

<Title>“Third time around ....”
<Content>I stayed at the St Giles for the third time, for 3 nights last week. Our double room was pretty small - I think it's a bit of a lottery as to what size your room is (last time I booked a single and was put in a twin room, which was about 3 times the size of our double). The bathroom was also tiny, but it was clean and adequate, seeing as we only really wanted somewhere to sleep and shower. Checking in and out was quick and efficient; didn't really have any other contact with the staff. Two complaints: the kettle didn't work, but we couldn't be bothered to complain about it. Second, the shower wasn't great - it was never hot, usually warm, and once was barely lukewarm, which wasn't very pleasant at all! Again, couldn't be bothered to complain. Despite this, every time I go to London the St Giles will be the first place I book. You absolutely will not get a better location for this kind of price.

<Title>“location, location , location!”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at the St Giles off Tottenham Court Road in mid november. The location cannot be beaten for access to oxford street , the west end and central london, being about 60 yards from centrepoint tower at the corner of oxford st/ tottenham ct/ charing cross. The hotel looks a bit forbidding, being as it is a bit 1960's multi-storey brutalist architecture, but the lobby and bar downstairs are more welcoming. When we arrived, the hotel was booking in a conference (i gather they do a lot, by the notice boards) but we were quickly booked in to our room on the 9th floor (the hotel has 11 floors) As other reviewers have noted, the rooms are small. But then again, i've never syated in london for a reasonable price in a room that wasn't. That said, the room was clean, in excellent condition, we had a view out over the city to the southwest, the bed was comfortable and the shower/ bathroom excellent (another common complaint in some london hotels) The bar downstairs (along with the restaurant) was modern, staff were friendly. When we were leaving, the concierge (who was portuguese) very kindly carried our bags up the street, got us a taxi (at rush hour). The room was cleaned well every afternoon while we were out. TV in room could use more channels, it only has the basics. However, overall, i would reccommend this hotel, ands will stay again.

<Title>“No visible improvements”
<Content>I stayed here again in November, but only because the hotel had already been booked through an agency. My complaints this time are that there was no hot water in the shower or wash basin and that one of the two intrenet outlets wasn't working. Breakfast was worse than before - still like a canteen, but with half the self-service coffee machines not working. Reception staff are smashing, but I want a decent room, a hot shower and a good breakfast.

<Title>“Never. Ever. Again”
<Content>Where do I begin. Oh yes. How about...with the smell. The good news is that the smell of mold overpowered the smell of the dust. Stay here only if you are allergy-free. Or if you are anosmic. Speaking of mold -- back in college we wore flip flops to the shower. I should have brought mine for this stay. The size of the room: There was once an old lady who lives in a shoe: I now know how she felt. The temperature of the room, as well as the water in the shower, was luke-warm at best. The room heater is located under the tiny dressing table, allowing a miniscule amount of the heat to escape to the tiny closet that is the atrociously overpriced quarters you have purchased. Funny, you would think the heater would be able to cater to the entire 4m x 5m area. That is, unfortunately, not the case. Which doesn't matter so much, given that the equally as tiny window overlooking...the west wing of the hotel..opens a fraction of an inch. There is no room service available. There is laundry service. There are 6.5 channels on television. (The .5 is the channel with the lousy reception). The decor is a delightful blend of both puke-brown and elephant-grey, with little touches of black-shaving-like texttures peeking out from the tears in the wallpaper towards the bottom. Oh yes: You will be lucky not to wake up with spring marks on your back. Bottom line: Great location, but that's all you're paying for. You will do best to choose another hotel.

<Title>“Awful. You couldn't swing a cat in the room.”
<Content>We had such high hopes for our stay in London for my 30th birthday but it all came to a bit of a stop when we booked into the St. Giles Hotel. You can't fault the location being 1 mins walk from Tottenham Court Road tube station; but that for me was the only good thing about the experience. Do not stay here if you want to spend much time relaxing. The reception hall looked promising but once in the lift listioning to the lift music warblng I started to get worried. On getting to the room we were shocked as it was so small that the queen size double took up the entire room. There was no where to standup, let alone sit down. I have to say that it has to been the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. I stood next to the bed and tried to put my coat on and banged my elbow on the wall. We were not able to open the window properly and the waft of urine was unpleasant when walking through the door. The breakfast room was like a Motorway Service Station and the food was cold. Needless to say we spent as little time at the hotel as possible during our two night stay.

<Title>“The St Giles was fine!”
<Content>I stayed in the St Giles hotel as a short break in Aug 05 and thought it was fine, the staff were very friendly, the rooms were small but who actually stays in their room all day in London to worry about the size?? I just used the room as a base. The breakfast was yummy and it was a self serve buffet with hot and cold food to chose from and was eat as much as you like. I went to London for a shopping break and to see some sights, and the St Giles is great for this, its ssoo close to Oxford Street which is amazing for shopping, its also very close to all public transport such as train, tube and bus stations The rooms wern't hot and stuffy at all and the batroom was fine- nice and clean. I'm a travel agent and can be fussy about where i stay and I found the St Giles to be just fine.

<Title>“Basic but clean”
<Content>I stayed at the St Giles hotel for one night with work in September. I looked on Trip Advisor as soon as I found out which hotel I had been booked into and I have to say I was a little apprehensive as a result! However, I didn't encounter any of the problems that other people have complained about. The staff were friendly and efficient. The room was small, but was adequate. From the look of the floor plan in the corridor, my room was the second smallest in the hotel but it was still big enough to fit two single beds with space in-between. The bathroom was very small, but again was sufficient. There was a shower rather than a bath, but the water pressure was good and the shower didn't flood the bathroom as another reviewer found. The room was very clean and rather than smelling bad it actually smelt quite strongly of air freshener, right through to the next morning. The bed had sheets and a duvet on so I was able to sleep with just a sheet as it was a hot night. The restaurant didn't look great and I decided not to eat there but the location of the hotel means that there were numerous other options for evening meals all within a short walk. All in all the hotel was better than I expected based on the reviews here and at the end of the day you get what you pay for - the hotel is good value for money and in a great location. It isn't luxurious by any stretch of the imagination but I won't complain if I'm booked in there again next time I'm working in London.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay”
<Content>We booked the St. Giles as part of a theatre break despite the reviews on Trip advisor. My view is if your in London sightseeing how much time do you want to spend in your hotel anyway. The hotel had everything you would need. Clean bed, clean shower, lovely breakfast, good food in the restaurant and very nice helpful staff. Yes the rooms are quite small but had everything we needed, bed, bedside tables, t.v. safe, tea/coffee, hairdryer. You couldn't get a better location. We walked to Oxford St. Covent Garden, Soho, British Museum, Trafalgar Square and the Thames. I have recommended the St. Giles to friends who are visiting London.

<Title>“For the price and location the hotel is very good value.”
<Content>Stayed in a standard double room for two nights. The room rate was £73 per night, booked with hotelsrus.com. The hotel itself is very busy, and the location is fantastic, the standard room is very small and does not have air con so it can get a bit warm, but as we had planned a busy few days with shows etc. we only required a room for washing and sleeping in and the room easily catered for our needs. Although the room was fairly clean, the same parts did get missed, so there was lots of dust on the top of the units, and rubbish between the bedside table and bed. Reception and shared areas smelt of sewage, the gym/pool was out of use due to a technical fault. The breakfast (from 6.30am - 10.30am) was plentiful with a good choice available and you could eat as much as you like as it was all self service, but the restaurant is far to small for the size of the hotel and finding a seat was difficult. Would I stay here again? Yes. Would I recommend it for a short break? Yes all in all for the price and location the hotel is very good value.

<Title>“ok hotel, great location, would stay again!”
<Content>My brother and I stayed here for 9 nights from August 23. to September 1. We had a great vacation in London. Our room was facing the street in the 6.th floor of the hotel. It was a twin room and knowing the size of rooms in London it was a normal / average room - not tiny and not large. It was clean! I normally would not have booked this hotel because of all the bad reveiws and ratings here but since I had to book the hotel through a tourist company in my home town I had no choise. I was expecting a horrible hotel but was pleasently surprised! Yes there is a lot of noise coming from the street. What do you expect in the middle of London. If you close the window like we did it it will not bother you. Ofcourse in very hot weather things wiil be different..... And Yes there really are a strange smell of urin in the room......My brother and I was joking about it before we went that we most likely would have to breathe through our mouth. Since we had been warned about it it acually did not bother us that much all though it was rather strange. We kept the windows open while we where out during the day and that kept the smell down. the breakfast was swell - I really cannot complain. scrambled eggs, lots of bacon, beans and what have you. cereals to your hearts content and coffe / cappuchino machine and fruits for dessert. The seating area can resemble a cantine but remember that the hotel is huge with 600-700 rooms The staff at the front desk was very helpful and booked us a guided tour to Stonehenge. I have no complains at all conserning the service. My brother and I wanted to see lots of shows when in London. We love theatre and was able to get great tickets at the tickets office at leicester square (look out for scams that want to sell you really bad tickets - there are so many of them and i have been set up at prior visits to London - make sure you find the roundshape ticket office next to the park. That is the real ticket office) We got great tickets for both Stomp and Fool for love ( 25 pounds for stall tickets) with Juliette Lewis.(my brother really likes her) and strangely enough we passed by her in the hotel lobby one night......kind of cool All in all a good tourist hotel. It is close to everything from The british museum to shopping in oxford street. The tube station tottenham court road is a few minutes away wich takes you directly to Liverpool street station where trains to Stansted airport depart freqently.

<Title>“Executive room stay”
<Content>Stayed in an executive double room for two nights. The room rate was £129 per night, booked directly on the hotel website. GOOD POINTS: The hotel itself is quiet, the location is very busy though, so I wouldn't of slept well with the window open, hence I went for an executive room with air conditioning, which is very effective. The ensuite shower room was excellent, a good shower and clean. The room had a double bed which was a bit soft but slept okay. The pillows have a polyester filling, so ideal if you suffer a feather allegy like me! The room has a good LCD tv, but only five channels. The room is double glazed, window the whole width of the room, covered with fixed horizontal slats. DISLIKED: There is not a lot of storage space, wouldn't fancy staying there any longer than two days. The rooms aren't particularly spacious. Although the room was fairly clean, the same parts get missed, so there was lots of dust on the slats covering the windows, and rubbish between the bedside table and bed. Reception and shared areas smelt of sewage, even on the 7th floor. The gym/pool could not be used due to a technical fault, although this is provided by a third party independent of the hotel.

<Title>“Good Hotel, Great Location”
<Content>We were booked into this hotel as part of a theatre break. Having read the negative reviews, I was really worried about staying here but was pleasantly surprised. We forgot to take the address with us and couldn't remember where it was. Having got to the general vicinity, we phoned the Concierge (via directory enquiries) who gave us fantastic directions to the hotel. The check in staff were helpful and the room was on the 8th floor. As we had requested a quiet room, high up, we were very pleased. The room was clean and well equipped but compact. How much time are you honestly going to spend in your room though when you are in central London? As the hotel is literally 30 seconds walk off the Tottenham Court Road, the location is excellent. The room was also well sound proofed. From the corridor we could hear the next door room's television but from inside our room, we couldn't hear a thing. We didn't surface until 9.45am and certainly weren't disturbed by any cleaners, even though we didn't hang the do not disturb sign up. The breakfast (from 6.30am - 10.30am) was plentiful with a good choice available and you could eat as much as you like as it was all self service. The guest lounge also has a free coffee machine. There are vending machines on all floors and my top tip is buy your bottled water here. At 50p for a chilled bottle of mineral water, you won't find cheaper in central London (well maybe in Sainsburys Direct 30 seconds down the road). There is also an ice machine by the lifts in the lobby which is useful. Would I stay here again? Yes. Would I recommend it for a short break? Yes. Having stayed in countless hotels all over the world, this really wasn't bad.

<Title>“ok for a short visit!!”
<Content>First of all this hotel is sold as a three star hotel. Don't expect anything more than a 2 star+. On the plus side the hotel is in a great loction, two mins from oxford street and the tube. You can get the tube directly from heathrow almost to the hotel. I found the hotel staff fine. The overall impression of the hotel is that it is a little run down and in need of refurbishment. When we entered our very small room the smell of aerosol air freshener nearly knocked us out, never a good thing...what smell are they trying to hide? , we actually had to open the window and go for a walk!!!. The bathroom/shower was a little dingy and far from inviting. We thought the breakfasts were good with pleanty to go around. I would recomend this hotel as a place to sleep on a short trip, but not for anything more than two nights. Cheap, good location, ok breakfast. Could be cleaner, small rooms, needs a revamp.

<Title>“Terrible hotel, never again”
<Content>This has honestly got to be the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Right from the moment we stepped through the front door, it was awful. The first person we spoke to was at reception and they could hardly speak english. We had to repeat ourselves 2 or 3 times. When we got into the room we couldn't believe how small it was. You literally have to walk like a crab to get around in the room! the cleaners are very rude as well. every morning she would batter the door at about 8 o'clock then when we replied with the obligatory 'we're sleeping' we got a tirade of abuse!! The whole hotel has a funny smell about it that is quite something. To top things off, when i returned home and checked my bank account i discovered that the hotel had charged me twice for my stay!!! The only good thing the hotel has going for it is it's location but that is it.

<Title>“Actually, surprisingly not too bad!”
<Content>OK, first i booked the hotel for a 3 night break to surprise my boyfriend on his birthday, and THEN i read these reviews!!! BIG MISTAKE! So, i thought, it cant be that bad can it??? After our 3 hour train journey up there, i was dreading the shoebox rooms etc etc. But we finally arrived at the hotel, and we were greeted with the lovelyest conceirge staff who whisked our bags from the taxi up to check-in. Good start! Then got to our room and i was prepared, so i was actually pleasantly surprised that our room had amny luxurys of a 4*, the small things, such as a tv/radio, kettle (+ free sachets!!) Shampoo/ showergel etc! Shoe shine wipes, shower cap, hairdryer. The only complaints i really had were the shower- it flooded the floor, which was just annoying. The heat- but come on, lets face it is the middle of July, and i was delivered a fan. And the lifts- 4 for 11 floors. But when you book this hotel, we are all fully aware that this is somewhat a budget hotel, so what are you expecting??! The Hotel and bar were lovely and my Cannelloni was the nicest meal i have had in a long while. Maybe we were just lucky and had one of the best rooms, who knows?

<Title>“NEVER AGAIN”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel for one night in June. All the other hotels my company uses in London were fully booked, due to Wimbledon, but this one wasnt...surprise, surprise....now I know why! At check-in, the queue was 20 deep, the wait was 15 minutes. Lift out of action twice because of fire alarms, so wait again. One ice machine with plastic cups by the lifts was for the whole hotel, I understand because I was refused ice at the bar. The room was so very small, with an overpowering smell of urine. I had work to do, but the workspace was a small shelf, and the lighting was poor. Back to reception. I explained my company had booked a superior room, but the receptionist said that was a superior room ! I hate to imagine what their standard rooms are like. Got a room change. This one was SLIGHTLY bigger. It was a hot day, and as the hotel does not have air conditioning, I opened the window. This room faced directly onto Tottenham Court Rd., and the noise was deafening. Police sirens etc. I couldnt concentrate on my work because of the noise, and knew I wouldnt be able to sleep, so went back again to reception. Room change was worse than the first one! This one also stank of urine, and I had to work on this "shelf". Lighting again poor, bed rock hard, towels threadbare, carpets dirty and smelly, but at least it was quiet. Never seen shower gel and shampoo in tiny plastic sachets before either. Breakfast was like going into a canteen. Tables bare, you picked up your food, and cutlery, and found a space....never met this before, either. Lukewarm bacon and beans, dried up sausages and no fried eggs. The strangest thing was NO TOAST!!. Apparently they dont serve toast at breakfast!!! The good thing was checkout was quick, because I couldnt wait to get out.

<Title>“Bring your own eye mask !”
<Content>We stayed at the St Giles Hotel as part of a three-night hotel and theatre package. This hotel seems to cater for groups, coach parties, and for individual travellers on a budget. It is in the same massive tower block as the YMCA and the bedrooms and dining facilities reflect some features of a YMCA hostel. The standard of the accommodation is fairly basic – and is substandard in many respects. This hotel certainly does not merit the three-star description, awarded by our travel agency. Our bedroom was very small but appeared to be clean. It provided the basic necessities for a short stay - with an en-suite bathroom, TV, telephone, closet, a safe, and tea & coffee-making facilities. However, there were several holes in the bedding. The tiny bathroom offered a shower only – but no bath. The washbasin taps dripped continuously and the shower had very basic controls only – so the temperature of the shower fluctuated from "rather cool" to “almost warm”. Our bedroom window was triple glazed, which provided good protection against noise from the street - provided we kept the window closed. Our visit coincided with a period of hot weather - so the resulting lack of ventilation meant that our room became hot and stuffy. The only bedding comprised top and bottom sheets, with a winter-weight duvet, which was far too heavy for the month of June. Consequently, we did not sleep very well. Furthermore, our bedroom had no curtains (drapes) – only translucent Venetian blinds, which did not prevent bright sunlight from waking us at sunrise. On a more positive note, we were very happy with the hot buffet breakfast (included in our three-night package). The breakfast room was not luxurious and was often very busy – so guests sometimes had to wait for a table to become vacant. However the rapid turnover meant that the food was always hot and fresh. The quality of the tea, coffee and other beverages was excellent – and far better than in some four-star hotels. The hotel invites its guests to use the YMCA gym, fitness centre, and swimming pool complex in the basement. Not many hotels in this category offer leisure facilities of this calibre – and the charge of GBP3 per person (which covers the entire duration of the guest’s stay at the hotel) is very reasonable. The facilities at Hotel St. Giles are rather similar to a Travelodge or other budget chain. However, the nearby Travelodge is not prepared to offer luggage storage facilities following checkout. Hotel St Giles is happy to provide secure luggage storage for up to 24 hours, free of charge – which can be a major bonus, particularly if a visitor wants to explore London following check-out. This is a mixed review. Some aspects of the hotel were good – others were very disappointing. However, the location in the West End of London is ideal for a theatre package, shopping, and sightseeing. So would I stay there again? Perhaps – but only if the price was right! And I would certainly recommend the use of an eye mask – to compensate for the lack of bedroom curtains.

<Title>“Budget hotel with problems but I could stay there again.”
<Content>The plus side: the most important thing is the excelent location (room over the back streets are less noisy). Prices are ok (their website is the best bet), breakfast is plenty and quite good. The minus side: very small rooms and bathrooms (shower room in fact), unwelcoming, a bit too old, over used. Rooms tend to be hot (I went there in June) and there was no bed sheet (only duvet). I had to leave the window open, but couldn't sleep because of the noise. (Then I learned to open the double-glazed window fully, sometimes the door too to let the wind thru, to cool off the room before sleeping.) I have stayed twice at this hotel and I had problems with the staff on both times. I had to wait three days for them to fix a broken basin sink. Also the porters charged us to keep our luggage for the rest of the afternoon (£1 per each suitcase). This was quite unexpected. All in all, we survived. I could stay there again, aware I would be trading comfort for location. The hotel is crowded, breakfast is stressy, there are queues, music elevator is awful :-), the rooms could be better (if they only could enhance their bathrooms.), but you save a lot of time in getting fast to London main attractions.

<Title>“Great Location, Good Price, Good Hotel, But Small Rooms”
<Content>You need to be careful sometimes when you are in London because you could over pay for hotels that are not as good. For the St. Giles, this is the bottom line: - Location is great, wow .. prime location close to Oxford St and shopping areas, great for folks looking for Computer stuff, dozens of shops next door. - Service is average. - This is a clean hotel, but not very clean, it is not a new hotel, but not bad over all. - Rooms are small, this is what i didn't like - The hotel staff are friendly and helpful, if you had to check out, you could leave your stuff at the hotel - No A/C in the rooms, that I did not like at all. There was a fan. - If your room face the street, it is very noisy all night, try to get a room away from the street - there is a bar that is open until after midnight, nice ... - Internet access available in the lobby with HI-FI but it is expensive, better to check internet cafe across the street for GBP 1.00 / hour. - Ideal for young people who enjoy dynamic and active time in London - The best way is to book online because they put very good prices on their website, better than going through an agent. But, please note the online price does not include the breakfast, you will need to pay GBP 10.00 or better yet, go across the street. - This is a busy area in London and there many places to check out, within walking distace. 2 Borders stores within 5 and 15 minutes walk.

<Content>I stayed in this hotel on 15th May 2006. I had a single room which was more like a shoe box, the room was on the 6th floor and the floors were like a rabbit warren. Breakfast was basic to say the least. Would definately NOT stay in this hotel again.

<Title>“OK hotel, great gtm”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel on 22nd May and it's a case of somethings are very good, and some things are very bad. The staff are very friendly and the location is very good. I paid £78 per night through my company's deal which is great value for central London. My room was clean as was the hotel, although it could do with a little refurbishment. The gym / swimming pool / squash court / cliimbing wall / badminton court area is really good. It appears to be part of a larger gym that happens to be attached to the hotel. You have to pay £3 to use the gym but it's worth it. Not so good. The queues. I know you think 'so what, I'll wait 10 minutes max'. However, the queues were always really large (10-15 people) when I was there. My room was dark with no central light, only lamps around the edge. Also, I had no bath, only a shower. As with most central London hotels it was was pretty small too. Overall, a good price for an OK hotel in a great location (with a superb gym)

<Title>“Greaty hotel”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and after reading other reviews we were not expecting it to be very good so here is our opinion. The room we had was clean and tidy and the bathroom was fine. We did not hear any noise on a night time, but then again we were sensible and took earplugs! . We did not have breakfast in the hotel as we found some really nice cafe's nearby which and we did not fancy the hassle of dining with 600 + guests . Basically If your looking for a cheaper hotel in a great location and a hotel where you are not going to spend a lot of time in your room this is the place to go. The staff are also very helpful. On the eating front there are some good restaurants and pubs near the British museam which is only 5 mins from the hotel. I would definatley go back to the St Giles.

<Title>“Small rooms, But Location, Location, Location.”
<Content>I agree the rooms are very small and not all rooms are the same size. We had 3 rooms and one was twice the size for the same price. This was our first trip to London and did not know if the quality of the room was what we were suppose to expect as we are used to rooms in the US. Given that, the breakfast was included in our room as we booked on line and who can pass up a free breakfast. Different types of food, but it is a different country. The LOCATION was what made us book and it is very close to the subway. If you are going to use the subway (TUBE) alot, this is a great location. Alos beware that a family of 4 has to have 2 rooms as they do not have rooms with 2 doubloe beds, and you pay extra for a double bed verses 2 single beds. (I have never been a shower quite that small......don't drop the soap, because you will have to get out to bend down to pick it up.....!!!!)

<Title>“Wouldn't go back”
<Content>The location of the hotel is excellent and all theatres etc. are within easy reach. The rest of the hotel is basic to poor. The rooms are extremely small (not much like the pictures on the net). They were slightly smelly - the towels were extremely smelly. The bed was vaguely comfortable. The hot water tap in the bathroom did not work at all and any water drained away very slowly. The shower was powerful and quite good. Breakfast was average and the pipes in the drinks machines were dirty so the drinks weren't always fresh. There are vending machines on every even numbered floor but the one on my floor didn't work! The area is generally noisy and the police etc. went screaming passed the hotel day and night. Generally for the price there are much better hotels in London and if it wasn't for the location I wouldn't really have much to say.

<Title>“At this price, people should stop moaning!”
<Content>Stayed at the St. Giles last weekend. Let's be pragmatic: look at the hotel's website; look at the reviews on this website; look at the price. Now, it doesn't claim to be the Dorchester or the Carlton Park Tower, nor does it say that rooms have air conditioning or that they are so many square metres. I really feel that with the St. Giles you pay your money (what - 75-95 GBP per night) and you take what you get. Yes, the lifts are slow. Yes, the breakfast room can be a little crowded - but there is a notice in the foyer that refers to this... Yes, the rooms are small (but see above). Yes, they might be a little warm (but see above). But come on, folks. For this price, what on earth do you expect?! Important factors are cleanliness: you can survive a little heat, but maybe not the embarassment of an attack of the dreaded bedbugs and the attendant red spots. I'd rather stay in a clean room, and the St. Giles provides. Look at the location, my friends. And if you want to be in the centre of things, you'd be pretty naive to think that even double-glazing could drown out all noise. Yes, perhaps the staff may have been a little surly during other members' visits, but in my experience they've always been quite helpful. Yes, I know, subjective...!! In summary, if you want to pay more, then fine. I'd agree that you would expect more from the rooms costing £100+ per night. But for the price and the location, the St. Giles, cannot really be beaten. And no, I don't work for the hotel!

<Content>I booked a quiet and comfortable room. What I got, was a very small and rather old twin room with uncomfortable beds and a noisy ventilation of an air condition a view floors below our window, stopping at midnight. Then you heard late and loud guests on the hallway till after 2:30am. The breakfast Food quality was intermediate, but the options poor and the atmosphere was like in an Youth Hostel. I had better hotels with less stars, and I also had exellent hotels with 4-5 stars in German hotels in Munich and Hamburg for less money. Over all I must say: never ever!

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel on our first trip to London back in 2003. The room was nice and clean but very very small and with no airconditionning. We managed to stay there while there was a heat record in london, the temperature outside was about 100 degrees...the temperature inside our room was even hotter due to the lack of airconditioner and the fact that the window wouldn´t open more than an inch or so, although i don´t think it would have made much of a diffrence if it could have been opend more as it was so hot outside as well. The exterior of the hotel is really awful, it´s just a big gray building, the inside is alot better, the staff is friendly and the service good. The ice machine was broken during our entire stay (4 nights) but you could just bring the ice bucket to the bar and they´d fill it up for you. Breakfast was good, they had most everything you could want from a breakfast buffé. We ate at the hotel restaurant one night and the food was excellent and the service was great. The best thing about this hotel though is the location because you´re quite literally right in the centre of everything, oxford street is just around the corner and there are several tube stations close by to take you anywhere you want to go. I´d defenetly stay here again

<Title>“A gem of a hotel!”
<Content>Just spent 2 nights at the St Giles Hotel in London and it was one of the best hotels i`ve stayed in. It`s situated just off Tottenham Court Road so it`s a fantastic location, restaurants and Oxford Street on the doorstep as well as the Dominion Theatre and Tottenham Court Road tube station. The hotel itself is huge and spotlessly clean. Our room was a triple with a double bed plus a pull down single bed in another walled off area of the room which is handy. We had 2 tv`s, tea/coffee and all the stuff you expect like phone guides etc and other nice touches like a dry cleaning bag provided. The bathroom was also spotless, shower lovely and in there they provided soaps/shower caps etc and even shoe shine wipes. The room was lovely and warm and a pleasure to go back to after a day of shopping and sightseeing. The rest of the hotel is wonderful, the bar is excellent and modern and not very expensive and the breakfast room is huge, always plenty of clean and vacant tables and the food is out of this world! Absolutely the best hotel breakfast i`ve had! They offer so many choices and it`s all cooked to perfection and you can eat as much as you like. All the staff i came across (from bar staff to reception/concierge) were really friendly/helpful. I honestly can not recommend this hotel enough, it`s simply the best!

<Title>“Great location not a bad hotel”
<Content>This is an hotel that I stay in very frequently due its proximity to an office that I regularly work in when visiting London. The location is very good for the West End and various sights, British Museum 5 mins away. On the down side the check in can be slow, the piped music in the lifts is infuriating (in over a years worth of very regular visits I still get the theme from Titanic which I wish would go the same way as the ship) and the single room makes a shoe box appear spacious. On the plus side, for London it is very reasonably priced (shop around), the location as I have said is excellent, breakfasts are pretty unimaginative but filling and tasty and the rooms always well maintained. I suppose that as I have become familiar with the local area I have become much more comfortable with the hotel. If you want a reasonable price and a great location the St. Giles fits the bill perfectly well.

<Title>“Decent budget hotel”
<Content>My girlfriend and I went on a citytrip to london and selected the St Giles because of its location and pricing. St Giles is a decent budget hotel. Don't expect to much luxury. We knew the room was going to be small, and it was, but it was not a problem for us. If it is for you, don't go there. We did not eat in the hotel, so no opinion about that, the same for the pool & fitness which we did not use. We were there to explore london, not to swim. And for exploring London, St Giles is a super starting point. Underground stations are nearby so you can easily get everywhere. Lots of stuff to do within walking distance (picadilly, leicester square, theatre district, ... heck, the hotel is practically on Oxford Street! ). So if you're looking for an affordible hotel that is centrally located to visit London, St Giles is a good choice. If you're looking for luxury, go elsewhere.

<Content>I have just returned from a weekend stay at St Giles hotel. The location was fantastic (we got it through expedia which was the cheapest - £70 per night for a twin room). Its about 2 minute walk to Tottenham Court Road tube station within walking distance of Oxford Street!!! The room was slightly noisy (but only to be expected as it is on a main road), its not too noisy just traffic going past! The room was small and the shower was rather small as well but the price and location more than made up for it and I would definately recommend this hotel if you're looking for low budget central hotel!

<Content>This trip was a special treat for my mum, who celebrated her birthday while we where there, and my auntie, who I took as an xmas present for her. As I am a poor student, I couldn't afford to spend in the range of thousands like some people may, this was the cheapest, and my thought was "we'll be out most of the time, just using the room for sleeping" this was just a 2 night break. The location couldn't have been better! Someone even complained about the noise on one review! Well you can't have both! You can either have a busy location or peace and quiet. I didn't experience any problems with noise! And had 2 peaceful sleeps! On night 1, we went to see the lion king in the lyceum, that was amazing! The breakfast was nice. I have been to london before, but my mum and auntie hadn't, so I knew what to expect, although they had a full cooked breakfast. The staff All brilliant and willing to help! we where right in the middle of everywhere, and couldn't have got a better deal!

<Content>Me and my friend just got back from a week stay at St. Giles. After reading some of the reviews here I have to say I'm quite surprised. This hotel was great! The staff were so friendly and helpful and assisted us with a smile on their faces. Hugo's restaurant was terrific and the staff there was the nicest one I've ever met. If you go there, please say hello to Johnny and Giovanni from Eva and Sonja, the Icelandic girls. The bar was excellent, friendly staff and good drinks. Yes, the rooms were a bit small but clean and the sheets and towels were changed every day. The maids were soooo nice and helpful and offered us coffee in the morning. When we left some of the staff followed us outside to our taxi to say goodbye. We'll definitely be going back next year to meet them again, so lovely. Come on, you guys who are complaining about the noise. This hotel is situated in the center of London, and London is not a small quiet city! Everything is within short walking distance; restaurants, shops (Oxford Street), clubs, cafés, a netcafé and some tourist attractions. I'd reccomend this hotel to everyone who's looking for a nice, cheap hotel. The location is great!! Of course, it's not the Hilton, but I found it lovely all the same. I'm looking forward to going there again.

<Title>“A big fat No for customer service!”
<Content>As a budget hotel in the heart of the West End, this hotel serves as a good location and is handy but for quality of customer service, room, cleanliness and general hospitality then it would be best avoided. LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION... The one saving grace for the St Giles is the location, which all said and done is bang slap in the middle of the West End, with both Charing Cross Road and Tottenham Court Road a brisk 5 minutes walk away. Tucked neatly away on Bedford Court, the hotel does serve its purpose well for tourists on a tight tight budget or for overnight business stays, though I am not sure I would consider this hotel for a romantic weekend with a musical and meal! A taxi ride to Euston Station is about £5 which is good value for money in anyones book. ROOM WITH A VIEW? The worst room I have stayed in in a European city EVER! It is simple as that. London rooms are never large or spacious so my expectations were not high however... Single bed, pokey window that barely shuts out the road noise, a bathroom no bigger than a rabbit hutch (don't even look at the shower tray) all in a prison cell space no more than a broom cupboard. A big disappointment after walking the many miles around the warren of corridors in trying to find the room. Good, power shower doesn't make up for lack of space, comfort or cleanliness though. Saving grace is that there is a hard bed to fall into after a day away from the room! No incentive to stay more than the night hours require. I assure you you will want to get up and out asap in the mornings. FOOD FOR THOUGHT... Breakfast was ample, with a warm buffet choice of full english or continentental if required. Staff were preoccupied and didn't offer anything other than to point me in the direction of a table however. It is a free for all when it comes to food in the mornings and the queue is quite substantial between 8.30 and 9.15 so get in early. The restaurant and bar areas are both very modern with reasonable prices, plenty of seating, good lighting and a nice atmosphere. The evening staff are much more friendly, welcoming and service oriented than the morning staff though. IF I COULD OFFER YOU ONE PIECE OF ADVICE THEN... Only deal with reception when you have to. Very disorganised, not particularly welcoming and not forthcoming if there is an issue with room, rate, booking etc... Not at all customer focussed. Additionally, the lifts - going up no problem, nice and swift. Coming down (you are in a rush to check out with luggage or for breakfast) - forget it - 20 minutes is not unexpected from the 7-8th floor and even then it is tough going (the Titantic tunes don't feel you with confidence!). Take the stairs, sorry, risk the emergency exit stairs which are unmaintained, concrete and more akin to a public NCP car park than a London hotel.

<Title>“St Giles”
<Content>I just returned from the St Giles in London. After reading some of the posts I thought it worthwhile to add my two cents. While the rooms are a bit small compare to American standards, I found them to be very reasonable for Europe. The staff was very helpful, friendly and politely answered all our (ridiculous) questions. The breakfast was American continental buffet including ham/eggs/bacon/cheese. The hotel is in a great location, easy access to the underground and buses. The rooms were clean and reasonable quiet considering we were on the back side of the elevators. The entrance was brightly tiled and provided a warm reception, even though there are a few steps to climb (as one review mentioned) which is very common over there, besides the concierge offered to carry our bags which we politely refused since we could use the exercise! All in all I was very pleased would not hesitate to return to this hotel.

<Title>“Bad, bad, bad”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel oct. 2000. It is sad to see that nothing has changed to the better: "Stay here if you like tiny rooms, rooms with no air conditioning, no ventilation, front desk personnel with attitude, bellmen with attitude, and having to carry your suitcase up and down 6 steps just to get into the lobby. There were only two good things about this hotel... the location and one very helpful concierage-- the only staff member who knew how to smile and be of assistance. I read the other reviews and was ok with no A/C but didn't realize that there is no ventilation and a tiny little window which lets in noise and hardly any air. Even the doorway to get in your hotel room is tiny. Bathroom does not have any type of vent either so it is very claustrophic. I stayed here at the end of September so I figured it wouldn't be too warm without A/C. My mistake because it was cooler to stay outside of the hotel!" This is one of the few hotels I have visited where you had to put your suitcase on the bed to be able to open it - there was simply no other place! This was a business-trip, if I had payed myself I would have been very upset.

I stayed here at the end of September so I figured it wouldn't be too warm without A/C. My mistake because it was cooler to stay outside of the hotel! We would get back at the end of the day and the room was like a sauna. On the 2nd day we realized that our room safe did not work so they said we could place our things in the hotel safe. When we went to retrieve it they said the person who could open the safe was not around, and was told "do we really need it now?" We had to wait a couple of hours to get our things at which time I requested a room with a working safe. After being here for 3 days, suddenly, our key did not work. My friend waited in a long line at the reception to get some help and when he told them it did not work, they just reprogrammed it. No apology for our inconvenience, no reason why it happened. Just another irritating task for them. After spending 4 nights at this hotel I can only guess that the staff must really hate their jobs. I've never seen such hotel staff that doesn't greet you, smile, or show any type of personality. Of course, the exception was that one concierge staff member. I couldn't wait to leave this place. Proceed with caution.

<Title>“Worst customer service - ever!!!”
<Content>Awful, awful, awful. We had to move rooms twice as the triple room we booked didn't actually excist and they tried to put myself and my 2 female friends in the smallest, pokiest room I had ever seen, it had 1 double bed and a single bed which folded out of the wall. There wasn't even room for our bags. It took over an hour to get a different room, which was only marginally bigger than the first and had a single camp bed wedged beteen the double and single bed. The rooms were dirty, hot and smelly. The staff were rude, arrogant and unhelpful. The hotel was filthy, with food on the carpets by the lift which was still there the next day. What more can I say except......do not stay in this hotel!!!!!

<Title>“Not brilliant, but not bad for the money”
<Content>This hotel is not luxurious by any means. The rooms are small (but most rooms in London are), there is no air conditioning, the wing that we stayed in was looking a bit tired and the sound proofing (or lack of!) means that you can often hear other guests arriving back to their rooms late at night. However, it's cheap, very clean and in a great location. The staff were friendly and efficient and towels and sheets were changed every day. In general I would say that it is value for money, but understand that you will get what you pay for. You just have to weigh up what you want from a hotel in London, given that you probably won't spend much time in it. One thing to avoid is the breakfast. The food itself was fine, but at weekends the queue's are ridiculous and when you do eventually get your food, you most likely wil not get a table.

<Title>“Location vs Other Factors”
<Content>I had read all the reviews before staying in this hotel. I have to admit that almost all of them reflect a true picture of what this hotel is like. No air-conditioning(considering it's August!), long queues for everything e.g. check-in, lifts and breakfast. However, considering I was paying 67 pound (incl. breakfast) and I was staying in the middle of london, it's a good deal. Good Side: 1) location (Just beside Dominion Theatre, 2 Mins to nearest Metro) 2) a small but tidy and clean room 3) low-mid range budget Bad Side: All those mentioned before. Overall, even in August, my stay in St. Giles was still satisfactory. I will definitely consider to return again.

<Title>“It is what it is - Clean, Cheap, Close to the Airport”
<Content>We picked the St Giles based on location first, then price, then the reviews. We were pleasantly surprised to find that it is a nice, modern high rise hotel about 15 minutes away from Heathrow. The staff was very nice and got us checked in quickly. My colleague got a handicapped accessible room and raved about its size and ammenities. My room was average, probably on the large size for Europe, but not for a modern hotel. We enjoyed a very palatable dinner at the hotel dining room. In the morning, the cab reservation that I had made the previous evening wasn't there. The staff really ran around frantically for about 15 minutes trying to find me another way to the airport. They were completely freaked out, so I was able to relax. The only downside to the visit was that the cost of an overseas phone call was about 20 times higher in the room and lobby than it had been anywhere else during my visit to the UK. I still don't know why. But it would be advisable to buy a phone card down the street and make your phone calls elsewhere.

<Title>“Hot, Noisy, and Smelly”
<Content>The good: Location, price, breakfast included The Bad: No ventilation, window opened 6 inches with no cross ventilation even with the door propped open. Ask for a fan IF you dare stay here. Since there was no ventilation, the room smelled of the last occupants alcohol and smoking laced sweat. It permeated the carpet, matress, and headboard. Only after 3 days did it abate somewhat after I placed scented soap cakes around. The Ugly: Since there was no A/C and no ventilation, the window had to stay open. This location is known for the street hooligans who party all night in front of Virgin MegaStore, so we asked for a "quiet" room. Our backside 8th floor room was unfortunately over the hotel's Hugo's Rotisserie Bar which was open past 3AM on Friday and Sat night. Most Brits drink in front of the pubs since its too hot inside and it sounded like the party was in our room until almost 4am. Do yourself a BIG favor and DO NOT Stay here under any circumstances. It is the worst hotel in all my world travels including the Barrio in the Phillipines.

<Title>“Unimpressive”
<Content>I visited the St.Giles for just an overnight stay, for which my employer paid £89 for bed & breakfast. On arrival the male receptionist for whom English was clearly not his first language had trouble finding my booking and called over a female supervisor who was very helpful. My booking was on file but neglected to include breakfast as requested. However, when I showed my copy of the corespondence sent to the hotel by my employer the booking was changed. Check-in was very slow, which was surprising as I was being attended to by a senior member of the team. As mentioned by other reviewers the lifts take forever to arrive which seems strange as there are about six of them. My swipe card stubbornly refused to open the door to my room so after 5 minutes of trying I returned to Reception where the supervisor reprogrammed it. Being told there was "no problem with the card" whilst watching her struggling to get it recognised by the card reader was irritating but she was polite throughout and the card finally worked OK when I returned to the room. Frankly my room was the smallest I have ever stayed in and although it was clean enough it had seen better days. The coffee provided comprised two sachets of Nescafe, two of whitener and one small plastic stirrer (no spoon). The shower was great as it comprised a walled-in cubicle and it worked well. The only drawbacks were that it took up one third of the bathroom and the combined on/off & hot/cold control was unmarked and setting it was a bit hit & miss. The restaurant (Hugo's) is in fact a pizzaria, with high prices for unexciting food. To give you some idea of how unimpressed I was, I actually went to the Pizza Hut in Charring Cross Rd for my pizza (which was great!). Breakfast at the St.Giles is 'buffet style' and whilst the surroundings are tatty and the food produced on the conveyor belt principle there is plenty of choice and you can help yourself to whatever content and volume you require. I won't be visiting the St. Giles again as I have spotted better hotels in that area recommended on this site. However, I found the St. Giles staff I met to be helpful and polite, and the location of the hotel is ideal for the High Holborn area.

<Title>“Good location, terrible accomodation”
<Content>The only thing they have going for them is the great location. My wife and I were with a group and when we arrived the hotel was working from an old list, so after some twenty hours of travel we found ourselves without a room temporarily; not necessarily their fault but they were smug about it and seemed to enjoy our predicament. Over the next three days of our stay, a mysterious charge would appear on our bill that we would have to refute daily. The concierges seemed to have better things to do than accomodate guests and their silly questions, the rooms were cramped and hot, little items like replacing a light bulb or clearing a slow drain in the sink were impossible to remedy, the ice machine never worked and the bar staff became surly about filling ice buckets, the vending machines took our money, the list goes on. I will never stay here again. Thank goodness I did not have to use my credit card because the front desk is so incompetent that there is no telling what havoc would have been wreaked on my credit line. I would gladly pay more or accept a less advantageous location.

<Content>I have just returned from one night at the St Giles hotel and have to say i had no problems with it at all, hotel is great, easily in walking distance of euston station as well, location good. We stayed at the St Giles as result of the london bombings changing the date of the Queen + Paul Rodgers gig at hyde park and our hotel being unavailable to accommodate us for the following week. No problems encountered with rooms, staff or anything all clean and well.

<Content>Having read previous terrible reviews, I have to say that it really is not bad at all. The room was on the smallish side but I've been in smaller. The room was clean with all the amenities one would expect. The breakfast was excellent with a wide choice. The location was superb. You have to bear in mind that this hotel has over 600 rooms and is in one of the most central spots of London, so breakfast will be busy and there may be slight noise, but please give it a break - it doesn't say its anything other than a tourist hotel, and is excellent value. I would return.

<Title>“Very conveniently located”
<Content>The St. Giles is located near Oxford Street, Covent Garden and Soho. Very easy to find good restaurants within a walking distance, as well as going to the theaters. The rooms are comfortable and clean and the staff friendly. Some rooms are rather noisy, but then you are right in the center. The only drawback is that it is very big and you may have to wait to find a table for breakfast. The breakfast buffet is very good. There is a fitness and a swimming pool which we did not have the time to use.

<Title>“Budget Hotel - You get what you pay for!”
<Content>On the positive side, location was excellent, only a few steps from the Dominion Theatre and Oxford Street and Tottenham Court tube. Short walk to Leicester Square and all many attractions. Breakfast was reasonable although the breakfast room was very busy and difficult to get a table sometimes. We learned to go earlier rather than later. On the negative side we found the room quite small and hot over the warmer months. Quite noisy overnight with roudy people and rubbish collection. The worst experience was the staff at the gym and pool. I wouldnt say it was the worst place we have stayed, it was adequate given the price.

<Title>“Not so bad - great location”
<Content>After reading reviews on this site regarding St Giles Hotel, I was a little concerned about what kind of hotel I had booked. My daughter, her friend and mother, and myself stayed there over the May day weekend and it wasn't that bad. First impressions were very encouraging. Reception staff were very helpful and polite. We were able to check in, but as our room wasn't ready we could leave our luggage at Conciere, foc, so that we could be luggage free to shop! The lifts were okay, but there was the odd foreigner who pushed their way in front, instead of waiting like the rest of us. The rooms were small, but adequate for our needs - somewhere to freshen up and sleep. There was no hot water in the shower, but a quick phone call to reception, and five minutes later I had hot water!! Nice clean towels and sheets, your own kettle, tea and coffee available in the room. There was a very small window, and because we were on the top floor (floor 12!) there was a lovely breeze to freshen up the room, but no views! Queuing for breakfast was a little annoying. As soon as a table became free some people from the queue would sit at the table, to hold it for their family/group they were with. That meant that those at the front of the queue would have a tray of food, but no where to sit. Why don't people use their brains!! It was just like the Germans putting towels on their sun beds!!!! However, the food was pretty good, and there was lots of it. When we checked out, we were able to leave our luggage at conciere, but this time we paid £1.00 per bag - which was fine considering the convenience of not having to lug suitcases around with us while sight seeing. Overall, great location (5 mins from Tottenham Road tube, Northern line & Oxford Street, central line) and great service. Great location for getting to the theatres around Covent Garden and Charing Cross (Northern line) areas. Staff were very friendly and helpful.

<Title>“Don't even think about it!”
<Content>The St Giles Hotel in London is quite simply the worst hotel at which I have ever stayed. I stayed whilst visiting London on Business. My company had paid for the room in advance but the staff were adamant that they hadn't. In fact the Hotel charged the full cost of the room to my credit card before I left. When I return to work my secretary had to handle the matter and get a refund. On to the room itself - too much noise from the street below (actually sounded like the window was wide open even though it was tightly shut), loads of noise from inside the hotel too - school kids and students running around into the early hours!. I asked for a non smoking room yet when I got into the room it smelt so bad I had to buy an air freshener! They also mix smoking and non smoking rooms on the same floor so even if you are in a non smoking room you will still smell smoke. I stayed five nights and never once had hot water in my room in the evening. On two days my bed wasn't made and on one day I was given towels with holes in them! I think the lift system is a joke, you can wait ages for a lift to arrive. In short, don't book this hotel unless it has the last rooms left in London and even them I'd suggest you think about sleeping on the streets first!

<Title>“Small but adequate”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in March 2005 with my Fiancé. We booked a non-smoking room for the weekend through Superbreak. The hotel is easy to find and was just 50 yards from Tottenham Court Road Station, and around the corner from Oxford Street. CHECK-IN On arrival we were told that they were re-doing all the locks on the doors of the non-smoking rooms, and that we’d have to have a smoking room, but they’d upgrade it to a bigger room. And they also said that if the room was too smoky, we should call for housekeeping and they’d come to freshen up the room. Check-in was very slow, but we had a British girl serve us and she was very polite. Eventually, we headed off to our room on the first floor. And its true what everyone says…..the lifts take FOREVER to come! THE ROOM Well, the room absolutely reeked of smoke, but luckily I’d brought an air freshener with me! If this was an upgrade, I’d like to have seen what the standard sized rooms were like! The window only opened about 2 inches, as the television was stood directly in front of it! The bathroom was the smallest I’d ever seen! The shower cubicle was built into the wall, so the entrance to the shower was only half the cubicle width! Having said that, the shower was one of the better I’ve used – good water pressure and constant temperature. There were 2 glasses and a basket of complimentary soap, shower gel, shoe shine and shower cap. The toilet roll was cheap and horrible, but I’d envisaged this after reading other Trip Advisor reviews and had brought some of my own along. Also a very old looking hairdryer, but again, we brought our own.We had a kettle with 2 sachets of tea / coffee / milk / sugar etc on the dresser that had a mirror, shaving plug and light above it. We had a cup of tea each on arrival, and when we got back from our shopping asked at the reception for some more teabags and milk cartons, which was no problem at all. (You might want to note that there is a Tesco just across the road from the hotel, and we got some biscuits and snacks for the room when we got back late). There was a full-length mirror in the room. There was also a small wardrobe (one door!) with a safe inside. Bring your own hangers though! The television was a good size, and had several satellite + radio channels. There was no air conditioning and the room being so small got very hot. We didn’t risk having the window open at night as we were situated next to a rooftop. I wouldn’t like to stay there in the summer. RESTAURANT / BAR Breakfast was a complete nightmare! There weren’t many tables available, and the queuing system was appalling! If you wanted to get a top-up fruit juice or hot drink, you had to go back to the end of the queue and wait what seemed like an eternity to get to the drinks at the end of the line. The glasses for the fruit juice were more like shot glasses so we filled up a mug instead! There was a fair choice: croissants, bread rolls, slices of ham & cheese, butter, jam, marmalade, cereals + milk, fruit and fried breakfast. The hot drink machine was better than the normal choice and had tea, coffee, latte, hot chocolate and more. The fruit juices were apple, orange and grapefruit. Once you’d got your breakfast, you had to find a table! You either had to share with others, or wait until a table became available but have cold breakfast. We didn’t have any meals other than breakfast here, although we did visit the bar for a cocktail before going out one night. The bar staff were friendly, although I felt the drinks were a little overpriced. CHECK-OUT We wanted to checkout early, around 10am so we could get some final shopping in before going home! As before, the queues were incredibly long and we decided to post our key cards into the ‘express check-out’ box, as we had nothing extra to pay. We then made our way to the concierge to leave our cases while we went out. We were dumbfounded to be given our collection ticket and a charge for the 2 cases at £2.00!!! I’ve never had to pay for that service before, and was quite annoyed. CONCLUSION The location of this hotel was great. Just yards away from Tottenham Court Station and being so close to Oxford Street made it ideal for shopping and bringing bags back to the room. The staff I encountered were all very friendly and polite. If you are only going for a weekend like we did, and don’t plan to spend much time in the room then this is definitely a good place to stay. I’ve stayed in several other London hotels, and this was no better or worse. If you are claustrophobic or plan to spend a fair amount of time in the room though, or it’s during summer I wouldn’t recommend it.

<Title>“Smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in.”
<Content>Just back from a 3 day break in London. We were booked into the St Giles for the 3 days but only stayed 1 day! There were 3 of us (myself, hubbie and daughter aged 8 years). Everything was wrong with this hotel. As others have said the rooms were very, very small. We had a suite which consisted of a double bed and behind a partitioned wall a bed setee. The bed setee was so uncomfortable that my very tired daughter found it hard to sleep in. Also the noise from outside kept us all awake. The main reason we chose this hotel was for the swimming pool but when we asked about opening times etc. we were told it was closed for maintenance! We were not told this when we booked it a few days before travelling. The breakfast was an ordeal. A very long queue, sitting at a dirty table, hard rolls, cold food and a dirty mug. The card to open the bedroom door didn't work properly so it was hit and miss if we got into the room or not. After complaining we were offered another room in a quiter part of the hotel with a proper single bed for our daughter. We managed to find an alternative hotel and checked out of the St. Giles. The new hotel (Grange Holborn was 5 star and cheaper than the Giles!) It was Heaven.

<Title>“Great Location and Good Value For Money”
<Content>Reading previous reviews it seems that folks either love or hate this place. I have just returned from a two night stay and have to say that the hotel represents very good value for money. Yes, the rooms are slightly small but that said, ours was very clean and in excellent condition. Visitors need to remember that this hotel is in a fantastic location (walking distance of Trafalgar Square, Oxford Street, Covent Garden, Leicester Square and many more), and the rate we paid was very reasonable given its location. Everything was in working order and to be honest we had no problems whatsoever. The only initial concern was checking in when we encountered a trainee, but hey, we all have to start somewhere, and he was very friendly and very helpful. I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel again and in recommending it to others.

<Title>“A Crypt With a View”
<Content>As soon as we arrived at the St. Giles, we were informed that all that was available "is a blah blah blah... would you like to upgrade?" We upgraded. First impression: a previous guest must have had a very bad night. The entry door had been worked over by a heavy and sharp implement of destruction. I wondered if "The Shining" had been filmed in my very own hotel room. We had elected to upgrade to a "suite" from god-only-knows-what. The bedroom (the one with the alledged "double" bed) was so small that I could stand on the bed and touch opposing walls with my fingertips. I could (and did) change the TV channel with my feet. Room number 2 of the "suite" would be better described as a crypt, and the single bed a gurney. There was a small table in this room as well as a wooden stool. The hotel was nice enough to leave stationary and a pen on the table. A previous guest had apparently written a heavy-handed note on the stack of stationary, and although the original letter was no longer there, the impression of the despondent writer's last words remained on the remaining leaves. In short, the poor man was NOT a happy camper either. One can only hope that he was granted his final requests. My wife checked the closet for a body but GUESS WHAT! The "closet" wouldn't hold a body, much less our clothing and/or suitcases. The "bathroom"? It was so small that the bathroom door had a cut-out in it so that it could swing inwardly and bypass the sink. I wished that the wall opposite the toilet had similar accommodations for my knees. I have been on small airplanes whose lavatories were luxurious by comparison. Let's put it this way: it would have been easy to mistake the shower curtain for toilet paper. (Okay, maybe not, but the shower curtain was much easier to reach than the toilet paper). The shower? That must have been where that nozzle projected from the wall above the toilet. So much for the bright side. On to the bad news. If you live in the UK and EVER have the urge to visit New Orleans, USA during Mardi Gras, stifle it. You can save a ton of money by staying not in New Orleans' French Quarter but in London's own St. Giles Hotel. Why wait for Mardi Gras? You can do it 24/7/365 at St. Giles! (Whether you like it or not). At night, the street below has it all: freaks, goons, street performers of all sorts and stripe, public debauchery, and NOISE. Virgin Records stages promotions which attracts gaily-clad lads and lasses sporting brand new dermagraphics on various parts of their bodies. And oh, you'll be moved to tears--- literally--- by the morose, mulitply-pierced-dressed-in-mourning Goths. Somebody PLEASE safely store all sharp and pointed objects! The concierges? Well, let's just say that they understand only one thing. I never did determine what that one thing is, but it's probably a word spoken in a language unknown to the live-bearing world. And the pizzeria! Hey, it would have been nice to have had some cheese on my cardboard hubcap. And why did the "bottled" water have a disturbingly sunny look to it? And why wasn't it opened at the table? And why didn't the restaurant have another, UNOPENED bottle of water for us when we asked for one? Breakfast will be an experience of a lifetime (provided, of course, that you survive your overnight stay). When ate at the St. Giles, the fare was interesting. Breakfast came in various shades of yellow, brown, and gray, and it had much of the taste and texture of food. It was a correctional-facility buffet-style breakfast without all the frills like forks, spoons, napkins, and elbow room. The lifts: by the time I arrived from the first floor to the fourth floor, I felt that I had aged considerably. The front desk help: see concierge. All for now. Ta ta!

<Title>“tiny room, great location”
<Content>The room was TINY, a bit shabby, but clean. The bathroom was very clean. Fine for a stay of a night or two - more than that and you'll feel claustrophobic. Breakfast is nice. The location is great. All in all, worth the price.

<Title>“The worst experience, ever!”
<Content>First of all, I would like to say that me and my husband travel a lot thoughout Europe and this means that we have stayed in many many hotels. The experience we had with St. Giles, London was the absolutely worst and let me explain: We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in August 2003, mainly because it was located in walking distance from the Dominion Theatre. We had a reservation for a double room, great deal booked from the hotel's web site. We were assigned a room that was so small even our luggage was hard to fit. You have to see this room to believe it! Apart from its size the room was so noisy all the time it was impossible to stay in. The bathroom was unusable, it was so small that only a child could fit in there and apart from this there was no water! The only complaint we made, since we were on a "great deal" and couldn't argue much about the room size was about having no water and after 20 minutes the problem was fixed but the water that came out of the sinks was colored brown, it was disgusting! The frontdesk was rude, unhelpful and couldn't care less. It was a terrible experience, absolutely terrible.

<Title>“Good location, shame about the room”
<Content>Reasonable prices (for London), great location, walking distance of all the sights. Like a lot of London hotels though the rooms are very small. Lying in my bed my feet were practically touching the television at the end of the bed. Stepping out of the shower I stubbed my toe on the bedside table. It was THAT small. The breakfast was good though, the staff helpful and the gym facilities good too. Everything everyone says about the lifts are true...

<Title>“just go for the location”
<Content>This is not the hotel for the summer months. I was here in August 2004 here and it was harsh during with the summer hear. No air circulation in the room, shower stall had dark stuff in the tile-- I commented this fact to the front desk, but nothing was done. Key card did not work and it took an hour for management to let me into the room. Good thing about this hotel, is that it is close to everything.
