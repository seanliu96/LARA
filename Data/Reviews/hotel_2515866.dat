<Title>“Perfect resort for the whole family”
<Content>This is the perfect place to stay with a family, everything about this complex is fabulous. The children loved the pools & indoor games room. Our 2 bedroom apartment was spacious, comfortable and clean. Transportation to and from the parks was close by. It was safe for the children to go to and from the parks by themselves (they are teenagers). We loved it so much we have booked to come back again this August.

<Title>“The Springs”
<Content>I read that the Springs was close to the buses and main area. When we arrived we were assigned the Paddock. The reservationist checked and we got a room at the Springs 4400 building. From the back stairs the bus stop was just 100 feet away. The only thing about the Springs is that it's the last stop, so we had to go through the whole resort when returning. It goes Grandstand, Carousel, Paddock, Congrss Park, Springs. One attendant said that they are looking into changing the route because the Springs is the busiest stop. Also, the Treehose Villa guests have to transfer at the Springs to go to the parks. We stayed in a studio. Room was nice and clean. We liked the kitchenette. Microwave, fridge, coffee maker. They provided paper plates and bowls; plastic utensils; glasses and mugs. My only complaint was that the fan wouldn't shut off, even when we turned it off. There was a cold spell on our first 4 days, high 60s to low 70s, didn't need the a/c. There were extra pillows and blanket in the closet.

<Title>“Our home from home”
<Content>We are DVC members and Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa is our "home" resort. The rooms are clean and bright and as of spring 2012 are going through a refit (drapes, carpets etc). The main pool has also just been upgraded and is now zero entry. The main reception area is lovely and the overall theming of the resort is great. The resort is on the large side but nothing you can't cope with as the Disney bus service is good or as we do hire a car. Close enough to downtown Disney that you can also walk so if you fancy a drink with your meal you don't have to drive. Hope you find this a useful review let me know

<Title>“Disney's Saratoga Springs - clean family vacation but disappointing for disney”
<Content>We spent the second week of a two week florida vacation here. We spent the first week at the Holiday Inn Orange Lake Resort - reviewed separately - and I think that set me up as I expected disney to be better and it wasn't. It was fine but I really wasn’t very impressed with the place, which was disappointing. This was our first stay at a disney resort and we were really excited so it was a bit of a let down. I think some of our experience was tempered by the fact that the service wasn't very good. They forgot to give us an information pack when we checked in. We were never called or welcomed to the resort or told of any events. In fact, the second to last day, I had to call for more towels (they gave us three for a unit for four people??) - I mentioned this to the front desk person and found out they did have events and we should have been given a packet on check in. So my husband went and got a list, but it was a bit late! So we felt quite disconnected from the place. We were never asked to do a tour of the resort. Which I suppose was nice if you don’t like being harassed, but I quite often like to do that so it was odd not even to be asked once. I think there is a happy medium between being harassed and being at least asked. The decor is pretty, but the rooms seem dated, even though the resort is only five years old. its like they decorated it with grandmas old furniture, which is not a look I would be striving to reproduce. There were also some maintenance issues - a broken lamp in our room, missing remote batteries etc. To sum up: Guests can catch a ferry to downtown disney which is fun, but the last one comes back at 11.30pm which is early if you’re from the west coast and its a pain and slow to take the bus back. We waited for 35 minutes in the pouring rain one evening for the bus. Not fun with tired kiddos. The pool is nice but small for such a big resort and quite crowded The unit was small with a strange bathroom configuration and a tiny kitchen. This would have to be the smallest one bedroom I’ve stayed in The sofa bed was very difficult to put in and out, which made life difficult and was not comfortable. The washer dryer made the most horrendous noises we could not stand to run it while we were there. Perhaps the other disney resorts are nicer?

<Title>“Pleasant All-Around Experience”
<Content>We arrived . . . ["We" being my partner and I -- both in our late 40's and just slightly out of shape :) -- i'm a 15+ Disney tripper and this was his first time!! ] . . . in our rental car directly from the airport at 10:30 am and check-in was quick and painless. Our request for a room in the Congress Park area nearest the walkway to Downtown Disney was honored and we were given the keys to our room already!! I realize that it's not a very busy time for Disney in general, but was pleasantly surprised that our room was available at such an early hour. We were able to unpack and get on our way to Epcot in time for our noon lunch reservation. The buses weren't crowded at any time during our 4 day stay and we never waited more than 15 minutes for a bus. We both thought that walking distances were reasonable to get from room to car/bus/pool. I can see where you would be frustrated with the resort being spread out if you were stuck out in the Paddock area and didn't have a rental car. The Congress Park area is definitely the last bus stop on the route through the resort, so I understand where it would be a problem during peak periods. A few words about our room. We were in a studio which is perfect for two -- I wouldn't want to put another adult in there, that's for sure. There's a queen bed and a small pull-out sofa that would be perfect for a small child. The furniture and bed are comfy and there were plenty of pillows, etc. The room set up is a bit difficult in that the toilet/shower is to the left of the vanity sink area and the closet (with bi-fold door) is directly to the right of the vanity. You have to be careful coming out of the toilet so as not to whack someone standing at the sink with the door! And whatever you do, don't try to get into the closet while someone is brushing their teeth! You'll be taking out their elbow with the bi-fold door! The decor in the room is about as blah as I've ever seen in a Disney resort, but the room is still adequate and comfortable for its purpose. (I've stayed in the Polynesian, Caribbean Beach and Port Orleans within the past 10 years -- this is better because of the little kitchen area with fridge/microwave & sink.) All in all, i'm glad we chose Saratoga Springs. We were well within 10 minutes of all of the parks, either by bus or by rental car. I would definitely stay here again!

<Title>“Great stay again”
<Content>Just spent 4 days at Saratoga Springs and had a great time. First of all this is a large but beautiful resort spread over various buildings. Its easy to get around. Some of the buildings are a long way from the main part of the resort and the walkway to Downtown Disney. We have stayed here before and find that when you check in they automatically allocate you a room as far away as possible. A tip is to check in as early as possible and request a room in the Congress Park area. This is 5 mins from the main pool and reception and 10 mins walk from Downtown Disney. The main pool area is noisy and very busy, great if you have small children but we prefer to sit by the Congress Park pool which is quite big but quiet for most of the day, there are also nice views across the Lake to Downtown Disney. The buses take forever and get really busy but thats the same in every other Disney resort I've been to but at least its a free service! We prefer to walk or use the car if possible! We stayed in a studio which has a double bed and a pull out sofa bed, my only criticism is that we would prefer 2 beds, the pull out sofa looks a mess and is a nuisance if you want to put it back every day. Otherwisw our room was lovely with a small kitchenette which was adequate for our needs, all we want is a large fridge for the drinks!!! We also had a sink, coffee maker, toaster and microwave. As we were on a Disney Vacation Club stay we didnt get housekeeping every day but thats not a problem. Overall we enjoyed our stay, convenient location and a beautiful setting.

<Title>“Treehouse Villas”
<Content>We are Disney Vacation Club owners at Saratoga Springs but wanted to try something different this time, so we booked a treehouse villa. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The Villas are 3 bedrooms, 2 full baths, kitchen, living room and dining area. There is also a full washer and dryer. It was like having our own home at Disney. Very quiet and private. There was no listening to slamming of doors or voices from your neighbors. The Villas are very nicely furnished with 2 bedrooms having queen beds and the third having bunk beds. Every room has a flat panel t.v. and the bathrooms and kitchen have beautiful granite and tile. We were able to walk over to Saratoga Springs very quickly. We even took a boat over to Downtown Disney. We would definitely stay again.

<Title>“Fantastic Pool!”
<Content>Disney does such a great job with everything and they didn't miss it with the pools. This resort has multiple pools and separate areas within the pools for smaller children to play. Saratoga Springs resort has multiple waterslides for toddlers to adults. It was so great to hang out at the pool during the middle of the day and miss the big crowds at the park. We stayed in a two bedroom villa, it was perfect for for 6 people. The only thing that could make this better would be direct monorail access, it's just not fun folding and refolding a stroller to ride on the bus. However, it is so nice to have the buses available and we appreciate being able to park our car and leave the driving up to someone else.

<Title>“Fun vacation”
<Content>This place was pretty great! The beds were super soft and a great nights sleep. We stayed in a 1bedroom villa and was able to fit all 3 kids on the pullout sofa in the liing room. The only problem i found with the pullout bed was that it was a tight squeeze between it and the bar to eat at. The kitchen had all the dishes And utilities we needed. It was a good thing our stay was only 3 days because they give you a 1 load laundry detergent to use. But its nice that they give you the one. Also, there is only cleanup on day 4 of your stay if you stay a week or less from the room attendants. The added bonus of staying here is your key to the world which you can use to pay with at most disney world locations for food, souvenoirs, etc. And you can have the items delivered to your room so that you are not lugging all your treasures around the park. This key doubles as your room key. The kids and myself included LOVED the pools : paddock and the rock pool. Amazing fun and great entertainment from the staff. There are lots of activitwies provided at the pool all afternoon for the kids. There were also several lifegaurds at both pools that never took their eyes off the water. I felt my kids were very safe there. Also, there were free life vest rentals, noodles, sports equipment, etc. It would be hard to get bored at this hotel! Back to the room, the bathtub was huge and was awesome with jets to relax away the many hours of walking around the parks. The only cleanliness issue i saw was we found a used coffee filter in our coffee pot when we hadnt used it yet. Other than that the room was sparkling clean. We were treated like royalty by the staff. We were greeted immediately upon entering and walked right over to check in. They even let us check in an hour earlier (3 instead of 4 pm). Overall this was so much fun and we will be back again next year!

<Title>“Lovely, but large!”
<Content>Our 1-bedroom was very clean and nice so I can't complain about that. It was also nice to have boat transfers to Downtown Disney as well as the bus transportation. However, the resort is spread out quite a bit. The ideal location is the "Springs" area adjacent to check in, the restaurants and gift shop. We were in the Paddock that has it's own grill and larger pool. It's not too bad in terms of convenience in that it's directly across a "lake" from the springs area so it's a shorter walk (you can also take the bus) than one might have if you had to walk around the lake instead of over it on a bridge. It is peaceful and pretty. We did not like Artists Palette, the fast food option. The flatbread pizza is awful. We only really had breakfast there and got pastries so can't comment on breakfast foods. The layout and check out seem a little awkward to me . . . just the way it's set up. We also ate at the Turf Club Grill, a very nice sit down restaurant. I had prime rib which was very good and the atmosphere is quiet and relaxed. I think it's pretty easy to get ressies there too since it's kind of off the beaten path. Service was hit or miss at the front desk. We had difficulty with charging back to our room immediately after we checked in and went to the parks. The first person to try and sort this out was less than helpful. The next person who tried was very accommodating and even though I had to ask, we did get some compensation for the inconvenience. It is a very nice resort, but having stayed at many other Disney Vacation Club properties, we wouldn't put this at the top of our list simply because it is so spread out and because it seems far from everything except Downtown Disney.

<Title>“Spring break at Saratoga Springs”
<Content>My 13 yo son asked if we could go to WDW for spring break. This was a last minute trip and the only DVC resort available was Saratoga springs. We stayed in a studio in the Congress park section, which is the closest to downtown Disney, just a 5-10 min walk to the marketplace. We were close to a quiet pool itch laundry facilities, but not close to food, bar, or beverage refills. Being close to DD was a plus, because I could let my son explore Disney quest on his own, or just do some quick shopping. Even though it was spring break, the parks didn't seem much more crowded than in the summer, they just got busier a little later. What surprised me was that even though the pool area was bustling, and the weather sunny and warm, I was always able to find a lounge at e main pool. There are lots of activities offered for kids in the community hall to DVC and non DVC members, sometimes for a small materials fee. There was also lots of fu. Poolside activities run by staff in the afternoon. They had a full activities schedule for Easter Sunday: a candy hunt, egg painting, ceramics, foam crafts, games, etc. all complementary. My son wasn't interested because he's in that cool stage, but I had a blast making crafts and decorating an egg :). He was pleased with the arcade on property, but was more impressed with Disney Quest, which had Free video gaming on their games (included in admission) and they were good games, not crappy ones. I don't care for the WDW bus system in general, because I feel I spend too much time waiting around for busses, especially if your want to go to multiple parks. But on this trip, the bus waits were very reasonable. This resort isn't close to much except Downtown Disney & golf, so it's nice if you have a rental car, but not necessary. We did the dining plan, which is convenient, but only a good deal if you like and order dessert a lot, or do the buffets or character breakfasts. Food at the resort was okay, but limited in variety, although it is close to DD dining. Our studio had a queen bed, sofa pullout, which had a gymnastic type mattress that my son wasn't fond of (he liked the mattress in the Beach Club Villas couch better). We had a mini fridge, full size coffee maker, full size toaster, microwave, and paper plates, bowl, & plastic utensils, plus 4 glasses, 4 coffee mugs, can opener & corkscrew. This was great for our leftovers. Other than that, it was like most hotel rooms. Our balcony door was hard to open, and I actually pulled off the handle! Maintenance quickly fixed that. Also, although I set the A/C at 65, it wouldn't go beyond 74. It turns out they have motion detectors set up for the ac and it goes off if you aren't in the room, but it isn't practical at night, since you aren't moving around, and that's when I get hot. A quick call to housekeeping fixed that and she told me how to override the ac computer. The space was perfect for the two of us, but I think it would be crowded with 4 adults. We also had a DVD and VCR player, with films available for rent at the community hall. A note about the treehouse villas (I stayed in one last year). They are great! Especially for families with mixed age/sex children because there are 3 bedrooms (one with bunkbeds). It's like a fabulous vacation home BUT they are way out there, and I would not stay in one again without a rental car, because you have to take a bus from the tree houses to Saratoga, and then switch for the resorts. A real pain and time waster. A quick note on the main pool: it has a fun water slide, a small toddler water slide, a disabilities lift, a zero entry area, 2 spa jacuzzis, and a splash area. Lots of loungers, and a bar with minimal food service, but the main food is just across the path. They also did a nightly movie at the pool on a giant screen. Saratoga springs also has a very nice spa, which I didn't go to this visit, but I have been before, and it is a full service spa similar to other high quality day spas. I recall the fitness room being better than most Disney resorts, as well, but I got enough fitness at the parks! Also a golf course is close if your husband is into that. Room service: only pizza delivery, but reasonably priced. Note: I've been a DVC vacation member for 12 years, and am an avid Disney fan, but I tried to keep this review focused on the resort itself, not on the vacation club.

<Title>“Way too big!”
<Content>Spent a week here. Came in late and spent 30 minutes trying to find my room. We ended up on the other side of the complex very far away from any of the bus stops or lobby. By the time the bu got to us it was filled with only tending room. We have never had this problem at any of he other resorts we have stayed on. We are Disney Vacation Club members and will never choose this resort again.

<Title>“A bit spread out, but convenient to Downtown Disney”
<Content>We recently had a multi-generation family trip to Disney which included my sister, her husband, her three kids (ages 2, 4, & 7), my parents, and me. We opted to stay at the Saratoga Springs resort for convenience and ability for the entire family to share one room/suite. The room itself did not disappoint in size. For 8 people it was definitely on the smaller size, but had everything we needed for the 5 nights that we stayed there. Master bedroom, two double beds in the other room, pull-out bed, and two bathrooms made it possible. There was also a full kitchen (complete with small kitchen appliances, flatware, etc.) and wash/dryer. We were pleasantly surprised to find clean sponges, dishwashing detergent, paper towels, and laundry detergent supplied for us in the room. Being a Disney resort meant that we could easily use dining plan points and arrange other Disney services. Since our trip was partly in celebration of a birthday, we were able to order and have a cake delivered directly to our room. We stayed in the Congress Park part of the resort, which was convenient to walk to Downtown Disney and had a shuttle stop close by. Otherwise the resort is very spread out and we got lost our first day there. We dined at other Disney resorts, which I highly recommend, but keep in mind that it's a solid 20 minute shuttle from Downtown Disney to other ends of the property, such as the Animal Kingdom. My parents were also able to arrange golf tee times and enjoy non-park aspects of Disney during he day. All in all we had a very good experience at this resort. Apart from it being so spread out, the only major complaint I had was about the air conditioner. It would turn on and off with a life of its own, even with the thermostat turned off. Our rooms were kept way too cold for comfort. We did not take advantage of the resort airport check-in, but bell-services and other requests were handled top notch.

<Title>“Will be back”
<Content>Our trip to Disney world was wonderful. We stayed in the Congress Park area of the hotel. It was a short walking distance to Downtown Disney. We had a one bedroom suite with a full kitchen, sofa sleeper and king size bed. Everything was clean and nice and we had a beautiful view of downtown Disney which is amazing at night. The washer/dryer unit came in handy numerous times and helped us lighten our packing. We never had to wait more than 15-20 min for a Trolley - some seem to come faster than others. Magic Kingdom one was the slowest. We will be visiting again in 2013 and plan on returning to this hotel. The staff was great as well. It was a great value and nice say.

<Title>“Family Vacation”
<Content>I recently traveled to Disney with my husband's family, there were five adults that stayed in a 2 bedroom villa. There was plenty of room, very clean and just enough privacy when you needed it. We chose this hotel to be close to downtown since we are all adults we wanted to not only to have kid fun but also adult fun. The grounds are massive and it's easy to get lost if you are not paying attention. There were lots of fun pools to enjoy and a great restaurant in the main building. We were in a building close to the main building and that worked out great when we needed to make a quick run to pick up something from the market. The buses were timely as always and the staff was very helpful and courteous.

<Title>“Great Spring Break”
<Content>We stayed here for Spring Break and it was great! It was a girls trip and we had 3 teenage girls and my best friend. We stayed for one week and we never had any problems. The transportation was great to all of the parks. We had breakfast every day at the resort and they were all pretty good. The pool is great! We had a 2 bedroom and it was very spacious so that everyone had their privacy. Even the teens thought that it was great. We stayed in the building closest to the main building which I would recommend if you don't have a car because the resort is very large. The building we stayed in was close to the pool, restaurants and spa so we walked every where. We did walk to Downtown Disney which was quite a distance from our building but it was a nice walk. Would definitely recommend this resort!

<Title>“first Disney Trip for 2 famalies of 4”
<Content>we had the most amazing holiday, got this resort at half price with deal on park tickets and dining menu thrown in. This proved to be a great resort had read some ropey reviews about cleanliness and run down......... saw none of it both famalies shared a2 bedroom apartment 4 kids slept in 2 double beds.. another couple in main bedroom only downside was they don't do 3 bedroom apartment so very large sofa bed but was in lounge area. Dining plan saved us a fortune as food not cheap on disney but we had great choice and traded meals in for signature dining and character dining.... resort was huge and immaculate rooms great size very very clean, staff all very friendly..... everything was worth every penny.. the look on kids faces is quite literally priceless...defo going back in 2 years... We have 4 girls and the Princess Breakfast at Epcot was the best thing and worth trading in 2 meals on dining plan each and every Princess came to our table and our girls were literally speechless and just wowed even the 16 year old was in tears...Best holiday ever

<Title>“Great Family Villas - Disney needs to be careful with turning rooms to fast (wet carpets on check-in are gross)”
<Content>As always, the Saratoga Springs did not disappoint. The property is kept up perfectly, the rooms are spacious, and all of the activities at the resort make you almost forget about the parks. We have stayed here several times. This visit we stayed in a 2 bedroom villa. We had a very nice room close to the main building and pool. The master bedroom had a king bed and the second bedroom had 2 queen beds. We had a balcony and a view of a lake with a fountain. The colors of the room are very relaxing, and it is very nice to have your own kitchen, and a washer and dryer. Our kids loved the pools with water slides and enjoyed the various activities at the kids camp. They did everything from making pins, to pillows, to painting a bank. The directors at the kids camp are very nice and fun to be around. We took some bike rides and enjoyed looking for turtles in the lakes. The resort is very convenient to Downtown Disney and all of the places to eat and shop. We had one minor problem. The person who had been in the room before us must have been total pigs, and they smoked. As a result, when we were let into the room the carpets were wet from shampooing. The closet in the bedroom smelled like smoke. The remote for the bedroom TV was broken and the lamp in the living room was broken. We had to ask for fans to dry the carpet. It was a case of Disney turning the room too quickly (the previous guest should have been charged a cleaning fee and the room should have been properly cleaned and checked before renting it again). I am still glad we had the room, but Disney needs to be careful with turning rooms too quickly if there is damage. Other than that we loved our stay.

<Title>“Great Disney Resort with 4 kids! I have included transport & how to use Disney app tips, too”
<Content>Okay, in my long review I have included info on this resort, on taking the buses to get to the parks, info on using the app to save time with lines and find meals, a description of our villa and proximity to pool, and some other info. Sorry it is long, but now you know what you are getting in this review! We planned our Spring Break trip to Disney about 2 weeks before Spring Break as we had to wait on our son's High School sports schedule, but were able to get a great package directly through Disney and this resort was just perfect for us! It was like being in a great condo, well-located with great proximity to transportation (the buses to the parks), a pool, restaurants, etc. It was quiet, spacious, and a lovely setting! And for those not wanting constant Disney stuff everywhere, it was a nice break, in that it had great Disney service, but no characters running around, more of a condo setting. When our kids were really little and we were still in strollers, it was worth paying more to be just one or two stops away on the Monorail, but with 4 teens between 13-18, this was a much better choice for us this trip! We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa (with a pull-out couch in the living room area, so could potentially have slept 8, though we were a family of 6), and asked to be in a building near the main pool, as we had heard that there could be a lot of walking if you were further away. This advice was perfect - we were a 1-2 min. walk from our villa to the bus stop and never waited more than 5-10 min for a bus to whichever of the Disney Parks we were going to each day. And BTW, the buses drop you CLOSER to the front entrances of the parks than the monorail does! We never encountered a bus that was too full and had to wait - and they were great with people in motorized scooters and with strollers - the buses were wonderful! The rides to some of the parks and back could take 17-20 min, so make sure to leave enough time, but they are air conditioned and relaxing rides. In addition, if you had a car, it was easy to park right in front of the building you were staying in. But head's up, if you drive to the parks, you will have to pay to park and then still take a tram or other method to get to the front gate. Also, if you take a cab to the Magic Kingdom, they have to drop you at the transportation center and then you have to take the Monorail to the entrance, so...leave some time and take the bus! Our 2 bedroom villa had 2 great bedrooms - one with 2 double beds and it's own full bathroom, the other with a King bed and it's own full bathroom, too, and there were shutters that opened from the bathtub into the bedroom area, so it felt spacious and was easy to move and talk, etc. The living area wasn't huge, but it had a great fold-out couch and kitchen, eating area and there was a stackable washer/dryer. We had daily maid service and she did the dishes and ran the dishwasher for us! So nice! We packed cereal and snacks and picked up some more at the resort so we just ate breakfast in our villa each morning and headed out early to the parks. I recommend doing the Disney meal plan - everyone says you save money and you get a free refillable mug that you can use at this resort so when you are by the pool, you can drink free pop all day. The main pool was nice - no problem getting chairs, even when busy, you could find some and move them around - lots of towels (hate when they run out!) - the main pool is kind of loud with lots of organized games and music, but you can put on headphones and ignore it if you don't like that - if you have small kids, there is a ton of fun stuff to do. It is not a huge pool and it is not fancy, but it was fine and relaxing after being at the parks. So, why this over a condo that might cost less and not be a part of the Disney Resorts? Well, here is the best part, since this property is a Disney Resort, you are entitled to take part in all of the perks that go with that - early entries to the parks and late hours. We had thought with teens we might use the late hours more (midnight until 3 am sometimes), but we actually found it was better to get up early and go to the early entry hours and get a fast pass first thing for a busy ride like space mountain and then actually get in the low line for it and go on it and do some other rides and then return for a second ride on that ride. By about 10:30am the parks get crowded and you will have done all the hard to get rides with little to no waits and then you can relax and enjoy, eat an early lunch, head back to the resort and relax at the pool for the afternoon (like 12:30 or 1pm-4pm) and then go to another resort for the late afternoon, dinner and evening. We found the early hours to be the best and during the hot seasons, it was cooler, too. I recommend getting the park hopper passes and doing early hours and then going to more than one park in a day, also, best tip I can give: DOWNLOAD THE DISNEY APP - THERE IS A FREE ONE CALLED MOBILE MAGIC WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD, BUT THE BEST ONE IS THE ONE THAT COSTS MAYBE $4.99? OR LESS AND IT IS DISNEY WORLD MAGIC GUIDE!!! This is not an add for that app, it is just a tip from parents of 4 kids who found that app made our trip go SO much smoother. We saw the app advertised on the video and thought we would check it out - and it really helped us to plan our time and make things go smoothly - AND, it got the kids to quit whining "when are we going to .....ride?!" You could look the wait time up and tell them "not until the line goes down" - saved us a ton of time going back and forth to check the times at the lines. The app has all the wait times for the rides, so you can track them and decide when to go over to the ones you want to do - also, it has great maps and features where you can type in "where is the closest hamburger place" and it will tell you "150 yards to your left" - very helpful! It also has all the menus for the restaurants at the parks and tells you if they take the Disney meal plan (which like 99.9% do!) - they make this app for Disneyland, too, FYI.

<Title>“Great Family Fun @ Saratoga Springs”
<Content>We recently spent 7 nights at Disney's Saratoga Springs and loved every minute of it. I never stayed at this resort before (my wife has in the past) and we are definitely going back. We go to Disney every year and always try a different resort but this one is my favorite (so far). When we checked in, our room was far away from the pool and we requested to have our room moved. No problem. We were within walking distance of 2 pools and steps away from the bus stop. Our room was a 1 bedroom and found it to be immaculate upon checking in. During our stay we ate at The Artist's Pallette and The Turf Club. Both eateries were extremely clean and the staff was responsive to everything we asked for. Will definitely stay at this resort when we return :)

<Title>“Fantastic Stay!!”
<Content>We spent a week at Disney's Saratoga Springs in March 2012. We joined the Disney Vacation Club in 2011 so this was our first stay with the points and we couldn't be happier! We stayed in a one bedroom villa with 2 adults and 2 kids (8 and 14). We asked to stay in Congress Park (3 weeks before arrival) and that's what we got - fourth floor. Easy walking to Downtown Disney which we loved. Close access to the buses. Things I was concerned about before we left: would the villa be "run down" (heard they are due for refurbishment); would the buses be so crowded we couldn't get on as it was spring break; would we have to wait a long time for buses; would we have to wait a long time for the Magical Express (complimentary bus from airport to resort - we almost rented a car over concern with the bus transportation); would the place be overrun with kids; would the resort be so big we had trouble getting to pools/main entrance area/restaurants???? None of our concerns were realized and we will do exactly the same next time. The villa had not yet been updated but it was perfectly fine - no stains or scratches. Loved the washer/dryer and the shower and jetted tub. We had garden Grocer drop off groceries that were at the bell stand (refrigerated) when we got there and taken to our room with our luggage by the bell service. Awesome! Villa was roomy - balcony was spacious and it was quiet, quiet, quiet. The buses came about every 10 minutes (actually every 3-5 minutes as there were various buses going to different parks but we never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get the bus we wanted). Buses were never overcrowded - one time a few people had to stand but usually it was less than half full. I think they had extra buses due to it being spring break. Magical Express was fantastic - we did not have to wait at all for it at the airport - in fact they had to wait for us as one of us decided to use the bathroom after we got in line. Smooth, easy ride straight to resort. Would not have been faster in a car - plus we'd have to know our way around, buy gas, pay park entrance fees and hike to the parking lot instead of taking the bus right at the park entrance. Everyone we met was SUPER friendly - true Disney spirit!! Pools were clean with tons of towels, beds and chairs available. The resort itself is beautiful. it is spread out but seriously it was only a 5-10 minute walk from our villa (at edge of Congress Park near the Downtown Disney walking path) to the main entrance/main pool and to the Paddock Pool. We are very glad we joined DVC - it has great value and we look forward to spending many trips to come with our family. Also loved the Disney Parks - did Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom and both water parks. We prefer Typhoon Lagoon over Blizzard Beach - it is more tranquil and BB has a harder stone look and it all seems hidden behind the hardscape. BB probably better for the teen crowd although the TL wave pool is a monster and the waves are really too big and scrape people across the rough floor. We saw a horrible nosebleed on a teenager coming out of the wave pool who either got swept and dragged on the ground or into another person. Also saw lots of little kids with nasty abrasions and in tears - I'm surprised Disney doesn't tone that thing down. Bottom line - Saratoga Springs is fantastic and we'll be back!

<Title>“Excellent Resort but a little far from the parks”
<Content>We used a timeshare exchange to get into a two bedroom unit # 3110 on the ground floor in The Springs section of the resort. So for us the value was very good, but I believe the going rate for our unite was around $600 a night and I wouldn't pay that. I would recommend either staying in the Springs if you want to be close to the main lobby, pool, and food options. If you want closer access to Downtown Disney request the Congress Park section. We never had a problem getting a bus even though it was the last stop at the resort. Our room itself was very clean and well kept with no real wear and tear on the furnishings. We had excellent service and check-in and with the conceirge for ticket purchases. The living area was a bit tight, but we managed with bar stools and the kitchen table. We only used it to gather breifly in the monring and at night anyway and spent the majority of our time in the parks. Our room had real plates and silverware so we didn't have to request it. We did utilize the dining plan, which made the kitchen a little pointless, but it was easy enough to figure out. The food options at the resort itself was a little limited but I know that is because most people actually use their kitchens and don't operate on the dining plan. We only ate on the premises 3 times over the course of the week so it wasn't a big deal to us. Overall it was a great resort, but in my opinion needs to feel a little more like Mickey and a little less like a resort. It is a longer bus ride to the parks and for those two reasons alone we would try another place next time.

<Title>“Loved every minute!!”
<Content>We love Disney hotels, they always deliver! Saratoga springs appealed to us for 2 reasons, the dining plan where you get a refillable mug for in resort, 1 snack per day...such as bagels, cupcakes, muffins, ice creams, popcorn, drinks hot/cold. 1 counter service.. At the quick service establishments in the parks or in resort.. You receive a main meal like burger, pizza, salad, chicken nuggets etc, a dessert such as cheesecake, carrot cake, or chocolate cake and a hot or cold drink. In the evening or lunch whichever way you decide to have your table service meal I advise reserving beforehand, you choose a main meal from the menu a dessert and any soft drink. Also we redeemed our table service as character dining meals which were brilliant, the cinderellas royal table did count as 2 per person though. The other pull to Saratoga springs was the proximity to downtown Disney where we ate mostly for our evening meals, it's close enough to walk, or there is a boat which runs back and forth. Restaurants to recommend would be Raglan Road and T-Rex!! The kids love it in these places. We stayed in Congress Park, Our room was very bright and clean, it had a double bed and a double sofa bed, a balcony with a view of downtown Disney and a kitchenette with fridge, small freezer area, microwave, toaster, sink and paper plates and plastic cutlery. The bathroom was clean and towels were changed regular. The pools were fabulous, we tried The springs, which had the Donald squirters, a slide, night time movies and a hot tub, this was closest to the food court. The Paddock pool seemed to be a favourite with our 5 year old daughter, it had an enclosed water playground, suitable for children up to about 8 years old, a big slide in the main pool which my daughter surprisingly loved, the entertainment staff provide life jackets and do fun games and quizzes in the afternoon, the snack bar is really nice at the paddock pool too! Turf Bar and Grill is a really lovely restaurant I can't praise it enough!! On arrival my daughter was given little toy horses to keep, which she adored and colouring crayons and pictures. The children's menu was good, even though the theme throughout the holiday seemed to be pizza for her! With her dessert it was ice cream with sprinkles and extras in a platter dish to create herself! The adults especially loved the steak with the blue cheese fondue and the lamb was out of this world delicious! Disney does it again another great hotel, I would highly recommend

<Title>“Treehouse Villas Great for Family”
<Content>Our family of 10 just returned last Friday from Disney World and stayed in a 3-bedroom villa Treehouse. It was a wonderful vacation. Breakfast on the deck up among the trees was delightful. The boat ride to the main bus stop was a nice way to begin our day. We even had "a little bluebird at our window" (actually he kept crashing into the window every morning to wake us up so we didn't sleep our day away). The bus ride to the parks was a little long, but the beauty of the forest overrode the inconvenience. The master bath is great. Service was great, too. Would definitely like to go back someday!

<Title>“Best place to stay if you are Downtown Disney bound”
<Content>The resort is situated directly across a lake from Downtown Disney and offers many outstanding ammenities. But it is spread out so far you could have to walk long distances and or use buses to the main building where the large theme pool and restaurants are located. Also, the rooms are the smallest of all Disney properties and the property is situated further from the theme parks than any other Disney properties.

<Title>“Just like home, but even better!”
<Content>Loved our 5 night vacation at Saratoga Springs. We stayed in a 1 bedroom in the Paddock for 3 nights and a 2 bedroom in the Paddock for 2 nights. Our family of 5 (a 12 yr old, 6 yr old, & 18 month old) fit comfortably in both the 2 bdrm & 1bdrm. Kitchen fully stocked & washer/dryer nice touches! We loved the Paddock pool which was right beside our room. Great slides & a walk-in pool (wonderful for the little one). The Paddock has a grille with a simple menu (including breakfast items) beside the pool. Very convenient considering the main restaurants are a (beautiful/scenic) 10 min walk away. This is a problem when it's coming a downpour & you need to eat at the main dining area. We did the parks most days, but the resort was quiet & relaxing while we were on the property. This resort is not decorated in bright colors or cartoon characters, you have to hunt for the Disney touches. My children did not miss the cartoonish atmosphere in the least, because it was so comfortable and beautiful! The staff goes out of the way to make you feel at home. The restaurant on property has delicious food & only takes one table service from your Disney Dining Plan.

<Title>“Magical family vacation!!”
<Content>We visited in the summer of 2011 and stayed in one of the 2 br villas. I visited with my 5 month old son, parents, brother and sister-in-law (husband was deployed at the time). We have started a tradition of going every year with whoever can make it. We absolutely loved this resort! The room was huge! We had plenty of room for everyone, all of the baby stuff, and didn't feel cramped at all. We loved having the full kitchen! We made a few meals in room, but mostly enjoyed the Disney dining! The washer and dryer in room were also a huge help with a large group and one being an infant. The parks are a short ride. We rented a car on this trip, but have used Disney transportation in the past. I will rent a car until my children are older, it is much more convenient for us. If you are using Disney transport make sure to leave plenty of time if you have reservations! My mom treated my sister-in-law and myself to a spa treatment. It was okay. Not the nicest spa I've been to, but the therapist was great and very friendly! We enjoy staying at a different resort each visit. I have stayed at Old Key West, Animal Kingdom Lodge, Saratoga Springs, and will be staying at Port Orleans French Quarter next month. I have also stayed off-site, which I do not recommend. So far, Saratiga Springs is my favorite Disney resort!

We are DVC members and have stayed here numerous times and the one issue with staying so far away from the main building was to get breakfast or lunch it was a bit of a hike....not any more! The new pool area has a full menu that includes breakfast, a great splash area for my little one and beverages for the big kids too!! Great slide, zero entry walk in and plenty os seating. Great job Disney.

<Title>“DISNEY DOES IT AGAIN !”
<Content>Just returned from a 8 day vacation at Disney Saratoga Springs. We go to relax...yes I said relax! We do not do the parks, just sit by the pool and go to different Disney hotels to people watch and eat at their restaurants. Everything you would like to do is at your fingertips. Jog, walking paths,golf, tennis,healthy meals and top gourmet cuisine. Fast food portions are large enough to split and the meal plans are way too much food. Entertainment abounds. Saratoga Springs is a large complex , but your wish is the staffs command. Every time we visit Disney it is always a good time,and everything is perfect. Yet when we return there is always an improvement in whatever service they had provided. The best bang for your buck is the Port Orleans/riverside hotel or the Boardwalk area. Every hotel offers a certain perk by its location. So whatever is important to you so you enjoy your vacation is available to you.

<Title>“Disney greatness, but leave your computer and phone at home”
<Content>My wife and 3 kids just spent 9 days at the Walt Disney World. For the first time in our more than a dozen trips there, we stayed at the Saratoga Springs Resort. We opted for the two bedroom villa. The arrival, checkin, and welcome by the staff was - of course - magical. True Disney goodness, with us smiling from Mickey Ear to Mickey Ear. The villa was very spacious, with a master bedroom/bathroom combo, a living room, full size kitchen, and a second bedroom with two queen beds and its own bathroom. The furnishings were comfortable and clean, the kitchen and bathrooms were fully equipped and stocked, and immaculately clean. So, from a comfort level, absolutely perfect. A walk through the property (gigantic!) will make you wonder if you are really at a Disney resort. There are almost no indications of that being in the land of the Mouse. Aside from the other tourists wearing their Disney gear, and the occasional employee handing out stickers to the kids, you will not find characters around, nor the topiaries, signage, etc. It's a lot more "middle-aged" then a super fun hotel for the kids. The food options are very, very slim. There is a counter service restaurant, with a limited menu, and a "bar and grille" option with an equally simple menu. I strongly advise that you eat your meals prior to returning to the hotel. My biggest issue was with the internet and cell phone connectivity. None. Not a lick of AT&T coverage in the room, and barely one bar on the other parts of the property. The free wi-fi offered was a joke. Might as well not offer it. I couldn't hold it connected for more than 3 minutes and it was painfully slow. That was on the laptop... I called the help desk and the representative explained that the wi-fi is new to them and they are still figuring it out. He also mentioned that smart phones, iPads, etc will have a very hard time connecting to their wi-fi "because of the way our buildings are built". Whatever that means. Unfortunately, some of us cannot be completely offline while in Disney World. So that was a very big problem. Bottom line: for a very comfortable setup, close to Downtown Disney, a big kitchen, that's the place to go! Beautiful property. If you like the food courts like in some other Disney resorts, this one may not be for you. And if you need a certain level of connectivity to the outside world, you should seriously consider another option.

<Title>“Not a quiet place to stay”
<Content>We booked our vacation hoping to have the experience of relaxation with peace and quiet in the mornings and evenings as the parks can be very hectic and rest is always needed when little ones are involved. What we found at Saratoga Springs is 8 am metal carts rattling back and forth past our room dropping off towel baskets for each room, then rolling over head on the above floors back and forth. What was very strange was the all night water running over head in an upper room which sounded like someone dropping a glass of water into a bath tub every few seconds. This is our first poor experience at disney, but certainly has postponed our thoughts of a vacation club membership as well any future Saratoga Springs stays in the future for sure.

<Title>“Another great time at Disney”
<Content>This was my fifth trip to Walk Disney World, however this was the first time we stayed at a Disney resort. It was a great experience and we will continue to stay a Disney resorts in the future. We had a great time and this fairly quiet resort was a nice change from the constant hustle and bustle of the parks. Our only complaint was we had a bad dinning experience at The Turf Club Bar and Grill. The service was very slow, we had a reservation at 6:55pm and did not receive out meals until after 8pm! The food once it was finally served was hit and miss, some was great and some was very poor. The bus service to the parks was quick and simple, and even though it is a big resort we did not feel like we ever had to walk that far to get where we were going. I would not hesitate to stay at Saratoga again, but it will also be fun to visit and experience other Disney resorts in future years.

<Content>This was our first trip to disney and our first to Saratoga Springs. The Resort is very beautiful and very large, but making you feel right at home. We did have a tough time choosing what area to stay in upon arrival and ended up at Congress Park-which is closest to downtown Disney.....well with two little ones the walk was MUCH longer than we were expecting, so since you are able to take a bus or boat I would not stay in Congress Park again. I would probably stay at The Paddock because that is where the pool is and it is closer to the main lobby, which is also closest to the Artist Palette, which you have to go to get mug refills and any small thing you need for the room. From where we stayed it was quite a trek. We had a one bedroom villa(my mother went with us) and she slept on the queen sleeper in the living room and it was very comfortable. My husband and I had a huge King size bed. When we booked our room I was under the impression we would have a crib, like your child has at home, but that is NOT what it is. It is a dingy pack and play....so my 10month old slept with us. The room was very clean and came with everything you need for a kitchen. Very spacious shower and jacuzzi tub. Every time I called down for something it was delivered in a timely manner-linens and on the second day our coffee pot stopped working and we were sent a new one in a matter of 30min. Everyday when we returned from the parks our beds were neatly made and the dishes were washed. I would definitely visit SS again.

<Title>“Good Choice”
<Content>Recently stayed at the Disney Saratoga Springs Resort. Certainly up to the Disney standards we all expect. Had a one bedroom villa which included kitchen, living area, bath, and bedroom with king bed. The resort was clean inside and out. Cast members were friendly and helpful. Location across the lake from Downtown Disney with complimentary boat shuttle was very much appreciated as was the bus transportation to the parks. The resort is very big, and I will stress VERY. Obviously met the needs of the architects and engineers but could be more user friendly. The Carriage House (front desk registration, etc.) could have been placed more centrally located. Our room was close to the front gate so we had plenty of exercise walking up to the main hub of the resort. One of the bus pickup locations was very convenient to our room, but did not appear to be this way for everyone. This is not a resort for those who do not want to walk or can not walk. It is possible to take a bus around the resort if you want to wait but we chose to walk. I was also disappointed with the lack of a lounge (bar) area for an adult beverage. Next to the restaurant there was a "hole in the wall" where you could order a drink with a seating area with sofa's, chairs, pool table, but no bar like atmoshphere. Pool bar did serve adult beverages but not really where I would choose to sit. All in all this is an excellent resort and I would not hesitate to stay again if I were to choose to visit Disney again.

<Title>“Stay anyway else!”
<Content>Stayed at Saratoga Springs 1 bedroom villa from Mar 6 to Mar 13. We arrived late and used the Magical Express. Upon checking in, we were assigned to a room that was over 2 city blocks from the lobby. With no offers of help in getting to our room, we roamed around in the dark carrying luggage until we found our room. The room was lay out is weird with multiple doors and lots of wasted space. Their was a dirty sock in the floor next to the bed that was left by the previous occupants. Our sheets were not changed the during our entire 7 night stay. Housekeeping is not a priority here. I have stayed at several Disney resorts, and booked late this time, so Saratoga was all that was available. Its expensive, there were 5 bus stops within the resort before our stop so it took forever to get to the park or to return to the room. Save your money and stay off property before you stay here. Our family thought it was terrible. Dirty rooms, terrible bus service, and not at all representative of the Disney name.

<Title>“Renovated Room - wonderful stay!”
<Content>Our family of 4 (kids 14 & 11) just returned from a week at Saratoga Springs and WDW on March 10. We booked our trip online and also took advantage of the online check in perk. So check in at the property was a breeze. We had asked to be in the Congress Park area on a 4th floor - our request was perfectly honored. Upon opening our door (room 2825) we breathed in the aroma of fresh carpet & paint - and also found a brand new mattress and reupholstered furniture inside. They were still working on our building and the construction workers were very polite - they informed us that our unit and floor had just been finished days before we arrived. We felt very lucky. Love the Congress Park area of the resort. It is a 5 minute walk to the main building, food service, pool - it also is the closest to Downtown Disney - and most rooms have a wonderful view of this. Housekeeping was excellent. We enjoyed both the Paddock Pool and High Rocks Pool - both have water slides, food & drink service. Every area/neighborhood with in Saratoga Springs (there are 5) has their own pool. We enjoyed the counter service breakfast daily at the Artist Palette - and refilling our mugs. Sam who works there is a wonderful, informative employee. He took time to explain and help us with our Disney Dining Plan and always engaged our children in genuine conversation. We used the WDW Bus services multiple times a day - never experienced an unusual wait for service - it is an amazing well oiled machine. We love Saratoga Springs - and I have been staying in WDW resorts since 1990 - have stayed at Value Resorts and Deluxe Resorts and all in between. Saratoga Springs is sprawling and a great get away from the hustle and bustle of the parks. I remember laying in bed several mornings and thinking how amazingly quiet and peaceful it was. Always - make dining reservations well in advance. We made ours in November for a March trip and still were unable to get into O'hana at the Poly. Dining Plan/Restaurant info: the refillable mug program is now included with your plan - no additional cost to purchase a mug. Also, for counter service meals (i.e.: at parks), a dessert is included, usually a pudding something in a cup - you can trade out your dessert for a bottled water. We did this daily at lunch and each had a water for the warm afternoons. Great service, view and meal at California Grill! Also enjoyed Liberty Tree at the MK and Biergarten in Germany at Epcot. We loved the food (3 course Prix Fixe) and our waitress at Chefs de France in Epcot - amazing quality of French food but had a terrible experience with the Check In/Table waiting process. We had a reservation at 530p - arrived at 520p - and were seated at 625p. We asked the seating manager about the wait, he was unhelpful and rude. I believe the key is to either book at 5p or closer to 630p - the place fills up at 5p and then you must wait for all the tables to start turning over. They will not seat a party of 4 at an open table for 6... you will only be seated at a 4 top - same for parties of 2. We also tried Via Napoli in Italy at Epcot for the first time and were not impressed with service or food.

<Title>“Great Disney Hotel”
<Content>If you are driving (which I would recommend that you do) it really doesn't matter too much about which disney property to stay at because the theme parks are not within walking distance from each other. One of the great perks about staying in a disney hotel is that the parking is free! I've stayed at the Disneyland Resort in LA and when comparing the customer service the staff here was not on the same level. However they were not awful so I can't complain too much. We stayed in the 2 bedroom villa - it was nice and cosy, clean and comfortable for 6 adults (2 couples/ 2 singles) The room was clean and had all your kitchen facilities. I would recommend this hotel - although explore your options and as long as your staying at a disney hotel during your visit, I can't see too much of a difference. But if you're worried about the cleanliness and comfort then this resort will do the job!

<Title>“2 bedroom villa”
<Content>I stayed here over Thanksgiving 2011 for five days in a 2 bedroom villa in the Congress Park section. Overall it was a nice vacation! We loved the view of Downtown Disney, the kitchen was perfect for making breakfast, and having a split bathroom in the master, made getting ready a breeze. The resort was well kept, the main check in area was beautiful and had great staff. The downsides, the carpet, tile and walls were not in good shape in our unit. There were a lot of broken tiles in the master bath, the grout was varying shades of brown, grey, and black, I couldn't tell what was the original color! I had to wipe all the surfaces with Clorox wipes, even the walls, because there were black fingerprints everywhere. Our socks were dirty within minutes of walking around on the carpet. I think the units could really use some maintanence. Also, I tried to vacuum one day, I have small messy eaters, and the vacuum started on fire! It was smoking everywhere, so I called housekeeping, but after two phone calls, my husband talked to the front desk and we finally got a new one, except they didn't take the old one! What a fire hazard! I think next time we will stay at a resort closer to one of the parks, this was a last minute trip, so there wasn't a lot of availability, I took what I got. If we ever stay here again it will only be after confirmation of a remodel. Finally, I was a bit unimpressed after checking in. We tried to get some help with our bags (we have an infant and toddler), the guys said to "come back to get one of us if you need help then". Um.... Ok. So my husband dragged all of our luggage to our unit himself while I watched the kids. Too bad for them because we tip well!

<Title>“Good location near Downtown Disney”
<Content>Just returned from a long weekend (four nights) at the Saratoga Springs Vacation Club property on WDW. We booked the hotel as a part of a Southwest Airlines package that included the hotel, airfare, theme park tickets and the regular dining plan. We arrived at the hotel in the late morning, long before the stated check-in time of 3:00 PM, so the room that we had pre checked-in for was not ready. However, we were given an upgrade from our studio to a one-bedoom unit which included a full kitchen, a washer/drywer, a whirlpool tub and a three section bathroom in addition to the separate bedroom and living room. Our unit was in the Congress Park section on the first floor (which we had requested) and we were right on the lake overlooking DTD. The room was clean but the furnishings were beginning to show some age. However, it appeared that some of the units in this portion of the hotel were in the process of being updated with new furniture, etc. The maid service was excellent, completely discreet and unnoticed but always finished by the time we returned to the hotel, whether in the late morning or later in the evening. We only ate one time at the counter service restaurant at the hotel, but the selection and the food were quite good. We always rent a car at WDW and we drive ourselves rather than using the disney transportation. We have found after numerous visits that the disney busses are fine during most of the day, but are a bit of a problem at the end of the day when everyone is leaving the theme parks at the same time. Therefore, we drive from what ever disney hotel we are staying at and park at one of the monorail hotels (if going to the MK), use valet parking, and get on the monorail to the park. At the end of the day when everyone is waiting for disney transport, we simply reverse our course, get our car from the valet, and are back to our hotel while others are still waiting for a bus. When we go to EPCOT, we use a similar process by parking at the Yacht/Beach Club or the Boardwalk, then walking to the International Gateway entrance, and then doing the reverse at the end of the day. While valet parking had formerly been free for anyone staying at a disney property, it now costs $12 per day. Even so, it is more convenient than standing in line for a long time or walking great distances after spending a day in the theme parks. Check-out was just as convenient as the check-in, with our folio being ready at request at the front desk. They also printed our boarding passes for our flight back to Chicago. In all, we found Saratoga Springs to be a good choice, with the only downside being the distance from the hotel to some of the theme parks. However, as WDW continues to grow and expand, distances from point A to point B will likely increase as well. Driving around the WDW property is no problem, as the direction signs are excellent.

<Title>“Nice Disney Resort”
<Content>We just spent three nights at the Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa on the Disney property. We had a studio apartment which is essentially a hotel room with a queen-sized bed and a sleeper sofa. The room also has a small kitchenette area with a refrigerator, sink, microwave, and coffeemaker. It's also equipped with plates, cups, and other utensils. The room had a balcony with two chairs and a table that looked out on the golf course, but I'd imagine your view is different depending on the location of your room. We had 3 adults in the room and I'd say that the room was about average size for a business hotel in the US (therefore, I think "studio" is a little misleading and makes the room seem like it will be bigger). The resort was very clean (as is everything on the Disney property). However, because we were using a friend's time share, we did not get housekeeping service during our stay. They clean rooms every 4 days so we did not get clean towels during our stay. One can pay extra to have the room cleaned more often. We did not. Generally, I appreciate the conservation efforts and believe that most people can keep a room clean on their own for 4 days. The resort is huge. We saw at least 3 pools on the property during our stay. We were near a pool with a hot tub, which are both apparently open 24 hours/day (which is very nice). Depending on where your room is, prepare to do a fair amount of walking to the bus stop and to the main building for food. Also, even though this resort is "next to" Downtown Disney, I would strongly recommend taking a bus from the resort to the Downtown Disney area (especially after a long day at the parks). Even the closest resort buildings are at least a 1/2 mile from Downtown Disney. Again, 1/2 a mile is not a bad walk on a nice day, but after we spent the last 9 hours walking around EPCOT, we were not happy we took the recommendation to walk there. The main/registration building has a moderately priced counter-service restaurant with various options for breakfast (including dairy-free for my husband). We were not there at lunch time during our stay, but dinner options were various sandwiches and pizzas. There was also a table-service restaurant on the property that we did not try. There was a bar in the main building (which was near a large pool with slide). There was also a gift shop and mini-mart in the main building with a pretty good selection of food and drink (alcohol & non) to stock your kitchenette. Be warned, though, that the vending area in each building only has beverages (although the front desk did not know this) and there's no room service. One of the great advantages of staying at the Disney resorts is the shuttle service to the parks. Absolutely love this service. We didn't wait very long for a bus to each park each day or on our return back to the resort. We found seats on the bus each time as well. We also appreciated the lines that they maintain to get onto the bus after returning to the resort. After a long day of orderly lines at the parks, we liked that they maintained the first-come-first-served procedure at the bus lines. Also great service checking in our bags at the resort and printing our boarding passes. Makes it very easy once you get to the Orlando airport (although the security lines are a disaster).

<Title>“Home Away from Home”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here for 7 days with our 3 kids (all under 6) and my 10 year old brother. We stayed in a two bedroom suite (room 94--, in The Grandstand section H of the property). Upon check in I thought it was quite a ways to walk from the main lobby area, especially for our visually impaired 6 year old, but we were assured it was less than a 5 minute walk. We happily walked to our room and it was peaceful and quiet the whole way. The room was beautiful! It over looked the golf course. It was clean every day we returned to our room and we never saw the cleaning staff at all. It was like a group of fairies came and secretly cleaned our room each day. There was enough room for all of us and our luggage, plus a kitchen and washer and dryer. The pool area in our section of the property was fun. It's a regular pool with a smaller play area for the kids. It also had a snack bar that is open during the day. The main pool near the lobby is very nice. There is a slide, play area for the kids, and near the convenience store in the main lobby. Plus, they bring out a big screen to watch Disney movies on some nights. The lobby area is also quite convenient with a gift shop and food store and deli. One of the best parts about Saratoga Springs is it is just across the lake from Downtown Disney. We rode the boat across the lake several times and it was lovely every time. On a side note, if you have kids younger than 8 take a stroller for them everywhere! The walk is not far for adults but kids tire quickly. We took a single and a double stroller every where we went and we definately needed them. Restaurants also accomodate parking for them. Anyway, the boat arrives about every 10-15 minutes but the wait is nothing. Plus, the boat only serves Saratoga Springs. The buses to and from the park are a bit more time consuming. You should definately allow 35-45 minutes to get to your destination. I did not heed this warning and we were late to our dining reservations more than once because of it. Plus, we left our room quite early in the morning in early April and it was cold out at 7:30am; it is also a bit cold out late at night. Other than that, The Grandstand has the first bus pick up for Saratoga Springs then 2-3 more stops around the property before departing to any given destination. Oh, some stops at Saratoga Springs do not get picked up for every park or Downtown Disney. If you're unsure ask one of the drivers when they stop. The only complaint I have is that our oldest tripped on the way back to our room from the lobby one night. She is visually impaired and the sidewalks are not very well lit and they slope up and down in some places and they turn in wide and sharp angles. She skinned her knee very badly. It hurt a great deal for the rest of our trip. However, the hotel staff was very nice about the whole incident. They brought out the first aid kit, cleaned it really good, and put a bandage on it. Then, much to her surprise and happiness, they gave her a crown and a wand and declared her a Disney princess (Disney really knows how to treat their guests, especially kids). She was overjoyed. Overall, great place to stay, friendly staff, clean, and we look forward to returning!

<Title>“Outstanding experience, time after time.”
<Content>This is one of the best resorts to stay at while in the Disney area. We started every morning with a quiet walk to Downtown Disney to get coffee from Ghiradelli and breakfast from Earl of Sandwich. Afternoons were spent by peaceful, well kept pools; and the disney bus was outside our door when we were ready to head to the parks. Talk about a vacation. YOu won't regret your stay at Saratoga.

Keep an eye out in the beginning of the year for book early specials. The transport systems to the parks and downtown Disney were first rate.

<Title>“Location, location, location!”
<Content>Saratoga Springs can be a terrific place to stay at Disney World if you remember this one fact; it is by far the largest and most spread-out of all the Disney resorts. The bus stops are far apart, especially if you have little kids. If you have a car with you and plan to drive to the various parks, then it doesn't matter much where in the resort you stay. But if you don't have a car, here's a piece of advice that can make big difference. When you make your reservation, whether on the phone or online, make sure you request the Springs area, as close to the Carriage House as possible. Here's why: you will be within easy walking distance of the front desk (which can help you with park tickets), the restaurants, the main pool, the arcade and the Bell Service desk which can get you a taxi if you need one. Also, the Springs bus stop is the last one in the loop, so you will be exiting the resort and getting to the various parks sooner (yes, you will be doing the reverse on the way home, but then hopefully the kids will be sleeping). I suggest you reinforce this request by calling and/or faxing the front desk between a week and 2 days prior to your arrival, and letting them know what you want again, as a friendly reminder. The people to mention in a fax are the room assigners. They will not give you a guarantee, but will try to respect your wishes. If there are any special considerations, anyone using a wheelchair or handicapped, by all means let them know. We were there in February 2012 -- it worked for us, and we had a great time!

<Title>“Even better the second time”
<Content>We first stayed here with our infant son in June 2009. We liked it quite a bit but after staying in Kidani Village in August 2011 and being completely blown away by almost everything there, I wasn't initially thrilled to be returning to Saratoga Springs this time. Boy, was I misguided. Both my husband and I agreed that this resort was so much better than we had even remembered. Although I initially requested a room in The Springs, we arrived for check in a little early with a cranky toddler so we opted for a room in Congress Park, which is where we stayed last time, but this room was in a better location in that section. I was appreciative to have a quick check in and several options of rooms. We definitely made the right decision! We had a first floor room that was steps from our car (we like to drive to the parks) which was a huge convenience. Sure, our patio looked out at the bus stop, but that wasn't a problem if you ask me. I loved being much closer walking distance to the central area. It was a pleasant walk, actually. The room is spacious and well laid out. My son really loved the jetted tub. We also had plenty of room for his toddler sized air mattress next to our bed, which we brought with us. We loved the market at Artist's Palette, too, which is the only downside of Kidani Village (they don't have one). I also was so pleased that housekeeping, at our request, serviced our room before noon each day so that we could come back from mornings in the parks and settle in for rest time. We had a great stay in every way. Thanks to the outstanding team at Saratoga Springs for a job well done. I can't wait to see what they do in the upcoming refurbishment of the rooms.

<Title>“Tree House Villa's are awesome!”
<Content>We've never been a big fan of the Saratoga Springs property - hard to pinpoint exactly why but perhaps its because nothing stands out - everything about the property is solid to good but there is no "wow" factor. That is, until they re-designed the Tree House Villas! Now, the Saratoga property has a home run! Clever circular design with 3 big bedrooms and a big living room connecting to the dining room and kitchen. Your own private deck awaits and like most Disney properties, they have outlawed insects so you are rarely bothered when you eat outside. The Master Bedroom bathroom is incredible! - giant 2+ person shower that connects to a tub - fun for a lot of reasons! We all love the Tree House villa's and since we love to walk, we don't mind the location. Or just grab a bus or boat and you can be on your way...

<Title>“Not my favorite Disney resort”
<Content>My group of 7 adults stayed here for the Disney Princesd half marathon this past weekend. We had a two bedroom villa & a separate studio. The resort is nice in terms of theme but way too large of a property- prepare for tons of walking! We stayed in the paddocks section chosen based on TA reviews. It is a good 10-15 min walk to lobby & store. The new paddocks pool is very nice & we enjoyed the slide but there were not enough chairs at the pool for the amount of people. I think next year we will try to stay at the BoardwAlk which must have opened up as a host resort for the race after we booked our rooms at Saratoga.

<Content>Whenever we go to Orlando, we stay at saratoga Springs. The hotel is huge, but everything works very well. The villas are big and very functional, staff is friendly and the location is excellent (inside Disney World Resort, but close to I4 and 535). The only reason I rate is Very Good instead of excellent is because I believe rooms need some refurbisihment in order to keep them "state of the art".

<Title>“Best Disney stay ever!”
<Content>My family and I stayed for 15 nights at this stunning resort. We have enjoyed stays at 9 of the Disney hotels and Saratoga is by far our favourite so far. Staff on arrival and throughout our stay were very courteous, friendly and accommodating. Although we had been allocated a well located room in The Springs, we requested a studio room in the Congress Park section overlooking Downtown Disney which was perfect and conveniently situated to the bus stop and amenities. There was also the boat dock nearby which goes to Downtown Disney, although we tended to go on foot most of the time because it was such a beautiful walk and only took about 10-15 minutes. Buses to the parks were never full and we even had a bus to ourselves a number of times. During our stay we visited some of the other hotels to dine at different restaurants and couldn’t help but compare how chilled out and relaxing Saratoga Springs is. If I have to give any criticism it would be that the bar in the Turf Bar & Grill is more like a kids/waiting room for the restaurant and doesn’t really inspire you to relax with a pre dinner drink. The food court, however, is adequate to grab a quick bite either before hitting the parks or after. Didn’t want to leave and will definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Love it!”
<Content>I have been here multiple times and every time is perfect. Check in is easy, I love the lobby and quick service option here but wish there were a better sit down option. Pool area is amazing and I love the daily Disney trivia and bingo games. I am obsessed with Disney and this resort never disappoints. Rooms are clean and spacious. We love the rooms in the carousel or grandstand.

<Title>“Perfect accomodations”
<Content>My family of 8 stayed in a 2 bedroom villa in the Grandstand Building. We found the accommodations to be immaculate, very spacious, and perfect for our needs. My grandchildren loved the gian jacuzzi tub and having twins it made it easy at bath time. The kitchen was perfect for breakfast as we had ordered groceries from the Garden Groce and they we delivered and Saratoga accepted the deliver, refrigerated items and delivered them when we arrived. I found everything to be in excellent conditionmand the beds were very comfortable. The house keeping staff was terrific. Besides cleaning the room they arranged stuff animals oasn the bed for the children and they were delighted to find them set uaspf when we arrived back to the hotel. The restaurants were good, limited menus but found that to be the case at most of the Disney area restaurants. Our favorite restaurant had to be Portobello in downtown Disney. Food was great and service was amazing.I am a travel agent and have stayedmin may hotels and would have to say Saratoga Springs exceeded our expectations and I will derinetly stay there agin and will recommend this to my clients.

<Title>“Disappointing for Disney”
<Content>We spent 5 days in Disney in November for the Food and Wine festival and Christmas celebration - the first few days we were located in the Boardwalk Villa (PERFECT!!) - last two nights in Saratoga (Not so perfect). First let me say, rooms were similar in size, equipped with microwave, fridge, coffee maker... After we checked out of BW, we had to go to Saratoga to check in because we were using the meal plan and that has to be taken care of at each individual hotel. This is rather inconvenient - I would have rather checked-in at night as to not waste time transferring from hotel to hotel. Check-in at Saratoga was very long. They had me listed for the room, but not my husband, so they had to cancel the reservation completely and re-do it. The girl at the desk was very nice, but again, this was wasting time I could have been spending at parks. After check-in, we proceeded to EPCOT. We had 4 snacks remaining on the cards we received from BW. When we got to EPCOT and tried to use the cards, they said the snacks had been used at Saratoga (not possible since we spent our morning at the check-in desk and headed directly to EPCOT afterwards) When we returned to Saratoga that evening, we explained what happened. (multiple times) While the night manager at the desk gave us the four snacks on our card, we got the distinct impression that she didn't believe us. (REALLY?? I'm not lying about four lousy snacks!) The day we were leaving, the boarding pass for my husband arrived at our door, mine did not! Again, back to the lobby area.... I will say, however, that while it did take some time to resolve, the girls at the airport check-in area and the woman and gentlemen at the baggage areas were lovely!! Maybe we just hit Saratoga on a bad two days, but I wouldn't return here - not Disney's best. The location is walking distance to Downtown Disney (probably took us about 15/20 minutes. The buses seem to be a little hit or miss here. One of the problems seems to be that if you're waiting a long time for a bus, you're afraid to leave to notify anyone for fear of missing the bus. I know a lot of people love it here, I'm just not one of them, a little bit too far from the areas I prefer.

<Title>“Best Holiday Ever”
<Content>Stayed for two weeks at Saratoga Springs. Settled in really quickly. Just a short walk to Downtown Disney or used the free buses - but they will not stop to let you on if they have closed their doors you have to wait for the next one. Used the Dining Plan and booked meals at other Disney hotels to see what they were like and some meals on the parks. Cape May Cafe at the Beach Club Resort was a seafood buffet and walked over to Disney's Boardwalk. Superb. Spirit of Aloha show at the Polynesian Resort used two meal allocations but was well worth it, great food and excellent show. Sanaa at Animal Kingdom Lodge was a fabulous meal watching the animals outside. 50's Prime Time at Hollywood was like 'Here's Lucy' home cooked chicken pie was lovely with great staff. Turf Club Bar & Grill was the restaurant on site, went 3 times choosing a different meal each time - Great. Liberty Tree at Magic Kingdom was like Thanksgiving meal - again superb. The only complaint was Wolfgang Puck's at Downtown Disney, upstairs is the exclusive part, taking two dining allocations so had to cancel a meal booked for later in the week and the meal wasn't that great, you were paying for the name. Also went to Tony's Town Square (Lady and the Tramp Restaurant) for spaghetti bolognaise, lovely. As well as the meals we had a quick service meal per day and a snack per day. Well worth getting the Dining Plan.

<Title>“A Peaceful Retreat From The Hectic World of Disney”
<Content>My wife, daughter and I stayed here for two nights following a cruise. We wanted to do a couple days in the parks while staying on property. We arranged our reservation through a Disney Vacation Club member which saved us quite a bit of money. Check in was a little lengthy. They didn't seem to have enough staff to handle both the new check-ins and those needing customer service. This would be my only complaint of our stay. Once it was our turn we received our keys, maps, information, and my daughter got a first trip to Disney World pin (which was a nice tough). We had a second floor room in The Paddock. The room was spacious and clean. The furnishing didn't seem overly worn. The soundproofing wasn't great as I was able to hear people in the exterior corridor. One benefit to staying on property is complimentary transportation to the parks. We did not take advantage of this since we had a car. I would actually recommend having a car even when staying on property. Since you are a WDW Resort guest, you are entitled to free parking at the parks and with a car you don't have to wait for a bus/monorail/ferry/a combo of these, etc. I was quite pleased with this resort and would definitely stay here again. It really was a quiet, relaxing getaway that felt removed from the business of the parks.

<Title>“Excellent”
<Content>Location: excellent - you can walk to Downtown Disney, it's also quiet, well located for everything and close to freeway. Rooms: huge, clean, really really nice. Kitchens small but fine. Great big hot tub a nice bonus. Grounds: nice green resort, well-kept, good for strolling or jogging On-site cafe: not so great, food a bit dubious and pricey, but could be worse. good coffee Gym: outstanding. Better than most proper gyms i've been to. Hugely impressive Pool area: we were there off season so not too crowded but it's not the biggest. Tip - there's a little-known secondary pool area on the waterfront on the way round to Downtown Disney. General ambience: nice place, really relaxed and well kept. Value: we got a special offer. Otherwise,it would have been quite expensive by Orlando standards. But you get what you pay for. I'd happily pay for the sheer convenience of it.

<Title>“Nice villa, bad everything else”
<Content>I have stayed at the Disney resorts many times and have always had a wonderful trip, not this time. The first problem is they only allow one vehicle per villa. We had 9 people and 2 cars. We could park one car at the villa and had to park the other at the main Saratoga resort. That was an inconvenience, but we could live with it. However, our room keys would never work the gate to get into the villas. They worked at the main Saratoga, but not the treehouse villas. We were told repeatedly, by a not so nice gate keeper to get a new key. After 3 sets of new keys and complaining to the front desk, she would open the gate when we pushed the call button. The keys never worked the gate. I wish this had been our only problem. Our first night at the hotel, my husband was up until 1am (after a long day on the road) because our heater didn't work. It was 35 degrees outside and we were freezing! We were issued a $25 credit for our troubles. I will say the lady who answered the phone for maintenance was very nice and called to check on us a couple of times. I was so frustrated with this trip, that we decided to skip our annual trip to Disney for next year. I expected a fun, relaxing time and didn't get it. We were so disappointed with disney this trip.

<Title>“Disney doesn't disappoint once again - loved it!”
<Content>We stayed in the Springs building in a studio apartment – two adults and one child and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The Springs building was really close to the Carriage House (it was just across the road) also where the main pool area was. Our room was pretty spacious with a double bed and sofa bed, plenty of room for the Pack n Play cot. There was a table and chairs in the room and also on the balcony. The room had a TV, DVD player and plenty of cupboard and wardrobe space, hangers for your clothes, toiletries in the bathroom replenished daily and plenty of towels. The small kitchen area had a sink, microwave, cups, plates, cutlery, bottle opener, tea towels, washing up liquid and a fridge. The room was clean and we had maid service every day. Our maid was brilliant and would leave a towel animal or arrange our daughter’s toys in a cute way, much to the delight of our daughter. I think it’s the little things like that that makes Disney so special. All the staff there are amazing, Disney’s customer service is second to none! The Artist’s Palette, which again was only over the road to our building, had a great selection of offerings. The main pool area was really nice with towels provided, the hot tub was sooo good and there were children’s activities around the pool each day. The grounds of the hotel are immaculate, lovely to run or walk around, we saw lots of wildlife. We loved the close proximity to Downtown Disney, just a short walk away. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel and can’t wait to be “welcomed home” again soon.

<Title>“Not for seasoned Travelers!!!”
<Content>First of all best western blows this place out of the water! It smelled of old moth balls and the carpet was straight out of the 1960's. The shower in the room next to ours leaked into our room and flooded the carpet. The resort did nothing about this! The cafe, Artists Palette had chicken nuggets that sat there for two days and the rest of the food looked like it was 2 days old straight out of an elementary lunch room! If you are single with no children spend the extra money and UPGRADE to The Grande Floridian or for heavens sake find a Four Seasons!!!

<Title>“Decent but some minor issues”
<Content>Took my 5 year-old son to Disney and shared a villa with my friend and her 2 children (ages 6 and 3). They are Florida residents and have season passes, so they travel to Disney frequently. I hadn't been in over 10 years. The check-in process was great; we were able to get to the room several hours before our friends arrived and the doorman and bell hop had tons of stickers for my boy. Our lodging consisted of a large bedroom with 2 queen beds and its own full bathroom which was joined to a full kitchen and living room and then another bedroom with a king bed and garden tub. Upon exploring the room, several minor issues appeared: #1 the folding door to the laundry area was off track, #2 the shutters over the garden tub were off track, #3 all the closet doors needed a good dose of lubication (my son could not open them without a substantial tug on the door from his mom). I could have overlooked any ONE of these things, but the trifecta of mechanical issues points to inattention to detail. We stayed for 3 nights and the sleep was awesome. We ate our breakfasts at the Paddock Grill by the pool everyday and had no problems getting around the property and to the parks thanks to the bus service. The entire resort was very quiet and mellow. Food prices in general are ridiculous throughout Disney.

<Title>“Clean, Friendly, Close to Everything, Perfect!”
<Content>Disney's Saratoga Springs Hotel was a lovely home away from home for my party of 5 adults. We stayed in a 2 room suite and found it to be very comfortable. We arrived rather late at night and the front desk/bell service employees were quick to help us get checked in. Bell Service provided us with a ride on a large golf cart to our room, since the resort is so large. The kitchen was well stocked and cleaned every day. The pools were large, heated, and uncrowded. I was impressed that the main pool always had two lifeguards on duty, even though it was the off season and there were very few swimmers. The Disney Bus Service was reliable and quick every day, and you can take the bus to the hotel lobby, since it can be a long walk from some parts of the resort. I would definitely consider staying at Saratoga Springs for my next Disney Trip!

<Content>We have stayed at many of the Disney properties but to us this is the best. It is well located to walk to Downtown Disney especially if you ask to say in Crongress park area, it is beautifully landscaped and lovely to walk around and sit by the pool areas. The staff are very helpful and always try to accommodate your requests. We visited in january for 6 nights a welcome break from the british winter! great time to be here it was very quiet. Food on site is excellent and we made good use of our dining plan, such good value. Looking forward to returning again soon

<Title>“Excellent Disney Marathon Weekend!”
<Content>I am one of Disney's biggest fans so this review will probaby be skewed because of that. We stayed at the Saratoga Springs resort for the January Marathon weekend. It was a gorgeous place albeit very spread out! Use their bus system instead of trying to walk from your room to the lobby if you are far away! Ask for a room by the pool. Ours was next to the The Paddock pool and just a hop skip and a jump from everything. Our 1 bedroom was perfect for me and my two teenagers. The rooms were pretty quiet and the grounds and hotel was well kept - of course - because its Disney.

<Title>“Great Disney resort”
<Content>We just stayed here over the New year and had another great stay, we've stayed a few times and this resort is really growing on us, this time we stayed at the springs and this is the best location in my opinion, its across the road from the main building, a short walk across the bridge to the quite pool and quick service location, the bus stops here first and is only a short walk to the path for down town Disney. next time we stay we will request this location again. We used the new quite pool a few times and it was nicely heated. The rooms are your normal DVC rooms and they are pretty much all the same, they have upgrade the tvs since our last visit to larger plasma style.

<Title>“Enjoyable stay at Disneys Saratoga Springs Resort.”
<Content>We checked in to Saratoga Springs on November 29 2011 for a 7 night stay. Our party consisted of myself, my husband and our 2 year old daughter. Upon arrival we saw just how incredibly LARGE the resort is. Check in was a breeze and everyone at the check in desk was friendly and attentive. Our daughter enjoyed the little chairs and classic cartoons running on the television. The lobby was beautiful and was decorated for the holiday season. It was very welcoming. We were put in a one bedroom villa in the Paddock building. Our room was SPOTLESS!! Both my husband and myself both stated how clean the villa was. If our daughter walked around in socks the bottoms stayed clean! The king size bed was heavenly. We woke each morning refreshed and ready to start the day. We had no noise problems at all. After a few days we noticed the refrigerator motor was getting louder, but as we were barely in the room we didn't worry about it. Our daughter slept in the living room in the pack and play. That worked out very well. Our only complaint was the couch was pretty awful. If you sat on it the cushions sunk so far in you ended up sitting on the frame of the couch..It hurt. WE enjoyed the new paddock pool. Our daughter really enjoyed the gated children's area. I noticed the kids having a fantastic time with the CM's doing pool side games. Every time we went to the pool kids and adults were all smiling and laughing. Even the employees just always seemed to be enjoying the day. That is a wonderful thing to see. We walked to downtown Disney a couple times. The walk was scenic and about 15 minutes from our unit. I could go on and on about our fun stay at this resort. We will be back again.

<Title>“Great apartment & location”
<Content>My husband and I stayed in a one bedroom apartment here for our honeymoon in November last year. The resort is huge but very well maintained, there was always work being done. We stayed in Congress Park which was closest to Downtown Disney, around a ten minute stroll. I read other reviews which said that it was miles away from the restaurant, shop and main pool but it was only around 10/15 minutes max and who cares? You're on holiday! There was also a 'quiet' more adult friendly pool which we only managed to use once. The restaurant there was great, as was the quick service restaurant which didn't really have much choice but thankfully offered an alternative to the usual burgers and chips (fries!). There was a bus stop just outside our apartment which was never too busy and the buses were extremely frequent. The resort itself was lovely and quiet, just what we wanted, and was nothing like the Animal Kingdom Lodge which we also stayed in (please see other review). We had a one bedroom apartment which was huge! We could easily have moved in it was so lovely. We had a bedroom with a lovely king size bed, a jucuzzi room, a shower room with seperate toilet and a living room/kitchen which had all the kitchen utensils you could need. We also had free wi-fi which was being tested in certain resorts apparently which was a bonus after reading that the charge prior to this was something like $20 a day. We had two bg flat screen TV's with limited TV channels unfortunately. Yes I know we were on holiday but it would have been nice to unwind to a nice movie in the evenings instead of being subjected to Hannah Montana etc every night! Other then that we had a fantastic holiday and would definitely stay here again, just have to start saving as it is VERY expensive!

<Title>“Great place to base your Disney vacation!”
<Content>We rented a 2 bedroom condo for 3 adults and 3 small children, and a 1bedroom condo for 2 adults and 1 teenager. Overall, the experience was great. Lovely rooms, great grounds, very efficient and accomodating cleaning staff and bell service. There was little to no noise from other rooms or common areas. There are enough pools that you don't have to go with the crowds and they seemed to be accessible any time we wanted to use them. Saratoga Springs provided a great oasis in the midst of the hustle bustle of Disney - and all parks were quickly and easily access by direct bus service. On the down side: the pullout couch in the 2 bedroom condo looked very uncomfortable - maybe okay for small children, not adults; the hotel restaurant food was not very good - much better food elsewhere in Disney. Also, we booked our stay 7 months in advance and I contacted Disney regularly to ensure that the 2 rooms would be booked together (same floor, same building) in a building in close proximity to the lobby, pool, restaurant, etc. due to my limited mobility. When we arrived we found that none of our requests were booked and I had to stand my ground to insist that we be accomodated. We were finally given 2 rooms on different floors in a building not too far away (but not as close as requested). I found this lack of consideration upsetting, but once straightened out, we enjoyed our stay. I would stay there again.

<Title>“A great place to stay!”
<Content>This was our first trip to Disneyworld, and we LOVED it! We were delighted with our choice of Saratoga Springs. The whole place is clean and the landscaped gardens are very pretty. The staff were very friendly at all times. Our room was a good 5 minute walk from the main lobby and restaurant area, but it wasn't a problem. We were 2 minutes from the bus stop - getting to all the Disney parks was SO easy, just wait for the bus with the name of your preferred park on the front, hop on and you're there! The pools were lovely, with slides, loungers and life guards. Breakfast was reasonably good, as long as you like waffles (Mickey-shaped - the kids loved it!), bacon and omelettes. Coffee's awful! Plastic cutlery and plates, but again, no problem if you're with children. We paid in advance for the meal plan, which was baffling for the first couple of days, but the staff were so helpful when we went to the till to pay. The Turf Club restaurant had excellent food. Our room was great - very comfy beds, good shower, nice view of the gardens, good coffee-maker, fridge and safe. TIP: If you're there over Hallowe-en, Saratoga Springs organise a great Trick-or-Treat around the hotel for the children. Unfortunately nobody told us beforehand, so we missed out. I think they would rather you bought tickets for the main event at the Magic Kingdom, which is VERY expensive.

<Content>Staff was great!! Location, could not have been better!! Rooms absolutly are in need of a good update. Nothing matched, bed cover and couch was old, looked like the 1970's maybe 80's. We wouldnt go any where near the couch, yuck!. But the bed was cumfy, and the bathroom was clean which is all we really needed, who goes to disney to sit in you hotel room all day. The resort is very large, nice pools, a nice quite one for adults as well, thats were we spent alot of time since we travled there without kids. Although, if we had kids the big pool would have been alot of fun, a few water slides, activites throughout the day, movie at night and a fire where you can make smores! yum! Downtown disneys is right there, just a few min walk. Lots of places to eat, drink and listen to live music. House of blues was fun! Mind you we have no kids...Saratoga springs, a little disney, but not over kill what so ever. All and all, i would def go back. Location the best!!! Great friendly staff!!

<Content>We stayed in the best hotel Disney has. The Treehouse Villas. They are amazing. Everywhere you look it is trees. The interior was flawless. Granite countertops, huge walkin shower and tub. Exposed ceiling beams. Full kitchen. Accommodations for 9. The only draw back is that they are a little harder to get out to the theme parks. They do their best to provide shuttles but it takes about 15 min longer then it normally would. That to be said it was well worth it. They also have a water ferry that takes you around. If you get a chance to stay their it is well worth it.

<Title>“Saratoga springs”
<Content>I have stayed at many Disney hotels on the negative side it is big and quite spread out depending on your room may need to get the resort bus to reception restaurant and shop. Plus point walking distance to downtown disney so better selection for dining even the satellite pools are large and not overcrowded. This hotel is probably suited to families without young children.

<Title>“Spacious, homey, good one in Disney”
<Content>Before we chose the Saratoga Springs, we already booked ourselves with Animal Kingdom because I was told it was the newest therefore the nicest, but I am relieved that we changed our minds the last minute. Saratoga Springs is conveniently located near the public areas and one of the first stops with the shuttle buses going around the area. The surroundings were nice and green. We had a two bedroom villa which was perfect for our family of five (all adults). There's one king size bed for me and my husband and in the second bedroom two big double beds that can fit two adults comfortable. My son stayed in one bed while my two daughters share the other. It has its own laundry and dryer which was really helpful. The kitchenette was well-equipped with an oven, cooking stove,dishwasher, microwave oven, big refrigerator, pans, pots,cooking utensils. The dining table can sit 6, but there's also the kitchen countertop for some extra dining space. The unit was clean and has a lot of storage space. There's a small balcony with a nice view. It was nice to wake up in the morning and see all the trees from our balcony door. We actually wanted to extend our stay for another day just because we really loved staying here. The only downside is the service. I would rate it a 7. Reception was excellent and friendly but housekeeping was not too efficient. When they cleaned our room, all the dirty bedsheets,towels,etc were placed outside our front door uncollected until the night we arrived from the park. I called the housekeeping to ask them to remove the soiled items but it took forever for them to do that. I had visitors (a family visiting Disneyland but staying in another hotel outside Disney property) who were curious to see our villa. I had to bundle all the dirty laundry myself and hid them in one corner. Until they left, it was still there. Overall, it will not prevent us from choosing Saratoga again. We went to see what we missed in Animal Kingdom. It was nicely decorated (the lobby), but quite darkly lit for our taste. And very far from everything. It's very isolated. They have good restaurants though (we went and ate there). That homey feel is what always gets me.

<Title>“Perfect Vacation!”
<Content>We stayed in a studio room for nine days and it could not have been better. The room was just the right size for 3 of us. They originally had me in a room close to the main building, but I had requested one in the Congress complex and within minutes they had found us a room and moved us. It was a perfect location for us to walk to Downtown Disney, which we did almost daily. Bus stop was within a minute walk and was always running on time. The resort is beautiful, food was very good and they had everything within walking distance a family could want. We are planning an other vacation for next year!

<Title>“Nice Place with Minor Flaws”
<Content>The Saratoga Springs Resort is a nice escape from the usual crowds at Disney World. Although we visited the parks, it was lovely to return to this property which seems worlds away from the usual Disney hustle-bustle. We were able to walk to Downtown Disney in the evening and my husband was able to golf at the on-site course. The spa is soothing with a very nice staff, although a bit pricey. Our two bedroom suite could have used a little maintenance attention--a noisy, rattling refrigerator, a burned out light bulb, and a kitchen drawer which was not aligned properly. Upon our arrival, I found a juice box wrapper and a pair of tennis socks in the master bedroom. This being said, we found the condo to be comfortable and roomy. The well-tended grounds and beautiful pools more than made up for the small issues with the room. The staff was warm and welcoming and we would definitely be willing to give this resort another try.

<Title>“Great place for families with teens!”
<Content>We had a a one bedroom, kitchen, split bathroom, and living room with balcony on third floor. We cooked breakfast in the mornings before heading out to the parks and the fold out couch was great for the teens. We had a corner unit which made it very quite and pleasant. It was nice to walk to downtown Disney and a lovely property to walk around. My husband golfed one day so we enjoyed the pools and the grounds. Just make sure upon check in that you know exactly where your unit is or have them "golf" cart you over to it-especially if it is in the late evening. The "grocery store" on premises was very nice to have too. Great place for us older parents with teens.

<Title>“Disney is always great but....”
<Content>A lot of fun at this property but for me it does not have that magical "Disney" feel. Anything Disney does and any resort inside is awesome so I can't complain. The theme of this resort was just not our thing. Great location for Downtown Diseny access. And if you need a villa then the space was great.

<Title>“Christmas at Disney”
<Content>Disney is beautiful at Christmastime. People as always were helpful and courteous. This was our first time visiting during the holidays. The parks, restaurants and attractions had long waits. It was disappointing that even fast passes would " sell out" leaving us to either wait in line for hours or not see the attraction. We waited until extra hours at magic kingdom and were able to visit more from 10pm to 1 am than the previous 8 hours. The condo was nice and well equipped. The air conditioning is on a power saver and we were often hot at night. The new pool was nice and the activity staff did a nice job. Overall, a good visit.

<Title>“Relaxing Disney Resort”
<Content>This was much better than we were expecting. We had a studio, double bed and sofa bed. Not sure they can call it a kitchen, small sink & microwave & fridge. No proper plates or cutlery, just disposable ones - so does n0t encourage you to eat in your room. We had a 14 night stay so over the course of our holiday we did visit a few other Disney resorts and boy were we glad we picked Saratoga. Most of the other hotels we visited felt noisy, busy and just not relaxing. After a busy day at the Parks it was a relief to get back to the peace and quiet at Saratoga. If the patio door was open you did get a lot of noise from downtown disney at night, but once closed this was not an issue and in no way affected our sleep. The room was cleaned every day, we did not expect that. although on a couple of days when we were having a later start we were hastled by the room guys as they wanted to get in and move on to their next job. Facilities at teh resort are good, our daughter loved both the pools and enjoyed the activities at the main pool. The resort restaurant, The Artist Palette, is not all that. We only had a breakfast and a couple of snacks from here and were not inclined to return. I would have no hesitiation in returning to this resort.

<Title>“In need of updating”
<Content>Disney World is an ever-changing land, constantly being updated, changing and evolving but his resort is not. This is not to say Saratoga Springs is not worth a considering. This resort just needs some TLC and updating. The complex is HUGH. (perhaps they are updating in areas but not in the area we stayed. As DVC owners, we stayed here for a short post cruise vacation before heading back home. The location is great with views of Downtown Disney. Some areas have a walking/jogging/biking path that leads directly downtown, other areas would require either using the bus system or car to reach it. There is also a water shuttle as an option. All in all the villa was nice, just tired. This would not be our first choice to stay again but would rather stay here instead of not going at all.

<Content>We stayed at the Saratoga Spring during the end of the year. Like allways great service and we had a nice stay during our time at Disney. Very close to Downtown Disney and has the transportation facilities of Disney that reduces the need of a rental car. I would recommeded with no hesitation.

<Title>“Perfect for the holiday of a lifetime!”
<Content>Went to the Saratoga Spring Resort in January with extended family. Stayed in a 2 bedroom villa in the Springs. We thought the hotel was absolutely perfect for a stay at Disney and provided great access to Downtown Disney by the bus or Boat. The Villa was very spacious and not at all dated, we found all the bed linen and tableware to be very clean and the maid service was exceptional. The hotel staff were very attentive including children's entertainment. Food - The artist palette is ok for quick service meals breakfast, lunch and evening snacks. Surf and turf is a fantastic restaurant, high quality food and great service but book if it is busy. If you can get the Disney Dining plan as you can eat all over Disney. Dont forget you have to pay 18% gratuities Would love to visit again Ask any Questions

<Title>“Behind the Scenes at Saratoga.”
<Content>Dont use the blanket or top cover on your bed. The one in the closet is usually cleaner. If i were you, i would strip off the blanket/top cover and call for KING blankets. (more than 1 if you get cold easily). Those are fresh and clean and quite comfortable. The towels are clean, so dont worry about that too much. Dont use the soaps. They dry you out. Rewash all of your dishes. Just put them in the dishwasher on normal wash ((INCLUDING SILVER WARE)) and you will be set.

<Title>“DVC resort. Pleasant accomodations - convenient to Downtown Disney not convenient to Theme Parks”
<Content>The accomodations are good. They show signs of wear on the carpet and furniture. It is spread out and can be a long walk from the distant villas to the food "court" (Artist Pallette) and office. The Spa is excellent and Elizabeth gives a great swedish massage. DVC memebers get discount on certain Spa treatments. It is convenient by bus and boat to Downtown Disney. Other than driving, the bus is the only transportation to the theme parks. Allow enough time to get to your destination, because there are a lot of bus stops. As a DVC member, I prefer the Boardwalk.

<Title>“Good Disney but not returning”
<Content>We arrived on 5th jan 2012 for our second visit to this resort and wonderful and helpful by Disney magical express and got to Saratoga in under 30 minutes. Upon arrival check in was very fast if the girl was a bit offish but that was ok, I was tired so maybe it was me. We got to our studio room easily and found it as expected, as you enter there is a microwave and tiny kitchenette thing on your left and sink, dressing area and bathroom on the left. In front is the main room with double bed and sofa bed with tv and table and 2 chairs last but not least a double patio door to a nice balcony with chairs and table. Not big but big enough for 2. It is very tired but not dirty and as well kept as possible for the price. There are 4 pools and if you go away from main one and most of the time the smaller pools are normally very quiet. In the centre of the resort is the 2 restraints one the artists pallete which is a snack option type with awful food but that is my personal feeling others really love it, it is like an expensive junk food place and the other the turf club which is more like a restrauant but very pricey but this is Disney so on balance it is ok, especially if you are on the dining plan. Overall the resort is fine and I would be happy here as most of the staff really do care but here is the reason I will NEVER return to Disney, after 4 days at disney my wife became unwell and has been unwell for 3 days now with what appears to be food poisoning, one the first day I went to the turf club and had a quick meal and came back to the room and the staff kindly gave me a chicken soup to take away for my wife which I thought was great, the next day she came with me to the turf club and tried to eat but could not so they offered to box the food so we could take it with us but we thanked them and did not take them up on the offer. Tonight I thought I would see if they could kindly just put my meal in a box for me and I can take it back to the room but wow!!! I asked the lady at the front and she kindly said they could not do that so I thought ok fair enough and thanked her and started to walk away then she said I have to have a table so I said sorry my wife is unwell and just wanted something takeaway then she a Disney member told me very rudely that it is not her problem and not going to make them break the rules but said in a nasty way! I almost replied well really we have only eaten at Disney for 7 days so maybe it should be their problem but I just calmly walked away not another word to be said. I have been staying at Disney for 30 years now and this is the last time ever for me but for all you looking for saratoga then I would still recommend it as 99% of the staff are great and I am sure you will love it but the Disney magic was stolen away from us in under 2 minutes. Overall we have loved Disney and thanks to that vile woman we now look forward to another destination every 2 years :) goodbye and thank for many happy times. Sorry should have said there is free wireless Internet here and also free parking or busses to all Disney parks and the wait are as long as 15 minutes but normally much less.

<Title>“Nice, but not ideal”
<Content>This property is very pretty and nice. It's set up more like a very large apartment complex rather than a hotel, though. It would be great for those who enjoy taking walks, going on runs or bike riding while they are on vacation. I traveled with my 6 year old son and we were about a 10 minute walk away from the main building where the resturant/grocery store was. Normally that's no big deal, but when you've already put miles and miles of walking on your shoes at the theme parks, sometimes it's nice to just be able to stop in the lobby and grab something to eat on your way up to your room. When we arrived at the hotel and got checked in, there was someone there to load our suitcases onto a golf cart and give us a ride to our room. When we checked out, however, that wasn't the case. In all fairness, we checked out around 11:00am, when everyone is checking out, but I tried several times and wasn't able to reach anyone at the bell desk to help us with our luggage. Therefore, I had to lug our bags all the way up to the main building by myself, (I was lucky to get my son to take his own carry-on bag). This took much longer than the normal 10 minute walk! The rooms themselves are okay. Honestly, I expected something nicer for a 5 star resort. They were somewhat outdated, but had everything we needed like a microwave, sink, mini-fridge as well as glasses and utinsels. I mistakenly expected the room to have a king size bed, however it had a queen size bed and a queen size pull-out couch. Apparently, that's how all the "Deluxe suites" are. That was my mistake for not reading closer. Overall our experience at the resort was good, however with all the choices among the Disney resorts, I'd probably stay somewhere else next time.

<Title>“Not for Us”
<Content>We were invited to use a guest studio at Saratoga Springs at Disney resort area. We have stayed at other places. If you have small children and like the wide open areas, you may like it. They are like private apartments rather than hotel rooms. The downside is that unless you are bringing in your own groceries, you are out of luck; no room service, everything is at least a 15 minute walk, you don't get daily maid service unless you are a vacation club rentor. Otherwise no towels for 4 days and no rides to other areas of the site. There are buses to the parks to walk to. Pool areas are nice and food is adequate at snack areas. The pool area for children is nice and many lifeguards on hand. The good thing for adults very nice pub at the Surf&Turf Club and that restaurant served some of the best food at Disney. We also dined at the Coral Reef at Epcot-not anything to rave about and the waitstaff is rushing you to finish and get out. The very best place is the Beach Club by far since you can walk the boardwalk and over the bridge right into Epcot and anywhere else so convenient. Food is also much better and concierge treatment. It is pricier but the perks are worth it if you are going on a vacation. If you are going with family the dining plan is great since you can eat good dinners at a fraction of the cost and quick meals, snacks. Otherwise bring food in for day meals or make your own, there are frig. in the rooms. Take water to parks. Have fun

<Title>“Treehouse Villas at Saratoga springs!”
<Content>We are Disney Vacation Club members and used our points to book two Treehouse Villas for a week for a family reunion. We had 2 adults and 2 children in one villa and 4 adults and 2 children in the second villa. This is a very quiet place in the trees away the noise of Walt Disney World. Each villa has 3 bedrooms (The Master has 1 queen, Bedroom #2 has 1 queen, and Bedroom #3 has bunk beds), 2 full bathrooms, and a large living area. There is also a large deck with table and chairs. The villa also has a kitchen with all the appliances one could need. Plus a stacked washer and dryer! The only down side of this property is the sparse parking and that there is no direct transportation to the parks. You have to catch a bus to the main part of Saratoga Springs and transfer to another bus. However, there is a boat that picks you up and takes you to Downtown Disney, which is nice.

<Title>“Living on the treetops”
<Content>We specifically chose this resort for our party of seven. The Treehouse villas can accommodate up to nine people. There are 3 bedrooms ( 2 Queen and 1 bunk bed) each with its own flat screen TV/DVD and 2 full bathrooms and in suite laundry. In the living area are a double pull out sofa bed and a single pull out chair bed. A complete kitchen with full sized appliances comes stocked with pots, pans, utensils and dishware. Part of the 65 acre Saratoga Springs Resort, it is located far from the theme parks but we knew this in advanced and planned our schedule around this fact. Even within the Saratoga Springs resort, the Treehouse villas feel a bit removed from the main Carriage House where the reception, restaurant and swimming pool are located. We had very little interaction with castmembers because we really had no need. We rented through a DVC member so daily maid service was not included – only a trash and tidy on day four. The villas were clean and comfortable but a little dark. It helped by opening up the curtains but it could have used better lighting. Although there are many windows to take in the view, none of them open to get fresh air. There are no locks on the doors to each bedroom, nor are there locks on the bathroom doors so be prepared for the lack of privacy. There is an in suite safe provided to keep your valuables. There is also patio seating on an outside deck as well as a charcoal barbeque. There is a small pool in the Treehouse area but we did not use it considering we had record low temperatures while were there. The no charge WiFi is dependable and fast. I’ve read a few complaints about how long and complicated it is to get to the theme parks using Disney’s transportation and I had some doubts about it before arriving. But after a day we figured out what worked best for us and planned enough time to get to the parks. We requested a room in the south part of the Treehouse Villas. Visit this link for maps and more info/pictures. http://allears.net/acc/faq_treehouse.htm We stayed in villa 7058 which provided direct (less than a minute walk) easy access to the boat launch to Downtown Disney where you could connect with buses to the theme parks. It also provided direct (less than a minute walk) easy access to the internal south bus stop. Saratoga Springs Resort is so large and spread out that an internal bus takes you to each of the villas where you can connect to a WDW bus which in turn takes you to the theme parks. We never had to wait more than 10 minutes for a bus and often we were running to catch it before it left. Here’s a helpful tip. Both the internal bus and the theme park bus travel in one direction. Returning from a theme park the bus travels from ‘The Grandstand’ to ‘The Carousel’ to ‘The Paddock’ to ‘Congress Park’ to ‘The Springs’. What we found to be the most efficient was whenever we were headed to the theme parks we caught the internal bus that took us directly to ‘The Springs’ and transferred to a theme park bus. This minimized walking and avoided meandering through the other Saratoga Springs stops. Whenever returning from a theme park we got off at ‘The Grandstand’. This was the first returning stop and then took an easy 5 minute walk across the parking lot and through the golf course between the 17th and 18th hole right to our villa. If you’re looking for a quiet wilderness experience and have a family of 7, then this might fit your bill. Overall we were pleased with our stay at the Treehouse villas but the rate Disney charges seems a bit high for what you get. So look for a better rate on a DVC rent/trade board like mouseowners.com

<Title>“Family trip January 2012”
<Content>We stayed at Saratoga Springs for 4 nights, January 2-6. There were 6 of us, 4 adults, 2 children ages 9 and 13. I could not find any negatives at this resort. From the check in which was a breeze as I preregistered us beforehand, to the staff, to the accommodations, everything was exceptional. We stayed in the Paddock area, close to the bus stop. Never had any issues with the transportation. We never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus, even returning from the parks. We were able to enjoy the parks in the morning, return to rest in the afternoon and go back at in the evening. The boys enjoyed the main pool one afternoon and gave it high marks. We ate lunch at the Artist's Pallette two days and dinner one evening at the Turf Club. We were on the dining plan and these were included. Food was good, not outstanding, but a variety not burgers and fries. We had a 2 bedroom villa with more than enough room for all of us. Nice size full kitchen. The beds were heavenly-like sleeping on a cloud. We were concerned when we read that the second bedroom had a queen bed and a queen sofa as the second bed, but there were 2 queen sized bed in the bedroom. There was also a queen sleeper sofa in the living room. We would definitely return. Wish we could have had more time. Very quiet and hardly ever saw anyone else out and about.

<Title>“It's pricey, but worth it for the location”
<Content>Our family just loves this place! The two larger pools are incredible. The zero entry is so great for relaxing in the pool with toddlers. The staff is friendly and helpful. (This has always been the case when we visit Disney.) The grounds are beautiful and perfectly maintained. The villas give larger families the room needed, without being split up. The furniture is a little beat up and worn. It is so nice to take the walk over to Downtown Disney. The available boat transprtation is great, too. I would stay here again in a heartbeat...despite a couple of flaws. OK...the flaws? The food selection stinks. It is not adequate for the size of the resort. (It wasn't that great, either.) Also, the bus transport to the parks takes forever!! The bus transport times are soooo much longer than we experienced at the other Disney resorts. That is frustrating when you are tired at the end of the day. But, the pools, community center (for kids activities), and grounds still make this a great place to experience Disney. Almost forgot...the nighttime movies and fireside smores making were great, too!

<Title>“Our view from the trees...”
<Content>Stayed at the Treehouse Villas on a passholder rate 12/22-12/24. Stayed in unit #7036 right across from the pool and overlooking the golf course on the other side. Beautiful accommodations among the trees. So relaxing to get up first thing and sit outside in the quiet with a cup of coffee and watch the sun rise. Hint: Be sure to get some pool towels to dry off the seats and table as the morning dew can be intense. Just drop them back in the towel return in the am. Rooms were spacious, clean and definitely fun being in the round. Just love the bedding in the bunk room ( treehouse villas with all forest animals on them) really nice. Kids had their own rooms and could do laundry at their leisure. Master bedroom was nice--plenty of room. Really enjoyed taking a bath with Mickey bath bombs from Basin--complete with Mickey confetti! Glad we had the special rate as the Holiday Rate is definitely out of our budget. Transportation was especially fun on the boats and just a short walk. Took the buses and they worked as well. Really enjoyed walking too--just so much to see. Pool was cold--not sure it was 82 degrees, but the hot tub was perfect. Pool area really clean and decorations were beautiful at Christmas--very nature oriented. The wreaths even had a hedgehog in them!! Went pool hopping and found the Grandstand pool was very warm and the Rock Springs hot tubs were great. Would definitely recommend, but would only stay on a special rate plan.

<Title>“Great stay in a treehouse”
<Content>We stayed in a Saratoga Springs treehouse in late April 2011. Spacious 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom spread with a full kitchen, living room and a table for dining. Shower in the master bathroom was terrific. Kitchen was stocked with glasses, plates & silverware. Washer & dryer in the place came with a small box of laundry detergent. Only drawback to the treehouse area is the need to take a bus to the main area of Saratoga Springs. You can walk but we had our 3 year old with us. The pool area was amazing. I suggest you get there early to save lounge chairs. The pool area filled up quickly. We took a boat ride from Saratoga Springs to downtown disney. It was a fun way to get there & nicer than taking the bus. Overall, the resort more than meets expectations & I wouldn't hesitate to take my family there again. We'd most likely stay in the main area instead of the treehouse for convenience sake.

<Title>“Disney Saratoga Springs”
<Content>A great place to stay in the Disney compound. Big complex with walking/biking paths, several pools, spa and large fittness area. You need to take a bus to get to the parks but we love the fact that we can walk to Downtown Disney for shows and dining. Highly recommend it.

<Title>“Great Central Location for WDW Resort”
<Content>This was my second stay at Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa (SSR). My husband and I spent our honeymoon here in May of 2009 in a studio. For our Dec 2011 trip, we stayed in a two bedroom suite with my two children (22 & 17). SSR is a great Disney resort if you bring your own car because the parking is right outside each building. The room was spacious with a full kitchen, comfortable beds, and two well-appointed bathrooms. We had a great view of Downtown Disney from our balcony on the third floor. The room layout is a little awkward in the master bathroom, and the couch in the living room needed to be replaced. SSR is in the Deluxe Villa class of Disney resort, and our room was showing her age a bit. As a Disney Vacation Club member, I can safely say that SSR needs a facelift, but the signs of age in the room (fraying carpet in the closet, the couch, etc.) wouldn’t stop me from staying here again.

<Title>“Disney but not overkill”
<Content>We are time share holders at Saratoga Springs and definitely feel like we are returning "home" each time we stay here. The staff is courteous and friendly, the rooms are always clean and well appointed. We stayed at a one bedroom villa this time which is way more than adequate for a couple. Washer/dryer is a great benefit when staying for longer visits. For the first time our view was not great though since we overlooked the parking lot. The buses were usually convenient. We found that it is convenient to walk to down town Disney and maybe take the bus back if you have any substantial packages. The resort itself is huge, however, and the maps around the walkways not always easy to interpret since some are fading.

<Title>“Our best holiday EVER”
<Content>Saratoga Springs is an escape from everyday life. It is a Disney resort, but it is not too Disney. It is a posh resort, but not too posh. Think of this resort as an elaborate template to a perfect Disney holiday. You can dine where you want, visit where you want and play where you want both within the resort and outside the resort you are given ultimate flexibility as part of staying in a Disney Resort. And I would divide this flexibility into four parts. The room, the dining, the facilities and the transport. Firstly, the room. We booked a 1 bedroom villa, which is a studio apartment with an extra bedroom and an upgraded bathroom and washing facilities. This size room is perfect for a family of 4 with enough space to spend as a family, but enough space to give the adults some space too. Both beds were comfortable and we always kept the sofa bed in its bed form as you could still use it as a sofa as well. Whilst we didn't spend as much in the room as we could have, we appreciated the Jacuzzi bath to come back to after a long day in the parks, and the kitchen was as good as my kitchen at home! It was well equipped with everything you could possibly need and everything was as new. The groceries at the resort are overpriced so we visited Wal Mart once (about 15 mins drive) and at the start of our holiday we had a grocery delivery from Garden Grocer which the porter brought to our room. The staff were another thing that made this resort brilliant, with helpful and attentive waiters and bar staff, and also friendly security staff! Darlene was the nicest gate person ever - and she was great with our children. This theme continues throughout the whole of Walt Disney World. Now the dining. I would highly recommend the Disney Dining Plan and we would not travel back without it. It allows you to eat in and out of your Disney Resort Hotel as you please (but you should definitely make reservations online 180 days before your visit for all table service restaurants). Specifically at this resort, there are two poolside bars, one at The Paddock which serves a full food menu and one at The Springs which serves light snacks. These are complimented by the quick service Artists Palette which also serves a full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu counter service style, with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. Outside of the resort Downtown Disney is just a short boat or bus ride away and is walkable, and provides access to even more restaurants and dining opportunities. The facilities - both of the feature pools at the resort are outstanding! The new feature pool at The Paddock is great and the slide gave hours of fun to our family. Ask for a room in The Springs area to be within walking distance of Reception, The Spa, The Lake Buena Vista Golf Course, both feature pools, and all of the dining locations. The second most convenient area is The Paddock. All facilities were well kept and the resort was impeccably landscaped. The transport - The nearest hire car destination is a 15 minute walk from the Hotel Reception or ask for a taxi (about 7 dollars). This is at the Buena Vista Palace Hotel. Alternatively rent ac car at the airport. A free bus service from the hotel to Orlando International is available and it is called Disney's Magical Express. Once at the hotel you can use your car to get around and note that there are two exits to the resort, so check your map to see which is best for where you are travelling to. The free buses to the parks were frequent, but if you are using them get up early and plan to take your bus at least 1 hour before the park opens to get you a seat and to the parks in time for opening.

<Title>“Wonderful experience with small children”
<Content>It was 4 adults and two small children (4 & 6). The property was exceptional and well maintained. Well kept grounds and pools. Great golf course and the ferry ride to Downtown Disney was GREAT! Every 20 minutes the boat was there. Downtown Disney was fun to shop and night life. We enjoyed the ease of transportation from the airport and to the parks. Saratoga is a beautiful place to stay the staff were very helpful. They helped with getting us cab to go grocery shoppping the minute we arrived. My husband was really impressed with the golf course and the staff. We requested a unit close to the bus shuttle...this was very helpful, the night after the Christmas parade...two small children sleep in a down poor of rain. This was an awful night-we did not get the see the parade, but decided to purchase tickets again for another night-well worh the money!!!! The Christmas parade and the park decorations were the BEST!! We are making plans for next year. I highly recommend staying on the property--we will.

<Title>“Older Resort, Prepare to Walk”
<Content>We went to Disney for a week, and got a phone call by a friend who wanted to surprise us with a one night stay at a disney resort. She had some extra points left this year from her Disney Vacation Club membership and gave it to us. Everything was booked except the Saratoga Springs Resort. We were not able to experience the entire resort since we were there only one night. But we do have a favorably mixed review: POSITIVES: Reception was exceptional. The check-in staff were very friendly, especially the one who checked us in. She was an intern from South Korea. I noticed she was and being Korean-American who can speak some Korean, I started to speak Korean to her. She was so overjoyed and then was very friendly and pleasant and explained everything to me right away. Kids Swimming Pool. There is a pool at the Paddock which is perfect for kids. It doesn't get deeper than 3 feet and there are slides and a gradual inclined beach-type side of the pool. There are three slides - small, medium, and large. They also have great pool-side games like bingo while we were there. And it was heated during the December months. Location. The Saratoga Springs resort is a 15-minute walk to Downtown Disney, or a brief ferry boat ride away. NEGATIVES: Size of the resort. This resort is so huge and wide that everything is spread out. That meant we had to walk a lot or even drive our car to get to the other side of the resort. To get to a pool, we had to drive or prepare to walk a lot. This we didn't like very much. Late Check-in. We were supposed to be able to check-in at 3 pm. When we got there at 2:30, they said no rooms were available until 4 pm. They said as soon as a room was ready, they would text us the room #. At 4:10, still no text message. So I called the front desk and they said there had been a room ready for quite some time and they didn't know what really happened. They made us wait while we didn't really have to wait. Somewhere, the communications lines broke down. No extra sheets or blankets in the room. Since they gave us a queen bed with sofa bed, you would expect there to be extra sheets, blankets, and pillows for the sofa bed, but there was none. When we called for some, it took them almost an hour to come and bring them to us. We had the Disney dining plan, but that is not required.

<Title>“Treehouse Villas relaxing”
<Content>My husband and I spent an enjoyable week with our daughter and family in a Saratoga Springs' Treehouse Villa, 4 adults and 4 children (ages 1, 3, 8, and 10). This provided a quiet setting away from the hustle and bustle of the Walt Disney World complex when we weren't visiting one of the parks. With 3 bedrooms (1 king, 1 queen, and 1 bunk beds), 2 roomy full baths, and a spacious living area, we were quite comfortable. We also enjoyed the deck furnished with table, chairs, and benches; the surrounding trees afforded a measure of privacy. A fully-equipped kitchen with full-size appliances (stove, microwave, refrigerator, and dish washer) allowed us the flexibility of preparing meals, which we did frequently, eating at the large dining table with a view of the surrounding woods. The furnishings and decor provided a comfortable, rustic environment indoors, perfect for the setting. Everything was clean and easily accessible. One should be aware that the villas sit 10 feet off the ground, so there are stairs to climb! Transportation by bus or boat every 20 minutes gave access to other ares of the Saratoga Springs resort where we could catch buses to the parks. We could also travel to Downtown Disney by boat. Should we choose to walk, there were also paths to the main area of the resort. Though I have not stayed at other Disney World resorts, I think I would choose the Treehouse Villas again because of the quiet atmosphere and comfort.

<Title>“Yearly Trip!”
<Content>We are DVC members and returned again to Saratoga Springs. The Property was well maintained again and I found no problems with our one bedroom. I have read complaints about how large the property is and i disagree. I like the large property, it helps with crowds and gives the feeling of not being packed together as in a smaller property. I enjoy an early morning walk across the property for a cup of coffee, Its peaceful! i was located in the carrousel section which has the greatest distance from the store and check in. Peace and Quiet! Bus service was good in the morning hours and slacked off in the afternoon. but overall the bus service was good. All cast members were very kind and had no problems.

<Title>“Tree House Villa: a quiet retreat in the heart of Disney magic...”
<Content>One of our favorite room types at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa is the Tree House Villas. We had an extended party of eight people and the villas accommodate up to 9 people. The villa, 7047, was in excellent shape. It is an accessible villa with a long ramp to access the unit. The bed in the master bedroom consequently was a "low" bed that proved a bit difficult for me (I'm over six foot tall.). The bed in the master bedroom is a queen bed, not a king. The Tree House Villas a quiet, tranquil with a "camp" like atmosphere outside. Transportation requires a bus transfer. There are two bus stops: North and South. After departing the tree houses, the bus stops at The Springs which will get you to a bus to all of the Disney Parks. The buses were frequent. You could also walk, which is a great option except at 1:20 in the morning after Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party! The living area is awesome for large party. Excellent kitchen facilities. The living room was a great size with plenty of seating. The dining table was impressive. There was a washer and dryer in the villa. Bell services provide transportation to the villa with our luggage and picked us up on our departure day. I arranged the the departure the day prior. There is a small pool within easy walking distance of all of the Tree House Villas. The main pool, High Rock Springs, with a water slide and pool activities is also available. We recommend the Tree House Villas for families and extended families.

<Title>“No self use baggage carts”
<Content>many nice things at saratoga springs pros - good pool, bus service to the parks, cons- some units have road noise from the highway, our unit had excessive mold in the bath tiles, and a really dirty bathroom door. Guests are not allowed to use a baggage cart themselves. they are the sole property of the valet folks, we had 2 families staying for a week with a lot of stuff going to the 4th floor, which we wanted to load and unload at our own times without have ing to tip the front desk valet baggage people.

<Content>My husband and I just returned from a 5 night stay at Saratoga Springs - absolutely beautiful! This is the first Disney resort that we stayed at 7 years ago on our first trip to Disney - we have also stayed at The Boardwalk and Old Key West. Saratoga Springs is definitely our favorite hotel - beautiful rooms, very spacious, and the staff (as they are everywhere on Disney property) was fantastic. We're already talking about our next trip! Love it!

<Title>“Disney quality w/o too much Disney”
<Content>It is a great resort and room was very nice and clean (1 bedroom villa). You know you are in Disney, but not overdone and a little more relaxed feed. Very spread out which is nice but you do walk more-also able to park right at room if you have car vs. some where you park in lot and have long walk to room. Very nice to walk over to Downtown Disney, Westside and bus service to other parks good. Food choices good at resort but overall great due to proximety to Downtown. This is our 4th stay here and overall a good choice, especially for a more relaxed stay and getting away from crowds if necessary, but still enjoying the Disney magic.

<Title>“Nice place, pleasant stay”
<Content>We just stayed 2 nights here, courtesy of some leftover points my daughter had from her timeshare. The points would expire this year and since we live close by and she is up north, she offered them to us. We asked for a room near a bus stop and were in Congress Park in a one bedroom villa. Perfect size for us. Everything except a wood-armed chair were in excellent condition. Nice people, buses ran mostly efficiently and we would stay here again.

<Content>This is the third Deluxe Villa we have stayed and is up there in comparison. The studio we had was average in size and enough for two adults. The location is great being so close to Downtown Disney. The staff was kind (typical Disney) and helped with any questions. The bus transprotation to the parks was on time and always and easy trip. We only stayed for 3 days and would recomend getting a car if staying longer and doing "different" activities. Overall I prefer Old Key West but Saratoga is second.

<Content>Stayed for two weeks and was my two year old son's first stay at a Disney hotel.in terms of cleanliness the room was serviced every four days.overall the room was nice and clean.My one complaint would be the bath.it obviously hadn't been properly cleaned for many months.there was a thick build up of mildue and the drain was full of body hair.not very pleasant.location was excellent.our room was only a five minute walk to downtown Disney.the hotel is only a short drive to all the disney theme parks.also there are three swimming pools which are all of a very good standard and child friendly.we stayed in a one bedroom villa which had a large double bed and a pull down sofa bed.kitchen was excellent and villa came with fridge/freezer and washer/dryer along with a dishwasher.was pleasantly surprised by how large the villa was.service was ok although our DVD remote wasn't working and when I phoned housekeeping they said they would send someone along to replace/fix the remote, but no one ever came.in terms of value for money you get what you pay for.a beautiful hotel in a lovely location for a pretty penny.

<Content>We stayed at Saratoga Springs for 6 nights at the end of October. The Tree House Villa was fabulous! With 3 bedrooms and 2 full bathrooms, a fully equiped kitchen, livingroom and outdoor deck with patio furniture we couldn't have asked for more. 6 adult family members stayed in the Villa with room to spare. It was very peaceful and a nice retreat from the Disney Parks crowds. The transportation system is extremely efficient for getting to and from any of the parks. The hotel grounds and pools were amazing. I would recommend this location to anyone! We will be going back again!

<Title>“peaceful yet full of Disney magic”
<Content>This hotel has been our only choice for the past few times because, I admit, we wait until the last minute to book our trips. The hotel is huge and is separated into five different buildings. The main part as the check in, a few dining options, the gift shop, and the activity center. There is also another pool for people farther away from the main building. Tip: if you want to be close to the main building, do the online check in to secure the hotel room. The hotel is very beautiful and they have a ton of activities and events to do while you aren't at the parks. The rooms are very spacious even though we had the smallest size. The only bad thing is the bus stops. You are waiting for a bus a lot because they have to go to all the buildings and the same for the drop off. Other than that, I really enjoy this hotel!

<Title>“Nice resort”
<Content>We rented a studio and it was smaller than we expected. It was like a regular hotel room with a kitchenette (mini fridge, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, sink and cabinets). No dishes or utensils provided. You do get coffee and pwdered milk packets. We got one shampoo and conditioner at check in and a note indicating we could request more for $5! We got some at a shop instead. Extra towels are also charged for but you can get more for free at the pools. We were in the Paddocks which would be nice if you have small children. It is near a very noisy kiddie pool with slides and a snack bar whic is open until midnight. It is also near a bus stop and there is a walk way to carriage house and to Down town Disney. The Artist's point is the cafeteria style dining option. It is not very nice. We went to the grocery shop at Crossroads and got supplies and had a couple of meals of property. There were some cute things like movies under the stars by the pool and the campfire at night with marshmallows. The park busses were slow and crowded and so are the boats. We rented a car and it was no problem. You park free at the parks just by showing your resort ID. The room was clean and the porch was a nice place to have coffee. It would have been nicer if our neighbor didnt smoke on his every time we went out there! We stayed in a non smoking building but it didnt seem to deter the smokers. The bed was comfy. The second bed a pull out Q sofa was right next to the bed so we had no privacy. Pics online make it appear as if it is behind a partition but it is actually just beside the bed. There was ample parking and there is a security gate. When we arrived the gate keeper said, Welcome Home.

<Title>“Musty/mildewy rooms, otherwise would have been a good choice.”
<Content>This was our fourth stay at a DVC resort buy first at Saratoga Springs. We have been renting points through a DVC owner for the past few years. We rented a two bedroom villa during Thanksgiving week, which was similar in layout and feel to other DVC resorts. PROS: We found the resort to be serene and quiet and particularly enjoyed the new, smaller Paddock pool for its lack of crowds. I am not sure why I have read so many transportation complaints. We found the bus service to be very good, overall. We always choose a 2 bedroom villa as we like to have our own bedroom apart from the kids and we use the kitchen for quick breakfasts before the parks as well as snacks. CONS: The major con was that many of the rooms are musty and mildewy. The first room we were given smelled so bad we asked to be moved immediately. The second room was only marginally better. We were offered a "deep cleaning" which included filter changes. This only helped for day or so and the musty smell returned. I asked several times for a dehumidifier. I was told they were going to purchase one for our room but that never happened. I really did not want to move rooms again so we just dealt with it, though it likely would prevent me from staying here again. Too bad, because otherwise we found it to be a good value and would consider another stay. The resort is also huge and spread out, so expect long walks or use the bus.

<Title>“peaceful”
<Content>This was our first stay here. The room was nice since it was a one bedroom timeshare it came with a large bed, a pullout bed/ couch, table and chairs, microwave, large mini fridge ,sink kitchen area and bathroom. We stayed in the 6000 rooms which are kind of a hike to the front lobby but only a 7 minute walk to downtown Disney. We spend most of out time shopping and dinning there. There is a water taxi you can take from the lobby area to downtown and back that is nice! Lots of stuff to do at Downtown Disney! Located just a couple minutes walk is also a great pool with a awesome waterside that we both went down! I have not done that in years!! There is a larger pool near the front lobby of the hotel with games for the kids to do inside pool area and an arcade. Also another waterside and hot tub. Couple of key notes: This resort is very spread out , lots of walking , ( keep that in mind if you have been at the park all day with little ones) ask for a room close to lobby or bus stop . Should make coming home a lot easier. Also any issue that have to be addressed by front desk are going to take longer the further you are away. Have a rental car parking passes are free. We took Disney magical express to and from airport. Worked out really well !

<Title>“Pleasant Stay”
<Content>We stayed at the Saratoga Springs Resort for a few days before Thanksgiving and really enjoyed our stay. The complex was sprawling but most everything was still within a few minutes walk. We stayed in the Paddock area at the farthest building from the main house and close to the main road and the local firehouse although neither were loud enough to be a distraction. With 14, 4, and 1 year olds the highlight of the resort was the High Rock and Paddock area pools. Both were uniquely different from one another and but the spash area at the Paddock area was perfect for the little one. You can easily spend two hours by the pool without being bored. The room was nice, clean, and (most importantly) ready early. There is only one central pair of elevators per building but the elevators run quickly. There were new applicances and the room seemed as if it had been painted recently (but no odor). The staff was pleasant but we really didn't have much interaction with them. The outside of the buildings are attractive but don't seem any different from Old Key West or the Beach Club as opposed to the Wilderness Lodge or Kidani Village. I can't really say that the resort architecture reminds me of upstate New York at all. The grounds are well maintained with flowers, trees, and ponds. The resort is right next door to Downtown Disney and is a two mile loop from the golf course bridge to Cirque de Solei and over to Rainforest Cafe and back to the resort - all on sidewalks. My wife and I got an early run on this route and loved running through Downtown Disney while it was closed. While not our favorite resort - Kidani Village and the Wilderness Lodge are in a tie - we would not have a problem returning to Saratoga Springs Resorts.

<Title>“Wonderful place to stay”
<Content>We have stayed twice at Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa. We found this property to be very clean and the staff extremely friendly. It is convenient to stay right within disney grounds and use their transportation. The Spa is wonderful and the services are excellent. I would highly recommend this Resort.

<Title>“Nice Property but Needs Some Updating and Better Amenities”
<Content>My family and I just returned from a week at Saratoga Springs in Disney. We stayed in one of the two bedroom villas which was very spacious and very clean but getting a bit worn around the edges. The first thing we noticed on arrival was that the kitchen cabinets were all nicked and a few had gouges out of them. In addtition, the furniture was nicked and dinged. The sofa in the living room was caved in the center and one of the cushions was very worn and pretty flat. We stayed at a Family Suite in one of the All Star Resorts several years ago that was actually in better condition. Having the laundry facilities in the room was great. My kids loved the pools (all three of them were within walking distance of where we stayed in Congress Park). We ate breakfast at the Artists' Palette several times and it was quite good. I also bought groceries there one day which was very convenient. However, I was surprised to find out that there was no transportation available to help me get them back to my room. I had to lug three bags back with milk, juice, and some wine and several other heavy items back to my room which was about a ten minute walk. I understand that providing golf cart service to all the guests trying to get around the resort would be a logistical nightmare but there should be some sort of in resort shuttle to help people get around to the pools and the restaurants, especially after they have been walking through the parks all day or when they are trying to manage bundles like I was. Even if they had had some type of shopping cart available for me to use to take the groceries back it would have been helpful. Overall the trip was lovely and Disney is always very easy to deal with so I would go back. Hopefully they will give the rooms an update before then.

<Title>“Great place to stay”
<Content>We stayed here during early November. We had a studio room which came with a kitchenette but as we were on the dining plan, we only made use of the coffee machine. As we had booked some evening meals at other hotels, it was easy to get to and from them by walking to Downtown Disney and only needing to catch one bus. We stayed at Congress Park which is only a 5 minute walk to Downtown Disney. The rooms were kept fairly clean but there could have been a bit more attention to detail, especially as it's a deluxe resort. We didn't use any of the pools or spa facilities and didn't have time to watch any of the 'by the pool' movies. We have stayed at the Caribbean Beach and Port Orleans Riverside and would say we won't be staying at another deluxe in the future (it's a waste of money if you don't use the extra facilities they have).

<Title>“Another Magical Stay at Disney's Saratoga Springs”
<Content>This was our second stay at Saratoga Springs and it was almost perfect! We booked a studio room for our daughter's birthday. Upon checking in, our room was ready. It was the greatest location! We were in the Paddock right next to the new pool and bus stop! The staff was so friendly and helpful, as always. Since we were celebrating a birthday, all the girls in our party received tiaras upon check-in. Our room was in perfect shape, very clean and nicely decorated. We also had a perfect water view! The only issue we had was upon checking out. To make a very long story short, the front desk cast member was not sure how to run a gift card and ended up taking too much money off of the card. The front desk managers got involved and after an hour of standing at the desk, they sent us on to the park and said they would call on our cell phone when they got it figured out. We never received a call from either of the two managers. When we arrived back at Saratoga Springs to get on the Magical Express, we checked with the front desk to see if there was a message for us regarding our credit. The evening staff didn't know anything about what happened that morning. They were super apologetic and resolved the issue immediately. Thanks so much to the awesome front desk employees that rectified our problem so quickly...Kudos to Sue from Orlando, Eric from Hawaii, and Amy, the evening manager. You are awesome! Also a big thank you to Carlos from Arizona at Bell Services. One more big thank you to Jim at the Artist's Palette from Montpieler. You really brightened my daughter's day (and mine also) with your kindness in sharing your pin with her. Saratoga has many wonderful employees, but if you see these people, they really stood out in making our day.

<Title>“resort is to big”
<Content>This was may second time at this resort the resort is nice but to big on our first night there we wait one hour for the bus to take us to downtown disney the next night we waited for forty five minutes to go to magic kingdom,the bus service at this resort is terrible, the boat will take you to downtown disney a hell of alot faster.If your planing on waiting for buses on your vacation then this is the resort for that!we walked around the resort from bus stop to bus stop to see if we could catch a bus,but that was no luck so we did see some of the resort and it was nice,even the rooms are very nice,but all of that means nothing if you have to wait so long for a bus to take you to a park

<Title>“Always something to do!”
<Content>we've stayed here a few times now and love it. its so close to Downtown Disney and thats open til at least 11 pm so theres a not a lack of something close by to do if you don't have a car. you can walk there (about 10 minutes) or take the boat back and forth. But the pool are a blast with movie nights and bingo and other activities and the Equestrian decor is upscale but with a warm Disney flare. ON A NEGATIVE NOTE, OUR PHONE DIDNT WORK ALL WEEK AFTER CALLING THE HELP DESK. not very disney-like. : ( but they did hold all my dads b-day cards that we had sent down there as a surprise.

<Title>“wished we had stayed longer :o(”
<Content>we spent the last 6 days of our trip here. We got it at quite a decent price with free dining which was an added bonus. We arrived at about 1pm not expecting to get our room but we wanted something to eat after our long drive up from Miami. Check in staff informed us our allocated room was not ready but rang housekeeping and gave us the choice of 4 alternative rooms. We opted for the paddocks and were given a second floor room overlooking the lake in the next block to the pool and the bus stop. We were amazed by the size of the rooms. Two large bedrooms both en-suite. The master bedroom had a large Jacuzzi bath, a shower room and a toilet. Washing machine, dishwasher & full kitchen in living room. Three large tvs & dvd. The safe was on the small size..only really big enough for passports, tickets etc...no way would you get anything like a laptop in it. We had free wifi in the room which was a surprise. The resort was lovely, we used the buses all week and never waited more than 10mins for a bus and they were not crowded..we got a seat every time. We used the boat service across to Downtown Disney but walking was just as quick. We only used the pool at the paddocks but saw the others and they looked amazing too. At the paddocks pool they did entertainment for the kids and gave away little prizes. Their was a lovely fountain play area for the little ones. Housekeeping was done daily and they left supplies of washing powder, dishwasher powder and shampoo and shower gel on a daily basis. They did a good job at keeping both the resort and the rooms very clean and tidy. We used the counter service restaurant several times (artist palette) wasnt overly impressed here. Was a little confusing and once even though i clearly said i was using the dining plan, it was charged to my room key instead of taking credits but quickly rectified. I would not hesitate at staying there again..hopefully longer.

<Title>“Transportation nightmare”
<Content>The hotel, restaurant, spa, pools, and lobby are beautiful and fun! The only downfall, unless you have your own vehicle, is the transportation. Stop after stop, long waits for buses, and getting from the carriage house (the check in area), is exhausting for vacationers who aren't there to be in a walkathon!

<Title>“Lovely hotel but a few improvements could be made to transport!”
<Content>Just back from 16 nights at the Saratoga Springs. It is a lovely resort, but like others have said, it is very big and took us a couple of days to work out where everything was and which was the quickest route to get to it. We had a studio in the Paddock area, near the Congress Park bus stop. It was just over a 5 minute walk to the Paddock Swimming pool which was excellent. The main pool itself had a big slide for older children and adults which led into the big pool which was initially quite cold, although there was also a lovely warm hot tub next to it. There was also an excellent shallow childrens pool with slides right next to it, which our young children loved and would happily have spent all day there. There is also a laundry next to the pool, which was quite handy. The main pool up near "The Springs" bus stop and the restaurants also looked good, but more for slightly older children. Mousekeeping was excellent and we often returned to find our childrens teddies in various poses on their bed, which often brought a smile to their faces. The only thing I would mention was that when we arrived in our room after a 9 hr flight, there was only one bed made, when they already knew we were a family of 4. I phoned reception and they told me to pull out the sofa bed and get sheets, blanket & pillows from the wardrobe and make it up myself, which I don't think is good enough and not the standard which I would expect from Disney. Also when I booked I was told it would be 2 proper full size beds, but it was just one and a sofa bed. (Whereas my friend who booked a studio in Key West was given a room with 2 proper beds). The good thing about the location of our hotel was that it was within walking distance to downtown, which was far quicker than waiting for a bus or boat (although the boat was nice to take too).The walk just took around 15 mins from our room. We had the Disney Dining Plan, which I would definately recommend. It enabled us to dine in some excellent locations such as Chef Mickey, Ohanas, Cinderella's Table, Akershus & Narcosses, all which I highly recommend. Also for the quick dining, we found Wolfgang Pucks Express over at Downtown the best place for choice, away from your usual hotdogs and chicken nuggets. They did lovely wood-fired Pizza's along with freshly made salads and various pastas etc. While staying here we also ate at the hotel's "Artists Palate" and the "Turf Club", both of which were good. There is also a small shop selling essentials like bread, milk, cereals etc. which was handy if you wanted to make breakfast in your room before heading to the parks. The only thing which I would say which let the hotel down, was the bus service. On a couple of occassions we were left stranded for ages. One day we walked to the bus stop @ Typhoon Lagoon around 4pm, 5pm we were still waiting for a bus as none had come along. Then a guy who worked at T.Lagoon said our best bet would be to get a bus to downtown, which had just pulled in and then get another one from there to our hotel, as after 5pm the park closes and they stop sending buses shortly after. Well we got the bus to downtown and waited a further hour there without anything arriving for Saratogo, whilst watching around 4 buses appear for pretty much each and every other resort in that time. We gave up and walked through downtown over to our hotel. This night we ended up missing our dinner reservation in Epcot due to the time wasted waiting for buses. The irony of it all was that if there was a pedestrian crossing next to Typhoon Lagoon, we could have walked from there to our hotel within half an hour. We had stayed at the All Stars a few years ago and had never experienced a problem with the buses. Which is why I was happy to stay on Disney property again,as this would save us hiring a car, as we were unsure of the roads and driving abroad. However after this experience, when we return to Florida again, we will definatley be hiring a car! All in all I would highly recommend this hotel, but just hire a car unless you are happy waiting around for ages on transport.

<Title>“Wonderful place to stay!”
<Content>Okay so I visited this place as a guest of my brother who "owns" time there. Just driving up to the facility is breathtaking with the rolling hills, beautiful golf course, manicured lawns and of course the friendly smiles from the Disney folks. I traveled with 3 children and 3 adults and this place had MORE than enough space. Two huge bedrooms and 2 full size bathrooms. The shower in the master bathroom was huge, but needed more spaces to keep your soap and etc. The villa included a full kitchen, and an apartment sized washer and dryer and A small eating area, family room and a balcony. It even has a entry way kinda of "vestibule" area that makes it feel like you are entering an apartment. When you enter the facility, it feels like you are entering an apartment complex. Of course, who can talk badly about Disney's customer service right? It was exceptional! Okay - so more about this place, it is wonderful. Spacious, clean, and extremely quiet. In various places of the villa are extra ammenities just in case you forget, including a port a crib and a high chair. Extra laundry detergent, dishwasher detergent, you know that kind of stuff. I didn't hear anyone ever while there, and we were there in the Summer - in a place brimming over with children! The check in process was quick and easy. Disney always does this very well. The pool we went to was large enough to not feel crowded and was the perfect temperature. There are multiple pools. They have movies you can watch from the pool or poolside at night. This places basically has everything you need. The only problem we had with the Disney buses was waiting for a bus to the magic kingdom. Sometimes it took up to 15 minutes....this is strange for Disney. They ahve shuttle buses that take you anywhere. The only thing I would change is that the furnishings were a little outdated, especially the sleeper sofa in the living area. Its definitely time for renovations. Other than that - great place to stay after a long day at Disney!

<Title>“Excellent stay”
<Content>Spend 4 days at Saratoga using our Disney Vacation Club Points. Arrived there early and checked in, our room wasn't ready but we didnt expect it to be so we already had a bag packed for the pool. The check in man was really good and told us which block our room would be in but as we saw it was at the back of the resort we asked him to change it and he got us into a much nearer building right by one of the quieter pools. We had a 1 bed villa which was perfect for the 3 of us, nothing missing or broken and spotlessly clean. We love this resort, main pool is manic so we avoid it but there were plenty of chairs at the smaller pools all day. Didnt use the restaurant this time but did use the small food court which is good value. The bar area is very nice with lots of comfy chairs, great to relax in there after a busy day. Main bonus for us is that its an easy walk into Downtown Disney which is much nicer than the longwinded Disney buses which take a while to go round the resort but thats because its such a huge place. I cant understand how anyone could have any complaints about this resort - we love it and cant wait for our next stay - Disney at its best!!!

<Title>“Overall a really nice hotel”
<Content>I just returned from Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa with my 2 children ages 11 and 8. We stayed for 4 nights in a 1-Bedroom unit in "The Springs". I had called a few days before my arrival to request a room near transportation to the parks and my request was happily met. The hotel is immense. Almost too big. It took approx 45 minutes to return at night from the parks even without waiting more than 10 minutes for a bus to arrive. We were the 5th and last stop in the resort coming home. This seemed to be the only negative I could find with the hotel and I don't look for things to complain about. The hotel was clean and in really good condition. It reminded me a lot of Vero Beach in color scheme and decorative touches. The pool area had a nice slide for the kids to enjoy and it was easy to find a lounge chair near the pool. They had 3 lifeguards on duty which I appreciated. Our 1 Bedroom unit was fine for 3 people but I would imagine it would have been a lot more crowded if my husband would have joined us on this trip. The kids slept on the pull-out couch which was very comfortable for them. I had to keep their suitcase in my bedroom because there was no place to put it in the living room. The bedroom had a small dresser with 4 small drawers in total for the whole unit, definitely not enough storage! The bathroom had the typical Disney hot tub with the weird shutters opening into the bedroom. Not sure what family is using this hot tub! The hot tub in Kidani Village is private and in a bathroom with a door that closed and locked. I ordered groceries in advance and it was already in our room upon arrival. It was great to be able to have breakfast in the room and then get right to the parks! Saratoga Springs is a nice resort and it doesn't over do it on the Disney theme. As a satisfied DVC member I would recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Great resort, would definitely stay here again.”
<Content>Great resort, we had a studio apartment at the Springs which was just across the road from the main bus stop, pool, reception and resturants. Staff were always very pleasant and keen to know what you were doing each day. It's quite a large resort with 4 bus stops, which can be a pain as adds quite a bit of journey time. On a positive it was only a 10 mins pleasant walk to Downtown Disney. Laundry facilities were free which was a great added bonus. Used the Lynx bus service to get to Universal Studies, which was a bargain at $4.50 each. Very straight forward, took a bit of extra time but cheaper than paying for a Mears transfer. Really easy to get the bus to seaworld and aquatica. Would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Great Getaway!”
<Content>We own at Saratoga Springs Resort, but haven't stayed here in a while. We actually used our RCI week and exchanged into the resort for a 7 night stay. We brought along another family....there were 8 total....4 adults/4children. Each family had a 1 BR unit in the Springs Section. It couldn't have been better! We were about the same distance from both the Main Pool and the new Paddock Pool. The kids LOVED having 2 options to choose from, and enjoyed both pools! Both units looked out onto the lake with amazing views. The kids enjoyed getting off at the Paddock Bus Stop and walking across the bridge to the Springs section. They would look for turtles and fish along the way. We had the dining plan and utilized Artist's Pallette for some Quick-Service meals. The seating area is not large enough for a resort this size, but with a little patience, we always managed to find seating. The bus service was excellent....we never waited more than 7-10 minutes for a bus to the parks/downtown Disney. Overall, a wonderful experience at Saratoga Springs. The grounds are beautiful and very well maintained. The staff was very accommodating and helpful throughout our stay. We were so sad to leave!!

<Title>“Nice Charm But Far Away From Parks”
<Content>Saratoga Springs is a very nice resort to a disney standard. This is my third stay at disney and this is my favourite resort. Very nice restaurant, I recommend the steak. The pools were great. The children loved the water slides and fountains. The hotel stuck well to its 1920s horse racing theme.But the hotels lay out way extremely large, it was so large we had to take three stops on the way to the parks on the bus. The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times. The 2 bedroom villa was great. It had a nice kitchenette and a jacuzzi bathtub. The TVs were all flat screens and the rooms were perfectly clean. The largest down side was the long 18 minute distance from most parks.

<Title>“Very Nice Stay!”
<Content>Just returned from a stay in a dedicated 2 bedroom villa (King bed in one room, 2 queens in 2nd bedroom) at Saratoga Springs 5 adults, 1 small child (3). We arrived early for check in (around noon) and our room was ready, we were in the Carousel building, right off the main entrance, but very far from the main building and pools. The room was spotless upon arrival, everything was in perfect working order, the view from the balcony was pleasant, overlooking a canal, some trees and the Cirque du Soleil building in the distance. You could hear bus noise from the road behind our building IF the balcony door was open. (when the door was closed the room was completely quiet. (In fact, as a person that prefers white noise to fall asleep, it was bordering on too quiet in the bedrooms. I was alone in this opinion.) Beds were comfortable, even though I prefer fitted sheets on the beds, the pack and play crib was very convenient to have in the room and the pullout sofa was deemed more comfortable than your standard "2in mattress on an iron bar" that everyone's in-laws has in their den. A/C was very quiet and the ceiling fans were a nice touch. The bathroom light had a motion sensor and would dimly come on when you stumbled in in the middle of the night, which was nice. We found the resort nice, the grounds beautiful, fairly kid friendly, the room definitely had plenty of space for the 6 of us; the kitchen was super convenient, and we felt it was a much better value over all than our usual plan of getting 2 rooms at a deluxe. The bus service to the parks, which is much maligned in many reviews, was fine for us, we never waited more than 10 minutes for a bus at any time. (but this can vary wildly from trip to trip) Couple of negatives, housekeeping, we booked this through Disney reservations and are not DVC members, so we had housekeeping every day. The second day, housekeeping did not arrive until almost 4pm, by this time we were in the room with a napping toddler, so we just had towels dropped off. We should have probably called for early cleaning, but the next day it was done before we headed back to the hotel, so it may have been a fluke. Lastly, it wasn't too big of an inconvenience for us because we used our kitchen and had a car, but the carousel building we were in was extremely far from the main building of the hotel. It was kind of a hassle to have to get in the car every time we needed something from the store. Cannot say anything about the onsite dining, as we didn't use it. All in all, very nice value, beautiful resort, nice rooms, we really enjoyed our stay, would stay here again.

<Title>“Wonderful holiday. 4.5 stars.”
<Content>We've just come back from a 14 night stay in Saratoga Springs, staying in a 1 bed villa, Grandstand area, first floor. We were a bit worried that a first floor room so close to the car park would be noisy but it was lovely and quiet except when the linen trolleys were dropping off baskets above us. (that woke us up 3 mornings). The rooms were very clean, well equipped and well maintained, no need to bring any extra cutlery, crockery, dish wash cloths, dish washer powder, washing powder, kitchen paper etc as all provided and replaced when used. It even had 3 lidded sandwich boxes. The beds were too firm for us but we are used to memory foam, we bought a cheap topper from wal-mart for $35 and left it behind. The sofa was very comfortable as a sofa but not as a bed, like me, my 18 year old who slept on it is used to nice soft memory foam bed, and found the sofa bed had a hard ridge across her shoulders, I tried it and would not have been able to sleep on it. My 11 year old found it comfortable. Although the site is huge the walk from The Grandstand to main pool and Artist Palette is reasonably short. We used the main Springs pool and the new Paddock pool both very nice, comfortable sun beds, plenty of them but spoilt by annoying loud music and cast members on loud speakers desperately trying to get guests who were trying to have a quiet time away from the hustle and bustle of the parks to join in with bingo and quiz's. (Why do they always do that!) The Artists Palette is ok for a snack but we found the menu very limited, much better at Port Orleans where we have stayed previously. The Turf Club restaurant is wonderful! The best meal in Disneyworld, this visit and on a previous visits, we have stayed in Disney World a total of 64 nights over 5 years, all on Disney Dining Plan, so we have eaten almost everywhere, The Turf Club is consistently the best for food quality, service and atmosphere. (Almost equalled by Grand Floridian Café, also highly recommended). I can’t recommend highly enough that you book and stay in a Disney Resort when free dining is available, some friends of ours went at the same time as us and stayed ‘off site’ to save money, they ended up spending more than us and ate outside the parks a few times as the park food was expensive so lost valuable time in the parks, they also missed out on Magic Hours and had to pay every day to park. Also the food tastes so much better when its free! A bill for a family of 4 for $145.00 for one meal can leave a bitter after taste. .5 of a point knocked off for a hard bed, noisy pool entertainment and limited counter service menu, I would still highly recommend this resort.

<Title>“Villa vs hotel”
<Content>We stayed here because we got an incredible rate, for a 2 bedroom villa. We travel in a group of 5 adults and a toddler, so we usually book 2 rooms. This enabled us all to stay together in a 2 bedroom 2 bath villa with a full kitchen. Master bedroom was great very large, separate shower, toilet and garden jetted tub. Quite a romantic set up. It would come in handy if you are staying there as a family, and finally get the kids down for the night! Other bedroom had 2 queens and a pack & play for the toddler easy to unfold & set up, spacious area for putting it anywhere. We loved the bathroom vanities were separate from the toilets, also there are 3 sinks in the 2 bedroom villa, so getting 5 people ready was easy quick & painless. TONS of closet and storage, thrilled to have stacked washer & dryer in the villa. Kitchen had full sized fridge microwave coffee maker, oven (we baked cookies!!), nice granite counter tops, and seats up to the bar. Sofa was a nice pull out full size bed. TV in each room. bedding not as nice as at beach club, just the usual blanket & regular sheets, nothing fancy. Mattresses were firm but very comfortable in both sides of the villa. We had plenty of room. One small complaint, we were in Carousel building way out by the entrance. Great for coming & going but not very close to pools, in resort shopping, restaurants and bus stops. Walk to closest pool was really only 1/2 mile maybe, but the distance made it hard to get off the sofa after a day of theme parks. AC worked GREAT, loved the instant hot water, and plentiful towels. Housekeeping was super late the first day, so we elected to just get clean towels rather than wake the toddler who was sleeping just to have someone make the bed at 4:00 pm. They were there much earlier the next day after a call to find out if we were entitled to room service or not. (we were) we had no problems the rest of our stay. Rooms were really clean when we checked in and all the kitchen items were on great shape, and of pretty good quality for being a time share. We loved this place and would stay here again. We would pick a villa again, it was just as nice as a hotel, maybe even nicer...just in a different way. BUT if I were traveling with small children/ in-laws etc this is really worth it for the extra space.

<Title>“Not impressed at all!”
<Content>The staff did not show that they cared about customer service.They insisted that we pick up the phone hanging in the lobby to dial the number for checking the availability of the room! Thanks for helping! Great customer service! The Disney buses can take up to one hour or 75 minutes to get you to the parks(when they finally arrive for pick-up)! The buses are another issue. It was unreal watching normal healthy people ride the buses for 2 days & switch to riding motorized scooters(because they didn't feel like walking)! These scooters take up 3 seats each on a bus & take an extra 20 minutes to load onto the bus. The buses were loaded with people standing. It was ridiculous.I don't have a problem with disabled people. But, lazy people taking advantage is wrong.This was a poor choice for our Disney vacation. We arrived at 11:30am. The staff kept telling us that the 2 bedroom villa would be ready "soon". Since it is Disney's policy to try to accomodate early arrivals,we thought they were telling the truth.Unfortunately, we kept believing them & wasted an entire day waiting to check-in to our room! We never got into the 2 bedroom villa until 4:30pm & guess what? Our luggage that arrived at 11:30am by Disney's Magical Express was no where to be found.We were very upset. As we took a bus to our dinner reservation, we watched a golf cart go by with our luggage on it. This is not the Disney service that we received when we stayed at other resorts.Therefore, we would never go back.

<Title>“awesome”
<Content>I've been coming to Disney as a DVC member for over 20 years. I've stayed at many of the resorts and hotels and Saratoga Springs is awesome. I just read some of the other reviews and feel I have to write a review for this place because this place is great and deserves all five stars. This is my first time at the Saratoga Springs resort (our home base is Old Key West - which also deserves five stars!) so they may have upgraded since some of the other reviews have been written but there were no problems checking in - they even let us check in at ten in the morning! The condo was very clean, the couch was easy to pull out and put back in, the service was excellent, and if you need new towels all you have to do is call and ask for them. We never had to wait long for a park bus and we stayed in Congress so we were within walking distance to Downtown Disney. Overall, AWESOME experience!

<Title>“NIce Option for long stay”
<Content>We like Saratoga Springs as an option when other, more desirable, Disney locations are booked. I like the new pool area, as that was a drawback before... long walk to the main pool from most buildings. Typical of Disney, there were several household items missing from the kitchen...

<Title>“Family Fun”
<Content>We stayed at Saratoga Springs in August. It was a great place for the family. We had 3 studio's with the mini kitchen. The resort seemed to be in excellent condition--It is very large, We had a room by one of the smaller pools but chose to walk to the main pool because of all the activities for children. I stay at vacation club facilities often, so we all knew we could have some walking to get to the main area for restaurants and shops, etc. We took the free ferry to Down Town Disney, but we also walked one evening....just a few minutes to do that. We also took the free bus back one evening because we were there so late the ferry had shut down. We all loved this vacation resort!!

<Title>“Another Great Stay”
<Content>Stayed for the weekend at Saratoga Springs and it absolutely lived up to my expectations. We are DVC Members and always choose this property. It is a short walk to Downtown Disney, Has an excellent eatery with the best Flatbread pizzas. We always drive and it is a short drive to all the parks (staying there you get a parking permit for all the parks). The Spa is very well equipped with a great workout area. The kids also love the main pool but plenty of other smaller pools throughout the property.

<Title>“A beautiful resort close to everything.”
<Content>This is a great resort! It's has all the Disney perks. Just hop on a bus and you are in the parks! Easy! Plus it has nice pools on the property and is within a short walk to downtown Disney. We stay here often because it's so easy to walk to inexpensive places to eat. We rarely if ever use our car because it's so easy to use Disney transportation. Tip!! Request a room in congress park for the shortest walk to downtown disney. Downside: this resort is huge!! Staying in the treehouses or the grandstand is the farthest away from walking paths and the main house. The springs is the closest to the main house and big pool. The paddock and carousel are in the middle and have their own small water park.

<Title>“Our first time to Disney :) Saratoga Springs”
<Content>Hi everyone!! my family traveled from Ct. to Saratoga Springs for the first time ever 10/22-10/29. We enjoyed our stay had a very stress free check in. Our room was in the Congress section of the resort which is closest to Downtown Disney. The room was definatly in need of some remodoling. The carpet was really worn the bathroom toilet was messed up and the couch was in desperate need of up-date. It was a pull out couch and it was very difficult to pull out and put back. We were so far away from the "main" area that we just called for take out off property because it was cheaper. (Joes pizzarea) very affordable and the food was great!! The transportation was fine we had the longest wait (20 min) to Epcot but other than that it was great!! I did laundry for free just paid 1.00 for detergant the rest was free super awsome!! The kids swam in the pool while laundry was going. Im not going to lie but we did have to snag some towels from the pool house. Our linen service was once for the entire 7 days and with four people in the room it was horrible. We also had two bags of garbage sitting in our room and noone emptied it:( ok enough of the negative I still would stay again it was a first for us so now i know that I need to speak up or stay at a differant resort!! I hope this helped I didnt mean to come over as complaining because Im not Im just trying to be helpfull:)

<Title>“Very nice resort but pricey”
<Content>What I like was that it was quiet and nice to relax, very nice pool, staff was very friendly in general (Disney standard) and the groceries and quick service place (The Artist Palette) was more than fine. What I didn't like was the room view and that sometimes Disney buses took more than 30 min to pass by to certain parks. The room was fine but for almost $350 a night I expected a little more like cable TV, 2 night stands not just one, but nothing serious. The spa was nice but if I knew the massage cost $120 I wouldn't have gone, it's good but not great.

<Title>“Lacking property for a Disney resort”
<Content>I have stayed on property with Disney 10+ times. My recent stay at Saratoga Springs (10/15-10/20) was my second time here (family is DVC member). On the negative side, check-in was mostly a disaster. Had a new employee try to check me in, and while he was very friendly, the process took more than 20 minutes. I felt there should have been a more seasoned employee there to help him. I arrived around 11am and wasn't surprised that my room wasn't ready - but it took 6 hours and about 5 phone calls before the room finally WAS ready. Hard to believe that not a single room opened up in that time frame that they could have gotten me and my family in. ESPECIALLY since this is one of the Disney resorts with a MANDATORY check out time of 11am - no late check outs. Room was very average. This is a Disney resort that is seriously in need of an update/makeover. Carpet is old and worn, our unit smelled like cigarette smoke. We stayed a total of 5 days and only received towel and linen service one time. If you want extra towels, shampoo, etc, you are charged for it. Personally, I feel like for the amount that you are charged to stay and visit Disney, these are minimal ammenities that should be included with any stay. Be aware that this property is VERY spread out - from most of the villas, it is quite a walk to get to the main carriage house or the activity center/gym/pool. I will say that once you get there, the main pool is great - the kids loved it (ages 6 and 9), and the workout center is awesome too. It's huge and pretty stat-of-art. We did use the activity center once when there was a threat of rain - it is also very nice - we played the Wii and ping-pong. Staff here was very friendly. We dd not have any problems with the bus system from Saratoga - never had to wait more than 10 minutes. Overall, Saratoga Springs is average - but would not be my first choice of Disney properties to stay during our next visit.

<Content>This resort is a Disney Vacation Club resort but it can be reserved by non DVC members. The rooms are villa style. Very spacious and clean. The surroundings are very peaceful and beautiful. Lakes and trees create that peaceful feeling. If you want to have a relaxing stay in WDW, this is the place. Great pools but not much entertaiment beyond that.

<Content>We stayed in Paddock area and were very pleased. The pool and bus stop were near by and the walk to the main lobby was easy. We enjoy an early morning walk and this is the perfect place. Very scenic lakes and fountains. It isn't the Grand Floridian but I would certainly recommend this resort.

<Title>“saratoga springs disney resort florida”
<Content>Stayed in a large two bedroom apartment Aug 2011. Walt disney are very flexable to ones needs and try to accommodate where possible. We stayed in the Grandstand and the apartment was excellent. Dishwasher, washing machine,tumble drier, coffee machine and everything was provided to be able to use them. The location of the Saratogo was ideal, you could get the water taxi to downtown disney which was a nice 10 min boat ride away. Stayed at other disney hotels and this has been the best yet. The grounds are lovely and the 3 swimming pools kept clean. Nice meals in the restaurant overlooking the lake. Buses came approx every 20 mins but took 15 mins to get to the other 5 bus stops and out of the resort. The grandstand was first pick up and first drop off so the buses were never full. Would highly recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Another fabulous trip to Saratoga Springs”
<Content>This is our second time Saratoga Springs, and about out 15th trip to Wdw, and it was another fabulous trip, this time however we arrived at the resort on the Magical Express, that was so effortless compared to getting the hire car first at the airport, when we arrived SSR, The bell staff took care of our luggage (we decided to take it with us the same coach which turned out to be great decision) and kept hold of it whilst I went to check in, then they took us in their buggy straight to our room( that was fab ride too) On our booking, we asked for a high floor in Congress Park, but found we had been allocated a ground floor in Grandstand but on checkin they quickly changed it. The room was clean and view of one of the side waterways, but it didn't feel that cool, initially we just thought it hadn't been used for a while and the A/C would kick in, we got on with our vacation, however a day so in it was realised the a/c wasn't working fully it was getting hotter outside and the room was getting hotter too! We rang maintenance, they sent someone out in an hour, but he couldn't fix it and we would need the A/c guy who was at lunch but he would be out soon, so we went out and when we got back, it clearly hadnt been fixed we called again, and got you are next of the list, by the morning I couldn't stand it anymore and went to the front desk, luckily the manager was there so we spoke ton him he called maintenance, heard the tell him we were first in the list, we went out for the day and got back, and yep no cool room, by now I was now angry we had been 5 days in a room in Florida with no A/C... So marched back to reception, this time we were caught by Karen, not sure of her role but she was there to greet and help guests, she initially asked if I was having a magical day, think my reply of a firm no surprised her, I told her the problem all we wanted was A/c.. She asked if anyone had offered a change of room... No I replied.. So now she sets out the change our room and also offered a credit onto the account of $150 for all the inconvenience... She gave us a room with a fabulous view of DTD, large balcony on the 4th floor, and we could see the pool, it was great but more importantly had A/C! Then she realised it was my hubby's birthday on the day of arrival, so she ended up crediting $400 on the account, she was fantastic and the remainder of the vacation was great and our spending money was covered too. The resort itself it fantastic well maintained, the pool was great, clean and plenty of beds to laze about on, yes its a resort is big but we like that as you have enough space and it's not too crowded, We loved the walks around the resort, and also into DTD, you have more choices on getting around from this resort, you can walk into DTD and get a bus to anywhere you want to go. We picked up our hire car the day after arrival from the dolphin, this was effortless and so much more relaxing then picking it up at the airport, we would do this again, though we dropped the car off at the airport rather than use the Magical Express, they pick you up far too early. We would stay here again, despite the small hiccup when we arrived and they more than compensated us for that, it didn't put us off staying here. One thing I wish Disney would sort is wireless internet, not available at many of the resorts and not free where it is.. Come on Disney get to 21st on that please! Can't wait to go again.....

<Title>“Just Like Home 1 Small Problem”
<Content>We stayed for a week in a 1 bedroom villa. We have visited DisneyWorld several times over the years when our kids were young, this being our first time staying on Disney property. We enjoyed the close proximity to Downtown Disney (you can easily walk around the lake to get there), easy access to bus service to the other parks, the spa, The lobby & shop were almost as long a walk as going to Downtown Disney, so not so convenient. There is no restaurant on the grounds, so all of your eating must be done at the Disney parks. The villas provide a kitchette & washer/dryer, so you don't need to worry about runninig out of clean clothes - or if you wanted to eat in occasionally, all the kitchen supplies were there. Considering we were not traveling with kids, we never experienced any disturbances from families that were staying there - very private. I personally didn't care for the mattress on the bed or the pillows - too soft. I woke up every morning with a backache. I wish hotels would realize that some people prefer firm mattresses & pillows. Unfortunately, our first impression of the room was not good, since the previous guests must have left wet, dirty towels laying on the carpet & there was a very bad smell in the room. We left for a bit & when we returned, it seemed that someone had sprayed some deodorizing spray & the smell of that was almost worse than before. We called the desk to complain & they did move us to another room. Considering what you are paying - I think the housekeeping staff should have notified someone that the room should not be used & needed to be aired out. Glad to know that we could be moved elsewhere! Other than that, the hotel staff were very friendly & eager to please & accomodate us & the grounds were picture perfect!

<Title>“a nice resort in the moderate price level”
<Content>I have been to Disney World about 20 times and stayed in many of the resorts. As one of the moderate resorts, this is a nice hotel, but not super deluxe if you are looking for that. We have the Disney vacation club and this is our home resort so we stay here quite often. This time we were in a studio room which was one double bed and sleeper sofa in The Paddock area of the resort. For the two of us, it was really nice. I would think this type of room with 4 adults would be tight, but 2 adults and 2 smaller kids would be ok. My favorite part of the rooms is that the bathroom sink is in an open area and separate from the shower and toilet. Nice for doing my hair and makeup while my husband is in the shower. We like the location in that it is close to the Downtown Disney area, and depending on what building you stay in, you can easily walk over. The resort is very large and spread out, but you can usually get where you need to without too much trouble. For the amount of rooms (and people) here, I think the only thing that needs improvement is the amount of dining options available. It'd be nice to have at least two sit-down dining establishments at the resort. We were also in need of a computer at one point during the trip and there were none for use at the resort. Luckily the concierge was nice enough to assist us (they went way out of their way) but it would have been much easier if we could have dealt with it ourselves. There is wireless in the rooms if you do bring your own laptop though. My suggestion would be to ask for a room in the Congress Park area of the resort so you can walk to Downtown Disney but are still close to the main pool and eating area. If you aren't interested in Downtown, then it really doesn't matter where you stay. Although it is nice to be able to walk over there if you need bus service to another hotel instead of having to hop to a park first, this option is quicker. There is a new pool at The Paddock area which looked cool with a big water slide and a squirt park area for the littler kids. There was also a quick snack/cocktail area with it as well. Looked like fun for the kids!

<Title>“Another Magical Stay...”
<Content>We are Disney Vacation Club Members and our "home" resort (Animal Kingdom) was booked so we took a room at Saratoga Springs. We had a 1 Bedroom villa in The Springs and it was lovely. There were four people (me, husband, 2 kids ages 7 & 9) and we were very comfortable. The full kitchen is so handy and the pull out couch was quite comfy for being a pull out (no annoying bar in your back!) I also really love having a washer & dryer in the unit. There are several pools around the property so the crowds are spread out (very nice). The counter service restaurant was convenient, the cast members were friendly and check-in was a breeze. All in all, it's a very nice place to stay. It's not as "magical" as some of the other resorts but it's very, very nice.

<Title>“Beautiful resort.”
<Content>I have stay at over 10 different Disney resorts and this one was right on par with the other resorts of this level. Room was clean and equipped as expected. Had heard complaints about Bus service to the theme parks but the longest wait for a bus was less then 10 min (Disney suggests that wait times could be up to 20 minutes). The ride to the parks were never more than 15 mins. Lots of resort activities to keep kids busy without having to visit theme parks. 2 of the pools have water sides and all have spa's. I loved watching the movies under the stars.

<Title>“Amazing Resort”
<Content>We have an RCI timeshare so we traded into this resort for a week. With the timeshare we don't have a lot of choices and this was the only available 2 bedroom during the timeframe we wanted. We weren't sure what to expect. We have no complaints with the hotel. The room was clean, our socks didn't turn black and most of the staff was very friendly and helpful. The pools were never crowded and my kids loved the slides and water features. We could have walked to downtown Disney but took the bus instead. We ate at both the restaurants in the main building. The food is only okay and the service in the Turf Club is horrible. The grounds are beautiful and the wait for the buses was minimal with only a couple of exceptions. My husband really wants to stay at one of the properties in Animal Kingdom next time, but if we can't get that, then this will be our next choice.

<Title>“Marvelous can't fault”
<Content>We had a two bedroom villa which was second to none. The maid was in every morning doing wonder full shapes with the towels to put a smile on your face after a long day. Brill location although we had a car which made things easier would not of liked to use there buses they looked very busy. Really friendly and courteous staff could not do enough to help you. Easy walking distance to Downtown Disney and nice boat back. One thing the mattress are far too soft but that's my own personnel choice. Would reccomend

<Title>“Amazing experience for first Disney trip”
<Content>My husband and I took our three kids (10, 5, and 3) and their nanny to WDW in April for the first time. It was my first trip, as well, so I didn't quite know what to expect. From the moment we arrived on the property, the cast members at the Saratoga well exceeded my expectations. Everyone was so kind and eager to provide answers to all of my questions. There is a cafe in the main building that offered breakfast, lunch and dinner. There were snacks and a wide range of beverages, as well. Of course there were toys and souvenirs, as well. The room was a short walk from the main building, which was okay with me as it kept us separated from the majority of the noise. We were able to park our vehicle very close to the building in which our suite was located which made those impromptu trips to Walmart a bit more convenient. I can't say enough about our room! It was so nice and clean and spacious. I had read other reviews about this hotel that reported the rooms weren't clean, but our's was impeccable. The kitchen was well-stocked with dishes and flatware. The beds were all very comfortable even though they had no fluffy duvets. There was ample seating in the living area. The balcony was small and the door leading out to it didn't have a bolt lock so there was a little concern about safety since our kids are young and very curious. The only negative I can think of for this resort is the wait for the buses to the resorts. Most days we had to wait over 30 minutes for one of the buses to arrive. There was a covered wait area with a soda machine, which helped improve the situation a bit. Oh! The pools were nice but.we only went to the smaller one that was closer to our building. It was crowded without much seating. The hotel was filled to capacity, though, so I can't really blame the property for that. I would and have recommended this hotel to family and friends. It's a great place for larger families who want to be away from the chaos of the parks.

<Content>if you ever get the oportunity to go to disney world, i would totally recomend saratoga springs. as you walk in you are greeted by bell boys who take your luggage of you and you recieve it up at your room. throughout my stay i had excelent service and it is well worth the money. i went there for my tenth trip for the summer this year and i will be re-visiting it over and over again.

<Title>“"Disney lost the magic at Saratoga Springs"”
<Content>I have visited Disney World and stayed on property 5-6 times now, the latest was 9/30/2011. However this hotel was aweful compared to any other place we have stayed in Disney and frankly one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed. From check in with stressed and less than friendly front desk staff to arriving in our room to find the kids beds not made. We called the housekeeping who told us that "there are sheets in the closet and we should make the bed ourselves!", no kidding. So my wife didn't complain and grabbed the sheets to make the bed only to find there were dried "BUGS" in the sheets. We called again to get fresh sheets and they did come make the bed. The next morning we woke up to realize we had no toilet paper. I did go to the front desk and when I said i was not happy with the way we were treated and unhappy with the hotel itself the manager handed me the house phone and told me I could call disney guest services to inquire about staying somewhere else, he didn't even ask why i wasn't happy or if there was anything he could do. The room was worn and not very clean. They didn't even clean it the day before check out so we had no clean towels. It was just horrendous. I have never written a comment here before and am not that picky but this was just over the top bad and it was obvious that this was the norm. There are plenty of nicer hotels in the area and will only stay at a Non Disney resort next time. I feel bad having to give such a bad review, but this is honest and hope someone can get something from this.

<Title>“Very nice hotel, good location, a little secluded”
<Content>I have been to Disney about 20 times in the last 25 years, and have stayed in just about every type of room that Disney has to offer: value, moderate, and deluxe resorts, as well as studio, 2-bedroom, and 3-bedroom Vacation Club villas. Hopefully this review is a fair assessment of this resort versus the many others that are available to choose from. This was my first stay at Saratoga Springs, and it was in a 2-bedroom villa with my parents, sister and brother-in-law, and boyfriend. Overall the villa felt more than roomy enough for the 6 of us – the bedroom that my boyfriend and I shared with my sister and brother-in-law had 2 queen beds that were pretty comfortable, and there was enough drawer and closet space for all of us. We also had our own connected bathroom with shower to share, and a sink area with 2 sinks. We did have some issues with our toilet, as we found it was leaking during our stay. Maintenance came by to check it out, but I don’t think it was ever really fixed. However, it didn’t make it impossible to use the bathroom so it wasn’t that big of a deal. My parents had a room that connected to a bathroom with a large standing shower and bathtub, as well as 2 sinks. The toilet was in its own room so that it could be accessed from the main living area, and had a sink as well I think. There was laundry as well, which was really nice to have. The kitchenette and living area were both a very good size, including a dining area that easily sat 4-6 people, and we had a nice balcony looking out over the property. Keep in mind when you stay in a Vacation Club villa that you only get maid service once every (I think) 4 days, not every day. As for the resort, I can’t say that I saw very much of it. It was December, and unseasonably cold at that (it was in the 30’s at night!), so we didn’t visit the pool. However, from where we were (in the back of the resort), there was a lot of construction going on as they added a second pool to the property, which would have been closer to us than the pool near the Clubhouse. We were VERY far away from the Clubhouse, and on top of that, our bus stop was closed for the pool construction, so if we took the bus, we had to walk quite a way to get to the next closest stop. We are able-bodied and it wasn’t blazing hot or anything, so it was fine for us, but it’s a big enough resort that it shouldn’t have really been necessary either. I imagine they could have found a way to safely load passengers somewhere closer to us. I imagine with the inconvenience of pool construction being done, it’s probably better now. I never really visited the lobby either, as my parents checked in for us before the “kids” arrived on a separate flight, and it was too far to walk when we had free time. My sister has Celiac disease, so most of our eating was done elsewhere within Disney World; I don’t think Saratoga Springs was able to accommodate her sensitive diet other than with salads, so it was our preference to eat elsewhere instead. This resort also has a spa on-site which I have heard good things about, but have not visited myself. As for the overall location of the resort, it’s pretty good. It’s close to the Downtown Disney area, where there is a lot of shopping and eating. It’s probably walkable to Downtown Disney from the front of the resort, but we always drove or took the bus. If you’re a golfer, this is probably one of the best places you can stay, since your proximity to the golf courses is great (it basically sits almost on top of one of the courses). You’re not super-close to any of the theme parks, but they are all a reasonable driving distance from the resort. I wish I could offer more information about this resort, but it was a short trip for me and I didn’t spend as much time exploring and enjoying the resort as I normally would have. The resort is themed on Saratoga, NY with a horse-racing theme throughout, and is done in a very classy way without being too over-the-top. Overall, the grounds are lovely and the rooms are spacious and clean (the resort is also on the newer side compared to other Disney resorts). I’m not sure that I’d choose it again because I prefer to be a little less secluded than I felt here when I visit Disney World, but I think it’s still a great hotel worthy of 4 stars for what you get. I took a star away because the resort is so big and sprawling that you feel disconnected from the main hub of the Clubhouse if you aren’t staying close to it.

<Title>“Disney does it again!”
<Content>If you ever have the chance to stay at any of the resorts on the Disney property I would say try your best, from the Welcome Home! to the everyday service you get it just makes your stay worth the extra you pay. The closeness to the parks, how easy it is to get back and forth to the fun just doing things on the resort property itself. No mater where you stay you are welcomed on any of the properties like you are a special guest in the Shops the Restaurants ect. Get out there find the deals and stay on the property you will thank yourself later, we sure did! Have a Magical Day at Disney!!

<Title>“Terrific Stay”
<Content>We had a terrific stay at this Disney resort. The room was beautiful and spacious. The kitchen and laundry area was so valuable even for our 4 day trip. There were two bathrooms, one with a whirpool tub and one with a shower. We stayed in the Grandstand area. The property is very large and some of the rooms are a hike from the on property restaurant and shop. I would recommend this hotel unless you have walking issues.

<Title>“Very Average”
<Content>We were excited about our first trip to Disney and stayed here. We had no idea one of the largest pool was closed for updates and the closest bus stop to us was shut down as well. Wish we had known these facts having a 2 and 4 year old with us. Keep in mind, this resort is one of the FURTHEST away from The Magic Kingdom. The bus stops were packed first thing in the morning. Honestly, people were almost pushing to get on the bus. They should have had more buses on hand. Not very impressed - ( for the money we spent !)

<Title>“A little disappointed”
<Content>We have used this resort around five times and this trip was for our daughters wedding at WDW. We had taken four rooms and had made specific requests many months in advance, whilst we do appreciate requests cannot be garaunteed it was a little disappointing to arrive and find that virtually none had been considered, especially when the trip was for a wedding that Disney were organising. I feel that whilst Disney are pretty much top notch there is just something missing, perhaps a lack of communication between departments, maybe they are just too big. Resort has a great location for walking to Downtown Disney and IF you get an apartment with good Downtown Disney views that just makes it perfect.

<Title>“Lovely hotel if you don't mind odd phone calls all during the night.”
<Content>We spent a week in a Saratoga springs two bedroom villa. It was beautiful, spacious, very clean, luxurious even. My family felt spoiled, we absolutely loved it We're already planning our trip for next year and hope to stay at The Springs once again. If I had a complaint, it would be that we received several odd phone calls during the night, while we were trying to sleep. When the calls were answered, we would hear something that sounded like a fax being received. It happened on at least 5 different occasions, until my husband finally just took the phone off the hook, so we could get some sleep. It was very annoying, to say the least.

<Title>“Great palce to stay”
<Content>I stayed here at the end of august with my husband and 2 young children. We have stayed at many Disney properties before including The Yacht club and the Wilderness Lodge. We loved this property. We stayed in the Paddock area right next to the new paddock pool which was great for young children as it isn't very deep at all so we could relax whilst the children played. It was about a 10 minute walk (but a lovely walk) to the main complex across a long bridge. The whole feel of the complex is very relaxed and our studio room was fine for the 4 of us with a queen bed and a sofa bed for the children. The rooms were cleaned daily to a good standard. Downtown Disney was about a 15 minute walk from our room or you can catch the bus or boat. The only negative i can think of is the Counter service in the restaurant was limited. Not much choice other than sandwiches. We loved this hotel and would definately stay again.

<Title>“Its not for everyone, but we loved it!”
<Content>We stayed in The Springs complex room 3210 which is a two bedroom villa, and we thought it was perfect. It was close to the amenities but not right on top of them. Our villa overlooked a lake even though we hadn't paid for the privilage. In the villa there are two bedrooms either side of a kitchen and living room area. My fiance and I had a queen sized bed with a jacuzzi bath, separate shower and toilet. My parents had the other bedroom with two beds and their own bathroom. We had maid service everyday. If you are in the disney vacation club you have to pay for this service, but as we were ordinary guests we didn't have to pay. We received loads of free toiletries everyday (which cost about $15 in the shop). Check-in was a breeze like normal at a Disney resort. We've been very lucky to try quite a few Disney properties, and we all agreed Saratoga Springs was one of the best. We we're very happy with the service at the hotel, the one let down is that the food court area is not quite big enough for the busy summer season. We still always managed to get a table, but sometimes the queue for breakfast could be quite long.

<Title>“Good location, needs updating”
<Content>We stayed at Saratoga Springs for one night before our Disney Cruise. Our check-in process was quick, but incorrect. We had two rooms booked under one reservation and were told one was ready and the other one would be ready in a few minutes. After several hours and a phone call, it was finally ready. We were told it would be next to our room, but in fact was at the opposite end of the building. The studios were very dated and need to have an update. We felt this resort was too big and everything was a long walk away. Our family has stayed in almost all of the deluxe/deluxe villa resorts at Disney and this resort doesn't compare to the others. We wouldn't choose this resort again.

<Title>“An Okay Disney Property”
<Content>My in-laws are vacation club members and we were able to reserve 3 rooms in the off-season. 2 of the rooms were connected on one floor and then another was separate. The rooms are okay. They have a small kitchenette that is useful in saving money...if you haven't purchased the meal plan. If you have, then you'll never need it because the food plan is plenty of food. Our stay was in between Thanksgiving and Christmas. They were doing renovations and we ended up parking quite a bit away from our building, which was a pain. While the resort is pretty, it's incredibly spread out, which makes going to the front desk, the restaurants and the pool more of a challenge than a convenience. The buses are almost never in the 20 min. time periods they promise. We waited over 40 mins on several occassions. Luckily we didn't take the bus much this trip. On a previous trip we stayed a week without a car and promised never to make that mistake again. This time, we were with our extended family and when we didn't want to wait for them to move parks, we took the transit. I would never recommend this for a family with small children who would not do well waiting at a crowded bus stop in the heat for 20-40 min. Overall the property is okay. I much prefer Wilderness Lodge. I haven't stayed at other moderate resorts and have nothing to compare this to, The room was fine, with the exception of the carpet which could have used a scrubbing. If you have the meal plan, I would recommend another property because you wouldn't need the kitchenette. It's not bad, it's just not ideal or the Disney experience we've had in the past.

<Title>“Simply, Hated It”
<Content>Before we left I knew we weren't at no Ritz Carlton, first off we knew we wanted a 2 bedroom ( we have a family of five) so immediately we wanted to stay at the Bay Lake Towers which ofcourse Our luck is completely booked, so our next choice was the Grand Floridian We have stayed there twice before and absolutely loved it. But it doesn't offer a 2 bedroom our only option was OKW and Saratoga. We picked Saratoga because of it's proximity to downtown Disney. First off I'd like to point out it is NOT that close to Downtown at all. The rooms where spacious but out dated (again wishing we where at the BLT) and the walk to breakfast, the pool, the other restaurant, and the lobby, was Half an Hour!!! Poorly engineered in my opinion!!! Pool was disgusting, slide was boring, food sucked, only 2 restaurants. OH and guess what? No palm trees!!! We are in Florida and there are no palm trees!!!! Parking lots everywhere few busses terrible area, bathroom where nice. Ugly design, terrible theme, DON'T STAY HERE!!!!!!

<Title>“Great Room, Great scenery, BUT...”
<Content>As far as Disney properties go, this is exactly what you would expect, WONDERFUL. It was very clean, we were able to sleep 7 people just fine. With the little kitchen it was a great way to save money on food. That being said, we did have an issue with the bus to the parks. They were very few between and often crowded both coming and going. But they did have a lot of other activities to do, such as rent bikes. Also, the people at the food court were great! There was a cast member cleaning tables, but preforming magic as he did, he gave my family many wonderful memories!

<Title>“Authentic theming, very nice rooms, beautiful landscaping”
<Content>We've stayed at this property numerous times. It lives up to Disney's quality. The rooms are villas - they have studios, 1BR, 2BR, and 3BR grand villas. This trip was just the 2 of us and we stayed in a studio, which still offers more space and amenities than a standard hotel room. Counter surfaces are granite and the couch pulls open to bed if needed. The grounds' upkeep is stupendous. It's an absolutely beautiful resort. Going on morning runs around the spring/lake, it's probably the most serene of all the WDW resort paths. The buildings are subdued, pastel shades, the grass is always green and manicured, the water is always clean with fountains everywhere, and trash on the ground is never seen. The resort is spread out, and the rooms all have their entrances on the outside, unlike a traditional hotel building. Some like that, some don't. If you have a car, it allows you to park closer to your room. You can walk, take a bus, or board a water shuttle to Downtown Disney and West side - a mecca of restauarants, shops, and entertainment. You can't walk to any of the theme parks from this resort, so if that's important, other on-property resorts might be a better choice. But being located somewhat in the middle of all of WDW, it's not truly far from anywhere. We golfed at the Lake Buena Vista course on this trip; the clubhouse is located right there, thus no traveling. Disney is great with their golf, offering complimentary cab rides, club transportation, club storage, etc. The on-property food options are very good. The Turf Club has always been excellent on our visits - lunch, dinner, and drinks, Artist's Palette is good for quick food (and not all standard fare), and the pool bars sometimes offer a few snacks in addition to drinks. When we were last there, we stayed in the Paddock section during construction of the new pool/play/snack area, so unfortunately that pool was closed, plus the adjoining laundry facilities and the bus stop. It was inconvenient but the resort was full so we couldn't move. All that is now open and the area looks beautiful, making it a desirable location at the SSR.

<Content>We bought a time share @ Disney's Saratoga Springs after vacationing there more than 5 years ago. EVERY time I enter through the gates I breathe a happy sigh b/c I DO feel like I am home. (You got through the gate and they always say "Welcome Home"). The staff at the resort is incredible. I have met some of the most accommodating folks, who do go out of their way to make your stay as "magical" as possible. I like the location of the resort to other things than just ALL Disney. Grocery stores, pharmacies, an outlet mall, regular restaurants, all withing a 3 - 4 mile radius. Its a very sfe resort best I can tell - feel very safe there and always clean. TOns to do at this resort in addition to the big house of mouse! I highly recommend.

<Title>“Another perfect Disney Holiday”
<Content>Stayed here in August 2011 with family and friends in a one bedroom villa. Have previously stayed at AKL and Yacht Club but with a growing family we decided we needed more space and this was perfect accommodation. We had requested prior to arrival i room in the Grandstand or Springs as we had read reviews on location of pools and lobby. They did have us in the Grandstand section but right at the end of the complex and faraway from the pools. I refused room and we were allocated a room in the paddock area a stride away from the new pool and perfect location and walk to lobby - but have to say it was the worse check in ever and it took nearly an hour to sort everything out. We have stayed at Disney 5 times and have never experienced this. The rooms were ample big enough and were cleaned everyday even put the dishwasher on and left me soap powder ! - very clean and were left plenty of towels everyday. The service aroung the Paddock pool bar was very slow but when it was ready was ok and the food at the Artist Pallet was ok. All in all I would definately stay here again, location was good especially for DTD and for a growing family the rooms were perfect.

<Title>“Great resort”
<Content>Would highly recommend the Saratoga Springs for larger famillies. We had the 2-bedroom apartment which was very spacious. Try to request a room nr the GrandStand as you are then close to the reception & restaurants as well as main pool (all within 5/6 mins walk) but also have your own smaller pool right outside apartments plus the bus stop (1st stop so will always get a seat) is just 2/3 minute walk away. We were on the deluxe meal plan which I cannot recommend highly enough, we choose to eat a few mornings for convenience at the Artists Palette but have to say it was awful & not relaxing at all, it is self service & a little chaotic however with the deluxe plan you can book yourself at any of the Disney hotels sit down restaurants for breakfast - these were wonderful ! Worth a mention are Jiko restaurant at Animal Kingdom Lodge, Citricos at Grand Floridian, California Grill at Contemporary (watch fireworks from here) & Artist Point at Wilderness Lodge - all offered truly superb dining in lovely settings (excellent wine lists also) Have been to other Disney hotels before but think that the Saratoga Springs is my favorite, I like the landscaping & the space within the resort plus rooms are excellent only downside is that is does'nt have a fine-dining restaurant but is is so easy to use the transportation to get to other hotels that this was really not that big a deal although be aware that it can take up to an hour to get from hotel to hotel as most of the time, you need to catch a bus to the parks & then another bus/boat back out to the resort hotels.

<Title>“Fabulous +++”
<Content>This was our second stay and it was great. We had four adults and two children. The rooms were large and the kitchen was fully stocked. The bus picked us up at the door and took us to Disney World. The children enjoyed the large pool with life guards at all times. The staff was fabulous from check in, to check out. The apartment and common areas were well kept. The convenience to Disney World was great and we went frequently but you could stay on Saratoga Springs property and have a wonderful time. Disney really knows how to cater to families.

<Title>“Very dissapointing”
<Content>We are DVC members, and frequent travelers to Walt DIsney World. We have stayed at virtually every Disney Resort, from Budget to Deluxe, and typically find them exceptional. This time was not so. Traveling with kids ranging from 17 down to 7, we always request being near the transportation and pool, entertainment area, and Disney's cast members have always accomodated. At Saratoga Springs however, we could not have been put further away from everything. Magnifying this, the area where we were staying (The Paddocks) was undergoing construction (The pool area, not the villa), causing the parking lot and the closest bus stop to be closed. The final aggravation was that the young lady who checked us in gave us our room keys and welcome packakge, but with no room number, so after we drove to the villa, had to call the Resort to find out our room number. She also provided terrible directions to the villa, causing us to walk what seemed like miles (realistically probably 300 yards or so) carrying our luggage. Had we realized how far it was, we definitely would have used the available Bell Services. The final insult was that she told us our room was on the 5th floor, so AFTER carrying the luggage up 5 flights, got to carry it back down to the first floor. Of course the next day we discovered the ELEVATOR, which would have been helpful information had wwe actually reallu needed it. I will say, the Manager on duty that night did everything she could to make it up to us, including buying us dinner after our 90 mintute check in experience, and the room was typical of a DIsney Deluxe Villa, clean, comfortable and well equipped, but the location was an ordeal the entire stay. I would not stay there again, especially when compared to the other Disney Deluxe Resorts.

<Title>“Try the Treehouse Villas at Saratoga Springs”
<Content>For those of you who are DVC members or who otherwise visit Disney World on a regular basis, try the Treehouse Villas at Saratoga Springs for a change of pace. The Villas are - not surprisingly - faux treehouses set ten or so feet off the ground in a wooded area adjacent to the balance of Saratoga Springs. You feel remote - almost as if you're camping - but you're only a short bus ride away from the center of the resort and all its attendant amenities. The villas themselves are single-story structures that are accessed by a wooden stairs; this is not a great location for those who have certain mobility issues. The units are roughly circular, with cathedral ceilings, an open kitchen/dining room/living room area, three bedrooms (one with bunk beds) and two baths. Everything is executed well, and the rustic outdoor theme prevails throughout. My kids loved how spacious and secluded the treehouses felt. There are some downsides. The pool is very small, but nice, and there is no direct-to-parks bus service from the villas - you first need to get to the main Saratoga Springs resort by bus or boat. The boat also stops at Downtown Disney, which is convenient. In sum, the villas themselves are great, and its relative isolation is both a benefit and a downfall - it seems like you're tucked away in the woods, but if you want a quick bite to eat at a restaurant, or a trip to one of the parks, you're in for a bit of a hike and some delay.

<Title>“Disney Treehouses are Great!!”
<Content>This was the second year in a row we have stayed at the Disney Treehouses and we already have our reservations for next June. They are in a woodsy area with their own pool, and within a 5 minute walk to the main pool. There is a boat dock to get to Downtown Disney. The Treehouses have 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, kitchen, living room and an outside deck with table and chairs. We barbaqued a couple of nights and can make meals in the kitchen to save money. It is a great time. We pack our friends and family in, people come and go when then want so we are always having a variety of people visiting. Highly recommend them.

<Title>“Pleasant Stay”
<Content>We had traded our timeshare this year for a week at Saratoga Springs Resort. Since I was a little late in getting on the ball, we ended up with a 1 bedroom. It's a cozy unit. The bedroom is good size with King size bed, and the bathroom is split into 2 rooms; closet with sink and jacuzzi bathtub, then a separate door to a sink, shower, and toilet, so that was fairly convenient. The kitchen is small, two people cannot fit in there without bumping into each other. It is "almost" fully equipped, would've been nice to have a frying pan :-) Built in laundry facility is why I love staying at condos! My biggest complaint was the sofabed in the living room was sagging, it wasn't comfortable to even sit in it to watch TV. All in all, the resort is nice, it has 2 pools that the kids will enjoy, and all the Disney amenities. Disney busses run all the time, and it's right next door to Downtown Disney.

<Title>“Nice place, great for families.”
<Content>I used Hilton points to stay here and its a very nice place. A few minor issues but overall a great location if you are doing more than just Disney parks. the kitchen is always helpful even if just for the morning. Its great having breakfast on your own schedule. the staff are friendly and the pools are great. A ten minute walk or boat ride to Downtown Disney depending on where you stay on the property - is HUGE. Recommend for families with young kids as there is plenty to do and see without leaving the resort.

<Title>“Clean, but smaller than the other resorts”
<Content>We just returned from a lovely weekend with friends at Disney's Saratoga Springs. This is the second time we have visited the resort and had a wonderful time. Saratoga is a great resort because Downtown Disney it literally minutes whether you walk, take a boat, or drive. We stayed in the Grand Villa which sleeps 12, six were in our party. Accomodations were exceptional, amenities were abundant. Saratoga seems as though the living space is smaller because it does not have an "open" design as other Grand Villas at Disney. One negative observation is that balcony located at Saratoga is small and only accomodates two people- In similar Grand Villas on Disney property such as Jambo House Animal Kingdom, or Key West Resort, balconies have a family size table and chairs, so sitting outside to play cards or to observe safari animals or golf games is one delightful advantage. The resort, though was Disney "clean" and staff were exceedingly friendly. I would definitely stay again.

<Content>This was my 3rd stay at this hotel. It was simply wonderful. The people were vey helpful and the rooms are clean and bright. The kitchen facilities are excellent (even if i do not cook). The bathrooms are very clean, since this is a timeshare they do not replenish the towels every day. I love this hotel!

<Title>“It was fab definetely be back”
<Content>Just returned from a two stay at the Saratogo springs and it was great. We stopped in a studio which was big enough for two adults and a 10yr old. We stopped in the Paddocks and were very close to the pool, the bus stop for the disney transport and only 15min walk from Marketplace at Downtown Disney. Our package included the disney dining plan which we found fantastic. We used our entitlement to attend a dinnershow, have a character breakfast and to eat at the Hollywood Brown Derby at Hollywood studios. All of which were a great experience!!! Can't wait to go back.Ps the housekeeping was very good even left us towel art including a swan and elephant.

<Title>“Quiet yet fun for all ages”
<Content>We are Disney Vacation Club members and chose Saratoga as our home resort. We have only 4 ppl in our family and we chose to stay in the studio. It is quite small when the pull out sofa is in use. The Sofa was very uncomfortable and we will be sure to use more points and upgrade to a 2 bedroom next time around for the 2 beds. The little kitchenette area was very nice. It has a sink, coffee maker, microwave and mini refrigerator. The pros are: 1.Quiet Rooms 2. Awesome pools for kids, the new pool is the best one, 3-Convenient parking, 4-Clean (except the carpet was very dirty when not wearing shoes), 5-Awesome Community Center for the kids. 6-Great events all day and night for the kids/family, 7-Walking distance to Downtown Disney, 8-The sit down dining restaurant has excellent food but pricey Cons: 1. The Artist's Palette quick dining has a limited lunch & dinner menu. 2. Not all buildings have washers & dryers if using a Studio. 3. Room cleaning service is not daily if you are a DVC member.

<Title>“let the memories begin!! Yep invite the roaches!”
<Content>Stayed at Saratogo springs on numerous occasions but I think this will be our last visit here. Moved rooms twice, once due to roaches and once due to furniture falling to pieces, unsafe for a toddler, yep we know we're in Florida and expect bugs but not in our room!!! All rooms we were allocated needed a right good old clean although we only had the roaches in one! The staff here need to get a "bit of magic" injected into them we were at Disney for goodness sake, the most unfriendliest staff we have ever encountered at any hotel - not just Disney. We kept seeing Ratatoullie scurring around at night in various locations, never seen him here before only at Chef de France at Epcot!!! If you are thinking of taking a Disney holiday I would definetly suggest another resort or stay off site!!

<Title>“Wish we could go back next year!”
<Content>We stayed at Congress Park form the 7th to the 21st August and had an absolutely awesome time! We have stayed in Pop Century,Riverside, Carribean Beach and Polynesian, all of which were great but Saratoga Springs was my favourite. The rooms were clean and spacious, the buses were frequent and the walk to The Springs in the morning for our coffee and Downtown Disney for an Earl of Sandwich were quick and pleasant. We were gutted when our holiday was over and have been pining for The Saratoga Springs ever since our return two weeks ago - if only we could find some pennies to return next year! I have to agree with some other reviews though that the food in the artists pallette wasn't as good as the quick service options offered in the other Disney hotels we've stayed at, but as we only really to ate there twice, once when we arrived and once when a huge storm stopped us going anywhere else, it didn't spoil our stay one bit! So if anyone would like to offer us a free two week stay next year please get in touch! A fantastic resort, well done Disney!

<Title>“Very Nice”
<Content>Stayed here just last week , Disney does it great for the kids ! Plenty of daily activities throughout most of the day, game room , spa for the parents and kids to! multiple pools and water slides. bike rentals , art room. We stayed in 4635 (bus stop right outside) in the Paddock one building over from the pool (open till midnight slides close at 8pm lifeguards till then) They do movies after dark for the kids theres places to eat and some shopping on site. we had a 2bedroom unit on the second floor. It was quant rooms were good size though I thought the living ,dining and kitchen could have been larger. You had to pay per day for internet access unless you were a member of there vacation club. They provided free trransportation to all the parks and downtown disney.

<Content>We got 'stuck' in Florida due to hurricane Irene and were happy that Disney could accommodate us so fast. We are DVC members, so obviously that makes us big Disney fans! The only disappointment I have with all the Disney resorts is that the old fashioned bedspread look is really dated - time for an upgrade?

<Title>“Great time, but Disney needs to do some updating here.”
<Content>We stayed at Saratoga springs (1 bedroom villa) with our children over spring break. We picked the location because we were here for 2 nights before embarking on a Disney Cruise and weren't planning to hit the Disney Parks. It's proximity to Downtown Disney (walking distance) is great! The staff was friendly, pools were great, and there were plenty of activities to keep us busy for the two days we were there. Saratoga Springs failed in a couple areas though: 1) The room as really run down. It was clean, but in desperate need of renovation. We were shocked that Disney would let it get this bad, and for $600 a night, we were really disappointed. The carpet and bathroom tile were visibly worn and stained. The closets had a mildew smell in them and the kitchenette was really dated and dingy. 2) There was no place to get food nearby and no room service. The only quick restaurant was a counter service place and we had to walk quite far to get there. Managing trays for 4 children was not easy! We ended up walking to DTD for all of our meals because the shuttle service took a really long time too. Overall, we had a great trip and we would go back if they did some renovations here!

<Title>“Wonderful Resort”
<Content>This was our first stay at Saratoga Springs. Our previous visits we would stay at the Coronado. With our children getting older, my wife and I thought that this might be our last visit to Disney and even though we had a great time at the Coronado, we wanted to stay at one of the Villa's Disney had to offer. From the time we arrived at the hotel and walked into the hotel lobby, we knew we made the correct decision. Everything I read or saw in their brochures makes this resort the perfect place for a family vacation. If you do decide to stay the Saratoga, have dinner at the Turf Club located inside the hotel. The food was great and the customer service was unbeatable. If someone in your family plays golf, you have the Lake Buena Vista Golf Course located within walking distance of the hotel. Try and play before 11. You will get a discounted rate for a championship course. The two swimming pools we went to, the High Rock Spring and Paddock are both fun for the children and relaxing for the parents. At night, the High Rock shows an outdoor movie at 9:00. Finally, Saratoga's housekeepers did a fantastic job everyday cleaning our room. On our way home, my wife and I were discussing our 2012 vacation plans and where would we go. We talked about maybe the East Coast or possibly returning to the Panhandle in Fla. However, if the children do decide they would like to return to Disney, I would reserve another one bedroom suite at the Saratoga Springs Resort Thank you Disney!

<Title>“Good location next to Downtown Disney”
<Content>Spent 6 days and 5 nights at Disney's Saratoga Springs with my husband and 3 daughters (ages 7 - 18) during our recent summer vacation. We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa through the Disney Vacation Club (Disney's version of a timeshare). We only visited the parks on one day so spent a considerable amount of time at the resort and using its amenities. I thought the resort was located in a great spot...right across from Downtown Disney. Our room had a fabulous view of Downtown Disney (right across from the hot air balloon). One evening we simply took a walk over to downtown and then got on a ferry to take us to Wolfgang Puck for dinner. There was so much entertainment for us as a family and to please all ages. You can be amazed by magic tricks at Magic Masters or fascinated by the "live" statues a little further down. You can try your hand at making race cars at the lego store or you can be amazed by juggling acts near Ghirardelli. There are outdoor musicians in the bandstand areas and other acts elsewhere. The shopping is fun, the food choices are plentiful and diverse, and the outdoor entertainment is free! You can also go to the movies, see Cirque de Soleil or try the indoor amusement center. The Saratoga Springs resort itself boasts a lovely pool, a circular slide, a zero entry pool on one side and a kiddie play area on the other. Their fitness center was large with a good amount of machines and fitness equipment. I went every day trying to stay in shape. The theme of the hotel evokes Saratoga Springs around the turn of the century. I happen to like this theme but thought that Disney did a better job of theming at the other resorts. The resort is one of Disney's largest with lovely grounds and "springs", but oddly the hotel lobby seemed small and not as well designed compared to other numerous resorts. The Artist's Palette convenience store off the lobby is nicely done and the kids can draw on tabletop easels. They had fun with that (even the older ones). I was a little disappointed with the room as well. The pull-out couch was busted, the drawer in the armoire was banged shut and the sliding door was impossible to open. I called maintenance to repair these things right away but I was annoyed anyway. The room doors open into an open air hallway. I wasn't crazy about that nor was I pleased with the garbage in the hallway, as well. The room was missing some of the shampoos and amenities when we arrived and I had to call for that as well. When I called the manager he was very responsive. Saratoga Springs is also a preview center for the Disney Vacation Club. Even though we are already members we enjoyed a complimentary luncheon afterward and a meet and greet session with Mickey and Goofy. My seven year old was thrilled:) Even though it was a very nice resort, I will probably choose another Disney Resort over Saratoga Springs the next time we go to Orlando.

<Title>“Great Experience for me and my boys!!”
<Content>I did an exchange through RCI from my Aruba timeshare. First time staying at this resort. Look, there shouldn't be complaints about how far thiings are to walk.. Yes it's a huge complex, so many units, subdivided, BUT when you book a trip to Disney did you plan on not walking all over the theme parks? You can do food shopping outside of the resort about 4 to 5 miles away in town where they have lots of well known restaurants, reasonable and a Win Dixie for shopping. You need either a car or take a taxi for that which is outside of Disney. A nice staff member one night helped me and my boys with groceries and took us in the golf cart to our unit door. I tipped him $5.. The buses ran every 15 minutes, and our villa was gorgeous, we had a two bedroom suite, fully equipped. I would take walks or runs in the moring around the grounds which had many paths, and the resort is beautifully landscapped. It is right next to Downtown Disney. We were out the door early every morning for the parks, and back to the resort for the pool. I felt extremely comfortable being a single mom on the resort grounds, and traveling around with the buses with my kids.. Concierge always available, and the funny thing is family members who stayed at the Beach Club complained how packed the lobby was and how long it took to get help from the concierge.. Never assume anything.. We went Aug 20th-27th 2011... I recommend it. PS.. there is Bell Services for arrival and departure. And yes the bus has to stop at like 6 different stops within the compound for your complex, but then again, its about patience. You are on vacay.

<Title>“Even better 2nd time”
<Content>Our family of 4 made a return visit at the beginning of this month for 12 nights in a 2 bed apartment. I chose an apartment in The Paddock are which, for us, was a 10 minute walk to Downtown Disney. We like the amount of space we get in the apartment and good to relax on a return from a hot day at the parks. Icing on the cake was that they have totally re-vamped the Paddock pool to make it more fun and has food. Daughter twice won the 'horse' race to be first down the slide in the morning! We didn't eat at the Turf Club but did at the Artists Pallette and Paddock pool bar, which were fine, just what we wanted at the time. We always have a car so travel to parks is quick and easy. We were on the DDP as well and went to a variety of different hotels to eat but we all agreed that Saratoga Springs is our first choice to stay. OOH when can I return?!

<Title>“Great Stay at Saratoga Springs”
<Content>My family of 6 (me, husband, 9 year old son, 11 year old nephew, sister, and mother) stayed at Saratoga Springs August 14 - 21, 2011. Our 2 bedroom villa was located in Congress Park close to the bus stop. However, we rented a mini-van and provided our own transportation, which I highly recommend given the heat and the fact that Saratoga Springs is very spread out and walking anywhere (pool, office, restaurant) will take precious time away from your vacation. We loved our two bedroom, two bath suite in Congress Park. It was very spacious, clean, and everything was in working order. The kitchen and washer & dryer were so nice to have. The maid service was top notch and they even called one day to inquire as to when they might come by when we accidentally left our do not disturb sign out. My only complaint would be that the two bedrooms are lacking for storage. There is ample closest space, but not dresser space, so we just kept our clothes in our suitcases, which seemed silly given the size of the rooms. The bed was the most comfy one I've ever had in a hotel and was more comfortable than my own bed at home. We did have a slight issue upon check-in. We used Disney's Magical Express and they were supposed to deliver our luggage directly to our room. Someone from the main office called and gave us a hard time, saying we had to be at the room when the luggage was delivered. This is not true and the material even state that you do not have to be in your room. The individual was quite rude. Other than that, all of the staff was very friendly and accommodating.

<Title>“Lovely 2 bedroom suite”
<Content>We had a great disney vacation! Our stay at Saratoga Springs was great - I have not stayed at any other disney resort, so I can't compare others. I have read others say that the resort is large, and there is no "on resort" transportation. Luckily we were located in a building that was close to a bus stop and the main pool/building - we were a fairly short walk to the other pools as well. When we arrived and departed we had transportation to and from our room, as well as shuttle service to and from the airport. No problem getting to the parks, the busses ran every 10 -15 minutes and there were plenty of busses. Same with leaving the park, we always had a bus from our resort waiting there at the bus stop. No trouble at all with transportation - we didn't rent a car, and if you stay at a disney resort and plan to visit disney theme parks, you really don't need one. This resort is more of an "adult disney" experience - its not totally "mickied" out, but you get that at the theme parks. While there are hints of disney in the room, it is not unlike many other resorts villas in its decor. But HEY!!! your at Disney, so you don't really want to spend tons of time in your room anyways!! But when you have a busy day at the park you really want to be comfy!! THIS PLACE WAS SOOOO COMFY!! What we liked: Beds, pillows, so comfy. Bathrooms spacious and clean. Towels, soap, shampoo etc replenished daily, Nice living space to watch TV. /hang out. Functional and clean kitchen. Coffee maker/Free coffee. Full sized fridge and stove. Dishwasher. WASHER AND DRYER!! It was great to come home from 10 days vacation with literally no dirty laundry! :) I have to say I really liked everything about this 2 bedroom villa....Location: walking distance from dt disney! we did not spend a lot of time at the resort during the day, but we did enjoy one day by the pool. Lots of activities for the kids poolside. They have a movie every night on a big screen by the pool...that was pretty cool. The pool closes at 11....that was not really cool with the kids (as they are a little older). What I didn`t like`: The menu at the artists cafe is limited at best. This is the quick serve place that you would generally go for breakfast or lunch....and the saratoga chips were ok the first time...but they got tired as a side, other options would have been nice. eggs were ALWAYS very undercooked and only came scrambled. The welcome home thing can be trying on the nerves if you have to walk pass the guy in the entrance who says welcome home more than 2 or 3 times in an hour....PLEASE!! Do not welcome me home. I am not home....thankfully I am on vacation! We are canadian and didnt get fair exchange for our currency at this hotel, and while the two staff members who figured out "how to do it" were nice about it....we were disappointed that they were not familiar at all with canadian currency. The values are written right on the bill, "whats this?" is not really an appropriate question. Exchange rates according to disney must have "service charges" hidden in them...they are not the same as the markets. Compared to other resorts that we visited for dinner shows ie. the polynesian (for spirit of aloha) and the place where the hoop de doo musical review takes place (can't remember the name of the place) saratoga springs doesn't seem as "themed" or spirited. If I went back I might try a different resort, but this time I really needed a 2 bedroom villa...

<Title>“The best Lobby welcome”
<Content>We just joined the Disney Vacation Club and chose Saratoga springs as our 'home base" resort. This was the most affordable of the Disney vacation club options and we could see why as it is a bit outdated than the other properties. My sisters said that the property is modeled after a wealthy upstate NY retreat which used equestrian themes as their decor. It also had a slight feel of a plantation as well- spread out, quiet, and old. The kitchen was the largest we have seen- I bet when they remodel them they will make them smaller like other hotels. The rooms were vast but we stayed on the patio floor and the room smelled of mildew. We were glad that we were staying for one night. It was too spread out for my taste and we needed the complimentary golf cart carriage to get us and our luggage to our rooms. We waited about 30 minutes for the golf cart to arrive. Disney service was impeccable as usual and customer service is always top notch. The lobby greeting was especially enjoyable for my 4 year old daughter- they showered her with attention and made her feel like a princess from the moment we walked in. While it might be awhile since we visit Saratoga springs again we definitely enjoyed our time at the Animal Kingdom Kidani village and would go there again.

<Title>“great time wish we spent more of it in the resort than at the parks”
<Content>we have just returned from a trip at the SSR as a group of 10 at this resort,we were staying in a 1bed studio and a 2 bed villa, great rooms the villa was so spacious we had maid service daily which we did not expect, we did pre contact the resort to request the Paddpck close to the new pool we were in the 1st block to the pool which the kids loved to play in, their are other pools around the resort, which yes is very large but is pleasant to wallk around and take in the animals around the lakes watch the turles swimming in the river,i just wish we had spent more time in the resort as their seemed to be so much going on planned actvities etc, children entertained by the in house team at the pool with games thank you all for making our time a great one, the only moan i would have is the wait time at the snack bar at he pool area but once we were aware of this we ordered 20 mins before we needed it but it was all cooked fresh for you.and the conseirge desk just took ages to deal with queries, bus service we used a few times had to allow 20mins for transfers and downtown disney was quicker to walk along the pathway 12 mins to be exact..

<Title>“Simply the Best”
<Content>We, being mum dad son and daughter stayed at a disney hotel for first time. We have visited Orlando many times before but never on a disney site. We were a little worried about being Mickey'd Out by the end of our stay but S.S. was perfect. Everyone was incredibly helpful and despite a hitch at checkin this was sorted quickly and efficiently. We stayed in a studio which was fine and lovely to have a balcony to chill out on. The children always had something to do whilst on site and I felt completely at ease as to their safety and wellbeing. Our son is autistic and this was the first time that mum and dad ever felt that we could leave him in the hands of the staff from the community hall and relax - WOW! They made us all feel very special and we very much look forward to staying there again in 2012. The only down point was the food from Artist Palette which left a lot to be desired. We had disney dining plan which was brilliant as we got to enjoy many shows and restaurants that we had not been able to afford before.

<Title>“Be ready to ride busses just to get to lobby.”
<Content>Stayed at Saratoga springs for 3 nights/4 days during first family trip to Disney. Had 6yr old daughter, and 11yr old son and was so stoked to stay at the resort. We were so disappointed. Our villa was so far away from the lobby that it took 6 bus stops just to get to the lobby and buy groceries. It really felt like you are on an island stuck without any outside interaction. Could not wait to chck out and for the last 4 days and night we stayed at Animal Kingdom. What a huge difference. Saratoga spring is a classless, overgrown, leviathan where animal kingdom was classic Disney magic.

<Title>“Great "deluxe" category Disney resort”
<Content>Stayed in a two bedroom villa at this resort in the Paddock area. Great new pool next to the block I was in though at the end away from the pool so no noise unlike some of the rooms that open up onto it. The villa had three rooms, one with two double beds, one with a king size and a middle room with full kitchen, including dishwasher, washing machine/dryer and sofa bed. Though it was a Villa there was maid service everyday to make the beds, whilst the bedding was changed every few days. The Disney transport to/from the parks and this resort is prompt and regular. You can also walk to downtown Disney from the resort – some of the blocks even overlook downtown. The only downside to the resort is the quick service restaurant. As the Villas all have self catering kitchens, the restaurant facilities are scaled back compared to other resorts as they are not used as much as at other resorts. However I was on the Disney dining plan and when on the dining plan you are looking to eat at their restaurants rather than self-cater. The limited choice at the quick service facility did not make this part particularly enjoyable.

<Title>“Awesome trip, the customer service needs improvement.”
<Content>We stayed in a "deluxe" villa with another family from August 8th-17th. The room was comfortable and clean. The bathroom on the side with the two queen beds was basic whereas the bathroom on the king-sized bed side was more luxurious. There was only one very small wall-safe with one key to share, so if you are two families it can be tricky. The kitchenette was small but adequate. There were three LG flat-screen tvs in the villa. We stayed in the "Springs" section which was close to the pool and restaurant, but frustrating because it was the last stop on the shuttle route. So the 5-minute drive to Downtown Disney took 20-25 minutes. The shuttles were a disappointment. Yes they run every 20 minutes (sometimes every 30 minutes) but they never arrive at the same time. What I mean is one morning, for example the Magic Kingdom shuttle will arrive at 10 and the next it will come at 10:10. It is totally luck of the draw whether you get a shuttle right away or have to wait 20 minutes. Also leaving the parks they don't add extra buses at closing, so they were always packed and you had to wait 20 minutes for the next one. The shuttle service could definitely be improved. My biggest complaint is with the staff. They are polite and all smiles, but they tell you nothing. They hand you your key and say 'have a nice trip'. We were joking at the vacation club slogan, "Disney's best kept secret"...well everything is a secret at this resort. They don't tell you that there are free lockers in the spa but you have to pay for the lockers by the pool. They don't tell you anything about the difference in the quality of the quick service restaurants. They don't tell you that there is no difference between your kid's meals and adult meals on your quick-service card (which means you can buy any adult meal using your child's points). They don't tell you that they will charge you 17$ for a 30 second long distance call from your room. I have been at resorts where they invite on a tour of the resort and explain everything, nothing like that here. Back to the restaurants for a second. If you are on quick-service you can get some small corn-dog bites, fries and a drink at Casey's in Magic Kingdom, or you can get bacon-wrapped meat-loaf with fried onions and a port-wine reduction at Wolf-Gang Puck in Downtown Disney. There is nothing wrong with Casey's, actually their hot-dogs are fantastic. However the range in quality of the quick-service restaurants was quite stunning. For example, for the four of us to eat at Casey's it would have cost 40$ whereas it would have cost 92$ at Wolf-Gang Puck, but both cost us only 4 points. Something to consider. Disney is awesome and the Saratoga Springs Resort is a nice hotel with nice pools. Being close to Downtown Disney (we walked many times after our shuttle disappointments; we also took the boats a couple of times) was nice, but it also meant we were a good 20 minutes from the parks. I think it was very good, but I would probably look at a different resort the next time.

<Title>“Don't waste your money”
<Content>We paid 1500 a night for the 3 bedroom villa. As others have said, it's run down and needs updated. The upper floor air cond. didn't work. We call maint. and he fixed it. After he left it quit working again. It is hot in Aug. we understand and we came from Ohio where it's been 90 plus for weeks, but we knew the air was broken. The front desk and the manager tried to tell us it was just because it's harder to cool an upstairs. There was no way to get room service, the groceries were so high priced. $8.00 for a six pack of coke, $12.00 for a six pack of beer and $7.00 for a tv dinner. We won't go back here.

<Content>We went there with four children on a vacation before school started and it was wonderful. All the employees are so nice and helpful, the pool side games are very family friendly and even the life guards jump in and play with everyone!!! The resort is clean and well kept. We had an issue with the pull out matress and it was taken care of within 15 minutes. Anything we needed was resolved very fast! Love the resort!!!!

<Title>“One of the best Disney Resorts!”
<Content>Our Holiday began on the 27th of July. We arrived rather tired but very excited. After picking up our hire car we set off to our resort arriving at around 5.00pm (US time) The check in system was very quick and easy and we headed up to our villa in the "Springs". The Resort's villas are split up into different areas: The Grandstand The Springs The Paddocks The Carousel Congress Park All of which have their positive and negatives. We chose the "Springs" as my mom has walking difficulties and this area is closest to the resort amenities. We had booked a 2 bedroom dedicated villa for 2 adults and 2 teens. This meant we had 1 king size bed and 2 queens as well as a fold out sofa bed. It also came complete with a kitchen and all of its utensils, crockery, cookware, dishwasher, oven, microwave etc. There was also a washer/dryer & flat screen t.v's in each room etc Full listings are available on the link below: http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/resorts/saratoga-springs-resort-and-spa/services-amenities/ We had requested a water view when booking which we did not receive in our first villa. Marching straight back down to reception the Disney staff worked their magic and produced another 3 rooms in the Springs area which we then investigated ourselves then took our choice back to reception. My family and I were heading out to see "Harry Potter Land" early the next morning so we had arranged for bell hop to collect our baggage at 5.00 AM. They arrived spot on time and took our bags away. On return from our trip to Universal Studios we went straight up to our new villa. All seemed perfect with our lovely new view until my mom and my boyfriend felt the floor vibrating wildly. We hopped back down to reception after two night's of my mom and boyfriend trying to convince my dad and I, that the floor was really moving! Finally we were allocated our last room which did not have the wonderful view like the villa before but did have a floor that did not vibrate! We had a brilliant stay over villa 4727 for the remaining 11 nights we had. The Artists Palette served basic food e.g nuggets, sandwiches, salads etc. We ate breakfast in our room and shopped at Walmart for our extra food. The shop at SSR also sells bread milk etc but obviously your paying that extra bit more. We were fortunate to have been on the DDP which ensured we were all full at the end of each day and cut budgeting for meals each day. We did book "The Turf Club" for a night, but after supposedly missing our name being called after we had sat in front of the restaurant for 1 hour, we did not get our meal and settled for nuggets and CHIPS ( I hasten to add these are crisps) before an early night in bed. The pool movies begin at 9 pm each night at the main pool just across from the Springs. Unfortunately due to bad weather our planned movie was called off. My mom and I also had an opportunity to use the spa. We both had a healing hands massage $150 and were also able to use the sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. It was a very therapeutic atmosphere and a nice break from the hot sunny afternoon. Overall I would recommend this resort to anyone. You are only at the most a 10 min walk away from Down Town Disney and you can also take buses and boats direct from the resort. The staff were wonderful as you would expect from the Disney team and our villa was always pristine clean every single day. A perfect resort for anyone looking to stay at Disney.

<Title>“As expected - fantastic”
<Content>Let's begin by simply stating that staying at any of the on-property Disney Resorts accomodations is going to rival any 5 star accomodations anywhere - they're just that good. Spacious, well-appointed rooms. Grounds that are spotless. Staff that are helpful and friendly. All needs anticipated beforehand and accomodated. We stayed at Saratoga Springs for 5 nights in a 2BR/2BA deluxe villa and pretty much got all of that. We have stayed before at Boardwalk villas and Wilderness Lodge villas(twice) and decided to give these a try. SS is much larger, more units, and more spread out than the others. More like condo complex with multiple buildings similar to Old Key West and unlike Wilderness Lodge, Boardwalk, Yacht/Beach Club where the villas are housed in one building. So the feel was a little bit different and the location is not quite as convenient since it is further away from the parks. But still a beautiful property, 2 large pools (new Paddock pool just opened) and few other smaller ones. We golfed several times so convenient for that since Lake Buena Vista course is right there and Osprey Ridge is very close by. We actually arrived @ noon but our room wasn't quite ready so since we had a tee time, we hit the golf course. As promised, they texted me when our room was ready so we went straight to it after our round(he already gave us our keys). Having the kitchen is huge to be able to eat breakfast (cereal, bagels, whatever) right away and hit the parks early without having to herd everybody to a restaurant. ONE THING: C'mon Disney - isn't about time to start including free in-room WI-FI?? (Currently it's with a hard line(ethernet cord provided) and it costs $10/day)

<Title>“Magical”
<Content>What a wonderful experience, as only Disney can do it! We arrived at the hotel early so that we could begin our visit to the parks. As soon as we entered the lobby the doorman greeted my 6 yo niece, "Welcome home, Princess," and then handed her a crown. This was her first trip to Disney and she was truly in awe. When we were checking in, expecting a two bedroom villa and a single room, we were pleasantly surprised that we had been "magically" upgraded to a three bedroom Grand Villa. What a beautiful room and hotel. We had excellent service our entire trip! We can't wait to come back!

<Title>“We absolutely loved it, only regretted not spending more time at the resort.”
<Content>I really loved Saratoga. The view of the newly added pool was awesome. The spa was great. There was a jacuzzi in our room. The washer/dryer in our room helped so much. They even give two free tide starters. Everyone from the bellhop to the concierge gave wonderful service. If you have a kitchen try ordering groceries on line for delivery. The disney bus service worked great and really did save on expenses. It was so easy to use, even my kids had it figured out by the end of the day. I wish I had known more of what disney had to offer. No need to bring too much cash with you. Their resort card gives you credit you can use at all the parks. The dining plan for us was a bit much...but hey you are on vacation...live it up!!

<Title>“Ab Fab Saratoga”
<Content>Whats not to love about a Disney resort. Staying in a two bedroomed Villa for five people, it was huge. In the group was our kids then 17 and 16 and a family friend. The kids comfortably slept in one bedroom and we had a huge king size bedroom with ensuite spa bath and seperate bathroom. The kitchen was adequate and we would have breakfast everyday in the room. We stayed in The Springs area room 4421 and would recommend, it is close to main pool, main concierge, spa - massages are fantastic. Really close for everything. Do not believe anything about the busses, we didn't wait long for any bus, it was never overfilled and when all said and done your on holiday - chill. The pool was fantastic, great fruit cocktails from the bar. We ate and Downtown Disney plenty of times and really enjoyed food and ambience. Really had an enjoyable, relaxing stay but managed to find time to run around every park, we did stay for 10 days so didn't feel the need to rush anywhere. Chilled on the balcony some nights with a glass of something, loved it. Would definately stay here again and would love to soon.

<Title>“More issues again”
<Content>We have stayed at SSR 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 in July and will be again in October, unless we stay else where. Every year we have trouble with the buses at SSR. The last 2 times we have had issues with the sofa, you can't sit on it because it hits the back of your legs because the cushions are not as good as they should be. We have complained each time and we have gotten points back once. We waited 40 minutes for a bus at Downtown Disney (DTD) and because we had dinner reservations at Turb Club (we found to be great food) we decided to walk back. We missed the sidewalk and turned into where the Security Guard is just down the road from DTD. The Guard we rude and said we should have used the sidewalk (we missed it), and rather than say, there is a side walk on the right just up ahead, so please stay to the right he wanted us to turn around and walk back to where the sidewalk is. Now I had my mom in a scooter, 3 year old nephew, and 14 year old nephew and this was at the end of a 7 day stay and we went to the parks every day. We were tired and I was not going back to that sidewalk. I let the front desk manager know how we were treated. In May 2011 we stayed at the Bay Lake Towers at the Contemprary (BLT) in room 8022 with MK view (Magic Kingdom) and it was unbelievable. My 3 year old nephew would go to the window every time we were in the room and run to the window and say "Walt Disney World". The windows are floor to ceiling and we really like that the pool was right there. If you can stay at BLT, I highly suggest it, even if it is not with MK view as getting to MK and Epcot is very easy because of the Monorail and thus it appears they have more buses for Hollywood Studio, Animal Kingdom, and Downtown Disney.

<Title>“Once again...Saratoga Springs was wonderful!”
<Content>My family and I were at WDW this past May and had a great time! We decided to stay at Saratoga Springs once again and had a great stay (we were also there in May 2010). We requested to stay in the Springs section of the resort and our request was fulfilled. We had a beautiful room and an easy walk to the bus stop, main pool, & the Carriage House. We can not say enough good things about this resort and our visits to WDW - our daughters LOVE it and so do my husband and I! If you are looking for a quiet place to relax after a busy day at the parks, Saratoga Springs is the perfect place for you!!!!

The room was decorated nicely with a high end kitchen. And as always the room was very clean. We would stay at this resort again but it wouldn't be our first choic.

<Title>“Wonderful home from home resort”
<Content>We are members of the Disney vacation club and this is our home resort. You can however book this as hotel only if you are not members. The resort itself is perfect for my partner and I. You can walk to Downtown Disney if you wish (depends if you are mobile and what block you are in.) We find the Springs to be the best block or the Paddock as you can get to both Downtown Disney and the main shop (Artist Palette) where the dinning and reservation desk is. The rooms are very clean and comfortable (We book a studio). A studio is perfect for 2 but if we had children we would book a bigger room. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the resort is kept very clean. The transportation is good to all the parks and we were never waiting very long. It just seems that way when you are exicted about getting to the parks! We had a car so we had our evening meal off disney property mostly which was cheaper than a dining plan for us. Plus you get more variety and there is lots of really good restaurants around like the Red lobster and the lone star. The main pool is very nice and we enjoyed sitting around it in the afternoon. We also enjoyed the hot tub after a day in the parks. It is very handy to do your laundry which means if you go for two weeks you only have to take one weeks worth of stuff! All in all we love it here and are going back this year.

<Title>“So fun and relaxing!”
<Content>Disney's reputation for great service definitely held up on this trip. We stayed in a Treehouse Villa of the Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa on Disney property, and did not meet a single unhelpful or unfriendly staff member. The villa was sparkling clean - the attention to detail was amazing. It was my husband and myself, my brother and his wife, our son, and their three kids. The room with the bunk beds was great, my brother's two younger boys shared the bottom bunk, their 8 year old daughter took the top, and my two year old was in a pack in play, they all slept peacefully in the same room. I was worried it would feel too oppressive and crowded with 8 people, but it was fine. The master bath was awesome. I don't usually lament leaving any part of a hotel when I return home, but that bathroom made it hard to go back to my normal one! We had a complex reservation, I had also gotten rooms at the main part of the resort, one for my sister and her husband, and one for my father. I researched the layout of the resort, and made very specific room requests so that even though the Treehouses were in a section of the resort a little ways from the main part, they were in the section that was closest to us. I also requested a treehouse that was along the outside edge of the treehouse circle, also being very specific about room numbers. My dad and little sister were put exactly where I asked, and they put them next door to each other because they noticed the reservations were linked, and while the treehouse I got was outside of my specifically requested numbers they clearly understood the spirit of my request and stuck to that. One thing that was hard was that the Treehouse villas are a ways a way from things. Don't take a room there if you don't mind doing a LOT of walking! We like walking, so it wasn't too bad for us, but if you're the type of person who is in a hurry to get places, the Treehouse villas are not for you, stay in the main part of the resort. I also read in some reviews that the lighting in the Treehouses was a little dim, and I have to say it wasn't that great. Not bad, but not great. The bedrooms were the worst for this. The last con is that I wish the buses that went to the parks stopped in the treehouse area. I knew they didn't, but having stayed there that would have been the one touch that made the treehouses perfect. The pros for the treehouses specifically were that they are all separate condos, not attached to each other. With an 8 year old, 7 year old, 3 year old, and 2 year old running around, jumping and yelling, it was REALLY nice to not have to worry about annoying people in adjoining rooms. The treehouse area was VERY peaceful and quiet. We may have been smack in the middle of the biggest tourist attraction in the world, but it felt like we were in a quiet cabin in the woods. Having the full kitchen was also great. It made feeding that crowd so much easier!

<Title>“Uncharacterist experience”
<Content>Below is the feedback I provided Disney after our stay: I am writing to provide feedback from our recent stay (June 6-10); we were staying on DVC points from a friend. This was my 27th Disney trip (Walt Disney World, Disney Cruise Line, & Disneyland Paris). It was also my 12th different on-property resort stay with multiple previous stays at Animal Kingdom Lodge Villas - Kidani Village, Beach Club Villas, Boardwalk Villas, Old Key West, Animal Kingdom Lodge, Yacht Club, Port Orleans-Riverside (Dixie Landings), Port Orleans-French Quarter, Caribbean Beach, Coronado Springs, and All-Star Music. Unfortunately, per this first stay at Saratoga Springs, it will likely be my last. Our arrival on Magical Express was efficient. Registration per the on-line check in line was quick... too quick. We were given our Welcome folder, but had to ask where our room was located and how to get there. We had put in a request to be near the main Springs building, but that was not accommodated. We understood this, especially since it was June and we were checking in on a Monday. However, we did not expect to be so far away. Although I had stayed at many other WDW resorts and driven by Saratoga Springs many times, we did not have a good concept of the large expanse of the property. We were assigned the Carousel area in room 7236. Luckily, this was very near the bus stop, but even with a good sense of direction, we couldn't grasp where we were located from the main building or how/if we could walk there. It took us until Wednesday to finally navigate our way on foot. The villa was as expected with all the usual comforts of "home". However, we were struck that there were only 2 plates, bowls, and hand towels since we would not have housekeeping until Thursday. Our biggest frustration was transportation, particularly to Downtown Disney; this was especially important to us, as we were not going to the theme parks on this trip. Throughout our stay there were considerable consistent waits for the Downtown Disney (DTD) busses. I would expect this in June; however, the theme park busses were readily flowing. We would often see multiple busses to a single park before ever seeing a DTD bus, which was surprising since we were located so close to DTD. Even though our resort did not share busses with another resort, the transport time to/from DTD was more than expected with a stop at the Marketplace, Pleasure Island, Typhoon Lagoon (during the day), and the multiple stoplights on Buena Vista Dr. It seemed to take less time to transfer all the way over to the parks to resort hop than switch at DTD. In fact, the day we went to Beaches and Cream at the Beach Club for lunch, we elected to bus to Hollywood Studios and walk. Likewise, the night we went to O'hana at the Polynesian for dinner, we gave up on waiting 25 minutes for a DTD bus, and instead braved the Extra Magic Hour crowds to bus to the Magic Kingdom and then took the Monorail. The return trip via DTD bus was better, but keep in mind that was at 11pm on a week night. What we learned throughout the week was that the boat from Saratoga to Pleasure Island was much faster, more reliable, and more pleasant. Although the internal bus routes made sense once we figured them out, they were not explained at check in and the bus stop signs did not include this information. Initially getting from the Springs bus stop to the main building was a virtual mystery. I would have never guessed we needed to go through a small gate, through the main pool area, and up stairs/ramp. We felt like we were in a maze. We finally found the internal bus route information in small print in our Welcome folder and after asking one of the drivers. We had originally planned to spend a good deal of time at a quiet pool, but since the Paddock was closed, we could not walk to a quiet pool. We were so tired and frustrated with the busses, we didn't end up using either of the quiet pools. This was a huge disappointment for our non-park stay. Luckily we did have a leftover ticket from Typhoon Lagoon from a previous stay and were able to obtain a "Getaway Glen" that was a great experience. Once we figured out how to get to the Springs building, it wasn't that bad of a walk. However, if my 67year old mother had been with us, there is no way she could have made the walk in that heat. Finding Community Hall was also a struggle; even with the maps, we still had to ask for directions. The sign hanging from the ceiling around a corner was virtually hidden. It was a nice offering for DVC members to have free DVD rentals. However, near the end of our trip we discovered my Key to the World (KTTW) card, as the primary guest on the account, did not have DVC printed on it, but my friend's card did! How/why did this happen? This meant we missed out on restaurant discounts during our stay! As for dining at the resort, the "food court" is certainly off key. There were only a couple of things on the menu I would eat there, so we didn't have a single meal at Artist's Palette. (I do not expect Brie cheese to be on a WDW food court menu. Food courts are for traditional Americana; leave the cuisine to the table service restaurants.) Speaking of, we did greatly enjoy a late lunch at Turf Club; the sweet potato fries were a nice surprise. The highlight of our stay was our server Melissa from Georgia. She was a perfect Disney server: giving just the right amount of suggestion without showing offense when we selected something else, positively engaging us in personal small talk, quietly waiting to the side for us to finish a conversation prior to clearing plates, patiently waiting for our selections from indecision, and not rushing us to complete our meal. I wish she could be my server at every meal! Our housekeeping was the day prior to our departure. When we returned for the day, I was stunned. While the trash had been taken out and the dirty towels had been removed, no clean towels had been left, no plates had been restocked, the beds had not been made, etc.! I have never experience this lack of service at any of the other DVC resorts. Our departure Magic Express letter arrived with no bag tags and our envelope included another family's letter! Luckily our tags did arrive in a separate envelope later and I trekked to Registration to return the other family's letter. Finally, I looked for my folio statement outside our door on the morning of our departure, but it wasn't there. I thought perhaps this was an effort to be more green and not print them. However, upon inquiring about this at Registration I was shocked to hear I hadn't been setup for Express Checkout. How could this be? My credit card had been attached to my KTTW card all week, and I had certainly used it. I was told this should have been setup at check in. Apparently the Cast Member who rushed us through check in had skipped this. As my colleagues at work said, only "Disney-ite" like myself would have noticed some of these things; normal guests would likely not think twice or even realize some of these issues. However, many of these things were very out of the ordinary from other stays we have had. It seems this resort is lacking in training, reiteration, or general Disney service expectations. Perhaps this is a case that the resort is simply too big for management to uphold a quality of service easily found at the other resort properties. We are still glad we had this quick getaway experience, as any trip to Disney is better than none at all or traveling elsewhere. However, in the future Saratoga Spring will be among our last choice of on-property resorts. Best wishes for future success. DISNEY RESPONSE (I hesitate to post this, as I got "flamed" for it on another site.) We were not looking for any type of response at all. Yet, based on our numerous stays and detailed account of lots (although small) issues at the resort, a Disney Rep did call me and they offered us two free nights at the DVC resort of our choice. I was stunned and feel like we won the lottery!

<Title>“We loved Saratoga Springs, Spa and Resort”
<Content>My family stayed at the Paddock (5621) for seven days in July 2011. It was seven of us, two kids age 6 & 16 and five adults. We had a two bedroom unit. Plenty of room. I am glad I didn't listening to the negative reviews. Our experience was great. If we caught the bus, it came so fast. Never did we have to wait. The cast members treated us like royalty. The rooms was well stocked with what ever you might need. The way the pools were set up was great for kids, you always felt like they were safe with the lifeguards paying so much attention. I loved the activities at the pools. The arcade, everything was nice. I truly enjoyed this resort. I am looking forward to staying here again. No complaints. Don't be a victim of bad reviews.

<Title>“STEER CLEAR of Saratoga Springs”
<Content>Saratoga Springs, aka eat your own poo and contract cholera, ranks as the most horrible resort I have ever had the misfortune to stay at. Most of the larger villas, like the 2-bedroom one I stayed in, are a 15 to 20 min WALK from the main lobby, pool and restaurant area. After a long day in the Disney parks, who wants to hike to the pool just to cool off? And when you get to the main pool, well, the entire thing is only 3 feet deep. You can't even kick your legs without scraping the bottom. The only restaurant on premise is a teeny cafe with limited options, so one morning I drove to ANOTHER DISNEY RESORT just to get a decent buffet breakfast. There is no transportation between areas of the resort, which is widespread and horribly laid out, and forget taking the buses to the parks--you won't get one unless you wait for an hour. Even the boats drop you off in the back of the hotel with little access to the main resort area. To make matters worse, our room had no functioning air conditioning...in the middle of summer. No one would come to fix it, either. The room was also dark and poorly planned, with a bathtub in the middle of a room that was unusable because no doors or walls concealed it (and there is an excess of useless doors separating spaces that shouldn't be.) Perhaps worst of all, there is ZERO AMBIANCE to this resort. There's no over-the-top Disney glamor, no breathtaking design. You are literally stuffed in ramshackle wooden condos stacked on top of one another. It feels like a prison, and Disney should be ashamed to call this their resort. If you plan on having conveniently located amenities, a beautiful room and accessible transportation, don't stay at Saratoga Springs.

<Title>“Perfect-we loved this resort”
<Content>Whenever we travel to Orlando we are always sure to stay at a Disney Resort. In the past we have stayed at the Value or Moderate Resorts but because we need more than one room in those resorts we decided to book at a Deluxe Suite and settled on Saratoga Springs. Disney always does a great job at first impressions and the check-in area of this resort was no disappointment. It is absolutely beautiful.When we arrived at our room it was perfect.We had a two bedroom suite with a fully equipped kitchen, living room and two massive bathrooms as well as a stacking washer and dryer. Tide soap was even supplied everyday. The beds were extremely comfortable and the pull-out sofa was the most comfortable one we have ever had. Our suite had a large balcony with two lounge chairs and a small table that we used often.The room was immaculate and everyday the maid service did a great job. The ability to be able to enjoy breakfast and lunch in the room when we wanted to made this vacation even better.We tend to get tired of eating out for every meal so having a kitchen works very well for us.The proximity to Downtown Disney was very convenient for us too. This resort is literally next door to Downtown Disney and within easy walking distance but also readily accessible by the Disney bus system or the water taxi service. Also, the pools were awesome too. We only went to two of what I think is a total of four and both were great. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone who is considering it. We cannot think of a single negative during our stay here.

<Title>“Great Stay at a Great Place”
<Content>We had a great time in Disney. This place wasn't too spread out for us, because we're active anyhow. The room was exactly what we wanted and needed. It was clean, and very functional. My husband really enjoyed the gym. As a guy who lifts all but one day a week, it had everything he needed to get the job done. The pool was nice. It wasn't anything too special. I did have a massage while I was there. It was just okay. Of course, I work at a Spa, & I have a particular style massage I enjoy. That's one of those things that is so personal, and varies by the individual. We would definitely stay again. The best part was its proximity to Downtown Disney. Only took like 3 minutes to get there via the bus!

<Title>“Very nice resort, but too big for our family”
<Content>Stayed at Saratoga Springs over President's Weekend. Weather was wonderful, and our kids (5, 4, and 2) had a wonderful time. The holiday weekend was extremely crowded in the parks, so we spent nap-time each day back at the resort. We had lots of time to experience it, and overall we really liked it. What we liked: 1. Accommodations were big and very well appointed. We were staying with another family in a two-bedroom condo, and we never felt cramped. 2. Pool was awesome with a killer waterslide! Kids loved it for an afternoon break. 3. Transportation to/from the park was easy. Bus station was right outside, and we never had to wait more than 15 mins or so. That turned out to be a good time for applying sunblock. 4. Disney DVD borrowing from the activity center. This is an awesome perk in any Disney resort, and since my kids really needed some down-time each day we took full advantage of the free movies. Ask about it at check-in. What we didn't like: 1. This resort is very spread out, and dragging sleep deprived children long distances was tough for us. Probably not an issue for people without the little ones, but I would have loved it if there were better ways of moving people (we frequently stay at the Disney HHI resort, and they have the best luggage carts that can be used as people-movers). 2. Would like more options for food here. There's just one cafeteria-style joint and an upscale-looking restaurant (not suitable for the little ones). The cafeteria was good, but after getting the same few sandwiches each day I was a little tired of them. Perhaps a rotating menu would help? Going out to dinners each night is not an option for financial/logistical reasons, and eating the same thing each day just gets a little old. Those were small issues, though, and they really wouldn't apply to everyone - Just our experience. It's a very nice place to stay if you're looking for somewhere quiet, nicely appointed, and roomy with good access to park transportation.

<Title>“Kids LOVED the Tree House!”
<Content>After 5 nights at Marriott's Horizon Harbor in early June, we stayed one night at Saratoga Springs. We had reserved a tree house. We arrived at the resort around 9, and of course our "room" was not ready. We tried visiting Downtown Disney, but at 90 in the shade, we headed back to SS after about 30 minutes. We changed into our swimsuits for a dip in the main pool. The kids liked the SS main pool more than the liked Horizon Harbor with it's pirate ship pool. Our room was ready around 1:30. I had serious concerns about staying in the tree houses -- they are super far from the main resort -- not even on the same side of the little map of the resort that they give you when you check in. I thought about asking for a regular villa, but decided that we could handle driving to/from the pool for one day. Boy was I glad I didn't change our room! We ended up with a tree house right on the river. We could see boats passing by from our living room window! The tree house was gorgeous! Completely true to the theme. And the kids (ages 3 and 7) absolutely loved the bunk beds in one of the three bedrooms, even though we have bunk beds at home. We had dinner reservations at the Turf Club at SS. We thought about driving over, but decided to take a "boat" to dinner! The boat launch was a 30 second walk from our tree house. We packed our swimsuits for an after dinner swim. We waited about 5 minutes for the boat, which dropped us off right outside the Turf Club. Dinner was okay -- nothing special, but it was convenient. We ate at 6 with 2 young kids. Definitely eat later if you don't want to have a ton of kids around. The after dinner swim was way cool! Only very minor complaint was that every employee was trained to say "WELCOME HOME!" any time they saw a guest. After about 10 welcome homes, it got a little annoying. We can't wait to go back! If you stay in the tree houses, be sure to request one on the river near the boat launch!

<Content>This was a very good experience overall. We had a large two room suite and maids went over and above to provide service. But then, given the price I was paying I expect that. I also expect to have wireless internet available in 2011, and it was not available even for fee. Only corded internet. And given my family uses tablets, the corded internet was useless. I realize few people work while at Disneyworld, but I have to pay for this somehow!

The rooms were spacious, the beds comfortable and food at the quick service restaurant passable. They do need to update their menu to having the same food twice a week instead of 3. Breakfast was good, though. Will definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Always enjoy The Saratoga Springs Resort!”
<Content>I have been traveling to Walt Disney World almost every year since it opened! My recent stay at the Saratoga was the 4th time. It's a great place to stay, especially if you've been to the parks many times and just want to relax, have a lot of restaurant/entertainment options outside of the parks. Studios are well appointed, although I will agree with other reviewers about the HARD AS A ROCK sofa bed. However, usually when we get a studio it's just for the two of us and we don't use the sofa bed. The air conditioning worked well (and believe me, in the middle of summer in Florida, that's important). You really don't need a car with Disney's Magical Express and transportation system. Buses ran regularly with courteous drivers (a nice change from our previous visit). The community house is great, allowing you to check out movies, games etc. There are nightly movies shown on a big inflatable screen by the pool. The spa area is very nice with well maintained equipment for a workout (especially after a Ghirradelli ice cream stop). All in all, one of my favorite places to stay on property.

<Content>We stayed at the Saratoga Springs resort for a week and had a wonderful time. The condo was clean, comfy, and quiet. The shuttles to the Disney parks and Downtown Disney are convenient and arrive at regular intervals. The Artist's Palette offers both ready-made food and groceries--which is convenient but pricey! Overall, I would recommend this resort and we would stay here again (though, if possible, I would obtain groceries elsewhere).

We were able to cook in the room each morning for breakfast and had snacks there too. We also were able to reheat pizza leftovers one day because we got rained out of the parks. The room also had a washer and dryer which was great to do laundry every other day.

<Content>My husband and I along with my parents and brother stayed at Disney's Saratoga Springs and absolutely loved it! We are all Disney Vacation Club members and love staying on Disney property. What we loved: -Pool and Spa area. Very family friendly and relaxing. The spa and fitness area is wonderful and Disney Vacation Club members get to take advantage of member discounts at spa. -Close walk or boat ride to Downtown Disney: we walked over within 10 minutes each evening to go shopping and get a snack. -Easy access to main highway to visit attractions outside of Walt Disney World property. We visited SeaWorld's Aquatica, Universal Studios and area shopping. -Two bedroom villa: large, clean, wonderful amenities, wonderful views -WONDERFUL for golfers. My husband and brother golf on property and love the Lake Buena Vista course which Saratoga Springs and Old Key West Resorts have golf views of. They loved the close proximity. After many years of travel, it is proven to me that "The Disney Way is the Right Way". They have mastered customer service, attention to detail and excellent accommodations for those of all ages!

<Content>We stayed here to visit the Atlanta Braves Spring Training at ESPN. We had the 2 BR villa in the Disney Vacation Club. The check-in was quick and easy, very friendly. We said we wanted something close to the pool and we were right across the street, right next to a bus stop. Perfect. This hotel is also quite close to downtown Disney, just a short drive over to Disney Quest, which the kids loved. The bedrooms are large with multiple closets. The kitchen however, is incredibly small, not large enough for 6 people and the balcony is only large enough for 2 chairs. But the location of the hotel is great.

<Title>“Wonderful!”
<Content>This resort is a drive-up to your room type of resort. We rented a car, which we used daily as the resort itself is very large and sprawled out. You could take the bus to any of the disney resorts, but you would need to walk to the bus stop and wait in the heat. After so much walking at the parks, it was nice to have a car to get around. There are also shopping malls and restaurants within a short drive. Our room was clean and comfortable with a small fridge, microwave, coffee pot and some utensils. I have no complaints there. The pool was a lot of fun! There are little slides for smaller kids and a couple of larger ones for the big kids. There is a small spray park also and a beach like entry to the pool which is great with the smaller kids. The restaurant is a quick serve restaurant with ample selections. The staff were very nice and friendly. I would recommend this resort to anyone. It has a nice feel to it and very welcoming.

<Content>Great resort. It is quite large. A little too big for us. Our room was far from everything (Paddock) I believe there are about 4 pools on this resort. The one closest to us was being renovated. Thank goodness we didn't have the kids with us on this trip, or else that would have been a pain. Also, the room was far from the store and dining. There was a Disney shuttle right out in front of our complex, so that was nice. There are 4 separate stops in the one resort. It is very close to downtown disney. Very nice resort. It's Disney, I wouldn't expect any less. Probably not best for this family.

<Title>“Great place to stay .......recommend highly”
<Content>OVERALL VALUE FOR MONEY: Very very good. There are many properties at Walt Disney World that are more like apartments than hotel rooms (e.g. Saratoga Springs, Beach Club, Boardwalk, Old Key West, Wilderness Lodge, etc). You can reserve several different types of rooms such as: 1 - single room with king bed or 2 queens. 2 - combined kitchen, dinning area, and living area (sofa makes into a bed) and a bedroom with a king 3 - combine 1 and 2 and you have kitchen, dinning and living area, 2 bedrooms (king in one and 2 queens in other bedroom). Gvien the properties are inside of WDW eliminates a lot of driving. The buses run about every 15 to 20 minutes to all the parks and downtown disney. Quality: excellent

<Title>“What it is and what it's not....”
<Content>After much decision, we decided to stay on "property" at Disney and chose Saratoga Springs as the best place. We know it would cost more than off property choices. I had read some negative reviews and was concerned if we would experience problems. We liked the idea of having a kitchen and could prepare some meals instead of always eating out. So, what it is - a great family friendly place that offers a comfortable, villa experience for those families that need/want more space and a kitchen. The grounds are immaculate and the units are clean. We could easily walk to Downtown Disney (10 mins) and we were in one of the farther properties and could walk to main building/pool in 10 mins. The units are quiet and even thought the parking lot was full, we never heard any other guests or noise. They have games by the pool and lots of activities. Every "cast member" is friendly and helpful. OK, what it's not - It is not as themed as the other main hotels ( Contemporary, Polynesian, Grand Floridian) but still feels Disney like. It's not a Ritz Carlton, the villas are beginning to show a little age, but we were impressed with the cleanliness and maintenance. It's a little distance to the parks, so we rented a car and could be from our villa to the parks in under 10 mins. So, if you are looking for a larger condo type property and would like the use of a kitchen then you will enjoy Saratoga Springs. We will certainly go back.

As with all Disney resorts, you can't go wrong, but if it's the attractions at Downtown Disney your after, this is the place to stay. Close walking distance to the Downtown entertainment, great swimming pools to all areas of the resort, a nice shop and great snack shop near the lobby. Top shelf Disney quality at Saratoga Springs. The rooms are nice, spacious and even have a dvd player in each room. I highly recommend a stay here!

<Title>“Great stay at Saratoga w/ infant”
<Content>Our family stayed 7 days at saratoga recently... Found a great price online so couldnt turn down our last minute trip. We turned down the magical express and used a 3rd party service to take us to the resort..Highly recomended since they will stop at a grocery store for you. Check in - Fast and smooth.. Nothing really to comment. Our room was close to the bus stop and main pool which was nice, as this resort is HUGE. The bus stop we were at was "The Springs" which was the last of 5 stops the buses make along this massive resort. Room was nice, we recently stayed at the Polynesian last October and this room was much nicer. Had a studio room which we shared with our daughter(22 months) and mother in law, which suited our needs since we were only in the room at night to sleep. We ate at the casual location,The Artist's Palette; a few times. Food was great! The pool that we used was excellent. Large and a nice water slide. The gym was well equipped and clean. Here are my estimated times for bus travel... Epcot and hollywood - 5-10 mins Animal kingdom - 15 mins Magic kingdom - 15-20 mins at the most Again, we were the last stop for the buses so adjust accordingly if you were staying around the first stop (add 5 mins or so) I've read quite a few reviews about people complaining they waited 20-30 mins for a bus to pick them up.. this NEVER happened with our stay. We enjoyed this resort so much, that we might be staying here again for Christmas time. Definately would recommend

<Title>“Lovely resort”
<Content>We stayed in a 2 bed villa in the Congress park area. This location was fabulous. We could walk to Downtown Disney in about 10minutes. We didn't have a car and found it easy to get about, it was only a short walk to the main pool and restaurant and shop. My 10year old daughter love the organised pool games at the main pool in the afternoon. The villa was very well equipped and we had a balcony which looked over towards Downtown Disney. There was plenty of space in the villa for 4 adults and 2 children. We had the dining plan included for free when we booked with Disney and this saved us a lot of money. We would definitely stay here again was very quiet and relaxing.

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>Just got back from a 12 night stay at Saratoga. This was the first time we have stayed at this resort and found the overall experience good. We had a few issues with door cards having to swap them for new ones a few times as we were unable to get into the room. The management don't appear to be too concerned with the issue which we found frustrating and had it not been for the excellent service received by our bell man upon check out the service would have been rated as poor. Mouse keeping never appears to follow the schedule it should (for dvc) either. Apart from those few issues the resort is in a great location and would recommend a room in congress park. We had a good service on the busses during a busy holiday period which was a plus as I had heard busses were few and far between. I would recommend this resort and will be going back again.

<Title>“Good Enough”
<Content>The Villas at Saratoga Springs are beautiful, large and new. They are as close to a mid-luxury apartment complex as it is possible to be. This is both the benefit and the flaw. They are truly a great place to stay, but like Old Key West, they lack the theme and magic that one expects from Disney. There is no feeling of walking into a different world, but the hotel is still very nice. If Animal Kingdom, Wilderness, Bay Lake and the Boardwalk area villas are full, this isn't a bad alternative, but it's not a first choice. There's really nothing wrong with Saratoga, except that it isn't the others.

<Title>“Disney Does it again....”
<Content>I try to get to Disney as much as I can. On the average every 2-3 yrs. In addition to staying out of the park, I've stayed at a variety of resorts in the park. Animal Kingdom Lodge, Port Orleans, Contemporary, and Boardwalk. Saratoga Springs proved itself to be just as wonderful as all the others. Both pools were fabulous and they are building another one in the Paddock section which should be done next year (i think) That looks like it wil be awesome! Dinner at the Turf Club was the best dinner we had all week. It was perfect. The boat ride over to Down Town Disney is delightful. Staff, grounds, room, etc were all spotless. I read a couple of negative things about this resort being SO gigantic that it causes a problem.....it was bigger than any other I've stayed at. I mean there is a bit of an issue if you wanted to just go refill your mug and grab a snack..... we were in the paddock, and it was a bit far to just run over for a quick soda, but it did not hinder our trip. I also did read that the bus service was a bit slow. I felt like that was true, however, the distance to the park was not bad at all so that made up for the wait time. One tip I've learned - making your way to Fort Wilderness for the Hoop Dee Doo from any Disney Resort can take forever (unless you are at the Contemporary!) Skip the multiple bus/boat trips and just take a cab to save time on your arrival. It only costs like $9 - then take your time and boat/bus it on the way back!! Love you Disney.... Can't wait to get back!!

<Title>“Beautiful Resort! Our Favorite Place to Stay at Disney!”
<Content>My husband and I picked this resort to spend on our honeymoon! It was everything we hoped it would be. Relaxing, peaceful, beautifully landscaped. It was a dream come true. We had a one bedroom villa and it was bright and spacious. There was a large balcony that had a beautiful view of the fairways. We also found it very convenient to have a spa on grounds. The staff is the kindest we had ever encountered. They truely make your stay as pleasant as possbile. We had a great time! We are staying here again on our next trip for the week of 4th July! Can't wait!

<Title>“Good place to stay if you get a good deal”
<Content>I had an enjoyable holiday staying in the Congress park section of Saratoga Springs for 2 weeks from the 14th – 28th May, I was worried after reading reviews on here that the resort would be huge but I found that no apartment was more than 5 minutes walk from reception and Turf club/Artists Palette. Then again given the size of some of the guests and unwillingness to walk even a few meters I can see how this may be a problem for them. Pools - The resort pools were all very good, if you have kids I would suggest staying in the Grandstand section as the pool here is more child orientated with numerous water guns for the kids to spray at each other in the kids area of the pool. The Congress park pool is very nice and while having a playground nearby is more suited to adults (my kids still had a great time in this pool). The main pool was also very good with 2 slides and a hot tub, there was also a video arcade next to the pool that the children enjoyed visiting. Restaurants - In my opinion the food served at this hotel was very poor, the Turf Club was something out of Kitchen Nightmares, when I read the menu I was surprised at some of the offerings and wondered if the given dish would work – they didn’t… If you do eat here go for a burger (not the chicken burger) which was actually quite good. Everything else that I tried here was poor, terrible Calamari, horrible chicken burger, shredded buffalo wings with blue cheese – did not work. The Artists Palette was below average, my son enjoyed the flatbread pizza from here but the other offerings that I sampled were not very good. You can also purchase a refillable resort mug but this only allows you fizzy drinks, my family received one each as we were on the dining plan but only used the mugs on 2 occasions – this was due to not wanting to give my kids fizzy drinks all the time and also due to the locations of the soda fountains being far away from the rooms. On a plus the Pizza delivery to the room was good and the Pizza very tasty (Pizza delivery is by a different company). Rooms -The Studio that we stayed in was of a good size, we could have done with more storage but overall I cannot complain and the room was also clean with everything in working order with a flatscreen TV (some reviews mention that they had the old style TV’s), one thing that is needed is WiFi, strange that it is not available and would be a big plus if they introduced. Location of the resort – A great positive of this resort is being in walking distance of Downtown Disney, from Congress Park it is only a 5-7 minute walk, I had considered staying at the animal kingdom lodge but after eating at Boma there one evening and seeing the number of people from this hotel getting the bus to downtown Disney of an evening I decided that I had made the right choice. I overheard a number of the Animal Kingdom lodge guests debating if it would have been better to stay at Saratoga due to its location next to Downtown Disney and was left with the impression that the Animal Kingdom lodge may have very little to do of an evening. Buses – Overall I found the buses to be regular for Saratoga to all parks except Magic Kingdom?? I am not sure why there always seemed to be a delay in getting a bus to or from Magic Kingdom given that this is the main park? But for all other parks the connections were good and I never had more than a 10 minute wait. Would I recommend Saratoga – Yes, if you can get a good deal or are a vacation club member I would recommend the resort, it is good value, has OK connections and has a good location next to Downtown Disney. Would I stay at Saratoga again – Probably not, I was on the dining plan and was therefore able to visit a number of the Disney hotels, from these visits I decided that I would stay at the Polynesian (I like the theming, pool, location and that it is on the monorail), or the Beach/Yacht club – great pool, location. Both of these hotels are more expensive than Saratoga and so it is unfair to compare but as I next plan to visit Disney in 4-5 years I would rather spend the few days that I am there staying in a better location. On a positive I would class Saratoga as far better than the Contempory hotel which really should be demolished - the California grill was a very good restaurant and Chef Mickey’s was great for lunch but it does not take away how ugly the building is, you feel like you are staying in a 1970’s public housing block. I would also rather stay at Saratoga than Wilderness lodge which I was not impressed with when visiting Mickey’s Backyard BBQ. If you choose Saratoga I am sure you will have a great holiday, just be aware of the pros and cons.

<Title>“Here bus”
<Content>Once again, Disney proves family vacations can be enjoyable. Stayed May 21-26. Everything was done the Disney way. Clean rooms, buildings, grounds, and parks. Had a wonderful experience with one exception: The busses were exceptionally slow. Never experienced this at a Disney Property before. The wait for busses to and from this resort was exceptionally long. At times we would see two (2) busses pickup for another location before any bus for Saratoga Springs. May have been the crowds at other parks; however, we found it extremely frustrating.

<Title>“Very Nice Hotel”
<Content>We are DVC members and stayed at the Saratoga Springs for two nights in March. It was a last minute trip so we had to split our hotel stay between the Saratoga and the Wilderness Lodge Villas. We were pleasantly surprised by the Saratoga Springs, and ended up wishing we had stayed here the entire trip! Since we were only staying for two nights, we chose a Studio room. It was definately a bit small for 4 people (two adults, two teens). A Studio is probably more appropriate for 2 adults. That said, the room was clean and well decorated. We enjoyed an excellent dinner at the Turf Club, and the quick service counter was great for breakfast and late night snacks. Plenty of seating in a nicely themed area; within walking distance of the main pool. The pool is wonderful. It has a nice slide that both kids and adults can enjoy, plenty of chairs and shady spots, and a water play area for smaller children. I would definately recommend this hotel to my friends, and I would stay here again.

<Title>“A bit of Disney magic in Saratoga Springs...”
<Content>This was a family holiday with our children aged 8 and 10. We stayed here for 3 weeks and it was everything we were looking for. We had a one bedroom apartment which included a sofa bed in the lounge area. The rooms were all of a good size and tastefully decorated. We had a kitchen area complete with dishwasher/fridge/cooker. There was also a washer/dryer which disney provided washing powder for regularly. They also supplied dishwasher tablets. There was a huge bath and a separate shower room. The bedroom had a king size bed and plenty of storage, and TV's and a DVD player in both the lounge and bedroom. I cant think of anything that was lacking. The room was also cleaned regularly. There was a coffee machine and microwave. We had a wonderful balcony to sit on overlooking the golf course. TIP: We stayed in The Grandstand area and i highly recommend this as it was right next to a bus stop and the buses stopped at our area first on the way to the parks and dropped us off first on the way back, so no standing on the buses for us! We never waited any longer than 10-15 minutes for a bus to any of the parks. There was also a boat to Downtown Disney but this area could also be walked to in 10-15 minutes. There was a small swimming pool nearby which was fairly quiet or a larger pool with slides, etc nearer the reception building. Our rooms overlooked the amazing golf course and there were two restaurants on site plus the ubiquitous Disney Store. All of the staff we encountered were friendly and always ready to be helpful with any enquiries that we had. There isnt much Disney theming in this resort as such, but we liked this. To be honest, after spending your day in the parks with constant theming around you, it was nice to be able to withdraw to somewhere more neutral and relaxing. We never had any issues with noise in general in the resort or from other guests - very quiet. We enjoyed staying here very much and wouldnt hesitate to do so again. Disney do things very well in general and the high standard is carried through in Saratoga Springs.

<Title>“LOVE THIS PLACE!!”
<Content>This resort is absolutley amazing. My family and I have a timeshare here and wouldnt pick any other place to say. The rooms are so clean and comfortable and include a washer, dryer, fridge, microwave, dishwasher, and toaster. The food is not only good in the artists palette, but also at the turf club. It's a little bit farther away from the parks but the buses are air conditioned and comfortable so the ride isnt too bad. It's also only about a 15 minute walk to downtown disney. The pool area is great especially for the kids. The spa is great and relaxing as well. I would very much recomend this resort to anyone planning to stay in Disney especially if your using a timeshare. We LOVE it!!

<Title>“Fabulous!”
<Content>We stayed in a 1 bedroom villa. CLEAN - The room was very clean and so were all of the grounds. AMENITIES - They provide so many things like the Tide for the washer dryer in the room to new sponges for kitchen sink and so on. Full kitchen in 1 bedroom villa and a jacuzzi tub in the bedroom (aside from the shower/tub in bathroom). They have a store you can buy bread, eggs, etc. for cooking in room. We couldn't enjoy everything they had to offer because we were only there 4 nights. STAY - A great place to stay for a week or more. STAFF - Very helpful and friendly. QUIET - rooms were well sound-proofed and the grounds, overall, are quiet except by the pool when kids are in it. LOCATION - You can walk to Downtown Disney via a lighted, paved path or you can take the ferry from the grounds. GOLF - They have a golf course there but if you want to play at another Disney course, they will: give you a taxi voucher (free taxi ride including gratuity - there and back), provide clubs, golf cart, and 18 holes for $89. Bring your own balls or buy them there for $$$. Saratoga Springs made our stay great!

<Title>“Good Value for my money, would recommend it!”
<Content>To fellow Canadians we picked May 16th to the 23'd, just before the majoriy of the schools in the USA got out for summer break. Lines were minimal and resort was not crazy busy either. I did all my homework and read all the reviews. We have 10 yr old boys and the studio was good enough. We stayed at The Springs section. Above ground level balcony view of the lake facing Dowtown Disney. The decor was not a wow factor but I really did not care about that., No bugs or funny smells and room was clean when we got there. My request was to be near the main pool and the Artists Pallete where the market place is and got it. . Its not the first stop getting back from a park but the 4th one and we were fine with it. However first stop after Typhoon Lagoon. We took hotel pool towels to the water parks and it was fine. The walk to Downtown Disney was only 15 minutes from my section. Also the boat ride from the Turf Club was close as well. Although the paper plates and forks are cheesy however I understand why...because there are some guest that will steal the cutlery I am sure. Treehouse Villas I agree is too far. The resort is further away from the parks but last year I was at Carrabean Beach and prefer this atmosphere better. Golf course was not opened not sure why but it looked pretty good. Now I got a good deal and would not pay the asking listed price for that week. If I had to pay over $2000.00 than I would agree to go to a better resort like Grand Floridian. The only issue was the food at The Turf Club, even though its considered fine dining and priced that way, the food was not that great . I had Prime Rib and it was bland for my taste. I used Garden Grocer and had food delivered to my room when we arrived. That I recommend!

<Content>One of Disney's Vacation Club properties, this resort is located next to the Downtown Disney area. Only problem we had was either the prior guest or housekeeping turned the fridge off in the room causing it to defrost and soaking the carpet around it. The resort staff offered to move us to another room, but we liked the idea of being within walking distance of Downtown Disney.

<Content>At check-in we received a very warm welcome from the resort staff! They called out our little princess' name, gave her balloons, and sung to her. It was the most magical welcome ever! She was sooo surprised! Everyone on the resort was pleasant, polite, our room was very nice and extremely clean and comfy. We had a 2 bedroom suite in the Grandstand section, not far from the main lobby and very close to the pool and the bus stop. We utilized the Disney Magical Express with lugguage and we never had to worry about our bags. We rented a scooter for another member of our party and did not have any problems getting around on the Disney buses, ferry or monorail. It was truly a relaxing and magical vacation and we have been planning our return since we got back!

<Title>“It's DisneyWorld!!”
<Content>My wife 5 year old daughter and I stayed here last August. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and quickly provided directions to our room. At first we found the size of the hotel to be a bit overwhelming but quickly found our way around. The pool is fantastic, the water is nice and warm and a great place to go and relax after an exhausting day at one of the parks. The staff was extremely helpful and always greeted everyone with a smile. We ate several times at the "formal" restaurant at this resort and found the food to be excellent. In addition, it was also very convenient and very casual, not mention how incredibly helpful they are when it comes to accomodating those with food allergies. Thanks so much!! I will also mention how special they make each child feel staying at a DisneyWorld resort. Buses back and forth to the resort were quick and we rarely had to wait longer than 5-10 mins and were always able to get a seat. We did the deluxe dining package which is of course a personal preference as to what food package to get if any. I wont go into the details here but feel free to let me know if you have any questions abouthow we made our decision. Cant wait to go back!!

<Title>“Grand Villa was amazing”
<Content>We stayed in a Grand Villa in Congress Park for a family reunion. The Grand Villa has 3 bedrooms and sleeps up to 12 people comfortably. By square foot, the villa was bigger than my house! We had a full sized living room with a 2 story ceiling, a full dining room complete with a breakfast bar area and a small deck, a full size kitchen and 4 bathrooms. The kitchen was good sized and had everything we could have asked for. Each of the bedrooms has a private bath as well as a bath off of the kitchen. The master bedroom had a whirlpool bath as well as a king sized bed while the other 2 bedrooms on the second level had 2 queen sized beds and regular bathtubs and showers. The only complaint I had was that the beds were quite soft and not as comfortable for me as I would have hoped. We didn't venture down to the main pool area, but visited the pool down by Congress Park. It was very well maintained and the water was a great temperature. Towels are available at the pool but can't be brought back to your room. The staff was very friendly and quickly responded to concerns. We spotted several snakes below our deck and called the concierge. Within minutes, there was a security guard keeping an eye on the snakes and pest control was on the scene shortly thereafter. The area we were in, Congress Park, was just a block from Downtown Disney. There is plenty to do from shops to restaurants. The main area of the resort has a small store as well as spa services. One of our family was celebrating a birthday and we were able to easily work with the concierge to get 2 small cakes for the celebration. This resort is fairly far from Magic Kingdom and such, but they provide buses to the parks on a regular basis. The average time between buses to any park is about 20 minutes. If you go at peak times, you may find the buses a bit crowded. Right after the fireworks at Magic Kingdom, we had a number of people standing on the bus. Overall, I would recommend Saratoga Springs as a great place to stay!

<Title>“Right next to Downtown Disney”
<Content>We rented the two bedroom unit with 4 adults and 2 children. The unit had plenty of room with a King in the master, 2 doubles in the second bedroom and a pull out sofa. The kitchen was well stocked with everything needed to make a meal. The master has a giant tub that the kids loved to bathe in. The cleaning staff was outstanding. Always a smile on their face and willing to help you in any way they could. The condos are located right next to Downtown Disney which made for a pleasant walk through beautiful grounds to go out for dinner. It was chilly in Jan and the pools were heated to a wonderful temp. The only thing that might be a negitive for some is the fact that it is located on the edge of Disney property and is a good bus ride to any of the parks so allow extra time to first wait for a bus and then the drive to the park. The only other complaint is that they have carpet under the dinning table (really who thought that would be a good idea?) and a toll had been take from all the children dropping food onto it. It was not pretty and felt like it needed a good deep steam cleaning. But other than that the rest of the condo was spotless. This is a great set up for anyone traveling with a large family or group. If your spending most of your time at the Disney Parks it is a must to stay somewhere on the property. The cost is well worth all the extra perks like free transportation and extra magic hours.

<Content>This resort is top notch in all ways. We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa via timeshare exchange and the unit could not have been better. The location is great (walking distance to downtown disney and transportation to all other disney properties), the property is wonderful, the staff is terrific and all genuinely appear to enjoy their jobs. We had a wedding planned off-site elsewhere and when there was a near catastrophe with the location, Saratoga Springs resort came through and accomodated us on one day notice. They are all exceptional and made what could have a been a disaster to remember, a dream to remember. I would recommend this resort to anyone!

<Title>“relaxing after a long day in parks”
<Content>We just returned from a week long stay at Saratoga springs. It was a nice resort, as stated before, very large but managable. We stayed in Congress park, close to downtown disney, and central to the spa, and front desk. There are only two places to eat in Saratoga Springs, and both of them are just ok. We ate most evenings in downtown disney, and had for the most part good meals. We were not on the meal plan, but the prices of meals seemed to be average to me. The rooms are well used, but clean and perfectly adequate for our needs, not disney like, but nice to get away from all the disney hustle at the end of a day. We arrived at a quiet time so the bus system was easy, no waiting at all, and no lineups for it. I liked staying onsite, but I think next time we will try the Hilton bonnet creek, or the Waldorf, I really like a upscale hotel. We did a breakfast at O'hana's and it was ok, fun to see the characters, but a long trip to get there. The staff was wonderful, we encountered no issues at all, but the highlight for us was the spa. Wonderful!! Our stay was nice, not upscale, but for a family the Saratoga is very good, lots of room to sleep, but not very disney. The walk to DTD was quick and we did it everyday. It is a good choice if you want a condo type accomodation.

<Content>Had room 3227 so were close to pool, restaurants and bus stop. Some of the buildings here are pretty far away so we felt fortunate. Having the full kitchen was awesome and living room at the end of the day was nice. Although the pull out couch (we never used it) was uncomfortable to sit or lay on. Sleeping arrangements were awesome, with master bed and separate bedroom with 2 queens. We enjoyed our stay and would stay in these rooms again. One complaint was that there was not free internet, I mean when you spend this kind of money to come to Disney you should get free interent. I think it was $10 per day.

<Title>“Great Resort”
<Content>Revisited this resort again and was still impressed with it and would return. We stayed in Congress Park area (we asked for this location) in a studio 4th floor overlooking Down Town Disney, however due to a tree blocking our view from the balcony we were unable to see down town disney. Guest services were very helpful and we had no issues. The room was looking a little tired and our initial impression when we walked in to the room was a musty smell. Some fresh air from the having the patio doors open solved that problem. We preferred this location due to the pleasant walk to down town Disney and we enjoyed the pool and hot tub in this location (very quiet most of the time and relaxing).There was a bus stop outside our block, however we did not use Disney Transportation and had no problems with parking spaces, despite an increase in guests over the bank holiday weekend. Congress park is a nice place to take pictures of Down Town Disney, they have rocking chairs looking over the river to DTD, which is relaxing on an evening. We had free Disney Dining Plan (rude not to) and pre-booked all our table service restaurants in advance. Tip: try the walk to DTD for counter service meals at Earl of Sandwich or Wolfgang puck, as we preferred this to the counter service meals back the resort. Revisited Turf Club on Labor Day - virtually empty so had great service. Would stay here again in Congress Park location.

<Title>“Dream come true!”
<Content>I love it here! We stood at the Congress Park section and it was just minutes away from Downtown Disney. The Bus stop was one minute away from our room, the buses came very fast no long waits. The staff was very helpful and willing to bring you around the hotel with no problems. We had a one bedroom villa it was very clean and it had all the utilities available for your stay we did not had a cleaning person go to our room because of the lenght of our time, but really you don't need one. It is best if you get food to your room or to make because the hotel resturants don't have a lot of options and they are very pricy. Will defenetly stayed again in The springs it was so relaxing!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>“Great, but...”
<Content>PROS: Disney property - spotless, nice employees, even though a couple of them were clueless about purchasing a park hopper pass, requests fulfilled pretty quickly, magic hours, washer and dryer in unit, very spacious second bedroom with two double beds large vanity area, bell service, nice pool with water slide and two jacuzzis, bar at pool, nice arcade, large gym with lots of cardio equipment, on property quick serve food (menu changes everyday), restaurant that we didn't use, convenience items with 8 am until 11 pm hours, good set up with master bathroom with jacuzzi - separate door for toilet with a separate sink and shower in another room next to it with another sink in the jacuzzi room, ceiling fans in every room with three speeds. CONS: Huge resort property - you need a car, double the price of other comparable villa type of properties in the area (expected to be blown away by difference in price - wasn't), dining table seats two people with another bar area with two chairs, tiny kitchen (one person only at a time - open the dishwasher and you can't open the silverware drawer - that tiny), tiny living room, incredibly tiny master closet, washer and dryer stackable very very loud banging noises, air conditioning problems (not enough air to second bedroom), small balcony with two chairs and small table, loud radio disney type of music at pool, traveled with teenagers who could not walk to main area because it was at least half hour away minimum in the boiling heat, no wi-fi FINAL: Would stay again only at the right price. Too many other comparable properties in the area for half the price. Magic hours were worthless - a lot of the epcot attractions were closed during the magic hours...

<Title>“Treehouse Villas = Long Wait”
<Content>Just got back from Spring Break and stayed at the Treehouse Villas at Saratoga Springs. We are DVC members and have stayed at all their resorts. The room is just lovely with 3 bedrooms for he price of a 2 bedroom. The Treehouses are very secluded and are in a rustic setting - quite peaceful! 2 things you should be made aware of. You are away from EVERYTHING! There is no ice machine in the Treehouse section. There is no where to fill up your re-fillable mugs. You have to take a bus to the Springs bus stop to get to the main pool, the front desk, the resturants and check in counter. This is also where you will get a bus to any of the parks Although they say the buses runs every 12 minutes, it had taken us more than 35 minutes to get to theSprings stop on more than 1 occasion. Once there, you have to then wait for the bus to the park you are going too. If you ar traveling with a person using a scooter, I would highly reccomend getting a treehouse that is handicap accessible. We took my 80 year old mother who can walk a litlle so we did not ask for a handicap room. In order to charge the scooter each night,I had to srive/push the scooter underneath the treehouse to find the outlet. We were in room 7005 and there was very little room for the scooter to get underneath the treehouse. Once under, itwas very difficult to drive the scooter as the floor is covered inches deep in pine needles. Once I made it to the outlet, it was literally pitch black. I had to use the light from my cell phone to plug everything is. If you have a large group, the treehouse sleeps 9, and don't mind 1 - 2 hours travel times to the parks, the treehouse is for you!

<Title>“Love location!”
<Content>I love the location of this resort! Its just a short walk to Downtown Disney. We stayed in the Congress Park section which has a view of the downtown area. We also enjoyed the quick service restaurant and their signature, homemade potatoe chips - YUM! The main pool is really great for kids. We are NOT DVC members (we rented points) but would definitely stay here again and again!

<Title>“Fifth stay at Saratog as DVC members and happy!”
<Content>We have stayed here previously and we usually request a room at buildings closest to downtown Disney because it has its own smaller quiet pool. This was our first stay that they couldn't help us with our location request. We ended up staying near the front entrance to the resort, a long walk to the main pool and eating area. The pool closer to us was closed for renovations...and we were a little disappointed. On the plus side the buses to and from the parks came to our stop second, so it was never crowded or a long bus ride around the resort.

<Title>“Very Nice, But Very Large”
<Content>Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa is a very nice resort. The landscaping is beautiful, the property is well maintained and cared for, and the rooms were spacious. The pool areas are wonderful, especially at the Grand Stand. My fiancé and I shared a one-bedroom suite in the Grand Stand Area with my sister and her husband. Four adults in a one bedroom suite can often mean disaster. However, there was ample room for all. My only issue with the room was the bathroom layout. The toilet is in a room with in the shower room. So if someone form a party of 4 is taking a shower, and another person has to use the toilet, you have to wait. It just doesn't make sense to me or my party. The staff was friendly and attentive. We had groceries delivered upon our arrival from Garden Grocer. Since our room was not yet ready when we arrived, the bell hop held our groceries and then delivered after we received our room assignment. One thing you should be warned about is the sheer size of this resort. You want to request the Grand Stand. It is the first pick up for the parks and the first drop off as well. I want to say there are 7 stops throughout the resort. The buses were always packed on the return trips and for some reason the Saratoga Springs buses seemed to appear less frequently than others. During our week long stay I was only able to sit down once on the return in the evening. All in all it was a nice stay. However, I do believe I will stay at a smaller resort with fewer bus stops the next time.

<Title>“Wonderful!”
<Content>Saratoga Springs is located directly across the water way to Downtown Disney Market place. It is a warm and welcoming place to stay. Convienently located to all of disney's parks, water parks, and restaurants. The rooms are clean and decorated nicely. I had a beautiful view of the fairway out my window on the 4th floor. Saratoga Springs has 3 pools all easily accessible to the rooms. At the main pool they have daily games and activities. All family friendly. The food at Aritist point restaurant is very good and reasonibly priced. Or you can hopp on the ferry for a quick ride to Disney downtown where there is more food choices. If you want a quite day at the pool just stay at the 2 other pools on property. The studios have a small refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker. That's all I needed to have breakfast in the room each day and store some cold drinks for later in the evenings. My only complaint was the bed. It wasn't too comfortable. The linens were clean but the mattress wasn't comfy. Hopefully Disney will be replacing them soon. Other then that it's a great place to stay. The staff is always pleasant and willing to help.

<Title>“Even better than last time.”
<Content>This was our second stay at Saratoga Springs, which we were 'stuck with' after not being able to get any other places through the DVC for the dates we needed - we don't have kids so we didn't realize that it'd be a busy week due to kids being off from school for MLK Day. Our first stay was good (see previous review), but it wasn't so great that we were pining away to come back again. So with lower (though not bad) expectations, we actually had a better time the second go around! One of the main contributors was the better location of our room; we stayed in Congress Park which had a large pool and hot tub within extremely easy walking distance. Last time we were here, we stayed at the Paddock and had a HUGE walk down to the pool, which was difficult on an injured brother-in-law and an older mother-in-law. Come to think of it, maybe it was a better time because they weren't with us this time... :) It was a great time to come to Disney World though. Even with it being kind of a busy time with kids off for MLK day, we never waited on a line at any of the parks beyond 30 minutes. The pool by Congress Park was often empty too, families seemed to prefer the main one with the slide, activities, and proximity to food/drinks. Food at the Artist's Palette was as good as we remembered it - I was looking forward to the cheeseburger flatbread after our first visit. Getting hungry now just thinking about it. The room was clean; no complaints about that at all. It's a great resort in terms of proximity to Downtown Disney too, which we visited almost every day. It's not too far to walk to, but my wife and I like the ferry service so we took that most often. Service was great. The check-out service was probably the easiest I've done with Disney to date. I was amazed at how effortless it was. I couldn't tell what about it changed from the last few times we've been there, but it made a difference. I'm more apt to want to stay here again after this visit. We like to try to go to as many different resorts as we can through the DVC, but I feel better about this being a fall-back option now. Great job Disney!

<Title>“QUITE DISAPPOINTED THIS VACATION”
<Content>This was our 2nd time staying at Disney's Saratoga Springs. The first tine was 4 years ago and we stayed in a 2 bedroom. This time we stayed in a Studio. The room was very dated and worn. The bathroom looked old and the tiles were dingy. We had a kitchenette which was very tiny and not very clean. The microwave was dirty. We were supplied a few paper dishes and plastic utensils. We had 2 actual glasses which were old and had a greasy feel to them. The carpet was dirty and extremely worn and overall the room was quite dingy. I was so disappointed because my prior stay was fantastic. The grounds were beautiful and we were in a room facing downtown Disney so that was amazing. We were there for President's week and this little dirty studio was $400.00 per night. Terribly overpriced. The lack of food choices is another problem. For a resort this size, they really need a larger food court with more of a selection. Most of the staff was good, however we did have some problems with staff that were eventually solved by other staff members. Overall, for the price they charged, this was not at all worth the money.

<Title>“Good for families”
<Content>Just got back from Saratoga springs resort. Good experience. Quick check in, however they didn't put us in sectioni requested (congress park). They put us in section called the paddock, which I'm sure normally is fine, but the pool in that section was closed, which is pretty annoying, it was quite a hike to pool in main section. They did have fun games up at the main pool, & a big slide my kids loved. The room itself was fine. We had a one bedroom unit, which seemed alot smaller than the pics shown. It was cozy. When the convertible sofa is pulled out there is pretty much no room to walk!! It was great to have the kitchen & washer dryer though. The room was generally clean, except I did notice hair on bathroom floor, not sure if it was housekeepers or previous occupant, gross either way, but all else was clean. Also, first night we were there I called up to get sheets, pillows & blankets to make up convertible sofa, & they told me they had a pillow shortage & I had to wait like 1&1/2 hours for the pillows!! They were very apologetic though. Anyway, had a great vacation!!!!!

<Title>“Great for families with young children”
<Content>We are big Disney vacationers. We don't have the Disney Vacation Club because I usually can find some great deals using our Annual Pass. I got a 2 bedroom for 40% with this pass. I think it ended up to be around $350/night which is very reasonable in my eyes. We've stayed at several Disney and DVC properties in the past 5 years, including Bay Lake Towers (our favorite after this trip), Key West, Wilderness Lodge, etc. Here are some of the pros and cons that I found at Saratoga Springs: Pros: - The location was nice. I loved walking or taking the boat to Downtown Disney. It is a nice area to go outside of the parks. I didn't find the travel time via buses to be that long either. - Buses were great in mid November. If you go when it's busy, the buses will be busy. But it was relatively quiet and we never had to wait long. - The cast members we experienced at the hotel were extremely nice. Especially the activities team. We had such a blast at every activity my 2.5 year old participated in. - The handled our room request to be in the Springs section and on a higher floor. - I was so worried from other reviews that the grounds were too large. I found it pretty nice. We took a bike tour one day and found it big, but not that big. Caribbean Beach Resort is MUCH bigger...at least it seems. - Grounds are beautiful - Security was always very efficient and nice. - Bell Services was probably the fastest I've ever experienced at WDW - Lots of parking Cons: - Cheap tile! I know it sounds picky but the buildings are gorgeous, and everything seems to be very detailed. However you walk into the bathroom and it looks really cheap! Just my opinion. Not a deal breaker obviously but it looked like it belonged at a Value resort. - The Grandstand section was pretty far away from most of the activities. The Springs and Congress Park were much better located. - The walk to Downtown Disney was nice....but towards the end took a random left turn and seemed to go a bit out of the way. Kind of surprised. I visited Saratoga before it was Saratoga - the Disney Institute and I remember there being a shorter path. - The washer and dryer was gross. The dryer was pretty much falling apart and very dirty. It obviously wasn't maintained. Having a toddler, we used it every other day and I had to spend some time cleaning it before we did any laundry. Never had that experience at Disney...or any hotel with washer/dryer. - The quick service was small. For it being a very quiet time of year, the lines were SUPER long. We waited an average of 30 minutes every time we visited. Sometimes more or less. I would hate to see what it looked like during a high season. - Very small store but was well stocked. - Layout says that 2 bedrooms had 2 balconies. Not the case for us. Only one. - Never got a privacty sign. Or saw one on anyone's door. - Didn't get housekeeping one day. Another day we were getting back from the parks around 2pm and housekeeping knocked on our door. I told them I was putting my daughter down for a nap and if they coudl come back in an hour. She knocked around 5 minutes later (waking my daughter up) and I asked the same thing. Maybe 20 minutes later, knocked AGAIN and I asked her to come back because she was waking up my daughter over and over again. She told me she would come back around 5pm with a second shift. Never came. I don't mind missing the housekeeping when I asked them to go because my daughter's schedule, however don't tell me one thing and never show. - Turf Club - we were excited to eat there but there was no variety! And seemed very expensive. - Not much storage for our clothes in the master bedroom - Every day the number of towels in our room got less and less. By the 8th day (our last day), we had one hand towel and maybe 3 bath towels! - The master bathroom has a very odd layout. I don't mean to be picky, but I was 11 weeks pregnant and frequently going to the bathroom in the middle of the night. It was like two "rooms" away and off on the side. Just odd. - The shower in the master bathroom is on the small side. Compared to other DVC 2 bedroom properties - Bay Lake Tower had 3 bathrooms for a 2 bedroom suite....this one only had 2. Just a note. - Twice we were kept up by the housekeeping talking and banging around outside our door. I thought it was kids but after the second day, my father got up and found that the housekeeping room was right around the corner and heard them being loud. Disappointing and unprofessional. Just a note, as I don't want to assume anything. My daughter got a pink Minnie doll from my parents in the beginning of the trip. This doll went EVERYWHERE with her. As we were packing up, she was carrying the doll and decided to follow me as I packed us up. On the way to the airport, she asks for her Minnie doll and we can't find it. Figure it has to be packed in one of the suitcases. Get home and it's not there. The last time we saw it was in the hotel room. Called Housekeeping and Lost and Found immediately....as in that afternoon we left. I gave them a description of it and our room number, even where she was when I was packing. They haven't found it. I am not pointing fingers but usually Disney is good about getting these toys back to the kids. Overall we like Saratoga Springs. It was very nice and the room was ideal for our young family. However there are some negatives that made our stay at Bay Lake Towers superior to this one. However Bay Lake is more expensive than Saratoga and a different atmosphere than the laid back style of Saratoga.

<Title>“Disney used to be great but they seem to have completely lost it.”
<Content>Just checked in today. Flight arrived at 7 pm and came to the resort via Magical Express, so the bags were "guaranteed" to arrive at the room before 10pm. The front desk clerk circled the wrong building on the map, so when we walked the considerable distance to get to the room, we walked right past the building where it was. He had circled the building next door. It's after midnight and no bags. We tried to call about the bags and neither phone in our 2 bedroom suite even has a dial tone. Called the hotel on our cell phones and they could not get anyone to answer a phone to even talk with us about the fact that our phones do not work. At 10:30 they said the bags were on the truck and would be here soon. Another call at 11:30 and they said the bell personnel were busy checking people in and they had no idea when the bags might arrive, but they would get to it as soon as they could. I asked if we could just come get it and carry it back and they said "no". Omigosh! We've been Disney Vacation Club members for nearly 10 years but I could NEVER recommend it to anyone based on this visit. Ridiculous!

<Title>“Good but could be better”
<Content>We stayed at the Saratoga Springs Resort following a Disney Cruise. The resort itself has beautiful grounds that we well kept. We had a Studio room which was about the size of average hotel room (non Disney) but bigger than what we had at other Disney resorts. Overall the Saratoga Springs Resort is a nice place to stay, but definitely isn't anything great or memorable. The rooms are bit a dated and could use some remodeling. The food court has decent options compared to some of the other Disney resorts (which surprised me I expected them to be more or less identical). We ate one night at the full service restaurant on the property and were quite "underwhelmed" given its price. On the plus side, the boat to Downtown Disney is convenient and staff was very helpful. When we checked in out the first room we were given smelled badly like it had been smoked in (yuck!) - I went to the front desk and the apologized at least 10 times and gave me a new room. In summary, is a fine place to stay - by most standards I would say its overpriced (if you are paying and not using DVC points), but that's pretty much true for anything Disney, however this lacks the feeling of being of the Disney experience. The resort is comfortable but it will be easily forgotten once you've left.

<Title>“Nice grounds. Wish it was closer to the parks.”
<Content>I had a wonderful Disney vacation in Saratoga Springs. I loved the grounds, I felt like I was in a 5 star resort. The lakes and bridges really add a great feeling to the place. The resteraunt was ok, the food tasted a little generic. The bar was excellent! You really felt like you were in a ski mountain resort with the tv, couches and pool table. It was a very relaxing way to end a long day in the parks. Outside of the convenient and nice boat ride to downtown Disney the location is a bit far. It's the only downside of the resort. It's a deluxe Disney resort but is distanced worse that most of the moderates. It was still a nice stay and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind spending the extra 10 minute bus ride to get into the parks.

<Title>“Great hotel, but...”
<Content>We stayed in a two bedroom villa at Disney's Saratoga Springs from 1/15-1/23. When we arrived at 4pm (had done online check-in before we left) we were told that our room wouldn't be available until after 7pm. However, the front desk CM quickly got my family and I into a room at what we all agreed was a better location for our family than the initial room (The Grandstand, which is much closer to the Carriage House than the resort map might suggest, and more than walkable). We were in awe of the sheer size of the property and the beauty as well. The room was fantastic if a little dated (tube TVs?; carpet could be replaced), but extremely convenient with full kitchen and full size fridge, as well as enough space for a family with twins plus their "GiGi." We were surprised at the lack of room service other than pizza delivery, which we found a little pricey ($58 for two large pies). We also sampled both dining offerings from the hotel (Turf Club Bar and Grill being far better of the two, try the "Surf and Turf" Burger, but The Artist's Palette being more convenient in a rush, I really enjoyed the Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwich), and my wife got a mani/pedi at the spa which she thought was one of the best she had ever had. There was a pool right outside our door and down an elevator, and the bus stop (first stop on SSR route) was a short walk. My only complaint about the buses are that a bus to Disney's Hollywood Studios arrive much less than the twenty minutes that is suggested by the hotel, so if you miss it, you could be waiting for a while. Overall though, I enjoyed my stay at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort: it is either a short walk or boat ride to Downtown Disney (depending on where you are staying within the resort) and is fantastic for a family looking to relax and enjoy the Magic of Walt Disney World.

<Title>“That rude maid”
<Content>Member of DVC for 9 years. Have stayed at Saratoga at least 5 times and it is nice if you want to park near your room and be away from the Disney insanity. Stayed in a studio for one night in the Paddock, 4532. Room was noisy because it is right by the street/parking, but that is also a good thing because it is a long hike to some of the rooms. Room was clean but was missing the dish soap. TVs still old tube-type. The walls seemed thin to me. I had never noticed on prior stays here, but I could hear the neighbors TV all night. My biggest complaint is that at 9:45 this morning the maid was banging at the door. I opened the door and she said "Housekeeping". I gave her a funny look and told her we are still here. She looked really put-out, and then wanted to know exactly when we would be leaving. I told her at 11:00, when we have to leave, and shut the door and took my own sweet time packing up. She then hung out down the hall and watched me as I started taking stuff out to the car. In 9 years of DVC plus many years before that staying on property, I have never had this happen to me. This isn't $39.99 on I-drive where you might expect this kind of thing. The people staying here either paid at least $15 grand for a membership or over $400.00 a night for a room. I'm 2 hours away and can go back next weekend if I want, but what about the people that flew 1000 miles and spent a years worth of savings just to have this rude lady bang on their door on a Saturday morning? I still can't believe it. Not very Disney.

<Title>“Great resort”
<Content>I highly recommend this resort to folks traveling with family. It is in the Downtown Disney area, with water shuttle to Downtown Disney. There is a beutiful golf course on the resort grounds but does not touch the actual hotel area. We are DVC members, and this was the first resort we stayed at since joining. We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa in the Springs area of the hotel. This is the closest area to the main pool and front desk. I would try and stay here every time. The villa was just spacious enough for us. we are a family of six and we brought grandma and grandpa. The next time we go we will get a 3 bed or a 2 bed and get a separate studio for the grandparents. We never waited more than 15 minutes for a bus. We were there at christmas time so i figure this is pretty good. The parks were packed. The resort was full capacity but you would never have noticed. The kids loved all of the Christmas decorations, and thestaff was super friendly as we all expect. Special notice to Hanz at the front desk. He was always helpful and can answer any question you have w/out any delay. Saratoga will go down as one of our favorites.

<Title>“The Mods are better”
<Content>We were really surprised with how much we disliked this disney resort. We liked our previous stay at the mod's better. We rented some DVC points from a member and stayed in a studio. We were given our room and it wasn't made up from the previous guest. It was so gross. The staff seemed bothered when I called to tell them about it. We were eventually given a new room in an area where the pool and bus stop was closed. It was really disappointing for Disney. The rooms need major updating. Our last stay on property was the Beach Club and the Beach Club far surpassed SSR. We have stayed at other vacation club properties for other companies, mainly Marriott, and Disney's {at least this one} doesn't compare at all! It's in need of major updating.

<Title>“Quiet, Friendly, and Full of Fun”
<Content>I have stayed here many times and it is always a great stay. It can be a ride on the buses to the parks, but they have made the service much better over the years, including having employees with radios at all the stops during busy times, our past stay only had one longer (25-30 min, usually 5-15) wait for the bus You can walk, take a bus, or take a boat to Downtown Disney from here, and the Lake Buena Vista golf course and range are located in the hotel. If you want a room closer to the main building request the Springs or Grandstand, Springs is closest to the theme pool, arcade, and community hall, which is full of free fun like coloring, ping pong/foosball, and even Wii and Playstations you can play there. A new large theme pool is to be opened this summer at the Paddocks area, which is great even though I never found to be the current one to be that crowded! Villas are great, standard Disney villa designs and Disney clean. Overall a great Disney Deluxe Villa choice, although not the place for you if you want a fireworks view, and it is a quieter, more homey resort when compared to ones like the Boardwalk or Beach Club. Spa and health club are great too!

<Title>“Amazing resort!”
<Content>We had a fabulous time at Sarasota Springs. We had a one-bedroom villa in the "Congress Hall" section, which overlooks the water and Downtown Disney. It's also on the walking path to Downtown Disney and ended up being just a ten-minute walk to all the restaurants and shops. Since we intended to eat and shop there, this was great for our family. The hotel also has a bus and boat shuttle to that area as well and our kids loved riding the boat at night. The pool in our section was warm enough for swimming although I saw tons of kids in the main pool by the lobby area as well so that was presumably warm too. We had one rainy day during our stay and took advantage of the pool by our room, the kids craft projects in the community hall, and the spa. Their grocery store had everything we needed for breakfast food and snacks, we got great take-out pizzas from their Artists' Palette Cafe, and we had our best dinner of the entire trip in the sit down restaurant there. We had stayed at Old Key West on a prior visit and weren't sure how SS would compare, but I think it's a close tie. We'd definitely be happy to stay at either SS or OKW again. SS is beautiful, offers lots for young kids, is close to Downtown Disney, has great views (at least from where we stayed), is very clean, and quiet.

<Title>“When in a tree house make sure you don't get hit by golf balls”
<Content>We stayed in a new Tree House...they are great and spacious however we had to move as the one we were in was being hit by golf balls. There is a seating area outdoors and my daughter had golf balls sailing past her head. We complained and were left several hours....when we went to reception the guy in charge seemed to think it was funny ! A ball sailed straight past my father's head having and hit the front doot hard as we packed to leave for another treehouse. Our 5 year old was also narrowly missed....we had golfers under the tree house looking for their balls. Tree house was pitted with holes where it had clearly been hit hard in the past ....an accident in the making for sure

<Title>“Not up to the Disney Name”
<Content>Where to begin - we are DVC members, and this is our home resort. We booked a trip for our once in a lifetime family reunion in January of 2010. We booked 2 -2 bedroom villas for our family and my husband's brother and family. We have 2 guests with disabilities - so made a request, 11 months in advance, that the rooms be at The Springs (near pool and food court). We arrive, as scheduled, on the day after Christmas. Our room was not only not ready, they were unable to have the 2 rooms in the same building!!!! They smiled their Disney Smiles, and basically told us that they were sorry, but there wasn't anything they could do. My husband took it in stride, and agreed to be put in a room far away from amenities in exchange for rooms next to or across from one another. So SS moved our room, and off we went to rent a car so we could get to and from the pool and food ($500 + for the week)!!!!! The next day, our relatives were finally able to get in due to the blizzard. When they checked in at 10p - their room was across the campus in The Paddock. Again, Disney smiles with an "I'm sorry, there isn't anything we can do". They settled to getting some sleep and allowing us to handle it in the morning. Their room was dirty, with dirty linens in the tub and stains on the carpet. Again with the "I'm sorry". In the morning, I went to the front desk, spending greater than 2 hours to finally facilitate a room change for my in-laws to a room in the same building, not the same side or floor. Again, smiles and "I'm sorry, but there isn't anything we can do". I specifically asked if their keys would need to be changed when they changed rooms and was told no, so off to the parks we went - happily to EPCOT for a dinner package for all 10 of us, followed by the Candlelight Processional and special viewing for Illuminations. All was well until we went to pay for the package at dinner (we were on the dining plan). My brother-in-law's card was declined!!! I seems that when they re-assigned the room, all the keys were cancelled. Nice. This pretty much highlights the good parts. I could mirror what other's have said about the slow buses that make you wait in the elements (in our case freezing temps). The rooms are more than showing wear, and heard many stories about walking into rooms that were already occupied. Overall, the difficulties we had were just basic hotel/motel issues that should have been made right by the staff. They missed every opportunity for this, and I found this the overwhelming theme at this resort. I am a self-proclaimed Disneymaniac, yet this hotel and staff is more than a disappointment. Consider my timeshare to be for sale.

<Title>“Fantastic Holiday”
<Content>If you like Disney then you cant go wrong - just a few min from Downtown disney (some parts of the hotel take about twenty min). Rooms are great, spacious and very comfortable. Staff are excellent, loads of pools to choose from. Busses to parks can some times take a awhile but not a major thing. All in it was a fantastic experince and would recommend to anyone.

<Title>“Disney Does it Up Grand!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Saratoga Springs in a 1 bedroom suite from Dec 3-9, 2010. We found the accomodations very spacious and comfortable and the grounds and facilities at the resort were top notch. Visiting the hot tub in the evening after a long (and cold) day at the parks was a great end to the day! We backed onto the lagoon across from Downtown Disney which made the evenings quiet and relaxing. We had daily cleaning services and coffee was provided. If you are planning to cook any meals you will have to bring any types of spices, salt and pepper, etc. as those are not provided. All in all, we had a great stay at Saratoga Springs!

<Title>“Outstanding DVC property”
<Content>Saratoga Springs is a hidden gem in the DVC universe. One of the latest standalone DVC hotels built at WDW, Saratoga Springs stands out due to its rooms (gigantic, and still smelling of new), golf course views, and swimming pool. Service and restaurants are average at best, with the cafeteria (Artist's Palette) offering very limited menu options, mostly around flatbreads. I recommend it due to overall value, especially for longer stays or ir you are traveling with an extended party.

<Title>“Needs some updating!”
<Content>This is out family's 4th ot 5th time staying at the Saratoga Springs Hotel. The property itself is nice and very well located right next to Downtown Disney. We always stay in a 2-bedroom unit and it is spacious and well laid out. The units are quiet so no sleep disturbances. The only real negative is that the units are starting to show wear. The drawers and carpets are beginning to be worn out. Cleanlness could also be improved. The restaurant onsite is fair at best but the spa is excellent.

<Content>A few initial booking in problems were resolved speedily and with absolute professionalism which totally over-rode the inconvenience. I have never been anywhere where ALL the staff were so professional until we came to Saratoga Springs.The 2 bed suites we stayed in had all we needed and more. You would be hard pressed to stay in a better resort in my humble opinion!

<Title>“Nice hotel, but check in problems.”
<Content>We stayed here for three nights. The resort is very large, but nice. The restruant (Turf Bar and Grill) is nice, actually my favorite of our trip during which we had the disney dining plan. The hotel rooms are clean, large. We had a one bedroom that had a nice jacuzzi tub and a full kitchen which we didn't need, but would be nice if you came with family to save money on food expenses as obviously the food in the parks is price. Bus service to the parks was pretty good and not too crowded from the parks, possibly due tothe time of year we visited. The magical express to and from the park was great, especially checking your bags in for the flight home from the hotel was very convinient. The main issue we had with the hotel was with the check-in. Our first day we arrived before the room was ready so we went to the park. We got home around 10PM and went to check-in and get our room. They gave us our key and we went to our hotel room. When we opened the door there was a half-naked man standing in the room as we had been given a double booked room. We had to go back to the front desk to get another room. We were given an slightly larger room and an appology with an explanation they have a new computer reservation system that has been having problems. It wasn't that big of a deal, but i was a little nervous entering a room where people were, I wouldn't have been surprised had we been attacked entering someone's room.

<Title>“Disney Vacation Club is overrated!”
<Content>I went with friends who owned a vacation club. We arrived on a very busy Sunday and check in lines were way too long from; employees who are either new, or still being trained. Unacceptable during peak season. Room assigned smelled of bleach and it took 2 more hours of waiting around to be assigned another room. Manager nicely comped us with food vouchers for our delay. Our one bedroom was fine, but it was far away from the lobby/restaurant and High Rock Springs pool, but closer to downtown Disney. (10 minute walk, much faster than waiting for a slow bus.) Buses were habitually slow and when they finally arrive were always packed. Strollers usually took up passenger room. At end of evenings when the parks closed it took an hour to return to Saratoga Springs. Several buses would depart the resort bus stop- filled, then another 20 minute wait for a return bus. Unacceptable. When the temperature is 38 degrees, waiting for a Disney bus gets bone chilling cold! You could stay off property and get back to your hotel in less time than staying at over-priced resort property. The room was also cold, no matter how high the heat was turned up, it was never warm inside. The sofa bed should not be considered as accomodations for 2 people. For one person is was uncomfortable and past its use. There were large stains on each of the 2 sofa cushions. The TV's were outdated-- old fashioned tube types. I would NOT EVER consider buying into a Disney Vacation Club. Though there are hundreds of sales people very eager to talk you into listening to their sales pitch all over Disney parks and resorts. The Vacation owners get less services than people who come in off the street. If you are staying as a vacation owner, towels and soap are replaced once a week. If you are there as a hotel guest, your room is made up everyday. Vacation club owners have to do their own cleaning. One day I asked the maid to clean crumbs that were on the sofa bed left by prior guest and she just swept them with her hand onto the rug but did not vacume the rug. Housekeeping gets a failing grade at Saratoga Springs. We left our room cleaner than it was upon arrival.

<Title>“Leaves a lot to be desired at this price.”
<Content>This place is huge....Front desk help was not up to par. Buses took too long during the freeze we had while there. The signage at the resort was terrible. They seriously need to put up a highly visible sign on the bus route at the Springs stop that says "Check-in" as well as a sign more clearly marking the walkway at Congress Park to Downtown Disney. I saw so many people get off at The Springs and wander around looking for ways to get to the restaurants up at the check-in/Lobby area. A simple sign with this info including the words "Check-in/Registration", and restaurant names with an arrow pointing to the pathway up there would be nice. It's very confusing and especially so at night. They should also give out a detailed sheet with more specific bus info such as each bus stop highlighting the fact that "The Springs" is where one would need to get off for the lobby/check-in or restaurants. We totally missed our stop our first night back from the parks,ended up having to ride all the way back to the parks and wait in the freezing cold for another bus back to SS.....it was horrible! The small trams (golf cart limos) that transported visitors at night back to their rooms were freezing and even though they had plastic sides that could have been put down, they chose to let their visitors freeze instead of doing what would have been more practical....unrolling the sides for protection. I couldn't get over how inconsiderate that was....even when it was raining slightly. Needless to say, SS will never be on our list of "resort" stays. Oh...and while the sit-down restaurant was really great, the fast service one was horrible in food choices. Someone needs to seriously re-do those menus.

<Title>“Saratoga Springs 1 bedroom suite-amazing quality, though location is a bit far from all things Disney”
<Content>I've long put off this review but have been meaning to give credit to SS! We are a family of 3- 2 adults and a 4 year old, traveled late April into early May. We stayed 7 nights in a 1 BR suite- we were located in the Springs section-requested ahead of time. We did online check in-there was no line at 1 pm when we arrived-smooth sailing to get our info and room cards. Our little guy was on his 1st trip-got a pin and a voice mail from Goofy in the room-very cool. BOTTOM LINE- loved it- we lucked out as we traded through RCI- I could not have afforded 7 nights here at standard DVC resort pricing- I would return-great experience in all areas- it is less "Disney" than other resorts...more sophisticated- my 4 year old did not notice but it has less whimsy than many of the other resorts. Again- loved it and would return. The ROOM- BEAUTIFUL and COMFORTABLE! The Master bed was comfy, blankets decent quality-pillows were OK. The whole suite was very clean and well appointed. Son used the pull out couch to sleep-so I don't know how comfy that would be for an adult. Kitchen had any materials we needed, though we purchased the Disney dining plan (HIGHLY recommend) we did have the Garden Grocer deliver some snacks, fresh fruit, coffee and cream and we used the kitchen minimally for this. There was an entry foyer b/f actually entering our living area- this was perfect for "parking the stroller" every day-it stayed out of our way. washer and dryer-excellent perk for any family-we easily washed 5 loads of laundry-towels, etc. balcony was small but comfortable--looked over street and landscaped grounds- plentiful trees, flowers and saw many bunnies. FOOD- was ok- the selection is a bit limited in comparison to other DVC properties-nothing we ate was bad-it was all tasty-but limited selection. The on site store was small but adequate. I loved that we could grab breakfast plates (waffles, eggs, whatever) and walk them right out to High Rock Springs- the pool area. We ate meals by the pool frequently. The POOL- probably 2nd best (after Disney Yacht and Beach)- exceptional- always found a lounger or shade as needed. water slides were a blast for kids and adults. The showed movies by the pool int he evening- we went for night swimming-4 year old loved it! BUSES- yes- you are far from most of the Disney areas you plan to visit- this was our 1st trip without a car-I won't rent a car again. the wait for buses was fine as long as you planned ahead and built in the travel time. We always waited 15-20 minutes fro a bus. Downtown Disney is the closet stop-it is within walking distance along a nice path if you have the time-we walked back from Ghirradeli one evening with ice cream cones:) We rode the bus to MK and would hop on other transportation as needed. Our longest trips from SS were Animal Kingdom and Typhoon Lagoon. Buses on the SS route were clean and air conditioned-unlike some of the other bus runs. LOCATION- ok...so you are a bit far from most things Disney- my spouse feels that this is what would hinder a return trip-staying closet to MK or Epcot would be ideal for us. Was it unreasonable? No- I would indeed stay here again.

<Content>There were 8 of us who stayed here for a week in August this past summer. The resort was beautiful. The maid service was always right there whenever you needed them. The food at the resort is very good! We would go out to the parks and then come back to the room to relax. It was nice to come back to the resort - we could lay by the pool and they always had some kind of activity going on. We didn't have any complaints staying here and would travel here again!

<Title>“Terrible!”
<Content>Ok so here we go. We arrived and they had our room checked to someone else. Then they gave us another room. Too bad someone else was there. When we finally got there we had to wait 5 hours for our bags to arrive. Next day we get to our park and they have forgotten to put our park tickets and meal tickets on our cards. This place is a joke. I know the reviews have been mostly good but I would stay at a motel 6 over this any day. We have been to Disney world multiple times to several resorts but this was awful. They gave us a couple of fast pass vouchers but waiting in line for the rides would have taken a quarter of the time as waiting for them to fix their errors. Oh yeah this is only day 2 of 10 so who knows what will happen next....

<Title>“Great if you do not mind waiting for buses and long bus rides.”
<Content>We just got back on December 4 after a 5 night stay. Overall, the room was fine but the transportation was horrid. Numerous times, we waited 30 minutes or longer to catch a bus to the parks. We new coming in that it was the longest distance from the parks of all the hotels, but we did not think we would have to waste so much time waiting for them. The other problem is that since it is one of the larger properties, the buses were usually overstuffed. If you have a yound child with a stroller, it's all the more difficult.

<Title>“Fun for family”
<Content>We stayed here because we have the vacation club points in Disney so we chose this hotel. It's very a big and offers a lot of different views depending on the room you stay in. I like that there are bus stops everywhere around the hotel to be taken to the Disney parks. This was nice since we were traveling with a baby and convienience is what we needed! The pools here are so nice and offer a lot for everyone in the family. Both restaurants are nice too!

<Title>“Disney Treehouse Villas - Gotta try them!”
<Content>We just returned from 7-day Thanksgiving trip to Disney and we stayed at the Treehouse Villas, which are a part of Saratoga Springs. We are not DVC members, so we were apparently very lucky that we were able to "rent" one over the holidays. There were 9 of us in our party and we had plenty of room with the 3 bedrooms and extra living room sleeping accomodations. 2 bedrooms had queen beds and the 3rd had bunk beds. Couch in the living room converted to a queen-sized bed and there was a sleeper chair that converted to a twin. The extra space was great, although we didn't spend much time there, other than to sleep. Was nice not to have to worry about the kids stomping about and distrubing neighbors, though. I agree with others that it makes getting to and from the parks a little harder, with the mulitple bus transfers, but the extra space and privacy was a decent trade-off. Just give yourself plenty of time to go back and forth - especially if you have dining reservations. If you have a large group (up to 9) and don't want to pay for one of the really expensive 12-people villas, this is a great option.

<Title>“Fantastic Resort”
<Content>We are DVC members and have stayed at this resort every year since it opened. This year as with every year we stayed at the Paddocks, we had a 1 bed appt on the top floor, overlooking the lake and bridge that takes you across to the main centre. I cannot recommend the resort enough, it is so handy for Downtown Disney, the bus & boat service is excellent. A special mention to Clint, the manager of the shop on site, who was so helpful when some of our packages went missing from the Christmas shop at Downtown, he was so helpful and polite ( and he's a dead ringer for Stephen Baldwin). Also the front desk were also really helpful, checking us in for our return flight and printing our boarding passes. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff here. the housekeepers always have a smile and a wave for you. We have stayed at many of the other DVC resorts and this is defintely our favourite. Stay here and you will have a magical time :)

<Title>“Saratoga - A Beautiful Place to Stay At Disney World”
<Content>My family and I (12 of us in all) had enough points to stay for 10 days in a Grand Villa. There were rooms and beds for all and very, very comfortable. We have also stayed in two bedrooms over the years. Saratoga has a special magic all of its own. There is nothing more beautiful than to open the long drapes covering the two-story window and seeing the spectacular lights of Downtown Disney just across the lake. With windows closed, it is quiet - we had no problem sleeping with DTD nearby. With windows open, you hear the crowds of laughter and the music that wafts in from the many restaurants at DTD. We love Saratoga Springs lobby, Artist Palette, and the Spa. The decor is beautiful, the pools are always clean and inviting and the hot-tubs have never presented a problem. This resort is so easy to navigate - lots of sidewalks for bikes and pedestrians, great bus stops with benches, clearly marked paths for those wishing to walk to DTD. The only time we did not appreciate our villa was when we were given a handicapped room. The kitchen did not have the normal space nor did the bathrooms due to the extra room needed for wheelchair accessibility. Other than that, we have been extremely happy to have this gorgeous resort as our home resort.

<Title>“Surprised how much I enjoyed it”
<Content>I recently spent a week in a studio at the Saratoga Springs Resort at WDW. I am a Disney Vacation Club member that usually stays at Boardwalk or the Beach Club, both with easy access to Epcot and Hollywood Studios. I was not able to book into either of these resorts so I settled for Saratoga Springs (SSR) and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. SSR is a very large resort encompassing numerous sections. I stayed in the Grandstand Section which was an easy walk to the main resort where the restaurants are located. It had it's own "quiet pool" with a pool bar and it was also the first stop for the Disney buses when they were going to or from the parks. This was a very nice feature as it assured you a seat on the bus even when it was crowded. SSR is also only a short walk or a boat ride to Downtown Disney which offers a number of restaurant choices. In the spa there is a very complete gym with state of the art aerobic equipment and free weights and machines. There are walking trails along the golf course for early morning walks and there is also a "Nature Trail" that connects SSR to other Disney resorts. The resort is on the Lake Buena Vista golf course and as such, it has access to a driving range and a putting green, making this a good choice for a Disney Golf Vacation (which I'm doing next January). All in all it was a very enjoyable stay and I look forward to going back again. The only reason not to give it 5 stars is that if you are not near everything then it can take quite a long time to get around it given it's size.

<Title>“great place to stay”
<Content>we stayed in a 2 bed villa room no 1810 which was on the top floor overlooking downtown disney specifically directly opposite fultons crab house the view was amazing but no noise was heard from downtown disney the housekeeping was first rate the room lovely clean and spacious one slight criticism would be the outdated tv and channel choice and the sofa bed wasnt very comfortable when used as a sofa ,never used as a bed so cant comment we had a hire car so getting around was no problem security made you feel very safe and welcome we were on this disney dining plan and ate at the turf club bar and grill 3 times out of 12 nights it was fist rate in both food and service the artists pallette however was a bit of a nightmare for breakfast really long lines to order and then to pay and then to pick up food at least 10 -20 minutes each queue 3 times really bad system needs to be sorted place is too small for the size of the resort and after a couple of days we ate breakfast elsewhere as i say we had a car so no probs but if you didnt?.....

<Title>“Stunning for the price - worth every penny”
<Content>We stayed here for 17 nights with disney dining plan included for £1700, the hotel itself was in good shape and every day they were decorating something. So maintanance was being done all the time but very quietly as not to disturb but keeping it in tip top condition. It was wonderful and quiet so you can easily relax but each building has a bus stop and therefore only a minute or two walk to the bus stopp and a free bus to whereever you are going. Most buses were there in under 20 minutes but a couple of times it took longer but not much a wonderful service. All the staff were friendly all the time bar one. This really nice lady on the gate was helpful every day but one she was rude but maybe she just had to deal with something bad who knows but it did not deter from our enjoyment in any way. Just over the way from downtown disney so we walked there most nights. Overall a really nice place and based on other hotels I would say this really was a bargin at those prices.

<Title>“Brilliant Stay”
<Content>stayed at Saratoga Springs from 5th October for 14 nights. We were a party of 3 and stayed in Congress Park in a one-bedroom apartment. Congress Park is a quiet area on the resort and has its own pool and jacuzzi area which was also an excellent place to relax (towels provided at the pool). The apartment was perfect for our needs and very well equipped. However, the apartment could have been cleaner as we found tomato ketchup on the skirting board around the breakfast bar and a some dusty areas on furniture (and this was not attended to during our stay). However, on the whole, the apartment was just what we needed. Large bathroom with spa bath and a large separate shower room, full kitchen facilities and dining table/breakfast bar, also washing machine and tumble dryer etc. We used the Disney transport most days and we did not wait too long for any of the services to the parks. The resort is also very close to Downtown Disney - only a 10 minute walk and also boat ride every 20 minutes. Staff were very friendly and helpful and check in and check out was very smooth. We found the Disney Dining Plan excellent value. We did not dine at the resort (Turf Club), however we did dine at the Flying Fish (Boardwalk), Le Chef de France (Epcot), California Grill (Contemporary hotel), to mention but a few - all on the dining plan and all excellent. One thing to note is that you will need to book well in advance (i.e. at least 4- 6 months before flying as we could not book some of our choices, i.e. Cinderellas Castle at Magic Kingdom). All in all, we had a wonderful stay and could not fault this resort at all. We will be back !

<Title>“Couldn't Fault it !”
<Content>We arrived here for our 21 night stay on Friday 10 September 2010. Although the check in buidling was very pleasant, we did struggle to understand the member of staff who checked us in as her English was very poor, but we got there in the end and after an initial problem with our 21 day Disney Ultimate Tickets, we were allocated room number 8621 in the Granstand. We were early to check in (around 12:00) and were initially told our room wasn't ready until 16:00 hours, but I think because of the hanging around we had to do, they moved us to another building and we therefore managed to get access to our 2 bedroom villa immediately after. It took us a while to find our ' block ' as Saratoga Springs is huge - although beautiful to walk around by the golf course. Our room was on the first floor in the Grandstand and directly near the Grandstand swimming pool and by the pool there was a water play area which was fantastically themed. We were also close to the Granstand bus stop which is great as you are first to be picked up and first to be dropped off ( note there are 5 bus stops in SS). Couldnt fault the bus service at all, not much waiting around. Saratoga Springs has 3 pools, the main one has two slides, a larger one and a smaller one for infants. The main pool was busier than the one outside our room so we tended to use this one every day - some of the time we were the only ones around the pool. There is also a bar by the Granstand pool which only opened towards the end of our stay - maybe when the respost gets businer - although it didnt seem busy any of the time ! You can buy a selection of drinks and also refill Disney mugs here. The food court (Artists Palette) is located near where you check in and is always spotlessly clean with attentive and very polite staff. I must say the staff in SS were the best we have encountered at any WDW resort. One thing to mention about the food court is that it doesnt seem to do substantial meals, you cant get burgers or fast food there at all - not a real problem to us - but sometimes if you wanted something other than a large turkey filled ciabatta or sandwich, you would have to go elsewhere like Downtown Disney. SS is opposite Downtown Disney and there are two ways you can actually walk there which was great for us as we do a lot of walking and exercise at home. The main path takes you to the Market Place and is well signposted on all the maps, but there is another path that you can access near where you can get the boat, which after a 10 minute walk you arrive near Cirque du Soleil at the other end. However, if walking isn't for you, you can always take the bus or the boat to the Downtown area. We ate in the Turf club once (which is the restaurant located behind Artists Palette), the service and the food was very good, with a fair amount to choose from like steak, burgers, crab cakes etc. We also hired one of the Surrey bikes for half an hour and rode around SS 3 times, but be warned on a hot day its quite hard work !! The cost around $20. One afternoon there was a storm which went on into the evenining, so we got a DVD - which we were told as we weren't Vacation members was free to rent (up to 3 per night) so that was a pleasant surprise. The two bedroom villa we had was huge, it doesnt feel small and even though there was 4 adults and two children, we didnt feel we were all in each others way. Each bedroom has its own bathroom with a jacuzzi type bath and large separate shower just off bedroom one. Each bedroom has its own TV and the living area has a TV plus DVD player. The alarm clock in bedroom one also had an iPod dock which means you can play your own music if you like. One of the few negatives about the kitchen is that it doesnt have a kettle, so if you want a cup of tea, you either have to boil water in the microwave or via the coffee maker ! The only negative was the houskeeping, it doesnt seem to be as good as even the Moderate or Valur resorts, most days it was the bare minimum done which seemed to get worse as our stay went on. Examples or poor housekeeping was not leaving filter coffee or toiletries etc. We also left a tip every day during our holiday and one day we left 2 x $50 on the table in the bedroom by mistake which we found out was taken by the member of staff cleaning our room that day thinking it was a tip !! We got it back though and she apologised for her ' error '. Also, coming from the UK, SS does not sell phone cards (like some other WDW resorts do) and you cannot dial international numbers from the pay phones using coins. I did get a quote to call home using a credit card which would have cost around $30 for a few minutes which I didnt bother with. I wouldnt recommend dialling overseas from the room phones as they are horrendously expensive as we learnt to our cost during a previous visit. Best thing to do is to buy a mobile phone from one of the supermarkets as this is much cheaper. Overall our three weeks were fabulous at this resport and we will not hesitate to go back when we re-visit WDW. The only negative

<Title>“Nobody does it like Disney”
<Content>This beautiful and immaculate resort is near Downtown Disney. The theme of the resort is the horse racing era surrounding Saratoga Springs, New York. As usual, Disney is spot on with details, quality, and amenities. The only downside was the layout and location of this property. The vacation villas are spaced so far apart that walking to the foodcourt was a real hike. Upon check in, the hostess actually recommended that we drive to the food court and to Downtown Disney despite advertising that Downtown was within easy walking distance. The place is HUGE and sprawling, beautifully landscaped, and quiet. The only transport option is the bus - you can also take a water taxi to Downtown Disney but you have to walk a good distance to the dock (at least we did from the Paddock area). We are very used to the Boardwalk Villas - within easy walking to EPCOT and boat to Hollywood Studios. While Saratoga Springs is beautiful, next time we'll go to Boardwalk.

<Title>“Brilliant”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel 24th September for 14 nights. We booked directly with Disney and got a great deal for our park tickets and free dining plan (which I would reccommend to anyone) were originally meant to be staying at port Orleans riverside but were given the option to upgrade to ssr or old key west. We chose a 1 bed villa. Upon getting the magical express from mco we arrived around 40 minutes later to the hotel it was absolutely stunning - we were greeted welcome home by a lovely man called Nick. When booking we had requested a room close to bus stop as I'm in a wheelchair and would be easier. Nick didn't think we were close enough so moved us to The Grandstand area. Which I would recommend bus stop, reception and a pool were moments from our doorstep. Our room was massive considering it was just the 2 of us- the bath tub is amazing. The Mousekeepers were amazing too every day we left them a little tip and when we came home from a crazy day at the parks our room was spotless they had even put the dishwasher on. Every member of staff we came across was very friendly especially a lady called Jill who was great helping us try to find Disney miniture golf. 1 thing I would say is don't make any phone calls from your room we made 3 calls lasting a total of 7 minutes and it cost us $80. we got a phone card from a nearby pharmacy. The Disney buses were great also- they longest we waited was 20 minutes for a bus to Epcot the night it was open late with extra magic hours. Another great perk of staying with Disney. I would recommend this place to everyone it was an amazingly beautiful hotel with stunning grounds (always a gardener tidying up), lovely little restaurant - lovely mickey waffles, friendly staff and a great atmosphere without being overly disney. So close to all other Florida attractions: universal-20 mins, seaworld/discovery cove/ aquatica-15 Florida malls- 25-30.

<Content>My family really loved Saratoga Springs Resort. We stayed there during our Disney vacation. We landing in Orlando and were ushered to the Magical Express that brought us right to the resort. We never had to worry about our luggage, they delivered it for us to our room. The entire resort is beautiful and we really loved our room. Everyone is so nice and helpful. The pool was very nice after a hot Florida day. My family would love to go back asap!

<Title>“Spacious Rooms and a Sense of Luxury”
<Content>Saratoga Springs was a luxurious Disney Resort. Being a family of six, it was hard to find an affordable hotel where we could all fit in one room. The rooms at Saratoga proved to be more than enough space. We had 3 separate rooms; 1 bedroom containing 2 Queen-sized beds and a bathroom with a shower, the master bedroom with a separate bathtub, a shower in its own room and a toilet it its own room, and a living room area with a spacious kitchen and seating area and tv. The separate bathroom thing was super helpful during our trip because 3 people were able to bathe at once, which really helped move things along on those late nights or early mornings. And with three separate TVs, it allowed for some much needed quiet time! We loved the pool and the various events held at the hotel each night. Also, its proximity to downtown disney was convenient, although it was a long bus ride to most other parks. Overall, it was a great experience.

<Title>“Beautiful resort with one or two exceptions”
<Content>Stayed here 14 nights from 24/09/2010 to 08/10/2010. Travelled with wife, daughter 22 and son 5. The resort is very nice with landscaped gardens, pools at each of the main complexes and of plenty of lakes and fountains. Bus services with one exception were frequent and not as crowded as someof the other resorts. The resort was quiet and understated Disney. We stayed in the Grandstand and this is an ideal location as it is the 1st step for all returning buses from the parks. Room service was daily and the room was always clean upon return with fresh towels, soaps / shampoo and washing up liquid left when required. My main disappointment was the room. We booked a studio and whilst I could not fault this for cleanliness it was perhaps of the standard of 3*+ / 4 Star room you would get at a Thistle, Marriott, etc, nothing exceptional. The Kitchenette had a microwave, coffee maker, toaster and fridge but not rings or oven. The Artist's Pallette did get busy mid morning for breakfast with quite long waiting times. We did not use the Turf Club restaurant so am unable to comment on this. Staff were always polite and tried to be helpful. Laundry washers and dryers free Overall the resort, the Disney Service and it's proximity to EPCOT, Hollwood Studios and Downtown Disney makes this a perfect place to stay. The room was perfectly adequate given how much time we spent in it but given it was branded Deluxe a little disappointing in it's standard. The quick counter restaurant (Artists) was a good place to have breakfast but queues could be long at times These two niggles aside I would recommend this as place to enjoy a quiet and relaxing holiday with the standards of service you would expect from Disney Some tips from our expereince - Request the Grandstand or Springs these are the 1st stops from the park (Grandstand) or last stop before going to the parks (Springs) If you are on the Disney Dining Plan book you must do's before travelling, we had to go to Cinderella's castle 5 times before getting in, the Sci-Fi Diner 4 times and couldnot get into Chef Mickey's (Character Breakfast) at all. Get you fast pass for Toy Story Mania as soon a possible after park opens. Most were issued by 10.30 am and wait times were two hours in standby line. Seat yourself at least 1 hour before Fantasmic if you want a good seat If you have children who wish to do the Jedi Academy be prepared for a long wait only 15 at a time are selected and each show is around 1 hour apart. Even in quite times wait times were around 2 hours. You can get the 50 bus from Downtown Disney Direct to Seaworld $4.50 return, Universal requires 3 buses but still $4.50 Mickey's not so scary haloween a must

<Title>“Nice...just too big and not quite disney enough!”
<Content>I stayed at Saratoga springs in September. It's nice and comfortable, but not really anything particularly special. It's very big (I think there was something like 5 bus stops) which means you often end up lost and it takes a while to get everywhere. Considering the fact that this resort is HUGE there really was not much going on...just a couple of pools and a shop. It lacked the magic of other Disney hotels. In the past we have stayed in the beach club which is on the boardwalk...I would highly recommend this area of Disney as it feels like a little village and all the hotels and restaurants and nice and charming...plus it's a great location...so close to epcot and hollywood studios! I think saratoga springs would be good for larger groups who need a villa...but although it's pleasant you should thoroughly explore all options!

<Content>Saratoga Springs is a beautiful resort! Lots of walking space, ponds, and things to do. The buildings are nice and the room was huge, clean and overall perfect. The staff is very friendly and so are the guests. Very close to downtown disney, and fast bus services to the parks. Pools were clean, relaxing and not too busy. This resort is a wonderful place, great for families, or couples. I would recomend Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa to anyone and everyone!!! Have fun =)

<Title>“Congress Park Villa Room”
<Content>Stayed in 1134 which was a 10 min walk to down town disney and the link for public buses. I would not chose anywhere else to stay in this resort due to it's location not only to downtown disney but also to the hotel reception and restaurant. The restaurant was ok. I am a vegetarian and 99% of the food did not suit me so I tended to eat elswhere. The room service was daily and soap powder was daily in the first week. This stopped for some reason but a quick call to reception and we got delivered six packs 30 min later. There is no internet access at this hotel and when i asked at the hotel reception I was told about another hotel which had business facitlities (cant remeber which). The room did have a internet cable if you bring your lap top but you can get internet at disney quest. The rooms were large. It is a double pull out couch bed in the main living area and a king size in the main bedroom. The bathroom was huge also. it had a separate room for the spa bath with washbasin, another room with a shower and washbasin which led to the wc. You do not need to go throught he room with the bath to get to the wc just the shower room. Air con is available in each room also. The room I was in did not get any direct sun, which made it it a bit duller but due to the hot weather it was nice and cooler. As we had the disney dining plan (which I recommend) we did not use the cooker but stored water in the fridge/freezer.

<Title>“What a Magical Place”
<Content>We stayed in the Congress Park opposite Downtown Disney. The bus stop was a 2 minute walk away and never very busy as was the quiet pool which was fantastic. Downtown disney took us about 5 minutes to walk to. We did not think it was a massive place, it only took about 4 minutes to walk to the main reception/artist palette etc. The room was amazing we stayed in a 2 bedroom villa. There were 6 of us. 4 adults and 2 teenagers. The maid cleaned every day. She even packed the dishwasher and switched it on daily, left clean towels, dishwasher tablets and soap powder for the washing machine. We could not have asked for more. We all agreed that it was a fantastic base, close to everywhere. None of the parks seemed a long way away and even Universal Studios etc were about a 15minute drive away. Ideal!!!! If anybody has booked to stay here you will not be disappointed and we are all very jealous.

They also have items such as cereal, pop tarts and wine to take back to your room. The room has a mini fridge, microwave, toaster, and coffee maker. There were also paper plates and bowls in the room above the kitchenette sink. All employees were very friendly and helpful. The room was cleaned everyday with plenty of clean towels left in the room. I would stay again and recommend.

<Title>“AWESOME LONG WEEKEND @ SARATOGA SPRINGS”
<Content>This was our first time staying @ Saratoga, and we got a great deal through the website "David's Disney Vacation Rentals". They provide a service where you can rent directly from a DVC member. It is especially great for last minute deals if you live in Florida! We rented 2 studios, which were located near a pool, playground and bus stop. There was a lovely boardwalk across the lake to the main pool and restaurants.The main pool is amazing, with a large waterslide, and a smaller slide for the little ones. They also have a great "splash area" with donald duck and a small waterfall! Our kids had a great time checking out the property for all the hidden mickeys, and the staff was happy to help! The only drawback to this resort is that there are only 2 restaurants on property. We took the free boat ferry to downtown Disney the second day to find some dining options (try Wolfgang Puck Express...delicious and inexpensive). The service and activities provided are what you would expect from Disney...exceptional! We had a lovely time. After reading the previous review, I am a little baffled as to what the reviewer's point was?? Yes, when you go to public places, you will see people of all shapes, sizes, cultures, etc... Not a problem to our family. My only complaint is when adults feel the need to wear t-backs to a Disney resort! I just love trying to explain to my 2 year old why "that lady's butt is hanging out...did she forget her pants? :)". I didn't see any "scary crowd"...just a lot of families, young and old. No crowds at this time of year, so it was a great weekend. We would definitely stay there again. And we will absolutely use David's DVC service again...we look forward to checking out all the other DVC properties.

<Title>“Wonderful Resort/Location”
<Content>We were lucky enough to be offered a complimentary upgrade from Disney, from our usual resort - POR, and they had also given us a one bed villa for just the two of us. we had walked around this resort on a previous occasion, but until now hadnt thought about changing from Riverside. On check in we were allocated a room at the Springs Section near the Main pool, but requested to change to Congress Park, as we wanted to be nearer a quiet pool, we arent into pool activities and slides and wanted to be quiet with easy walking into DTD, and they changed us without problem , infact on checkin they were so helpful and did their best to accomodate us, and we they had given us a view of DTD as well , though as has been said before most views are obscured by trees but the thought was nice anyway. Had no problem with language barriers, though i think they have people from all over, when I went back to check in much later in our stay to pay off the bill, the girl behind the checkin at the time, was clearly from the UK, though she was busy trying to help a guest checking in , the conceirge called me over to help instead so I didnt have to wait - and sorted my bill for me, despite that she was supposed to have "clocked off" herself for the day, so the service I feel for us was excellent. The room was clean and comfortable, amenties good too, and no issues with the TV reception, we had two in the villa one in the lounge and one in the bedroom, Ok they werent flat screen, but hey I didnt come here to watch TV all day... only need to check out the weather channel! as long as the room and bedding is clean thats my only concern - and it does seem they are in the process of upgrading as there was work going on with other villa blocks. Lucky for us this was a dry time in Florida so the weather was hot, not too humid. perfect! The pool area at congress park has to be the best, we hired bikes for one morning and cycled round the whole resort including the Treehouse section, its a beautiful resort, yes it big but we didnt think too big, we enjoyed walking around, cycling and exploring. We even saw a family of Otters in the lake when crossing over the long walk bridge, fantastic. We loved the fact you could go out and walk about the resort and hardly see a soul, we walked from Congress Park into and through DTD then out the otherside by Disney Quest back into Saratoga at the Carriage House side..... so quiet and a lovely walk. I often wonder with the amount of walking thats done at the parrk, people dont like to walk about a beautiful resort, we would often find ourselves walking "the long way" back from Artists Pallet to our room so we could enjoy the walk, there are plenty of benches to sit and rest and admire the surroundings en-route. it was so relaxing, and away from the hustle of other resorts. My only complaint about the resort is about Artists Pallet, whilst it was nice not to have the usual fayre on offer - the choice is limited and at breakfast time its hectic in there, I do understand Disney probably feel its a "self catering" resort as all rooms have a kitchen of some sort and most people are out and about during the day and evening, but the breakfast (though it was good) was a bit slow whilst waiting in the queue to place your order (Once pladed though it was fairly quick on the buzzer - served hot and fresh and delicious too). I know someone mentioned about the room numbering - we were given a small map on checkin, noting our room number and floor - our room 2334 - this meant block 2 floor 3, and room 34.... once you grasp that its easy to find where you are, and we found our room really easily. We loved this resort, enjoyed the factilites and loved the quiet pool - Bus service was good we hardly waited to get anywhere when we used the buses (we always have a car but tend to use the buses for MK - saves all that parking, trams and then either the boat or monorail when the bus takes you straight to the main gate!). but that could be the time of year too, we hardly waited for any rides either. All in all we had a great time, might be due to the fact we could experience this resort at no extra charge - but we have already booked to go back to Saratoga next year and cant wait.- relaxation heaven!

<Title>“Amazing hotel, fabulous holiday”
<Content>Me and my boyfriend stayed here for 2 weeks and there is not one bad thing to say about it. We was greeted at reception by the very friendly staff and was given any information we needed, we had to get a bellboy to take us to our apartment but was not complaining about that, he showed us around the resort and advised us the best routes to take. Our apartment was right near one of the pools and a bus stop and was a 4 minute walk from downtown disney. The disney transport is fantastic, no long waiting times and the driver was always friendly. Would recommend the dining plan, we saved so much money and the places we ate was fantastic, chef mickey's being one of them. Our maid was great, clean towels everyday, soap, shower gel etc was always topped up, even if we hadnt used any of theirs. Will definitely stay in a disney resort again.

<Title>“Very nice”
<Content>Just returned from Treehouse Villas. Loved the unit, housekeeping was great with keeping it very clean. It is a long walk from Saratoga Springs, but we liked the isolation and as we had a car and it was easier to get around. The internal buses were very regular but it is certainly time consuming to do the bus transfer at SSR. I did miss the "theme" feel which is a lot better at the other resorts. Also, be aware that most of the villas are enclosed with trees, so if you are looking for a "view", as we were, you may not get one. This would be great for a large group, but I doubt that I will pay this much for just four of us again.

<Title>“Pretty average - nothing to write home about”
<Content>Generally, the resort is very attractive with beautifully landscaped grounds, nice walking/running paths. My biggest disappointment has to do with the room amenities and pool area. My room was in the Paddock and I had a difficult time initially finding my room. The rooms are numbered in such a way that you don't know what floor you're on unless you're told at the front desk (which I was not). After searching every darn floor, I finally found my room on the 3rd floor. My room, although nice, was nothing extraordinary. The lights flickered on and off and one light bulb was burned out. The TV was an old-model box set that had mediocre reception. You'd think that a resort of this class would do better. Also, there's no wi-fi, which is absolutely ridiculous this day and age. The pool areas are nice, but nothing special in comparison to other Disney resorts. Don't think it's worth the money to stay here. You can stay at other resorts for the same rates with better amenities.

<Title>“Treegouse Villas- clean and elegant but with horrible service”
<Content>Our family included 6 adults, 1 toddler and 1 infant. We stayed at the Treehouse Villas for a weekend. The villas are wonderful, spacious, elegantly decorated and very clean. We were all very comfortable without feeling crowded. The rooms are large but don't have very much room available with all of the furniture, something that made it tricky for us to setup the pack n play for the baby and still be able to safely walk around the room in the dark. The front door was tricky to open requiring us to insert the key card for a long period of time before it would unlock. Everything else about the villa was great. The service was the only thing that was lacking during our stay, check in occurs in the Carriage House which is not close to the Villas at all, after check in you have to drive back to the main road because the villas have a separate entrance. We checked in at night and it wasn't until we made it to the villa that we discovered that the check in clerk didn't activate any of our keys requiring a drive back to the main resort, this was very annoying and there was no apology. None of the lobby staff spoke fluent English so there was a language barrier with them explaining things such as how to get to our villa and how many cars we can park. While there I witnessed another guest asking for the location of a lobby phone to call her room, she was told that they didn't have one and they wouldn't let her use the counter's phone to call her room, this all occurred with me seeing the lobby phone about 20 feet away. Out of 3 cast members present within eyesight of this phone, none of them knew of its existence nor showed any concern or willingness to assist this guest, that was very disappointing. The housekeeping service was very good on the other hand, they were all efficient, nice and friendly and would always say hello when we saw them around the property. Their English was better than those working the front desk, they should be the first faces that welcome you to this resort.

<Title>“Disney have excelled in this resort...”
<Content>Disney have excelled in this resort. Excellent location- just a 10 min walk to downtown Disney. It is very large- we stayed in congress park which was a good location. We had a car so, no issues with getting around. Service very good, resort very clean. Our quiet pool was just that- we had it to ourselves at night which was great. Rooms - typical Disney layout.. Small kitchen area was handy to have( moderate resorts don't have this) balcony area was good. The resort was very quiet as sept is out of season, so perfect if you want to switch off. I would definately recommend this to all Disney fans, but if you have children you may want to go elsewhere- it was more for adults, and that's why I loved it!

<Title>“Unexpected Pleasure”
<Content>Stayed here with family for one week. They were staying for 2 and 1 joined them 2nd week. I knew nothing about the place so was so impressed with the place considering going back there next year for 2 weeks myself. Very relaxing. We stayed in the Springs area so we were nearer to main pool but if you want a little quieter its not that far to quieter areas. Rooms were lovely. Bus service to parks were regular. Boat ride to downtown Disney a pleasure and relaxing if have time. Walking distance though so you can walk faster than bus will get you there as 5 stops within Saratoga Springs. Poolside movie at night is great for families. Kids can relax before going to bed. Poolside bar was open till 9 to have a drink. Artiste palette restaurant is adequate and has enough but kitchen in units is plenty big to do at least a breakfast before you hit parks. Can't say enough about the place. Staff were very nice without the Disney "have a nice day" way. Normal i'd say. Lifeguards had no problem telling people off if messing in pool. And it was not all Disneyfied. In other words Disney was subtle in this resort. Basically I loved it.

<Title>“Nice Quiet Villa. Really enjoyed the stay.”
<Content>Stayed in a 2BR villa near the pool. Very nice and quiet rooms. I could not hear anyone else and slept beautifully. I am a light sleeper and can hear anything, so I look for a peaceful room. The 2BR is nice and spacious. Ours was a dedicated, which means that the second bedroom had 2 queen beds. The first BR had 1 king bed. I really came to appreciate the spaciousness as my husband and I had some quiet time away from our 2 daughters. There is a good separation by way of the kitchen and living area between the 2 bedrooms. We stayed in the Springs area, which is right next to the check-in area and main pool. The villa itself was nice and clean, but the carpet was bit worn. Really enjoyed the stackable w/d in the room.

<Title>“Beautiful resort hotel in fabulous Disneyworld!”
<Content>This was our second stay at a Disney resort hotel and we were not dissapointed - no one does it like it Disney! We stayed for 8 nights and had two 2 bedroom suites which were clean and spacious, very comfortable and well equipped. Lovely bathrooms with spa baths, full kitchens and daily maid service. As with all Disney hotels and resorts the service is second to none and everyone is polite and so helpful. We stayed in 'The Carousel', short walk to the bus stop and and swimming pool. The public areas are kept very clean and tidy, we couldn't fault it all. The one thing we really did value was the Disney Dining package which was free - for all 8 adults in our party - we could eat almost anywhere within Disneyworld, the only extra we had to pay was the service charge if we all ate together, it saved us hundreds of dollars! We all loved it and would definitely return!

<Title>“Awesome!”
<Content>Stayed here as a returning DVC member (Home resort) after 2 year gap and found it still amazing. The location, quality of service and cleanliness, especially on grounds area are unbeatable. Staff are so friendly and helpful. We had one problem with weekly clean but the Duty Manager soon put that right. We stayed in the Paddocks area, where we stayed before and it is ideal, very quiet away from kids and near the exit gate for Downtown Disney. We did look at the Grandstand but found it to far away and noisy. If you want a quiet romantic spot go for the Paddocks.

<Title>“Beautiful, clean, safe, relaxing perfect holiday”
<Content>Our room was immaculate on the fourth floor overlooking the fountain and golf course in the grandstand area. This was great as first on the buses and first off on return. We had the dining plan and ate twice at the Turf Club where the food was excellent. My boys played golf on all the disney courses and loved it. The pool at the grandstand was great as there was a bar and drinks fountain for our refillable cups. Used the boat service over to downtown disney which was lovely. Having the large washer and drier meant we had no dirty washing to go home and didnt need to bring as much. The staff were all very friendly and just helped to make it a perfect holiday. Not a single fault to report.

<Title>“Rough Check-In, but awesome after that!”
<Content>We booked 4 nights at Saratoga Springs Resort and 5 days of Disney park tickets online 5 months before our stay. We arrived in Orlando the day before and decided to go to the resort to pick up our park tickets so that we could get an early start to our disney park day the next morning before checking in to the resort. We were stopped at the gate and told there was no way to get in until the day of check-in and that we could go very early in the morning if we wanted. Next morning got up at the crack of dawn to get the check-in squared away and get our tickets in hand to take advantage of the extra magic hours early park opening. Got to the carriage house for check-in where everything seemed to go according to plan, that is when we were told that due to the size of the 2-bedroom Villa it would take until 4pm to clean. We asked if there could be a priority cleaning put on it so that we could come back after lunch to get settled in and were told that it should not be a problem. 3 hours into our stay at the Animal Kingdom (11:30am), it started raining - a lot - really, really hard. We were soaked to the bone! Back to the hotel to dry off and get settled in until the rain stopped. At the desk, we were told that our room was not ready yet and that we'd have to wait until 4pm. I asked the manager if there was anything they could do to get us a room to dry off and change. They offered us towels. Now I try not to be unreasonable, but when you pay lots of money to stay at Disney (which is not cheap for the 2 bedroom villa), you have an expectation set for a level of service. This expectation was not met up to now. 5 of us standing in the check-in area, soaking wet and shaking from the AC and the best they could do was towels for the 4 hour wait till our room was ready? Seriously Disney? Once we did check-in, our room was nothing short of spectacular! We stayed in "the Villas 4127". Big rooms, nice kitchen with granite counters, wonderful view, the pool was right across the street! Overall, after check-in all was wonderful...too bad that had to be the introduction to staying at a Disney resort.

<Title>“Great stay!”
<Content>We stayed in the Grandstand. I read reviews and they were right. It was close to the boat to Downtown Disney, the bus to the parks, the smaller pool and the main office and food area. We had the studio with 3 adults and one 6 month old. The bath area was very room and separate from the sink. The microwave, toaster, refrig and additional sink were a treat. Staying on site is a plus. Our room was ready early, so we were allowed to check in early. Our luggage was safely kept on the way out as we had a late flight. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

<Title>“Fantastic stay”
<Content>We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa in Congress Park. The pool was clean, close by and has an excellent view of Downtown Disneys Hot air balloon. The use of the hotels towels was also much appreciated as you don't have to keep washing your own. The resort is well kept and there is always plenty of parking close to the rooms. The villa was huge, clean and very comfortable with huge fridge, freezer, dish washer and washer/dryer. The beds were also huge and very comfortable and the linen of good quality. We used the bus transport system and were only kept waiting for a bus once in the whole 2 weeks we were there and we used them daily. The water taxi from Downtown Disney was also a very good service which we used several times. The restuarant 'The Turf' served good quality food but was quite pricey. We used the Disney Dining Plan which was wonderful and often dined at other Disney restaurants. All of our meals were prebooked over the internet months before we arrived on holiday and we always had extremely good tables in nice locations. Overall, an excellent holiday in a lovely location with super service and very good food, would highly recommend Saratoga Springs and can't wait to return.

<Title>“Brilliant 2nd visit but..”
<Content>If you've never stayed with Disney or in one of their deluxe resorts you will absolutely love it here. It is perfect for loversof Downtown Disney and golfers, extremely well kept and clean. The rooms are amazing, especially the 1 bed villas. If you have stayed in a similar Disney resort you may notice the 20 minute queue for breakfast, the 30-45 minutes the bus takes to get to parks dues to the large number of bus stops at the springs and the main pool being quite packed ( no beds due to people leaving towels on beds and going off for the day!) Still the best hotel Ive ever stayed in. Far superior to Carribean resort which is often similarily priced.

<Title>“Lovely resort - worked well for myself and 11 year old daughter”
<Content>Arrived August 1st and stayed thru to the 11th. In Paddock 4836. This is a top floor studio apartment and was very well appointed. Room was clean, furnished to a high standard and linen and bedding were excellent. An exceptionally comfortable king size bed and an adequate sofa bed were the sleeping arrangements. Room was large for a studio. Microwave, coffee maker, toaster and fridge were all appreciated. Paper plates and bowls and plastic cutlery were a real pain. Paper bowls for breakfast cereal is no fun. I only assume this is a Disney decision due to the fact there is only a small sink for washing up and no dishwasher - I hate the disposable stuff though, but that’s just my view. Bathroom was nice and did what it needed, small safe in closet which was free to use. Noise was not an issue in this studio. We were at the end of the block on the top floor and other than a drunken man one night - we were never disturbed. The resort is big and it was a good walk to the beverage machine each day - thus our free to refill cups were barely used. We did not use the main pool, children community hall or either restaurant either for this purpose. We were driving anyhow so drove to a number of on property restaurants at other resorts to make the best of our dining plan - highly recommend Le Celier, Teppan Edo and Ohana's for dinner. Little pool by our block was clean and pleasant to use after a day at the parks. My daughter would swim and I did the laundry. Laundry facilities are next to all the pools and are free and used only by studio guests as all other units have them in the room. Service was good. Check in process straight forward, parking was plentiful and buses galore - though we never went on a bus and used the rental car to get about. I would go back. If you are not using a rental car/private car - I think where you are sited could be vital. Parking was plentiful. Felt very safe on resort. Grounds are immaculate. On site luggage check out for airlines was useful and even for us (travelling to UK) it was very handy to be able to weigh luggage before getting to the airport on scales a little more accurate than my lift , sigh, fingers crossed approach!

The Treehouse Villas were awesome and the bus comes through every 10-15 mins to take you to the main grounds. My kids loved it. The Villas were so spacious and modern. All I can say is A+++++. We will stay here again.

<Title>“Disney - but be prepared!”
<Content>We had booked a 2 bedroom villa for 5 nights and requested a pool view. When we checked in we were disappointed that we were so far from the pool we had to DRIVE! Well, I should be more specific...There was a leisure pool within a few minute walk but having a 9 and 10 year old, they wanted to be where the action was. That pool, High Rock Springs, we had to drive to. The Resort is a typical Disney property. It is clean and well maincured. Our villa overlooked the wooded area between the property and Disney Village. I thought the decor was drab but maybe that is what Saratoga, New York looks like. You have only 2 choices for restaurants on property. Both were just average food and very pricey. I don't know if we would stay here again. I think we would like to try a smaller property.

<Title>“Disney vacation.”
<Content>My stay at Saratoga Springs in WDW was amazing. The rooms were great, and were the perfect size for me and my friend and parents. Saratoga would be a great place to stay for teenagers to stay because it is just a walk away from downtown disney shopping and restaurants.

<Title>“Loved our 2 bedroom villa...”
<Content>We received a great price of I believe $333.00/night. I loved the idea of the washer and dryer. In fact, in the morning I would toss a load of laundry into the washer and when I came back later the "maid service" had put the laudry into the dryer. I totally unexpected it, but loved it when it happened. We had one problem where we were concerned about a burning smell and two minutes later a maint. man arrived to check things out. As it turned out someone above us had burned something and the smell carrried through the vent system. No worries. We tried to do the dishes before leaving for the park but there was a day where when we arrived back the service had finished our dishes!! We were on the quiet side of the villas and had total quiet. We loved it after a long, loud day at the parks. My only complaint was the bus system. It did take awhile. One night I rode the bus for 45 mins. while they dropped off at other resorts,etc. I think we were in the Paddock section. Worked well for teenagers and my husband and I . We didn't get to use the boat system because in order for us to get to the boats it was probably at least a 15 min. or more walk. I would recommend that if you wanted to use the boats to ask for a villa closer to that side. All in all...our vacation worked out well.

<Title>“DISNEY HAS PLEASED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!”
<Content>I am a DVC member simply because of the highest quality, customer service, cleanliness, and happiness Disney brings to all their guests. I have read some disappointing reviews and find them very hard to believe. I have been going to WDW for 28 yrs and a DVC member for 5yrs. I have NEVER been disappointed at any resort, non the less at Saratoga Springs. The rooms, resort main house, Restaurants, pools etc were ALL CLEAN. The cast members (employees) were above friendly and helpful, they were down right part of the show. Anything you need or ask is always accompanied by a smile. Cast member walk the walk...not just walk the talk. All of them play their own role at the resort but will assist you even if its out of their dept. Did I mention you afre also within walking distance to Downtown Disney>>theres a path fromt he resort to Downtown, which is fabulous! I have referred many people and NOGT ONE complained. A few even became DVC members as well. Saratoga is a relaxing family, or even couples resort. I would recommend it to anyone....I can tell you it beat the service at the Faimount Hotels ive stayed at....

<Title>“SAVE YOUR MONEY”
<Content>First off we all know what we pay to have a weeks stays at any one of Disney's Resorts , and its not cheap , most of us usually save for one of these trips. and do not believe the pictures OH they sure do look just like them but all worn out . First off the maid service is less to be desired , as they cover up a lot of the stuff , and if you dont remove the sheets from the bed they do not put clean fresh sheet on . then the sofa , WOW , granted its is also a sofa bed but its not suppose to feel like your sitting on a board, then we didn't say a word as we wanted to see how long hairs would stay in the 2nd bathroom which were on the handicap handle and sure enough they stayed there all week long . and when they tell you they have cable , dont believe them and bring your own dvd to watch , because their cable is ABC and Disney all news and Disney channels , you almost want to pull your hair out , you are out all day long and when you get back you want to relax and sit back and watch a good movie , NO you have to sit there and watch Hanna Montana, and or CNN and or better yet Disney's own station where they tell you to go to in the parks and dont shut the t.v. off other wise when you turn it back on it automatically goes back to the Disney welcome home station , Then 3 days before we left to come back home my grandson was looking for one of his mickey's and called me into the bedroom as he found a elec. outlet that was right at the top of his head , that was opened . where the plate was 3/4 of the way missing and any child could of placed their hand into the outlet and got shocked and this is Disney . Paying the money that we did we for sure had thought that the place would of been like a castle and or something of and the carpet was all bunched up . the place was in my words terrible and when we got home I called and of course they said why didn't you call us so we could of corrected the issues , what there were to many on the list to correct. its a beautiful place granted and the parks were clean but the rooms are really not up to par , and again to pay thousands of dollars and get the rooms that we did , we could of stayed anywhere . at those prices . I have contacted the resort and after 4 days I placed a call because the e-mail that I sent , probably went into the garbage . of and then instead of allowing me to speak with the manager they connected me to the building manager , and nothing was done , as I feel that I should of been compensated in some way , save your money and rent a house , its a lot cheaper .

<Title>“Great Stay”
<Content>Stayed in a 2 bedroom and 2 bath condo (The Grandstand). Rooms were clean and everything worked. Washer and Dryer are a must with young kids. Air conditioning was a little slow to cool the room. Just keep the thermostat on 65 and it will keep the condo about 73 degrees. Bus stop was close, the longest wait for a bus was about 20 minutes, usually around 10 minutes. Stayed five nights, rooms were cleaned everyday while we were at the parks. Didn't eat at the Saratoga but food at Disney was very good, even the hot dogs and hamburgers (little expensive though). Bring your own water and cokes into the parks and it will save you a lot of money. Saratoga had full size frige and freezer. Overall room was great, no complaints. Just remember there are no luggage carts, whatever you plan on bringing make sure you can haul in your room and up/down elevators. We drove and got food and drinks at a grocery store nearby and kept in the condo.

<Title>“Terrific Resort close to Everything!”
<Content>Just got back from a week at Disney and visited Harry Potter. Resort was close to all of Disney and bus system was first rate all day long! Easy access from and to airport...staff was great. Remember, to eat at Turf Club must go thru reservations at WDW. Pools were clean and cooling. Only issue was with "forever cup" for drinks which did NOT include water or milk or friut drinks....just soft drinks. Lots of storage space in units, elevators in buildings. Loved being near Grandstand Station as we were first pick up to the parks (guaranteed seats) and first drop off after the parks! (Unit numbers from 8100 thru 8750) This was an RCI trade and worked well for us as we took two units for all of us. Small but complete grocery store in main building eliminated using car. Took Mears taxi to Universal one day.

<Title>“Excellent service, Nice room”
<Content>Just returned from the Saratoga Springs. We took this trip with two small children. The resort is very large, but we were lucky enough to be put in the Springs section that was close to the Disney tranportation pick up, the pool and the restaurants. The rooms were ok in size. We booked a standard room with a queen bed and pull out couch. When the couch was pulled out the room was somewhat cramped but, it worked out fine. The refridgerator, microwave and small kitchen sink were an added bonus. We had a small patio with chairs and a table that the kids enjoyed eating their breakfast at. The grounds were very well maintained. We at at the Turf Bar and Grill and had some good meals. Did not use the Artist's Pallete. The pool was great for the small children that we were with, It was not very deep. ( I think abut the deepest part was about 3' 8".) They really enjoyed the slides. Service was excellent!! From the time we arrived until the time we departed the service was superb. Great place to stay with small children.

<Title>“A wonderful resort, a wonderful vacation!”
<Content>We arrived at Saratoga on Friday, June 25. Check in was a breeze thanks to Disney's online check-in. We were very pleased to find our request was honored to stay in the Grandstand, near transportation. Once we entered our room, all of my nervousness was put to rest. I simply cannot understand how anyone has anything negative to say about this resort. We were in room #8730, a one bedroom villa. The room was very clean and well stocked. I loved the washer and dryer! The pool area was right below us and to the left was the golf course. We asked an employee; I believe her name was Jill, to show us the path to the Carriage house and instead she told us to hop on her golf cart and she took us there. It was nice to find out it was just a very short walk, even nicer to run into someone that was so very helpful. We left Sat. morning headed to Hollywood Studios and the Magic Kingdom later that day. Our wait time was less than 10 minutes from the resort...about 15 miuntes from the park. There was also a cast member at the resort to record when each bus arrived. The Grandstand is the first pickup so we also got to view the other parts of the property as other guests were picked up. We did not return until 10:30 that night and were so happy to arrive to a clean room. Our bed was one of the most comfortable beds we had ever slept in and our daughter fell fast asleep on the pullout couch we made up for her. Sunday was a day spent at the resort. After arriving to a clean room from church, we played in the arcade, in the pool, and then headed to downtown Disney after dinner. We actually walked there and had a wonderful time. Monday we waited for about 5 minutes to catch the bus to the Animal Kingdom and Epcot in the afternoon. Just another awesome day and we highly recommend the ride "Soarin" at Epcot. We were on the dining plan and had dinner Friday night at the resort's Turf Bar and Grill...pretty good but a 25 minute wait even with reservations, Saturday night at Crystal Palace in the Magic Kingdom....this is an excellent buffet with Pooh characters, Sunday night at Chef Mickey's, still our daughter's favorite, and Monday night at the Garden Grill at Epcot with Chip and Dale. The characters at this restaurant spent more time with our daughter than any other site and the food was really, really good...it was a lot of fun! When we were preparing to check out, a member took the time to ask us to tell him about our stay. We then ran into Jill again who talked to our daughter about her trip and reminded us to make sure we used all our snack credits on the dining plan. Check out took about 5 minutes and we were on our way. I understand everyone has different experiences, but ours was nothing short of fantastic. Did I mention everyone addressed our daughter as "princess"? I asked my husband did he want to try another resort next summer and he said his vote was for Saratoga. Our daughter echoed the same thought. It was funny to hear her say "Mommy, this place has a lot more to do than where we stayed last year". We have no problem recommending Saratoga and hope should you choose this resort that your visit is as wonderful as ours was.

<Title>“Great Stay!!!”
<Content>Had a great time staying at Saratoga. Stayed at Congress Park..easy walk to Downtown Disney. Quiet pool at Congress Park was perfect - right size and not a lot of people. Room needed a little maintenance, but was clean. I think the DVC resorts would benefit from daily house keeping to help avoid wear and tear issues. The spa was great. I had a massage and facial. The ladies were friendly and professional. We also felt that the front desk was helpful with all of our needs. Would stay again in a heart beat!

<Title>“Save your time and money”
<Content>This resort is a joke and met my biggest fear: the rumors that disney properties are outdated and worn, is that the truth! I tend to stay at 4 star plus resorts when traveling and normally stay off property, since we were meeting some friends who are VCM and this is there home resort I opted to stay on property. Oh where do I start: 1) Had poor directions to the room and ended up walking with a 3 year old, stroller and 2 back packs around the ENTIRE property by myself which is not small by any means before arriving at the room. Once in the room I found it was a handicap accesible room only, no bathtub for my son not to mention the doors were hanging off the cabinets, literally, the grout in the bathroom floor was BLACK, rust exposed on the sink and black grime ground in the sofa. Instantly disgusted. I contacted the front desk, they mentioned they would put in a service ticket but I refused and requested another room. So I then trucked everything back up to the main area, got the key to the second room and I was off. This room was just as bad! The room literally smelled of dust/dirt, the carpet was very worn and dirty, bugs were in the corner by the door and the entire room (baseboard, furniture) had a decent layer of dust on it. I actually dusted my entire room, I was not about to waste my time requesting housekeeping. Oh and I didnt even have a flat screen but an old TV, its 2010 I would expect at least all Disney Deluxe properties to have flat screens. 2). Bus service is a JOKE! Last time we stayed at the Gaylord Palms, they have a very timely bus service and knew exactly what times the bus would leave to each place. WDW resorts you just hope you didnt miss the last bus and they DO NOT run on 20 min intervals. We waited 45 min for the Animal Kingdom bus, I spent more time waiting for buses than anything else. 3). Swimming pools were overcrowded, dirty (random things floating other than leaves) and cloudy. These resorts are a WASTE of money, if I knew I would not offend my friends I would have checked out in an instant and moved over to the Waldorf or Hilton on Bonnett Creek, where we were orginally were going to stay.

<Content>We stayed at the treehouse and were very pleased. The housekeeping staff did an outstanding job. Yes the treehouses are very far from everything, but with the parking pass we were able to drive to all the parks and leave on our timetable. It was great not to have to wait on busses with young children. The main resort area was accessible through the bell service, very nice. The bar and grill on the property was also very good. The treehouses were decorated very rustic which was great.

<Content>I hope if we get to return to Orlando, we can book here again! It was my daughter's first trip to Disney & the staff was incredible! To all the reviews that said there was too much walking at this resort...get in shape! Going to Disney means you have to walk! With all of those 1,000's of visitors, someone will have to put forthe effort to walk some distance! But that rant aside (I can't stand laziness) it was an amazing resort! Kudos to Saratoga Springs! Did I mention that Downtown Disney is just a mere 8 minute walk away?

Best meal was at Wolfgang Pucks in DD - pumpkin ravioli and key lime pie fantastic! We'll be back again. We are DVC members. Did not go to Magic Kingdom or other parks so can't comment on those.

<Content>We stayed here for the first time as DVC members and hated how far we were from the main lobby. We had the dining plan but didn't use any of our credits at our own hotel. We didn't even get our refillable mugs...Our location was close to the front gate, good thing we had a car. The room was excellent, we had a 2 bedroom suite. The washer and dryer were AWESOME...bathrooms were big. We didnt like the glass shower doors because you couldn't use the toilet while someone was showering! This delux hotel was worth using our "extra free points" but I wouldnt stay here unless I could get a room in "the springs" area.

<Title>“Treehouse Villas - Remote & Majestic”
<Content>I stayed at the Treehouse Villas in Disneyworld. It was a nice hotel, but very remote. We forgot to order groceries before arriving and that was a big problem. Unfortunately, it is impossible to get groceries delivered after arrival. The treehouse was spacious and beautiful. The surrounding area was majestic and you could take a boat to Downtown Disney practically just outside our door. The bus to the Parks was a real pain, though. You had to change buses to get home from Saratoga Springs to Treehouses. It took about an hour to get back from the Parks. While we liked the Treehouses, I would not stay there again unless we rented a car. The hotel staff was only marginally helpful.

<Title>“Honeymoon Nightmare”
<Content>The managerial staff at the Saratoga Spings Disney Resort is awful, as have helpful as the front desk and concierge cast members tried to help, even they were disgusted by the way we were treated by the so-called managerial staff... We even went back to follow-up the next day to talk to the daytime personal and the on staff manager was also condescending and rude. Hopefully the general manager of the resort reads these (doubtful) and can provide some remedial training. This is the 6th Disney resort I have stayed at, and I am an active duty service member and recently married to a Disney cast member. Needless to say we will never visit Saratoga Springs again and hopefully we can get it blacklisted for service members until they fix their issues and attitudes.

<Title>“We LOVED our stay!!!”
<Content>We just had the most magical vacation at Disney World and we were all sad to come home! Before we arrived; we were a little bit concerned about the size of Saratoga Springs (based on other reviews and information we had gotten). We were very pleased that reservations honored our request to be near the Carriage House and main pool. We were in a 1 bdrm villa in the Springs section and were thrilled with a beautiful view, short walk to/from the park buses & main pool/dining. Our room was very clean and more than we expected! We traveled with 2 small children and really wanted an extra room so our youngest daughter could nap without interruption. The kitchen was well stocked and we really appreciated the dish soap, dishwasher detergent, & sponges. We also were surprised at the nice little grocery section of the carriage house. We tried to order groceries from Garden Grocer and were disappointed that our time/day slot was filled by the time we ordered. It ended up being a blessing in disguise as the resort had everything we needed and the prices were good (and we didn't have to pay delivery). I was surprised with a massage while we were there from my husband and had a wonderful experience in the spa. It was very nice and quiet and I really enjoyed my 50 minutes of pampering! Thank you for a wonderful vacation and we will be back sooner rather than later - we loved the resort!!!!!!

<Title>“Loved It”
<Content>I loved everything about this trip. The villa is the best way to go when traveling with a big party. There were 9 of us with 3 small children ages 5, 3, and 2. We were able to go to the grocery and get food for breakfast, lunch and snacks. Every person you came to coud answer your questions or help you find someone who could. My mom, my sister in law and I went to the spa and had a wonderful time. The whole trip was great. Sometimes there was a small wait for buses and they were crowed but considering the amount of people coming and going around there who can really complain about that, I do think that some of the bus drivers could have been more personable but considering some of the people they put up with throughout the day who could blame them. Everyone really enjoyed riding the boats back and forth from downtown disney and the drivers were always very nice and very informative. I think if anyone goes to this resort and doesn't have a good time they are just looking for something to complain about.

<Title>“Treehouses not good for us”
<Content>We are DVC members and were very excited to hear about the treehouses. We saw the unit model and thought it would be a good experience, up in the trees. We checked in with no problems (kudos to the check in staff) and got to our unit. We asked for a handicapped accessible (mother has some difficulty with stairs but can do them) but did not get this (were not informed of this at desk). The unit is very well decorated but feels like being in a goldfish bowl. The octagonal shape means that every way you face has a wall "closing in" on you. The feeling of being up in the air is nice but the second bedroom (we had a 3 BR unit) should have had a smaller bed. The size of the bed dwarfed the room. The transit to and from was not bad, just tiring. The process of taking a bus to a bus after a long day gets to one. There is no convenience store (like the campground's Trading Post) even though these units are designed to be "home away from home". If you forget to pack something or want to cook, you're out of luck. The nearest store is the one in the center just past Lake Buena Vista and it is really a glorified 7-11. We will definitely transfer the resort use to the cabins in Fort Wilderness from now on. That is a better fit for us, there are things to do that do not require park entrance and transit is easier to and from this resort.

<Title>“Great Disney Resort”
<Content>Just got back from a recent trip to Disney and a stay at the Saratoga Springs Resort. Was a little worried about some of the reviews on here but very glad we ended up choosing this one! Shuttle service from the airport took us right to the front of the resort with a Disney greeter waiting. The buildings in the resort are well designed and the lobby itself is beautiful. Check in was a breeze and the front desk folks were very helpful. We took a short bus ride to our room which was near the Paddock/Carousel stops. The room was a good size, very clean and had a beautiful view of one of the ponds/fountain combos. The only room complaint was we didn't have a remote for the TV. We called the front desk who said they who bring one by the next day but never did. Not a big deal since we were gone most of the time but something to mention. The food in the Artist's Palette was decent. Nothing too gourmet but good food in general. We usually just got a sandwich or salad which were very good. Also having the option of free drinks with our complimentary Disney mugs was a great way to save money at the resort. We had a small pool by our room that was hardly crowded and the resort was very quiet. Besides it being slightly further than other resorts (about a 10-15 min. bus ride), the location was good. We really loved being so close to Downtown Disney and the boat rides to and from the hotel were fun. Overall we had a great trip and really enjoyed the hotel. Besides some minor inconveniences, it was a great place to come back to after walking around in 95 degree weather for 10 hours!

<Title>“Great Stay”
<Content>We just returned from 7 nights at Saratoga Springs using an RCI exchange and loved it. After reading some of the reviews I was worried about the walks, buses etc but found none of these to be a problem. We stayed in a Congress Park (CP)1 bedroom villa with view of downtown disney, and after walking and biking the resort I am glad we did, the other areas were a bit boring in my opinion. CP is about a 5 minute walk to the main pool, restaurant, spa etc. We used the main pool almost everyday and there was always enough chairs even though we got their late afternoon. Pool Bar was dissappointing, we did enjoy the ping pong tables and games. CP has its own bus stop which was very close and the longest we ever had to wait was 15 minutes but most came less than 10 minutes from CP and Parks. We bought 5 day hopper + passes and probably only needed 4 days. We visited all 4 parks, both water parks and disneyquest 2x, so the "and more" package paid off for us. I was underwhelmed with both Epcot and Hollywood but impressed with Magic and Animal Kingdom, waterparks and disneyquest. We went at opening and completed parks by midafternoon and used either pool/waterpark for rest of day At the last minute I opted for the dining plan and probably would not do it again. SInce we were there 7 nights and were in our hotel each evening it probably would have been cheaper to do lunches in parks and make our own dinner with 1 or 2 nice nights out- ordering food for delivery ahead of time. However, if it was a shorter stay and less down time the plan is worth it and everyone else in our group loved it! Our favorite meals were at Coral Reef and California Grill---kids also loved Beaches and Cream. Least favorite meal by far was the Sci-Fi diner. Food in parks was fairly typical processed amusement park options...not that great. Other meals were at Earl of Sandwich, Wofgang Pucks and Wolfgang Puck Express, Turf Club, ...none great and none bad. I think it important to say that our kids are 12 and 14 so an experience with younger kids or no kids might be different. Also, we intentionally took the kids out of school to avoid crowds and all of us agreed that was worth it. We had very short lines for attactions--at Magic none at all-- we were able to get a seat almost every time on the bus. After exeperiencing this I would not go in the summer when it is packed, lots of screaming kids and very hot. Also, as a side we checked out a couple of other hotels- Animal Kingdon Lodge- looked boring and Yacht and BeachClub which looked really fun!

<Title>“very nice resort,lots of things to do :)”
<Content>well the check-in desk is very organized and i'm not going to lie it takes like 10 to 15 mins to get your room,but its disney so you'll get used to it.the check-in lobby is has a very high celling and its very nice.it also has a little kids section where they can enjoy a disney show/movie.if you have teens my best advice is to let them walk around the resort after you give them the room key or room number of course.if u like to play basketball,tennis there is a half court basketball court and four tennis courts i believe.you can also rent movies or board games but my advice is to just walk or take a bus or car to downtown disney which is like a 10 min walk if u stay at the springs.to me the best area to stay at is the springs because its close to the main pool which is a good thing and also the bus is near by to.the gym is breath taking it has any machine you can think of which is a good thing and they have cold water and towels for you and there's also a spa i dont know much about that but you can google it lol.the food court is located in the lobby area its alright but alot of money my advice is to pass by the publix located by international dr well goodluck and have fun at saratoga sorings i know i did

<Title>“Great Trip”
<Content>We just returned from a week stay at Saratoga Springs. We stayed in a two bedroom villa at the very far end of the complex. Lots of walking if you don't have a car but the grounds are beautiful so no problem. The room was great and we found most of the staff helpful and friendly. If planning on going here understand that if you have no car you can not get to a grocery store. The store Disney offers is no place to buy food items for your family. Very limited and costly. Downtown Disney has no grocery stores either. If you are eatting dinner at Downtown Disney go early becasue it gets busy fast with long lines. The only other issues was with the resort buses. Plan ahead, becasue they need to fire the guy in charge of that operation. Oh, and go the the pool early because it is way to small for the size of this resort and is packed. Overall we did have a great time !!!!

<Title>“Know Which Location To Request Accomodations.”
<Content>Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa is, to say the least, a sprawling property. Imagine walking from the Downtown Disney bus stop near Rainforest Cafe to the parking lots past Cirque du Soleil La Nouba and you'll understand. Therefore, it takes a bit of research, planning, analysis of the resort and asking questions beforehand to avoid disappointment with your accomodations. We did all of that and were thoroughly pleased with our 2 Bedroom Villa in The Grandstand's 9101-9436 building. This was our first visit, so I'm not familiar with the Studio, 1 Bedroom, 3 Bedroom Grand Villa or Treehouse rooms; but staying in our Villa was more like renting an apartment with maid service than staying at a resort. And that's a compliment: Massive closet space, a well layed out full-size kitchen, comfortable sleeping room for 7 people, 3 televisions and telephones, 2 bathrooms with decent privacy for everyone, breakfast bar, sliding doors to the secluded covered patio with a golf course view, a dining nook with seating for 6; all the comforts of home. We were on the first floor without any close neighbors and didn't hear a peep from anybody all week. Our patio opened up to a courtyard facing the rear of the properly; overlooking the 17th and 18th holes of the Lake Buena Vista Golf Course, a seldomly used walkway and the Sassagoula River. It was like sitting in our backyard. Our building was about a three minute walk to The Grandstand's quiet pool and more importantly; the same distance from the Bus Depot. That's crucial at Saratoga because it's the first stop Disney buses make and the first drop-off at the end of the day. It's also a good way to get around the property if time is not an issue or you don't feel like walking. The main pool and check-in were a five minute walk up and down some hills; but still manageable. Our quiet pool was pretty large with some nice landscaping, a BBQ cabana, plenty of seating, Children's splash area, it's own bar, restrooms, lockers, hot tub, changing facilities, towels, tables and was rarely crowded. We wouldn't have visited the feature pool at all if the kids didn't love the slide; which is fast, long and wild enough for the adults to enjoy. That pool does get crowded; but finding a table or lounge chairs wasn't a problem and we noticed the water was warmer. A cursory glance at the property map indicates The Grandstand is surround by a golf course, The Carousel is secluded with only 2 buildings, The Paddock spans half of the resort and some buildings are quite a hike to anything, Congress Park is congested and close to Downtown Disney and The Springs is in the middle of it all. Disney reservations are pretty good about honoring location requests if possible and they recommend placing a request about 10-14 days in advance. The Grandstand and The Carousel are newer buildings; but the entire resort is fairly new and maintained well.

<Title>“Very nice”
<Content>We really enjoyed our 1 bedroom villa at Saratoga Springs. Our kids loved the pools (and the water slide), although the main pool did get quite crowded during the day. We thought the bus transportation to the parks was great and wished we hadn't bothered with a rental car. The room was very nice and the bed was terrific - very comfortable. It's a very restful resort and was a nice change from the frenetic feeling at the parks. Nice fitness center, too.

<Title>“Hoping for More”
<Content>We just returned from a stay at Disney's Saratoga Springs. We stayed in a studio in the the Grandstand Building, which was a good location since it had a pool of its own and was only a five-minute walk from the main building. I had forgotten how small the rooms at the Disney resorts were. The studios have one bed and a small pull out couch. So when the couch was open, it was difficult to move around. The room does come equipped with a kitchenette (counter with small sink, cupboards overhead, mini fridge and microwave). The grounds were beautiful, but I thought the room looked a little dated and not as pristine as I was hoping for one of the "deluxe" resorts. I would rate it as just okay. Since there are at least 5 bus stops just within Saratoga Springs, we decided to drive to the parks ourselves (parking is free if staying within the resort) and were glad we did since our stay was during what is probably the busiest week of the year. Our children enjoyed the pool and 2 hot tubs in the main area and the resort itself is pretty. I would have liked to have seen a one or two bedroom villa but didn't get the chance. In the end the studio was fine because we only slept there but I certainly don't feel it merits a deluxe classification.

<Title>“My Disney Vacation Home”
<Content>I just returned from a five day, four night vacation. My 7 yr. old daughter and I had a deluxe studio villa. It was wonderful, the service was great, and I am looking forward to my next visit. We were located at the The Grandstand. The property is expansive, beautiful, and quiet. The pool and hot tub was terrific. I will try to experience other Disney resorts but I am very pleased with this resort. There was one cast member , I am sorry I don't remember her name who showed my daughter such magical attention. This attention set the tone for the rest of the trip. My daughter had a magical time and was treated like a princess the whole time.

<Title>“Grand Villa”
<Content>We stayed with friends in a 3 bedroom Grand Villa. The room was wonderful. The golf and tennis looked great. The resort is top notch, except for the pool, which is nice, but at a maximum depth of around 3 feet, is just average. As I understand it, they are going to be replacing the current pool with one that is 3 times larger in the next year. That should make this resort on par with any of the other resorts on Disney property. We did have a car, which was handy, as getting to other resorts from here was a bit poky. All in all, a very nice stay.

<Title>“Very nice resort, will return again soon!”
<Content>My husband and I took a short 3-day getaway to Orlando (from Jacksonville). When we arrived to check in at the resort, we asked for a quiet room away from all the noise and crowds. Yes, even at Disney that is possible. They accommodated us far beyond our expectations by putting us in a building that had very few occupants, which was fine with us. The studio apartment was very clean, well maintained and very quiet. We have stayed at most of the other resorts at Disney World. Since most apartments at Saratoga Springs are "time-shares", it felt more like staying at a condo than a hotel, which was fine with us. Bus stop to go throughout Disney was just a few short steps away. We will definitely stay here again.

<Title>“An excellent Disney resort”
<Content>We stayed here for a getaway to Disney World, our favorite vacation destination. The resort itself is beautiful, and I like all the little horse racing decorating touches around the resort that add to the theme. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful, even when we asked to add on an extra night at the last minute due to a change in plans. We stayed in a studio room, which we found to be nice and spacious for the two of us. In fact, we liked that the room had 1 bed plus a sleeper sofa--since we didn't need the sleeper sofa to be pulled out, it gave us more leg room in the room itself. The bed was very comfortable, and the mini kitchen area was handy for breakfasts. My only criticism would be that the bathroom shower rod should be one of the curved out style, but it's not. I found the shower to be a bit cramped, and a curved out rod would make it perfect.

<Title>“Perfect short vacation..”
<Content>I just returned from a short vacation to this hotel. It was great ! I went with friends who had a few extra points on there time share. This hotel is set up so cool, with the many different pools and the good food. When we first got there we arrived and were checked in very fast. Then we go shown our rooms and some of the different pools they had there. Then we went to get a quick bite to eat in the cafe next to the pool. I cant think of the name ! Artists Pallete maybe ? We relaxed in the room, went to the main pool again by the cafe then cleaned up and went to dinner in downtown disney(which is my favorite) the next day i woke up early and went over to the park the busing there was quick, easy and painless. I plan on returning with my daughter in December which will be a surprise for her birthday !

<Title>“Classic Disney Service”
<Content>Stayed here for 9 days in July and August with my fiancee (proposed to her on the trip). This was a 'freebie' for buying into the Disney Vacation Club. I'd stayed at MANY of the Disney resorts from "Moderate" to "Deluxe" level so I had a good basis for comparison. For my fiancee, however, this was her first time at a 'deluxe' resort. My fiancee was dazzled by the place. Large rooms, clean, great service. The place is a bit spread out so it's the luck of the draw as to how far a hike it'll be to get to any of the amenities. There are several bus stops in this resort if that gives you an idea of the sprawl. To her, this place was perfect. To me it was *just* a *shade* below that. I'd been to places like the Polynesian, Contemporary, Wilderness Lodge and the Animal Kingdom Lodge and Saratoga Springs was just a shade 'wanting'. There were no doors separating the hallways from 'the outdoors' - it was all painted concrete, as opposed to the interior corridors in the other resorts (and the sound-deadening carpeting that went with them). Also, some of the interior hallway lighting was broken, but that was out of the ordinary. It was towards the end of our stay when we toured the new Animal Kingdom Lodge - Kidani Village (my 'home resort') that my fiancee saw the difference between the two 'deluxe' resorts. It's more than just having the private savannahs. Nothing against Saratoga Springs. It's a wonderful place with top-notch Disney service. It's just that, if you've been to a couple of the other 'deluxe' resorts, this one comes up slightly lacking.

<Title>“Not Ideal for Kids”
<Content>I took this trip with my friend and her 5 yr old daughter for my birthday and to use my DVC for the first time. We had to stay at Saratoga because that was all there was available without having to hop resorts. We had a 1BR villa. The room was very nice and spacious. The grounds are huge and not ideal if you have kids who do not like to walk. We were assigned to the Carosel section which is forever away from the main lobby and food court. The weather was terrible and there were millions of people there as well which I did not expect. The weather also made being so far away from everything so difficult. It is not fun to walk 5 miles to your room in the freezing rain and cold. I would not recommend this resort for any one with kids but it would be a nice place to stay for the health nut or for couples that are not on a schedule. It would also be nice if the weather was good so you could enjoy the nice grounds.

<Title>“Nice to get away from all the stimulation, laid back, spacious, not Disney oriented”
<Content>Let me start off by saying I am VERY picky. Check in took a while, but not too bad. The only problems I had were first, Bell Services didn't want us taking our luggage to our own room (we hired a van from the airport...highly recommend), so my husband handed it off while I did check in. An hour later I called them, b/c we were still waiting, We were in our room for an entire hour just sitting there because we had no luggage. Also, the Garden Grocer (fabulous) had dropped our food off and it was with Bell Services so they had to make 2 trips. We ended up being in our room for about 1 1/2 hrs once we had our luggage and grocery items. Housekeeping. I have never in my entire life seen such shoddy housekeeping. It actualy became a joke throughout the week with my family. We could only tell if housekeeping was there because the beds were made. 1 time they didn't wipe down the counters, they always left coffee in pot and never moved a single item out of the way, so if you had shoes on the floor, they left them exactly where they were. I don't think they cleaned the bathrooms. We had fresh towles every day (well, all except one when they didn't come--but they did when I called in the evening) and they made the beds and ran the dishwasher, but that was all. We never saw any staff members for anything, except by the pool when they played games with the kids, that was great. The pool area was nice. The hotel itslef is huge and the fact that there were 6 bus stops in our hotel alone was a bummer, especially since we were stop #6 coming back from the parks. If your picky about pillows you might have an issue. They have these strange little bed pillows that I found odd. We stayed in The Springs and I'd stay there again, it was very convenient to a bus stop, pool and main area. I read some reviews about the rooms being too small and I'd disagree with that. Also, there were complaints about The Artist's Palette restaurant. I will say, the ordering/paying system is a nightmare, but the food was refreshing. Not your normal run-of-the-mill chicken nuggets and hamburgers. I loved the veggie slaw. Loved the trendy menu. Overall, room-wise my husband and I and our 4 children ranging from 6-16 were very comfortable. Disney overall is completely overpriced anyway you cut it, so if I chose to stay in the park again, I would consider staying at SS again, even though it's far from ideal.

<Title>“Treehouses are terrific”
<Content>My sister is a DVC member, so we rented one of the Treehouses at Saratoga Springs. It sleeps nine (using a fold out couch and chair in livingroom) easily. It has three bedrooms, two baths, kitchen and living area. The building is round and on a pedestal. Outside is an elevated picnic table and a grill that is on the ground. The "neighborhood" is so nice. There are many trees, so you don't look directly into the unit next to you (or at least we didn't). There is a quiet pool in this area. It was an easy walk to a boat that took us to Downtown Disney. The only real problem was having to use an internal bus to get to buses that take you to the parks. You have to add some time into your plans. But if you are a laid-back traveler, this is not a problem. We truly enjoyed our time there.

<Title>“Expected more, got less!”
<Content>Saratoga Springs is a large, sprawling resort at Disney with a central reception building containing a quick-service restaurant and a bar and grill. Connected are the golf club, spa and swimming pool area. You want to be close to this area as the outlying villas are far removed which means long-distance walking - even to get to one of the 5 bus stops in many cases. We checked in and requested a room close in and were given a studio in one building over from the main lobby. Arriving in the room, we found it to be quite comfortable; however, the heat/air conditioning unit was constantly running and was quite noisy. We had already asked to be moved to the building next to the lobby and were glad for that. We froze all night even though the thermostat read 74 degrees. In the a.m. we moved to the other room with a beautiful view of one of the ponds with a fountain on the top floor. Great location, bad room from the standpoint of cleanliness and general maintenance. We found the patio doors to be filthy to the point of it being distracting trying to look at the view! There was dust everywhere and I mean thick fuzzy stuff along the baseboard throughout the room like they never vacuum the edges of the carpet. Also, there were handprints and spots all over the front of the microwave and around the sink and cupboard doors. The loveseat was filthy! And the cushions were sinking into the sofabed frame. Not comfortable. We sat on the bed while watching TV. Then when I took a shower I looked up to find black mold on the shower wall in several places but worse yet, a large patch of it on the vinyl shower curtain liner! Needless to say, I called and spoke to housekeeping and was assured it would all be corrected. Just minutes after we returned to the room later in the day, the housekeeping manager arrived at our door to see if all had been done. I showed her everything and she said the shower curtain liner was supposed to be replaced by then and would ensure that it was done at 5:30 p.m as well as everything else. When we returned to our room after dinner, nothing had been done! So, we had to wait until the next day and call again!! There seemed to be a new liner in every laundry basket set outside each room for the housekeeping staff but where were they putting them??? Not in our room! Finally got it done, but the dust was still there and all the other problems. We just got tired of complaining. I would much rather stay in a hotel in the future. They are cleaned daily - at this type of resort you just get clean towels every 3rd day. Yikes! This was maybe a 3 star setting, not what we normally expect from Disney or anywhere else. I would seriously consider another option if you have the chance. And I sure would sell my vacation ownership pronto if I was an owner and encountered this situation at this property! And, of course, it just confirmed why we have never opted to become timeshare owners. There was one great person on staff that I have to say made us smile and wish we would have the opportunity to see again. His name was Jack and he worked in the lobby area and outside. Great personality and willingness to go the extra mile. Thanks, Jack!

<Title>“Very spread out on large grounds, but beautiful”
<Content>Saratoga Springs is a Disney Vacation Club property, but I think it accepts cash guests as well. It's a LARGE resort with guest rooms in lots of different buildings on the grounds. There is a central pool area next to the main check-in building and several other pools throughout the grounds. If you plan to use the Disney buses to go to and from the parks, keep in mind that it will take awhile because the buses make several stops within the resort itself before they even head over to the parks. But it's a beautiful resort, located (kind of) behind the Downtown Disney area. I think you can take a boat over to Downtown Disney, which includes the Marketplace, Pleasure Island, etc.

<Title>“Fantastic Trip”
<Content>We stayed here for 3 weeks in November. There was my Husband, daughter (8) and myself. The check in was really easy and no queue at all. We had asked for a room in the springs on a high floor. We were given a room in the carousel block overlooking the gate house. We told them we had requested the springs and they rang and tried to find us a room somewhere else. As we were staying for 3 weeks they found this difficult but eventually said we could have a room in Congress Park overlooking the swimming pool and Downtown Disney but not until the next day. We stayed for one night in carousel and had to pack up all our belongings and leave them with the porters while they got the room ready. We came back the next evening to find all our luggage already waiting for us in the new room. The staff were always friendly and very helpful and no problem was too big or small. The studio was really nice and clean. The maid service was good and she came in every day with clean towels, soap, shower gel and shampoo. A couple of times we received towel figures that my daughter thought was great. The bus service to the parks was also good. We never waited more than 5-10 minutes to get to any park. The bus stop was right outside our room and they were never crowded getting to the parks. We did encounter the odd bus that was really busy coming back from the parks but it was always manageable. The resort wasn't very busy so I don't know what it will be like in the summer. We had the free disney dining plan which was so good. We ate at all the parks and a lot of the nice hotels. Our favourites were Boma at Animal Kingdon, Park Fare 1900 at Grand Floridian and Chef Mickies at the Contemporary. We only ever had breakfast at the Artists pallette. It was basic but ok. It is really handy as you get extra drinks that you can take to the parks with you. The pool area around Congress Park is really quiet and was hardly ever used. If you are looking for a Disney Hotel that is pure Disney in your face then this is not the place for you. It is a really quiet and relaxing place without all the hype of Disney but still on Disney. I would definately reccomend this to anyone considering visiting Disney, so much so we have already booked again for this summer

<Title>“wonderful accomodations”
<Content>Grandpa, grandma, Mom, Jordan (13), Shane (10), Brylee(8) had a wonderful time in this shared space. Plenty of room for all. Our treehouse was right next to the North Bus stop. VERY IMPORTANT> .... request near a bus stop, or else you may have to walk up to 1/2 mile to catch the inter-resort bus. Which you then have to transfer at one of the actual main 'homes' (Springs, Paddock, Congress Park, Carousel, Grandstand) to catch a bus to take you to the Parks. It's time consuming. By all means take the Dining Plan with Park Hopper. It may seem expensive, but we always had left over desserts and beverages to take back to the room. A good value overall! I also packed popcorn, hot chocolate, dried fruit snacks, etc. from home. They passed Security at the airport with no problem. We used the washer/dryer with my packed DRY detergent. They provided DW soap and a fully equpped kitchen. Maid service daily. EXCELLENT!

<Title>“Way below expectations for a disney property”
<Content>On our arrival we were told that there was absolutely no other room available, which I found hard to believe as the entire time we were there we saw no one else on our floor. We were in Congress park in a 1 bedroom suite which upon daylight had no outlook at all other than trees and a swamp like area. It was freezing and the heating was inconsistent - either too hot or too cold! Our dryer didn't work properly the whole time we were there, even though we did complain. There was also black mold on the shower head which was disgusting. We were on a RCI exchange, which might explain the terrible room. We were basically in the very farthest building in the very farthest room you could stay in. The customer service was non existent, we felt like we were staying at a condo. No maid service, and very unfriendly staff the entire visit. My husband tried to get some info from the concierge, which was close to impossible unless you wanted to line up in the lobby for an hour to ask 1 question. If you tried to phone, they would put you on hold and not come back. If you need to take a taxi, they won't allow them to pick you up at your room only at the lobby. By the time we walked the 10 minutes to the lobby, they had given our taxi away and we had to wait another 30 min. (with no apology). Disneyworld itself was wonderful. and the bus shuttle service was quick and efficient. I realize that it's not a 5 star hotel, but I expected a better experience from a Disney property. Overall, very disappointed with Sarasota springs.

<Title>“Absolutely first class service, can't thank them enough!”
<Content>Our daughter married this year in Cypruss Grove Gardens and as dvc members we stayed at Saratoga Springs, our daughter and future son-in-law stayed at Port Orleans (French Quarter) and other members of family stayed in and around disney for 3 weeks. We booked a studio for 3 weeks and for one night only before the wedding, a 1 bedroom next door to the studio to enable our daughter to stay with us the night before the wedding. The view from our second floor apartments overlooked one of the lakes, which included a fountain, ducks and turtles swimming around.. We were very satisfied with the accommodation and facilities available. The 1 bedroom even had a jacuzzi in the bathroom,. There are also 2 swimming pools, spa, a small bar and restaurant, bus service, etc., and believe me these facilities were used on a regular basis over the 3 week period! The staff were friendly, hospitable and couldnt have been more helpful. Lovely restaurant (catered for a large party the night before the wedding) providiing delicious food. At one stage, one of the chef's came out to speak to our vegetarian guest to discuss what they would like to eat and then surprised us all by delivering not one vegetarian dish but two! As a family, we have been visiting Disney Florida for a number of years and have stayed at Saratogo Springs twice now. We will be going back and will definitely stay there again and I can recommend the 1 bedroom apartments highly and the studio's have everything you need as well, although if there are 3 of you staying in the studio for a long period then obviously it will get a bit cramped on occasion!

<Title>“Two Thumbs Up”
<Content>My wife and stayed here during our Christmas holiday and had a great time at Disney's Saratoga Springs. The check-in process was smooth and fast. We had a studio bedroom and it was more than enough room for the both of us. The rooms were very clean and inviting and it was definitely upto Disney's standards. The resort area was well kept and it was beautiful to say the least. One of the benefits of staying inside the Disney resort was that you could take a bus to any of the Disney parks and save on parking at the park. We definitely recommend this place. Two thumbs up!!

<Title>“Saratoga Springs wins the race for me!”
<Content>Saratonga springs is based on a upstate New York area that has horse racing. The resort is huge and seemed to have a lot of people staying there although it is very spread out so you never feel like it. The hotel is in walking distance to downtown disney and there is a boat that can also take you there. I liked how accessible this resort was to other activities besides Disney so our group could seperate and do what everyone wanted to do. FOOD- While at Saratoga Springs we ate in the Artists Palate once. It was above average sandwiches and soups. They had run out of soups by 2pm so that was annoying. For two sandwiches and chips no drinks it cost about $20. Pretty pricey but you also have the dining options at downtown disney as well. The other restaurant was more expensive but it did offer the vacation club discount of 10%. ACTIVITIES- the heated pool looked pretty amazing and was relatively busy considering it was int he 50's while we were there. We choose to rent DVD's for the resort. They had a large selection which I assume any disney resort offers this. We only had one dvd player in our villa so we had to move it to the den to watch at dvd. ROOM- We had a one bedroom effecieny apartment attached to a large one bedroom suite. The one bedroom effeciency apartemnt had a balcony, nice view of ponds, mini fridge, coffee pot, microwave. The one bedroom suite had a full kitchen even with a dishwasher. The rooms have been semi updated with granite counter tops. Very spacious closets.

<Title>“Nobody does it like Disney!”
<Content>In a nutshell, we had an amazing time at this hotel!!! Absolutely beautiful grounds, the room was ample and clean and we couldn't have asked for better service! 8 of us in a 2 bedroom villa with 2 full baths (including a Jacuzzi tub), a full kitchen, a living room, a small dining area, a washer & dryer and a beautiful balcony overlooking a gorgeously manicured golf course & lake. We are looking forward to our next trip back to Disney's Sarasota Springs Resort & Spa.

<Title>“Definitely not a "Magical" stay...not worth the hype”
<Content>We were unable to get a room at Disney for our entire stay - so we only spent a portion of our visit here (3 nights) and thank goodness!! We were extremely disappointed by this resort . We (4 adults and 1 infant) stayed in the 1 bedroom/1.5 bath villa (1 full bath plus sink and soaker tub in master) which was way too small. We went to use the in-room laundry facilities to find the washer door "lip" was black with mold. 3 calls to the front desk/housekeeping and several hours later - the problem was finally resolved. Then we went to dry the load and the dryer conked out...we called again and the unit was replaced a few hours later. Later that evening, the dryer died yet AGAIN!! Apparently a sock got caught in the motor due to the missing lint filter...sounds like the same problem with the first dryer. The slow response times were frustrating (for everything from appliance repairs to internet cables). Dining options at the resort were limited and not very tasty (turf club bar & grill served grissly steaks, had few menu options and mediocre presentation). To top our visit off - one evening, a Cast member on a golf cart was driving too fast and almost ran down our baby/stroller. I would expect cast members to be more cautious in the dark at this supposed family resort. On the positive note, the pool area was great, good location with a nice view and the rooms were clean (with the exception of our washer mold issue) and the maintenance staff were incredibly friendly and did give us some great park pointers. We had much higher expectations of a disney resort and in the future, we'll be staying off site. There are other great resorts nearby for almost 1/3 the price with more space and better customer service.

<Title>“Loved Saratoga Springs”
<Content>My family and I stayed here from 10/31 thru 11/7/09. A friend of ours let us stay on his DVC points in a 2 bdr villa. The room was very impressive and large enough for our family of 6. We have a 9 yo, 8 yo, 3 yo and 1 yo. There were a lot of cool ammenities in the room to make you feel at home. The older boys had their own room and own queen beds. They also had their own bathroom which was a plus. This was the first vacation in a long time where I din't feel cramped for space and I wasn't homesick. I love to cook and love don't like to spend a lot of money on meals since we have little ones. So the fully equipped kitchen was a money saver. We ate breakfast in the villa every morning. Some days we packed lunch to the pool. We ate dinner in the room 5 nights out of 7. The main pool was very nice for kids. There is also a really nice health club and spa. I used the gym almost every morning. I loved walking there. It was about a 5 min walk over a bridged lake. We loved this resort so much that we wound up purchasing a DVC at AKV. It could be pricey if you stayed here without a membership or a friend's points, but for a large family, the room was much needed and that's what sold us on buying.

<Title>“Peaceful & classy WDW resort”
<Content>We enjoyed a six night stay at Saratoga Springs late October 2009. Our 1 bedroom villa was in The Paddock block, about 7 minutes brisk walk from the services & facilities of the Carriage House and main pool area, which was not a problem to us. It was just 2 minutes stroll to the nearest bus stop and we found the WDW bus service to be excellent. We never waited for a bus for longer than 5 minutes the whole time, despite doing some of the more difficult journeys between parks and turning out at some of the busiest times, eg immediately after Wishes @ Magic Kingdom. Also it was only 10 minutes walk to Downtown Disney, which was handy. The villa was excellent - roomy, modern, well designed, with quality fittings/equipment, comfortable beds and good quality bathroom facilities. Air conditioning worked well and was not unduly noisy. Villa had a pleasant view over a small lake and the atmosphere around the whole place was peaceful and relaxing. This was a welcome calming contrast to exciting daily hustle and bustle of the theme parks. I find some of the very negative comments in other reviews a bit bemusing. However if you want every single part of your WDW visit to be over-the-top Disney themed, this may not be the place for you. The service from staff on site was very good throughout, in particular the housekeeping and reception area people. We booked direct with WDW and I think got good value. The total price per day for accommodation worked out at about £135GBP ($220 approx) which included the standard Disney Dining Plan for 2 adults & 1 child. The Dining Plan came as a 'free' extra when we booked and proved to be all we needed for food, having prepared our own light breakfast in the villa. The food was generally very good, particularly at Olivia's cafe and Boma. Counter service meals were OK, though difficult to find occasional healthy choices. Minor points would be - The Springs blocks would be better location for anyone wanting to be closer to main resort facilities. Congress Park looked to be a good location, especially the side overlooking the lake between S. Springs and Downtown Disney (we requested a villa in Congress Park but this did not seem to be acknowledged). Prices in the on-site shop seemed excessively high, even though I know these sort of places always are. Other WDW resorts are more centrally placed with shorter travel times to main theme parks. Overall our first stay in WDW accommodation was very positive and we would certainly return to Saratoga Springs.

<Title>“Pleasant Stay at Saratoga Springs”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at Disney’s Saratoga Springs Resort November 1 – 4, 2009. We chose this resort based on its proximity to Downtown Disney and because this appeared to have a more adult atmosphere than some other Disney resorts. We stayed in a studio room in the Grandstand section. Based on my research, I had requested to stay in either the Grandstand or Springs sections. Both of these sections are close to the main lobby and restaurants. The Grandstand bus stop is the first of 5 total bus stops within the resort. This means you will be 1st to get on the bus on the way to the parks and 1st to get off the bus on the way back. Due to the time of year, the buses were never crowded. We also never waited more than 5 minutes for a bus to arrive. They started running at 7am in the mornings. To get to Epcot, the bus ride was about 20 minutes. To get to Animal Kingdom, the bus ride was about 25 minutes. To get to Magic Kingdom, the bus ride was 25 - 30 minutes. And Downtown Disney was only a 10-minute bus ride or 10-minute boat ride away. The studio room was a pretty standard hotel room. It was very similar to a Hampton Inn or Garden Hilton. Bed and seating area, kitchenette, small bathroom with single sink vanity. The room was clean and in good condition. Daily housekeeping was more than adequate. Our only complaints regarding the room were the size of the in-room safe (barely large enough to hold my mini laptop and a cell phone) and the air conditioning unit made too much noise at times, making it difficult to sleep. Also, there was no wireless internet available, which we found unusual for a deluxe resort in this day and age. Service throughout the resort was friendly and efficient. We had checked in online prior to arriving. Once we arrived, we were given our packet and were in our room within 5 minutes. We had dinner at the Turf Club on our last night. The food and service were both excellent. We had breakfast at the Artist’s Palette one morning, and while the selection was limited, it was a fast and easy way to grab a meal. All in all, we were pleased with our choice to stay at this resort. We will be returning to Disney in a couple of years and would not hesitate to stay here again. But, since we like to try new places, we will probably end up choosing a different resort. However, this would not keep us from recommending Saratoga Springs to others based on our experience.

<Title>“Get ready to walk!!!!”
<Content>This hotel is simply wonderful for people that like to walk and explore! It is a huge compound with several bus stops for transportation to the parks. We stayed in the Grandstand--closest to the red pool, not much of a walk for us to the lobby/gift shop/restaurant/main pool. But for the elderly or for people who cannot do the walk---not a good place to stay. Our view from our room was spectacular, quiet at night, roomy room w/little kitchenette. It was wonderful to stay, but not sure we could afford to do it again!

<Title>“We love Saratoga Springs”
<Content>We went to Saratoga Springs for the 2nd time this year and stayed in the Grandstand area both times. We can't help but love this place. The environment is so serene. I like that it is one of the resorts that doesn't have much going on per se. Some of the other resorts we've been to for dining that are the deluxe level are too busy for our taste. We always drive everywhere so the location of this place is great. We even had our mother in law stay at the Port Orleans which was right around the corner. That's very nice too, but we prefer a one bedroom villa so my DH and I can have some privacy as well as our DD. Yes, this place is a little pricey, but get it with a deal such as 3 free nights or free dining. it's well worth it if you like a quiet place to unwind after your days at the park.

<Title>“Gorgeous resort but there are better on the Disney property”
<Content>Stayed with my parents and my grandmother and it was a beautiful resort as all Disney resorts are. The room was wonderful, but there was not much of a view. The pools were underconstruction which was a big disappointment, but when its finished I'm sure it will be wonderful. The food options are a little limited as well. I would recommend the Boardwalk instead or one of the resorts on the golf courses.

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>This was our second stay at the Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa. This is where my disappointment began. We've been DVC members for 12 years. We stayed at Saratoga last year and wanted to stay at a different resort this year. I made our reservations at least 2 months ago and was told that there was no availability at any other resort for the 3 nights we requested. I asked to be put on a waiting list and called back a week before our stay, but still no luck. Yet I read on Trip Advisor where people are geting upgraded from the value resorts to a one-bedroom condo. I had to use my points, for which I've spent tens of thousands of dollars to stay in a studio. We arrived for our stay after 10 p.m. after a long day of travel. I had done the online check-in and requested accomodations near transportation....this and ground floor were the only requests you could make. Our reservation was not ready when we arrived. We had to go through the entire registration process. They had to print our room keys. The celebration I'd registered online was not acknowledged and we were not asked if we were celebrating any event. Our room was at the farthest possible point from ANYTHING in the resort. We would have to drive to a pool, the gym, a restaurant, anything...and it was a very long walk to the transportation stop. The room itself was fine. I don't like the queen size bed in the studios, although they would not have room for a king. The room is surprisingly small. By the time we got to our room ( the signage at the resort is very confusing and nearly impossible to read at night due to the color scheme.), there was no option for any food, with the exception of pizza delivery, which we grudgingly ordered. The pizza box is still sitting outside of our room two nights later, since it won't fit into any of the wastecans in the villa. My hope was that housekeeping would pick it up and dispose of it. This stay did not feel like "hotel" stay. Although I don't expect daily housekeeping, I do want to feel like I'm a guest of a hotel. Didn't get it this time. I will schedule my next trip to coincide with availability at a different resort, so we can have a different experience.

<Title>“Worst Place”
<Content>We were upgraded to Saratoga Springs, from Pop Century. We had 2(1 bedrooms), and 1( studio). Staying in the Paddock (6145, 6147, 6143). If we had it to do over, we would never take the upgrade. The hallways in my opinion needed a good cleaning. The room's were the same. Paint was falling from the walls and dirty carpet. We also had refillable mugs a total waste of money. The walk to The Springs was way to long, and the bus service took forever. People were very unfriendly, and didn't make us feel at home. Artist's Palette had the okay food, and was very confusing. The only Pro I can find is the nice pools. Being our 9th trip to WDW, we were beyond upset and new think staying off disney is be a better idea. I would never buy into SSR and would never stay here again.

<Title>“No Magic at All - talked me OUT of joining DVC.”
<Content>My fiance and I had planned to stay in the Pop Century for our recent trip to WDW. I have stayed at the Contemporary, Dolphin, All-Stars and the Pop Century before. Each class of hotel has its own benefits, and we generally enjoy the Pop Century since we spend almost all of our time in the park. Also, the Pop has great theming, nice pools, and a large food court with a good variety. About a month before our trip we received an email offering a free upgrade to either Old Key West or Saratoga Springs. Not being a fan of Old Key West, we opted for Saratoga. Our plane landed around midnight and got us to Saratoga Springs around 1am. We had checked in online in advance to speed up the process, so when we got to the lobby, we went to the express checkin line. We stood there for about 5 minutes while everyone stared at us, so we then put ourselves on the main wait line. When I finally got to the desk, the cast member acted like I was wasting her time for not getting on the right line - very rude. Then when I asked her how long it would take in the morning to get to Hollywood Studios, she answered "a little while". When I asked her to be more specific she said "an hour". I said "an hour?" she smirked rudely and said. "Yep." SO RUDE! We were then outside waiting for a bellhop to drive us to our room which took another 10 minutes of waiting outside with no cast members around. Finally we get to our room. It was ok. Clean, but kinda boring, and NO magic at all. I know this is themed like Saratoga Springs, but they easily could have incorporated Mickey or something into the decor. They do it all the time in the parks. The next morning we realized that our room was very VERY far from either the main lobby or even a pool. I'm used to walking a bit at the Pop Century, but this was unacceptable. Also I am really not a fan of these huge resorts with multiple buildings. You spend most of your time walking through parking lots to the bus stop. You may as well stay at a Days Inn. We called the front desk and explained that we were unhappy. I wanted to switch back to the Pop Century. I was so upset b/c I didn't even feel like I was at Disney. We asked for a different room, and they were so rude and unwilling to help. We finally had to ask for a manager who moved us to the OTHER far side of the resort, but at least it was closer to a pool. The pool themeing was minimal and underwhelming. The hot tub was so overly chlorinated my eyes hurt and I had to get out. The food court is way to small for a resort of that size, and doesn't have many options. Overall, it was my worst resort experience in my 30 years of visiting Disney. We had been thinking of joining the DVC, but I know now that I won't. Maybe it's me, but when I go on vacation I don't want to be at my "home away from home". I wanna be on vacation. With maid service. Without a kitchen. But that's just me.

<Title>“Better than we expected would stay here again in 2010 excellent hotel”
<Content>I want to add this is our 17th trip to WDW in which we've stayed in Disney Resort Hotels 15 times, this is out 1st stay at Saratoga Springs. Arrived at check desk 1900hrs Aug 29th, to be greeted by many staff as there were no queues. The lady i spoke to was English very polite and professional and went out of her way to add celebrations to our trip and confirmed they had managed to meet our choice of location 'The Springs' in the building opposite the main pool. We always place a request about 7days before we arrive stating where and why we would like to stay, there are no guarentee's however we have been lucky i guess. Yes it is a large resort and we could have ended up way out in the sticks, however i was happy we got what we wanted. Our view was of partial downtown disney rooftops and a little pool, we had a top floor view. Great view of hot air balloons on a morning and the characters in flight balloon. One thing to point out though with regards to the staff there were some clients blaming service desk staff for a rainy day, they were asking staff 'what they should wear' due to a few rain clouds. They became irrate when staff were unable to answer? (who could answer?) as they had come for sunshine (havent we all) so i believe the staff have enough to contend with. What im saying is people blame the resort for simple things, im glad i took no notice of the previous negative reviews, i would have missed out on a great trip this year. I understand there is such thing as a bad resort stay too (i have had one) i just get annoyed when reading reviews, as to what people are complaining about. Arrived at our room which was a studio which was lovelly and clean, windows were slightly grubby (finger marks) but who cares i'm not staring at those all day. I had my daughter '6' and niece '12' with us, who gladly shared a sofa bed and did not complain of back ache etc etc, whilst me and husband shared a comfortable king size bed. I have a decent 'Milbrook' bed at home and preferred the hotel bed. I think if you cant sleep on the hotels bed then you have'nt exercised enough around the resort or theme parks. The sheets were changed once a week and we rec'd daily mousekeeping, as were were'nt staying as a vacation club member, so we rec'd toiletries too. I would say more coathangers are needed for a 2wk stay, so we took our own always do. Parking was great plenty of spaces outside the building,there was a lift if we needed it, which we took when we had the luggage. Pool was excellent plenty of loungers, lifeguards, clean towels and tables, normal Disney standards really. Great slide and kiddies wet area, choice of x2 hot tubs and surroundings were preasant too. The pool bar opened late morning and closed pretty early, then again its not Vegas or Benidorm. There was a drinks refil station outside next to the pool bar for those who purchase the refil mugs, however it seemed to attract wasps, which end up in your drink - be warned. There was plenty of activities around the pool area daily such as: Disco, Bingo, Hula Hooping and Pool movies at 8pm, my daughter enjoyed them all. They have programmes at the front desk with all the activities such as crafts in the clubhouse etc on and movie times. Transportation - we had a car as we hate waiting around, we took the bus once back from another resort after dinner and it was a nightmare, not Disneys fault though it was down to an over reactive client scratching her leg. We tried the boat, but it was too relaxing for me its ok if you have time to kill, great views though of the new treehouse villas, as we had to pick up there. Gate house staff are so polite and friendly no matter what, they never get a mention, but they are part of this resort and do a great job in welcoming you. We had free dining, so we had booked all our table services 90 days prior to get where we prefer, variety - The food was great, the Artists Palette (counter service) was'nt huge but did the job for a quick counter service fix. I would have liked a burger and fries, although no fries im afraid just kettle chips, we survived by going to Beaches and Cream at the Beach Club for our burgers. I understand the need to develop a healthy approach to meal times. There are other places to go if you need typical american fare. Bakery items were lovelly and fresh whatever time of the day. They sell grocery items for those with cooking facilities. The shop wasnt as large as ones in other resorts, however they had what we needed. The Turf Club was excellent, only went once, we booked prior to our visit and can understand if it was fully booked constantly. Saff were very acommodating toward my niece who was a fussy eater. We never took a surrey bike around the resort, will hopefully do that 2010 trip, as there is plenty of facilities onsite to try. Our avid Disney lover friends came to visit us at Saratoga, who were staying nearby Disney resort, they were overwhelmed with the resort and tried the walk from the resort to Disney Marketplace and said it was fine 10 mins. They dont have hire cars and would prefer the resort simply because they can walk to the marketplace to catch a bus to the many resorts for dinner reservations, a 10 min walk to marketplace saves waiting on 2 buses. We are just waiting for the offer to come back on for 2010 Saratoga Springs, then we will be returning for trip #18.

<Content>Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort is a Disney Vacation Club Resort that Disney upgraded us to from Pop Century. So we were "cash paying" customers instead of being Vacation Club members. We got a 1 bedroom villa and it will spoil us for all other vacations...with 740sqft, full kitchen, washer/dryer, and a bedroom for the parents, who wouldn't be spoiled. We didn't spend much time in the room b/c we were in the parks all day, but when there, it was a very relaxing and nice resort. Since we were a cash paying customer, we had room service everyday (not sure how it works with DVC). Our "Mousekeeper" would wash any dishes that we didn't get clean before heading out to the parks. We were also left detergent (laundry and dish) when we ran out of either. It was nice coming back to made beds and clean towels every evening. I'm sorry I can't speak for all of the amenities, but I'm assuming they are up to the quality of everything in our little section (the Grandstand). There was a pool for our section that my kids used once. The main pool wasn't a long walk from our room and had a water slide (we didn't use it). The main pool was more crowded than our "quiet" pool and my kids shared "our" pool we 2 other kids so they had it good! The Grandstand is also the 1st of 5 bus stops coming and going. You're on first going to the parks and off first coming home in the evening. We didn't interact with the Cast Members at the resort much, but when we did, they were nice and helpful. My family really enjoyed the stay, and while we would opt for a "value" resort in the future (we're not at the resorts enough to warrant the $$), the Saratoga Springs Resort is a great place to stay.

<Title>“A Blast!”
<Content>My friend had a time share to this resort and he wanted to take his wife and son along with my family also. all together it was a total of seven people and we all stayed in one room and we fit comfortably! this resort is very close to all the Disney parks including Sea World and Universal. The Pools were also incredable the big pool has a great slide for the kids. the smaller pool is cool too becuase it has a great view of Downtown Disney. Overall we loved this place and cant wait to go back!!

<Title>“Not the greatest Disney experience”
<Content>As a DVC member, I have stayed at most of the Vacation Club Resorts. Saratoga is actually one of my favorites...if you can get a room in Congress Park, which has only happened once. This time around I stayed in the Grandstand section. It has it's own themed pool and splash area for the kids, as well as a pool bar. Which seems odd to me, because it is a VERY short walk to the main pool. I think the Paddock or the Carousel areas would benefit more from having a themed pool area, but it's not that big of a deal. All areas have a pool, themed or not. Check in was easy, I did ask for a room change to Congress Park, but no rooms were available. We checked into our room in the Grandstand and we had a partial view of the pool. Unfortunately, the fridge was leaking and the floor was soaked. Getting your room changed in a resort the size of this one is an experience that should be used for torture, in my opinion. It's not like you can just take the elevator down to the front desk. Changing our room was at least an hour long process, that was NOT pleasant. The front desk employees were completely unhelpful, if not rude. Finally, our room was changed and it was fine. Housekeeping is a joke at this resort. Every corner had inches of caked on dirt and dust. The top of the armoire was covered in a layer of dust, there was mold in the bathroom, etc. The rooms look much older than they are. Overall, I am a big fan of Saratoga Springs...but this trip left me a little bit disappointed. I will continue to stay here, but next I'm going to try out the treehouse villas. If you happen to get a room in the Grandstand, I hope you don't have a car....the lack of parking spaces is a joke.

<Title>“Clean, very spacious, great amenities, highly recommend.”
<Content>We were upgraded to this Disney resort. It's a huge complex, but Disney bus stops are available throughout the resort. Rooms were nice. Definitely convenient to have full kitchen and washer/dryer. Would stay here again if upgraded, but would not pay regular rate to stay. Food Court did not have a wide variety of meal options compared to the food court at Pop Century. Pools were nice and children enjoyed activites, such as movie night at the pool. Would definitely stay here again if given the opportunity.

<Title>“Spectacular Stay”
<Content>This summer we returned to Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort for the second time with our 18mth old daughter. We stayed in a one bedroom villa which had a full kitchen, washer and dryer and a jacuzzi tub. Our room overlooked one of the ponds and we had a great view. We were close to the main pool and dining area. Every day the pool had activities for children and the dining area offered nightly dinner specials. It was also a close walk to Downtown Disney OR you could take the hotel's ferry. In addition the busses to the DIsney parks were pretty frequent and it was a pretty quick trip to the parks. The only negative is that if you are at the 1st bus stop you have 3 more stops before you exit the park. Overall we loved the hotel and enjoyed the trip. One suggestion is that if you use Tiffany's transportation to and from the airport they offer a free stop at the local grocery shop. This is WELL worth it and we ate breakfast and some dinners in our room which was PERFECT for our daughter and we saved tons of money.

<Title>“Wonderful week a a beutiful resort.”
<Content>This was my 3rd visit to Disney and first to Saratoga Springs. My group included myself, my wife, our three sons (3,9, and 11), and my sister and her daughter who is also 11. We booked a 2 bedroom villa in the Carousel section of this large resort. My experience here was nothing short of wonderful. We all really enjoyed the large spacious accomadations as well as the beautifully landscaped and well planned out grounds. Our section had a great smaller pool with a childrens play area (they had sprinker guns shaped like horses), as well a ahot tub and walk up pool bar. The main pool was less than a 5 minute walk away and was large complete with waterslide and large screen movie screen which showed was showing Disney movies all week. If you stay I would recommend staying in this section since it was the first of 5 stops that the resort buses went to leaving the resort as well as coming back from the parks. Our room had a large, well stocked kitchen as well as a whirpool tub in the master bedroom. we also had a full size washer and dryer and all the laundry soa (Tide) as well as kitchen dish soap and diswasher soap was provided. The on site restaurants were good and also less than a 5 minute walk away, or less by bus. We even took boat rides to and from downtown Disney which we never had to wait more than 10-15 minutes for. Overall this was a great location and we even had a great view of the beautiful golf course outside or balcony. All in all I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a large room with grat views as well as the Disney touches too.

<Title>“Great family vacation at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort”
<Content>We had a very clean studio in the Paddock section - it was nice and quiet despite being in close proximity to the bus stop. The kids LOVED the main pool and water slide - we particularly enjoyed swimming at night and movies by the pool! We look forward to staying at SSR again!

<Title>“Treehouse Villas were a perfect fit for us”
<Content>We recently made our first family trip Disney World, which included my in-laws, our kids - ages 5 & 1, my husband and myself. We were looking for a property that was reasonably priced and that would house all of us in one location. The Saratoga Springs Treehouses were the perfect fit! Our treehouse so was roomy - we had 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, living room, dining room, and kitchen. All this made us feel more at home and was so nice not being cramped up in 1 or 2 hotel rooms for a week...especially with a 1 year old! Having the kitchen and washer/dryer was also so nice so we were able to do laundry & didn't have to pack as many clothes and we also brought along our own snack food to save money. We had read a few reviews on the treehouses before we left and alot of the negativity about them was about the location. The treehouses are spread out and not all that close to the main property, but there is bus service to get there, which we always allowed 10 mintues for. We also requested that our treehouse be close to one of the two bus stops which was a huge advantage as well. All the bus transfers was kind of a hassle to make it to the Disney Parks, but from what I understand this is quite common with a lot of the Disney Resorts since they are so big. What we liked least about the Treehouse was the AC didn't work that well and you were unable to control the ceiling fans in the bedrooms. Also the flooring was hard to walk on with barefeet...I think they tried to keep it looking rustic with the decor, but it wasn't the best choice. If we had to do it over again though we would definately stay there again!!

<Title>“Beautiful resort”
<Content>This resort is absolutely beautiful and is so peaceful to come back to after a busy day in the parks. All of the cast members were extremely helpful, especially Bell services who seemed to go above and beyond in their efforts to help. House keeping was excellent and even allowed us a late checkout at no extra charge. The grounds were stunning and my 3 year old loved the main pool with its slides and fountains more than anything else on the holiday. The 1 bed apartment was spacious and clean, and the jacuzzi tub was excellent for relaxing after a long day walking round the parks. The proximity to Downtown Disney was fantastic and we often went over on the boat in the evening to get fish and chips from Cookes of Dublin and then got the bus back to eat it in the apartment. With a 3 year old we knew we would be spending more time in the room than if it was just my husband and myself, so it was great to have the extra space with the 1 bed apartment, and the washer and dryer was very handy. We stayed at this resort in Sep for 2 weeks and we were in the Carousel section in the building furthest away from the bus stop and if there was anything negative to say about the resort it would be the distance we had to walk after getting off the buses when returning from the parks. It seems a bit ridiculous to complain about the walking when on holiday at Disney, but it was particularly hot and humid and after sitting on the air conditioned bus for the journey back from the park it seemed exhausting when alighting back into the humidity. That was probably as much to do with the temperatures as the distance, because as soon as the humidity dropped it was a pleasure to walk around the resort regardless of the distance, and as I commented before it would be the only gripe at this resort. We will definitely be returning to this resort.

<Title>“Have a Magical Day! Yes we did!”
<Content>We were upgraded to Saratoga Springs from the Allstar Movie Resort for free...that was a nice bonus for our first visit to Disney! The whole process of the magical express bus bringing us to our resort went wonderfully...and check in was a breeze! Everything was put in a folder for us, and ready since we took advantage of the early online check-in. We found our building with ease, thanks to the map they gave us...and the rooms were clean and pleasant! The housekeeping staff was wonderful, always left more than enough supplies for the room daily... If you are looking for the "DISNEY FEEL" however, this may not be the resort you want.... this ambiance is more of a regular resort and spa...no Mickey mouse overloads here. But, after being in the parks all day, and being Mickey Mouse(d) to death.....this might be a good thing,lol. My daughter, age 12, did not seem to care at all. She did however love the main pool area, the water slide, and the fact that they played nightly poolside movies on a big screen! They do have anarcade for kids poolside also, although we never seemed to take advantage of that...too busy swimming I guess. The other quiet pools and hot tubs were just as enjoyable, especially latenight after the parks! Free laundry facilities poolside were also a nice touch, and a pleasant surprise. Even though the resort seems to be the largest and most spread out of the Disney resorts....we found that the map makes it seem like there would be a far walk everywhere, but that wasn't the case at all...Artist Pallette had mediocre selections as far as food, and we did not try the Turf Club,sorry.ONE RECOMENDATION TO DISNEY-AT THE END OF PARK HOURS,MORE BUSES DISPATCHED FOR THIS HOTEL...Although the wait wasn't too long, the buses filled up fast, and when everyone's feet are aching at the end of the day, nobody is in the mood to wait for the next bus. It just seemed that alot of the other resorts had multiple buses waiting inline.

<Title>“Good, but won't be returning”
<Content>Stayed at the SSR with my husband, his 22 yr old daughter and our 2 1/2 yr old. After 8 days here's my take on this place. The good: The pool was absolutely fantastic. Very shallow, so it was pretty safe for kids. Had separate slides for adults and toddlers, a zero entry area with shade, and a splash section for the little ones. We really, really loved the pool. Room - 1 bedroom suite was comfortable and view to a pond was beautiful. Stayed at the Springs, which is right next to the main building (front desk, restaurants,main pool). Very convenient. Front desk - service is outstanding - like any other 5 star resort. Our 22 yr old hurt her shoulder and the front desk put us in contact with a drugstore that made deliveries to the resort (got everything within half hour). Absolutely no hassles. Also, our toddler got sick and we did not want to expose him to a clinic, so we got in-room doctor services ($300, but worth it). Magical express - used it for return to airport. It was comfortable, punctual, and a nice ride. Although they put on a video selling anything Disney that lasts for most of the trip. Airline Check in - long line at 10 am Sat. Plan for at least 1 hour. However, we were able to get our boarding passes and check our luggage in (and avoid the airport hassle). Great advantage and worth the line. Location was also good for a mixed party like ours. We would go to Downtown at night using the boat service, which was quite efficient. The bad: OMG! The food at the Artists Pallette!!! If you plan to stay here for a while, either cook or have lots of restaurant reservations. We could not get into the main restaurant, so many of our meals were at the Pallette. Food is boring at best, and the selection is grossly limited. Flatbreads are plain, sandwiches are always cold, nothing is outstanding. Very very expensive cafeteria food. Also, there is no room service (only pizza delivery). The hotel is beautiful, but not themed (don't believe the horse racing thing). It looks and feels like a well kept apartment complex. There is no Disney feeling here, which was a major dissapointment. The ugly: Housekeeping is mediocre at best. They have a habit of placing baskets with supplies on the floor in front of your door, which I consider unsanitary (towels touching a hallway floor?). Also, they have supply carts all over the hallways - at all hours, even at night (check my photos). This is quite unsightly, and made it difficult to maneuver a stroller around corners. Cleaning the room was limited to doing the bed, changing the towels (and I have my doubts about this one), and throwing some (not all) of the dishes into the washer. For $500/night and a daily tip I do expect the room to look sparkling clean. Did not happen - things were in the exact same position we left them. Also, the cutlery in the kitchen drawers had (food?) residues and looked gross. Very very dissapointing service. Overall, this is a fine resort, although overpriced for what you get. If you absolutely must stay on Disney property, I would strongly suggest one of the other themed resorts. I will not be staying here again, mainly for the housekeeping issues, but also because there is no theming and it feels quite generic.

<Title>“The Truth - Saratoga Springs”
<Content>Third year in a row,third different Disney resort. Check out my other reviews on AKL and Poly........This is the truth people from a regular person just like you. We recieved a free upgrade from ASMovies and were excited about staying on this property. First of all the cast was great at SSR. All of them were very friendly and helpful. Mousekeeping was efficient and did a great job. The room was clean folks but the outside of the buildings and grounds could have used a bit of attention. We were in the Congress Park building and the view of DTD from the quiet pool and viewing area was special. I've had Savanna and Majic Kingdom Castle view and this view was right there with those. I'll have to admit that it was a short walk to the main building or you could wait on a bus.By the time you caught an in house bus though you would already be there just by walking. Springs and Grandstand were also this way as far as being reasonably close. This resort did not have that same "Disney Majical Feel" to it. It really was like an apartment complex on Disney property but that's not saying it was bad,just different. It's a very quiet ,relaxing resort. You don't get that awe inspiring feeling here like you do when you first walk in AKL or Wilderness lodge and it's not a "Disney fun" place like Pop or All-Stars. It is however a beauitful and polished resort. The main pool WAS a blast and the slide was great (not too crowded). My kids and i went to our quiet pool at congress park every night at about 10:30 for a late relaxing swim. Had it almost to ourselves. The food court/gift shop Artist Palette was smallish(and i do mean small) but very clean and the food although limited in choices was great..Turf Club Bar and Grill is a nice restaurant but it aint no Jiko. Online check - in was about a one minute process.The buses were about what you would get at any other resort,about every 15 minutes or so. At park closings,buses were crowded as expected.Overall we enjoyed our trip and are glad we got to experience a DVC resort for the price of value but we probably wouldn't stay for a second time.Just not Disney enough for us. We would recommend SSR to all of you.It's a Disney vacation you want to at least do once if you are like us and come every year or many times a year. Great vacation thanks to Disney.......again.

<Title>“Wonderful Resort”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here from 09/07/09 - 09/12/09. We absolutely loved this resort. We were upgraded from one of the value resorts. We stayed in the Grandstand section and loved it. The pool and hot tub for this section were great. We also loved that we were the first stop on the bus route, big plus. Also this section was great because there is a bus that goes from the main lobby and pool area to the Grandstand. That is not the case for the other sections of the resort. The other sections would have to take a bus going ouside the resort and then back to go from the main section to theirs. Also loved it because it was a very quite section. We stayed in a one room suite. No complaints. Our room was very clean. We did the online check in and so when we got there we simply walked up to the online check in counter, received our vacation packet and were on our way in less than 5 minutes. The only negative I can say is that once we were on our own the first time we were completely confused on the resort layout. The map that they give you at check in isn't the greatest. We didn't realize that we could have taken a bus directly to our section at that time. But that was only a one time thing and we were being stubborn and trying to figure it out on our own. The main pool at this resort is great. My husband loved the water slide. We spent an entire afternoon down at the pool. We also liked that it was close to DownTown Disney. Overall we loved this resort and would highly recommend it to anyone that is considering it.

<Title>“All what you would expect, and tips when booking your holiday.....”
<Content>Travelled Aug 2 2009 through to Aug 23 2009. We have stayed at Disney's Port Orleans resort for the last four years and fancied a change. Afetr visiting Saratoga Springs through the Vacation club in 2008, we decided to give it a try for this year. We were not disapointed. Being a 'show home' for the Vacation Club, this place gets even more attention to detail than other Disney resorts. We booked a one bedroom villa for our family of four (2 teenage girls) and found we had plenty of room. These rooms come with a fully equipped kitchen with cooker, huge fridge, washing machine & tumble dryer, a seperate shower room, bathroom and huge jacuzzi tub (set up so you can watch tv from it!) seperate lounge with huge TV and DVD player. Saratoga Springs theme is of Victorian horse stables/equestrian centre, with the LBV golf course surrounding the property on one side and the river on the other, the setting for this resort is awesome. We stayed three weeks this year and as usual had a fantastic time, Disney has so much to offer, Orlando even more with Universal studios and Sea World, for people who don't want to lounge around on the beach for two weeks, this is the only place to come. Booking early last year got us Free Disney dinning. This offer is the best, we ate in all the top Disney restaurants including Cinderellas castle, Grand Floridian, Magic Kingdom etc, This included 6 restaurants with character dinning (great for the kids, autographs, photos etc), we added up our receipts and lost count at $2800!! and we still came home with some points unused. This offer will save you fortunes and take the worry away from where shall we eat. We book on line with Disney directly and then get seperate flights and car hire avoiding the extras a travel company may add to your costs. For example, this years holiday was booked last year when we returned home. Booking early gets you some good incentives like Disney dinning. This holiday was for 2 adults, & 2 kids (14 & 11) three weeks in the stunning Saratoga Springs resort, 21 day Disney passes, FREE Disney dinning plan, plus a few other benefits came to £3300.00 add flights from Virgin £2400.00 car hire from Netflights (Dodge Charger) for three weeks £400.00..... all done. The FREE Disney dinning plan will save you fortunes, I promise. Last time we checked, the same holiday booked through Virgin was £8360.00, we payed £6100.00. We have booked same again for next year (2010), there are seven of us this time in a two bedroom villa at Saratoga Springs, we got all the same extras and this has worked out at £850.00 each. We need to add flights and car, this can be done in January when you get the big airline sales....... I hope this has helped you.

<Title>“We were upgraded to the Saratoga Springs and glad we were”
<Content>We recently stayed at Saratoga Springs. We were originally supposed to be staying at Pop Century but were upgraded for free to a one bedroom villa at Saratoga Springs. We were pleasently surprised after reading some bad reviews. I called a week prior and requested a room in Springs area since that building is close to the main pool and food court. My request was granted. BEing so close was much easier with three small children. The room were very nice and clean. There was a kings size bed in the bedroom which all five of us, my husband, and three little ones fit and slept in. There was a washer and dryer in the room whcih was very convenient since we were caught in a rain storm one afternoon. IT was just easy to throw clothes and sneakers in the dryer there. We visited the food court twice. The food was ok. we ahd the flatbreads and thought they were average. The pool was very nice, the water warm and my little ones enjoyed it very much. The staff was friendly. We were there celebrating our anniverary and we had on our celebration pins which always got a Happy Anniversary out of cast members we encountered. I would have liked to have spent more time at the resort but our days were spent mostly at the parks. We drove our car so we never had to worry about bus transportation. The parks were very close to the resort. I think the furthest away was Animal Kingdom. Overall we had a pleasant stay at Saratoga Springs.

<Title>“Fantastic Resort - already booked to go back....”
<Content>For the last couple of years we have stayed at the Port Orleans resort so I thought it would be a good idea to compare a Deluxe Villa resort with a moderate resort as well as just review SSR in it’s own right. Let me start by saying that we loved SSR and have already booked to go back next year (In a one bedroom rather than a studio) so don’t be put off if some of my initial comments seem a little negative in comparison with POR Firstly lets look at size. SSR is big. There are lots of reports saying that you need a car to get around this place. You don’t. What you need is the will to walk. We stayed in Congress Park, opposite Downtown Disney and about as far from the main pool and restaurant etc as it is possible to get. The walk takes about 5 to 6 minutes; a bit of a pain if it’s raining hard but not too bad if you remember what your legs are for. If you are not good at walking then just take your time. The scenery is mainly very pleasant and you are on vacation so why rush. Take a while to look at the trees for the Hawks (these have a tendency to eat the ducks, which isn’t very Disney); or look at the turtles in the ponds (there are loads) and make sure you avoid the snakes (we saw one about 4 ft long sunning itself in the hedge next to the path). The kids will also love all the frogs and lizards. It must be said that the walk from Congress Park to The Springs (the central area of SSR) is not very Disney either. The area around the rooms is very nicely landscaped and very pretty, especially at night. However, the central road does feel and look very much like an access road (which, of course, it is). The Disney “imagineers” must have had the day off when this bit was designed. When comparing this resort with POR there are some down-sides. The restaurant/Shop are much smaller that POR and have a much smaller selection. They don’t even serve pancakes at breakfast! I can only assume that this is because SSR is a villa resort and most guests are expected to buy and cook their own food. Although much smaller than POR we never had a long wait for breakfast. In addition the reception area is smaller and not very heavily staffed and the Arcade (if you have younger children) is tiny in comparison. There were also a lot of broken machines and some wag had walked off with the puck from the air-hockey table when we were last there. The main pool is very large and very well designed. They show movies around the pool nightly (although these are tricky to hear and we never made it through one without a thunderstorm closing the pool area – not something even Disney can control). The down-side with the pool (the same was true of POR) is that at 9pm the life-guards go off duty and this is seen as an excuse for the “older kids” to take-over the pool. At this point the pool area stops feeling like Disney and starts feeling like summer break in the Bahamas. Unless your kids are ok with having a twenty something jump on them in the middle of the pool it’s probably a good idea to beat a hasty retreat at this point. Sadly the “quiet pools” tend to suffer from the same problem (predominately, I report with much sadness, caused by my own countrymen). Lets get to the room now. The room was very good, although not significantly larger that at POR. Where it did have a big advantage though was with a balcony (or patio on the ground floors) which opened the whole room up and made it much lighter than the rooms at POR. Another significant advantage is the pseudo-central air. POR has the old-fashioned in-window aircon units that sound like they are made by jet-engine manufacturers. SSR has a locked-closet (by the kitchenette in the case of a studio) that contains the aircon unit and this is then pumped in centrally. I say pseudo because the aircon unit is still technically in the room and still a bit louder than I would ideally like but it is a lot better than POR (oddly the temperature controls didn’t really seem to work either – whatever I did with them it was either too hot or too cold). One other area that didn’t really work for us is the pull-out bed. The studio apartments have one double bed (which is extremely comfortable) and a sofa-bed. For 2 this would be ideal, and it does serve to make the room look bigger. However, when in use the sofa-bed is not all that comfortable and certainly not big enough for teenagers and above. The room would have been better served with the more traditional 2 bed layout in my opinion. See, I told you it would sound like I was being very negative. Now for the good stuff. The room feels very much higher quality that POR and having large sliding doors to the balcony gives you a much greater feeling of space and certainly affords better lighting. There are other nice touches too, like the DVD player and the radio-alarm with an iPod doc so you can listen to and charge your iPod whilst in the room. The soundproofing is also superb. Although there was some evidence of external noise this was extremely limited. What noise there was unfortunately came from the afore-mentioned testosterone-fuelled antics around the pool late into the night. Because of the time of year we visited the view of downtown Disney was obscured by trees, but the view we did have was still very pleasant. One thing Disney do get wrong in all of their hotels (IMHO) is the size of the safe. As with POR the safe was a maximum of an inch deep. This is fine for money or passports but not much good for those of us that travel with several thousand dollars/pounds worth of camera equipment. I’m not expecting a walk-in vault, but something big enough a camera would be good, other hotels seem to manage it ok. So to sum-up; the grounds have lovely landscaping, the rooms are excellent and for us the location was ideal (we used the restaurant at downtown Disney a lot, which we could easily walk to from our room). Oh, and one final thing that always seems contentious, the Disney transportation system. We had no problems with busses going to SSR (and we were there for 19 days with no car). However, there were delays sometimes in the busses going to the parks and you can often find you have been on a bus for 45 minutes and ended up 100 yards from where you started. This is not unique to SSR however. Would we go back? Absolutely (already re-booked for Aug next year). Would we recommend it? Absolutely.

<Title>“Another Fantastic Stay”
<Content>My husband and 9 year old son stayed here from 11th to 28th August. We booked with Disney UK who were offering free dining on top of 44% off so a great deal. Infact it was cheaper than staying at say Caribbean Beach. We had a 1 bed villa in the Grandstand section, which in my opinion is the best area of the resort. It has it's own wonderful pool and only a couple of minutes walk from the main reception area, restaurants and main pool. Its worth calling to request a room as we got exactly what we asked for. The room was lovely and both the bed and sofa bed were very comfortable. Housekeeping were very good and the whole resort is very clean. We ate several times in the Turf Club which is one of our favourite restaurants at Disney. The quick service fodd is also very good and and freshly prepared. There were lots of daily activities including pool parties and movies by the pool. I really can't think of anything bad to say and will definitely be going back.

<Title>“Amazing service beautiful hotel best holiday ever!”
<Content>We stayed in the Springs section which was perfect for the pool and restaurants. Yes they did get busy at peaks times but nothing unusual. STUDIO ROOM Wider than expected from the pics of it! Very nice size, room was extremely clean and cleaned every day no probs at all.Lots of room. Extremely well lit internal corridors to room. TRANSPORT Disney buses were excellent. 80% of the time a bus arrived within 5 minutes and only once were we let down, after the Fantasmic show at Hollywood Studios where it took 2 hours to get back. (Avoid Fantasmic 10pm show if Magic Kingdom is going to be busy as they divert available buses to there eg. no magic hours elsewhere so everyone goes to the Magic Kingdom) SERVICE If you've not stayed at disney before you'll be amazed by the service. Going to be difficult getting used to British service again! FACILITIES Gym was the best Ive seen at a hotel. Pool is nice but very shallow, great for kids of course. Lots of people leave towels on beds and disappear for hours, not fair!! Spa looked amazing but expensive. We liked both the quick service and the table service (you DO have to reserve in August!!) DISNEY EXPRESS Were really let down. Didnt get our bags for 16 hours. We never received a yellow tag that you add to your bag to ensure quick collection.(MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ONE) Our flight was delayed so we arrived at 9.45pm just in time for them to collect your bags for you, but the lady at Magic Express never told us that our bags wouldnt arrive until the next morning otherwise we would have collected them ourselves, Didnt sleep expecting them to arrive 12pm-1am. If you are arriving in Orlando via an internal flight I would suggest collecting them yourself if it is late evening as its easy to do and a short walk to the Disney Express. LOCATION Very close to all the parks, around 15mins ride. We walked to downtown disney a number of times. (go through the turf club and around the path to Cirque de soliel.) If you are worried about walking a lot all the buses do a loop of Saratoga first so you can catch a bus to the main pool, restaurant etc every 5 mins. We absolutely loved our holiday here! We had the Dinning Plan added for free and easily saved £1200. Reserve the table services as soon as you can (90 days before you leave) as they were very full in August. Oh one other thing under no circumstances use the phone in the room. We had to make a 25 minute phone call, -£180

<Title>“absolutely wonderful!”
<Content>we recently returned from a 5 day trip to disney and were lucky enough to get a free upgrade to saratoga springs. we stayed in the springs section of the resort which i would highly recommend. we were about 2 minutes from the main pool and building which was very convenient. my girls loved the pool and water slide. we stayed in a studio which was very spacious and perfect for the 4 of us. room was very clean. balcony view could have been better but was still very nice. we have stayed at other disney resorts in the past and saratoga springs was by far our favorite! we loved the quick ferry ride to downtown disney. the scenery around the resort is beautiful. will definitely return! thanks for the upgrade disney!!

<Title>“Excellent”
<Content>We have just returned from Orlando . We stayed at Disneys Saratoga springs in a one bedroom villa. we have stayed on Disney in the past and thought it was OK but Saratoga springs is special, very clean,safe and the staff could not be better. This is by far the best place i have stayed in orlando. Saratoga springs is a large area which is split into smaller areas , we stayed in Congress park which was across the lake from downtown disney. if you are a keen golfer you could stop at the Grandstand which is set within a fantastic golf course. when we go back to orlando we will be staying at Saratoga springs again.

<Title>“Disney is wonderfully magical for all!”
<Content>From the evening me and my dughters arrived until the moment we left, I was totally impressed by the service. The enjoyable part was that this hotel was enjoyable for the young to the young at heart. With Downtown Disney being only a short walk away, though you can take advantage of the free shuttle or boat service, there was so much to do and see. Pleasure Island appeals to the adult crowd and has an abundance of things to do. The Cirque du Soleil permanent attraction, Bongos Restaurant (cuban fare) and the shopping district made for a well rounded entertainment experience. The hotel itself sits on a quiet area with golf not too far away, actually across the road! The view is nice from any of the rooms, from what I could see. I had a 1 bedroom villa that was plenty enough room for myself and four girls. The oldest ones (15 and 19) shared the full sized sofabed while myself and 4 and 9 year old daughters shared the queen bed. The shower area is wonderful, the jacuzzi tub was wonderul, which was a surprise and provided much relief after a long day of walking. The pool area was very clean, well staffed and had plenty of seating for those of us just wanting to relax. I recommend getting groceries from the "Artist's Palette" as it may get expensive eating out daily and a small meal prepared is nothing compared to the wonderful time you will be having. The Papa John's offers delivery and they were scrumptious! Of course there is DisneyWorld and other theme park attractions nearby to keep everyone busy. My youngest had their first trip to DisneyWorld and are still over the moon! There is not much more to say about this hotel without sounding biased. Oh, the staff is international and I met so many people from around the globe as well as a young man from my hometown! The staff is really commited to giving excellent customer service and the Disney reputation is safe with them! I wish I could've stayed longer but plan on going to the resort area for many years to come.

<Title>“Great family hotel, couldn't ask for more....”
<Content>We stayed here in July for 7 nights and just adored it. Having previously stayed at Disney's Port Orleans resort which was also great, we decided to upgrade. The four of us, 2 adults and 2 teenagers, stayed in a studio room mainly due to the cost. The room was surprisingly comfortable, clean and more than sufficient for our needs. The foldout sofabed was very comfy and there were nooks within the room to nest our ever expanding pile of suitcases. The pool area was very High School Musical 2 with movies and lifeguards, and the laundry facilities were great. As mentioned in other reviews, the foodcourt was a little restricted in variety but what they had was delicious. We just wished we had more time to spend within the resort rather than at the parks. We will return one day, would go back in a heartbeat. Stop searching and just go!!!!

<Title>“Too inconvenient-must have a car to stay here”
<Content>This is a beautiful resort, but so huge as to be totally inconvenient. We stayed in a 2-bedroom villa at Saratoga Springs because we received a free stay here when we joined the Disney Vacation Club at a different resort. I would not recommend this property unless you have a car and intend to cook in the unit. Saratoga Springs is just huge. Our unit was probably about half a mile from the main building with the restaurants, shops and main pool. This would have been ok if we had intended to cook our own meals in the unit, butwere intending on cooking in the unit, but since we were on the Disney Dining Plan, we had to drive down for breakfast, soda, or a snack. This was very inconvenient. If we did not have our car with us we would have had to take a Disney Bus (!) to get to the main building. This does not make for a very relaxing vacation in my mind. Another consequence of the hugeness of Saratoga Springs is that the Disney Bus must stop at five bus stops before it even leaves the resort. It takes forever to get to the parks. For these reasons alone, I would not choose to stay here again. Another negative was the concierge staff. Some of them were very inexperienced. When we arrived I tried to get them to print out my tickets to Spirit of Aloha, a dinner show at the Polynesian . Using the meal plan, you reserve the show in advance and the concierge at the resort is supposed to print out the tickets, deducting meal credits from your account. .It seemed the concierge did not want to do this, she talked me out of it, saying it was too far in advance. When I went back the morning of the show, they did not know how to issue the tickets. They deducted the credits from the meal plan, but when we got to the show, they showed it was unpaid and had to deduct more credits. Luckily, the cast member at the Polynesian was able to fix things, but we were late for the show. On the positive side, the main pool with the slide was very fun and had great activities for the kids. There was a nice game room and kids club. The Turf Club, the resort's full service restaurant, was very good. The Artist's Palate, the food court, had good food but a very limited selection. The unit we stayed in was very lovely and clean. However, it had minor plumbing problems. A toilet stopped flushing on day and the air conditioner leaked water onto the carpet of the entry way. These issues were addressed immediately so they did not become problems. Another issue was that the high speed internet did not work. I liked Saratoga Springs, but not enough to overcome my annoyance at how inconvenient it was.

<Title>“Great resort...except for the Front Desk staff”
<Content>I loved everything about the resort except the extreme unhelpfulness of the front desk staff. The three who I encountered really made it seem like I was bothering them by doing simple things...like checking in! Like asking basic questions! It's too bad that they're Disney's first impression of this resort. Otherwise it was really nice, with great rooms (1 BR villa for us), nice pools and beautifully landscaped grounds, not to mention a great golf course onsite with great staff. The resort is huge, however, so it is best enjoyed by people who like to walk. Definitely go, but good luck with the front desk! P.S. The housekeeping staff never emptied our trash. We should have had 1 maid visit during the week (on Vacation Club rate). We just took it out ourselves but it would have been nice if they did it.

<Title>“Not @ all impressed....”
<Content>This was our first trip to disney as a family. I had gone when I was a kid but haven't been back since then & my children (8 & 9) had never gone. The hotel was an ok size, clean, had everything it said it would, housekeeping was wonderful, we didn't use them but they always made sure we had clean towels, soap, dishsoap ect outside our door, the pool was close & the main pool & restaraunt was a little bit of a walk, but not a big deal, i got a pedicure @ the spa & they were wonderful, loved the gym (which is open 24 hrs), food not a big selection but ok & the view from our room was great, we could see pretty much all of downtown disney but...... the service @ the front desk i was not impressed with, they were not @ all helpful. I would call or go down to ask a question & they would either not know the answer or give us the wrong answer. I had asked them if planet hollywood accepted the dining plan, they looked on a list & said no, well come to find out they did, i had spent about $90 when i didn't need to! I had bought beer/wine & cigars from the gift shop with no problem, well one day i went to buy cigars & the woman id'd me, which is great, but wouldn't accept my license because she had never seen that kind of license before, ok well thats fine. So i went to the front desk & explained to them that i had bought these types of things before with no problem, can i speak to someone that could help me, well they told me there is nothing they could do. So i went back to the little store & asked nicely to speak to the manager & he was very, very rude to me. As soon as he came over to me he was very defensive & talked to me like i was stupid. So i just explained what had happened, told him i understand that she could lose her job thats why i wanted to speak to him. Well he continued to be rude. I am 34 yrs old, i had the license the DMV gave me, it's not my fault they had never seen one & most of all they had no reason @ all to be rude because i certainly wasn't. Overall the place is ok, we had a great vacation, the little things don't tend to bother me, but i wouldn't spend my money @ that resort again.

<Title>“Perfection - everything you need in one suite.”
<Content>We have discovered a new standard in accommodation! Obviously, you expect Disney to do things well, but we found this to be exactly what we needed. We stayed in Room 1627 (a 2 bedroom Villa) in the Congress Park section of the hotel. We requested this section in our online booking and were pleased to find that they were able to accommodate it. We chose this section of the resort because it was possible to walk to Downtown Disney from there (although the shuttle bus stops right out the front of each section - which is more convenient). The Villa itself had one bedroom with a King bed and ensuite (with spa) and the other room had two Queen beds and ensuite. Between the two rooms is the lounge area, a fully equipped kitchen & a laundry cupboard (washer and dryer). It truly is a home away from home. If you are thinking of stocking the fridge to make your own meals, head off Disney property to nearby supermarkets/grocery stores - they are much cheaper and have a greater choice. As far as the hotel facilities, the pool area always seemed busy - not my personal interest, but it seemed safe and the waterslide looked like a lot of fun. We didn't check out the spa, but it is centrally located, near the pool. Dining - there is the Quick Service option which is simple but very good and the Turf Club Bar and Grill Restaurant was really lovely. That being said, with so many options across Walt Disney World (Liberty Tree Tavern and Hollywood & Vine can be recommended!) you may not eat at the hotel very often. As always, Disney accommodation is lovely (we'd previously stayed at the Port Orleans Riverside) but Saratoga Springs gives you the option to be more self-sufficient.

<Content>We stayed in a Treehouse Villa at Saratoga Springs at Disney World. The rooms were very nice. Everything was recently remodeled. There was plenty of space even though we had 7 people. Very nice bathroom with whirlpool tub in the master. Nice to be in the woods after a long day at Disney. Nice to have a quite pool nearby. Transportation took a little extra time. Due to being in the treehouse, we had to take 1 extra bus. It took about 30-40 minutes from the treehouse to the Magic Kingdom.

<Title>“AMAZING EVEN FOR DISNEY AND HUGE!”
<Content>This is our Disney Vacation Club home resort. We love it! It is Disney at their best from the pool to the huge rooms to the full service Spa. All the high-end disney hotel activities and what you want is here. The plus to this hotel is the water shuttle/boat to Downtown Disney (located across a lake). Only one negative. THIS PLACE IS HUGE!!! If you are far from the main house/ pool you will be in for a walk. That can be a big minus at Walt Disney World due to the amount of walking you will do. There is bus transportation and 5 smaller pools closer to the rooms. Disney never lets you down... One of the most beautiful resorts at Walt Disney World! You must stay at a disney resort if you are going to Walt Disney World! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!

<Title>“Complex is too big and not a good location”
<Content>We are Disney Vacation Club members and have stayed at many locations. This is on the bottom of our list as far as Disney properties go. Of course, Disney standards are different from everyone else so it's still a very nice resort. Perhaps it's where our building was -- in the Carousal area. It's very far from the lobby and the main pool. It's a bit far from the bus stop and pretty far from the "local" pool. The units are nice and good sized but the complex is too spread out and feels too much like a typical well kept apartment complex. The main pool is OK but not "spectacular" like some of the other places (i.e. Beach Club). It's close to downtown Disney but still a bus ride away. It's still a very nice resort, but on the bottom end of Disney selections. Also, in this day and age, with so many budget hotels offering free internet service, I find it hard to accept charging for internet access.

<Content>We are members of the Disney Vacation Club and have stayed at many different Disney Resorts and have found Saratoga Springs to be our favorite. We just returned from 2 weeks in a Grand Villa the only problem we find is with the housekeeping. The rooms were very dusty and we moved one of the chests and found a empty water bottle,popcorn, and a hairclip. I think they could take a little extra time and make sure the rooms are cleaner for the guests.

<Title>“Great Resort,but There Are Other Similar Resorts with Better Locations”
<Content>Saratoga Springs is definitely a very relaxing and pleasant place to stay. This trip was our 6th to Disney. The room was great. We stayed in a one bed villa. The full kitchen was a nice aspect, because we could make our own meals (usually cheaper) when we didn't want to eat at the parks. Also, we didn't have to pack as heavily (save on air-carrier bag fees) because we had a washer and dryer in the room. While Saratoga Springs is very nice, there are other resorts with villas set up almost exactly like Saratoga Springs, and they have a better location. Disney's Boardwalk villas and Beach Club Villas are nearly the same as Saratoga Springs, but they have SUPERB locaitons. In addition, the pool scene at the Beach Club is better for families with children. If anyone knows they want to stay in a villa but are not sure which resort to choose, I would emphatically urge you to pick the Boardwalk/Beach Club over Saratoga Springs. If villas are not available at those resorts, Saratoga Springs has just as good of rooms - just not as good of a location. Overall, we had a great time at Saratoga Springs, but we missed staying in the Bach Club Villas where we were so close to Epcot, Hollywood Studios, and the Boardwalk. It seemed like we were always waiting on busses at the bus stop.

<Title>“Grandstand section was awesome”
<Content>Do not overlook this great section of SSR to stay at. The pool area was awesome and you are right in the front of the resort near the entrance. It made quick enter and exits. I never took the bus because I prefer to drive. This made a trip to downtown disney in about 2 minutes and the rest of the parks in under 10 minutes. Can't beat that! The pool had a horse track feel to it. 4 Starting gates with water sprays in them along with bubbling fountains and 4 horse head sprayers you can move make up a great small kids splash area. My teenager and I also used it many times. It was too fun to pass up. The pool area was great with a hot tub, large pool with 4 towers that squirted water, laundry, restrooms, lockers and a bar right at the pool. The cement around the pool looks like you are running the horse track! Great horsey compliments to the gates, tiles in the pool etc. The best part is a quick walk behind the building and you are at the main lobby! We even did a quick walk to the boat dock from there. Very convenient if you cannot get into the Springs area ask for this section. Our room was on a beautiful fairway. It was so manicured I wished I had my clubs. I sat and watched golfers all hours of the day. I could also see the river and the boat traffic going by. Place was immaculate. A few things didn't work in the room and maintenance took care of it within minutes of me calling. This is one of two home resorts for me in the DVC. I love my first one the Beach Club but SSR is VERY quiet and relaxing. A great place to vacation.

<Title>“A Grand Family Event at Saratoga Springs”
<Content>We traveled with a total of ten people and stayed at the Grand Stand Section four our family's Thanksgiving holiday. We were in a 2 bedroom villa (2 people were in separate lodging) with extended family using all of the bedding options for the rooms. The room was clean, functional, and very comfortable. We had a full hot breakfast each morning and a large family meal each afternoon in our villa. Our villa was steps from the bus stop which was great because my grandparents who are in their 80's did not have far to walk. The Grand Stand pool was excellent for the two eight year old boys in our party. We also enjoyed time at High Rock Springs and both boys loved the water slid. We are spoiled staying in the villas with the great common/living area and private bed rooms. We're going back to Saratoga Springs this Thanksgiving and staying in the Tree House Villas.

<Title>“Nice villas in Disney World, but too much walking.”
<Content>We started our stay at Disney in these villas, and our villa was nice. The problem with these villas is that they are too spread out, so you are very dependent on the Disney bus transportation. It would be helpful if they had transportation for the complex that didn't go other places. (perhaps a trolley??) We finished our vacation at Wilderness Lodge, which was so much more convenient. I must say that everybody we dealt with was very friendly and helpful, and everything else was wonderful.

<Title>“son's 11th birthday”
<Content>my 17 year old daughter, and now 11 year old son, stayed from July 4 thru July 11, in a one bedroom villa in the Paddock villas and we absolutely loved it!!! This was our first time in the SSR and have stayed at several of the Disney resorts in years past...and Saratoga is by far the nicest. It was more roomier, very clean, loved the kitchen(saved us money on eating out and buying coffee(coffee maker in the room), loved the 2 sinks in the bathroom, spacious shower, and most of all...I LOVED having a washer and dryer in the room. I was able to wash towels instead of waiting on housekeeping to bring me clean ones as well as sheets and blankets!!! We felt very safe, great locking devices in the room, well lit property, bus stop within walking distance. We stayed on the second floor. Resort is close to Downtown Disney, fantastic restaurants, i.e., Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Chilis, McDonalds(beats spending a ton of money at the Disney restaurants), Wal-Mart Supercenter just 6 miles(first day we made trip to Wally World to buy groceries). Even though we were not close to the main pool with the slide, we watched Channel 20 on the t.v. and it gave you instructions on how to use the bus transportation to get from your villa to the pool and back to your villa from the main pool...very easy...catch any bus( it stops at The Springs---where the main pool is) then when you are ready to go back to your villa, catch the Downtown Disney bus(this bus stops at every bus stop in the resort before heading to Downtown Disney). I also brought to the pool my own little personal cooler with my own drinks and small bottles of wine along with a plastic cup(because you are not allowed to bring glass containers into the pool area) and everybody in my family was happy!!! We belong to RCI timeshare, and this year was the first year that RCI and Disney Vacation Club collaberated and when I found out that I could exchange my week from The Beach Club on St. Augustine Beach to one of Disney's Villas....I was ssssooooo excited and happy and immediately made the exchange...we are also annual passholders...normally it would have cost a person roughly $3000.00 for the week that we stayed in SSR, and instead, it only cost me $95 for the exchange(Disney's charge at time of check-in) and $150 for RCI to exchange from homebase to one of Disney's villas. BIG savings!!! Because we visit the theme parks often throughout the year, we decided not to rush this time....we would check the Extra Magic Hours in the evening on Channel 19 and sleep in during the morning hours, lounge around the resort, then go to the park that offers the EMH and avoid the CROWD and heat, and get on the popular rides QUICKLY!!! So, if you are not in any rush, that is the way to play in the parks!!! Also, the king size bed was VERY comfortable, and my 17 year old daughter slept on the pull out sofa sleeper and said that it was VERY COMFORTABLE!!! In the future, I would like to try a different Disney Villa just to see what the other has to offer. GO Disney!!!!! YOU ARE AWESOME!!!! Happy Hawaiian Mom of 2 .... ALOHA!!!!!

<Title>“nice but to spread out”
<Content>We stayed at Saratoga Springs this year from June 28th to July 6th. It was nice but it is big. It has a large pool with a kids slide and a big slide, my husband loved it. it also has two hot tubs and a kiddie splash area. There is a bar by the pool (no food) and there is a quick service that serves B. L. and D. It is pretty good they have a dinner special every night and they have a restaurant, Turf Club. It was wonderful. They also have movies every night at 8:30 (unless it rains) by the pool and bingo at 2:30 and pool games at 4. Since the hotel is so big and spread out if you want to be close to the pool/food ask to stay in the springs. we were there and it was a short walk. if you can't get the springs ask for congress park. if you can't get these there is a little pool for each section and you can get a bus to bring you the springs, which is across the street from the pool/food. But keep in mind the springs is the last stop for buses except downtown Disney, which is the first, so you can wait a while for the bus and they can be crowed. you can also walk to downtown Disney or take a boat. All in all the hotel was nice I don't know if I would stay there again. my fav is the beach club, our home base hotel.

<Title>“Saratoga Springs - It's just like Coronado Springs”
<Content>We recently stayed at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort on DVC developer points. We booked an 8 night stay in a Studio room. Prior to arriving at SSR, I checked in online, which, for the most part, was quite easy. One comment about online check in is that there is no real place to make requests. The only requests that I could make for my room would be either A) close to transportation or B) ground floor. I chose ground floor, but decided to make further requests in person when I physically checked in. The process couldn't have been easier! I will always use this in the future! I requested that we stay in the Congress Park section and that we have a view of the Downtown Disney area. We kind of got both requests granted. We did get a room in the Congress Park section and we had a somewhat obstructed view of the Downtown Disney area. Our view was more of the archway leading into the quiet pool and then beyond that was Downtown Disney, but mostly our view was of trees. Choice of locations in Saratoga Springs is CRITICAL! This resort is huge and spread out - much like Coronado Springs, except I believe this resort is actually larger. Some sections of SSR can be a haul from the main pool and main building that houses the Quick Service location, Artist Palette along with the store. I looked at a map and thought that Congress Park would be ideal because it was the section next to the main building, but yet it still had a quiet pool and a walkway to Downtown Disney. In the winter or during cooler, less humid months, this section would be ideal. However, during our stay, Orlando was breaking records with heat indexes. There was no way we even attempted to walk from our section to the main pool or to Artist Palette. We also never used the walkway to Downtown Disney. In fact, the entire time we were there, I never saw anybody use that walkway. We wound up driving every time we needed to refill drink mugs (think Nescrapfe in the morning) or to use the main pool. In this regard, having the quiet pool just steps away from our room was fantastic. The main pool was usually busier and noisier, so the quiet pool was used with greater regularity. The buildings and our room were very clean. I also noticed that Artist Palette, even though it would get quite hectic and crazy, stayed VERY clean. That was a huge plus that we sadly couldn't say about the Mara at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Also, the food at AP was quite good. I liked the food offered here better than the food at any of the Deluxe resort Quick Service locations we've been to thus far. I didn't try breakfast there, but the lunch and dinner was good. Again, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here if I wasn't staying on property, but if you happen to be at the resort, it's great in a pinch. The main pool is pretty standard for a Deluxe resort. There are a few waterfalls, but nothing fancy. It is a free form pool with the requisite water slide. The slide is similar to what you would find at Animal Kingdom Jambo House or Wilderness Lodge. Nothing fancy, but the kids seem to love it. The one day we used the main pool, it was so warm it literally felt like a hot tub. I know the sun and recent high temperatures probably heated all the pools, but this was noticeably hot. We never swam in that pool again. In fact, we left it and went almost immediately to the quiet pool in Congress Park and it actually felt refreshing and like a pool should. It was comfortable - not hot! The bus situation was less than desirable. The busses make about five internal stops before they leave the resort to -- the Treehouse Villas. Seriously! It took forever to get on the road towards the theme park, so we just drove ourselves after that. Be advised that you will need to factor about 40 - 60 minutes for travel time if you plan to use the bus. Driving our own car allowed us to leave at about 7:30am-7:40am to make it to any given Extra Magic Hour park at 8:00am. That seemed pretty good as opposed to having to wait at the bus stop at 7:00am! I couldn't help but draw comparisons between SSR and Coronado Springs. Both seem to be sprawling and large. Some rooms could be a hike away from the pool or main building. There are many internal bus stops if you use the Disney Bus system. Also, there are no internal corridors. One of the things I love about the Deluxe resorts are internal corridors. These are great for those frequent afternoon lightning and rain storms. It's no fun to have to run outside in the rain to a main building just to get something to eat, wash clothes or go to the game room. I personally do not care for the "condo-style" of this deluxe resort. I will say that there were some definite benefits to staying at a DVC room. I liked the increased room size and some of the features of the studio room were great. I loved the larger refrigerator, the microwave, the toaster and coffee maker. However, I absolutely HATED the fold away bed. This room, like almost all Studio rooms, had a queen bed and a queen sleeper. The sleeper bed, which I was lucky enough to sleep on, was terrible. The mattress was about as thick as a Ritz cracker and there was a metal bar that ran down the center of it when it was unfolded. The bar made it impossible to sleep in the middle because you would roll to one side or the other - also, metal bars aren't notorious for comfort anyhow. Suffice it to say that it was actually more comfortable to sleep on the bed in it's couch form, even though my legs hung over the arms. Even though we are only a family of three, a one bedroom or two bedroom is the only way to go with a DVC resort. So the Studio room had some definite benefits over a regular room, but it also had some drawbacks - namely the sleeper bed. All in all, I would recommend this resort to somebody who likes the moderate level resorts. I would not pay or use DVC points to stay here. I hate the condo style resort. I also don't like the sprawling layout of most moderate resorts. I prefer the enclosed internal hallways and the layout of the traditional deluxe resort. One thing I forgot to mention, when it rained, the hallways in our buildings became like little lakes. There were huge puddles of water even though we were on the second floor. For whatever reason, there were always towels thrown down in the hallways and "Wet Floor" signs everywhere. You literally couldn't go down a hallway without having to move a "Wet Floor" sign out of the way. Seriously!

<Title>“A good experience”
<Content>We stayed for 7 nights in Mid-June. We had a one bedroom in the Springs Building, which is very convenient to one of theme park shuttle pick up and drop areas. Also, this building is next to the main building which houses the front desk, concierge and Artist Palette, which is the "quick service" restaurant and store. Our suite was in very good shape. I believe I read on TA that this was one of the original buildings, but we found everything to work well and be reasonably new-ish. The first morning, when I went to make coffee, the carafe lip was broken off and not realizing it, I cut my finger when washing it out for first use. We called housekeeping and they quickly brought up a new carafe for our use. Other than that we had no issues with anything in the unit. We have younger children (7 and 10) and they slept in the queen sofa sleeper, which although doesn't use a traditional mattress, was very comfortable. The one bedroom unit is set up so that people can enter the bathroom two ways and so that the one bedroom can be locked for privacy. The large tub is in the master bathroom area, which is nice as my one child took a bath and the other one showered at the same time, in separate rooms. The main pool was fine, not too big, but not tiny. My kids loved the waterslide. All the parks are within 10 minutes drive. We used the bus for Magic Kingdom only and found it very convenient to use our rental car to drive to the rest. The parking is free at all theme parks if you are staying at a Disney resort. Our room was tidied every day and fresh towels were given everyday as well. I read there was a fee for this, but I didn't pay it at check out, nor did I order it in advance. Not sure what hapened there, but didn't complain. My suggestion is to shop on the way to the resort, bringing things like coffee filters and your own coffee, although they do have some you can use (pre-filled coffee in a filter), and other snacks and food items from a real store, if you plan an extended stay. All in all no complaints and we thoroughly enjoyed having the washer and dryer and apartment like accommodation!

<Title>“Great place to stay "Loved It"”
<Content>We were there June 21 to 27, there was 5 adults 3 teens 1-2 year old, we had a 3 bed room villa was great more room then we needed, I am not sure what all the bad reviews were about there was always something to do from ridding a bike to playing basketball to seeing a movie by the pool, we could even get DVDS or game to play back in our room. The room we had was great I didn't see anything wrong with it we had all the kitchen items that we needed to cook with, the only thing is I forgot to bring maple syrup for pancakes and at the little store for a 12oz it was 4.49. So they get you if you forget something. The longest we had to wait for a bus was about 15 min tops. We all had a great time so again I don't know what all the bad reviews were about this is a great place to stay. We will be going back in Nov and staying at the Animal Kingdom Lodge so they will have a lot to live up to.

<Title>“Great rooms, poor bus service, poor maintenance response”
<Content>We traveled with 2 boys age 3 and 6, 2 grandparents and my husband and myself. Pros - **I loved the suites with the kitchen, stove, full size fridge and microwave. This was very convenient to eat breakfast before we went to the park and late night dinner/snacks. The suite gives you a central den and then each private bedroom. **there is also a washer/dryer combo which means you can pack less - however they are old and stains dont come out just the smell. ** the pool and pool bar is great - and the kids loved the walk in pool, the shallowness everywhere and the large slide and baby slide - we stayed close to the main pool which i recommend Cons ** The hair dryer was broken (the entire outlet) in one bathroom and we called several times to report it and they never came and fixed. ** the bathrooms need a good cleaning as there was a lot of mildew on the tile floors. ** the bus service to the parks was not predicitable and we ended up driving to the parks. my parents had driven to DW and having a car really helped. we worried that getting to dinner reservations etc. would be a problem without a car OVERALL if you have a large group and want a kitchen and have a car there this is a great place to stay. If you want convienence stay on a monorail or boat access property.

<Title>“Nice resort”
<Content>Stayed one week at the Saratoga Springs Resort with my wife and 5 year old. We had a studio, which includes a queen size bed and a sleeper sofa. I slept on the sleeper sofa most nights and found it to be quite comfortable. The kitchenette includes a refrigerator, microwave, toaster, coffee machine, and sink. We liked the room but there was some dust and the carpets were somewhat worn. I sat out on the porch a lot, which directly overlooked a courtyard area with benches and also one of the large waterspouts. Our room was in the Springs section, which is closest to the main pool and main building. Food at the casual Artist's Point was OK. Food at the Turf Club was excellent. There is a boat dock right behind the Turf Club, where you can catch a boat to Downtown Disney. Bus service was pretty good although, as anywhere at Disney, the buses can get crowded on occassion. Springs is the last stop. Sometimes we walked to the Paddock bus stop, which is second. The Paddock stop also is near a pool and play area, plus is has bathrooms. We enjoyed the pool and the water slides are quite fun. There is an arcade off of the pool area. One of the best perks was that there are free washers and dryers to use. There are two nice looking har-tru tennis courts, although I did not get to use them. They are near a shuffle board court and a basketball court. They play family movies each evening at 8:30 at the main pool. Found staff to be excellent in all respects. The resort is huge. If you are staying in an area away from the main building/pool you can hop on any bus and get off at the Springs stop.

<Title>“Looove it, can't wait to go back!”
<Content>I really don't know what is with the bad reviews. My husband and I love Saratoga. My kids loved it as well. We have been here twice and we already have our reservations for August '09. I would recommend this resort to anyone. The artist pallet is great, I would go there early (for breakfast) , because it does get busy, especially if you are planing on eating there. We brought our food back most times, but if my husband wanted to sleep in I would just bring the kids and eat there. Great environment. Loved taking the ferry to downtown Disney @ night...the lights are amazing, you can even see the fire works if you time it right. I loved the pool and the games they played. All around great fun. You have to go to the Turf club and get the Lamb Chops.

<Title>“When The Magic has left Disney--What a Nightmare!”
<Content>Three weeks ago my family went to Saratoga Springs for vacation. We travelled with two small children a 2 year old and a 4 year old. We took advantage of the Disney Magical Express as a means of transporting us from the airport to the resort. We had 5 carry on bags that the driver of the bus took from us and put under the bottom of the bus. When we got to the hotel, I was strapping my youngest son in the stroller while my Mom was tending to my 4 year olds and maneuvering the bags. The driver dropped our bags and took off. By the time I turned around and noticed that two of my bags were not there the driver had already took off. I immediately notified the bellhop and the front desk when I checked it. I provided a description of the driver and our bags. This was 11 p.m. at night. I was given a claims number and told that at the end of the night the driver would return any bags left on the bus to lost and found. I was given a claims number to follow-up. When we reached the room I called and they had no updates. I then called again at 1 a.m. and still no updates. I was then told that I had to wait until the bags show up. One bag contained all our toiletries, diapers prescription medicines etc. The other bag contained our camcorder, digital camera my sons Nintendo DS etc. so I was very concerned that not much seem to happening in recovering my bags quickly. The next day I called numerous times and was given the same answer--no updates. I kept insisting that they need to find the driver and I was told that there is no tracking system to determine which bus they put me on and since I don't know the driver's name it would be difficult for them to figure out. At this point I went to the Saratoga Springs Concierge to speak to a manager to see if they could help me. During my discussions, I was informed that Disney Express is not a "Disney" Company and that I would have to work with Meers Transportation who owns and operates the Disney Express. Keep in mind that these were the same individuals who were not very helpful to begin with. I was told that they would search all the Disney properties to see if the bags show up as a first attack in handling the problem. I kept insisting why they are not looking for the driver of the bus and I repeatedly provided a description of the driver, detail information about the time we got on the bus and the stops the driver made and still no update on the driver. What should have been an exciting vacation and especially for my 4 year old because it was his first trip to Disney, turned into time spent talking on the phone repeatedly, following up with Meers and the Saratoga staff about my lost luggage with no new information on a daily basis. I arrived on a Saturday and it was not until Tuesday did I receive a phone call from someone at Meers transportation about my bag. I was called because my issue was turned over to Meers Claims Department. The gentleman I spoke with expressed surprised that the driver was not located and I again reiterated the same information that I told numerous times before. I provided him with a list of the items I had in the bag and he questioned me as to why I allowed the driver to put my bag under the bottom of the bus if I had so much valuables in there and why I didn't take it with me on the bus if I could take it as a carryon on the plane. I explained that the driver told me to put the bags under the bus so I did. The value of the stuff in both my bags was about $3,500. I did not hear from the claims department on Wednesday as I was told so Thursday afternoon I called and left a message that I was concerned since I was leaving the next day and no one called me back. I received a call back informing me that this is shared liability since I left my bag on the bus. I was also informed that the driver was located and he told them that all the bags that got on the bus got off the bus. I was also told that the driver is a veteran of the company and for all they know those bags did not get on the bus in the first place. I was horrified to be spoken to in such a manner. The claims agent went on to tell me that what they can do is provide me with $250 per bag for a total of $500 and that that amount should be enough for me to cover the deductible on my home owner's insurance. I informed him that that was unacceptable for the value of the things that I had in the bag and I was told and I quote, "I don't know what to tell you, you might want to get a lawyer." I was stunned for the utter disregard for my personal property. I have already loss because the pictures of my children and my family on our camera will never be replaced but to be spoken to in such a manner was appalling. I asked to speak to a supervisor and I was told that a supervisor was not available. I reported the incident to the manager on duty at the time at Saratoga Springs and I was told they would follow-up because they received a voicemail for the claims agent. Interestingly, on my return ride to the airport, I refused to put my bag under the bus and had a confrontation with the driver who informed me that I am required to put my bag under the bus because if the bags shift and hit a passenger they are liable and he could loose his job...Oh the irony because I was berated for putting my valuables under the bus by the claims agent on the one hand and told by the driver on the other hand that it is a requirement. Today is exactly two weeks since I left the Saratoga Springs hotel and I have not heard anything from anyone at Meers Transportation. Since I had recently bought into Disney vacation club, I contacted them to see if and what they can do to assist me in helping to resolve the situation. I am still waiting and I am no closer to finding out what is happening to provide compensation for my property. Needless to say, this was not an ideal vacation because of this situation. While the Saratoga Springs property is nice, I believe the staff did not handle the situation properly in helping me resolve things. I was at the mercy of whoever was the manager on duty at the time that I go to the front desk to inquire. The staff did do two things for me, we received a $50 credit on our account to help purchase necessities such as toothbrush etc in the gift shop/grocery store onsite and I was given a ride to Wal-Mart to buy some replacement for things that were lost that we needed on the trip. Disney "sells" the magic of what they have to offer. However, in the event that things go wrong an individual is at their own mercy. Especially in tough economic times such as these, families are making sacrifices to continue to take vacations when we do so, we expect certain standards to be met and unfortunately the Saratoga Springs (Disney) did not live up to those standards. My recommendation is to find your own means of transportation from the hotel and should you decide to stay on a Disney property be mindful that if things go wrong you could be on your own.

<Title>“Disney has gone down hill.”
<Content>We stayed in a Studio and I think the maid thought that we were timeshare holders instead of registered guests. There are no longer any glasses to rinse you mouth after you brush your teeth at the sink. I called for the pull out sofa to be made up for bedtime, after two hours I put the mattress cover, sheets and blankets on myself. I complained and got three different answers. Also they had the housekeeper supervisor call me when I came back to my room and found the bed made with a big pillow in the bottom of it. I called the front desk and they kept me on hold forever and would not pick up until the housekeeper supervisor called them to tell them the problem. I stayed there for three nights and the room was not vacuumed during my entire stay. I have stayed in numerous Disney properties and never had a problem before. Since Feb 08 most of the breakfast restaurants with wait service have been closed, ie Saratoga Springs, Port Orleans, Riverside, the only one open in the non deluxe or theme park area was at Old Key West. The Executive in charge of Housekeeping did send my granddaughter a Cinderella plush toy.

<Title>“Peaceful retreat with lovely walks...”
<Content>Saratoga Springs was an amazing place as far as my family and I are concerned. There was is all the usual stuff you can expect from a Disney Vacation Club resort with interesting bits thrown in. We stayed in the Springs which is near to the carriage house and check inare and the themed pool. But the walks we had around the outskirts of the resort are what made it for us. Lush greenery with lovely views of the golf courses and the new treehouses and waterways were lovely. I particularly enjoyed the choise of either walking,travelling by bus or boat to Downtown Disney and the food in the Turf Club was particularly nice. Overall the rroms were exactly as described the facilities were great, staff were cool and the transport and scenery well worth a revisit some time in the future.

<Title>“Saratoga is a wonderful Disney retreat!”
<Content>I too was a bit nervous about our stay at Saratoga after reading some of the reviews. However, as they say at WDW our stay was "Magical". I am to assume that those who wrote negative reviews are never happy with anything. The resort is beautiful. Our 2 bedroom villa that we shared with my sister's family was spacious and full of home comforts such as a 2 full bathrooms, one with a jacuzzi tub, washer/dryer, and a full kitchen which was more than adequate for our needs and a DVD player. I would stay at this resort again in a heartbeat!

<Title>“Great trip with some concerns”
<Content>This resort was exactly what we were looking for. I have four children ages 11, 10, 7, and 5. They absolutly loved the pool and the room was great. Unfortunatly, while we were at the pool one day, my 10 year old daughter sliced open the bottom of her foot on a sharp tile at the bottom of the pool. Of course I don't blame the resort, accidents happen, especially with children. What happened next is what bothered me. I ran to the bar that was right next to the pool and explained to the bartender what had happened, asking for something to sop up the blood. He directed me to the ladies batheroom, where he informed me I could get some paper towels. (He had napkins and towels right in front of him) After cleaning her up, my husband took her to the front desk to see if they had any bandages and to see if they wanted to write up an incident report. The only thing they offered him was a band aid which was way too small. No one asked what happened, no one asked if she was okay, no one even seemed concerned. I was very surprised. I know how attentive Disney usually is with their customers and this was not what I expected.

<Title>“Impeccable Accommodations”
<Content>We just returned from a 4 day/3 night stay at Saratoga Springs which was incredibly wonderful, the room was clean, stocked with kitchen supplies, plenty of towels in the room, pillows, soap, even laundry detergent! The pool area also had plenty of clean, fresh towels for us to use after our swim, the kids watched an evening movie by the pool, enjoyed the slide, and had a fantastic time. When I made my reservations directly through Disney, I made a special request for a room in Congress Park (nearest to Downtown Disney), not only did they grant my request, but our room had a beautiful view of Downtown Disney, the lake, everything was absolutely magical. I cannot say anything negative about this resort. I don't understand the bad reviews. The resort is huge, plenty of healthy cardio walking to do welcomed by all means. It was GREAT!!! But... if you are not an active person, perhaps checking into a hospital or rehab during your stay at Walt Disney World is more suitable. With that said, this is a great place to be, worth every cent! We will definitely return.

<Title>“An awesome Memorial Day weekend!”
<Content>Don't know what all the negative reviews are all about? Just went for memorial Day weekend and we had a fabulous time. Got upgraded for free to a 1 bedroom. The condo is huge and has everything you can think of. Beds were comfy, room was nice and cold, the jaccuzzi was perfect after a long day and the view from our terrace was amazing. We cannot wait to go back!

<Title>“Excellent family holiday”
<Content>Before going to Saratoga I was slightly concerned over some of the reviews I had read on here & to be honest was apprehensive. As a DVC member our home resort is Old Key West but due to a booking error, we ended up coming here (didn't bother to change it when got confirmation!). HOWEVER...most of the negative reviews I feel were unfair & we had a fab time with no complaints (well maybe an iggle or two!) Saratoga itself is one of the newest vacation club resorts & so is very shiny, much more polished the OKW. It is also HUGE so can understand previous comments about buses. We were in The Grandstand which is the first pick up & drop off which was great but it took almost 20minutes to get out of the resort after you've picked everyone else up. POSITIVES Clean & tidy rooms of a good size, very quiet pool nearby, great balcony view of the golf course (v jealous hubby for two weeks!) lovely staff in general, walking distance to Downtown Disney, very quiet in our area The Grandstand, NEGATIVES trash not emptied enough (we have a 6 month old baby so nappies in bins for several days!), it didn't happen to us but I could see potential for a long bus wait, room not suitable for older family in my opinion as has a double & a sofa bed (OKW has two double beds) however good for us to have sofa instead of bed! Overall we had a fab time & would definately go back to Saratoga again...really wnated to put a positive review cos I feel Saratoga has had a bit of a bad rep on here so....there you go!

<Title>“OK Stay at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort”
<Content>Booked SSR thru Interval for May 3 thru May 10, 2009 for a 2 BR unit for 5 adults, 2 kids, and 1 infant....and good thing I didn't book it directly as it would not have been worth the cost of $650/nite. In the past 2 visits to WDW, we have stayed at Old Key West Resort in a 1 B/R Unit, and this unit by itslef is equivalent to the 2 BR unit at SSR. Check in was a breeze, and at first, we were assigned to the Paddock section, but I requested for a dedicated 2 BR unit in either Congress Park (so we could get a Downtown Disney view as well as be close to a pool) or the Grandstand Section (which is the newest section). The Disney rep was very accomodating and got us into room 1611 at Congress Park...which we thought was great, but once we were allowed in the rooms at 4pm....limited view as the unit was on the 2nd floor and trees blocked your views of the pool, and could not see DD at all. We were all too tired to change, so kept the location. The positive was that it was a 15 minute walk to DD and 10 mins to the main pool if you wanted (or you can catch any bus that would come by and get dropped off at the Springs Section and just walk back). Again, the 2BR unit fit all of us ok...my wife and I and our infant took the master BR, and my brother, his wife, and 2 kids took the 2 queen beds, and my mother slept on the pull out sofa couch...which she did say was not that bad for being a pull out sleeper. Kitchen was small but had all we needed, plates, pots, pans, etc...but the biggest issue was the refrigerator....it DOES NOT have an ICE MAKER. It was HOT while we were there, mid 90's, and the only ICE MACHINE was located on the first floor, which we would fill up a small garbage bag with ice and keep it in the fridge. (when we stayed at OKW the past 2 times, we loved the fact of the ice maker!) The have a very small dining room table in the living area...which would fit 4-5 ok, but not all 8, if you were eating in the room. But the kids liked eating out on the patio and the adults ate at the table...so worked out. Rooms were fine and the beds were comfortable. Positive for Disney to provide a pack-n-play for our infant, which worked out great. The washer and dryer is a stackable...but kind of loud, so if you did laundry at nite, you can hear it in the Master BR and living areas. In regards to the bussing system, we had a rental car for the week, but mainly used the bus systems to get around the parks, which was great....I think the most we waited was 10 mins for one bus. If you are shopping for groceries, there are local stores, but I would recommend the Super Walmart, which is only about a 10 minute drive. There is a Goodings and Winn Dixie grocery stores that are alot closer, but their prices were 10-20% more...so be careful. Overall experience was OK at SSR, but we liked the layout and size of the OKW better. I think our next visit, we will try Animal Kingdom Villas or Bay Lake Resort.

<Title>“Not the best Vacation Club property!”
<Content>As a member of Disney’s Vacation Club for 15 years, I have seen both good and bad Disney properties. Unfortunately, Saratoga Springs is in the latter category, especially considering the fact that this is not a ‘value’ resort. During our recent 8 day stay here, we experienced the following problems and concerns: 1) The guards at the front gate were sometimes very abrupt and were rarely welcoming. First, there seems to be a disconnect between the front desk and the guard shack such that the guards do not know if someone is arriving if they checked in online. This seems like it could be easily remedied; but unfortunately, it resulted in a bad first impression when the guard gave us a “3rd degree” because we weren’t on his list. Other experiences were hit or miss, but only once in the 8 days did a guard act personable and friendly towards us. 2)This was by far the noisiest resort that we’ve stayed at – this is the first time that we’ve been able to clearly hear conversations of our neighbors, particularly annoying since our neighbors were night owls – often up until 2 am. 3)The mattress was- lumpy and uncomfortable, with distinctive sag. 4)The room was not in typical Disney condition. Tile grout in and around the shower was dirty, and the shower curtain did not fit the entire shower door, causing ponding water (and I suppose, the dirty grout, over time). Also, carpeting was worn in some areas to the point that the tack strips underneath were poking through. 5)Housekeeping here did not live up to Disney standards. When we arrived, there were dishes in the dishwasher, there was no laundry soap, and following the ‘trash and tidy’ service, the housekeeper left the rear door wide open – a security threat as we were on the first floor. 6)Dining at the resorts quick meal eatery, Artists Pallet, was a strange experience. They use video monitor menus to represent what’s available, but the monitors didn’t match what they were offering in the display cases. Also, they’ve developed this convoluted system whereby you place your order at the counter (with the food pre-made and ready to go), but rather than handing the food to you, you get a pager, and wait, and wait, while the staff take the food out of the case and put it on a tray. The more formal dining area is too small and books up, so unfortunately, this may be the only game in town. It was not all bad news, as the bus service at this resort works much more reliably than at other Vacation Club Resorts that we’ve stayed at. Also, they have an excellent pool area with a water slide and night time pool side movies. However, for the cost of staying at this resort, the few bright spots do not outweigh all of the negative aspects that we encountered. We did bring our concerns to the attention of the Front Desk staff, and they promised that they would speak to the involved department supervisors. Hopefully, by the time of your stay, these issues will be remedied.

<Title>“Saratoga Springs Resort is an excellent place to come home to every night while at WDW!”
<Content>I have seen many reviews of this resort... both good and bad. I was a bit apprehensive about booking here, especially since this was the first time we were staying on Disney property. We booked our vacation and decided to stay in a one bedroom villa that included a king size bed with a double pull out sofa bed in the living room. Many reviewers complained about how uncomfortable the sofabed was. Has anyone actually ever comfortably slept on a sofabed??? >>> I think not! A sofabed is typically a temporary bed and should not be looked upon as being comfortable now matter where you go. Anyway, we checked into our room in the Congress Park complex with a room that overlooked Downtown Disney... all I can say is that the view is priceless! The quiet pool is looked in the middle of the four cluster of Congress Park buildings. The quiet pool means that since most families go to the big themed pool, the smaller pools are often more quiet with less kids and typically left to the adults. The pools are open 24 hours, but these hours are not advertised anywhere. The water is maintained at 83 degrees celcius which was delightful. A Disney Transportation bus stop is looked right outside of the the cluster of Congress Park buildings. Parking is excellent, whereas you can park very close to the building and do not have to worry about valet service for parking or a bellhop for luggage. The villas or rooms are like little apartments. When we checked in we did find a few housekeeping issues that needed to be taken care of. Immediately two executive housekeeping team leaders came over to see what was wrong. They not only got on top of the problems but left us "Disney magic" to make up for the inconvenience - animals made out of towels around the room, fast passes for rides, and other cool things. The villa was in excellent shape- the walls and paint in excellent condition, the curtains and bedding seemed new as well. The team leader was not happy with the look our of sofa and dinner table so she ordered us new ones which were delivered the next day. The carpet was a bit worn and the team leader told us that she is working on getting new carpets put into the Congress Hall rooms. She said that part of the problem is that Congress Hall is so popular that the rooms are being constantly rented and there is a lot of wear and tear, especially on the carpet. The kitchen was stocked better than my own house! Everything from pots, pans, dishes, cutting boards, tupperwear, wine glasses, toaster, coffee maker... you name it and it is there. Many people complained about the coffee and coffee maker. We asked housekeeping for extra coffee and they always left it. The coffee pack is coffee inside of an enclosed filter. The coffee was actually good. We did however find out that Disney Vacation Resort guest must pay for the coffee while hotel guests do not and can get as much as they want. The rooms, especially the bathroom, are huge! The jacuzzi tub in the bathroom is also huge and quite relaxing. Having a washer and dryer in the room was awesome and housekeeping would leave at least one box of Tide everyday to do laundry. The resort is big, but not unmanageable. It was nice to walk around the beautiful landscaped grounds. Being on the first floor, often ducks and rabbits would come up to our patio door looking for little snacks. The property has a guarded entrances run by Disney employees (not rent-a-cops) like all of the other Disney resorts. While we had our own car, Disney buses seemed to be always coming and going. The resort offers "golf cart" type transportation around the resort for those who have trouble walking. One of the best aspects of the resort being big was that everyone is spread out making it a great place for adults, honeymooners, couples. Even though kids are around, the size of the resort makes them seem less obvious as some of the other Disney resorts. The resort offers bike riding, horseback riding, as well as activities such as movie nights in the pool, bingo, arts and crafts, and story times. My only two complaints are that the resort convenience store and "gift shop" is very small in size compared to other resorts and is not open 24/7 like the other resorts. The store closes at 11pm which is inconvenient when you are coming in late from a park and want to refill your drink mug. Also, this resort does not offer room service which I did miss. They do offer pizza delivery but that is it! I hope in the future they fix these few problems. The staff was very friendly and courteous. The housekeepers did sometimes seem to "rush" or skip over the cleaning but all we had to do was alert housekeeping and the problems were taken care of asap! What I do not understand is the people who left reviews on here about the resort and the rooms being in disrepair, dirty, etc. If you want the problem fixed you must notify the staff immediately. Waiting until you come home or just complaining on here will not fix the situation. We had all of our problems fixed immediately after the staff was notified, and they gave us special little presents to make up for the mistakes or problem. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone... families, couples, honeymooners! Yes it is not the closest to the parks, but that is also part of the charm. You sort of remove yourself from the hype and rush of the park and return to a resort where you can relax and unwind! The other resorts around WDW might be closer to the parks or themed heavier, however, how much of the Disney theming can a person take? Coming home at night to the villa was like coming home to your own house... not a hotel room and not Mickey's, Donald's, or Goofy's house. The villas are very grown and tastefully decorated. Having a car made the trips to the parks effortless and since we were hotel guests we never paid for parking at the parks and were often allowed to park at other resort hotels parking lots without hassle. Overall- 1. Great Location- near Downtown Disney and away from the parks 2. Big, tastefully decorated villas and rooms. 3. Awesome to have a washer and dryer in the room. 4. Being able to swim at 3am after a long day in a park- PRICELESS! 5. Looking out the window to glow of the lights of Downtown Disney- also Priceless! 6. Big, wondeful jacuzzi tub in the bathroom! 7. Huge bathroom with one section have a sink and jacuzzi tub, another room having an oversized glass shower with another sink, and a third small room or water closet (toilet). 8. When you have a problem... notify the staff immediately so that the problem may be fixed or so that you may be compensated for the issue. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL YOU GET HOME TO COMPLAIN OR WORSE YET- COMPLAIN ONLINE (when the problem could have been fixed). This was my first time staying on Disney property and I will definitely come back to this resort again... indeed it did feel like home! "Welcome Home!"

<Title>“Visited twice in April, disappointed both times....”
<Content>This review is for two different visits in April 2009. These two visits were our first and second experiences and in both cases a disappointment. We are Orlando locals and annual passholders at Disney World. From time to time we come for fun, have come with family and prior to moving to Orlando, visited the different resorts over the years. We have been Disney World regulars for 34 years and the larger the resort grows, the deterioration of not only the parks, the resorts, the customer service but the overall experience. We came the first time April 14 to 17 and had an 11 yr old young lady visiting over her spring break. We decided to give the Saratoga Springs a try. We had the two bedroom villa. The villas are a "step down" in quality from their original DVC villa resort, Old Key West. Old Key West is old, but the overall space is better, furniture better, but does lack some of the bells and whistles of the Saratoga. The living room furniture at Saratoga is very cheap, very uncomfortable, and for such a new resort, very damaged. Our sitting chair had a two inch slit with stuffing coming out, stained, and the housekeeping staff is terrible. Very surface cleaned. The dust was so thick on both the tv cabinets, we could write our name in the dust. The bench kitchen table and chairs was horrible. The seat cushion was held in place with velcro and when it came loose, the dust and amount of old food was gross. Had issues with the dryer while there, the kitchen floor was sticky and needed a good mopping and we discovered dirty dishes, sliverware and some cooking items that were greasy and dried food in plates and dried egg on the spatula. The outdoor patio area was very dirty with bird dropping all over the place, including the chairs. The cob webs were thick and a good broom dusting would have cured that issue. Their internet service is very SLOW.... and if you have work to do... good luck... The second visit was again for three nights, April 21 to 24. We thought we would give it another go, just in case it was a fluke. But, Saratoga Springs again proved to be a disappointment. This visit we stayed in a one bedroom because the young lady was not with us. We had the exact same experiences. Sticky kitchen floor, dirty uncomfortable furniture, unclean dishes/pots/pans, dirty outside patio, cob webs, bird mess, and again dust so thick we could write our names in it. They never seem to actually move the lamps on the end tables, just dust in front and the back of the table is thick in dust. The furniture is very stained with water marks, scratches and again cheap uncomfortable furniture. It is obvious they need some retraining of their staff on cleaning. On our first visit, we noticed there was a scatter of literature and when we called down to the front desk they had housekeeping bring up the information. When the lady showed up, she was so RUDE to us. She had a wrting tablet and when I opened the door, she never said hello, ot look up from her pad, just held out the packet. I said to her, is this everything and she grunted. After that, I kind of threw it back at her and shut the door. I was not going to allow this rude person to treat a paying guest this way. I did not ask for anything that should have already been in the room. We are not Disney Vacation Club owners, but while down at the main pool and again at our local quiet pool, we engaged with couples and both times they were DVC members. In both encounters, they expressed their disappointment in Saratoga Springs, how use to be was nice, but that Disney was not keeping it up and they shared some of the same complaints that we were experiencing. It made me glad that we were not members of the Disney Vacation Club. As annual passholders, we are offered discounts at some of resorts during the off seasons and this is a great way to experience some of the resorts. But, I will say that even with the discount, the price of the villa was not worth the rate. I would hate to be a guest paying their premium rates or DVC member and paying their rates and have such a dirty place to "come home to". Not my kind of "Welcome Home". Last fall, we stayed at the Fort Wilderness Cabins with our son and his family for five nights. We booked two cabins. Our cabin was ok, but we had issues with the sewer system. Everytime we flushed the toilet, we could smell sewage smell and it lingered in the confined bathroom. Their staff never did fix the issue and this was horrible. We also experienced issues with their internet service as well. Inconsistent, very slow. You would think that Disney could do a better job with the internet considering they charge you ten dollars per 24 hour period. They also cheat you and cut you off your internet access after about 22 hours. We had this happen again and again. We will not be going back to Saratoga Springs or the Cabins at Fort Wilderness ever again. Old Key West may be older, but sometimes newer is not always better. For the price of Saratoga and Fort Wilderness, not worth your money. There is a lot better off site at a better rate and other options on the Disney property.

<Title>“Clean, soul-less, apartment-like complex”
<Content>I am a huge fan of Disney...they do great parks, cartoons and entertainment. However, they are not great at hotels if Saratoga Springs is the standard. If you like staying at places like Homewood Suites, Hyatt Place, Hampton Suites or Doubletree...stay there. Saratoga is a Disney-imitation of these types of properties...but more expensive. You stay for the 'convenience' of being near Disney attractions (namely, Entertainment Island and the main-street of overpriced shops/restaurants). The landscape is beautifully maintained and it looks like a suburban apartment complex. The 'theme' is loosely based on the horseracing motif...but, only loosely. Arrival is when you see the signs 'welcome home' (my home is certainly not like this one...) and you have to have your name on a check-in list to get past the rent-a-security guard. You drive up and are met with cheery international badged staff who then direct you to check in where even more friendly international badged staff give you 20 folders and an 'all purpose' Disney key card which 'unlocks' all of the Disney magic. Or rather, the ability to charge whatever Magic you purchase back to your main hotel bill! After check in...you have to either take a bus, a golf cart or walk (in April, humidity and heat is inching upwards at mid day...so, no one walks unless they are in bathing suits!) to your 'complex'. There are several small pools scattered around the 'complex'...but, the main pool is a combination of a small kids play area, fake-rock water slide, food bar/snack bar/bar and sun lounger area. It is located near the Artists Palette (shop/serve your self restaurant) and the Turf Grill (dining room). The Spa is next door to the pool/check in area. The room. It has to be said, they are well thought out with all the necessary elements to make it feel like a home/apartment away from home...lots of little touches like ironing board, kitchenette with utensils, lots of towels, etc. Spacious for a family of 4 to co-exist without feeling cramped or lacking in convenience for storage, snacking/nibbles with a mini fridge and balcony. However, the lighting in our room was a bit dark. The doors seemed to always be getting in the way of people when they were opened and the relentless air conditioning made it a noisy sleep or a humid steam bath snooze. All of the bedlinen seemed synthetic and the carpets were a bit rough and seemed to have a faint mildew (typical of carpeting in Florida) smell...which, is why cleaning fluid smells are so in evidence! The positives: clean, a bit soul-less (like an apartment complex), well landscaped, frequent transport to all important places/sights/parks/etc, and very friendly staff. The downsides: the all pervasive smell of chlorine from the pools and cleaning fluids, the rooms are not that comfortable, and the expense. Disney is not cheap! Who is it perfect for? American families of 3 or 4...who, all seem to have an enormous quantity of baggage and child-care equipment...buggies, bags, push chairs, backpacks, etc. Plus, Americans seem more used to the 'apartment' style hotels than Europeans...do you bring towels to the pool, or get them there? Can you wear flip flops to dinner? Where do you get microwave popcorn at midnight if you haven't brought your own? (all real questions i overheard at the front desk). You get towels at the pool, yes you can wear flip flops (sandals) and the Artists Palette sells micro-pop till closing (at 11pm). If you drive to Disney, and want a week with space for all of your equipment, and if you enjoy kiddie-friendly pools for the 3 - 10 year old age group...this is the place to come with friends and family. It is not a 'hotel' per se...more of an apartment-hotel complex located conveniently for more restaurants and shops than the theme parks. As I said, I am a huge fan of Disney - but, won't be returning to the Saratoga Springs. The Grand Floridian is the place to stay if you want to splurge 'on property' of Disney...otherwise, stay at one of the more dedicated professional hotels outside the park and save your money for food/drink and souvenirs in park. Nice try Disney, but fell short of the mark across the finish line!

<Title>“Great Disney location for teens and adults!”
<Content>We stayed at saratoga springs from April 6-13. We were in villa 1810 in Congress Park. We had a nice Downtown Disney view. My teenage daughters liked to go over there and also to sunbathe at the congress park pool, rather than the crowded main pool (except for one day when it was 66--warm for us, but the pool was almost empty!). The carpet was a little worn, but otherwise the room was perfect. It was nice to have my daughers in one room, my son in the living room on the pullout couch (VERY comfortable), and my husband and I actually had privacy in our own room on a family vacation! We had a car and drove to some of the Disney parks, but the bus transportation seemed adequate even for the busy spring break time. As for other amenities, I did notice the counter service restaurant was jammed at some times, but we didn't eat in it. I got a hydrotherapy massage at the spa and it was wonderful. The desk was very helpful to us. And we also used the boat transportation to downtown disney, which was a nice break when we were too tired to walk. All in all we spent one fewer day in the Disney parks because we were so enjoying our hotel and downtown disney time!

<Title>“Wonderful for relaxing with kids”
<Content>As a member of DVC, I have my pick of places to stay in WDW. I really enjoy staying at Saratoga Springs. It is a little off the beaten path park-wise but is very convienent to Downtown Disney, a favorite of ours, and a really nice pool. I recommend a car to get around, though. The buses work but can be slow and I always feel my stop is the last stop the bus makes. Also, with a stroller the buses can be a challenge. The rooms were well decorated with only minor blemishes. We normally get the 2 bedroom so my mother can come and visit so it appears very roomy to us, and you can't beat the full kitchen and washer/dryer. My son loves the pool and we like the Spa, so it works out well. I caution people not to expect your normal hotel services here. No room service. But, Downtown Disney is in walking distance or just minutes by car and they do have a self service cafeteria.

<Title>“Econo Lodge?”
<Content>I rely on TripAdvisor for hotel and restaurant reviews quite regularly. I have never felt compelled to write my own review until now. For Disney to sell SSR as a "Deluxe" should be criminal. Our villa (2547-Congress Park) was extremely dirty and unkept. Just a few examples are: dirty grout lines in bathroom tile, completely worn carpeting (couldn't even see design), chipped paint throughout, stained bedding, etc., etc., etc. We are new DVC members and used our "insentive points" for this trip. I will say with 100% certainty that we will never, under any circumstances, stay at this resort again. As a matter of fact, I would have rather stayed at an All Star Resort or Pop Century. I called DVC and notified them of the room's issues and they kindly refunded one night's worth of points. However, we are concerned that we bought into a "Club" that provides accomodations similar to that of a Choice hotel or Holiday Inn. Last, please be warned that SSR if very far from everything except Downtown Disney. I've been to WDW over 20 times in my life and am very good at navigating the transportation system. This was the only visit during which I was annoyed. It took us 75 minutes to get from SSR to the Polynesian for dinner. We will opt for EPCOT or Magic Kingdom resorts from this point forward. Feel free to email with any specific questions.

<Title>“Just what we needed with minor problems.”
<Content>Bought into this timeshare years ago and have never stayed until now. My in-laws and one sister-in-law and her family stayed last year and loved it. It is a VERY large property but beautifully landscaped. Golf course runs through the property towards the main entrance area. We stayed in Congress Park with it's own pool/spa area. Loved it for the fact that it was not overcrowded. Visited the main pool once (way too crowded) and appreciated Congress Park pool even more! Since we came without our daughter this trip, the studio was just fine. The room was adequate sized but could have been a bit bigger. Buy/bring your own coffee/creamer since you get one pack of complimentary coffee and several small packs of coffee condiments. We had a metallic smell in the room that didn't go away with the doors opened. Our room faced Downtown Disney and the river. Loved the view of Downtown Disney at night with all the lights (minimal noise heard from Downtown Disney). Easy 5 minute walk to the restaurant and store. Didn't like the eggs at breakfast (the only time we ate breakfast the whole trip). My husband loved the sandwiches and I loved the salads! The House salad with the lemon-poppyseed dressing was awesome! The Spa was nice and massage was just what I needed on the day it rained midway through our trip. Hospitality area available near main pool for those with a later flight after check out. Will stay again but possibly in a bigger room.

<Title>“DVC is not for me - we won't be back to this property”
<Content>This is a HUGE property. The grounds and beautiful and the pools look nice. We stayed in a studio and thought the rooms were terrible (Small and depressing, old furnishings). No room service available and there is only one full service restaurant and one self service restaurant on the property(did I mention it was huge). The full service restaurant had no availability for dinner. If you did not rent a car or have dinner reservations - good luck!!! We stayed in a friends DVC and beware if there are not enough towels in the room they do not give them out willingly. Everything costs extra (extra soap, etc). The buses are crowded. If you are not staying at one of the Disney properties with the monorail you might as well stay outside and save yourself a few dollars.

<Title>“Another Great Week at Saratoga Springs”
<Content>This is our second visit exchanging with Interval International. Our condo was very nice, but the second location looked at parking lot while the first time we overlooked the lake. Transporation was convenient to the condo. The accommodations was upscale with a separate bedroom, huge bath with jetted tub and shower in another part of bath. Kitchen had granite counters and most of the usual upscale items. No HD TV's but we didn't really need that. It was expensive paying for the internet as I needed every day. . .that added another $70 to the $129 resort fee and the $149 trading fee. All and all, it was a nice stay and I would recommend.

<Title>“Great but...”
<Content>Our second visit here following purchase of Disney points. The complex is large now and fully open. It is very clean although there were times when the Disney dream fell short. We required special cleaning of the apartment but this was not done and a lingering smell would not go away. The main bedroom backed onto the ice machine and a constant drone could be heard. The holiday was never spoilt and Disney always lives up to its good reputation but on occasions could do a little better.

<Title>“They closed the main pool for 3 weeks in peak season?!”
<Content>I really question the management of an organization that closes the main pool of one of their largest resorts for three weeks in peak season. Closure wasn't noted on the website when I booked last August, happened to find out about it at the last minute so requested a Villa in Congress Park section (which had it's own smaller pool and was closest to Downtown Disney). Proximity to Downtown Disney is the main thing Saratoga has going for it, and even that's not saying as much as it would be if Pleasure Island nightclubs were open. Living area in the 2 BR Villas were much smaller than at Old Key West, and gave one the impression of staying in a sterile, corporate apartment instead of at a resort. Food at the Artists Pallette was terrible, cardboard sandwiches & flatbreads--kids couldn't finish their food and neither could I. Turf Club restaurant/lounge looked nice, but who knows if it really was--restaurant was only open from noon-9 pm. Spa was nice but pricey, & they try to push their expensive products on you when treatment is over. On the positive side, bus service was fine, and we got to all the parks quite quickly/efficiently. Bedrooms were also spacious and comfortable. But to repeat, what amazed me most was that for the peak season rates I paid, the main pool was not open. Disney must be hiring ex-Wall Streeters to schedule their resort maintenance. Next year I'll stay at Old Key West again, or check out the new Animal Kingdom Villas or Beach Club. Staying here once would be okay, IF you're in Congress Park and like Downtown Disney, but I for one will not be repeating.

<Title>“Not bad- not great”
<Content>We Stayed at Saratoga for 6 nights and it was ok. The 1sr room they put us in a dark studio overlooking the parking lot? And it could not have been further away from the main pool and main buildings. (We complained and moved the next day to stido that was much closer thankfully!) The bus service was good, the main pool was open and really fun but we were dissapointed in the restaurants. Very expensive at the "store" and the counter service meals were awful and to the dismay of our kids....no french fries served at all? I have an allergy to down pillows and asked for one that was not down- Housekeeping argued with me- and continually told me that they didn't carry feather/down pilows. Finally they sent up a new pillow. ( Which I showed to the maid the actual "feathers" tag on the pillow and she was like Ohhh ok.) Could care less- All in all it was ok- but we won't rush back here. We actually liked staying at the Riverside better

<Title>“Beautiful resort but not up to disney standards.”
<Content>I had a myriad of minor issues with this place. Day 1 I was thrilled, the room was great, service was awesome, no waiting in long food service lines. My significant other and I would poke each others ribs every time we saw our bellman as no matter what he was doing he had a gigantic goofy smile on his face - the guy really seemed to enjoy his life, anyone who knows Disney gets how viral this feeling is. anyway, minor things, day 2 i decided to splurge and spent what I consider a large amount on a flower arrangement as a surprise for my SO while she was at the spa. That got lost for almost a day. The florist did a fine job, the hotel personnel lost it in the dock area I guess. No big except I'm only there for 6 days and this thing wasn't cheap and they weren't super proactive about finding it for me. day 3 I was sick as a dog with a cold so I decided to take a bath and thats when I noticed how awful dirty the tub was. Unacceptable. With the hours i spent on our couch that day I noticed this was pretty tired too. "complimentary" in room coffee cost $5 to deliver and for that price I'll just go buy good coffee every morning (except its disney so its nescafe garbage. bring your own which I will do in the future). Two occasions I waited for the bus about 25 mins. I don't know that "more buses" will fix this issue on such a large set of properties, but maybe a shuttle service to downtown would make sense. I dunno, it's Disney's job to fix it, not mine :) Pool is undergoing renovation. No big, luckily I don't have kids. DVC tells you that pool hopping is just fine and dandy and then you get a list of all the places you're not allowed to hop too and all the times you can't hop. Not that they have any idea who is staying where but it's kinda silly. The quick service food at this place SUCKED. That's probably more of a personal thing because I didn't like the taste, not that it was necessarily bad. Saratoga also is a "New York State" themed resort so it has a tendency to attract New York city residents (why would you go on vacation only to stay at a place that reminds you of home?). Generally people from the midwest, like us, need a little more personal space and we're generally a little softer in our personal interactions with each other. Take this with a grain of salt it's completely my own opinion, but not every character at Disney is hired by them :) Minor stuff. DVC is an awesome experience but I will probably not be back to Saratoga.

<Title>“Saratoga Springs - Glorified seedy hotel.”
<Content>We just returned last night and didn't want to wait to write a review - hopefully sparing someone else from spending their points or money at this hotel. We were given 3 nights of our stay as an incentive for buying more DVC points. We decided to use our points to add on 3 more nights, and used more points to get a room for my inlaws too. Our 2 bedroom villa was nothing less than disgusting. The window sills were rotted, the carpet looked like the original one that was installed whenever this place was built (worn, pulls, stains, lumps - we wouldn't even take our shoes off) and overall the place was musty smelling and dingy. But we got off easy - my inlaws had the same dingy-ness with an added sour milk smell. We REALLY should have complained but just sucked it up. Believe me, my letter is going out in the mail today. Also, upon check-in, we were notified that the main pool was closed for refurbishment -- I have 4 young children and spending a day or 2 at the pool is just as important as going to the parks, so this was devastating to us and to my kids. There was no notification given to us of this prior to our arrival. So instead, we had to use the pool by our unit - which was a very basic pool - no slides, no snack bars, no drinks - nada. Very boring. Totally not what I have in mind for a vacation. We were in Congress Park, so if you needed anything from the store it was a 10 minute walk. Really not convenient. Considering this was our first visit using our vacation points, it really makes me nervous of what is to come. I hope this was not an indication of what the resort that we joined (Animal Kingdom Lodge) is going to be like. Anyway, don't waste your money here -- the All-Stars could not possibly be worse and are a helluva lot cheaper.

<Title>“Fabulous”
<Content>This was our first experience as DVC Members and we spent ten days at SSR including New Years Eve and it was absolutely fabulous. We are actually going back in March. The grounds are beautiful, the buses run constantly, never waiting long, getting to the buses from the parks is easy as SSR is one of the first few bus stops not a long walk. The rooms are wonderful and the staff is of course Disney's best. Food was great at the restaurants and the spa and gym are wonderful. We loved the hot tubs and the main pool. The concierge staff is excellent and always wiling to help with the littlest details like horseback riding. Everything about this resort is wonderful and I am not easy to impress. We use to stay at the All Star Resorts what a difference. Luggage arrived immediately not a five hour wait, room was ready right away and immaculate. I cannot recommend this enough we are totally looking forward to going back in March and staying at SSR. We love taking the boat to Downtown Disney its awesome. We played tennis, basketball, the pool has great activities and we rented bikes and checked out the resort. Being a DVC Member is absolutely wonderful and we love it.

<Title>“Impressed”
<Content>We have just spent 10 days at Saratoga Springs and we were very impressed. I booked direct with Disney which also included the magical express transfer. It started badly when we had to made up the sofa bed (they knew there were four of us) and the the luggage had an unknown arrival time due to the magical express (not an issue if you hadn't been traveling on and of for 23 hours and needed to sleep) but they recovered well. Great location very close to Downtown Disney (which is why I chose it) boat or a 10 minute walk. One main pool full of little excited children but other pools dotted about so you can swim. We were in the Paddocks right near the pool and bus stop so that was really easy. Several bus stops so rarely huge amounts of people getting on and they try to get two buses round if it looks as if they need them. Actually after the holiday weekend it stayed busy and there was a bad day for buses on the Tuesday, my husband and son wanted to come back from Disney's Hollywood and were transported by one of the Disney Execs helping out and he said the buses were an issue and they were working on it next day it was all sorted. The maids were great we left in chaos most mornings at 7.15am and when we got back all was tidy. I found the front desk and concierge very good and we could even get checked in etc through to the UK as we flew with North West. If they said they would do something they did it and on time. We rarely ate at the hotel but the night we did the food and service was very good but we had to wait an age as it was too cold to sit outside and that was half the table space. The Artists Palette provided basics for breakfast but I agree they could do more with this as there are people who spend time at the property not all day in the parks as we did. Saratoga is also close to Epcot its the quickest journey on the bus and the most timely. Nice property lots of space lakes and relaxing, we had previously stayed at the Polynesian and we all liked this better.

<Title>“Pleasantly surprised with Saratoga Springs”
<Content>I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this resort but it turned out to be a very nice resort. The resort had alot of amenities for adults and children. The staff was always willing to try and accomodate any request that you had. The grounds of the resort was very beautiful and relaxing...much better than I had expected. This resort is directly across the water from Downtown Disney so the rooms that face that area, really have a beautiful view at night. There are so many pretty areas to this resort, you have ponds with water fountains and then there were areas that surround the golf course. I traveled with my parents and my 6 year old son. We rented a 2 bedroom villa that faced a nice courtyard that overlooked one of the ponds...very relaxing. This resort really worked well for my parents since they choose not to go to the parks every day. My son even talked Grandpa into riding bikes around the resort one day and they both came back and said how pretty it was. We were there during a busy time but you never felt crowded. I'm sure the weather played into that alittle bit. We had weather that ranged from mid 70s to high 60s, so the pool area wasn't that crowded. We did use the main pool 2 of the days and it really is a nice pool. My son said it was one of his favorite slides. We have stayed at Animal Kingdom as well as Port Orleans Riverside and visited Port Orleans French Quarter as well as Caribbean Beach for swimming. The resort really is nice with kids...tons of things going on all day with the staff and they also have movies at night for the kids by the pool. This resort also has a kids club if you would like to have some adult time...I did not utilize this but in talking with some of the guests...it was rated highly, they said the staff was great with the kids and had alot of things for them to do. Overall, I would not hesitate to come back to this resort. I'm glad I had the opportunity to stay here because it changed my opinion of this resort. I forgot to mention this earlier, but I rented points from a vacation club member from www.disboards.com and it really saved alot of money. I will be traveling this way from now on. :)

<Title>“Spacious and comfortable”
<Content>5 of us stayed for 4 nights in a 2-bedroom. The unit was huge, nicely decorated, with washer/dryer and a great view over the lake. We loved having a full kitchen where we could have cereal or even eggs and bacon for breakfast before heading out for the parks. The pool with the slides looked great, but it was chilly the week we were there. The bus stop for the parks was right outside of our building, and we could even walk to Downtown Disney. Beautiful property, Disney quality, looking forward to another visit!

<Title>“My return to the Saratoga Springs”
<Content>This was my third year staying at the Saratoga Springs. We are not part of the DVC, but continue to stay here - because why mess with a good thing! This year we stayed in a 1BR unit and my inlaws stayed in the studio. Well, they were adjoining rooms so with the door open it was the EXACT same room as a 2BR unit. So booking a 2BR unit would have been much cheaper in the end (and it also defeated our purpose of having separate rooms, but I digress....). This is the first year that I found the carpets to be a little worn, but everything else was great. The room was spotless, linens were fresh and clean and all the dishes/flatware were clean. Housekeeping ran the dishwasher for us each day and always brought new toiletries and detergent, even if we had not used them up. The grounds, like all of Disney, are very well maintained and spotless. I really wish they had a central room to get on a computer and check email. I would think that would be a no braine for a vacation club resort. You can have internet in your room if you bring your laptop and pay the daily fee for the cord (no wireless), but no common computer area. No words can describe the convenience of having a washer/dryer in the room, especially now that the airlines are starting to charge for luggage checks. I packed for myself and two childern in one suitcase and simply threw in a load of laundry every night. The week we were there were the coldest days in the history of Orlando. Just my luck! So we never got to use the pool. But I assume it was heated because some crazy families were still in the water. Our room in the Springs building was conveniently located to the pool, main building and restaurants. The Grandstand building also has its own, less crowded pool which is lovely in warmer weather. Springs is the building to request if you dont want to walk much around this VERY large property. Grandstand is good too because there is a path that cuts across to the main area. The other buildings are a longer walk, but also quieter. The Disney bus system is often scrutinized in reviews, no matter what hotel it is. It's not a personal limo service, people! The bottom line is that they come APPROX ever 20 mins. It could be a little more at certain times. If you just missed one by minutes, then you will obviously wait a longer time. There were times we waited 3 minutes and times we waited 20 mins. It is what it is. The buses are clean, direct and they save you money on car rental/parking and time. Even if you have a car, I recommend using the bus for the Magic Kingdom because it takes you directly to the main gate (as opposed to parking, taking the parking lot tram, going through gate 1, taking the monorail and then finally getting to the main gate) which is SO much easier. There are 5 bus stops within the SS so those stops adds a few minutes to the ride. The buses stop at them in the same order, so if you have 2 stops going toward the park, you'll always have 3 coming back in. The water taxi and walking path to downtown Disney are great. the water taxi lets you off on the marketplace end of downtown disney and the path take you to the west side of downtown disney. So if you are going to a specific restaurant, keep that in mind. General Disney tip - try to make as many of your meal reservations in advance if you can. 407-WDW-DINE does the restaurants in the parks as well as others on Disney property, including the Turf Cub at Saratoga Springs and the Downtown Disney locations. Going "standby" at restaurants will make things much longer and frustrating. The Artist's Palette is okay. Service was slow during busy times but the food and the variety are both pretty good. They sell some essential groceries at the expected Disney markup prices. If you have a car, there is a Winn Dixie about 5 mins away. Turf Club was very good and I recommend taking advantage of it, especially after a busy day at a park when you don't want to be out walking and dealing with lines anymore. If you have a baby, the rooms come with a high chair and pack and play so you don'tneed to request them. Next year I am thinkng of trying the Old Key West, just to mix it up a little. But I am nervous to make that move because SS has always been so great for us. Having a separate bedroom for the kids makes a world of difference at night. When doing your research here, you need to remember to compare SS against other Disney resorts, NOT against a typical 5 star resort. I really feel that some reviewers here were expecting the Ritz Carton based on the price of this resort and are then let down. This is a pricier Disney location because it is better than OTHER DISNEY resorts. Try to keep the perspective. I hope you enjoy the SS as much as we have for 3 visits!

<Title>“Enjoyable Family Trip”
<Content>We are disney vacation club members and received a free trip here as an incentive. It was a beautiful hotel and very quiet and serene with low theming compared to some of the other disney hotels. Our 2 bedroom villa was roomy with a great view of the lakes. We asked to be in the "Springs" section as they have many sections. We were right next to the main pool and restaurant. Artist Pallette, the eatery, was so great. The food was good and they had a large variety of things. The pool was really great for the kids, we could rent water toys and a safety vest for our little one and the slide was fun for our 6 year old. The bar stayed open even though it was January. The walk to downtown disney was a lot shorter than people kept telling me it would be. We ended up taking a car most of the time though since we had 2 kids and a giant stroller. It was a great place for adults at disney since it was really very quiet. One downside - the pull out sofabed was not very impressive and the washer and dryer were pretty loud when you had them on.

<Title>“Great for Downtown Disney Lovers!”
<Content>Heres the plus side...Very nice resort. Friendy staff. Nice rooms, good size. Close to downtown disney! But... If you want to go to a park, it is very inconvient. There are no other ways except for buses. The bus ride waits are long. I hear they have a wonderful spa but didn't stay long enough to find out. Only stayed a couple of nights before our cruise. I think it is a great resort for someone not planning on going to the parks much. For some relaxation and some fun in downtown, its perfect. Will stay there again if I go before another cruise.

<Title>“Gorgeous Resort with all Amenities”
<Content>We are DVC members, and this was our first vacation on our membership & first stay at Saratoga Springs. The bottom line is this resort is absolutely beautiful, and I could stay here a week or longer without even leaving the property and still thoroughly enjoy my vacation. We had 3 adults and 2 kids in a 2-bdrm villa, and it was amazing. It felt like we had 3 hotel rooms into 1: the master suite was spacious, and the living room & kitchen we comfortable and fully functional (including full size fridge, oven, cook top, dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker, full size sink, microwave, stocked with dishes, and it even had washer/dryer stack). Our guest had her own bedroom with tv + full bath and 2 full size beds. Living room had a pull-out sofa, so in total this villa was able to sleep 5 adults very comfortably. The resort itself has everything you expect from a top quality vacation spot, including multiple dining choices, spa, golf, bike riding, etc. I particularly liked the close proximity to Downtown Disney, which is why we picked Saratoga over some other options, and the Disney bus service was also very convenient. I'm just not sure what could be better about our stay here. If there was one thing I was slightly disappointed about, it was the lack of wireless internet (probably because this place is just so huge), but that was easily remedied by picking up a wireless router from a nearby store and hooking that up to the broadband connection in the master. I think anyone who stays here will be totally satisfied like I was.

They have a great pool with slides for the kids and multiple small pools that are quiet for the adult. The rooms are always very clean and have a fresh updated look.

<Title>“Our first Disney Vacation Experience and hopefully the last”
<Content>Reserved a villa, it was dirty, I wouldn't have the furniture in my basement. Service was terrible, we were never contacted that our room was ready, a maid had to tell us. We rented an ECV and when we questioned bell service to see if it was delivered was told no and to call back in an hour. Upon calling the ECV rental, found out it was delivered the day before. Talking to someone else at Bell Services found out it had been delivered the day before and was sitting there waiting to be picked up. The window in one of the bedrooms leaked water when it rained, and the carpeting was so dirty it turned our socks black. When we looked at the model of the place at Disney Vacation Club, all the tv's were flat screen. Not so in the villa. Cobwebs hung from the chandelier. Contacted the Disney Vacation Club--sorry, told us to contact the hotel manager. Spoke with her, she was terrific. We had about 6 Disney people inspecting our room. The carpeting was cleaned over the traffic areas and the things we complained about were fixed. Too little too late. We were also given some Disney points back. AND TO TOP IT OFF, our luggage never got to the airport. Now I could chalk it up to an accident, but there were 4 other couples in the Northwest Baggage office----all from Disney!!!!! Never again will we go to Saratoga Springs. I am very disappointed.

<Title>“Disney anything is priceless”
<Content>I was getting frustrated trying to find a hotel in Orlando/Disney that didn't have bad reviews, but almost everyone was either terribly expensive or had a lot of people with bad experiences. I finally decided to trust Disney and booked the lowest cost hotel/resort I could find on their property. Since I was booking for a trip two days from the time I began searching, all the least expensive places were taken, but I called Disney's phone number and managed to find a good deal. $189 a night for a room at the Saratoga Springs Resort. This place is just awesome. From the moment they greet you at the gate "welcome home" to pulling up to the always uplifting Disney music playing at the carport to check-in, to walking into a wonderful room, I was impressed. Keep in mind that part of the room cost offsets paying for parking at any of the Disney theme parks, since they have a free shuttle bus. The shuttle picked me up right outside our room, and took us direct to Epcot after 2 stops at the other buildings at this resort. At the end of the night, it was only a 10 minute wait for a bus (time that would have been spent sitting in traffic or walking to a car parked far away) that took us straight to the resort. This ease of transportation is worth far more than the cost of parking. Advice to first timers at this place (which I was): consider staying here just to take advantage of the spa facilities and proximity to Downtown Disney.

<Title>“LOVED Saratoga Springs!!!!”
<Content>My family of five stayed at the Saratoga Springs Resort, in a one bedroom villa from Feb 27 till Mar 5 2008. I cant say enough good things about our stay. First, the room was beautiful and spacious. We go to Disney every year and this is the first time we stayed in a Villa. I don't know how I lived without the in room washer & dryer! My 4 year old daughter askes all the time "When are we going back to that house with the tub that had the jets" not when are we going to Disney...that should tell you something right there. The maid service was excellent and the rest of the staff was so wonderful to us. They had balloons and a birthday card signed by all of the characters waiting for my daughter. What a great surprise for a kid. We are into pin trading, and the staff is so great about taking their time and trading with the kids. My Daughter saw a pin that she was hopeing to find on one of the cast members lanyards on a late night trip to the pool with my husband, and she didn't have her lanyard with her. When he saw how excited she was to see it, then how disappointed she was that she didn't have her lanyard with her, he just gave it to her, without the trade.... These kinds of things make the magic at Disney so wonderful for the children. These are just a couple of things....the list could go on and on. The pool is beautiful and always warm. The gounds are pristine and the air just smells great there. I would recommend the SSR to anyone and I cant wait to go back next month!! The first time we are staying at the same resort two years in a row! Thanks DISNEY!!!

<Title>“Relaxing saratoga”
<Content>We stayed ay Disney's Saratoga Springs from 20th to 28th December 2008. We had a 2 bedroom accommodation, which was spacious and had all the facilities we needed. 2 Doubles in 1 bedroom with an en-suite, lounge, full kitchen, balcony, master bedroom with en-suite including Jacuzzi bath. We had a pool next door to us, which was ideal as the main pool was usually to full to find a sunbed unless you got there really early. The grounds are immaculately kept, buses ran frequently, boats as well. My only gripe would be the size of the food court and the restricted food options available.

<Title>“Far from the magic”
<Content>This was our 6th trip to WDW and first time at Saratoga Springs. Saratoga is a very similar experience to staying at Disney's Old Key West. The property is huge and the grounds are beautiful. However, it is difficult to get around quickly. We used our car most of time and relied on the bus service to the Magic Kingdom only, which was just fine. The 1 bedroom was clean and comfortable. My only complaint is the distance one has to walk to get to the food court and pool. Plus, it is far from all of the parks. We prefer staying either on the monorail route or in the Epcot hotels.

<Title>“satisfying but so-so stay at the saratoga”
<Content>We traveled, four families, over Christmas. Usually, I research and book trips, but this time a family member had his secretary do everything. She picked Saratoga Springs. We had a very nice time. Spacious rooms, 3 tv's for 3 areas. very nice tub with jacuzzi in master. Nice kitchen with microwave etc.. I liked the aspect of having a washer and dryer, and I liked the fact that we had maid service every day. Since I did not do the research, I cannot completely criticize. When I book a resort for a family vacation. I book a room that is near the shuttle, near the pool, and absolutely includes a breakfast. We did not have these options. Again, I don't want to write an unfair review, because I know there was some type of meal plan, we did not have the meal plan on our trip. So we were far from the shuttles, (got off at the wrong stop and wandered around for 40 minutes one night, all fourteen of us, we were far from the pool, we were far from the store and restaurants. Again, not the resorts fault, our secretary did not ask the right questions. We stayed at Congress Park. And the shuttles were quite slow in the mornings. Now, having said that, the rooms were nice and clean, with everything replenished every day. Except, sadly, my daughter's 50 dollar visa gift card was stolen from room by maid service. I didn't report it, since she should not have left it out, but other than that, no complaints. We had no proof about the gift card and like I said, I just let it go. The resort was clean and quiet. I never saw the pool. If we had stayed in a section, closer to the shuttle, restaurants and pool, then....that would have been great. Also, they screwed up our return to the airport and we did waste over one hour of our time and came close to missing our flight. they were supposed to print out boarding passes right at the lobby,( a wonderful service to make the airport transition smooth) but after waiting and waiting, they finally admitted their system was down, and they could not print out the passes and by then the airport shuttle was gone. When my husband spoke to a woman named Anne, she told him to go and get a taxi yourself. ( 3 or 4 taxis we were supposed to pay for ourselves.) He got angry and said with a mountain of luggage (fourteen people's worth) how were we supposed to go and hail a taxi and lug the luggage (again) and Anne said if you had fourteen people we should be able to handle it. (Very rude and none of her business) She did not know the ages and health restrictions of our family members. However, after much ado, they rectified the mess by sending us our own huge bus and got us to the airport where we all got in yet another line and got our boarding passes. So, to summarize, if you are in the right location and on a meal plan, this could be the right place. Clean and quiet. They are crowded and make mistakes but they do try to correct them. We left with good memories any way, so that mean the trip was a success, but for our next trip to disney, I will research other places.

<Title>“Superb holiday”
<Content>The 2 bedroomed apartments are spacious, beautifully maintained, and in the heart of disney. They are comfortable and ideal for a 'push the boat out' family holiday. the pools are warm and the staff can't do enough to help - just what you expect of disney! On site resaurants are good value for money and close to downtown disney - kids loved the boatride to get there - all complimentary. We will definately go back!

<Title>“Awesome!!! Beautiful Resort-Great Staff!!!!!!!”
<Content>I was a little nervous about staying at the Saratoga when I read reviews before we left on Dec 17th. I have 4 in my family. Husband, myself, 6 year old girl, 2 year old boy. I originally booked a studio, but due to the fact I had some issues when trying to book this hotel with Disney Destinations, I got a free upgrade!!! GO DISNEY!!!! They more then made up for the hassle of taking 3 hours to book. We got upgraded to a one bedroom suite!!! It was beautiful. We stayed in the Congress which was quite a bit away from the main pool, but super close to Downtown Disney. We could walk there in 3 minutes along the path behind our Building. Instead of waiting at the Congress bus stop for buses that took long, we walked 3 minutes to Downtown Disney stop and got on a bus ususally right away. So we figured a way around the bus issues. We felt at home at the resort. The first day we got there we stayed at the main pool all day. We loved it!!! Do yourself a favor and don't poop yourself out right away going to all the parks, get some R&R at the Resort. They won't disappoint!!!! Ride the surrey bikes, its a nice ride on beautiful grounds. The only thing that may have gotten a little old is the Artist Palette restaurant. The menu was small and never hardly changed. Wished they would have had more of a variety. Other than that, we were all from very happy!!! Merry Xmas!!!

<Title>“Loved This Resort!”
<Content>We just returned from a 5 day stay in a 2 bedroom villa. The accommodations are absolutely awesome for not only adults but for kids as well. This resort was so incredibly quiet that I sometimes wondered if the other rooms were booked --- they were! Grounds are beautiful and well maintained. We stayed in the Paddock so the bus stop was just ouside of our building. I would highly recommend this resort for anyone. I do agree with the poster that said you should allow extra time to enjoy all of the benefits of Saratoga Springs. I wish we did.

<Title>“Fantastic trip!”
<Content>The only con is the price, but if you can afford it, it is fantastic! Our biggest regret was not leaving more time for staying at the resort. If you are going to pay the money, then save some time to enjoy it. We were too busy on the run from park to park that we only used the pools late at night, didn't get to use the spa at all, and had to use up several left over meals from our meal plan as we were checking out. This resort is awesome. Staff was friendly. Housekeeping very efficient and really paid attention to details. Pools were fantastic and hot tubs were very warm and relaxing. The steak house on site was high priced, but with our Disney meal plan, we only paid tips. The hotel also had a quick store and counter service again that was priced a little high, but our Disney meal plan covered it. We actually took a little boat over to Downtown Disney which was easy and relaxing. We had a one bedroom suite, which had a full kitchen, dishwasher, washer/dryer, huge garden tub, and separate shower area. The king size bed was very comfortable and cozy. The blinds really darkened the room so much that we never made it to any early entry hours at the parks. We did well to get up and out by noon since the room was so great after long nights at the parks. Busing to the parks came quickly although they were very, very cold even in August. The overall feel and grounds were so relaxing. It sits on a golf course itself and my son was able to walk over to the golf range. We have only ever stayed at the Sports hotel and did return to it in October. I was miserable there after staying at Saratoga Springs. We even came back to S.S. on our last day to eat and swim a bit before leaving. My son works at Magic Kingdom and we are returning again in December. i can't afford S. S. on this round even with his discount due to Christmas, but I have to say after staying at both I would rather stay at a not Disney hotel then to return to the Sports hotel on Disney. Saratoga was so close to Downtown Disney and easy to get to when leaving for groceries or shopping or to get my son at his apartment. The Sports hotel took so long to get to and was very inconvenient. We are actually going to try the Vista Palace this time based on reviews at Trip Advisor. Our family had lots of good memories from this resort that will last a lifetime. If you can afford it or can get a discount on one of the sites, you will be pleasantly surprised. It is a place that is worthy of the Disney name.

<Title>“Great, even with our problems.”
<Content>We stayed here for one week in October for a family trip. We werein the paddock area, but could see the Congress Park bus stop from our sliding door. The location is great, the bus service leaves a little to be desired (this was off peak time, so I wonder what it would be like during peak - maybe better or worse). The quick service dining was good, but got repetivite after a week. And they charged $7 for a box of cereal. The turf club is a good sit down optoin though. We had our own situations (son sprained his ankle, I was extremely sick with a fever of 104 for 4 days), but we still had a blast. The kids (4 & 3) loved the pool and waterslides. I wish I could have enjoyed them more with the kids but I was so sick. The rooms were spacious and well kept. We weren't on DVC, but had a 2 bedroom and it was great. They even extended our check out time when I called the front desk and told them how sick I was and that I didn't want to be sitting in public areas with a 104 fever, etc. They did this free of charge, and it was very much appreciated. I would definitely stay here again. The only time I would not stay here is so that I could stay on the Monorail.

<Title>“If you don't like buses avoid Saratoga Springs”
<Content>I am a DVC Member, stayed at Old Key West, Boardwalk, and few other hotels that are not DVC. The property has very nice and rooms like most other DVC. The bus service this trip was horrible. There are 5 stops and if you are at stop 5 good luck some days. This resort is right next to down town Disney. We got on the bus at 7:00pm and were dropped off at 7:50pm. If you are traveling without younger ones the bus issues may not bother you. If you have young ones and strollers it makes for a longer day to deal with slow bus service and packed buses. We did like the counter service options, made it easy some days being on the Food Plan to grab a quick meal.

<Title>“Beautiful Resort!”
<Content>We are DVC Members. This place is great for families or large parties, room for everyone to spead out (not referring to Studios).This is one of our home resorts. We love it. It is Beautiful. The grounds, decor...everything. My husband also loves this resort because it's convient to the golf course. We have only stayed in 1 and 2 bedroom villas.Very spacious. If you prefer not to dine out all day every day then you want to stay at one of the Villas because you have a fridge, stove, microwave, dishwasher...we didn't cook each day but we had breakfast each morning in our "home". It came in handy too for late night snacks. And on the days we didn't visit the parks we were so happy we had it as we at Breakfast, lunch and dinner at home. Also, with washers and dryers in the 1. 2 and Grand Villas...no dirty laundry to unpack! BTW, you can also ship dry goods to your DW resort before you arrive, this cuts down on some costs too! Contact the hotel for more info! We have also (before becoming DVC Members) stay in athor DW resorts but so far this one is our fav!

<Title>“Another Excellent Stay.”
<Content>This is such a wonderful resort. A great place to relax after the bedlam of the parks. The location is fantastic. Across the water from DTD if you want to "extend" your day, or just relax next to the pool or along one of the many walks around the resort. The rooms and resort were spotlessly clean. The beds very comfortable and the grounds very peaceful. The staff were extremely polite and helpful. It is also very quick and easy to get to the parks from Saratoga Springs. Well done Disney.

<Title>“Love This Resort”
<Content>We are new Disney Vacation Club members and this was the second time that we've stayed at Saratoga Springs. I don't have a single complaint about either of our stays there. The rooms (first a 1 bedroom and then a 2 bedroom) were spacious and very clean. The front desk service and bell staff service were excellent. The resort has numerous pools so that no matter where you are staying within the resort, there is always a pool close by. The same goes for the bus stops, there is one stop for each area of the resort. Our next vacation will be at the Animal Kingdom just to try something different. However, we would not hesitate to go back to Saratoga Springs - we loved it.

<Title>“Love this resort”
<Content>I am a DVC member and have 2 home resorts, this is one of them, Animal Kingdom Villas is the other. I love SSR because of the close proximity to Downtown Disney and because it is far away from the parks. Sometimes you want to feel like you are not Disney, Disney, Disney 24/7. I have never had poor service or an accomodation that I did not like. I have stayed in a 2 bedroom and studio at this resort in bothe the Congress Park and The Paddock sections. They are both older sections but clean, well kept and within walking distance to downtown Disney. I think timing and how busy the resort is can make a slight difference in experiences. However, i have never been disappointed. Best decision we ever made!

<Title>“Nice, but not worth the money”
<Content>My family of 3 and our friends with a family of 4 stayed here the week of October 12th. This resort is a part of the Disney Vacation Club, and you can also book as a regular customer. We bought a week from a friend who is a DVC member. We paid our friend the same amount as a Disney Moderate Resort would cost, but were looking forward to the Deluxe accomodations upgrade. We were sadly disappointed. The studio has a queen bed and pull out couch, which does not comfortably sleep 2, so our friends had a hard time sleeping with 2 on a pull out couch! The room did have a fridge, and a microwave which we never did use. The bathroom was nothing special. It was a standard hotel room. This resort is no different than the moderate resorts, do not spend the extra money here for deluxe accomodations. It is close to Downtown Disney, but far to all the parks. It is a huge resort with 5 bus stops. We were at the first bus stop which was nice,as we were the first ones picked up and the first ones dropped off. this was our 8th trip to Disney and we have noticed a drop in Disney Service! The buses took longer than they ever have before, some we waited for 30 minutes, which on previous trips the longest wait was 15 minutes. Overall it was a good trip but I would not return to this resort as it is not worth the money and it does not have a good location.

<Content>I loved this resort. It was beautiful and convenient to Disney attractions. I especially like it being so close to Downtown Disney. I stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was just perfect. The only problem that I had was that they were slow about cleaning the rooms. I went there to relax, but they only wanted to clean the rooms early which was inconvenient to me. Other than that, I loved it. I will stay there again for sure.

<Title>“Good option for families with small children”
<Content>If you are traveling with small children, the full kitchen is great. Seven of us-- myself, my husband, my parents, and my three young children (5, 4, and 1) stayed in a 2-bedroom villa. We ate breakfast at the villa everyday, and at least one other meal per day. We had the groceries delivered by garden grocer-very convenient, a little pricey. With such young kids, having a ktichen and a means of transportation that did not involve strapping them into their carseats was wonderful. Pros: kitchen, large tub, and extra space; Mousekeeping was great. My kids LOVE the main pool. Grounds are lovely, and my kids loved walking around with all the fountains. Got area requested (Springs) and was very close to bus stop. Cons: the room had some wear and tear-- minimal, but when you are paying through the nose, you do notice the wear on the carpet and the stain on the couch (actually, the couch in the living room was just all around bad). I stressed a lot about transportation based on previous reviews but it turned out fine. My parents had one 40-minute wait for a bus to Downtown Disney (disability limits my dad's walking) and we had one other long wait for Disney's Hollywood Studios. Otherwise, we had very good luck with buses. They run VERY FREQUENTLY in the early morning, and I do suggest anyone with small kids get to the park before the park opens-- no lines for a couple hours. You get a lot done. The place is huge-- the Grandstand or the Springs are convenient for buses and main pool. But the quiet pools and playgrounds further out looked lovely. Other than some minor issues mentioned aboce, this resort worked very well for us and my kids had a great Disney vacation (low September crowds certainly helped).

<Title>“Saratoga was Good Not Great”
<Content>We just got back from our vacation at Saratoga Springs at Disney World in Orlando. My husband and I stayed in a studio from 9/14/08 thru 9/21/08. Overall our review of the hotel is good, not great. If you like a casual laid back open air style hotel than you will like this. The outside of the buildings are very pretty. This resort has many buildings so if you are in DVC or a timeshare exchange and you are looking to stay at Disney chances are they will have spots here first over the Beach Club, Yahct Club, Boarwalk or Animal Kingdom Villas. So if this what you can get, than I would go. It is on the Disney bus line, you have all of the standard ammenities etc. So I wanted to provide some critiques below that will help you understand why I thought it was good not great and why next time we would go to another resort. My only complaint about the room was that the toilet stunk, there was an offensive smell that came through the toilet. Also our extra set of blankets and sheets didn't look and smell very clean. The main pool area is cool. It has many nooks and crannies and a water slide, plus plenty of chairs to sit out. Another great feature was the laundry room right near the pool that is free of charge to resrot guests. I went to the pool mid way through our stay did a load of laundry and didn't feel like I was doing chores it because I was right back out at the pool in no time. We ate lunch at the turf club one day, it wasn't anything special but the food was good. If you want to buy your groceries from the Artist Palete you can, but do know they have a limited selection, I would recommend ordering from garden grocer. We used them and they delivered our groceries (which the bell station held until we got there) before we even arrived and they left me a couple messages to let me know they were on there way and that if we were in the room they would bring it to us. We went to other hotels to look around while we were here and the more compact styles (all in one big block of hotels) of the Yacht and Beach Club were preferrable to us. Saratoga Springs is one of the farthest from the parks (for an on-Disney property). We stayed in the Paddock (one of major blocks of hotels). Very nice outside, we were near to the quiet pool, which is just a regular square pool. We were a 5 min walk from the main building. A good tip is that there are several bus stops within Saratoga Springs, So take the estimates in times to the park and add a few minutes for travel through the resort. You do have good access to downtown disney from here, a really quick bus ride, a moderate walk or a boat ride will take you there in short order.

<Title>“Beautiful”
<Content>(I am just now (2008) discovering this site linked on the Disney World website, which is why it's such a late review.) We have gone to Disney once more since 2006 (see Boardwalk Inn). Anyway... Saratoga Springs was a beautiful hotel! We loved it. It was our first trip to DW and the 6 of us stayed in a 2 bedroom villa. Customer service was top notch as I have come to expect from Disney. Transportation was easy on the buses. My only complaint, which is a really small one, is that they did not provide conditioner - only shampoo.

<Title>“Fabulous Saratoga Springs”
<Content>We've just returned from the Saratoga Springs resort after 2 fabulous weeks. We are DVC members with our "home" as Animal Kingdom Lodge (my sons stayed there 5 nights during the 2 weeks, it's also amazing but busy with free Disney dining plan users from other resorts!) but we were unable to stay there as it was a late booking and so went to "the Springs" instead. We had a studio in the Springs block and it was in a great position for everything: Pool (towels provided, plenty of sun beds, bar, fab slide, 2 hot tubs etc) Artiste's Palette (excellent fresh made food and deli with very reasonable prices) Resort shop (beautiful things and good selection) Lounge (large TV, seating and free pool table) Reception (spacious and very helpful staff) Turf Bar and Grill (food fab) Laundry room (plenty washers and driers with free use) Community Hall ( free table football, free table tennis, huge TV, activity programme, free DVD hire for DVC members etc) Bus stop (we never waited more than 5 minutes and the bus drivers were great with my Mum in her wheelchair). The resort was quiet and very pretty. The studio was really nice with a kitchen area and plenty big enough for 3 adults - the bed settee was a bit hard and uncomfortable but it may have been ours as the 1 in my Son's studio was better. The parks as always were great and very quiet - Sept is obviously a good time to go! The Mickey's not so scary Halloween party was especially good (extra money but excellent), I recommend it. All in all a fab 2 weeks, I can't wait for next year!!

<Title>“Absolutely Wonderful Time”
<Content>My family and I just returned from an 8 night stay at Saratoga Springs. We are part of the Disney Vacation Club and used our points to stay in the 2 Bedroom Villa. WOW!!! It was beautiful. Our 2 daughters had their own bedroom and their own bathroom. Separate from the tub and toilet was a vanity with 2 sinks. They both could get ready at the same time without being in each others way. The bathroom off the master bedroom had a jaccuzzi tub as well as a shower. There was a full kitchen with a fridge, stove and dishwasher. We also had in suite laundry which came in handy. We were able to do a couple loads of laundry to freshen things up. The resort is very large but we don't mind walking so this was no big deal to us. We stayed in the Grandstand area. The bus stop closest to this area is the first stop for the buses that take you to the parks. This was nice because we would be one of the first ones on. Usually by the time it reached the last stop there was standing room only. The front desk staff were also very accommodating. The morning we arrived our room was not ready. We expected this as check in was not until 4:00pm Since we had travelled from the West Coast and had been up for over 24 hours we were all very tired. I explained this to the woman and she found us another room right away. So we were able to get some much needed rest. The first night we were there we took the boat across to Downtown Disney which was really nice. There is also a path which takes you there as well so a couple times we just walked over. Before leaving I read some reviews about the bus service. We seldom waited more than 10 or 15 minutes for a bus. They claim they run every 20 minutes and most times it was pretty close to that. At our bus stop there was usually someone there monitoring which buses had come. If you were waiting more than 10 minutes they would radio in to the main office to make sure one was on it's way. Since Saratoga is our home resort I can't wait to return there for our next vacation.

<Title>“Great home away from home”
<Content>I'm late on this review we stayed in january at saratoga springs in Disney world. We were worried this was going to be off the beaten path of disney but it was'nt to bad. We had a one bedroom and it was really nice. It had a nice size master bedroom with a huge bathroom. The kitchen was great for the meals we did eat there. There was a pull out sofa bed and that worked out great for our girls. The washere and dryer is so nice to have you dont have to worry about walking forever to the laundry area. This is a huge complex with buildings spanning out all over. You can end up being very far away from the main building where check in and cafeteria is. We rented a car and that worked well for us. We had a great view of down town disney, we loved that. The only down fall at this hotel is the bussing we used the bussing a few times and it did take a long time, thats why I feel having a car works out nice if you are staying here. All in all this was a wonderful place to stay with family. Oh and they had a really fun main pool area, the kids loved that. You will enjoy this hotel.

<Title>“Another Beautiful Disney Resort”
<Content>My family and I stayed at Saratoga Springs from 8/19-8/23. This resort is absolutely huge. I suggest doing your homework before you arrive so that you can request the area you would like to stay in. We requested the Springs section of the hotel because it is the closest to the main pool, lobby, and restaurants. However, if you are looking to have a view of Downtown Disney you will want to stay in other sections of the hotel that are considerably further away from the main areas. I've read other reviews and have seen plenty of complaints about the size of the resort and the distance from the main lobby some of the sections are. My response to that is...if you are lazy and do not like to walk then Disney probably isn't the place for you anyway. The grounds are beautiful, there are plenty of benches along the way, and even a few times a nice employee will offer you a ride on their golf cart. My family was there during Tropical Storm Fay so we did not get to explore as much as we would have had it not been raining every day. There is a walkway from the resort to Downtown Disney as well as a boat shuttle launch; neither of which we got to take advantage of. As far as dining options go, they are pretty limited here. There is a small food court type area that serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We ate breakfast here almost every morning and have no complaints. If you are looking for a quick meal and not some big, fancy sit down then this place does the trick. We did not eat lunch or dinner at the resort but did have a late night snack one night which was tasty. There is also a lounge area and full service restaurant. This was the only dissappointment...there is not an actual bar. There is only a walk up bar window and seating area with a pool table and small tv. If you want to relax at a bar I would go elsewhere. Port Orleans Riverside...which is only a boat ride away, has a nice lounge with a piano player and more upbeat atmosphere. I cannot fully comment on the pool area because, as I said, it rained every day. However, it did look nice. The slide looks fun for kids and there is a large hot tub and pool bar for adults. I think I covered mostly everything but if you have further questions you can contact me.

<Title>“1 Bedroom Villa is Grand”
<Content>Return visitor of this resort. This second stay saw great improvement from just one year ago. Family of 2 stayed in "The Springs" section in a 1 bedroom villa in first week of August 2008. Great experience for a leisure vacation. Close to the main pool, lobby, quick food service, and bus stop. Spacious villa with in room laundry, daily maid service for non DVC guests, Jacuzzi, stand-up shower, 2 TVs, full, kitchen, sofa sleeper, pack & play crib, ironing board/iron, vacumn, king bed and balcony. Villa was ready for early check-in as requested. Location on the main street side is a bit noisey from resort buses and delivery trucks. Store and quick food service is not open late. Didn't care for the main pool so we used the Grandstand pool and loved it. Bus service has improved since last year but they still don't have the bugs worked out. Also longs waits at the park to get a bus back to the resort. Well worth the $264 we paid per night with the Annual Passholder Discount. Excellent Magic Express service from MCO aiport, virtually no wait. From touchdown to in villa was less than 57 minutes. Expect long waits to board the boat to and from Downttown Disney, often have to wait for multiple boats to get seated.

<Title>“A Resort to Call Home”
<Content>Hello vacationer, Saratoga Springs was everything I had hoped it would be and more! I stayed there almost two weeks beginning on Aug. 3rd 2008 with my Husband, our Son and my younger Sister. We were greeted at the front gate by security which already had our info and welcomed us "Home." This immediately put me at ease and ensured that the kids could do their own adventure seeking while on the grounds! We checked in with no wait and were greeted by friendly "cast members" whom made the process extremely simple and fun for the kids. I was impressed at how much Disney trivia the cast members put into our brief encounter. Ex. There are over 30 thousand rooms at the WDW Resort and it would cost a few million dollars and over 90 yrs. to stay in each of them! Before we left the front desk, my Husband was given a "Happy Birthday" button which would prove to be his ticket to spontaneous greetings and even a song or two throughout the WDW resort and parks ! We were delighted to find a kitchenette in our "studio" supplied with a microwave, refrigerator, toaster etc. and it was nice to have coffee already in our room the next morning. The "Studio" is decorated in traditional New York Style with a few "Hidden Mickeys", if you look closely! We also had a nice balcony to sit on in the mornings and watch the golfers as they made their morning rounds. The studio proved to have ample space for 4 people and we liked that we could iron our clothes in the powder room while someone showered in the adjacent bath. Maintenance and Housekeeping were friendly and accommodation. In fact, we requested maintenance while we were there and they had someone out and the problem addressed in minutes. They didn't even enter our room to fix the minor mishap, and truthfully I had almost forgotten about it ! The pool area was fun and the kids spent every extra minute in the water or playing in the water features which I too joined in on the fun once or twice myself ! My Husband liked that he could sit at the lounge which was right at the pool and I liked the extremely convenient laundry facility which was located in the pool house. I could watch my shows while the laundry was going, (free of charge of course) and watch the kids in the pool area just in front of the building. There are also house phones around every corner if you need to call housekeeping or your room while you are out on the property, and I ended up using them a time or two when we forgot sunscreen or needed Disney info from the front desk. I had wondered if we should take the Disney (bus) transportation because it was said to be a long ride during busy seasons. However, the bus stop was a quick walk from our building and the buses ran literally every few minutes. We rode the bus to the Magic Kingdom on the first day, and went straight there with little or no wait. In fact, we drove to Typhoon Lagoon on the last day we were there, and I wished we had ridden on the bus after we parked and walked to the entrance ! I also would like to mention the resorts restaurant, "The Artists Palette" and gift shop, which were top notch in traditional Disney standards ! Be sure to buy a resort mug and get the free refills ! The resort also offered great activities for the kids each day we were there and Disney movies for the entire family at night in the main hall, so between visiting the parks and enjoying the resort, we never ran out of fun things to see and do ! Oh, and don't forget to rent one of the "family bikes" as we called them so that you can cruise the entire resort and see all that it has to offer ! There are beautiful pools and playgrounds all over the resort, not to mention that its within walking distance of "Downtown Disney". If you have the time, the SSR Spa comes highly recommended and there are pkgs for any one on any budget ! Anyway, I am giving this resort the thumbs up ! It was relaxing and fun and was truly a place to call "Home" and I for one will certainly be "going back home" when we visit next spring !!! I Hope this was helpful, Anecia from TN P.S. I have so many beautiful picks of the resort, but haven't had a minute to upload them since we got home! I will be sure to ad pics next time ! In the meanwhile, check out the resorts website, the pics depict exactly what you will find when you get there!

<Title>“Great stay overall”
<Content>We came back on August 2nd after a week at Saratoga Springs. Overall it was wonderful. I stayed there with my two children and my husband. We stayed in a studio with a beautiful view of the golf course, although it is very small, but we did not actually stay in the room much anyway. Pros: the grounds are beautiful, the bus service and the ferry service were excellent, the food and service at the Artist's Palette and gift shop was great, the air conditioning divine, the pool was loads of fun Cons: the toiletries they gave us were not nearly enough (one tiny shampoo, conditioner, body wash to last the whole week!! for a family of four) and when I needed help from the front desk when we had a disaster with the rental car, they were not helpful at all. Disney Express was disappointing when our plane arrived at 8pm, but our bags arrived at 1 in the morning!!

<Title>“loved it cant wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!”
<Content>We stayed at SSR last sept - i know this is a late review but i wrote a long report on retun and computr crashed and i never got round to retyping, well now we are getting ready to return to SSR and i thought i would do a quick report as im SO suprised to see SSR so low down the ratings..... Well we stayed to Grandstand which on reflection was perfect for us, i had wanted the area near DTD for the view but now hoping we get grandstand again this year, loved the 5 mins walk (if that) to main pool.. LOVED the fact we had our own pool bar which had drinks and sandwiches will really miss that this year if in a different area :-( When we got to our room i went straight onto the balcony and i was a bit disappointed with our view, look straight over the parking lot with the golf course to 1 side HOWEVER it turn out to be a fab view on a nightime we could see the fireworks and all the park going off ...YEAH!! Staff were really friendly called for extra clothes hangers which were delivered very quickly although it took a while for the CM to understand what i wanted LOL.... 1st night we ate at turf club - both me and partner got steak would have been lovely but had blue cheese and balsamic port glaze all over it which was gross, i know we ordered it our fault just didnt release... partner said wouldnt go back however on the 2nd week we decided to give it another go... FANTASTIC me prtner and son all had crab cakes mmmm!! i had salmon partner and son both had pasta with chicken again lovely and then i had lava cake MMMMMMM partner had apple pie MMMMM son wanted to wait to go to artist pallette for cookie, we enjoyed so much we even went back for our last night meal there..... again GREAT and our server for the 2nd and 3rd visit was the same girl she remembered us my son had ordered his checken pasta plain and she remebered when he ordered it on the 3rd visit which he thought was really cool.....my son was 12 and not really into the entertainment but he enjoyed the pool and pool table at the turf club lounge and also tennis. Room was clean and tidy, didnt use buses so cant comment..CANT wait to go back in a few weeks time..... we bought dvc while we were there...:-)

<Title>“Great Accomodations - Overwhelming Experience”
<Content>We stayed at the resort in the Grandstand buildings and loved it. The 2 BR Villa was very large and super nice. The pools were awesome, the housekeeping was great. These Villa's are very plush. On the downside, Saratoga Springs is a pretty good distance from many of the Parks. Of course if you are opposed to waiting in line and traveling long distances in the heat, Disney is probably not your cup of tea anyway.

<Title>“Saratoga Springs - Brilliant.”
<Content>We had a fantastic stay at Saratoga springs and cant wait to visit again.Our room was great,we stayed in the springs area which was convenient for the pool and restaurant areas.As we had a baby with us we requested a kettle and blender and these were delivered within the hour.Kids loved the pool and slide and especially enjoyed taking the water taxi to downtown disney. The only negative i can think of is that a stay in the congress park area may be a little far away from the pool and the expensive restaurant (turf club) wasnt too good. Overall it was great.

<Title>“Loved the Saratoga Springs Resort”
<Content>I'm so surprised to read such negative reviews because we could not have been happier with our stay at the SSR. We stayed in a 'Studio' which had one bed and fold-out sleeper sofa. Our room was spotless and very comfortable, but it was not a large room when occupied by 4 people. Our two young daughters slept on the sofa bed and said it was comfortable. Honestly, we didn't spend alot of time in our room (I mean, this is Disney!), but after a long day at the parks we slept very comfortably here. The kitchenette area was very nice with everything we needed to keep/make snacks in the room. The balcony overlooked the water and we loved feeding the ducks that would run over whenever we went out there to enjoy the pretty water view. We found the grounds to be beautiful, clean, and did not have any problems getting around the resort. But these Disney resorts can be large - you will have to walk. If that's a problem, then consider a different resort/hotel. We thought the main pool was terrific with it's faux stone & waterfall, creating a pleasant grotto feel, and our girls loved the waterslide. The lifeguards were attentive and there were pool games led by a cast member that kept the kids happily occupied while we enjoyed relaxing with drinks from the poolside bar. The cafeteria style restaurant was clean with typical Disney breakfast fare and we found the staff there to be nice, though admittedly a tad slow (but I'm a New Yorker so 'slow' is a relative term). One of my absolute favorite things about this resort was the water taxi to Downtown Disney. It was so convenient, and such a pleasant way to get somewhere after the hustle-bustle and crowds on the busses. With DD just across the waterway we had tons of dinner options and the water taxi was such a relaxing trip. The only negative thing I can possibly say about Saratoga Springs is to agree with some other posts that the waits for the bus could get very long (upwards of 40 minutes). If you are planning to use the bus to get to a dinner reservation at a park or another resort, you may need 1-1 1/2 hours to get there (no kidding). But even knowing that now, I would still definitely return to SS and stay there again. Overall I thought our stay there was terrific.

<Title>“Okay, but could use a few extras”
<Content>Hello, We are DVC members, mostly staying at OKW. Having decided to take a 8 day Disney trip, my daughter and I stayed in a studio with our DVC points. We requested ( and got ) the Grandstand section. First the good points: 1) Grandstand is where the buses come first in the resort, and they were 15 minutes or less EVERY DAY. 2) The quiet pool was fantastic. 3)The boat transport was great to DTD, except for one crabby boat captain. Now the negatives: 1) The biggest disappointment was the the sleeper sofa in the studio ( hard as a rock ). Any other deluxe place has TWO beds in a room, why can't Disney? 2) The room itself was okay, however not up to Disney standards. Boat was okay, buses were great, room below average, and pools were good....That about sums up our trip....Would rather go back to OKW....IMHO...

<Title>“Great place, Just know what you are getting!”
<Content>Just returned from a "magical" week at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa. My family loved it. There were six of us and we were very comfortable in a 2 bedroom villa. But....as you have probably read from the other posts, you are far from the parks, so if you don't have a vehicle, you could be miserable. I think I would have been. We had a vehicle and it was worth every extra penny I spent. We were at the parks on time when they opened, able to leave and get back quickly when they closed. I would recommend a GPS, it came in handy. More food options might be good, but, we were so busy at other places that we were not around SS to eat. So, I guess if all you did was "hang out" at the resort everyday, then you would be limited on food options. The pool was nice, the grounds were clean, and the maid service was good. I also liked the feeling of being "away" from the parks, it allows a break or a respite from the busyness and heavy traffic. Saratoga Springs was a great place and I would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“First DVC Christmas!”
<Content>Our stay at Saratoga Springs Resort was with family. We were in a two bedroom suite and with a total of six people, there was plenty of room. We never felt like we were on top of one another and we had a beautiful view of the golf course. We were in one of the newer buildings and the suite appeared to be untouched. The resort grounds are spread out but walking throughout the property was very pleasant. As can be expected with Disney resorts, the theming was top notch and the pool and clubhouse were inviting. We had a great lunch at the Turf Club Bar and were able to walk to Downtown Disney from the far end of the resort. We utilized the hot tub at the quiet pool, but the main pool offers a movie night which looked like a good time. Definitely a Disney caliber resort.

<Title>“Great stay!”
<Content>We spent 5 nights here in May and had a fabuous time. We stayed in a studio in the Grandstand area. The room was clean and comfortable and plenty spacious for myhusband and myself. There is a kitchenette with a small fridge and microwave. We drive over to Publix before turning in our rental car and got some water, sode, snacks, and breakfast items for our room. The grounds were wonderful. The pool in this area was great and had a great play area for kids. The main pool was nice too, but we spent most of our pool time in the Grandstands pool since there were always less people and it was closer. The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. Overall we had a great stay and our trip was very enjoyable.

<Title>“Stay away from the springs.”
<Content>While Saratoga Springs Resort is nice from the outside that is where the niceness ends. We stayed in a grand villa paid for with money not DVC points. The room was clean when we arrived but the maid service cleaned very poorly the rest of the time. We even bagged trash and they just left it sit in our room. The buses were horrible and the complex is hard to get around. We had one member of our party become ill and the front desk would not do a thing. They will not budge at all. To order food outside Disney, they will only allow you to pick it up at the front desk claiming they cannot drop it off at your room. The grocery at S.S.R. is ridiculous offering almost no healthy choices and very little choice at all. Overall, I would never stay here again. I would rather stay at the cheap resorts in Disney than this one. I also think that the quality of Disney has gone down over the years. It is an overpriced park offering nothing.

<Title>“Home Away From Home”
<Content>Saratoga Springs is our home resort. We absolutely LOVE SSR! We love the idea of being closer to Downtown Disney. Also, hubby takes advantage of the awesome golf packages and I thoroughly enjoy the spa. If you can afford it, we would recommend getting either the 1-bedroom or 2-bedroom villa...the master bath is to die for! And the extra living area is nice too. Although I'm not a big fan normally of doing laundry on vacation....it is VERY nice being able to wash our clothes before going home...just have to unpack. Also, having a washer/dryer means not having to pack as many clothes...any space I can save in my suitcase for souveniers the better!

<Title>“above average”
<Content>1st of all I must comment on how extrordinary the 2 bedroom villa we stayed in was.The room itself was clean and neat and plenty of space for 6 people.Having a bathroom in each bedroom was nice for getting showered and dressed etc.Our view from the balcony looked over the lake with a fountain and was great for early morning coffee and late night relaxing.Staff was very friendly.This is our home DVC resort and we paid a lot of money,so I feel that we can be crtical if some things are less than excellent.So here are a few things that we were dissapointed in.1-The main pool is great to look at and the slide is nice for the kids-but in the entire pool section the deepest part I believe was around 4 feet or less.My 15 year old lost interest quickly and I must admit it seemed a little kiddyish for such a big resort.2-The menu at the food area was very limited-maybe personal preference,but again,other resort stays I think have a better menu and food court in general.3-The biggest was the buses.We were here in June so I believe we need to realize how busy of a season it is(our 8th time in Disney).We are not novices on the system and I don't think our expectations are too high.We waited up to 45 minutes for the bus and it seemed like everyday at the bustop someone was furious about how long they had been waiting.This really put a down side to the beginning of your magical day at times.Plus at the Springs-we were the last stop of 5 and sitting on the bus was a luxury we grew to not expect.We did complain a bit and the front desk gave us a Fast Pass to use once anywhere in the parks which was a nice gesture,but overall for the amount paid the buses really need to be better.Overall,our family enjoyed our stay and would certainly count it as a success-hopefully they fix their poor bus situation.

<Title>“Great for a big family getaway”
<Content>We stayed in a studio while the rest of our group was in the next-door two-bedroom unit. We had an ideal stay, from our requested view being granted to our complete satisfaction with our rooms. The pools were great whether we went to the quiet pool just outside our building or took the five-minute walk to the big pool with the slide. It was around a five-minute walk to the food court and main building - not bad at all. We were in Congress Park so it was around the same walk to Downtown Disney Marketplace and the food options there. The walk to the rest of the Downtown Disney areas were a bit more lengthy - maybe 10 to 15 minutes - but not bad for dinner. Our bus waits weren't bad at all for most of the week, with the exception of one 40-minute wait for an Epcot bus. From the parks though, we had very short waits. The room was very nicely equipped. Our studio had paper goods and cups for use with our sink and microwave while the two-bedroom unit was fully stocked with everything we needed for the week. The living room of the two-bedroom unit was our base for the week and it didn't fail to handle our large and somewhat disorganized group! We can't wait to go back to Saratoga Springs. My husband and I have been before, but the other family members were there for the first time and are already trying to book the next trip. You can't go wrong with any of the Disney resorts, but the proximity to Downtown Disney really gives Saratoga Springs the edge.

<Title>“We enjoyed our stay!”
<Content>We have stayed a few times at Disney Saratoga Springs & have enjoyed all of the stays. The resort is spread out & I would not recommend this resort if you do not have a vehicle. I also would not recommend this resort if you are looking for major Disney theming & a high paced action area. Yes, there are issues with the bus system & the small eating facility for such a large resort. If you are looking for a relaxed, beautiful grounds right accross from Downtown Disney then this is the place. I look forward to coming back to this resort after a long busy day at the parks. I also would not have a problem staying at this resort & not going to any of the amusement parks but just enjoying the resort itself. It is like you are away from it all but still right in the middle of WDW.

<Title>“Thats not very Disney!”
<Content>We are DVC members & this was our second visit, we had a wonderful time overall with no problems with check in - we got our special request - sent by e mail on original booking request, which was super and much apprieciated. The facilities are wonderful a bit diffucult for us English not used to American equipment with no instructions we have never managed to work the grill on the oven! I agree with others the eating facilities on site are limited & the number of people trying to get served large but we had no problems staff were polite but not as friendly as we have known in the past indeed this could be said of most of the parks etc. It would be a good idea to have a least a mobile icecream trolley around the pools in the park as the distance is too great from the outer pools to get one from the club house. The cleaning was good but not spotless- even on full housekeeping days the crumbs were left. Some more sun shades around the pools would also be a good idea as these were always in demand.

<Title>“I don't get the hype”
<Content>We were looking forward to staying here because of all the positive reviews and the brochure. What a disappointment. Disney picked up our luggage from the terminal and sent it to a room but not ours. We caled the front desk to be told that it was in the foyer. We looked again, no luggage. They found out that the bell person delivered it somewhere else even though we specified the room because we initially changed rooms because we were placed in a room with a view of the parking lot. It was a looong walk to the main desk from our congress park hotel room and we actually took a bus to get to the pool if our blistery, tired feet coudn't handle it at the end of a park day. That was when the bus came. It was repeatedly about every 40 minutes or so even though the cast members always told us that they come every 20 minutes. Then we finally found out that there is a new gps system on the bus routes and they are 'working out the kinks'. Get to the buses early if you want to get to a park when it opens!! Many other guests were complaining too. So the hotel is too spread out. The decor is nice but nothing that stands out. The layout of the rooms are really strange. The first night I wound up in the closet, knocking over the ironing board on my way to the toilet. Bring a nightlight! Seriously, check out the layout of the bathroom and its odd shape/3 doors. The good thing is that every time you complain they give you a fast pass. We had so many that we couldn't use them all so we wound up giving them away in the parks! We are really looking forward to the Animal Kingdom Lodge next time.

<Title>“Great location, nice rooms”
<Content>We booked this resort though Disney Vacation points during the memoral hoilday's. We are glad we were able to use points, due to the nightly rate at this location being very high. Check in went very well, with our Castmember providing us with some great tips for picking up the bus system. We stayed in a studio (room 5412) in Progress park. Room was very spacious with a mini fridge and microwave and wet bar. The bath was an average hotel size, nice space at the outside sink area with a standard tub and commode in a separate room. This was nice as I would continue to get ready while hubby was taking shower etc. After reading reviews of bus waits I was expecting terrible lengths, but we must of had luck with us because we waiting no more than 10 minutes at any given time. We had all intentions of accomplishing Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom and MGM, but only got to MK due to other persuits. If hitting the parks I would recommend visiting touringplans.com. We used thier itinerary while at MK and followed it to a tee. We walked right on to alot of rides and had not more than a 20 minute wait at some of the more popular rides (haunted mansion) The resort is within walking distance of Downtown Disney, but it's not a short walk and a little confusing making your way there. We only walked there one evening for dinner at the Rainforest Cafe. Note: no reservations available at this restaurant and it's quite busy. Since there were only 2 of us we quickly got seats at the bar. I would suggest taking the water taxi (shuts down at 11pm) bus system or a cab from the front of the resort. It's much quicker and will get you there. I would definately recommend the House of Blues Gospel Brunch on Sundays at Downtown Disney. It was a fantastic show and the food, which consisted of breakfast items as well as (southern) lunch was equally as tasty. I can't say enough. This is very popular so I purchased tickets early, which granted us a great seats in the "pit". There is a 10:30am and 1pm shows, but get there early. I suggest having someone in your party stand in the will call line and another in your party standing in the restaurant line. Both lines get long fast so make sure you are there at least 15 to 20min before the show starts. Since we purchased tickets with the "and more" feature we also visited Disney Quest. This is really just a large video arcade. Both hubby and I didn't do well with the virtual reality games, it made us queasy. So we made our way through each floor then headed off. Start at the ground floor then use the elevators or stairs to make your way up. I could see where this place is fun for kids and although I love video games it was really too loud for us. Maybe we are getting to old!! :-) The resort was very quite, we had no issues with loud families. Although I think folks should be more considerate with thier strollers on the buses. But we didn't use the pools or restaurant on the property. There is a supermarket and restaurants out the back entrance of the property. The market is open 24 hours which is nice for late night ice cream runs. This is a great location for familys that need a little more space to spread out. We had a great time and will be heading back to use the rest of our tickets in the coming months.

<Title>“Wonderful Stay at the Saratoga Springs”
<Content>My husband, my three children (9, 8, and 5 at the time), and I started our vacation at the Pop Century. We normally stay at the Grand Floridian but had decided to try an Economy Resort for fun. Well that was a bad idea for us. After one night we asked to be transferred to a Luxury Resort. I'm sorry to say we think we've become hotel snobs. The Saratoga had what was essentially a two bedroom condo for us. We had never stayed there before but we just loved it. It was impeccably decorated, very clean, and very easy to get around. The pool was great for our kids and not at all over crowded. The restaurants were excellent too. I would defiantly be willing to stay there again. It was worth every penny.

<Title>“Superb resort”
<Content>Stayed at Saratoga Springs with the wife and two kids (ages 4 & 2) for 6 days in May and it was wonderful. We had the studio apartment in the Congress Park area. The room is bigger than a room at a moderate Disney resort, but that doesn't include the bathroom, hallway and mini-kitchen which add a lot more space to the Studio. Plus you get a balcony. We were on the third floor with a fabulous view of Downtown Disney. I saw the 1 bedroom and it was huge. The resort has a lot of amenities, with a Spa onsite, as well as a large pool with a large slide and small slide for the little ones. There's no kiddie pool, instead there's a spinkler with a Donald Duck about the size of a 2 year-old, its very cute. The resort is also very beautiful, but large and walks to the main building/pool can take 10-15 minutes. You can also rent bikes for kids and adults. There was alot to do and we barely stractched the surface with going to the parks everyday. The service was great, but unless you rent the room the maid only cleans the room once during the week. We stayed on Disney vacation club points, and so didn't get cleaning daily, but on the other hand I only hand $110 a night which was a steal. The bus service was so-so, but the food court and onsite shopping were awful. Expect to either cook your own food here or go to another resort's food court to eat. Other than that the resort was superb.

<Title>“Very Nice Resort. Definitely a Pleasant Surprise!”
<Content>My husband and I have stayed at this resort 3 times, with our most recent stay in Dec. 2007. We ended up staying there for the first time in May 2007. We weren't too thrilled about the idea of staying there since we had read it wasn't as themed as other Disney resorts, but all of the other deluxe resort villas seemed to be booked. We were more than pleasantly surprised! The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rooms were very, very clean and the furnishings seemed new. Housekeeping left us "towel art" of ducks in our room, which was a very nice touch. We paid for a regular view, but were put in a studio villa that faced a lake that leads to Downtown Disney. It was very pretty seeing Downtown Disney all lit up at night from our room. It was also nice to be able to walk there from our room in just a few minutes. The whole resort is pleasant and classy. The grounds are pretty and very well-kept. The pool is a very good size and is quite nice. Playing bingo by the pool with a cold drink from the pool bar was enjoyable. The quick service eatery, The Artist's Palette, is probably the best quick service I've tried at Walt Disney World. The food is sitdown restaurant quality at a lesser price and is fast. The Turf Club, the resort's sitdown table-service restaurant, has amazing food. I'd reccommend their Angus-chuck burger, onion rings, and blackberry lemonade in particular! The resort does have a nice arcade and a spa, too. We did not go to the spa, however. One of the great things about this resort is that it's very large and thus not seemingly crowded. Of all of the resorts I've stayed at at Walt Disney World, this one is definitely the most peaceful. We have never had a problem with noisy kids or anything at Saratoga Springs. We usually feel like we're the only couple in the whole resort when we stay. I think the rooms must have great soundproof walls because we never heard our neighbors. The only possible negatives about this resort is that it can be a long trip to some of the theme parks, and the resort is quite large so you may be in a building that is far from the lobby/shop/restaurants or from the bus stops. If you're renting a car, it'll be a snap, though. It's right next to Downtown Disney, as I've said, and that's a plus for some people. Also, the resort does not offer room service, so that can be a little inconvenient for some people. I do wish the resort was more themed. There are statues of horses here and there, but mostly it's pretty plain. It is beautiful though-- don't get me wrong. Just not as themed for a deluxe Disney resort. Kids or people really wanting a "Disney character" feel might be disappointed. Adults and teens will most likely appreciate the victorian surroundings. My husband and I will definitely be staying here again. We're planning on going back in Oct. 2008 and in Dec. 2008.

<Title>“overall 'nice' but missed details”
<Content>We are three with a daughter 3.5 years old. We chose the Disney Saratoga Springs Resort (DSSR) somewhat at the last minute and were only interested in a 2-BR villa as my parents were going to be staying with us. By the time we booked, the DSSR was one of the last 2-BR villa resorts available. We read the TripAdvisor site and most bloggers said they enjoyed the DSSR as it was one of the newest ones on Disney Property. Why I gave it a 2-star rating. Essentially this reflects what I believe a poor value for the dollar. You are staying at a high end Disney resort and for this money I expect nearly everything to be perfect. My step-mom is a long time Disney fan and has spent time all over the park for the last 20 years. Even she was disappointed in the quality. The good and the bad: 1. Checkin – great staff and friendly people. All willing to help and quick with a smile. Our flight arrived from EWR to MCO at 1030 and even though checkin isn’t officially until 1600, we were in our room by noon. 2. Room: All seemed in order but on closer inspection the bathrooms were not quite up to par. My step-mom is a self-proclaimed Ms Diznee and has stayed extensively at multiple Diznee resorts for the last 20 years. She even commented that the room wasn’t upto normal Diznee standards for cleanliness. While generally clean and new, the room was not completely serviced (stocked with soaps and toiletries) when we checked in. Also noticed the bathrooms (both) appeared to be quickly cleaned up, but not the usual Disney quality that most have come to expect (i.e. hair on floor and toothpaste gobs on one of the curio shelves in the Master Bath). Since we were an early check in, it is possible that the maid-staff hadn’t completed their Quality Control check. Tough to tell. 3. Carpet in villa noticeably worn in the traffic pattern areas. 4. Landscaping and common grounds absolutely manicured and post card perfect. 5. Main Pool w/water slide – this was the only pool we visited all week. For the most part we liked it and I couldn’t get my 3 year old off the big slide. She loved it. We did notice the table and chairs area weren’t as well kept as they should have been (Tues AM: found torn up, half used, ketchup wrappers under table and a moderate level of grime on the table top from the day prior. Wed: again, grimy table and half of a broken up blueberry muffin under the table). For $500+/nite the pool deck and accessories should be spotless. a. Note: Waterslides not operational until Life Guards on duty – 10AM b. Very family friendly pool with a beach-style shallow water entrance and Donald Duck sprinkler pad that has water squirting up from the ground. c. Pool water extremely comfortable even for my wife the freeze baby – I would say 80-85 degrees F. Quite nice. d. Showers in both the men’s and women’s bathrooms are a nice feature, unfortunately, both were out of soap. While not a big deal, for this level of resort, I shouldn’t have to go around asking for someone to refill the dispensers. Know what I mean? 6. Great fitness center and spa. If you have the chance to take advantage of this facility I don’t think you’ll be disappointed. This was my first time at a Disney resort. I have extensive “road warrior” experience at all different levels of hotels and generally feel DSSR had a few mis-steps that you wouldn’t normally encounter at comparable high priced hotels/resorts. I am 50-50 as to whether I would return to DSSR. Seems they got most of the big things right but missed some important details.

<Title>“Saratoga Springs is A+++, but not very "Disney" for young ones”
<Content>We just returned from a 4 night stay at Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa .The hotel, grounds and all facilities are beautiful and very well maintained. The staff also was very friendly and helpful. My only negative comment is that it does not seem like you are at Disney. There is not a strong "theme" at this hotel and it was slightly disappointing to us. Some people may enjoy Saratoga Springs for this exact reason. We have 2 young children and would have preferred more a a Disney flair. We could have just as easily been at any luxury hotel in the area and would have seen no difference. My recommendation for anyone traveling with children is to pick a different hotel if you want a Disney experience,

<Title>“LOVED IT”
<Content>We stayed at the Saratoga Springs WDW in May 2008 with our 3 year old and 3 month old. It was wonderful! We rented points from a Disney Vacation Club Member who couldn't use them. We rented in the middle of the week, which is much cheaper. There is also NO tax as it is a person-to-person transaction. We paid $130/night for a studio room that goes for twice as much. The room was clean. The pool by the carriage house was SPECTACULAR! It was a quiet hotel away from the hustle and bustle which is nice after a LONG day at the theme parks. We rented a car so we returned every afternoon for a swim and nap, which is essential if you have children! The resort grounds are large and picturesque. The furnishings are all high end (all hardwoods) and there are granite counter tops. There was only one double bed and one sofa bed (which was surprisingly comfortable and firm). Definitely recommend this one.

<Title>“Very disapointed would not return”
<Content>My husband and I are DVC members and were really looking forward to staying at our homebase resort. When we arrived , the front desk personnel could not be more pleasant however that is where it stopped. Our room, which was a studio, was in the Congress Park area. The room was extremely cramped much more so than an oridinary hotel room. The room was clean but you could certainly tell that the person that cleaned the room did not go out of their way at all, only the very basics were done. We were fortunate however that our room was not too far from the bus stop. Many other buildings are not as close. The complex is huge and I really think that because of the size you really miss out on all the amenities that the complex may have. Fortunately for us we did have a car so we could ride back and forth to the Carriage House which is the main builiding for anything that you have to do within the complex. We ate 1 breakfast and 2 lunches in the Artist Palette. I cannot believe that for the size of this complex this is the only area to eat, it is way too small, the lines are long and the staff are rude. We were on the Disney dining plan, my husband is diabetic, he asked to exchange a juice for a piece of fruit and was told no he could not have a bottle of water instead. The staff behind the counter did nothing but complain about thier break schedule. Needless to say these are only some of the highlights of our trip we certainly will return to this hotel. I am a very disapointed DVC member.

<Title>“Great resort and natural setting. Poor bell service and bus service.”
<Content>SUMMARY: Overall, we had a great one-week vacation staying in a 3-bedroom grand villa at Saratoga Springs. We were 6 adults and two kids, and the 3-bdrm villa was very comfortable and spacious for us. We could have had a couple more people with us, and we would have been fine. But they advertise a 12-person max for this type of room, and 12 would have been a bit too much. We had huge windows overlooking the beautiful lake and Downtown Disney from all the rooms, high ceilings in the family room, a dining room big enough for everyone, a kitchenette with all the utensils we needed, a dishwasher, a fridge, a stove, a laundry with supplied detergent. It really did feel like home for the week we were there, and we'd even find ourselves saying things like "alright kids, time to head home" at the end of the day spent at the theme parks. The service, including cleaning, was great overall. SIZE OF PROPERTY: A lot of people complain about the fact that Saratoga Springs is such a huge sprawling place that it takes 15 minutes to walk from your room to the central registration/lobby/dining/pool area. Well, that's true I suppose, but for me that was part of the charm. By making the place so spread out with many separate buildings, guests are living in a more natural setting, with trees and walkways and landscaping surrounding every building, and each building having only 4 floors and holding about 50 rooms total. Feels more like home. Contrast that to a mega-Hilton-like-tower with 100 floors and 2000 rooms, where you never have to step outside to get from one place to another ... just take the elevator. It all depends on your personal preference I suppose, but I really liked the Saratoga setting. Besides, each of the five different sections of Saratoga Springs has their own swimming pool and their own bus stop, so you very rarely ever need to go to the central registration area anyway. In the entire time I was there, I was only at the central area 4 times -- once when we first arrived and checked-in after which bell services gave us a golf-cart ride to our room, once to buy a couple of groceries at the Artist Palette (I walked), once to visit the larger main swimming pool (we walked), and once at the end of our stay to catch the Magical Express to the airport (bell services gave us a ride in their golf-cart). But really, you can get away without ever needing to walk to the lobby, and nearly all questions or other needs can be taken care of over the phone. And the auxiliary pools, though smaller and without water slides, are just as nice and less crowded. THEME PARK BUS SERVICE: The bus service to the theme parks was mostly great, but spotty a couple of times. They advertise that the buses run every 20 minutes, so theoretically your max wait time should be 20 minutes. We used the bus *a lot*. We had different people in our group coming and going at different times, and we'd also frequently make two separate trips to the theme park in the same day (coming back to our room mid-day for a nap). Most of the time, I think we got really lucky and waited 0-10 minutes for the bus to arrive. But over the course of the week, there were a few cases where people in our party had to wait more than 30 minutes for the bus to show up, which was frustrating. In any given roundtrip from your room to a theme park, there are a total of 6 stops on the route -- one at the theme park itself, and one at each of the 5 different sections of Saratoga Springs. But each stop takes just a couple minutes max. The bus ride itself lasts about 20 minutes for Magic Kingdom, and 10-15 minutes to the other parks. In total, plan on needing about 35 minutes on average to get from your room to the theme park, or vice-versa. And in some rare cases, recognize that it could take up to 50 minutes. If you factor this into your planning, you won't be disappointed with the bus service. Some of the newer buses, with their wider doors and wider aisles, are more stroller-friendly than the older buses, but you never know which kind of bus you're going to get. If you have an small umbrella stroller, it's no problem at all. If you have a larger stroller that doesn't collapse as compactly (like us), then it's definitely trickier and you need a dedicated person (someone who can lift the stroller completely over his head if necessary) to deal with the stroller and nothing else. And sometimes those buses get packed to the limit, where even the aisles are completely full with standing people. In that case, a large stroller is going to use up as much space as one person would, but that's okay. Lots of people like us do take their larger strollers for comfort reasons (they recline, and have sunshades, storage baskets, and trays, etc.), and so you'll never be the only one on the bus with a large stroller. We don't regret our decision to take our large stroller with us everywhere we went; it was a lifesaver. MAGICAL EXPRESS: The Disney's Magical Express service is not quite as magical as it sounds, and I'm convinced nobody would use it if it weren't for the fact that it's free. When we arrived in Orlando after our very long journey, we waited 20 minutes for the bus to arrive, then they loaded us onto the bus where we waited another 30 minutes just sitting there, and then it was a 30-minute ride to Saratoga Springs including a stop at another resort along the way. (I'd hate to be one of those families staying in a resort located at the end of the route ... that would suck having to sit through stops at all the other resorts.) Our suitcases didn't arrive at our room until six hours later, although I don't know if that was our airline's fault or Disney's fault. At the end of your stay, they make you board the bus a full 3 hours before your flight time, and if you want to check your luggage and get your boarding passes directly at Saratoga Springs rather than hauling your luggage to the airport yourself and checking in there, then you had better get to the main desk at least 3.5 hours before flight time. For folks with early flights, this can be a real pain. Which leads me to the bell service ... BELL SERVICE We had way more trouble than I expected with the bell service on the way out. Firstly, you have to call and schedule the bell service to come pick up your luggage a full 24 hours before the scheduled pick-up time. (I guess that's a side-effect of the property being so sprawling.) But we didn't know about that, so we called a mere 12 hours before scheduled departure time (good thing we called in advance at all ... I'm accustomed to being able to just call them up right when you need them), and were told that bell services were booked up at our desired time, so we had to settle for even earlier checkout time than we had planned for (so now, some people in our party are scheduled to leave the room *4* hours before flight time). Even with that advance reservation, bell services didn't show up, and after 15 minutes had gone by, I called to find out what's going on and the dispatcher was confused as to why nobody had shown up yet, and she said she would send somebody out right away. Five minutes later, somebody showed up. Okay fine, I can forgive one screw-up. But then, the second group of people in our room, who had a different flight schedule and a separate reservation for bell services, had the same problem! Bell services again just didn't show up at the scheduled time! I called up and the same dispatcher woman was like "Um, I thought we already picked up your luggage an hour ago". I politely explained that that was for a different group of people, and that we had clearly made 3 separate bell services reservations the day before. "Oh, okay, sorry about that, we'll send someone out right away.". Sheesh, I expected better than this. Because of the bell services screw-up, we didn't have time to check our luggage and get boarding passes at the resort itself, and we almost even missed the bus entirely. GROCERIES: This isn't really a Saratoga-specific issue ... it's more of a Disney-wide issue. If you have a room with a kitchenette, it's definitely in your interest to have breakfast and possibly even some light meals or snacks in your room. It saves time and money, and is less stressful than eating out all the time, especially with a bigger group. The problem is that there are zero good options for getting groceries if you don't have access to a car, and I think we looked at all the available options. * GardenGrocer.com offers grocery delivery to Disney resorts for a small fee, but the folks there are unreliable and unresponsive and have no customer service values whatsoever, so I couldn't get the answers I needed in order to be able to use this service. * Goodings supermarket has a web site (http://Shop.goodings.com) where you can supposedly place an order for groceries to be delivered. But it is by far the worst designed web site that I've ever used in my life, and so horribly slow that it would take literally a whole day just to navigate the web site to get your grocery order in place. * Albertson's. You can fax in a grocery order to Albertson's (on Orange Blossom Trail) in advance, they'll do the shopping for you and pack it up, and then you pick it up on the way from Orlando airport to Saratoga. But Albertson's is half-way between the airport and the resort, and now the problem is that you can't use the free Disney Magical Express bus service. So you have to shell out $60+ for a cab or a limo ride. We went with this option, as it seemed the best one at the time. Just my luck though, Albertson's screwed up our order and gave us only half of the groceries we had ordered, and we didn't realize it until we got to our room. All that money for the limo ride for nothing. When I called, the rep at Albertson's said she didn't know how that might have happened. Great, thanks a lot. * After you get to your room, shop yourself at the nearest Goodings Supermarket, Winn-Dixie Supermarket, or Publix supermarket. Based on our experience, I think this is the best option. You'll pay $10-$15 each way for a cab ride, but that's not too bad. Goodings is the closest to Saratoga, but not close enough to be walkable, and don't let anybody else tell you otherwise. (We were told by someone that it was "easily walkable", so we tried to walk it after realizing that our Albertson's order was half-missing, and it took us an hour to get there, and my legs were jelly.) However, I also believe that Goodings has less selection and more expensive groceries (maybe 20% higher) than the other supermarkets, especially when compared to Albertson's.

<Title>“Cleaning issues at the Saratoga Springs Resort”
<Content>We stayed in a two bedroom villa to sample the property with a view of buying into the vacation club. We are so glad we stayed on site prior to purchasing. The day before check in I visited the resort (I was staying at the Yacht Club for a couple days) to view a sample two bedroom and to request a location. I spent an hour on the property touring the grounds and villas. The next day when I went to check in - the clerk was cold and inpersonal - and told me that I could not stay in the villa that I had been shown the previous day. Eventually, after haggling, I spoke with the front desk manager and was able to stay in the Grandstand. However, I was told the villa wasn't ready and I could not get in until 4:00. They would call me when the villa was ready - Not. Finally, at 5:00 I called housekeeping and was told the condo was ready to occupy. An entire day wasted. When I got to the villa, it had not been cleaned properly - merely surface cleaned. There were crumbs on the table, bench, sticky counters, finger prints all over the sliding doors and coffee grounds inside the cabinet where the garbage was contained. I called housekeeping and they sent someone to my room 3 hours later without any cleaning supplies. She just wanted to "confirm" the room had not been cleaned properly. So I went to Walmart, purchased cleaning supplies with my groceries and cleaned myself. I left a $5.00 tip each morning with the hope of having a clean villa. This helped but some days they did not come to clean until after 3:00 pm. So we would come back to the room after visiting the parks, then come back for a nap only to find the room had not been cleaned. It was a continual hassle. Finally, on check out day I asked if we could check out at 3:00 instead of 11:00. The front desk said we could stay until 1:30 pm. I was finishing packing and the cleaning people knocked on the door. I told them I needed 10 - 15 more minutes. The cleaning "supervisor" than told me she would call security if I wasn't out of the room immediately. I was flabbergasted and told her I wasn't leaving the room without the rest of my belongings and would be out of the room shortly. I am so glad I didn't purchase a disney vacation club membership!

<Title>“Great Familt Resort”
<Content>What a fabulous resort! Located on Disney property in the Downtown Disney area, it feels more like a home away from home than a hotel. Our 1 bedroom was equipped with a washer and dryer, (a box of Tide was provided each day) full kitchen including dishwasher, a jacuzzi tub and shower. Large enough for our family of four. The cleaning service came daily. We also opted for the meal plan, which was incredible! Our children ages 4 & 5 ate a meal with Disney characters at least once per day. We also ate at some nice restaurants at the other hotels nearby. We have stayed at other Disney properties before, but this is our new favorite!

<Title>“Wonderful stay, one of Disney's best!”
<Content>I booked this through a DVC owner - we had a one bedroom suite. The suite itself was nothing really fancy - nice - clean and comfortable. The balcony overlooked Downtown Disney and was close to the pool. My daughter LOVED this resort. The pools are fabulous and the smaller pool by our room overlooking Downtown Disney was beautiful. They have rocking chairs by the river so that you can sit down and enjoy the nice evening breeze! The fitness center here is WONDERFUL - it rivals my gym back home - it was nice to have the comforts of home while traveling! We were on the dining plan so we ate at the Artists Pallate which was more than adequate for our needs. They offer biking - life jackets and they have a theatre on site (although I didn't use it) - this resort was simply top notch. We stayed here for two nights followed by Marriott's Cypress Harbor and this resort outshined the Cypress Harbor resort by a mile!! We loved it - the location was great - pools were great, staff was friendly and we had a great time. Highly recomend!!

<Title>“Worth the price????????”
<Content>This is the second year that we have stayed at Saratoga and I definately have to say it is way over price... Everything from the room rates to the gift shop, to the $10 charge a day for internet hook-up to the lousy food at the hotel restaurants. My family and I stayed there for a week over Spring Break in a two bedroom unit. We have 4 small children ranging in age from 5 months to 9. The room itself was nice and spacious. Cute decor, good size kitchen and family room. However, the bathrooms were filthy and there was hair (you know the kind) all over the bathroom floor in the second bedroom. It was disgusting! Did I complain, no but I should have. We had a nice view of the lake and I do agree with the other reviewers that the resort is very spread out. However, after a long winter in Northwest Indiana we didn't mind walking to the pool. We also walked everynight to Downtown Disney. But, if you don't like walking for 5 - 10 minutes than I suggest you request a room close to the main pool. The staff was polite and especially nice to the children. I even had help out to my car when carrying several packages by myself. No, they do not help with luggage though you can park right behind your room and it's not that far to carry it in yourself. The food is not good but most food at Disney is not good. I suggest eating at Epcot or Downtown Disney. Portobellos and Fultons are two of our favorites. Also, buy the $11 mug at the resort because it is nice for the free refills. As for the pool it is a nice size and fun for the kids. The staff play fun games with the kids in the afternoon and there is usually movies around the pool at night. I am not the complaining type but we did have a few nights of listening to unsupervised teenagers screaming and yelling above us. I didn't call but I should have. It went on for three nights before they stopped, I'm assuming someone else made the call. Overall, a very nice resort with beautiful grounds and a charming atmosphere but very expensive for what you get. But isn't that Disney...

<Title>“a bit disappointing for the price”
<Content>We spent just a day at the Saratoga recently before returning home from a beach vacation. We have vacationed off site previously and wanted to experience staying in a WDW hotel and see if the extra money spent was worth it. We booked directly on the Disney web site because we wanted to be sure that we would get a room with a king bed. Imagine our surprise when we walked in the room (after carrying our luggage ourselves – without being offered any help from a Bell hop, humph…) and realized it was a queen sized bed. We immediately called front desk and had an arduous conversation with someone who told us that king beds were not guaranteed (but on the web site, that is what you click on when selecting your room choice…). The lady on the phone was most unhelpful. My husband actually went down to front desk himself and finally, after much prodding, they were nice enough to offer a 1 bedroom apartment at no extra charge. The resort is VERY large and spread-out. Our unit was a long walk away from the common areas. I wouldn’t wish to stay here with young children; every time you leave the room to go to the pool or restaurant, it’s a trip! The resort is new and the room beautiful and very clean. The mattress on our bed had to be the most comfortable I had ever slept on! However, the pull out couch mattress was very thin and my teenage daughter mentioned she had been uncomfortable. The kitchen was fantastic and well equipped. We found the pool area very crowded and for such a vast resort, I would have expected a larger site or another pool. The hotel is well situated and it was convenient to take the boat launch to downtown Disney, a 5 minute trip from the hotel. We do however always take a car because we enjoy the convenience of not waiting for the buses that leave every 20 minutes for the various destinations. I am not sure that I would stay in a WDW resort again… For almost half the price, you can find similar accommodations off site very nearby. However, if you are going during a busy period, the extra hours for resort guests might make it worth the price.

<Title>“fantastic!!!!!!!!!”
<Content>well what can i say about saratoga springs.... the hotel is amazing. the lobby is very posh and all the staff are very friendly. The location of the resort is ok, very close to downtown disney, that were the night life is, but ther is free bus transportation to take you to any theme park or hotel. We stayed in the springs, that probably the closest block to the main pool. The main pool is a big and very clean area, but the pool water looks dirty!! its not its very clean bt it has a brown floor which makes it look a bit of a swamp like colour!! the other pool which is located in congress park, very nice that pool, looks over a lake and downtown disney, this is the quiet pool. the only problem with sitting at this pool is that you cannot get unlimited drinks only at the main pool. unlimited drinks, will tell you about them now. On you r arrival buy a platic mug, about $10. you can get unlimited refills in this cup, well worth the money, as for a diet coke on disney is probably about $3! the food in this hotel is average, nothing special. the ususal american food, chicken, burgers, waffles, sandwhices.... repetitive, but when we go we mainly eat out most nights. the staff are lovely, especially the lifeguards and recreation staff, they always say hi. any more questions feel free to msg me, i have been to america like 20 times, satyed on a couple of the disney hotels, i could be helpful!! you will enjoy this , so dont worry if you read bad reviews... TRUST ME!

<Title>“Nice but very spread out”
<Content>Being a DVC member we thought we would give the newest resort a try. There were pros & cons to this Disney resort. First, because it was brand new everything was beautiful. The resort (in typical Disney Style) was immaculate and the rooms were gorgeous. We had a very nice first floor room with a patio that overlooked a pond with a fountain. We stayed in a 1-bedroom unit which gives us the extra space we all need after spending hours in the parks and at the pool. Having a kitchenette to eat breakfast in is not only a cost saver, but a nice quick, healthy option. We were about 1/4 mile from the pool. Not a bad walk compared to many of the other units. The pool was fantastic, especially for the kids. The zero depth makes it especially kid friendly for the young ones and easy to keep an eye on them. The counter service restaurant was quick & convenient with an ever-changing menu that offered us a lot of options, rather than the standard hot dog & hamburger fare. Our complaint about this hotel (in comparison to others) was how large and spread out it was. We were always on buses crammed with other people from the hotel and multiple bus stops within one hotel is tiring. There are so many people that need buses that we often found ourselves waiting at the parks for quite a bit of time so several buses could haul all the people in line back to the hotel. If we ever stayed here again we would be very disappointed to stay in any of the units further from the main building. Other than this set back we found the hotel to be very nice and a great place to stay on the property of WDW.

<Title>“Saratoga Spring Break”
<Content>We just returned from Saratoga and have to say it is Beautiful. We had a 1 bedroom Lockout in the Congress section which is walking distance to Downtown Disney. You have to see Downtown Disney. It has everything there you would like to see. The rooms are very nice,a little small but well maintained. Our only complaint(suggestion) is NEVER! get a 1 bedroom lockout and have 4 kids(a group of 8 with 2 hotel room units) on Spring Break move in beside you. They should have just stayed with us in our unit as it sounded like they were in our Living Room most of the night. Security arrived at 3 am and 5 am to tell them to keep it down. We have 2 small children and these guys and girls were running in and out all night to other rooms, the pool you name it and every time the door slammed (they are VERY loud) the kids woke up. The Entrance Door in the Lockout is right beside yours and opens to the Kitchen area so it offers no noise barrier. We even had the Pizza Delivery guy knock on our door at 3 am because the kids could not hear him knock on their door. NO I was not amused by then. We paid a lot to be away from Spring break partying and thought Disney would be quiet family fun. This was not the place for teenagers to be partying we thought. We ended up moving after the 2nd night. Lockout units offer 0 noise barrier,TRUST ME! Saratoga Management gave warnings to the kids and said they would take action but we had to move to avoid the noise. We could not take another night. March Break in Disney World is VERY VERY busy and we booked Disney to avoid College kids on Spring break. We never expected it inside a Disney resort and the worse part was moving. The new unit had a broken AC unit and they gave our old room away before we even got out of it (those poor people). We came back from Animal Kingdom to find people in our room and we still had all our things in the room because we were told to move after we came from the park so the room would be ready for us to move into. Management messed up huge there. When we finally moved it was over 80 degrees in our new unit so it was tough to sleep again and they needed parts to fix the AC so it was well into the next day before it was fixed. Live and Learn. The resort is beautiful though and the buses are a great way to get around. You will wait no more than 15 or 20 minutes and saves you parking fees. The restaurant in the main building has good food but small. I have to say that I agree with most who say it is not the Disney Experience the Kids crave. You are far from the parks (cannot walk) and no animated friends so I would actually save the money and stay outside the gates next time and spend more on going out other places as well. It is just Not! very Disney....Save the money (it is VERY expensive ) and not a true Disney resort experience in our opinion because we knew we wanted to be in a Family resort away from Spring Breakers. It never happened. They found us. I do not think the other Disney Resorts would put up with this. Just an Note about our Week 2 at Daytona and how they deal with Spring break. We stayed at Ocean Walk (Daytona Beach) the next week and WOW! Most Kids were put in the North Tower and Most Familys in South Tower. It was Quiet in the units after 10pm and Security kept things in order. We were on the 18th as well so very Quiet. The kids partied full tilt but it was well controlled. Excellent job by Security,Police and Beach Patrol. I saw the beach Patrol in action when a kid went out too far. The rip currents can be deadly and I thought I was in Baywatch when the Lifeguard called in for help. A Hummer, 3 Atvs,2 trucks, and a boat were all on scene in less than 2 minutes and yes they wear red bathing suits. The kid swam in with 2 lifeguards and none the worse for wear. Great job......We felt very safe. It was a wonderful week on the beach. Beautiful 2 bedroom. NOOOOOOO Lockout. Daytona is Beautiful.

<Title>“truly magical”
<Content>The magic begins the second you get off the plane and walk up to the Disney magical express check-in desk. Everyone is friendly, professional and very helpful. The ride to the resort is about 20 minutes but feels like much less because the driver is giving you useful tips and a video of information is playing as well. Before you know it you are at the resort and if you plan your magical express ride a few weeks in advance you can do all this without worrying about your luggage at all. It will appear in your room later on that afternoon. Check-in took about 10 minutes but that was because I had a ton of questions to ask and we pre-paid for all of our meals and theme park tickets. I strongly advise the meal plan, we had the basic plan and it was plenty of food for the day at $38.00 per person per day. You get one counter service meal and one table service meal including entree, non-alcoholic beverage and dessert. You also get a snack which can be popcorn, a drink, ice cream or an assortment of things to choose from. The snack carts and restaurants all have a symbol next to things that count as a choice toward your meal credits so it is really easy to use. 2 adults for a week was only $530.00 and the food was really good...I have to admit I thought it would be just greasy burgers and soggy fries and I was pleasantly surprised by the choices that are available. The artists counter service restaurant @ Saratoga had salads, sandwiches, flatbread pizzas and tons of things to make in your room. One suggestion if you are a coffee person bring it with you and don't forget filters...they charge $5.00 per day for the coffee packets after the first one. The prices for the convenience items are inflated but try to think of everything u need on a regular basis ans just pack it...you can take half as much clothing as you need and do laundry halfway through the week. The in=room washer and dryers are luxurious...we had toasty warm towels after every shower! The kitchen is stocked with everything you can think of and we made coffee & breakfast every morning with the food we ordered from gardengrocer.com , it was a tip we saw on this site and it was perfect. $50 for a weeks worth of groceries and bottled water...I strongly recommend you order the bottled water at least as florida water id not award-winning...(sorry fl..). The fitness center was clean ans well-stocked the hoursare from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. so you have plenty of time to work aup a good sweat before or after the parks. The pools were beautiful and well maintained. Yes, the resort is pretty big but has really been exaggerated in some reviews. Although as a NYer I may think walking 1/4 of a mile to be perfect acceptable while others may not.. The grounds are beautiful and each area is not more that 5 minutes from the main bldgs. Downtown Disney is a very quick walk across the bridge from saratoga springs..it is quite a beautiful walk especially at dusk. Downtown disney is fun and exciting, tons of shopping, dining and people watching. There are 5 bus stops around the property to get the buses to all the parks and downtown disney, you can also take a water taxi or walk to downtown disney ( which I recommend, it will be much faster). The buses run about every 20-30 minutes and the rides are from 5-15 minutes depending on which park you are going to. Disney really makes it so easy to just have a worry and hassel free vacation. I was truly impressed. The parks really sell themselves so I am not going to say much about them but to suggest you get your personalized maps from disney with your points of interest marked off and deciding what your itinerary will be ahead of time...even if you are not a planner..have a loose itinerary r you could get carried away and never see a few things you really want to see. The maps are free just request them on disney's website. And everyone will ask you where you got them cause they are really attractive too. Really good restaurants I suggest are Planet Hollywood in Downtown Disney, wolfgang puck also in downtown disney westside, Sci-Fi Dine-In at Hollywood studios, san angel inn at the world showcase mexican pavillion in epcot , and the turf club at saratoga springs. In conclusion I wasn't sure what to expect but was blown away by disneys service, the helpfulness and friendliness of their cast members, the beautiful surroundings and disney's uncanny attention to detail. I strongly recommend this resort. Enjoy your stay.

<Title>“A Walk Disney World Vacation For Adults”
<Content>My stay at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort, last spring, was wonderful! A friend and I booked a week long stay at the resort, along with the disney express tickets, weeklong park hopper with add ons, and the disney dining plan. All of the above were well worth the money spent. Our room at S.S. overlooked a lake, as well as Downtown Disney. A small pool and hot tub were a moments walk from our door. I loved this, as it seems that most families with children went to the larger, themed pool, in the center of the property. You don't truly realize what lounging by the pool means, until you remove the hoards of screaming children. We also had the cutest little man tending to the pool. He would always greet us with a smiling hello, and ask us how we were doing. One day in particular, we had mixed some alcoholic drinks, poured them into the room glasses and brought them down to the pool. This is strictly against hotel policy by the way. Well along came our little pool cleaner, and I immediatly apologized for having broken the rules. He simply smiled, waved his hand at the sign, and said that "on vacation there are NO rules." Needless to say, we shared many a drink by the hot tub that week. The room itself was nicely appointed. It contained a queen sized bed and bedroom, bathroom with shower and deep tub, a living room, dining area and kitchen. Another major plus was an in room washer and dryer. On the last night of the trip, which I usually spend packing and doing nothing, I was able to wash all of my laundry. The hotel even provided complimentary laundry detergent and dryer sheets. This saved me from having to do work when I got home. My friend and I only ate at the hotel's Artist's Palette, which is a counter service restaurant located in the main hotel complex. The food was tasty, but I'd recommend venturing to some of the restaurants in Downtown Disney. This isn't hard to do either, considering Downtown Disney is only a short walk from the resort. This comes in handy too, as Downtown Disney is the only source of night life in the entire Walt Disney World Resort. If you pay for the park hopper ticket with add ons, you get free entrance to Paradise Island every night. This is a strip of about 8 night clubs to suit any taste. Our favorite was 8 tracks, the 70s and 80s themed club, as well as gay night at Mannequins (that's Thursday night for those who are interested). Drinks are a bit over priced, but then again isn't everything at Disney? One final note, I'd recommend paying for the Disney Dining plan. It is 40 dollars a day, per adult, but will save you hundreds of dollars for a week long trip. For a week long meal plan you get 7 daily snacks (water, bagel, apple, drink), 7 counter service meals (equivalent to eating at any of the parks' fast food eateries), and seven sit down meals (which you can double up to eat somewhere fancy). We decided to eat on our own buck one day, and doubled up a meal to eat at the Flying Fish Cafe, located in Disney's Boardwalk area. This was well worth the value, considering our two person dinner came to roughly 150 dollars. I hear they offer a premiere dining plan now, where you get two sit down meals a day, as well as two snacks, for a higher price. I'd still go for the basic meal plan, considering we found it difficult to finish our meals. Needless to say, if you want a more adult themed Disney vacation, I'd suggest Saratoga Springs.

<Title>“Great accomodation, great food - little atmosphere”
<Content>We stayed in a great two room apartement at the Springs. The quality of the accomondation was first class. Nice kitchen with all amenities (including granite worktops). Food at the Artists Palate was quick and good quality. It was usually quiet. Buses to the parks worked very well. Overall a great WDW vacation. My only negative is that in comparison to other Disney hotels there wasn't much themeing and it was a litte sterile. Btw, in response to Momskine's comments I witnessed a lifeguard pulling a kid out of the water before the parent's even noticed what was going on. Yes its great to have lifeguards, but parents need to take first responsibility.

<Title>“Great Stay”
<Content>Just got back fro a short stay at Saratoga Springs. Had 2 studio rooms, both were extremly clean and well kept. The lighting is a bit dull in the rooms. The pool area was great, the kids loved the slide. Buses every 20 minutes, no problem getting a seat. I think the first week in March is a great time to be at Disney, no long lines in the parks at all the whole time we were there. I will be staying at Saratoga Springs again in May because I had such a nice time there. The resort is very quiet and well kept. Lots of maintenance going on every day, sprucing things up. Check in was efficient and polite. Had a problem at Artist's Pallet, but it was resolved. All the staff we encountered were very polite and helpful.

<Title>“Lifeguard on duty - NOT REALLY!”
<Content>My family and I just got back from our vacation in FL (Feb15-18 '08). We stayed in a 2-bdr villa in Saratoga Springs resort. The amenities are great and we were truly having a magical experience up until we had a NIGHTMARE incident. My 2 sons (ages 6 and 8) were swimming in the High Rock Springs pool when my younger son after going through the slide panicked and was gasping for air. Good thing my older son (who is only 8 years old) was right behind him and tried to get him. He cried for help and I immediately went to their rescue. All this was happening right in FRONT of the lifeguard ON DUTY. He was talking to someone before, during and after the entire incident!!! My husband had to tell him that our sons were already drowning and he didn't even know it! We spoke to the Recreation Manager and he even defended the guy! That maybe he was talking to one of the guest. Unbelievable! So don't trust the lifeguards on duty if you want to keep your children SAFE in their pool. My older son was traumatized by this incident and we keep telling him that he did a brave thing by saving his younger brother.

There are many amenities, the place is very well-kept down to the smallest detail, and the staff seem to go out of their way to look out for our needs. (E.g. I bought a lot of food at the shop, and the cashier called a bellhop to drive me to my building, not far away, in one of their carts. Like everything in the area, food is expensive. We saved money by using the dining plan, but we preferred to stay in for breakfast and spent about $5 for a box of raisin bran and $5 for two quarts of milk. The two-bedroom suite had lovely appointments and a very practical layout in which the second bedroom had its own bathroom and large vanity area, away from the living areas. The master suite had a whirlpool tub and a very comfortable king-size bed. There were three televisions each with DVD players, and a full kitchen with coffeemaker, microwave, garbage disposal, range/oven, dishwasher, and full-size refrigerator. The bathrooms were beautifully tiled. The master bath was broken into three adjoining sections: the first had a sink and vanity with the whirlpool tub and a closet off to the side which included an ironing board and iron. Through the next door was a large glassed-in shower and pedestal sink. Off this room was another door to the toilet. This wasn't a tiny room either. Outside this area behind a louvered door was a stacking washer and dryer. Not full-size but perfect for doing a load each day. Other than a light bulb that didn't work, all was in order in our suite. I enjoyed sitting out on the patio in the mornings with my coffee and a view of the landscaping which had been given much attention to detail. The grounds of the resort are beautiful and we had free bus access to the parks and the Disney Express brought us from the airport and back. We didn't have to handle our luggage once the bell hop picked it up until we got it at our home airport. We even received our boarding passes before leaving the resort. The pool is beautiful, with one large and one small waterslide, and is open for about 18 hours a day, with a lifeguard most if not all of that time. The spa, which I didn't have the time to use, was rated one of the top five in North America by Conde Nast. There is also an arcade and game room, which we didn't have time to use. This resort is near Downtown Disney, and one can take a boat across the lake from SSRS to get there. It's nearest the Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios. I would definitely stay at this resort again.

<Title>“Did not love the prings”
<Content>We have jsut returned from a trip to Saratoga Springs in DisneyWorld. I was really disappointed with the resort. The one bedroom vaction home we stayed in at the Springs building was very dark and not as spacious as advertised. The one bedroom unit had one room with a bed and the other people were supposed to sleep on the pull out sofa in the living room. The sofa had no mattress just a pad that was very uncomfortable. The bathrooms were really small and there was only one toilet so it is really one bathroom with an extra tub (not shower). I mean who takes a bath on vacation? My husband and two teenagers who travelled with me were disappointed with the long wait for the busses to transport us to the parks. One day we waited 40 minutes for a bus to animal kingdom. We had previously stayed at All Star Music and found the property to be much more convenient and cleaner. Also the pool at Saratoga was terrible - filled with screaming kids and dirty. We will never stay at this resort again

<Title>“Travels with a toddler & a baby...”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at Saratoga Springs in January 2008 with our toddler and 5 month old. We chose Saratoga Springs because it was Disney's newest resort and we figured it would have the least wear and tear. The hotel was clean, comfortable and nicely furnished. We rented a 1 bedroom villa, which was plenty of room for the four of us and allowed us all to sleep in different areas of the villa. (Important for us so our children would not wake each other up and we would not have to go to bed with them at 7:30 pm!) I would say the room is equal to a 3 star hotel room, on par with a Marriot. We had a pool right outside our room which was quiet and convienent and the larger, more crowded pool was a 10 minute walk away. We were able to walk to Downtown Disney from our room, also about a 10 minute walk with two kids in a stroller. Disney provided a pack n' play for the baby and we had them deliver a crib to our villa for our toddler. Both worked out well. Since our villa had a kitchen, we bought some groceries at the Artist's Pallette, which is the quick service restaurant near the main pool. They have a small grocery section and carry a fairly decent range of items including eggs, waffles, milk, juice, cereal, bread, some canned goods, paper plates, baby food, aluminum foil, beer and wine, etc. The prices were a little bit higher than you would find at home but not too bad. One note for parents: I didn't see diapers but was told they only sell Huggies in Disney. (for Pampers users out there) We brought them with us but a good tip I got was to order some online (maybe from Amazon?) and have them shipped directly to the resort. The resort will hold them for you until you arrive. We took the bus twice a day to the parks. The bus stop was just outside our room and the wait was fairly short wait as was the ride. We were able to fold up our double stroller and carry it on to the bus with us to the parks. We thought we would be spending more evenings having dinner in Downtown Disney than we did. It ended up that we had dinner most nights in Epcot. In hindsight, it would have chosen a villa at the Boardwalk or Beach Club, which are both in walking distance to Epcot. I can't stress this enough - Make sure you make dinner reservations before you leave for your trip. At least for the first night. By the time we checked in, got settled and got our bearings, we quickly realized there was at least an hour wait for most restaurants. We were hungry and tired from travelling all day and the hour wait with two kids was just not an option! On last unrelated note: Wherever you stay, try to go check out The Wilderness Lodge. It is a really fun property, the lobby is especially cool and I think they also have villas.

<Title>“Sometimes beautiful does not matter!”
<Content>Although the grounds are beautiful and the buildings are beautiful....The rooms were mediocre. We did not like the concrete halls, it made it feel incomplete. The rooms do not have enough closet space, and we stayed in a villa. There is definitely not enough drawer space. The shower was dirty, the refrigerator has some left over butter and an open bottle of water in it, and the stove was filthy. I have been coming to Disney since it opened and I have never been disappointed before. I was not quite sure how to feel. This was our first stay since purchasing Disney Vacation Club and we are not pleased with the accommodations at all.

<Title>“Won't be back”
<Content>This was our first family trip to Disney and the travel agent recommended this property as it was one of the newest. The property is VERY large and has 4 bus stops. We luckily got a room close to the main lobby. The major problem is that there are ONLY 2 restaurants and only 1 of those is open for breakfast and it's not even a buffet. It's counter service. So there was a long line everyday for breakfast and they would run out of food. It was horrible. If you wanted to eat at another hotel you would have to take the bus and that would mean at least another 30 - 45 minutes. I don't understand for the life of me why they would have only 1 restaurant open for a property this large!!!! That 'sinsane! Our room was nice, but way too small for 4 people. We had a queen/full bed and a pull out. If you are traveling with 2 adults and 2 children get a 2 bedroom suite or stay at a hotel with larger rooms. The bus system needs some work. We waited a average of 20 - 30 minutes for a bus to come and it was usually crowded, so we had to stand. This was both going to and coming home from the parks. The bus from Downtown Disney to the hotel (which is next door) is about 15 - 20 minutes, because you have to stop at Pleasure Island and many times the bus drivers changed shifts there. Take the boat, it's much faster! For those reasons and with all of the choices in the area, we will not stay here again on our next visit.

<Title>“Saratoga Springs is a Great Place!”
<Content>When we arrived at the resort, we couln't believe how huge it was! We arrived around 2 p.m. I had requested a room in "The Springs" building, but we were informed that there wasn't a room ready. We went over to concierge to have our park tickets put on our room key, and he ended up helping us get a room in another section, and I'm so glad he did! He put us in a room in "The Grandstand" section, which I think is the newer section. We had a room with a view of the golf course and was the closest building to the bus station, which was awesome! We had a 1-BR room, and there were 3 of us. The room is one of the nicest I've ever been in! It had a full kitchen, which we never used, a hot tub, walk-in shower, pull-out bed that was comfortable. We felt like royalty the whole week. The area was very quiet. We were the first to be picked up (for the bus) and the first dropped off, which was nice after a long day after the parks! We were there for 7 nights, and I don't think we ever saw an actual person on our floor, except for 1 time! It was that quiet! The staff was very helpful and very nice. There are alot of reviews that state that SSR isn't very Disney, I beg to differ! I've stayed at 4 Disney resorts and this one is #2 on my list, BoardWalk being the 1st. It's true that SSR is out-of-the-way, but the resort is so beautiful, and that made the distance worth it! I would definately stay here again! But there are many other Disney resorts that I want to stay at, so it will be a while.

<Title>“Beautiful resort, but not a great vacation...”
<Content>My husband, toddler, and I just returned from Saratoga Springs resort in Orlando. The resort was nice, but I'm not sure it was exactly right for us. Here is the good, the bad, and the ugly. The good: *The resort is absolutely gorgeous - beautifully landscaped grounds, secluded and quiet, fantastic pools, nicely decorated rooms, friendly staff. We stayed in a studio in the Grandstand section, which is the newest section of the resort, and it was really very nice - the quiet pool in this area has water features, pool, and spa and the bus stop is close to the rooms (and also the first stop, so we never had to stand on our ride to the parks). *The Magic Bus from the hotel and luggage delivery was seamless, though it did take 3 hours to get our bags. This is a great feature and really made things easier for us traveling with a small child. Also, getting our return-flight boarding passes and checking our luggage right there at the hotel was a huge time-saver. *The queen bed in the room was exceptionally comfortable. *The bus service is well-run and we never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a bus. The bad: *The resort is nothing short of HUGE and the maps they provide are not very helpful! I read the other reviews about this and thought those people must just be in bad shape, but I assure you, if you have any kind of disability (in our case it was a relatively fit, though pregnant me and a toddler who demanded to be carried everywhere), you will find it exhausting getting from your room to the main area (carriage house, pool, restaurant, etc.). *The resort is set pretty far away from other things (as were most of the WDW hotels, from what I could tell). I realize this is part of the charm, but I assumed we could easily get (by bus or foot) to other hotels or other Disney areas for dinner, etc., and this was simply not the case. The one exception to this is Downtown Disney, which is about a mile walk and a relatively quick water taxi ride. *I chose this resort primarily because I thought we could buy a few things and prepare some meals in our room (like breakfast). Unfortunately, though, the pantry at the Artists Colony sells mostly junk food - sugary cereals and snacks, frozen burritos and hot pockets, etc. - so this did not happen for us. We did buy some milk and fruit to keep in our room, but not enough to sustain us by any means. If you do not have a car, I recommend you pack some groceries. Otherwise, you'll be stuck eating junk or eating out all week. *The food at the Artists Colony is not good - overpriced cafeteria food and not a lot of choices. We ate there more times than I'd like to say and I really hated it by the end of the week. Also, it is very disorganized - you stand in line to order, then you get drinks, then you stand in line to pay and then you have to return for your food and there are people going every which way to try to find the right line. If I stay here again, I will plan out my meals the first day and make reservations at the sit-down restaurant on site or at downtown disney. The ugly: *The hide-a-bed is U-G-L-Y. It is literally a 2-inch foam mattress on a plywood platform. Next time, I will choose a resort with 2 queen beds over a resort with a hideabed and microwave/fridge. *Another very bad part of our vacation (and this really has nothing to do with SSR, except that the limited food choices drove us to it) was the meal we had at CapN Jacks at Downtown Disney. The food was TERRIBLE!!! The worst I have ever had. In fact, the food in general at Disney - hotel, parks, etc. - was pretty sub-par. The best meal we had all week, no joke, was breakfast at McDonalds at Downtown Disney the last day of our trip and that's only because it was the one time the food was average but we did not feel we were getting ripped off. *Check your charges as you are making your purchases!!! My son is not yet 3 (almost, but not yet) and we clarified this with the front desk upon check-in, but we were still charged for a park ticket for 2 days for him (even though under 3 are free). I bought the tickets at the concierge desk at the hotel who simply said "its taken care of" (I didn't approve the charge or sign anything) and did not realize we had been charged until check-out. When we tried to get this resolved we were told 1) we used the ticket, so there was nothing Disney could do, then 2) because I indicated at the time I booked the room that he was 3, they could not change this (even though they indicated to us they had changed this on our reservation at check-in) and then 3) the issue could not be resolved because a manager was not on duty. It was my fault for not checking the charges, but this really is no way to treat people. I now have to try to resolve the issue by phone and I am not optimistic I will see my $124 again. The resort is beautiful and it was nice to be on vacation, but I doubt we will stay at this resort again. For us, it would have been better to stay at a nice Disney or non-Disney resort with comfortable beds, that is near other things, so we would have some options for meals and entertainment, then take a taxi or shuttle to the parks. The resort is way too pricey and beyond decor, bus transport, and ability to buy park tickets and get our boarding passes at the hotel, there was not a great deal of Disney magic (at least not enough that I think we would miss it if we stayed somewhere else). Also, the studio aspect of the room (microwave/fridge) was relatively useless, since we did not bring groceries with us, and did not make up for the fact that we essentially had a room with only one functioning bed.

<Title>“wonderful week”
<Content>We exchanged our timeshare for this resort. We loved the resort. Nice and quiet area. We had a 1 bedroom unit , It had every thing we needed including washer and dryer. It was nice to pack clean clothing to come home. We love having a kitchen to save on going out to eat everyday. We went out to eat only 2 evenings. We highly recommend Artist Point- Wilderness Lodge and Yachtsman Club - Yachtsman Beach resort. Also we found Jan. to be a great time to go to Disney. Lines are very small. Most attractions we could walk right on to. Only the most popular attactions had a line.

<Title>“Wonderful Resort”
<Content>We are Disney Vacation Club members and this was our first time staying at our "home" resort. We had 2 other couples with us and a teenage daughter of one of the couples, so we had a 2 bedroom villa and a studio room (less points that the grand villa), and could not be happier. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. The biggest thing we all noticed was the quiet. Though we had a family with 5 kids staying above us, and another family with children next to us, once in the room, you never heard your neighbors. I know others have said that Disney Animal Kingdom and Wilderness Lodge are more "Disney", and I agree they are wonderful places having been to both, but unlike these resorts that center around a common and often crowded and noisy lobby, this resort is more spread out, laid back, and peaceful. I found the vacation much more relaxing at Saratoga Springs, and my husband and I are very pleased and I don't think will stray from our home resort again. We also found that having a kitchen was a big money saver for breakfast and snacks. We used gardengrocer.com and had groceries delivered right to the room (cheaper and more varity than the Disney service and since we don't use a rental car at Disney, very convienent). Having a washing machine right in the room was great too. We never unpacked some of our clothes and know we will pack less next time. Also, it is nice to come home and unpack clean clothes instead of facing all that dirty laundry. Folks with young kids would really benefit from both the kitchen and laundry facilities. Bottom line, this is a wonderful resort especially if you are looking for a quiet place to relax after a fun day at the parks.

<Title>“Nice, but not very Disneyfied.”
<Content>This is the second time I stayed in this hotel, renting points off of a DVC owner. This resort is easy to get a room in if you are a DVC owner or point renter because of its size. I stayed in a studio room, which was similar to all other DVC studio rooms. A studio consists of a bed, couch, small table with two chairs and a "kitchenette" that has a student type fridge, microwave and bar type sink in your room's hallway. All rooms appeared to have a patio or balcony. This hotel a good choice if you want to spend allot of time in Downtown Disney and you can get a room close enough to walk downtown. Be forewarned though, that the resort is huge and you could easily be out of walking distance to downtown and need to take the bus like everyone else. The resort does lack most of the themeing you see in Disney's nicer resorts like the Animal Kingdom, Grand Floridian, etc. There really isn't much of a themed lobby or other common areas and what they do have could be a huge distance from your resorts unit. Some good points of the resort, however, is that appears more quiet than most Disney resorts, is cheaper than other DVC resorts and has parking very close to your room. This resort is a nice choice if you want to stay on Disney property, in a less expensive room in which you have some ability to have food in your room. It is also a good choice if you are not expecting or desiring full Disney theming.

<Title>“Saratoga is OK”
<Content>We are DVC members, and this was our first time at our "home resort". The "problem" was, that we first stayed at The Fort Wilderness Lodge ! You can't compare the two! Saratoga is a beautiful resort and very close(walking distance) to Downtown Disney. The studio we stayed at was a good size with plenty of room for the four of us. Transportation was very good, so was the fast service resturant. Shopping was not that great, but then you have the whole Downtown right next door...The pool was nice and the kids loved the slide. (Yeah, we went swimming in December!) Overall the resort is just above OK. If you want your money or "points" worth, save it for the Animal Kingdom resort or Fort Wilderness Lodge. There you will get everything you have ever dreamed of in a Disney vacation. I was very surprised that Saratoga Springs did not do much in decorating for Christmas. The other resorts did.

<Title>“Great place to stay at Disney!”
<Content>We stayed for 2 nights at Saratoga Springs in a studio. We loved this resort! We were in the Congress Park section. I believe this is the oldest section and the room had a little bit of wear. But it was still very nice. I would stay in this section again due to it's location. We had a great view of Downtown Disney from our balcony and it was a 10 minute walk. There was a beautiful pool that was almost empty both times we used it within 5 minutes. Congress Park is also great if you don't have a car because it was less than 10 minutes to walk to the main pool/fitness center/front desk area. The studio is the size of your typical hotel room. The sofa bed was not comfortable, but are they ever? There is a small refrigerator, a microwave, toaster and some basic kitchen items. There were free washers and dryers by the quiet pool, about 5 minutes away. One of the best things for us was that Disney will allow you to check into your flight at the hotel. They printed our boarding passes and took our bags for us. We were able to go straight through security when we arrived. It was great to not have to deal with the luggage at the airport. The total check in process took less than 10 minutes. We would recommend this hotel and plan to stay again in the future!

<Title>“Really enjoyed the stay”
<Content>We have been to Saratoga Springs a couple of times now and really enjoy it. Even though the property is huge, it is still relatively easy to get around. Usually an easy walk to the quiet pools. The main pool might be a little bit of a haul from some of the rooms, but it is worth it. Very easy to get to Downtown Disney, either walking or taking the water transport. The grounds are very nicely maintained and relaxing to walk around. Rooms are decent size. Nicely kept up and very convenient. We usually get a one bedroom which has a sleeper for the kids in the living room, a full kitchen and a nice balcony. The Artist Palatte restaurant is decent. It seems to have been upgraded since our last stay. The second restaurant (the name slips my mind at the moment) is supposedly nice. We didn't get a chance to try it. Overall you will enjoy your stay. It is a very nice resort.

<Title>“Great Firat Disney Trip!”
<Content>This was our first trip to Disney and the whole experience was AMAZING! There were 22 people in all. We were in a 2 bedroom villa which was fabulous! The staff smiled every minute of every day and went the extra mile to satisfy every request! We did not use the pool- it was a bit cool during our stay, but it looked beautiful! The food was good, nice selection of snacks available. The whole resort is very clean. I cannot say enough about how pleased we all were. We will be returning!

<Title>“Disney and SSR in December - Another fabulous Disney Vacation.”
<Content>We stayed at Disney’s Saratoga Springs from December 9 -14, 2007. My husband and I are DVC members and own here. There were 10 of us total (myself, husband, 5 yr old son, 14 yr old daughter, mother & father in law, sister & brother in law, 7 yr old neice and 3 yr old nephew) and we booked a 2 bedroom unit (2 baths, full kitchen, small living/dining area) and a studio (1 bath, sitting area & kitchenette – perfect for 2 adults). We kept juice, milk and snacks on hand, plus the all important coffee and tea supplies!!! When making our reservation back in May, I specifically requested that both rooms be together and in the Congress Park area of the resort. Both of these requests were granted with no problems. Having stayed here twice before, when the resort was brand new, the Congress Park section was the only section completed and that is where we are most comfortable. The nice thing about this section is that is only about a 5-10 minute walk to Downtown Disney Marketplace and their bus stop. Also, you can walk to the main area of the resort, pool, restaurant, golf course pro shop, boat launch, in about 10 minutes. There is also a quiet pool and small playground overlooking the lake. Make no mistake, the resort is absolutely huge and sprawling, but also very beautiful. If you have the time and energy, take a stroll around the lake and resort! There are 5 bus stops, one in each section, which have buses that go only to the parks and Downtown Disney. (If you need to get to a resort, you will need to get on a theme park or DD bus and changes buses there.) They run every 15-20 minutes or so. This is no different than the bus routes at the other resorts, and might actually be quicker than some! You can actually take any theme park bus from any resort stop to “The Springs” stop to get to Artist’s Palette and theme pool area, if you don’t feel like walking. The counter service restaurant, the Artist’s Palette, is small and usually over crowded especially at breakfast time. The gift shop and food store are all part of this area and share the same cash registers. Some of us ate there a few times and had no problems with waiting too long. The only complaint is that the line to order food is smack in the middle of everything and makes it look like the place is mobbed, but it moves quickly. It is a little disorganized, but service and food was good! Hopefully, if a lot of us complain about the set-up, Disney will make some changes. Fortunately, the weather was absolutely beautiful and we were able to use the pool. Our 14 year old loves the big slide and the 5 year old loved playing in the Donald Duck fountain. There is also a smaller slide for the little ones! We were there in the morning from about 9:30 – 11:00 or so, and it was not crowded. The water was a perfect temperature. We did not use the hot tub or pool bar, so can’t comment on them. SSR also has a spa and fitness center, which we did not use this time, but have used in the past. The spa is a little pricey (but that’s to be expected at a resort & Disney), but the pedicure I had on a previous trip was worth it! DVC Members get a discount on some of the services. We used bell services on both arrival day and departure day. Perfect, perfect, perfect – absolutely no problems! Also, had no problems with housekeeping or maintenance. On our first morning, we noticed that the tub in the 2nd bedroom was draining very slowly and with 3 of us trying to shower, it was a slow process! We called maintenance and when we got back from our day at the park, it was all fixed and ready for showers! We came to Disney in December to see the Christmas decorations at the parks and resorts and we were not disappointed! Everything was absolutely beautiful! Overall, family was very pleased with SSR and we would stay here again. However, we also like staying at Boardwalk or Beach Club, because of the direct walking access to both MGM and Epcot.

<Title>“Great Place to Stay, Very Clean!!”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here from Dec. 9th thru the 14th. It is of course beautiful and the room was a studio which all my wife and I needed. The bed was comfortable and I fell asleep fast. It is a very good place to stay. The restaurant was very good for lunch as we had a rubuen for $9.99/ea. Not that bad for Disney. I got the room from a friend who has disney points. It went smooth at check in, and check out. I would stay again.

<Title>“Beautiful but big”
<Content>This propery was beautiful, especially with the christmas decorations. The rooms were nice, but not really above average. The food court was your typical Disney food court. The Port Orleans Riverside actually has a better food experience. This hotel would be great for someone that is staying for a while and can take advantage of all there is to do there. My only complaint is that it is almost impossible to get around the grounds without a map. Even with the directories that they place around the campus, my wife and I still managaed to get lost more than once. It is a beautiful resort, its just too big.

<Title>“Would Stay Again”
<Content>I was pleased with my stay at Saratoga but would have been even happier had I had some knowledge ahead of time. I hope this helps! There were four gals traveling 2 and 2 in studios. Checkin went smoothless for 2 of us. We got in at 1100am and the other 2 got their room @4pm. We got our own luggage off Magical Express and headed to checkin. Because we had the one room we put all the bags there, otherwise they'll hold the bags till your room is ready. Keep in mind this resport is huge and I saw too too many people walking around lost and many with bags. Insist on bellman help! be nice but insist, especailly with kids. The food court is fine. There are $7 to $8 flatbread pizzas and pita sandwichs big enought to share. I dont reccomend the refillable cup because its only good at the resort and youre out of there in the parks too much. I thought the sloppy joes, lo mein, tacos salads and bugers at the food courts at All Stars were less gourmet but a way better value. Plan to do only breakfast , fruits and snacks at Saratoga. I like the Paddock area for the pool and close pick up. REMEMBER if youre riding the park transportation home at night there are about 4 stops if you pick the wrong one you can be miles from your room. Tell the driver your room # or building. I spoke with many people with strollers and kids who got lost. If you dont ask ,the driver is no help he'll just announce stop #1, 2 etc. ... The rooms are nice with Patios or balconies and exterior cement walkways very very safe and well lighted. The pull outs are ok not the most comfotable but Ive had worse. maid svc came about 930am. They will deliver your pack and play, clean the room help however they can ,their english is ok at best but they were extemely nice and concerned about everything. Magical Express vouchers come the day befor you leave. You checkout at 11am and again if you dont call for bellman help they wont come and you will drag your bags and kids miles for checkout. We saw one paticualr family doing this and they were furious. They dragged their bags so far and got in the airline check in line at the resort. Give them you bags and voucher and depending on the airline theyll print your boeadring pass right there. We were encouraged to tip the girls checking us in. So this particalar family says I dragged by bags for a mile and you expect a tip for picking them up and moving them 2 feet. Good point! I you check out at 11am and fly home at 5 like I did. Youe Magical Express ride should be about 2pm. Expect 3 hrs before your flight. SO all in all. Very nice resort BUT for what you pay you shouldnt have to ask for so much help. It should be offered!...Enjoy and contact me with any questions [--]

<Title>“Nice but not very "Disney"”
<Content>We just returned from a week stay at Disney World; we stayed at Saratoga Springs Disney Resort. There were 9 of us - my husband and I and our 7 children ranging in age from 18 yrs to 2yrs old. It seems this Disney resort is geared toward folks who don't want a total "Disney" atmosphere. For guests who want that, they would probably enjoy staying here. For our family, we missed the "Disney" atmosphere which is found at other resorts such as the Boardwalk and Wilderness. It's a nice facility but no different than any non-Disney hotel/resort. The resort is HUGE. We sensed that any issues we had were probably due to the sheer size of this resort. The lobby is surprisingly small, especially for a resort this huge. There is an area off to the side with cartoons on a TV, to keep little ones occupied while a parent checks in. That was nice. Off a hallway there were some sitting areas. The areas outside the lobby were shaded and nice. When we arrived our first day, we headed to the bathrooms off the lobby. Not a "Disney" welcome. They were messy with paper towels on the floor, water on the counters, etc. Also small and crowded. The baby changing station is directly opposite the door so babies being changed are in full view of everyone going in and out. We are used to immaculate Disney resorts so this was an odd first impression. There are 3-4 bus stops within the resort itself, so when planning to be somewhere those need to be included in travel times. Our room was very close to a bus stop, within easy walking distance of the main hotel area, and had a nice view of the grounds and Downtown Disney. Our villa was big and fit our family nicely. There was a main bedroom w/king size bed and full bath. Then a living room/ full kitchen area which had a pull out sofa bed. Then an additional bedroom with 2/queen sized beds and full bath. The kitchen was clean and fully stocked with dishware. There was a DVD with the living room TV. When the pull out bed was opened there was no room whatsoever in the living room area, and barely room to squeeze by between the kitchen counter and bed. So, we only pulled the bed out when it was time to use it and folded it up first thing in the morning. Our room was clean but needed a lot of rehab. One of the hall closet folding doors was broken - we found this out when our 2 yr old opened the door and it literally fell out of the tracks. The carpeting in our room was in desperate need of being replaced. It was completely worn, in most spots the pattern was worn through and in one spot it was worn/torn through to the floor. The drawers in two of the dresser units did not open and shut well and in one of them, when we arrived, we found a dried crust of bread. Housekeeping kept our room very nice while we were there. When we called them for extra towels and an extra blanket, they brought them immediately. That was nice. A couple times when we needed to reach the front desk with questions, and called from our cell phones while at a Park, the phone rang and rang and was never picked up. We did the Disney Dining plan and usually ate breakfast at the resort - either at the Artist's Palette or brought it back to our room. The seating there is limited. Breakfast was good. We also bought snacks there on our Dining Plan. For all of our sit down dinners within the parks we made reservations several weeks before our trip, and those worked out *great*. One day we decided to change restaurants and when my husband called to ask, Disney gave us a reservation at another restaurant, no problem. I don't think we would stay at Saratoga Springs again. Maybe if it was the *only* place we could stay. There's just no Disney magic there, which might be fine with some guests but we would prefer more "Disney" at our resort. It was cheaper than other resorts, so we told ourselves that was the benefit (saving some $). We are limited to which resorts we can stay at, due to the size of our family, and saving money is always nice.

<Title>“Make it your last resort at Disneyworld”
<Content>My husband, daughter and I stayed at Saratoga Springs Resort for a three day weekend in October. We are frequent Disney visitors and adore all things Disney....except this resort. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and did like the fact that there were 2 separate sink/bathing areas, and the kitchen was a definite plus. HOWEVER, the sofa bed was a joke and so uncomfortable my adult daughter slept curled uncomfortably on the couch cushions the second night. No roll aways are provided at SS. The cleanliness of the room was definitely not up to Disney standards. We found empty pop bottles behind the patio door curtains, crumbs under the sofa cushions and dirty tissues in the drawers. One lamp shade had what appeared to ketchup smeared all over it! The weather was VERY warm, and we were fortunate to have rented a car, because walking to the pool was not an option. There isn't any parking provided near the pool and activity area except for 30 minute check-in, so we parked illegally. A water main was broken causing the toilets in the main lobby area to be closed....luckily the spa opened its doors for pool guests. The poolside bar was unable to sell any drinks except beer, and they didn't put up a sign notifying guests, so we all stood in line for 15-20 minutes for pop and margaritas, only to be turned away! The food court was ok, but service in the restaurant on the golf course was so abominable we walked out after waiting 20 minutes for a server to notice us. All in all a very disappointing resort. We will return to the Boardwalk or Port Orleans to get our next Disney "fix". I would not recommend Saratoga Springs except as a "last resort".

<Title>“Saratoga Springs - quality resort - kids night games at Community Hall need help”
<Content>As DVC owners, we stay at Saratoga Springs on a fairly regular basis. We most recently stayed there in October, 2007 and for the first time in the Caroseul section (to the left as you go through the entrance). Our stay was in a one bedroom unit - king size bed in the main bedroom with a very comfortable pull out sofa couch in the living room area, and a full although smallish kitchen. Please note that this area of the resort does not have a leisure/quiet pool area (you have to go to the Paddock or Grandstand for a leisure/quiet pool area - about a 10 minute walk at a good pace). The Caroseul section appeared to be the quietest during our trip based on observation of number of cars parked in the lot. It was a very peaceful area of the resort with little activity and had a very nice balcony view out towards Downtown Disney Resorts in the distance with other parts of the resort, fountains etc. in the foreground. We were on the top (4th) floor and had nice view. The elevators were always timely and efficient - we also took the stairs a number of times to get a little bit of exercise in. The room was quite clean and very nicely decorated with all in working order. We had two different neighbours in the lock-off studio portion next door but never heard any noise from their unit. The bus stop was about a 5 minute walk and the Community Hall area a decent 10-15 minute walk at a middling pace. The pool area was busy but not crowded and the Grandstand leisure pool with splash pad area had some light traffic and was quiet enjoyable. The Community Hall has a wide selection of DVDs for free rental by guests at the resort and also lifejackets (for duration of stay) and a number of board games, computer access, crafts etc. There is a medium sized games arcade near the pool area. The one thing that did not impress us was the somewhat indifferent attitude of some of the Community Hall staff for the later kids activities (around 7pm, there were scheduled activities). One night there were not enough kids so after requesting (note had to ask), the staff member put out some crafts items and the kids made up some crafts. Subsequently I then played a board game with some of the kids (including my own) to make things more exciting for them. Another night, my kids were the only ones who showed up for the activity - the staff member basically ignored our sitter and the kids and did not suggest any alternate activities or offer any assistance. We did not dine at The Turf Club but did order counter service food at Artists Palette. There is a good selection of food choices there but the service takes a fair amount of time (almost 15 minutes) to complete so make sure you allocate sufficient time to allow for your order to be completed. Overall, we enjoy staying at Saratoga Springs and would stay there again - the kids find it enjoyable and relaxing and love watching the Disney buses roll buy and we like the muted, warm toned decor and the walking paths throughout the property.

<Title>“Quiet Comfort”
<Content>Our family of 4 enjoyed a second stay at Saratoga Springs and still believe it is the most pleasant of the Disney resorts we've tried (Carribean Beach, Coronado Springs, Boardwalk, Old Key West and Port Orleans). The distances within the resort were not a problem for us. I think that if in every day life you generally choose to take the stairs whenever possible or enjoy walking to the post office for fun you won't mind the short walks to the front desk etc. But if you drive around looking for the closest parking space at the mall and always take the elevator you probably won't appreciate the grounds of this resort. Those walks will seem more burden than pleasure. Since it is a vacation club resort you only have housekeeping services every 4 days. Even then it only includes emptying the trash and fresh towels. They don't make beds or do dishes but we loved the convenience of making breakfast and doing laundry in the room. Last, the bus service is a bit slow. It does take longer to get to places than with other resorts but it is still a convenience and not much of a problem. In the end, retreating to this quiet picturesque resort was a pleasure after the hussle-n-bussle of every other place in Disney.

<Title>“Loved it! Perfect for our family of 4”
<Content>We stayed at Saratoga Springs Oct 29th- Nov 3rd in a 1BR villa. It was wonderful. The hotel rooms are beautiful, not one complaint. The check in was quick and easy, we got the room in the section we requested and floor we requested. We stayed in the Congress Park area which is the closest to Downtown Disney. We walked there with our 3 and 4 yr old and it took about 5 minutes. We had a nice pool right outside our building and wonderful views of Downtown Disney from our balcony. Housekeeping was great- left a big hamper full of clean towels, papertowels, paper plates etc every other day. Room was very quiet. Our kids slept on the king bed and we slept on the pullout sofa. It was ok, not bad for a pullout. Having the W&D was awesome- did a load of laundry every night. The jacuzzi tub was great. The main pool by the Springs was so fun and had 2 slides. Theres also a poolside bar and an arcade. The artists pallette had a nice selection of groceries. I drove to Publix before heading to the Artists Pallette but didnt even need to- they had everything there. Even frozen waffles. We had our own car so cant comment on the transportation- but we will definitely be staying here again. Loved it!!!!!

<Title>“Very nice”
<Content>Our family just spent four days at Saratoga Springs and had a wonderful time. Saratoga Springs, along with 5 others, is one of the primary Disney Vacation Club resorts in Orlando. It is the newest one and, like others have posted, it is very, very widespread. But because it is so big, it seemed a lot less crowded and hurried. The grounds are beautiful and well kept, and the staff was friendly. We stayed at a spacious 3 bedroom villa with 2 other families. The decor was one of the nicest I’ve seen – simple, yet elegant colonial charm. It had a bedroom downstairs with a king bed, and 2 bedrooms upstairs, each with 2 double beds. Each bedroom had a full bathroom, and there was a 4th bathroom next to the living room. The kitchen itself was fully equipped with refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, sink, cookware, and dinnerware. There was a nice, big dining table, balcony,washer/dryer, dvd player, and cable tv with a gazillion Disney channels. The only problem with the room was a temperamental thermostat. There are essentially 5 sections of Sarasota Springs, ours was in The Springs, which is closest to the main entrance. I liked our location, since the main entrance had the mini-mart, the restaurant, the pick up/drop off for the Magical Express to the airport, and was closest to the boat taking you to Downtown Disney. However, when going to the parks, it is the last stop out of the 5 sections, both going and coming back. This meant that we usually had no seats when going to the parks in the morning. The bus stop order was the Grandstand, the Carousel, Congress Park, the Paddock, and then the Springs. If you stay at Congress Park, it is a brisk walk to Downtown Disney, where there are lots of dining choices. We stayed at the parks most of the day, so we didn’t eat at the restaurants until the last day. We ate at the Artist’s Palette for brunch, which is a quick service place, and the food was fine. Their swimming pool was an adequate size with a fun big slide and a little toddler slide. We went for a brief swim, and because the weather was not so nice, it was not crowded – but they seem to be a little short on the lounge chairs. There were 2 large hot tubs also. My 2 cents: 1. Eat breakfast in. The kitchenettes at this resort allow you to save by eating breakfast in. They have a mini-market at the Artist’s Palette near the main entrance, which are expectedly higher than normal prices, but reasonable enough. 2. If you’re staying at a Disney resort, use the DINING PLAN. This was one discovery that I made this trip that I hadn’t done before and it’s well worth it. For $43 per adult per “day”, you get 1 Quick Service Meal, 1 Snack, and 1 Table Service meal. For kids 3-9 years old, it’s just $11 per kid, and you get the same things, but from the kids menu. It is a lot of food, especially if you eat at the buffets. The Quick Service meal (entree, dessert, and drink) is like their fast food places, perfect for lunch or dinner. The Table Service Meal (appetizer, entree, dessert, and drink) can be used for their nicer restaurants and character dining restaurants. What’s best is that tip is also included! You don’t have to use the allotted meals all in one day, you can save them from one day to the next. They are linked to your room key, so even your kids can walk around with their room key and purchase with it. This is a sweet deal and Disney knows it, so starting January 2008, they’re not going to offer appetizers with Table Service meals and the tip will not be included. Even so, it is a good deal. 3. Unless you have a car, you have to take the buses when at Disney. If you don’t like the buses, stay at the Contemporary or Polynesian, which are on the monorail and can take you to Epcot and Magic Kingdom. MGM and Animal Kingdom are only accessible by bus or car. You don’t have to wait more than 15 minutes for a bus.

<Title>“Pool made my son sick!”
<Content>The pool at Saratoga Springs made my son very sick the minute he got out of the pool. In fact he had to go to the doctor's which took 4 hours away from our vacation. Doctor stated to many chemicals. Disney, of course, denies any wrong-doing.

<Title>“Saratoga Springs even better than The Grand Floridian!!!”
<Content>Now after staying at The Grand Floridian last year I never thought I would be saying that I prefer Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa. I would say the only thing that it doesn't beat The Grand Floridian on is that it doesn't have a view of Disney's fireworks show 'Wishes' and the best restaraunt in Orlando, Victoria & Albert's. When you turn into the resort one of the first things you notice is how stunning the grounds are. So colorful and full of wildlife. Truly spectacular. You could spend time just walking around the resort and absolutely love it. The main pool is the best, the rockery and waterslide are brilliant. This is really a picturesque resort everywhere you turn. Artist Pallete is the food court which has a wide variety of different food. Not the same burger and fries that you get everywhere else. The main restaraunt looked like it offered a really nice selection of food and seemed to be very popular. If you don't fancy eating out you can choose to buy from a wide variety of foods to take back to your studio as you have the facilities to cook your own meals. We stayed in The Grandstand block, The rooms are the largest rooms I have seen on Disney property. The amount of space is unbelievable. It has the most comfortable bed I have slept in whilst away from home and has wonderful views from your balcony of either the rest of the resort or if your lucky Dowtown Disney. Whilst this resort was amzing there was one negative about it. When we checked in we had knowledge of bad review of the block called The Paddocks, and at first we where sent there wary of the fact it might be a dissapointment. Well unfortunately the negative reviews are right and this block is far away from the main facilities and seemed to be not very well lit and as nice as the rest of the resort. We were then immediately moved to the newest block which is The Grandstand which had it's own pool, hot tub and snack bar. Overall our experience at Saratoga Springs was fabulous and we look forward to returning there in the upcoming years.

<Title>“Loved it - didn't want to leave!”
<Content>My 4 year old daughter and I stayed at this resort in a studio for four nights and it was wonderful! We stayed using a DVC member's points and was treated very well. Our studio was located in The Springs building which was close to the main pool and The Artist's Palette which offers guests a variety of food, sundries and souvenirs. It's open until 11pm too! The cast members were very helpful, the bus service (to and from the parks and the Magical Express) was excellent and check in/out went smoothly. My only regret is that we didn't stay another night for Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party @ the Magic Kingdom. Staying on Disney property made all the difference in the world and this resort is exceptional! We have decided to become DVC members! Can't wait to take advantage of all the wonderful perks that come along with membership not to mention the excellent accomodations!

<Title>“Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa--Very Lovely Resort”
<Content>Wow! Where do I begin! Saratoga Springs is a very lovely resort! The Hotel staff seemed very nice--always willing to help with whatever they could. They definitely have the Disney touch! I think my 5 year old son, Logan fell in love with a lady (Kayla) in the Gift Shop! He'd visit her everyday! Everything from the main pool to the luxuriously maintained lawns and landscaping seemed to be in tip top shape! We have stayed off property before, and this was a royal treat for us! Staying on Disney property definitely has its perks-from the extra magic hours to free Disney transportation. My son has a pediatric stroller/wheelchair and the bus drivers didn't seem to mind to have to buckle and strap him in place on each trip to the parks. We had a problem the first night we stayed with a broken air conditioner and maintenance took a little while getting to us (due to miscommunication with the front desk staff), but after realizing they wouldn't be able to fix our problem in a speedy manner, they put us in a new room and someone came right up to help us with our luggage in the middle of the night! It's so wonderful to go on a vacation where the entire staff of a resort is so happy and in a good mood! I just couldn't believe the Disney hospitality. I can't say enough nice things about Disney! The only negative thing I have to report is that Saratoga Springs could definitely use nicer towels and bed linens. The quality of these particular items seemed to be lacking. The bath towels were more like hand towels and the bedsheets & mattress cover kept coming off the bed every night due to its poor quality and poor fit for the bed. So, it goes without saying that I would return for another stay at Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa in a heartbeat!

<Title>“Wonderful View of Downtown Disney”
<Content>Saratoga was a different experience than what we have been used to at Animal Kingdom Lodge. Our first visit to Disney was in 1998 and we stayed at Old Key West. The next visit was in 2004 and we booked Animal Kingdom Lodge. It was such a wonderful experience (loved the people- Roberta Kroup, Bob at Concierge) that we booked there 2005, and twice in 2006. We tried to book there this trip but with the new Animal Kingdom Villas being constructed we could not get a room. We decided we would try Saratoga Springs- we brought 4 adults with us (our two sons and two friends). The accommodations were very nice but the view was outstanding 2 bedroom villa overlooking the water at Downtown Disney Marketplace (washer and dryer were nice-kept caught up on laundry). We stayed in a section called Congress Park and walked over there almost daily. It was a nice experience but not the same friendly experience at Animal Kingdom Lodge, the people were polite at Saratoga... but at Animal Kingdom Lodge you just feel at home. I would stay again at Saratoga... but only if I could not get accomodations at Animal Kingdom Lodge

<Title>“Great place!!!”
<Content>I booked this resort because we had 5 adults going away for a quick weekend. I chose a 2BR/2BA villa (1 king in master, 2 queens in second bedroom). This resort is huge! I was hoping for a villa in the "Congress Park" section, the one closest to the Disney Village Marketplace so we could walk there. Unfortunately, there were none available. We were put into the "Springs" section, garden view, actually it was a parking lot view. I have to say this was actually a good location. We were right across from the big pool, bus stop, restaurant/store and fairly close to the boat dock that took you to the marketplace and Disney west. We took the bus to the marketplace Saturday night. Took a while because the buses make a few stops throughout the property, so be prepared to ride for a while. We waited for around 30 minutes for the bus to arrive to take us back to the resort. Something you have to learn to live with if you take the Disney transportation. The villa was very nice. We had a handicap room, not out of necessity, that is just what they gave us. To me there is a lot of wasted space. There was a large foyer and tons of closet space. I think that space could have been added to the kitchen/dining/living area which was small. This villa would be perfect for a family with smaller children, they usually don't mind lying on the floor. We found there was not enough seating in the evening for all of us adults. There was a pullout sofa/sleeper that was the size of a love seat and one chair. Off to the side of the living area there was a booth-type dining room table with two small dining chairs. It was small and not really comfortable to sit on and watch TV and chat, good for a quick meal though. After a long hot day in the parks it would have been nice for each of us to have a nice comfy seat!!! This would be a great place for a family to save some money. The kitchen was well stocked with dishes and pots and pans and a trip to one of the local grocery stores could make things easier on the Disney food budget? It was a very nice place, we just wish it had a bit more comfortable seating in the living area... Maybe a loveseat/ sofa combo??? Also if you are staying for a week or so you might want to bring a small supply of dishwasher, dish and laundry soap. They do supply you with a small amount when you check in, but not enough if you are staying for and extended stay. They do offer more for a price but I am sure it would be cheaper to bring your own! I would stay again but probably only with 4 people!

<Title>“Perfect Disney Resort for Adults to Relax!”
<Content>My family was visiting for the Epcot Food and Wine Festival and I made a reservation for us to stay at Saratoga Springs for a few days. I knew that it was one of the newer resorts at Disney and that it had a good reputation so far and we couldn't have been happier with our stay. The grounds are beautiful and our room (a one bedroom suite) was both clean, beautiful and very well themed. The room faced a golf course and while none of us are golfers, it made for a very nice and relaxing view. The full-service dining location was nice but the dining room is very small and the menu seemed a bit limited. The quick service area was fine. We stopped there several times for snacks and drinks. While it is pretty big, we never waited in any long lines or had to wait for seats. For recreation, we hit the pools and had a great time there. They were both clean and very well kept up. My dad got a massage at the spa and really enjoyed it. For transportation, you can ride the boats over to Downtown Disney. We did this several times for dinner or just to walk around at night. The boats run regularly and we never had to wait long for one to arrive. The buses to the theme parks also run regularly, but honestly I would recommend driving you own car to the theme parks. Why? Because at the end of the day those buses are loaded down with tons of tired people and cranky crying babies. Your own car will provide a more peaceful end to your day in the parks. All in all, it was a great stay and I've already recommended this resort to lots of my friends. Since the resort is newer, lots of people seem to not know about it. They have no idea what they are missing out on.

<Title>“Beware Disney and Saratoga in June”
<Content>We, (myself, husband and four children) stayed in Saratoga Sps resort in June '07. We had been to Old Keywest Resort three years previous and enjoyed the accomodations as well as the service. This year we stayed at Saratoga Sps which is the "sister resort" and newer than Old Keywest. Saratoga Sps is much bigger than Old Keywest and more poorly run. We found the main area and pool of Old Keywest much less crowded and more manageable than Saratoga. The main pool area of Saratoga Sps looked like one huge city pool just crammed full of people...not something to look forward to on vacation. Also, if you needed anything it was hard to obtain it...whether it was a reservation or a new towel for your room. The main switchboard of Disney resorts would contact the front desk of Saratoga Sps resort and maybe, eventually you're request would be granted....very creepy. The parks, it being June, were extremely crowded....to the point where I wondered about the amount of people actually allowed in the parks for safety reasons. I know the Magic Kingdom years ago would allow only so many people in the park, not only for safety but comfort for the masses....now it's a free for all. Example: One day I took my older children to MGM at 9:00 am, we tried to leave the park at 12:30 pm and literally had to fight against a crowd streaming forward. It was shocking how many people were being shoved into the park. And don't be fooled by "fast pass". Unless you're devious enough to figure out how to get duplicate "fast passes" you're out of luck. We will not be visiting Disney or any resort in that area for a while. Believe me, if you're a half normal adult, you'll feel like you need a vacation and Disney detox after going through that debacle.

<Title>“Good place, but not the best”
<Content>We stayed here as DVC members for 6 nights with two kids in a 1 bedroom suite. Pros: We found the transportation to the parks to be very good. Most were direct nonstop tranports. I don't believe we waited more than 20 minutes for a bus any day. Most trips were less than 20 min drive each way. Great for viewing the firework shows from the resort. Beautiful pool that was not as crowded as other locations. Close to downtown Disney for evenings spent away from the park. Easy and close parking for our car. Location maked it easy to get out of the Disney complex to restaurants or activities in Orlando. Good size rooms that were attractive and very clean. Cons: Restaurant choices were limited. We like Wilderness Lodge much more. Wasn't as highly decorated as other resorts like Wilderness Lodge. Of course, this can also be a good thing. :) Other comments... I saw the concern of another reviewer with the bottom floor slider doors. This did not concern us at all. But I would agree this is not a business person's hotel. Mainly because I'd be miserable having to dress for work each day as I'm watching most people off for a day of fun.

<Title>“Wonderful Place to Stay”
<Content>My boyfriend and I went down to Disney for my birthday weekend in June. We flew in later in the afternoon and took the free bus transportation to Saratoga Springs. The staff at the aiport was very nice and helpful. I recommend taking you luggage with you instead of using the tags and having them take them to your resort. The bus trip was kinda long but it was nice not to have to worry about getting a car or paying for a taxi so we didn't care. Got to check-in and the front desk was great. She got us a closer room to the main building so we wouldn't have to walk as far. Also our building had the bus stop right outside so we could just go down stairs and hop on. The room was great, bed was really comfortable. We didn't have a remote for the tv though, but not a big deal as we weren't in the room but to sleep. The bus shuttles were really good and much better than the boat as the bus had A/C. I liked that it was so close to Downtown Disney with all the shops and restaurants. I just wish we were able to stay longer than the weekend it was so nice.

<Title>“Very Disney Hotel”
<Content>My son and I stayed at the Saratoga Springs in a Studio August 12-18th. I was very satisified with the accommodations. While not on scale with the Deluxe resort accommodations, the room was nice and exceptionally clean. It should be noted the accommodations are nicer than moderate resort accommodations. We stayed as a DVC member so the room was not scheduled for cleaning during our stay. It was scheduled for a towel and trash service which was not conducted. That's unfortunate for the cleaning service because there is no tip for no service. I was able to place the trash outside the hotel room door and it was picked up. Plenty of trash bags inside the cans. Our room was in the Carosel building on the second floor facing the bus stop. I thought it might be noisy but it was not. If we did not have a rental car, it would have been very convenient. The buses can take you to the main building next to the Springs bus stop, but it is faster, most times, to walk to the main building. The walk to the main building is about 5-7 minutes. The pool and spa services are terrific. The arcade is great when the kids are tired and hot and need to cool down. The pool was clean and there were games and other fun activities for kids and adults alike. My son especially enjoyed renting movies from the community hall and going back to the hotel room to watch them (a DVD player is included in every room). The resort property is very large. Many times there was a line at the cafeteria, which is smaller than that of the All-Start resorts. Saratoga Springs has at least as many rooms, if not more, than the All-Star resorts. Tables are smaller and not as prolific as with other resorts. The food was kept under warmers so it was sometimes a bit dried out. The registers for checking out/picking up merchandise and grocery are the same as those for food service. We had to consistently wait for counter service on average about 7 minutes. It used to be when you checked in, you could purchase your tickets and make dining reservations at the same time. We had to check in and then go wait in another line for the concierge to make reservations and add tickets to our key to the world. Not horrible but it would have been more efficient to handle everything in one shot. There was one group who was having difficulty with their reservation that required them to bounce back and forth between check-in and concierge. Saratoga Springs now has a second restaurant called the Turf Club Bar & Grill. I found it somewhat annoying some of the menu selections were the same as the menu selections at many other table service dining establishments. This restaurant serves steak and seafood as well as the Shrimp Penne pasta and the Angus Sirloin burger (staples at all table service restaurants). The prime rib was pretty good and the Top Sirloin was marvelous. The table service could have been more efficient though it was nice to have a different choice at the hotel we were staying. I would stay there again, however, it would get a one bedroom suite with a full kitchen. It is not be my first DVC resort choice though it is a very nice property with some wonderful amenites (kitchenette, kitchen & washer/dryer) that are not available at all Disney properties (though they are available at all Disney Vacatation Club properties).

<Title>“Really nice for family of four”
<Content>We just returned from six nights at the Saratoga Springs. I booked a two bedroom suite (with two bathrooms, kitchen, and washer/dryer) as part of a package through the Walt Disney Travel Company. After I booked, I read some less than stellar reviews here on TripAdvisor, but I must say that our family had a great stay and would recommend it to others on family outings. As has been said in other reviews, the place is quite large. We stayed in the Paddock section with a water view, which is about a ten minute (leisurely) walk across a lake bridge to the main buildings and large pool. There was also a smaller pool right next to our building, so we didn't have to hike if we didn't want to. The Artist's Palette offered decent "quick service" meals, and had a good selection of snacks and supplies for the refrigerator. We used the Disney Dining Plan, so the meals were included. The snacks and sundries were a bit on the expensive side, but no more than you might expect from a resort. (There is also a full-service restaurant called the Turf Club...we didn't get to try it. They have also started limited room service delivery of pizza and related items.) I think that getting around is quite reasonable without a car, as we never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a Disney bus. Having said that, we did actually rent a car, since we got a good deal from priceline.com. (As an aside, staying at a Disney property gets you free parking at all the parks.) We did not use the car to go to the Magic Kingdom as you park at the Ticketing and Transportation Center, so you have to take a tram to a monorail to get to the park. As a geographic reference, the Saratoga Springs is right next to the Downtown Disney area. In fact, from most of the property, you can reach Downtown Disney by a ten minute walk, a boat ride, or a five minute drive (including finding a place to park). Now for the room: very spacious and comfortable. King bed in the main bedroom and two queens in the second, plus a pull-out couch. Powerful air conditioning, as would be required of any place in that part of Florida. Minor detractions: sheets and towels were not the highest quality, but were perfectly adequate. Also, limited channel selection on the TV, but balanced by the DVD player in the room (and rentals available at the Artist's Palette). The kitchen was very well equipped - microwave, range, stove, dishwasher, full fridge/freezer, coffee maker. Some other reviews indicated that some staff members were rude and/or not knowledgeable. We did not find this to be the case at all. The staff was always polite and welcoming, and if I was able to stump someone, they always knew who to ask to get the right answer. Some also complained about the housekeeping and condition of the rooms - for us, housekeeping was always prompt, and the room was kept quite clean throughout our stay. (If you are a Disney Vacation Club member, the room gets linens and towels on the fourth day - if you are a "hotel-type" guest, then you get serviced each day. One morning, we stayed in late and kept the "do not disturb" sign out. The housekeepers called to ask when we'd like the room cleaned, and they held to our requested schedule.) So, while I can see that this might not be the ideal situation for the business traveler, for a family with a young child (or children), I would definitely recommend the Saratoga Springs when visiting Walt Disney World. (I withheld the fifth star basically because of the less-than-fantastic, but really not bad, quality of the sheets and towels. This is a minor inconvenience, but I would expect a bit more for the price we paid. Nevertheless, Saratoga Springs remains high on my list for the next time we visit.)

<Title>“Don't Do It!! And Not For Business Travelers!!”
<Content>I stayed at the Saratoga Springs Resort in August of 2007 when I was in town for a convention. This hotel was booked for me through work – I did not choose it. Several co workers stayed here as well, and from what I could tell, they all had the same opinion that I did. I would not stay here again. First, and this is not the fault of the hotel – DO NOT go to Orlando in August. It is miserably hot and humid and just unbearable. I don’t know how people even consider going to the parks this time of year. As for the hotel, there are Pros and Cons: PROS 1. Rooms have a little kitchenette with an (unstocked) fridge, and microwave 2. Rooms have a little sitting area 3. A/C worked well in the room (key since it was hotter than…….outside) 4. The pool looked nice, although we did not use it. It was very far from our rooms. CONS 1. This resort is ridiculously large. It is impossible to get around without a car, which we did not have. Upon check in they drove us (and our luggage) to our rooms on a little golf cart. However, they would not come get us to take us to the lobby after this. The first day it took us 10 minutes to walk to the lobby in our work clothes – we were sweating by the time we got there. After the first day we were smart enough to call for a taxi and ask them to come to our room. 2. Over half of the lightbulbs in my room were blown out. This is a simple maintenance thing that the maids should be checking and fixing. I should not have to call to request this. 3. Although there was a kitchenette, there was no dish soap, so I had no way of washing the dishes I used. 4. Sheets are scratchy, pillows hard, and towels are cheap. Think 1-2 star hotel amenities. 5. The fridge is unstocked, and there is only one little take out sandwich type restaurant (think pool bar) on property. 6. This was an “overflow” hotel for the Swan and Dolphin, however it is a good 10-15 minute drive from these other hotels – not exactly close. And there is no way to get a bus from one hotel to the other without going to downtown Disney and switching buses. Ridiculous. 7. They charge $9.95 a day for internet access (not wireless). In an age where most hotels offer FREE WIRELESS, this seems very outdated – just a case of Disney gauging you for everything they can. 8. They offer “express” checkout, yet they don’t deliver receipts until after 8 am the day of checkout. Not helpful if you have an early flight 9. $55 cab ride from airport 10. Ground floor rooms have sliders that just open to the outside - does not feel safe at all. I know the typical Orlando visitor is not a business traveler, so perhaps this hotel would be fine if you were there for pleasure, however, I think I still would have been frustrated with the size of the resort and the difficulty posed with trying to get around, and I did not like the feeling of being on a ground floor room with sliders to the outside - not even to a balcony. I would not stay here again.

<Title>“Very Nice Place”
<Content>The rooms are very nice and well kept. Our building where we stayed was located far from the lobby, however there are staff members who are constantly driving "limo-golf-carts" from one unit to another and you (plus your luggage) can catch a ride with them if you don't want to walk. Lots of different pools to choose from and the on-site grocery store is well stocked with everyday food stuff. Also, bus stops to the theme parks are just a short walk from your door. The staff was great and super helpful.

<Title>“At Disney Cheaper is better”
<Content>I have stayed at Disney's Contemporary, Carribean Beach, Boardwalk, All Star, French Quarter, and Pop Century. We took advantage of the recent $164 per night pus tax for a Studio room promotion. We stayed in the Grandstand 8101 section which was conviently located near a pool and the Store, registration, and central resort services. The room was excellent with a balcony and view of the pool area. If you are looking for a resort vacation where you will spend all of your time at the resort, golfing, pool side this is the place for you. If you are looking to spend most of your time in Disney Parks or activities at other Disney locations, this is not the place to stay. The boat and bus free transportation is deplorable. With 5 internal bus stops plan on 60-90 minute bus rides especially if you are going Downtown or Animal Kingdom which also have Water Park stops before the finally destination, add in time for loading and unloading at each stop and wheel chairs and you can only call transportation at this resort what it is - disaster. Forget about fast casual dining at the eat-in or take-out Artist Oallette. To call this a food court is quite laughable. For a resort of its size it has a single line counter service. To pay for food you get in lines with the general store. On a Magic Kingdom Magic hours night we left the resort from our bus stop at 11:21 and the bus stopped at a Magic Kingdom bus stop for us to offload at 12:32 a.m. For what we paid at this resort we could have paid half the price at a Value Resort and had convienent bus service and access to excellent food court counter service. For a single parent with a tween daughter who travels to Disney 2-3 times a year for 25-35 days, I was also not comfortable with how close guest vehicle parking is to the actual resort rooms. If you fly to Disney and use their free transportation from the airport to the hotel and rely on free Disney transportaton to get around Disney plan on spending most of your trip on buses when staying at this resort.

<Title>“Pure Disney”
<Content>This resort is beautiful. It is big but you can still walk around easily. We stayed in the Grandstand section in a one bedroom condo. The Grandstand has it's own pool with a water sprayground area that we didn't swim at but it looked great and was not crowded at all. A short walk away was the main pool area with two water slides (one is small for little kids) and another sprayground area. We did use the main pool and it was very nice although a little bit crowded. There is also a pool bar which was pretty expensive. I paid $15 for two drinks without the tip. The room was beautiful and very clean. It looked as though it was never used. It wasn't huge but there was plenty of room for us (3 adults and 2 children). It was great to be so close to Downtown Disney and we took the boat to go over for dinner two of the nights we were there. We loved the Raglan Road Irish Pub. We also took the buses to the theme parks and found them to be faster than we were expecting. And, we were able to stay in the theme park for 3 hours after closing since we were resort guests. Great perk! We ate at the resort at Artist's Palate and the food was okay but the easels to keep the kids busy was worth it. You can't beat Disney Quality or the perks you get for staying at a Disney Resort. This place is top notch.

<Title>“Beautiful rooms!”
<Content>Just got back from a six night stay at Saratoga Springs. It was a beautiful resort. Our one-bedroom unit was nicely decorated, very clean, and gave the five of us plenty of room. With the incredible heat and humidity I used the washer/dryer every day. We had daily maid service, which was above average. The quick service restaurant was good, and the mini grocery store had everything we needed. We were upgraded to this resort when they closed most of the Animal Kingdom Lodge (at a substantial discount). We didn't use amenities since we stayed at the parks all day. The buses were a bit crowded so we drove nearly every day. I don't know if we would choose this resort again simply because we want the convenience of being on the monorail next time (Polynesian, Contemporary, Grand Floridian). But if we were offered the same low rate it would be hard to refuse.

<Title>“Very nice kid-friendly resort”
<Content>We just returned from 7 nights at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa. The overall experience was excellent. I'll break it down the best I can. Check In: No problem. We arrived at 12:30 pm, and fully expected to just hang out at the pool until our room was ready at 4:00. Much to our surprise, our room was ready at 1:00, and the Desk staff was very friendly and helpful. Room: We had (2) Studio rooms. Each room had a queen size bed and full-size pull out sofa for sleeping. The beds were extremely comfortable (Sealy Posturepedic Encore 720 Plush mattress) and the pull-out was surprisingly comfortable as well. Each room also had a small table and 2 chairs. The bathroom is standard size, very clean. The sink was on the outside of the bathroom. There was also a mini kitchen (Small fridge, toaster, microwave, coffee maker). This came in very handy as each night we would freeze 5 water bottles to bring to the parks the next morning. The microwave was great for popcorn at night with the kids. Transportation: We saw plenty of buses throughout the resort; however we opted to rent a vehicle and drove ourselves everywhere. I highly suggest renting a vehicle; the convenience was well worth the added cost. Pool: The resort has (2) pools. A small quiet one and the main pool. The main pool sported a nice sized water slide, and kiddy slide. We used the large slide all afternoon with the kids. The entertainment group would also do poolside Bingo; one of my daughters won a game and was thrilled with a tinkerbell bank as her prize. Food: There are (2) restaurants on site. The Artist's Palette was excellent for breakfast donuts, bagels, etc, but their hot breakfast was sub par. The lunch was excellent every time. Nice selection of sandwiches, salads, etc. The Grill restaurant was very very good the one time we ate there for lunch. My wife had panned seared Tuna, I had steak, and one of my daughters had soup/salad...all very very good. We found the entire staff to be friendly, helpful and patient, despite the extreme heat and crowds. I would stay here again and highly recommend this resort to anyone.

<Title>“Not magical at Saratoga Springs !!”
<Content>Where do I begin !! Upon arrival we checked in and were greeted by a not so happy front desk clerk. My friend had stayed a month before and said I should ask for an upgrade if they have one.The answer was NO and she was annoyed that I even asked! She then showed me where our room was on the map which appeared to be in the furthest building from the main lobby(which is where the nicer pool with the only slide is )and the restaurant, ect. I politely asked if we could be in a building we could walk instead of drive and without checking she told me NO!! I asked for the manager who amazingly found a room within walking distance to the main pool.However,we still had to drive to the building to get to the room.Once in the room we saw one bed and a couch and wondered how this would accomadate 4 people? When we called the front desk they told us thats how all the suites were and the couch would pull out ,but you had to make up the bed and linens were in the closet !! So who gets to sleep in the bed? Should we draw straws? We then decided this hotel was not worth the money or aggravation and switched our reservation to the Beach Club within walking distance to Epcot. Loved it !! Stay away from Saratoga Springs unless your only 2 people in a room and you don' t mind staying where you have to drive everywhere . Also, you might have RJ check you in ,which would not be a fun experience !!

<Title>“Very Nice Stay!”
<Content>My family of six adults selected this hotel for our vacation this past July 4th. Although it does not have the ambiance of some other Disney properties, you will not be disappointed. We stayed in a two bedroom - two bath villa. The villa was spacious, very clean, and had magnificent views of Downtown Disney, which we requested prior to our stay. Housekeeping came promptly each morning and we came home to beautiful towel designs and a clean kitchen each evening. Although we spent most of the days at the parks, we did spend one afternoon at the main pool and quiet pool. There were plenty of lounge chairs and my husband enjoyed the water slide! When it began to rain, we visited the arcade where air hockey and basketball was free to counter the poor weather. We had lunch at the Artist's Pallete, which was exactly what you would expect for counter service. When booking this vacation, we debated between two hotel rooms and the villa to accommodate our party. I strongly recommend the villa and Saratoga Springs! Not only do you receive the same perks of free parking at the parks, free Disney transportation, Magic Hours, and the meal plan, you also have the kitchen which we used each morning for breakfast. I am sure we will return!

<Title>“Very nice hotel!”
<Content>We are Disney Vacation Club members and Saratoga Springs is one of the Vacation Club properties, although it is also open to the public. We have stayed in a studio, a one bedroom and a two bedroom unit. The furnishings are wonderful. The accommodations very comfortable. The quiet pools are very nice and the themed pool beautiful. Ask for a water or Downtown Disney view when checking in. Other views include parking lot and aren't as nice. Yes, there are two places to eat, but there are boats and buses over to Downtown Disney (which is just across a small waterway from Saratoga Springs) where there are many restaurants. You are also free to eat in any of the other resort hotel restaurants such as Polynesian, Grand Floridian, Animal Kingdom Lodge, or at any of the park restaurants, etc. Even if you are eating most meals out, we find the full kitchen or kitchenette to be wonderful. A great place for cold snacks, a bottle of wine, microwave popcorn and so on. Having the washer and dryer in the room is unbeatable if you are traveling with children and there are also free washers and dryers available to the studio rooms in a laundry room in each building. One big plus is that you can Self Park your car very close to your unit. We found that to be very convenient. We have reservations to stay at Saratoga Springs again this August.

<Title>“Clean and basic. Staff not helpful or friendly”
<Content>Stayed in a Studio room. Had a queen bed and a sofa bed which was quite comfy. Once the sofa bed is opened, there was not much room to move around. Had a mini kitchen with microwave, mini fridge and a toaster. The toaster came in good use for breakfast. The main lobby has a mini grocery store with the basic necessities such as bottled water, bread, spreads, junk food etc. Prices are marked up. There are no supermarkets within the disney compound near the resort so forces you to shop in their stores with the marked up prices. The staff were not very helpful or knowledgeable about the resort. No one went out of their way to help you and knew nothing about the resort transports....to the point where they start making things up. Some staff were quite rude. No house keeping (i thinkyou can requrest this) but they refill the household items (eg shower gel, towels etc) on the 4th day. The resort is massive but there are disney provided buses that take you around the resort. There are no timetables and buses are unpredictable - there maybe 0 buses for an hour and 3 buses that come at the same time. Buses take you to downtown disney and all the disney parks. Free of charge.. Overall, transport are quite inefficent - quite slow - but thats transport in florida for you. Around 20 mins to each of the parks. Epcot is the closest.

<Title>“First night (of 4) tainted our experience”
<Content>My husband and I booked a studio at Saratoga for four nights. We had been at a non-Disney hotel in the area for a work conference and thought since we'd never been to WDW a Disney hotel would be a great option to experience. We got there prior to check in and the room wasn't ready, so we took off for the parks. We returned around 10pm to check in. Upon entering the room it looked a bit worn, and it smelled like smoke. We thought perhaps it was simply a room that had been closed for awhile so just had an "unused" smell that would clear out as we began living in it. We unpacked and went to bed. I had difficulty sleeping because I felt like the linens were permeated with the smell and my husband reported the same experience. Around 2am, we had to call the front desk who sent up fresh linens and told me the room was a non-smoking room. (My hair was taking on the smell of the room and I couldn't stand it anymore.) The person who delivered was very courteous and quick, and then sprayed a lot of deodorizer in the room. The deodorizer gave my husband asthma and we sat out on our balcony until 4am until the room cleared--it was pretty toxic!. This did not fix the issue so we went to front desk immediately the next morning. Desk rep was very quick and professional and offered to have another room reserved for us, and hold another so we could inspect it before taking it. We returned to find she had found a room in the same building, which we found to be in much better condition and smell free. Apparently, the hotel went smoke free June 1st, and all the rooms were to have been "converted". ( Our first room was converted in theory only). Although the rest of our experience went well, that first nite put sort of a bad flavor into it. No sleep is not a good foundation to base a quick trip of Disney park-hopping. The buses ran well, although going to so many bus stops on the property was a bit tiresome. We used the laundry room and were very satisfied with the facilities. The main pool seemed over-crowded during peak hours. I'm not sure I would return to this property or not. I really WANT to like Saratoga, but the smoke smell really bothered me and truly skewed my view of the quality of accomodations and makes me very tentative about future reservations.

<Title>“if your room is not cleaned by 3pm call housekeeping & stay on the bus”
<Content>the room was smaller than we expected. we had booked a room with 2 beds, but when we opened the door, the room had a queen bed and a pullout sofa for two guys. we picked the hotel due to its proximity to pleasure island. the last bus back dropped us at the wrong stop. the grill had basic food, but we were allowed to combine the caesars salad & buffalo chicken strips. the hotel was pressure washing the buildings and vehicles parked 30 feet away ended up getting white washed. & last but not least, the reservations operator assured us that 1 pm would be ok, but the desk staff would not deviate from the posted times..

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay”
<Content>Our family booked (with a DVC member) a Studio at Saratoga Springs for 5 nights in Nov. 2006. We brought our niece along with our two children. We had stayed at the Board Walk Villas previously in a studio and toured Saratoga Springs at that time so we knew the size of the Studios. The studios are a good size for a family of 4 with young children that are willing to share the pull out sofa. I did not sleep on the sofa but my niece said it was comfortable. My youngest child slept in the pack and play crib. The room was very clean and the kitchenette (sink, small fridge, microwave, toaster, coffee maker) was stocked with glasses, paper plates and plastic utensils. The bathrooms are average size with the sink outside of the main bathroom. There is a large closet and one wardrobe for your clothes. The room is comfortable and well decorated. There is a pull-out sofa beside the Queen Bed (very comfortable) and a small table with two chairs. The resort itself is very large. We stayed in the buildings just off from the main pool. I thought the main pool was a good size but I could see it seeming small for the size of the resort at a busier time of year. My children enjoyed the waterslide and child's small water slide. The interactive water play area was not a big draw with my kids as they found the water cold. We spent a fair amount of our time on the resort at the one of the children's play grounds near a quiet pool. We were normally the only people there except when someone dropped in to do guest laundry or wait at the bus stop that was also set up near this area. The quiet pool had spitting frog statues that were on the first day we were there and the kids loved them but they were not on the next day. On the third day that we went to this pool area I used the phone in the washroom area and asked the Disney staff if they could turn the frogs on, within five minutes the frogs were spitting water again. We did not get a Disney meal plan but did eat at the Artist’s Palette once. It is a counter service restaurant and the food was very good. Just down from the main building are the boats to take you to Downtown Disney and there are all kinds of restaurant options there. I only used the bus transportation once during our stay but had to wait a fair while for one to pick me up at Downtown Disney that was going to Saratoga Spring's and I did notice that the wait at the resort for buses seemed long as we would walk by people waiting on our way to and from the pool. The grounds are beautiful and well kept. Our children enjoyed walking and running around and there was plenty of space to do that. We did not use the Spa or fitness centre. The children's program was terrific all of the kids (ages 10, 5 and 2) enjoyed it and we able to participate in something. The staff were very friendly and helpful at all areas of the resort. I would stay again.

<Title>“Great Experience at Saratoga Springs”
<Content>We were guests of friends at Saratoga Springs Resort and Spa and stayed in a 3 bedroom, fully equiped apartment. The rooms were large and the beds were very comfortable. The kitchen was fully stocked with all necessary equipment and we arranged for food to be delivered and put up which arrived shortly after room assignment. There were 4 bathroom in the apartment. The couch could have been made into another bed. There was a full dining room with large table. Televisions in every bedroom as well as the living room. A washer and dryer was also in the apartment. I noticed a laundry on the property for those units without in-home washers. There was only one glitch in receiving clean towels which the front desk handled promptly. The restaurants on location, The Artist's Pallette and The Turf Club served a very nice variety of food and the portions were generous and very tasty. The convenience of being able to walk to the close covered bus stop and hop on a bus to any of the Disney Parks was a true plus. The grounds were immaculate and the various swimming pools were well maintained. There is a golf course. The Spa services were excellent. I had an 80 minute massage which was greatly appreciated after traipsing through many Disney Parks. My entire stay was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend this property.

<Title>“Wow! Liked it so much we stayed an extra night!”
<Content>We started our WDW vacation off with 2 nights at All Star Movies (don't recommend), then went to Wilderness Lodge for 6 nights (love it!), then decided we just weren't ready to go home and went over to Saratoga Springs for one more night...which turned into 2 nights because we loved it so much! The grounds are beautiful and our one bedroom villa was immaculate. Other than a scuff or two on the wall, it was like we were the first guests to stay there. The villas are very spacious and beautifully decorated. The bathrooms are huge...toilet in one closet, large shower and vanity in another, a larger dressing vanity and garden tub in another. Just wonderful. We had a view of Downtown Disney, which was a 10 minute ferry ride or 20 minute walk away. My boys loved the main pool, which has a zero entry area, a couple of spas, a large waterslide, and a smaller one for the little kids. We spent our second day by the pool and ate our lunch (from Artist's Palate) poolside as well. I highly recommend Saratoga Springs if you are looking for a home away from home experience!

<Title>“Best Stay Ever!!!!”
<Content>We stayed here after being upgraded from the Pop Century hotel to an one bedroom suite. We go to Disney about every other year and now we can't think of staying anywhere else. This hotel was a short walk to downtown disney, which we walked to an couple of times. We found it very easy to get arount with disney transportation except one time. We were at Blizzard beach with our relatives and we left early to have more time at our hotel before leaving for dinner and we waited over an hour for an bus. Our relatives who were staying at Port Orleans left after us and only waited about an five minuetes. We were told this was because the hotel was newer and they didn't have as many buses yet. Other than that this hotel was great. The swimming pool was great and the kitchen worked out great because Disney doesn't have complimentary breakfast. We found this hotel very relaxing and the staff members very friendly. We loved how they greeted us with the saying welcome home. This was an memorable experience.

<Title>“Disney never fails to impress!”
<Content>My mother and I had a one bedroom villa at Saratoga Springs. It was the first time we had ever stayed in a "Home Away From Home" style resort at Disney, and we were very impressed! The room was immaculate, the resort was beautiful, and the spa was amazing! The only complaint we had was the lack of restaurants (at the time, they only had a quick service restaurant); however, the flatbreads they served at the quick service restaurant were amazing, so we did not complain too much! The price is a little high, but I think this resort was more than worth it!

<Title>“Disney's Saratoga Springs is a winner for our family!”
<Content>This past December (2006) our family checked into a one bedroom at Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort. The room was in great condition, clean, and has great furnishings. We liked: the great kitchen and living room, the master bedroom with a king bed and the great tub and shower; and finally the beautiful grounds. Our five year old son loved the themed pool and water slide. We also enjoyed walking the grounds. Nothing is far from the room, but the grounds make for great walking. We walked around the small lake near the Springs section. Our only negative was that on a few occassions the bus service was not as good as we have experienced in the past. We love Saratoga Springs and plan to return in November 2007.

<Title>“Great Location - Luxurious Resort”
<Content>We've stayed at numerous Disney property resorts and Saratoga Springs is our favorite. The on-site dining is excellent, and we found the proximity to Downtown Disney to be a huge asset. Bus trasportation was quick and efficient, and the resort was a perfect central location to all Disney parks and attractions. The resort has lovely, detailed walking paths and fabulous pools. This is a world class resort that feels more like a luxury spa vacation retreat than a theme park themed hotel.

<Title>“Restful retreat”
<Content>I stayed at Disney's Saratoga Springs with some of my family during March and was pleasantly surprised how relaxing it was. We anticipated huge crowds during a prime spring break week, but the resort is so spread out, that while it was very full, it never once felt overcrowded. The most crowded we felt was in the gym during the morning hours. It's a wonderful gym: plenty of cardio machines (ellipticals, bikes, treadmills and a few step-climbers) and also hammer machines, free weights and plenty of other equipment. I went a few times in the morning and there were 15-20 other people in there at once. It felt full, but I never had to wait more than a minute or two to use a machine I wanted. I went later in the afternoon on a few days, and there was only 1 or 2 other guests at that time. The gym is part of the spa facilities, but there is no charge for its use. We stayed in two rooms, both studios in the Congress Park area. The pool in Congress park was much smaller and simpler than the main pool, but lovely and never crowded. (The main pool is where you'll want to go if you have kids, and there are usually many families there, as well as snacks, bingo, etc.) The rooms were quiet on the inside (although the corridors echoed a lot) and our room was on the ground floor, so we had a small patio with two chairs. The studio rooms will sleep four, but they are pretty small for four adults and one of the beds is a full-size sofa-pullout. (Not nearly as comfortable as a bed, but not aweful and certainly fine for children.) There is a small fridge (but plenty big enough for milk, orange juice and a couple bottles of wine or 2-liter of soda. It's big for a mini-fridge), a microwave, coffee maker and they leave paper plates and bowls. Since this is a vacation club property, housekeeping does not come every day, so be prepared to use your towels more than once and make your own bed. (You can have daily housekeeping for an extra charge). We didn't mind every four days, but did wish we had paper cups instead of washing and re-using the same couple of glass cups and mugs. The resort grounds were beautiful and well kept. We played golf one day at Lake Buena Vista which is right on the same property. The course was short, well maintained and fun for a vacation course. The staff at the course (especially in the pro shop) was not great. Our reservation was not taken as it was booked (we had a reservation for four and a confirmation number). When we arrived we were told they only had us down for one player and the man in the pro shop acted as though we were a major pain in the neck and he was doing us a big favor to try and get us in. I understand confusion happens, but at Disney we pay for (and are accustomed to) a "No Problem" attitude. I remembered as we left the pro shop that another reviewer on this site had issues at the club as well, so this must be a common thing. The course was pretty full and we had groups in front and behind us the whole round, but that's common at a busy time so no big deal. The course wraps around Saratoga Springs and Key West resorts. Was fun to see that part of the property. For as much play as the course must get, the greens and tee boxes were in good shape. Just double check your reservation and be ready for less-than-helpful staff. We ate at the Turf Club during our stay and had good service and good food. You pay top dollar for a cheeseburger, but it's a resort. And it really is a very good cheeseburger. The ribs and pasta were good at dinner. Best to have a reservation so you won't have to wait. It's a short walk from Congress Park to Downtown Disney (10 minutes) which was great for other dining options and something different to do. To get to the parks the busses came right to the bus stop at Congress Park (and the other stops at Saratoga Springs) but we could easily get on a bus to the boardwalk or anywhere else by walking to downtown disney. In the main resort building there is a marketplace to get quick food, snacks, drinks and disney souvenirs. Tip: if you buy one of the tall insulated mugs you can refill it for free during your stay. They are $12 but worth it if you just want to have a coke or something to take to the pool with you. We didn't learn this until the last day, so we didn't get full use out of them, but it's a nice mug to take home anyway. Since we had been to the parks manytimes, we just wanted a place to be able to come and relax, enjoy a park for a day or two but spend the rest of the time just laying low and still have great service. This was a super place for that. There was enough to do on property to be entertained, and with such a quick walk to downtown disney we could choose whatever we wanted to eat. We enjoyed that convenience but also just the relative 'quiet' of Saratoga Springs and the great (nearly always) Disney service.

<Title>“Very nice resort”
<Content>My wife and I stayed in a studio for a week (March 3-10th) and had a great stay. We have stayed on property at Disney several times but we normally stay in a moderate resort. The Saratoga Springs was a big step up. The studio units have a queen size bed and a pull out queen size sleeper sofa. They technically sleep four adults, but I think they are really set up for two adults and maybe one or two small children. There is also a balcony and a kitchenette area with a counter, sink, microwave, regular size coffee pot, toaster, and a refrigerator. The room was very clean, very comfortable, and above all very quite. We stayed in the Congress Park area and were very close to one of the two quite pools on site, right across from a bus stop, about a five minute walk to the main pool and main building, and a ten to fifteen minute walk to the west side or downtown Disney. The grounds of the resort are very nice with courtyards, fountains, ponds and tributes to the famous horse racing city that it is named after. I live very close to the real Saratoga Springs and while this resort looks nothing like it, it is very beautiful place to spend a week or more.

<Title>“My New DIsney Favorite”
<Content>Overall EXCELLENT experience. This is now my #1 favorite Disney accomodation. Some points: We stayed in the "Carrousel" building and had a 1 bedroom suite with full kitchen. This property has elevators (not all Disney's other vacation clubs have elevators). Accomodations were lovely, comfortable, and new. Artists' Palette restaurant is okay; but for a quick meal we bought a frozen Tombstone pizza and prepared it in our suite. Basic food staples are not very expensive at the on-site store (I think the pizza cost $1.00 more than back home). For full grocery shopping, we went to Goodings (at the Crossroads shopping center). The grounds were lovely and the pool area(s) quite beautiful. Although the Saratoga has internet connection in the rooms, there is no business center (for those of us who DID NOT bring a laptop). We went to Disney's Coronado Springs Resort to use their business center ($10 for 15 minutes). For those of you travelling on a timeshare trade (like us) ... be aware there is no maid service. The staff comes by once midweek to empty trash, change towels, and provide additional bath products (TP, shampoo, soap, lotion & bath gel). Warning: Be careful if you pour shower gel in the whirlpool tub ... a little bit goes a LONG WAY.

<Title>“Loved this Hotel - something for everyone”
<Content>We booked Saratoga Springs for a last-minute trip to Disney World - we were so glad we did. We are not Disney Vacation Club members and we booked directly through Disney. We've stayed at Disney previously at Coronado Springs which I loved as a moderate resort. This is definitely several steps up! Saratoga is Disney's newest property and it is HUGE. Depending on what you are looking for, different areas will appeal to you. We stayed at the SPRINGS. It is across from the restaurants/main pool/grocery store/and fitness-spa. However, there is not a real view and it is a long walk to Downtown Disney (there's a path that you can either walk to DD or there is also a bus AND a boat that goes there from Saratoga). We loved being at the Springs, but if you want a quieter location, there are rooms for those people and if you want a view of the lake/downtown Disney be warned that it is loud, but the view is amazing. Call the hotel directly the week you are to arrive and ask them for your preference. The Un-Official Guide to Disney World points out specific rooms that are the best - so check that out. There are four bus stops scattered around the property so you are always close. In my opinion the only reason to stay on Disney property is the transportation. This hotel is 15 minutes from every park and is even closer to Downtown Disney. Buses start picking people up 2 hours before the parks open (and two hrs after park closes), so you will not miss out on anything relying on Disney transportation. We stayed in a 1-bedroom studio which had a full kitchen (with dishes, pots, everything), dining table which seated four (+ 3 bar stools at the breakfast nook). There was a 2-person hot tub, washer and dryer, master bedroom and a living room with a pull-out couch. there was also a small balcony with two chairs. If you are not a DVC member, you will still get daily maid service as well as dish-soap, and laundry detergent. There is also a safe and pack-n-play in these rooms. Elevators are a little difficult to get to from the rooms, so request a main floor room if you don't do stairs very well. This is a great resort for families or big groups because of these huge rooms (some can be combined together and there are others that are even bigger), but there was just the two of us and I thought it was quiet and romantic. If you need groceries, there is a small little store within the Artist's Palette. They've got cereal, eggs, soup, pizza, cheese, sandwich things, fresh fruit, chips, wine, beer, milk, and juice among other things. They also have Mickey Mac-n-cheese which I love. We had breakfast in the room everyday and got everything we needed at the shop. Saratoga Springs is themed after Victorian upstate NY and has an equestrian theme. The grounds are very pretty and we enjoyed going for walks around the property. However, it is not over-the-top Vegas-style Disney, so if you are looking for that, try a different resort. It is really quiet and even though they are still building one wing of the resort, you won't hear a thing and that wing is so far away from where you'll be you might not even realize there is construction going on. All in all, it was a great trip. We stayed for ten days all at Disney and the Disney parks. Highlight of the trip was the Keys to the Kingdom Tour and the Hoop-de-Doo Review. Finally, I just wanted to mention that we did the Disney Dining Plan. Oh my! You will eat all the time - just like a cruise. It was wonderful. There is no way a person could go hungry with the dining plan. We used two of our meals to do the Hoop-de-doo, Very slick. Happy travels to Disney!

<Title>“leave the golf clubs home!”
<Content>I have been staying at various disney resorts for about 20 yrs. Saratoga Springs is awesome, however, this time I brought my golf clubs...big mistake. Lake Buena Vista Course adjoins SSR so I figured I would play some golf. My tee-time (made 2 weeks in advance) was not honored. I was bumped for a corporate outing. When I complained to onsite management at LBV, guy walked away from me without apology or attempt to find me another tee-time... Bottom line. leave your clubs home....The golf course is so poorly managed that it casts a bad image on the whole resort. Instead.....enjoy the parks and restaurants with your family.. If you want to play golf go to Hilton Head or someplace where golf resort people are more friendly.

<Title>“So much Space... Well Located”
<Content>We originally booked a one bedroom villa at the Saratoga Springs for a week. It rained a lot during our stay, there was so much still to do and it was too cold for the coast so we decided to stay another week. Our original booking was through the Disney website and all the requests we made had been met on arrival. The "suite" was roomy and had all sorts of amenities: washer drier, jacuzzi, cooker, dishwasher, microwave, fridge- freezer, coffee-maker and a very comfortable spacious bedroom. Only criticism was that though there was plenty of draw space for clothes the closet was extremely small to hang clothes up. We would suggest that when booking you request the top floor as we heard the guests above quite regularly and the carpeting was not good in terms of noise insulation. The high speed internet connection at $10 per day was adequate. The total experience was well orchestrated, the staff pleasant and helpful but don't expect any flexibility with special requests like late check outs. Buses to the theme parks were frequent but we used our rental car. As Disney guests we had free parking and transfer from the parking lots to the park entrance was very efficient. The restaurants at the hotel were Ok if a little uninspired. However there were plenty of options near by and in Downtown Disney ,which could be reached on foot, by bus or car. All in all an enjoyable, if expensive stay, given the poor weather. The theme parks are really something special.

<Title>“Made me feel healthy”
<Content>We were there Dec 3rd through the 9th. Our trip was an extended family trip with a total of 10 people (kids were 5 to 11). We stayed in a grand villa in the congress park section. The resort is spread out but I think that was the idea. I mean the whole saratoga / horse / health thing seems to make sense that they want you to think about health and also you are going to get some exercise. I liked the spead out resort. The exercise facility is rated as the best in Disney. It is sweet. Nice wide walkways to walk around the resort on. The room was beautiful. The beds were comfortable. The kitchen was very good. The surround sound system for the TV worked. I brought a few movies so we could have the kids wind down with a DVD in the evening. The location was great. There was always room in the hot tub and usually you were the only person / couple there in the evening. A little idea for you that our group of kids loved. The Grand Villa has a balcony. I bought a paper airplane book that comes with the paper and directions for like 15 different styles of airplane. First they never knew you could fly so many different shaped objects. But second, they played for like 3 hours one night just folding and tossing them off the balcony and then heading downstairs to retreive. The 11 year old was so excited he pretty much coordinated teaching all of the younger ones with how to make them. Immaculate would be a good word to describe the landscaped areas of the resort. The theme pool (High Rock) was perfect for the kids. The slide was great. We only had limited time to play in the pool though because it was go-go-go to see the parks. Congress Park is closest to the Downtown Disney (DD) area. You can walk or take a boat there. We walked around the lake to reach DD several times to shop or eat. The boat ride across the lake to DD was nice but for our room location, the boat ride ended up being the same amount of walking as if we just walked around the lake in the first place. But the kids liked the ride so we did it a few times. I cannot say enough about the irish restaurant in DD (Raglan). I know... my wife said what you just thought, too (Boiled Food?). But I like a nice pint of Guiness and was in the mood to experiment. You're all wrong. My wife even agreed with me that it was the BEST meal we had on the vacation. And I don't mean good for irish food. I mean just plain old great food. Go with the specialties. The appetizer that comes with the forks sticking vertically out of the wood lazy susan was great.

<Title>“our stay was great!”
<Content>We had a 2 bedroom that worked perfectly for us, 2 adults, a preschooler and a toddler. The adults in one room and the kids in another! It was great having a fridge and a washer and dryer. Alright, so here's the real scoop on this hotel. There are TWO places to eat at this resort, the Artist Palette and Turf Club Bar and Grill. The Artist Palette is a grocery store type place, gift shop and "fast food type place"(flatbread pizza, sandwiches.). I ordered a medium steak at the turf club and the steak could have said moo! Ask for medium well. Yes, they do have construction in the very far back of the resort off to the side. They have MANY buildings away from that area. I think that area is called carousel.(MAYBE) We never waited that long for a bus, maybe 10 minutes. Except for one day---we waited 25 minutes to go to Animal Kingdom. It's a far drive in between locations. The room itself was great, it had everything, dish soap and laundry detergent included. We had a good experience overall and would definately go back.

<Title>“nice resort....saratoga springs”
<Content>We stayed at SS in May of 2006. We really enjoyed ourselves in our one bedroom villa which comfortably slept the five of us (three kids) . Two slept on the sofa bed. One in a portable crib. It is a new resort with top notch furnishing ....the villa even had granite countertops!! The pool was great ...lagoon style with slides for the kids...and kiddie slash area...hot tubs...and in close proximity to the one restuarant they have. We had lunch by the pool one day. It is close to Downtown Disney. Beautiful grounds. The only problems....when we were there construction was still going on (though we never heard any noise from it) and there is only one restaurant (cafeteria style) and we didn't have the warmest reception at the front desk....and my camera battery charger was left in the room and when It took several attempts on my part to get a response....which was ..."nope we don't have it". Though, those things in no way spoiled our trip.

<Title>“Great Resort”
<Content>Took the family consisting of Wife, 3 kids and my Parents to Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort December 16th thru the 22nd. We loved this resort! Stayed in a 2 bedroom Villa. Had plenty of room. (Could have used a little more drawer space). Villa was in top condition. Grounds are beautifully lanscaped and pool was large and had a great waterslide for the kids. Spent 2 days at the resort without going to the parks because the two oldest kids requested it (ages 16 and 4). There was no housekeeping as this is a Vacation Club Resort. (Standard for most timeshare properties) This was not an issue as we spiffed up the place before leaving every day. Counter service dinning option was great, with unique items like flatbreads and other choices a little more sophisticated than burgers and hot dogs. Service was excellent. Bus service was great to the Theme Parks, and only had a wait of 20 min (our longest) Most waits were around 10 to 15 min. Grounds are extensive with lots of activities. I would recommend this resort to anyone! A little on the pricey side, but top quality. You will not be dissapointed.

<Title>“Great place!!”
<Content>My daughter and I had a wonderful stay at the new Disney Saratoga Springs resort. It's a vacation in itself. In fact, we only went out to the theme parks 3 of our 5 days there. We had a studio room on a ground floor with a patio and easy access to the quiet pool, laundry and bus top. The resorts perks are a community hall, where you can play ping pong, various video games and do scheduled crafts and activities, great for kids! Also the pool has a great slide and the water temp was perfect. Also, we rented bikes and rode over to Old Key West and along the river there. Very scenic and relaxing. The decor of the rooms and the design of the resort are beautiful. Various birds and waterfowl added to the beauty. A couple of drawbacks are the size of the resort. We were happy with the location of our room, but I could see how some locations would be very inconvenient to geting to the main bldg. to eat or main pool to swim. They do have an internal bus that takes you from area to area in the reort, didn't try this, might be a good option. The only other minor issue was the variety of foods availalbe in the food court. No burgers, fries. They had a chickn strip meal with chips, a few varieties of salads and flatbread pizzas. I like the food but my 11 year old is used to regular pizza, burgers, spaghetti, etc. We visited downtown disney quite a lot as the bus stop was right outside our door and then we would take the ferry back. The bus ride on the way back is quite long since they have to make a few stops, so I recommend the water taxi since it goes to Saratoga first then OKW. We never waited more than 10 min for a bus to the parks We had the dining plan and it was worth every penney. We tried a few new dining experiences this time because it was affordable with the dining plan. I will review those under dining. This was one of our favorite disney vacations over the years and i feel a lot of it can be attributed to Saratogra Springs resort and their wonderful cast members.

<Title>“resort was a dream”
<Content>we have just returned from a week in ss. It is our home resort and it was our first time in our "home away from home". we also took my sister-in-law and her husband. It was so quiet and it was very clean. our first night we walked over to the boat and cought it across to downtown disney for a well earned drink. when we got up in the next morning we turned the wrong way out of our apartment block and came to a gate, it was not the main one. it is at the end of buena vista drive and it is also a two minuite walk from downtown disney so from that night we walked to downtown, it was so much quicker than having to wait for the boat and if you do not have a car it is a good idea when booking in to ask for an apartment near that exit so you can just walk round there and get the bus, rather than waiting for the ones in the resort as they only come every 20 mins. it was the best week ever. we have been to orlando 3 times now and buying our points was the best thing we ever did. 10/10 for disney. we also did 'mickey 's very merry christmas party' not recomended. far too busy and not worth the money.

<Title>“Best vacation ever”
<Content>The stay was wonderful. I brought my dad his wife and my 2 daughters ages 13 and 18. We had a wonderful time. Having the buses pick us up at the resort and bring us to the disney parks were GREAT and convienant. The whole time we were there we did'nt have to rent a car. It was great. The only negative thing was the price. A 2 bedroom condo was $800.00 a night.

<Title>“A tranquil spot near all the action”
<Content>We are seasoned Disney travellers, being part of the Vacation Club, but this is the first time we have stayed at Saratoga Springs. The resort is fantastic! The location is superb (our apartment had a view over Downtown Disney) but is far enough away to be peaceful and quiet. The pool area is great for relaxing by and is far more tranquil than some of the other noisy pools in the Disney complexes (although we did come across another pool near the main reception area that had slides etc and loads of noisy kids!). Being a couple that go to Orlando to relax, shop, eat and drink, Saratoga is perfectly located to do just that. The rooms were gorgeous, as expected, with excellent facilities. There was one little gripe - our bathroom smelt of smoke all of the time and this (according to housekeeping) is down to poor ventilation and our neighbours smoking in their bathroom. Disney - you need to look at this!! Apart from that, relax and enjoy.

<Content>Just returned from our first stay here on 1 bedroom apt in The Paddocks. It was brilliant couldn't fault anything really. The Arists Palatte is excellent for the odd meal and we had a great steak in the Turf Club. Staff were very helpful only complaint was some of the reception staff do not have english as their first language and this caused problems. When we were out there also visted Disney Vero Beach but much preferred Saratoga Springs.

<Title>“Disney Magic and a perfect vacation for all ages”
<Content>My husband and I are members of the Disney Vacation Club just returning from a 12 day stay at the Disney's Saratoga Springs for the first time. All we can state is "beautiful"! The one bedrooms in the DVC Resorts (as their other accomodations also) are comparable to none. The pools were usual Disney - clean, warm, and attractive surroundings. The grounds are gorgeous. The Turf Restaurant on the premises was excellent as was The Artist's. The staff were all very attentive. Everyone on the premises we spoke to seemed quite pleased. May I add we are seasoned travelers! We can't wait to return with our grandchildren!

<Title>“Disney Magic In Every Way”
<Content>Saratoga Springs Resort is a wondeful, lovely, relaxing resort filled to the brim with Disney Magic. We stayed in a clean, roomy, well appointed two bedroom unit with a balcony view of Downtown Disney. The walk to the pool took around 5 minutes and well worth it because the layout of this resort is wonderful. Everywhere you look are trees, gardens, water features and paths. While some complain the resort is spread out that is what makes it so wonderful. If you want a Holiday Inn with indoor corridors and crappy resturants this is not your place. The theme of this resort includes heath so it makes sense that the resturant serves healthy fare, the fitness center is a feature and walking is a part of the magic. I will stay here again and again. We visit twice a year and this is our favorite Disney resort now.

<Title>“Satisfactory place, but needs work”
<Content>I stayed at this reort 9/28-10/2 in the Paddock section. I had a three bedroom unit. I was traveling with wife, 2 young children, and parents (one who uses a walker) Positives: 1. The 3 bedroom units are nicely decorated and very large. 2. The airport check in near the concierge is great. 3. The convenience to downtown Disney 4. Awesome gym with all state of the art equipment, very large space. 5. Lockerooms for gym have nice jacuzzi and steam room 6. Restaurant is more formal and reminded me of eating at a golf course club or similar. Food was decent Negatives: 1. Facility is too large. It is not easy to navigate the site and they should consider renting golf carts to guests. Also walks to rooms is far if you have any disability or carrying children. 2. Food service at Artist Palette (cafeteria) is slow and choices are not great. They should consider selling a light menu by the pool in stead of just cocktails. Continually had to wait to have my order taken and also cashiers at checkout took a long time. 3. Longer distance to get to parks 4. DId not seem to have the personal touch My favorite facility is Old Key West. It has a blend of Disney without being over the top. Landscaping is nice and food choices are good at Key West. NOt a great gym at Key West though.

<Title>“Great Resort!”
<Content>We've stayed at Saratoga Springs Villas on at least 10 occasions since they opened and have had a great experience each time. We only live about an hour away and frequently request Saratoga Springs for our little one or two night 'getaways'. They've just recently (July 1) opened a new restaurant, The Turf Club, which is a nice alternative to Artist's Palette. AP has flatbread pizza, wraps, & a fair variety of 'precooked' food which is good for families with kids or folks not on a sodium reduced diet. The Turf Club has steak, seafood, & a few other options (limited, but all excellent) and is quiet, with excellent service & bgm (Vivaldi & friends). If you want a wonderful (big) hamburger - this is the place. There are at least 3 pool areas - 1 main which has special fun for kids then there are 2 'quiet' pools that are basic, but still nice & refreshing after a long day in the parks. All rooms have nearby parking (which is not the case at Beach Club, Boardwalk, or Wilderness Lodge Villas) and all non-ground level rooms have elevator access (not the case at Old Key West). Being a Disney Vacation Club property, all accommodations have at minimum in studios - a small fridge, microwave, queen bed & sofa bed, toaster, coffeemaker, hairdryer, and free access to laundry facilites (not in room). 1 & 2 bedroom units have full kitchen w/dishes, cookware, & utensils, king bed, whirlpool bath & sep shower in master bedroom and each unit has washer dryer combo. If you request "Congress Park - Downtown view" - usually they'll accommodate you (they do try - but it just isn't always possible) and it's nice to see Downtown Disney/Pleasure Island all lit up at night. Also, it's an easy walk from the Congress Park area to DD. Saratoga is built on what used to be the grounds of Disney Institute and all of the accommodations are new. However, the building in the commons areas (including great spa!) are rehabbed from DI days and still quite nice. As with all Disney Vacation Club properties - is usually immaculate, the cast members friendly, and convenient to Disney attractions and very kid/family friendly. For the internet dependent, there is high speed internet access for about $9.95 a day (hardwire - and Disney supplies the cable). I'd recommend this for anyone. We sent a newly wed couple there for there wedding night and they had a wonderful time! Even us 'oldieweds' with kids enjoy the place - it is Disney!

<Title>“Loved the Saratoga Springs”
<Content>We just returned from a six night stay at the Saratoga Springs. I can't say enough good things about this resort. The staff was professionsal, helpful and courteous. When we arrived, the lady at the front desk took the extra time to tell us about the location of each of the rooms available. We took a room on the 4th foor, facing Downtown Disney, in the Congress Park Section. The room was better than I expected: spacious and immaculate. We even got to check in early. It was a ten minute drive to Publix to pick up groceries. The only negative was the Artist Palette. I only ate there once but I really did not like the food. We walked to Downtown Disney every other night. for dinner. It was less than a ten minute walk. As we walked along the lake, we really enjoyed the walk. I highly recommend this resort.

<Title>“Thumbs up!!”
<Content>My wife and I are frequent Disney travelers and this is my favorite place to stay on property. I feel that some of the people who write these negative reviews wouldn't be happy with a free stay at The Plaza. I will admit that the resort is a little spaced out and yes there is some walking involved, but miles of walking is on your agenda while at Disney and we could all probably use it. The overall cleanliness and beauty of this resort is second to none and the staff is exceptional. If you havent seen the gym or spa, it is just amazing. The location is very convient to Pleasure Island, Downtown Disney and The Marketplace. Usually no longer than a 10min. wait for a bus. Clean pools and you have a choice of the main pool or several quiet ones. LBV golf course is on site and adds a more resort feel as opposed to Disney animation, which is what we like. You will find other Disney hotels with that animated feeling and that's good if thats what you're looking for and you will still have the quality that Disney offers. But for us, Saratoga Springs Resort is perfect. (A bottle of wine on the path at night while looking at the Downtown Disney lights is nice too!).

<Title>“Great Disney trip!!”
<Content>We visited the Saratoga Springs Resort as a guest of friends who own a Disney Vacation Club through them. We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa. The rooms are very clean and had many amenities. Our room had one bedroom with a King bed and its own bathroom with a nice shower and a separate jucuzzi tub. The second bedroom had two queen beds and a vanity area with two sinks and a bathroom with a combined shower and tub. We found the beds to be very comfy! The living room had a pull out couch and a small kitchen area with a full fridge, oven, micorwave, coffeee maker, and dishwasher! As an FYI, housekeeping does not come everyday. But thats because it is Disney's version of a time share. If you stay for a week, they come once in the middle of your stay. You may also purchase extra maid service visits. I think it was pretty cheap to have this- but Im not sure as we didn't need to request it. We only ate at the Artists Pallet. The food was very good. I found the prices to be rather reasonable for a resort. The pool area was great. Very relaxing. They have a bar area that serves great drinks.They were about $9 in the souvenier glass and around $7 without. There was a fun waterslide as well. Also, plenty of lounge chairs. There was also a second pool that was closer to our room. This one didn't have a bar or as many chairs, or a slide- making it a much more quiet pool with a lot less children. Downtown Disney is a boat ride away, as well as a walk away. But the walk took us about 10-15 minutes as you wind around a path. it made for a nice walk- but I can see how the boat might be easier if you have children with you. The hotel has a shuttle to all the disney parks. I'd say they would come every 20 minutes to half hour. There isn't a schedule so its luck when you only have a couple of minutes to wait. Overall we were very pleased with our stay and wouldn't hesitate to go back!

<Title>“Had a wonderful stay”
<Content>We just returned from Disney World. We stayed for 5 nights at the Saratoga Springs resort. The resort was very clean and the people were very nice and helpful. It took us 10 minutes to check in. We had express check out, so our bill was on our door in the morning. Everthing was correct so we just left without having to go to the front desk. The rooms were very spacious and clean. We had a two bedroom villa. It was wonderful not having to go home with a weeks worth of laundry for four people. The cleaning service was offered everyday if we wanted. A basket of towels and toiletries were put out side of our door every morning if needed. The most we ever waited for a bus was 10 minutes. We stayed in the Paddock, I would recomend it highly. We took advantage of the Extra Magic hours offered to the Disney Resort guest and did not wait in any lines longer than 10 - 20 minutes. Since these extra hours were at night we did not have to put up with the heat of the day. During the day we would do the water parks and Disney Quest. The Disney Dining package is wonderful. There is no way you can eat any cheaper than that. We had 1 snack, 1 counter service meal and 1 table service meal a day. You can use them however you want. You can not beat the price!! I have to say this was probably the best Disney Vacation we ever had!!

<Title>“Dad, You Shuold Have Been There. . . .”
<Content>Saratoga Springs is as expected; beautiful, well built, and nice to stroll around. Disney has kept to their typically high level of standards on the grounds of this new resort. Antiques tucked away for viewing in quiet corners, whimsical paintings where we know to hunt for hidden Mickey's and are never disappointed, and a lovely reception building with a great and helpful staff. All in all I really like the Disney Resorts, but while Saratoga Springs is pretty, it's nothing 'special'. The theme doesn't pull you in like Old Key West, or the Wilderness Lodge. I wouldn't be unhappy staying here again, but it is not my first choice when I do. Let me say the staff is the reason I bought my DVC membership. I expect and receive great friendly service consistently from the concierge to the sweepers. I never leave their property unhappy. The pool is nicely decorated. Plenty of lounge chairs and tables, the water slide is fun and the hot springs are cute. There are two hot tobs to relax in, which I highly recommend to get those muscles ready for another day of walking! We rented a one berdroom apartment for four nights. I requested and was given a room on the third floor (the building has a central elevator). It was very nice, impeccably clean with everything you could need to relax and be comfortable. The jacuzzi was used everyday, the shower was great with steaming hot water and a shower massage, in spite of three people using it consecutively. There was even a laundry line to hang delicate items on. I am glad Disney has finally put hair dryers in all their hotel rooms. As usual the one bedroom rental also has a washer and dryer (unfortunately it was very loud so don't plan on washing at night while you sleep) a seperate toilet room, and a fully equipped kitchen The living room had a very comfortable pull out couch, which cannot be closed properly with the linens on, so it was in the way as we were unwilling to commit to remaking it every day after hiking through the hot parks. So we walked around it. There was also a dvd/cd player as well as an oversized TV. Of course the California king bed was large, but I cannot understand why Disney does not choose better linens, it's not as if they have trouble renting out their rooms and they charge and arm and a leg, you don't get maid service everyday so why have sheets that are below the standard of a resort such as this? And what's with the hard foam pillows? I recently stayed at the Omni, now those were sheets and pillow (down)! And they even provided bathrobes. That is my only real complaint. My kid's and I enjoyed eating at the on site 'cafeteria'. The staff was helpful and friendly and the food was good. We did not eat at the bar and grill, but since there is only one kitchen, one would assume the food is the same good quality standard. There are several nearby grocery stores, but I recommend you head for Publix. The gourmet shoppe at the CrossRoads, the place across from the Buena Vista entrance, is ridiculously expensive.

<Content>We belong to DVC and this was the first time we ever booked a three bedroom. We invited two other couples to come along and we were like 6 kids for 7 days. The rooms were so big and clean. The only disappointment was the store was small for the facility. I could not find some of the things we wanted and had to get them from another resort. Other than that it was great. We used the Disney Magical Express and it was terrific.

<Title>“Not worth the price at all! Horrible service”
<Content>We stayed at the Saratoga for the last two days of our stay at disney. Check in was extremely slow, staff was not friendly. Was told they would call my cell while we were at the park to let us know when are room was ready. Never happened. It was almost four O'clock and I called room still not ready. After a long day at the parks you are ready for a fresh up in your room. Had to call three more times before room was ready. Get to room, smelled like wet dirty socks. Crud all over the tv screen. I immediately called to a maid that was nearby and she was apologetic and told me to call the front desk as she wasn't the one who cleaned the room. Called front desk was told someone would come clean while we were out to dinner, nope didn't happened called front desk when back from dinner explained that we needed another room, was told she could have someone bring the key or that I could come down to the front office and pick up a new key. I drive down and I waited at least 25 mins in line before being waited on then nothing was notated that I even called down to change rooms. Finally get new room get luggage and kids over to new room and it was filthy as well. There were still balloons in the room that other patron must have left behind, finger prints all over the tv screen crap on the counter by sink. For the amount they charge non florida residents 400 plus a night, its a total scam! I was pissed paying the florida resident deal 159.00 a night. The cleanliness and wear and tear in the rooms reminded me of a cheap stay at a 69.99 a night hotel. I would be cautious when staying here. The only good thing about the hotel was the kids enjoyed the slide at the pool, but even that was very crowded no matter what time we ventured over.

<Title>“We love it!”
<Content>We recently bought into the Disney Vacation Club and this is our "home resort". We stayed for 6 days here in a two bedroom and absolutely loved it. Having a washer and dryer is a major plus for us when traveling with our two toddlers. We had a room in the Paddock area and had no problems with anything. I know a lot of complaints from previous travelers have been the distances to get around to the pools and the lobby areas etc, but we found the walks to be nice especially since the landscaping is so nice. Our only complaint would be to have a bigger restaurant on site or more selections at the Artist Palette place. Other than that we will be back again and again.

<Title>“Saratoga is good for families”
<Content>Stayed at the Saratoga for a week with 2 adults and 4 teenagers in a 2 bedroom 2 bath unit in the Congress Park section. The room itself, a 2bedroom 2bath was terrific. Spacious, great beds, good views and the washer/dryer was a huge benefit. Internet is $10/day and TV channels are limited to mostly Disney and Disney Owned Networks...really annoying in a nearly $600/night unit...particularly when they greet you with "Welcome Home" in the lobby... but not unexpected. Our location was perfect on the property if you like to walk to Downtown Disney instead of taking the boat or a bus. There was a nice quiet pool nearby. Small kids would prefer the main pool locations near the main lobby. The property is really spread out and more units are under construction. Picking the right location for your particular needs at Saratoga is important. The walks around the property can be quite lengthy...no big deal, unless it's raining! and to get to any restaurants or parks you mostly are riding buses. There is a small but really good food counter (Artist's Palette) on the property but getting there from most units on the site is a hassle and we only did it once. Just wasn't worth the hassle of walking there. The store is sparse, but adequate. Disney property bus service left us waiting as long as 35 minutes three different times to get to different parks...but this isn't unique to the Saratoga. We had various problems with the front desk resulting in lengthy check ins and check outs (an hour each even though it was uncrowded) and the luggage pickup was nearly a half hour late on departure. If I didn't keep calling, not sure if they ever would have shown up. And be aware that they do not announce Magical Express from the lobby nor can you see the buses like you can in other Disney hotels. We almost missed the bus because of this... waiting inside for the bus instead of outside in the rain. And the luggage nearly didn't make it on the bus because the porter put it in the wrong location. If my wife hadn't spotted the cart just before the bus left, it would have left without our luggage...so watch your luggage if using Magical Express or other transportation and the bell service at Saratoga. In summary, we probably will return to one of the hotels onsite for future visits even if it means multiple rooms and higher cost for the convenience, amenities and service of a hotel but if you are looking for large spacious and really comfortable accomodations with a washer/dryer and kitchen in a quiet location on Disney property...and want to keep an eye on your kids, then you will enjoy the Saratoga. And having a car with you is a plus.

<Title>“Loved It All”
<Content>We spent 14 magical days at this resort. Our studio was in The Paddock and was on the ground floor, it was easy access to the bus service, and less than one minute to a small swimming pool, which was almost like our own private pool. We loved everything about this resort, it was peaceful, relaxing, and had every amenity that we wanted. The studio was extremely well equipped with a microwave, fridge , dishes and cutlery etc. etc. For the first time ever I did our washing whilst away as there was such a handy launderette at the swimming pool area. It was free to use and had everything necessary for a full wash and dry. The staff in every department were charming and only wanted to make our stay happy in every way. The Pallette Restaurant had a lovely atmosphere and my only slight criticism was the lack of variety of dishes on the menu. But we were able to purchase a wide range of commodities to snack on back at our studio. We enjoyed it so much that we are looking forward to a return visit.

<Title>“What a wonderful place, but a couple of bits of advice”
<Content>After signing up to the DVC last year, we have just returned from a wonderful 14 day vacation at the Saratoga Springs, and I an't wait to get back next year. We stayed in a studio, which was perfect for my Husband and I. It was wonderful to wake up and have your first cup of coffee sitting out on your balcony overlooking a peaceful lake!!! Although the hotel isn't far from Downtown Disney, we weren't bothered by any noise, light etc. and in fact we found it beneficial as we could get a bus to the Marketplace at Downtown and have a 10 minute walk back to our accomodation. Very useful if you are going to or from another resort for dinner. My main advice would be: If you are staying in a studio, the kitchens aren't too well equipted. I suggest taking a sharp knife for cutting cheese, etc. and some scissors. For international travellers DO NOT make international calls from your room. The rates aren't advertised and we called the UK twice from our room, only for a few minutes each, and they charged us $50.99 each call. If you want some rest and relaxation by the pool, don't use the main Springs pool, as it gets very crowded, the others are a lot quieter for adults or young families. Don't pre-book your groceries before you go. The selection in the shop is a lot better and much much better value. Finally, may I suggest that you consider taking Disney up on their dining plan. It is great value and after 14 days, we would have spent another $380 if we had paid individually for what we had.

<Title>“Good Stay at Saratoga...still room for improvement”
<Content>First let me say that Saratoga Springs ia a beautiful, picturesque resort on Disney property. My husband and I stayed in a studio for 4 nights in late March. We were in The Springs which was near the pool and main building. Our rooms were nice, new, and most importantly clean. This trip was just for relaxation (we only went to the parks once) so Saratoga was perfect for this. However if you are doing the park thing everyday, particularly sith smaller kids, you may want to stay elsewhere as Saratoga Springs is a little out of the way. I did a spa paskage one day and must say it was incredible. We are frequent travelers so I have visited many spas and this was truly one of the best (i think it is much better than the one at the Grand Floridian.) Now for what could be improved: 1. Larger beds needed in the studio. The studios only have a double bed and if you are used to a Queen or King, you will notice the smaller size. 2. I agree with previous posters ~ this place needs a full service restaurant. Artist's Palette (the only restaurant on property is counter service. Yes you are close to Downtown Disney, but it would be nice to have a better restaurant at the hotel. This is a large hotel and I guantee the restaurant would always be packed. 3. The restaurant should open before 7:30 a.m., particularly during peak season when the parks open early. 4. Prior to 4:30 p.m. the boats to downtown disney only run every hour and htey should run more frequently. Yes you can walk, but depending where your room is at Saratoga it can be a very long walk (particularly in the heat). Note is you want the shorter walk, request a room in the Congress Park section of the resort. Overall we had a nice stay, and this is a very nice resort. However as DVC members we will probably return to the Beach Club or Boardwalk on our next trip.

<Title>“Our first time in a WDW resort....”
<Content>This was our first time staying inside a WDW resort. We were there from 3/12 to 3/16. I went with my daughter (7 yrs) and my sister and her two kids (1 and 5). We checked in at 8:30 am (we were already prepared for them to tell me the room wouldn't be ready until 3 pm but she gave us a room right away when we checked in. When we got to our room (6th floor), the room was not cleaned yet. I called the front desk and the lady on the phone asked if the receptionist (whom we checked in with)told us the room was ready. I told her she did say the room was ready but she handed me the keys to our room and directed me to the building. I was kind of upset the way she phrase the question. Anyways, we grabbed our 4 luggages and 3 kids and head back to the front desk and the they gave us another room keys at another building. We had a studio which consist of a queen size bed and a double size sofa bed. The room is okay for our party size. We asked to be close to the main buiding and pool but they placed us at the Paddock building which was far from everything (the pool, laundry and restaurant). We had to drive every morning to the front building where the only restaurant is (Artist's Palette) for breakfast. We basically drove as soon as we got out of our building. The pool was heated and had two water slides. The kids had a great time there. Overall, I would not stay in this resort again but will try another WDW resort.
