<Title>“Nice place if you can get it for a good price”
<Content>Clean modern facility with lovely pools and spa. Quinn's restaurant's food is ok, but nothing special. Rooms of average size with comfortable beds. Bathrooms are clean. Location requires a car ....parking $22-$25/day or cab rides of $15-$18 to reach most downtown locations,

<Title>“We wish we were back at the Sheraton Marina Hotel - the Marina Tower! Great 3 day stay!!”
<Content>We travel alot and have experienced many hotels....we loved our 3 day stay. The king size bed with the most luxurious linens must of been just one of the reasons I slept like a baby, not to mention how quiet the rooms are. We used our beautiful sunny balcony to enjoy evening wine and views of Marina. Enjoyed runs right out the door onto pathways - rented bikes from hotel too!!! The lobby is airy and had great views of harbor - excellent Starbucks in lobby and room. Even getting off the elevator was a treat - views from both directions and just so bright and airy. We had two nights booked at Omni hotel and are here now. Such a disappointment compared. Gaslamp area and Loudest room ever - even on 18th floor and Omni does not live up to it's reviews that describe a positive place - people should try the Sheraton for a good experience!!!

<Title>“Nice hotel!”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for a business trip in March. Just my luck, they had rain and 40 mile per hour winds one day and some hail the next day! But the weather eventually got better. The hotel is very close to the airport, and has a free shuttle. However, I don't recall ever hearing any airplanes fly over. The room was very nice (I got upgraded to a junior suite), and it overlooked the marina. Every thing in the room worked fine. It was also not too far of a walk to some restaurants, but you need a cab to get to the Gas Lamp quarter or to the ferry to go to Coronado. The fitness center was very well equipped. One nice feature: in the lobby, there are several free workstations, and there is a printer if you ever need to print out directions or reservation confirmations.

<Title>“What a gift”
<Content>I was at a convention and booked a room through my organization. I had a good rate and booked the lowest priced room. I also have special needs and asked to be near an elevator. My room was comfortable, a beautiful balcony with a view of the Coronado Bridge and the bay with sailboats. San Diego is quite a magical city to begin with. I went to sleep in a bed that felt like I was on a cloud, I seriously wanted to duplicate it at home! There were thousands of people at the hotel, but in my room it was absolutely quiet! I was so amazed. I have traveled around the world and slept in everything from 5 stars to pensions, this was like a home away from home.

<Title>“Great location, near the airport & downtown”
<Content>We stayed here the last night of our vacation so we could be close to the airport. The hotel is also close to the Gaslight district and the Seaport Village. We stayed in the Bay Tower and had a lovely room with a kingsized bed and a view of the bay. Rooms on the other side of the hotel overlooked the marina. It was a great deal for the price.

<Title>“Very Nice. Might Need Some Updating”
<Content>Stayed in the Bay Tower. The rooms were spacious, and clean. The twin beds were comfortable. It had a balcony and my room had a spectacular view of the San Diego Bay. The restaurant does not open until 5, but you can get on the hotel shuttle and go down the road to the other part of the hotel that has several reaturants. Unless you want to hop in a cab or have a rental car and go down the road into town to eat, you are are very limited as far as food choices. We all know how pricey hotel restaurants are. If you have kids with you and don't want the hassdle, order pizza. I wil stay here next time I travel to SD.

<Title>“3 1/2 Stars Tower vs 2 Stars Tower vs 5 Star Lounge”
<Content>I was at this hotel in March for a business conference with functions in the hotel. There were about 130 participants at the meeting including clients. We knew going into the weekend that the hotel was sold out the night before the meeting began but at the last minute the hotel determined they did have some rooms for the few of us and the clients who were checking in early. Here is where the tale of two towers begins..... The hotel has 2 "towers" as they call it and the majority of the group was checked into the Bay Tower. I got a room in the Marina tower along with 2 others. Usually when a hotel has 2 towers you assume they are in the same building just using separate elevator banks and at opposite ends. However, these are really two completely separate hotel buildings separated by a 5-8 minute walk outside. (Two of my posted pictures show a view from my room and the lounge and the view from my Marina Tower room looking at the Bay Building so you can see the distance.) Note that the hotel does provide free shuttle service. You can see the map of the buildings and layout on the SPG page for the hotel under "Meetings & Events" and then "View Floor Plans & Capacity Charts." I asked the front desk staff who checked me in what the difference was between the two towers and she said "Well the rooms in the Bay tower are generally 30% larger." That may be true but some extra space is all you will get and it's not worth the trade off. Because I was a Platinum member after asking "Well check me into a room YOU would prefer..." I was given a room in the Marina Tower. As we met for dinner that first night naturally everyone asked how comfortable the rooms were and for the three of us in the main Marina tower (the main hotel building/entrance) the rooms were clean, renovated, and just fine. (Pictures of my Marina Tower room are posted) However, I heard nothing but bad comments the rest of the weekend from any meeting participant that was over in the Bay Tower. Distance was a problem but they commented how the hotel was old and run down, bathrooms were not as clean as they could be. They really had a completely different hotel experience than anyone who stayed in the Marina Tower. It's also not a quick trip to get between towers should you have a short break in your meeting and want to "run back to your room." When booking rooms on the hotel website you do choose which tower you would like a room in so BEWARE. In my opinion, if you are not staying in the Marina Tower, do not stay here or at least be prepared. The unexpected highlight was the Club Level Lounge (Marina Tower)! I have also posted pictures of the lounge. Many people who go to the lounges can tell you that most of the time, it's just a sleeping room on a standard floor at the end of the hall with some sofas and chairs in it - small, cramped, dark and not relaxing at all. Maybe there are some cold drinks but it's really depressing and pretty useless. However, the lounge here could not be more enjoyable. As I arrived at the hotel at 11am (and room not available) I asked to have access to the lounge as a Platinum member. The lounge is the entire top floor of the hotel. It's almost all windows with 2 TVs, lots of workspace and comfortable chairs and sofas, and times where food is provided. It's bright with lots of light and comfortable. Internet is also free in the lounge. It was really relaxing and what a great place to work especially since I couldn't check in until 3:30pm. I didn't mind working with a great view of the Marina and Bay. In regard to hotel location - It's DIRECTLY across the street from the airport. Yes it's a short commute from the airport but you can't walk to ANYTHING around there. Look this hotel up on the map before you book so you aren't disappointed.

<Title>“Great service, a bit islolated location”
<Content>Overall, I experienced a great stay at this hotel during a recent conference. The staff was helpful, by room was clean and comfortable and the food during conference was great. The only negative was the relatively isolated location. I am a big fan of walking, and you really needed to take a cab to get to town (although it is an easy walk from the airport). The hotel itself is clean and up to date. I was given a small suite with a little balcony where I could see downtown and the water through the trees (I was on a low floor). The bed was the usual very comfortable sheraton bed, and the linens were clean and fresh. Lunch at the hotel restaurant was tasty (I had a nice seafood cobb salad), but everything on the menu is $15-$20 for lunch before drinks, tax and tip. There are no other options to dine nearby, other than walking to the airport for fast food. The other hotel facilities were good. The gym contains several bikes, treadmills and ellipticals, as well as weight machines. The pool looked great. Lots of places to sit. There is a very nice club level lounges, with a great view. The lounge included cold breakfast choices each morning (cereal, oatmeal, pastries, fruit and cold cuts). Unlike some other Sheratons I visit, there were no hot choices. There is a free shuttle from the airport, and it is only about a 10 minute walk, so I did not experience parking. It looked like overnight parking was around $20. The property itself consists of several buildings, so the experience might depend on which building you end up in. The main tower houses the restaurant, bar, lounge and a much nicer gym than the other tower. The other tower is not right next door- it is a bit if a hike. There are also some annex buildings where the rooms have exterior corridors and doors. The overall value varied. My conference rate was over twice the auto club rate I paid the final night., so check around for deals.

<Title>“Fantastic property, bad service”
<Content>First of all, the property is absolutely fantastic. The hotel sits over the Marina, is right near the airport, and is convenient to La Jolla, the bay, and Coronado. The lobby is impressive and the fitness center is great. You can walk to the waterfront in 3 min, and the bar in the hotel is great. The rooms are good, not great, and it is an older Sheraton which has been rebadged. But, you dont lack for anything in the rooms and the balconies looking over the marina are a nice touch. San Diego is a fantastic city and is so underrated as a travel destination. Thus said, the service was extremely dissapointing. The front desk help did not speak great English. The "green" program they shove off on you is an excuse to not clean the rooms, etc. and not pay the staff to be there - otherwise they wouldnt hand out towels by the boatloads in the gym and heat the pool year round (much worse for the environment than cleaning the rooms!). We finally asked the front desk to have our room cleaned and.....nothing for 2 days. 4 days total. Not acceptable at all. We also made dinner reservations through the front desk and......that's right, the reservations were not made. It was almost a disaster for some clients we hosted. I would still stay here again but it is definitely not for the service, that will disappoint anyone who thinks paying 279 a night for a hotel will get them good service. This property still has a lot to learn about being a luxury hotel.

<Title>“Relaxing Retreat on the Marina”
<Content>OVERVIEW OF BRAND Sheraton is the “flagship” brand of the Starwood Preferred Guest (SPG) family of hotels as it has the largest number of hotels. As of April 1, 2011, all Sheratons must have a club lounge that is open on the weekends. They also have a computer/WiFi area in the lobbies known as “Link@Sheraton.” Hotel bathrooms are stocked with “Shine” products. SHERATON–SAN DIEGO MARINA This Sheraton opened approximately 40 years ago, and this was my first stay. It is located next to the airport, and it was renovated approximately 6 years ago. The hotel consists of two buildings: the main hotel with a conference center and the Bay Tower, which is 7–10 minute walk away. Both buildings have a “Link,” a fitness center, pool access, and restaurants. However, the main building has more and bigger of everything; and the only restaurant in the Bay Tower has limited hours and closed for lunch. The only Sheraton Club Lounge is on the 12th Floor of the Main Building. THE ROOM The rooms and hallways reflect its location on the Marina with lots of blue, pictures of boating, and nautical flags. The standard/deluxe room has a 37” LG LCD flat-screen TV, a coffee maker (Starbucks coffee), bar fridge with sensors (i.e., it’ll charge you if you pick it up), and an iron/ironing board. Most rooms have a balcony/patio, but you may want to ask to make sure. Most rooms also seem to have nice views as it’s on a narrow island and no other tall buildings are close by; views may be of the bay, marina, downtown, or airport. SPG Platinum Members receive free Internet in the room. Otherwise, Internet in your room will cost $15–19 for 24-hours. They have a “Link” on the first floor of both buildings, which offers free Internet for all. GYM AND POOL Both buildings have a gym and pool. However, the main building has more pools and is close to many activities that would be fun for children (e.g., an area with Ping Pong tables, and a massive Pirate Ship). The gym is also larger in the main building. SPG SPECIFIC Only the main building has a Club Lounge, which is open all day. The Lounge overlooks the Marina and is very nice and comfortable. There is a computer, a flat screen TV, and a fireplace. The Lounge fridge is stocked with bottled water throughout the day, but no soft drinks or coffee like at other Sheratons. The Lounge has breakfast (Monday–Friday = 6:30–9:30AM; Saturday & Sunday = 6:30–10:30AM) and evening appetizers (Daily = 5:00–8:00PM) with a cash bar (average price for drink = $9.00). I am not sure what the Platinum Amenities are as I wasn’t offered any (I assume I’ll get 500 Starpoints). MY RATING This is a really nice Sheraton. The rooms are comfortable, and the views are amazing. Although it is showing some wear and tear (e.g., the lamp shade in the room was beat up and the carpet by the balcony got wet due to a rainstorm because of bad weatherproofing), it’s still in very good condition. My main reason for giving this hotel 4 vs. 5 stars is because of the inconvenience of the Club Lounge. There should be a mini version of it in the Bay Tower just like there are “mini duplicates” of everything else given the Main Building isn’t convenient to get to. Although you can drive to the Main Building or take a Shuttle, that may not work if you are in a rush and/or just want to get a drink to take to your room. Notwithstanding this limitation, I actually think this is a great Sheraton. There are other nice Starwood Hotels closer to the Convention Center (e.g., The W and The Westin–Gas Lamp District), but unless you need to repeatedly go the Convention Center, then I’d opt for this Sheraton. It’s close enough to the downtown action, but serves as a nice retreat from your busy day. The pools and the views are very relaxing—especially if you are having drinks from your balcony while watching the sunset.

<Title>“Beautiful location and great staff!”
<Content>I recently visited for a conference and was enchanted by the beautiful city of San Diego. We were lucky enough to stay here and had a wonderful time. We arrived early in the morning and expected to stow our luggage and go until check-in, but the staff found a room for us. All the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Bryan F. at the Tapatini was very charming and one of the hardest-working guys I've seen. The location on the Marina is lovely. It is a jaunt to downtown (about 2.5 miles), but it's a pretty walk. The Old Town Trolley does make a stop here in the morning and is a great way to explore the city. There is also a car rental place not too far. I would certainly return to this beautiful hotel anytime.

<Title>“Terrible hotel for a conference!”
<Content>This is not a good hotel to hold a conference. It is convienent to the airport but once there you must take an expensive cab to go anywhere. The hotel food is expensive , $10.00 for a bowl of oatmeal! If you want to eat anywhere else, you must take a cab. It is NOT close to any other services. Internet is ONLY available for a charge of 11.95 per Day in your room. The lobby does have free wireless but only had about two plugs which was very inadequate for 1000 peopke attending a conference. I would not reccommend holding a conference here - you may pay a little bit more to be downtown but you will not have to take a cab and you will have better food choices

<Title>“great view, lots of little annoyances”
<Content>Based on previous reviews, I booked a room in the Bay Tower. The view was awesome...but there were other minor things that detracted from my stay. (1) The water for my shower was only lukewarm 2 out of 3 mornings. (2) The walls are paper thin. I could hear people talking next door & in the hall, also heard every time people in the room above flushed the toilet (they are VERY loud), walked, & took a shower, etc. (3) The website doesn't state that it's about 1/4 to 1/3 mile walk from the Bay Tower to the Marina Tower where the main hotel and larger conference venue are located. I love to walk...but not in business shoes. (4) Food prices at the hotel restaurants are about the most outrageous I've ever seen, even for a higher-end hotel in a major city. $9 for a bowl of oatmeal?! $15 for a hamburger?! Thankfully the deli/diner half-way between the 2 buildings had great, inexpensive food for breakfast & lunch. If you are going for a conference, I'd recommend staying at the Marina for convenience sake, unless the view is all that matters.

<Title>“Ok but ensure you stay in the Marina Tower not the Bay Tower”
<Content>We got to the Hotel to be told we were staying in the Bay Tower. Didn't realise the hotel was split into two towers 5 minutes walk away from each other. Check in was painless and the room was clean. It looked over the marina and airport. Wasn't too noisy. We took a look at the Marina tower and the Bay tower is definitely the very poor relation. The Marina Tower had everything from a bar to 2 restaurants, a Starbucks, to a patio where you could enjoy a coffee looking at the marina. The Bay Tower had no bar open during the day where you could sit and enjoy coffee and enjoy the view. We were gutted especially as we were staying for 5 days. You will need a car to get anywhere from here. There are no shuttles into town. You can only book excursions from the Marina Tower conceirge. We didn't pay for the Internet but took advantage of the free wifi in reception, which was good enough for a Skype call. $22 for parking each day was a bit expensive but not as much as other hotels in the area. In summary. Stay in the Marina Tower. If you stay at the Bay Tower do not visit the Marina Tower. You will just get upset.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>The hotel was wonderful. A beautiful water view. It is close to Symphony Hall and the location of the San Diego Opera. It is about 2 miles from center city where there are lots of things to see. You must go to the San Diego Zoo if you have children. Our children live in San Diego and this hotel is a good place to stay and get around the city with a car.

<Title>“Great room with a view”
<Content>The rooms were nice, the views even better. We had a room that had a view of the marina and the San Diego bay cityline. The nighttime view of the city lights was great. Rooms were well appointed, comfortable bed, clean updated room and bathrooms, even have Peter Thomas Roth bath amenities (as a woman, I appreciated this very much! ^_^) It was a short trip to get downtown, SD Zoo and Seaworld and not too bad to Coronado as well, where we had dinner plans one evening. There is also a hotel restaurant for convenience. Across the hotel is a walking path by the water which was also nice. The area has restaurants and bars within walking distance and is also by the airport (which is good for plane watching or aviation photography -my fiance enjoyed it) Overall it was a great place to stay. Nice, clean convenient and parking was not far nor crowded and it was fairly cheaper than downtown hotel parking. I would give it 5 stars except the room we had was a bit small. King bed and furniture with one large suitcase had us walking over our stuff to get to the bathroom. But traveling as a couple, I wasn't bothered much by it.

<Title>“Great hotel with wonderful service near airport.”
<Content>A very busy hotel with lots of features including a massive lagoon pool and new fitness equipment. The pub-style restaurant bar is nice and the waitstaff are excellent. Just very over-priced for a pub however the food was very good. The main restaurant has a great buffet breakfast and the service was wonderful. Rooms were very clean and the hotel has stunning views if you're lucky enough to get into the marina building. Really nice hot tub that is quite large and actually HOT. Too bad the pool was so cold. Great hotel and the staff are excellent.

<Title>“Beautiful views, nice location...”
<Content>Right next to the airport and situated on the bay this hotel has picture perfect views of the city from one side and views of a marina and Point Loma peninsula on the other when you stay in the main tower. The rooms are bright and clean, the decks offer great views, the pools are large and inviting, and the location is a short cab ride to the city. The in-room dining choices are limited, but service is fast. There's a bar restaurant in the lobby that offers decent food at decent prices. There are conference facilities in this hotel, so if you're looking to avoid corporate crowds this may not be the place for you. Overall I was very happy with the four days I just spent here and want to come back again to see more of the city.

<Title>“Convenient location - if have car - terrible hotel service”
<Content>We stayed in the "Bay Tower," which is a separate building, around the corner about 1/2 mile from the main building. The Bay Tower used to be a Ramada...and still looks like it. We were unable to check in early, were told they put a pending on our room to clean first, so we could check in after flying for 8 hours, and would call us. They never called, so we checked in at 2:50 pm, only to be given a room we did not choose or pay for. After arguing, they moved us. Then, cleaning service did not come the next day while we were out of our room between 9:45am and 3:15pm. I called guest services to alert of this - did nothing except bring up fresh towels. Then, cleaning service called us because we had a do not disturb sign on the door after 3:15pm when they wanted to clean. Housekeeping also banged on our door three times the morning of check-out. The hotel charges an arm and leg for each LOCAL phone call, do notice the little sheet of paper near the phone explaining this...something I did not notice. They charge for the Internet - two prices, daily, and charge for the self parking. The bar charged $70 for 5 beers and two, small bottles of water. The in-room convenient prices were equally as expensive. The room was their deluxe king, on the 8th floor facing the bay. Nice view, nice little balcony, which was the only thing we enjoyed - although the weather was unseasonably cold, extremely windy and rainy. The bed was uncomfortable and the furniture looked old and dingy. I did ask for an adjustment on the bill, but guest services would not budge and did not seem to care at all. I also used the spa at the main building. They gave me a key to a locker that didn't work. After fiddling with it for 5 minutes or so, I asked for a new locker and explained the lock was malfunctioning. The staff person said, "yes, a work order has been called in..." I explained she should not have given me that locker then. She didn't seem to care. I was the only person in the spa. So, I have stayed at the Loew's Coronado for the same price and had much better service and rooms. I chose to stay here for a more convenient location. Not worth saving the 10-12 minute drive. Yes, I am particular and have not a problem paying for good service and amenities, however, my experience was definitely poor and worth giving a head's up to others.

<Title>“Perfect”
<Content>This hotel actually has two towers. I stayed in the secondary tower (not the main tower with the club lounge, etc). Initially, I was concerned that the secondary tower would be a grave inconvenience. However, the room was quiet, beautifully decorated, extremely spacious, and offered the most beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean. However, to eat in the Club Lounge we had to walk to the primary tower. Fortunately the weather was beautiful and the walk was inviting. The Club Lounge Breakfast was a perfect start of the day. The food was fresh and tasty. Also, the coffee/cappuccino machine is something you must try. The staff were very nice and quite accommodating. This hotel is close to everything in the city, but not in the immediate midst of the hustle and bustle. Also, it is approximately 3 mins from the airport. I could not have asked for a better hotel stay.

<Title>“Beautiful area, unhelpful staff”
<Content>I was disappointed with my hotel because I specifically paid extra for a high-level room with a king sized bed and a great view, but when I arrived at the hotel, I was told that there were no more King suite rooms available and since I pre-paid through another website, the hotel was not able to refund any of my money as they were down-grading my room. The hotel was happy to offer a king suite in their second tower, but this tower was over a 5 minute walk away with none of the amenities. I was staying at this specific hotel because I was attending a conference and wanted to be close to the events plus the hotel amenities. The hotel placed me in a handicap room with the promise to upgrade me when another room became available, but that never happened. The hotel and surrounding area was beautiful, but it was very secluded. The airport was minutes away, but all of the other sights in SD were at least a $15 cab ride away and the food in the hotel was very over-priced. The walls in the rooms were also paper-thin. I was woken up one night by my neighbor's snoring.

<Content>This is a nice hotel near the airport and harbor. Too bad the staff seems to dislike their jobs and transfers their negative attitudes to the guests.

<Title>“Bad experience”
<Content>Me and my boyfriend were there from the 23rd to the 26th of Febuary 2012. We were not satisfied with this hotel because we got there with high expectatives due to the brand name of Sheraton and the price of the room, just with this you would expect a quality and clean room. 1. We arrived to the room we were assigned and it was dirty( it wasn't clean from the last stay of unknowns) 2. They immediately changed us to the room in front. The bathtub was dirty, the sheets were brownish in some part and the bathroom was full of hair( this just one more time gave the impression that the hotel WAS NOT CLEAN. 3. They moved us up to a Suite( which was even smaller than the regular guest room) and what we do recognize is that they gave us free breakfast for both of us for the 3 nights we were there. Overall I would not recommend this hotel. Not such a good location wither because you must have a car to go to the center for dinner, lunch, any other activity you want.

<Title>“Spring Break 2012”
<Content>First of all let me start by saying the shuttle from the airport was waiting when we got there. Our luggage was arriving later in which the airlines and hotel took care of. We had a room in the Marina tower on the 8th floor great view (main tower). Employees at the hotel were amazing. Breakfast buffet in the restaurant was great every morning. Boyd the food and beverage manager was not only professional but extremely friendly. Totally makes sense as to why the staff was the same way. Carlos was fantastic and the other servers we had were good also although I can not remember their names. (sigh) The highlight of our trip to this hotel was Doug in the restaurant. AMAZING!!!! Not only was he knowledgable about the places we were going he let us know what we should try and look for. For instance Knott's Berry Farm...he suggested the pie and fried chicken....WOW!!! Was he right. We even brought him a piece of pie back as a thank you. Our children looked forward to their talks with Doug at breakfast. The first day he asked us how smart are kids were and of course like every parent we say they are brilliant. Doug then presented them with a riddle and they answered correctly. He was happy about that. Our kids wrote him a note when we left with a picture of his favorite animal in the zoo an okapi. It is people like that that make trips so memorable. All that to say we had a fantastic stay at the Sheraton Marina San Diego. Thank you Doug and Boyd Young for a great experience!!

<Title>“Great stay!”
<Content>I really enjoyed my couple of nights here. I stayed in the Bay Tower which is the smaller hotel approx 10 min walk from the Marina Tower. I was on the 7th floor with a stunning view of the marina from the large balcony. The rooms are very big and nicely decorated (30% bigger than Marina Tower rooms I was told). Bed was super comfortable. I walked through the Marina Tower which is a much bigger hotel. The lobby is more impressive and the bar/restaurant there was more happening, plus there is Starbucks there...the Bay Tower just has a bar/restaurant. I was more than content with the Bay Tower though! I reserved through the Sheraton website and got a ridiculously good deal, $130ish. I paid 4 times that much for one night at a hotel in Santa Monica! Location: it's a bit far from downtown, but if you love to walk, as we do, it's fine, plus you are walking by the water so it's really pretty. A cab to the zoo cost $20 incld tip, cab from the Gaslamp was $15 with tip. Given the great rate it made sense for us to stay a little further out and take the occasional cab.

<Title>“Great Resort Like Property”
<Content>This property is beautifully maintained! From the outdoor grounds to the club floor, everything was clean and looked fresh. The hotel is broken up into two buildings. The Marina Tower being the "main" tower with restaurants, pools, gym, tennis courts, Starbucks and club lounge. The Bay Tower is about a 5 minute walk along the marina and while not a huge deal it would be a little inconvenient if you were wanting to be close to the action of the hotel. The property sits on the marina and across the street from the airport, BUT this is not a typical airport hotel !! It is somewhere between hotel and resort property probably partly because of the expansive grounds and being on the marina. The rooms in the Marina tower are a tad on the smaller side, but have balconies and in excellent condition. Rooms in the Bay tower are a bit larger. The higher floors have wonderful views no matter which building you are in or which direction you are facing. Even the lower floors I imagine would have nice views as there is nothing around the immediate property but marina or bay. Full Starbucks in the lobby is very convenient for morning nibbles or whatever coffee concoction you like best. There is also a full service restaurant with a very nice breakfast buffet. Equally enjoying is the club lounge on the top floors which is a wonderful place to relax and watch the sunrise over breakfast or the sunset over appetizers and drinks. The front desk agents we encountered were very friendly and helpful, even when we asked to check in at 9am. Although a room wasn't immediately available, it was shortly thereafter and well before the normal afternoon hotel check in time. The restaurant waiter we had was also very attentive and friendly. And I have to give a big thanks to the club lounge waiter who was equally attentive.

<Title>“Great location for an active family”
<Content>We booked this hotel through Hotwire and never know what kind of room our Hotwire rate will buy so we were THRILLED when the front desk staff accommodated our request for a bay view room on a top floor!  In the morning we watched dolphins swim casually back and front from our balcony.  (Note: there are two distinct hotels and we actually prefer the Bayview tower.  You can choose either a view of the bay or view of the marina from this tower. We've had both and you can't go wrong either way). I loved the way the bed was angled to face the water.  What a great view from the bed!   Right out the side door of the Bayview Tower is a sweet little deli, Papanani's,  that serves nice cook to order breakfast that you can call ahead and order, take-out back to your room, or eat right on the marina. Highly recommend it.   The hotel rent bikes (though we brought our own) and its a lovely little bike ride along the water to downtown. Our kids are 9 and 6 and were thrilled by the ships we passed on our bike ride (pirate ships/aircraft carriers) and we even got to stop and watch a habor seal put on a show for us while it chased a school of circling fish!  What fun!  I cannot say enough about the great staff that work here. We forgot our kids' helmets and they were so kind in letting us borrow some for free and even replaced a bolt we'd lost off my bike.  We biked over to Liberty Park too which is an awesome kids park:  tons of grass and multiple play areas!!! In the past we have also biked to Balboa Park/zoo from this hotel.  Did I mention we had awesome service from everyone we encountered which really makes a difference to me. The workout room was very nice!  We only swam in the Marina Tower pool and it was nice. The hottub was big! The room was nice and big too.  The only negative was I didn't have hot water for my late morning shower. It was only warm. Overall an excellent stay.

<Content>Very nice and comfortable hotel. View are incredible for the marina and bay. Excellent customer service and it was a pleasant surprise the staff let me check in 4 hours early. Very nice sports bar with excellent dining service. The business center is comfortable and valuable to the business traveler. Having a Starbucks within the lobby area is really nice.

<Content>I recently stayed in this hotel in February 2012. The rooms were clean, service was excellent, and the staff was helpful and courteous. I enjoyed the decor and feel of being at the harbor. Restaurants at the hotel and in the area were goos, and Harbor Island was a great place to wander and relax.

<Title>“Great Sheraton Airport Property-stay without hesitations”
<Content>Stayed at this property for one night with my wife and two small kids. We booked connecting rooms and paid for the upgrade to the Club Level Floor. Airport Shuttle was waiting for us, with a very helpful and pleasant driver. Shuttle runs to and from airport every 15 minutes. Check in was flawless, quick and painless. Our club level connecting rooms in the Marina tower were great for our family. Typical Sheraton rooms and exactly what we expected. One bonus are that the rooms come with a balcony. Our rooms overlooked the Marina and we really enjoyed looking at the boats and people watching from the balcony. We used the main pool just below the restaurant. It wasn't too warm that day outside (60 ish) so actually my kids used the pool while we sat and watched. We ordered room service delivered to the pool deck and it arrived quickly and was quite tasty. As mentioned in other rooms, food and beverage are pretty expensive, and there are not any other options within walking distance, so plan ahead. The upgrade to the club floor was worth it for the appetizers in the evening and the nice breakfast spread in the morning. Only downer is that this Club level does not offer complementary adult beverages, but rather a cash bar. I was hoping the cash bar prices would be a bit less than the regular bar, but they were still on the expensive side. With that being said the staff working in the Club Lounge were great. We enjoyed our time in the lounge. Took a cab into San Diego proper for a few hours....15 bucks each way, so reasonable if you are not wanting to rent a car. I would highly recommend this airport property if you have a lay over or early flight. It was a great station for us to stay at for the night. One other note, we were not bothered by airport noise, but our room faced the Marina and not the airport. Stay here without hesitations. This is a nice property with an excellent staff.

<Title>“Very nice hotel”
<Content>The hotel is nice and we loved the view of the marina. The outdoor fire pits are relaxing to sit by. The only downfall is that the parking lot was usually full, so we had to walk a little distance. They did let us check in 3 hours early. The location near the airport is nice and the planes didn't bother us. The beds were comfortable. We will be back.

<Title>“Very nice hotel, but pricey”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel in February for a conference that was being hosted in the main building. The hotel was quite nice and the staff was very courteous. The rooms were beautiful, modern, and very well appointed. I was quite comfortable staying here. Location is a bit of a challenge; it is a beautiful location tucked in the middle of the bay, but it is somewhat inconvenient if you want to be able to walk anything. You basically need to take a taxi or a rental car anywhere you want to go; this can be marked in contrast to previous stays I had in Mission Beach/Pacific Beach where I was able to walk from my hotel to any number of stores of restaurants. The only other issue I could see here was price. The food available at the hotel was quite good for a series of hotel-based restaurants. But, they were very overpriced. Unfortunately, there just aren't many options there in the vicinity so unless you want to drive into town (or take a taxi), you are pretty much stuck with spending quite a bit of money on food at their selection of restaurants.

<Title>“Disappointing Stay”
<Content>When I checked into the Sheraton it didn't help that I had to wait 20 minutes. I was asked at check in if I would be a "green" patron. I asked what that meant and it was that housekeeping would not change out my towels and that they would leave me a voucher for the restaurant / bar for $5. I stayed 4 nights and what it meant was that housekeeping didn't come at all to empty the trash or make the bed. Also, these $5 vouchers could not be combines to go towards an overall meal, making you either use them for drinks at the bar. On top of that I was slapped with a $22 / night charge for self parking (most likely because of the marina). Outside of these comments, the hotel was nice and clean and the service was okay. If you don't have a car, it's a reasonable place to stay, otherwise, I'd suggest that you find another hotel in the San Diego area.

<Title>“Good for me”
<Content>I went to San Diego for a conference at the convention center and stayed at this hotel for four nights through hotwire. As a huge fan of public transportation and walking, I tried to walk. It is 3 miles one way and it ook me a full one hour, so I stopped doing this after a day. You can hop in the free airport shuttle and take mts992, which costs only $2.25 and just a few minutes to downtown, although you need to walk additional few blocks to the convention center. Upon the recommendation from this site, I requested a room with a downtown view, and the staff gave me a room at Bay Tower (about 1000 ft from Marina Tower). I found out that I could not see the downtown. The next day, I requested a room to Marina Tower to be near the airport shuttle without any preference to the view, and I was given a room with a beautiful downtown view. From the experience of staying at both towers, the room at Marina Tower was smaller and was okay since I was alone, and I presume that even numbered room at Marina Tower: harbor/airport view odd numbered room at Marina Tower: downtown view even numbered room at Bay Tower: airport view odd numbered room at Bay Tower: harbor view. The staff were very nice. I did not have the privilege of using free wifi in the room, but I saw people with status get it. There are a few computers in the lobby and the connectivity was good. I have no particular complaint against the hotel and I would stay again.

<Title>“Tired Facility”
<Content>Positives: -Airport Access -Marina Location -Lobby Free Internet Access -Balconies on rooms with chairs -Comfortable bed Negatives: -Run down room -Run down airport shuttle -Expensive (overpriced) on-site dining I got a really good rate at this facility, but upon check-in and seeing my room I quickly checked availability at other options. Seeing as how I was only destined to sleep a few hours over two nights at this hotel, I elected to stay. The rooms were outdated, especially the bathroom. Lights above the mirror were about 5'8" high, which wasn't conducive to a slightly taller person who has to shave. Fixtures were rusty, shower curtain was too long (about 4" on the bath floor, inside the bath), and the sink was once-overed with crud collecting against the wall below the mirror. It was pretty much unacceptable and if I had arrived at a decent time or normal state of mind I would have definitely requested a room change. The on-site dining charged resort rates for food, which I feel based on the overall condition of things is overpriced. I did not order any of the food. At one time this may have been a 4 star facility, I would now rate it a 3 star facility operating at about 2.5 stars overall. The staff was overall friendly and helpful, although upon arrival it was like pulling teeth to ask for a king instead of the two twins they had me booked in. He tried not to change me, but in a courteous and professional manner. I would not stay at this hotel again, however I think it is a fair value at a 3 star rate for a big hotel.

<Title>“Not as good as they could be.”
<Content>I reserved and paid in advance for a room with a King bed, but was given a room with two doubles or queens. I reported this to the front desk and was told there were no King rooms left. This always confuses me. If I reserve it and PAY for it, why don't I get it. As I was only in for one night, I let it go. The room itself was good sized and the bathroom was clean. The hotel is not as close to things as the website suggests, or at least they take longer than you would assume by the given distances posted. Nothing is within walking distance. The parking is pretty expensive at $22/ day self, $30/ valet. If you self park, be ready for a hike back to the lobby. The price per night at $119 was reasonable for the room, but there are additional taxes and parking fees that took my final bill to over $155. If you are there for an overnight stay between flights and don't have a car and plan to stay in, the hotel is in a good spot. If you plan to visit downtown or the Gaslamp area, bring plenty of cash as a taxi will run $30-$50 round trip.

<Content>Nice hotel with a great harbor view. I stayed at the other tower down the island and it was annoying looking for parking then being told that I have to drive down the island to another tower and park there again. The key did not open the gate..etc..but lets not get into that. I ended up parking on the street and saved $25. Hotel was modern with balconies and looked renovated.

<Content>I am ambivalent about this hotel, mainly because of the service. Aside from the pleasant gym attendant and waitstaff in the restaurants, the other employees were less effective than automated voice response units. They did get their jobs done, but offered nothing without prompting. Otherwise I enjoyed the marina location. It's a nice area for walking and the pool was great. The marina tower room was fine. The club breakfast had a good selection of items. This is a good option if you're arriving on a late flight and just want to jump on a quick shuttle to your room. By the way, I didn't hear a single plane during my stay. A helicopter once while outside, but otherwise no excess noise at all.

<Title>“Thanks Mr. Casanova and Sheraton”
<Content>Stayed recently at the Sheraton Marina in San Diego for a conference. Pleasant place to stay. Good conference facilities. Nice amenities, place to walk. But what really left me feeling good about the place is this: In a hurry to catch my plane after the conference, I left behind a dresser drawer full of clothing. Because of my schedule, it was more than a week before I realized where I had left it. When I called, Mr. Nicolas Casanova from Lost & Found tracked my clothes down for me and returned them to me intact. Way to go Sheraton. I won't forget it.

<Title>“Great Stay!”
<Content>I wasn't expecting much since it was a hotel near the airport, but the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina is a great place to stay! The hotel is beautiful--has a nice pool, jacuzzi, and fire pits right by the harbor. The views from the room were nice as well. The room was clean and stylish. We could hear the airplanes taking off every once in a while from the airport, but it didn't bother me a bit (and I'm an extremely light sleeper). Upon our arrival, the valet were very helpful and answered our questions about where to park. Susanna from In Room Dinning was so nice when she brought our breakfast up the next morning! (The front desk had forgotten to give us our F&B discount card upon arrival and she said no problem she would take care of it and she made sure the bill was adjusted). The concierge (can't remember her name, but she had brown hair) was really helpful as well and printed off directions to five different places for us. I would definitely recommend this hotel.

<Title>“Sheraton is a dream!”
<Content>I couldn't be more impressed with the Sheraton Hotel & Marina. The location-very near-the airport-is wonderful..right on the water and convenient to everything. The staff goes out of their way for their guests, the rooms are beautiful and there is great food and service at Tapatinis--just off the lobby. After a slight mix-up with my room, the GM called to make sure everything was taken care of. I travel to San Diego often and will not stay anywhere else!

<Title>“very nice”
<Content>we stayed here for a week and had a great stay .we were in the bay tower with a huge very clean room which had a great view of san diego bay where you could sit and watch all the ships and sailboats in the bay .we could also sit and watch across at the naval base with all it's activity .the noise wasn't a bother as i had read in reviews before our visit . rooms were very clean and roomy ,all staff excellent, as was pool . hired a car for four days which was nice to go further than san diego. but the public transport in san diego is excellent just hop on the hotel courtesy bus to the airport pay $5 on the city bus and this gets you travel all day on busses and trollies when done get the bus back to the airport and hop on the hotel courtesy shuttle back to the hotel would go back to this hotel in a flash

<Title>“Recent conference stay unfortunate”
<Content>I attended a conference there recently. The conference was in the main tower, even though I had a reservation there, I was put in the Bay tower (an old Westin) that is located at a separate location. I am not sure how far it is, but it was a very long way back and forth in the rain. I ended up spending almost 3 hours waiting for the shuttle (supposed to be every 20 minutes) during the 2 days. One evening it was raining and i waited for 40 minutes. No wireless internet in the room. It did have wired that i didn't use. One hour limited wireless in the lobby. My spouse tried to eat there one evening and couldn't even get anyone to seat her. If you have to be there for a conference -think twice about accepting a Bay tower room. You are somewhat isolated at this property. Not much close by. I would not stay there for a vacation without a vehicle. The main hotel looked nice when i walked through the lobby to attend meetings. The food at our conference was average. One evening we had a dinner for 250. The food was cold. Not warm, cold.

<Title>“Beautiful view of harbor, convenient location”
<Content>Beautiful view and experience of the San Diego harbor. Hotel accommodations were very good. Rooms were well appointed, very clean and tastefully decorated. All the employees we came in contact with were very friendly and helpful. Had an issue with the heating in the room but maintenance came quickly and fixed the problem. Were disappointed that the suite we had reserved was not the room that was given to us. Since we were there for a week, a separate living/bedroom area would have served our needs better. Lunch in the bar was very good - had the marinated skirt steak sandwich. Room was exceptionally quiet for the entire week until the last night when people above us created a lot of noise, stomping, jumping, etc. Bed linens were luxurious, however the mattress was so extremely soft that we had backaches all week. No support at all. Spa experience (facial) was very enjoyable. Ask for Mary Ann. She was great.

<Content>The hotel has two locations, we were fortunate to book at the location facing the water. Beautiful lobby as you walk through the doors, clean hallways, rooms, upkeep is excellent. rooms were very charming, disappointed that there was only a refrigerator for the snacks/beverages for sale, and could not use it for personal items.

<Content>I visit every year for a conference. The experience is almost always excellent. This time was no different. The rooms are sparkling clean and well-stocked. The restaurant and bar are lively and serve great food. Their meeting facilities are outstanding. The proximity to the airport makes this a very convenient hotel. The distance from the city center means you always have to cab it there rather than take a leisurely stroll.

<Title>“Good Conference Location”
<Content>There's many things I like about this property. There are a few negatives. Positives First: - Love the location, close to airport but with a harbor/bay view - My room (on 12 floor) had a balcony facing the water which was very nice. - Club lounge on the 13 or 14 floor is very decent. The evening snacks are great and tasty. Examples include fried chicken. The breakfast spread is adequate. Bagels, eggs, oatmeal, fruits, small selection of ham and cheese, juices, tea/coffee. No hot breakfast. The views are phenomenal. The sitting is comfy. - The rooms facing the bay (ie. with the view are great) - Its a very short drive to the Gas Lamp Quarter; maybe 7 minutes or less. Its literally two minutes to the airport. - Rooms are not luxurious but very comfortable. Decor is reasonable, in blue. Negatives - the hotel does not have good restaurants. The restaurants share one kitchen, and depending on your luck, the wait and service for food can range from 5 to 25 minutes. Its a big drawback. Having said that, the service, when you do get it, is reasonable. The waitstaff try very hard to please. The fitness center is reasonable with a wide range of equipment. There are decent pools, but I didn't get to use them. All in all, I would stay again, as long as I am not counting to eat at their restaurants. There is a starbucks at the property.

<Title>“Average Airport hotel”
<Content>Sheraton is in fact two hotels, the Sheraton and Bay Towers some 600 yards around the corner. Similar to previous reviewer, after having parked my car and gone to reception, I had to drive around to the Bay Hotel to my room. Hotel is in a great position, close to the airport next to the water. Bars are quiet as was the restaurant. Be warned however, a quick visit to the Gaslamp District will cost you @18 USD one way if you want to party. Otherwise, the Sheraton provides all the usual amenities, nothing special.

<Title>“A reasonable airport hotel”
<Content>Convenient for the airport, though plane noise is not too noticeable in the guest rooms. Clean room, if in need of renovation (though the check in staff implied it had been recently renovated). Definitely worth staying in the main tower. If you want more than a standard airport hotel, this is not for you. The restaurant was the disappointment. The staff wearing badly coffee stained shirts, the food average, with little attention to detail (e.g. The soup comes with biscuits still in plastic packets) yet relatively high priced. Few alternative options in the area.

<Content>We found a great rate at the Sheraton through priceline and were amazed with the quality for the price we paid! We had a room overlooking the marina and the sunset from the balcony was fantastic after a busy day seeing the sights. Staff were lovely and helpful, rooms were nicely furnished and close to the airport. We had a car so found it easy to drive around from the location. We didnt eat at the resort but enjoyed heading into the Gaslamp District as there was so much on offer.

<Title>“Two hotels one name”
<Content>Be sure to enquire which hotel your room is in as I called hotel in advance, was not forewarned by staff, parked car, offloaded luggage, walked from far end of parking lot only to be told I was in Bay Tower...which is essentially another hotel 600 yards or more away. Had the front desk person told me when I called and she knew I was driving over I would have avoided a needless exercise. Hotel fairly basic Sheraton. Saw various people speaking to staff during visit with service issues. Next time will try Hilton which is next to Bay Tower.

<Title>“Great Conference Hotel”
<Content>I stayed here for 3 nights during s conference - stayed in the Marina tower. The bed was very comfortable and I had 3 great nights of sleep which is highly unusual for me. I loved the city/bay view and I never closed the drapes . The sunsets and sunrises were amazing. What impressed me the most was the staff. Every single persons greeted me sincerely - from the front desk to the maid on the 11th floor, to the wait staff during the conference luncheon to the guys packing up the conference chairs . The customer service training at this to hotel really shows - but the sincerity was amazing. The employees honestly seem happy to work here - every single one. Room for improvement: better transportation downtown for those of us who didn't bring a car. The city bus stop was way too far away and there wasn't enough info for us to figure how how to get to downtown ourselves. This hotel will feel isolated for those who like to walk to restaurants etc.

<Title>“Fabulous hotel, space, value & service”
<Content>Stayed 2 nights pre-cruise with a group of 70 at this hotel. Whole group thrilled with hotel. Service in restaurant superb. Ronnie Hophman (Food & Beverage Manager) was very professional and helpful. Brian, waiter, went out of his way to be cheerful and went teh extra mile to do things for us. Alex, another waiter, leaped out of nowhere to help when my husband choked (badly) on his coffee. He was fabulous. Front desk staff very good. Rooms spacious and lovely. Beds VERY comfortabel. I slept 10 hrs!!! Turn right out of hotel, go to water. Turn left and walk a ways. YOu will come to Island Prime, a restaurant that has Happy Hour prices and $5.00 appetizers (REALLY good) 3.30-5.30 pm. A lovely walk along the water. San Diego is lovely. Must go to zoo also.

<Title>“rather good hotel but needs improvement”
<Content>rinStayed there 4 nights and wanted to combine business and pleasure. Asked the receptionist to put me in the room with better water view and she did the opposite - I had to drive 7 minutes to Bay Tower and got the room with view on PARKING and road (and the bay is somewhere far!) Next morning I had to move to Marina Tower. That's first time I see the hotel where You need to DRIVE between towers . Parking is open air but cost 22USD (self). Marina Tower (Main) was rather good, they have nice restaurant and free internet in the Lobby.

<Title>“Service and attention that exceeds most Sheraton properties”
<Content>The Sheraton Branded hotels can have a wide range of service and quality. The service levels offered at this hotel is much closer to what you would expect at a St Regis property sans butler of course. Staff and management do an OUTSTANDING job of providing excellent personalized service at a large high volume hotel. Location is great if you have a late flight in or an early flight out. You can return your rental car and walk back to the hotel with ease (avis is a bit more than the others). I havent tried the restaurants in awhile so i cannot comment on the food quality but everything else will exceed your expectations. TVs are flat screens with HD content. I prefer the Marina tower over the Bay tower the rooms may be smaller but it has a much nicer feel. The valet crew are fast and efficent. The only area for improvement for me is the front desk can get quite busy and I hate waiting in line to get my room.

<Content>So close to the airport without the feel of an "airport hotel". Stayed in the Marina tower and loved the nautical decor. Walk along the harbor right outside and in fact spotted dolphins swimming in the harbor on our walk over to the Starbucks in the Harbor tower. Pool at the Marina tower was small but nice.

<Title>“Great for short stays or if you have a rental car”
<Content>The Sheraton near SAN provides a nice play to rest for short trips in the area. While there are not many restaurants/services in the surrounding vicinity, the hotel provides several options including a gift shop and two restaurants with overpriced, but decent food. The breakfast buffet - while limited in choices - had a nice sampling of fresh fruit. We enjoyed playing ping-pong in the recreation area and found the pool and hot tub to be a perfect end to the day. We also loved our time by the fire pit, finding it especially satisfying after a dip. The room itself was nicely appointed and very comfortable. Service was excellent and the free shuttle bus to the airport prompt and convenient. Stay here for short trips and when you need a good base for jumping off into the San Diego area.

Marina hotel very luxerious with outstanding breakfast. Service very friendly and extremley attentive. Free internet with easy accessibility to it. Parking fees a little expensive but its worth it to have a car. Literally minutes from the airport which sounds daunting and looks daunting but is well placed and not noisy at all, not sure how they do it! Spent 5 fab days there and loved every minute! will definatly go back.

<Content>My wife and I stayed here while on a trip out west. Fantastic location,and amazing views of the harbor and of the Naval base across the way. Durning the afternoons you could see the helicopters performing manuvers and all kinds of fun stuff. It's a short cab ride into the city, we always hit the Gaslamp when we go and this time we caught a Padres game too. If you have a little bit of time also check out Old Town for some amazing food and drinks and then head over to Coronado to check out the hotel and go to McP's pub for a few drinks. McP's is incredible, SEAL and miltiary memorabilia all over the place, as this is a favorite hangout of the locals from the base we're told.

<Content>Spent 3 days here for a convention. We took the complimentary shuttle from the airport & they set a great first impression for the hotel; very friendly, gave us lots of tips on where to visit while we were in town. Smooth, friendly check in. They have a bar & grill type place, restaurant & a Starbucks. I took advantage of them all but would stay stick to drinks at the bar. The food was low quality, like a mom was back there showing her 8 year old how to cook. Clean, spacious rooms, really comfy bed & pillows - but request a higher floor. We were in what I would call the basment - it was the floor below the entrance. Balconies in all rooms & that's a plus.

The keys were sporadically working in our room and the pool. The bar was extremely overpriced compared to the rest of San Diego. The rooms were overpriced as well. We appreciated the shuttle. The parking fee of 22.00 is overpriced. Other places near there do not charge.

<Content>We only stayed at this hotel for one night because we were visiting Sea World the next day. It is very close to Sea World and close to lots of fun areas and the view is wonderful. The room itself needed a little bit of TLC. There was lipstick on the window because someone had kissed it and there was mold in the shower grout. There was also hair on the floor. It didn't have a central heating system- only a wall unit and the wall unit was filthy and didn't work very well. We called the front desk and they didn't seem too concerned with fixing it. We waited 30 mins for someone to show up and eventually just gave up and went to bed. In the middle of the night the smoke detector started beeping because the battery was low. So that was fun too. :)

<Content>I have stayed at many Sheraton's in the U.S. and this one is tops in my opinion. Nicely located on the marina with great views. Close to the airport so perfect for business travelers. A bit of noise from the airplanes depending on where you are located within the hotel but that is expected. Upgraded always as a Platinum member which is really nice. Main restaurant is very nice. Sports bar is good for a casual dinner and to catch the game.

<Title>“Comfortable But Noisy”
<Content>THE GOOD Customer service at the Bay Tower was fantastic; we arrived a few hours before scheduled check-in but were allowed to check-in early. Front desk staff was very nice and accommodating. Harbor view was beautiful and the room was clean and comfortable with a nautical theme. The bathroom was a bit disappointing—it looked tired like a bathroom from a 1980s family home. Still, it was manageable and everything worked fine. THE NOT-SO-GOOD Only two major complaints about the Bay Tower: the location and the noise. I booked on Priceline thinking it would be closer to Gaslamp; *technically* we could have walked there, but it would have been quite a hike. Since we didn't have a rental car (and didn't want to pay for a taxi), our exploration radius was very limited. And since we were in our room much of the time, we noticed that it was quite noisy. You could hear every sound from the hallway from quiet conversations to people dragging in from the clubs at 2-3am. And since we were there over New Year's Eve, we also heard several boisterous groups until around 4am. Unrelated: could not access free wi-fi. Decent stay overall, but probably would not stay again.

<Title>“A Perfect Stay”
<Content>We stayed here for one night before an early flight. We chose this hotel because it was close to the airport. For an airport hotel, it does not seem like one at all. The hotel is really beautiful, warm and welcoming. The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. We checked in early and received a room upgrade since we are Starwood Gold Members. The suite was spacious, new and comfortable. It had a King bed and a Queen size pull out sofa, plus a full size bar and two balconies facing the marina. The bedding was perfect. The bathroom and room were updated. The pool was heated and the jacuzzi was nice. The restaurant has good food and not too pricey. We ended up taking a later flight and we had complementary late check-out at 4:00pm because we are Starwood gold members. There is also a complementary airport shuttle that runs every 15 minutes. Overall, it was a great experience.

<Title>“A great stay at the Sheraton!”
<Content>Just got back from staying 4 nights at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. We didn't want to leave! Yes, this is a hotel across from the airport. No, it does not feel like it! The location actually couldn't be better! Not only are the views breathtaking, but it's so close to everything! Seaworld is 10 minutes away. The zoo is 10 minutes away. Coronado is 10 minutes away. Downtown is 5 minutes away. We did not hear the airport noise unless we opened our balcony and we faced the airport. The service couldn't have been better. The valet was quick and friendly, the concierge and check-in staff were also super helpful and friendly. We loved that there was a full Starbuck's on site. We went to starbuck's every morning and got coffee and they have these awesome breakfast sandwiches (bacon, egg and cheese, etc). Nice to get a quick cheap meal before heading out for the day. I go running almost every day while I am there. I love running by the water and seeing the beauty of Harbor island. Great area to run! Did not use the fitness center on this trip, but have used it in the past and found it to be quite nice. One pool is heated and even though it was December, we saw people swimming in it. Very nice pool! The room was great! A perfect size for my husband and I, plus our 2 year old and his pack-n-play. Bathroom was nothing special....Not too fond of the stark white tile, but it wasn't horrible. Amenities were nothing luxurious either. Bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. Overall, the room was probably 3-4 star (mostly because of bathroom), but I felt the Hotel and location and views made this more of a true 4 to 4.5 star property. For the price....$120 a night.... this is a top notch hotel in San Diego! You would expect it to be more expensive. Love that it isn't!

<Title>“San Diego Bay”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel Christmas Eve while visiting the Rock church and the Zoo. Just a few minutes drive from the Zoo. I booked the room on a last minute deal and got the room for 1/2 price. This is a fantastic place! We choose a Bay view rm. It had an awesome view of the city and was spectacular at night. Our rm. was also awesome, with a balcony overlooking the Bay and city. We were able to leave the slider open at night. Bath rm. was exceptional and the bed was perfect for a good night sleep. They also provided a coffee maker with starbucks coffee, (not often seen in a hotel rm.) They also have a Starbuck in the lobby,(I didn't have to drive for my morning fix!) The only negitive was the parking lot. Paid $10 per day and had to walk past the paved lot to a gravel lot way to the rear of the building. Sort of what you might expect at a truck stop! I left only because of the loudness of the airport and the smell of jet fuel in the morning.

<Title>“Nice Hotel, but its Restaurants are Crap”
<Content>Stayed here for five days for a conference. Beautiful location, albeit it's a bit out of the way. Fabulous pool in the bigger building. I stayed in their smaller (and newly acquired) building and was glad -- the other building was nicer, but it was a lot larger and a LOT louder. The restaurants... are crap. No, that's too nice; disgusting is the right word. And the outragous price just ads insult to injury. I ate in all of them (both buildings) except the fancy one. Even breakfast was gross. How do you mess up breakfast? The in-room coffee was better than the restaurant coffee. WTH? Are they trying to get you to go to their Starbucks instead? Value and rating downgraded because of the restaurants. For the love of food, do NOT eat at their restaurants. Go down the island to C Level; it's prices are better, and the food is worlds beyond better.

<Title>“this is a motel at best”
<Content>We travel a lot and this is the worst *4-star* we ever stayed in. We arrived around 10pm and were assigned to the Lanai area, which turns out to be just a fancy name for a motel (or even worse -- at least a motel won't charge $22 per day for parking). Sink doesn't drain water. Half an hour after calling front desk for locking the minibar (as we have a small kid), nobody showed up. When we called again, they said it was already done! Unbelievable. Constantly loud noise from airplanes. And when we looked at the in-room breakfast menu, someone already checked items for us! Apparently they didn't bother to check and replace it. This is a bad spot on our otherwise wonderful holiday vacation. Don't book this hotel.

<Title>“NO HOT WATER, INTERNET BROKEN, WACKY A/C”
<Content>I am not one of those hotel guests that ever complains about a hotel, and I stay in about 30 nights a year. However, I feel compelled to write about my recent stay at this hotel. I never had an unplesant experience at a hotel ever. It all started the day after I checked in. That morning I had NO hot water. None whatsoever, not even warm or room temperature water, just COLD water. I took a nice cold shower! Then I went to the front desk and I got moved to a new room on the 6th floor. I was staying in the Bay tower. Then the water in the new room was not working either.I was then moved AGAIN to a new room, finally to room 697. Finally I got working hot water. The mechanic said the entire wing of rooms on the 6th floor lost hot water due to the line going into most of the rooms. The first night during my stay I couldn't sleep at all, The A/C in the room kept turning off when the room temperature reached 65. It's hard for me to sleep in complete silence! I need the A/C to stay on! I never experienced a hotel's A/C system that doesn't let the customer keep the thing ON! The next day I had to call a mechanic, and he eventually performed some "super duper" A/C thermostat tricks and found a way to put the system to 60. and it stayed ON and cold, finally! Why this hotel doesn't let guests have this simple ability is beyond me. The fun doesn't stop here, the next night in my stay I couldn't get the internet to work on my computer. I called tech support. The mechanic had to come to my room and replace not just the cable cord, but the modem to! Who knows why, but after they replaced all of the defective equipment I finally got online. However this hotel is special! You get to choose 2 speeds! One is the regular speed at like $11, and other is an absurd price of $20 (high speed). I opted for the regular speed and took a chance. BIG MISTAKE! The speed has been the slowest speed of ANY hotel I have every stayed at! It was slow, almost like dialup internet access slow. It was probably like DSL or slower. It was sad. It was so sloooow I got so frustrated I turned my Android phone into a mobile hotspot, and guess what my Tmobile data speed was much faster than the hotel's internet speed, This hotel needs just to offer one speed, and get rid of their slow speed. However with all of the negative experiences I had at this place there were some positives to note: PLUSES: Room services, it was pretty tasty and I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail, and spicy buffalo wings. However, the chicken tenders tasted like cardboard, it was horrible. View: it's gorgeous. I felt so relaxed and peaceful here. And I enjoyed watching the christmas boat light parade as well. Room itself and bed: the bed was pretty comfy, and the room was appointed nice. I used the mini bar a lot, and thought it was convinient even though it is pricey. Anyways I am rating my stay only 2 stars because the negatives of my experience far outweighted the positives. I hope this hotel fixed their hot water issues, and also please fix your ridicolous internet speeds and only offer 1 speed. And let guests FULLY control their A/C. Thank you.

<Title>“A good basic hotel, with a great location”
<Content>Good location, at 10 minutes from the airport by walking. Comfortable and with a nice view. There is some limitations however to access this hotel by public system transportation, you must walk a good distance. Complimentary shuttle services are good reliable option. Showers lack of hot water at some hours during the morning. Also there is not free internet at the lobby, where most hotels do. The have a good green campaign which they also reward in beverages. The best option to stay next to the airport.

<Title>“Sheraton plus”
<Content>The check in was lovely. Arriving by the airport shuttle was a fantastic surprise (we had not asked at the time of booking - while at the airport we seen the 'sheraton' labelled shuttle free YES) lovely. The hotel lobby was so nice and open and fresh. The lady at the desk was wonderful. Really polite, and offered tips on our stay - what we were doing and went out of her way to help us with our check in. When I asked about allergies and restaurants, this lady went out of her way to provide us with the most accurate answer possible. Further since we were on our anniversary, and booking in early (which was some 5 hours earlier due to an earlier flight than expected) this lady checked and re-checked to give us a lovely king bed room (not queen) :)- it was appreciated. The staff overall were fantastic - the layout of the hotel was lovely. Would stay again

<Title>“Nice Hotel; Great Location”
<Content>This is a nice hotel, five minutes from the airport, with clean, large and comfortable rooms. The location is between the marinas and the bay with great views from every room. A group of three guys stayed there for the weekend that the America's Cup 45's were racing in San Diego bay. They were very accommodating and gave us a room on the eighth floor, overlooking the bay so we could watch the races from the balcony. There was plenty of room for the rollaway bed they provided free of charge. We had breakfast in the very nice restaurant down stairs, and while it was $20, the food and service was good.

<Title>“Nice hotel, close to the airport, great service”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at the Bay Tower of this Sheraton over the week of Thanksgiving in 2011. The hotel is nice, has a lot of space, and is quiet. The rooms are basic but nice, including a couch and coffee table area to sit (Tip: The Bay Tower has larger rooms than those in the Marina Tower, which don't have the couch and extra space). The bathrooms need some updating: there's no fan and the sundries are generic. The views overlooking the marina are nice. The hotel is very close to the airport and is convenient for that reason. The service at the hotel was great. Anything we needed they brought immediately and were very accomodating. They unfortunately do not have cribs available if you're travelling with an infant, as we were, but that's a specific need. Overall, not a luxury hotel, but an affordable and decent place to stay.

<Content>Awesome locale on the marina located literally across from the airport and the Oil Lamp District and Old Town within sight. Beautiful, balmy weather for a stroll along the marina. Rooms are top-notch and excellently maintained by a professional and engaging staff. Wonderful amenities such as the excercise room and pool, club lounges, and superb restaurant. Outstanding conference rooms available with a well-trained and equipped staff to help make for successful conferences. Though close to the airport with hotel shuttles available, be sure to rent a car and visit the many wonderful sights that San Diego and outlying areas have to offer. The Oil Lamp Disrict. Old Town, Sea World, San Diego Zoo & Wildlife Park, the Birch Aquarium at Scripps, and more!

<Title>“Excellent stay”
<Content>Stayed in a club room for 4 nights before catching a cruise home to Australia. I was very pleasantly surprised after reading various reviews. Views were superb and the hotel is angled so that great views of both the bay and the marina are available from various places on each floor. Good phot ops. Staff were very cooperative. I booked through expedia so got free internet and club access but we had trouble getting our key to access the club floor from the lift. It was all sorted out with the utmost courtesy. Room was clean, well equipped etc. No wifi in the rooms. Internet was wired which was a bother for my friend and her ipad. I'd certainly recommend paying for the club level. Breakfast was good and the evening crudites, dips, cheeses and hot dish meant we could have a big lunch and not pay for an evening meal. If you factor this in, the US$30 a day for valet parking is worth every cent.

<Content>Having lived in San Diego for years before I moved to Chicago, I know this hotel very well. Traveling on business, I have stayed here a few times over the past years, and never once been disappointed. It is an excellent place for a business meeting or conference, and located so very well to jump in a car or a cab and go out for dinner and a relaxing evening with family once the meetings are done! Superb service makes it such a joy, and you don't have to worry about doing good business while staying at this hotel, and also having your family very happy to be along, too!

<Title>“Got married here, they gave us a free room, called it a "suite"”
<Content>So there is nothing really WRONG with the individual pieces of this hotel at a glance.... The premises are nice, the rooms are clean, it's close to the airport. BUT, when you start adding it all up and looking at it as a total package, that's when the criticism comes in... I married my wife here in August 2011. Overall, I was very happy with their wedding packages. For only 105$ per person we got a great buffet dinner, 4 HOURS OF OPEN BAR (yay!) and someone who somewhat was a wedding coordinator. I really have no complaints about the wedding stuff. Everything went great, the staff were very helpfule with the setup. The only thing is that some stuff went missing, but that could have been our guests for all I know. Or an honest mistake, and could have gotten thrown away. The room they threw in was really two adjoining rooms and they just opened the door. Hardly a suite by any definition. They were nice rooms, but not a suite. If you get married here, make sure to dicuss that. The nice thing is that we ended up with a view of the bay. Either side of the hotel is not bad, pretty much all the views are good. Also, they charge for parking. If you are the bride and groom, you can get comped, but they will charge all of your guests, and parking is not cheap. If you get married here, they have some pretty good opportunities for photos. We took ours with the San Diego skyline in the background. If you are NOT getting married here then this hotel is ok if you are on business and have a car. Like I said, rooms are clean, etc, but there is not a coffee shop nearby, or a breakfast place, and room service is expensive. If you are in SD to have a good time, I'd suggest staying in Little Italy or the Gaslamp. The Gaslamp will be noisier, but is closer to fun bars/clubs. Little Italy is also fun, but a bit quieter, better for a family. This hotel is 3-5 miles from the Gaslamp and harbor tours, not great if you are here trying to see stuff. But if your goal is to be close to the airport, and you have no desire to leave the room, this hotel might be right for you. Even though room service is expensive, they have alternate options for dining close by. There are some restaurants on harbor island that are withing half mile to a mile away. Email me with questions, I know lots about this stuff!

Never saw the maids but rooms were cleaned efficiently daily on our 4 night stay. Restaurants were a bit pricey but the food was very good.

Food was good, staff excellent. The conference rooms were neither too hot or too cold (first time ever in my experience) but were "just right". The doors to individual rooms did not SLAM every time someone came or went (but closed well) as in most places, and the curtains truly did keep out the light and the noise. I'd go back in a minute.

<Content>It's simple - I travel in from the east coast for business on Sunday night, arriving at 10 p.m., take the shuttle to the hotel, in bed 45 minutes after landing. The next morning, Hertz, Avis and National are a quick walk from Marina Tower to pick up the rental car and drop off at the end of the trip (night before the flight to avoid the return hassle). It is in a great location to access Old Town, Downtown San Diego, north to the beaches, and the views are incredible. I have stayed in most of the Starwood properties in the region and for a business traveller, this is a most convenient location. The fitness facility has state of the art equipment, for me, an important part of business travel. I have even rented bikes when I have some down time, ridden downtown to the Broadway Pier and taken the ferry over to Coronado for a nice afternoon ride. All in all it has been a nice "base" when I am in San Diego.

<Title>“Beautiful views, inconvenient location.”
<Content>I will definitely remember the gorgeous view of the marina at night, sunrise, all day long. The free shuttle to the airport is great, and from there, you can catch the $5 all-day bus that goes all over the city. Being close to the airport is important, because this place is not close to ANYTHING else. Plan to bus or taxi everywhere unless you have a car. The taxis are not cheap in SD, and public transportation is slow and circuitous. There are several hotel restaurants, with about the same food in all. We thought the place was rather pricey for being so isolated, but this is an expensive town.

<Title>“Ok, but not worth the price, and certainly not for leisure travelers”
<Content>Look, this place is nice, and the staff for the MOST part is friendly, HOWEVER, if you are not staying here for business, i recomend you do NOT stay Here. The biggest problem i had/AM HAVING, is PARKING. Okay, so in san diego, you can expect to pay for parking almost everywhere, including hotels with high rates like this place; im not going to hold that against them. What i WILL hold against them, is that on the third night i was here (today actually) we left to go to Sea World and to sight see, and came back exhausted, only to find out the side of the parking lot that we had been parking, at (WHICH WE HAD TO PAY FOR MIND YOU)was closed for some highly irritating event. we ended up having to park on the other side furthest from our room, and while the walk was not too horrible, it was not short either, and add to that being exhausted, and having to park in a crappy place after paying a fairly high amount for parking ($22 PER night), i was NOT happy. But what ensures that i will NOT stay here again, is that NOBODY SAID OR POSTED ANYTHING...ANYTHING about this event, and about that portion of the parking lot being closed. And if they did it must have been like a few minutes before the event. Certainly not the night before, not on their website, and no one at the front dest brought it to our attention, at any point. Had we been informed we would have at LEAST been ready to walk a bit and plan accordingly on our sightseeing trip. Add to that the parking staff outside taking an attitude of hostility to us when we inquired as to why we could not park where we had been, and why nothing had been posted about it. Very rude. We did not as a result bother going out to eat, out of worrying about dealing with parking...great way to end a trip. Im not a person who generally holds hotels to unreasonable standards, but for the price paid, and the parking that i paid for (even if just self parking), i think i should have been informed somehow that parking would be a mess on my last night, so i could have planned accordingly and i dont think i should have had to have delt with snotty rude parking attendants. When the manager was approached about the parking situation, he told me quite clearly that parking PARKING SPACES ARE NOT GUARANTEED...but said he THOUGHT there should'nt be a problem. I honestly think it is unprofessional for a hotel to not know its own capacity, or amount of people coming to an event. The manager did offer to valet the car free of charge, bit it still put a cramp on our trip All in all the place is NOT worth the price paid...they charge for virtually everything, and paying for self parking does in no way (unless you pay more for valet) guarantee a spot...something that was not made clear at booking. If you are here for leisure they will not care about your experience. Their special events clearly are more important than the experience for an individual average joe guest; i dont hold it against them; they are a business and big events make them money, but just be aware of this. For the price, unless you are here on Business i would not recomend staying here. The location IS good (if you have a car) but again parking isn't guaranteed even though they do charge you. Check-in staff are very friendly and helpful but the parking staff is hit and miss. The main reason i cant recommend this hotel, is because its lack of consideration of guests who pay for parking, by failing to inform them clearly of events that may cause issues leaving or arriving

<Title>“Great place to stay for MCRD graduation”
<Content>My son graduated from the Marine Corps on Novemeber the 4th. I scoured the internet looking for the best deal for the whole family to be able to go. I was concerned when after much comaprison shopping I booked a flight and stay at this hotel with savings of over 1,100 for our party! (What was I going to get?). When we landed I saw our hotel. It is very near the airport and also very close to the reason for our trip Marine Corps Recruit Depot. We stayed in the bay tower portion of the hotel. The lobby was clean and desk help was exceptional! They informed us that the package we booked included breakfast all the days of our stay as well as a free shuttle to and from MCRD This by itself was a fantastic bonus! We asked for a higher floor and rather than bay view, we chose the marina view. Decorated in a nautical theme; the rooms were very clean, the beds comfortable, had an amply stocked mini bar and a large balcony to enjoy San Diegos beautiful weather and watch all the boats sail. The hotel was close enough to either take a taxi to Old Town for some sight seeing (which we really enjoyed)..or rent a car..which we also did..and took the short drive over to Coronado Island had some fantastic pizza, a little shopping and played on the beach. After graduation my son was never so happy to see a soft bed or hot tub in in his life! We really enjoyed the nice pool facilities. In short our trip was great . We got a great price on a clean comfortable room in San Diego near everything we needed to do and wanted to see!

<Title>“Great price, OK location”
<Content>Stayed here Halloween weekend in order to visit friends and check out the Gaslamp District nightlife. The hotel was nice- room was clean, roomy, comfortable. We used Priceline and only paid $85 for a Saturday night so we think we got a fabulous deal. We even had a little balcony with a view of the harbor. The only thing people should be wary of, is this hotel is very close to the airport but about a 4-mile walk to the Gaslamp Dist. so if you want to dress up and go downtown, you need to take a cab- it cost us about $11 plus tip.

<Title>“It is what it is, an expense account hotel near the airport”
<Content>We were in San Diego for a conference which was held at the Sheraton. It is a large, sprawling hotel (> 1,000 rooms) with a couple of towers and a sprawling ‘resort’ wing called Lanai . There is also a second tower (350 rooms) which is about a 10 minute walk along the marina from the main hotel. We were put in the ‘Lanai’, a wing that if you squint your eyes a little you would think is a Mexican Resort Hotel complete with aqua painted pools, palm trees and outdoor type ‘hall ways’. The main difference from Mexican resorts are the hot tubs associated with each pool and reliable hot water in the rooms. Our room was nice enough, it had been tastefully updated in the last several years so everything, except the bathtub, which hotels seem reluctant to update, was new. The tub was a little worn and corroded around the drain. The marble sink counter was also stained, a problem I have seen in other hotels with marble counter tops. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet except when the folks upstairs were moving around. In the tradition of expense account hotels things like WiFi and internet ($20/day) and parking ($30/day) cost extra not to mention the exorbitant cost of the contents of the mini bar, the restocking fees of the minibar and the fact that you can’t use the minibar fridge for your own stuff. In addition the restaurant/breakfast buffet were expensive for what you got. That said the service was great, check in was fast, there is a shuttle that runs every ten minutes from the airport. If you are just flying in and out to a conference and you are on an expense account it is a great place to be. If you want to see the city, which is definitely worth seeing, then this hotel is definitely a bit out of the way, about a $15- 20 taxi ride. Public transportation in the vicinity of the hotel is negligible. The waterfront tourist attractions are about 3 miles away but there is a nice wide promenade type sidewalk between Harbour Drive, a main thorough fare, and the water if you are up to walking. So it wasn’t a great location for a spouse along for the trip as was our case. The hotel also seems to be a bit of a staging place for folks who are going and coming from cruise ships. Probably it works well for them. I will definitely return to San Diego with my wife but next time I will stay on one of the many downtown hotels where we can really enjoy what this fine city has to offer visitors.

<Title>“This really should say : SHERATON AIRPORT HOTEL”
<Content>If you are looking for a family vacation resort, this is NOT for you. You have to drive through the airport to get to this hotel, which is IMMEDIATELY adjacent to the airport. We made the mistake of not carefully studying the map before booking this hotel. With that said, we got a Marina suite, which is very spacious, comes with 2 large flat screen TVs, 2 closets, but the bathroom was EXTREMELY small. We have 2 balconies that faces the harbor, and the view is breathtaking. Nothing is walking distance from the hotel, so you would have to drive or take a shuttle. The upgrade to club access is well worth it since they do serve breakfast and afternoon snacks. You do hear planes flying above as they takeoff and land, but it's not overwhelmingly disturbing. The sleep quality is poor. It's the type of mattress where as soon as you get on or off, you can hear the springs compress or decompress. Overall, although this hotel is "cheaper" than the other Starwood hotels nearby, considering it's close proximity to the airport and what you are getting, staying at the W, Westin, or US Grant will get you more bang for the buck.

<Title>“Tired, tiny and smelly pillows”
<Content>This may be the straw that breaks my SPG habit, or at least, it will be the last of my Sheraton stays in the US. Have enjoyed great stays in S America and other places, but this tired and somewhat dumpy hotel doesn't deserve to be a category 3 much less a category 4. Have a tiny room, the pillows smell like they've been stuck up someone's armpit, and a view overlooks the parking lot. No wireless in the room (Club room). But, at least, I'm not getting calls and voicemails every couple of hours to buy into a timeshare, so this is an improvement over my end of the year Orlando stay.

<Content>This hotel is beautiful, if you want to relax, it's quiet, the marina is beautiful, and the best thing if you want to explore San Diego's attractions, everything is within walking distance. We took the boat cruise for see lions watching and it was really nice! One beautiful beach is 5 min from the hotel, but you can enjoy at the pool if you don't feel to go anywhere. The staff is friendly and helpful. We will stay again for sure here.

<Title>“Lots of hidden gems - great meeting hotel”
<Content>This was my second stay in the last two years and though I'm usually not a huge Sheraton fan I really like this property a lot. Both times I was there for conventions and as others note the hotel is across the road from the airport and a ways from downtown. Since my partner and I walk this wasn't a huge issue. We simply walked the couple of miles downtown, a lovely walk, and took taxis to Balboa Park and Old Town. Within walking distance of the hotel are two restaurants, C-Level and Island Prime, that are consistent winners for us. On to the hotel. Check-in was a breeze. We arrived almost two hours early and just walked into a room, very nice. The property includes a few different buildings and I think may include some longer term and time share units in places. The Marina Tower is in the main part of the hotel. The Bay Tower is a bit of a stroll across the marina. We've only stayed in the Marina Tower and have been glad we did given its proximity to the restaurant, etc. We've eaten at the restaurant, service was good and food just ok. Quinn's, the on site tavern and eatery seems to have better food and has a decent selection of draft beers and nice ambiance (overlooks the marina and pool, or you can watch sports on any of a number of tvs). There are 3 tennis courts that we used every day and in two visits I don't think I've ever seen anyone else use them. Good condition, decent courts. There are two swimming pools and two hot tubs. We tended to like the smaller hot tub near the tennis courts. Unfortunately both the pools and hot tubs close at 10pm. The first time we stayed here, just over a year ago, that closing time was strictly enforced so even though we were a quiet couple in our 50's just relaxing we got chased. This time when 10pm and the guards rolled around we were sharing the hot tub with a pretty rowdy group of Canadians who successfully lobbied for one more 15 minute round in the tub. I thought it was an improvement for the guards to give folks a break. Re the rooms, they're very comfortable, not new but not run down either. The bathroom was nice though we had an issue with the bathroom sink draining slowly. We reported it and it was fixed immediately - then we were given a $50 "experience adjustment" credit for our trouble. We used it at the gift shop. Frankly I attribute that to the power of media like TripAdvisor - to avoid a bad review, and sure enough here I am recommending the hotel rather than whining about a slow sink. A couple other gems here - there are two fire pits by the marina that are just plain cool, and rocking chairs suitable for just relaxing by the fire. This property has lots of spaces for couples to just drift hand in hand. The grounds are well maintained and it's an expansive property. We took cabs to Balboa Park and Old Town, about $15 each way each time, and walked downtown. Other friends at the same convention also walked downtown - though all of us are walkers, we're also all in our 50's and 60's so don't be too afraid to take it on. Leaving - nothing is easier. Free airport shuttle. Oh re the meeting rooms, etc., standard hotel issue. With the exception of the main banquet the food was unremarkable, however, at our main lunch banquet everything was a notch above usual conference food (a wonderful tomato cream soup served hot for example). When you're traveling with the love of your life it's easy to find things to enjoy, and with the combination of this hotel and San Diego we had a wealth of wonders to choose from.

<Title>“You're in the Ourskirts Conventioner; Deal With It”
<Content>You are going to the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina only because your company sent you there for a convention or meeting. You arrive and discover it's a friendly place with great accomodations and you are near the aiport. How convenient. But you are dismayed to learn you are away from the action of lovely San Diego and restricted, for meals, to the hotel's two restaurants -- a pub that is reasonably priced but cacaphonous and crowded and a luxurious but overpriced restaurant. You would like to see the sights of Dan Diego but you dont want to rent a car because your down time is restricted to evenings and periods when you are not in convention sessions. Here's how we dealt with it. 1. We requested the pub menu in the restaurant, so we got less expensive meals in refined surroundings. 2. If you are willing to stroll, you can go to three other resturants at the marina. We recommend the closest one, Island Prime, particularly its less expensive wing, Level C, It has a great view of the skyline and the service is friendly. They have a good wine tasting option and the Mud Pie ice cream is to die for (and big enough for six people). 3. Downtown San Diego is a $15 cab ride away including generous tip. But the best option is the inexpensive one. Take the Sheraton Shuttle to the airport and ask the driver to leave you at the MTS bus stop. The 923 bus goes to downtown San Diego ($2.25 per ride, $1.10 for seniors over 60). Once downtown you are in the Gaslight District and you can connect to other buses, including ones we took to Coronado and Balboa Park. 4. We loved Balboa Park. You can spend a whole day there at the zoo and museums. If you want to stretch your legs there are trails alongside. The whole experience is better than Epcot in our opinion. (For lunch try the Japanese Garden restaurant. Teryaki meat, fish and vegeratian over rice are yummy. $11 each with drinks) 5. The Gaslight District has terrific restaurants. A local shopkeeper recommended "La Strada" 702 5th Street and we had a great meal. The linguini with clams was fabulous. 6. Take the 201 bus from downtown to Coronado and stroll around the Del Coronado Hotel, a national landmark.

<Title>“Beautiful Shoreline Hotel”
<Content>My husband, son, and I stayed at this hotel over July 4th. It is just a few minutes from the San Diego Airport, but not in direct line with the runways, so there was no jet noise. It is also right on the water, and with a room facing the water, we had a fantastic view of the fireworks that night. It had easy access and was convenient for driving to other areas of San Diego. I especially liked the way the room was set up. The bed FACED the windows instead of being sideways to the windows like in most hotels, so you could sit in bed at night and look at the lights. The room was spotless as was the rest of the property, and the landscaping surrounding the hotel was very nice. If I remember correctly, there was also a sidewalk between the hotel and water that you could walk around the marina on. Depending on when you stay, and if you have AAA or some other discount plan, you can get a reasonable price for this hotel. At other times, the price can be double. We are going on a cruise in December and I was anxious to book this hotel again for our pre-cruise stay. However, there is a convention going on that week and when I first checked it out, the price had skyrocketed. The second time I checked, there were no rooms available. The only reason I am giving this hotel 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is not within walking distance to restaurants, and the hotel restaurant is pricey, as expected. We did go ahead and eat breakfast at the restaurant which was excellent, but again, it was not a "breakfast included" type of hotel and the cost for breakfast was about $15 per person, I think. But as I said, I did love this hotel and would stay there again. And for those who aren't budget minded, this is definitely a hotel you will love.

<Title>“tired hotel next to airport”
<Content>My husband and I recently spent 3 nights at the Sheraton while attending a conference. After a 60 second drive from the airport (yes, it is that close!), we checked into our room on the 9th floor. The lobby of the hotel was nice, although very busy with people attending a variety different conferences. The hallway to our room was scattered with leftover room service items. Our room was small, which was fine. The bathroom was recently redone. It sadly had no place to hang towels so when finished with them, we just set them on the floor. The shower curtain smelled like mildew. All the rooms have small balconies with a view of the water or downtown but if you open the balcony door you are bombarded with sound of jets landing and taking off. The outside of the property was nice, with several pools and a walking path. All in all, it is a very average convention hotel next to the airport.

<Title>“Nice stay, but nothing to write home about.”
<Content>When we arrived we discovered we were in the Bay Tower, not the Maruna Tower. We had no idea they were two separate locations and didn't discover it until bags were out of the car and lugged quite aways, after a 6 hour drive. The lady that checked us in was very nonchalant about it... We could take a 5minute walk, bags in tow or drag them back to the car and drive.FRUSTRATING! Our room was nicely decorated, beds were wonderful, all our contacts with employees was great! Our room could have been cleaner and they definitely should have changed the shower curtain (even the slightest bit of mold freaks me out). Overall a good stay, but I expect a spotless room for the amount we paid.

I have stayed here in the past for both business and quick San Diego weekend getaways and have never been disappointed. Will definately stay here again, especially when chartering a boat as it is a short 3 minute walk to the docks.

<Title>“Too many extra costs”
<Content>I will try to be objective and review this hotel fairly, though I was quite annoyed at how much this hotel tries to rob you at every opportunity. The check-in staff were polite. We were informed on check-in of a $30 a night parking fee (our stay was 4 nights), and when I inquired about how to access in-room internet they told me it was $19 a night for high speed internet. High speed internet was crap, it was less than a quarter of the speed of the internet I got at the Trump in Las Vegas. We were given two vouchers for complimentary breakfast for our stay, for which we were very grateful, though once we were seated in the restaurant and given menus we weren't quite sure what we were allowed to choose from. This was soon cleared up when someone came and took the menus back and said that we could only eat from the buffet. After eating the 'buffet' once, we decided not to use the second voucher. The room also has a fridge, but only for the rip off minibar, you weren't allowed to use it. Not only did it quote exorbitant prices on the mini bar it also had a RESTOCKING fee in the fine print. How does get buggered sound? I'm not going to pay $5 for a small drink and then pay you 20% extra just to restock it. The room itself was reasonable and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was a bit grubby though In all honesty I probably wouldn't have paid attention to this things had the hotel not been charging me extras at every opportunity, I found myself picking on things in the room just because they were being cheap. What sort of hotel doesn't have complementary in room internet these days??? Given that the last day of our USA trip was to be spent at this hotel before we drove to LAX, we decided that with the $30 parking fee and $19 internet per day in our room we'd be better off just finding a cheap room in Anaheim on our last nights stay so we were closer to the airport on the last day. We checked out early even though we had already paid for the room for the night and spend what we saved on ridiculous fees on a room in Anaheim.

<Title>“Very accommodating, clean, right on harbor.”
<Content>My wife and I have stayed here a couple of times during a business convention I had. Great location on the harbor. Both times, we got a room in the bay tower, harbor side, high floor. These rooms are equipped with balconies that overlook the harbor and the air force base. The sound of the helicopters didn't bother me at all during the day, but I did hear some people complaining about it. I found it very interesting to watch their training everyday. Nice rooms and very clean. Some need updating but clean nonetheless. Grounds are easy to get around on and there are little cafe's and bars and breakfast places within and around the hotel. The staff is very accommodating and prompt with special requests. Just a great place in a great city!

<Title>“fantastic hotel”
<Content>We really enjoyed our stay here, we were in the Bay Tower which we were quite grateful for as there was a big conference on in the main hotel. If you want to be in the city centre, this hotel isn't for you, but if you want nice service, and lovely rooms with a fantastic view I highly recommend this hotel. My only criticism is the lack of a laundry in the Bay Tower, we were told the laundry is on floor 5 of the Marina Tower, the Sheraton info booklet does not state this it all, and we were looking everywhere in our tower for the laundry which is the only reason this hotel did not get 5 stars from us.

<Title>“****BAY VIEW TO DIE FOR****”
<Content>We stayed 4 days over Labor Day weekend to attend a wedding. What a beautiful view, area and hotel. Wonderful walking area or we could just sit in our room and watch the boats, ships and life go by. We will definitely be back. It was so easy to just fly in, free shuttle to hotel, and everything you need is soooo close.

<Title>“Clean and Convenient”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel while attending a conference. My options were to stay in the main hotel where the convention center is, or stay in the tower. Knowing that I would be sitting all day at conferences, I chose the tower which is a block away. I was very happy with my choice. The rooms are updated, modern, and clean. The staff, from the bellboys to the front desk, are friendly and helpful. Great experience overall.

<Title>“There are much better options”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this Sheraton on the last night of our trip to San Diego, before flying out the next morning. During the previous four nights of our trip we stayed in a WONDERFUL hotel right in downtown San Diego. The price of this Sheraton vs. the downtown hotel were virtually the same, so I expected the same quality hotel & experience. Boy, was I wrong. First of all, the Sheraton is out on Harbor Island, a strip of land that is apparently still being deveoped for tourists and doesn't contain much of anything except for a few hotels. We were dropped off at the hotel by a cab driver around 5PM and literally felt STRANDED for the rest of the evening. There are two restaurants inside the Sheraton, both of which are offensively overpriced. We left the hotel in search of food, and after walking over a mile, found a gas station-like store that sold prepackaged sandwiches. We trudged back to the hotel and reluctantly went to the cheaper of the two restaurants inside. We both ordered $16 hamburgers. That would be $16 each. The food was average at best and the service was neglectful at best. Definitely a frustrating venture. Secondly, I'm still confused about this hotel and what part of it we stayed in. The main entrance of the hotel is beuatiful and plush looking. When we checked in, we were instructed to follow a long hallway to the right. At the end of this hallway we stepped into an elevator foyer that looked completely different from the main part of the hotel. The carpet and wallpaper were old and discolored. It was like we all of a sudden were transported to an old motel. Once we reached our floor, it still felt like a motel, not a "nice" hotel - the hallway smelled stale, and there were several room service food trays laying throughout the hallway. Without even entering our room yet, I felt ripped off. I was immediately wishing we had just booked another night at our downtown hotel that was GORGEOUS and equally priced. Along the same lines of this confusing split-personality of the hotel - there are two pools outside. One is luxurious and updated. The other, right next to it, is older and smaller. Our hotel key would not allow access to the nicer pool. We were apparently relegated as "second-class" and were only allowed key access to the smaller pool. This was all VERY confusing and practically embarassing. There were no signs of explanation as to the difference between the two pools that were RIGHT next to each other. I will say that the room itself at the Sheraton was very lovely. It actually felt updated, clean, and new. I loved the color-scheme. Because there was NOTHING to do on Harbor Island, we just got in bed early and watched t.v. for the rest of the night. Overall, I would NOT recommend this hotel if you are in San Diego for more than just a layover. If you do not have a car, cab rides to and from downtown are about $14 each way. Although that is cheaper than a hamburger on Harbor Island, it is not worth the price just to get far enough away from the hotel to find something to do. There are PLENTY of hotels in downtown San Diego that are the exact same price and are INCREDIBLY nicer. Bottom line, this Sheraton isn't terrible, but you can do much better.

<Title>“great time in San Diego”
<Content>Had a great time in San Diego, the Sheraton was good, we had a beautiful view of the bay, watched the ships and boats go buy. The food was good. Its is out of the way to get to Gas Lamp Quarters and the Sea Port villlage, wouldn't stay there for that reason only, its a $20 cab ride each way. They need a shuttle, and that would be great. We did the green way at the hotel which gave you $5.00 per day back in a coupon, we used that at the resturants, or store. All in all it was great but the need a shuttle to the convention centre.

<Title>“Close to the airport but not close to anything else”
<Content>This was a nice hotel that is conveniently close to the airport. They even provide free shuttles that leaves pretty much every 15mins. I stayed at the Bay Tower overlooking the bay. It was fun to see the aircraft carriers and military aircrafts on Coronado island. The noise is not too bad. Rooms are fairly modern and spacious. The main Marina tower is good with a full Starbucks. Service was fast and efficient with Taxis always available. The gym and pool was in good shape. The Bay Tower seems dated and more cozy compared to the Marina tower. The hotel is good for a quick stay in San Diego but if you're staying more than 3-4 nights I would suggest you stay downtown as there are more things to see and do. They should look into a shuttle service for quick downtown trips.

<Title>“Post Cruise hotel....near airport, but not much nearby.”
<Content>If you are looking for a lovely place to relax for a DAY in San Diego with immediate airport access, you cannot beat this hotel. It is not cheap, but if you are on business or booked at in conjunction with a cruise or something else, it is worth the money. However.... besides the lovely location and the beautiful walk along the harbor, there is really NOTHING out here and it's a cab ride to any other interesting parts of San Diego.

<Title>“nice hotel near the airport”
<Content>6$ cab ride or free shuttle to airport. Hotel is redone and nice. I was there for conference but saw children and families, navy personnel, weddings, functions and a whole mixture. Nice pool and great fitness facilities. 15$ cab ride to Horton Plaza or Gaslamp area. Conference facilities good. And the staff ... very good in comparison to other Sheraton's this one's a keeper.

<Title>“Convenient, Clean, Comfortable accomodations”
<Content>This hotel had very comfortable, airy rooms that were perfect on our recent visit to San Diego. Although near the airport and harbor, there was little noise and night and a staff willing to assist. The staff was helpful in getting around in the city and directed us to our destinations. In particular Mark, bell captain, acted as concierge and offered some great insight about his city and we were most grateful. He also made suggestions and reservations at Island Prime for our anniversary dinner. The meal and service there was excellent. We thank him for his courtesy. There were two problems that came up during our stay, They charge $22 per day for self parking that never seemed to work correctly and $18 per day for wired in internet. Since there was no wi-fi, we ended up at Starbucks to go on the net for emails and directions to some of our destinations. We think Sheraton should look into in room wi-fi right away. The parking problem was a due to card reader issue with the room keys. Management was working on the problem and it worked once for us but the bug returned. We would highly recommend a stay there because of the quality of the property, location and convenience to get around. We would definitely return there in the future.

<Title>“Great meeting experience”
<Content>I was an attendee at a meeting at the hotel last week and had a great experience. I have stayed at other Starwood products in San Diego previously but never this Sheraton. I thought the Banquet staff were both warm and attentive. All of our needs were met and exceeded in a way most hotels do not. The hotel planned a boat outing for us one evening that all of our attendees greatly enjoyed. My guest room had a small balcony that overlooked the marina, and I enjoyed the view and weather very much. Hotel has all the typical Sheraton amenities like the Sweet Sleeper Bed and Link in the lobby that allowed our attendees to stay connected for free. Great experience for our group event.

<Title>“A very nice hotel.”
<Content>The rooms are very spacious. The bathrooms are a little small but still nice. Just two small things I noticed when we got to our room. There was silverware outside our room and a little hair in the floor and the side of the bathtub. A little more attention to detail by housekeeping would take care of this. Love the balcony with table and chairs looking out over the water. Overall a nice hotel.

<Title>“Nice if you stay in the main tower!”
<Content>This property has 2 towers about 5 blocks from each other. The Bay Tower has some nice ocean views but it appears to be their overflow hotel and too far from all the amenities of the main building. It looks like they put their guests who have booked discounted rates in this tower. The rooms are big with flat screen tv's, but the bathroom was filthy. Hair in the tub and toothpaste all over the wall. I booked this room through Priceline which includes it with the downtown hotels. It is not a downtown hotel. It is an airport hotel with about a 1 hour walk into the downtown. I walked it! The main property has a nice lobby with lots of free internet stations, a Starbucks, nice dining areas and a beautiful pool.

<Title>“Amazing Experience”
<Content>This hotel is located on Harbor Island, on a small strip of land right across from the airport. It is beautifully decorated to feel like you are on a ship. VERY NAUTICAL! I was traveling alone on business and I felt very safe and comfortable. The rooms have balconies with views of the Navy vessels coming in and out of the harbor AND views of the boats docked in the harbor. The military helicopters are crusing around and you can't help but get the feeling that our country is being protected. You can feel the excitement and energy of San Diego and sleep in an amazing room. . .The bed, shower, coffee machines. . . It made me feel very special. . . .Highly recommend this place.

<Title>“Great hotel for plane watchers”
<Content>I got this hotel on Priceline and was at first annoyed since its included in the downtown area but its all the way over by the airport. But turns out the views from the hotel are great, it looks like its been relatively recently renovated as well. Get a room on a higher floor, half the hotel faces the harbor with great views of Coronado Island and downtown as well as the airport. The other half faces the Marina. I'm a travel nerd so I like watching planes land and had a great view of the runway. Beware of parking since you have to at least pay the self parking rate of $22 there is no free parking around there. Also the rooms have wired internet not wireless.

<Title>“Great Value but can't walk to downtown”
<Content>This hotel always offer great rates and if you are looking to stay near sea world and the bay its a good location. If you are looking to indulge in the nightlife of the gaslamp district you are better off at the W, Hard Rock or the US Grant hotel. This is primarily a tourist hotel for families or a good place to stay if you have a flight out the San Diego airport. The hotel is starting to show its age and is need for an update.

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton due to a conference my wife and i wanted to attend. When registering we paid for a room on a higher floor that promised a view of the harbor and city. When we checked in we were told the rooms were being cleaned and they would call us in a couple of hours to check in. We went site seeing and came back SEVEN hours later, the check in was busy and finally got the bell captain to help us. We were informed they didn't have a upper floor room and we were placed on tthe "fourth" floor - which actually was the 2nd floor overlooking a beautiful gravel roof overhand! Complaints went unanswered until 3 days later when we were finally given a rate adjustment back to the convention rate. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!

<Title>“Business stay, great surroundings, catering pretty good”
<Content>Stayed for 3 days in mid-Sept. Hotel is on great running trails. Gym is very good. Rented a bike there, too. It wasn't in the greatest shape, but I was just cruising and had a great time because it was available cheaply ($7/hr). There were a couple of pools but it would have been better if at least one of them were set up so you could do laps. One is long enough but curvy, so you can't seriously swim straight across and back for an extended workout. They're just designed for splashing and lounging. Room was nice enough and comfortable. I liked that you could decline housekeeping service and get a $5 credit. Hotel has lots of enviro features, which I appreciated. The catered meals were very good. We ate breakfasts and lunches on a lawn outside the conference center, which was really nice. Watch out for heels sinking into the grass and slightly damp chairs in the morning, but I enjoyed it. The bar food was standard hotel fare. Only thing that raised my eyebrows is during a snack break, they served sports energy bars--as snacks! I scooped up a couple because I would only eat these on a 7-mile or longer run--they were packed with glucose/fructose/sucrose. Believe me, most people at the conference did not need to be eating athletic fuel bars as a snack between sedentary meeting sessions. Overall I really enjoyed my time there, and would consider going back for business, though probably not the family because there weren't a lot of restaurants close by and we try to do more economic eating when on longer stays with the kids.

<Title>“avoid marina view low numbered rooms”
<Content>I found the rooms to be clean and well serviced, the food as reasonably priced as you would expect and the staff generally personable, but, reversing stacker trucks emptying vehicles and and trash at 5 am wasn't on. You know the sound beep beep beep, on and on... Check in staff asked what i wanted them to do about it! Stop it was appropriate, but they had the glazed expression of those whose neckties were stopping the blood flo to the brain. If you stay here don't take one of those rooms ( i was in 1000 on 10th floor). Check your bill on exit too, both me and a colleague had unaccounted items on the bill. ( it was a convention with a full house so perhaps they should be allowed leeway , but keep a check)

<Title>“Poor value and even poorer service”
<Content>Stayed here for a business trip. Found out after I checked in that parking is $22 per day, added to the room; valet is $30. The main parking is quite far from the entrance - all side entrances are looked and you must walk all the way to the front to enter the hotel. Must use room key to enter and exit parking area. When checking in, your credit card is authorized $200 more than the cost of the room for "incidentals." No exceptions. Not told this in advance either. The hotel staff is less than helpful. Try asking for restaurant recommendations or what to do in San Diego. Better off asking for help from locals outside the hotel. My room, at a conference rate, was $169 per night. Not bad for San Diego, but what do you get? An armchair with a ottoman next to it, a small dresser, a huge with no drawer, two nightables, a small TV, and a very small bathroom. The closet is teeny tiny as well. And no free WI-FI - you have to pay an extra $12 bucks per day. At check in the desk clerk wanted to give me two queen size beds with a city view. Hello...my reservation was for a KING size. What do you know, one was available with a marina view. For that price, it darn well better be a marina view. Will I be back? No way.

<Title>“In every way, an awful place...”
<Content>I had one of my worst hotel experiences at this hotel. Lured by the mention of "billions of dollars in renovations, I expected -- for the money I spent per night, a luxury hotel experience. Let's start with the bathroom - very cramped and the "soaking tub" was a small plastic molded tub that only a child could bathe it. The light switches were put in very crooked. There was, I think, a hole in the wall that had a weird, hand cut plastic sheet over it. It was not enitrely clean and neither was the rest of the room. Weird bed layout had your bed FACING a huge mirror which mean you had not chocie but to see yourself everytime you glanced up from a book if reading in bed or when watching TV. I always test the honesty of hotel staff but leaving a dollar bill on the floor. In the hunderd times before that I had done this, the bill was always neatly placed on a piece of furniure. Not this time. Trash was not removed from my room, and it was very clear from debris on the rug that it wasn't vacuumed. The direct line to room service often did not work; they did not answer, and the front desk would say they would call me back, which they only did 50% of the time. The food was barely passable, and I stayed at a 4 Season in April that charged LESS for really amazing food with such gracious service. I approve of adding a percentage onto the bill automatically so wait staff can be properly tipped, but why was there also an additional $3 food delivery charge added on to the obligatory 16% tip? They advertise their link in service as being this great benefit, but what it means is you need to spend $18 a day for online service in your room or you lug your computer down to the lobby with the worn furniture to work. The ballyhooed TV wake up service did not work at all; thank God I set up a back up with my iPad of I would've missed meetings. I stay at different kinds of hotels -- a month before I stayed at a comfort inn near Olympia, WA, and had a MUCH better experience for MUCH less money. if you are looking for a quality experience, do NOT choose this hotel. They should be ashamed of allving this a luxury hotel.

<Title>“Pretty Good Hotel, Service Lacking, Sticker Shock for Parking Fees”
<Content>I booked this hotel on Priceline based on location trying to find a nice hotel close to downtown San Diego. The hotel property is quite nice and even though it is right across the street from the airport, the airport noise is not a factor. There is no free parking at this hotel, only valet or self parking and it is fairly steep per day ($22 for self parking when I stayed) which add up quickly. There are in and out privileges however. The hotel lobby is beautiful and check-in was smooth as they have several front desk clerks assisting visitors. The rooms are fairly nice, not upscale (not sure it is quite a 4 star hotel), but were clean and bright and had no funky smell like a lot of hotel rooms. The beds and pillows were wonderful and my friend and I kept wondering how we could buy some of those pillows! I did not appreciate the lack of follow through with the check-in staff. I originally booked 4 days through Priceline about a month before my trip. A few days later, I decided to add another day (which Priceline lets you do at the same bid price through checkin.) When I checked in at the hotel, they could not find my fifth night. The clerk said she would take care of it. Later that evening, I checked with the front desk and she still had not resolved the problem. The next day, still not resolved. By the 4th day, I had been told by numerous front desk clerks that the matter would be taken care of but it never was resolved by the hotel. I had to call Priceline several times and waste a lot of vacation time to resolve it myself. I can say that after check out, the desk clerk did credit some on my parking bill for the hassle, which was appreciated, but I would have preferred that when their desk staff says they will resolve a problem that they actually resolve it. Another minor irritation was housekeeping. Although housekeeping came every day and replaced the towels and made the beds, they did not actually clean the bathroom which I found odd. My friend who was traveling with me for a few days got her feet really dirty one day and when she took a shower, there were dirty footprints all over the tub. The next morning, they did not clean it. I had to clean it myself with a washcloth and shampoo before I could take a shower. The sink got pretty crusty after a few days and the mirror was also spotted and never cleaned. Also, there was one of 3 bathroom lights burned out when I checked in. I just presumed housekeeping hadn't been in that room for a few days and hadn't notice the light burned out and would change it during my stay. Never changed. I found this to be substandard for what claims to be a 4 star property. Otherwise pretty good stay.

<Title>“Experience varies”
<Content>This was a great stay, the reason why there are so many mixed reviews is when you get here, you think the hotel is only the one in the main picture; HOWEVER, there are really two hotels here, and your experience will vary greatly depending on which tower you are staying. The main one is clean, spacious, and staff is friendly, I can't speak for the other one, but just read some of the reviews and you'll get an idea. The tower I stayed in had great facilities, room was large and the best part was the views from the balcony, SPG status gets you the floor second to the top and free internet which is wired not wifi. Lounge is on the top floor and key card is needed, status gets you free breakfast, otherwise it's like $14, pretty basic, all continental mostly, cereal, fruit, muffins etc. no hot food. Getting down to the gaslamp cost exactly $13 from the hotel, it's not that bad, but there isn't really anything around, the Westin is a better choice if you want to stay downtown, it's probably a 5min walk to the gas lamp from there. Overall, I was very satisfied with the stay, facility was great, clean, quiet, and spacious, staff was friendly and attentive and the shuttle comes and goes very often, just remember, your stay depends on which tower you stay in, I believe mine was the marina tower and the iffy one is called the bayview tower. You should definitely ask where you'll be put before confirming.

<Title>“Next to airport- literally.”
<Content>This hotel should be a 3 star. The rooms, bed/linens/bathroom- everything are average. It felt like we were driving to the airport and bam -we were at our hotel. Yes we could see planes taking off out our window- so if you like planes this is perfect. I had to request a new room because our bedspread was stained and there was mold in the bathtub. Second room was a downgrade but at least it was clean and they gave us a breakfast voucher. Great bargain if you get it on priceline- but don't buy the rack rate. Overpromise, underdeliver. Btw- Coffee was stale in the room.

<Title>“Average but with Security Concerns”
<Content>I stayed at this property on a business trip for a conference. The room was fine and, were I not working most of the time, I might have been able to enjoy the small balcony. The bed was not particularly comfortable and the use of a bottom flat sheet that slipped up from the end uncovering the scratchy mattress pad underneath made for poor sleep quality. The shower was OK - the water was hot but the water pressure was not great. The staff as part of the conference was very good and responsive. My biggest complaint is that I came back to my room one evening to find the door open. I decided to go in when I saw that a light was on but was certainly concerned about the possibility of an intruder. I called the front desk right away and they sent up a security guard. I checked and it did not seem as if anything was taken. The security guard took some data from the door lock and confirmed that the last key used was from housekeeping. I was just fortunate that my room was a bit further down the hall that a passer-by didn't take advantage of the door being left open. This is a huge concern for me and while the conference customer service was good and the room was OK, it is unlikely that I will stay at this property again unless I have to for business reasons.

<Title>“Decent hotel in most ways”
<Content>Okay. This is what you'd expect. A large "resort" hotel not really within walking distance of anything. If you want to go anywhere, expect a cab ride or other means. So it's not too bad, but just not great. The good. It is in a very nice location, near the water (Mission Bay, which is NOT the ocean), and has great views of things like the naval base, the bay, Coronado Bridge, etc. (more on this in a bit). Great walking trails nearby, nice and quiet, decent hotel accomodations, etc. From that standpoint, it's great. And, it is REALLY close to the airport. Decent pools for the kids, and the usual amenities such as gym, Starbucks, etc. The bad. There's little nearby. You are going to travel anywhere, such as Gaslamp, downtown, La Jolla, Qualcomm, Padres, the beach, Corondado, you name it. Also, WHY MAKE ME PAY FOR INTERNET? When are hotels going to learn this is like making us pay for TV in the old days? It's not a sign of being progressive and hip, it's a sign of being out of touch! What's next, making me pay for local calls (cringe)? And, you are stuck most of the time in this hotel, at their mercy with restaurants. If that's okay with you, that's okay. Our room. Without doing anything (I think) to annoy the check-in staff, we got ABSOLUTELY the worst room in this place - room 5135 (don't agree to take this room!!). We didn't complain - were there on business and spent little time there (so management don't reply that we shouldn't have requested - we shouldn't have been put in such a dumpy room to begin with!!), but this was a crappy room. I happened to visit the room of other meeting attendees, including those without Sheraton Club membership, paid same amount, came in later, etc., and they mostly all had significantly better rooms in terms of views. And trust me, it matters at this hotel. Our room (again, 5135 - avoid it!) looked out on a parking lot and a green wall adjacent to tennis courts, while others looked out on the bay, airport landing jets, city skyline (imagine how all this looks at night?). It sucked. And, it smelled of mold - inspection of the air unit outside showed it all mildewed, etc. Not nice at all. The room interior was decent, not much to comment on from there (except the damn paying for internet). It seems to me that lousy rooms should be given out last, not early on during the day - a pet peeve of mine - why doesn't their computer system have some sort of ranking system and give out rooms in terms of some ranking system? Long story short, thanks Sheraton, and I'll certainly remember this room! I do commend them for deducting $5 / night for not having maid service. Great practice, and I hope it shows on the final bill. I like that. The sports bar on premise is pretty good, and food is okay although pricey and service is spotty (what did you expect given this was a self-contained resort hotel). The restaurant is same, except we found service there to be really poor (we complained, and to her credit, waitress took the blame for shoddy service, although she blamed it on a "large party of 40" which was there that night - at a hotel that seems to host large parties all the time, thank god there wasn't a party of 400 or we still might be there - and on a Sunday night with few other patrons. You figure for yourself on that one.). Restaurant food was pretty good, but prices were high for poor service. But what do you expect given a hotel with no competition within walking distance? Summary: Good hotel. Watch where they put you, which room. Enjoy the sports bar in moderation. The hotel restaurant is good but with poor service for us. Would I stay here again? If I want the big cookie-cutter experience.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>San Diego Sheraton Marina Tower is situated on Habour Island. Amazing views of the bay and marina. Great location ! This is also a great location if you like to walk or run. The hotel is close to the airport, but you won't notice. The hotel was very clean and the staff was super friendly. Breakfast was one of the best we ever had. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to San Diego.

<Title>“Nautical & Nice”
<Content>Thie hotel was very well-equipped with restaurants, spa services, and a great gift store. Beautiful walking areas all around the hotel, in the marina and bay area. My room had a nautical theme that was sweet. Bed was comfortable and cozy. Couldn't get WiFi working, but took it as a sign that work should be done for the day, as I had been up for almost 2 days on this trip! The air conditioning was on full blast and it couldn't be adjusted. When I called to inquire about it, they were quick to handle the situation, and brought me complimentary fruit tray as apology for the half hour intrusion. The service man was wonderful, friendly yet professional and very thoughtful. Great location for airport convenience, bad location for downtown convenience.

<Title>“The "Step-Child" Effect”
<Content>This was suppose to be an "Upgrade", WOW! what a dissapointment. The location is wonderful, the view spectacular . . . the room, staff & service, amemities and personnel, a disaster. One company, two hotels, one; newer, cleaner, the "A TEAM" staff, a place to sit and have a relaxing drink, a meal, whatever you liked to do. The other location, (the one we got) the "rejects" of staff, un-informed, non-communication experts. A gift shop that always seems closed, as well as a diningroom that closes "just because, there hasn't been that much business tonight". Really? To add to that; we had a toilet that continued running, non-stop. We called the front desk and asked to have it worked on. The reply was that "we'll send someone up in the morning, it's too late now; (it was 7pm). The next day I went to the front desk to ask about the running toilet situation. They we un-informed of any such situation. I asked that something be done while we were out for the entire day. We gave our cell phone numbers to them, (in case, they needed to move us to another room). During the day we recieved no calls. When we returned that evening, we opened our room the the sound of silence. However, the remedy for repairing the toilet was to simply turn off the water supply; no note, no calls, no nothing. I went downstairs to ask about the toilet, to which (of course) they knew nothing. I asked to be moved to another room, they made a new card for a room next door( never offering to assist with the move or even apoligizing for the trouble). As I stated before; great location, great view, terrible facility, it's definitly the "Step-Child" of this company. We'll never stay there again.

<Title>“Two Towers - one Great One not”
<Content>Be carefull which tower they put you in -- they are about 1/2 mile apart -- one has every facility you could want --the one I stayed in the "Marina" was lacking in almost every regard. Good room and good location but that is it. No decent restaurant. No wi-fi in the rooms, no decent place to sit and get a drink. Gift shop is minimal and generally closed. I would not stay here again.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay”
<Content>I had selected this hotel because of the close to airport location and thought we might have a nice view. We were just returning from a cruise and wanted a day to sight see in San Diego. We were on the marina side so the view didn't turn out as well as I had hoped. The room was nice and we spent quite a bit more time in the hotel than anticipated because my husband was not feeling well. We had to walk quite a way to find something to eat and ended up at what was really a coffee shop. Overall, I thought it was a nice hotel.

<Title>“Sustainble and Great hotel.”
<Content>Arrived in San Diego and it was the srat of agreat conference. The hotel is minutes from the airport. The shuttle bus runs every15 minutes or shorter as it was there when you need it. The arirval at the hotel was perfect. The lobby was beautifully decorated and prepared for our conference. The rooms were nicely appointed: refreshment centre, T.V nautical theme room and very comfortable. Concierge team member very accommodating. The Director of Front Office was very cordial and engaging; thank you Daniel. Though the airportis close to the hotel, you felt as it you were in a resort. The hotel does a great job creating a sense of relaxation and comfort with its surroundings. The guestroom keys are made from cardboard........WOW that is what you call "Taking care of the environment". Thank you everyone for a FANTASTIC experience. I will be back

<Content>One of my favorite San Diego hotels. Friendly staff. Easy to find. Assessable parking. Nice bar and restaurants. Nice Executive Lounge. There are two hotels on the property. About a 5 minute walking distance apart. One tower is the "luxury" tower, has all the amenities and fill up fast. The tower tower is more secluded and has a better view of the San Diego Harbor. Ask which tower you will be put in. Both are a short car drive or bicycle ride to the main Port area.

<Title>“Service and parking sucks”
<Content>They pretty much charge you for everything. You have to go through a gate to park which hardly ever worked and constantly had to get new keys made because of it. The parking is $11 a day which is almost more then any airport you go to just to stay there. Also at 7:15 we wanted to play ping pong and the manager there told us they can't give us any paddles because it's past the time. I clearly told him most of the people staying here don't get back till around this time and he refused to care. This was a great location hotel but not even close to worth it for the price. I rather have stayed at a less nice place for better service.

<Title>“Nice Location, Bad Customer Service”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel & Marina (Bayside) for three days attending a conference at the hotel. My first night in room 1167 I discovered the thermostat did not work and air conditioner would continue to blow cold air. I made it work by turning the unit on and off several times during the night. The next morning on the way to the conference, I mentioned the problem to the Front Desk and they advised they would send Maintenance to fix the problem. I returned to my room at lunch and found the thermostat was displaying in Celsius and the unit was blowing heated air (as in furnace). I called Guest Services who reported that Maintenance reported the problem as fixed. Guest Services scheduled a second visit from Maintenance and I went back to the conference. I returned to the room at dinner and found no evidence of a visit from Maintenance. I contacted Guest Services who advised they had not heard back from Maintenance and would send someone right away. I advised I would be back in the room around 8 PM and if the problem was not fixed the problem would be escalated to the manager. I returned at 8 PM and the problem was not fixed and the room was super hot. I contacted Guest Services who advised Maintenance was on their way. Fernando from Maintenance quickly arrived and within five minutes determined the unit was broken and would only blow heated air until it was repaired. Fernando contacted the Front Desk and advised them to move us to another room and send a bellhop up to assist in the move. I waited 30 minutes (sitting outside on the balcony to stay cool) and no bellhop. I walked down to the Front Desk and spoke with the manager Dana over the phone. Dana guaranteed the bellhop would be up quickly to assist us and she was researching ways to properly compensate me for my unnecessary troubles. We received a call from Sue at Guest Services asking how our new room was (by calling us in our old room?). We advised we are still waiting on a bellhop and keys to the new room. Sue advised she was working on a compensation package for us to make up for the full day off troubles. Thirty minutes later, I went back down to the front desk and received the keys to room 1172 and I moved myself into the new room. I did meet a maid as I was transferring to the new room that was sent to clean my old room (???). We never saw a bellhop, Sue from Guest Services never called back to offer compensation and Dana the manager never called back to offer compensation. During checkout, I had to argue my point as to why the hotel should remove a charge for a movie rental never finished in the old room. A few days prior to this I stayed at another San Diego hotel during a widespread, 12 hour power outage. I experienced better customer service from that hotel, under the worst of condition compared to the Sheraton Hotel & Marina under the best conditions.

<Title>“Haven't Even Stayed Yet And Already Not Sure I I'll Like It”
<Content>I'm starting this review at 2-stars, which may change depending on how our stay goes. Yes, that's right, we haven't even stayed at this hotel yet, but the experience thus far has not been very good. I called the hotel a week ahead of my scheduled stay (9/21/11) to make a request for a "great room with a great view." Simple enough, right? First, let me tell you why I made this seemingly simple request. I'm planning on proposing to my girlfriend while in San Diego, and, of course, I want everything to go well...everything from the hotel to the restaurants to the proposal itself. I want it to be an experience. So I called up Sheraton reservations and was told that I would need to speak to the front desk reception, as I booked through a third party (Priceline). After being connected to the front desk, I explained that I am proposing to my girlfriend and want to get the best room for this experience. The woman I was speaking with seemed to care less. Don't get me wrong, she did the minimum of what she was asked to do, but she showed no real care. She explained that I was currently booked in the Bay Tower and could only stay on a floor no higher than the 4th. Really? She went on to explain that if I wanted a higher floor I would have to pay $20 extra per night. Ok..if that's what it takes, no problem. I mentioned to her that I had read lots of reviews saying the Bay Tower was not preferable and the main hotel was much better. She admitted that the Bay Tower was kind of far away, but it was quieter and the rooms were bigger. Ok...sounds fine, but I told her that I was concerned because of all of the reviews. So I asked what she would prefer if she were receiving a marriage proposal...which tower/room/view would she prefer. All she said was it is up to me what I want to do and she will make the request. This was less than friendly or personable, and it showed a real lack of caring. At any rate, I agreed to pay the $20 extra per night for a Bay Tower room "above the 4th floor." I made a request for room on the 10th floor with a good view...so let's see if I get it. I hope the concierge is more caring and sincere, as I plan to ask him/her to have champagne waiting for us upon our return to the hotel after I propose. I will stop the review here for now. I really hope I can come back to this review and put 5 stars on this upcoming stay. Wish me luck!!!

<Title>“Great hotel lacking in customer service”
<Content>This is a great property and I'd definitely stay here again. Offers 3 pools and decently sized rooms with balconies. Our view of the marina was beautiful. Some reviewers complained about the location, but it's nice not to be in the downtown area(scuzzy, with lots of homeless!! --- I know they have to live somewhere, but when you're traveling with family you do not want to deal with that element.)  My main complaint with this hotel would be the lack of customer service and their VERY STRONG air freshener. Certain people in my party loved it, but it was definitely not allergy friendly. It had me wheezing before I even completed the checkout process and I had a headache for the rest of our stay. Got up to our room, we decided to order room service and relax before heading down to the pool. I called room service four times and called the front desk, but nobody picked up! I started pushing other buttons in an attempt to ask about room service or other dinning options, but again no answer. The only people that did answer were the valet and they had my car waiting for me proptly every time(good job valet! That was the best service we received while there) I called and asked for two extra blankets, several hours later they never came. After making a follow up call(which AGAIN was not picked up) I went downstairs and requested the two blankets in person. Eventually they sent up ONE blanket.  My room was also charged over $50 in minibar charges for items that were never removed from the fridge. Called to have it corrected, was told someone had to come check the fridge before we checked out, but no one ever came, we waited over an hour for a person to come up!! Finally went down and was told by the desk that they already reversed the charges... So why on earth didn't any staff member bother telling me this??? Because of the wait we ended up being late to our next destination.  Great hotel, bad customer service!!

<Title>“A great place to get stranded”
<Content>I was stuck in San Diego during the big power outtage and after rushing over from the airport I was met with a huge line out the door of this hotel and only limited power from a generator. What could have been a long miserable experience was instead a really nice stay at a great hotel! The staff all pitched in and passed out bottled water, kept everyone informed and even made sure there were a few emergency power receptacles for people to charge their phones. It looked like they had practiced for ths type of event because everything went so smoothly. Since the rooms had no power everyone was given a glow stick when the checked in and with an open sliding glass door looking over the bay I got a very plesant night of sleep. The restaurant fed everyone with the limeted cold food they had like salads and sandwiches, but most importantly, the bar was open and they had plenty of cold bottled beer on hand! This would be a great hotel to stay at normally but even being "stuck" there was a pleasure because of the helpful staff.

<Title>“Lights out in San Diego”
<Content>A 12 hour power outage starting at 3:40 pm on 9/8/2011, left most of San Diego and southern California without power. When I arrived at the hotel at 6, thanks to the airport shuttle and reservations booked with Starwood by my wife, the line for check in was out the door. Within 1 minute the management of the hotel was over communicating about the power status, providing water for folks in line, answering questions about what food and beverage services were available, and making everyone in line comfortable. Not only did their response to the power outage demonstrate phenomenal service, it demonstrated leadership, organization and preparedness. The front desk staff were graceful under pressure, the wait staff and bartenders bent over backwards for the guests, and the kitchen knocked it out of the park preparing food for every guest. I can't think of anything they could have done better in an emergency situation. Kudos to the Harbor Island, San Diego Sheraton staff.

<Title>“Handled conference and Black out well”
<Content>Attended a conference of 450 people for FMA. The hotel staff were gracious. On Thursday night when the "big" power outage occurred, they kept one elevator running in each bank of elevators, moved up our social from 6:30 to 4:30, had food and drinks, ice water and ice for over three hours on the lawn for our group. Quickly rechecked in folks who were planning to leave that night but needed to stay an extra night. Provided candles for us to continue to enjoy the evening outside and lit the fire boxes. Overall, the staff handled everything very well including the long lines that formed once everyone at the airport decided they were there for the night and quickly converged on the nearest hotel. They kept the kitchen going, providing what food they could under the circumstances. The true test of a hotel is putting them through a crisis such as the regional black out for almost 12 hours. Good job!

<Title>“Not bad..”
<Content>We have stayed at the Marina Hilton before but this time we were assigned to the "Tower". This was a former Westin that was added on the Sheraton. They are actually a good 10 minute walk from each other. That really is the only bad thing. The rooms and service was good but there is only one restuarant and the service there was not good. I would reccomend the hotel if you are planning to eat out for everything. Also when you get a room at the Sheraton ask if it is at the main hotel or the tower. Big difference..

<Title>“Not of Sheraton Quality, beware there are two towers!”
<Content>The Bay Tower is the pits. First, it suffers from the Holiday Inn look. If you book with your SPG points, you will get placed in the cheaper Bay Tower, unless you complain. Rooms suffer from echos from the parking lot (design flaw - big time!). The Bay Tower also has rooms that overlook the bayside, but the road noise is loud, and every voice or music echos up to the balcony and into your room! Lacks minimal things like toothbrushes, robes, and slippers (not like other Sheratons I stayed at!). No refrig - unless you ask? Coffee maker did not work, minimal tea selection - cheap, cheap. Loud lobby area which looks cheap as well. I don't think they offer any upgrades for Gold/Platinum members since it appears all the rooms are the same. It's not worth the 10 K points, maybe 7k at most. The Marina Tower maybe better - well, at least looks better from the lobby/drive up area! If you are paying "big bucks", I would recommend looking elsewhere, but don't stay in the Bay tower!

<Title>“Superb Location”
<Content>We arrived in San Diego after a 14hr Journey from the UK. We caught the complimentary shuttle bus provided by the Sheraton to the Marina Tower, we checked -in and was offered a choice of rooms. We took a room over looking the Harbour in the Lanai rooms. They had two queen beds, desk/work area, coffee maker with a good selection of coffees and teas.These rooms had plenty of space for a family of four 3ads 1 teenager. The balcony was great to watch the sunset in the evening and to watch the harbour. The room was immaculate, sparkling clean bathroom. This hotel had a Starbucks on site, there was a outdoor restaurant Shorelines this was amazing the portions were huge. There was the Harbour Edge restaurant which was open from breakfast til late,Martini Tapas bar, then there was the sports bar Quinn's where you could order food til late and a gift shop.Fitness centre, Spa room fee applied to that, the pool areas were excellent two pools/hot tubs. tennis courts, bike rentals, boat rentals.They had kids activities and on Friday and Saturday they had a Dive in Movie which was a good idea you could swim whilst you watched the movie or just relax on a lounger with a drink and a snack. We opted for the Help the Environment this was a good idea you got $5 voucher for everyday you stayed, if you didn't want all your bath towels and sheets changing every day they came in and just made your bed and refilled the mini bar and your complimentary coffee and teas. We used the vouchers towards eating in Shoreline. The location wasn't a problem I had heard and read from others it was out of the way. Yes it's a little out of the way but it is a nice walk along the front towards Downtown (Little Italy, Gaslamp Quarter, Seaport Village) we took the walk at a leisurely pace and it took just over 1/2hr. We didn't hire a car for our 5day visit and to be honest it's not necessary unless you want to visit the beaches near La Jolla and Oceanside. I would recommend the 2day old town trolley tour this helps with finding out about the area and where you want to spend your time exploring in more depth. We did get a taxi back to the hotel this cost $12 with tip and we also took the MTS public transport this was brilliant we took the hotel shuttle bus back to the airport and boarded the 992 bus to Broadway and we took the no 7 bus to the zoo it took just over 40mins and it was $5 for all day per person you can't get better than that. I think rather than pay $22 per day parking at the hotel and whatever the cost to hire your car using the local transport is good. Ralphs grocery store was good to get a few provisions for the day out at the zoo. This was near Market St in Gaslamp area. The history of the Gaslamp area was fascinating,especially if your into Wyatt Earp etc and around the 1800's, the Old Town was also full of History and really enjoyable to wander round and taste some of the local foods and crafts. The zoo is a must..... start early though, this will enable you to see the animals before it gets too hot and there sleep time.There is so much to do and see in Balboa Park it's worth spending the day there. Coronado is beautiful. Highly recommend the hotel and the area.

<Title>“Unbelievable service during the San Diego blackout”
<Content>I was ASTOUNDED At the service and amenities the Property and the Service staff provided during the recent San Diego blackout. This was not a planned emergency - all of the sudden the power went out. The team at both locations were friendly, hospitable, went above and beyond to ensure the guests were taken care of (water at the front desk, glow sticks to help see, etc). They put out a buffet that was INCREDIBLE given the circumstances. When you have emergencies like this, you really see what the team is made of and the level of service that the hotel provides - and this one is TOP NOTCH!! Thank you all!

<Title>“Awesome Staff!”
<Content>When the power outage hit San Diego I was in the airport and I did not want to sleep on the airport floor. Quite a few other people had the same idea and we all headed for the Sheraton. When we got there they had a generator powered up and the entry way was well lit to welcome us. Someone was handing out water bottles to the long line of people and assuring us they had room for us. Someone else quickly figured out that the Bay Tower had availability and took a bunch of us over there in the shuttle bus. The front desk staff was hand running credit cards and writing down the room numbers on a piece of paper. Every staff person was friendly and calm. Upon checking in we were handed glow sticks so we could find our way around. They told us they had a dinner buffet set up in the main hotel. Ever staff person there was working efficiently and with a smile on their face. The food was very good and the service was excellent. All this without electricity. It was obvious the hotel staff were prepared and trained for this kind of crisis. If they weren't they sure faked it well. I was so impressed with every staff person I encountered and want to thank them for making what could have been truly miserable, something quite nice.

<Title>“I had the best time ever!”
<Content>I was so pleased with my stay at this hotel. I loved our view, our room, the staff, the pool; I can't say enough good things. I got a great rate from priceline.com and it was worth every penny. I got this room for my boyfriend for his birthday and we had such such a memorable time. We sat out on our balcony, drank champagne and enjoyed the stunning view of the marina. The bed was incredibly comfortable and it was difficult to get out of bed in the morning to make it for the breakfast served up on the top floor at the club lounge. The pool next to the marina was very enjoyable and we even mosied over the hammock for a relaxing siesta. I would definately go back and recommend it to people visiting!

<Title>“No power and NO problem”
<Content>As a professional pilot I get to see a LOT of hotels all across America. Just so happened that my trip ended up in San Diego at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina. That evening there was a complete power failure in the southern California area. The city and 5 million other people were without power and in the dark. As a crew for a major airline we went to check in at the hotel for the night. That is where I met Mr. Scott Hermes. I think he was the manager of the hotel. Anyway, he explained what is happening at the hotel that evening. I was very surprised to learn that just about everything was running perfectly ! The elevator was working, the staff were everywhere with handing out glow sticks, and the Restaurant was open for business! I went to my room and changed out of my work clothes. I then went back downstairs to Join the fun. The bar was open and serving cocktails, and people were in a calm and festive Atmosphere. I was a little hungry and decided to get something to eat. I waited maybe 4 minutes to see the hostess. She had a nice table for me with a nice candle lit near the water. Quickly a waiter showed up and told me of the buffet. I went to graze the food. The staff had excellent hot and cold food to offer. I had some sliced beef and some tuna salad. Both were superb. My hat is off to the entire staff of the hotel. ALL were very gracious and concerned for their guests. It was as if they do this disaster drill all the time. There were some emergency lights on at the hotel and they were more that enough to see your way and enjoy the evening. Except for my room not having any power, the entire experience was a enjoyable night to remember.

<Title>“DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR LUGGAGE”
<Content>Checked in on Sept 1 after waiting about 20 minutes in line. Went up to our room on the 6th floor & put the key in the door, opened right up, walked in & saw a laptop & luggage on the floor. We left the room immediately. We went downstairs & asked for a manager. They told us it'd be about 10 minutes and offered a front desk clerk offered to help. I explained what I concern was. What they did for me was "upgrade" me by giving me a room 1 floor higher & gave me free breakfast. I didnt want/need an upgrade, I wanted this to be noted & addressed by the manager, not to be 1 floor higher & offered the same breakfast 3 days in a row. Had I not already paid for the hotel through Priceline, I would not have stayed there. I made sure we left our valuables in the car. I will not be Priceline'ing a "4 Star" hotel in the SDdowntown area again.

<Title>“Needed a break and received it. Thanks.”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel for the first time with my wife and small children for an intended 5 day stay in San Diego to visit the tourist spots. Unfortunately, my kids became very ill the 2nd day of our stay so we needed to leave and head back to Los Angeles. The hotel was fantastic about our circumstance refunding the remaining days of our reservations with no penalty and allowing for a very late check out. Although I probably would select another hotel next time better suited for families, it was obvious that this is a very good business hotel and I will definately be returning. Also, a big thank you to Julia and Hayley for their great service on that troubling Friday morning.

<Title>“Don't book here. Huge disappointment!!!!”
<Content>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BOOKING...... PROS: Good location if you want to be isolated from just about everything. Few restaurants near by but for most part downtown area I hear is better for lodging. Yes there was only one good thing about this hotel. CONs: Initally everything seem to be quite nice. Shuttle personel was wonderful. Check in was very slow. We walked up with two ppl in line waiting took about 45 mins to get to us. Wanted to get a service performed from spa only to find that they didn't have a full time employee on staff who could complete my request. I was livid... Had to attend the Marine graduation looking not up to par with my norms. The actual room was something you can see at a Motel 6( please no offense meant to that franchise). This goes for the hotel rooms in the Lanina side. The worse looking rooms I ever seen at a Sherton hotel. OMG please dont let me get on the pricing there. It is true they have a price on everything to have a refrigerated in your room of what you think is a 4 star hotel that cost is 15 bucks/ day to have handy. Prepostourus!!! THE HOTEL WILL NICKEL AND DIME YOU AS STATED IN OTHER REVIEWS. THEY PURPOSELY DO NOT HAVE VENDING MACHINES SO YOU ARE SOME WHAT FORCED TO DRINK FROM THE OVERLY OVER PRICED MINI BAR! JUST THINK IN THOSE LATE HOURS WHEN THE THIRST BUG HIT YOU YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE YOU HAVE EITHER A BOAT LOAD OF MONEY STASHED AWAY FOR THE MINI BAR OR STOCK UP ON YOUR FAVORITE NIGHT TIME SNACKS AND DRINKS BEFORE COMING BACK TO HOTEL PREMISES AND REMEMBER THAT FRIGs are 15 bucks/night to have in room!!! CRAZY RIGHT! same thing I said. The front desk associates (one for sure) was totally clueless about shuttle times etc. At this point I am boiling over! The ball was def dropped at this Sheraton! Please do not let the location fool you! At any rate we didnt have to pay for a couple of nights for all the aboved inconveniences!

<Content>stayed in the bay tower. Very close to airport and free shuttle available. Lovely helpful staff. From reception to hse keeping. Rooms lovely decorated and very spacious. A fridge in room would be a great addition. Nice pool and hot tub area. Larger bay tower facilities available to use to all guests. Five minute walk away. There is no bar and grill that is open all day in bay tower. Opens periodically in the evening. Bus stop is a ten min walk and its only ten minutes to downtown. 15$in a cab to downtown. The extras in this hotel are very expensive. Parking $20 per night,movies,mini bar etc. Removing points for no wifi in each room and the lack of a always open bar/grill. Wifi only available in lobby.

<Title>“Nice, conveniently near airport, but hold onto your wallet!”
<Content>The staff was welcoming, and the hotel was nice. The room was a great size with balcony, and overall a decent place to stay (there are 2 hotels and we were at the marina side). During the day it was a little loud, but this is to be expected being near the airport. My biggest gripe about the stay was being nickle & dimed for everything. Make sure to read the fine print! Two things to be aware of: 1) Not only are the items in the stocked fridge overpriced like usual, you will be charged a 20% stocking fee and taxes on top of the listed price. So a can of Coke listed at $4.50 is really $5.50. 2) It's pretty archaic to use anything other than your cell phone these days, but use the phone in your room at your own risk!!! My wife was feeling under the weather so she stayed in the room while I took my daughter to check out a college she is interested in attending this fall. My wife wanted to check on us but couldn't find her cell so she used the room phone instead...her 2 calls that went straight to voicemail cost us $30!!! I can definitely afford to pay the $35.50 here, but it's the way we were charged that doesn't sit well with me. Charging 12 pack prices for a single can of soda and feeling obligated to add a re-stocking fee and tax on top seems ridiculous. And although the card next to the phone says in small print that direct dialed calls will be charged AT&T operator assisted prices, they forgot to mention "bend over and look out!" But if you don't use the room phone and make sure to read all of the fine print, it was a decent place. We didn't get a chance to use the pool, but we looked at the pool area and it looked nice and was clean. Although I wouldn't rule it out entirely, we probably won't be back and will check out another property next time we're in town.

<Title>“overpriced & in a rather inconvenient location”
<Content>There are 2 sections of this hotel & they are not close together. There was an error with my room type on check in, but a representative fixed the error without too much trouble, other than my having to reload all my stuff back into my car & drive to the other section of the hotel. While they claim to be pet friendly, they aren't as you cannot leave your pet in the room while you go to dinner, etc There is no fridge or microwave, but there is an exhorbitantly-priced motion-sensor minibar--$4.25 for a candy bar that normally costs 75 cents, $5.25 for a 16 oz gatorade, etc There is no wireless in the rooms, just wired internet for $15.99/24hrs. There is free wireless & a guest computer in the lobby. The food is way overpriced & not even very good. The chicken fettucini was terrible--just ordering that from room service without any beverages was $21 for food + automatic 19% gratuity + $3 room service fee + tax. If I wasn't so tired, I never would have ordered from that menu! And if you want breakfast, it $17 + all the above fees for 2 eggs, toast & bacon; coffee would be an extra $6-7 Parking was $22/night The view from the Bay Tower is very nice on the Bay side-- downtown San Diego, the Bay Bridge & lots of sailboats. The price I paid for the room was good because I booked thru AAA, but the mess up with the room type was supposedly due to booking thru another site & not directly on the Sheraton's site-- well, gee, other hotels all over the world seem to be able the handle bookings from sites like Travelocity & AAA....why can't the Sheraton ensure that the correct room is booked?

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>My friend and I stayed at the Sheraton Harbor Island using a coupon deal for one night. When we arrived at the main hotel, we were told we needed to go to a different tower down the street. I found that odd since the main part of the hotel is where all the restaurants and large pool is located. However; when we arrived at the Bay Tower we were greated by valet and proceeded to check-in. Our room was on the 9th floor close to the elevator overlooking the marina. I like to have a refrigerator I can use when I travel so I was disappointed the room only had a mini-bar. We were hungry but there was no restaurant in the tower so we walked a few yards to a deli down the marina. Our room had two double beds, nothing special and not very comfortable (in my opinion). The bathroom was small but when we requested extra towels they were delivered immediately. We spent the afternoon in our private cabana at the pool which was fantastic. The only issue I have is in talking with some children in the pool, found out they and their family of at least 12 people, were "pool crashers." Apparently that location is a regular spot for them! Later in the evening, we attended the Dive-in Movie at the pool which was fun. I thought the noise from the airplanes (right across the marina is SD airport) was very loud. Nothing special about the room. It was decorated in a nautical theme. I might stay here again but am concerned about the price especially since overnight parking is $30!

<Title>“Great place for the family!”
<Content>We decided to stay here because of the positive comments we read and it did not disappoint! We were impressed with the spaciousness of the room and my daughters (5 and 3 years old) immediately went out on the balcony to check out the view. I recommend requesting the Marina view in the upper floors. The only downside to this stay is the cost of parking which is $22 per day or $30 for valet. Also, we were here during the weekday and found it difficult to find parking so I can't imagine how it would be on a busy weekend. Overall, it was a fun family trip...pool was nice, clean, and warm. They have a fitness room and small gameroom for table tennis and pool. Oh, forgot to mention that they give you an option to be "green" by opting out of getting room serviced in exchange for $5 voucher which we used for Starbucks...totally worth it since you can call housekeeping anytime for more towels or amenities.

<Title>“Nice grounds and view, somewhat isolated”
<Content>We were excited to stay at the Sheraton--the clip they had on their website where they were featured on the Today show made the place look fantastic. We were a little disappointed, though. Our first room was so far away from the lobby, and we had a baby and all our gear to haul. The room itself seemed a little shabby. The pool areas, view of the marina, and the grounds were very nice, though. Our second room was easier to get to and had a better view. We had to wait in line for quite awhile to check in/out and it seems they could have used more staff. I did like their on-site laundry facility and computers/printer/internet access. Overall, I thought the place was a bit pricey for the amenities.

<Title>“Pretty nice hotel.”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina Aug 24th - Aug 29th. I reserved the room about 2 months prior for approx $89 per night on some type of manager's special. When you enter the main lobby, it is the second floor. We stayed on the second floor. Decent 2 bed/room. Bathroom was clean! We had a balcony, but it looked out over the parking lot. Not so great, but the price was good. A better view might have cost a lot more. The big swimming pool was warm. The hot tub was good size. On Friday night, the hotel set up a movie screen so that both the hot tub and swimming pool could watch a movie. That was neat. I have never watched a movie while swimming before. We ate in the hotel restuarant one night. Very expensive. Checking in and checking out were no problem. Plenty of staff, no big lines to wait in. The hotel is walking distance to the airport. I was concerned about the airplane noise. I discovered that anywhere in San Diego you could here the airplane noise; Sea World, San Diego Zoo, downtown, the beach. I consider myself to be a light sleeper. The airplane noise did not wake me up at night. If I was already awake, I could hear the muffled noise from the airplanes. But the airplanes did not wake me up. I saw a sign at the hotel that said parking was $30 per night. We used the free shuttle from the airport to the hotel for checking in and out. During the stay, we used the MTS (San Diegos bus system). A $5 ticket to ride all day on several different buses including the trolley system. The closest bus stop was at the airport. After the first day, it was pretty easy to figure out the bus system. Oh yah, our room had this refrigerator that had juices, pop, and food items in it. $4.00 for a candy bar! Needless to say we did not buy anything. All in all, a pretty good place to sleep at night and do some swimming.

<Title>“Nice Hotel, Family Oriented”
<Content>This was your typical Sheraton. Seemed to be more geared towards families. I was upgraded to a nice room but I could hear everything from the hallway and from the room next to me...not just muffled noises but their actual conversations. The bed was comfortable and I had a nice view of the pool. There was a Starbucks on-site, as well as, a free shuttle to the airport. That was a nice touch for my morning trip back to the airport. Overall, I'd say this was a typical Sheraton but due to the issues with noise, I will likely not stay here again. There are some fantastic hotels in the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego.

<Title>“Impressed”
<Content>Stayed for 4ngts as part of a California vacation. Initial thoughts were it was too far out but soon realised that this was very much a positive thing and that the hotel is actually central to all the major tourist attractions as you really need a car to do all. We booked the Club Level which I would highly recommend. You get a beautiful room on the top floor with amazing views which ever side of the hotel you are on. You also get access to the Club Lounge giving complimentary contintental breakfast. Free bottles of water, snacks, free Internet access and printing. Our room was very close to the airport but had excellent soundproofing so we were not disturbed by it. Hotel feels and looks clean and contemporary with a nautical theme present. Pool also nice but no shade so didn't use. Staff were helpful and pleasant. Overall excellent value for money and would definitely stay again

<Content>Although we stayed at this hotel for 1 night, it was an amazing experience.The hotel is very close to the airport and the views are awesome. Select a room with a city, marina and a bay view and watch the view from a higher floor. The hotel staff are friendly and this is undoubtedly one of the best hotels we have stayed in recent times.

<Title>“Decent and kid-friendly”
<Content>I was here for two nights this July. This huge hotel is basically for tourists, particularly tourists with children, so don't stay here if you don't like lots of kids running around the place and in the pool. The service was pretty friendly and efficient. Unfortunately, the rooms are kind of old and everything in the room shows its age, but the hotel is pretty reasonably priced so you get what you pay for. The assistant booking my trip neglected to put in my Starwood Platinum status and I checked-in quite late and the hotel was very full, so I was unable to get a suite upgrade. But the receptionist was very nice and scrambled to get me an upgraded room on very short notice, so I appreciated the effort. I also got access to the club/lounge, which is quite large and gives a lot of selections for breakfast. I also think they had crab cake appetizers during dinner time, which gets extra credit in my book as I can't eat enough of them. If I ever travel with kids, I would probably come back here.

<Title>“Decent SD Hotel near airport and marina. Beware of extras!”
<Content>Sheraton Marina is a decent property--know that is a large hotel, with two towers and a Lanai building-think lots of guests, weddings, events and two packed pools. Location is great--very close to downtown and the Gaslamp, also very convenient to Point Loma and even Sea World in Mission Beach/Bay. We were upgraded by the friendly SPG front desk to the Lanai property. Our ground room had a nautical motif--room was adequate, seemed clean and we had a small (dirtier) patio. There was no wireless internet in our Lanai room. Beds were comfortable; room was slightly loud--our unrelated connecting room had some loud moments. Room service meal was good, came quickly and overall staff was attentive. One thing to warn potential visitors: we did incur numerous extra charges. Internet was ~$20 per day per device. Thus, with two computers and logging in both days (via hardline ethernet), charges were over $80 incremental to our room rate. Throw in $22/day self-parking fee, a decent but overpriced restaurant, and good, fast room service (and a late-night minibar $16 beer), our extras doubled our room rate. Obviously, not specifically the hotel's fault: they were clear about these fees up-front. But, if price is a factor and you have certain expectations of how you stay at hotels, then consider these extras. Overall, a decent hotel in a great location.

<Title>“Picturesque resort in a convenient location”
<Content>We were in San Diego for the Americas Finest City Half Marathon and 5k Run and had a room on the ninth floor of the Marina Tower. The room was clean, nice and decorated in a nautical theme. Harbor Island, Point Loma, the marina and the airport could be seen from the balcony. The hotel is very convenient, located adjacent to downtown and the airport. The hotel staff is friendly and courteous. The hotel grounds are nicely maintained and landscaped and the pool areas are very inviting. The only thing I did not like was the $20 charge for parking. The hotel has facilities for conventions. It was the host hotel for the marathon expo and also had other events at the time so it was very busy. After paying the $20 parking fee, were had much difficulty finding a parking spot, day and night. Other than the parking hassles, this is definitely a recommended hotel.

<Title>“DONT STAY HERE IF YOU LIKE CLEAN ROOMS AND GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!”
<Content>I honestly wish I had the option of giving no stars for this hotel because I’m shocked and appalled at the physical condition of it and at horrid customer service. We booked this hotel way in advance because we were in San Diego for a conference. The only reason why we booked at this hotel was because the conference was being held in it. When we went to check in, they told us that we were staying at their sister hotel which was ¼ of a mile away and require shuttle transportation. I figured we had just gone to the wrong place, and that the conference was being held at the sister hotel that they were sending us to, but I soon found out I was wrong. We spent one night at the sister hotel, and we were horrified at the physical condition of the room. The next day we were moved to the bigger hotel where the conference was being held, and had the displeasure of experiencing their “customer service”. We called asking for hangers because we were staying there for 6 nights. They gave us an attitude and then took over an hour to get the hangers to us. The food was overpriced, which is to be expected at a hotel, but if you’re going to charge me double, at least make sure the food is worth it. It was not. My chicken was cold, hard, and dry, and my friend was given a cheeseburger with no bun (and no she’s not on the Atkin’s diet). The Restaurant Serves were rude and one even rolled his eyes when we asked him for napkins. Guests would leave their trays in the hallway after they were done with their food and drinks, and they would be left out there for days; room service did not walk the halls. The two glasses that we took a picture of were there for 4 days!!!! In fact, my husband repeatedly put them in the middle of the hallway so that someone would pick them up, and instead they were moved back up against the wall instead of being taken in to be cleaned. When we dialed 0 for the operator, the phone would ring and ring, but no one bothered to answer it. The charge for parking was ridiculous ($22), as was the internet ($17). As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with a commercial boasting that Sheraton spent $6 billion to renovate their hotels across the country, and I guess we’re paying for it. I think if they could charge us for the air we breathed, they would have. I’m really wondering where this money went to. Our experience was unacceptable. We were so shocked that we took a photo log. This is not a cheap motel, but a resort. I was disappointed and disgusted. We paid a lot of money to go to this conference, and spent a few extra days there as a mini vacation. This is definitely not what I had in mind. You can take a look at the pictures, but here are some of the highlights: 1) The wallpaper was stained and falling apart. In one spot, there was blood on the wall. 2) The showerhead was coming off the wall, falling apart, and water was dripping. 3) The bathroom was not clean. 4) The lampshade was stained and had a hair from a previous guest still on it. 5) The electrical outlets were loose, old, broken, and corroded. 6) The AC would turn off all by itself, minutes after we turned it on. There was no way for us to tweak it and let the room cool down to what we were comfortable with. 7) The patio outside was disgusting and had not been cleaned. 8) The telephone did not work. 9) There were cups of coffee, but no coffee maker in the room - cofemaker was very dirty. 10) The baseboards were completely banged up. 11) The sprinklers on the ceiling were rusted, as were the AC vents. 12) The pool area was not cleaned at night, so we could see trash and the towels all over the pool area. 13) There was dust everywhere, especially built up in the vents. 14) The layout of the room was difficult. We’re not dumb people and we work in real estate. We couldn’t figure out where to turn on the lights. The towels were under the sink and completely unreachable. In my past hotel experiences, the towels are always either in the shower or right next to the shower so that they are readily available.

<Title>“Beautiful location...”
<Content>I was initially surprised that we were so far away from the heart of San Diego. Turns out our location was great. Everything we needed was on the property, and just a mile away was an entire shopping center with Trader Joe's and plenty of little restaurants. The kids loved their choices of pools too. The hotel restaurant was outrageously delicious. My complaint would be that the rooms did not feel so clean. I noticed there were dogs in other rooms and our carpet felt a bit dirty. I did not allow my kids to sit on the floor. Also the restroom had some issues, which the hotel plumber was fixing for quite some time. The hotel was nice enough to compensate us slightly, but it was still a little gross and inconvenient. Overall, I think it's at a wonderful location and I would go back in a heartbeat. The views were spectacular.

<Title>“Not a great experience.”
<Content>The first room I got was on the ground floor. When I went on the balcony to work, I found it littered with garbage. I requested another room. This one faced the marina and was nicer. Other issues: - On several occasions, I was unable to reach anyone at the front desk. - For early risers, you should know that the restaurant only opens at 6:30. - The morning staff at the restaurant weren't very friendly. And they didn't appear to be too happy to be there.

<Title>“Won't be back!!”
<Content>We were at a conference and booked 2 months in advance, when we arrived at 9pm we aere told our room was already sold and we had to go to their other tower in a handicapped, dirty room with only one bed even though we booked a 2 bed room for 2 adults and a child. Our number one problem is with the front desk staff. The women that helped us both at check-in and out was rude, condescending and dismissive. Too much trouble for a mediocre hotel. Don't let them send you to their other tower it is dirty and quite a walk to the main pool and restaurants.

<Title>“not for the price”
<Content>My girlfriend and I spent 4 days here and were underwhelmed.No perks to speak of.A very basic room with minimal towels,soaps,shampoos,etc. If you left a half used bottle of shampoo or soap they would not replace it until it was gone.We actually hide the toiletries in our suitcases so they would replace them for the next day. Everything was extra.The newspaper was added to the bill even if you didn't want it.There was only 1 free hour of internet use and then internet use was charged to your bill.But the biggest ripoff was the parking.they charged 30 dollars a day for parking.and there was nowhere else to park(no on street parking available) . The bathroom fixtures were all rusted at the connections and half the rooms light fixtures were not working.All in all,not worth the price.

<Content>Room and furniture in room was very small, no safe, not enough towels supplied for a family of 4, had some sent up then would forget again next day, so therefore had to ask 3 times. The location was ok albeit a little near to the airport next door, but the beautiful marina made up for that. Wouldn't recommend.

<Title>“Almost a "5", and Dog Friendly, too!”
<Content>We drove to San Diego for a few days, and we brought our well behaved spaniel. Simply a perfect place for a getaway. We had a wonderful view of the harbor, and an extremely comfortable room with a king-sized bed. We paid the extra $40/day Club Fee; well worth it for the view from the 12th floor, the quiet, and especially the club access--free breakfast buffet (not cooked), free hors d'oeuvres in the evenings, free water bottles and free internet access. The area is right across from the airport but surprisingly quiet, and there are beautiful walking paths all around the harbor for a happy dog to enjoy with her family. Our only negatives are the $22.00/day parking fee (apparently average for the area) and the fact that they Locked Up the Walkways in the evening, (a security issue?) so after the pleasant evening walk, you have to walk twice as far just to get back in. All-in-all, a really nice place.

<Title>“Not terrible, but wouldn't go back.”
<Content>Sheraton wasn't terrible, and probably a great deal if you have kids, but we won't be back. Housekeeping service was uneven-one night we returned to find no soap refills. Another night we returned to find no coffee refills. These were too minor to complain about, but definitely a deterrent to returning. Room was in the bay tower, with a view of the hotel lobby. We would have complained if we weren't out sight-seeing most of the day. Front light in the room's foyer didn't ever work. The bed was incredibly uncomfortable (even for two people with different body types and bed preferences), and the room's AC never operated correctly. We woke up every night to turn it down further, after kicking off the blankets, but it never cooled down enough. Shower was incredibly small, even for a tub/shower combo. We have a standard size at our apartment, and this was perceptibly smaller. Housekeeping apparently washed around our items on the sink, rather than removing from the sink area, washing, then replacing. Front desk didn't pick up for several minutes when we called at 10 pm for a wake up call. One of us is a Hilton Diamond member and was unpleasantly surprised by the front desk never asking how the stay was going or how the room was at checkout--which is standard for Hiltons.

<Title>“Isolated and Overpriced”
<Content>We just stayed 5 nights at the Sheraton San Diego on the Harbor and it was not worth it. Everything was overpriced (bottle of water in the gift shop was $4, omlet at their restaurant was $17, parking was $30/night). Since we didn't have a rental car, we felt isolated. There is nothing around there but the harbor. The only decent restaurant on the island itself is Island Prime / C Level (which is about a mile walk from the hotel). We were unable to take a taxi since we had a 6 month old. I rented a car for each day that we wanted to travel somewhere, then returned it the same night to avoid paying the $30 parking fee (zoo and sea world). The room was decent, but the goose down in the pillows and bedspread were shedding everywhere, creating dust in the room. We had a nice view from our balcony of the harbor. If you don't have a car, I suggest the gaslamp district. If you're more into Sea World, then stay around mission bay.

<Content>This hotel was great. We got two connecting double rooms and both rooms were very spacious for our family of five. The rooms were clean and well equiped and the view across the Marina was fantastic. We ate breakfast at a small cafe on the water front just under the hotel which was very good value. The hotel is VERY close to the airport but we did not hear any noise from there at all.

<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton for one night 8/17/11. Our building was the Bay Tower. Check in was quick and easy. Staff was very friendly. Our room was beautiful, clean, large and over looked the San Diego Bay. Our room had two comfortable queen beds,4 feather pillows, large flat screen TV, desk, extra comfy side chair,and coffer maker with Starbucks coffee. We had a patio with table and chairs. We checked out the pool, small but clean and lots of lounge chairs. Across the street nice sidewalk beside the bay for a long walk was great. This hotel is close to downtown for great shopping and restaurants but not to close for to much traffic. I will recommend this hotel to our friends and stay here again.

<Content>Booked here for two nights. Arranged a club room but wasnt entirely sure we got one as it wasnt on the club floor and we had to ask twice for confirmation of the club lounge detail/arrangements. Big luxurious and very busy with holiday makers and conference guests in full turnout. Although hard to find real fault, we didnt really enjoy this hotel. Found the restuarants and bars very expensive and the staff not particularly helpful. Location mixed. You cant walk into town from here and next time we'd pick a hotel which is closer. That said, we did go sailing on a yacht in the harbour and the Sheraton was ideal for that. VERY close to the airport but to be fair we didnt hear noise. Very plush but lacks the personal touch

<Title>“Overall good, would stay again”
<Content>Just returned August 16th, all in all this hotel is good not quite up to the Sheraton standard though, the rooms are clean the bathroom could use a fan, and it would have been nice to have a fridge in the room, the beds were comfortable . We had a room in the Marina tower which is the bigger of the two towers we had a room facing the city/Airport which at first I thought might be an issue (noise from Airport) but actually it was not an issue you do hear airport noise whilst sitting on the balcony but when you close the door you don’t hear anything, the walls had good sound insulation which is good because I’m a light sleeper and I did not experience any problems. Food is fairly expensive here we booked a package through Allegiant Air and received breakfast free everyday which was great you had the choose of buffet or menu breakfast it was good, we ate in the bar once food was ok! There are no restaurants close to the hotel so if you don’t eat at the hotel you would have to go downtown which is a 10 minute drive away, if you don’t have a car like us you can take the hotel shuttle to the airport then take the bus to downtown a little inconvenient but it worked. The pool is very nice lots of chairs to lounge around on they do have a pool bar which is convenient the staff do walk around to take orders, I found the food here a little greasy for my liking. The hotel does have lots of conferences here but it did not affect us to much they have a big conference centre so they are really well take care of over their own side of the hotel. The hotel front desk staff we found to be very unfriendly it seemed like they were going out of their way to help us, on the over hand housekeeping went out of their way to help you and were very friendly even though English was clearly their second language. Parking your car here is expensive $25 a night and more for valet parking however most hotels charge the same rates. It would have been nice if they had a shuttle that took you to the downtown area where you can pick up a bus or the trolley system which is very easy to get around on.

<Title>“A Pleasant Surprise”
<Content>We booked this hotel on priceline.com (4 star, Downtown). I was a little disappointed initially to see the distance to downtown and the gas lamp district. However, upon arrival was pleasantly surprised to see how easy it was to get to the beach, La Jolla & downtown. Since the hotel is right by the airport, you can follow signage and get to it easily and quickly. PRO's: We stayed in Bay Tower with awesome view of the harbor. So relaxing to sit on balcony and watch boats arrive in the evening. Comfortable bed Modern Decor My husband doesnt like coffee and loved the coffee here. Hot tub has beautiful view of harbor (pool is average at best) CON's: As discussed in other reviews airplane noise is a big factor if you choose this hotel. It did quiet down between 10 pm and 5 am. Be careful in the parking lot, it is not well lit at night and the cement blocks go between instead of in front of cars - dangerous! For those wanting to go car free, too far to major attractions. Slow elevator

I reported this right away, but nothing was done about it and they still tried to charge us on our final bill. Appears this hotel is understaffed although rooms are beautifully appointed. Very near the airport and if plane noise bothers you, I would stay at another Sheraton as there are several in San Diego.

<Title>“Some pros and some cons”
<Content>I stayed here for a conference. The hotel seems to be able to handle a large number of guests; there were 1,000 present at the conference and also some little league baseball teams. The lobby, business center, and fitness center never seemed crowded, but the Starbucks had long lines and the pub restaurant was busy, understaffed, and hot. I stayed in the Marina Tower. Check-in service was prompt, courteous, and friendly. I can say the same for the parking valet and concierage. My room was very clean and comfortable.The bed was great, and room service was reliable. Unfortunately I was unable to get a room with much of a view, but the 5th floor was quiet and I was never bothered by noise from the airport or other quests. Also, the conference facilities were great with prompt attention from the tech team. So on the plus side--very nice room, clean and quiet, and overall wonderful service. Now, the cons--as noted by other reviewers--the hotel is isolated. If you want to see San Diego, you will need to rent a car, and if you rent a car, you will have to pay the outrageous (in my view) parking fees--$22 per day for self park, $28 for valet. I would prefer to stay some place where I could walk to restaurants and shopping. Secondly, in-room internet is costly, although wi-fi is free in the lobby. Finally, the food and drinks in the on site restaurants were mediocre and way over priced, and the restaurants and bar always seemed to be understaffed. I spent two nights checking out restaurants in the Gaslight District. I would recommend taking a cab rather than driving, as parking was scarce and very $$$. Also, the evening scene there is not very family friendly. Try Fred's for Mexican or one of the reasonably priced Italian restaurants.

<Title>“Bay Tower = 3 Stars”
<Content>Stayed here three days for a conference. The hotel is acutally two Sheraton hotels - the Marina Tower and the Bay Tower, which are about a 5 minute walk apart from each other. I was in the Bay Tower...which is a 3 star hotel that's trying really hard to be a 4 star. And it looks like it's trying. The hotel overall is decent - the rooms were lacking in my opinion. Nothing was by any means impressive. I think the Marina tower must be a lot nicer - at least the lobby and amenities make it appear that way. I can't say that I was ever in a Marina tower room, I can only assume that they're nicer than those in the Bay Tower. The rooms were loud, I could hear doors slamming and toilets flushing at all hours. I'm a light sleeper so this was especially irritating. The rooms had that moist, Mexico feel to them...always just a little bit damp. That has a lot to do with being right on the marina, but when I first checked in, the AC was completely off. That doesn't help either. Overall, the room was very clean, housekeeping came everyday. Staff was friendly, which always goes a long way in my opinion. Only two elevators, which are slow. I ended up just taking the stairs most of the time. Meeting space is nice, lots of rooms/ballrooms between the two towers. Parking is not free and neither is internet access. If you drive, keep your room key handy in the car. You'll need it to enter AND exit the parking lots. (I chunked it into my purse on multiple occasions and had to dig for it while cars lined up behind me. Sorry cars.) I think parking was $11/day and internet was $12/day. It added up though. Also, when you get there, the first hotel you'll see is the Marina tower. You won't see the Bay Tower. So, valet the car or just leave it running at the valet station - do NOT park - go in and check in. There's a chance you're in the other tower and lugging stuff back and forth is annoying. For the nightly rate, I think it could be nicer. The views are good - either of the marina or the bay. It's definitely in a GREAT location relative to the airport; only a couple of miles away. I'd say good location overall actually, it's within about 5 miles of everything: Fashion Valley, the Gaslamp District, Little Italy, etc. Also, great running trails just outside the hotel...run along the marina, watch the boats, it's pretty key for runners. Room Service food was surprisingly good, however. Recommend the crab cakes. Watch out for the service charges, they caught me off guard. And if this is your first visit to San Diego, take a sweater and pajama pants. I was cold pretty much every night.

<Title>“Don't Bother”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton because an annual conference I attend had booked this place. It was not out of choice. The rooms did NOT have wifi. I verified this w people in both towers there for my conference. The hotel is also out of the way unless you have a car and then the parking card readers are shotty. When you call the valet for help you get an attitude as if the issue is your fault. Icing on the cake for me was finding my room door left open by housekeeping the final day there. When I spoke to the GM about that and my broken faucet he told me my bill would be adjusted. Not so much. Love San Diego but next time I will be at the Hyatt or Marriott.

<Content>Check-in took 45 mins., then my room wasn't ready at check-in time, was offered a room in another bldg. "right next door" or a two-hr. wait for my room. The bldg. "next door" is actually about 1/2 mile away and has very limited services, internet service is really poor and only available in certain parts of the hotel, no pool, no coffee shop (when I asked about a Starbucks in the bldg. they referred me to the in-room coffee). There is a shuttle between the main hotel and the satellite hotel......but it takes you to the main hotel via the airport!! Very poor service all-round and obvious it starts with the management. By the way, this hotel is right next to the airport so you will need earplugs if you still decide to give it a try.

The gym is SMALL compared to the size of the hotel so very crowded. The bar/restaurant is average. Service is decent but food was average. Internet is $18 and self prking is $22. I would not stay here again unless my children were with me.

<Title>“just fine ... until checkout”
<Content>Nice hotel, clean and comfortable. Restaurant staff courteous and fun. When we checked in we asked for confirmation that parking was included in our room rate (booked through Virgin) and we were told it was. This was very, very clear. When we checked out we were asked whether we wanted a receipt. When we asked what for, we were told the $88 parking charge. When we told what happened at check in we were told "she [the lady at check in] is new". An excuse? Eventually the charge was removed but it stained our stay. The attitude was unhelpful and obstructive. Avoid this hotel unless you enjoy a fight. Would have given it 4 or 5 stars but for car park charge con. Beware.

<Title>“great place to stay”
<Content>Excellent hotel. Location is superb and it is easy to get any where from here. Views are great. Conference facilities were more than adequate. Service was exceptional. I must also say that the employees working in valet were always very efficient and were very helpful in letting us know an easier way to get to some of the sites we wanted to see.

<Title>“You've got to be kidding”
<Content>We booked this hotel via Priceline.com for $85.00 per night. When we arrived, the parking attendent checked his list and we were told to go down the street to the Sheraton "Bay View" to check in. Right away, I was dissappointed as I wanted to stay at the Sheraton "Resort" with nice pools and a marina to walk around. Since I belonged to their points club, the desk agent gave us an upgrade to a higher story room where the views (which were absolutely beautiful) would be better. It's a good thing that the patio had chairs as the room itself was a dive. Barely a 2 star place. Upholstered sofa and two chair/hassocks were stained and filthy, the aircondition duct was hanging down from the ceiling, walls so thin I could hear the people in the room above us going to the bathroom. Self-Parking was $28.00 per day; Valet was $32.00 WiFi was $17.00 per day. THe next day when checking out, I wanted to speak to the Manager - unfortunately, another desk agent told me that all the management people were housed at the "Resort" The best thing was Deana at the front desk - a real people person with excellent skills.

<Title>“Nice property-just be prepared for terrible customer service”
<Content>Overall large rooms in the Bay tower where we stayed-( called in advanced and requested this tower as per other reviews here) Got a great deal through price line, HOWEVER- they treat you like you shouldnt even be there. Treated the " Gold" customers as such, but the " price line" was not only brought up to me, but the front staff were quite snobbish. While the restaurant and cleaning staff were fantastic, the desk staff should be run through a course again...it was quite brutal. Sure glad i dont ask alot of front desk staff....will never stay at Sheraton property again. The location, while it may seem far away for visiting, was actually very easy to get to local attractions-Zoo/Seaworld, etc....expensive parking but it is becoming normal at higher end hotels. Overall I'd recommend if you get a name your own price...but I wouldnt pay full price for this hotel. I got it for $100/night BTW

<Title>“Very impressed with the level of service”
<Content>I recently stayed in this hotel with my wife for 6 days attending a real estate conference and stayed over several additional days to enjoy the facility. On the day before my departure, I lost my digital camera. I left word with the front desk to watch out for this camera since it had many of my business and well as personal photos on it. One day after my departure and having returned home, I was thrilled to hear from them that a similar camera had been turned in. I had several conversations with Nicolas confirming that it was in fact my camera. He was kind enough to make arrangements to send the camera back to me. He was very courteous and helpful in taking the time to help me. We really enjoyed our stay and were very impressed by a number of the employees. We look forward to returning some day.

<Content>Got this room expecting greatness, unfortunately it did not meet my expectations. Elevator had rotting wood in it, paint falling off. Bathroom light wouldn't turn off, didn't have a fan, and had mold growing on the ceiling! Room was nice, but didn't have a fridge, had unreasonably priced items in a stocked fridge. Room service was unreasonably priced! Had to pay for parking @ the hotel - 22$ a day-to-day no validation. Bed was uncomfortable! Bed had plastic or something on the mattress that made us sweat! Only thing that was nice was location and view, otherwise poor place to choose!

<Title>“Nice hotel with nothing around it”
<Content>This hotel is by the airport. The restaurants are barely adequate and you cannot walk to anything. Parking is expensive so having a car is not a great option (it is actually cheaper to park at the airport itself and use the shuttle to go between your car and the hotel). The rooms themselves are nice and the whole hotel is clean. If you miss the maid service in the morning, it is unlikely to happen later in the day. Staff was friendly and helpful. They did know the ins and outs of airport travel through Sand Diego. The convention space staff did not seem to be able to adapt quickly. Rooms were kept at a near freezing level.

<Title>“Beautiful Property”
<Content>The Sheraton Marina, San Diego, is a beautiful hotel.. The grounds and the pools are excellent and the room was spacious. The only negatives were (1) location: the marina is very isolated and you need a car or you need to take taxis (2) the dining options were not very good. Overall, however, an excellent property.

<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton for the 4th of July weekend and found it to be the perfect location. The hotel is very large and has 2 large buildings that surround the marina. We had a bay front balcony that provided us a beautiful view of the San Diego Bay and an unbelievable view of the holiday fireworks. 4 simultaneous displays from one side of the bay to the other. It was amazing! The staff, the room and the amenities were very nice and accommodating.

<Content>Just stayed at this place this week. It was OK. The lobby was nice as is the bar. The breakfast restaurant is very expensive for the mediocre food. I thought I was in the main tower, but alas my room was in another tower which was a 500 yard walk from the main hotel. The view was nice, but the airport is just to the North so it was a bit noisy. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. I'd look elsewhere on my next trip. San Diego has better hotels than this.

<Content>We spent just one night in the Bay Tower, 7th floor overlooking the marina and it was perfect. My 15 month old son loved looking at all of the boats, airplanes, and sea gulls. We were pleasantly surprised around 9:45p.m. to hear fireworks (I'm assuming from Sea World?) and so we rushed to the balcony and had a great view of that. Parking ($22 self-park) in the Bay Tower lot was easy and convenient.

<Title>“A Tale of Two Towers”
<Content>Stayed 4 nights here the last week of July. This is a very nice hotel with two towers that are very different from each other. Depending on your tastes and needs it is important you are given a room in the appropriate tower. The main tower is called the Marina Tower. This is where you will find the main lobby, bars and restaurants. This is also where you will find Starbucks (open 5:30 for us early risers). The main pool is here as well. This is also where you will find the majority of the noise and commotion associated with a large resort like hotel. The smaller Bay tower is located a 5 minute walk away. It too has a bar and restaurant and pool, but everything in the Bay Tower is on a smaller scale. I found it to be perfect for my needs. The rooms are large and well appointed. I found my room to be clean. I asked for a higher floor and was placed on 11. My room looked down on the Marina (lots of sail boats) and also had a view of the adjacent airport. I spent a lot of time on the balcony watching the marina and airport activity. The opposite side faces the bay and some might prefer that view. If you are worried about sleeping noise the airport is quiet at night and I slept very well. I made the walk between the two towers several times a day and found that I enjoyed it very much. Had the weather been bad I might not have felt that way. I did rent a car while here and found the hotel close enough to all the attractions. You can self park your car if you want to. The Bay tower is much closer to the car park. There are 2 restaurants off the hotel property which are walkable. The first is The Lighthouse and it is very good (I highly recommend it and you will need a reservation). The second, The Boat House, is closer but I found the food and service to be terrible. This is a very nice hotel which can offer two different experiences at the same time. Just choose the tower which fits your needs and you will be happy.

<Content>This was our first time to San Diego and this hotel was huge. It had two towers. It has all the amenities of a nice resort. We were there on July 4th and got to experience the fireworks right outside the hotel! What an experience. We will definitely stay here again when back in San Diego. You cannot beat the views of San Diego and the staff is eager to help meet your needs. The club lounge is extraordinary with breathtaking views of the city and bay. This hotel is reasonably priced considering other hotels in the area that have less amenities.

<Title>“Very nice hotel”
<Content>We just stayed at this hotel this past weekend it was 3 adults and 4 kids (ages 4, 10 & 13) and we got an amazing rate by calling the hotel directly, and using our AAA discount. We got a rate of $119/night per room, non-refundable. They had a huge lagoon-pool overlooking the beautiful Marina. Both sides of the hotel overlooked the Marina so all rooms probably have a nice view, and the hotel and rooms were all newly renovated/updated in a nautical theme. The lunch in the sports bar off the lobby was good and the staff was helpful and friendly. Although you do have to basically drive through the airport to get to the hotel as its right in the airport area and seemed to be mainly a hotel fcatering to business travelers. If you want to go anywhere you do need to drive, but its very close to evreything - about 10 min to the Gaslamp Quarter, Old Town, etc.

<Title>“Fantastic!!! See you again next year!”
<Content>This hotel is right across from the San Diego Airport...and because it was our first time in San Diego, it was very convenient. When I booked this hotel, it was because of its proximity to the airport and the shuttle to and from it. I did not want to worry about how long it would take for me to get to the airport and be late for my flight. Reading some reviews from a different website gave me second thoughts, but I did not have to worry, because this hotel was just GREAT! The service at the front desk was great, very friendly and courteous, the valet people were very nice, too. The room was just perfect with a PERFECT VIEW of the city and the bay and the marina. We are SPG members so we got the higher floors, and the view alone was well worth the stay here. the pool, like the other reviews, was also very nice, with a spa. It wasn't busy at all, the showers were conveniently located in the gym, and they provided the towels at the poolside. Our stay here was staggard because we had to travel to another city for the weekend, so when I booked, I booked two different kinds of rooms, the last one was a studio type, which I liked very much, too. Very spacious. Although, the drain of the shower in the studio type was slow...that was the only set back, and we only stayed in it for one night, so I really didn't mind it that much. Parking was indeed steep, at $22/night, but hey, it wasn't that bad finding a spot anyway. You just had to go tot he opposite lot, everyone tends to turn right upon entering the hotel driveway, but really, there's another lot on the left side and we always found a spot to park there. And it wasn't even a long walk. So overall, I say I loved staying at this hotel and I will certainly come back! Thanks Sheraton!

<Content>This is my second stay here and love the location. First time I was here our family loved everything about the hotel. Room was clean and well maintained, view was exceptional, and staff very pleasant. This time, the complete opposite. Room is dusty and dirty. Air conditioning unit sounds horrible with water sloshing around inside of it. Called front desk twice and was assured they would send a technician. Departed room in morning for day out in SD sunshine. Returned to room to find the a/c unit had not been touched. Received no indication, note, message, or anything that would indicate the issue was even being addresed. Poor service and unacceptable for a room they charged $250 a night for. Will avoid Sheraton from now on. Too bad because this can be a great hotel, given the right circumstance.

<Title>“Great access to airport - but feel like you are far away”
<Content>Given its proximity to the airport - you can call it an airport hotel - but it is nothing like an airport hotel. On the marina - spread out - large pool, etc. I found it very convenient for a conference I was in San Diego to attend (ADA). Loved the proximity to the marina for my morning run. It is not near the Gas Lamp/Downtown area - so you will need to cab or shuttle to get to other places. I was in the tower closer to the lobby - which I would reccommend as it looke like the other section of the hotel was a hike.

<Title>“Two towers, it just depends what's important to you!”
<Content>Lovely floral entrance/driveway and smart lobby with VERY busy Reception desk. There always seemed to be a queue of people! Internet centre (free in the lobby) then there's a Starbucks and then the main restaurant. Outside is the lagoon style pool then the lanai accommodation and they have their own pool. Well equipped fitness centre. This is all part of the Marina Tower. So if you are looking for all of those things, stay here! If you are looking for something a bit quieter, large rooms, a restaurant, standard pool but still with views, either looking towards the marina/ airport runway or city view/Coronado, then this is for you. The wireless internet is only in the lobby but is free. The restaurant serves all the major fodder for a night's hunger pangs and a small bar. Open for breakfast but I wasn't going to pay $9 for a bowl of oatmeal. Instead, on the Marina path inbetween the two hotels buildings was Papnani's convenience store and cafe, mostly geared towards the boat owners but it did me just fine! My major complaint was about the shuttle service. It's a nightmare! either there's not enough drivers or vehicles, I don't know what but it look a long time for a vehicle to turn up at the airport. There were quite a few waiting as well as Airline Crew and then getting a shuttle back again took a while because they had to locate it then send it to the building you were in!! It didn't drive round all the time like it should! The frustrating thing is, it's across the road from the airport and it is walkable but with luggage, maybe not!! If you don't have your own transport it's a bit restricting. If you opt for the Old Town Trolley Tour, once a day, it will pick up outside the Marina building, ask the Concierge! All in all, a good hotel in a lovely location. My room in the Bay Tower was big and bright with a sunny balcony! I would recommend it!

<Title>“We found our annual vacation spot!”
<Content>We have been going to San Diego every year for 18 years. We never had a place to go that we could look forward to the next time we go, until this year. We stayed on the 11th fllor of the Bay tower. My family had the marina side. We absolutely loved both views, but I am partial to the big ships so we were on the bay side. The view was spectacular from both sides. The employees from management on down to the bus drivers that drove you from one hotel to the other (free) were all so friendly! The restaurants in the hotel were very good. Wonderful breakfast buffets as well! The rooms were decorated as such that we had never seen. Fresh and lively, but relaxing and comfortable. We loved the red, white and blue! Poolside movies for the kids on weekend nights are fun! I don't usually add so many exclamation points, but they deserve them! I do suggest you bring over the door hooks for the bathroom, as there are not enough to hang towels. You can get those at the dollar store. We will be back next year with our grandkids to join our family for another week of fun and relaxation. Maybe we will see you there! I give this hotel 4 and 3/4 stars. They lost 1/4 points for lack of bathroom hooks. If you don't go there because of that, then nothing will make you happy! Try it and I know you will enjoy your stay as much as we did!

Water views on both sides, so no matter where your room is the view is nice. Near downtown and the Zoo. However it is pretty far south of the nicer areas like La Jolla and Del Mar.

<Title>“Beautiful location”
<Content>Stayed here for a conference so this review won't speak much in terms of value since the company paid and I'm not sure how much the room was. But in terms of location, it was great! Great jogging/biking paths from the hotel to Seaport Village (3 miles) and downtown (worth the walk if you don't mind walking). I rented a bike from the hotel (great deal!) and biked all around Sunset Cliffs and Pt. Loma (~5 miles to the Pacific coastline for amazing views!). My room itself wasn't the best. It was ground level and hence, had to have my curtains drawn all day, leading to a dark and dreary room. The pool was nice, with hammocks, and a recreation center. Not many breakfast/snack options though. Starbucks had the monopoly there, but there's also a sandwich/cafe shop midway between the Bay and Marina towers. Excellent location for taking in the beautiful coastline, both night and day! Convenient location for me due to the conference, but also convenient for exploring all my favorite spots downtown, all managed w/o a car!

<Title>“Beautiful hotel, quality staff and excellent services”
<Content>We booked this holiday for its Bay-side location for a stay over the 4th July weekend and stayed in an executive club family room. From the minute we checked in until the minute we left, we were completely impressed with the facilities on offer from this beautiful, family friendly hotel. We encountered no problems, price wise we paid approx £110 per night for the room, that included continental breakfast in the executive lounge (penthouse) and evening snacks and refreshments. We found the rooms to be clean, fresh and very welcoming. a reasonable ammount of room on the balcony with fine views over the marina. The staff were very efficent, friendly and the services was excellent. We dined at the hotel lobby bar and also had room service and found the food qulaity to be very good and reasonably priced. I would have no problems recomending this property to most travelers. An excellent property.

<Title>“I stayed here for Comic Con 2011, I won't be coming back to it.”
<Content>I booked this hotel for 2011 Comic Con for $200 a night. If I had to give it a review it would be more like 2.5 instead of 3. It wasn't the best I've stayed but at the same time it wasn't the worst. A few of my thoughts: 1) The major perk of staying there is that it is close to the San Diego International Airport. The hotel does offer a free shuttle from the airport however when I called the customer service representative stated that it runs every 20 minutes. It took them longer than that. The hotel that I stayed while in San Diego previously they told me that their shuttle would be there in 10 minutes and that they were leaving so I didn't have to wait that long. 2) When I arrived at 3pm there was a line of 4 people. There was two people assisting other people and about 20 minutes later somebody came to assist. Thankfully, I am a patient person. I was told from a phone call from me that I could add $20 a night for breakfast, internet access and hor d'oeuvres so I paid additional money to get that. 3) I really loved my room. The bathroom was perfect for 1 to 2 people but it would be crowded for 3 or more people. The bed was comfortable. The view of the marina was nice and I did get an upgrade with a balcony. The big screen was nice and there was a lot of room for my clothes (a closet and drawer set). There was a desk and chair. The coffee pot for two cups is a nice touch. I wished there was a refrigerator and microwave. 4) The thing that irritated me is the fact that the hotel DOES NOT have wifi. I was told at checking out that it is something they are working on getting but it's something that they have been working on for 2 years. There is a dial up connection. On Thursday night when I tried to get the dial up set up the cord was frayed so I requested to get a new one. It took three phone calls to get them to bring me up a new one. That is unacceptable customer service. I also called because the hair dryer wasn't working. That also took three phone calls. I didn't get any of this fixed until Friday Night. 5) The breakfast they serve was very basic. Everyday I was there they offered: A) Turkey, Ham, Swiss & Cheddar Cheese. B) Hard boiled eggs C) Muffins, Croissants, White & Whole Wheat Bread, Bagels (There is a toaster) D) Decaf & Regular coffee, Tea, Orange Juice, Grapefruit juice and two others that look suspicious to me. There is sugar and artificial sweeteners. E) The waiters were very personable & helpful. F) The $20 extra I paid for included breakfast and hor d'oeuvres. The snacks was only for between 5 - 8pm. The snacks was basically the same as breakfast except they had small size burritos and cheese quiche. I only went there twice and it was good but it would of been nice to see them spice things up a bit. 6) It was convenient to have the shuttle to get to leave for the airport on Sunday. However, to take a cab to downtown San Diego will cost you about $30 round trip. For Comic Con there was a shuttle to get to the convention center which was free but to get back to the hotel you really need take a cab especially if you are staying out late. It was very easy to catch a cab at the hotel because there is a stand for them and the valet escorts was very quick to get me a cab. 7) The heated pool and hot tub is clean and very comfortable to go swimming in. Overall, it was good but not excellent. I am planning on going to Comic Con next year but next time I will stay in a hotel that is closer to the convention center which means I will have to pay more money but it would be worth it due to the near $200 I spent on getting a cab back to the hotel.

<Title>“You Kidding? Not worth the value AT ALL!!!”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel for one night, and we definitely will not come back again if we are paying for the hotel. My first impression of the hotel was poor service combined with inefficient hotel staff. The receptionist Juan was checking us into the hotel, and he told us our room was "not ready" and all the other "ready" rooms were full. This is totally unacceptable, given the fact that we were checking in 12 midnight, which gives them 12 hours of room cleaning time and the hotel is only 12 floors tall. Afterwards Juan's manager gave us this room on the first floor, which was really the basement because the lobby is on the second floor. Our room had traces of insects, because the first thing i found was a dead bug on my pillow. Although the room looked clean, you never know what is on the carpet. On the next day we took a walk around the marina, and the only good thing about this hotel is the view (which we didn't get, thanks to Juan and his manager) and the presence of a Starbucks next to the lobby. We are truly disappointed with Sheraton with this stay. I thought an elite international hotel chain like Sheraton could have done better with their customers. We paid over $200 for our room and we didn't expect poor service and a basement room with dead insects. I have stayed in other Sheraton hotels and the rooms and service are on a higher level. Stay away from this Sheraton.

<Title>“Best Hospitality and Service I have ever experienced Anywhere! I will never stay anywhere else in San Diego!!”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina for my middle daughter's wedding in San Diego. I stayed with my wife and yo ungest daughter while my oldest daughter and her husband joined two days later. Because this happens to be a very busy time of year for the hotel and it was a very special occasion for me, I wrote an email to the General Manager of the Hotel asking if they could assist me in some special requests. Please bear in mind that I do not hold special status at Sheraton so it wouldn't warrant special service ordinarily. Much to my amazement and pleasure, I receiived an immediate response from Scott Hermes, the General Manager (who was also off that day) and also his Executive Assistant Helga Crum that they would work to try to accommodate my requests. They provided me with significantly more than I could have asked or even expected! A large room with a view together with a location within the complex that I had asked for and to top it off, they sent a note with a gift of wine, cheeses and fruits to welcome me to their hotel! They contacted me virtually every day via phone to see if I had everything I needed and offered even more assistance. This all came from the senior management of the hotel! And, just so you know it wasn't just the management that provides this service, the room service meals and personnel were equally pleasant, the food was great, and the smiles abounded. In addition, the maid service was timely and exceptional. When we needed extra towels and hangers, we received those with the same smile and immediacy of time. The front desk was more than courteous and helpful regardless of which one helped you and the valet parking made an effort to know who I was and which car was mine. Many times they welcomed me back by name. An exceptional hotel with very exceptional personnel. This is obviously a top down personification. If the management is first class, the people will be as well. This made a first class room that much better than any of their competition. As a senior executive, I travel extensively worldwide and have well in excess of 2,000 room nights over the past 10-12 years (yes, you read that correctly) and even with status at other properties, I have NEVER experienced the service, hospitality and genuine customer care that I experienced at this hotel! I can tell you that not only will I ONLY seek out this hotel every visit I have to San Diego, but because of this team, I have become a Sheraton Evangelist all over! I can't thank Helga enough, nor Scott enough! They are by far the best I have ever seen! And because of the service of other members of their team it reflects their value and class of care from the management on down. It may be a four star hotel, but in my book it was at least 5 stars! Thanks again Helga and Scott!!! You're the best!!!!

<Title>“Nice Hotel but what out for hidden fees”
<Content>Our family stayed at the Sheraton for one week. Overall it was a nice hotel. We enjoyed the large pool and great view of the marina. The hotel is a ten minute walk to the airport and about a 50 minute walk to downtown. We did not eat at the hotels restaurant, but did frequent the Starbucks located near the lobby. Another nice feature were the two gas fire pits which are lit nightly and surrounded with rocking chairs. Hammocks were also attached to some palm trees for the guest to use. The hotel will give the occupant a five dollar voucher for use in the hotel if you opt out of daily maid service. We took advantage of this, as they will still bring clean towels and other items on request. We were fist shocked to find out that parking our rental car at the hotel was going to be an additional $22 a day. This ended up costing us an additional $152 which was not disclosed to us when we purchase our package. Additionally, access to the internet from our room would be another $11+ a day. This was also a surprise as most hotels now provide internet access for free. One last thing, the hotel is somewhat isolated from stores, restaurants etc. so be prepared to pay higher than normal prices at the small store located near the lobby. I.e. a ice cream bar was $4.50+.

<Title>“What a disappointment.”
<Content>I booked a "deluxe" room for 4 nights for a special trip with my 10 year old daughter with a very helpful and nice phone representative of the hotel. I was told I would be on a high floor with a marina view room. When I received the e-mail confirmation I responded to confirm marina view and received a response in the affirmative. The day I arrival I called to verify marina view. Again I was told yes. When I arrived it was a parking lot view with a view of the city in the background. I complained and was told they didn't have another room. The clerk was rude and not helpful, I was treated as below her and not worth her time. At one point when I turned to get my wallet my daughter says she rolled her eyes. The clerk and the manager kept arguing that I was given a great view. Only if you like to hear and watch the traffic. The room itself was fine, nice bed but far from "deluxe." There is no sound proofing between the rooms. I could hear every word of the person next door on the phone. On Saturday night at midnight we were awaken by a drunken party next door. My daughter wanted me to explain what "playing quarters" was. The excessive load cursing, screaming and load music was unacceptable. At one point they ordered 2 bottles of vodka from room service. They were delivered and more beer was ordered. The hotel was helping create the problem not solving it The room was full of people like a frat party. It took 6 calls to guest services before anything was done - over an hour later. Each call the person on the phone was annoyed that I was calling. The location was great but not worth the price or the things my daughter learned from the strangers next door.

<Title>“Annual 4th of July Visit was Awesome!”
<Content>My wife and I got married at the Sheraton on 9/19/98 and have been going back ever since. Now we have two beautiful girls and have started a tradition of staying at the Sheraton (4-5 nights) for the 4th of July to enjoy what the property has to offer and the Big Bay Boom fire works show. This trip we had issues with our rooms we had reserved a year in advance with confirmations check-ins 6 months, 3 months and 1 month out the day we did check-in on July 1st. After trying to resolve the issue at the front desk with no resolution, my wife asked to talk to a manager. Daniel Ader was very receptive to our issue with our room. With a busy 3 day holiday weekend Daniel went above and beyond customer service to upgrade us from what we had reserved. By jumping through hoops to help us out we had one of the best times with our family and friends while staying this past 4th of July weekend. We also would like to thank a few others for their customer service, Lea, Jamie from the shoreline (pool bar & grill), Jake from the spa and Francisco our waiter for dinner at the Harbor’s Edge. We didn’t get the names of the two employees who manage the kid activities/games but they also did a great job as well. Our girls look forward to the games at the pool and love meeting the other kids that participate as well. We are looking forward to next years visit to the Sheraton.

<Title>“Very disappointed”
<Content>So disappointed...this was our final hotel in our family road trip down the California coast starting in San Francisco, passing through Carmel, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles and ending in San Diego at the Sheraton Marina. We had fantastic experiences in the other hotels - the Westin in San Francisco, Carmel Valley Ranch in Carmel and W Hotel in Westwood Village, LA were stand outs for service, hotel locations, facilities and all had their own unique wow factors. The Sheraton Marina had none of the above. We stayed in the second, smaller and definitely second rate Bay Tower. The rooms were fine apart from the noise of the ice machine across the corridor all through the night. It was unclear just how close the airport was from the web site (literally behind the hotel), so noise levels were unexpected. The lobby staff were miserable, we were never greeted with a smile and when I called guest services with a query about coins needed for the laundry, the guy said he didn't know and left it at that! Great training and service (not)! The public areas need serious upgrading and the bar and restaurant area was uninviting and dead most of the time. The pool was appalling - small with a bar area that was closed when we were there and seriously out of date. We felt like poor relations to the guests in the main tower where lobby, bar and pool areas were far superior. Not sure if the staff also felt miserable to be working in the second rate tower, but their indifference to service and general apathy was very disappointing after the high standards we had experienced through the rest of our trip. There were however 2 excellent restaurants a short walk from the hotel with incredible views of the San Diego sky line and marina (particularly at night) which I would highly recommend - The Lighthouse and Island Prime.

<Title>“great wiews of the harbour. we saw the 4th of july fireworks from our balcony”
<Content>older hotel but rooms were clean and had great view. you would get a great view from most rooms unless you were in the bottom floor. we had the harbour view and our teemage children had the marina view. both were good but we preferred the harbour view room. there are 2 separate towers which are 5 min walk apart. we stayed in the smaller tower. the pool and gym is smaller but we could use the one in the other tower if we wanted to. The parking can be a problem so i would go with valet parking if possible. good base to explore sandiego. it is about 10min drive to the gas lamp area/the main tourist strip.

<Title>“Fantastic location and views”
<Content>Our family (incl 3 kids 16, 14 & 9) enjoyed a great stay at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina in San Diego. The views across to the city and out over the marina are fabulous and the hotel provides excellent seating areas to allow you to enjoy the views. The pool is a bit small for the size of the hotel and wasn't particularly clean but that was the only negative point that we found. The rooms are of standard size and are quite basic but are in keeping with the prices. The staff were very friendly, particularly the breakfast and bar staff. I recommend trying to upgrade to a Club Level Room as the views from the Club Lounge while enjoying an early evening drink and complimentary snack are well worth the extra. We wish we had allocated more time to stay in San Diego and we will definitely be back one day.

Overcharged, gave us a cheaper/smaller room than we paid for due to overbooking, parking lot took a half hour to exit from due to broken equipment, they lost our registration info, tried to say we didn't have club access, forgot our free breakfast, tried to charge us $300 for a 28 minute phone call, tried to charge us $160 for minibar use (I didn't touch it)... And had snotty attitude to boot. Just go elsewhere.

<Title>“San Diego Sheraton Marina”
<Content>The hotel was nice and clean. During checkin I found out the room had one king bed. I requested a room with 2 separate beds as there were 4 of us (2 adults and 2 kids). They said that is an upgrade and the cost is $20/day extra. They also charged $22/day for parking which I felt was high. During checkout there were several charges amounting to almost $30 which I could not recognize. It turns out that they have sensors on the snack cabinet and by merely opening the cabinet, they charge you even if you did not use any of the snacks. They took out those charges without any fuss.

<Title>“Kudos to Nicolas and Brian”
<Content>I left my Tiffany bracelet and ring in my room recently and did not discover that fact until I was going through security at the airport. I have not had good luck in the past with lost jewelry from a different chain of hotels (B.W.), so my first thoughts were that I would never see my jewelry again. Once through securtiy I called the Sheraton, still not thinking I would ever see my jewelry again. What a pleasant surprise to learn from Nicolas (Lost and Found) that Brian (Security) retrieved my jewelry! Nicolas was very helpful in making arrangements to have my jewelry sent to me. I am so thankful to Brian and Nicolas for their honesty and professionalism in returning my jewelry to me.

<Title>“Nice Hotel”
<Content>We took a family vacation and booked 4 rooms for 4 nights. Was a little disappointed we were not in the marina tower, since obviously we were going to be there awhile. The marina tower has the outdoor firepits, large pool and outdoor bar. The pool in the bay tower is very shallow. Also, we were booked on the second floor, which was really ground level, when asked if we could all be moved to a higher floor was told it would be another $20 per night, per room. Not worth it. Staff was friendly and when I lost my phone in Quinns the first night was relieved when it was returned to me the next day!

<Title>“Excellent hotel, great location”
<Content>Can't say enough good thngs about the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. I stayed with my husband and 2 year old son in the Bay Tower for 4 night July 6-10. Had a wonderful room facing the harbour. We loved being able to watch all the boats move about the harbour and had a great view of the Carl Vinson and Midway aircraft carriers. Rooms where spacious for a hotel room and had plenty of room for a crib. Also, absolutely no airport noise during the overnight hours. The grounds and buildings are clean and well kept. Everything, in my opinion appeared to be fairly modern and up to date. The pool at the Marina Tower are amazing and loved the poolside service. Being from Chicago the rate for valet ($28 a day) seemed more than reasonable and the valet staff was quick, friendly and eager to help or offer directions or recommendations. If and when we return to San Diego we'd definately stay here again. Thank you Sheraton for a great experience during our short California vacation.

<Content>Very ambivalent about this property - not nearly good enough to earn serious accolades, but not bad enough to be trashed. Go there, expect not much and you won't be disappointed. Proximity to airport is an asset; the view from rooms higher up is very pleasing in pretty much any direction. I would probably stay there again if the price was aggressive.

<Title>“Once was enough! Poor customer service and overpriced!”
<Content>We were disappointed in our recent stay at the Sheraton San Deigo Hotel and Marina. We looked a pre-paid package that included a 3rd night free and 2 free breakfasts in the Bay Tower at least 6 weeks prior to our stay. When we arrived at the Bay view tower (which did have a nice view) we were told that the hotel was oversold and they could accomodate us in the Marina Tower. We had already unloaded the car and stood in the lobby ready to check in and it was the Bay tower we wanted. The Marina Tower is really quite separate from the Bay tower; like at one time they were different hotels?? Eventually the room we booked was magically available. Our 2 complimentary breakfasts however were not. Considering the adult breakfast buffet was $19 per person and the kids $11 each, we wanted to make sure that was covered. Again eventually the complimentary breakfasts were provided. The Room - The room was ok, not great and certainly did not feel newly refurished. There was a yellow stain the wall and the bathroom was old other than the newer facets. The beds were comfortable. We never had enough towels/washcloths for all 4 of us and they never replaced the shampoo or soap without a call down to the desk. The view was nice. The Staff - was not very friendly and the customer service was poor. Other - Parking is $22 a day. The lounge/dining room was WAY OVER PRICED. In-room internet was $11 a day. We go to San Diego every summer and we will not be returning to the Sheraton.

<Content>Just a typical hotel. Tons of weddings going on so lots of drunk people stumbling around the lobby. Also, we stayed in the Bay Tower facing the airport...bad idea. Planes start taking off at 6am so if you like to sleep in I suggest staying on the other side of the the Tower. Also, the breakfast buffet at a Holiday Inn Express was better than this one. And for $19 per person I expected alittle more. My husband asked if they had any everything bagels. The hostess said "No we don't but everybody asks for them" WOW...just wow. It's very clean and very average. I guess it's good for families and weddings. Also $28 for overnight valet parking ($22 for self park) and $18.95 for one day of internet access. Just crazy!

<Title>“WARNING - OVERCHARGED”
<Content>The hotel itself is OK, particularly if you are in the main tower, but management and staff are untrained or liars. Upon checking in I asked if there were any view rooms in the main tower or suites available (as a Platium guest I get a free upgrade). I was told that only rooms in the other tower were available. So off to the car and the other tower where we went to a room with virtually no view and strong cigarette smell. I made a quick call to a manager and was told there were view rooms in the main tower or I could choose a suite for my free upgrade? Back to the car and the main tower...getting exhausted now. Finally they overcharged me $184 versus my confirmed rate of $109??? Worst of all was the treatment I recieved from the Manager (Dena) when I called to get this corrected. First she treated me like I was lying (forward me your confirmation!), then she tried to explain that it was just the taxes etc... When I interupted her to explain it was not the taxes she became enraged that I called her lady and not by her name, sorry I forgot. There was a huge toyota meeting and they were treating those people like royalty and everyone else seemed to get second rate treatment, I heard that from other guests as well at the bar, not professional (I believe that is why they were holding extra rooms in the main tower?).

<Title>“Nice Hotel”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego for a long weekend back in May. The hotelitself is nice, I think it just went through a renovation. We stayed in the Marina Tower and had a great view of the pool and the marina. The room was spacious and clean. The grounds were nice and the area surrounding the hotel was also nice, with a great view of downtown San Diego. The hotel is very close to the airport(virtually across the street), but hearing the airport noise in our room was not an issue and both my fiance and I are light sleepers.The parking situation was the only thing we were unhappy with. First off, the daily parking fee is astronomical. Second the parking lot itself is very difficult to navigate because a portion of it is blocked off so if you go down a row and cant find a spot, you have to reverse to get out of that row. Third, we kept having trouble with the key reader and had to make several attempts each time we exited the parking lot to get the gate to open so we could leave, which was extremely frustrating. Overall this is an average hotel, not high end or filled with luxury, but clean and in a good location!

Right on the water at the marina with a nice pool and outside setup. $22 a day for parking is a bit stiff if you have a car, but it is understandable being so close to the airport (they don't want airport parkers). Starbuck's on site makes coffee choices numerous and easy. One restaurant is on the spendy side, the other is a bar scenario and a welcome respite at the end of the day. Free wireless in the lobby and a big bank of computers for free use just beyond the lobby.

<Title>“Nice view of downtown skylight”
<Content>Use price line bidding and got this hotel. Not much of a saving using price line. There are two towers for this hotel, one is the Marina Tower which is across from the airport. This is the main tower with all the amenities, large reception area, free computers, larger pool, spa, etc. We pulled to the front of the Marina Tower and the bellman checked the guest list and told us we were at the other tower, the Bay Tower. It was efficient and we didn’t have to get out of the car. The Bay Tower is ¼ mile around the corner from the Marina Tower. It’s doesn’t have the glamour lobby. There was only one computer in the lobby. It has a small outdoor pool next to the parking lot. It feels like lower class in the Bay Tower. Parking was $22/day. The room key card worked fine for the parking access. The front desk staffs at the Bay Tower are efficient, but indifferent. They’re not rude but not friendly either. They’re just doing their job to check you in, check you out and answer your questions. The hallway was dim, not brightly lit. The room is renovated and spacious. Each room has a wall to wall balcony, great view of either the harbor/downtown or the marina with boats. We did hear the airplane noise and it woke us up early in the morning. No need for wake-up call. Firm bed and king size pillows for king size bed. Sheets are winkle free. There is mini bar and you’ll get charged if you removed an item, even if you replace it. There is no fridge in the room. The bathroom was small but it has everything we need. The hotel is in Harbor Island, away from the busy downtown, yet it’s very close to it. It has a great view of downtown skylight at night. . It’s also next to the airport so we can hear the airplane noise from our room. It’s also close to Balboa Park, the Zoo, Sea World and other attractions. There is only one restaurant near the hotel. There are no other restaurants and stores near the hotel. It’s kind of isolated. This is a great alternative to staying at downtown or hotel circle or mission bay. Short drive to attractions on local road, no need to use the freeway and stuck in traffic.

<Title>“Great Stay....Great Location!”
<Content>We were only in San Diego for a few days to visit family. The location was fabulous. We were put in the Bay Tower and had a lovely view of the marina. The staff was wonderful! Especially Bibi from security. I told her I had lost my Blackberry adapter and she found one that I was able to borrow for my stay AND she delivered it to my room. Now that is service! I would definately recommend this hotel and when we return will absolutely stay here again.

<Title>“Nice Hotel-Close to Airport”
<Content>Stayed here the last night of our trip to fly out early the next morning. Check in was easy, and the agent was very helpful. I asked for a map to Enterprise so my husband could go drop off the rental car, and she called Enterprise and arranged for them to pick up the car for no charge. The room was comfortable and clean. The bathroom is small, but we were only at this property for one night. Airport shuttle was easy and complimentary. Great value if you book online and prepay.

<Title>“VIP Treatment - what a hotel stay should be”
<Content>I try to get out on occasion and "visit" San Diego so I don't forget to enjoy the beauty of my city. I had a Staycation at this hotel over the Memorial Day weekend. There are so many great hotels in San Diego and I've had some great stays in other cities as well. I travel a few times each year for business and pleasure - and I can honestly say that this was the best overall experience that I've had. The staff was wonderful. My great experience started at check-in and didn't stop until check-out. The room was quiet, comfortable, and the modern design was so beautiful. The view of the marina was breathtaking and got better with the sunset. I enjoyed lounging by the pool and taking a stroll on the grounds. The dinner from Harbor's Edge was so good and the view of the fireworks at Seaworld after dinner from my balcony as fun. The next morning I capped off my stay with a breakfast (outstanding) and a few spa treatments. Every person that I came in contact with responded as though I was the most important person in the hotel I have plans to return for a personal stay, as well as to bring an event there so everyone can share the experience.

<Title>“Very enjoyable stay”
<Content>Our airline's flight and hotel package offered several hotel choices. We liked the look of the Sheraton and marina, but were aware that it was some distance from the downtown area, so we had to factor in extra cost for cabs and plan our days' events. The hotel is basically across from the airport. We heard planes now and then, but it was not disruptive at all. Check-in was very efficient, and extremely friendly (thank-you Dinah!). Arriving in the morning, we expected to check our bags, and get our room later in the day, but we got our room right away. We were offered our choice of the two buildings, and picked the main one, knowing the rooms were smaller but it had more restaurants etc. We were asked for our view preference, and chose the marina view (gorgeous). The room was a decent size, very nicely furnished and clean. The beds were extremely comfortable, and had beautiful linens. We opted for the 'green' choice and didn't have daily housekeeping but towels were replaced upon request. This gave us a daily $5 voucher towards food/beverages, which we used for our morning coffee at Starbucks (located in the lobby). Our package also included breakfast, which is pricey in my opinion. If we had paid off the menu for our breakfast, including a fruit bowl (delicious), juice, coffee and main item, the price per person would have been at least $30. Without having a car, we had breakfast every day at the hotel (food and service were both excellent). Be prepared to drive or take cabs to get around, as there is very little in the immediate area within walking distance. We weighed the option of renting a car vs paying cab fare to get around. Daily parking at the hotel is $22. Added to the cost of car rental, and not being familiar with the area, we decided to travel by cab. Allow (pre-tip, round trip) approx. $30 to/from Old Town, $56 to/from Coronado (hotel Del Coronado), $25 to/from downtown/Gaslamp Quarter. With only 4 days, and much on our agenda, we didn't have a chance to spend time at the pool or use any of the other amenities. Quinn's sports bar was a nice place to end our day (kids are allowed, even though it's called a bar). There is a free computer area for web-surfing, email etc., and for printing boarding passes (note - in-room internet is $11.95/day). Since our room was included with our airline package, it's difficult to rank the value, but while we were there, the 'walk-in' rate was $199/night. We did not use the mini-bar or room service. All of the staff that we met - front desk, concierge, restaurant, bar, valets, cleaning - were extremely friendly and helpful. All in all, we were very pleased with this hotel and I would definitely recommend it.

<Title>“rooms are nice, facilities are poor”
<Content>Checked into a corner bay view in Bay Tower. Room was decor is nice and view is great. However AC can't cool room below 70 ( it's 65 outside), cable TV has no channels. The hotels response was were redoing the cables in the building. Really? No wireless internet and the wired internet ( even with the "premium" upgrade is slow) and if your not a platinum member it cost $18.95 a day. If your looking for somewhere close to the airport to spend a night it's ok assuming they get the TV issue fixed, maybe 1 channel that works. Otherwise you should stay in town, at $28 to park you could stay downtown and be where the action is.

<Content>Pros: clean, nicely decorated (nautical theme), free shuttle to/fro airport, nice staff Cons: location - would have preferred being closer to Gaslamp so that we could walk there; restaurants in the hotel left a little to be desired I stayed here for a work conference. I think, if I wasn't bound to the location, I would choose somewhere with a better location and food offerings.

<Content>The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful to our questions. We stayed at the Sheraton Marina which had a variety of restaurants with great staffs, as well. The Marina was very cleanly and comfortable with a wonderful lobby with computers and couches for guests. Although the rooms are just basic, they are cute. The lost and found desk is also very helpful and efficient. They are quick to respond to inquiries and assist you.

<Title>“Wow!”
<Content>This property is very good. We enjoyed two nights in a double room in the Marina Tower, overlooking the pool and the marina. There is an in-house Starbucks (I'm an addict-so this was quite convenient) We enjoyed the food and drinks from the sports bar, the outdoor firepits, the walks along the harbor, and the peace and quiet. Even though it's right across from the airport, the plane noise was negligible. We were able to purchase tickets for the Old Town Trolley tour, picked up right at the hotel (at a decent hour, I must add). Truly recommend the experience this hotel offers.

<Content>Great ambiance and views for an "Airport hotel". Only 2 min away from the airport but feels like its own world. Not the best location for getting to the beaches ($25 cab to mission beach) or downtown ($10-$15 cab), but still one of the nicer airport area hotels i've ever stayed in.

<Title>“Wonderful View, great location”
<Content>This hotel is right on the harbor and the view is great. We walked along the water and looked at all the boats/yachts. We were there for 5 days. The restaurant is great, food is good, service was good. The ice cream store became a daily stop for us; also ordered a picnic lunch for one day which was great. The only downside was that we agreed to go green when we checked in which we understood to mean that sheets would not be changed every day. That was fine - we don't change them at home every day. But as it turned out, they didn't do any housekeeping at all. We had to call everyday to have them pick up garbage and bring clean towels. You would think they would vacuum, dust, clean the bathroom, change the towels, empty the wastebaskets. So if you don't care about any of that then go green - we won't do it again! Other than that, it's a really nice place to stay. So because of that, I gave them a poor grade on cleanliness - it was very clean when we checked in, though.

<Title>“less than stellar experience this time around”
<Content>The hotel itself has really cool nautical decorations and I love the fish tank in the lobby. Our room was located right over the pool and it was really really loud due to some music that was being played at a high volume the whole weekend. We asked to be moved to another room, but they wouldn't move us, even after repeated requests. The food in the hotel restaurants was quite expensive, which we expected, but the quality did not match the price. It was greasy and made us feel kind of ill. The best part of the whole experience was when we rented bicycles and rode around San Diego. There is a deli the concierge recommended that was in walking distance...DO NOT GO THERE...rude staff and disgusting food!

The southerly view over the Marina is just stunning. The rooms' interiors are modern and it is very clean including the beautiful bathroom. Even we booked on very short notice the rates for the room was very reasonable and the service was just great. Don't forget to try the mind-blowing pancakes they offer downstairs... they're the best I ever had!!! Enjoy!

<Title>“In need of help!”
<Content>I would like to have one of your managers noted for having done a great job in helping a customer in trouble. I came in from out of state with nothing but debit cards and did not notify my bank. I therefore was unable to get any cash out of any atm machine. When I asked for help, everyone told me sorry there wasn't anything they could do to help me. When I asked to speak to a manager, along came Jonathan Flores, who patiently listen and said that he could help me out of my dilema. I was so relieved. I was able to catch a Padres game and my stay here with you went from a nightmare to a pleasant, stress free vacation. So please extend my sincere appreciation to Jonathan Flores for being such a professional and caring part of your fabulous organization. Sincerely, Mr. Rolando C Salas

<Content>I am so impressed that "Sue from Chicago" was my angel for offering help last weekend, San Diego Rock and Roll Marathon event. I was unpacking my gear and realized I had two left shoes. Not what I want to realize at 5pm the day before the marathon. I called the hotel line and got "Sue from Chicago" to ask about internet connections so I could locate a Target or something. Sue asked my shoe size and offered her shoes if they were in her car, and could I wait 10 minutes for her break. She met me in the lobby and had actually taken them out of her car. I was so impressed that an employee would offer something of thiers for my event. I want to give a shout out to Sue, and I LOVED the bedding. Two down pillows and two something else pillows. I love down. San Diego. Late check out request. So, this was a great experience for me with the customer service. A bed is a bed, but Sue, you made my evening with your offer and follow up. And the hotel was great.

<Title>“Away from the city and happy to be!”
<Content>Stayed at the Sheraton from June 4-6 via Hotwire, and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. We used the self park and checked in at the hotel, but learned out room was further down the road in the 2nd (older/original) hotel called the Bay Tower. I'm glad it was. No room has a bad view unless you're on the ground floor. One side of the hotel looks out over the marina, the other side looks out over the bay and Coronado Island. The amenities are few, as I think the pool was on the roof (never saw signage though), not sure if it had a gym, but the balcony with table and chairs made up for everything. The hotel is ways from Downtown, about 3..5 miles, but very close to the airport terminals. We were in town for the Marathon and resorted to taxis to get around easily. They were even able to take my wife to Sea World (about 5.5 miles away) to meet me at the Finish line. The Valet service was exceptional in helping us (and saving my wife from a VERY DISGRUNTLED taxi driver), so much thanks to them! We loved that this hotel was quiet, away from the Downtown madness was nice, and the rooms were spacious, clean, amazing view, and great for a weekend trip

<Content>Although the hotel was nice and clean and comfortable, they really nickel and dime you for everything, so I would not recommend staying here. You have to pay a ridiculous nightly rate for parking ($22 to $28 per night), you have to pay for internet access and the food in the restaurant is exorbitantly priced and not any better than any other restaurant. They also had the nerve to tell me that I could not feed my baby her baby food at breakfast because it was "outside food." Really? Were they going to go in the back an puree organic sweet potatoes for her to eat? Probably not.

He has been our number one priority and has never been without us at any time over the past eleven years. It was the first time we have spent one entire day alone with no children during that time.

The nautical decor at the hotel was beautiful. Full service Starbucks, restaurant, computer area, ping pong tables, fitness, pool, club level lounge - everything was great. The club level lounge offered breakfast, hor d'euves, bottled water, beautiful view and clean decor. We had a room with two double beds. Not two queens which was interesting. Very enjoyable stay overall! Beautiful marina views.

<Title>“Booked on Priceline - Excellent Value”
<Content>We decided to take a long weekend trip to San Diego to visit some friends that live in the area, and booked this hotel by selecting a 4-star "name your own price" deal on Priceline. I believe we only paid $95 per night. Overall, for $95 a night, this hotel was excellent value. We had a nice large room, with a balcony overlooking the marina. The room was spacious, clean and had been renovated, although the hotel itself is quite old. We ate the breakfast buffet which was also good. PROS: - Excellent value @ $95 per night when booking on priceline. - Good breakfast buffet - Great location (close to Downtown and the Airport) - Nice, clean, spacious rooms CONS: - Older Hotel - Rates may by higher when not booking through priceline

<Content>This was our third stay at this great hotel and the service was even better than ever. The location is perfect for us, within a few minutes of all the great San Diego beaches and parks. From arrival to check out the staff could not have been nicer, they were very warm, genuine and welcoming. Especially Chris at the front desk and the servers in the club lounge and the harbors edge restaurant. We enjoyed great food and a lovely comfortable room with gorgeous views overlooking the Marina. Our toddler was mesmerized by the amazing yachts in the marina and the beautiful aquarium in the lobby and our tweener loved the 'link' in the lobby. Our favorite spot was the firepit by the marina, the perfect place for sunset.

<Title>“Lovely Hotel and Staff”
<Content>We were a bit apprehensive after seeing the Trip Advisor reviews and ratings, but this place was really very good. We knew about the $22 a day parking charge, but beacause we got a good deal on the room, overall it was still an inexpensive four star hotel away from the city centre. The staff were lovely, there are complimentary newspapers, and the room, although not massive, was comfortable for two, and the beds/pillows are divine. There are seven free computers in the lobby for guests to use - brilliant ! On the down side, my wife thought the spa to be overall lacking in facilities, the maid forgot to service our room on the second day, and it isn't really within walking distance of alternative eateries, so you'd need to use your car. We ate in the Boathouse Restaurant about a mile away on Harbor Island and the food/service was fantastic (but not cheap).

<Title>“Great views and friendly serevice”
<Content>We love staying here. Strongly recommend you join SPG rewards and get an American Express SPG Rewards card. Had a great view of the harbor on our last visit. Also, we left an item in the room and the lost and found staff was very efficient. Nicholas found the item and it was quickly sent back to us!

<Title>“Great location & Great Price!”
<Content>We love staying in Mission Bay when we come to San Diego but wanted something different. I got a good deal on hotwire. Location was nice. Next to the airport but the sounds weren't too bad like other peoples comments. (and I'm a light sleeper) We stayed in the lanai section and loved it. It was a 3 story building next to the main hotel. Loved the 2 pools and view from our room. We had a view of a pool and marina. It was also close to the parking lot and didn't have to deal with the lobby area. We even watched the fireworks from Seaworld from our hotel. Parking is alot but you pay that at most 4 star hotels. The only complaint I had was the bathroom was very small. The door would hit you when you were sitting on the toilet. When you have small kids, that's not fun! Was also hard getting into the shower/bath if the door was open. Loved the starbucks and computer lounge area in the lobby.

<Title>“Nice hotel, Beautiful view.”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews on here, I was pleasently suprised with this hotel! We stayed in a room on the 11th floor of the Marina Tower, where we had special access to the Club Lounge. We got a good deal on the internet on this room with special access to the Club Lounge for a free continental breakfast every morning. Our room was nice - we had a view of the water (the Marina and the pool). The only thing I didn't like was the pillows were not very good, also they did not have a single towel rack in the bathroom!!! That was quite a pain, especially with 3 of us in a room using towels. The restaurant's in the hotel were O.K. They were quite expensive. A drink at Quinn's was $12, and pasta with chicken was $21. They also let you take drinks down to the pool, which was nice. In the evenings, Quinn's and Tapatini were quite popular places to be. I really liked the atmosphere. It was a great way to relax and meet new people! The area around the hotel does not have much. There are 2 other restaurants that are able half a mile, and a mile away from the hotel. Island Prime and Tom Ham's Lighthouse were both worth walking to. We ended up taking a taxi home because we were too full to walk. We used taxi's to get everywhere because we did not want to worry about trying to use the buses. Taxi's are a bit more expensive than the buses and trolleys, but it saves you tons of time and hassle! The free shuttle to and from the airport was very nice. I loved the view from the hotel. Being right on the ocean and in the marina was beautiful. The paths to walk along the ocean were very nice. I would suggest requesting the Marina Tower, as it is the part that has all of the amentities. The Bay Tower is a little ways away from the main tower and does not have any amentities. The service we received at this hotel was great. Check in was quick. Room service was quick. The concierge was AWESOME! and the bell boy's outside to help us in and out of the taxi's was great!

<Title>“great hotel, not child friendly”
<Content>gorgeous hotel and location, however........they made us wait 2 hours after checkin time with two screaming, hungry, tired kids to check in, I had to beg 3 TIMES for a cot in our room, I lost my tempter and they finally delivered it at 8pm. Not happy with the service. The hotel is in an isolated area with no cafes, resturants, you are forced to eat in their extremely expensive resturants, not good for family with budget.

<Title>“Very Clean. Not a 4 star.”
<Content>Stayed with my family over an early Spring Break in April. This is not a true 4 star. It felt like a 3 star. Not plush in any way. Very basic. Plastic cups in the bathroom. Nothing special. Though the hotel is nice and clean. It is an uneventful place to stay. It is walking distance to some good restaurants. But you have to get in your car to go to any other fun places in the city. Parking is $24! My 7 and 5 year olds enjoyed having the marina to look out to every morning. Other than that, there was nothing for them to do in the hotel. As the weather was drab. We stayed in the new building. I was told the older building had more to it. Starbucks and such.

<Title>“Great place to stay”
<Content>Just spent the weekend at the Gator by the Sea festival and stayed at the San Diego Marina Hotel. Right next to the airport. I have very very happy with the hotel. The rooms were natical themed and very comfortable. Went with friends and they came to our room that night and we played cards and had a bottle of wine and cheese my daughter had sent me for mothers day thru room service. It was fantastic. Then when it was time to hit the sheets I was double impressed. The sheets were so nice and new. They were like sleeping in brand new sheets for the first time. I was overly impressed with the Sheraton. Definately would re-visit. Debbie Schlotbom

<Title>“Really good, except for the major headache”
<Content>My boyfriend and I booked a trip out to San Diego - first time in CA for both of us. The hotel was super close to the airport and the continuous shuttle (runs to and from both Bay and Marina Towers every 15-20 mintues) was great. We used that everyday to get to the airport and pick up the city bus. The room was very nice and clean, and the view of the bay/downtown from the Bay Tower was AMAZING. The voucher for refusing room service is a nice deal. We were never bothered by any airport noise. The big problem we ran into was on our third night there, the room key stopped working. We walked down to the desk and were told that there was a problem with our enitre floor's keys and they would send someone up. Not exactly sure why they didn't have someone stationed on our floor to let everyone in if they knew there was a problem. Fifteen minutes later someone finally showed up to let us in. Meanwhile, a couple down the hall had no problem getting in their room - so much for the entire floor having problems. We were told it would be fixed. The next day we were getting ready to leave in the morning, trying to catch the city bus on time. I forgot something in the room and ran upstairs to grab it. But the key still didn't work. We spoke to the front desk and the lady there was surprised we were having problems. Obviously didn't get the memo from the other front desk people. When we returned that night, the key still wasn't working. Again, the front desk seemed totally unaware that there was a problem. Luckily the replacement key we were given worked for that night and the next night too. Overall, a really nice hotel - with using the shuttle to get the bus at the airport made it easy to get downtown. Would have given it four stars, but being locked out of your room three times isn't much fun.

<Title>“Great Stay!”
<Content>I was little nervous about the hotel when reading all of the negative comments. I went there for 4 day and 3 nights for work/leisure with family. Check in really quick and the front desk was very courteous. Room was very clean and the view was good. Some airport/airplane noise. They could use better quality of toiletry. Bed was fantastic!!!! Somewhat of limited parking...parked in the dirt parking 3 out of 4 days but it was only 20 yards of extra walking. Ate at Quinn's...good service and decent food. Went to Starbucks for 2 breakfast/coffee....employees need to stop yawning when working the cash register (both days). Otherwise, good hotel and good employees!

<Content>If I had any negatives to say it would be that the mattress was really firm. Personally I do not like a firm mattress, thus, my back was bothering me. The hotel was very clean and the staff was very helpful. The bayside view was wonderful. The location is great and getting to the main attractions is easy. I would strongly recommend this hotel to others and definitely plan on going back. I am VERY critical when it comes to hotels so trust me when I say this is well worth the money.

<Title>“Great hotel, but secluded with $22 parking!”
<Content>I stayed here with my sister as we were planning her destination wedding. We got a great rate on hotels.ca, however, when you factor in the $22 parking, it doesn't seem to be as great of a bargain. There is absolutely no street-side parking, and a car is mandatory given that this hotel is located close to the airport and basically far away from amenities and tourist attractions (Coronado, Balboa Park, Mission Beach, Fashion Valley etc...). The rooms were fantastic. It was very clean, and spacious, and the gym is fantastic. There are many cardio machines, however, the free weights are geared more towards men than women. There is an excellent running route along the bay, which I enjoyed immensely. There are free computers with wireless in the lobby, or you can use your own laptop. Unfortunately, the wireless did not reach our room. It may be a good idea to ask for a room close to the lobby so you can use a smartphone in your room. In sum, the rooms were great, however, it was a bit far away from the sights. I would recommend this as a transit hotel as there is a free airport shuttle a couple times an hour.

<Title>“Bay tower is average, very far from San Diego city, airport noise is loud!”
<Content>Upon booking with Sheraton, i read reviews on here and specifically requested that we be booked in the main tower. Alas, we were in the Bay Tower... Which looks extremely old and run down in comparison to the main tower. We never went to the main tower, as we had to drive to get everywhere anyway, so can't really compare. Upon arrival, got told that our prepaid booking was cancelled, but luckily they reinstated it fairly quickly and upgraded us to a high floor. That was quite annoying, but not their fault, more my travel agents but oh well. Guest services staff were lovely. Room was comfortable, not outstanding, but ok. View of marina was pretty, but this was overshadowed by the constant planes that were overhead. Was not told that we were so close to the airport, nor so far away from downtown. MUST have a car if staying here, otherwise it would be annoying to get anywhere! A huge plus is the business centre that has free unlimited internet, which was a godsend after a week and a half of expensive internet. You have to log in each hour, but its worth it! The gift shop was cute, and had some cool stuff. Overall, not sure i would choose either of these Sheraton's as they are too far away from the city centre for my liking....

<Title>“Great Service!”
<Content>Awesome staff. Great location! We stayed in the main building and it was beautiful. The rooms were clean and very tastefully decorated. It's next to the hotel, but we never once heard the planes. My only gripe is the parking fees. $22 a day for self-parking and $28 for valet. We decided to valet since there was an event going on when we arrived and self-parking was pretty full. The valet service was awesome. We would call down before leaving the room and our car would be waiting for us when we got to the front door. Just wish they could give hotel guests a break on the parking fees.

<Title>“Nice view, but remote”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton with my wife and two daughters (ages 6 and 3). From reading other entries, I realized that I should request the Bay Tower, which I understand the rooms are a little older (although recently renovated) and a little bigger. We stayed on the eight floor, which had a great view of San Diego Bay. Our stay included the weekend, so we had a great view of the boats traversing by. One factor to consider is that the Bay Tower is approximately a quarter mile from the main facility at the Marina Tower and Lanai areas. I didn't really spend time at the other areas, but I heard that the amenities (business area, resturant and pool) may be a little nicer there. We wanted the bigger room and the view. We did have breakfast at the restaurant at the Bay Tower. It is buffet-style with the basic bacon/sausage, eggs/omlette, potatoes. There are also breakfast pastries, oatmeal, cold cereal and fruit. It is nice, The cost is what you would expect from a place higher-end hotel like the Sheraton. The pool area at the Bay Tower is a little small. There is also a hot tub. If the pool area is of particular interest for your family, I'd suggest staying at the Marina Tower and/or Lanai. Because of the weather, we didn't use the pool. Location is a bit remote. Hotel is right across the entrance to San Diego Airport. I could see how it would be convenient for a business meeting with people flying in from across the country. However, it is 10-15 minutes away from Horton Plaza/Downtown/Gaslamp District. It is about the same distance to Balboa Park and and the San Diego Zoo. As such, you will need vehicle transportation to enjoy the sights and sounds of the city (and pay for parking at most places along the way). Self-parking was $22/night. You use your room key to get in and out (so make sure you have it). It is commeasurate with the downtown hotels. I'm note sure why it is so expensive, but make sure that you factor that into your plans. The Wall Street Journal and USA Today were available in the lobby. In all, we had a good stay at the Sheraton. We really enjoyed the view from our room. However, the location is a bit farther away if you were expecting to be in the heart of the action in San Diego.

<Title>“Good choice for short stay”
<Content>Good sized room with nautical theme, balcony with nice bay view even on "garden view" price. Comfy bed. Chose the $5 food voucher over room cleaning, but just a warning that means no housekeeping visit at all-- beds left unmade. Took free shuttle to airport to catch city bus into town and avoided high overnight parking fee. Pros: nice rooms with view of bay or marina, comfy bed, close to airport, has pool/spa and restaurants, free shuttle to and from airport, free internet for 1 hr/day in business center. Cons: high priced parking if you have a car, weird not to get ANY housekeeping, have to take bus to attractions in town.

<Title>“Indifferent”
<Content>Stayed here en route home and needed to be near airport for a 6 am flight. Arrived late, area didn't seem very safe and wouldn't have walked around alone. Hotel slightly jaded, room fine but reception area and restaurant shabby. Food indifferent, wine expensive, Shuttle service to airport only runs from 6 so no good for me. Was told a taxi would be no problem but in the event had to wait 20 minutes and ended up running! With retrospect I'd rather have paid a little more and stayed in a better hotel where I'd have felt safer, enjoyed the evening more and got a taxi with no problem the next morning

<Title>“No longer barefoot”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton on a business trip (although i did have a couple days to play). This was my first visit to San Diego and your Hotel made my stay all the more fabulous. The room was kept clean throughout my stay and all of the staff were helpful and pleasant. I flew back to Sacramento and realized i left a rather expensive pair of shoes in the room. I called and left a message for "Lost and Found" and withing a few hours Nicholas had returned my call and got the ball rolling to get my shoes back to me. Within 3 days i had them back. It was just one more wonderful experience that your hotel provide me with. Thank you Nicholas.... Thank You Sheraton. Ayren

<Title>“Does Not Cater for Children”
<Content>Quite a nice Hotel in a location that is betwixt and between. Not really within walking distance of any facilities (cafes, shops etc) but has a beautiful outlook over the Marina. Very handy to the airport though, if you are flying in. Our room faced the Marina so aircraft noise was not a problem. May be different on airport side. The TV selection is skewed towards business with very few Childrens channels. Glad we had a room at the main building as the other section was quite a distance. Must mention Rocio as she was a standout server.

<Title>“Perfect staycation!!!”
<Content>It was my birthday weekend, we lucked out with priceline. This hotel has been in SD for a while and we were a little apprehensive. We heard about the renovation and it was fantastic!!! First and foremost - the option to decline housekeeping for a $5.00 voucher that can be used at the hotel (yes, Starbucks too) is BRILLIANT! Why can't every hotel do this!!! We always decline housekeeping and tidy our own room, hang towels for reuse, make our own bed, which saves the hotel $$$$ with no incentive, this place gets it! They will give you clean towels by the way, and you still get the $ 5.00 voucher! Another thing, the elevators are ample, large and fast, the elevator lobby on each floor is huge, bright, scenic and impressive, again as compared to gaslamp hotels, which seem to skimp on elevators if you ask me. The only drawback is distance from gaslamp, but this hotel made up for it. When we checked in the kind clerk said we had an economy room booked, but she promptly said she'd put us in a better room on the 6th floor, and we got a king as we had hoped for. The room is very spacious, with a downtown view, balcony, great bed and linens. Small bathroom, but well done - subway tile in shower, tub, lots of spots to hold soap, shampoo, etc., rain shower head, marble vanity with very nice lighting. Flat screen TV, high ceilings, very nice. Super, super quiet, even with airport across the street! The pool set it apart from other gaslamp hotels. It was really awesome. Overlooking the marina, tons of space, lots of lounge chairs, big pool, sunny, cabana bar, really great for downtown SD. The hotel lobby is great, computer kiosks with internet, cozy, modern. Starbucks in lobby is great. Parking at $ 22.00 for self park in lot that is part dirt is ridiculous. If you self park, be sure to bring room key to let yourself out of unattended parking lot! We had to re-park, go to lobby, get another key, just to exit the parking lot! A drag. We loved this hotel. The spacious grounds, spacious rooms, pool, we hope to stay again!!!!!

<Content>Best 27 anniversary we have experienced. We arrived on Friday evening after driving from Arizona, and from that point on it was just perfect.. We were greeted by a very professional friendly staff and went on up to our room. We proceeded out to the balcony to enjoy a beautiful view of the boats and the bay.. We were very tired and ordered room service the gentleman was so friendly and the food was delicious, in fact we ordered room service a few more times during our stay and had coffee and desert in the hotel restaurant and every time it was excellent our stay was so enjoyable and the room was so clean and everything was so perfect always want to stay with Sheraton the staff that was top of the line this Sheraton was on harbor island drive. I would choose this hotel over any other when in San Diego....

<Title>“Sacrifice convenience for quality”
<Content>I stayed here for the weekend with my 10 year old daughter. I got a good rate for the hotel for under $100 a night at Priceline so I thought. First of all from the reviews I expected the Marina Tower to be a better fit so asked for an upgrade and got one from the desk agent at an unexpected extra $20 a night. Now the Marina tower is nice because it has a restaraunt, bar, starbucks and heated pool along with full service gym. However if you want a bigger room and in my opinion better views stay at the Bay tower. They have a basic lobby but if you don't need all the ammenities I previously mentioned then that place is probably the better location. The bay tower is serviced by a free shuttle. I would stay at the bay tower next time. As far as transportation service. My daughter and I relied on public transportation. The shuttle takes you to the airport where you catch the bus. Since we relied on public transportation this place was not convenient. If you plan to travel the same way choose a place closer to the hub of transportation (downtown). I rented a car the last day and found free parking on the pennisula. This is closer to the bay tower and is a cheap way to park your car. Be advised there are only about 15 free parking spaces that are 3 hour time limit but free all night after 11. All and all the hotel is nice but I wouldn't stay here if you plan on exploring San Diego. We had a "Go Card" so that is what we did. I would like to thank "Angelique" at the front desk for her professional and kind service in dealing with the charges for my room. Noise is not an issue. PLenty of computers at business center so WIFI is not necessary

<Title>“Nice hotel. Management could use an attitude adjustment.”
<Content>My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sheraton for a little vacation in San Diego. The location was a bit of an issue at first because we thought it was going to be downtown, so it was further away than we thought. We fell in love with the view from our room and the girls at the concierge helped us rent a car so we could get around the city better. The beds were comfortable and our room was always spotless when we returned from sight seeing. It was also nice that there was a Starbucks in the hotel. Our only issues with this hotel was the overpriced, poor quality breakfast buffet and the unhelpful, rude hotel manager we had a run-in with. I have been all over the world and stayed in a variety of hotels, the breakfast buffet at the Sheraton wasn't even comparable to a continental breakfast at a Holiday Inn. Poorly cooked eggs and rotten fruit cost us $19 each! The other issue with the manager happened on friday night (April 8th). We were looking for parking and could not find any on one side of the hotel and the other side was blocked. We were exhausted and just wanted to get to our room. We asked a valet what the problem was and we were informed that there was a large wedding the next day that required the whole other side of the parking lot. We asked if we could valet for the same price as regular parking (Reg is $22 and Valet is $28), he said he would have to ask the manager. We pulled over and waited for a decision. The manager on duty came to our car and rudely informed us again of the wedding and that he would not valet our car for anything less than $28. We asked what we were supposed to do and he condescendingly told us we would have to park in employee parking that was very far away from the hotel and unpaved (it was raining so it was a big muddy mess). My boyfriend expressed that this was unacceptable and as guests we should have parking close the hotel. The manager then yelled at him that we would have to park there or not at all and there was nothing else he could do for us and walked away without another word. Like I said I travel quite frequently and have stayed in 5 star hotels and no-star hotels and I have never had some speak to me the way that manager did (I wish I could remember his name). Sheraton should take more care in training their entire staff to meet the needs of their guests, especially their managers. Overall the staff was very friendly and helpful, but one bad seed can ruin a nice evening.

<Title>“Disneyland or Airport Hotel”
<Content>Overall this is a nice property and a quality hotel located at the San Diego Airport. I would not rate it a business hotel, more of a family hotel you would expect to find next to Disneyland. If you have a family attending Sea World or local attractions, I recommend this hotel. It is also extremely convenient to the airport. We had issues with check-in, waiting over 2 hours in the lobby. In the hotel's defense we arrived at 1PM, so we were early. However, the desk staff said the room was available, just not cleaned. They would "call housekeeping to have it prioritized" and it would be ready within an hour. Later another person at the desk laughed and said that was crazy, Housekeeping doesn't do that. After over 2 hours, they gave me a room that was already cleaned. The biggest negative was the Club Lounge, which we paid extra to have access to. Our card key did not work, so we had to go to the desk to have it fixed (again). At breakfast it was an interstate exit Hampton Inn with at least 12-15 little kids (ages 8 and under). Wow...wiping noses and then pawing through the pastries, eating from the line, taking stacks of things...real disgusting mess. We also had an issue getting to the Lounge and central elevator because of a "closed for contrsuction" hallway, which the desk told me was incorrect, "you just must be going the wrong way". The desk staff was very unhelpful and definitely never once asked about out stay. I would have told them and moved on. Now I am just disappointed.

<Title>“Perfect”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina for two days. We were leaving on a cruise and wanted to spend a day exploring San Diego. The hotel has a shuttle at the airport. It runs on a continuous loop. There is no need to call the hotel to arrange pick up. The driver was very nice and offered some advice about things to do in San Diego. We stayed in the Marina tower in a club level room. The room was nicely appointed. The shower had plenty of hot water. The bed was comfortable. We had a very nice view of the marina. I enjoyed having my morning coffee out on the balcony. We enjoyed the club lounge. There were hot appetizers at night and a continental breakfast in the morning. There is a computer in the lounge with free internet access. Be prepared to wait in line as there is only one computer. The pool area was fantastic. After a day of airline cancellations and delays it was so nice to relax in the hot tub. We even made friends with another couple who was going on the same cruise. I would recommend staying at this hotel. It was wonderful experience. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. We will absolutely stay here again if we travel to San Diego.

<Title>“Great Hotel - wonderful view!”
<Content>This was a wonderful hotel. Very clean, very comfortable beds, nice staff. Had a great nights sleep each night. We checked in and the package we bought included a free upgrade and free breakfast. The front desk person was nice and very accomodating. We got 7th floor, king bed with a view of the bay/pool. Very nice! You can hear the airport a bit, esp. early in the morning. If you are a light sleeper, you may mind this. We got our breakfast vouchers with no problem. The breakfast buffet they had was great quality and Luis took wonderful care of us. Absolutely no problems at all. Location was good for us. We had a rental car and I think that is a good suggestion for this location. I do agree with most - the parking is crazy....$22 per night. I think if you are a guest there, they should cut you a bit of a better deal. We justified it with the free Breakfast. Pool was good. We layed by it for a few hours one day, but was too cold for us to enjoy it much. There were kids enjoying it, though!! Overall, we had a great experience!!

<Title>“Beautiful hotel on the Marina”
<Content>The hotel is located right on the Bay and a taxi ride away to the Gas Lamp district. My room was overlooking the Marina and was able to take advantage of the spectacular sunsets. The best part about staying at any Sheraton is the comfort of their beds and pillows. I stayed for 4 nights and was able to sleep great. The rooms are very modern and clean. Immediately outside of the hotel is a jogging trail along the marina that I took advantage of...beautiful trail since it's parallel to the bay. I always enjoy my stays at Sheraton's and would recommend this one as well. If you are looking for a place right in the middle of nightlife, shopping, restaurants...stay in the Gaslamp district. I went into the Gaslamp district one night...but the taxi fare was expensive for it being only 3-4 miles away.

<Title>“Two Double Beds :(”
<Content>I am coming to the Sheraton April 12th on a business trip with my husband (HIS trip) I am just coming to get away and enjoy this beautiful hotel. Swimming, running trails, spa, workout room and restaurant. I noticed our reservation said two double beds :( That is NOT good for time away with my sweetheart without kids. I called reservations and they cannot switch me. They are all booked up. I LOVE and use Trip Advisor ALL the time and hope management will see this and possibly help this desperate wife out. We will enjoy our stay either way but was hoping to make in more memorable!

<Title>“Nice stay in San Diego”
<Content>My husband and I made our first trip to San Diego this past weekend to visit our son who is in the Navy. We made our reservation through Expedia and I have to admit I was a little skeptical because I had never reserved a hotel that way but I must say that we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is at a great location, beautiful views and friendly staff. Our room was very comfortable. I read a couple of reviews last week that said the close proximity to the airport was a problem because of noise but my husband and I did not experience any noise problems at all. We had a marina king room and loved the view. Overall, it was a great experience and we would definitely stay at this hotel again.

<Content>Great hotel for conference. Excellent location. Excellent health club with 24 hour access. I forgot my iphone charger in the room and realized when I was at the airport. I called lost and found and both Nicolas and Andy were very helpful and understanding. They went to my room right away to look for my item and followed up with me promptly. They mailed my charger next business day and I had it within 3 days.

<Content>Fabulous hotel-great atmosphere! We enjoyed this hotel & the location. What a beautiful view of the harbor & very comfortable rooms. The pools were beautiful (1 heated 1 not) which we enjoyed despite the cold weather. Follow the signs to the airport out to Harbor Island for this hotel. It is not far from the zoo & downtown San Diego & Corronado.

<Title>“Beautiful hotel, location & rooms, but don't open the mini bar!”
<Content>We booked the Marina Tower because Trip Advisor rewiews advised against the Bay Tower and we couldn't have been more pleased with the hotel room, the beautiful property and the views! One negative I'll mention is that our stay was pre-paid as part of an Expedia package, and for the very first time in my life I didn't ask for a copy of the folio when we checked out. I'd taken a $10 container of nuts from the mini bar but was in the room when the lady came to check the mini bar, so felt it was understood what I had used. Usually they record what you've used and give you a receipt but she didn't. Well, you can imagine my surprise when my credit card was billed over $64! Accounting told me that the items in the mini bar are sensored, so if you remove an item (to read the label in my case) you will automatically be charged for it. Apparently the 'sensors' are to stupid to know when you've replaced the item back in its place. Anyway as a 'courtesy' I was credited back for the other 3 items I had been charged for - wow thanks guys. The nuts ended up costing $13 because they also add tax and a 'service charge' so be sure to add 30% to the listed price. Okay - lesson learned - it's great place to stay but don't open the mini bar!

<Title>“Great view and great staff!!”
<Content>I was here as part of the HP Sales training this past week. I stayed in the Bay Hotel part of this complex...its a 5 minute walk from the main marina hotel. I was upgraded to the 11th floor and it was amazing. I had a view of the bay & downtown san diego. The sunsets were to die for. i dont think you can go wrong because the view across the hall is of the marina. The staff here was VERY accomodating and friendly, from the workers at the check-in desk to the people cleaning, to the service gentleman that was on the elevator with me. It's a super intentional friendly that makes me want to come back. The only negative was that the chairs in my room had worn fabric but thats mostly a cosmetic issue. Also, its like $22/night for parking so take a cab here :) The food at the harbour island restaurant at the marina was AMAZING!!! i NEVER eat hotel food and am so glad i did there...4 star!! Also, there's a little deli in between the two hotels that had great food as well...it was a lot cheaper than the one in the hotel..$16 for an omelette ouch! Bottom Line: you'll really like this hotel and its a super quick drive downtown

<Title>“Very Comfortable”
<Content>My husband and I stayed for (1) night before our cruise ship sailed. We checked in very easily and were given a Marina king room on the ninth floor. The view of the city skyline and marina were wonderful. The hotel, in itself, is nicely decorated and the rooms are nautically themed. It was nice to have a small balcony to sit and enjoy the views (and watch our cruise ship pull into the port terminal at 5:30 in the morning). Beds are very comfortable and the room was clean. Only complaint would be the slow service in the lounge restaurant and the distance to the Gaslamp district. LONG WALK!

<Content>I have stayed at this hotel many times before and I must say I was always a little disappointed in the past with the service and the general ambiance of the hotel. I stayed in mid Feb 2011. The hotel has changed dramatically for the better, it is a much more relaxing place to stay. The staff are friendlier, the rooms are comfortable. I now look forward to my next stay very much.

<Title>“Excellent Service”
<Content>My son left his favorite stufffed puppy at the hotel on our trip last month. He was so worried about how we would get him back. We were already at the airport, and so we called their customer service number. Nicolas in the Lost and Found department found his puppy and contacted us to let us know that he had been found. They also shipped it back to Nebraska for us free of charge. Thankfully our son only had to sleep a couple nights without "Puppy". So thankful for the extra steps the staff made on our behalf.

<Content>We had a Marina tower - double room on a higher floor. The beds were very comfortable. No noise and we slept really well! At an Airport Hotel! Starbucks in Lobby! Internet in Lobby but Extra cost in room. 11$ Close to car rental and cruise terminal. Extra cost to park the car. $22 Nice restaurants in the Lobby and a very nice pool area.. Amazing view from our room of San Diego and the Bay! We had a Balcony. Even better if you have a King! We had our son along so we were nice and got a double. Great Last Night in San Diego. Went to Little Italy for Dinner very Nice.

<Content>Wonderful location, friendly and accommodating staff, beautiful grounds, great food and drinks. I had a very enjoyable time and would give this hotel four stars if it weren't for the nasty condition of the bathroom. I mean, for a four star hotel, this was truly disappointing. Please Sheraton, for the prices you charge and the lovely amenities, every part of your guest rooms should be SPOTLESS.

<Content>Upon leaving my room, I left a small but crucial part of the charger for my laptop in the outlet. Nicolas Osorio Casanova responded quickly to the call I made, and returned the needed part. He saved me time and money, and made my memory of the experience even better. Such attention encourages me to recommend this hotel to others.

<Title>“Great location, but pricey.”
<Content>I stayed in the Marina Tower for 5 nights for a conference. The location is directly across the street from the San Diego Airport. The rooms are well appointed and cozy. My room had a small balcony which was nice to let fresh air in. Some nights I could hear planes fly by, but not more than a couple times. The bathroom was clean and the huge showerhead was like rainfall. Starbucks coffees and teas in room. The grounds are well kept, it was nice to walk around the Marina when the sun was out. I ate at the Harbor's Edge Restaurant as part of the conference. The breakfast buffet was great - eggs, bacon, sausage, pastries, FRESH fruit and more. Had lunch there a couple of times, too. The burger was alright, nothing special. They give you your condiments in individual jars, which was sanitary, but I felt like I wasted a lot of it. The biggest con about the hotel is how nothing is included. Self-parking and internet add a significant amount to the price of the hotel.

<Title>“Wow! What a week!”
<Content>I have read some of the reviews below and was flabergasted to read that their visits were less than expected. I found just the opposite to be true. I believe that the service was one of the best that I have ever experienced. Everyone that I spoke to were in the business of sales which is why I was there. The smiles from the front desk down to housekeeping were a refreshing sight day to day. I was there for 6 days and never found it to be anything but this. After returning to my home I realized that I had left articles of clothing in the dresser. I immediately called and was treated pleasantly and very attentively by Sue Seirres. She was going to follow up and check the room herself but in the mean time she would transfer me to Security. At this time I met Nicolas Osorio. What a kind and very friendly voice. He as well was going to go check the room himself and would phone me back. He returned my call in less than 30 minutes and had located the items. He said that he would Fed-X them to me the next day (Saturday the 5th) But then he realized that FedX does not ship on the weekends, he called me back immediately and said they wouldn't go out until Monday. How nice was that?? I received the items this week along with a letter NOT a note from Nicolas. He wanted me to let the hotel know that the box arrived safely more specifically my 'lovely purple sweater'. he knew that this was the item I relished the most. He felt his kindness in his words of the letter. A special thanks to Nicolas and the rest of the Sheraton employees. Oh, and by the way Sue did follow up and called me shortly after Nicolas did. I travel a lot with my company and I do believe that this was the best accommodations that we have had in many years. (including DisneyWorld). Thanks Shearton for treating your guests like family.

<Title>“Noisy , nice hotel”
<Content>You would think with the airport nearby that the sound of the planes would be an issue. I wasn't . What was annoying was the noise coming from the other rooms. I could hear people using the bathrooms, flushing toilets, taking showers, and opening and closing the sliding doors, and talking. This was surprising for me. Usually, such 1st rate hotels are constructed better than this. The hotel is spotless, the staff pleasant and helpful. I did not like the idea of paying for internet access in the room. I do not feel like lugging my equipment down stairs when I want to check email. To do any kind of work, I would have had to camp out in the Lobby all afternoon. And lets not forget the parking fee. $22. So lets see, No Free Parking, NO Free Internet Access in your room, and if you are in the smaller hotel, only a cafe/bar to dine in. Will I stay here again....probably not. Would I recommend, again, probably no.

<Content>Beautiful hotel on the marina. Great convention facility. The hotel is right next to the airport so you get noise from the airport around the clock (not overly bad but still). Hotel is on the other side of the water from downtown so be prepared to take a taxi or rent a car. Parking at the hotel is $$$$$$ and there is not place to park for free. The rooms were beautiful and spacious.

<Title>“Bay Tower was Very Nice”
<Content>Customer service was friendly and very good in the Bay Tower. The rep greeted us warmly and upon hearing our stay was a part of our anniversary trip, she congratulated us and proactively provided us with complimentary breakfast vouchers (which included a nice buffet of eggs, meats, breads, fruits, steel cut oats, yogurts, cereals, coffee, etc.). Her generosity was not solicited or expected but was a real treat! The lobby was clean, bright, and candles were lit in the evenings. To us, these efforts indicate that the focus is on making a customer’s stay as enjoyable as possible – something we appreciated. The spacious room was nice and clean and decorated with a nautical theme that included vibrant reds and blues. We were allocated a room on the marina side and the views were quite serene and pleasant especially in the morning – the Coronado bridge, ships, and bay were nice to view . A few things to note: internet in the rooms is not included and neither is self – parking for $22. Parking we can somewhat understand as that is typically part of a nicer hotel stay but we feel the rate is rather elevated. The internet fee, however, is in our opinion outdated and unnecessary. We would venture to guess that a charge for the net may result in loss of business. Also, the refrigerator in the room is for their food and drinks only. Do not remove any of it to store your items as some sensor will automatically charge the removed items to your bill. Just some info… Overall, we would recommend this Sheraton because of the friendliness and customer service, clean and spacious room, and nice views. We would stay there again.

<Title>“Acceptable when nothing else is available, but avoid the Bay Tower”
<Content>The Sheraton here is a standard run-of-the-mill chain hotel—decent, but nothing special. Not my kind of hotel, but acceptable when there's no better choice. I stayed here because everything else was booked because of 2 conventions in town. But my biggest beef is the deceitful "bait & switch" I was subjected to! After checking into the main lobby, I was told my room was in the Bay Tower just 5 minutes' walk away. There was a pretty map of the "property" showing the two towers and the surrounding pools, so I got the impression maybe it's just one of those large resort-like properties. Well, it turns out that this is literally down the road, several commercial property blocks away, in what is a second-rate motel that was probably a Ramada Inn-level place that they bought and are selling as part of the Sheraton. The gym and pool is a joke, the lobby is not a place you can comfortably hang out in, there is no coffee kiosk or Wireless Lounge like in the main building—but you pay the same price. The so-called view is over a parking lot towards the harbor—facing the naval base with turbine engines that go on till late at night. The one good thing if you have an early flight out is that it is literally next to the airport. If I had to stay here again, here's what I'd do next time: 1) Make sure my room is in the main "Marina Tower"—not the second-rate "Bay Tower." This matters to me because I like easy access to a coffeeshop downstairs, and a better gym and pool and hangout areas. Not that it's not a good place—but I'd rather stay at a Double Tree then, and pay accordingly and at least have warm cookie instead of those sensor refrigerators you're warned not to use or touch. 2) If I get stuck in the Bay Tower again, personally, I'd prefer the room to face the Marina instead of the harbor. Yes, the Marina side is the airport side, but I find the plane noise isn't as loud or aggravating as the non-stop turbines from the Naval base.

<Title>“Great hotel”
<Content>We had high expectations for our pre-cruise stay, and were looking forward to a couple of days of relaxation and shopping. Our room was spacious with a balcony overlooking the main pool and although not commanding the dramatic views of the higher floors, was very pleasant (given this hotel was obtained through an opaque booking option, sometimes choices are hit and miss). I am surprised at some reviews describing negative experiences with staff as we encountered nothing but friendly and very efficient service - the guest service agent who checked us in - Dinah - is a gem. The hotel location could be a somewhat negative aspect as the hotel is away from the downtown core of San Diego. However, I researched transport options and we had no trouble accessing public transit. Should you prefer a cab, it is only a 12 minute journey into the city. Given the hotel's proximity to the airport, there was little or no noise issues. We would stay here again any time.

<Content>My wife and I visited the hotel in January 2011 and we were very pleased. What a beautiful place for a weekend outing. We certainly enjoyed all the amenities. This place is well kept and the rooms are spacious and beautiful. All new carpet, furnishings, big flat screen TV and great restaurant inside the complex. The front desk personnel were most helpful and very professional. We felt very fortunate that we landed this place. It sets on beautiful Harbor Island and every room has a beautiful view. The room fee was reasonable,however I am never pleased when I have to pay for parking my vehicle at the facility that I am staying at. The parking fee is $22 per day. The pool area is lovely and well kept. Harbor Island is a great area to run, walk, ride bikes and a great view of the downtown area. Thanks for the fabulous weekend.!!!!

<Title>“Read "TERRIBLE" and "POOR" Tripod reviews BEFORE you book it!”
<Content>This hotel needs to get their Customer Service "wake up" call before they realize that they have certain memebers of staff giving a proper grief, attitude and generally speaking bad customer services to their paying and valuable guests. Sadly enough I know Sheraton for the better, but this stay was a major let down! Horrible experience! We made a mistake by booking this hotel based on the Excellent reviews and we never dreamed of that we would have to agree with lots of people who rated this particular hotel as Poor or even worse Terrible. Our check-in was awful, the receptionist wasn't interested in us at all, and although they have plenty of rooms available on both sides of the hotel (the main big building!) the receptionist didn't even bother to ask us which side we would like to have, ie. Marina view or the absolutely fantastic views of the city, which we didn't get. The Concierge staff were most of the time playing with their mobile phones while we were there, only when you let them know by calling them they would respond to you and then they will acknowledge you. The soap and shampoo were unreplenished and heavily underestimated, and we were left the dirty glasses in our room for days! We have to contact them several times for the soap and shampoo and it arrived there several hours later! When you go half way around to World on a holiday of a lifetime the last thing you need is to be annoyed and frustrated with the basic, small things issues and problems which shouldn't have happened in normal circumstances and with professional members of staff. Some of the staff appeared to us as either new and unsufficiently trained, or just not happy with their job or whatever else is in the background. The room service was slow, and once they appeared they were even slower as they had a new guy in the room service departpment who was to receive his training - in front of us in the evening! This was a horrible experience as we have just landed after a very long flight! Unfortunately the senior member of the room service failed to spot this and unfortunatelly we were left with no other option than to participate in that Circus de la Room Service! Once we finished our meal we called the room service to pick up their trolley, they just told us to drive the trolley out and leave it there, which stayed there for the whole night. They first picked up the trolley in the morning in front of our door. However, once they've picked up the trolley, another room service attendant hours later came to our door banging and asking us for the trolley from a previous night, to our great astonishment! We've told him that the trolley had been picked up by someone else. He was very grumpy in his search for that trolley and he didn't even apologise to us for the disturbance he made. He walked away muttering something to himself. Shocking experience! Chocolate from the mini-bar incident: Wow! This episode is a top notch of BAD Customer Services!! Honestly! WOW! On our 1st night we took a chocolate from our room's mini-bar, and to our great astonishment, the chocolate had expired MONTHS ago! Clearly we were not happy with it, and on our discovery some other products had been expired too! As the mini-bar in the rooms is touch-sensitive, we had try to communicate this to the room service and the front desk, but without any success! So, a trip to the reception in a middle of a night was needed to try and get another chocolate from either them or room service or something like that. The night receptionist failed to understand what the problem was, she wasn't interested in our problem what so ever!! We have explained to her that we don't want to be charged for it so if she can make sure of that, and if we can get someone to replenish other products from the mini-bar asap. Our request fall on death ears, the girl just didn't have a clue what I was on about, and she kept asking me to comeback tomorrow to the reception or to get hold of someone in the room service, but first the following day?!?! She had a proper attitude, so it was best to leave the argument there. Oh my God, the following day our HORRIBLE customer experience continiued!!! WOW!! Someone from the housekeeping came banging at our door, and we have asked her to comeback later as it was very early and it was a proper inconvenience. She spoke very limited English so clearly she did NOT understand what we were telling her. As soon as we realized that the lingustics are the issue we have tried to simplyfy our message to her. Then she walked away. Not even half an hour later she came around again, the same housekeeper, claiming that the room service send her. We didn't want her in the room at that time as we were still asleep but we felt that we didn't have a choice as she muttered something to us that she is busy! WOW! Like we care?? What a stressful event. And yet it did not end here. We have struggled to understand to communicate to her what the problem was about the mini-bar as it is was very obvious to us that the night receptionist did not tell her the whole story! Shocking. So, we have spent good 15 minutes explaining to this lady that we didn't touch or eat or drunk ANYTHING from the mini-bar, she claimed that we did as it was missing, and then we told her that she must seek that missing chocolate bar from the reception!! She was very suspicious, and she muttered something to herself, something which we didn't understand, in Spanish! She was visibly upset about the whole thing although we have tried to explain to her in a very plain language so she did understand what we were telling her. Then all of sudden she started to complain to us that she doesn't understand English very well, and that she will send someone else. We felt sorry for this woman in a way, but we were upset at the same time about how this could have happened, this great misscommunication between the departments. This housekeeper sent from the room service wanted to charge us for the expired chocolate from the mini-bar. No one ever came later on to replenish other expired products from the mini-bar and we have never ever touched that mini-bar again. We never received a call or any message of acknowledgment from anyone from anywhere from the hotel, so we were left in uncertainty about the whole mini-bar experience until we have received our final invoice where we have registered that they did not charge us for the mini-bar products. Awful experiences, constant frustrations, desperation, bad customer services and what else not!! Soon after this room service left our room we were to go to bed again, however that wasn't possible as another housekeeper kept knocking at our door to clean the room although we did have a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door!!!! She came around twice and she realized we were not up then she said she will come back later. She too muttered something to herself and appeared not to be happy because of our presence in the room. The same incident happened the following day too. Awful! On a check out from this hotel the lack of same interest for the paying and valuable guests like us was the same as we entered the hotel, awful, nothing, appaling! Even when we stayed at the 2 or 3 stars places the members of staff were very warm, hospitable, very friendly and kind to us. The room we had didn't have the city view and that was a major let down, although we must emphasize that the rooms are lovely (in the main building!). I can follow to some extent what other critics wrote about the design and furniture of this hotel, however, our main objective and at the same time a total FAILURE of those were lack of friendly and welcoming stuff, appaling customer services and never going and extra mile for a customer!! A major disappointment, frustration, desperation and what else not! We made a major mistake by booking this hotel! The room and the building is nice, they even have Starbucks there which I was quite pleased about it, the area, the lobby is okay and the views around the hotel are nice, but what's the point when you have your holiday and mood ruined by rude members of staff with a proper attitude and no clue what so ever??!! It is a real shame as our money will now go to someone else instead of Sheraton in San Diego! If they don't appreciate your business, well, there are plenty of other competitors who will do anything for you and your valuable revenue!! You don't travel half away around the World on a holiday of a lifetime to get crappy and appaling customer services and attitude, that's just plain WRONG!! :(( And if you're lucky you'll get one of those PR-letters from the Management saying how surprised and sorry they are about your experience and how they hotel pride itself to be the best and blah blah blah, and they will just wish you all the best! What a joke! We won't stay there ever again until the things change DRAMATICALLY for the better, obviously!! Sheraton other places maybe, but this one, no way! One girl from the Concierge and one guy from the Starbucks were the only people who smiled at us once and that's about all the smiley and happy faces in Sheraton we've got during our several days long stay there!

<Title>“Excellence base for a weekend getaway”
<Content>Great Hotel for the money! The front desk personnel is very helpful! Hats off to Melissa and Blanka at front desk for going the extra mile and making our weekend extra special. We stayed at the bay tower, the balconies and the rooms are a little bit bigger I noticed. Excellent view either side of hotel. Rooms need an update, but kept very clean, so you really don't care. Maryann B. in the spa is excellent! She really knows what she is doing! I did the Reflexology and she was the very best! We live in Vegas and go to all the strip hotels for spa services. She is really awesome! Service in the resturants is top notch. Very helpful, Rebecca at the breakfast buffet gave some really nice suggestions and directions! The breakfast buffet for the price should have made to order omelets and waffles. Miss that! Dined in the Harbor View for dinner, Service was excellent and prompt, but for the price and quality of food I would look into one of the more upscale Gaslamp district or some of the fresh fish resturants just down the street. The Hotel is situated on it own Island kinda (park like) Great neighborhood. Overall this hotel is great for a nice quite upscale getaway! I would recommed this hotel!

<Title>“Not a bad base”
<Content>The hotel is right next to the airport, so it's probably best for those who are either stopping over briefly, or those who plan to drive around anyway and just use it as a base for a short stay (which is what I did). Despite the proximity to the airport, I didn't notice the planes at all. There are two hotels - Marina and Bay Hotel - the Marina is definitely the better of the two. The hotel itself was comfortable and the rooms spacious and the one I had had a nice view over the marina. Compared to other hotels I experienced on the same trip, I thought this one was fairly cheap and pretty good value for money. In summary it had what I needed - no more, no less.

<Title>“Always a relaxing stay prior to a long business trip.”
<Content>I fly out of San Diego once a month for overseas business trips. These flights often encompass two days for me to get to my destination, and I've found that getting a room near the airport prior to a departure is the best way to rest up prior to one of these lengthy trips. After trying a few different downtown hotels in San Diego I've finally settled on the Sheraton Marina Hotel. Aside from the being the closest to the airport, it's also the most relaxing. I've never had a bad sleep there, and in fact I always leave for the airport very refreshed. I've come to feel so comfortable with the Sheraton Marina that I've even stayed there a couple times when it didn't involve business. It's become my hotel of choice whenever I'm in San Diego.

We found the room to be spacious with a nice view of the marina and excellent furnishings, plasma TV, and modern nautical decor. The pool, jacuzzi, and fitness club were lovely.

<Title>“beautiful & fantastic service!”
<Content>I was at the Sheraton for only one night so I didn't get to experience any of its many amenities, including the beautiful outdoor pool and tennis courts. I had been traveling all day and was exhausted, and was so happy to have a nice, comfortable, quiet hotel room to crash in. And the service was awesome! I had left a bottle of lotion in the room the following morning--something pretty small, but I did want it back--and Nicolas from Lost & Found was super helpful in locating it. He found it, Fedexed it to me for free, and I got it back right away. So...beautiful location, comfortable, and wonderful, helpful staff...definitely recommend this hotel!

<Title>“Not normal sheraton quality (bay tower)”
<Content>This tower is fairly average. The view and location, however, are outstanding! Restaurant is more like convenience cafe (very small and limited menu). Beds suck (guess they haven't upgraded to new cozy ones). Toilet paper and tissue are cheap and scratchy (details that add to feeling of "nice detail" or "am I in motel 6?"). Front desk staff was friendly but a bit too much to the point for my taste (I like the "is there anything else..." and other courtesies). Took 3 calls and 2 visits to front front desk (over 4 hour period) to get corkscrew and room service menu delivered (I called guest services made my request only to hear "allow me to transfer you to room service"...did this 3 times...never got connected. Just wonder why he didn't send it up..?) Room service and bar staff are super friendly and food was tasty.

<Title>“Sheraton's name and motel 6 quality”
<Content>My family just stayed there for 2 nights and I would never come back to this hotel. My decision to stay in this hotel was base on the beautiful photos from their website but be carefully, there is a bait and switch, when we arrive the hotel, we were sent to another property called "bay tower". The stuff was nice and friendly and when I asked what's the difference between "bay tower" and main hotel. I was told "the room here is 35% larger than main hotel". After we got into the room, we turned on the heater and we all fall asleep until we waked by cold. The heater is not working. called the guest service more than 5 times and no one pick up the phone. I had to go to front desk and tell them that the heater is not working. Almost 1 hour later, a engineer came and fixed the heater. When I asked him to make sure the heater won't break again, he told me to call guest service again if it breaks again. Around 10:30pm, we found that there is no hot water in the bathroom. called guest service more than 5 times and finally somebody picked up the phone and told me that she will send a engineer to my room to check out. more than 30 minutes later, no one shows up and nobody picks up the phone call. Went down the front desk and was told "the boiler is broken and engineer is working on it. no ETA'. we waited another hour and went to bed without taking shower. On the second day, I requested to move to the main hotel. The lobby is beautifully and full of guests and activities. The restaurant is great and feels so warm. After we got back to our room around 8;30pm, we found that the heater is NOT working in our room. called front desk and was told a engineer is on the way. 45 minutes later, no one shows up and I went down to the front desk and was told there were 5 more calls in front of me and their engineer is working very hard to fix the issues and I have to wait. Another 30 minutes later, a guy came in and fix the heater. (not sure if he really fixed or not, before the fix, the temperature shows 65 and after the fix, the temperature shows 71 max. We set it to 74 but never exceed 71) I requested to talk to their manager but was told that the manager was too busy and I only can talk to him after middle night. I was offered one day free parking because of above horrible experience.

<Title>“Family Trip to San Diego”
<Content>This hotel was not bad but not great either. The location was okay. It had nice views but I don't think it's in the best part of town. The hotel overall was clean and looks like it's going through an update. I couldn't tell if our room was an updated room or not. It seemed on the older side. The bathroom was very small and the hairdryer did not work. I left a note asking for a replacement from housekeeping. They took the old one but did not leave a replacement. My big issue was with the service. Everyone was nice but not very competent. When I checked in I asked about an upgrade. I received an email from the hotel prior to arriving offering the opportunity to upgrade for a fee if a room was available. I selected the upgrade I wanted and submitted my credit card information. When I checked in the person at the front desk was not familiar with this but said she could offer me an upgrade. I told her I wanted to stay on the club level. She ended up putting us in the Bay Tower which doesn't offer the club level which was annoying because I paid for this upgrade. I discovered the error the next morning when I called to inquire where the club room was. The person on the phone had to add the club level access to our reservation. He only agreed to do this after I complained about the confusion at check in and the fact that I requested a wake up call but never got one. Overally, I can't complain too much because I got the room for only $79/night (before the extra $20/night for the upgrade). But had I paid more than $100 I would have been mad. This hotel is not worth more than what I paid. Lastly, the $22/night charge for self parking was ridiculous.

<Title>“Staff embodies San Diego's friendly vibe”
<Content>Checked in during holiday week to find (it seemed) 1/2 the population of Nebraska ensconced in the hotel before the Holiday Bowl. Posed no problem for the staff, who were uniformly friendly (unstuffy), upbeat and knew how to do their jobs. Received a great rate so immediately upgraded + $20 to try Club Level extra amenities - between that and all the folks running around in "Huskies" t-shirts - felt like we were on a cruise ship, very family-like feeling given it's a hotel (a place where a bunch of strangers stay together). Afraid this happy vibe might evaporate if Huskies loose ;-) Very comfy 12th floor room with balcony overlooking marina. Surprised at absolutely no airplane noise. We found everything we needed was readily at hand. Hotel has distinction of being turbo (or some new green technology) powered and liked the little touch of being able to skip room service and be green (on a day by day basis) in return for a $5 or 500 Starwood miles credit Best - very interesting location on busy harbor - nice if you like boats (of all shapes and sizes) and Navy helicopters. However, Harbor Island location is not central/downtown. And there are no public transportation options to nearby downtown. Also enjoyed staff's mix of professionalism and genuineness. Odd quirks: Trouble getting to Floor #1 due to obscure elevator bank for that purpose and no (little) signage. Floor #1 is for pool, gym, etc - its elevator bank is located far away from main bank of elevators but no signage at main elevator bank to this effect. Rode up + down main elevators for a while (where there is a floor #1 marked on the panel) but it would not stay lit . Needless crazy making when a few clearer signs would help. Though a nice idea in theory, hors d'oeurves offered in Club Level evening reception Tues-Thursday (gratis though bar charges for drinks) were marginal, a polite word for almost inedible. I have a caste iron stomach and they gave me indigestion! Hope the hotel will review the quality of the fare.

<Title>“Wonderful hotel, albeit a bit isolated”
<Content>The Sheraton Marina was a fabulous hotel. Our room was huge, the decor and condition of the hotel was wonderful, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. We had one small complaint (our peek viewer in the door was reversed - you could not see out of the room, but those in the hall could peek in - the thing was installed in reverse!) but it was fixed in minutes. And close-by the Boathouse Restaurant, recommended by hotel staff, offered great food and very decent prices. Hotel car parking is very pricey, but we dumped the car and enjoyed the neighbourhood. That's the one thing you must remember. The Hotel is too far from downtown to walk reasonably, so a tixi ride is a must if you want to go there.....and you should. San Diego is a great city with lots to see and do.

<Content>We just got back from San Diego and stayed here for 3 nights. PROs 1. Very close to all major attractions (Zoo, SeaWorld, Gaslamp/Downtown) -- not close to Legoland 2. Very clean, excellent service at Check-In, Resteraunt, Housekeeping 3. Breakfast is pretty good with a nice buffet spread - very good service at the restaurant 4. Great location for evening - you can walk to most places in Downtown within 15 minutes 5. Rooms are all suites, which are roomy and let you wind down after a long day 6. Hotel is open to letting you use their fridge to store stuff (even though they have a minibar service) 7. Room includes a Microwave 8. Free 2x Waters per room per day 9. Very quiet rooms CONs 1. Parking is $23 a day, so park on the street if you can. Also parking is on the 11th Floor which means you have to drive up and down 4 floors each way. Parking is very tight spots. 2. Check-in on the 12th Floor and you use a different elevator to go up to your rooms, which means that you have to take a minimum of 2 elevators to get your room

<Title>“Very Disappointing, will never stay here again”
<Content>I stay at the hotel for 4 nights as I attended a conference that was hosted at the hotel. When we arrived in my room I found there was no Safe in the room, called reception and they sent security up to check but he also could not find the Safe, I then asked to be move to a room with a safe and they said it was not possible to do a room swap, yet 10 mins before when I check-in the person at reception gave me a few room that I could choose from. I found the hotel to be very average considering it should be a 4 star hotel. They don't even offer free in room internet, yet I stayed at a 3 Star Holiday Inn in New York and they offer it.The only good thing I found was the GYM. Now I needed my final invoice and I have been trying for more then a week to get it. I cannot believe this sort of service from a Sheraton hotel. Due to teh fact that I went on business I cannot claim the stay back from my company was I have not recieved my invoice yet. Unbelievable. Will never stay there again.

<Title>“Pretty good for what I paid”
<Content>My wife and I stayed in the Marina Tower on Saturday November 20th. We thought it might not be too busy on the weekend before Thanksgiving but it was quite full. We got this hotel for a priceline bid of $65 and given the choice between the second floor or paying $20 for the top floor we opted for the top floor. The view of the bay and city skyline from our room was incredible. There was a storm passing that night and we got great pictures of the city with the changing weather. Being close to the airport we could hear the jets taking off but we brought a fan with us for white noise and had no trouble sleeping. The room was average sized and the bed was a bit firm but not overly so. The bathroom was clean and the only thing missing was a vent fan. The balcony had 2 chairs and a small table. Although I hate to pay for parking, from previous stays around downtown San Diego the $22/day fee was par for the course. The parking lots are off to the side of the main enterance and can get congested at times. The overflow parking is not paved and was a bit muddy during the storm. Overall it was a good value for what we paid. We only left the hotel to attend a football game at Qualcomm Stadium and had no trouble getting to and from I-5. With this in mind not being close to restaurants, shops, etc. was not a big issue; but, would prefer to stay in downtown within walking distance of the Gas Lamp Quarter otherwise.

<Title>“Just fine for the price”
<Content>We got a great deal on Hotwire for this hotel. We were in the Bay Tower, in a requested high up room with terrace facing the Bay and the Air Force Base, and to the left, the downtown skyline. The room colors were red, white and blue, in keeping with the Military base theme. Room was clean, beds comfortable. Front desk folks were pleasant and helpful. We walked to the Marina building for coffee, and in the opposite direction for a late night restaurant (cant recall the name) but there is not much else in walking distance. The weather was gorgeous and we loved being right on the bay. However, since nothing much is in walking distance, so if you want to be in downtown San Diego, or Coronado, you'er better off picking a place there. For us, the location was fine as we wanted to visit points both north(la Jolla) and South of the airport. Room was clean and roomy enough. Free internet in both lobby and business center--a big plus. There's nothing per se wrong with the hotel, but next timeI'd probably choose a different hotel in a more residential area, such as Coronado.

<Title>“Overall - a nice experience!”
<Content>We booked the hotel through Priceline and were a little nervous after reading these reviews, especially once we found out we would be staying at the dreaded Bay Tower. However, my wife and I had a wonderful time (even though it rained) and realize that some people will simply never be satisfied. Below is a breakdown of the pros and cons. Pros: •Beautiful lobby in Marina Tower •Excellent and helpful staff. Special Kudos to Scott and Bryan at Tapatini bar. We had a great conversation with them and they gave us some great advice on restaurant choices (don’t let this review add to your narcissism Scott  ) •Excellently maintained grounds. We didn’t mind the 5 minute walk from the bay to marina Towers and enjoyed “peeping” into the yachts in the harbor. •Fairly close to Gaslamp (but still need to drive or take a cab). •Comfortable bed! •Nice balcony – we were able to sit outside, watch the planes take off and land, and enjoy a bottle of wine. Cons: •Bathrooms in the Bay Tower are VERY small and have no exhaust fan. •Walls are thin and you can easily hear what is going on in hall and other rooms. •No free internet access in room…Really? It’s 2010. You can pay for access, so it’s available…but not free. How about joining the 21st Century Sheraton?? •The Harbor restaurant was WAY overpriced for the décor. Does anyone really want to pay $30+ for dinner and sit in a restaurant that looks like an outdated Long John Silver? Obviously not, I saw maybe 2 couples eating there the entire time. Overall, I would recommend the hotel although I would probably stay somewhere in Gaslamp for my next trip. Don’t buy the horrible reviews you see here – some people have impossible standards.

<Title>“Great experience!”
<Content>Our experience was wonderful. It was lovely, a relaxing and beautiful location as well as close to the airport. Everyone was accommodating and helpful. Our room was wonderful with a beautiful view. Without a doubt we would stay there again.

<Title>“Great Time”
<Content>From check-in to check-out we had a great time. The location on the marina was complemented by the perfect weather. We upgraded to Club, a good choice for us. The staff was particularly impressive. The room was a little small, but well appointed. We will be back.

<Title>“Great Location - Service Okay”
<Content>My husband and I stayed for 4 nights for a conference. It's extremely close to the airport and you can hear the jets. "Luckily" the air conditioner was loud enough to drown out the noise. Checking in was okay. The guy didn't know anything about our conference which was happening at the hotel and didn't offer to direct us to the concierge. They have an area with about 8 pc's & a printer in a livingroom type area. But if you want internet in your room it's going to cost you $9-15/day depending on which type you get. They also have a pc setup us for getting your airline boarding pass. Our room was pretty good. Not as clean as I hoped; I found a big long hair in the tub and the crevices of the bathrrom needed a thorough deep clean. The theme of the room is nautical. We had a nice view but had to haul our suitcase up 2 flights of stairs as there wasn't an elevator near our room. Strange, but I guess it's an older property. The bed wasn't all that comfortable for a Sheraton. We had a nice balcony with 2 chairs and a nice view of the marina. There was a flat screen and the cable had a good selection of channels including a nice selection of international news stations like the Russian news channel. We didn't eat breakfast in the restaurants and our conference was catered for lunch. Really nice catering job by the hotel. The food was really, really good and the staff was friendly & efficient. On our last day, after checking out we decided to have lunch at the hotel pub. It took freaking forever (like an hour!) for a salad and a sandwich! They said that the kitchen was really busy but it was 1pm and I'm sure it's busy everyday at lunch time. You'd think they would have scheduled more staff durring that time. We barely made it to our flight. They have 2 pools and a beautiful waterfall and fountains going into the main pool. They also have a pretty large hot tub. We didn't bring our suits and were pretty bummed that we couldn't go in. They have a fitness center but we didn't use it. The friendliest people at the hotel were the valet & catering staff. The location is pretty central. We saved money by just taking cabs as hotel parking is $18/day. For 5 days we spent about $150 on cabs. A one-way cab ride to downtown is about $15 with tip. They also have a free airport shuttle. Overall, I'd stay there again but I'd make sure we got a really good price.

<Title>“Excellent Customer Relations Response”
<Content>We booked with Priceline and were concerned that in consequence we might get shunted out to the Bay Tower. I emailed customer relations in advance and requested a specific room type. Received a pleasing response stating that the hotel would be happy to provide me with the requested room. Allocated a delightful room in the main building with beautiful views across the Marina. The room looked as if it had recently been refurbished. It was modern, spacious and clean. Restaurant was expensive but the food was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina even though the weather was terrible!

<Title>“Bay Tower Customer Service”
<Content>I and my son stayed in the tower one night. Nove 29-30 part of a wedding party.( I have a receipt.) My Rep. was Kory. Her attitude and disposition was terrible. I was sent to room 388, I opened the door, a man jump from the bed. I went back to Kory and told her there was a man in our room. Her answer was, you are the only one booked in that room. I am telling her there's a man there and she's insisting no one should be there. Our room #194 had no exhaust in the btroom and there was mold at the top of the shower. At check out I bought the issue up and was told about security, computer mix-up and such. Too much information. She never apologized. It seem the problem was my fault. Will never stay there again.

<Title>“Not a good experience”
<Content>We stayed for one night at this hotel and that was enough. From the start of our arrival the parking was a nightmare. Checking in was a bit long but quick when we finally got up to the counter. Our first room was on the 4th floor on the end over looking the jacuzzi. The room was large but that is all the goods things I have to say about it. There was a huge red stain on the carpet when we walked in. The people in the room next to us were so loud we could just about hear their whole conversation. I called the front desk and requested to be moved. They told us the hotel was sold out. So I decided to take a towel from the bathroom to close the gap under the door that adjoined the rooms. There was a huge black hair on the towel so once again I called and requested to be moved. They told us to come back to the front desk and they would have another room for us. Our second room was on the 3rd floor and we had a lovely view of the parking lot. The room was much smaller than our first. We immediately noticed there was black hair all over the bathroom floor. We had problems with the shower working correctly and had more water coming out the faucet than we did the shower head. It took a good 10 minutes for the shower to drain before the next person could shower. We were unable to find the TV remote, after calling the front desk it took them 30 minutes to bring us a new one at 1:30AM. To top things off a car alarm starting going off at 5AM. Needless to say this was the worst hotel experience. I booked the room through priceline which was the first mistake. They were not helpful in resolving the issues after we returned home and said there was nothing they could do. I've emailed the hotel and no response. I was given the name and number for Riquel and have called and left her 3 messages with no response. There are plenty of other hotels close to the San Diego Airport and I would caution you to stay here.

<Title>“This Sheraton hotel is awesome!”
<Content>My family and friends (9 of us total) stayed several days at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina located at 1380 Harbor Island Drive, San Diego, for our son's U.S. Marines Corps graduation at the MCRD. We were all extremely happy with the fabulous location of the hotel. The views of the marina from the hotel are spectacular! The hotel is extremely close to all the major San Diego tourist attractions and the airport, which makes it very easy to access. In addition, we were very impressed with Sheraton's excellent customer services, their extremely helpful concierge, and providing us with all the creature comforts you could find in an upscale 5 star hotel. Not to mention they have a Starbucks in-house - Totally Awesome! Two great restaurants, a super nice gym, an amazing spa, and so much more..... If you are going to stay in San Diego, be it just for fun or for serious business, the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina is the place to stay.

<Content>My wife and I spent a very wonderful weekend at the Sheraton Marina. The Staff was great and catered to our every need. The activity facilities were well kept and very accessable. At night we walked the grounds and took in the beauty of the city and the surrounding harbor. The dinning was pleasant and the food wonderful. Thank you Sheraton for providing such a great service and creating some cherished memories. Sincerely Yours, Hector Hernandez

<Title>“far from enchanting and a trap for folks without rental cars”
<Content>the hotel has two towers: the nice "marina" tower and the stepchild "bay" tower, a five minute walk between the two. the hotel is a cab ride from everything, poorly appointed and has minimal ammenities. twice, i've stayed here for a conference held in the marina tower. both times, I booked the conference tower and was - without any notice - moved to the bay tower. so I have to either hoof it to the marina tower or wait 15 minutes for a shuttle. not ideal and not what I reserved. customer service when I complained about the switch today I got a "we're sorry" and the manager tried to shift the blame to me for not booking with the conference block. no offer for free in-room internet or anything else. when I tried to order delivery for dinner, I found there was no directory of delivering restaurants and no phone book. I got a phone book and made some calls but no one delivered to this location. upon calling the front desk to request options, I was told to go online. (she assumed I was paying $12/day for in-room internet). when I explained I had no internet, she told me to come to the lobby and use their computer. really? ammenities 1 vending machine in the whole hotel, overpriced mini-bar or over-priced gift shop. you can't walk to anything so they have you at their mercy. "free wifi" in the lobby? yeah, but only an hour and you have to agree to pay for overtime when signing in. wifi in room? nope, but you can pay $12/day for wired service. bottom line if you've got a car, you might be fine here. if you're walking, you'll feel trapped and taken advantage of.

<Title>“excellent customer service”
<Content>I recently stayed at this hotel and have to say it was one of the nicest stays I've had in San Diego over my last 8 years of visiting there monthly on business. Ive stayed in a little nicer hotels but the customer service and staff far out weight the luxuries of a very select few I have visited. I cant say enough about the staff, managers, waiters, and bartenders at this hotel. Its hard to find a hotel staff who treat you like your on vacation as cater to your every need. Keep up the good work and ill be back soon and suggest you to all my traveling companions.

<Title>“Nice Stay... could be better”
<Content>My stay here was just fine. It was not great it was not horrible. I can say what I did not like most about this hotel was the fact that it does not have wireless in the room. What year is it? Seriously.... wireless should be standard in all business hotels. The room was fine... it was not bad, it was not amazing. The location, while has some great views... is so far away from the city. Its not within walking distance of anything... beyond the airport. The gym was really nice and the pool looked great. Would I stay here again... it all depends. If my event was at the hotel, I guess I would stay here again. Thus I say I would recommend this hotel. However, would I choose to stay here again, no.

<Content>We took our 3 yr old to San Diego the last week of June and stayed at this hotel. Hotel is adequately furnished. The hotel staff was excellent, always accommodating and helpful. We requested a refrigerator to store my son's milk, etc. It was promptly provided. A couple of months later the hotel charged my c/c for the fridge and removed it once I complained that a charge was never communicated to me. Very happy with their service.

<Title>“A very nice stay at Priceline prices”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton marina 10/2- 10/25 ( 4 nights). There are two properties on site- the Bay and the Marina towers. Both are nice, we stayed int eh Bay tower. I think those are the Priceline rooms. The room was Sheraton quality. The staff was great. all went well. There is a $22 per night parking charge though. So make sure you keep that in mind. The hotel is well situated near the airport, with an ongoing complementary airport shuttle service.

<Title>“Steer clear of this Hotel”
<Content>If you want a hotel that will nickel and dime you to death than this place is for you. $18 a day for in room internet access is robbery, hell Motel 6 offers free in room internet. Sure you can use their "Internet Lounge" in the lobby for free if you don't mind the lack of privacy when trying to conduct sensitive business matters. No in room refrigerator, oh sure they could bring me one for $15 a day; wow the operating cost might be all of .50 cents a day, what a joke. Let’s talk mini bar, I know only the truly desperate use these things but $4 for 4oz bag of pretzels, $24 for mini bottle of wine, really? If you bring a car they will be charging you $28 a day to park it there, insane. My room did have a nice view if you don't mind the sliding door rattling from who knows what all night. I fixed that with the notepad from the desk stuffed in between the sliders, nice. You may be wondering if I notified the staff, well no they probably would have wanted $ to look at it and the note pad was the only free thing in the room. When I made my reservation I requested a king bed (traveling with my wife) but when we got to the room it had 2 twins. I called the front desk to ask for room with a king and was told they are all booked but should have something the next day and they would call me to get me into a different room, needless to say I never got a call oh well probably would have wanted more money for that as well. I had a standard room where I got a conference rate of $200 a night (regular rate of the street is around $250) There is absolutely no way I would pay that if I was making the trip on my own dime. One last thing, if don’t mind taking a cab everywhere you go or taking the hotel shuttle to the airport to catch a city bus than you would be happy with the location because there is absolutely nothing within walking distance of this place. You’ve been warned.

<Title>“Excellent location!!!!”
<Content>I booked my stay through Priceline and have to admit that I was somewhat hesitant after reading other reviews. However, I found my stay in the Bay Tower at the San Diego Sheraton to be extremely pleasant. All staff members were friendly and helpful. I had a room in the Bay Tower looking out to the bay. The view from my balcony was incredible and the room was nice and the bed extremely comfortable. Steve in the Bay Tower Lounge was great as was Lucia who I saw each morning in the Bay Tower restaurant while I was having breakfast. Both these employees are definitely an asset to Sheraton. I would definitely stay at this hotel again when I visit San Diego on my next trip.

<Title>“Great Hotel with a great view!”
<Content>I spent two nights at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina, recently during the American Society of Anesthesiology conference. I didn't get to spend too much time at the hotel or in the room due to my commitment with the annual conference, but I do have to say that I was very pleased with my stay. I liked my room very much. It was very nice and comfortable. My view of the San Diego harbor was superb. It made me miss living in California. Also, it was a very easy and convenient shuttle ride to and from the hotel. On my last night, before leaving back to Miami, I stopped at the Tapatini bar inside the hotel's lobby. I met a very friendly and personable bartender by the name of Scott. I got to talking with him for a while and I was very impressed by his recommendations of appetizers, tapas and specialty martini's they offered. I really had no idea that they offered such delicious drinks and food at this fun and reasonably lively bar. Overall, I had a very pleasant stay there in San Diego at the Sheraton Marina.

<Title>“Ok stay, not ideal”
<Content>I booked this hotel through Priceline - - unfortunately it is considered part of “downtown and the gaslamp zone”- - (where I really wanted to stay). There are two towers to this hotel that are a block or so away.... we were placed in the Bay Tower which much lesser of a hotel and is NOT a FOUR star hotel. The hotel was ok - the rooms were fine but the hotel was more like a 3 or 3.5. There was no where to eat or get a drink, you had to walk or take a shuttle to the other tower. The swimming pool was a joke and very out dated. The coffee pot in our room was so disgusting - the inside was brown (where the water goes) and I tried to clean it but it was still nasty. I told the front desk and when we returned that night they had brought a brand new coffee pot. We had a harbor view and it was very nice, we got to see sailboats etc. It was relaxing. The room was fine and the bed was comfy. This hotel is a $15 cab ride from downtown / gaslamp which was a huge inconvenience for us. There is nothing to do and no where to eat or drink around this hotel so expect to drive or grab a cab to do anything. If you are looking for an ok hotel, with a comfy bed and nice view - this is for you. Otherwise, it is a bit of a let down and the star rating needs to be reviewed. Oh and they do have a shuttle from the airport to the hotel. We didn’t know and paid $10 for a cab.

<Title>“Had to contact the front desk three times before we were moved to a decent room.”
<Content>We booked a room here for our anniversary. We got it through priceline, which we've used before with great results. We were very disappointed with our room. It smelled like smoke, there were cigarettes on the porch, one of the paintings had been ripped off of the wall, the sheets were stained and it looked like the room hadn't been cleaned in a long time. I called the front desk and explained the situation. I was told the hotel was at capacity and they didn't have another room we could stay in. My husband and I sat in the nasty room for a while debating whether or not to stay there. We decided that we would rather stay somewhere else. I called again and was transferred to a department that wasn't even open that day and got a recording stating that I should leave a message. I was really mad at that point and called on last time before going to the front desk in person. Finally this woman helped us and magically found a decent room (what happened to being at capacity?). This fiasco wasted almost two hours of our time. The hotel is really outdated, the fitness room isn't great and the "spa" is a joke. There are much better hotels in town for about the same price. I wouldn't stay at this Sheraton ever again.

<Title>“Very pleasant stay”
<Content>Stayed in the Marina Tower [more convenient, in my opinion, to the hotel's services, including its airport shuttle, than the Bay Tower] for 2 nights 10/15/10 and 10/16/10; beautiful views of Downtown from the small but adequate balcony. Room was clean and had all the amenities needed, but not luxurious. Common areas of the hotel are nicely decorated, and the staff at check-in was quite cheerful. One plus is the free airport shuttle, which one can use to connect with Metro bus 992 to get downtown. One note: since the hotel is isolated on a small spit of land [the marina], there are no restaurants within walking distance, which the Sheraton's restaurants capitalize on [high prices], so expect to pay $16 for a hamburger or $38 for an ala carte strip steak.

<Title>“Great Hotel, Great Amenities, Great Location and the Best Customer Service Ever!”
<Content>From the moment I called for reservations, I felt like the staff were good friends . They strived to please us, and demonstrated above and beyond customer service. Our guest service agent, Roseann Schaefer, listened to my requests and needs for accomodations due to a recent illness and major surgery. She is awesome, and the best guest service agent we ever talked with ever! I will come back to this hotel just because of her! That's how great she was to us! She upgraded our room and had a fruit plate delivered to us upon check in! Every employee we encountered during our stay was so friendly and helpful. The concierge happily answered questions and offered to arrange for rental car, provide tickets to attractions at a discounted price. We have never encountered such excellent customer service at any other hotel ever, and we frequently travel! Way to go, Sheraton! The fitness center is a dream come true, with top notch new, smooth Life Fitness machines. This is our fav hotel in San Diego, and we will return again and again. Thank you, Sheraton, for a wonderful stay, beautiful views, comfy accomodations, super staff and great location! Don't miss the all the yacht lights reflecting on the water at night! Stunning view from the balcony at night in the Marina Tower. We're already planning another trip here! Hint--request the Marina Tower with views of the bay and marina. Views are great!

<Title>“Complete failure!”
<Content>I laugh as I write this because this place is such a joke! First off the rooms look like Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren got together, had a demon spawn baby, then that baby designed a hotel. Kitsch all the way. I understand it's by a marina, but do I have to feel like I'm on a boat too? We confirmed a king room, but were placed in a two double room. When confronted about this they apologized in the most unaffected way and said that they were sold out, but we could move tomorrow. Really? Not acceptable. We asked for our room to be made up. There was a maid 2 doors down. 2.5 hours, 2 calls, a chat with the manager on duty and another 30 minutes and it was FINALLY cleaned. Again, unaffected apology. As SPG Platinum members we were neither recognized as such, nor given any of the required benefits associated with our status until the SPG Platinum Concierge called the hotel. Then we had to have our keys remade so that we had access to the club level lounge which should have been done to begin with. Internet is wired and only available at the desk which was slightly annoying. Overall, terrible experience. Stay down the road at the Hilton. I'm sure it's MUCH better. Meanwhile, word to the hotel: Learn how to treat your top tier guests, as well as your corporate guests who bring you quite a bit of revenue. Also, for the love of God, hire a decorator. Your hotel looks ridiculous.

<Content>We were visiting our son in SanDiego and chose to stay at this hotel. The great service started with Lauren the consierge who helped us get the rental that we wanted. It seems that the rental agency we went with didn't have the car we reserved. Lauren was terrific in getting us a car. The second person that made our stay awesome was Julia at the front desk , our stay was actually in two parts and she booked the second part (with upgrade) for us. These two were the most helpful. We definately will be staying at this hotel again!!!

<Title>“The Marina breeze is energizing and the view is beautiful as you enjoy a wonderfully tasty breakfast!”
<Content>Our townhouse room over looking the ocean a big plus, well maintained and clean hotel. The Marina breeze is energizing and the view is beautiful as you enjoy a wonderfully tasty breakfast the Sheraton offers for $19 per person. It’s a great place to go for a central location near beaches, downtown nightlife and the airport for commuting. I love to go there very relaxing! It's incredible the unique variety in resturants to fit any size budget.

<Title>“Pleasant Stay”
<Content>We had a very nice stay at this hotel. The staff was super friendly and the accomidations comfortable. Exactly what I expected. Excellent location, our room had a fantastic view of the marina. Super close to the airport, yet extremely quiet. Excellent amenities (pool, restaurant, full Starbucks & FedEx/Kinko locations in the lobby).

<Title>“Great view and the room was nice too!”
<Content>The room was clean and very comfortable. We got two rooms. One was overlooking the marina and one overlooked the ocean. We couldn't decide which view was better. We had a couple minor issues with the staff at the front desk so we only rated the staff a 3 out of 5. Also the parking was more expensive than we expected for the area (not a downtown hotel). We would stay at the hotel again.

<Title>“Nice hotel but.......”
<Content>We spent two nights prior to boarding our cruise ship. We liked our room very much. The view of the harbor was great. We saw our cruise ship dock the day we boarded. The reason for our visit to San Diego was to visit the Zoo. We had been there years ago but couldn't wait to see it again. The zoo didn't disappoint. The only down side was the cab ride back to the hotel. Our driver took a number of back streets adding more than $7 to the fare compared to the cab ride to the zoo. When we arrived at the hotel I wrote down the drivers name and license number. At this point the driver became very apologetic and said we didn't need to pay for the ride. I paid him what we had paid for the morning cab ride minus the tip. I reported his name and number to the hotel. Bottom line, watch the cab drivers in San Diego.

<Title>“The best of the best!”
<Content>SERVICE, SERVICE, SERVICE!!! Did I mention the service? This was my first stay at the Sheraton, and it will not be my last. I simply will not stay anywhere else in San Diego. There was a problem with my reservation, and Brian at the front desk had it fixed within two minutes! The staff was amazingly attentive, yet not intrusive. I have found the balance between the two is a very thin line. The Sheraton staff walks it beautifully! If you have an opportunity to stay, I highly recommend the Bay tower with a bay view! My wife accompanied me on this trip and we thoroughly enjoyed having coffee on the balcony and watching the sailboats run in the bay. GORGEOUS!!! We have found that most hotels have hard bedding that makes for rough sleeping. Not the Sheraton. My wife and I found the bed to be surprisingly comfortable. The mattress was soft, with plenty of support. I can sum it up by stating: Stay here, you will not be disappointed!

<Title>“Nice hotel, expensive parking fees”
<Content>This is a good hotel with nice and updated rooms, great view and good swimming pool. There are 2 major problems with this hotel. There's nothing you can do walking, so if you plan to drink some wine and have dinner in town you would have to take a cab. The 2 nd problem if you're driving are parking fees 22 for self parking and 28 for vallet. If you think you did a good deal, wait for the bill after you check out.

<Title>“Lovely stay, but be careful about room location.”
<Content>This hotel was chosen for me when I attended a conference in San Diego. It is very near the airport with a quick, free shuttle, and very courteous drivers both to and from the airport. I had to FedEx 2 important packages of conference materials to the hotel in advance. I was initially told that the package room closed at 4:30 PM, and since I was not arriving until late in the evening before the conference, I was worried about not being able to pick up the packages. I called ahead to make sure they would be available and Guest Services and the bellmen had everything waiting when I arrived. The hotel is located away from the main tourist areas and most restaurants, so you need a rental car or taxi (always available) to go most places. I tend to like the locations near the downtown or Convention Center, so there are places to walk to after my meetings. Lots of scenic places for jogging or walking near the water, though. There are 3 different locations for rooms within the same hotel property. The main tower attached to the lobby, the Bay Tower which is reached by a shuttle or a considerable walk, or the Lanai which is somewhat attached to the main hotel, but still a considerable walk. My room was in the Lanai and I was given a complex map to find it. I was offered the services of a bellman to help with my luggage, but had no idea how complicated it would be to find the room Not only that, but when I did find the Lanai, it was raining (unusual for San Diego) and all the rooms opened directly to the outside, the only elevator was miles away, and I trudged up the steps with all my luggage.to the top floor which was completely open to the rain. Every time I had to go to the Starbucks, restaurant, or free internet in the lobby, I was right out in the rain which lasted for 3 days. The room itself was fine, but I have no idea what the Tower rooms were like, very clean with comfortable beds and big desk. The TV had the 3 major networks and a few cable stations (limited). The view of the marina was beautiful. There was a very loud air conditioner in the wall of the room which you could turn either on or off, but not set a temp. so that it would go on or off. When you turn on the bathroom light, a loud fan automatically went on. So, all in all, it was loud. They have a rainfall shower, which some people like, and had a little bit harder setting, but it took forever to rinse out shampoo. Nonetheless, the hotel was very nice. Everyone was extremely courteous, and except for the check-in person who could have assigned a better location, very helpful with any request. I wound up ordering salads or sandwiches to take up to my room for several meals at Quinn's which is the bar and has a great menu. Their marinated skirt steak is delicious. I think the food all comes from a central kitchen, but did not try their main restaurant. The Starbuck's in the lobby is good, opens about 5:30 AM (I think) but closes at about 5:30 PM. The gift shop stays open until 11:00 PM, so no problem there. The Fitness Center is open with a key 24 hours and very well stocked with equipment. There are several beautiful pools and a large hot tub. There are 5 free computers in the lobby with a printer, but a charge to connect in your room.

<Title>“Was not as reserved, it was just, ok.”
<Content>We reserved our room at the Sheraton San Diego hotel, at the Marina address. This was the better of the two towers. When we gave the taxi driver the address and he took us to the Marina Tower, the bellman redireced us the the older, and being worked on tower. We found out later that there was a teachers convention in town and they had changed our reservation without our consent to the older tower. The old bait and switch routine. The pool was closed for renivation and the front of the Hotel was being painted and sand blasted. We thought we booked a 4 star hotel, I would rate the tower we stayed in a 2.5 star at best. We started to call price line and complain, but I don' t think this was Priceline's fault. We hold the Hotel responsible for changing our reservation to the lower price spread.

<Content>I stayed here for one night in September for business. Excellent service at check-in and for help with directions and overview of local restaurants. Room was very clean, large and had a good view of the bay. The airport is very close by but I did not hear any aircraft noise in my room. I would stay here again.

<Title>“Perfect Location”
<Content>I recently stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina with my Sister and some Family Members attending a wedding in the area. I never take the time to write reviews but this Hotel is worthy of my time. The location is great, just minutes from the Airport. I don't think you can get a bad view from your room. You either overlook the Marina or the Bay with commanding views of the city. I had to be pulled from my balcony each morning. The Staff could not have been more accomodating. If you are planning a trip to San Diego, this is the place to stay.

<Title>“Not a value for a money definitely”
<Content>I stayed in this hotel for about a week and I rate it as poor because of a service. I mean rooms are nice and clean, hotel has a pool and fitness center (I did not try those), but…I had number of issues with a service. Firstly you will be required to pay for every single service you get – no free Internet (it costs almost 20$ a day! Crazy), no free breakfast and even I had to pay for my package handling! For a hotel that costs 200$ a day that is NOT acceptable. Also during a check out I had some objections on invoice I got. I was told that they will sort it out and let me know on email. Guess what – they charged me anyway without giving any information! This is not a 5* hotel service. It is a money printing machine.

<Title>“Ignored!”
<Content>This hotel has ignored all of our attempts to contact them via telephone and email regarding the missing items from our room. The morning of our checkout I was packing the suitcases for our flight and noticed that our big shopping bag of clothes and souvenirs was missing. Nothing else was touched in the room and I quickly deduced that housekeeping could have picked it up thinking it was garbage. I immediately called the front desk in horror thinking it had gone to the dumpster and perhaps they could retrieve it before the inevitable. The front desk person was very defensive of the housekeeping staff and told me in a surly tone that this was a matter of security and that I shouldn't assume anything. Security came to the door and took all of our information citing they would begin an investigation and that they needed to review all the risk management strategies or something to that effect. I told them what I thought about it being a possible mistake by housekeeping given he fact that there was also packaging material from my now sobbing 8 year old son's souvenirs in the bag as well. I asked them to please go and check the garbage, but the gentleman just pursed his lips and gave me a blank expression that I could only deduce was that it "ain't gonna happen." They left the room and promised to call us and give us an update on the following Monday. After my phone calls (that magically go to voicemail) and email, it has been a month and there has been absolutely no response or contact. I am extremely disappointed with this lack of response. Shame on you Sheraton for such poor service (no service) after an emotionally upsetting violation of trust and promises. drsean Victoria BC

<Title>“We enjoyed our brief visit”
<Content>After an 8 hour travel day (3 hours to Houston, a 2 hour layover and a 3 hour flight to San Diego), we were pleased when we discovered that the hotel where we would stay one night was right across the street from the car rental, so we didn't have to worry about finding our hotel. It's a big place (over 1000 rooms) right on Harbor Bay Island. We were told upon check-in that they didn't have a room for us at that location but that we were set at the Sheraton Tower which was literally right around the corner, We drove there and were greeted in a most friendly manner. We found out, to our unhappy surprise, that self-parking was $22 per night and valet parking was $28 per night. The hotel lobby was quite nice and the woman at the front desk was efficient. She apologized for not being able to give us a room with a view of the bay side but that we would be on the marina side. We had our bags brought to our room and the bellboy was extremely helpful and friendly, giving us several suggestions of things to see and places to eat. We found the room quite large and comfortable with a nice view of the marina, which we didn't mind one bit. We had a comfortable night's sleep and a buffet breakfast at the hotel restaurant that we thought was very good but expensive. Checkout was easy. Overall, we had a pleasant visit and would not hesitate to stay there again.

<Title>“Okay but could be better”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton for a conference. The hotel lobby is lovely and the view of the marina is very nice. For the most part the food at the hotel was good and there is a Starbucks right in the lobby. The service was good. However, the room and the bathroom are tiny. Upon arrival I noticed that the towels in my room were dirty so I asked for a new set. The new set had old stained spots on 2 out of the 4 towels brought. The faucet in the bathroom had some sort of a problem because there was only hot water or cold water but you could not adjust for warm. The hotel is far away from pretty much everything. We walked around for about a mile and couldn't find even a convenience store. The hotel parking price is obscene ($22 per night) and parking is not easy to find in the lot.

<Title>“Pleasant hotel, good facilities but a bit of a hike from downtown...”
<Content>Some great aspects of this hotel, free computer and print facilities in the lobby, on site starbucks and a relaxed friendly atmoshere. As you would expect everything was nice and clean. As some of the other reviews say, this hotel is a bit out of town, we walked it a few times and it took approx 45 minutes to walk. Typically, we walked out for dinner downtown and got a taxi back to the hotel (approx $15). If there was a regular bus service available, i would have marked the hotel as a 4, as the location does limit your options. This would be fine if staying for a couple of days or only for a conference, but on holiday you want to get out and about as much as possible!

<Title>“Pleasantly surprised”
<Content>We booked the Sheraton through Hotwire. After discovering our mystery hotel, we looked up the reviews on Trip Advisor, and had some concerns... However, I have to say we enjoyed our 3 night stay. + Our requested crib was delivered to our room before we arrived at the room. Granted, we checked in @ the Marina Tower and had to drive over... + Our toddler was able to watch airplanes and the SeaWorld fireworks show from her crib. This was definitely a unique experience. Our room faced north in the Bay Tower. The windows are floor to ceiling. + The pool has towels - it's in a big wooden box. + Close to the attractions we visited (SeaWorld, San Diego Zoo, Coronado) but you do need a car. It's next to the airport, and I didn't see any restaurants you can leisurely walk to. +/- In room internet is rather expensive, but there is free Wifi in the lobby. Also a big plus is that there is a guest PC for use in the lobby with a printer. - The check-in process was confusing... We parked and checked in @ the Mission Tower, which is the first Sheraton you see from the airport. We were re-directed to to the Bay Tower... had to repark. - Parking is expensive ($22/night)

Seafood chowder w/ glass of reisling at Bay Tower restaurant impeccable!Carlos @ the poolside bar @ the marina tower makes the best bloody marys ever!!!!Food there was fantastic. It's San Diego people, it's gonna be expensive, but the brunch @ the marina was superb and the hash browns I had w/ the eggs benedict off the regular menu were the best I've ever had. Even the snacks ordered from the poolside menu @ the Marina Tower were delicious and plentiful. You definitely get your moneys worth.Staff always gracious and accomodating. Liked it better than the W Hotel downtown. Thanks Sheraton for your outstanding performance. You helped to make our vacation Wonderful!!!! DH is a gold spg member but i would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to enjoy their San Diego experience.Location? we had a rental car which made it quite easy to get around sightseeing. It's pretty easy to find a good deal online.

<Title>“The service was 4 star and the view from our Marina Tower terrace was beautiful”
<Content>My husband,myself and fifteen year old son spent 3 nights and had a great stay. All the staff were very friendly and accomodating. The valet staff always gave us perfect directions, the desk staff and the restaurant/bar staff were also very attentive.The hotel is very clean and has just had a renovation. Rooms are very clean and housekeeping service was very conscientious.The pool is very relaxing and has a bar/resaturant outside. There was a good mix of family and business clientele. We stayed at Marina Tower because it was closer to restaurants/pool. The Bay tower has larger rooms but is a 5 min walk along the harbor and is quieter.The entire hotel has a resort feeling to it and is a very relaxing atmosphere. There are a lot of paths to take scenic walks/jogs around the Marina and Harboutr Island.Even though hotel is 5 min from airport we were never bothered by planes overhead. The hotel is a 10-15 min drive to Gaslight/Balboa Park and Zoo area. We were very happy that we stayed on Harbour Island instead of downtown San Diego hotel as we really felt like we were at a resort ans could still get into town easily. This is one of th the best values I have ever had at a hotel and would highly recommend it.

<Content>Went for a conference which was fine, but as far as doing anything else.... stay elsewhere. It's a taxi ride or bus ride to go anywhere interesting. There's nothing to eat there but barely adequate food from overpriced restaurants with surly staff. We took the hotel shuttle and 2 busses to get downtown and then took the train to get to old town... it just takes too long to get anywhere if you don't have your own vehicle. The hotel gets a "C+", the restaurants and location get an "F"

<Title>“Had a Great Time!”
<Content>Stayed here for two nights, on August 20-22. I booked it thru Priceline and I was a bit skeptical once I learned it was this hotel. It was probably my last choice. Thankfully, I had been reading reviews here on TripAdvisor. I called a few days beforehand to request that I be put into the Marina Tower. When we arrived at the airport, we waited for at least 35 minutes for the airport shuttle to arrive. (Even though when I called the hotel, they said it runs every 15-20 minutes. I don’t know why it took so long, considering I could see the hotel from where we were standing. LOL! Finally, we board the shuttle and the guy tells us that we’re staying in the Bay Tower. (Argghh!!) I’m scared at this point. Hahah! We get in line to check in and I ask if there was anyway to switch us over to the Marina Tower. The woman, whose name was “Anika” (I think) tells us that we’re very lucky and says that she’s able to get us to the other tower, on the TOP floor. Score!!! She was very sweet and kind. Other than the airport shuttle running a little behind, I have no other complaints!! I’d gladly stay here again.

<Content>Stayed five nights and thought this was a great place (Bayside); enjoying the views of the water and airport. Very convenient to airport and only 10 minutes via cab to the downtown area (although we had a car and also traveled to other locations, with easy access to the freeway). The business center was good and internet generally reliable. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. As for the business meeting, the staff and service was outstanding (easy to eat too much because of the great quality and variety of choices).

<Title>“Wonderful!”
<Content>I spent two nights at the Bay Tower (purcheased through Priceline), Aug.20-22, and was pleasantly surprised! First, I must comment on the level of service all around. From front dest and room service to shuttle and valet, the Sheraton staff was wonderful! Kudos to everyone working Bay Tower that weekend! The hotel is conveniently located near the airport, and pretty close to downtown (about a $12.00 cab fare), yet the setting by the marina and bay give one the feeling of being in a private oasis. I had a sixth floor room with a view of the harbor (and airport) and despite the fact I could see planes taking off, it felt very peaceful. Saturday night I was even able to watch the fireworks at Seaworld from my (nice sized) balcony! The room itself was spacious, comfortable and very clean. The only negative remark I could make is that the size of the bathroom was a little small, not that of a four star hotel. Both mornings I used room service for breakfast and the meals were great, delivered timely and fresh. Coffee in the room is Starbucks and delicous and super easy to make. Directly across the street from the hotel is a walking path along the bay. It's lovely and is a great place to unwind and watch the boats and take in a terrific view of the San Diego skyline. I also walked over to the Marina building checked out the lobby, pool, grabbed an ice tea at the Starbucks and sat on a veranda there for a bit - very pleasant! I would absolutely stay at this property again and hope to return soon!

<Content>The hotel is very beautiful and the level of service is almost quite exceptional! From the doorman to the housekeepers to all the staff I interacted with, everyone of them was absolutely delightful and happy to serve us! Great Hotel, great pool, view is fantastic and location perfect! The bay is amazing! The only negative thing I would say is that the service at the pool could be better, the waiters and waitress are not on top of things! No one at the stand where you get your towels and can buy sun screen for more than 3 hours in a blue shy sunny day! 25 minutes to get a drink which never came so I had to go to the bar get it myself! The pool is great though. Other than that special area, everything was just fantastic!!!

<Content>This was my first stay at this hotel, and I was thoroughly impressed. As a member of the hospitality industry, this hotel practices daily what we all strive to be. Friendly staff, all the amenities you need (except Wireless internet), amazing views, great food, flawless business event, and set in one of the best locations on earth. Kudos to the entire Sheraton San Diego team.

<Title>“Good location, pricey parking, nice hotel bar, good pool, decent service.”
<Content>Reading the reviews here before going scared me a lot since we had booked a room for four days using priceline. The pickup from the airport was smooth and sure enough we were put in the bay tower which I had heard was worse than the marina tower. We had several air crew in the shuttle with us and they were directed to the marina tower so we felt a natural discrimination towards us the priceline customers. oh well. The bay tower was not bad surprisingly enough. It was a very pleasant less than 5 minute walk from the marina to the bay tower and our room was on the 10th floor with a nice view of the marina. Seriously, sitting outside on the balcony in the morning and drinking my coffee was a nice start to the day. We did not interact with the staff much other than to call them to get the times of the shuttle which they were always happy to give. This brings me to the transportation part of the review. Parking fees were 22 bucks a day! But this is easily discernible well in advance and anyone with a modicum of sense would do their research before going. We did a decent workaround - rented from hertz every day in the morning and returned in the evening. It cost us $10 more every day because of the $10 fee per rental but you are saving about $12 a day for the parking so in total a win. The shuttles from the hotel drop you to the airport and then you can take the car shuttle from there to the car lot. Summary: great location (everything in san diego we saw was close by), good transportation to the hotel, worth the money from priceline bid.

<Title>“Amazing bay and marina views!”
<Content>We arrived at San Diego airport at 22:30 and I was concerned that checking-in at this time would be a problem, but it turned out to be a breeze at Sheraton. The hotel is a 5 minute taxi drive from the airport - perfect if you have an early flight to catch. My partner and I were greeted by very friendly staff who upgraded our room upon check-in. Our room was in the Bay Tower, which is only a scenic few minutes walk along the marina from the hotel's main building, the Marina Tower. We were on the eighth floor and had the most beautiful view of the bay. I'd consider going back for the view alone! We stayed for four nights. Unfortunately breakfast was not included in our rate and the room service menu in our room didn't exactly offer the most tempting prices, so we didn't experience any of the food on offer. We did however make the most of the Starbucks located in the Marina Tower - a great way to start the day. The main purpose of our trip was San Diego Comic Con. Regular free shuttle buses operated throughout the event, stopping outside both towers and taking us right up to the Convention Center. This hotel is perfect for anyone going to the convention who doesn't want to pay the high rates of the Gaslamp hotels, but also doesn't want getting there to be a hassle.

<Content>We really enjoyed our visit to San Diego and the stay her at the Sheraton. The views were great and the walks along the waterfront with our dogs was beautful. The pet friendly policy of the hotel was what we really liked as we take our dogs with us on our outings. Everything about the hotel was excellent

<Title>“Good Location, Bad Parking”
<Content>Got a great deal on this hotel $89/night after the hotel agreed to beat the price located on Orbitz.com. Hotel was conveniently located near San Diego airport and a quick drive to downtown, Point Loma and Old Town. Hotel located along harbor and there is a nice walking path which my toddler loved strolling on and looking at the boats. Room was cozy buy clean and had a nautical theme. Had a great computer center. I hate paying for parking and self parking at this hotel was more than $20/night. This was only palatable to me because I got a great rate for the room. Despite paying an arm and a leg for parking the self parking was not convenient. Returned late one night and the only available parking was quite a walk from the hotel entrance. Overall a good hotel except for the parking rates.

<Title>“Great Views of the Bay and the City”
<Content>At first I was disappointed to be so close to the airport and not within walking distance to downtown. However, it really is a lovely hotel (nautical theme throughout) and kind of away from the hustle and bustle. The views are incredible. A few restaurants are within walking distance which is convenient as well. This would get an even higher rating if they provided a shuttle to downtown!!

<Title>“Great place!”
<Content>Had an awesome overnight stay! The rooms are spacious, staff is rushed but friendly and accommodating. I think most rooms have BEAUTFUL views of the marina plus balconies. Although it is near the airport, it does not feel that way at all. Location: Close to airport but only a 5 minute drive to downtown, not bad at all. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when traveling back to San Diego. The executive management staff is SUPERB and very customer service oriented. Club rooms are special as they have additional amenities, however, the evening service is not around on Fridays...only for breakfast, which I found slightly odd. All in all, a very pleasant experience and worth getting a rez here!!

<Title>“Great unless you have a young family! Especially at Quin's restaurant.”
<Content>Had the worst experience at Quinn’s restaurant in the Sharaton in San Diego Harbor last night. I asked the waitress if she could please have a table bussed so that my family could sit down. She said it would be several minutes and if I wanted to wait I could but did not know when it would be done. Since it was my first time in the restaurant and first time in the hotel I asked how I go about to reserve the table (put my name in the front, with her, etc.) and she said to stand by the table until she had the time to clear it off. The table by the way was a complete mess, not so much with the dishes from the previous guest, but with her towels, serving tray, and cleaner. She bussed the table and my family and I sat down. After we sat down a booth became available and my wife asked if I could get it for us since our 2 year old would be easier if he was between the two of us inside a booth. The waitress quickly came over to me and told me that table was reserved for another guest that had been waiting. As I was confused because she had told me that for me and my family to get a table we would have to stand by it, I asked her why she would hold another table for a guest and make me stand by a table. The other guest came to the table that had been told by the waitress that she would hold it and created a very uncomfortable situation for them and I. I went back to my table to let my wife know the bad news and when the waitress went by, I asked for clarification from the waitress. She said that they had been waiting for the table and I said I understood but why did she make me stand by a table while she took their name, she looked at me, looked at my kids, rolled her eyes, flipped her hair, and walked away. I never received clarification, an apology, or even acknowledgment, and she had someone else wait on us in her station area so she would not have to deal with us. It makes me wonder why a young family would receive different treatment as my money, tips, opinions, and access to the internet to voice it are just as good as anyone else’s. It took over an hour to get our food while people who came in after us were getting fed. When asked turned out that they were holding the kids food until my ribs were done, Honestly, with two small children starting to loose it from lack of food common sense says bring it out. The food was overpriced and the kids pizza was cold. The hotel charged us for items out of the mini bar fridge automatically because the left over pizza we put in the fridge blocked the sensor for an item. The line to check out was over an hour to clear up the bill. The view was great and if you did not have kids could be a very romantic place to stay, DO NOT STAY HERE WITH KIDS. THEY TREAT YOU AS IF YOU HAVE A DISEASE!

<Title>“It is ok, don't stay in the back hotel”
<Content>This hotel is right near the airport but planes are not bothersome. There are two hotels, the bay and the marina. We were stuck in the back hotel. You have to walk 5 minutes outside to get to the other hotel. Fine in the daytime, not well lighted at night. I would not want to be a female walking alone here at night. The front hotel seems to have all of the staff. I saw two people working at the front desk at the back hotel in the two nights we were there. Not one other employee anywhere. Parking is a challenge. Not much of it, spaces are very small. Balconies are nice - we had someone empty what we think was a cooler over there balcony onto ours. Everything was wet, out table/chairs, window, patio. Called to let security know - no one came up. Front Desk took some money off for the inconvience. We used the pool in the front hotel. No towels anywhere. Finally found some in the fitness area. The whole pool area had used towels everywhere.

<Title>“Bay Tower - NOT a 4 star hotel”
<Content>I booked the Sheraton Harbor Island through Priceline for under $80 per night. Having read all of the negative reviews on here beforehand, I was very disappointed to find out we were booked into the Bay Tower, but thought I would give it a fair chance. The Bay Tower is, at most, a 1/4 mile away from the Marina Tower. Bay Tower has its own separate lobby. For all intensive purposes, they are 2 completely separate hotels that simply share the Sheraton name. For Priceline to allow the Bay Tower to be booked as a 4-star hotel is disappointing and frustrating. I'm sure there are different qualifications for what makes 4-star vs 3-star vs 2-star, etc. But for me, a 4-star hotel should make you think things like, "This is nice", or "This goes above & beyond a normal hotel", or basically, "Wow, this is fancy!" Sheraton Harbor Island Bay Tower sadly did none of those things. The Marina Tower, from what I saw, appeared to be a nice, newer, sleek-looking closer-to-4-star hotel. It's a 5-10 minute walk from the Bay Tower. The Starbucks in the Marina Tower is quite nice, and therefore very busy. If you choose the hotel's Green Option (of declining daily maid service), you will get a $5 coupon under your door each night, which can be used at Starbucks. So that was nice since it pretty much paid for a drink each morning. The living space in the room was average. Since it's literally across the street from the Bay, it had a nice balcony that looked out onto the Bay. The Bay-View has ships & military boats go by, vs. the Marina-View, which just has boats parked there. However, if you pick the Bay-View, there always seemed to be a lot of loading/unloading/work going on in the mornings since the loading docks are on the first floor, directly under the balconies. This causes a lot of noise (ie, not very relaxing), especially if you're on the lower floors Bay-view side. The room's decor itself was ok, nothing fancy at all. The couch looked quite worn. The bed was firm, bordering on hard. Pillows were very thin, even when double folded. The clock radio was cheap, as in $10 Radio Shack cheap. No iPod or auxiliary connection that I would expect a 4-star hotel to have. The bathroom really showed the age of the room. The wallpaper was borderline gross in places and should really be replaced straight away. The shower was weak in terms of pressure - it could not shoot to the back wall. But it did stay hot for a long shower. The towels were your basic white hotel standard-issue ones; i.e., the ones that are barely long enough to wrap around my 36-inch waist. I have nicer towels than this at home! And only one towel hook/hanger in the bathroom. The TV was pathetic. A 4-star hotel should not have an old 27" old CRT TV. This was the TV my brother had in high-school in the mid-90's. Also, our TV had an annoying habit, when the balcony doors were open, of switching itself back to the Hotel Menu channel randomly every couple minutes. The problem went away when the balcony doors were shut. Very odd. There is a $22 per night parking charge to park in the lot in front of the hotel. I wasn't that upset about the fee since most hotels - and everywhere else - in San Diego charge you for parking if you're anywhere near the water. I think it's fair to say that you really need a car if you're going to stay here for any extended period of time. Taxi charges will add up quickly. Because for the most part, you're really in the middle of nowhere in terms of shopping/places to walk to. There is a Fresh & Easy about 5+ miles away in Point Loma, but alas, there is no refrigerator in the room. On to the positives - the view obviously is great on the Bay side. The gym area downstairs was free to use. Again, dated machines but free is nice and unheard of at most hotels. The employees were all very nice and helpful. There is free wi-fi in the lobby. There is also a "business center" with 3 computers and a printer that are free to use. The room itself though feels outdated and not very professional at all for a "business center", but again, at least it was free to use. All in all, the Sheraton Bay Tower felt like a hotel from the Hotel Circle that had simply been placed in Harbor Island. It felt much more like a 2- or 3-star hotel. Nothing left me saying "Wow this is fancy". Even having paid a discounted rate, I still felt disappointed about the hotel experience. I would not stay there again.

<Title>“The Missing Teddy Bear Comes Home”
<Content>What a wonderful stay. I wish we could have had more time to enjoy the hotel. My family which consists of my husband, two teenagers and a 10 yr old had a blast during the week of Comic-Con. Check-in was speedy and seamless. Check-out was just as well handled. We had found a discrepency on the bill and the counter check-out staff fixed it right away. We were given a spacious room for the 5 of us but one of the teenagers had to sleep on the floor anyway. The cleaning staff was gracious enough to make sure he had clean linen every day and we had plenty of coffee and towels for all of us. The best thing of all was getting my youngest childs Teddy Bear Back. Apparently the bear had been covered up in the bedding and inadvertently left behind. We didn't notice until we were several hours away. My child was beside himself. He said with huge allegator tears running down his face, "Mommy I need Henry. He keeps the bads dreams away". As you can probably guess I felt his absolute vulnerability and terror at that moment in time. The realization that for the first time in 9 yrs he would not have Henry to fall asleep with. I called the hotel and the security staff put housekeeping on the alert right away. We didn't hear anything for a day. I called the next day. Still no Henry but assurances were given that people were looking for the bear and someone would call me as soon as it was found. Day 2 we get a call. Henry had been located. Housekeeping had washed the bear and was waiting for a trip home. The next day the manager FedEx'd the missing companion to Oregon. We received Henry 3 days later. Clean and well travelled, into the very happy waiting arms of his life long companion. My son learned a valuable lession during those "Henry-less" days. #1 He could sleep nightmare free without Henry. #2 Never forget to look in the blankets at a hotel before declaring "I'm all packed lets go" and #3 It was sure good to get Henry home. Thank you to the unnamed manager that sent our Henry-The Teddy Bear Home.

<Title>“Motel?”
<Content>When I book a 4 star hotel and above I don't expect to stay in a motel... well at least that's what it felt like. My number one rule is.. I cannot drive up to my front door. Well it was exactly that! I'm checking in thinking when they gave me room #5*** I'm getting a room on the 5th floor or something...NO! I had to drive around to the back to some rooms that were attached to the hotel that looked like it was an old run down motel. The room was so musty and icky and when I complained they said that's all they had. We got there after driving in from Anaheim and spending a day at the zoo and was just too exhausted to find another hotel. And are you serious... $22/day to park your own car too? Sheraton, you have disappointed me!

<Title>“Fabulous Time at the Sheraton!”
<Content>My husband, 11 year old son and I had a wonderful time at the Sheraton San Diego Harbor and Marina. The staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful. The location is very convenient to the airport and right on the water. We were able to rent a jetski right at the hotel. The view of downtown San Diego at night from our balcony was amazing. Great pool, tennis courts, fitness center, pool table, ping pong table-lots to do for kids and adults both! We will definately stay at this hotel again next time we are in San Diego!

<Title>“Hotel fine once there. Reservation process sucked”
<Content>We traveled to stay at this hotel as part of a baseball tournament where this hotel was one of the host hotels and we were required to stay there. Once there, the hotel was fairly decent except for the "car alarms" that go off on a nightly basis. Not sure why that is but, we suspect the proximity of the naval base? Nobody's gps's worked properly in the area either which we were certain were a result of the naval base. If staying here again, I would highly recommend the Marina Tower over the Bay Tower. Bay's nice but, Marina's where it's all happening. Restaurant prices were horrible forcing most to find food elsewhere........AND, the Bay tower could really use some laundry facilities.....especially if their going to be the host hotel for a baseball tourney. The worst part of the entire trip was the entire reservation process where the resey's were made back in March and apparently this hotel/chain is not set up for this type of venue as our resey's were a complete nightmare from the beginning. The hotel staff once we arrived was very accomodating to insure everything was in order and we got everything fixed. Kudo's to Blair & Brett for all of their help and excellent professionalism however, BP a supervisor back at the main office (you know who you are), NEVER fulfilled his promises nor even replied back to repeated emails asking for help. This after spending a fair amount of time on the phone with him to rectify everything. Give that guy a demerit...........The hotel itself is in a great location with a great view of the harbor. They should really step up to Queen beds (in lieu of doubles) cause you have the room to do so and doubles are rediculous for couples traveling with kids or players. We especially liked the overall locale of the hotel and it's proximity to many of the featured area's: Sea World, Zoo, Old Town, Little Italy, Coronado Island, etc....... And it's a HUGE SECRET that I'll share with you here.......Between the two towers and closest building to the Bay Tower, there's a MARINA DELI on the back side of the building that serves wonderful bfst & lunch for extremely reasonable prices. They also have quite a few ammenities should you need drinks, snacks, beer whateover. Too bad we did not find it till the last day we were there but, a fantastic breakfast was had by almost our entire team and priced as it should be. There's also laundry facilities there but, do not believe they are suppose to be available to anyone aside from the members of the marina........but, it's there and nobody is spose to talk about it. Just this little fact will enlighten your experience immensely while staying at this portion of the hotel. Would I stay there again? YES, with a much greater knowledge than the 1st time. Enjoy.........(would I try to get resey's every fixed again with BP...................NO!)

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>I was very disappointed by the poor service. It seemed like they did not have enough staff to start with check in. At times there were long lines and 3 people working. Check in seemed to take much longer then other hotels I have stayed at like Marriott. Now I realize my disappointed, use to staying those hotels, this was a differt culture. I did not feel like the staff really care about the happiness of the customer. I was use to being able to check in early with out a problem and not being charged $10.00 per hour for late check. Check in was 3pm. My room was not available until 4:30. I was offered accomdations for my bags until a room was ready, but felt like this was not something new.

<Title>“Nice But Pricey Resort”
<Content>I was in San Diego for the Comic-Con, and the Sheraton Marina was the only hotel left with rooms, so it wasn't my destination of choice to begin with. That said, it's a very pleasant resort hotel, with a wonderful view of the marina & a very nice swimming pool. I wish I had time to check out the amenities like the spa and the free bikes, but we were only there for 2 nights. Luckily, they are pet friendly, and our room's patio opened right out onto a green space, which was a plus. The real draw back was that everything else in the hotel was VERY expensive. A room service breakfast for 2 came in @ $60! And the service at the Harborview Restaurant was agonizingly sloooow, despite almost no one being seated for dining. And you're given a choice of either parking yourself for $25 @ day or valet for $28. Really? Oh, and they charge you $20 @ day (not 24 hours, mind you--a calendar day) for internet access.

<Title>“Hotel was near perfect for us”
<Content>Booked the hotel through Priceline for $104 and was then prepared to be very disappointed after reading all the negative reviews here. However, the hotel far exceeded expectations. Despite what another poster mentioned, I thought it was a perfect hotel for a family with young children. The location was quiet and serene, there were many amenities at the Marina Tower, they even had movie night at the pool one evening. The front desk associate was extremely helpful. She helped to get us into a double/double instead of the king we had been booked into and she even moved us from the Bay Tower to Marina and to the 12th floor! Thanks so much for your effort Samantha. The only complaints we had are 1.) Yes, the parking is extremely overpriced at $22. 2.) The large pool at the Marina Tower was closed an entire day for "Servicing". The smaller pool was open though. Seemed odd since I recall other reviews in previous months stating the same issue. I wonder if it's not really a servicing issue, but that they just don't want two pools open at the same time on a weekday since they would have to staff them both.

<Content>Got a special rate through USTSA. Marina Tower was very nice, clean. It smelled brand new. Rooms were very quiet; didn't hear noise from neighbors only airplanes as it is very near airport. Beds were very comfortable. Parking was very inconvenient at $22/day ($25 if you get valet). We had to park far away in a dirt lot. It is kind of out of the way from stores, and restaurants. It was excellent quality for the discounted $114/night we paid.

<Title>“Not recommended for families”
<Content>We had a 3 year old and 6 month old with us. In the last 3 years traveling all over the world with a kid, I've never stayed at a SPG hotel where they flat out refuse to provide a complementary mini-fridge to store critical baby items. This one was it; after turning us down, the service/front desk refused to ever pick up our phone calls again for the entire 3 night stay. They did eventually relent after my wife drop by the front desk for the n^th time asking and looking for buckets/bags/trash cans/etc to hold enough ice as an alternative. As a comparison, the staff our hotel in Hawaii in May practically begged us to let them store our stuff in their kitchen fridges until they can move in a fridge an hour later. After staying at the Sheraton in San Deigo, we went to the Sheraton Park in Anaheim; upon being told that the mini-fridge did not have freezer compartment for us to refreeze our ice-packs, the service staff rushed a new one in within 10 minutes. Perhaps the San Diego Sheraton is more business oriented? Anyway, I would not recommend this hotel at all for families with babies/toddlers. On to other aspects: Overall, the room itself in the Bay Tower was bigger than most non-suite rooms in any hotels we've ever stayed in. However, the bathroom was abysmally smalled. They could have shaved much off the living space to make the bath bigger - the room itself would still have felt bigger than rooms in other hotels. As others have noted, the restaurants are in the Marina tower, not Bay. We took one look at the menu of the one dining option in the Bay and decided to eat at the Gaslamp area instead for each of our meals. I did receive an incredible deal on the rooms through my corporate account, so I don't have much to complain. If I were to pay the "lowest" $299 prices from the various traveling sites for the days we were there, I'd be extremely happy after the experience.

<Content>Got this through Priceline and was worried by the awful reviews, expecially of the Bay Tower. So when we arrived and were told to head to the Bay Tower, we asked to be moved to the Marina Tower. Although the hotel was fully booked for a convention, the front desk agent happily accomodated. The room had been recently renovated, new carpets, etc., with a very comfy bed. Best of all was the great view of San Diego from the balcony. Pool is nice but busy with kids, and pool service is reasonably priced. There are a number of computers on the main floor with free internet access. Starbucks opens early and the hotel restaurant had a great inexpensive buffet dinner. Concierge was hit and miss. Overall, we were very pleased with the hotel. We never did see the Bay Tower so cannot comment. Parking at $22 / day is outrageous for a hotel so far away from downtown. There is not much around but do but try the "Island Prime" restaurant just down the road. You will need reservations. We also tried the Boathouse..take a pass on that place. Best evening in San Diego was at Henry's Pub downtown. The band Flock of 80s was playing up a storm and the beers were flowing nicely. Just don't eat there.

<Title>“Great location for Seaworld and the Zoo”
<Content>Stayed here for 3 nights. Paid $74 a night plus taxes on priceline. Hotel is located on Harbour Island near to the airport. Didn't really notice the noise at all. There are two parts to this hotel, the Marina Tower and Bay Tower. Make sure you stay in the Marina Tower as this is main part of the hotel. We got an excellent view of the Marina. The hotel pool is really nice and there is also a nice walk along the Marina. Seaworld and the Zoo are within a 15 minute to the hotel. My only gripes would be the cost of parking which was 25 dollars and the long check in that we had. The room is really nice and modern, however the bathroom was really small. The hotel is not within walking distance of Downtown and you need a car to get around! Overall if you can get a good deal I would thoroughly recommend it.

<Title>“Great Hotel - Comfiest beds ever”
<Content>trip advisor was such a great help to me that I just had to write a review. The beds are so soft that I wanted to take it home with me. Many people said that and they were right. The view from the Bay Tower is amazing but realize that the Marina Tower (which is short walk from the Bay Tower) has all the ammenities i.e. Restaurant (very over priced of course - Quinns - but they have great burgers), Starbucks, lagoon-like pool. For us it was perfect to go next door for all of that and tip toe back to our quiet lovely view. Staff was very nice and the rooms are big and very clean. Do yourself a solid and give it a try. P.S. We went for Comic Con and it was a very short shuttle trip - good stuff.

<Title>“I will not stay at this hotel again! Unfriendly Staff and Stressful Stay”
<Content>Staff was unfriendly - I was just another transaction. I asked for a quiet room and I was put in a room near a large family with kids that fought and kicked the walls late into the night. The adults were just as loud. It didn't help that the walls were paper thin. Calling the front desk yielded no results. I had to confront the noisy neighbors myself at 11pm which resulted in stress and lack of sleep. Calling the front desk was another issue. They would not answer the phone. I asked the front desk for a flower vase, they told me they would bring one up. They never did. Upon checkout, the front desk did not thank me or ask me if I had a nice stay at the hotel. They took my credit card, gave me the reciept, and I left.

<Title>“At a discounted rate, good 3 star hotel”
<Content>Priceline categorizes this Sheraton as a 4*, but as we often find with Priceline, it's really a 3-star for older Bay Tower building. The hotel is split into 2 locations around the corner from each other surrounding the harbor marina. Separate parking, separate check-in. While the Bay Tower is older, it has been recently renovated. It is quite clean, bed comfortable, good sitting area and offers the usual amenities expected of a Sheraton. Each room has a balcony. The hotel is across the street from the airport, so expect air traffic noise, but the marina is quiet and provides a pleasant view. We could also see the SeaWorld fireworks in the evening from the marina side. Although the hotel was very, very crowded with weddings, families and other groups over a Sat. stay, the pool area was not very busy. The pool bar was not open, which was an inconvenience. Parking, self or valet, is an extra $22. per day. The location is on Harbor Island, 5 min. drive either way to downtown SanDiego or Point Loma. We were satisfied with the hotel as there were few choices in San Diego for that weekend and Priceline was a good value.

<Title>“Bay Tower - Staff could not care less...”
<Content>I reserved two rooms for a 3 night stay at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. Our party was relegated to the Bay Tower, which was an older building, sadly in need of a face-lift. Very disappointing in appearance, cleanliness and amenities. What was truly surprising was the "couldn't care less" attitude shown by the staff. We would have to call the front desk numerous times to get even the most basic things [eg. previous occupant had left the room safe locked]. The gift shop was open for only a few hours over the entirety of our stay, which was unfortunate given that the hotel is isolated from any stores. The business centre's printer didn't work, which staff knew about but didn't bother to post a sign, or even tell any of the guests who were attempting to use the equipment. I run a health care service organization and it is abundantly clear that there is a lack of oversight on the part of management. A very poor effort on the part of Sheraton.

<Title>“Tale of Two Hotels, One Reservation and a $400 per night bill for a run down property.”
<Content>As an SPG fan, this was disappointing. Firstly, they have two properties. One is a hotel, which they call the 'Marina Tower' with nice lobby, flat tvs and restaurant, etc and then they have another called 'Bay Tower' which is more like a run down apartment building/crackhouse/dorm that they like to shuttle you to and call it 'an upgrade' and that they 'have bigger rooms' and so on. Liars. It is horrible, run down, CRT TVs and cream whitewashed furniture. The other tower has Flat TVs, lovely showers and you are on the Marina, not overlooking the Airport, which is the Bay Tower view. Add this to the fact that it is $300+ per night, charge $25 per night for self parking your car, $13 per PC for internet per night and this is a $400+ per night stay and honestly, a joke. Even sitting in the restaurant for breakfast and all you see is stains on the windows that block your view of the harbor and make you ask yourself what else in this hotel isn't clean. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else when you are in San Diego. This hotel is overpriced (with internet and parking it was $400+ per on a weekend) for the quality and they bait and switch. None of which are qualities that I will patron and I will never, ever stay here again. This has tarnished my opinion of this brand. It should not be a Sheraton, but perhaps a Four Points.

<Title>“Nice stay - little expensive”
<Content>Me and a friend stayed there for 2 nights. The hotel is very close to the airport, so the free shuttle from and to the airport was a plus. There is only one receptionist, so we sometimes saw people making lines waiting to be attended. When we got there they told us that the room we had reserved was not ready, but he found another one with two beds instead of one for the same price. People in general were very friendly and they have all handy tips and flyers about the city and attractions. We did not have a car so going in the free shuttle was a good way for saving money. The room was very clean and we had daily room service, there is no refrigerator just a mini bar with very expensive candybars. The swimming pool at the bay tower was parcially small compared to the one at the marina tower. View from room was great even at night.

<Title>“a vacation saved”
<Content>I am sending this email to recoginize one of your employees. This employee saved my family's summer vacation. Originally our plans were to stay at a La Quinta Inn in Oceanside and go to Legoland. Upon arriving in Oceanside, we realized our view was the rooftop to a Gentlemen's Club. On top of that we were misquoted on the ticket prices we were going to pick up at the front desk. This threw our plans off because we like many families are on a budget. We ended up changing our plans to come to the bay area. My in laws are live abords in Harbor Island. They offered us to stay there, but with a growing family, the space is a little tight. So we headed south to hotel circle. They were booked! The Ramada had a few rooms left but they were smoking rooms. My husband is a smoker so we thought we could handle it. We spent the day at the beach and went to the Ramanda room late evening. That was the most disgusting experience of my life. Not only was the stench overwhelming but we found rodent feces in the bedsheets. At this point we were totally exhaused and headed back to the boat to try and get some sleep. As were were pullling into the harbor we decided to check availability and pricing at your Sheraton. That is when Melissa Hernandez waited on me!! Not only did she find my family a room its was also affordable. Our vacation was saved. We were prepared to come home the next day. We had a great room, beautiful view, and great service. Employees like Melissa will keep your customers coming back. If there were any negatives, I would say parking charges are excessive, and the girl who checked us out was not too polite. Other than that, Melissa Hernandez was a Godsend to my family and we will return to the Sheraton! Sincerely Joanne Greco

<Title>“Disappointing at best.”
<Content>We arrived at the hotel our room wasn't ready and it was 2 hours past the projected check in time when we finally got to our room. The front desk staff had a line several deep and only one person at the desk. She was extremely pleasant and did her best to service everyone. The phones were ringing off the hook and she was trying to focus on each customer, management should really consider getting more help during peak times checking in and out. Our room was dissappointing at best, the view was great, we were on the harbor side, this however was the only highlight of our room. We went out to enjoy the balcony and had only one chair. We called twice before someone arrived with a chair, it was dirty and we had to clean it before we could use it. Our room had several non working outlets. Traveling with 2 other young woman all with cell phones, laptops and other electronics to charge, this was a huge problem in our room. I called twice before an Engineer came to our room, he said he had to get a tool, left and never returned. At that point we gave up. You have to question the decision not to offer wireless internet. For a hotel not to offer free Wi-Fi or at least offer it as an amenity for a fee is sad. This was a business trip and it made it very difficult to work as well as my 2 travel partners. The wire service was for one computer only and a huge inconvenience to be trapped at the desk. The beds were comfortable and very clean. The housekeeping staff on the 4th floor were very pleasant and worked hard to service the rooms. We love San Diego and will be back but not at this hotel.

<Title>“Slightly disheartened”
<Content>The room was nice, the bed was comfortable and the view was beautiful. I was however, disappointed that there was no refridgerator in the room except the extremely expensive mini bar filled with candybars. I have a 2 year old and had to turn the mini bar around to keep him out of it. Also, I did not appreciate having to pay $22.00 a day for the priviledge of parking my vehicle there. I never saw anything in the advertising advising me of this fee when I was searching for a hotel in San Diego.

<Title>“Location, Location, Location!”
<Content>I usually am accustomed to staying at the W Hotel or Westin hotels but this time I wanted to close to Sea World and since I've stayed here before I thought I'd try this hotel again with my young children. I have to say I was happy that I got automatically upgraded to the 9th floor since I'm an SPG Gold Cardmember because we got the downtown SD view with the bridge in the background. Beautiful! I was happy with the SPACIOUS room that we got with the king size bed. I love the extra seating blocks and couch! Great size for a standard (or maybe deluxe?) room! I took my girls (ages 5 and 3) to the other pool since it was bigger but I was very disappointed with the lack of pool service. I had to go up to the bar to order and then flag the waitress down to check out. She redeemed herself since she caught a mistake on the bill and discounted the beer I had since it was happy hour. We went back to the bay tower pool and soaked in the jacuzzi at sunset but the emergency switch kept beeping and beeping...we had to leave. Then, we literally walked 500 feet to the waterfront and watched the sunset cast its color on downtown SD....beautiful! Great location...especially if you like to take long walks with beautiful views! All in all, it was a nice hotel experience with the front desk, valet, and housekeeping service.

<Title>“Good experience....”
<Content>Upon checking in, I requested to have the two rooms we reserved side by side. The front desk was able to accommodate us and placed us in the Marina Tower. It was a 5 minute walk (or 1 minute drive) from the Bay Tower (the main tower) but we didn't mind since the walk was right next to the water and was very refreshing. Plus, I hear the rooms in the Marina Tower are bigger than those in the Bay Tower. The rooms were quiet, a good size, and beds were very comfortable, but the couches in both rooms need to be replaced or reupholstered because they were obviously worn out. The bathrooms need updating and a good cleaning! The views were beautiful, especially when sitting out on the balcony. Only 2 things to complain about...parking is expensive, $22/day and there was a $100 hold for each room placed on my card for 48hrs after checking out that I wasn't informed about when I checked in or checked out. All in all, needs some TLC but hotel staff was polite and enjoyed our stay.

<Title>“Never again!!!”
<Content>I am so not happy with this hotel. The first time I stayed there it was perfect! The second it was awful! I stayed here for a wedding for two nights and might I mention I was the make-up artist for this wedding as well as the bride's brothers girlfriend. Everything was beyond screwd up. They put us all in the different towers and when I checked in I had them fix that and put us all in the same room. It also took 40 min to check in. And then they stuck me in a room with no A/C. Might I mention I live in San Diego and i was only staying here for the ease of getting the bridal party ready. So I was stuck sleeping in 80 degree heat! When I called they said in the morning they would fix the room since they were booked and could not switch me rooms. In the morning they came in and decided to start fixing it at 9am and when I told them at 10am I would have the bridal party coming in and needed the A/C fixed. They told me it would take longer and we would be without A/C. So finally they switched me rooms. And Frita the person in charge didn't even want to comp the night stay let alone give me a discount on the room. So finally they changed me rooms. I had to go down for the keys and I had to move my own luggage since the bell hop never made it up with my keys or to move my stuff. I will not recommend this hotel to anyone!!! Please dont stay here let alone block rooms for an event.

<Title>“A nice stay on the marina”
<Content>I was a wee bit nervous about my three night stay at the Sheraton Marina, based on some other reviews. At check-in, the woman behind the desk gave me keys to a room in the tower, which she said had two double beds. When I told her I had requested a king, she switched me to another room in the lanai section on the ground floor. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. There was a patio with sliding glass door that faced the tennis courts. The TV was a large flat-screen. The shower had one of those fab shower heads with a million little jets (and great water pressure). Oh, and the bed was super comfy. Housekeeping was great. The bed was made every day, and any towels that were left on the floor were replaced with fresh ones. While it is true that the hotel will award a $5 gift card to use on the premises for every night the housekeeping services are denied, it is by no means a requirement to accept this offer. Normally, I avoid eating in (chain) hotels like the plague. Usually the offerings are lame and overpriced. We ended up having a late dinner one night in the hotel bar, and it was actually just as good as if we had gone out somewhere, and not super expensive. There were some surprisingly decent beer selections, as well. The main reason for my stay was because of work, and I was a little skeptical when I saw that the exhibit room was actually a giant white tent outside the hotel. It was a little strange, but certainly better than the dungeon-like, subterranean exhibit areas of other hotels. Equally important, the boxed lunches were way above average, and the deli-style lunch on the last day of the exhibits was pretty tasty. With all these great things, I will say that there was a lack of customer service in some areas. I tried getting in touch with someone – anyone – about a shipment that was being held for me, and I had to call practically every number just to get someone to finally answer a phone (thank you, concierge-lady). Same thing when I called to make the reservation prior to the trip. I don’t know if they are short-staffed or what, but not being able to get in touch with the front-of-house is annoying. Those minor inconveniences aside, I was still very pleased with the hotel overall and wouldn’t think twice about returning. (Don’t forget to say hi to the cute fish in the giant tank in the lobby!)

<Content>I often stay at Starwood properties and therefore selected this Sheraton based on trust and previous experience. I was however disappointed with the level of service as this particular property. Many times people would try to contact me at the hotel and no one would pick up at reception. In addition when I tried to contact someone at reception it took a few calls before anyone picked up as well.

<Title>“There are plenty of other hotels by the sea”
<Content>When I checked in, I was surprised to learn the hotel charges $22/night for parking. This charge was not clearly disclosed prior to check-in and comes across to me as tacky. On the third night of my stay, I came back to my room to find my keycard did not work. I headed down to the lobby and learned the hotel staff had mis-booked our stay and believed we had checked out that day. The staff member who assisted us seemed friendly enough, and assured us that the problem had been taken care of. Yet the very next morning the hotel folio had been slipped under the door and showed us checking out that day! I'm tolerant of one such mistake, but after an issue has been brought to the staff's attention and the same mistake is made the following day, I made the decision to never return to this hotel. To top it off, since the hotel staff messed up our check out date, we did not receive housekeeping during part of our stay. All in all, it was a disappointing experience.

<Title>“Good but not great”
<Content>The down side: Rough start with shuttle and check in. After waiting 30 minutes at the airport, I was glad to see the shuttle arrive. Unfortunately, the shuttle didn't stop but continued on. Finally took a taxi as I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes. On check in, the attendant asked if I was standing in the right spot (how would I know the shuttle didn't stop if I wasn't in the correct pick up place??). Room wasn't ready even though it was after 3pm. Was told they would call me when the room was ready. After 2 hours, I stood in the check in line again to inquire if the room was ready. Yes, the room was ready. I did get a call 30 minute later that my room was ready. Had a package sent to the hotel which the hotel staff stated didn't arrive. After phone calls to my secretary and delivery service verifying the package did arrive at the hotel and was signed for by the hotel staff, the hotel was finally able to locate my package. Package arrived damaged but I don't think that was the hotel's fault. I was charged a $5 "handling fee" which I thought was tacky since they obviously didn't handle the package effectively. Positive: Except for the transportation and check in process, the rest of the hotel stay was uneventful. Room was clean. Bed comfortable. Nice view of the bay. Wait staff in the restaurant was friendly.

<Content>My only complaint would be when I checked in I was advised that I had booked a room with a king size bed (not the double I thought I had). I wasn't going to let that bother me; besides checking in on July 4th before the fireworks > well I was in a hurry to see the amazing show. Now that I'm home and reviewed my confirmation I did indeed book the double > given that I have confirmation of same you would think the front desk would also and not make it like its my mistake if thats all they had left; the hotel was packed due to the long weekend. I found the hotel very clean and other than the minor mix up with the front desk (seems to be a problem with this hotel given the other comments) I enjoyed my week. The weather was totally unexpected; but not Sheratons fault. I met some friendly locals who were as surprized by the cold weather as I. I loved the location near the airport. Also had a great view of the Navy base. If back in San Diego I'd stay here again; but bring my confirmation in order to avoid check in mix ups.

<Title>“Very Pleasant”
<Content>Check in was a bit slow, but not really an issue, we had to remind them that we had Club room access as they forgot which would have meant we couldnt access the Club Lounge, but we got that sorted so was ok. The room was quite small compared to all the other hotels we had stayed at in the US on our holiday, in saying that though the decor was very nice, the room was clean the bed was very comfy and the view was great. One issue which was not the hotels fault really but would have liked some kind of announcement to have been made, after checking in we experience a 5.4 earthquake, was in our room sitting on the bed this was very scary to me as we dont experience these hardly at all where we live, as I said not the hotels fault but a phone call or some sort of PA annoucement would have be been good. Walked down 12 flights to the lobby, as lifts automatically shut down which is expected and the lobby was caotic, quite alot of flustered guests and not really any hotel staff around. Apart from that was a pleasant stay.

Called the desk & they told me they couldn't tell me my rm # over the phone-I'd have to trasp back to the front desk with all my luggage to find out. AC didn't work in rm- it remained 73-76' despite the thermostat being set at 65. Reported this to front desk with no response. Food was mediocre & I didn't get the right items on my order. I never got another pre order breakfast slip after the 1st day. My room cleaning got skipped 1 day. When I called to report it, there were no offers to rectify it, so I had to put forth the question of at least getting some new towels. No map of the hotel grounds in hotel info booklet. I had to wander around to find the entrance to the fitness center ( which was only on the outside), etc. Never found what would be considered the Business center Outside staff were very attentive- about the only plus for this hotel.

<Title>“Nice hotel but isolated from resturaunts/entertainment”
<Content>The room was pretty clean except for a few long black hairs in the bathroom which shouldn't be there for a hotel of this level. The location is isolated from entertainment. It is located right on the marina which is very nice. If you want to go anywhere it's gonna run 10 dollars minimum for a taxi to grab a bite to eat. Also, you'll pay $12 a day for internet in your room. And $12 if you take a drink from the minibar.

<Title>“Rediscover?....recommend Rethink before deciding to stay here”
<Content>Every aspect of the hotel was a disappointment. Hotel is across from the airport and convenient but so is the Hilton. This property was remodeled but is poorly ran and highly inefficient. I waited nearly a half an hour to check In and was only sixth in line. Upon arrival, there was no one at the front desk and after ten minutes, someone came from the back room and after that, another one for spg guests. The spg gold/platinum person was so slow that the regular person was averaging 5:1 over the spg gold person. As a platinum, I gave up and joined the regular line. After you get the keys and a parking pAss to pay 22 dollars to park in a dirt lot, I was left to my own to find the elevators. There are many elevators and most likely, you will end up o. The wrong elevator like I did. I guess this is how they greet guests or show them the workout room by lugging their luggage in a quest for the room. I have stayed at every star wood property in San Diego and this is by far the worst. They even give you one less in room coffee pack than all of the other Sheraton properties. The rooms are nice with warm rooms nut a lot of hall noise and is not quiet. Also, if you are friendly like me, prepare yourself to be ignored when greeting hotel employees with a friendly hello...I greeted two folks and neither responded. I don't think this property is very kid friendly although they have A pool. To my platinum colleagues, the only amenity the property offers is points so do not expect anything else. This has to be my 45th starwood stay this year and by far the worst...so no need to rediscover or even return.

<Title>“Expected more for 4-star hotel”
<Content>I'll begin by saying all of the gentlemen outside the hotel were very nice and welcoming. The bellman was readily available and the valet employees always came out to open my door when returning from a cab ride. Outside their doors, they provide a great 4-star experience. The service inside; however was not as pleasant. The check-in wait time was very long and there was only 1 person at the desk for the majority of the time during my 5 day stay. This was very inconvenient and time consuming for anything I needed that required assistance from the front desk staff. I tried several times calling the front desk from my room and never got an answer. Room service took forever and I never received fresh towels for my room. I paid the extra $50/night for a Club Room which should provide "upgraded amenities" such as a one of the top to floors with "breathtaking views of the city", terry bathrobe, bathroom magnifying mirror, access to the club lounge, etc. No robe or magnifying mirror and the club lounge could only be accessed from 1 set of elevators on the opposite side of the hotel from my room (which wasn't on one of the top 2 floors). Of course I figured this out after 25 minutes of searching because no one answered the phone at the front desk. I could go on but those were my biggest issues with the hotel. I would never stay at this hotel again.

<Title>“Credit Card Nightmare”
<Content>I stayed four nights for a business conference. Check-in was terrible, and I found out two days into my stay that my credit card was charged double the intended amount, This was a major inconvience (it was the only money I had). The hotel manager provided accomidations for me to eat the rest of my stay. I am back home and my credit card issue is still not resolved. I have several overdraft fees along with checks that did not clear. I missed a whole day of the conference that I was supposed to attend, tring to resolve the problem with the front desk. I was so upset my blood pressure was elevated, and I had to take medication. This was a nightmare. I can say that the view from my room was very nice and the bed was comfortable.

<Title>“Enough with the texting!”
<Content>We just finished our stay at the Sheraton and we were very pleased with the hotel and service. Our only complaint was that the pool attendants spent more time texting than playing with the kids. The two helpers called the kids over to play a golf game that took about 4 minutes and then the helpers sat back down. I asked if the helpers were going to play a game with the kids and they said in about an hour they would maybe play another game. It would have been nice if the helpers could have played tag... with the kids.We have stayed at several beach hotels that have been kid friendly and fun for the kids. Sheraton didn't go the distance and the kids have asked not to return to this hotel. They said it was boring and there was nothing to do. I do not recommend this hotel if you have kids.

<Title>“Not Happy With the Management”
<Content>Check in took over 30 Min. We checked in on Friday before the 4th of July holiday weekend. You would think they would have more than one person checking in, but she was very nice and did apologize for the wait. The room was great with a wonderful view. 4th of July fire works were amazing! We stayed three nights and never had any hot water. Other than that we enjoyed the room (bay tower 4th floor) . Checking out-not so great! The rate we were quoted when booking the room was some how changed to $50 more a night. The manager on duty did NOTHING to change my rate and said that's what it is and offered a print out of the rate SHE has. After checking out I spent 45 min on the phone with cental reservation, who were the ones I booked my stay with. Come to find out when I called to confirm my room and rate 4 days before some how the rate was changed. I was told to call the mgr and they will fix it. I called to speak with the same mgr I spoke with when I checked out and she said sorry it's still $50 more a night and I must have changed something when I called to confirm. Hummm...wouldnt I know that? And no, I didn't change anything. She said she couldn't help me and would have to speak with her mgr and would return my call the next day. Mind you all of this is still being done on my vacation. Back at home the next day, I still haven't heard anything. I call the same mgr at the hotel and asked her why I haven't heard back from her. She said she will go ahead and correct the bill since she doesn't want to go "round and round" with me. Pretty shady considering she told me she couldn't make any changes the day before. Hopefullly when the bill comes in it will have the correct rate quoted charged. If it wasn't for the rate issue and the way the management handled it poorly, I would have gone back.

<Title>“Staff very helpful and Upgraded room with wonderful view”
<Content>I had booked a room on the San Diego Zoo website the morning of our stay but when I arrived at check-in the staff could not find my reservation. However, they solved the problem immediately and upgrade our room to one with "a view". The room was very nice, clean and comfy. I really enjoyed the balcony looking out on the marina bay! The staff was helpful with all types of questions about various sightseeing locations. Upon check out they did say I would be charged for the parking which should have already been prepaid but upon checking my bank statement when I arrived home, everything had worked out in the end. Thanks for a wonderful stay and I will definitely checkout more Sheraton locations during future travels.

<Title>“Disappointing”
<Content>We stayed for the July 4th weekend. The hotel is okay.. It's not luxurious or fancy and it didn't really meet our expectations - especially at the price ($229 + taxes + $28 parking each day). We stayed in the Bay Tower and had an amazing view for the fireworks - that's the best part. The bathrooms are clean enough but not well maintained... Iron spots/rust in the tub..grungy corners.. just generally looking a little old and worn. For the price, we hoped for a really comfortable, clean, superior hotel experience. That's not this hotel. We also had problems with housekeeping.. We left Saturday at 9:30 to visit Old Town and came back at 2:30 and they still hadn't cleaned our room.. but we had to put our son down for his nap so we couldn't wait for them to clean it then.. and housekeeping leaves at 4pm so we didn't get our room cleaned at all. (Should have requested the $5 "greener" credit for that day in hindsight!) The parking fee is ridiculous too.. like everyone else says. Unless we want the amazing 4th of July fireworks view, we won't be staying here again. There's a slew of other hotels downtown that are cheaper and/or able to meet our vacation expectations.

<Title>“Plastic in the food & Bed Bugs!”
<Content>What was supposed to be a fun family vacation mixed in with some work turned out to be a hue disappointment. When I booked the room I was presented with photos and reviews of all the outstanding renovations. When we arrived we were quickly told we would be a the “other” tower. The bayside tower was not what we had seen or booked. Not wanting to make a big deal about it we checked in. It took 25 minutes before the desk answered my call to bring up our luggage. By that time my husband had self parked our car, gotten a coffee and made his way back to our room only to have to turn around and go get our luggage himself. We went to meet my sister in law who we were traveling with who was in the Marina Tower for dinner. We went to Quinns as the other restaurant was not open?? In our order of fish and chips we were served a piece of deep fried plastic that was still attached to the fish. My husband nearly choked on it thinking it was a bone! Our waitress did her best but she was missing in action most of our meal. When the Manager did come over he offered to comp the dish. Unfortunately, not wanting to make a scene in front or our 2 small children we said okay. Needless to say, the meal was ruined for everyone and no one finished their meals. $90.00 for food no one could eat and service that was unacceptable. We went back to our hotel and the next morning my husband woke up with a huge bug bite on his leg, when we pulled back the sheets on the bed bugs flew out. We were able to catch one to show to the Operations Manager and bug guy. My husband still has the bite on his leg and it’s been over a week we have been home. We were moved to the Main Tower and upgraded to a mini suite with $100 Sheraton money but we were paying $300 a night to get fed plastic and to get bit by bed bugs!!! Unacceptable. I would not and will not recommend your hotel to personal or business travelers.

<Title>“Bay tower property just OK. Monitor your bill carefully for over charges”
<Content>My stay at this property did not get off to a great start. At check-in upon hearing I booked the room through a third party, E.G. Expedia, Priceline, Hotwire, I was told I would be in the Bay tower and not the main Marina tower. They claim it one property but it is two. Dont be fooled by the web site as the amenities at the bay tower are poor. Pool tiny, fitness center a joke (a couple of cardio machines and some dumbells). The main marina tower has 2 pools and a proper fitness center. It has the nice restaurants and the Starbucks. The main tower offers movies by the pool at night (Weekends) and has other fun daily pool activities. Bay tower nothing. You feel like a second class citizen and not worthy of the Sheraton name. The one redeeming quality of both properties is the view. Rooms are average sized at best but was clean and oder free. Bathroom was small and the toilet was loud and sounded like a cruise ship toilet and toilets flushing can be heard through out your stay. Balcony was nice with a view of the bay. Beds and pillows were comfy. On my last night they slipped my statement and it said everything was paid in full and was Charged $288. As my room was pre paid I was not too happy with what I saw. I went to reception and they corrected the problem. Just beware every person ahead of me had a problem with over charging. From a 70 year old man being charged for the entire contents of his mini bar (apparently he bumped into it) to another person being charged for an extra day. I would only recommend this place because of the location but thats it. Finally please keep in mind this review is based on my stay in the bay tower. I might have had a better time at the main property.

<Title>“Nickled and Dimed”
<Content>This Sheraton is a nice hotel with a nice view, but the rooms are too small. We stayed here as part of a wedding party; otherwise, we would have gone somewhere cheaper. They didn't give a very good group rate. Of course, parking was $20 plus a day, but that is becoming more common. The annoying fee was to have internet in your room. It's free in the lobby but not in your room. At over $200/night just give us internet access please. also, you couldn't put your own drinks in the firdge; otherwise you were charged. They have mini fridges to rent, but it's another fee. Food and drink was over priced for the value. Our air conditioning didn't work in our room, but we just left the window open and enjoyed the breeze. Amazingly the gym was free and that's awesome!!

<Title>“Club benefits a joke-10 people in line for breakfast & staff clears buffet”
<Content>This was the worst Starwood Preferred Guest experience I have had. The designated reception counter was cold and uninterested in being helpful. I was traveling with my son and Grandsons and although we took 2 rooms for 2 nights after a booking error in the secondary building the only rooms we could get were on the club floor. They were lovely rooms but the $50 surcharge/per room for the club was a joke. Breakfast was served until 9:30 and when they ran out of food(coffee, toast, cream, milk, etc. at 9:15 they were reluctant and slow to replace and then at 9:29 with 10 people in llne they cleared the buffet. The computer did not work and the staff was unhelpful, indifferent and dismissive. Very disappointing.

<Title>“Secondary Location, Crazy Add-On Charges, Plastic Cups, no SPG benefit”
<Content>Against my better judgment I booked this Harbor Island property which is well away from where the center of San Diego's enjoyable nightlife has relocated. The staff was pleasant in every way, but too many things weren't great, for example: * despite paying $279 my room looked out on a gravel rooftop * there were plastic drinking cups (think Holiday Inn) in the bathroom * no wireless Internet and $18.95/day charge to connect * $22 for one night to park my own car in an uncovered lot * $21 for a breakfast buffet * no acknowledgement for being Starwood Gold, and no benefits offered With taxes, the Internet, parking and my typical buffet breakfast the tab for one night was $355. Sorry, but that's way too much for just an average property in a secondary location.

<Title>“Expected Much Better”
<Content>The Marina Tower Townhouse was a surprise upgrade. Well appointed rooms and bathroom but what had us not wanting to go back was the service and valet fees of $28 and the late check out charge of $10/hour after noon. WOW!! And we are Starwood Members. We previously stayed at the Bayview Tower for our first honeymoon and it is by far better. Even with this upgrade the Bay Tower was just off the charts and just a better property. Seems as if things have gone down since 2004. Called to the front desk on several occasions and no one ever picked up the phone. We absolutely love San Diego but will stick with our Marriott family of hotels or the Westin.

<Content>Sheraton Harbor Island Drive took my breath away the moment I stepped into the lobby and then again the moment we got into our room. Everything about the room made me comfortable. I loved the white comforter. So clean,thus when its very white and remained white, you know the hotel actually is very clean. Very white towels, white sheets--just made me feel right at home.

<Title>“It was ok”
<Content>I went on priceline put in a bid for a four star hotel for $100/night. I really didn't think I would get anything, but this came in. I was pretty excited at first, until I read the reviews. I figured for what I paid a night it would be worth it. They put us in the marina tower, and just like the other reviews, this is a bit older tower and not as nice as the main one but it had great views! The beds are comfortable and clean. The only wierd thing is the towlets have the loudest flush I have ever heard. You can hear when other rooms flush them too. We had a little airplane noise, but not too bad. We ended up falling asleep on the balcony one night, it was very relaxing. We had a car and the location was perfect for us, since we spent alot of time cruising the bay. All in all, if you can pay $100 a night like we did, it is a great value.

<Title>“Too many add on charges”
<Content>The room was OK. The view was terrific and the location was good. The beds were too hard and uncomfortable. The real problem, however, was the add on charges that just kept piling up. $22 a day to park is ridiculous. $11 a day for internet is even more ridiculous, especially considering it isn't wireless or high speed. There are no vending machines, or if there are they make them impossible to find, and the prices for the in room refrigerator are unbelievable. And room service-$16 for pancakes. Come on! You people need to go out in the real world. Even Super 8 has free high speed wireless internet. This hotel is really about a two star that is trying to act like(and charge like) its a five star.

<Content>Just returned 2 days ago after spending our last 6 nights of Californian trip at the Sheraton Hotel and marina.I cannot believe the negative reviews because we thought this was the best hotel of our trip!!The whole hotel has a wonderful ambience,beautifully decorated and the beds are so very comfortable.We were upgraded to the club floor so could have breakfast every morning in the club lounge with its panoramic views of both the marina and the San Diego skyline.There was no airport noise in our room when the balcony door was closed plus the planes do not fly at night so can`t imagine how people could be kept awake!i can`t recommend this hotel enough and will certainly recommend it to anyone going to San Diego.

<Title>“I loved this hotel.”
<Content>I am so surprised as I read some of the previous negative reviews. I stayed here for 6 nights and thoroughly enjoyed my visit. The hotel is conveniently located to many of the tourist sites which made it easy to tour after our conference. The service at the restaurant was excellent. The waitstaff was prompt, attentive, warm and friendly. They made me feel like they really cared whether I enjoyed my meal or not. We used valet parking and received our car within minutes of our request. The valet staff was courteous and again friendly. In fact every hotel staff person that I dealt with was extremely helpful. Everyone greeted me when I passed them and always looked me in the eye which made me feel like they were really focused on me. The ambiance of the hotel was lovely. The comfortable seating areas in the lobby were great for socializing and relaxing. There were computers available for guests which helped me a great deal. The decks and patios were lovely to sit on to gaze at the beautiful view of the marina. In the evening it was so nice to sit outside at one of the fire pits and relax in a rocking chair in the cool San Diego night air. My room was on the ground floor which made me a little nervous because of the sliding glass door. Therefore, I didn't open the drapes. I would have liked to have let light in but it was too easy for anyone to see inside the room since I faced the parking lot. I would have preferred a view of the marina and a room higher up. However, the room was clean, comfortable, quiet, and had a cheerful decor. I was surprised that being so close to the airport, I rarely heard a plane. Maybe being downstairs was a plus! I enjoyed my stay here and would love to return.

<Title>“Disappointment in this Sheraton property”
<Content>Staying in the Bay Tower. Hotel parking is very limited and costly. The room was nice until you start to hear the noise around bedtime. Toilet flushed like a cruise ship and you could also hear the bathroom noise from other guests. Airport noise was not too bad, not much can be done about that. I have stayed at other Sheraton properties and have been pleased with the hotel. This property to me does not measure up to the name. Staff was nice at both towers and friendly, no complaints there. They should not charge for internet use. Other lower priced properties don't charge. I was very disappointed about the $11.95 fee.

<Title>“Enjoyed our Stay”
<Content>Our family stayed here prior to our visit to Sea World. We stayed on the Club Level and our room had a wonderful view of downtown San Diego. Most of the staff we encountered was very friendly. The room itself was clean and the beds were awesome. We enjoyed being able to open the balcony door and the view was fantastic. In other reviews people complained about airport noise , we were able to sleep just fine. The only thing that we were concerned about was that pets were allowed in the hotel and my husband is allergic to pets. I did not see on the website that the hotel was pet friendly and if I had known that I would of put a note in the reservation to make sure that we were not in a room that just had a pet in it. The lobby had nice places to sit and relax however we preferred to be outside. The weather was lovely and they were showing a movie in the pool area the night we arrived. The fitness center was a nice feature that had adequate amount of treadmills, stationary bikes and weight equipment. They also have two ping pong tables so that the kids and adults can play. The pool area was very cute and clean when we went the next morning. If you book in the Club Level you are given access to the Club Lounge the next morning which provides you a nice continental breakfast. If you are able to get a good deal on the Club Level it is worth the upgrade. I think it is a great hotel for families who can splurge on a nice weekend get away or vacation. The only negative is the parking, if the hotel is full you might have a hard time finding parking closer to your tower. Not everyone might enjoy the long walk from the parking lot to their building. In addition, the parking is a $22.00 fee and I would hope that the management would improve the parking situation. P.S. Be ware of the Mini Bar in the room, I had already read about and had even requested them to empty it out. However, when I got to the room the Bellman even advised us to becareful with the mini bar. If the sensor is messed with they will charge you for the mini bar. I opened the cabinet door and found that the mini bar had not been emptied.

<Title>“WOW! We sure enjoyed our stay at this hotel! We will be coming back! They Love Dogs Too!”
<Content>My wife and I booked at the Sheraton Harbor Marina Tower (the largest of the two Sheraton's on Harbor Island). We got the "Romance Package" and stayed in the Marina Suite. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious, very clean and had a picture postcard view of Downtown San Diego. We were even impressed that we barely heard the planes taking off and landing at the San Diego Airport which is just about 1/4 mile away. The bed was very comfortable. We slept so well. Also, the newly decorated room was very nice. Probably most important for us was that they welcomed our dog with no added charge and no fuss. Sure they wanted us to be responsible for our little guy, but it was nice that we felt welcome. There was even a very nice restaurant on the island called the "C-Lounge" that welcomed him on their patio. The view of the city at night was breathtaking from the restaurant's vantage point. Now back to the Romance Package, it was a great value. The complementary "breakfast in bed" EACH DAY was impressive. We ordered off of the menu what we wanted and had deliciously prepared FULL breakfasts delivered to the room both days we stayed there. Then on our anniversary night we got a complementary bottle of champagne and 6 huge chocolate covered strawberries. Finally, they offered us a very late checkout of 4pm, which we gladly used. We enjoyed every minute of time just relaxing on one of the two balconies overlooking the city, sail boats and Navy ships on the bay. The only downsides were that daily self-parking was $22.00 and in-room high speed internet was $11.95 per day (up to $18.95 for super fast internet). NO WIRELESS IN ROOM, BUT FREE WIRELESS IN THE LOBBY. This is pretty steep compared to other properties we've stayed at. But we felt that, given the total value of the package we booked, it was ok. WE WILL BE BACK and I heartily recommend this property for your next vacation! We did not experience any of the negatives in service mentioned by other folks who stayed here.

<Title>“This hotel has gone downhill in the past 2 years!”
<Content>This hotel had many problems. No one answered the phone--operator, room service, guest service...NO ONE! They have NO towel bars in the bathroom yet encourage going green and reusing towels--that can NOT be hung up! They had an earthquake and we were swaying on the 8th floor, but when I went down the elevator to find out if we might be evacuated as they were 2 months ago the staff said they NEVER evacuated! Lying to guests is not good customer service--and they had no idea what to say to all the concerned guests!! The consierges were wonderful and the restaurant staff, but the rest of the hotel NOT too great!!!

<Title>“I was rather disappointed by this hotel...”
<Content>I was rather disappointed by this hotel. The location and views were great but that is were the positives end. The bed was very comfortable, but there were what appeared to be blood stains on our sheets. The cleanliness of the hotel I would say to be below average and our shower curtain was also stained pink at the bottom. But, the worst aspect of the hotel had to be the noise. It was the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed at. I felt like I was in a college dorm again. I don't know if it was the guests that were there when we were or that their walls and windows are paper thin, but it made for a bad stay.

<Title>“I would stay here again”
<Content>I got this hotel with a great rate thru Hotwire, but when reading the reviews I was a little concerned with the location since I was not renting a car. But taxis were always available at the hotel and for the tourist spots we hit, the rate averaged 8 to 13 dollars. The zoo being the most at 17.00. All the tourist spots we hit had taxis waiting outside so you never had to wait for one. This was perfect for my daughter and I. There were also concerns after reading the reviews that we were booked at the Bay Tower and not the Marina Tower. That was not a big deal either. After being gone from 8 am to 10 pm every night it didn't matter to us. When we were driving back to the hotel you come to the Marina Tower first. My daughter and I would stop there and go to their bar/restaurant and sit outside and have a drink. Then we would catch the shuttle that seemed to always be there when we were ready to go and it would take us to the Bay Tower. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful too. Very important when you are from out of town and trying to figure out where to go and how to get there. Hotel was clean. They offer 5 dollar vouchers to not remake your room everyday. We used one every morning for breakfast at the restaurant at the Bay Tower. We thought this was really a nice place to stay. We wanted to go to La Jolla and w/o a car it would have been expensive by taxi. There is a visitor information center down by the Harbor who can give you any information you need to get around. We went to Seaport Village and they have a booth that sells all kinds of combination tickets at a discounted price. We bought a Seal Tour, Midway tour and zoo as a package and saved money. All in all a great trip.

<Content>I travel a lot for work and it's always great to have excellent customer service. And, from time to time, you will cross path with an individual that truly cares about their job. Lorna Alagar at the Sheraton Hotel & Marina in San Diego, CA will make you feel great about your day and your visit. She took a terrible day that I was having and turned it around into a positive. Her calm demeanor and professionalism is impeccable. What a great asset to this hotel. Thank you Lorna Alagar for simply just being you. See you soon!

<Title>“I doubt that I will ever return”
<Content>I am a pretty seasoned traveler and have stayed in dozens of hotels in the last 10 years. Sheraton San Diego had the distinction of being the first hotel that I ever found a live bug (identified by my 11 year old cousin) crawling in the bedding and also the first where I found hair in the bathroom AND no soap when I entered the room. We got our breakfast comped because of the bug incident, but not much was done about the hair other than it was cleaned while I was gone. Room was actually nice, front desk personnel very friendly, but those two incidents stick out. I must also say, although this has little to do with the hotel, that I was disappointed with Priceline because this is listed as a downtonw/Gas Lamp hotel, and this is hardly the case. It is a $12 cab ride to that area.

<Title>“Nice and quiet for being by an airport”
<Content>This is a nice, quiet and clean hotel close to airport. A little further than I wanted from the things we did. There is no trolley stops at or near this hotel, so you would need a car or take a taxi. It is approx. 3 - 5 miles from downtown gas lamp quarters. If you rent a car be prepared to pay $28 a day to park it at hotel, a little pricey if you ask me! No restaurants or shopping within walking distance. Hotel restaurant very pricey! When we checked in there were dirty dishes outside the room on the floor from previous guests that stayed there for 4 out of our 6 days there, complained three times before they finally picked them up. Overall hotel experience was great! If you drive to downtown be prepared to pay $20 to park. Seaworld is great, but spend the whole day as there is alot to see and do. Do not waste your money on the zoo. Definitely go to the USS Midway Museum. If you have a rent car to to LaJolla Beach and see the baby seals that hang out there.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>I was originally concerned with this Hotel because it was so close to the airport but it was beautfiul, spacious and had a perfect location.. When you got to hotel it was very big and felt more like a resort than a hotel. We had a great view from our room of the marina. We stayed in the Marina tower, which is newer and everythign seems to be in this section. (Starbucks, Restaurants, gift shop, pools, gym) Rooms were totally updated, with nice bedding and very clean. I would def stay here again and recommend to a friend. If you are debating this or right downtown, this is a really nice hotel, cab to downtown is $11 and you have more room and a Big pool. I dont think you will get that downtown. Also "The Link" which is there computer/social area is fabulous!

<Title>“A comfortable and clean hotel”
<Content>I booked this hotel for the night of our arrival into San Diego as we were landing late in the night. The shuttle was easy and the hotel is across the street from the airport. It is a large hotel that is clean and upper scale. The rooms were comfortable and the beds were really nice. I got a great rate on this hotel of $120 through the hotel's website, which I thought was a deal, especially since is was not through priceline or expedia, etc. I woudl stay here again for sure.

<Title>“Great Place to Stay”
<Content>My husband and I recently booked this hotel thru a Priceline special for $99 a night when most four star hotels were charging $250 per night due to the marathon. We were very pleased with the choice. The hotel is a short cab ride ($15) to the Gaslamp area. There is a nice shuttle to pick up/drop off near the airport. We didnt stay in the main tower but this wasn't a problem as we still had a pretty view of the marina, and a huge room. The room was clean, nicely decorated, and very comfortable. While it is close to the airport this was not a problem as the airport seems to be situated near most everything so the noise would have been a factor anywhere. I only heard the planes a couple times and it never bothered our sleep. We enjoyed our stay!

<Content>For over a year we planned a family vacation with all of our children, their spouses and the grandchildren. The rooms were great, and we all had a wonderful time. The check in was easy and the staff courteous, the restaurant food was good and they were very accomodating to our large group. It was easy access to the airport, downtown and other attractions like the zoo and legoland.Also easy access to walking by the bay. Thank you for a wonderful reunion.

<Title>“Best place to stay for GATOR by the BAY always Mother's Day Weekend.”
<Content>This was the second time we have stayed at this Hotel. It is across the steet from Terminal 2 at the San Diego Airport and they offer a free shuttle. Since it was our Anniversary we decided to stay two nights. I must have mentioned this when I booked the hotel several months in advance. We arrived back to our room about 10 PM on Friday night after attending the The Gator by the Bay Festival. Much to our surprise and delight the Sheraton remembered our 32nd Anniversary with a very nice bottle of wine, a large attractive bowl of fruit with about eight different kinds of fruit. Then to top it off , the most beautiful 8" designer type Anniversary Cake. It made our whole weekend. This hotel would also be a great place to stay if your taking a cruise out of San Diego. They have incredible views, to the east is the famous Coronado Bridge and Coronado Island and to the West is the Marina both with beautiful views of the San Diego Bay. The pool area is really nice and we enjoyed spending the afternoon in the sun and water. Oh yea, and the beds are sooo comfortable. A great place to stay and we will be back.

<Title>“Nice Airport Hotel”
<Content>My wife and I stayed here for Memorial Day weekend. We got the hotel through a blind bid on Priceline and would have preferred a more downtown hotel (as the bidding area includes both the Downtown and Harbor regions) but at the end of the weekend were very pleased with the Sheraton. We checked in on Saturday evening and were very happy when the woman checking us in gave us a marina view. The hotel was bustling with activity and there were a lot of people using the internet access in the lobby and the Link access they had with a few computer terminals. We walked around the hotel and down the marina a bit and saw the two pools - one of the pool areas was showing The Little Mermaid which was a good idea if you had kids. I believe they have movie showings throughout the summer on Fridays and Saturdays on large screens outdoors. The room was nice with a very comfortable bed and a flat panel TV. The bathroom was on the smaller size but perfectly adequate. There was a balcony with a few lounge chairs that gave us a view of the marina. The hotel is a block away from the airport so if you have a morning or evening flight and want a hotel right near the airport, this is your choice. For the most part we really enjoyed the hotel. The only issue we had was that the parking area is very limited and we had to park in the back area and our car ended up pretty filthy because the back lot isn't paved and is a dirt lot. Considering the parking is $22/night it would be nice if they would at least pave the back lot so I'm not forced to get a car wash after staying there. Also, if you don't have a car you're somewhat limited in places you can go on foot. Overall this is a pretty good hotel and we'd be happy staying here again.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel, Unfortunately Away from All the Action”
<Content>This is definitely a beautiful 4 star hotel, probably good for conventions or business meetings. I was lucky enough to get the last room in the Marina Tower; I probably would have left had I been booked in the Bay Tower... I hate that "Annex" concept where they have those overflow bldgs that have none of the amenities and niceties of the main bldg. Luckily the lady at the check-in desk saw my face when she said Bay Tower and quickly made the adjustment to the Marina Tower with no complaints. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. My room was small, but very pretty, with gorgeous harbor, bay, downtown views and a balcony! The property was lovely. But huge minus for the location, unfortunately. I was expecting this to be walking distance to the gaslamp and other parts of downtown San Diego, but this is really better described as a very well done airport hotel (the airport is across the street). I'm a walker, and downtown San Diego is such a great walking area, but I had to get in my car to go anywhere. And speaking of car, I thought $22 for parking was quite steep considering the fact that we were not in the heart of downtown to begin with. So,mixed reviews on this place. It's pretty and will prob work if you're a business traveler or looking for something convenient from the airport. But, if you're looking for a place that's in the heart of it all, this is not your hotel.

<Title>“Good Location and Hotel for San Diego”
<Content>We had a really nice room that overlooked the water and had a balcony. The room was clean and had a gorgeous view (I think it was the 25th floor). I thought the hotel was centrally located in San Diego and we walked to a lot of restaurants and activities. It has a Starbuck's in the hotel, which is nice. It also has a really, really nice fitness center. I thought check in was good, but check out was a bit of a hassle. The check out machines were down, so we had to wait in the line. However, I have never had good luck with San Diego hotels. I don't know why, but usually I don't have a good experience. This was a nice change.

<Title>“Nice hotel complex”
<Content>Very good hotel, just a few minutes from the airport. Make sure your room is in the main Marina Tower. The room itself was nice, contemporary style, with a balcony facing the water. Good service and prices. I don't think there was any wi-fi internet in the room but I might be wrong. Food in the restaurant is ok, try the seafood salad sandwich. The shuttle bus didn't run as often as I expected. Convenient ticket check-in kiosk in the lobby will save you time at the airport (security lines are long). For a nice dinner with view, try Bertrand at Mr. A.

<Content>Hi, I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights . The dance festival used this hotel as the host hotel. I enjoyed the great location, free airport shuttle service, good food and the free internet use. The hotel also offers green incentives. I chose njot to have my sheets changes everyday and I received a $5 coupon for any restaurant in the hotel - very worth it!!! The staff was friendly and the spa area was quiet and relaxing - just what I was looking for.

<Title>“Who Ever Said Business Couldn't Be Fun?”
<Content>My husband and I along with several colleagues stayed here for a large software conference in May 2010. What an experience! The first impression left by the front lobby and the staff of the front desk was incredible. Staff members were extremely helpful, courteous, and friendly. The check-in process was a breeze, and our wishes were accommodated. Our room was impeccable as well, and had a stellar view. We rated the beds "very good" only because there is no bed like home; they were very comfortable and inviting. Housekeeping was efficient, friendly, and also accommodating to our needs. The "Green Choice" program offered by the Sheraton is a fabulous idea and is beneficial to the environment while also making the guest feel like they're getting a bargain. I love that there was a Starbucks inside the facility. We tried Quinn's, and enjoyed it, but more, really enjoyed several meals at Papanani's, a little deli/eatery located between the two towers (the prices were very low, food was excellent, and the ambiance was incredible). Additionally, half-way through the week, we found that we had to extend our stay a day; the hotel was very accommodating and gave us the conference rate for the extra day. Parking is a little steep for us East Coasters ($22/day), but we found fairly cheap fares in the shuttles and vans available to hotel guests. Very conveniently located across the interstate from the airport; however, while inside the hotel room itself, we could not hear planes taking off and landing. The SheratonLink in the lobby offered free wireless internet and plenty of cozy seating areas for those who didn't want to pay for in-room services. For our first trip to California, we were very impressed, and would highly recommend the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for business and pleasure.

<Title>“pleasant stay with young kid; would stay again”
<Content>I was cautious about staying at this hotel because of the number of negative reviews here. I was expecting a motel quality sheraton. Let me also tell you that I went with my wife and a two year old. Overall my stay was pleasant (especially for the price). I would stay again. It is literally walking distance from the airport - but the rooms are well sound proofed, and you cannot hear the planes. Even outside in the pool, we hardly ever heard the planes. The location is pretty good in that it is close to everything (short cab ride, no need to rent a car - we even gave our car back early because it was cheaper to use a taxi). However nothing is walking distance and the onsite restaurants are very expensive ($28 for linguini pomodoro!). The pools are clean and have a lagoon shape, but are not really resort style. but they are not the standard rectangle either. the hotel was clean and the staff friendly. no issues overall. i stayed in the Bay Tower (the one that is by itself). The other tower seemed to have a lot more activity/people, but the rooms were standard sheraton rooms. I had no issues with stains or anything like that. For families - there is a kiddie pool (which is essentially a 1 1/2 foot deep pool for kids the size of a spa). Sea World was $20 each way in taxi. Zoo is even cheaper. Downtown about $15 each way.

<Title>“A room with a view”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina for one night prior to our cruise. It was great to have a shuttle from the airport to the hotel although it took a while for it to come even though the hotel is fairly close to the airport. We stayed in the Bay Tower with a view over the harbour. The rooms were large although not in perfect condition. This hotel is a reasonable distance from town. (Approx $15 by taxi). This hotel was fine for one night but you really require a car if staying any longer.

<Title>“Poor location, nice hotel for conference”
<Content>This hotel is a decent one for a conference- good amenities, close to the airport. Not great food onsite though and getting to downtown or any other parts of San Diego required a cab ride and some time. Beautiful views of the marina and the bay from many rooms. There are actually two buildings, about a five minute walk apart - we were not told this when making our reservation and ended up not staying where our conference was. This wasn't a difficult problem as it was a pleasant walk, but would have been difficult for people with difficulties walking or getting about. The staff were pleasant and helpful. Rooms were standard and clean.

<Title>“Big Fat Disappointment”
<Content>If you really want to see San Diego and all it has to offer, don't stay here. The description the hotel website gives is a fabrication. There are 2 parts to this hotel- the "hotel" and the "motel". After thinking we were staying in a 4 star hotel with a view, we ended up driving up to our room with an outside door in the motel portion and had a view of a fence and if we looked up, the airport. SUPER disappointing. The girl that checked us in was unfriendly and unwilling to move us or ensure we would get moved the next day. The hotel did move us after the first night, but the view was still not great. The rooms are just ok, but not 4 star quality rooms. It is about a 10 minute drive downtown. There is very little to do in the area where the Shearton is located, yet parking costs $30 per night. San Diego offers SO much... do not stay here. Stay downtown or on Coronado. I was willing to lose my money on our room at the Shearton just to get the heck out of there.

<Title>“Wished I could have stayed longer”
<Content>We had a little extra time on our vacation, so we booked a weekend through Hotwire and took our chances. I wasn't real thrilled at first to be booked into this hotel becuase I had stayed here twice before for conventions. The first one I got a room miles from the main tower right next to the swimming pool pump room. The second time I got a room overlooking the parking lot. I was at a convention then, so it wasn't really a big deal, but this was a nice getaway with my hubby. Thanks to other reviews, I knew to ask for the Marina Tower with a Harbor view. I did not use the automated check in system just so that I could request a room with a view. The check in chick was really friendly and gave us a room on the 9th floor facing west over the harbor and marina. The sunsets were fantastic and hubby and I even ordered room service one night just so we could enjoy the view. The room was decorated in a red, white and blue nautical theme. It was very tasteful. We had breakfast one day in the restaurant. It was really nice and we had a nice window table by the marina. The hostess was super nice and our waitress was very efficient. The price was less expensive than I thought it would be. There was a rude dude at the table next to us watching sports on his laptop and talking on his cel phone. We asked him nicely to turn down his computer or use an earpice. He continued to talk on his cell phone. I can't believe these kind of people, but it isn't really a reflection on the hotel. All of the hotel staff seemed exceptionally nice. We even observed some staff trying to help out the UK guests in accomodating them with additional nights and telling them what parks and other places were offering free or reduced admissions for them because of the volcano and ash that caused them to have to stay longer. All in all, I wish I could relive my weekend again in exactly the same way (minus the rude dude at breakfast). The only thing I didn't like was having to pay for parking. I was prepared for it as my reservation clearly stated the price of parking. $22/day isn't bad if it's a covered parking garage, but for a parking lot it's kind of steep, especially when we had to park way out in the dirt/gravel. Five stars all around except for cleanliness and that's only because there was a large urine stain on the down blanket of one of the beds.

<Title>“Great venue, pleasant staff, wonderfully comfortable beds”
<Content>We stayed for 1 day en route to a Panama canal cruise. Having read some negative reviews prior to leaving England, we booked in after a 23 hr journey with trepidation! Ok, so the reception seems understaffed & checking in took 20 minutes - but, our room was fine, the view was onto the tennis courts, we thought it may be noisy as it was on the ground floor near the swimming pool - it, was so quiet and the beds were soooo comfortable. In fact the only disruption we had was from noisy americans laughing outside the door at 3am! The food in the bar area was good as was breakfast and the staff so pleasant and helpful, particularly the waitress at breakfast, who went to great pains to introduce all those going on the cruise before we left the restauraunt. Overall we were impressed & thankful that the negative reviews were unfounded. As it is so near to the airport, would definately stay here again and hope for a room on a higher floor .

<Title>“Good location, great staff but a little bit shabby.”
<Content>Recently stayed in Marina Tower on the 6th floor for a week. Location was excellent and taxi's to most attractions such as Sea World, Zoo, Gas Lamp are approx $15 each way. The lobby and grounds are immaculate and first impressions are excellent. Check in was prompt and efficient. The room was a good size but it felt a little shabby due to scuff marks on walls, stained grout around shower, stains on furniture, rusty fire sprinklers, etc. There wasn't one single issue that was enough to complain about, but combined they did take the gloss of the early impressions of the hotel. I also noticed numerous stains on the carpet in the hallways and the ice machine on the 6th floor was out of order for the duration of our stay. I'm not a big fan of Starbucks, but I was glad it was there as the restaurant has a fairly limited breakfast menu and is a little expensive for it's standard. Quinn's pub is a nice place to have a quick meal and a drink. The reason we would return to this hotel is the staff. As it was our first time in San Diego we availed of the concierge desk on a few occasions. The ladies on the desk are fantastic and seemed genuinely happy to help. We would rate the hotel a 4.0 based on our experience. If a little more time was spent ensuring everything worked and was clean the rating would be a 4.5

<Title>“Exceeded Expectations!!”
<Content>As a traveler of over 150 nights a year, I stay in a lot of hotels. among the many, have been a fair mixing of sheratons across the country (Atlanta, Tampa, Cedar Rapids, Chicago, Minneapolis). NEVER before have I stayed at a Sheraton so glamorous, perfectly detailed and well thought out! Let's get a couple negatives out of the way first: -Front desk is understaffed and slow! Phones sometimes aren't answered promptly. -Over-priced breakfast restaurant. (although cheaper Starbucks is in hotel too!) -Would love to see mini-fridges included in rooms, as the expensive mini-bar is a big turn-off to everybody who isn't still living in the 1980's! -$22.00 a day to SELF-park! Ouch, folks. C'mon! There, that's the bad staff. Now, just a smattering of the numerous great elements of this facility: -Excellently furnished health club, with ping-pong tables outside. -Starbucks in the lobby! -Love the complimentary computers in the stylish lobby "nook" area. -Fun sports bar that seemed to be hopping at night. -UTTERLY FANTASTIC POOL AREA!! Beautiful fountains, and a pool that is one of the largest free form pools I've ever seen (and I've stayed at 4 resorts in Hawaii!) Also a hot tub that literally could seat 20 people comfortably! -Grounds are well-manicured, with rocking chairs strategically placed to view the adjacent marina-yacht club and relax. -Balconies in all rooms are perfect for viewing the yacht club on one side of hotel, or downtown skyline on the other (can't go wrong with either view) -Rooms are comfortable with flat-screen tv's and nautical colors and decor in deep blue, burnt orange, and white. -Gorgeous lobby with wonderful mood lighting and an aquarium about the size of 2 French doors put together! All in all, can't say enough good about this place. Simply loved it and would not only welcome a chance to return, but would go out of my way to make it happen!!

<Title>“Really nice hotel.”
<Content>We purchased two rooms through Hotwire at a very good price. We were very pleased with the quality of the rooms. We stayed in the Bay Tower. We had a lovely view of the marina. The room was very spacious and pretty. The bed was great with wonderful bedding. In other reviews some stated the hotel was not close to anything. We found it to be within ten minutes of the Gaslamp District and Petco stadium, and a straight shot from our hotel. Also within walking distance of our hotel was a superb restaurant called C Level, which was located on the water. It is so easy to get around San Diego and we loved overlooking the marina from our balcony. Very very close to the airport but the airport is very close to everything else too!

<Title>“Convenient Location, Decent Room, a Bit Over-Priced”
<Content>This hotel was sufficient for the needs of my wife and myself, but given the price and my wife's SPG status, I would have expected better. We were placed on the 4th floor above the pool, in which we experienced loud enough pool noise to require earplugs to sleep. Although not pleased, we were leaving on a very early flight, thus our decision to stay at this location. The bed was comfortable and bathroom sufficient, but service was lacking. When we asked the Concierge about the airport shuttle, they said we could catch the first shuttle with no problem. As it turned out, we had to wait 2 shuttles before we could get to the airport. The pool area might have been nice, but we did not have time to enjoy it.

<Title>“Best place I've ever stayed at.”
<Content>We stayed in the main part of the hotel. We left on a cruise the following day. We had the most fun here. There was 11 of us. We stayed on the fourth floor and I booked the rooms through priceline one month prior to trip. I got them for $75.00 per night per room. The staff was great, food overpriced, but they did offer parking while we were on the cruise for $10.00 per night. I would stay here again and again.

<Title>“this hotel was horrible”
<Content>Okay, maybe not the absolute worst hotel I have ever stayed in. I stayed there because my conference was in the hotel. I didn't see any cockroaches. There was no green water coming from the faucet. It has an excellent view of the harbor. And it is very close to the airport. But this hotel was not good at all. First off, the bed was lumpy, which made it hard to sleep. Also problematic for sleeping was that the walls were so thin you could hear anything and everything going on in neighboring rooms, even coughs. This hotel really needs to invest in some soundproofing. The hotel is not within walking distance of anything. You need to take a cab to get anywhere. It wouldn't be so bad if the restaurants in the hotel were really good...they are not horrible but not places I would want to eat every meal for five days. There was a sound akin to that of crickets in the vent. I called the reception to get them to fix it, they said they would come, but never did. I called again and still no action, then gave up.We had to call the reception to get the bathtub unclogged. They did eventually come and got it cleared but the drain was still pretty slow and got worse as the week went on. About half the times we called the reception there was no answer. The concierge was not that helpful. I stayed in the hyatt near the convention center during an earlier conference and oh how I longed to have been staying there as our taxi passed it on our way to restaurants. Anyway, I would suggest staying somewhere else. This is a pricey hotel and from what I gather, you are paying for a nice view and little else.

<Title>“Good stay at Sheraton Hotel and Marina”
<Content>This was my second stay at the Sheraton, having once again won the room on Priceline with a 4* bid in the downtown area. I was extremely happy when I arrived at around 11 AM and was immediately given a room. While I was in the Bay Tower last time, this time I was placed in the Marina tower. I was placed in a corner room on the 12th floor. I found this room to be a little smaller than the Bay Tower room, but perhaps a little better appointed. The shower and sink were quite nice. This tower also had much nicer grounds with a nice pool and spa area. The restaurants on premises were, as usual, pricey though had a good view. The on-premises Starbucks was a nice breakfast option if you didn't want to pay for the highly priced buffet breakfast. This hotel also offered some nice services. They have a free airport shuttle that runs on a constant loop about every 20-30 minutes. You can call for the shuttle, but I think it will just show up ... funny thing ... if you do call and select the option for the shuttle in the phone system, it will kick you back to the menu. There is a Microsoft center in the lobby offering free wi-fi and a few free computer terminals with printers. There is a charge for internet in room. The biggest negative for this hotel is probably its location if you want to do anything downtown. I saw a trolley stop, so that may be an option, or you could also take about a $10-15 cab ride downtown.

<Title>“Not worth the price”
<Content>What's the point of opening a hotel with say, 500 rooms, and not providing a garage to park in? A parking fee of 14 dollars per night is way too much. The rooms are small, smell like shoe freshener and the bathrooms are small with a tiny sink. You're better off staying at a less classier place for half the price. The location blows; right by the highway and there's nothing but a huge green mountain right behind the hotel. This place is more like 2 stars as I work for a 4 star 5 diamond joint in Vegas and I find it hard to believe that the Sheraton is only 1 star less. Give me a break.

<Content>I got a great price on Sheraton's web site and they upgraded me to the Marina Tower facing the water and downtown - peaceful, beautiful. The staff were exceptionally pleasant and attentive. As for the facility and the room it's about what you expect from the Sheraton brand. I'd stay there again.

<Title>“Nice view, very close to the airport, spacious rooms, great breakfast”
<Content>The hotel was chosen because my wife was attending a conference there, with activities during 4 consecutive days. It is located just a few minutes from the airport and the hotel has an eficient shuttle service every 10-15 minutes to and from the airport. Rooms at Bay Tower are kind of 30% bigger than those at Marina Tower. We had 2 double beds. Great breakfast. No free internet in rooms, just in lobby. The shuttle can take you to the airport where there is a bus line to downtown reached in 10 minutes. Beautiful ambience. Nice decoration. Spacious. Some noise from helicopters of a Navy base at the other side of the bay.

<Title>“Huge disappointment”
<Content>We stayed here for one night (thank goodness) before a cruise and as a regular Sheraton guest at other properties I expected this to be in the same league - wrong ! we stayed in the Bayside tower which was probably the first mistake, we heard from other guests that the marina tower was better. They say this hotel has been renovated - what that means is a pretty lobby and new wallpaper in the bedrooms. couch in our room was dirty, bathrooms were a disgrace ( outlets hanging out of the wall), worn out towels. we complained the the receptionist who just shrugged her shoulders. The restaurant was only open for breakfast and that was expensive however we found a little deli by the marina that did great food for very reasonable prices. This property is barely a motel by my rating !!

<Title>“Save an hour of your life, take a cab... not the shuttle!”
<Content>I stayed here recently for one night. The hotel advertised a free shuttle bus to/from the airport. I assumed that the shuttle would constantly be coming around and after 30 minutes of waiting.... I called. The lady on the phone said the shuttle would be there in 8 minutes. 28 minutes later, the shuttle arrived. Not being familiar with the area, I didn't realize that the hotel is practically across the street from the airport. A little too far to walk with luggage, but a cab couldn't cost more than 5.00. If I had to do it again, I would spend the 5 bucks and get an hour of my life back. I try to stay loyal to the Starwood properties and usually am upgraded as I've been a Platinum member for a few years now. No luck here... My room was about as standard as it gets.... although at check in It was noted I was "upgraded to a higher floor"... WTF? The room itself was "average" . Clean and what you would expect from a Sheraton. The room had a very nice flat screen TV, but despite being HD capable, none of my channels were in HD. Kind of a waste. My trip was very short... One day and I spent most of my time away from the hotel. I noticed a bar/pub type place that seemed popular and a very cool salt water fish tank that was HUGE in the lobby. In all, my stay was what I would expect. Nothing special and earns the "a-OK" rating from me

The service at the restarurants was generally very good and most of our waiters we very good with our 4 year old daughter. We were there for Thanksgiving and the Thanksgiving lunch/dinner was excellent. We loved San Diego it's beautiful.

<Title>“Was excited for a view I never got. Standard Sheraton.”
<Content>I booked this hotel on Priceline for a weekend stay in San Diego. In the end, our stay was perfectly fine. I was disappointed however, after reading the hotels website, at the room we ended up with. We got what I like the refer to as the 'Priceline Shaft'. This is when you typically end up in a room that is of lesser quality than a regular room in the hotel, simply because you booked on Priceline. Some hotels can't do this because all rooms are basically identical. The Sheraton Marina, on the other hand, quite easily put us in this category. To be honest, there was nothing really wrong with the room itself. I was more put off by the location. The website advertised how almost all the rooms had a view of the skyline or the marina. Ours had a view of the backside of a tennis court. Not only that, but we were in some random satellite building that wasn't really connected well to the hotel. I also was severely unimpressed about the fact that our room had exterior corridors, very motel-like. There was no security for my door and anyone could have wandered up the driveway and knocked on our door. It was really bizarre to see this type of building in a Sheraton - I was certainly not expecting it. Once I accepted the motel atmosphere, the room was fine. It was fairly standard with most Sheratons, but decorated in a nautical theme. We had two beds, a desk, and a bathroom. It was not an overly large room, but not small by any means. The bathroom was a bit tiny and the lack of ventilation in it, something I find common in the US, was a little suffocating. Outside the room, the hotel had a full service Starbucks that we enjoyed although I think the prices were mildly higher than normal. There was also a restaurant and a lounge that we did not sample. I didn't see a fitness center, though I'm sure one exists. We walked by the pool a couple of times to get to the main hotel - it seemed nice. Never busy due to the cooler climate. Rooms contain internet for a fee, or you can go to the lobby for free wireless. There is also the Sheraton Link in the lobby, which provides free computers with internet for registered guests. At other hotels this area has been packed with people however I rarely saw anybody using them at this hotel. Location wise you are not really around much, but it is still a nice location. The airport is basically next door, so it is convienient if you are using it in conjunction with an airline. The marina is behind the hotel, if for some reason you are headed in that direction. My favorite part was that is was located on Harbor Island (not an island - attached to land). This provided a long Bay-front walking path with fantastic views. A drive downtown was 5 minutes. Overall this hotel was satisfactory to stay at. I wasn't happy with being in the two level outside building, and there were a few expensive add-ons ($22 parking etc.) that irritated me during my stay. But we had good sleeps, the proximity to downtown was appreciated, and we were comfortable. That's enough to earn 3 stars out of me.

<Title>“Worst customer service ever experienced at a Starwoods Resort”
<Content>Upon check in we were told we could've upgraded our room for $20 on-line, but at the counter it is $25 and then the next front desk told us $50 - sounded like a scam. We decided to eat at the restaurant and stood at the counter forever - wait staff all tried very hard NOT to make eye contact so they were not "stuck" helping us out. We ended up checking out early and booking a new hotel. Upon check out we again waited while the bell boy finished chatting with a friend to flag us a cab. When cab arrived, no help with bags and he went back to visiting with his friend. A lot of work to do at this hotel to bring customer service level up to the Starwoods standards they are known for.

<Title>“NICE BAY VIEW”
<Content>I booked it from Expedia for 100 something a day. I didn't know there's actually two hotel one is the Bay tower and the other one is the Marina Tower. We end up in the Bay tower. The room is big with sofa and a little desk table. the bed is really soft but the washroom is a bit small and not that clean. No fridge just a mini bar and it has a sensor on it...don't even open it. We're in the 11th floor and from our balcony we could see the fantastic view of the Marina and Downtown. It was nice after few months of winter in Canada. Transportation: we didn't even rent a car. On the first day we just hop on the trolley come in around 8:52AM and 9:52AM and this will bring you to the Seaport Village. You can also walk but its about an hour to the seaport village. Cab is about $15 one way including tip or a bus Route 992 I believe takes you to downtown. FOOD: we didn't eat in the restaurant, we eat in a small deli located between the two tower it's called papananni's I believe. or we just eat in the Seaport village. You can buy drinks in the delli as well. There's some drinks at the gift shop as well at the main lobby of the hotel. over all it was a great city and we will come back again.

<Title>“Good place to just sleep. Close to airport.”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina with a friend. The rooms were clean, and the bed and pillows were super comfy! Slept well the 3 nights I was there. The fitness center is nicely equipped, but the location was kind of weird to me- had to go outside and walk under the foundations of the hotel to get to it. I found it kind of creepy and scary when I had to go there by myself one night to get to the lone vending machine (which is next to the fitness center.) The rooms have complimentary Starbucks coffee. They also have a mini-bar/refrigerator in room which is on sensors and costs an arm and a leg, so don't even open it up!! (And don't move anything inside it, or you will be charged.) There were no vending machines around to purchase drinks, so you are stuck drinking water from the bathroom sink, or paying for a drink out of the mini-bar or one of the restaurants. (Hint- the fitness center does have a filtered water dispenser, so take an empty water bottle with you, and fill up in there. Run on the super nice treadmills for a few minutes if you don't want to feel like you are stealing! LOL) Showers were warm and felt great. There is supposedly a "spa" in the fitness center. Didn't see it. Think maybe it is just a room where they do facials ($95 for one hour) and massages with appointments. Location-wise: it was very close to the airport, and there is a shuttle that runs from the airport to hotel (and back) every 15 minutes or so. My friend and I were on a tight budget, so we thought we could walk most places from the hotel (the Gaslamp District, Balboa Park, etc are about 3 miiles away), but that's simply not feasible. Luckily, cabs are waiting for you at the hotel, and most downtown locations are within a $10 cab ride. Make sure you take the number of the cab company and a cell phone with you, though, because you can't just hail a cab when you are ready to return to the hotel, since they don't patrol the streets just looking for their next fare. You'll just need to call them, and they'll send out their next available ride to pick you up. The fare starts when you get in the car (not when you call.) Be sure to ask the concerierge where the closest X is before you just get in the cab and go. My friend and I wanted to go to IHOP for breakfast one morning, so we just jumped in the cab without researching the location. $20 cab fare later, we showed up at IHOP. Which, of course meant that we had to pay another $20 to get back. Most expensive IHOP pancakes I ever had! :) We would have been better off ordering room service and paying the $16 for 3 pancakes. I would really recommend renting a car and traveling up to La Jolla to visit Torrey Pines and the coves and beaches there. You can do a 12 hour car rental if you don't want to pay the $22 overnight parking fee. I'm starting to digress here, so let me just summarize with this: If you are looking for a clean comfy place to just sleep and take showers, this is a great hotel. If you are one who likes to use up everything that a hotel has to offer, this will probably end up being a very expensive vacation for you. Either way, it's in beautiful San Diego, and that's all that matters!!!!! Have a great trip~

Great service, clean and cozy rooms, centrally located, and 5 computers with free internet in the lobby! Yes, parking is $22/night, but I've never stayed at a 4-star hotel that didn't charge for parking. I will definately stay here again on my next trip to SD.

<Title>“Great Hotel and Location Don't expect SVO or Gold member perks”
<Content>Stayed one night for a memorial service at Point Loma. Hotel was great and location awesome. Room was clean and comfortable. Only complaint was asked for a late checkout and was told 2:00 pm anything after that would be $10 per hour and I can't offer that either. What ? why even mention the $10 and I can't give you that? My buddy who isn't even an SPG member let alone an SVO owner or Gold member get's a 4:00 pm checkout and I'm offered a 2:00 pm checkout like they we're doing me a favor. Stored my gear in his room instead. Very disappointed in how they treated me as an SVO owner with Gold membership. If you go here don't expect anything different than the non SPG membership, let alone SVO owner would get. Not sure I'll be back based on that alone. Great hotel otherwise.

<Title>“Very average hotel by Sheraton standards”
<Content>It's hard to appreciate the qualities of the hotel when all you see is what they don't have. We arrived in San Diego in the late evening and decided to go downstairs to eat. Normally, there is a folder that has the hotel amenities to include the hotel restaurants. Not there. The next day, we went to Phil's BBQ (Very good), but I wanted to write down the address. Looked for a pad and pen that normally comes in the room. Not there. In the morning I went to take a shower and after I dried myself off, I looked for a towel hanger... not there. Service was very good though. The people were very helpful and made us feel welcome, it's just too bad there was so much to focus on what was missing.

<Title>“Amazing View, Really Clean, Relaxing location”
<Content>I stayed in the Bay Tower in room 771. Wow! What a beautiful view of the bay. The room was really clean, with a very comfortable bed. A balcony that you can sit in and enjoy the sunset. The downtown area can be hectic so this was a geat relaxing location. Also there's a great walking path along the bay in front of the area and two great restaurants at both ends of the street overlooking the water. I would definately stay here again. Stay in the Bay Tower and get a room over looking the bay. There are two towers. The first tower is the largest and has all of the accomadations. Restaurants, etc. The Bay Tower is the second tower and is about a five minute walk from the first tower but has it's own parking. A more peaceful setting and the rooms are larger.

<Title>“Near the airport, but otherwise inconvenient; extra charges abound....”
<Content>The hotel is clean and modern, but the location is very inconvenient for business in downtown San Diego. As others have noted, it is a good $15 cab ride away from anywhere. As seems typical for a Sheraton, nothing is included. Internet? $$$ (Nobody could give a reasonable explanation as to the difference between the basic and enhanced version!) Breakfast? $$$. Apart from that, they seem to take advantage of their captive audience by inflating the charges for everything on offer. For a quick stay before flying, sure, but otherwise there must be better choices around.

<Title>“Everything was great, until...”
<Content>We spent one night at the Sheraton at the marina in San Diego. We booked the room through Jet Blue vacations and got a lovely room with a great view at a great price. We enjoyed a delicious lunch at the 'casual' restaurant/bar where the service was attentive and the prices were comparable to our NYC area. Back to the room to relax and turn in early--we were headed for the border and a Baja adventure early the next morning. I turned down the bed and was quite distressed to see a BLOOD STAIN on the white sheet. Not terribly large, but quite noticeable, about the size of a dime. I called the desk to request that the bed be re-made, and a housekeeper arrived a while later--with a new sheet. When I asked her how this could possibly happen, she suggested that the morning housekeeper may have cut herself and bled on the sheets. When we requested that the ENTIRE bed be re-made, she provided us with new pillowcases as well. Absolutely no attention was paid to the blanket, mattress cover or the duvet. When we again asked for the entire bed to be attended to, she muttered something about the hotel's policy to save water; and then, when pressed for details, seemingly forgot how to speak English. We were too tired to request another room, had only a few hours before our early morning departure, so I thought that a Trip Advisor review would be more effective than just complaining to the management. This is the second Sheraton "adventure" we have had in the last few years. It will be the LAST.

<Title>“Convienent But Not Impressive”
<Content>Spent 5-days at the Sheraton for a combination trade show and time off with wife. Found the hotel for a good rate. Not disappointed but nothing exceptional. The hotel is right across from the airport. It is on a little island that is mainly marinas and though very close to lots of airport activity, you get a great sense of being away from the hustle and noise. You can see water regardless of where your room is. Our room looked out "front" from the older tower (there are two actual hotels in the complex). On the 3rd floor and we looked right across a small bay at the end of Coronado Island and the Navy facilities. Very pretty and relaxing. We had a small balcony and spent several nights enjoying a cocktail before bed looking out over the water. The area was very good for long walks along the water with great paved trails and landscaping. Great for walking and running. We walked to several local restaurants on the island and always felt invigorated. the rooms are in big need of renovation. We were in the older tower and you could tell. From what I understand the newer tower had just gone through a renovation and the older tower was next. Could not be soon enough. The room was loud and 70's throughout. The bathroom was dingy and needed updating badly. Housekeeping was very good and not saying the rooms were dirty - just older. The location deserves a little better hotel. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Location is great for any business near the airport or downtown. I had a convention and was within a 15-minute cab ride of the conventions center and the awesome old district downtown. If you can get a cheap rate, this is not a bad place. If you are looking for more upscale, keep searching.

<Title>“Hotel with great views and the most comfortable bed you will ever sleep in”
<Content>We stayed January 8 - 11, 2010 and upgraded to the deluxe suite with a king bed and balcony on the 11th floor for only $20/night. (Not bad considering I only paid $77/night on Priceline for the room). Our view was excellent - We could see the bay, marina boats, airport, downtown, bridge to coronado.... We didn't do room service - not interested in paying the 19% automatic gratuity on an already overpriced breakfast. The bed was SO comfortable that we couldn't help but sleep in until at least 10am each day. It was THAT nice. The only issue we had was when we decided on a late dinner (9:30pm) and were recommended Fish Market. We took the $9 cab to get there only to walk in and find out they were closing for the night. This was very disconcerting -- we were so excited to eat there after both the front desk and the bell hop recommended it. The bell hop even called the cab for us, put us in the cab, and asked the cabbie to drive us to the Fish Market. You would think one of them would have looked at the time and thought enough to advise it was too late for dinner there. Instead we went to Gaslamp for a high end meal which was twice the price but delicious. We didn't have time to visit the fitness centre or any of the three pools because we were so busy going to Balboa Park, The Zoo, La Jolla, Old Town, Gaslamp, etc. Overall I would consider staying at this hotel again. The only drawback is the location. I think I might consider staying downtown next time so the cab rides are cheaper (or unneccessary).

<Title>“Nice Views, Nice People, Absurd Fees, Poor Value”
<Content>If you're looking for a value, don't come here. I booked a room at about $165.00 a night, thinking that was a decent rate for the area. However, once I got here, I was getting soaked left and right in absurd fees. Some good examples are $22/day for parking, and for breakfast, your only option is one downstairs restaurant with a lovely $17 egg dish!! On top of all that, I had to pay $18/day for high speed internet! In this economy and competitive market, I find it ridiculous to go to a hotel and have to pay this for web access. The views are very nice, but the location is basically right on top of the airport, so be prepared to listen to take offs and landings on a regular basis. And if you don't have a car, there is really no way to walk to an affordable local restaurant or store. On the plus side, all of the staff here were very very nice and friendly. My views of the harbor were great, and there are some good walking/running paths around the hotel and harbor. The room seemed to be renovated and updated, and was clean and comfortable. If this location can get with the year 2009+ and offer a nice breakfast buffet, free internet, and free parking, I would probably stay here again. Right now, no way.

<Title>“Great Views and Fabulous Stay for our Anniversary”
<Content>We got this hotel from Hotwire. After the name was revealed, I came to Trip Advisor, read the reviews and thought my anniversary trip was doomed. Of course, since I could not cancel it, we went and our experience was GREAT! We stayed in the Marina tower and the 8th floor. Our check-in was great! The customer service was excellent. The woman that checked us in told us upfront about the parking fees. She gave us alternative ways and costs to travel, let us check in at 11:00 am, and gave us a room with a great view! The concierge was fantastic. She suggested a great place for us to have lunch outside the hotel. The hotel was clean, beautiful, and quiet. We travel almost every weekend on business, so we know great hotel service. I was very pleased with the Sheraton. They treated us like we paid full price on the top level. I look foward to going back again.

<Title>“Not a 4 Star Hotel....at least the Bay Tower where Priceline guest stay”
<Content>I was pretty concerned about staying at this Hotel after reading reviews from other guest. I was a Priceline guest and was placed in the Bay Tower. The hotel staff offered me an upgrade to the Marina Tower or a higher floor in the Bay Tower for an additional fee which I declined. If you’re looking to be within walking distance to the downtown area or Gaslamp district, this is not going to be your best bet. The room was decent size and nicely decorated but this hotel is definitely not a 4 Star Hotel. I’ve never stayed in a 4 Star hotel that had carpet stains in the lobby and in the rooms. Maybe they should use their $22 per day parking fees and hire a carpet cleaner for the hotel. Overall this hotel did have a bed, bathroom, and working shower but definitely not a 4 Star hotel by any stretch of the imagination.

<Title>“Great stay”
<Content>I was worried about this hotel after reading some reviews. We booked with priceline and did not have any problems when we arrived. The Marina tower was the first tower you see when you drive up and we did not have to move to the Bay tower at all. The front desk made sure everyone was taken cared of from what we can see while waiting our turn. The rooms were decorated nicely with a nautical theme, a nice touch for the area. But a bit small for family with kids. I believe the Bay tower has larger rms. The lobby was clean and spacious with a great view of the marina. In fact almost everywhere you went in this hotel you had a great view to look out at. Plus with a starbucks on location and a free wi-fi bar , we had made ourselves at home quickly upon check-in. Calling for addtional pillows was easy and quick. We made sure to tip the housekeep for their prompt service as well. The hot water and pressure was good for being on the 9th floor. Parking is $22 a day and can be difficult if there is a function going on. We had to park off to the side in a dirt lot one night, but it was still close within walking distance to the lobby.For the rest of our stay we made sure to walk along the harbour and relax in the hotel. The food served here was quite good too.

<Title>“Took the dog and all went smooth”
<Content>Great views , great service! I had my doubts about bringing our German Shepherd on her first hotel stay but I could not have asked for a more lovely experience. All the staff were flexible and kind. We stayed two nights and on night two , noisier people moved into the room next to us and I knew our dog might bark so they quickly moved us to a beautiful more remote room, not an upgrade but just as equally as nice a room as we had before. THe views are spectacular from the high floors. The beds are super comfy and the elevators were super fast unlike what I had read in others reviews. The food was great, better than I expected. It was a perfect stay and I will definetly be going back for more trips since my son lives nearby. I would recommend trying for the rooms on the upper floors if you appreciate the good views. The room we had facing west had a bit of jet fuel smell since the jets take off with their tails aimed right at the hotel sliders. The view was so nice though , shutting the door stopped the smell from coming in and subsequently all jet noise as well. The room facing East had no residual jet fuel smell. It was fun watching the jets take off and land. I would recommend this hotel to couples and couples with kids , people of all ages and people with friendly , well behaved dogs.

<Title>“If you are attending a conference here - stay somewhere else!”
<Content>Overpriced rooms in horrible locations for conference guests and poor customer service. Showed no consideration towards me as a lone female business traveller. Paid conference rate (only $10 less than rack rate) and dumped in a ground floor room looking out onto the parking lot with the taxi rank directly outside my window. Asked to move rooms (based on my safety concerns) and was told there were no other rooms available even though there were plenty still advertised online. After much discussion got moved to another room (still ground floor) but at least this time without the taxi rank infront of the window. Requested breakfast to be delivered to my room, waiter refused to leave it outside the door as I had to sign for it, no bathrobes are provided in the room so had to answer the door in my pyjamas. Am glad I hadn't already got into the shower before he came as there would be no way i'd open that door in just a towel. Placed a do not disturb sign on my door, and was awoken by a phone call at 9am from the cleaner asking what time I was planning on leaving so that she could clean my room. The next morning she just walked into my room without even knocking, luckily I was already dressed.

<Title>“Start off your international trip on the right note....book a room at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel near the Airport”
<Content>Traveling to Europe from the West Coast can be very stressful, due to the number of hours you are en route. Most flights out of our home town of San Diego depart around 7:00 am in order to connect to Europe via New York City or other hubs in the East or Mid-West. My husband and I solved the problem of having a sleepless night of worry about getting to the airport on time in the morning. You never do know if traffic will detain you, or if the shuttle or taxi will not show up on time. I think I share the emotions of many readers that you just can't relax before an international trip. Being dead tired before you start that 16-hour+ voyage is definitely not a good idea. This trip to Italy, we decided to book a room at the Sheraton Hotel & Marina, a first-class property that is literally within walking distance of the airport. The hotel offers a complimentary airport shuttle, but you could just as easily walk across the highway to reach the airport, if you are traveling light, as we were. The Sheraton's rooms are spacious, beautifully appointed (see photos), and a night's stay here is oh so very worth the price, all things considered. Spending a leisurely afternoon and evening watching the sun set over the city of San Diego or over the marina at Harbor Island added so much to our pre-trip pleasure. After a lovely seafood dinner, we strolled along the bay, holding hands and relaxing in the glow of a perfect November sunset in San Diego. In fact, we caught the final rays of the sun as we returned to our room, and relished the early morning sunrise that welcomed us the next day. What a wonderful way to begin our memorable trip to Italy!

<Title>“Wonderful Weekend”
<Content>I found this hotel through Travelzoo and booked it through Starwood which I think is the parent company. I got a great deal and was able to pick the Marina tower on a high floor. I read the reviews and I was worried that I wouldn't get what I had booked but that was not the case. The person checking us in was very friendly and helpful! We got a room on the 11th floor facing the marina and bay. It was beautiful! The room was very well appointed and appeared to be recently re-decorated. Some of the reviews had mentioned that they heard the airport noise and people above and below but we did not find this to be the case at all. It was very quiet. We stayed the weekend before Thanksgiving and I had asked how full the hotel was and the desk person said it wasn't full. We had a wonderful time and enjoyed going for a jog along the bay in the morning. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and would definitely suggest the marina tower.

<Title>“Clean but noisy and shifty”
<Content>I stayed with my friend and toddler over Thanksgiving weekend. We were lucky to get a room in the newly renovated building. The room was clean and the view of the marina was nice. This hotel is very large and on this weekend was playing host to a lot of soccer teams. Kids were running up and down the halls until late at night. Apparently this hotel also allows them to stay in rooms without adults as we had the pleasure of rooming next to a few of them. When asked if they could keep it down we got knocks on our door with the subsequent sound of feet running away a few times. To get to our room we had to walk by the hot tub which, though large, was packed with teenagers every night. We didn't care to use it but if you do this may be important. My biggest concern was that upon my return home I discovered missing clothes from my luggage. Clothes that were packed in my suitcase the day before checkout but prior to the last room cleaning. I did not think to look through my luggage again on checkout day. The hotel couldn't do anything for me when contacted by phone and they did not respond to an email. I understand locking up your valuables when you travel but if a traveler has to worry about their clothes a hotel has a serious problem with its staff. Also, there is a $22/day parking fee. They do tell you this up front but in case you weren't paying attention to the details. All in all, no matter how clean the rooms are or how nice the view is (and that is not guaranteed) the stress of wondering when the kids are going to quiet down is just not worth it. And certainly not at the added cost of missing luggage.

<Title>“Make sure you get a bay view, and bring your own wireless”
<Content>I was lucky enough to get a bay view on the 11th floor, and it was amazing! The view, again, saved this hotel. The room was old, the TV was horrible, and there were less than 20 channels, (not counting the hotels 8 travel channels). As with most 4 or 5 star hotels, you get nickeled and dimed to death, parking costs, valet costs, wireless internets costs, and it's not cheap. My boss was traveling with me, and the valet actually lost his keys to the rental car. They did resolve the problem with the rental car company, but I still don't know if they actually found the keys.

<Content>The front desk clerk had an attitude. The valet was condescending and dismissive when I asked him when my car was going to be parked. It was just sitting there and was almost scratched by a big SUV. This occurred at the bay tower. The room had an excellent view of the bay but there is no insulation between floors and walls. You hear EVERYTHING from the people above and the neighbors next to you. This is not a place you would stay on vacation. It's convenient if you have a business event because you are minutes from the hotel. The sofa was dirty and stained.

<Title>“Good value for money”
<Content>All in all a good value for money hotel. We had been travelling for 15 hours straight, so it very nice to know that the hotel was only minutes away. The downside is that you can hear aircrafts taking off from around 6:30am until late in the evening - but I do not think that there are many places in San Diego where you are unable to hear the aircrafts. That aside, the location is actually fantastic. ½ hour stroll and you are in town. Excellent walking or running along the front of Harbor Island. Not too many other amenities, a couple of restaurants, hotels and some small shops. The hotel itself (Marina) was very nice. The room was an adequate size for the family. The extractor fan in the bathroom could be made a bit quieter though. Good amenities. Excellent room service meals. Good restaurant and even a Starbucks (if you like that sort of thing). Staff were very helpful. Swimming pool was a bit cold for my liking, but the jaccuzi made up for that.

<Title>“Good Priceline value, but not a 4 star hotel”
<Content>I was bracing myself after I booked this hotel through Priceline because reviews indicated that Priceline guest only get to stay in the Bay tower. I booked two rooms under different names and one of us was in the Marina and the other in Bay. When we pulled up to the Marina we asked the parking person which tower is better as we wanted to both be in the same tower. The reply was Bay since it is newer and bigger. We said okay and had the other room moved to Bay tower. The front desk said they upgraded us to a higher floor for the view, but the real reason was probably because the hotel was empty. Bay tower is nice, big rooms no prblems. Liked that they had free internet access and provded printers so print out boarding passes, Pool is just average, but since hotel empty it was like having a pool to yourself. I never made it to the Marina tower so I can't compare. But I do want to emphasize that this is not a 4 star hotel. Not sure who is rating it as such. Rooms need to be spotless and there is some wear and tear and dust in the corners. Bathroom needs to be bigger for a 4 star with more water pressure. The room is bigger than the average size room, but no newspaper every morning (automatically delivered) and no turn down service at night. So the most this hotel could be is a 3.5 star hotel. I paid $80 a night through Priceline so great price for a very decent room. Parking at $22 a night sucks since basically it is an empty lot with half the time no attendent, but that's San Diego or any major city! If lite sleeper than the airport nearby will wake you. But overall I would stay again if the price was right.

<Title>“Overall--okay”
<Content>Stayed two nites in Marina Towers (there are two at this property) which had been updated recently. I was leading a two-day conference at the hotel. The rooms are nicely updated. Comfortable bedding, adequate counter space in bath, big shower head in bath (no makeup mirror) and flatscreen TV. Starbucks in the lobby a bonus. Conference room for 25 people had no windows and was dated--not that clean--I had to ask them to vacuum the room. However all request were promptly addressed. The conference breakfast and lunch buffets were very good--fresh food, good choices, good presentation. Great conference staff. Hotel Bar--one dinner--the service on the food was very slow and the food was basically marginal grill fare. Minutes from the airport--would recommend for that reason.

<Title>“Sheraton Marina needs to learn the meaning of customer service!”
<Content>My husband and I went to the Sheraton Marina to celebrate our anniversary. When making our reservation, I was told we could check-in as early as noon since the hotel was not full. We arrived at 3:00pm (1 hour before check-in time) and were told that our room was not quite ready yet. At 4:00 I went back to the desk to remind them we were waiting and they again said our room was not quite ready, but we could switch to a room with 2 smaller beds if we wanted. We finally were given the keys to our room at 5:00 after spending 2 hours waiting in and around the lobby! I wished they could have told us the room wouldn't be ready for 2 hours when we first arrived, and we would have left to do something fun. The next morning, I called the front desk to ask for a late check-out and was told that they could not do that. I reminded them that they kept us waiting when we checked in, and they said we could stay 30 minutes longer. I was very surprised that they didn't even give us coupons for a free drink at the bar to make up for our inconvenience. If they gave us a coupon for free breakfast, I would have been completely satisfied, and I wouldn't be writing this! Other than that, the room was nothing special, except that we had an amazing view of the nightly fireworks at Sea World. The breakfast buffet was delicious, but expensive. San Diego has so many lovely hotels that I don't know how the Sheraton will stay in business if they treat their customers this way!

<Title>“Wonderful Hotel, Very nice but $$$ Parking”
<Content>landed a room here for 2 nights from Priceline for $75/night...place was really nice, and i loved having the Starbucks inside...good news we were put on a high floor, with a Marina view but bad news is we got stuck w/ 2 double beds...of course that's to be expected when booking through Priceline, but my wife and I got over it. It was way nice for the price, so no complaints there. The rooms were very nice, but the room we had was somewhat small. Maybe if it was a king bed it would've felt roomier, but compared to our previous hotel it was a bit tight, but not bad for the 2 nights we were there. The hotels in a very convenient spot to the airport, and is somewhat centralized with the beaches just a few short miles away, and the zoo/downtown about the same distance in the other direction. The beds were VERY comfortable I will say. Out of the 3 hotels we stayed at during the week of our vacation, the beds here were our favorite. I gave this hotel a 4 out of 5 stars because: The 3 biggest downfalls for us was the cost of parking, no free Wi-Fi in the room, & no fridge...for $22/day you'd think you'd get valet, but no valet is $28/day. It’s really pointless to pay for valet when the valet parking lot is right beside the standard lot. I know paying to park is pretty standard in SD, but $22/day is just getting up there. You'd think for that kinda money to park they'd at least give you free Wi-Fi in the rooms, but only place you're getting it is downstairs. For us, using Skype and talking to family on the webcam is quite pointless downstairs in front of everyone! Lol Far as having no fridge, well, you get the mini bar area in the room which costs $$$$ plus it's not even cold so. Not to mention if you DID get caught putting anything in there, they charge a $25 cleaning fee. When traveling I always like having a fridge, but I bought a cooler I brought with me just incase I ran into a room w/o one.

<Title>“Great location and view!”
<Content>This was a great 3-day weekend getaway to fabulous San Diego. The weather was spectacular and the Sheraton was a great location. Close to the airport and right on the harbor. We saw several cruise ships come into the harbor and leave while we staying at the Sheraton. We had a huge room facing the Harbor it was recently updated. Great place to stay.

<Title>“Not for families with young children”
<Content>I was very disapointed in our stay at this hotel. We booked because of the 3 pools, one being a kids pool, and for the water taxi to Seaport Village. Come to find out upon check in that 2 of the 3 pools were closed and the water taxi didn't really pick up at thier hotel! They also had over half of thier elevators under construction, resulting in 10 minute wait to get to and from your room and there are no childrens TV channels offered(nickelodeon) unless you want to pay.

<Title>“Best french fries at Quinns!”
<Content>Stayed two nights here for the DEMO tech conference in September. Room was mid-sized (if size is a priority, try the Sheraton Suites Symphony Hall) but very comfortable. The wired Internet cost $12 a nite and was on the slow side (maybe I'm spoiled with Verizon FIOs at home), which did impede my work. Amenities were great. Each of the two towers has its own, huge gym (very modern equipment) and pool. I had a burger and fries at the bar, Quinns, and I must say they were very good, esp. the fries (fat, creamy, semi-skinned wedges with just the right amount of seasoning). Location is pretty - right on the water near the airport and rental car places - and great if you want to spend a dirty weekend with a sig other and only occasionally emerge to take leisurely walks along the water. You do need to cab into downtown for a broad food selection, though.

<Title>“I was checked in someone else's room by mistake and entered while they were there.”
<Content>After entering an already occupied room with my children (that were worried entire trip if this would happen to us) we had to go down with the ONLY working elevator in that wing of the Marina Tower that took about 15-20 minutes. This time we were given another room. When we went up our key didn't work. While we were going down on the elevator we saw our luggages going down too. The bell boy said it's because he was given yet another wrong room number. After spending over an hour of going up and down finally we settled. The room was nice with a great view. However we were so tired of all this that basically we couldn't do much that day. Now I wouldn't be so upset if they offered something to make up for it however no such gesture was made. They did not even apologized properly. We stayed there numerous times for the convenience of water sports and the view. If I was managing this hotel I would do everything to make up for this sort of inconvenience, So great hotel with not very polite staff. Parking is very expensive. Also for a pet friendly hotel it is strange that she was not allowed at the very casual patio style restaurant by the pool. Because of this we could never dine with entire family. By the way the food was so bad (curry chicken) that I got sick to my stomach. At another trip my husband ended up having the same result with anothert dish. It was surprisingly quiet since it was by the Airport. However since our room was at the end of one wing. We either had to walk a long way to get the main elevators or wait for the only working elevator at our wing that wasted a good chunk of our trip.

<Title>“Excellent hotel, great staff and beautiful views”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews here I was very concerned because I had booked through Priceline. My experience was very different: I was given a deluxe room on the 9th floor of the Bay Tower, which seems to be better for leisure, more relaxed. The staff was great and all very helpful. I am glad I didn't cancel my reservation because I couldn't have asked for better at triple the rate. The only improvement I offered them was to arrange for a shuttle to downtown areas.

<Title>“Enjoyable stay with great views”
<Content>We recently spent three nights at the Sheraton with a room in the Bay Tower. After reading the previous reviews, I had hoped for the Marina Tower, but we had a great rate per night and ended up in the Bay Tower. The shuttle at the airport was prompt, and check-in was a breeze. We were upgraded to a room on the 9th floor in the Bay Tower and the views were great. We actually enjoyed staying in the Bay Tower because it was very quiet, even though we spent a lot of time over at the Marina. We never even saw the pool at the Bay Tower. The fitness center at the Marina is great and the pool is a nice size. There is food service poolside, and our waiter was very good. We did not have breakfast at the hotel, but went to Papanani's every morning next to the marina and enjoyed the views and a good breakfast. We really enjoyed our stay, and there were only a couple of problems. Sheraton needs to change their comforters. They are so HEAVY. It reminded me of a visit to the dentist when they put the lead apron over you before they take x-rays. I can't believe Sheraton has not addressed this. Also, there was a lot of dirt on the decking around the pool. Other than that, we had a very nice time . We would definitely stay here again with a good rate.

<Title>“Okay for couples but not families....”
<Content>The hotel was okay but not as great as some of the reviews I've read. First of all, no kids cable channels(Cartoon network, Nickelodeon, Disney) available which made the evenings a little boring for the little ones. Fortunately, we had a room on the seventh floor with a great view of the harbor and the swimming pool. The swimming pool is very nice and the pool area is relaxing. The food in the pool area is surprisingly good but a bit pricey. But hey, you're on vacation. Also, there wasn't an arcade room which my kids keep asking for. Again, not much for kids to do. The complaint I keep seeing is the Parking. Yes, it is expensive with $22/day for self parking or $28/day valet parking. I opted for the valet parking for the duration of my stay (5 Nights). I soon found out that the valet parking was costing me much more than $28/day with the constant and expected tipping whenever you need your car. If you wanna save, don't go this route since the self parking is a very short walk to the entrance. Overall, the hotel was okay. Didn't expect it to be so close (practically next door) to the airport. I would not stay here again when I cime back to San Diego.

<Title>“Spectacular view”
<Content>Upon checked in, they gave us a traditional room wth a parking lot view even though we paid for a water view room through an online third party service. My spouse called CS then eventually went to the front desk & spoke with a manager. After an hour of "this & that," they transferred us to a different tower, and gave us a bigger room with a beautiful view of the bay & marina. We are very delighted. We don't have any complaint about the service since they brought our luggages to the new room, and the staff are friendly & helpful. The only set back was the parking which is $22.00 per night for self-parking & $28.00 for valet. And, also the beverages in the room were pricey, $5.00 for a small bottled water, and $7.00 for a bottle of Gatorade. My suggestion is bring your own beverages. And, most of all, spend a full day or two in Balboa Park. We will, for sure, next time we go back.

<Title>“Really comfortable, great deal, good food. Fab views”
<Content>I stayed here for two nights on a business trip and it was great. I was in meetings around town/ out of town all day, and the hotel was an oasis of calm at the beginning and end of the day. It is also easy to get to the main autoroutes, so great if you are out on the road. Not having to contend with the city centre traffic is a bonus if you are having meetings up at the science parks. The bed was uber comfortable and I think the best couple of nights sleep I had during the whole two week trip. The view was incredible, the boats, the beach, the sunshine. It was a great start to the day. My room was really comfortable with a nice fresh nautical feel to the decor. Makes a change from the usual corporate dull durge of a hotel chain. The room service was good - usual standard fare - I remember a particularly tasty hamburger! The bars had a good atmosphere and I felt quite comfortable sitting on the terrace of an evening reading my book. I did confuse the restaurant staff at breakfast however - they seemed to have no idea what a soft boiled egg was or how you would cook one. They did give it a couple of attempts though before they admitted that they had no idea what I was asking for. I used the gym/ fitness centre. Nice, new equipment, good entertainment system, nice spa etc. All the towels and robes are provided, as you would expect from a Sheraton, so you dont have to hike lots of stuff around. There's a courtesy shuttle bus to and from the airport, which is good I called through beofre hand to check where I would find it. I woud definitely recommend the place. True, I had a great rate from Expedia which helped and made it all the more attractive.

<Title>“No complaints - Enjoyed my stay”
<Content>We stayed here for 4 nights in August, and I have to say it's a nice hotel. Our room was on the 10th Floor in the Marina Tower overlooking the Bay/Marina/Pool. Every room has a balcony. The other side of the Marina Tower faces the parking lot/downtown. If you're not on a high floor you will not have any view at all. The other Tower was down the street, appeared to be a totally separate hotel and probably was at one time. I used the free internet in the lobby a few times as I forgot my laptop. It was tough to find a computer that wasn't occupied, they were only a few of them and they were busy pretty much all the time. But it was great they had computers for their guests, it was a nice touch. The location was good, but we were glad we had our car for the short drive to Gaslamp, Little Italy and other places downtown. Although this hotel is very close to the airport we hardly ever saw or heard any planes at all. I was pleasantly surprised and would stay at Sheraton again.

<Title>“Great way to end our summer”
<Content>We got a great rate for this hotel and stayed for 3 nights (August 9-12). We had a low floor room with a partial view of the pool. We initially started with a room facing the parking lot but after a quick stop at the desk, we were transferred on the other side with the pool view. The staff is friendly and corteous. Rooms were cleaned meticulously. Best thing about the hotel? starbucks in the lobby (for sleepless parents like us). We had a great time lounging around in the pool. They also have a great fitness facility with lots of activities for families. They rent out bikes, lend out ping pong rackets, a tennis court and everything you could possibly think of. I was able to use their spa service and had an excellent massage. They offer facials too and all services priced reasonably. Their spa is not really the type of spa that you go in to relax but it has more of the fitness club feel with showers and sauna. Hopefully they have a real spa lined up in the future. The only thing I could complain about is the Harbor's edge restaurant, for some reason, someone overlooked the fact that there are no ramps to get to the dining area. This restaurant is off of the main lobby of the hotel and only has steps to lead down to the tables. The hotel must have been aware of this oversite because all the staff are always kind enough to offer to lift the stroller for you. They also forgot to put down a ramp to access the main pool on the marina tower so you have to go around and take the elevator down. By the way, did i mention $22/day for parking? we didnt mind since it's like that pretty much anywhere in San Diego, for the rate that we got, it's still a deal. Other than that, it was a great stay and we will definitely be back.

<Content>The American Society of Civil Engineers Pipeline Division annual meeting is being held here (since Saturday.) 527 registrants. Fire alarm and evacuation yesterday am about 10:00 am, all meeting rooms evacuated, scared hotel guests, etc. Then the fire alarm went off at 4:10 am this am (Tuesday 18th), about the time we had some clothes on they anounced "we have investigated there is no fire", then at 10:30 this am the fire alarm went off for the third time in two days, all meeting rooms evacuated, etc. technical presentations disrupted, Front desk is playing dumb, don't know anything, etc. We will NEVER stay at this hotal again. I can assure you!!! This is the Society's third San Diego meeting in the last twelve years, I doubt if the members will ever vote for THIS hotel again, my wife was terrified here on the 11th floor at 4 am. We are 75 and 76 years young and my wife could never make it down 11 flights of stairs, she is.afraid to go to sleep tonight on this 11th floor.

<Title>“Excellent hotel”
<Content>We spent only one night nut it was enough to say that it's a very nice hotel...The hall and the rooms are very elegant, although not roomy. Increible sightseeing, on one side there is the bay and on the other side the ocean. There is a nice outdoor swimming pool and internet point in the hall.The location is a good for the airport (walking distance) and the bay, but few miles away from San Diego city center. The price wasn't bad, 120 $ for a two double beds room. There is the possibility to park the car, but it's not cheap. It's a very nice hotel, which I'd recommend if not full price

<Title>“Very comfortable with GREAT views!”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego for five days in July as a quick summer get-a-way - I do love this hotel because of the location by the marina and it has more of a resort feel. Being close to the airport was no issue at all - I did't hear any planes! Some say it's too far out but it's only a $8 - $10 cab ride to downtown... we had a rental for a few days though too. Room very nice - clean, modern, bright colors and the bed comfortable. We had a room up very high up facing the marina and overlooking the pool. We enjoyed nice sunset while sipping a beverage on the patio. They have a fabulous pool and hot tub and the food was great at the restaurants. We found Quinns to be somewhat "cold" in feel and atmosphere but the other restaurant was great!!! Plus, they have a huge Starbucks on site. We enjoyed some delicous tapa's one night as well sitting a the lobby bar over wine. We enjoyed out stay and would definately recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Title>“Nice place! Attempt to find a great deal using your "Entertainment Book"”
<Content>My husband and I traveled with another couple and their 6yr old son- stay was 7/16-7/19. Staff was courteous, and friendly upon check in- they also worked so that our rooms would be on the same floor, and near each other. Rooms were very clean, and well appointed- we booked a non-bayview room, that overlooked the parking lot. We called upon the concierges service both nights of our stay, recommendations for Pizza to be delivered, and Mexcian food out the other night. Pizza recommended was Ogi's- simple good pizza, with very efficient staff and very prompt delivery. Mexican Food Restaurant recommended was Miguel's Cocina, on Shelter Island Dr- we all enjoyed our meal, around $10 a plate, and a killer Jalapeno Cheese Dip.... needless to say the concierges desk did a great job. The pool was very nice; although there were some great "fire pit" seating areas along the walkway that looked like a great place to sit and watch the sun go down...they were always full... a very popular spot. :o) The only complaint that we did have is the following: Our room was on the 3rd floor, and there were two elevators, of which only ONE WAS OPERATIONAL THE ENTIRE STAY. We waited OVER 20 MINUTES to get on the elevator, when we were trying to check out the morning of our departure. (We had entirely too many bags to be lugging down the stairs.) We'd overheard a conversation during our stay, from a fellow guest of the hotel, that they'd been there since Tuesday and only ONE elevator had been operational during their stay as well...that was a total of 5 days, of which we were aware of. We did advise the front desk staff, and a "Manager" on duty of the elevator issue- they said they'd look into it....(short for that's nice, go away...) I'm grateful that all the guests in our group were able-bodied, and could handle taking the stairs the other two days of our stay... Overall, a great place to stay, friendly staff, and centrally located to many attactions. :) IF YOU STAY IN THE MARINA TOWER ON THE 3RD FLOOR, MAKE SURE TO INQUIRE IF BOTH ELEVATORS ARE WORKING. :O) **ALSO, BEWARE OF THE PARKING FEE- $22 PER NIGHT FOR SELF PARKING, AND $28 A NIGHT FOR VALET.**

<Title>“Better than expected!”
<Content>After reading some of the reviews on here, I was skeptical. I was booked here for 8 days via work for a conference and it probably would not have been my first choice, that being said, if I was returning to San Diego and had a car rental I would certainly return here again. There are two towers, you want to be in the one with the main lobby and restaurants attached, the other is a short walk away, but still it is a walk. My room was actually in the Lanai wing wich is a 3 story area. I was skeptical of it based on the condition of the hallwyas which are open to the elements, but the room was wonderfully clean, nice bedding and pillows. Colleagues on the first level of the Lanai however reported a musty smell in their room and where nicely moved up to the 2nd floor which was fine. The "fancy" restaurant was a little overpriced, the pub, tapas bar, and outdoor pool bar all had decent food. You definitely need a car to stay here, even the other restaurants on Harbor island are a decent walk away. That being said, if you have a car it is easy access to Point Loma an downtown San Diego. You can get to the Gaslamp, Little Italy, Hillcrest, Convention Center, Harbor attractions and zoo with lots of ease. You can also hop on I-5 quite easily and get any place else you might need to go. There is a fee for parking, so be aware of that. The overall vibe of being right on the water is very nice, I chilled out on the hammocks, near the pool and even near the fire pits outside at night.

<Content>Nice place, staff was cool. But as mentioned before here this is not a 4 star hotel. Three or 3.5 maybe. Dont get me wrong it was cool but not for the regular price. We got an $80 rate via priceline. If your there for the 4th of July it cant be beat, FRONT ROW SEATS! The pool was great. My biggest complaint was the out of this world parking fee of $22 per night. Prices for room service and the pub were pricey.

<Title>“Nice Hotel but Not a Good Location for the Leisure Traveler”
<Content>Although we are San Diego locals, we'll occasionally spend a night downtown and play tourist. We use Priceline to save money and always get right downtown Gaslamp - until now. This time our bid "won" the Sheraton Harbor Island. For our purposes, it couldn't have been a worse location. Not only were we not within walking distance of anything but we had no public transportation options other than a taxi at $25-30 round trip to the Gaslamp. As an added pleasure the hotel charges a $22 to self park. A great example of going broke saving money. Having said that the hotel would be great for the business traveler who just needs an over night stay or has an early morning flight. We stayed in the Bay Tower and our room was clean and nicely updated. We had a harbor facing room which is also the side of the airport. I was concerned the flight noise would be a problem but it really wasn't. I will say though that the toilets flush with such force they could wake the dead! Upon checkin we attempted to get the Marina Tower as it is clearly the better tower in terms of things to do within the hotel but the Front Desk Clerk would have none of that. To her defense, they were full with a teacher's convention but she could have handled our request in a better manner. The Bay tower does have its own pool and fitness center both of which we took advantage. We hit the pool around 4:30pm - the pool attendent was gone as were all the pool towels. The fitness center was capable - the equipment was fairly new and there was enough variety to get in a decent cardio or weight workout. Would like to recognize the Valet attendent who took care of us when we were looking for cheaper parking options. We told him we were not going to park in the hotel and would move the car somewhere else after checkin. After getting settled, we went back down to get the car and he moved it to a free spot that opened up directly across the street. Nice Service!

<Title>“Loved our stay...”
<Content>My husband and I were celebrating our one year anniversary in San Diego and based on reviews on various sites, we decided to stay at the Sheraton San Diego and Marina Hotel. When making our reservation, we let them know we were celebrating our one year anniversary and hoped to get a room in the Marina Tower with a nice view of the marina. Our check-in attendant was kind enough to go above and beyond our request and provided us with a townhouse in the Lanai area which is connected to the Marina Tower. We were SO happy with our stay here. We had a beautiful marina view, the staff was excellent, and the restaurants were great. We enjoyed our stay so much that we did not hesitate to book another night at this hotel after our flight was canceled. It is conveniently located close to the airport and is a short drive to many tourist attractions. Love, love, loved this hotel! Highly recommend!

<Title>“The good start to our too short 4th of July weekend”
<Content>The Sheraton Hotel & Marina exceeded my expectations. We arrived on a 12pm flight and I was worried we'd be waiting around until 3 or 4 to check-in. I had called ahead a couple days and spoke with Melissa. She informed me we could use the pool and enjoy the hotel while we waited if our room was not ready. We were allowed to change in the Spa area and let our kids swim a while. I rented a large blow-up alligator for an hour ($7) that was their highlight. . .we only had it an hour before I received a call on my cell phone that our room was ready (it was shortly after 1pm!) I was very happy for the early check-in and even more happy to find we'd been upgraded to a two-story townhouse room in the Lanai building. The pool rental place let us return the gator and said we could return later to use up the remain hour I had paid for. There were a few downsides. After swimming a bit we arrived to our room barefoot and found the floor was quite damp. I can only imagine it had recently been shampooed. The doors to the outside had about a 2" gap between the bottom and the floor, plenty of room for bugs and such to crawl in but we were lucky and had none. Then there were two balconies. . the wood in dire need of staining and new chairs (current ones were old and dirty). Other then that we enjoyed having the downstairs for out two six yr olds on the pull out couch with their own tv, and my husband and I upstairs in a comfortable king with our own tv. There were two bathrooms, one with a shower/bath, also a coffee maker up and downstairs, and a small fridge and sink. This came in handy when we purchased some grocery items & beverages from Papanani's Deli, located between the Marina and Bay Towers. I highly recommend stopping at the deil. . the hotel charges $6 per bottle of beer and at the deli you can purchase a six-pack for $9, along with tasty sandwiches, cereal, and many other items at a fair price. The kids LOVED the Marina tower pool and the entire family enjoyed the Club Lounge on the Penthouse floor. The lounge was beautifully decorated and a decent variety of snacks in the evening and helpful lounge attendant (wish I had gotten his name - very nice). The breakfast also served in the Lounge the next morning was nicely stocked and plenty of room/quiet while we enjoyed the start to our day. We only stayed one night here (the hotel was full the 3rd & 4th) and after checking out we headed for the US Grant for 2 nights and off to Sea World. All in all we would definitely return to the Sheraton. (hopefully to dry floors, updated balconies/lanai's, and new doors that closed securely).

<Title>“Great Trip”
<Content>My wife and 5 years old just completed a 3 night stay at this hotel. The room was perfect, overlooking the 4th of July fireworks. The service was beyond finer hotels we have stayed at. Everyone was calling me by name, which I think is nice and personal. Whoever is running this hotel is doing a great job and deserves Kudos’s. I can't wait to book another stay.

<Title>“Good but nothing special”
<Content>The location is convenient and the staff are nice enough. Note that parking is around $20 a day. The nautical decor is very clean an fresh and suites the destination well. A couple issues worth mentioning: there was an unpleasant smell in the hallways... Not sure if it's what they use to clean the carpets or something else. Also, there was only one elevator in operation for my wing of the hotel. It sometimes took 15 minutes to get down to the lobby do to this fact. The hot tub was not hot in the morning... Definitely less than 100F. I would stay again but only with a nice discount.

<Title>“Nice hotel - but room rate is just the beginning”
<Content>The room at this hotel was nice, and the price was right using their pre-paid rate. But that was just the beginning of the costs of staying there. Right off the bat there was a $22 a day rate for self parking. Once inside, I felt like they did everything they could to nickel and dime you. The room has the mini bars where as soon as something is picked up, you get charged for it. Don't want to pay for the mini bar? There's a vending machine where everything from a pack of skittles to a snack bag of Doritos is $1.50. Want to buy your own snacks? No problem - except if you want to keep anything cold. If you remove the items from the mini bar, it's a $24 fee for "restocking". Want to use the internet in the room? No problem - but it'll cost you. Want to get off the ground floor? No problem - for an extra $25 a night. Don't want a room facing the airport? That's $20 a night. I have stayed at really high-end hotels and never felt as nickeled and dimed as I did here. I also found that the ceiling was not very sound-absorbing and we could hear everything going on upstairs.

<Title>“Beautiful Hotel - but not for per diem rates”
<Content>This hotel is a 10 minute walk from the airport and a Sheraton shuttle arrives every 15.' The room was apparently deluxe, and seemed standard for the chain. Really beautiful view. Nice bed, very clean room with great housekeeping. What soured the 7 day stay was being declined on access to SPG lounge for continental breakfast because we are gold and not a platinum members, and no upgrade without payment of 28,000 points in a 1/2 empty hotel. The restaurant continental breakfast was 17.95 each, and a single Mojito ( a common drink) was 10.89. No accessable fridge, as any personal food would be removed and a $25 service fee applied. So no milk and cereal. No lower priced food nearer then the airport. so, we used the hotel to sleep and enjoyed leisurely meals in the city.

<Title>“Excellent Hotel---- great location”
<Content>My husband and I went out to San Diego for a week for R&R before he started a new job. This hotel was excellent.. The rooms were very clean and service was exceptional . The staff from the Pool waiter (Rob) to the Breakfast omelet man(Horatio) where very friendly and helpful. The fire pit at night by the bay was very relaxing with a glass of wine. I used the fitness center three times and everything worked and was in excellent condition.We ended up touring every morning, it is only a 10 minute ride to the zoo, old town, mission and ocean beaches, gaslamp,and sea world. We also hiked at Torey pine state park and visited La Joella . One day we drove to the dessert and hiked Palm oasis canyon hike and hike at state park in the mountains where the Ceder fire was still very evident.. The hotel was so centrally located to everything. The only thing we didn't do was go to Mexico.. They said it was too dangerous there for Americans. I would highly recommend this hotel.. now it's back to work in Pittsburgh... It was JUNE GLUME in San Diego but we had a great time.

<Title>“Couldn't have had a better stay”
<Content>We visited the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for the second time (June 20 - 24) and stayed in one of the charming Junior Suites in the Bay Tower. We had a wonderful direct view of the bay and all rooms in this tower come with a balcony and view of either the bay or the Marina. We consistently found the rooms to be maintained well, kept clean, the staff polite, friendly and very accomodating to special requests. This was our wedding anniversary and the Management Staff made it a special event. Now, iff the weather had just been as nice as hotel, this would have been the perfect visit. Be prepared to pay for parking.

<Title>“Request the MARINA tower!! BAY tower = no amenities!!!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego last weekend (June 5-7, 2009) and thought it was great. First, let me explain to you that they have two "towers" the Bay tower and the Marina tower. The towers are actually two separate hotels connected by an outside walkway. It takes about 5 minutes to walk from one to the other. The Marina hotel is DEFINITELY the nicer hotel and has all the amenities. Second, the hotels are very close to the airport and offer a FREE SHUTTLE to and from the airport. We did not rent a car the entire trip. We were given a room in the BAY tower (so for the purpose of this review, I will be grading the Bay tower), which was nice, but there were no amenities. We were notified at check-in that the pool and hot tub in the Bay tower would be closed until June 14 at least, but that we could walk over to the Marina hotel and use that pool. The room was nice...it had a nautical-themed decor. We had an excellent view of the marina and all the boats out our patio door. The comforter was down or something like that, but it made crinkly noises when you moved or rolled over. Also, there was no public computer to use, again that was located in the Marina tower. We had to go over there to check e-mail because we didn't bring our laptop. I think the Bay tower had wireless internet if you have your laptop with you. The spa and fitness center were also located in the Marina tower along with bicycle rentals and various other activities. The location was great though. There is a shuttle pick up near the hotel that can take you to Sea Port Village for the Trolley tour. We actually walked the 3 miles to Sea Port Village because the weather was nice (or you can rent bikes from the Marina tower). Overall the Bay tower was nice because we didn’t mind walking over the Marina tower, but in the future I will be sure to stay in the Marina tower.

<Title>“Incredible Experience at the Sheraton San Diego!”
<Content>I was completely impressed with the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina! I felt like I was staying at an exotic resort, but in actuality I was a stone's throw from the hustle and bustle of downtown San Diego! The staff was friendly and hospitable. They also informed me the hotel just went through a $35 million dollar renovation, and I could DEFINITELY tell! Each room had a beautiful view and incredible mahogany furnishings. I would without a doubt recommend the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina to anyone traveling to SD!

<Title>“Nice place, near the airport”
<Content>Stayed here for 2 nights to end our California vacation. Staff was very friendly. I requested an early check-in, and also requested the Marina tower (thanks to tips from TripAdvisor). Both were granted immediately with no questions or hassles. The Marina tower is definitely the place to be ... restaurant and nicer pool are there, although I did hear others say the Bay tower rooms are larger. Our room was about what we expected ... very clean with a great view of the pool and Marina. The beds were a little smaller than what we're used to however. My kids loved the large pool and hottub ... the pool is much larger and nicer than I would normally expcect at a hotel. It was cool during our stay, so the outdoor heating kiosks in the pool area were also nice. The hotel is also very near the airport. I returned my rental car the night before we checked out. The airport car rental return is literally across the street ... I walked about a quarter mile back to the hotel. The only negatives to this place are the cost of parking ($22/night) and the prices at the restaurant. The breakfast buffet was $22 for adults and $10 for kids. The only other place to eat within walking distance is a small cafe between the towers next to the marina, and they only serve breakfast and lunch. Also, no frig or microwave in the room, so it's difficult to bring your own food. Overall, however, this was a very nice hotel.

<Title>“Convenient for an early morning flight”
<Content>I got a room upgrade at the time of check-in. Our reservation was for the Marina Tower, lower floor, balcony, with limited view. the room we were given was on the 10th floor, facing the marina, a pretty view. we stayed only one night, mainly because we had a 6:35am flight. The hotel provides shuttle service to the airport that starts at 5am. It was a bit rushed for us, traveling with two young children. The room was nice, bright, and cozy. my main complaint, and unfortunately it would cause us not to stay again is that the blanket is made of some material that you can hear when the person's moving, and my kids' did a lot of tossing and turning, so i didn't get a good night's rest. We had dinner on site, forgot the name of it, it's the casual one. the food was good, so was the service. Even though the hotel is right next to the airport, we didn't hear anything from take-off or landing.

<Title>“Great deal”
<Content>My mother and I stayed in this hotel for one night and I was pleasantly surprised by it. We stayed in a double-bed room in the bay tower (it's really a separate hotel you drive down the road to) and had a great view of the marina. The room was just as it looks on the website, the beds were comfortable, and everything was clean. The only downside was the bathroom: the tub was peeling, the towels were rough and worn out, and the floor was in need of repair. But considering we only paid $99 (plus tax and $22 for parking), I couldn't care less. The airport is directly across from the hotel, but the noise didn't bother us at all. This hotel is a great deal and a short drive from downtown.

<Title>“BOOK IT - Exactly as pictured on website!”
<Content>We just returned from a 4 day stay in room 555 at the Marina tower. It was exactly as pictured on the web site - very nautical and appeared to be recently remodeled. It was very clean and quiet. The room was a little smaller than a standard room but had a wonderful balcony with table and chairs. The bathroom was spotless and had been remodeled in the latest "spa" style. Our beds were extremely comfortable. We had a Starbucks in the lobby - a great convenience! But also discovered "Papa's" restaurante on the walk over to see the Bay tower. It is a GREAT little inexpensive place to get your breakfast or lunch. It even had a really nice outdoor seating area that was directly on the marina (we will definitely make this our breakfast place on our return trip). Don't bother with the hotel restaurant for breakfast - way overpriced. The food in the sports pub was awesome and a very comfortable space for gathering with our family for a drink - it has a great view of the marina. The hot tub pa and pool were beautiful. Unfortunately, the spa was not open during our stay. The only disappointment was how the staff handled the situation with the spa.They kept saying it was open - when it wasn't and never apologized for the inconvenience. They also had two fire pits with rocking chairs around it which were a huge hit with guests at night. The Bay tower is much smaller but a more direct view of the bay. It just didn't have that "vacation resort" feeling as much as the Marina tower. Free shuttle service was very efficient and reliable. The view from the hotel is spectacular and location to the airport couldn't be better for travelers. Overall, it was a fabulous stay and I will definitely return again. PS- this room was booked through a 3rd party internet company and I paid $79/night - a GREAT deal for such a beautiful spot. In a phrase.....Book it, you'll love it!

<Title>“Bad Customer Experience from Booking Rep”
<Content>I haven't stayed here yet but I decided to book elsewhere because of the bad experience from a booking representative at the hotel (Dena Crump). On the spg.com website, they advertised they will match the price +10% off if their price is higher than somewhere else. I had found a lower price on Expedia and was able to get this deal for a Club Room from spg. However, when I tried to book 2 more Club rooms Dena refused to honor this price, stating that the price on the web site is $99 for a basic room, the price for the Club Room is $50 more, which is the same as the price on Expedia. I repeatedly told her that spg.com states a price of $209 for the Club Room, it doesn't state $99 + $50 for the Club Room. She refused to acknowledge the price posted online. I could have booked the rooms on spg.com and appeal to spg for a price match but I was fed up with this booking representative that I decided to just cancel and went somewhere else.

<Title>“Relaxing Stay!”
<Content>I stayed in the Bay Tower for one night, booked by a travel agent for a conference I was attending. I really enjoyed my stay. I arrived at around 10 AM due to an early flight having worked through the night before boarding the plane. I was planning on just checking my bags and going out to explore the city. Amazingly, they had a room available and I was laying in the bed within minutes of arriving. It was great to spend the day resting. The room does have an interesting layout but it works well. Room feels spacious and was quite clean. One of the unique aspects is that each room has a balcony. Mine faced the marina and airport but I still appreciated the fresh air and sunlight. Loved the pool with the best aspect being that some of the lounge areas are semi-covered in case you do not want a lot of sun. I was able to comfortably nap by the pool without fear of burning myself. It is only a mile or so from the airport but I was not bothered by any noise even though my room faced the airport. If you are a light sleeper, it may be an issue for you. Try asking for a room facing the harbor. This location is not ideal for tourist activity. It is about a $15-20 cab ride to the Gas Lamp District if that gives you an idea. The staff were very friendly and eager to please. They were readily available with dining or entertainment options. I had a great stay at this location and would consider staying there again. However, if I was in San Diego to have fun and see the sights, I might find something a little closer to the action.

<Title>“Staff were disappointing”
<Content>The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina, is a beautiful place. However, we were very let down by the staff. We checked in late, after earlier ringing them to say that we would be late. Our booking had been made over the internet and on our arrival at San Diego train station we took a taxi to the address on our internet booking reference. This took us to the main hotel close to the Marina. We were ignored by the staff when we rang the bell for service, even though we could hear them saying that they could see that people were at the desk (this is around 1am). We then got told off by the women who greeted us telling is that our booking was for the "Bay tower" hotel not the marina side and that we should have gone to the other hotel. We explained that we had come to the address that we had been provided by the internet booking agency, and she said "well they wouldn't know what room we have put you in" (not very helpful). She did check us in and give us what she said was a great room on the 11th floor of the bay tower. We ended up having to walk to the bay tower (about 6mins around the Marina - not a big deal but rather inconvenient at that time in the morning). Our room was great it had an excellent view of the Marina and provided everything it said it would. The only thing was that it didnt appear to have used recently and we can only assume hadnt been cleaned (dusted and the like) because of that. The drinking glasses were dirty and the above the shower had some mould. (These were both rectified the next day before we had a chance to talk to the staff about them.) We had further disappointing experiences with the staff when we tried to print out our tickets for a tour that we were to do that day, their printer wouldnt work, at the business centre. We asked if it was possible to get the front desk to print the tickets and were told that as we could have booked the tickets through them they wouldn't print them out because we didnt use them to get the tickets. But were were told that they would happily provide us with tickets themselves, if we paid for them again. We also used the pool while we were there - this was great - however once there were know towels left by the pool, so we asked for some and were told that "its not my job, try the gym" after wandering around to get to the gym there were no full size towel provided there only hand towels. The staff could not have cared less.

<Title>“OK Room, Great Club Perks”
<Content>I've stayed at this Sheraton a few other times all in the Marina Tower, after a large charity event I coordinated in May of 2007 and again in May of 2008. The first room I stayed in was a Marina tower deluxe room with a great view of the marina. That was my favorite of the 3 I have been in, especially after the long night before. It was great sitting out on the balcony with a cup of coffee. Stay 2 was a also a deluxe room, and just as nice, although the view of the parking lot wasn't as nice as that of the marina. If you are staying for leisure, I recommend paying the extra for a marina view. I think it's worth it. During stay 3, we were given a club room, but ironically I enjoyed the deluxe rooms better. We originally reserved a king deluxe, but upon arrival were told we were upgraded to a club room. However, they gave us a double bed room. I just think it's strange having an extra, empty bed there. They must have been remodeling as well, which I hadn't seen any signs of in my previous stays. They were redoing the wallpaper on the floor we were on, which is fine, but there weren't any "pardon our mess signs" or taped off areas, so it just looked a little shabby, unlike the rest of the hotel. We did get a chance to have breakfast in the club lounge and that was fantastic. The lounge is beautiful and the breakfast was nice, albeit it being a hyped up continental breakfast. Overall, I've been pretty happy with Sheraton hotels. I recommend getting room service and ordering their seafood melt sandwhich. mmmm. This particular hotel has great catering and an executive chef, and I have been pleased with the large scale events I have held there as well. The staff are very courteous and attentive. Oh, and it's GREAT having a starbucks in the hotel as well. :) I'm hoping next time I have a chance to enjoy the hotel's other amenities.

<Title>“Couldn't believe our luck”
<Content>We flew in from the UK to LAX then drove down to San Diego, it took about 23 hours so we weren't impressed when the check-in guy told us we were not going to be in the main building but had to go to the Bay Towers (we had lots of luggage and very tired kids at 4 and 12), but it was the first time I'd booked on Hotwire so wasn't sure what to expect at $90 a night, he told us we had a nice room on the 12th floor with a good view so we repacked the car and drove the short drive to the correct building, we headed striaght for the elevator and were a little surprised to not see a button marked "12", just 1 thru 11 and "P" which we imagined to stand for parking, but we pressed it anyway and were astonished the doors opened on the penthouse level and our "room with a good view" turned out to be the Sunset Suite with a private roof terrace that was even bigger than the room. We could not fault the hotel in anyway, the staff were friendly and enormously helpful and the pool and fitness room were excellent, and all for 90 dollars a night, congratulations Sheraton and god bless Hotwire...

<Title>“Two Hotels in One.”
<Content>All the action, including the fancy pool, the restaurants, the bar, the starbucks, the concierge are in the main hotel. If you are bringing kids or want a lively scene, you must get into the Marina side. 300 yards away is the bay side, which is quiet. Small pool, small fitness room, small gift shop, small lobby, no crowds. I personally liked being able to work out or swim by myself, but it is a matter of personal preference. (And it is not that big of a deal to walk to the main hotel, esp. in San Diego weather.) The food in Quinn's, the hotel bar and pub, was outstanding.

<Title>“Don't get pushed to the pink palace!”
<Content>We stayed 2 nights at the Sheraton overlooking the harbor. Nice room. We booked on Priceline & maybe that's why we were next to the remote elevator. Only one of the two main elevators was working so the remote was much more active than usual, but it wasn't too bad. Our room did have a great view and the staff, particularly the parking valets were very friendly & helpful. Parking is $20/day or $28/day valet. We chose valet and only tipped once when we left ($20, he seemed happy, I hope they pool).

<Title>“Hotel Was Great, Easily Surpassed Expectations Based on Prior Mixed Reviews”
<Content>My girlfriend and I spent 6 nights at this Sheraton property for a conference downtown. The reviews were mixed so we weren't sure what to expect. However, after spending nearly a week there, we had nothing to complain about whatsoever and really enjoyed our stay. First, I'll address the negatives from other reviews. We found the staff to be very friendly. The concierge was very helpful, the front desk upgraded us to a 9th floor marina view even though we got a great deal via a Priceline bid. The restaurant staff was solid too. (Scott, the bartender at the lobby (Tapatini) bar was excellent). Even the housekeeping staff was friendly and had smiles on their faces. The airport noise did not bother us. When we had the balcony door open we heard a few planes during our stay, but not too many and it wasn't that loud. Unless you plan on staying on the property all day, this really shouldn't be an issue. The hotel is right by the airport, so it is not as central to attractions as it could be. We knew this going in and planned on using cabs to get downtown (both for our conference and to eat in the Gaslamp District and check out Seaport Village). The parking rates are high (more than $20/night), so we figured a 10 minute cab ride downtown (about $10)would be worth it and it was. There is a cab stand at the hotel and that way you don't have to worry about parking, etc. We did stay in the main (Marina) tower. The Bay tower is about a 5 minute walk down the marina, so I can understand why people staying there would be a bit inconvenienced, as the main restaurants are in the Marina tower. About two-thirds of the rooms are in the main tower. The hotel was renovated in late 2008 and it really looks great, inside and out. We had a great stay. While the Bay tower might be too far away for some (the PapaNani's deli is a hidden gem for good casual/cheaper food and snack and is located on the path between the towers), the other complaints about this property seemed unfair, at least based on our 6-night stay there. We would definitely come back, even if we had a car and had to pay $20-$25 a night to park it (we are talking about San Diego after all, parking is never cheap in places like that).

<Title>“Great location and hotel!”
<Content>We really enjoyed are stay at the Sheraton. We got a great deal though. I don't know that I'd want to pay $200 a night, plus parking and internet though. We stayed in the Bay Tower. It is like another hotel, seperate from the Marina Tower, and has it's own check-in desk. There is quite a bit of distance between the 2 of them. The bay tower is smaller than the marina tower. There was plenty of parking at the Bay Tower, and it was $22 a day, or $28 for valet. The room was nice enough, and we had a great view of the bay, downtown, and Coronado Island. I would say this tower has a better view. The beds were comfy, and they had lots of comfy pillows too. The bathroom was small, but the shower worked well. Towels were not the best. The internet was $11.95 a day, and it was on the slow side. The mini-bar is expensive and if you move something in it, you will be charged, although they did take the charge off my bill, with no problem. Being close to the airport, I did not hear the airplanes at all.

<Title>“Nice view for airport hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed for one night post cruise and were pleased for the one night with a Priceline pick. We needed a place close to cruise terminal, airport and with a nice pool and the hotel filled the bill. It is out of the way for exploring San Diego. We did not have a car, parking cost were not an issue, and a machine for printing the boarding passes for next morning's flight is in the lobby, as are computers that are availabel free of charge of 45 minuits. Came in handy. The pool is very nice, but cement is falling and towels are had in the fitness room. We had fun later the afternoon watching the ship sail by for it s next cruise. Used the balcony a lot, it had chairs

<Title>“Great hotel but a few notations”
<Content>The Sheraton is literally across the street from airport and by most accounts is a higher end hotel with business personal in mind but Sheraton is actually a gem for families as well, now, there is the main hotel building which sits across the airport and harbour overlooking boats, and then around the corner the bay tower which is in my opinion the better option jutst based on the fact it overlooks the ocean! So nice the balcony i great, pool hot tub although not working properly as far as heat during our stay was impeccably clean. Free starbucks coffee in the room and the beds you cannot beat.......you need a car if you want to go out to eat or sightsee. The hotel does charge 22 a day for self parking but truth be told all hotels in this area do that. The only complaint i have is the bathroom is very small and was not very clean hair on the ground tub was not as clean as i would have hoped....but the room itself very clean.Beware no fridge no microwave and the in room mini bar is ultra sensitive so dont touch it or the sensors charge your room for snacks you didnt eat....but they were gracious and quick to take off the charges that were invalid. I was able to do early check in and front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Thanks for a pleasant stay love the Sheraton...

<Title>“wouldn't stay again”
<Content>Very close to airport which was helpful. Checked in at Marina Tower. Young guys standing around that let customers also stand around. Room in Bay Tower which feels like staying at a budget hotel. Scratchy old generic white bath towels. Only enough for one shower (one set each). Nice bath products. Bathroom clean but so crowded. Small bathtub. I did like the bed and there were lots of pillows. View of the marina which was nice. We didn't mind the airport noise because we are pilots of a small plane, but it was frequent and loud. Not sure a non-pilot would be happy with that. No WiFi in the tower. Had to use an ethernet cable with my laptop. $12/day for internet that is slow. Couldn't watch internet videos because connection so slow. That really annoyed me. Restaurants had pretty good food but average service. Overpriced for what you get. Either lunch or dinner always $45 or more without liquor. Conference facilities fine. Long walk between the two towers which is nice for the most part. I will be back in SD for another conference in Oct. and will not plan to stay here.

<Title>“Adequate”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel for a meeting. The room and the facilities are nice. Be aware though that the hotel has 2 towers and they are NOT close to one another so if you are staying for a meeting ask to be in the tower where the meeting rooms are ( I believe it's the Marina tower). As far as airport noise I didn't hear it. I walked from the hotel to downtown, it's a 45 mins easy walk, there is a nice sidewalk that goes all round the bay, lots of people jogging and riding bikes so pretty safe. Didnt eat at the restaurants or used the pool, but my room was right in front of the pool and looked nice. You can walk to the hotel from the airport, it's right in front of it, 5 min walk. I didn't have any luggage with me so had no problem, but the hotel provides a free shuttle back and forth from the airport, but again it's extremely easy to get to it just by following the sidewalk.

<Title>“Our Family truely enjoyed this hotel”
<Content>We live in Vegas and love checking out the hotels here for a night away. This time we went to san diego for a 5 day extended weekend. The hotel is very nice, and we loved the view. The staff was very nice, and there response to our requests were unbelievably quick. We were disapointed that the hotel we stayed in was actually around the corner and down the road from the pics that we reviewed on their site. Also, my husband became ill and we had to check out on the 15th instead of the 16th. When I went to the desk to check out at 8:30 am I didn't ask for a refund since we had pre paid thru the 16th, instead I was informed that I would be charged 100.00 for early check out. They had the room paid for through the next day and they still charged us 100.00. above that to check out early. I know I am repeating my self here, and I did with them too. they just explained that it was only a hundred dollars. So if you stay and pay ahead of time for the stay, don't check out early. Other than this we love this hotel, and it centrally located to lots of family fun things to do!

<Title>“Nice, but so, so loud”
<Content>So much noise at this place, not just the airport noise, as noted and thus expected, but also from the marina, dozens of boats running all night. If you are so fortunate enough to be upgraded to a "marina view" room, refuse it, it is some sick joke or curse which Starwoods must be playing on its most valuable customers. Freaking miserable to stay here, absolutely miserable - bring ear plugs, good ones. The room is otherwise fine, though, and the service friendly. If they would put in a decent sized bathtub and then make thicker doors on their marina view rooms it could be quite a nice place. As it is? Don't stay here. The fitness center and outdoor area are, by the way, absolutely baller.

<Title>“Very nice hotel, but service levels going down”
<Content>The rooms at this hotel have recently been renovated, and are quite nice. The location across from the San Diego Airport is very convenient, and it is a 10-minute ride to downtown, the Gaslamp District, and to the Convention Center. Also a great location if you are visiting the Navy facilities on Pt. Loma. I have stayed at the hotel a number of times over the past 12 months, and generally have had a very positive experience. The exercise room is terrific based on the facilities found in most hotels. There has, however, been a distinct downgrade in the level of service provided. Specifically, the restaurant no longer offers menu service for breakfast - it is buffet only. The buffet is probably better than average, but it is getting a bit pricey at $21.00 per person. We gave up the convenience and went elsewhere for the ability to order off the menu, and at least attempt to stay within our per diem limits. The hotel has also discontinued the newspaper service, so no more USA Today at the door when you get up. To be fair, free copies of newspapers are made available in the lobby area, but you are out of luck if you like to have a cup of coffee and browse he paper in your pajamas in the morning. I also did not receive a bill under my door at the end of my stay. This may be because it would not fit under the door with the new carpet in the room, or it may be an additional cutback in service. It was unclear to me which. Parking is also getting pricey - $22.00 per day to park your rental (or personal) car. The soundproofing is good. Aircraft departing were not terribly noticeable.

<Title>“Bad location, def NOT 4*”
<Content>We got 2 rooms from Priceline. Since PL group downtown and harbor island together, we got this hotel which is on the harbor island, middle of no where. If you're looking for a downtown SD hotel, don't book thru PL. By the time we got there, they told us our rooms are in Bay tower. It's even farther down away from everything. The rooms are decent, with the marina view, which is ok. The Bay tower doesn't have anything in the lobby, except for a small sitting area. It definately doesn't feel like a 4 star hotel. Like everyone else said, $22 for self park is too much. We had valet, which is nice cuz they kept your car there at the front the entire stay we were there. We were bothered by the airplane noise, it's actually quite loud. Don't book this hotel unless you want to be next to an airport and nothing else.

<Title>“It was so much more than I had expected.”
<Content>I came with my boyfriend, and my two best-friends for a nice night away on January 31. We stayed in separate rooms (my boyfriend and I in one, and my best-friends in another). I read the reviews online, and saw several bad reviews on the Bay Tower, so we requested the Marina Tower. It was absolutely gorgeous. My best-friend's room was room 625. It overlooked the city, which was a very beautiful view. There was also a small view of the bay to the right. There were no problems with being by the airport. They said it was great watching the planes pass by, and they had absolutely no problems with sound. My boyfriend's and my room was 932. It was a water [bay] view, which cost a little bit more, but it was all worth it. The hotel room was peaceful and clean although we could hear our neighbors walking in and out of their room. Our view was perfect. In front, we oversaw the port in which there were hundreds of boats docked. Below us we could see the pool. We ate dinner at Harbor's Edge located in the hotel. It was nice and romantic with splendid food of all sorts and wonderful service. All rooms have their own, private balconies. The sliding glass doors are wonderful because you can see out of them, but no one can see in. The only flaws I would say there are include the size of the rooms. They are pretty small, and so are the bathrooms. And also the parking fees - $28 per night for valet, and $23 per night for personal parking. We used valet, and it all worked out find for us.

<Title>“Basic three star with some nice marina views”
<Content>This is a very ordinary property with some pretty marina views as well as an airport very close by. The staff was actually a huge turn off at check-in. An employee, Lorna, who was checking me in informed me that she could not give me credit for our hotel stay with Starwood because my husband's last name was different from mine even though we were both staying in the room.She was actually quite assertive and almost provoking an argument at check-in about it but I just didnt,have the time to answer. Further, the bellman had to tell her that my husband was actually there and that he had seen him because she wanted him to personally come to the desk when I was checking in. I have stayed many times at St. Regis and other Luxury Collection properties and neither of these things has never been an issue. I really was too busy with the meeting I was attending to spend time on this so I had to let it slide and take care of what was there for. Room service was a little better than a three star. I would only stay there again if I had a meeting on property.

<Title>“Great value at $99 a room. Beautiful room and view.”
<Content>If I'd read the reviews on this site I would never have stayed but having missed my flight, I just wanted the closest hotel until the next day - and at $99 I thought it would be average. I got a beautifully appointed room and very nice bathroom. Great bed, desk, flat screen TV, coffee maker and a beautiful view of the marina. Despite other reviews, once the sliding door was closed, I couldn't hear the aiport. At the $99 rate I got which was available on their website as well as hotels.com this was a killer deal and I was very happy. Shuttle to and back from the airport was good also.

<Title>“Beautiful view of Bay - great hotel.”
<Content>We arrived on a cool, windy, crisp day for a three day stay - the sky was gray blue and we were able to upgrade in the bay building to the 10th floor (the view of the bay was incredible from the balcony). The main restaurant and gym is located 5min away in the marina bldg - exit the hotel and it's a strait shot along the marina/water/boats which was a very pleasant walk. The harbors edge restaurant had great food and great waitors. The only issue I had was when we first checked in and was given the choice of valet parking and "self parking". The staff made self parking out to be free, and unfortunately we found out on our last day that "Self Parking" is $22 a night. This was quite a deflator, as our long weekend at the Sheraton had been perfect to that point. I would understand a flat fee for parking, but robbery is how i feel this played out. When i asked the customer service lady about the charges she tossed away all responsibility by saying "the parking service isn't a part of the sheraton". Maybe this should be the first statement out of their mouths when a guest checks in so they can find somewhere less expensive to park. Or maybe the Sheraton should just offer free self parking.

<Title>“Clean rooms, poor internet connection, poor $ management”
<Content>The facility itself was very nice and the location is ideal: very close to the airport (noise didn't bother me) and the marina. I was there for business and had major problems conducting my work given their very poor Internet connectivity. They never resolved the issue in my room and could only offer to change my room. The connection in their lobby was poor: very slow and then they would block your computer after one hour. Even their computers were slow. When their "engineer" came to the room (unannounced), his call to a 1-800 number was charged to our room ($2)! I was also irritated when after I checked out, all Internet access for me was blocked within 2 hours (my last name didn't match the current visitor to my room). Couldn't they just extend the Internet access for a couple of hours?! Another co-worker had to change her room due to a water leak. This is a lot for $240 per night. I have no inclination to return.

<Title>“Avoid It Like The Plague!”
<Content>Stayed for 3 nights for a conference. Very close to the airport and you could hear the airport noise almost non-stop. When complained, I was told by the lady at the reception that this was the first time she's heard of such a complain. Well, she must not have worked there very long! In addition, there was also constant construction noise from 9 - 5. Apparently renovation was being done on the 10th, but could be heard on all floors. The shower was moldy. The bed was soft and lumpy. The carpet made you want to keep you shoes on 24/7. On my last day, they checked someone else into my room. Their explanation for the mix up was that the housekeeper informed them that I had left. Never mind that my luggage was still sitting in the middle of the room.

We upgraded to a club level room and thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary club floor appetizers in the evening and the buffet breakfast the following morning. We had a room overlooking the pool, marina and bay - it was fabulous. Our room had recently been remodeled and it was great. The bed was heavenly - very comfortable. The hotel is right near the airport, but it must be pretty well sound-proofed, because we were not at all bothered by air traffic noise. We would stay here again.

<Content>My car was broken into at this Sheraton property. The cost for repairs was over $2500. Sheraton employees acknowledged that this is a 'high crime area.' And they knew that a rowdy bunch from a wedding party were causing trouble that night. Yet they provided no security to prevent the burglary. Although the lot has a Sheraton sign, and the parking is paid on the hotel room bill, Sheraton claims the lot is owned by a company called 'Mile High.' After repeated inquiries, both Sheraton and Mile High have failed to take any responsibility for my loss.

<Title>“Not bad-pricey for what you get”
<Content>Stayed 5 nights attending a conference in mid-Sept. I was lucky enough to get a recently renovated room but travelled with a colleague who wasn't - less than impressive. My balcony overlooked San Diego skyline and the bay which was nice. Room was clean, comfortable but drastically over-priced...this is not a resort by any means. Mini fridge would have been nice. My biggest problem here, and for all you Canadians out there READ THIS!! Let me set the stage here...Now I was on a business trip to Phoenix last April for 8 days and of course you call home (especially with wife and 2 young kids). Work pays for some but I knew I would have to cover some costs...total for 8 days of phone charges in Phoenix was $220 which to me, was reasonable. So here I am in San Diego, granted a bit further West but not that much. Of course I call home from my room 2-3 times a day for a few minutes and this for 5 days..not 8. The night before checking out I go to the front desk to get my total....are you ready for this? $656.00 in long distance charges!!! Work ain't paying for this one. Most of my calls were for 2- 5 minutes. I have 4 charges of $19.19 for calls I made where I got the answering machine, almost $80 and I spoke to know one. So $20 for the first minute and $5 dollars/min thereafter. I found my old Phoenix bill to compare and I had spoken 22 minutes more on that trip which, may i remind you, only cost me $220 in phone charges. Not sure who is making a killing here but someone is!

<Title>“Standard Hotel But Served its Purpose”
<Content>I stayed here for 2 nights when this hotel had a great promotion, so I feel I definitely got my money's worth. I don't like the $20 daily parking fee but that is pretty standard in large cities in California (San Fran hotels can charge up to $50 a day!). I had a marina building room, 6th floor, facing the marina. Nothing too exciting but better than looking at a parking lot on the other side of the hotel. I never went to the bay view building but I think that the views in that building are better since they are on water vs the marina building being surrounded by boats. The hotel is well taken care of- the pool, fire pits, and restaurants looked very nice though I didn't patron any of these. I did use the fitness center- which is one of the better hotel gyms I have used- spacious with everything a gym should have, with newer equipment The Starbucks in the lobby was very convenient, as was the computer center in the lobby where I printed out my boarding pass for my flight (no charge). The room could have used a fridge and the phone in my room had a horrible connection (even just to the front desk was just static) but besides that, no complaints.

<Title>“Awesome Experience”
<Content>My friend and I stayed here while attending Comic-Con this summer. I was apprehensive, because I had heard horror stories regarding hotel rooms booked through the official Con site, and our flight was arriving at 10 AM, a whole 5 hours before check-in. We decided to head to the hotel early anyways, to see if they could at least hang onto our luggage for us. I really shouldn't have worried. Even though I arrived at eleven, they were able to check me right in. They even let me change the room to two beds instead of one! The room was gorgeous, overlooking both the pool and the ocean. It was clean, it was trendy, and it had a minibar which was a fun perk. My only complaint would be the scratchy towels. At one point, I actually opted to air-dry. We ate in both the pub and the Harbor Side restaurant. The food was excellent in both places. It was a little on the pricey side, but that was to be expected. The pool was great, too. I don't know if it was open all night, but I was down there about midnight and nobody bothered us. We stayed five nights altogether, and I was so bummed to leave. I would love to go back sometime.

<Title>“Nice view, 'average' Sheraton”
<Content>We have been to San Diego many times and tend to stay on Shelter Island - but things were pretty booked, so we opted for the Sheraton on Harbor Island. I had been there before for business conventions (just during the day, but was not booked into the Sheraton) and it had been fine. We stayed in the 'bay' tower, which is a bit of a hike from the main hotel [You may want to ask which building you are in prior to arriving]. The room was 'ok', a bit worn ... slightly noisy when the neighbors got loud. The view was wonderful, but make sure you get the bay side, not the marina side. We arrived real late (due the the flight) around midnite - major disappointment was that there is no room service between midnite and 6am, so we had to scrounge the fast food places a few miles away for dinner. There is a small restaurant and bar in the building, but they did not seem to be open late either. We did try room service prior to leaving - the waiter was extremely nice, the food was average. Staff was nice, but sometimes the 'operator' would take 2 minutes or so to answer, even during the daytime. Could be due to the fact that they were having a large number of weddings there for that weekend, which may have absorbed all of the staff time. Maybe the main, vs. the 'bay' hotel property has less issues. Although they have one free computer in the lobby for internet (it worked about 90% of the time), it was a drag to have to pay $11-$12 per day for internet access in the room. Seemed that there were a number of 'per day charges' (parking, etc. - which they seemed to waive for us as we are Sheraton club members - bet we did pay about $10/hr 'late check out' charge [it was our choice to stay later, due to a late flight back and they were very up front about the cost]). Although the hotel is right across the road from the airport, we did not notice a lot of airplane noise, which was very surprising. As we left, the staff even brought our car around, even though we did not 'valet park' - a nice touch. We might stay again, but would if our preferred hotels on Shelter Island were not available.

We booked a regular room with a minimal view, but we had guests visiting us from France and the hotel employee gave us a free upgrade to a room with a view of the Marina. He was a very nice man and the hotel was great. The view was very beautiful. I would definitely recommend staying here. We did not hear any noise from the airplanes even though the airport is right next to the hotel. We enjoyed our stay very much!

<Title>“Nice hotel, good location depending on what you want to do”
<Content>I attended a conference here (again) and invited my sister for a getaway. As such, I booked the Bay Tower to be a little removed from the large conference chaos. The main building is probably a nicer hotel and with more restaurants and facilites, but the Bay Tower served us well. First, room 1188 was VERY spacious, with two queen-sized beds, good closet space and drawers, in-room safe, iron/ironing board, in-room coffee maker, and other amenties typical of a business class hotel. All rooms seem to come with a balcony -- absolutely delightful with morning coffee or a cocktail in the evening. The housekeeping was generally spotless. The staff was very helpful, friendly, and courteous throughout, and there is a concierge desk. This room overlooks the marina (which was lovely) and airport (which we find interesting, and were not at all bothered by any airport noise.) Odd-numbered rooms look over the bay and downtown in the distance. There is a complimentary internet access terminal in the lobby, and (I think) free wireless internet access in the public rooms. While the larger main hotel has larger pools and more restaurants, this place was a nice respite. The Bay Tower pool is large enough to paddle around in, and the facilities were quite nice with chaises and garden plantings. There is also a hot tub. Since it was on the far side of the hotel complex, it seemed less crowded than the main hotel pools (although the pool by the lanai rooms is also less crowded.) It is a reasonably short walk to the main hotel when you want more options for bars and restaurants. There is also an outdoor casual cafe operated by the marina along this walkway for coffee, sandwiches and casual breakfast and meals. You can book various harbor tours, fishing boats, bicycles, etc. in this area, although not part of the hotel operations. The location of the hotel is what you make of it. It is near the airport, with a complimentary shuttle. The hotel is not on the beach, but you can get to many beaches by car. With a car, it is also reasonably convenient to the zoo, Fashion Valley shopping center, etc, with easy access to Hwy 5. Compared to staying downtown, it was reasonably easy to zip around, unless you wanted to be right in the Gaslight Quarter or Old Town, but these areas are still very do-able from this hotel. The hotel provides excellent driving directions to many attractions and interesting areas. Harbor Island is not that large, but provides a nice venue for walks, bike rides, harbor viewing, etc. If you want to be on the beach, the historic Hotel Del Coronado is a lovely place (been there, done that,) but it is often overrun with tourists just walking through. The beach is very nice, and there is much to like about this charming hotel and area (including the hotel shops,) but the Sheraton may be more convenient if you want to get around to the zoo, Sea World, aquarium in La Jolla, hiking in Torrey Pines, etc. You can still go to the beach in Coronado (Imperial) without staying at the hotel. Frankly, if the beach was a priority, going up the coast to La Jolla or Del Mar might also be an option. But if you want a convenient location for general running around, the Sheraton is pretty good. There were some downsides that we could easily overlook. The tub had been re-done, but the covering was peeling. This Bay Tower hotel has very little in the way of a bar or restaurant (it was open at lunch, but often looked closed;) and generally less impressive than the main building. But again, when a large conference is swarming, you might want to be in this somewhat-removed location. The mini-bar has one of those annoying electronic systems. This meant that when we took a bottle of wine out to see what kind it was, we were charged (but the front desk very quickly reversed the charge when we pointed out the problem.) Finally, I still find it annoying when a hotel of this calibre charges for in-room internet access. There is a parking charge of $20 a day for self-park, $26 for valet, but it is reasonably convenient, and there are few hotels around that don't charge for parking in such prime areas. The hotel itself does not have much around it for dining, i.e. very little option to walk to other than hotel dining. However, with a car, much is possible, and/or a quick cab ride away. 'Strongly recommend that you try Miguel's for Mexican in the nearby Shelter Harbor area. You might be the only tourist in the place -- very full of locals. Not far from this restaurant, there is also a Von's and TRader Joe's to supply your excursions. Ask for directions. So: I'd be happy to stay here if a conference booked into this hotel again, or if I was generally touring the area. I can also see it as reasonably convenient for families who wanted to do a lot of touring in the area, assuming the room rate was acceptable. But if I really needed to be on the beach or have a greater number of cafes and shops to visit by walking to them, I'd go elsewhere.

<Title>“Careful”
<Content>Booked a 3 night downtown 4 star hotel via Hotwire at the Sheraton. Arrived late in the day after traveling from the East Coast. We were shuffled into the bar as they were still "preparing" our room ? Eventually the bar closed and we moved to the lobby area still waiting, only to eventually learn at 1 AM (4AM our time) that there was no room being prepared and there were no rooms available in San Diego?? In fact our only choice was to drive 35 miles to another Sheraton property in Carlsbad for what was left of the night. Not a great start to our vacation and we felt we were misled (if not repeatedly lied to) and taken advantage of as our trip was prepaid via Hotwire. We kept Hotwire informed and they made contact with Sheraton and have worked out compensation. Kudos to Hotwire!. Sheraton needs to work on their process and management teams communications. We will avoid Sheraton in the future. We did return to the hotel for nights 2 and 3 as we had prepaid. The hotel is nice enough, close to the ariport and a huge marina sits along side the hotel. Hotel is a car drive or cab ride to any downtown locations. Pool area was nice and the Sheraton did attempt to recover witha nice marina view room and breakfast. Be careful when booking this hotel and actively confirm and verify your arrival. If you really desire a downtown hotel near attractions this is not the hotel for you.

<Title>“Not worth the $$”
<Content>I was anticipating my two night stay here at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina, but now regret my decision to stay here. I generally enjoy my stays at Starwood hotels as I am a Platinum Preferred, however, I will never spend a night at this particular hotel. First the good -Plenty of on site parking -Free airport shuttle -Friendly desk staff -Great views of downtown from the 7th floor balcony Now the bad -Poorly maintained room (missing granite piece in bathroom, filthy light fixtures, hole in the wall near door (not caused by door). -Parking, not mentioned in my itinerary is $20/night, $26 for valet. -No WIRELESS internet, you can connect to the all but high-speed for only $12.95/24hrs -Half eaten items leftover in the "Refreshment Center" For the rate I paid, the room left quite a bit to be desired, if you don't need to stay near the airport, less expensive alternatives should be considered

<Title>“Fantastic hotel”
<Content>We had a lovely room overlooking the marina. The staff could not have been more helpful, open and friendly. At the concierge desk they gave us consistently good advice about what to see and how to get there. San Diego itself is a wonderful location. The light and the flowers and cleanliness of the whole area is amazing. We had been in another hotel the previous week and had been caught by the sensor in the mini bar (not that they charged us when we explained we had only opened it to put something in there, although getting the bill at 5 am on the morning of our departure was a bit of a shock) but this time we asked for a fridge and they provided it no trouble , to save any misunderstanding with the mini bar.

<Title>“Like Motel 6”
<Content>I called the hotel the day before we were to arrive to let them know we would be arriving late and that we needed 2 beds. The receptionist was very helpful and said I will note that in your file. When we arrived the next night they had no record of me calling and only had a king bed available for myself, husband and two kids. They said we do have a room with two double beds available in our west hotel. Thinking it was of the same quality I said sure. Our bedroom stunk, there was mold on the ceiling above the shower, the bathroom light didn't shut off, and there weren't fixtures around the bathroom lights just lightbulbs. We complained to the main hotel the next am and the gave us free breakfast vouchers and said they would move us if a room became available. I called later in the day and they still had no rooms available for us to move to in the main hotel but said they could move us up to the 10th floor in the west hotel. So when we checked in later that night the room on the 10th floor wasn't available. I went to the main hotel to talk to a mananger and he said there is nothing we can do we have no rooms available. I asked him to refund my money and he said he would.... We will see. Don't stay in the west side it is like Motel 6.

<Title>“Failed to deliver!”
<Content>Waited in a very long and slow queue at check in (only two desk opens) only to find they had 'deleted' our reservation (made months ago) and could not provide the interconnecting rooms requested . Eventually got rooms allocated only to find that one of them had a flooded bathroom (from a leaking toliet - nice!). Moved rooms (with an apology) to then be woken at 4am with a fire alarm (and evacuation) apparently caused by a leak. it was quite clear staff did not know what to do which was not reassuring and there was no communication. We actually had an enjoyable stay in spite of these factors but you were definitely left with the impression that this was a hotel failing to deliver on the basics and one where client care was almost non existent.

<Title>“Nice Stay”
<Content>Okay, as a San Diego native, there is no question that the Sheraton still retains that California feeling. In fact if you take your self (Walking) outside of the hotel and to the East you will see an amazing view of downtown that even I did not know existed. In fact, you usually have to go to to the other side by way of the Coronado Bay Bridge to enjoy such a view. Minutes from the very best of San Diego: Balboa Park, San Diego Zoo and Gaslamp Quarter. I find at times that the hotel transported me to circa 1970's, but the pool and grounds more than made up for this. I do agree with the other reviewers: For a grander experience, the Marina Tower has exceptional service and closer to the middle of all of the action.

<Title>“A wonderful Stay”
<Content>My family loved this hotel. We had 3 rooms with great views of the Marina. The rooms were spotless, older but very comfortable. We had our 1 year old grandaughter with us and the hotel went out of their way to make it a good stay for her, the crib was great, we were able to rent a refrigerator, the pool area with toys was perfect. The airport being so close did not impact us, the noise was minimal. We all loved the pool area after sightseeing all day. The employees, all of them from parking attendent to the front desk staff, the maids and waiters and the concierage were friendly, well informed and great at their jobs. I have absolutely no complaints and am planning another trip there soon.

<Title>“Got a great deal”
<Content>I booked this room without knowing its identity, on Hotwire - only paid $129/nite plus the $20/nite fee for parking-still quite a deal compared to their published rates-after I got the name of the hotel, I quickly checked reviews to find some negative comments about the hotel - I called the hotel directly- and worked with them on getting the Bay Tower - which the rooms are Larger ( or so I am told)-----and honestly, they gave us a Bay facing room on the 7th floor - we watched three sets of fireworks on our patio the night of the Fourth, and it was a great view......I would say to just be sure about which building you want to be in when you make the reservation...for us, a larger room was more important than the larger pool area that the other tower offered....the experience was a lot better than I expected, given the online reviews that I had read in advance of getting there - yeah, their computers were not working when I tried to check in, but , that wasn't so bad - we just left our luggage and checked in later.

<Title>“Pretty average”
<Content>Better than a Motel 6, but not by much. Like most people, I stayed here for a conference. Had my company not been paying for it, I would not have chosen here and would not return here. I also would encourage my company to choose another place in the future. The room was pretty basic, not uncomfortable. It looked a little worn, but was clean enough. It's pretty obvious that a large amount of people come in and out of the rooms for big conferences. There was nothing outstanding, worth mentioning about any of the rooms (I saw several) or the hotel in general. It's right on the bay, and literally across the street from the airport. Despite my expectations I did NOT hear the airport, armed services or bay while in my room. My understanding is that may be a unique experience. The bay might have been a nice view, but it was very cloudy the entire time I was there. A lot of the rooms had pretty big holes in the wall from fixtures being moved or removed. Many walls had stains and a lot of the furniture was pretty scarred. This was stuff you had to look for, but it was apparent they had made no attempt to cover most of this. I had trouble with my bathroom door not closing tightly. Pretty basic room, modern decor with a comfortable enough bed. I'd recommend not going here, and if you are doing a conference, try to find another place.

<Title>“better than the previous reviews”
<Content>Arrived June 27 and stayed until July 3rd. Based on previous reviews I was a little apprehensive. Rented a car at the airport and parked in the main lot, no problem there. Walked in 3 hours before check-in and our room was ready. Our room was supposed to be on the concierge level but that was booked. They did however give us the privileges to the club and our room was in the main hotel. I had a rate of $229.00 for a convention I was attending. $20 a day additional to park in the lot, with in and out privileges. Information desk was very helpful and gave us directions to anywhere we were heading. Bartenders nice inside the main hotel. A few minor things for improvements. Walls were a little thin and could hear kids in the next room only one day. One elevator kept breaking down. Bathtubs with mildew around the stopper that needed just a good scrubbing. Club level has one computer for all business people to share. Unfortunately the days I was there, children were always on it making it impossible to check e-mail during my breaks from the convention. 4 computers down in the lobby for everyone else to share and they always were being used. They did give a 30 minute limit. Pool area was clean and perfect temperature. Plenty of chairs so that you did not have to fight for space. Workout room attendant was very nice and the room was clean. Machines seemed in good working order. Beautiful walking paths across the street. The pool does rent rafts for kids and adults and that is a definite plus. Beautiful views front and back of the hotel. Fireplaces outside to sit around in the evening and talk to other guest. Wait staff around pool was slow and bartender for the outdoors could have been a little friendlier. Check out was very smooth and fast. I would definitely stay here again. This area was central to everything we wanted to do. I would say this was a 9 on a scale to 10. Close to the airport but not too loud.

<Title>“The place to be pampered”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for one night (Marina Tower), 5 July 2008 and never wanted to leave. The grounds are gorgeous, with flowering trees, palms, fountains. The valet staff, bell man, front desk staff were all very gracious and accommodating. The lobby looks like a palace and there are big pumps of delicious scented lotion in the lobby and huge candles that make the place smell gorgeous during the day - then they light them at night. There's a Starbucks right in the lobby. There is a place to log onto the Internet or connect your laptop for 45 minutes for free, and the computer speed when there were only a few people on-line was lightning quick. It felt very luxurious sitting there checking my e-mail with my Starbucks! Beautiful lanai out back, with rocking chairs, deck chairs, Adirondack chairs to look out over the marina , places to eat your lunch outdoors - plus fire pits at night. The pool is WONDERFUL and there's a jacuzzi pool too. Our room was on the 9th floor with a panoramic view towards the marina and the sunset . King-sized bed and pillows were very comfortable. I've read complaints about airplane noise, but once we slid the balcony door closed, we heard no airplane noise at all and slept like babies. Nice big tub. Very clean room. I loved the mandarin & mint shampoo and lotion! I would warn against opening the mini-bar; of course we knew the snacks were expensive, but didn't realize everything's computerized and motion-sensitive, so when our teenager jokingly picked up the mini-bottles of booze, the charges went right onto our bill. Although - the front desk staff removed the charges with a smile when we explained. You also are warned not to put any personal items into the fridge - again the motion dectectors will know you did it, and there's a $25 charge. Checkout was at 12:00, but our flight was not til 5:00pm, so we asked if we could stay a little longer. We were granted a 1:00pm checkout, plus after that, you can leave all your luggage and even your purse with the bellman, and go use the pool for as long as you like, without needing a room key. We took the dry cleaning bags for our wet suits to put in our suitcases later. There is a spa/fitness room where they'll give you all the swim towels you want and give you a place to change back into your dry clothes - and I have to mention: the "restroom" in the spa was amazing. Scented candles, and cupboards full of lotions, hair products, razors, deodorant, robes and slippers, the works! - for guests. There is also a steam room and of course a shower area and lockers. What a great way to wait for our flight! When you are poolside, there's a litlte cabana that rents big, fun floaties for $7/hr, and sells sunscreen, waterproof cameras, etc. . There is a fresh-water cooler for free, plus there are staff who walk around very courteously asking if you want to order drinks and/or lunch, which you can enjoy right there in the sun. A little cheaper place to eat: Just a 2-minute walk to the left side of the marina is a little sandwich/burger shop right on the dock that sells sundries and some groceries, probably for boaters who need to restock. They have great ice cream and are very polite and friendly. Places to sit inside and outside. This hotel could not have been more heavenly. We got a great deal on [--] (around $125 for the one night, one king-sized bed plus a roll-away bed for $15 for our son). I'd never want to stay anywhere else in San Diego.

<Title>“Sheraton --Bay Tower”
<Content>We came for a Conference with a discounted rate, so I'm not sure if the two towers command the same room rates. The Bay Tower worked very nicely for us, but it does look like an older property re-branded as Sheraton. Our room looked onto the Bay and North Island-a very excellent view, no noise from airport. Between the two Sheraton towers is a good outdoor deli that serves the boat marina. It gets all the Sheraton guests for breakfast and lunch at cheap prices. Restaurants: The restaurant at the Bay tower is almost nonexistent. The restaurants at the main tower are deluxe, with terrace dining. Pool: Not too special at the Bay tower. The pools(two) at the main tower are deluxe/ resort oriented, with live entertainment and waiter service to the pool chairs... Lobby: At the bay tower, nothing special. At the main tower--Wow! lots of activity, fancy. Room: clean, good bed, couch, tv, mini-bar--don't touch it., bathroom clean. Parking: We got a special rate, but any charge is too much. After spending much time on the balcony soaking up the view, we would have been happy, but then we walked over to the main tower----WHAT is this !!... Is this the same hotel !!? The main tower has activities, live entertainment at the pool, lounges, Starbucks --I hope they charge less at the Bay tower! On the island, there are several restaurants within walking distance---besides the deli next to the hotel, there is the Boathouse restaurant with good prices, and Tom Ham's lighthouse, and Island Prime restaurant. By car, the Star of India/ Embarcadero/Coronado Ferry and Harbor Excursion is about 5 minutes away.

<Title>“No Guarantees Here!”
<Content>I reserved a room with a view over the phone and was promised a nice room one month in advance. Upon arrival we were told, "we can't guarantee rooms, but you can have one on the other side, the view of the airport is beautiful". Maybe someone should remind these beautiful minds what the definition of a reservation is! No effort was made to accommodate us, and our trip was ruined. I hope this doesn't happen to others, they are taking advantage of people who don't want to look like schmucks and complain!

<Title>“Good location/price ratio”
<Content>We were quite pleased when we arrived at this hotel in San Diego, after a terrible accomodation experience in New York City and a very bad flight. The price was definitely worth it and it was actually much cheaper than we thought for such a location. The rooms are clean and the beds are very confortable. We stayed on the ground floor and we had a very good view of downtown San Diego. The hotel was very quiet, even though there were many guests around, but most of them stayed there for business meetings or weddings. You could use computers free of charge in the other tower, which was just 2 minutes away from our tower. The staff was helpful and nice. There is nothing around the hotel (stores, restaurants, bars), but the complimentary shuttle service to the airport made it easy for us to reach the city. Buses to downtown run very often from the airport, but the service stops at approximately 12:30 am. If you are planning to experience some nightlife, than you should count on the cab on your way beck. It is approximately $15. However the nightlife ends pretty much around 1:30 am. It was a bit disappointing for us as we are used to the European style. You can ask for some booklets at the reception as San Diego and the sourrounding area offer lot of nice places to visit and there is a variety of tours offered. If I was to go back to San Diego I would choose this hotel again.

<Title>“Not so great”
<Content>One of the few hotels with vacancy the day before we left. My wife booked it as it was lots cheaper than whatever else she found. I'm not sure what it cost, but will keep that factored in for the review. We stayed in the Bay Tower, which is a good walk from the Marina Tower. The rooms were not too small (I heard they are bigger than in the Marina Tower), but not what you would call large, either. There was a very comfortable king bed, tv, table, sofa, dresser in the room. Ironing board, coffee maker (single serve packets - they had 3 each day for us), and in-room safe were the amenities. There was a small balcony that you could sit on. In our case, we had a beautiful view of the airport to enjoy. You coul definitely hear them taking off every few minutes if the door was open. If the balcony door was closed, it was very hard to hear the planes. Room service pricing was reasonable, food was average. Our room was clean and comfortable. The Bay Tower has a small gift shop, medium sized restaurant (seemed to be dinner only), and conference rooms. The lobby was not welcoming, and if you didn't order room serrvice, then you are a hungry person. You can hike over to the Marina Tower, which definitiely has a nicer lobby. On the way to the Marina Tower, you will pass a small coffee shop with sandwiches and muffins (if you need a quick bite and dont want to hike all the way to the other tower). The Marina Tower lobby has a restaurant, sports bar, gift shop, wireless area and lounge. This lobby is decently appointed (much better than the bay tower). You can rent boats and seadoos just outside the marina tower. Overall, this is a decent hotel if you are looking for a relaxing trip, and the room is just to sleep or hang out in. I would recommend the marina tower for the lobby and its facilities over the bay tower, although i hear the rooms are smaller in the marina tower. We drove from L.A., and that airport frontage road is a real bear to navigate through to the hotel from the freeway. Getting out from the hotel to downtown San Diego was a real time killer. On the other hand, getting to Sea World or the harbor was pretty easy. If you are going for a value-based weekend, then this hotel might be okay with you. If you are going to San Diego as a destination vacation, you really owe it to yourself to look harder and find somewhere else.

On our way up to our room after checking in, we got stuck in the elevator for an hour (3 adults and 2 kids under 4 years old). My wife and my son did not want to get in the elevator again. We asked to switch to a room on ground level the next day and they said we were supposed to be checking out, but we had one more night left. It was even written on our room key that our check out date was the next day. Finally got that settled. They were supposed to credit my sister-in-laws room $50 for the elevator incident, but charged her $50! If you rent a car, $20 a day for parking in a dirt lot with not easy access to the hotel. Each day we had to talk to a manager, each time a different manager. NOT WORTH IT! The Hilton in La Jolla is much better!

<Title>“Just OK”
<Content>I was at this hotel for a large conference so I was able to see several of my coworkers' rooms in both the Marina and Bay Towers. Before arriving, none of us had a clue that the two hotels are entirely separate, and a good distance away. (Walkable but not fun in high heels for the conference events.) Although directly across from the airport, I never had an issue hearing planes inside my room. The Marina Tower building is the very large building you'll see on the hotel website. The lobby was very nice, receptionists very helpful. The rooms on this side varied - I saw one room on the lanai side which was kind of hidden at the very end of the hotel, and set up like a motel with the doors all facing an inner, outdoor courtyard. That room smelled very strongly of smoke (this is a non-smoking hotel room) and was dark and a bit run down looking. My own room was on the 10th floor, view was just OK - alot of the views are of the neighboring Coast Guard area or the airport, not exactly the beautiful marina and harbor you might be expecting. The room was clean, furniture a bit warn. The rooms over at the Bay Tower are larger (30% according to the front desk clerk) but the views aren't necessarily better. These rooms seemed newer and cleaner, with a Tommy Hillfiger type of atmostphere - lots of red and blue in the rooms. To anyone planning a large conference - don't dare let them stick your conference in that giant "Pavilion" room - it's a tent. A giant tent. With no bathrooms. And you'll hear every single plane and Coast Guard helicopter, every couple of minutes. People in the back of the tent could hear nothing at all. Add to that the wind blowing the whole thing the entire time, it literally sounded as though people were banging pots and pans outside the tent while speakers attempted to finish their speeches. Overall, I was happy with the room comfort and service staff but would never book this hotel for myself on vacation. You can find much better rates in the Mission Valley area (same distance from downtown as this hotel) and much better rooms in the downtown area.

<Title>“Sheraton SD Marina = DISAPPOINTING”
<Content>I am going to be honest----The Sheraton Hotel and Marina was a disappointment ---- especially if you are staying in the BAY TOWER! Location is next to airport, views are not impressive and not within walking distance of anything! We were dupped when we first arived at the Marina tower parking our vehicle and entering the lobby to check in. We were impressed with the decor and it felt like a fine hotel but were told that our room was in the BAY tower and was a 1/4 mile away. OK? we thought as we repacked our car for the drive over. When we first arrived the service level dropped by 10 points and had to ask more than once for a bellman. Entering the lobby you can feel the difference in the two towers--Marina was grand and the Bay was bland! In fact the BAY tower felt as if it were a former lower budget hotel rebranded as a Sheraton. The room was not impressive as the decor was a blue and red natical theme---yuk. There were no robes and a small bathroom with a cracked toliet that leaked. The location of both towers are adjacent to the SD airport and isolated from downtown. You would have to use a taxi or your own vehicle to go anywhere. If you do stay at the Sheraton Marina make sure you get a room in the Marina tower; our friends did and were happier than we. If you want to experience SD you would be better off staying downtown were you can use the trolly to explore the city. We paid $229 a night and felt we could have done far better elsewhere and we did----we moved to the Hard Rock for the last half of our trip.

<Title>“Nice hotel, but noisy and fridge taboo”
<Content>I stay at the Sheraton in May 2008 at the Bay tower. The hotel locates in a very beautiful location with a fantastic view. There is a nice path for jogging/walking and that is very nice and enjoyable. However, the nice view has a price to pay as it is far from downtown. There is no store nearby to buy personal items. No easy public transportation is available, except taxi. The parking fee at the hotel is quite high, about 20 dollars/day. It is also very noisy as the San Diego airport is nearby. You can hear them almost all the time. If you are a light sleeper, that could be a problem. The hotel has internet connection but for a fee if you use it in your room, but you can work at the lobby for 1hr free of charge. The one that I dislike the most is that you cannot use the hotel's refrigerator for stocking your drinks. The hotel will throw your stuff away and charge you 25 dollars each time for the rearrangement of the fridge. We pay 300 dollars/night and cannot use the fridge. Saying that, I really enjoy San Diego. The city is very beautiful and is a good place to visit. Next time, I would choose the hotel inside downtown that I could enjoy so many beautiful things nearby.

<Title>“Nickeled and Dimed”
<Content>We stayed here for Gator by the Bay which is located right outside the hotel, so the location is great. There were about ten of us from the same area staying there. The room was fine but customer beware of charges that sneak up on you. A member of our party rented a car through the hotel, was not informed of the need for a parking pass, and the hotel tried to charge him $40 to get his car back out of the lot the next morning. He refused to pay it, and they sold him the (ridiculously priced) $20 a night pass they should have told him about in the first place. It costs $12 to hook up to the internet in your room and you can't use wifi because the hotel has somehow blocked access to unsecured networks. You can see them on your laptop, but can't connect. A salad with moldy tomatoes wasn't taken off the bill in the hotel restaurant until we went back and complained, even though the waitress had been handed the moldy tomato before the bill was produced. The bottle of sunblock that costs $10 at the deli down the road costs $15 at the hotel, Miller Lite is over $5 a glass (Miller Lite? Good grief!), and don't take the offer of a refill on your soda unless you want to pay full price for another one. The front desk is understaffed. The airport shuttle is great and, strangely enough, free? What were they thinking? I think I'll probably skip Gator by the Bay and just go to other festivals. This was too much like being a captive money machine for the Sheraton.

<Title>“Below average stay at the Sheraton”
<Content>This hotel was below your "standard" Sheraton. It is old and in need of a remodel. The room was okay, but noisy. We could hear the room next door flushing the toilet and showering. The bathroom was average too. The service was below average. We reserved two rooms with King Beds, and were told that they did not have any and that our reservation was a “request” and not a guarantee. As Starwood Gold members we expressed our dissatisfaction with this news and 5 minutes later we got our rooms. We only stayed here because we used our Starwood points, and we would probably not stay there again.

<Title>“Ehhh....”
<Content>This hotel is literally right outside the exit of the airport. So, first, be prepared to hear the constant roar of planes during your stay. Pros: balcony and beautiful views of the harbor; friendly and helpful staff Cons: rooms are in major need of renovation - clean but old, dark & depressing With the number of great hotels to choose from in this city, I won't be returning.

<Title>“Some highs, some lows -”
<Content>The hotel is a bit outdated and needs refreshing, but the room was quite comfortable and the view wonderful. Obviously being near the airport has some advantages and quite honestly we didn't hear the planes at all. Our biggest complaint was the $12 charge per day for the Internet. That was outrageous. When we complained we discovered that our convention had a deal on the Club rooms with complementary breakfast and afternoon snacks with free Interent for about $20 extra. Given the $12 charge this was the right deal for us on this trip. However, I agree with another writer that they should be specific about the parking cost and the Internet and include it in the price...it was simply ridiculous and started us in a bad mood upon our arrival. The staff has been quite cordial and the Club Floor a delight. I'll check out the pool and facilities tomorrow. By the way, our Club Room was no different than the original room we were offered. If you want to be near the action, this is not the place to be. It is quite far from the Convention Center, Gaslight area etc. We rented a car so it wasn't a problem for us.

<Title>“Long on Price. Short on Service”
<Content>Understaffed check-in desk at peak time (7 pm) $20 self-parking includes very poorly lit parking lot and a long walk (the hotel was all too quick to point out that it wasnt their problem because the parking lot is managed by a third party). Valet is only $6 more (plus tip). Ignored by wait staff when attempting to order in the sports bar in the lobby. In their defense it was understaffed for the number of people in the bar, but they did wait on someone else first who came in after I did. The room was clean and comfortable althought the "lanai room" I had was downstairs and had no view. Avoid these rooms if possible. For the price ($189 per night) this could have been better.

<Title>“Club Room”
<Content>I had to travel for business and wanted to stay in San Diego before finishing the drive home. I decided to get a club room for the snacks and drinks. The room was worth the extra few dollars. The club was on the top floor (if I remember correctly) and had stunning views of the harbor and the city. The food was GREAT and the club was large and very well decorated, including fire place, flat screen and waiters if you needed mixed drinks. We stayed one floor below the club and didn't mind taking the trip up. I would have liked to have been on the same floor but I wasn't going to complain to the front desk. The room was great for the extra-large bed and great comfortable chair. The room was very high up in the tower and had a balcony. It was a great view. No fridge but it was the club that offered the food we needed in the evening and morning. We played ping pong for fun in the evening and took a nice walk around the marina. There were people staying on their boats and the noise from the Marina was loud at night, as we stayed on a Friday night. In fact, the noise from the parties on the boats was booming until the wee hours of the morning. This is a drawback since the room was 18 floors up. For the cost, this was a great deal and met all the Sheraton standards in the room.

<Title>“YET AGAIN...Rotten Experience!!!”
<Content>Here we go again....I thought I would give this hotel ONE more shot after writing my last negative review and I have even stayed there TWICE since the last review. I always start with the positive things...some of the staff (Dinah at the front desk, the cleaning staff, and the staff in the Club Lounge breakfast and evening drink area are EXCELLENT!!!!) were just down right wonderful! After my past experience with miserable staff, I must admit these few folk should be given gold stars! They were extremely helpful and always friendly! Again, the view is great and the gym is excellent and their staff is so pleasant (you should move them to the front desk!!). Now the real reason for the negative review... FIRST, the parking here is horrible! There is one lot that is closest to the hotel which seemed to be closed for the whole 2 weeks! There are a couple of cars parked there and there is no construction. So you have to park out in a dirt lot and walk through a dimly lit parking lot to get to the hotel. It's worse that there was a huge conference going on, so you have even less parking! Half the lot is used by valet parking and is NEVER full! So if you are paying $20 a day to park, I don't really expect to have to walk at night across a dimly lit lot that seemed quite far away! SECOND, I had the same problem as one of the previous guests with the smoke smell. I came back to my room one night and there was a VERY strong smell of cigarette smoke in my room. I opened the balcony thinking maybe it was there, but it wasn't from outside. I called down and security came up and said that it was probably someone walking by a vent smoking and it came into my room. Isn't the hotel non-smoking??? And it didn't go away and they told me that if I could see a guest smoking that I can report it...so should I have gone knocking on all the doors hoping to catch someone in the act?? It never got better, so they moved me to another room....exactly what I wanted to do...pack up my things at 10pm and change rooms! THIRD, the rooms are very tired. For such an expensive room, you expect better than 2-star hotel quality. The sink backed up constantly and even worse when you could hear another room running water it would come up in our sink! FOURTH, there was a big party going on one Friday night down in the parking lot tent...no problem, but if I close my windows I shouldn't feel the whole room shaking on the 12th floor! I called down to see when it would stop and they said midnight! I went down to ask if they could maybe turn the bass down...no chance, but there were 2 employees at the desk. As I walked off, one said to the other in a short tone, "What did she want? She's already called down once about that." Wouldn't you think that after a long week of work that you should be able to sleep before midnight? I think this will definitely be my last stay at this hotel. I am a Starwood fan, but this one does NOT fit the standards of even their lower star hotels! I am going to have to switch to another brand when staying in San Diego from now one so that I don't have to write another one of these reviews!

<Title>“Caveat emptor (let the buyer beware)”
<Content>I travel several times a year to medical conferences. My husband and I selected this property because we wanted to take our dog along and I wanted it to be in proximity to the hotel that was hosting the conference. This place was bad enough that we might have to leave the dog at home next time! First, the buildings are tired and decrepit. There was a crack in the sink, the light fixture in the bathroom took two or three minutes to warm up enough to provide light, and one of the bedside lamps required a phone call to maintenance on our first night there. Some of the staff were nice enough, but several were downright surly. When my husband went back to the front desk to find out why we were only given a AAA discount for one night of our stay and why we had been charged twice for one movie, the desk clerk tried to rescind the discount for the one night we had received it! We did have a nice, albeit expensive meal seated out on the patio behind the lobby. However, none of the staff could figure out how to light the propane heaters during our meal so I had to go into the gift shop and buy a jacket for each of us for dinner. There is a charge for the internet in your room and for parking. Corporate America's mantra these days seems to be to hook you with the promise of cheap prices and then burn you once you commit. In Corporate America's mind, the old bait and switch still works. Charging $20/day for a guest to park at your hotel is an outrage. What did they think? That we wouldn't be bringing a car? Tell us the real price of staying at your hotel and charge us that price and then we'll leave satisfied. However, tell us one price, load on the extra charges and we're not likely to return. It must be something about the Starwood properties...I haven't had a very good experience with any of them. I should have stuck with my initial plan of staying at the Omni downtown. For an extra $60 a night, we probably would have had a dog friendly room with much better service.

<Title>“Cockroach in our room”
<Content>We just came back from staying here because we had too. First, we tried to cancel our room and move but note that you have to cancel a week prior to your stay. The hotel charges you for your whole stay a week prior to your stay. Second my husband was speaking at a conference there at the hotel. I should of know at that time this will be an interesting stay. It started out that I thought they had 24 hour shuttle service to the hotel. They don’t!! We got in late waited for the shuttle as instructed when I called to confirm my resevation. They did not bother to tell me that it does not run after midnight. They were aware that we were checking in late. We took a taxi over to the hotel. No big deal it was 7.00 with tip. It took less than 5 min. We checked into our first room at 12am and it smelled like a bar with horribly stained carpet. Looked like someone spilt bleach all over the floor. My thought was to try to cover up the smell of a bar. We moved at that time to another room on the 12th floor. Security was nice and helped us move. We moved to the "new" room instantly and there was a cockroach in the bathroom. Security was still there and took care of the cockroach but they could not move us again because of the conference was taking up the whole hotel. We tried to move hotels but we would still have to pay 250.00 a night (we were there for 4 nights). The next morning we woke up to another cockroach in the bathroom. We let them know they explained that happens at times. Yuck!!!!!! We are paying how much a night!!! Housekeeping can in a great job of cleaning and we did not see another one. The third night the whole room filled up with cigarette smoke at 3am. Someone down below us was smoking in the bathroom and because at night the circulation slows down the cigarette smoke went into our room through the vent in the bathroom. Again called front desk no one came up or even got a call from anyone that they even cared that we could smell smoke. My husband is sensitive to cigarette smoke and it was irritating. Again when we check in they made us sign that we will not smoke in the hotel or on the balcony but no follow through. The next day during the day I went down a spoke to one of the front desk people. He stated he would give us a comp day for the unconvinced of the cockroaches and smoke. An hour later he called and could not comp a whole night so he credit our portfolio with just 100.00 credit and a pass to the club house for Hord’oeuvres and breakfast. That was really nice of them but we had dinner and breakfast at the conference provided for us. I don’t think this was fair but what else you are going to do except let everyone else know that it may look clean but know this hotel has a problem with cockroaches and let others make the decision to stay here. If you do make a reservation check out that you cannot get out of your reservation if you do find a cockroach. The positive thing is the pool was really nice.

<Title>“Yikes”
<Content>Sadly, I must agree with many of the postings on this site. What an odd stay. I was first given a room on the bottom floor of the Marina building. There were glasses with drinks on the patio that did not belong to me. I hoofed it back to the front desk and they put me on the 12th floor--much safer. Overall, the hotel does not seem clean or designed well. A few points: - Someone else's dry-cleaning was put into my room. - There were divots on the toilet seat & shower and the faucets were installed backwards - Stains on the bathrooms walls & splashes on the coffeemaker - The curved shower rod made the bathroom door unable to open all the way, so you'd sit on the toilet with the door between your knees - Deep creases in the bedspread. The bed was so poorly made, it was almost as bad as if I had made it! - The iron was so worn that you could not tell the setting The good parts were the Starbucks and Tazo tea that were provided (intermittently). Beware the long line at Starbucks in the morning, especially if there is a conference in the hotel. The free shuttle from the airport was another nice feature. It really was a peculiar stay: far away from San Diego proper, odd room, extraordinarily loud lobby with a strong perfume scent. I asked a bellman what it was and he said that it was Sheraton's proprietary aroma system. I'm glad that I was there for a conference because the nightly rate was far higher than I thought the stay was worth.

<Title>“Stay here only if you have no other choice”
<Content>I am writing this as I sit in my dingy hotel room waiting for my TV to "warm up" so I can catch the news/weather. I turned it on about 20 minutes ago and it is still not playing. I am in the Linai section of the hotel - which is probably the older section of the hotel - if that is possible. My room is available to anyone that wants to walk up to it becasue my door leads to the outside. I asked several times for a room change but the hotel is booked becasue of the conference that I am attending. I explained to them thaht as a single female I feel very unsafe. The staff was nice but unable to change my room which I can also hear every plane that takes off. Make sure you pack your sleep aid! I was really excited to see San Diego but the hotel is so far from downtown that I might as well be in middle America. If you have to stay here - try to stay in the main section of the hotel - it might be a little nicer. I am stuck here for a conferenc with no other choice.

<Title>“Not the best choice in San Diego”
<Content>I recently went to a conference at this hotel and found it adequate but not inspiring. As others have pointed out, this hotel is very isolated. It would definitely not be my first choice if I were in San Diego on vacation. The cab ride into town is about $12 each way. That adds a hefty price to the cost of a meal. We took the cab on the first night but then explored Harbor Island on foot the second day. There are 3 other restaurants on the island - one is exorbitantly priced and the other two are average quality seafood restaurants (the Lighthouse at the very end and the Boathouse). They are an easy walk from the hotel. Regarding the quality of the hotel: We stayed in the West Tower (the smaller of the two) which was a 7-10 minute hike from the conference facilities. The walk was pleasant, along the marina and provide a little exercise at the start of the day. The first room we were assigned was facing the airport (marina side) and that's where you could hear every plane take off. We quickly changed to a room facing the bay side, which was much quieter. The view from the balcony was quite nice and peaceful; you could see the Coronado bridge and downtown San Diego. In the room, the furnishings were typical but the bed was not comfortable. After 5 nights, we couldn't wait to get out of there. The bathroom toilet flushed with a very loud noise (kind of like the newer toilets on an airplane) - not a big deal until your neighbor flushed there's in the middle of the night and you heard it in your room. The other complaint is the inconsistency of the shuttle bus. It was great to have a free shuttle from the airport to the hotel; but, the shuttle was supposed to take you from one building to the other. There was no schedule so you could wait quite a while for it. Generally we walked but later at night, we didn't want to walk in the dark along the water so we waited and waited.

<Title>“Okay Only If you're not paying for the Room!!”
<Content>I was in San Diego for a conference at this hotel, so thankful I did not have to pay for my stay. The advantage to being so close to the airport is also a major disadvantage with the noise factor. And as mentioned by other reviewers, the low flying frequent helicopters in the area were quite disturbing, especially if you tried to walk outside to enjoy the marina. I stayed in the east tower and was given a room on the first floor with a parking lot view! I was foolish not to ask for a better room, thinking that it wouldn't matter since I would be in meetings the majority of my time. Little did I know that the hotel would be the site of several wedding receptions that went late into the night. Imagine trying to sleep with the sound of loud celebrants outside my window, car fobs continually chirping as people returned to their cars, and car alarms going off without end! The room was well worn and partially for that reason didn't seem quite clean. I did appreciate the coffee maker in the room, but since it only brews one cup at a time, I can only imagine the negotiations that must go on between couples for the first cup! This hotel also boasts their huge internet center in the lobby. They have about 8 to 10 computers, but that is not helpful when all but 2 of them have "Out of Order" signs on them. I desperately wanted to print my airplane boarding pass since I had an early flight, but the 2 working computers were being monopolized by people that felt no sense of courtesy. Yes, there is a Starbucks inside the hotel. No, they will not honor any Starbucks gift cards that you may have. I did not dine in any of the restaurants, but the meals prepared for the the conference were wonderful. My room didn't have any hotel information books or maps so I have no idea how many restaurants were available or what they offered. I did consider room service one evening, but when I couldn't locate any menus, I gave up and bought a pastry from Starbucks. I was concerned because my return flight left at 6:30AM. I inquired and was told the Hotel Airport Shuttle would start running at 5:00AM, stopping at the other tower before heading to the airport. This concerned me because I am accustomed to flying out of Atlanta and you really need to allow time to get through long waits at security. I arrived to check out at 4:40AM. Although my room was covered, I always like to be sure that nothing has been put on my credit card. There was a gentleman checking out ahead of me and he was having huge issues. He went back and forth with the receptionist. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a Hotel Airport Shuttle pull up, load 2 passengers and take off! I looked at my watch and it was 4:50AM! The gentleman behind me looked at me and we both screamed in unison! Another shuttle arrived shortly after 5:00AM, and I climbed on not a minute too soon! All of us thought that since every seat was full that we would go straight to the airport and not stop at the other tower. WRONG!!! Can you believe that we had to try and load more passengers (who had to stand) and their luggage on an already filled to the max shuttle?? By this time I was so nervous that I was going to miss my flight, especially since we had to stop and unload passengers at each terminal. Mine was last. I really prefer to write good, positive reviews, but I appreciate the people that share their unpleasant experiences also. Maybe this will help someone make a better plan. I did not have a choice about where I stayed this time. If you are planning a vacation, please research other hotels that are better situated and better maintained than this one. You will be so glad that you did!

<Title>“This hotel has nothing going for it”
<Content>I just returned from a conference at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. Frankly I'm amazed at how high it rates on TripAdvisor. Either the staff is being paid to write trumped up reviews or the folks who visit this hotel just don't get out much. For reference, I was in the East (main) tower. On the positive, the restaurant and bar side of the house did a superb job. The food was great and the wine list was even better. That's where the positive comments end. First, the location. For someone visiting San Diego, you either want to be downtown where the action is, or far enough out that you can get free parking and drive to the local attractions. The Sheraton has neither. It's not walking distance to ANYTHING. Someone in the elevator who did have a car commented that the valet charge was $29/day. Further on location, forget having a quite night's sleep here. To the north is Lindberg Field. To the Southwest is North Island, a major US Navy air station. To the Southeast is the main Coast Guard station. Between the civil, military, and coastguard planes and helecopters there's almost no time of the day when there isn't a loud drone or roar occuring with great frequency. My room was small and old. The fixtures in the bathroom were at least 30 years old and one of the tiles in the floor was completely detatched - I could have dug it out with a pocket knife. Bathroom fan - forget it. The sliding door to my balcony fit so poorly that wind blew freely into the room. The noise from the aformentioned aircraft combined with the drone of the air condition units that my room overlooked made sleep an impossibility. One of the few redeeming features might have been the Starbucks. I went in one morning and ordered a Syrup Cream - a fairly standard menu item. The people working there didn't have a clue what I was talking about. When I pointed out that it was a standard Starbucks menu item, they pointed at their menu board and managed to get out enough broken english to tell me that they only knew how to make what was on that board - nothing else. As for process and procedure - the hotel was pittiful. Hotel guide book (binder) in my room was so incomplete it was all but useless. It gave menus for the main restaurant, but not the other two. There was no map of the complex so for the third restaurant that was in the west tower, I didn't even know what it was or where it was. It mentioned the pool, but didn't give the hours. When I pointed these items out to the concierge (two of them on two different locations), I was given the same stupid response - "Perhaps they did it that way because they want you to come down and interact with us!".

<Title>“great staff, dirty hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this hotel for business reasons. The hotel staff was fantastic, although the girl at the front desk who checked us in wasn’t the friendliest person--she wasn’t too bad. The bellhop who helped us with our bags was really nice, and later during our stay my friends and I used the concierge several times and were treated great. They were very helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. Also, the valets were great--giving us bottled water every morning to take on our sightseeing trips, great ideas on where to shop, etc. I loved the lobby, there was a Starbuck’s (a real plus for me), a nice gift shop, and there was a beautiful aquarium, also a really nice area for business—computers, etc. All in all the first floor is great. Now on to the guest rooms--the rooms were a bit shabby. The bathrooms were small. Everything was in need of paint and wallpaper, and they really need some new soft beds. Ours was as hard as a rock! So while we were not too impressed with the rooms, on the plus side--they had Starbuck’s coffee in the room, also a nice little balcony with 2 chairs so that depending on which side of the hotel you were on, you could enjoy either a beautiful sunrise or sunset. We had a city view and loved it. Be advised though of the airport noise, it can’t be avoided, but it does stop between midnight and 6:00 am.

<Content>Stayed a total of 4 nights. For over $200 a night, i expected more. Room that i stayed in is showing signs of overuse. Could use some renovation. Furniture looks a little worn. At least it doesn't look/feel dirty. I can find similar conditions hotels for 1/2 the price.

<Title>“Probably one of the worst places to stay in San Diego”
<Content>Only stayed here because a conference I was at was here - otherwise if this is YOUR money and you are on vacation, please do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere. First off, this property is ooooold compared to other major hotels in the San Diego area, the rooms in the marina tower are tiny and the while the front desk tries their best to trick you into staying at the Bay Towers (about 1/2 mile away) where the rooms are supposed to be 30% bigger, those rooms are even OLDER (if you can believe it). It's like stepping into a run down 1980's movie set. And while the rooms are bigger, the furniture size didn't increase and the room is poorly laid out so that you have big blank spaces of wall and carpet where there really should have been something else. First floors in the Bay Towers where I got shunted too (after expressing obtaining a reservation for the Marina Towers) faced the parking lot so any crazy person could just cross from the parking lot into your room if you left the balconey door open. Surprisingly enough someone in the conference said that the hotel cleaning staff or room service had come in, unlocked the balconey door and not fully closed the front door - how scary is that??!!! Front desk was rude too - when I pointed out that I had PAID for a reservation for the Marina Towers she said - sorry they had given up my room and there was no choice. I wasn't late or anything for check in. I was shocked! Parking at the Marina Towers is a bit nuts if there is a conference in town, they are doing some sort of construction on the parking lot (what I'm not sure - since i never saw anyone actually doing anything) but it's basically a dusty dirt lot with very NARROW parking spaces. There is not enough parking in the self lot (again if conference in town which usually there is), so you see lots of cars just circling around stalking people. Also it's not a very close walk from the self parking lot to the Marina towers. The parking at Bay Towers is a lot better - but then you're away from all the action. There is no gift shop yet at the bay towers (they're building it) and I didn't remember seeing any business center either - remember everything is really headquartered at Marina Towers. The good news at both towers. 1) Noise - while you're pretty much right next to the airport the noise inside your room is pretty much not there 2) Parking - it's $20 but for in and out privileges so that's not too bad for hotel parking. Good luck for anyone risking a stay here on their own dime.

<Title>“A Joy Ride for your Expense Account”
<Content>My husband had a business meeting in San Diego and asked me to join him and make it into a mini-vacation. Arrangements were made by his associates at a special rate; hence I can't quote the usual price of this room. However, I would consider it to be run-of-the-house and standard. That said, it was fine. This should be considered a business hotel, rather than a vacation property. The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina is one of two in the area in close proximity to Lindbergh Field, the San Diego International Airport. It is so close that one could practically walk there from the airport. We rented a car, though the hotel provides shuttles. The drive to the airport from the hotel is probably no more than five minutes. Though the location makes for a convenient launching point for San Diego activities, visitors should keep in mind that planes fly low over downtown San Diego creating a frequent roar of jet engines up above. The airport appears to close about midnight and not reopen until an early, but not unreasonable time the next morning. The planes are heard and seen from the hotel but didn't create a problem for us; they might for some. The hotel has over 1,000 rooms, all having balconys. Our room was what I would consider of an average size with two double beds and was comfortble enough for our adult daughter to spend two nights with us. It was tastefully decorated and all furniture, bedcoverings, etc. were crisp and clean upon our arrival. However, the view from this room was so enchanting that even a lesser appearing room would have gotten a thumbs-up here. The hotel faces San Diego Bay and our room had a glorious view of the city skyline and a great expanse of the bay. The room's small balcony with its table and two chairs was a class spot to enjoy your morning coffee while viewing the many sailboats and other vessels passing by. And as if to complement the daytime view, the San Diego night time brought on the city lights and a mad search for the proper camera exposure to capture them. The room was equipped with a television, clock-radio and a very simple little coffee maker that was fine for tea but questionable for coffee. For that ,management apparently wanted us to go into one of the hotel's restaurants. The room was also Internet equipped and the user would be connected for $11.95 a day. There was a stocked refrigerator in the room carrying sodas ($3.00), small waters ($3.50), Rice Krispies Treats ($4.00) and the like, "all prices subject to a 20% restocking fee." We passed on this little Sheraton moneymaker. We were all thankful for our cellular phones here because Sheraton fiercely guards outgoing calls from its rooms. They charge $2.00 for access per local call, up to 60 minutes per call with .10 per each additional minute beyonyd that first hour. Toll free calls will set you back the same as above. Want operator assistance, or making a credit card call? It's all the same to these folks. If you need to call long distance your prices will be that much higher. Bring your cell! The hotel has a few restaurants and we dined at Quinn's, a casual sports bar offering adult sandwiches (no pb&j on the menu, though I am certain they would oblige if requested) such as the marinated skirt steak on a ciabatta roll which I had and a very fat pastrami sandwich selected by a friend. They had a wide assortment of appetizers and some nice main dish salads and the requisite soup for a seaside community, clam chowder. Prices were about what you would expect in a city hotel, with the chowder at $8.00 for an average sized bowl. Food was well prepared. As a full-service hotel, in-room dining is also offered, but be prepared for the food prices to be pumped up with Sheraton's version of thinking of its patrons' comfort (tongue in cheek here). The in-room menu reads "For your convenience a 19% service charge and a $3.00 delivery charge will be added automatically." However, if this is not a determent then a very nice selection of foods is offered. Aside from a bank of computers in the lobby available to guests without charge, we did not use any of the other commercial offerings, but I did investigate what was available A "Smart Office" is set up with a computer, printer, speaker phone, scanner, fax etc. at $75.00/hr. This room is described as being appropriate for small meetings and interviews and has a capacity for up to four people. They have a spa and fitness center for a $10.00 daily fee for hotel guests. Various spa treatments are available and the center is equipped with cardiovascular equipment and body machines. Neither a hair salon nor manicurist was in the list of services. There is a small store selling the usual hotel merchandise and snacks but don't expect to find any semblance of solid nutrition (a bagel, for instance) there. Again, they want you in their restaurants so they can sell that bagel for $6.00. Everyone we met at this hotel, from check-in personnel, to wait staff, to maintenance, was extraordinarily nice. Apparently Sheraton takes the time to select and train its people and it shows. No complaints there! Beware of their parking arrangement. They charge $20/day for hotel parking, more for valet. An adjacent open lot charges $4.00 per hour and the charges just keep accruing. Check before you park so you won't be surprised. In conclusion, this is a pleasant place to stay, especially for the business traveller. The property is smart, food is good, and the location is great.

<Title>“Liked this Hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina from 12/25-12/31. In general, we were very pleased with the hotel. From the outside, it looked very nice. It was very close to the airport, so that was convenient as well. We did frequently see and hear planes going overhead every few minutes. It didn't bother us at all, but others might be more sensitive to that. The plane noise never disturbed us during the night either. The hotel room was nice. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. The rug seemed a little bit worn, but that wasn't a big deal. We had a balcony over looking the pool area. In the evening, they often had hot cider in the lobby. I thought that was a nice touch. The only thing I didn't like about the hotel was the computer availability. It was great that they offered free internet use, however, they only had about 6 computers for hundreds of guests. Most of the time they weren't even all in service. That was frustrating! Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel. It was clean, conveniently located, and affordable. If we head back out to San Diego in the future, we will definitely consider staying here again.

<Title>“Great views, close to airport”
<Content>I recently spent one night here after disembarking from a cruise. For what I was looking for, the hotel was perfect. It is just a few blocks from the airport, and is convenient for folks heading out of town. The location on Harbor Island is very pretty, and there are gorgeous views of downtown and the marina from many of the rooms. When we arrived, our room was dirty but we were quickly upgraded to a Club Level room. The room itself was nice, if not spectacular. The continental breakfast that is one of the "Club Level" perks was great - no complaints and pretty much a real breakfast. We paid $105 per night on Priceline for the hotel. If you are staying in San Diego for an extended period of time/vacation, I'm not sure I would recommend this hotel, just because of the location. You can't really walk to anything, and if you are running around the city, cab fare would probably add up. That said, you would probably do fine with a rental car here, since most of the downtown attractions are very close.

<Title>“Not great....”
<Content>I suppose my expectations were a bit high, but I was pretty dissapointed. I was here for a conference at the hotel, so didn't have to worry about traveling away from the hotel. On the positive, the shuttle from the airport to the hotel went fine. It was only when I got to the hotel.... First, the guy who checked me in didn't ask what kind of room I needed and I ended up in a room with 2 small beds rather than 1 king. That's the least bothersome aspect of my experience, but still slightly annoying considering everything else. When I got to my room (which was in a great location overlooking the pool and marina) I searched high and low to find the information binder so I knew how late the restaurants and pool were open. I finally called the front desk to ask for one, and the one I got had whole sections missing! They must not pay attention to these things.... I also asked for my desk chair to be replaced because the chair was so gross I didn't want to sit on it. The seat and back were full of stains and other grime, and there was grime on the armrests. Gross. The housekeeping lady gave me a little hassle about the request, but ultimately got me a new chair, which was slightly less gross than the first one. I did find out how late the pool and hot tube were open, by the way. The hot tub was not nearly as hot as it should have been, and the nasty smell of cigerette butts all over the ground around the tub took much away from the experience. The shower also wasn't great. The shower head was old and difficult to change the stream. The string that goes across the shower to hang wet clothes was completely missing. My final complaint: who hangs mirrors (or other glass) over the bed in an earthquake zone?????? I've only been living in an earthquake zone (San Francisco) for less than 2 years, but even I know better! Bottom line: The hotel is decent, and at first glance the room is nice. And the room was quiet, which is definitely important. However, I think what makes a nice hotel (especially for business travel) is paying attention to the details. This hotel does not pay attention to the details, and the overall experience of staying here reflects that. I'm glad I wasn't paying for this room, and unless required for work again, I won't stay here again.

The rooms were nice, but could use a little updating, but overall quite nice. The pools looked great, we only ate at Quinns, the food was good (its like a sports bar) but it was quite loud. Overall we had a great time and would definitley go back.

<Title>“Don't stay here - too noisy!”
<Content>Horribly noisy hotel. You would think that a hotel across the street from the airport would have noise remediation but the walls were even thinner than usual. The decor is nice, and the staff is friendly and efficient, but you will not get any sleep here. The views of the harbor from both sides are utterly destroyed by the noise of the airplanes. You also hear everything your neighbors are doing (I mean, EVERYTHING). Not pleasant. My room smelled of body odor that wasn't mine. I was not able to get any sleep at all. Most egregious was the energy-efficient thermostat. You could only manually get the fan to blow on high for five minutes, then it switches automatically to "auto." So, no hope for white noise to drown out the other noises.

<Content>We stayed at this property because of the proximity to the starting line for the San Diego International Triathlon, which we had friends participating in. I am a Starwood Preferred Member and at arrival I was told by the Starwood Rep that I was the Guest of the Day. I was given free parking and an upgrade to the Club Level which included a cocktail reception and free continental breakfast. This was just an added bonus. The hotel it beautifully decorated, the staff was friendly and helpful. The room was very comfortable. The hotel is very close to the airport but noise was not a problem. This would make it convenient who may have a layover. I would definately recommend this hotel. We couldn't have had a better stay!

<Title>“Newly Renovated Waterfront Hotel”
<Content>This is a large scale Hotel on the Marina at Shelter Island. It has a blue white and red nautical motif in the large lobby complete with massive salt water aquarium. There is an open wi-fi area overlooking the boats/marina,and several different types of flavored water greeting the arrival of its jogging clients. The food at the lobby bar is basically pub type fare. The rooms are clean and bright with flat screen tv's and baconies with great views. In my opinion this is one of the nicer sheratons. It has an incredible fitness center and large pool area.

<Title>“Outstanding!!”
<Content>Stayed four nights for a conference. The hotel is directly across Harbor Drive from the airport. There was some airport noise, but from my room it was minimal. I highly recommend that someone planning to stay here sign up for the Starwood Preferred Guest program as they seem to provide a whole floor for members. I really liked getting the two liters of complementary water every day--beats paying the normally exhorbitant prices! They also had coffee and tea in the elevator lobby on this floor. A nice touch. I stayed in the East tower in a corner room furthest from the airport, which partly explains the low aircraft noise. I had a balcony overlooking San Diego harbor and was able to watch the sun set over Point Loma as well as watch ships coming in and leaving from the Pacific. Pretty cool. Beds were very comfortable, the cleaning staff wonderful and the downstairs staff very friendly and approachable. Parking is a bit steep, but I believe it is true anywhere downtown. Took five minutes to get to the freeways, maybe ten to get to Gaslamp Quarter. Overall a great stay and I highly recommend it!

I was very surprised...first of all, they put us in the West Tower, which is farthest away from the airport. The room had a beautiful marina view, and the furnishings were great. The bed wad very comfortable and the room was good sized. I would definitely stay here again, especially for the price.

<Content>We recently stayed 5 nights at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. It was our first trip to San Diego and this hotel was responsible for us falling in love with the city. The concierge was very helpful in sending us out on day excursions based on our interests and overall the staff was very friendly. The breakfast buffet at $20 was worth every penny - the food was fabulous and the view of the bay made it even better. The pool, the hot tub, and the workout facility were all top notch. If you are a jogger, you will love the scenic trail that will take you all the way downtown with a harbor view the entire run. Will definitely stay at this hotel in future trips to SD.

<Title>“Excellent hotel”
<Content>I stayed here three nights after a cruise. Was given room 5207 in the Lanai area. This is a four storey building connected to the East Wing and has its own pool and hottub. This is a very nice hotel. The gardens and pool areas are beautiful. You have the marina on one side and the harbour on the other. A free shuttle takes you to the airport and from there you can take the bus downtown. The walk to the airport only takes 5 - 10 minutes. I paid US$119 per night for single occupancy (total $402.86 including taxes) . Lobby has free internet computers. Buffet breakfast was $21. Expensive but excellent. I would certainly stay here again. andrew

Very good food and good prices. Was a great way to start our day. Parking was $20/day with in/out access. The parking was billed on our room bill. Booked thru Expedia and room rate was discounted a LOT because we stayed 5 days. We were VERY pleased with the 5 day rate! Hotel is so close to attractions that driving was never a issue as in 20 minutes we could be to most trourist spots. We would come back anytime!!

<Title>“Not quite what you pay for”
<Content>Just finished a 3 night stay here for a conference. My room was clean, very comfortable bed, a work desk and a small couch. Nice but really not that different from, say, a Courtyard Mariott. Yes it is near the airport and you can hear the airplanes, but it didn't bother me. Shuttle bus runs every 15 minutes or so to the airport, but if you are travelling light, the weather is good and don't mind a 20 - 30 minute walk that is actually dooable. I jogged each day around harbor island and that was great - there are numerous park benches to sit and enjoy the views of the bay and downtown. The gym is in the East tower, and is a good 5 minute walk from the west tower where I stayed and is an extra charge, even for guests. They call it East and West tower, but really they are pretty much 2 completely seperate properties. Internet access is extra, like $11 or so a day. In summary, a good hotel with convenient airport access in a beautiful location, but in all a little pricey for what you get and typical of full service hotels, you have to pay for extras like gym and internet access (no free continental breakfast here)

<Title>“Nice but,,,,”
<Content>My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in Sept. The hotel is across from the Airport. We stayed at the West tower, newer than the East tower but it show's it's wear. I received a reduced rate due to a Conference at the hotel. The view from the hotel is great! A bit loud starting @6:30 A.M. this is when the planes start taking off from the San Airport, from the West tower is is tollerable. Upon arriving they put us in the East tower, even though I had a King bed in the West reserved, I said OK as long as I could get a King(none avaialable) we ended up in the West with a king. The room was OK, but stains on the Carpet and the bathroom was not cleaned(not good). Went to the front desk, told them they said they would take care of it(they never did), The next day(evening) we came back to the room finding the lock on the floor, it feel off the door(it is the security lock that is swong over, not the main door handle lock. This was fixed in about 1 hour, they used platic inserts to fill the stripped screw holes and bigger screws. The bathroom had tiles missing and plaster on the floor. lighting is terrible!!! The good: resteraunts are excellent and the View, The bad: you are stuck in the middle of Harbor Island, you will need a cab to go to Old town, or gaslamp($15) each way, it's worth it. We the consumers are paying allot for rooms that are below par,,we should complain!!! I did send them an email,,,but no reply yet.... The Sheraton is squizing every dollar out of this place!!!

<Title>“Very nice”
<Content>We were invited to an event that required spending the night. We were very pleasantly surprised by how nice the property is, especially for the price. We were automatically upgraded to a suite overlooking the marina. Our room was spacious, the bathroom was on the smaller side & we had a flat screen TV. The room was clean & staff was courteous. We didn't experience too much airport noise even though it is in close proximity. If we'd paid more I would have expected a lot more.

<Title>“Not what I had hoped for.”
<Content>We stayed at this Sheraton in Aug 2007. I do not think it is as nice as other Sheratons we have stayed in. The place is huge and upon first entering our room everything looked clean and very nice. After taking a shower I was disgusted to find I picked up hair balls on my feet walking from the bathroom to the bed. Quite a chunk of hairball, I might add. Sometimes a "rotten egg" odor would come from the bathroom and hang around for about 15 minutes. I assume the order came from the sink drains or bath drain. We could hear every word the people in the adjoining rooms were saying. Oddly, we could not hear the typical banging of hotel doors. The elevators worked very well. This is a huge hotel and whoever takes care of the elevators should be congradulated. The self parking worked ok. I believe it is $20 per night. The parking attendants let you in, then let you out. This is fine in a location where parking fees are normally steep anyway. The hotel looked very clean and we had a balcony room on a high floor with a good view. A few days after we checked out I received a master card charge for about $4.50 for a bottle of drinking water we did not open in the room. All in all, I will go back to staying at the Best Western on Harbor Drive. The parking there is free, the quick breakfast there is free, there are balcony view rooms, I can pick up the same hairballs on my feet, and I have never been charged for services I did not order. And the Bestwestern is probably half the price.

<Title>“Beautiful rooms with a great view”
<Content>Nice nautical decor in the West Tower. Beds very comfortable, but only double size. The room was very spacious and had a perfect view of the harbour. Of our 2 week trip of travelling, this was my families' favorite hotel. The pool was warm and big enough to handle several visitors. The hotel staff was very helpful in recommending and finding some restaurants we wanted to go to.Check out the Boat House Restaurant in walking distance of the hotel (near the Hilton). They have daily specials. For example, the lobster dinner is $11.95 on Wednesdays. We got a great deal on our room through San Diego Central Reservations at 1-800-434-7894. We were flying home from San Diego, so this hotel was in a great location. You couldn't get much closer to the airport than this hotel - a 2 minute drive. Surprisingly, being this close to the airport was not a problem. Did not notice noise from the plane traffic. We would definitely, stay at this hotel again.

<Title>“Nice Hotel...if you get a good price!”
<Content>Had a nice July stay at this hotel. We received a very good rate and stayed in the West Tower. I would not recommend the West Tower for families with young children. The walk to the East Tower does get old for the little ones. The East Tower has a much nicer lobby and is generally the hub of this hotel. The pool area is much nicer in the East Tower. The West Tower is a bit of a walk from the East Tower and it might as well be called a completely different hotel. The rooms are bigger, but the West Hotel does not have the more "upscale feel" of the East Tower. If you are a family traveling or have folks in your party with mobility issues....definitely request the East Tower. You will find the nice restaurants, lounges, pools and other amenities in the East Tower.

<Title>“Great Hotel”
<Content>I have stayed at this property several times and each time my stay has been great. I have not had any trouble with airport noise and the accomodations are far superior to what I would expect of a Sheraton. Every hotel staff person that I encountered was friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel highly. If you are not traveling for business, the location is a bit secluded and you will need to take a cab into the downtown area as it is several miles to walk there and you would need to walk on a busy street. If you rent a car, the parking fees at the hotel are a bit steep as well. Overall, excellt experience!

<Title>“Customer Service Lacking, lovely hotel grounds”
<Content>This hotel is perfect if you're traveling for business and attending a conference. It is far from perfect if you are traveling for pleasure/vacation. My boyfriend and I were visiting San Diego for a wedding and decided to book through hotwire.com. We landed the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. I had read reviews on trip advisor that the west tower had bigger, updated rooms but was further from the action and that the east tower was closer to everything but with smaller "lanai" rooms. When we arrived at the hotel (east tower) we were told that we were actually staying in the West Tower. I asked to be switched to an East Tower high room but was told that the hotel was overbooked and I should be happy I even have a room! (Nice, right?). So we drove over to the west tower, parked the car ($20 per night!), and unloaded our bags to find out that we were actually staying at the east tower. So we had to gather our things back to the car and drive over to the east tower where we were basically ignored to find our way to our room without any help with our luggage. The lack of organization and service was very disappointing. There was a large Enterprise convention going on at the hotel and it seems the staff was too busy helping those on business to help us out. We were given a subpar Lanai room on the 2nd floor with a less than stellar view. There is no safe in the room and water is $4.00. The room itself was standard. One of the restaurants was closed while we were there for the Enterprise convention. A cab ride to the Gaslamp district was about $15.00 with tip. The pool at the east tower is really nice. We never had to worry about finding a lounge chair and the view of the harbor is beautiful. At check out we were charged for 4 nights of parking even though we only had a car for one night. Ultimately I felt that the money we saved by booking through hotwire would have been better spent on a hotel closer to downtown. I will not stay here again and do not recommend it to travelers. I would recommend the hotel to people looking for a conference spot.

<Title>“Wonderful Experience(Don't uderstand the bad reviews!)”
<Content>First of all I want to say that I cannot believe some of the totally negative reviews that have posted recently. It's almost like these travelers were staying at a different hotel... My husband and I took our two kids (12 & 14) for a 6 night stay at the beginning of July. We love San Diego, and this was our 4th stay at The Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. My 14 year old son chose to return here for his Middle school graduation gift as he & his sister always have a great time. I had actually contacted the hotel in response to the general---We looking forward to seeing you--- email that you receive after booking on the Hotel website. I addressed the email to Robert Cartwright, the Hotel's General Manager telling him that we would be returning and the reason for our visit, and to request a Marina/pool view room. I had booked a Club Level room in the East Tower as we truly enjoy the Club Lounge and the great views that it offers. I actually prefer the rooms over in the West Tower as they are larger, have a bigger balcony and I like their nautical theme, but there is no Club Level in the West Tower. After sending the email with my room request, I received a l reply from Mr. Cartwright.I was truly impressed by this very personal touch, but that was just the beginning! I checked in at the Starwood Preferred Guest check- in area, while my family waited outside with the car. I was told that we had a 2 rooms reserved for six nights, and I said there must be some mistake as I had actually only reserved one room. As it turns out, Mr. Cartwright really took great care of us. He gave us 2 adjoining rooms on the 9th floor, and while the 9th floor is not on the Club Level as I had reserved, the rooms are basically the same and we still had access to the Club Lounge. My kids were over the moon that they got there own room! It truly made our stay so much more comfortable to have that extra space for the week. We were also given complimentary valet parking for the duration of our stay! Now, I know some of you are probably thinking, of course after this special treatment I am going to give the hotel a great review, but if you knew me you would know that would not alter my judgment in anyway. It wasn’t just the way that Mr. Cartwright made us all feel that made this such a great trip, but also many other members of the staff, from the front desk, to the wait staff, the concierge desk, the valet parking staff and bell hops, the gym staff, the bartenders, even the housekeeping and maintenance personnel. Every single hotel employee that we encountered were happy, friendly and truly accommodating people. And in my opinion, it is the people that are employed by a hotel that truly make a difference between a wonderful hotel stay and a so-so experience. You can be in the most luxurious hotel suite, in the most incredible location, but if the service and hospitality are not 5 star you are not going to be happy! We never had a bad meal at the hotel. The kids loved room service and food from Shoreline. the poolside restaurant. My husband and I liked Tapatini, and we all liked the Sunday brunch at Harbor’s Edge. Some meals we charged to the room and some we paid cash for so the hotel bill didn’t feel quite so bad at the end of our stay. But like the MasterCard commercials say “Quality time with your family, Priceless!” We took some great walks along the harbor in the morning, but my favorite part of the day was sitting on the balcony with a glass of wine just gazing at the sunset over the marina. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone just based on the staff alone. We will definitely be returning to the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina on our next trip to San Diego. p.s. Another wonderful thing about this and many other hotels in the Starwood hotel group is that they welcome small dogs; but please if you are going to bring along your pet, only do so if you can trust your pet to be well behaved, that it won’t make a “mess” in the room, won’t bark at all hours and you as the dog’s caretaker take full responsibility for cleaning up after their walks. It is a privilege to be able to have your dog along, please don’t abuse that privilege!

<Title>“Disappointment at the San Diego Sheraton Marina”
<Content>This hotel's location so close to the airport creates way too much noise. Being on the waterfront with all the beautiful boats was nice, and the resort is physically attractive, but it is isolated from the city, and the constant airplane noise was really intrusive. Flights began before dawn, waking my spouse; I woke at 7:30 when the hotel staff began leaf-blowing in the parking lot under our window. The lobby restaurant in the East tower had fine views, but their prices were steep and the food was good but not great. The breakfast buffet was much better than dinner and offered some unusual touches: cheese blintzes and a multi-layered egg torta with several fillings. Good stuff. The staircase between floors was ugly and institutional, making it easy to opt for the elevator, even to go down just a single flight to my son's room. It's a shame they are stuck with this mixed bag of a location: a pretty marina and swimming pools, but an ugly, noisy airport right across the way.

<Title>“Best Hotel Experience Ever”
<Content>Long story short I loved my stay so much this is what I emailed to Sheraton directly: I recently stayed at your hotel for a 5 night 6 day conference that was taking place at the San Diego Convention Center. I must say that this hotel is the best hotel I have EVER stayed in my entire life. I've stayed at a many places in New York, Rome, Chicago, Florida, Newport etc everything from the Millineum in Manhattan to the Ritz in Sarasota. From the moment we got there by the Sheraton airport shuttle our stay was magnificent. I brought my girlfriend with me on this business trip because I had a feeling it would soon turn to pleasure. Everything about your hotel is fantastic. The gigantic pool(s) is amazing and the courtesy of the serving staff out there is impeccable. Particularly a guy named Steve working at the Shoreline resteraunt. That guy had the whole place smiling and laughing. The Harbor Inn Resteraunt breakfasts were some of the best Ive had in awhile. Quinns was excellent. The best martinis and the food was great. The room was perfect maid service perfect. The ladies at the Concierge Desk were the most polite people I think Ive ever met! They were such a great help! Overall, my girlfriend and I could not believe the outstanding service that we were experiencing for 6 DAYS IN A ROW. Everyone of the employees was so nice from the gyms guy giving me towels to the wait staff at Harbor Inn to the front desk. Even the security officers asked us if we were alright and needed anything. If I was a freaking millionaire I would live at your hotel. When I come back to San Diego I am DEFINITELY staying at your hotel. Freaking amazing. Your star rating should be waaaaay over than what it is on some of these websites. Thank you for such a great experience. I will never forget it...END MESSAGE. Overall if youre going to San Diego and you book a room here be sure you book it in the East Tower on a high floor. Once you get that covered trust me you'll have no worries the whole time you're there. This hotel is awesome.

<Title>“Never Again!”
<Content>This was quite possibly the WORST stay I have ever experienced and I've stayed in some crap hotels that had a friendly and more knowledgeable staff than this joke of a hotel, not only was our room not ready when we arrived at 6pm, I was treated rudely by the front desk clerk and then he dismissed me to help someone else who got into their room right away. For $509.00 (tax included) a night I expected better service. When my room was ready my room key was tossed on the counter and we weren't even told how to get to it which tower or anything. We then called for a vending machine location were sent on a wild goose chase, never did find it. We called the concierge for a taxi and were told they had them on call and one would be, well we ended up driving our own vehicle, no taxis were available. The laziness of this staff was astonishing! No one at this hotel seemed to be friendly, willing to help or even apologize for their lack of quality service. I will never return to this hotel until changes in staff manners & knowledge of the facility are finally a part of this hotel.

<Title>“Isolated Hotel”
<Content>The hotel is a stone's throw from the San Diego airport. If your room faces the marina, you will hear the planes taking off and the balcony is of not much use due to the constant noise. However, the sliding glass door does a good job of shielding the noise. The lobby decor is in the marine theme and is very inviting. But, the arms on the chairs look pretty dirty even though the fabric was dark blue. I changed my room because the bathroom smelled and the paint was peeling on the bathroom ceiling. The second room was better. Decor is in blues and white with a touch of red. I attended a meeting with work and the food supplied by the hotel was very good - everything they served was tasty. Front staff was friendly and helpful and what you'd expect. The location of this hotel is not the best. It's on Harbor Island and it is very isolated. There is nothing else around there that is interesting. You have to get in your car to really enjoy the San Diego experience. There are a couple of restaurants down the road. I went to one and it's just not very lively around the hotel area. If you're looking for isolation and want to stay on the property, this place is OK if you don't mind jet noise. I'd stay somewhere else in the future that has places to eat, drink, and shop within walking distance, like around Seaport Village. This hotel does the best with what it has, but it can't change its location.

<Title>“Comfortable stay”
<Content>Stayed in West tower, which had large comfortable rooms. We were originally meant to stay in the East tower, but they could not give us adjoining/ adjacent rooms.This building seems much quieter than the east tower, which was perfect for us. The pool was smaller than the other two at the east tower, but always quiet- no fights for a sun bed! Although the hotel is situated near the airport, we were not bothered by aircraft noise at all.The restaurant in this building served excellent breakfasts, and the staff were very attentive. The restaurants in the other buildings were much busier. Room service was fast, efficient and good value for money. We did not have a car during our visit, so had to travel everywhere in taxis. These weren't too expensive, but were our only option, as the hotel is quite a distance from anything. There is no safe in the room, although safety deposit boxes are available at reception. This hotel was not cheap, but we would stay here again if we wanted to be near downtown San Diego.

<Content>Pretty decent overall. Very attentive staff. The room condition was great...everything was nice and neat. I had a lenai room but it looked directly at a fence surrounding the tennis court. Self parking is $20/night which i thought was steep. Hotel is not within walking distance to anything so it is somewhat like a resort for someone who wants to hang out at the hotel pool and see other San Diego sights by car. The property has a very large feel to it as well.

<Title>“Like a Resort -- near the airport!”
<Content>Great hotel with a wonderful location. Hotel sits on marina right near the airport. Airport noise is not noticeable though as the hotel is off the flight path. Marina is beautiful with sailboats, yachts, blue water and palm trees. Other side of hotel faces the bay and great views of Coronado Island and passing Navy ships. Room are spacious and comfortable. Rooms seemed newly renovated with nice furniture, tvs and comfortable beds and bedding. Very clean and quiet. Got a very good price on Hotwire. My only negative comment would be in the food category. While the hotel is situated nicely for views, ease to airport, downtown etc. if you do not have a car, you are captive to the hotel restaurant. Prices in the hotel for food were exhorbitant, though food was good. If you have a rental car, this should not be a problem -- just eat elsewhere. Overall a wonderful stay. Pleasantly surprised and would definitely stay here again!

<Title>“Brilliant views”
<Content>Our stay at the hotel was wonderful, I booked a room offering limited view and was placed on the 16th floor overlooking the harbour with all the small private boats and charters - definately more than a limited view. The hotel is clean and well kept with friendly and knowledgable staff. We were located in the main building which is advertised as being closer the airport and so may have problems with noise but this was definately not the case, plus this part of the hotel has the most features. We walked to the other building, about 5 minutes stroll and found it to be more sub-standard and looked aimed more at conferences. I would defaintely stay here again, we paid $100 a night which is my view was a bargain. Louise Rogerson

<Title>“Nice Hotel Close to the Airport”
<Content>I attended a conference in the East Tower but chose to stay in the West Tower for the larger nicer rooms. Our room in the West Tower was indeed very nice and quite large, with a nice view of the harbor. The walk to the East Tower is not bad, but it gets kind of old after the second day. The East Tower has larger and nicer pools, dining, and bars, so I would probably stay there in the future, although the West Tower was very quiet. Best part of the hotel is a 5 minute ride (actually less) from the airport. Also nice is that it is a great place for a morning jog around Harbor Island. Worst part is that the on-site restaurants are very expensive and you have to take a cab to go anywhere off the island (actually the city bus passes right in front of the hotel if you are really trying to get downtown cheap).

<Title>“Very good stay”
<Content>After getting this hotel via a Priceline bid and reading the reviews..I was expecting to hate the property. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Originally assigned to the West Tower (told this by the shuttle driver)..I decided to ask for the east tower based on the comments here. I went to the SPQ desk at the east tower and was given Room 706 . It was on the smallish side..but clean with a great marina view. I felt the staff was professional and accomodating and would not hestiate to stay here again.

<Title>“Would Not Stay Here Again..Definiteily Has Its Problems”
<Content>I booked this hotel through Priceline and got a rate of $105/night..That is likely the only positive to my hotel experience at the Sheraton. The con's first -Location (Literally next to the airport..Noise, traffic, and there isn't anything to do in walking distance from the hotel, i.e. restaurants. Like the others before me said, it's a good $15 cab ride one way into 'town') -Parking ($20/day to park in a dirt lot. It wasn't very lit and our car was covered in dirt when we checked out. Also, the lot isn't covered. For $20/day I expected more) -Lack of Clealiness (Hotel wasn't clean..The carpet in the hallways was worn, dirt on the walls, dirty sheets with holes and the bathroom was the worst..There was a TON of black hair in the shower. The vents in the bathroom were coated in a heavy layer of dirt) -No free Wifi or internet in the rooms (They were charging $14 for a 24 hour period for the internet..Ridiculous) -Restaurants (Food wasn't great and was extremely expensive..$14 for eggs in the morning??!!) The pros: -Pool (Pool was nice and they served drinks poolside, located next to the harbor which was great) -Price (If you shop around, you can get a good rate I'm sure..We did on Priceline)

<Title>“Great hotel for our purposes”
<Content>We stayed at the hotel last week and booked our room through the sandiego.org customer service line at a very reasonable rate of $129 per night. This rate was available only through sandiego.org phone line and not on their website. We loved the location, the room (West tower) and the pools. We thought that everyone was very friendly, helpful, and went out of their way to accommodate our requests. One of the employees told me that Sheraton was trying to change their image via a new training program for all employees and that one of their goals was to accommodate guests' needs, etc. My sister is a Starwood preferred member and had us upgraded to the Starwood floors (9th and above?). We really liked the West tower as it was less hectic than the East tower during check-in and in the evenings. The restaurants were good and no more expensive than other hotel restaurants. You can hear planes take off as you're next to the airport, but this did not interrupt our sleep, as planes stop flying after midnight or so. We would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Business Hotel”
<Content>I stayed here on business and saw many other business travelers on a conference. I would not recommend this hotel for a family vacation spot. It is literally located 5 minutes from the aiport by shuttle, so you will hear the airplanes landing and taking off all day and night. If you stay here ask for a room with a pool and marina view if not you will be facing the main street with a parking lot view - not pretty at all! I would also ask for a renovated room - the pictures on their website are not like the room I stayed in. My room was very outdated, the rugs needed to be change - dirty and stained. The bedding felt old and the room had very bad lighting. This hotel needs a lesson on cleanliness. I found hair on my bedsheets and in the tub. Also, some type of bug was crawling in the bathroom - yuck! This hotel is also about a $12 cab ride to downtown San Diego where all the shops and eateries are.

<Title>“Most of the stay was good, however...”
<Content>First off, if you book through Hotwire or Priceline, they'll try to put you in something called a "Lanai" room. From all I've heard, you'll want to avoid these rooms...so I called and pleasantly asked to be moved to the west tower....and I was accomodated. That was definitely pleasant. Not pleasant?? 20 bucks for parking. Any great deal you think you're getting because a little less great after that. Overall, the room was nice. The main issue was that I could hear people talking in an adjacent room until after midnight. Since the walls to adjoining rooms were concrete, I have to assume it was a person either above or below me...either way, it was distracting and limited my sleep. We STILL paid 110 bucks for this through Priceline...and if I would have had earplugs, it'd definitely be all worth it.

<Title>“4-star price for 2-star quality”
<Content>I stayed in the West Tower during a 4-day meeting I attended in early June, 2007. Check-in was smooth. My room was spacious but dark. The only light switch controlled a single low-wattage bulb by the door. I had to stumble around in the dark to turn on individual lamps. There were black and brown stains on my sheets when I checked in. I requested that these be changed, and they were replaced with sheets that merely had brown stains and were torn and threadbare. In the bathroom, there had been a leak in the wall behind the toilet, and the wall was moldy with the wallpaper peeling off the wall. There had been no attempt to fix the wall. There was hair in the sink. My impression, based solely on walking through the lobby and attending my meeting, is that the East Tower (a completely separate building) is a much nicer, cleaner, and more updated building. (Note that I did not actually see any of the hotel rooms in the East Tower.) There are many more restaurants, bars, meeting rooms, and business facilities in the East Tower than the West Tower. If I had to attend a meeting at this hotel again, I would stay at the hotel only if I were not personally paying the bill and if I had a room in the East Tower.

<Title>“Not a bad stay, More a 3 star hotel, would not rate a 4”
<Content>Overall it wasn't a bad stay. You are very close to the airport but you don't hear the planes. Room was clean, bed was comfortable. Balcony was small but would fit two chairs, small table. Pool was okay, could have been nicer. Restaurant had good food but for the price you can find better. I would give this hotel a solid 3 stars. Definitely not a 4 star hotel. Would return if the price was right.

<Title>“Pleasantly Surprised”
<Content>Based on previous reviews, when I discovered that this was the hotel assigned to me by Priceline...I was scared! However, I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was smooth. Stayed in a room in the east tower adjacent property. The adjacent section seemed to be a little older then the main lobby building but definitly nicer looking then the outside of the east tower. Room was not extravegant but clean and modern looking. Very comfortable bed and pillows. Sunday brunch was amazing! I'd go back just for the brunch. Walked all around the hotel and the grounds are very nice. Tennis courts, two pools, work out room and a game room kept my kids busy. I actually wished we were staying more then one night so we could enjoy the facilities more. Hotel is right on the marina so you get to enjoy the boats and the water. Excellent location, easy to get to Zoo, Gaslamp district, ect. I would definitly stay here again.

<Title>“There are better hotels in the area”
<Content>This hotel was troublesome from the beginning. Not everything that went wrong was their fault, but they couldn't make anything right. I went there with a colleague to attend a conference. This is a large property and we were put in rooms at opposite ends of the complex. A walk from one end to the other took 17 minutes, mostly outdoors. This wasn't a hardship because the weather was beautiful, but it made it tougher to meet up for breakfast or classes. The problem was that when we checked in, they couldn't find two rooms for us that were closer. The complex consists of several buildings. The East Tower is the most centrally located. There are Lanai rooms that are at one end, and then far away in the other direction is the West Tower. The rooms in the West Tower are bigger, away from everything else, and non-smoking. The conference center was closest to the East Tower. The rooms weren't particularly clean. My colleague's room had a nasty-looking stain on the bedspread. My room had a big stain on the carpet. The rooms that I saw didn't have safes or refrigerators but they did have coffee makers. There was noise from the nearby airport but I expected it to be worse than it was. The staff were uniformly friendly and smiling, but generally not helpful. As a second example, the person at the desk in the West Tower offered to make a dinner reservation for us at a restaurant in the Gaslamp district on a Friday night, but she told me that the restaurant was sold out. We drove down there anyway expecting to find another restaurant, but the restaurant that we wanted was happy to seat us right away. As with so many things, they might not have been responsible but it seemed like they had a hard time doing anything that was actually helpful. None of the doors which were supposed to automatically lock at night ever actually locked. Guests have an odd habit of defeating security measures and maybe that had something to do with it, but apparently the locks weren't working. In reality, we didn't suffer at the Sheraton. The food was good, the drinks and tapas at the bar were generous, and the staff was friendly. But there are so many nicer places to stay in the area that I'd pick someplace else unless there was a really good reason (for example, a conference on the property) to stay at this Sheraton.

<Title>“Not Impressed, expected better from a Sheraton”
<Content>Although the hotel is only a short free shuttle from the airport and the bed is soft and nice, overall I was not too impressed with this hotel. At $250/night (conference discount rate not including tax), the accommodation was only so-so. My garden room was in the Lanai section of the East wing, a very long walk from the lobby; it faced a fence and with the door open you could hear the planes overhead. The door was supposed to be double locked but I could not find the 2nd lock. When I arrived, the problems in the bathroom made it seem like no one had been there for a while: a couple dead bugs on the floor, 2 vials of shampoo but no conditioner, a broken light, the bathroom fan sounded like a rusty helicopter, and low shower pressure-- lots of water came out the bath faucet instead of the through the shower head when the diverter was pulled. It also seemed they were trying to squeeze a dime out of their customers for everything. Examples of the extra charges, which many lower-rate hotels provide no charge or have much better value: - My electronic check-in sheet declared that I would be charged 75 cents for a copy of USA Today outside my door each morning-- and to refuse the paper I should notify the front desk. Despite this notice, I actually never got any papers or charges. - The wired internet charge from the room was high-- if I recall it was ~$8 for 30 minutes and $~14 for 24 hrs, yikes. - To use the exercise room/health club is $10 per day. - Breakfast items in the restaurant are at a high premium. - Bottled water in the room-- if you partake in it, charges you $4/bottle. My friend was staying in the east wing upper floors and she found her room was out of date and the amenities quite chintzy for a hotel that charges $275/night.

<Title>“I agree, not 4 stars”
<Content>We got the room for a decent enough rate through priceline, so I can't complain too much, but the 4 star properties we've had in San Diego in the past for a similar rate were so much nicer, that I felt compelled to leave this review. Like the previous poster, we too were given a room in the West tower. There's nothing else over there, and the East tower is a good drive away, so we never enjoyed any of the hotel amenities. That being said, you don't feel like you are anyplace special, because you basically have to go to another hotel to enjoy restaurants, bar, spa services, etc. What's the point of paying for them if you have to go somewhere else to enjoy them? The view was nice when we first checked into our room (harbor, Coronado bridge, a bit of the city) but we were moved around midnight thanks to a plumbing problem, and the new room looked out onto the marina and airport. Still decent, but not nearly as nice. The room was spacious and comfortable, decorated in a nautical theme, which was fitting, but the bathroom was tiny, the towels coarse, and the pillows old and lumpy (glad we brought our own). My beef with the hotel is this....while I appreciate that they moved us to another room after trying to repair the plumbing problem, I felt it would have been a nice touch for them to do more than continually turn our message light on at odd hours for us to call and let us know they were sorry. On both nights I was awakened by the blinking light, so I call only for them to say they were sorry. It was annoying to say the least and if you are going to keep calling, at least get it right and remove the charges for the internet (that we reserved in the first room) but were unable to use in the second room without me having to continually remind you. I feel the service feature of the call was poorly handled and was really more of a procedural annoyance than a measure to ensure my true satisfaction.

<Title>“Four stars? I don't think so”
<Content>I was checked in on the West side building instead of the tower building. The lobby looks more like a 3 stars trying really hard to look nice. The ground floor king bed room that I was given looks old and tired. One of the lamp does not work and while the room is spacious, there are not enough furnitures to fill the room so it looks a bit empty. Asides from the amenities, it is not much better than the average Four Points. The Westin Horton Plaza is a better value and location.

<Title>“ok place”
<Content>Stayed for over a week here on business in February 2007. The hotel is split into two towers. Most of the activities are in the East and unfortunately I was in the West. There is only a short walk between them though. Hotel is very very close to the airport and as a result, I found it quite noisy because you could always hear airplanes taking off. Room was fine, a good size and was clean but looked like it could do with some renovation especially in the bathroom. Room service was good and the staff were generally very good.

<Title>“Great Bed!”
<Content>Arrived after midnight with a reservation for the north (remote) tower. Was not looking forward to shlepping our bags over there, etc but no problem. The very gracious desk clerk (lady from upstate NY) changed our room to the main tower. Awoke to a brilliant sunrise and view of downtown over the hotel parking lot. Room had a small balcony. The bed was extremely comfortable and big. Nice soft comforter and plush linens. When I phoned the front desk to advise the shower was only lukewarm, they reversed the parking charge. Enjoyed the upscale breakfast buffet - waited a few minutes on a Saturday a.m. for a window seat and felt we were dining at a yacht club. Impeccable service - a great start that left us fueld for most of the day - a v. good value. Conceriege was lovely with dinner recommendation and reservation. Valet had car up front with luggage loaded after breakfast, ready for us to take off to our destination. It's a great location - didn't have to hunt for it after arriving on a late flight - right across from the airport - and it was a good value at around $200 for the room. Paid a lot more for a lot less in other places. I'm definitely staying here again.

<Title>“unless your company is paying, its a ripoff..”
<Content>I stayed here with my husband (who was attending a trade show held at the hotel) for 4 nights. I read the reviews before going (tagging along for a cheap vacation to San Diego) so I had my expectations set low on what appeared to be a place that gouges for everything. I wasn't disappointed. We rented a car for 2 days so we could get around for 2 days on our own. If you stay at this hotel, you either need a car or get taxis if you want to get away from the hotel. We valeted the car for literally 1 hour when we checked in. Then we went back out for dinner and then self-parked the car overnight. When we got the hotel bill at the end, they of course were charging us $24/night for the entire stay (i.e. valet price for 4 nights). My husband on checkout told them we only had a rental car for 2 days and valeted the car for an hour and self-parked overnight. The 'resolution' to this apparently was to charge us ONLY for 2 nights of self parking. It was my husband's company paying the bill so I stayed out of it, but if my money was paying for this, I would have argued more at the front desk. That was the only mistake on the bill we had. The room we got on checkin had double sized beds and we requested king size bed and had to pay an extra $50/night for that. That bumped us up to the Club level room and gave us a city view which was nice. We got free contential breakfast and evening horderves and free internet for that $50 as well. The breakfast was nice (but they normally charge $12/head for it which again was nuts when no hot food was included). The horderves was also normally charged $12/head and again, was not worth the price. It was nice, but we got there one night during the last 45 minutes of it and hardley anything was left and they didn't refill anything. I rented a bike one day (which was $7/hour) and it was nice (a way to get some exercise and away from the hotel). The pool was outside and kind of chilly to go into so didn't get to try it out. I would never stay here if I was paying with my own money. They overcharge for everything and its obvious they know most people staying here don't care cause an expense account is probably paying the bill. The room we stayed in was clean and nice, but as other reviews have said, the walls are thin and we did hear noise often from the room next door to us. I once heard someone listening to their voicemail through the walls, which seems to be a sign of thin walls!

<Title>“Staff was helpful”
<Content>The hotel was a nice hotel in a good location between the marina and San Diego Bay. The hotel should do a better job, however, in letting people know that this hotel is actually divided into two separate towers which are almost a mile away from each other. The room I stayed in was clean and well appointed. The bathroom was a bit dated, but otherwise it was a good room with a balcony overlooking the marina.

<Title>“You get what you pay for!”
<Content>My family and I have just returned from a five night stay at this hotel. I made the mistake of booking this hotel using one of those discount internet services. First and last time I'll do that again. I had put in a request for a 4-star accomodation thinking I would be given a reservation at either the Omni, Hyatt or Intercontinental hotel as shown in their example. But , no...it was the Sheraton Marina and Harbor instead. I was both surprised and disappointed. First of all, this property is NOT a 4-star accomodation, and this booking service should not be falsely advertising it as such. We arrived at almost 1am after a late flight. I had previously called the hotel to request a late arrival guarantee. Don't know if it was the late hour or the fact that I had booked through a discount broker, but the room we were given was on the ground floor. Not only did the noise of the airplanes from the nearby airport wake us up througout the night , but there was also heavy foot traffic outside our door in the busy hallway. One night , we had to listen to noisy teenagers out by the darkly lit pool area off our patio until midnight. Ditto on the self-parking situation. I think that $17 is ridiculous! (To valet park, it was $24 per day.) The lot was dirty, far away and very poorly lit. We were also double-charged by the hotel for the entire stay. Someone else with the same common last name must have gotten free parking! You had to give the lot attendant your room number along with your last name each time you left, so I'm not sure how the mistake kept getting made. Even as we left the lot for the last time, it happen again! Back to the front desk to clear it up. Lastly, the condition of the room was not that impressive. Certainly not 4-star standards. Ants in the bathroom and NEVER enough towels. Three out five nights I had to request (by note and phone) more towels and toiletries to the housekeeping staff. I reminded them that there were four in our party and not two. No newspaper on the first morning as well. San Diego and its weather was great however! The kids had a blast visiting all of the attractions. Also, note that there didn't seemed to be any reasonably priced restaurants on Harbor Island. A Von's grocery store was also a few miles away. Note there's no refrigerator or microwave in the room either. The location of the Sheraton worked for us, but the entire trip I felt deceived by the fact that I had basically stayed at a 3-star accomodation but thought I was paying for something much nicer. I guess in this situation the old adage, "you get what you pay for" holds true. Next time, I will book my hotel directly and not blindly through a discount hotel broker.

<Title>“Convenient Business Hotel”
<Content>It's been about 10 years since I last stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. The good news in the Starwood Brands are starting to merge and Sheratons are starting to feel more like Westons. As a Starwood gold member, I was upgraded. My bed was great and the room appeared to be recently refurbished. For the business traveler, it's hard to beat the convenience of the hotel - although getting anywhere requires the shuttle, a car or cab (and SD cabs are pricey - it's about $10 to the convention center). The staff at the hotel was great. Friendly and very helpful. I called the concierge about a rental car and the Enterprise bus was picking me up 5 minutes later! (another benefit of Enterprise is you can return the car at the hotel - just hand the keys to the front desk). For runners, especially those of us from land-locked locations, the scenery along the island and bay is great. The "north tower" is a bit isolated.

<Title>“View is to die for!”
<Content>Stayed two nights for my Mom's birthday. Check-in was fast and we were up to our 11th floor room in no time only to discover one king bed instead of our requested two doubles. Back to the front desk, I explained my situation and got the icy-cold "I couldn't care less" attitude. They said they would send up a rollaway as there were NO other rooms available. The view from this room was fabulous. Really enjoyed having a balcony... room was clean and fresh and appreciate the morning newspaper. Bottled water was complimentary, nicer than average toiletries, comfortable bathroom with good water pressure. Parking is an outrageous $17! I knew that going in from reading other reviews, but the kicker is the only spaces available were on dirt! So much for my nice clean car, it was toast by the time we left. Also upon check out they charged twenty bucks for the rollaway and REFUSED to reverse the charge even though I requested two beds and no charge for the rollaway was ever mentioned at the front desk. Let me tell you some of the employees here have a serious attitude problem. Overall I would probably stay here again based on the location, nice room and beautiful view.

My room was very beautifully equipped and decorated, bathroom was nice. Really, me and my girlfriend really enjoyed our stay there! Complimentary internet is offered in the lobby, which is great! Pleanty of restaurants and there's also a pub! Three swimming pools, one heated, gym and tennis fields. What could you ask more from a hotel?

<Title>“Great service!”
<Content>I was thoroughly impressed by my stay at this hotel. The location was very simple to get to from the airport (I could see it upon exiting) and our room had a nice little view of the harbor and boats. It was right off the main street that skirts the harbor and made for easy access to downtown (we had a rental car) and Rt. 5 (the highway that seemed to take us everywhere we wanted to go). The service was impeccable. From the woman who checked us in, to the woman who brought the room service, to the bar tender, to the concierge, to the woman who served us during our business lunch... everyone was friendly and efficient. They brought me things before I knew I needed them. Having the sports bar downstairs was a welcome addition when we came back after a full day and wanted a quick beer. The bar tender allowed us to sample the 2 local beers we were trying to decide between. The room was clean and large enough for 2 of us by far. The internet access in the lobby was also helpful for a quick email check.

<Title>“Isolated but comfortable”
<Content>I stayed here for a meeting. The hotel is close to the airport, but a bit isolated. If you are going here for a conference, it is probably so the organizers want you to stay put and not travel around too much. The hotel has two towers, one about a 1/2 mile from the other. The airport shuttle is convenient and free. Check in was courteous and professional. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I am a Starwood preferred guest, so I received a larger room on one of the top floors. The room was decorated very beachy, and the view of the Marina is great. My room was clean, and I received 2 free bottles of water upon check-in. The free soaps and shampoo are of high quality. I ordered room service one night. It was delivered within 15 minutes and probably the best gnocchi I have ever eaten. You will have to take a cab from this hotel to see any sights, but the hotel’s shuttle will drive you down the street if you’d like to get dinner at one of the pricier restaurants. The hotel bar and restaurant is very expensive, but good. Room service tacked on incredible price hikes. Overall, I enjoyed it. I wouldn’t stay here if I was a tourist though. A hotel in downtown where you could walk around would be more fun. I did, however, enjoy a mile long run along the ocean in front of the hotel.

<Title>“Great place, but a little bit expensive”
<Content>I have my first trip to San Diego this Feb. for a conference. The conference is held in Sheraton Hotel and Marina. I requested for a kingsize-bed room while I made reservation, but I got a twin-bed one. Though not in my expectation but it didn't bother me. The view is great, I had a harbor-view room and the sunset is gorgeous. Downtown view is also available since i have a room in the 7F. The room is just ok, have most basics you may need, but don't expect for a very luxurious room. Decoration is simple but a little bit dated. Bed is quite comfortable. Staffs are quite friendly. I had twice in-room dining, the waiters are very polite. Front desk is also good, provides useful information. I had a dinner in the Harbor's Edge, and enjoyed it very much. The only problem with this hotel is its food. They are a little bit expensive, though I was not in a tight budget, I still feel expensive. I have no idea in Parking since I didn't rent a car. If you wanna stay here and take buses to downtown, you should take route 992 but not route 923. I made a mistake and it almost killed my legs to find the route 923's stop.

<Title>“Lovely common areas, dirty rooms”
<Content>This was one of the worst hotel experiences in my life. This hotel has two separate buildings, the east and west towers. When I checked in at the west tower, the clerk was uneducated in the hotel's computer system. As the west tower is the less busy of the two, there was no one to help him and we had to wait about 30 minutes to complete the check in. This would have been nothing more than an annoyance, but the check in was not correct. When we drove to the other building to go to our room, we discovered that our room was in the old section of the hotel, about a 1/4 of a mile walk through a maze of hallways in the hotel complex. I am not exaggerating. I counted steps. I booked my travel through Priceline as an experiment, a mistake that I never will repeat. This hotel was listed and promised as a 4 star hotel. The hotel clearly treats Priceline customers like second-class citizens, but Priceline does not warn you of this fact. When we finally arrived at out room, the carpet was dirty, not just worn, the bathroom was rusty, vents were missing from the closet doors and there was one bed, although the check in clerk had supposedly booked in two queens. The room was a step down from a Motel 8. To the bellhops credit, he switched our room to an "upgraded" room for free, and he at least tried to help. We moved rooms to the main tower and were greeted by dirty (stubbed out cigarettes) hallways and our room was again dingy with beaten up furniture, a desk that was literally falling apart, lamps that had no working bulbs, etc. After settling in and unable to find a floor vending machine for a bottle of water, I decided to pay the $ 4.00 for the hotel's room bottle, only to find that the bottle had been previously opened! Yuck! I called the front desk to assure that the water would not be charged to me, and she comped me another bottle, but the fact that the bottle was not checked should tell you the level of cleaning in the hotel. In addition to the gross room, and I swear to the big G on this, our toilet actually backed up. I believe that the hotel maintenance staff knew that there was a problem with the toilet before we checked in because the lid was not fully on the toilet when we got in the room. All in all this was a disgusting experience. If the room had not already been paid for through Priceline, I would have switched hotels. I WILL NEVER STAY AT A SHERATON AGAIN.

<Title>“Very pleasant first time stay”
<Content>The hotel is located directly across from the airport. Parking choices are Valet $24/day or Self-Park (uncovered and short distance) for $17/day...both can be charged to your room with in-n-out privileges. We checked in very late - and our options were 2 beds in the "main" tower - or - a king (what we requested) in the other tower. We were tired - we took the 2 bed room in the main tower. It worked out - our room had a balcony that overlooked a harbo where MANY boats are moored (sp?) It overlooked the outdoor pool and walking trail or sidewalk. It was a very nice view. I think we were in room 1034. Our room had a connecting door to the next room - you could hear people loud and clear in the morning. I'm not sure if they were extra loud or the walls were paper thin (or the noises came through the clearance below the door). The bed was SO comfortable - it is my 2nd favorite bed behind the "Cloud 9" Westin bed in Oklahoma City. Bathroom was up to date and clean. We didn't try internet access. The magazines in the room were helpful - it even had a coupon for Harbor cruises that helped. The concierge (sp?) also has coupons and maps - stop by to see him/her. We stopped by the bar for one drink - it seemed nice. We didn't use any othe shop/cafe/restaurant in the main tower. The "other" tower was just 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile down the road - I'm sure it would have been fine. We did not use a taxi - but the concierge mentioned that it would cost @ $10 to go 4 miles (one way) over to the Marriott hotel (where our friends were) by the convention center. There are some parking meters near the tourist spots - they tend to run $.25 for 12 minutes - and there is a parking garage by the Nimitz aircraft carrier museum. Just thought I would toss that in in case you are trying to decide whether to rent a car or whether to take a taxi to your locations. We would definitely stay here again. We felt like we got a good price for the type of accomodations we received.

<Title>“What a view!”
<Content>Well, I used to live in San Diego, so I can honestly say this is a good central location, and a nice way to experience the look of San Diego...by staying at this Sheraton. The price was reasonable, the room had a great bay and city view, and there are very nice restaurants that are walking distance. The only complaint I would have is...that the carpets seemed old and dirty...more of an old motel carpeting than a high-class hotel. Time to give the maids a break and actually break out the funds for a thorough steam-cleaning! Everything else was top-notch, and we had a great time!

<Content>Beautiful hotel in Harbor Island; very close to downtown. The rooms are very good and very clean. The Lobby is beautiful, and the staff is amazingly helpful. The only thing bad is that the restaurants are extremly expensive, try to eat outside the hotel.

<Title>“Definitely deserves a return visit”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel & Marina for a 5-night stay during a conference held at the hotel in October. The hotel is located on Harbour Island and comprised of 2 towers: the East Tower being the larger and original tower; the West Tower being the smaller but newer tower. After reading the review on Trip Advisor, I made sure to request a room in the newler West Tower. (It turned out to be the better choice since the conference was held in the same tower!). Here's a run-down of my experience: Shuttle - very prompt and efficient. The shuttle runs regularly between the 2 towers and the San Diego airport (5 minutes away). I was also pleasantly surprised to find that the shuttle also drives guests to nearby restaurants on the island and if not available, the bellboy will drive you in the hotel's fleet of Town Cars. Check in - I arrived at 11am on an early flight in and was expecting to have to stow my luggage in storage until the standard check-in time of 3pm. They, however, had my room ready and upgraded me to a larger deluxe room on a higher floor. Staff were very helpful and courteous. Room - paid $259 USD / night which included the buffet breakfast (more on this later). The room had 1 king bed, a sofa, and desk. The room was extremely spacious but the washroom was a little cramped. Room was spotless and had a balcony overlooking the harbour. Housekeeping came daily and was finished before 11am. West tower - newly renovated but while it was the farther tower from the airport, you could still hear the planes coming and going. The West Tower has only 1 restaurant and a small gym but it is much brighter and quieter than the East Tower. The East Tower is a mere 5 minute stroll along the marina or a 2 minute bus ride. Seriously, people who say the walk is long must not get much exercise! There is also free WiFi access in the hotel lobby but you must have your own wireless-equipped laptop to use (otherwise, head to the web bar in the lobby of the East Tower) Gym - very small but was never crowded. Equipped with 1 elliptical machine, 2 treadmills, 2 exercise bikes, free weights, and mats. Water cooler provided, too. Breakfast buffet - trek on over to the East Tower for the buffet. It's well worth the $$!! Plenty of fresh fruits, cereal, hot foods, and a made-to-order omlette bar. Location - very convenient...a 10 minutes ($15 USD) cab ride away to Horton Plaza in the downtown core. Beautiful views of the downtown skyline and marina. Overall, I would return to the Sheraton. Excellent service, great quality, and not outrageously expensive prices.

<Title>“Hotel refused to give us a Non-Smoking Room! Priceline buyers beware!!”
<Content>After bidding on 4-star downtown San Diego Hotels on Priceline, our bid was accepted by the Sheraton on Harbor Island. I requested Non-Smoking rooms with King Size Beds, and called the hotel a week in advance of our arrival about this issue. Upon check-in, we were informed that Priceline rooms are strictly Smoking Rooms with two double beds! Our rooms were in the "Lanai" section, a three story older part of the hotel. We had a pool view, not a harbor view as we had hoped. Aside from the heavy smoke odor, the room was very nicely furnished. Beds were comfortable. We slept well, and were not awakened by airport noise (the airport is accross the street from this Hotel). The main Hotel Lobby is very nice, complete with a large aquarium, and free Internet access. The Concierge was helpful, and all of the staff we encountered were friendly and efficient. We would have preferred a Hotel located closer to the Downtown attractions, but Priceline includes Harbor Island in it's Downtown Hotels.

<Title>“If you are looking for quiet, don't look here”
<Content>I am a local San Diegan and had planned a birthday Saturday for my husband. We rented a sailboat out of the Harbor very near the Sheraton. The plan was to go to dinner after sailing and spend a nice evening at the Sheraton. A friend of mine had worked there for years when it was called the Sheraton Grande. I attended her wedding there years ago and it was lovely. Apparently they hotel forgot to upgrade. We only spent one night, but believe me that was enough. It was difficult to book only one night, Saturday night. So when I got a rate of $259.00, I took it. The hotel is an older style and must be at least 45 years old. The ceilings are not very high and the lobby is modest for a Sheraton. Approaching the front entrance, loud pop music was playing. Almost like the hotel was going for a Las Vegas feeling. Our room was modest and it appeared all the rooms had a nautical theme, which was fine. The room had a magnificint view of The San Diego Bay. The trouble started when we found our room and noticed we were located closed to the elevator. The hotel being so old, every time the elevator went up or down, we heard it. When the elevator stopped on our floor, a bell rung. That was't a problem until we wanted to get some sleep. We went to bed about 11:30 p.m. but did not sleep. Apparently there were three or four funtions at the hotel. From around 12:00 until 2:15 a.m. the functions ended and throngs of people got in the elevator and went back to their rooms. When they stopped on our floor, the bell would ding and drunk loud guests would proceed to exit the elevator and yell and sing right at our door. I woke up at least ten times. At 2:00 am, we almost packed our bags and went home, since we live locally. The Hotel is so old, you can hear when anyone in the area flushed their toilet. The toilet sounded like an airplane toilet, does the job great but you'll know the habits of everyone in rooms around you. If you can avoid the hotel do it. Even though the view is spectacular, you'll have to catch up on your sleep it you don't.

<Title>“Nice Business Travelers Hotel”
<Content>I stayed at this hotel in Mid-September for a conference. Arrived on a beautiful Saturday afternoon well before the 3PM check-in time and was able to get into my room immediately. I found the rooms in the West Building to be very nice and much nicer and larger than those of the East Building. The room & bathrooms were clean and well laid out. Although you have to walk a short distance to get to any conference events, the views of the city and bay more than make up for it. It is also much quieter in the West Building. I did notice that if you leave your sliding door open or ajar that it will effect the operation of the air conditioner. My wife and I thorougly enjoyed our stay.

<Title>“Overall A Good Value.”
<Content>We booked our room through Hotwire. When you do that they automatcally put you in the East Tower. While the East Tower seem larger we were told by a friendly reservation rep that the West Tower was newly remodeled and much nicer. Our room was fantastic. A nice size with a king bed and balcony. It had a couch and desk as well. we spent little time in the room but when we were there we always had the slider to the balcony open to expose the great Marina view from our window. We had a slight problem with the TV not wanting to stay on any channels for more than a few minutes, making watching a futile excersize. Housekeeping did forget to restock our coffee and towels one day but they quickly brought what we were missing. On checkout the frontdesk offered us a $25 discount on our stay for the TV situtation. We paid $150/night through hotwire and we felt like we got a deal. What really irritates me is how much hotels are charging you to park now. It was $22 a night with valet service or $18 without. Since there is no other parking available what choice do you have? Overall we enjoyed our stay and had a great time In San Diego!

<Title>“Better than I was prepared for . . . (in some ways)”
<Content>I have to say I was VERY nervous about staying here. I had been reading reviews for months. We were there for a conference so we had no choice in hotel location. I did request the East Tower, which is where everything is located. The other tower is a far walk away. We were given the tower we wanted and every employee was VERY nice whenwe were making these reservations. Upon arriving we were greeted very professionally and pleasantly. They take your bags to your room, you have no say in this. We were there four nights for the conference and the only complaints I can come up with are the food prices are outrageous for breakfast. If you are preparred to spend $20 for three little kids to have a bagel and share a juice, then no worries. Room service for kids for dinner is EXCELLENT. They have $5 - $6 choices ranging from burgers, quesadillas to chicken nuggets. It was great. The pool and landscaping is so beautiful. You will enjoy your surroundings. My only other complaint is the odd behavior of some staff. MANY times we had knockings on our door, only to have an employee quickly open our door (before time even allowed us to get to the door) and they would pop their head in to see if anyone was there. (Not good if you're in the shower) Always with a weird excuse too. One person was holding bottled water, seeing if we needed replenished. (at $4 a bottle, no thanks) And doesn't housekeeping note these things when they come through???? Another employee came in with a clipboard. When I asked what he wanted, he stated "never mind" and left. Another woman entered with two towels draped over her arm. (Again, doesn't housekeeping do this?) We were beginning to put it together that they knew there was a hotel full of conference attending folks who wouldn't be in their rooms and the employyees were going around swiping things. It's not the most positive conclusion, but it's the only one we came to. Over all, the hotel is beautiful, the pool clean and the empoyees we dealt with were friendly and helpful. Food pricey and a few weird experiences. Just be careful . . . . . Hope this helps a little.

<Content>My wife attemded a conference here so I tagged along for the two night stay. Once you accept the fact that this is a corporate hotel and that it's close to the airport for a reason you can enjoy it for what it is. It has three nice pools, good restaurants, a beautiful view of the harbor, a nice walkway between the two towers, clean and comfortable rooms, plenty of outdoor seating, good service and it's close to downtown. What's not to like?

<Title>“Pretty Good!”
<Content>My partner and I stayed at the Sheraton during the middle of the week while a major conference was going on at the hotel. Our room was on the tenth floor of the East Wing looking over the Marina towards downtown. Pluses: 1) Spectacular view of the San Diego skyline and wonderful location along the marina! 2) Very comfortable beds. 3) The lobby is very nicely designed with a feature called Yahoo Link. PC workstations are clustered in groups around comfortable chairs and tables. High speed broadband service is free along with wireless access if you bring your laptop. Yahoo Link adjoins the Aroma Cafe where snacks and beverages are available. The idea is to create a place to "meet and greet" and hangout. 4) The fitness center is equipped with all new Lifecycle treadmills, bicycles, etc. The facility is spotless and well air conditioned. 5) The lagoon style meandering pool is very nice and in certain places very compatible with lap swimming. Minuses: 1) Room decor in the East Wing needs to be updated. Furniture isn't bad, but the table and floor lamps look like something out of the Victorian past. Previous reviews refer to a nautical theme in the West Wing--hardly the case here. 2) High speed access is $11.95 in the guest rooms--it's still a mystery why upper scale hotels charge for internet access and value hotels don't. 3) Parking is expensive everywhere and no less so at the Sheraton. Overall, I would definitely stay again!

<Title>“The beds were comfortable... and the view was nice”
<Content>Well the subject about sums up the good points of staying at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. First for people who have never stayed there, the hotel is broken up into 2 buildings an East and West side located about 200 yards apart from one another. If you're staying in the west wing, most of the hotel amenities are located in the east wing. If you're staying in the east wing, well there is more airport noise to deal with. But either way they absolutely nickle and dime you for everything. You're afraid to even get comfortable in your room due to over inflated hidden charges. And I'm not sure if anyone else experienced this but every 5 minutes our TV would switch back to the premium channel guide to purchase pay per view movies. The water in the room was $4.00 per bottle (if you drank it) $2.00 sodas, 19% add on plus $3.00 for every room service call, internet $13 dollars a day, parking (self parking) $16.00 a day and the onsite "Bistro" was ridiculously way over priced. The staff was cold, corporate and unhelpful (except for the bell boys... they were pleasant). We'll never come back to Sheraton/Starwood brand hotel again after this experience. We paid way to much money for this room to realize once we're checked in that there is a surcharge on breathing their air. Not really, but why not... they may as well charge for that too.

<Title>“Loved the Sheraton San Diego (Harbor View)”
<Content>Only spent one night in San Diego and was glad to have chosen such a wonderful place. The view from our West Wing hotel room was spectacular! We had a beatiful view of the Coranado Bridge and downtown San Diego. The large king size bed room was recently redecorated in nautical colors. The location was central to just about every point in the city. Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who is a first timer to San Diego. The bonus is that its just off North Harbor Drive and the airport.

<Title>“Not worth the money, even if you get a bargain”
<Content>We got a great deal on the hotel for labor day weekend and the best part about the experience was the view. We got an awesome view of the marina and the lanai pool. However, only 1 elevator out of 2 was working the whole weekend and we either had to take the service elevator or walk all the way down the hall if we wanted to go up to the 5th floor. Otherwise, the wait was like 10 mins. Totally ridiculous. The internet is NOT part of your stay which is so cheesy because the Days In gives it to you for free. We argued with them because when you log in it appears you don't have to pay by entering your hotel room number but we got billed $12 a day for the internet and we only logged in for total of 3 hours over 3 days. Finally, the valet guys were all really nice but the parking was sooooo expensive. $16 a day and we did self parking and husband would drop off/pick up in front of the hotel and the valet guys were really nice about it. We didn't know there was a fee for parking and you are not close enough to park anywhere else so totally not worth staying at this hotel. You can do so much better for the price. The bedding was comfortable and they have nice goose down pillows and comforters but that was it. Shop around..don't come here if you don't have to.

<Content>We just came back from our 4day trip to S.D. Our stay at the Sheraton was good. I checked in early to get a good view, but since we requested two adjoining rooms they could'nt accomodate us with a better view unless we separated (understandable). We stayed at the east tower. All the restaurants and the main pool are at the east tower, just nice. The pool side food is typical of hotel food pricey and not that great. The hotel has updated its look in some areas and some are desperatly asking for help like the arcade. My sister stayed in the west tower. Rooms are renovated and seem larger. If your not traveling with family, stay there its more quiet. Overall we enjoyed our stay, Im not a big winer.

<Title>“Very Nice”
<Content>Stayed at the Sheraton on our last leg down the coast for 3 nights. Had a deluxe room on the 9th floor with a great view. Room was large and comfortable, especially the beds. Bathroom was o.k.; clean, but could have been cleaner (tub). Air conditioning wasn't as cool as we would have liked it. We were able to regulate it ourselves, but it didn't feel that much cooler; but it was very quiet. We were in the West Tower, but ALL the action is in the East Tower. It is a pleasant 3 minute walk along the Marina. But after a few drinks, we had to walk ALL the way back. They have one restaurant in the West Tower. Had breakfast there one morning; it was our last. Poor service; ridiculous prices -- $4.50 for a glass of orange juice. We enjoyed the East Tower, especially Quinns (sports bar); good atmosphere. If we stay here again, we will request the East Tower (less walking). Found the desk staff at the West Tower friendly; helpful. Overall, this hotel is o.k. We would stay here again. It does sit next to the airport, but you truly are not disturbed by the air noise. In fact, between the hours of 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., the air traffic stops. We liked the location, and it really does have wonderful views.

<Title>“Nicer than expected”
<Content>My partner, son and I recently stayed at this Sheraton. As I fly often out of San Diego Airport, I often had seen this hotel which is located just across the street from the airport. From that distance, to be honest, it looks like a big 1960-ish (not too attractive) building. So, I must say that I had low expectations of the hotel when I decided to stay there. I thought it would just be a cold airport hotel where people would stay only for the convenience of the airport - not as a destination hotel. I am happy to write, however, that the hotel is much, much nicer when you are in it than how it had seemed from a distance! The service was very good (the valet parkers, the registration, bell-hops) and the views from the windows on the seventh floor were really beautiful. From one side you see the skyline of San Diego and from the other side you see the boats in the harbor/marina. The food there was also very good. My only complaint was that the overnight parking fee is quite high. We didn't hear any airplane noise, even though we were just minutes away from the airport. We just had the basic room, so that's what we got. It seemed like it had recently been renovated and was very clean and nice. The square footage seemed a little sparse (the room was kind of narrow shaped). Had a nice little balcony from which we could see the boats too! All in all, a fine place for a night or two.

<Title>“Had a great time at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina”
<Content>My family and I just returned from our San Diego vacation where we stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina. After reading some of the previous reviews, I had mixed feelings going into this trip. However, once I arrived at the hotel, all my concerns quickly disappeared and our stay was completely enjoyable. We stayed in the West Tower and even with 2 children (we had a king room with a rollaway and a crib) were were comfortable and had ample room. Our room faced the bay which was the best free entertainment. My 2 year old had a blast letting us know anytime a helicopter or airplane took off from North Island or a large ship was passing by. We could also see the Coronado Bridge, downtown San Diego and Point Loma from our balcony. We were also treated to fireworks being setoff near the bridge a couple of nights. The hotel has 3 lovely pools, a small one at the West Tower (with bar/food service), the larger "main" pool and another small pool at the East Tower. The "main" pool has poolside dining with waitstaff service. The food was good although typicaly priced for hotel food. It arrived quick, hot and with a smile from the server who checked on us frequently to make sure things were good. They also accomodated substitutions for the ingredients (ie: chicken for shrimp on the salad). They also allow (and sell) pool toys which was great for my kids. The walk from the West Tower to the East Tower was pleasant, with beautiful views of the harbor. There's a great little deli (Papanani's) along the way which was open for breakfast, lunch and dinner until 8pm. They serve the best tasting ice cream! Also, another poster stated there wasn't a game room/arcade as advertised but there is one, tucked away off the "main" pool, near the spa entrance. The one downfall I found at this property was the $16 to self-park your car (you really need one, the hotel's not downtown or walking distance to public transportation) in the parking lot directly in front of the hotel. But. there are no other parking options available so as a hotel guest, you are stuck with the fee. Overall, this hotel was comfortable, roomy and very accomodating to my family and we would definitely stay here in the future.

<Title>“Great view!”
<Content>We recently decided to splurge on a nice hotel in San Diego to celebrate our 25 anniversary. We were very pleased with the "Stay 5 nights, get a night free" with a guaranteed view room at the San Diego Sheraton's West Tower. We stayed in a beautifully refurbished room overlooking the San Diego harbor and skyline. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. It was pricey, but worth it!

<Title>“Great Location (surrounded by water)”
<Content>Had a wonderful time at the Sheraton Hotel in San Diego (near the airport--Harbor Island). You can actually see the hotel from the airport but the flight patterns at the airport keep the noise away from the hotel. The hotel is not new but is in reasonably good shape. We had a room looking out over the yacht harbor and the harbor and it was just beautiful. We upgraded to the Club Level and this gave us a very nice breakfast at the Penthouse level and a 5pm reception (free food but you had to pay for drinks--pretty chintzy). Easy to get downtown via cab to the gaslamp section so really can do without a rental car unless you want to go sightseeing outside of San Diego. The location of this hotel was the best part. We enjoyed the view and the ability to walk along the harbor and enjoy the views.

<Title>“The WORST for the money!”
<Content>Our experience at the Sheraton was terrible. We had upgraded to a "deluxe" room when we made our reservations. Our family of four was put into a cracker box size room ( told "all rooms are the same size") with a Motel 6 bathroom, no, sorry Motel 6.... worse.. ( cracked toilet, mold in the grout line of the bathtub and not just a little! A sink that when you turned it on the faucet would break off and again, small, small) The AC was not working, the fan made a terrible noise. They nickle and dime for EVERYTHING...local calls $2.00 a minute, internet usage fees, parking $16.00. They even wanted to charge $25.00 to put a frig in our room) At $200 a night...are they serious? What made it all worse was the insincere smiles from the maniquins at the front desk who could have cared LESS about our experience. Needless to say after one night ( booked for four) we checked out. Found a LOVELY Best Western. The Island Palms and for the same rate checked into a beautiful marina side queen suite, full kitchen, huge bathroom, seperate bedroom. No fees for parking, free wireless, beautiful grounds and pool. AHHHHH now we could enjoy our vacation and we did. Sheraton? Just say NO!

<Title>“Nice hotel, friendly staff!”
<Content>We stayed here July 1 and 2, 2006 and had a great stay. We spoke to quite a few employees asking questions about renting bikes, restaurants, etc and everyone was very friendly and helpful. We even got lost downtown looking for a restaurant and I called the hotel for help ... the girl gave me directions and was really friendly. We stayed in the West Tower, and I guess the rooms have been recently renovated (see pix). I thought the rooms were really large and you can see the ocean from bed (we had a bay view). The bathroom needed a bit of updating but the room itself was quite nice. We ate at the Harbor's Edge which is in the East Tower and had a lovely lunch - service and food were good. The calamari was so yummy and tender! We spent our pool time at the West Tower pool though ... the East Tower pool was too crowded with too many kids for my taste. The West pool is more low-key although it also has a bar/food service counter. We would definitely stay here again.

<Content>We were ending our family trip in California here but quickly discovered that this was another corporate hotel designed for the business traveller. Lots of extras that you had to pay for inc car parking at $16 a night. Not within walking distance of down town but ideal for airport. Not ideal for families with small children but great pool

<Title>“Harbor is beautiful”
<Content>I will simply list the pros and cons i observed from my stay at this property. overall it was very nice and my kids and i enjoyed our stay. i stayed in the west tower that has been recently renovated. pros: beautiful harbor-try to get a room with a view nice lobby free wireless internet in the lobby nice spacious rooms with upgraded new linens higher end toiletries(shampoo/conditioner) nice balcony in every room good central air conditioning with modern and effective temperature control adequate gift shop in west tower, good for forgotten items in room coffee with liquid creamer not powder (yes its the little things) modest pool that is pretty private (most ppl go to the nicer pool at the east tower) and overlooks the harbor nice poolside bar at the east tower parking is very close to the hotel at the west tower close to downtown cons: front desk check in staff was cold and snippy about what room i could get. i asked for the east tower. i was told in no uncertain terms that i would get what i got. well not that bad, but close. otherwise, the staff was very nice PARKING is too expensive! 16/day for self parking. ridiculous airport noise was very distracting the first day and morning. you get a prompt wake up at 6:30 am. you are literally next door to the airport. we got used to it eventually. room service and dining there is extremely expensive-the food was pretty good though most ammenities are in the east tower, so you have to walk over there..about 1/4 mi if you want to enjoy them. there is no game room/arcade as advertised (disappointed teenager)

<Content>We also booked our reservation through Priceline and felt it was a good deal. The East Tower has a lot of energy. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We could see part of the airport from our balcony but were not ever bothered by the noise, even with the patio door open. Excellent views of the harbor. No need to rent a car if you're comfortable with taxis - quick trip to the Gaslight Quarter. Nice pool.

<Title>“Great Service”
<Content>Just stayed at the Sheraton Marina April 18-April 20. Got the room thru priceline and must agree that at $110, it was worth it. Read thru the preceeding threads and decided to book a room at the West Tower. The rooms are brand new and very, very large. We requested a high room and we overlooked the back of the hotel towards the marina. It was very comfortable. Service was excellent. Checked out the east tower and felt there was alot more activity going on. If you want calmness book the West Tower. It is however about a 1/4 mile between the two towers. We walked there for the pool during the day, but my son went down to the jacuzzi at the West Tower at night. The breakfast buffet at $18.95 was not worth it. Also it is $16 for self-park with in and out privileges. Close to the airport and downtown, but nothing else within walking distance. I loved the views from the room and would definitely return for a short visit.

<Title>“Not bad at all, but make sure you book through Priceline”
<Content>I don't know what the going rate per night is for this hotel, but I'd imagine it's close to $200/night. However, it can be had for approximately $90/night through Priceline. My wife and I got a room at that rate and just spent 5 nights at the Sheraton last week. Overall, I don't really have too much to complain about. The rooms were quite small, but definitely sufficient for 2 people on vacation. You are very very close to the airport and can hear planes taking off on a regular basis during the day, but you get used to it pretty quickly. Overall, the hotel is somewhat noisy. Our air condition made a racket at night and the walls are somewhat thin. Parking is a total rip off--$16/night for "self parking". But if you get a deal on the room it's easier to justify this. You really do need to rent a car as it doesn't seem like there are many public transit options in San Diego, so the parking can't be avoided (there's nowhere else nearby to park). The pool at the hotel is quite nice and very large, and the location of the hotel on the marina is nice as well, and you're just 5-10 minutes from downtown. Also, the lobby is impressive and they have computers set up where you can get online for 30 minutes if you are a guest. Concierge was very very very helpful and the staff are all quite nice. In my opinion, this hotel is a bargain at $90/night. At the full rate, not so much.

<Content>For the $90 priceline rate we got on this hotel, it worked for us. We got a great room with wonderful view of the bay, downtown skyline and Coronado Bridge. Concierge was great with directions and staff was very friendly. I would have been disappointed had we paid full price, but for what we paid, I was more than satisfied.

<Title>“Not a Vacation Hotel”
<Content>Stayed in the West Tower for four nights. The elevator and hallways STUNK. On two separate occasions, people in the elevator commented to us how bad it smelled in the hotel. The room was very small. The first night, my husband was convinced there were bed bugs as he was up most of the night after feeling like he'd been bit and finding small, black objects in the sheets. Had the sheets changed out the next day and did not have any further issues. Hotel is definitely convenient to the airport. It is acceptable for business travel of one night or maybe two, but don't stay here if you like spacious rooms or you're looking for a vacation experience.

<Title>“Not bad, if you get it at a discounted rate.”
<Content>The lobby was nice, when I first walked in. The registration desk people were very friendly at check-in. I ended up in the East Building in the North Wing. The room wasn't anything spectacular, just a regular room. The worst thing that I experienced there was that, despite the scalding hot bath water, when I changed it to shower it was adequately warm, although I had it all the way hot. Self-parking is $16/day and valet is $22/day. They figure they can get you there, since the hotel isn't really close to downtown. I thought that having free internet access, for hotel guests, in lobby was great. The buffet was pretty good at $18. Not like we had any choice because the average dish was $14 (for french toast, pancakes, omelettes, etc.) What would you choose, considering you could get all-you-can-eat for about $4 more? A no-brainer there.

<Content>Stayed here for 4 days for business during the first week of March. I stayed in the east tower and the room was clean, well-maintained, and recently remodeled. I did not experience any of the airport noise. The hotel staff was extremely polite and professional at all of our company functions. Room rate was $199 which is high - but not for this part of San Diego. It would have been nice if there was a beach, but this is a "marina" hotel.

<Title>“loved the location”
<Content>My daughter and I just returned from a six night stay at the Sheraton. The hotel has just finished a complete renovation and is immaculate. We are very fussy travelers, pride ourselves in staying at nice places and were very happy with the Sheraton. The rooms are done in a nautical theme, very clean and a great view of the harbor. We were on the sixth floor, away from the elevator but close to the ice machine which turned out to not be an issue. The people were quite pleasant, the food was great but quite expensive. Service was a bit slow. We stayed in the West Tower, much quieter than the East Tower. Only a 2 minute walk along the marina between hotels. We'd definately stay there again, the closeness to the airport we found to be a help.

<Content>Stayed here for a conference having paid $250.00 a night - definitely not worth it. Rooms in Main tower had grotty dirty carpets and curtains. Finally moved to west tower where the rooms were new so much better but plumbing was being renovated - so inconsistent hot water and broken taps and loo plumbing. Plumbers and random people constantly walked in during the day to fix these. Overall if we had paid $99.00 a night - great but the price we paid we expected a lot more. Service did not make up for the hotel condition either - would def not stay there again.

Requested for a high floor, 2 double beds, and facing the marina, and got it! 2) Very plush, clean, comfortable beds with 4 pillows (on each double bed) 3) Great views from the balcony 4) 5 free internet access/computers in the lobby: very nice modern setup with flat screen Sony monitors, free printing; also a lounge area with flat screen TV. 5) Large swimming pool, usually almost empty each day we swam; nice adjacent hot tub. 6) Convenience store at the lobby was great and essential 7) Laundry facilities!! very nice surprise; washer and dryers definitely helped during the trip 8) Lobby was nicely decorated with grand christmas tree + aquarium 9) For a hotel located right next to the airport, we didn't hear any planes at all! (except for loud next door neighbors) 10) Never pay anything above $99 for this hotel. It is priced right at $99/night. Neutral: 1) Had the christmas buffet dinner, and it was definitely bland. Alcoholic drinks were weak. Should have gone to a restaurant in the Gaslamp District for much less than the $122 we were charged at the hotel. Cons: 1) Gym/health spa was closed & under renovation. Website was not updated until my day of arrival, so I could not fully complain. 2) Parking is a mess at times; no free spots, so you circle around and around and wait and wait 3) Thin walls- loud people in the rooms next door can bother you 4) Small bathrooms 5) No wireless internet; pay for ethernet access

<Title>“good view, but...”
<Content>Stayed in the west wing just before new years. A definite mixed bag. First, keep in mind that this property is really 2 different hotels about a quarter mile apart. The east wing is the larger hotel and the closest to the airport, and also the one with the most amenities. Very much a large convention property. The west wing (which the bellboy said used to be a Westin) is undergoing extensive renovation, or was when we were there. This was a problem for just about everybody -- guests, workers and hotel staff. At one point only one elevator was working, and much of the property was off-limits. To their credit, the hotel staff seemed to keep a positive and sympathetic attitude. Some guests seemed pretty put out. We actually didn't have a problem and since we were paying a discounted priceline rate, some of the irritants were easy to overlook. In fact, once the renovations are complete, this may be a better spot than the larger east wing. We loved our room with a great view of the bay and downtown San Diego. Cruise ships, yachts, fishing boats, kayakers...they all swept right by our balcony. Lots of joggers and walkers on the path by the bay too. The room was freshly remodeled... brand new, really...but not especially luxurious. Odd things were missing too -- like a lamp by the seating area (you couldn't read there at night) and the only mirror was in the bathroom. Pretty slim for a 4-star property. More like a 3-star. Anyway, the Sheraton west wing has a good location, and at this point that's about the best thing going for it. Get a room from a discounter and enjoy the view.

I spent the week sharing the evevators with hotel staff and hoping it would stop on my floor. I was very disappointed with my stay. The West tower also only has 1 restaurant. I would definately not recommend the hotel here in the near future and avoid a room by the elevator at all costs as you will be stuck listening to them day and night.

<Content>I recently completed a stay at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel And Marina. This hotel is current undergoing extensive renovations. During our stay, there was loud pounding and jack hammering from 8:45 AM to 6 PM on a Friday and Saturday. The hallways also smelled like carpet glue and the elevators were used for construction. This construction is very disrupting to a guest expecting a relaxing weekend at a four star hotel. The hotel does not disclose the construction on their website and only informs guests about the renovations at check-in. I would not stay at this hotel again, while it is under construction.

I stayed in the tower side with a view of the city. Every room has a balcony, which you can’t beat! The Room was spacious and the bedding was so comfortable. I enjoyed by post conference breaks on the terrace watching the people come and go. It was about a $13-15 cab ride to the gas lamp district. The bathroom was average, but I must mention the fabulous hair dryer! Top notch Con-air. The lobby was great and has free wireless internet. Very comfy couches and a great bar Quinns. It is a great place to do business. Being near the airport was not a problem. All and all a great trip and a better stay.

<Title>“Nice room - your typical, generic hotel”
<Content>My company was hosting a conference in both Sheraton hotels. Upon checking in, they had my reservations wrong so my suite was not available. They placed me on the 8th floor with a view of the marina, and enjoyed it so much that I decided not to change. Absolutely loved the view, and being able to keep the patio door open 24/7 enjoying the perfect weather. As far as the conference goes - the hotel messed up continously, so I would not recommend hosting one there. Otherwise it was your typical Sheraton with overpriced food, and a few glitches here and there (like the parking) but for quick travlers who want to be near the airport, it's fine. There was a new, swanky Marriott and Hyatt just a few miles away, in downtown S.D., but I'm sure their prices would be beyond what my company deems appropriate.

<Title>“Nice stay for $200 a night”
<Content>We made reservations for the club level which included parking and breakfast. My husband travels alot and is a gold almost platnuim starwood member. They were remolding the club floor so the upgraded us to a two room suite with two full baths and three tvs. They gave us breakfast buffet at the resteraunt which was excelent with waffles and omlets made to order. That alone would be $30 a person plus $ 14 for parking. Almost everywhere in San Diego you pay to park. I was suprised we did not have internet service which is usually on club floors. After speeking with the manager they let us use the business center for free. I would recomend booking a club room cheeper then all the extras all acart. We stayed 5 nights with close acess to zoo, sea world, downtown events. We did not have any problem with plane noise, my son 8 liked to see the big ships comming and going everyday and the pool was fine to relax after outings.

<Title>“Pleasantly Surprised – Awesome Stay!!”
<Content>After reading all the reviews we were very hesitant about staying at this hotel. We had tried Priceline for the first time ever and for $111 we got this room. We usually stay at Lowe’s Coronado retreat, but now that we have a baby, we are trying to save some money. We loved our stay here. The room was super clean and had an awesome view of the harbor. We slept with the balcony door open. Our room was on the seventh floor of the West Tower. It was a nice room (bathroom a little small- but who cares with the view we were given- we didn’t come to bath). The West Tower we are told is not as nice as the East Tower, but we had a great time. We had dinner at the East Tower. Our son was hypnotized by the huge beautiful fish tank in the lobby of the East Tower. The staff was super friendly and helpful. We found the bellman to be the most informative. We just found the whole experience to be a surprise, we expected bad and we got great. We never heard planes, we didn’t have a bad room, we just had a great experience!

<Title>“Great view and it stops there”
<Content>I attended a conference and just got back yesterday. The location is great from a view perspective, right on the marina. Oh but wait, are you afraid of airplanes. If you are do not stay here. You can watch planes take off every 90 seconds; that's the statistics they quote. Oh they are wonderful pilots since there is only one run way. If you like being situated at an airport this is the place for you. I generally stay at a Marriott so I was disappointed in this older hotel. The room was so so. The service was friendly and generally accommodating but I called to get a wake up call twice and neither one of them were received. This could be a real problem if I didn't wake up on my own. The pool was small compared to the Marriotts I stayed at and there were maybe two umbrellas at the entire pool. Major problem if you burn easy as I do, so I couldn't stay near the pool. $22 for hotel valet parking -that's a day. $16 if you park it yourself. Oh did I mention the $20 a day to connect to the internet, I think it should be included on a business convention trip. Its that petty overpricing that bothers me. The room rate was reasonable, they get you on the extras. The bed was okay but I found the rooms really hot and very very noisy. I could hear the toilets in the next room flush. I have a coworker who had a leak in her room which wasn't fixed all week. Her carpet was wet. Stay someplace else unless you really want a great marina view.

<Title>“Very Nice but Very Noisy”
<Content>This was a very nice hotel. Our room did not overlook the ocean but instead the airport. Airplanes take off from 6:00 AM until 11:00 PM. They are very close and very noisy. Pools were very nice and the conference areas were nice as well. The rooms were good and the beds were very comfortable. Charges for everything from fitness room to delivery of room service (thought that is what room service is for). Stay was not great but very nice.

<Title>“Better than we expected”
<Content>After reading the reviews for this hotel in the weeks leading up to our vacation in late August, I was terrified about what we would encounter. However, since my expectations were so low, due to the other reviews, we were pleasantly surprised. Our check in was very easy with an attentive valet and pleasant front desk staff and the Bellman, Andy was very friendly and quick! (our bags were in our room within minutes of our check-in and even then he was apologetic about the "delay") Self-parking fees are steep, but we never had any trouble finding a space close to our room and our Key Card actually worked, for the whole six days. We were given a room in the East Tower, right over the pool, which could be noisy if the window was open, but it was great for our daughter to be so close to the pool. We only ate in the bar, for dinner, which wasn't any more expensive than any other hotel food. Our room was clean and we had no complaints about the service or our stay. As we had booked our trip through Expedia, we had a nice stay for the price we paid for high season in San Diego. The only complaint we had was that there were very few restaurants close by. It would be tough if you were staying for a conference and didn't have a car. All in all, it was a nice stay at a nice property.

<Title>“Hey - It's a Sheraton! By the Airport! It's Nice!”
<Content>Stayed at the Sheraton Towers Marina for two nights - August 19 and 20. Make no mistake, this can be a very busy place. Especially in August as folks make one last getaway before the start of school, etc. We reserved a nice "cozy" room on the Club Level that had a fantastic view of the harbor and downtown from the 11th floor. Staying on this level also gave you free self parking and a very nice continental breakfast each morning. Worth considering if you compare to their other room rates where these two items could run you an extra $30 to $40 per day. Rooms were very quiet considering you are less than a half mile from the airport. The location is great - you are really only a 10 minute drive from Old Town, Downtown, Sea World, Balboa Park, and other locations. Two lowlights - check-in on a Friday evening (about 6pm) with only one clerk at the desk. It took forever - what were they thinking about staffing on one of their busiest nights of the summer! The other issue was the A/C in the room - it only runs on AUTO mode, so it can be a real sleep stealer if you are a light sleeper. The staff was all very nice and the grounds are certainly pretty. We enjoyed our stay.

<Title>“Met expectations”
<Content>Stayed here over an August weekend and I would confirm most of what has been said in previous reviews. Booked room through discount website for $105/night, which is very cheap for a San Diego weekend stay in the busy season. Assigned a large room facing marina in West tower on lower level. I would recommend this hotel assuming you are not paying rack rate ($229/night), because there are much nicer truly 4* hotels available downtown at that price. Pros: -View of marina -Clean room, no service problems or complaints -Close drive to downtown, beaches, Coronado, zoo, etc. Cons: -If you don't have a car the hotel is not within walking distance of downtown, beaches, or anything else. -Definitely not a 4*--furnishings and hallways are a little worn and dated, especially in west Tower. -Lanai rooms looked dark and motel-like.

<Title>“Good Value for Tourists”
<Content>We stayed the west tower, which after reading other reviews looks like we lucked out! Although the east tower (the main building in all the photos) has the nicer pool, the west tower was bright, clean and quiet (and has a fine pool and hot tub). Check-in was easy and we were given a very nice, clean (over-sized) king room with a couch and balcony overlooking the bay. We are starwood preferred guests, so we may have received an upgrade and didn't know it. The Sheraton Sweet sleeper beds are heavenly and sooo comofortable. The bathroom was nice, a little small, but still fine. The room did not have an alarm clock...which was weird, but the wake up calls were fine. We did not hear any commerical planes from the airport (which is very close)...by the pool you can hear the navy planes from across the bay. I ate breakfast one day in the restaurant, $18 for a waffle & OJ - so we went to a denny's on pacific highway (very close) for the rest of the week. This was a great location with very easy acces in minutes (literally like 5) to downtown, balboa park and highway 5 if you have a car. They charge $16 for parking a day -- and the gate didn't work right the entire time we were there. (Its $22 a day for valet) I got two days removed by pushing their service guarnatee back on them...and they easily agreed. The bell staff was nice, although we prefer to just wheel our own bags. The elevators at the parking lot end of the hotel need some paint, but it looked like they were in the process of fixing them. We ended up here on a deal from a travel site - and we would stay here again, but we would definitely request the west tower!

<Title>“We Loved It!”
<Content>I was very impressed with the hotel. We were there on our honeymoon Aug 15th-20th and had a great stay. Maybe this is because I asked for a nice room at check in? We were in Lania room 5320 of the east tower with a lovely view of the pool and harbor. The spa staff is rude so I didn't book with them, but there is a spa on every corner in San Diego. I recommend Elaine at the Meridian for hair and make-up. I would give the hotel 3-3 1/2 stars. We wanted a clean and safe place to stay and this fit the bill. The key card readers on the self parking gates do not work. This is not a big deal as all you have to do is take a ticket and tell the gaurd your room number when you leave. We had an excellent time with parking. We got a spot directly in front of the elevator to our room the entire stay. The hotel also has a fabulous location. Request the east tower with a pool view and you'll be happy here. :) I only wish my camera had picked up the view in the background.

<Content>I stayed at this hotel over the 4th of July as was moderately satisfied until about 3am on the first night when I was overwhelmed by a strong methane smell, the hotel said it looked into the problem but the smell got progressivly worse as our stay went on. The hotel expressed concern but did little, if anything, to fix the problem. There are many nice hotels in San Diego and I would strongly recomend avoiding this one.

<Title>“This is a convention hotel”
<Content>I recently stayed @ this hotel for a business meeting, August 1-4. I would not recomned this hotel to anyone on vacation. There were at least 2 other conventions going on while I was there. The line to get on the elevators @ 5 PM was insane. Most people opted for the stairs. Since I was there for business I did not get to use the pool, gym, or any of the restaurants. **People who need "white noise" to sleep take my advice! Bring your own sound maker or something. I so regretted not brining something since I had read on here that the AC in the rooms will NOT stay on- even in the "fan" mode. I was constantly waking up when the LOUD AC came on and off. Pros for this hotel: 1. Great view of the marina & boats 2. VERY close to the AP (w/ minimal noise) 3. Rooms appear to be updated although not extremely clean 4. Nice bed 5. 10 minute/$10 cab ride to down town Cons: 1. This is a convention hotel so there are swarms of people everywhere 2. There are 2 "towers." You may find yourself walking back and forth a lot 3. Not sure what other San Diego attractions are that close? I hope this review was helpful.

<Title>“Great Location”
<Content>We recently stayed here from 7/27-7/30. The room is adequate, but small. If your troom overlooks the marina and pool as ours did, you have a beautiful view. The pool is very nice. There is a reasonably priced restaurant adjacent to the pool, Waterworks. It closes by 4;30/5:00. It would be nice if it stayed open later so that families could enjoy it for dinner as the restaurant in tne hotel is pricey for kids and the pub appeared loud and not kid friendly. The hotel is in a good location...near the airport (you don't hear the planes in your room and they are not offensive if you're outside) and close to downtown...we were probably 10 min from Petco Park, 20 from the zoo and 10 from old town. My only complaint is that they charge $16 to park your car...you are their hostage as there is no where else to park. This was unacceptable to us and after complaining they removed three days of parking. Also they failed to deliver extra pillows and blankets and we received a $50 credit.

<Title>“Sheraton not a 4 star hotel”
<Content>I stayed at the Sheraton Hotel and marins in San Diego. I paid for the club level rooms which included free breakfast in the executive room and free parking. The room faced the marina and bay. Room is small and lacked finer comforts. A basic room, not worthy of a 4 star rating. Small closet and one dresser. Below the room are the loading dock for hotel and parking lot. I was on the 11th floor and every morning, we heard trucks loading and unloading supplies. They were errecting a tent and we heard every hammer and truck. Airport noise is almost non-existent but truck and motorcycle noise was constant. If you are seeking a view in this hotel, ask for side side facing downtown. More scenic and quiet. Parking is a nightmare. Key cards did not work for self parking. I attempted to enter lot late at night and key card did not open the gate. Several cars behind me caused a mini traffic jam while I had to reverse. Found a attendent to assist me. The lot is huge and very dark. Not safe for a woman alone to park a car alone. Paths to the hotel are not marked and we stumbled through bushes and a unexpected 5 foot drop trying to find a side walk. Valet parking, a $8.00 additional charge is almost a necessity. WE complained about parking at desk but clerk did not seemed concerned. No method to test key card until you try to park. To late! Internet is available for $13.25 per 24 hours. Wireless service not available. Outside eating opportunities are very limited. The pool in east tower is very nice and quiet. Overall, service is very good and employees will assist patrons. This is a convention hotel, not designed for families and tourists. The west tower would offer a better view of the bay. Not a four star hotel. Club level rooms not worth the extra money.

<Title>“Very Poor Value. Definitely not a repeat.”
<Content>Unfortunately we booked through Expedia and was originally booked at the Hampton Inn. Somehow we got bumped(!) from the Hampton and moved to the Sheraton. Actually we were happy about it because we thought it was a four star hotel and that we had been upgraded. Ha! For the money this was the worst place we have ever stayed. Room was average size with a very small bathroom (I think they reserve these rooms for Expedia, etc., it was very worn with stains eveywhere including the hallway. First floor with no view at all. $4.00 bottled water, and no refigerator. The breakfast buffet was $20.00 and parking $16.00 a day. We parked in the handicapped parking where there is no charge but the staff charged us anyway assuming that we parked in regular parking though it never registered through our card which you use to access the regular parking lot. By the way, a cheeseburger costs $13.00! We highly recommend travelers to San Diego (a beautiful city with tons to do) choose another facility. I checked with Consumer's Report when we got back to Dallas and sure enough all Sheretons are rated very low as far as value goes and the number of problems encountered.

<Title>“Beware the Lanai Rooms!”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton from July 2nd to July 8th. And understanding that it was a vacation week, expected to have a lot of folks there. We had requested bayside rooms (2 couples) for the fireworks and view. We were told that since we had requested king rooms, we could not have adjoining rooms, but we would be next to each other....good thing, since we're in the same rental car. When we arrived, we were put into the "Lanai Rooms" which seem to be from a much older hotel. The floors and, of course, ceilings are concrete and reflect every step taken on them. We were on the second floor and heard every step that anyone made above us. And the third floor was rented out to stompers. There were small children running rampant through out the hallways.....one ran into me and his parent acted like I was the one at fault. I guess the comment from an adult male, "small child at large" should have been a warning when the child was 30 feet behind and around a corner? The staff at the desk was rude. When we asked about the request for bayside rooms, we were told, "Well, you did book through expedia?" We will not stay at this hotel ever again.

<Content>I just had an event at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel and Marina and it was absolutely wonderful! The food, the service, and the staff was exemplary. From the time I stepped off their airport shuttle service and entered the front door to the time I exited the door and returned to the airport they were highly attentive, responsive, and helpful. The shuttle driver even helped me carry all of my recently purchased items into the airport ticket line. I would definitely return to this hotel whether for an event or an individual leisure trip.

<Title>“Enjoyed this hotel”
<Content>I just returned from a stay at this hotel and we enjoyed our time there. We were in the East Tower on the 10th Floor with a city view. We have stayed at this hotel before and always try to request a city view room and view of the airport. This may sound strange to some people, but we actually consider it a plus that the hotel is right across the street from the airport, as we enjoy watching the planes land and take off and noise does not bother us. The lobby is nice, with a nautical motif and large fish tank. The one thing I found "funny" is that our room decor did not seem to complement the nautical theme of the lobby. I almost felt like I was in two different hotels going from the lobby to the guest floors. The room was what I would call fairly generous in size (at least compared to some other cities). Since the hotel was nowhere near capacity during our stay (in fact is was empty the first 2-3 nights), the casual cafe/coffee shop was not open for breakfast. Only the main dining room was open. When a conference group came in during our 4th day there, they opened all the restaurants. We really did not utilize the dining options. For the first 3-4 nights we were there, the main pool was closed for repairs, but the smaller pool was open until 10pm. The healthclub also closes at 9pm. The hotel offers both valet and self parking. I would definitely plan to stay at this hotel again.

<Title>“Excellent service; beautiful view.”
<Content>The moment we entered the West Tower lobby, we were greeted by a staff who seemed genuinely interested in making our stay a pleasant one. My brother's family had booked a separate reservation. To accomodate my request that we have rooms on the same floor, his room was upgraded so that he could have a room across the hall. Throughout our stay, the desk staff was helpful in giving directions. My room was facing the harbor; the view from the balcony was especially beautiful at night. The room was spacious and very clean. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on. Though the bathroom was a little small, it was adequate, and the water pressure in the shower was very good. On the down side, there were fees for self parking ($16/day) and use of the fitness center ($10). There was no refrigerator or minibar in the room, but I think we could have obtained one for a fee.

<Title>“Hotwire patrons beware”
<Content>We stayed here around Christmas. Got a special on Hotwire, which seemed like a good deal at the time. However, we were placed in one of the "Lanai" rooms, which is basically a sprawling, 2-story complex of dark, musty rooms with a hallway open to the elements. Think of this as 3rd class in the Titanic, assigned to the common riff-raff who try to save a few bucks. Not much better than a roadside motel. The room was adequate, but nothing special. The grounds themsevles were well maintained, and had a great pool and marina area. Good location near downtown. No airport noise to speak of. However, If I were to ever stay here again, I'd definitely want a tower room.

<Title>“Good View and Location”
<Content>We were here for a conference Jan 30 - Feb 1 , 2005. We stayed in the West tower (the smaller one) which had less amenities (smaller pool, less restaurants) but seemed less busy (reception less chaotic) and I prefered it to the East tower because of this. The pool at the West tower is fantastic looking though. Our room faced the harbour which was a lovely view and quieter than facing the marina. Marina facing rooms also face the airport and a busy road. The harbour facing rooms don't hear any airport or traffic noise. All rooms have nice balconies. The room was standard corporate design and needed redecorating to modernise the curtains and wallpaper. The beds and bedding were really nice and comfy. The room/plumbing were quiet. The location is great. Easy to find your way back to as you follow airport signs! Close to the highway and central to many attractions. The self parking is easy (charge). There's a nice walk along the harbour, and along the marina between the 2 towers. I probably wouldn't stay here if I was paying for it myself, unless there was a good deal on. After the 2 nights here we moved to the Empress Hotel in La Jolla, a smaller hotel.

<Title>“had a merry Christmas”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton Christmas Eve and Christmas before heading on a cruise. Everyone was friendly, helpful and courteous. Upon arrival we upgraded for $20 since I had read the tip at Trip Advisor. We had gotten an excellent holiday discount on the net from the Sheraton, so we paid very little for such a nice room on the 10th floor. The Christmas decorations and music were lovely. The redecorated restaurant had a special Christmas menu. Someone who has a lot of money might expect a much fancier place. The hotel was perfect for two teachers, a teenager and a retired couple. We felt pampered.

The hotel was clean and grounds and pool area were beautiful. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Location was close to a lot of San Diego attractions. The only downside was the airport noise...normally we didn't hear the planes during the night but a couple of times planes took off early morning.

<Title>“Don't bother”
<Content>I visited San Diego for a conference and the conference was held at this hotel. I didn't have a choice of hotel so I stayed. Some of my colleagues stayed at the "overflow" hotel, which was the Westin and that hotel outclassed the Sheraton in every sense of the word. The Westin is comparable in price and in the middle of downtown... a much better choice! The lobby of he Sheraton was constant mayhem for the five days I was there (Saturday through Wednesday). The service at the main restaurant was horrendous and a hostess was never to be found. The menu is the same in the other restaurants in the hotel and also the same for room service... so much for choices. PLUS... There are no mini-bars in any of the rooms! The concierge and front desk staff were very helpful, as were the business center staff. But the business center is not open very late. The hallways smell like a toilet when the staff is cleaning the rooms... although they are very friendly and accomodating. The location is what is also one of the worst aspects of this hotel. It is an airport hotel... if you are going on vacation, you DO NOT want to stay in the airport hotel. A cab to the gaslamp quarter or to Sea World is about $12-$15 (with tip) and to the border of Tijuana, a cab will cost about $40. The trolly is nowhere near this hotel so you would have to take a cab to a trolly stop to try to save money on getting around.

<Title>“Just another airport hotel”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this hotel Oct. 4-8. We booked through Hotwire and were given a complimentary upgrade upon check-in - we ended up on the 5th floor of the west tower with a view of the marina. The pros: friendly staff, comfy beds. The cons: a boring and nondescript property - if you just need a bed near the airport - this would be a fine choice. We did not have a car - my husband taxied back and forth to the convention center ($11-$13 each way) and I took the complimentary hotel shuttle back to the airport (a 3 minute ride) to catch the city bus ($2.25 fare) to downtown. Harbor Island is not a place you will find much to do - if you were to walk to the downtown area, it would be about 3 miles. Airplane noise was constant, but only heard by us when we had the balcony door open. The west tower was a short walk to the east tower - which is where the main lobby and restaurants were located (west tower had one expensive Italian restaurant). Overall, the west tower seemed to be the neglected step sister - the pool and grounds were nothing more than plain. If you do end up staying at this property, an independant deli exists between the towers, and you can pick up sandwiches, wine, pastry, coffee, etc.. for a fraction of the cost the hotel will charge you. Simply put, there was nothing special about this place, but nothing to complain about either, considering we payed $100 a night.

<Title>“Never Again”
<Content>I stayed here because it was the location of our convention. The bed wa comfy, but there was one problem after the next. Remote didn't work, Shrek 2 was corrupted and overlaid with porn (a negative?), the first minute of a local call cost $13.00, and the shower curtains are cheap. It's as if the hotel couldn't decide if it wanted to be high class with its 'service promise' or a budget hotel where all the added expense is nickled-and-dimed out of you: phone calls, parking, health club access, etc. The room had stained carpets and felt dingy. I'd choose not to stay here again, and I'll probably skip all Sheratons. One star performance: Chris, the bartender and server in the italian restaurant onsite, is great. I was shocked to find great food and service in this restaurant with the days of disappointment experienced at the hotel.

<Title>“Overall pretty satisfied with the Sheraton”
<Content>We stayed in the West Tower, 11th floor. The view was lovely, the room was larger than expected and very clean. Wonderful linen, good supply of towels. Front desk and attendants were polite and helpful. Parking was not a problem. It is expensive at $16 a night, but that is what most downtown hotels charge. The downside is that it cost $25 to have a refridgerator and there was a shortage of them. There is some airplane noise between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. Nicer amenities at the East Tower (pool, lobby, restaurants, etc.), but the walk did not bother us and the lobby did not matter much to us. Not much around the outside of the hotel except a deli open limited hours. Overall we enjoyed our stay.

<Title>“Beware the "Lanai Rooms" adjacent to East Tower”
<Content>We were given a "Hotwire Special" room: a dark, dank first floor room in the "lanai" area of the East tower. The room had a lovely view of a...wall..., was dark and dreary, and most importantly, had a bad mildew/mold odor. They could not/would not relocate us that night to a habitable room, so we were walked to a motel. They seemed to know right away what we were talking about with the mildew/mold complaint. Why are they assigning guests to rooms with that kind of problem? We came back the next day, and were given a better room and a food credit to use at the hotel. The main East tower pool was cold and did not appear to be heated. The room was adequate in size, but not spacious. This new room had no airport noise, and a nice view. The views from the upper stories are the best thing about this hotel, including its waterfront location. No in room safe, robes, minibar, newspaper, or other amenities common to that type of property. We had to laugh...the room cards STILL didn't work on the parking gate! Unless you can get a really good rate and guarantee a decent room, there are better values elsewhere. If you do encounter a problem, speak up immediately and insist it be corrected, or at least that you are offered something under their "service guarantee."

<Title>“Nice Hotel, Fabulous Destination”
<Content>This hotel was great. We stayed five nights in mid August of 2004. The pools were great, the lobby beautiful, and the restaurants delicious. The room was pretty standard, however it was nice to have down pillows and a real comforter, not just a bedspread. The staff was awesome! Although, there were a couple problems.. forgotten hairdryer in the room, no newspaper, and one night the neighbor's alarm went off for about two hours. The good news: Sheraton was more than apologetic.. they gave us $50 off our bill and two free lunch vouchers (a $20 value). This treatment was a nice surprise and much better than just a "sorry". We'll definetely stay there again!

<Title>“Sheraton San Diego--A Split Personality”
<Content>From 25-28 July my family and I stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Hotel And Marina. While our stay was comfortable, the fact is that this property has a split personality; the East Tower has the lion’s share of facilities/amenities while the West Tower (where we stayed) is the poor neighbor. The West Tower of this property does not match it's sister tower. The hotel’s two towers separated by over 400 yards (a 5-10 minute walk); while I have experienced similar “sister” properties, this is my first experience with a hotel that has such disparate distance AND quality levels between segments of its property. The West Tower’s facilities included a 3-meal restaurant, pool/spa, and gift shop. It lacked the following amenities offered in the East Tower: 1. Concierge service 2. Casual Restaurant/Tavern 3. Lobby Bar 4. Fitness Facility 5. Comprehensive Business Center 6. Pool Restaurant The West Tower just exuded an aura of neglect—the building exterior is in need of refinishing, and the hallways, especially adjacent to meeting spaces, had a musty odor. The pool area was neglected for much of the day—in several instances, the pool towel supply was exhausted and repeated calls for replenishment for not heeded. The sole bright spot was that the rooms in this tower are comfortable, nicely furnished, and larger than those in the East Tower. There was no mini-bar (West Tower mini-bars had been discontinued), no bathrobe, and no comprehensive Business Center in the West Tower. One (1) of our two (2) phones was not functioning, and building maintenance had to be called to fix it. The second morning of our stay we discovered that our in-room coffee supply had not been replenished. Finally, our room had no phone books. All of these oversights were corrected in a timely fashion, but they added to the effect that you were staying on the “wrong side of the street.”

<Title>“Not one of the better hotels in the area”
<Content>My family and I stayed for two nights (3 rooms) and we all agreed that other than the main lobby, this hotel is in need of some serious work. The buildings are old and run down. Stained carpets, peeling wallpaper, squeaky elevators, and sporadic hot water. To add to that, the staff was not friendly at all and slow to respond. My brother's room had no towels or coffee maker when he checked in and it took most of the first day to get these items. He had to find a housekeeper's cart to get his own towels. They also overcharge for what they do offer. $10 per day if you want to use their fitness room, $16 for parking, $4 for a bottle of water, etc. I stayed at the Omni in San Diego the week prior and found it to be a much better value. Also, the hotel is not located near any trolley line or public transportation which is an ideal way to get around downtown San Diego. Their shuttle runs from the airport to the hotel, which is only a block away. This is one Sheraton that is in need of a major renovation, including the attitude of its staff. You can do better for your money.

<Title>“Wonderful hotel”
<Content>This property is now my first choice in San Diego. I just returned from a two-night stay at the Sheraton Shelter Island (East Tower) and I couldn't be happier. From the minute the smiling Samantha checked us in at the front desk, I knew my experience was going to be good. The room was more than adequate, the view spectacular, the staff uniformly charming and accomodating. I used the concierge to book dinner at Red Tracton's in Del Mar. I used guest services to purchase passes for the zoo. I used the safe deposit box in the lobby. My every contact with the staff was met with professional, friendly and gracious service. I travel frequently for pleasure and I've stayed at some of the most highly regarded resorts in this hemisphere. This hotel property well deserves the four-star rating. The professionalism of the staff would actually put it in the five-star category, at least for me.

<Title>“Very nice hotel”
<Content>After having read all of the negative reviews of this hotel before our trip, I felt compelled to share my opinion. My family of four just completed a 10 day California coast vacation which ended with two nights in the West Tower, 7/28 and 7/29. We loved it. We had a room on the 10th floor overlooking the marina and the airport. Terrific view. Personally, I love to watch the planes take off. But, since there was very little airplane activity between 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., we were able to sleep with the balcony door open and let the cool, fresh San Diego air into the room. The noise was not a problem. We did not use the West Tower pool, but the kids loved the pool at the East Tower with its volley ball net and basketball hoop. Yes, it's a 5 minute walk from one tower to the next, but it's along a beautiful marina. What's not to like about that? A lot of reviewers have complained about the parking situation. Well, our room key did not work in the parking lot the first night, but the attendant was very helpful and let us out without a problem. I got another key from the front desk the next morning and it worked fine. I saw it as a very minor inconvenience. We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants. With all of the great restaurants in San Diego, why would you want to? Take the short drive to Seaport Village, the Gaslamp Quarter, or Old Town. We did have breakfast at the deli along the marina one morning and it was fine. We are looking forward to our next visit to San Diego and we would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“Very bad hotel, very bad location...”
<Content>My wife and I just returned from a terrible, noisey, and unfriendly stay here. We booked through an online travel site and got a decent rate of about $110/night. Because we booked through the internet discount site, the hotel was very rude to us, treating us like second class citizens. They actually said if we wanted a decent room (and not the one on the first floor facing the parking lot) that we should re-book our reservation through the hotel. (even though they knew we had pre-paid online which wasn't refundable) The air-conditioning turns off every few minutes and you must get up to turn it back on, all NIGHT!! When we complained, the front desk was extremely unapologetic and truly didn't even PRETEND to care. We heard many other guests complaining and some checked out early as we arrived. We are frequent travelers and have never been treated so badly. There is also tons of airplane noise as it is directly across from the airport and there is NOTHING within walking distance. You must park your car in their lot which will cost you $16/day for self-park, $22 for valet. My other complaint was that concierge recommended bad restaurants to us. In fact, we showed up at one and left as it was a total tourist trap. That really annoyed me. We informed them we were food lovers (we live in NYC and are used to great restaurants--not fancy necessarily---just great food) and we were sent to overpriced, bland places filled with travelers. Everything about our stay was very disappointing. There are much better hotels for the price. I suggest going to stay in a better area where you can walk around and not be constantly alarmed by the planes flying constantly overhead. Stay somewhere where you will be valued and appreciated.

<Title>“Absolute WORST hotel ever!”
<Content>Jeez! I don't know where to begin. Long story short. Hubby and I booked thru Hotwire and paid $103/nt for 3 nt stay. We were treated like peasants for booking with Hotwire and were told we would be getting the only room available, on the first floor overlooking the parking lot. I told rude front desk girl (Anna) that I had checked w/their website that morning and saw tons of availability and that it was our anniversary and we wanted a room overlooking the water. She said no and argued with me for FIFTEEN MINUTES until she finally "unblocked" a room with a view on the 7th floor for and extra $20/nt. (Nice welcome, huh?) FINE! The room was gross. A filthy carpet, and very digustingly stained bedspread. The room was SMALL (and I live in NYC where our standards in the space dept. are seriously below the nat'l average) and the air conditioning would turn off after literally 2 minutes and NEVER go back on unless you got up and pressed the button. Not fun in the middle of the night. When we complained after a sleepless night, they offered no apology and said they'd send an engineer up to fix it. When he arrived, he told us this was how the hotel saves money and that people were constantly annoyed about it. The list goes on and on. The staff TRULY doesn't care, they are completely miserable and apathetic. Don't stay here. There are so many good hotels. I suggest getting away from the airport area in general and staying in a place where you can walk around. The airport noise was definitely annoying as was the $16/day parking fee and the entire experience. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this disgraceful, no-star hotel.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay 6/22-6/27”
<Content>Room was smallish but comfortable in the East Tower. The view was excellent. We watched a Naval aircraft carrier on maneuvers our last day there. The balcony just fit the two chairs and small table. The room was clean and suited our needs. The upside to this hotel was the excellent service, the pool, the view, and the comfortable bed. The only downside to our stay was lack of hot water and water pressure during peak times. It wasn't cold, just luke warm. And the food is okay but you could do better elsewhere. Parking is expensive. $16 for self park, $22 for valet. I would recommend bringing your cell phone or using the lobby pay phones if you don't upgrade. $2 charge for local and 800 number (that's each call). Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton and would recommend it.

<Title>“Great West Tower location!”
<Content>I just returned from two nights at the Sheraton Hotel and Marina. When I was told my room was in the West tower, I was a bit concerned after reading the reviews here. However, I couldn't have been more pleased. My room was on the corner of the top floor (12th). It had floor to ceiling windows on two walls with a huge (larger than the room) rooftop patio which I entered through a french door. The patio had two sun lounge chairs, a glass top patio table with four chairs, two additional chairs with a small table, and a potted palm tree. The patio overlooked the wedding garden, pool, marina with boats on the right and across the water to the left was the military helicopter pads and ships. Across the water I saw a fireworks show one evening. The patio area was perfect for enjoying breakfast and the wonderful San Diego weather. When inside the room I didn't hear any airport noise. Rarely outside did I hear airplanes. The interior of the room had plush down comforters and pillows on both beds with soft sheets. The bathroom was large with marble floors, walls, and glass enclosed Jacuzzi tub and shower. The bathroom also had real plants. The sink counter area was large. I heard no noise from any other rooms, never even heard or saw another guest on my floor, though I know there must have been some, since housekeeping was cleaning rooms besides mine. The only negative things I noticed were stains on the carpet, the ice machine on my floor was broken, and I had no remote for the television. These were minor details easily overlooked with the many benefits of this room. I looked forward to returning to this room at the end of each day, and would love to return to this room on another trip!

<Title>“Very Comfortable Room”
<Content>I was there for one night only, on May 15, 2004. I was in San Diego for a wedding, and was not interested in the resort aspects of the hotel. I travel a lot, both on business and pleasure, and found the room, which was in the much criticized west tower, to be well above average. The room was spotless. There was a pillowtop bed with all cotton sheets, which gave me an excellent night's sleep. The bathroom was large and first rate. It had a magnifying mirror at eye level, which was great for putting on makeup; a real blow dryer (not one of those anemic wall types); and a shower that appeared to be tall enough for men over six feet tall, with strong water pressure. The staff was very accomodating, allowing me to check in early and also accompanying me to my room when the first key card that I received did not work properly. The room also seemed to be sound proof; I did not hear any planes from the nearby airport, and also did not hear any noise from the elevator and exterior door that were very close to my room. They do charge too much for the parking ($16) and phone calls ($2 even for local calls and calling card calls). Otherwise, I have no complaints.

<Title>“A motel with a view”
<Content>Beware the "west tower" if you're unlucky enough to be booked at this hotel. This Sheraton is basically a high rise motel with a good view (from some rooms). The scoop is there is the main building and a separate "tower" -- which is essentially another hotel taken over by Sheraton several years ago. The condition of the west tower is poor and the room decor and amenities poorer than poor. My room was so dirty I had to wipe obvious foreign matter off the walls with a wet towel. When I objected at check in to being placed in this Siberia, I was given the brush off and told the West tower was "better" because it used to be a Westin -- huh -- maybe during the Carter administration? Also, if you're attending a convention beware the check out -- there's a shuttle bus but it fills up quickly, leaving people with flights to catch walking the mile to the airport. Finally, if you're not into $20.00 breakfasts, you have the choice of a grim little deli nearby. Nothing, I repeat nothing, is within walking distance of either Sheraton tower.

<Title>“The West Tower is not a 4 star hotel”
<Content>We stayed 5 days at this hotel (Room 795, April 22-26, 2004) and had a nice time overall in San Diego. We bought a "vacation package" from Hotwire that included this hotel and airplane tickets from San Jose, CA.The staff was all helpful and pleasant (except for one instance described below). The main complaint I have is that I was expecting a 4 star hotel and what I experienced was a 2.5 star facility. We were given a room in the "West Tower". This seems to be the older and more run down half with these deficiencies:1) the single small swimming pool at this tower was not heated and too cold to swim in 2) the room did not have a fridge (had to pay $16 to have one brought in to our room)3) the hotel does not have a VCR even to rent4) our "upgraded" room ($20/night extra) showed signs of age and had elevator noise5) the tub was clogged the first day (they fixed it and gave us a pancake breakfast)6) bathroom light bulbs were burned out our whole stay7) the parking (extra ~$16/day) had a gate entry that never recognized our key and the exit was often delayed with a line of cars8) the elevator closest to our room was very run down, scratched, dingy, but functionalAs a final complaint: We went to the "East Tower" to go swimming since they had a nice large heated pool unlike the "motel" pool at the "West Tower". When we finished swimming, we could not find a bathroom or dressing room of any type to change in. When we asked the fitness center attendant where we could change she treated us like we were'nt even guests. She asked what room we were staying in (what does that matter?) and when I told her we were in the West Tower room 795 she said we would have to pay a fee to use the fitness center dressing room. I told her that was ridiculous and she suggested that we walk through the adjacent restaurant and into a single bathroom and change there.... we were treated like second class citizens. When reading the Sheraton hotel description you sure don't get the glaring distinction between the towers.Again, my complaint is that I was sold a "4 star" hotel and what I got was much lower than that standard.Al Tadros

<Title>“Loved the Hotel -- Would stay again”
<Content>We stayed for 3 days. Yes, it is very close to the airport. So if you are arriving late, you will be in a comfy bed in no time. I did not consider the airport noise to be a bother at all, and there were no flights after 10pm anyway. We stayed in the West Tower. The rooms were huge and very nicely appointed king rooms. The views from the balcony are great from any side of the hotel you are on. The East Tower does have a different configuration, but has the nicer pool, fitness facilities and restaurants. There is a short walk along the marina between the two towers. They also have a shuttle to take you if would rather. Airport shuttles run every less-than-15 minutes. You are about 2-3 miles from downtown San Diego and the cruise pier. A cab would run you about $7. They have a great bike/jogging trail around the island and to the city. We rented bikes from the hotel in the morning and biked the 15-20 min ride into downtown San Diego and had nice breakfast. The staff at the Sheraton West Tower was very awesome and really knew how to take care of things very well. The only bad thing I would say about the hotel is that there is no cafe in the West Tower, the pool was freezing and the housekeeping staff needs more training. They often forgot to finish the job before moving on to the next room. We would and look forward to staying there again.

<Title>“Wonderful Experience”
<Content>Having read some of the complaints here about the San Diego Sheraton Marina Hotel I must admit I was a little nervous, having booked there thru Hotwire. My family and I arrived on April 8, 2004 for a six night stay and right away we knew this was going to be a great vacation. We pulled up to the East tower where we were told by the valet that our reservations were at the West tower, a block down the road. We were offered a room upgrade for $20 a day to the 11th floor (which we accepted) with a wonderful view of the marina and the surrounding San Diego area. Everyone at this hotel bent over backwards to see that your stay was exceptional. Our room looked across the Marina at the aiport, which though busy was not a distraction nor did it interfere with our sleeping. The room was clean and comfortable and again the service was exceptional. They do nickel dime you a bit especially with the parking fees but hey, everthing is more expensive in California. Overall we would not hesitate to stay at this Sheraton again.

<Title>“Too Isolated, Too Noisy, Bad Parking, Bad Choice”
<Content>My wife, two kids (ages 7 and 3), and I stayed in the East Tower from April 6-9. We upgraded to the 15th floor Club Level (the highest floor on which their are lodging rooms), free self-parking (normally $16 per night), and free continental breakfast (normally $11.95 per person). The hotel is on a man-made island adjacent to the airport. With the exception of a walking trail around the marina, the hotel is not walking distance to anything. The room itself was fairly small (approximately 10 feet wide and 20 feet long (including the bathroom)), furnishing nicely and in good condition (except for some mold on the ceiling above the shower/tub). It had a sliding door leading to a small balcony with a view of a good portion of the marina, and further away, downtown San Diego. We checked in at night and the view of the city lights was very nice. However, within a matter of minutes we were assaulted by the noise of airplanes taking off, seemingly directly over our room. The airplane noise decreased after 10 p.m. but during the night the air conditioning system made a loud metallic kicking noise when it turned on. The aiplanes returned at about 5 a.m. We could also hear a lot of motorcycle and other fast moving vehicle traffic from the street below. On our last night, we heard a child crying all night in the room next to ours. The self-parking is limited to those spaces farthest from the hotel; the spaces that are near the hotel are reserved for valet parking. The first night I had to hunt for about 10 minutes to find a parking space, and it was about 250 yards from the lobby. I found slightly closer parking spots for our second and third nights but they were still unacceptably far away. The continental breakfast is a buffet on the Penthouse level. Each day the selection was the same: nice pastries, bread for toasting, dry cereal in individual boxes, Yoplait yogurts, and fruit salad (watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, strawberries, pineapple, and a few blue berries). To drink, there is coffee, tea, milk and orange juice. There are about 10-12 tables, all of which have table clothes and a view of the marina. There were usually two waitresses, but their job is to clean up and keep the buffet stocked; they do not serve food. There are much better places to stay in San Diego. I have stayed in many hotels in San Diego, including the Sheraton's West Tower twice (it is better than the East Tower), and the Sheraton Suites (nice rooms but weird lobby and inconvenient loaction). If you want to be near the airport, in addition to the two Sheraton properties, there is also a Hilton (I have not stayed there). The convention center is not very far from the airport and there are many hotels near it. If you want to be able to walk to the beach, you need to choose a hotel in a different area of town. If you want to go to Sea World or the Zoo, there are also better places to stay. In sum, there really is no reason to stay at this Sheraton, it is noisy, the parking is bad, and it is not near anything other than the airport.

<Title>“No complaints here”
<Content>We stayed at the Sheraton San Diego Resort from March 19-March 24 and were thrilled with our choice!!! We had booked at Sheraton.com and had a great rate! We were on vacation for the week and stayed on the 11th floor in the west tower. We coudn't have been happier with the view of the naval habor with the carriers and other boats going by. The staff was friendly, courteous and we never had a problem with parking, the taking of the ticket was quick and easy. Being located on Habor Island Drive was an easy access to everything we wanted to do, although if staying here a car is a must. We had a great deal with a convertible for 12 days with Budget with unlimited miles for $250!The rooms were large, spacious, well cleaned while we were there and the front desk employees were friendly and helpful. When we arrived we did go check out the east tower, which I thought had a nice lobby and outside area. We never had time to go to any of the pools although they looked very nice.When going back we will stay at this hotel again!
