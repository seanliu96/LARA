<Title>“Ask for a deluxe to get oceanfront”
<Content>Love this resort- have stayed here 6 times in the last 4 years and I'm sure we will stay again. Love the huge pool area and easy steps to the beach. Plus ocean walk shops and movies attached to south tower. Mai tai is my favorite bar over there and the Wyndham offers the pool side bar turtles nest which makes killer buckets of rum. Pools and hot tubs open till midnight

<Title>“Not up to Wyndham Standards”
<Content>From mismatched decor to missing blind adjustment rod, this resort(?) did not live up to it's promise. I took guests with me and frankly was embarassed by the quality I discovered. The upholstery on the sofa was torn, the screened in porch couldn't be used because the screen was torn, the living room furniture was a mis mash of rattan, bergere and comtemporay styles. The sofa was gold, the two rattan chairs were in watercolor pastels and the bergere chair was in navy and burgundy. The draperies were watercolor pastels, and the backing so badly worn that the light showed through them. THe fixtures on the kitchen sink were loose and I gave this list to the person at the checkout desk. I emailed Wyndham and received no answer, so much for servie! and quality. I would not recommend this resort!Room 703

<Title>“"Never again"”
<Content>Labor Day weekend was my 3rd visit. Very disappointed. Not enough tubes for the lazy river, rarely were able to use and never an empty chair by the pool either. In the past there has been a DJ for entertainment at the pool deck, which is no longer budgeted. As far as the room, the entire room was dusty and the balcony was filthy. The comforters on the beds were not sufficient. We asked for clean towels and were told to wash our own, we asked for clean sheets for one of the beds, which they also instructed us to wash and remake on our own. We were told to take our trash to the chute in the trash room, which was so full you couldn't get to the chute, with piles of garbage everywhere. We were on vacation and hardly wanted to spend our weekend cleaning house, therefore, I will stay where i get the service I paid for.

<Title>“Overcrowded!”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel twice now. Both times it was very overcrowded. Not enough parking spaces, not enough chairs by the pool, not enough luggage carts, elevators crowded and very slow. On our first visit, we stayed for one week and only got a chair by the pool one day out of the seven that we stayed. You have to wait in a long line to check out a luggage cart, and usually wait quit a while for an elevator. Rooms are old although ours were mostly clean. No kitchen towels on second visit. Several items in room broken on first visit. Furniture needed cleaning in both of our rooms. Do not count on the pull out couches...they are a joke. Long check in lines. Do not buy a timeshare here...not worth the money!

<Title>“A filthy stay”
<Content>STAY AT THE HILTON or THE PLAZA. Our stay at OCEAN WALK was absolutely misserable. The room was dirty, the furniture was filthy and worn out, the washer and dryer was broken, the fan in the bathroom burnt out on the second day. We tried to change rooms and they told me I would have to pay a cleanning fee, because I stayed a night in there.There were no other rooms to check into, according to them, so we had to take this room. We were suppose to check in by 4 and we did not get into our room until 5. That was the hotels, fault. We where there, their cleaning crew was running behind. I booked my room back in Feb. and still had to wait. Unacceptable. I have a business and always told people about the Ocean Walk. I will not recommend them to anyone again. They were not willing to even look at the room. The manager was so damn lazy she could not even come out and talk with us. There was no excuse, I paid $600 for a filth. At one time Ocean Walk was a absolute beautiful hotel, and they made your stay very nice and you wanted to return, it is not that way anymore. They are just spending their profits and not putting back into their business. Ocean Walk has failed.

<Title>“Horrible Experience Aug 2012 - no consideration for disabled persons”
<Content>booked reservation for handicap w/acc shower, called 4x before stay to confirm this type of room. upon arrival they had no handicap acc room available. after finally checking in 2 hours after the sched check in time we were sent all over the hotel to get to the oceanwalk shops - handicap elevator stuck with us in it...staff extremely uncaring and not helpful in our situation at all. we were then told later that night there was a room available the bellman moved us while we were at dinner, only to find that the new room didn't have a roll in shower either. after another visit to the front desk we were told sorry, nothing else available, unbelievable. we were told we needed to make a decision as to what is important ocean front or acc room when we booked ocean front acc room why should we not get what we booked? don't book if you need acc room they do not accomodate when they say they will and you are stuck at that point. think carefully before booking here if you are disabled...

<Title>“Nice stay, Great Location.”
<Content>We stayed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk for the Labor Day weekend. The hotel is really nice for the area. Its Nothing too fancy, but given the other hotels in Daytona, its probably one of the nicest. The pool and beach area is a little too crowded for my taste but with a hotel that big, its to be expected. A few of the goods and bads. The goods: Big, clean hotel with nice, comfy rooms and beds. Our room was through an independent owner and it was really nice but i saw into some other rooms and they all looked cozy. The place is big. It has two towers and a helpful, patient staff. The indoor golf was a nice plus as was the lazy river and the waterslide. The location is the best on the beach, as the hotel connects with a crosswalk to a water park and an outdoor multilevel shopping area, complete with bars and restaurants. Also there is a huge auditorium-like stage right there on the boardwalk, where they had bands playing. The bads: The elevators are slow. SLOW. I found myself taking the stairs (coolers, beach chairs and umbrella in hand), because of the wait. The beach chair rental service was another negative. They set up rental chairs behind the hotel on the beach very early in the morning. But they take up nearly the whole beach, so if you happen to bring your own chairs and umbrella, you have to squeeze into a spot to set up. Its pretty crowded. Reminds me of the rear of La Vela in Panama City Beach. And lastly, (and this may only happen on certain days) was the parking. We went to eat one night and came back and was told we had to park across the street in a parking deck. Kinda annoying but no biggie, as the parking deck is connected by a crosswalk. The aggravation comes during the process of getting your car out. The hotel apparently leases spots from this parking garage and covers the cost of parking when Their own lot gets full. Getting your car is a hassle. You have to park and walk into an office then sign some papers, then they give you a key card to exit, then you have to take your card back to front desk or you will be charged $50. It was just too much walking and agggravation. But all in all it was a great stay, I would go back. I think, given the cost, we will try somewhere different next year. But it was still a great stay. And in a great spot. PS...There is NO driving on the beach behind this hotel. So if you bring towels and chairs and coolers...keep in mind that you will have to carry all that stuff.

<Title>“A day in Daytona Beach”
<Content>Well in Dayton there's some rides and all the souvnier shops you could want. There are many hotels too choose from but here's my advice: if you get a hotel next to the ocean, even if you don't get an ocean view, your stay will cost more. It's better if you go to a hotel like the "Quinta Suites". It's a little more smaller but very good service and quality, and less than $90 a night for 4 people. Besides that I had a really good day in Daytona beach.

<Title>“Nice place”
<Content>Ok so with kids I do recommend this place both of mine had a blast here. So as I always do I'll take u from pull up to check out. It's in a great location central to all that is Daytona. As we arrived we were greeted by a guard that guided me to the check in desk. Once there I was greeted by a really nice lobby and an equally nice receptionist who made short work of the check in process. I mount my noble steed and I start my trek up the turns of the parking garage. After getting as close as I could to the 13th floor I parked and made our way to our room we were in the south tower in room 1314. I open the door and was greeted by a pleasant smell and well decorated room with small stove,fridge,micro,and all the comforts of home. Being tired from the travel it was bed time I crawled into a very nice kingsized bed a sleept like a very tired baby. I wad awaken by my son saying dad come on let's go of course its 7 am at this point I roll from my slumber nest and put my trunks on don the sun block and away we go. We start off at the lazy river which was empty at 9 am but the kids didn't really love it sure it was fun but the tubes that you have to use are for adults not 6 and 4 year old frames so when seated in the proper relaxed floating position they would fall through the hole in the center of the tube which meant they would have to take this journey aboard the SS daddy that's right they road my back as I road the tube...its ok you will figure it out in a minute anyway not the most fun activity. So.we moved to the muddy splash pad also empty at this time we had fun here some of the spray nozzles were broken or wouldn't turn off but not something the kids paid any attention to we played here for a good hour before the water slide open at which point of course won over the splash area the slide is nice a pretty low speed but you do have to be 42"tall to ride it dumps into the shallow end of the pool with plenty of picture taking room for all of us parents that are crazy like that. All of the amenities that used were great this looks like the place that both parents and couples can have fun with something to do for everyone. So will I stay here again yes will I recommend yes we had a great time and I was impressed with this property.

<Title>“We stay here a week every summer, love it!”
<Content>Daytona Beach is our favorite beach. Lots of entertaining activity. We are Wyndham owners, so we only book through Wyndham using our points, we've never had a problem in the 13 years we've been staying at this resort. I can understand where confusion could happen. There are units that people own, they rent out themselves and Wyndham has nothing to do with. There are units that are rented out on the internet, etc. (This seems where a lot of problems happen, overbooking, downgrading, etc.) And using traditional Wyndham points (this is what we do). We've always had a good experience, always got the room we booked. There are 2 towers. Each tower has a different security company, confusing. The pool is always busy, so we save up and rent an umbrella and chairs for the week, and stay on the beach everyday. You can get in a pool anywhere. This is a Timeshare resort, not a hotel, there is no maid service. Most units have a washer/dryer. We stay in a one bedroom deluxe unit, very spacious, whirlpool tub, full kitchen. This is an area that you can park your car and leave it parked all week. The only time we got in our car was the first day to get some groceries from Publix. We love this resort and plan to be back every year. One tip also, a smile and a friendly attitude is much better than screaming if there is a problem. Your problem may get solved a lot quicker if you don't scream at the employee. A smile can go a long way.

<Title>“Very Nice Visit”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk for the first time and were very impressed with the resort. The room was immaculate - nothing broken or not working, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the location is excellent. It would be nice if the onsite restaurant offered a more diverse menu - the food was mediocre at best. The resort has combined a gift store/sundries/restaurant and as a result, the selection is minimal. It would be nice to be able to purchase a bar of soap at the gift store/restaurant since soap is not provided in the room. Instead we had to walk down the block to the small grocery store on the corner. Not a big deal, but a minor inconvenience. There was some confusion at the pool area when it stormed. I guess one pool and the kiddie pool is overseen by a separate group of security than the lazy river and pool with a slide, and because of this, one side was open and one side was closed, which was very confusing to guests. I was told that the side with the lazy river and pool with a slide closes and opens according to what the beach patrol does at the beach, and the other side does not. We would definitely stay at the resort again and really enjoyed our visit.

<Title>“POOR SAFETY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE”
<Content>If you are taking a getaway or just want time for yourself, this is not a safe place to do that. I am in the process of getting divorced, and decided to use my wyndham points to get away from the realworld... grabbed my kids (3 & 1yrs) and left to Daytona. When I checked in I specified that I did not want ANYONE to have a key other than me, that my husband is convinced that I am leaving him for someone else, the lady gave me a sheet and told me to write down whoever I wanted authorized to get a key, and I only wrote MY name. To my surprise, my soon to be EX just walked in the room... THE FRONT DESK GAVE HIM A KEY!!! When I spoke to the front desk supervisor the idiot said... "oh that wasnt me... I wasnt here" Really??? If he would have came to kill me, he would have succesfully done so, and nobody would know until I had to check out!!! Do you think anyone cared?? NO... I took it up further and called Wyndham... and guess what they did... NOTHING... I wasnt able to get my room changed, key reprogrammed ... NOTHING!!!... Wyndham just blew it... I will never ever stay nor recommend Wyndham to anyone...

<Title>“Not so friendly.”
<Content>On arrival we discovered that the type of room we requested when booking our hotel room did not exist the clerk at the front desk was rude. She went on to explain that the hotel does not do their own reservations with a negative attitude . Be aware of the pool towel check out. They don't tell you at the time you pick them up that you have to keep the same towel your entire stay so if you don't pick up enough for your entire group then your stuck with sharing. The water in the rooms kept shutting off between 9 am-11am. The location is great and the rooms are very roomy. The view we had did end up being ok but was not ocean front as requested and booked.

<Title>“Daytona Beach- Wyndham Ocean Walk”
<Content>I arrived early and just stopped bythe desk to see if they could hold my bags- much to my surprose the room was ready and I was able to check in. The unit had all the conviences of home and more! I had a wonderful oceanfront unit where I enjoyed sitting on the balcony late at night having a drink and listening to the ocean (very relaxing) On Satuday evening I could hear the band and have a wonderful view of the fireworks, The lazy river pool was my favorite place- very relaxing most of the time, Security had a hard time with the kids who kept jumping in wth out tubes. All in all a wonderful vacation with much to do in the area- I hope to be back agan!

<Title>“Awesome resort!”
<Content>My daughter and I stayed four nights and we love love loved it! The only negative things I can think of is waiting for the elevator and checking in took forever. Besides that the beach was great, staff was helpful, view was outstanding, condo had everything we needed, pools where wonderful and we can't wait to go back! There's also the Ocean Walk shops next door. So when it rains, which is did every day we were able to go to the 4th floor and just step out to the shops (they're connected). There's restaurants, shops, Starbucks, and even a movie theater. Lots of stuff to see and do within walking distance. My 5 year said she wants to stay for 16 nights next time. :)

<Title>“Location A+, Management Attitude F-”
<Content>Beautiful property. This is the kind of quality and beautiful property that deserves the "Resort" title. Incredible common areas, clean, pool is beautiful, lazy river is A+, Front Desk staff are very pleasant and helpful, and the location is of course beachfront. Check in went smoothly, plenty of walking-distance food and activities. The only negative, and I will say it is A BIG NEGATIVE, is that we had contact with 4 management members and all were very discourteous, argumentative, and down-right unpleasant in the case of 2 of them (the food service "director" in specific served me in the snack bar area, taking my money, no thank you, no have a nice day, no words at all. WOW BAD!!!) The "Second Highest" Manager (Vena??) literally tried to chase me down to argue with me. These people can learn something from the hourly staff who was in general exceptional. Hospitality is the name of the industry for a reason.

<Title>“Back again”
<Content>I think this was our third stay at the Wyndham Ocean Walk. We did enjoy the stay and the property. Checkin.....We arrived at a good time and line moved pretty quickly. Over our stay we did see the line short at times and long at others. It is really hit and miss, They told us that Friday, Saturday and Sunday checkins are busier. The room.....The room was great. We had a 2 bedroom with a side ocean view. The view was not as good as ocean front, but still not bad at all. The room had everything in it that we would ever need, always does. The deck area.....Well, on a summer weekend, if you are not on the deck by 8am, you are going to have trouble getting a lounge chair. This July was busier at the resort than our last visits. Of course the beach is always available. We like how they have security making sure that the kids do not get too crazy in the river and around the pool. Bonnet Creek in Orlando could learn a thing or two from Ocean Walk. Also, I hate when one person comes down and puts towels on 5 chairs and then goes back upstairs for 2 hours. We asked the guards about this and they said they cannot do that, but they did and no one said a word or moved any towels off. I guess people will do it as long as they can get away with it. Another thing, the pool bar closed early every day. This makes no sense to me. Come 8pm, there would be countless people who would want to sit on the deck, have a drink and relax. They are losing money and the guests are missing out on a nice amenity. Other items.....Yes, wireless internet is only in the lobby. This visit, we really did not use it. We were just there to chill. The kids liked the karaoke in the bar at night. The kids liked the free indoor putt-putt when it got too hot or rain was threatening. Lazy river is always nice. One hot tub was closed, maybe a mechanical issue? Our room keys failed a few times and we had to get them fixed. Overall a very nice stay. We will be back.

<Title>“Great Place to Stay”
<Content>We arrived early (way before check in) and the staff were great and they allowed us to check in to our room upon arrival. The room was great. It was a one bedroom apartment style room. It had a full kitchen (oven, microwave, fridge). It even had all the cups, utensils, pots, pans, blender, toaster, and coffee maker. The living area space was very large with a flat screen tv (tv doesn't have hbo, but there are other cable channels), it also had very nice faux leather couch and lounge chair. The view from our room was breathtaking (especially in the morning as we watched the sun come up from our balcony). Even though the pool area was directly below we were high enough up that we could not hear much noise. The room itself was semi-clean, lots of dead bugs on the walls, and the bathroom was pretty creepy (we had to take a shower with shower shoes on). It could definitely use a good cleaning, but we didn't stay in the room much so it was ok. The beds were very hard, but tolerable. The hotel itself was nice, there was a nice place in the hotel that had small items for purchase, and hot food (the pizza was amazing). The first night we were there they had Karaoke in the Hotel Lobby area, and it was great - lots of fun. This hotel is definitely a family hotel, there were lots and lots of kids, the pool area was always packed, you had to get in line around 7am (pool opened at 8:15) in order to get a good chair by the pool. Everything was very close to the hotel, including Starbucks and a great places to eat (Bubba Gump Shrimp, and a AWESOME WING PLACE). Area t-shirt shops around the hotel, and little convenience store that we walked to to get breakfast items and lunch meat. Overall, our time here (4 days) was great, we didn't have one complaint. However, please keep in mind that this place is mainly a TIMESHARE location, so upon arrival they did try to sign us up for the 90 minute time share spill, we declined of course. They don't have toothbrushes, or toothpaste at the front desk, you will need to bring all of your amenities with you or purchase them upon arrival. They do have a great arcade room fitness center, and indoor pool. If we could, I would love to stay here again, our stay was very comfortable, and relaxing - Highly Recommend!

<Title>“Ocean Walk, Daytona Beach”
<Content>Unfortunately, our one bedroom ocean front was below average. Upon check-in, we were told our room would not be ready for a few hours, 4 to be exact. The lines were long at the front desk...once you confirmed your reservation, then you were sent to another desk. We would have enjoyed going out on the balcony, but the door handle for the sliding glass door was broken. If you opened it, it took 15 minutes to get it closed. The toilet ran continuously. There is no Wi-Fi in the rooms, you have to go to the lobby or lower level to get wi-fi on your laptop. While the lazy river is a great idea, there were never enough floats. The staff was kind and courteous. I loved the location of the facility. They offer activities during the day, but wasn't able to take advantage of that amenity.

<Content>Vacation was fabulous! Everyone in our family, from age 12 to 66 had a wonderful time. The 3 bedroom condo was clean and very roomy.Washer and dryer is a plus. Lobby and customer service was great. Outside facilities, swimming pools, lazy river and pool area were well kept and also very clean. We would give it an excellent rating but I must admit the only problem we found was with the mattress, just a little uncomfortable, except for the master bedroom which was fine but once they change them, it will be rated as 5 stars and excellent.

<Title>“Wyndham Ocean Walk - Experience (Horrible)”
<Content>Upon our arrival to the Wyndham Ocean Walk, we were placed in a studio room (not as reserved by us). We went to the front desk where they quickly sent me to Wyndham Reservations, which was closed, so we spent our Sunday evening in a small studio which we did not reserve. Monday we talked to reservations and they stated there was nothing they could do, but we should speak with the property. Each party was passing "the problem" to the other. The front desk then said they would contact corporate and would get back with me. Needless to say, I never heard back from the front desk. Here are some other problems we encountered; Security banged on our door at 10:30pm and hastily entered our room - stating that they saw someone from our balcony. Later to find out it was the wrong room, after awakening my entire family. No apologies were made by property management nor security. No WI-Fi Cable went out but was available in bar (Room cable was out for entire night) We have given original reservation rep our credit card, in regards to security deposit, yet we were ask again at check in to give another ($150) deposit. Basically, card was charged twice for one deposit. Basically, our stay was ruined by non-professional, customer "no" service from corporate, property and reservation "specialist." Due to our son attending Stetson University, our family is in the Daytona Beach area often throughout the year, however, we will never stay at the Wyndham Ocean Walk again.

<Title>“Good, but not great”
<Content>My family and I have been staying at the Ocean Walk since the first building opened, back when it was still run like a hotel, and continued doing so once it was turned into more of a condo facility. We've had great stays here, and only sub-par stays. This particular stay was about middle of the road. The buildings are clean, though they seem a little like they're becoming run down. It was just a few little things I noticed here and there, though nothing that stood out as red flags. The pools are nice, though the indoor pool was down right gross. It had way too much chlorine in it and about as much hair. We went in one afternoon when it was storming really bad (as it does frequently in Daytona) and that was the one and only trip to that pool. My son loved the kiddie area and the lazy river though! As for amenities - I love the fact that they do kiddie things every day, though i wish they did even more. My son was too young for such activities (only 1) but when we've stayed elsewhere, they had several organized activities every day and made sure that the activities were well posted. I'm not sure if we just didn't know about them or they didn't have them, but I'd love to see more of those. I feel like they had more several years ago, so maybe budget cuts has hurt that aspect? I also wish the little store had more options in it. Since most of the units have kitchenettes (or full kitchens), I think some basics would be handy such as bread, butter, etc. The most frustrating thing about the trip was our door lock. Nearly every time we went out, the door lock stopped working. We thought it was our keys for the first 2 days, but then we had multiple maintenance folks up and even their master keys did not work, confirming it was the lock. Then the finger pointing began: the owner of the unit said that it was the building's job to fix it, and the front desk said that the owner had to take care of it. Thankfully we had a larger unit with a second door, so we were able to get in, but it was incredibly frustrating to have to constantly get them to reset the door lock, which of course only fixed the issue for a few of us for a few hours before breaking again. And to boot, the elevators are the slowest I've ever encountered. It's not a bad place to stay by any means. It is family friendly and everyone is fairly nice - both staff and guests. There are 2 pools, a slide for big kids, a lazy river, 3 bars, and a great kiddie area. The location is great as well - near several restaurants, the boardwalk, and the movie theater is right next door for those rainy days. There were several days that we never even had to move our car from the garage. It's just not as great as it used to be and I'm concerned that it could be headed downhill.

<Title>“Beware the Roach Motel!”
<Content>Stayed first week of August, 2012. Beautiful setting and friendly staff, but this property has seen better days. Apparently, since they are the only hotel/motel in town, they feel they can get away with poor, unsanitary management. To call it a "resort" is a joke! First, the carpet in our unit was so soiled, one could not even discern its original color! The second day a "bug" crawled up the wall behind the couch while we were watching the Olympics. It was a roach! Of course, most all hotels deal with bugs, but what I did not expect was that under the kitchen sink were several dead roaches, and under both BR sinks in the cabinet was roach dirt "poop" where housekeeping had laid clean towels on top of without cleaning the cabinet first!! When I complained to the management they referred me to head of housekeeping (a contract company) who is off site. The first time no one showed up. The second time, the lady said she had only been on the job a few weeks and that she was short staffed and that the units are obviously not cleaned properly and need to be renovated. She made no offer to rectify the current situation, but complained about the shortage of permanent housing she could rent to keep her job on the island! We noticed ground staff spraying around the condo units later. The next morning a live 2" roach chased my son out of his room. That was the last straw! When we left that morning, we complained again to the "resort" management, and the Asst Mgr asked us what we wanted him to do as he was not responsible for housekeeping! I wanted at least a substantial discount on our room, if not a refund since we drove 6 hours to get there and there was not an alternative place to stay. In addition: 1. The Mini golf course was old, flooded, mildewed and had leaf/dirt litter all over it. 2. The pool had to be closed at dark, as the Security guard told us know one had bothered to fix the pool lights in quite some time... 3. Two units on our stove did not work, not did the garbage disposal. In fairness, they did send someone to fix those. 4. The toaster burnt toast on one side, even on the lightest setting. 5. They gave us metal cooking utensils to use in Teflon pans. You can imagine what those looked like! The Asst Manager said he would "have to check with head office about a discount/refund" since we had pre-paid. It is now a week later. Do you think I have heard anything back?! My advice: Go to Edisto Island - charming place. But do NOT stay here!!!

<Title>“NightMare Vacation!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”
<Content>My Reservation I had PrePaid for one month was for a One Bedroom Oceanfront Balcony View. When I went to check in the F/D Clerk told me that the hotel was Overbooked and instead of upgrading me they downgraded me to a tiny studio! I had 3 teenage boys and 2 adults, I was so LIVID and tired ! I was so UPSET they gave me a 1 bedroom parking view for the night. The following day they moved me to a Hallway room that had NO view and NO balcony. Then the Slide by the pool area was closed. There is NO ROOM SERVICE ! You have to wash your own towels !!!!! They even offered me detergent. I was in complete SHOCK ! Also...if their parking lot is full, guess what, You have to park across the street in the public parking garage. My boys were in the pool area and they had their sandals stolen. The security is NO Good ! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT STAY IN THIS HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HOTEL !!!!!!!!!!

<Title>“Wyndham Oceanwalk Resort? Daytona”
<Content>I recently visited this resort and this was what happened......I booked a room for 2 nights. We checked in Friday afternoon and were told we would be moved to another room on Saturday??? Ok, I reluctantly agreed. On Saturday I phoned the front desk as I was asked to do. I was informed my other room wasn't ready and the hotel would need to put my belongings in storage for a few hours?? Before I could even hang up the cleaning lady was at the door. I went to the front desk and told them this behavior was inappropriate. The manager told me of course it was and he would send a bellhop up to assist us. No one ever came and I put my things in my car for several hours while I waited. We went to the pool and it began to rain. I had to stand in the lobby for a few hours while I waited on the other room. What a trip. Never again.

<Title>“Short trip before school starting”
<Content>We had lots of fun but there were a few issues that bothered me. First, the lazy river is super fun but you have to be using a tube. You can't just float around without one. I don't understand the reasoning behind it. The problem is they dont have enough tubes so you have to sit there and wait for someone to leave. Also the slide, they close it super early, like 5 pm. It should be open late. Second, the hotel doesn't really have a good restaurant. Just a place to buy pizza that doesnt really look too clean. They offer some snacks that are overpriced, so you have to go somewhere else to get a good meal. No delivery to the rooms because of safety. I get it but maybe having some approved, already reliable vendors that are allowed up to the rooms to chose from would be good. Sometimes you just don't want to leave the room at all. POSITIVE: Very helpful and friendly staff. Clean lobby and great location. We would certainly visit again.

<Title>“Facilities and location are good - rent direct from owners”
<Content>We have been staying at ocean walk since first built. Have rented hotel directly rented Wyndham time shares and rented directly from private owners. Private owners are the way to go. One in particular is http://www.oceanwalk1.com/. Joe the manager is very responsive and has an inventory of 18 units with various configurations. The units are always clean, well maintained and priced reasonable. You also know exactly what unit you are renting. The complaints I have read about Wyndham rooms have never been experienced. The wlevator problems are exagerated. When a thunder storm xomes in quickly and everyone clears the beach I expect to wait for an elevator. The property has recently been painted outside and the pool was also updated. The roaming security people are comforting because they actually do challenge those who should not be there and try to maintain the security. This is the largest property complex in the heart of Daytona. The prices are reasonable for what you get. I you want high end move further north or south in the less populated areas.

<Title>“Awful! Awful! Awful!”
<Content>This place is a JOKE! Booked this hotel as a girls getaway. The photos on the website definitely misrepresents the rooms. Our room was EXTREMELY dirty. I have NEVER had to go to a hotel and ASK for a Vacuum Cleaner. I was deathly afraid to touch anything in the room. There was roaches crawling on the floors and in the fridge when we walked in. The floor did not appear to be vacuumed (seemingly in weeks). There were unidentifiable red spots on the pillows and the sheets had some black stains. The faucet in the tub never stopped running and the faucet on the sink in the bathroom was stopped up. The patio door would not open, plus the latch on the door was broken. We were not expecting the RITZ however, we did expect to be placed in a CLEAN room. We spoke with management and requested that someone simply clean the room. They stated they could not because it was an individually owned condo, they could not have the WYNDHAMs staff go inside. HOW INSANE IS THAT? The room is INSIDE a WYNDHAM hotel. The WYNDHAM staff gave us the key. THE WYNDHAM staff answers when dialing from the room. They gave us the number to the management company for the rooms we were in......no answer (even after having left several messages). If we had rented a car, we would have simply slept in the car. We arrived at this property at about 8 pm and stayed up til 2:30 in the morning searching (mostly in the lobby) for a new place to stay while in Daytona. We promptly left the property as soon as we found a more suitable location. If you value Cleanliness in any shape, form, or fashion......DO NOT STAY HERE.

<Title>“Bad experience at Wyndham Ocean Walk”
<Content>We checked into the Wyndham Ocean Walk in Daytona Beach on July 19th. We had a wonderful 2 day vacation and a beautiful oceanfront room. When we checked in we were asked if we would like to go to a time share presentation and accepted. They scheduled it for July 21, the day we checked out and gave us a late checkout. Our presentation was 3hours and 15 minutes instead of the 90 minutes they said it would be. While on tour of the resort our sales rep stopped at the front desk and reconfirmed our late check out. When we arrived at our room, after the presentaion, our keys had expired and we had to go back to the front desk and have them remade. Upon arrival back to our room it had been cleaned and everything we had left in it was gone. Before the presentation my husband had taken most of our belongings to the car so we would only have to make 1 trip after the presentation. I had left my bag, which had every thing I had brought with me, including make up, hair blower, curling iron, swim suit etc. etc. etc. We contacted security, housekeeping and night mgr. After 3hours of looking for our belongings they said housekeeping had thrown my bag down the trash shoot. There was also sunglasses and a thermos cup left on the kitchen counter that were never taken to lost and found. They said not to worry, I would be taken care of. The only time they communicated with me was if I called or e-mailed them. Each time I did they responded in a timely manner. After 2 weeks of waiting for a compensation check I threatened to come to the hotel and meet face to face with the Mgr. They immediately sent out, not a compensation check but a Wyndham Gift Card in the amount I had listed for the things I had lost. This was just another inconvienience because most of the things that were taken from me had to be replaced immediately and I can't use the gift card to pay for my purchases. Nothing was offered as far as a stay at the Wyndham for our inconvienience or that we might have a more positive experience. Just a note saying sorry this happened. Customer service is very important to me. I will stay at a 3 star hotel before a 5 star hotel if the customer service is better. I am very disappointed with how this was handled by the Wyndham and feel their customer service would rate 1 star. GBye

<Title>“Beautiful Grounds - Inside Filthy”
<Content>Was in South Tower, one bedroom condo. The condo was very nice, but FILTHY. We had to wear our shoes inside our room at all times because if you did not, the bottom of your feet were black with dirt from the carpet. In the bathroom, the white cabinets had dirt streaks all over them and I actually purchased bleach so that I could clean the shower myself. It was full of mold and mildew and the floor of the shower was NOT cleaned after the previous renters. I know this because when I cleaned the shower myself, the floor got clean after I scrubbed it. The pull-out mattress was torn and I had to wash the extra blanket myself due to an odor on it. The king size bed needs to be replaced. You are actually sleeping on a slope on either side. The outside was beautiful. They could have more staff to clean up the trash around the pool areas, but overall the grounds are great. The pools never felt crowded. Their section of beach is also beautiful. If you are dealing with any of the staff at the activity center, avoid Amy. I had to deal with her on two separate occasions, and she is very unpleasant.

<Title>“Timeshare company accused groupon of false advertising.”
<Content>Booked with groupon for the 3 night special with one of the owners in time share south tower called inside booking or something like that. They were not part of wyndham. Did not receive what i booked. We were suposed to have a one bedroom king bed deluxe with whirlpool tub. We got an inside room with no outside view, no balcony, two small double beds, tiny kitchenette and a tons of broken things. When i went to website of bookdaytona I found we received a room that i could have booked for alot cheaper than the groupon so we didnt get what we paid for. Not to mention wallpaper falling off walls, old tvs 19 in which remotes did not work, hair all over bathroom and no whirlpool tub. I called the company inside booking? And they had the nerve to blame it all on groupon. I dont believe groupon pulled the room description out of thin air. They preceded to tell me that there was nothing they could do and did not have any other rooms to move us to. The resort was nice though except the room. Loved the location and the pool area was awesome. Indeed could not find seating easily. It is a place for families people! You can see that in the tripadvisor pics. Did wait 20 or so mins to check in. No prob with parking. Maybe waited.5 mins for elevators. Just make sure to book with wyndham in the north tower.

<Title>“Family Vacation”
<Content>I just returned from a family vacation from Ocean Walk. I rented 2 condos thru RCI. I called Ocean Walk in advance hoping to get the condos close together plus we had an ocean view! They couldn't guarentee it but when we arrived we were fortunate to be able to have them side by side. The week started off good. The condos were clean but were minus some wash clothes but they delivered them after we told them very quickly. Everyone was very nice and helpful. The hotel is in the center of all the action and we never lacked for something to do and was able to walk to everything. I recommend the welcome information meeting to find out info about the area and some great coupons. The cons as most people complain about were there were rarely a pool chair available but ok with me since I am more of a beach person anyway. If you came in late from an outing you could be out a parking spot and have to pay to park across the street. The elevator situation is annoying but I never had to wait that long and I quickly found the stairs instead of using the elevator. The last annoying thing is I was in the south tower by the restraunts and bars and could hear the music until 2 am. It didn't bother me but it did my husband. Would any of these things keep me from coming back, heck no, I would go again tomorrow if I could. I can safely say my whole family from age 52 to 6years old had a wonderful time and would go back.

<Title>“7 years later...”
<Content>Our family of 4 has been staying here every year for 7 years... We started when my youngest was 4. Why?? THE BEACH!!! The kids can boogie board, skim board, surf and this year paddle board without my husband or I afraid of them being dragged out into the ocean by riptides or only being able to go out in the water 10 feet from shore. This area offers such great outdoor options and the beach is one of the cleanest and safest(lifeguard right in front of the resort) we have been to. As far as the Ocean Walk, it is good...there are a few things they could work on and over the 7 years, they have kept it up considering the number of guests that stay here, but it is showing wear. As to some of the complaints I read, when PARENTS don't watch their kids how is that the hotels fault? We have seen them talk to parents and ask them to STAY with their kids and the parents get all upset...this is not a daycare facility. We are here during high season and the pools are not full...lazy river is busy, but if we wanted a pool and lazy river, we would have gone to a water park not paid to have a room on the ocean...Next... security/staff... does remove towels...if you wake up and watch the woman with her 8 towels run to the chairs cover them up then leave, you would understand first, why the security moves towels, second, if security is busy chasing down that woman ( who is the same one not watching her 7 kids) she is taking up 8 prime spots and then if you wanted to be by a pool (and not the ocean?) all the chairs appear to be full...then she doesn't come back to the pool until after lunch...sometime staff gets short, but i would too if i had to deal with some of the people and their actions...we fly with a big duffel bag with our own lawnchairs, boogie boards and skim boards, take them to the beach kick back and ENJOY ourselves!! There is LOTS of open space! To conclude, if you are looking for 5 star and want to be waited on hand and foot, this is NOT the place...if you are looking for a FANTASTIC beach location with kids...we would recommend the Ocean Walk. FYI...we are owners with Wyndham and book thru them, no bugs, clean room, all dishes there and everything works...can't talk to rooms not managed by Wyndham or reserved thru 3rd parties.

<Content>We were a bit nervous after reading the reviews but had a great time at this resort. The pool is awsome and kids loved it. The rooms were comfortable and pleasant. The only issues were having to wait about 20 min.for the front desk to answer my phone call, not enough pool chairs, and parking can be tough during peak times. Overall a nice week.

<Title>“Don't let the pictures fool you”
<Content>I purchased a groupon for a 3 night stay at the Ocean Walk Villas for a girl’s trip. I was excited and when we drove up to the outside of the property it was very nice. Well, the young lady behind the check in desk overly expressed to me as I was checking in that there are 2 parts to this property. One part is owned and managed by the Wyndam and the other is privately managed. She began to tell me what I could expect in that private room. Their staff could not come in a clean it, if there are things wrong with the room they would not be able to service it, if I needed something they could not assist, they were not even allowed to go into the room because it was considered private property. Well, I was thinking okay, it shouldn't be a big deal. Well low and behold when we walked into the room we immediately began to see why she made a point to tell me this over and over again. To start the critters (roaches and other bugs) met us at the door, the floor was not vacuumed (bedroom nor the living area), bugs were in the refrigerator, there was water sitting in the bottom of the dishwasher, the water in the bathtub constantly ran, the water would not drain in the bathroom sink, the latch on the sliding glass door on the balcony was broken and we could not open the door, there was visible dust in this place like you would not believe, there was a layer of dust on the couch that we could see and then when you sat on the couch the dust would puff out like Pig Pin from Charley Brown. Then when we pulled the sheets back on the bed one of the pillows had unidentifiable red spots on it. Well, needless to say we went back downstairs to let the front desk now that this was not acceptable and they needed to do something. Well, all we got was, we can't do anything because it is not our property. I told them your room or not there should be a standard because this property is representative of the facility as a whole. We were able to use a vacuum to at least clean the floor and we got some clean sheets. After staying up until 2:00 am to find another place to stay in we wrapped up in the clean sheets and pillow cases to make it through the next couple of hours. This was a horrible experience at this facility and although the grounds with the pool may look nice and might be enjoyable this is no where I would want anyone to stay. Thanks to the dust my friend and I both ended up with our allergies flaring up. Although the front desk staff tried to say that this room was private property, we spoke to several other guest that complained about their rooms also. One man was complaining while we were checking out. Stay at your own risk, as for me I pass. We were able to find another property at Ormond Beach that was 200% better.

And the icing on the cake... ANTS IN OUR ROOM staff didn't care about any of our complaints. We left early, cut our losses and paid to stay elsewhere at a third of the price for so much better service and rooms!

<Title>“Family Fun but crowded”
<Content>We rented a two bedroom, two bathroom condo from Time Share Kahuna. This company is a 5 out of 5. Easy to work with. The condo was clean and set up well. The resort is great for families, especially teens. The pools were clean and fun, mini golf is available, and the teens loved hanging out next door at Starbucks in the morning. Pay for oceanfront, it is worth it. There were fun activities planned everyday for all ages. Pool chairs are very difficult to obtain but, the pool security guards will move stuff off of idle chairs if you ask. Elevators are semi slow, just plan accordingly. We purchased beach chairs at the local Target and actually checked them on our Southwest flight and brought them home. It's a busy place, but we all had a good time. Every employee we spoke to in person was polite and helpful. Not so much on the phone, hence the 4 rating.

<Title>“Make certain of your room when you check in”
<Content>This hotel is typical of any housing in a resort area. They try to hold onto the choice rooms and bump the prices up. We booked 6 weeks before our trip, only to get to our room after check-in and find they had "downgraded" us. Yeah ... right. We went back to the lobby and I demanded the room we had booked. They said it wasn't available, so I asked for my money back in order to move to another hotel. It was totally unacceptable. They talked to the "manager" and eventually gave us the room that we had booked. WHY DIDN'T THEY DO THIS INITIALLY? ... BECAUSE THEY WERE HOLDING ONTO IT TO SELL IT FOR 3 TIMES THE PRICE !!!!!! How do we know this? Because when they were talking to the "manager" about out room, we pulled out a computer and checked availability. YEP, sure enough, there 2 rooms like the deluxe oceanfront we had booked that were available ... but FOR 3 TIMES THE ORIGINAL PRICE. In a nutshell ... if you stay here, the hotel is fine. Food was "okay". Didn't use any of the services so can't comment on that. Beach was nice as well as the pool areas. BUT, if you book here, book ONLY through the hotel. Do NOT use a booking service like hotels.com, etc because then they have an excuse to do whatever they want to you and you have no recourse. They won't refund your money because (according to them) they didn't get your money yet. Fortunately, we booked directly with the hotel and had some leverage when they tried to take advantage of us. Would I stay here again? Not a chance in HELL. And I'll tell everyone who asks about their underhanded business tactics. Stay someplace else is my advice.

<Title>“Second Stay”
<Content>We stayed here in 2009 and had a good experience. After reading the current reviews we were scared to come back. We were there July 18-July 23, 2012. We knew that there was no maid service but we heard several guests complaining. Future guests...This is not a hotel so there is no maid service. There are two towers with seperate elevators. It can take a little bit to get an elevator and this can be frustrationg however there were times we never waited. We checked in at 3pm and our room was ready and there was no wait but at 4pm there can be a huge line. We love the beach access and love the pools. We like the security on the pool deck. We wish they still had the misters between the hotel and the beach to clean off your feet. The showers were full of sand and we think the misters helped with this problem. We like the free parking at the resort. We like the access to the shopping and restaurants. We have three teenagers who would love to come back. The inside of the building was being painted and looked nice however they need to work on the rooms to get the bathrooms up to date and mold free. We stayed in 1313. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom needs an update and the showers need to be mold free! The bathrooms were our biggest complaint. We did have an amazing time!

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>We were greeted by the gentleman who told us were to park, and he said "If you can find one" When I asked for directions, I was not offered a map but just told where to go.The gentleman at the front desk was very nice and helpful (he is a music director at his church).My suggestion is to learn how to take care of tile cleaning. There is a difference between moping and cleaning. Especially the bathroom grout. There is a grout cleaner out there that can take away grime.This is not a place I would invest my money in a time share, things are not kept up the way they should be. Security around the pool is crazy as far as removing toweling from chairs.......silly. Great location and lots to offer for the kids, which is why we were there but would we return, only if they can get their act together and learn how to run a clean and efficient hotel.

<Title>“What do you expect in prime vacation time”
<Content>Very nice place but yes it can be busy at times. It's a huge place so getting an elevator if it starts raining is a pain but what do expect when everyone runs at the same time. Check in at 4 can be a mess so plan on waiting until later or you will stand in line until later anyway. Pools and ocean front is great for kids. Much better in early September but July isn't horrible.

<Title>“Loved the room and the staff!”
<Content>If you come in July the only downfall is the parking deck is always full and it's sooo packed. We loved this hotel and have stayed in several different ones in this area. This is by far the best for kids but just overcrowded . We will come in October next time because the elevator waits and parking are just Ahh! But the Hotel is very very clean!!!

<Title>“Samone Says-Beach Front Living”
<Content>Don't be discouraged by the reviews you've read if anything they should advise you to plan better. I arrived at the Wyndham Ocean Walk late in the evening to avoid that lines I read about, I was able to get checked into my room in under 5 minutes, a "Walk on the Beach." We were accommodated in a one bedroom ocean front suite that was more than I imagined. I can honestly say that I was terrified before we arrived, I read the reviews and thought to myself "SELF-you can find another hotel on the beach if you need too." BUT I will almost venture to say that the Ocean Walk was the best I saw on the beach...It is right next to the Hilton hotel which is HUGE but still not as Family oriented as the Ocean Walk. Our Room was suite 1602 A it was a handicap room with an Ocean Front View. The suite was clean, beach chic, and spacious! FYI Guys this is a FAMILY destination resort. So you will experience a lot of children and family. Don't be alarmed.....YES there is a line for the elevators just as there is traffic on the express way when you get off of work. No big deal, after the first day you'll know how to schedule you elevator rides! Your suite features a fully equipped kitchen so there is no need to complain about there not being any restaurants in the hotel. The Wyndham is attached to the Ocean Walk village and features many options for food or snacks. My favorite thing about this hotel was that I felt like I was home. I don't like to use the word cozy because people generally think small. The Wyndham Ocean walk was cozy in a grand type of way. I loved it! Initially I was bummed about the ocean walk not having a spa, but went to a few of the spa's at surrounding hotels and it was the ultimate relaxation. You can also see a videos floor plans and photos that I took here > http://bit.ly/R4XsuV

<Title>“Wonderful!!”
<Content>We exchanged through our timeshare and stayed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk for a week, Sunday to Sunday. We had two connecting units, which ment two bathrooms, bedrooms, pull out couches, washer and dryers,and kitchens. Each bedroom had a very comfy king size bed. Our unit overlooked the ocean. Love hearing the water rush upon the shore. The resort had two spacious outdoor pools, pus a pretty big kiddie pool and a lazy river. The lazy river could be crowded at times but it was still relaxing. There was also an indoor pool and weight room that were never used because people ran and walked on the beach! The outdoor mall that is attached to the resort was great! We ate at both Bubba Gumps and Sloppy Joes, liked Sloppy Joes better. The theatre in the mall ran all its show for $5 on Tuesdays. We saw two back-to back!! We had a marvelous time and will definately go back!!

<Title>“Only good thing was the Atlantic Ocean”
<Content>Many things wrong few good not great...elevators are ridiculous, waiting either going down to the beach, no room at the pool and forget the lazy river or coming back from the beach many guests pushing ahead so the didn't havebto wait. Come on four elevators for 25 floors! Parking good if you can park but don't leave because you won't have a place when you come back. Kitchen was only upgrade bed was so old it sagged in the middle at least six inches. We spent all night rolling into each other. Drain in bathbsink was stopped up. Ice maker didn't work and no one came to fix it after calling. Oh yes, check-in at four.. Come on everyone is trying to get to their room at the same time. Goodbthe view, the chair & umbrella rental were pleasant and accommodating (they were not run by Wyndam)

<Title>“Will not go back~!”
<Content>This is the second time we have visited the Wyndham. We are not spoiled adults as we have to save all year for a vacation. I wish we would have gone somewhere else. To begin, upon arrival we had to stand in a long line to check in. This took a little over an hour. We then had to go to yet another desk to schedule our "tour" of the facility. We DO NOT do this; you do not have to, but you do have to go through that line to receive your arm bands for the pool. After traveling all day, we were exhausted. We arrived at our room and discovered it was NOT an ocean room delux, which we had reservations for. I had called the Tuesday before our arrival date, and I was told that yes our reservations were in the system and our room was what we were down for. I was told to go back down to the reservation desk and they would help me. Well guess what? I had to stand in an hour long line AGAIN! We DID NOT get our ocean delux; we had to stay where we were and they stated they gave me a better room than what I had! We were NOT the only people they did this to. One owner had made reservations in December and he did not get his ocean delux. So many people we spoke to had this problem! They are screwing the owners over and putting "prospective" buyers in these rooms. We had rented our good friend's condo here, and they are trying to sell it. Our room was nice, but not what was reserved. We were on the Atlantic Avenue side. There are 25 floors for each tower and only 4 elevators! One could wait 20 mins. for one of these. We learned to ride up just to ride down to our floor! Everyone complained about this constantly the entire week we were there. Furthermore, they speak of the 3 hot tubs; good luck getting in them. They are filled with junior high students and younger. The pool is always crammed packed and not enough chairs to accommodate everyone. I am telling you it is packed! I teach school and I love my job, but I am definitely not going to back to this family resort! The kids overrun the facility, and of course the parents just let them run alll over. Don't go to Sloppy Joe's for drinks. There is a restaurant called Wings in the walk way and the drinks are $3 CHEAPER and better. Way overpriced! As far as location in Daytona, it is very convenient. I have been to Daytona a dozen times and from this location you can walk just about anywhere. Go to the movies on Tuesdays in the walk way because the cost is only $5. On Friday night the little amphtheatre has local bands that play. Take a short walk to the Oyster Pub; they have happy hour and fresh seafood. You can walk to Froggies and Boot Hill for some local good times. Facing toward the coast there is an IHOP about one and a half blocks north and also a convenient store. Make sure you go to the Deck Down Under. You would head south to the Dunlawton Bridge and go under the bridge not over it. You will see it to the left. it's a great place to eat and you can watch the dolphins feed in the canal. Good food and cold beer. All in all we did not let the room hinder our vacation, but very disappointed in their attitude toward us about that. There is a ton of stuff to enjoy in the Daytona Beach area! Just go enjoy your vacation, but I would recommend another resort besides this one!

<Content>Wanted to let you know that Apt 609 in Ocean Walk was perfect for our family and delivered exactly as you advertised. It is a great apt., complex and location. We saw some of the other places we were looking at and are very happy we picked Ocean Walk. You were very prompt and efficient in helping with our one question. There is a lot going on in this area for the kids. This is not true for other locations. We highly recommend you and your place. Thanks for a great time!

<Title>“Excellent place to stay!”
<Content>This resort was one of the nicest I have ever stayed in at Daytona. We were on the 18th floor with a great side view of the ocean. We ate breakfast on the balcony every morning and it was amazing. The two bedroom condo we stayed in was very clean and perfect. The amenities and being on the oceanfront was awesome! The shops and dining choices close by were great too. The pool areas and lazy river provided lots of great fun and relaxation too.

<Title>“Bad experience from the moment we arrived.”
<Content>We arrived for a nine days, eight night vacation/dance competition. We had a two bedroom ocean view reserved. After arriving on time we did get into our room without an issue. Once we waited the 20 minutes for the elevator (which was the first of many) We made it to our room and the dissapointment began. In one word DIRTY. The couches we had to put a towel on to sit. One of the showers was caked with mildew. The dryer had a huge handful of sand in it. We received a phone call at 7 am the first morning we were there asking if we have out welcome packet. Granted I appreciate the welcome but at 7 am?? We asked for blankets as all we had was a sheet, who uses the dirty comforters anyway. They arrived 27 hours later. The second bedroom had a window that looked out to the hallway. The very bright hallway. And the misfit mini blinds provided no privacy. There were no curtains just the mini blinds. The hotel was filthy, this included the filthy hallways, rooms, pool area, and the bathrooms in the lobby overflowed and that was apparent for days after. Including dryers for days on the floor. Our card was deactivated a day early and it took 35 minutes to reactivate it. And with that 35 it came with attitude. I have no idea why that happened. I would never stay there again a further more I have told everyone I know not to stay there. The very large dance studio my daughter is a part of they all felt the same. Everyone was miserable. Spend extra go to the Hitlon a block down the street. Believe me you will be glad you did!

<Title>“Great condo”
<Content>Ocean Walk at Daytona beach is lovely. It is a very nice resort. It has a lazy river, two indoor pools, two outdoor pools, several hot tubs and minature golf. We try to stay in the 2 bedroom city view, which is a large condo with a great view of the intercoastal waterway. The views from many of the ocean view rooms are blocked by neighboring notels. Having a full kitchen and washer/dryer is great. The only disappointment is that now almost all the activities offered by activities department involve a fee. Besides that the condo is nicely decorated and well kept. The minature golf in the resort is free, and there is at least one free movie a week. For us it is a very nice condo and it is wonderful to be on the beach.

<Title>“Surfs up for a great value!”
<Content>My family of 4 vacationed here for4 days a few weeks ago. I must say that the location of the hotel being right on the beach was what sold me on vacationing here. Check in was fast and unlike others who complained about check in, it did go smoothly for us. Our room was ready earlier than check in time. The hotel is a bit worn, but well maintained. Dont expect modern...but practical for families. The Pluses - hotel is right on the beach and next door to a small shopping center with movie theater and restaurants. A short walk to the pier and great views of the ocean(ask for a room with the ocean view...not all rooms have it) The rooms are great for a family. THe kitchen has all the amenities you would need for your stay...including blender and bake ware. Washer and Dryers are a big plus! Bathrooms are large, and beds were very comfortable. I even said the fold out sofa bed were unusually comfortable for my boys. THe pool area was great...the lazy river and the two pools are fun for the kids. We had some bad weather on our trip so the indoor pool was a sight for sore eyes. Great security and the beach area is wonderful. They inflate a large slide for kids to play on the beach. There are food trucks on the sand and a small board walk steps off the hotel. Love it! Minuses - We had to change rooms because the safe in our first room was broken. It took them close to 2 hours to resolve the matter. If you have a problem...dont call for asssitance on the phn...go to front desk and ask for manager right away to resolve your problem. I just think there is a shortage of staff for such a large resort. Upon check in you have to go to pick up your beach towels for your stay. They give you one towel per person for your entire visit. Now keep in mind...if you loose these towels your have to sign your life away. They expect you to wash and dry them for your stay there. Tip - bring your own. You can wash them everyday in washer if you have to. They say they have free wifi...but only in lobby area and business center. There is not much to eat on site. The elevators are always full and very slow. So be patient if you plan on staying here. They have 3 hot tubs. One was not working and the others had cold water. The hotel is a great value and great location if you are looking for a beach resort. The pool area is great for he kids. It is noisy so dont expect the peaceful bliss. Overall it was good vacation for a family...and would recommend the hotel for anyone with children. I would not suggest this hotel for a romantic escape.

<Title>“An Extreme Disappointment!”
<Content>Booked two rooms connecting because my parents who were staying with us are 75. Get there at 3 hotel is sold out. YES this was payed for and booked weeks ago. Called an hour before arrival and they said everything was fine, but they lied! Parents were put in a different tower alone. And once they waled in and sat down, the chair fell straight to the floor with myyou mother in it. The foot was broke. They didn't care! 2 hours later we finally get a room. Somehow now two rooms appear out of no where. This sucks! Never again. More pissed bc they dismissed us and didn't care in the least.

<Title>“Horrible service”
<Content>The resort is beautiful. The staff treated me horrible. From the beginning of the trip, only one staff member was at the desk and the wait was long. They gave me a room with one bed for three people and said 'you have a pull out couch' This was a $225 one bedroom suite. I had to argue for 30 minutes, with no manager available. Totally unacceptable. Every day I had issues. I was given no map or explaination of the site. The concierge is only available Sat thru Wed 9-4 pm. She woke me up the next day to tell me I had to come down to get my map. Then, when I finally got down there, she was out to lunch. Towels are hidden down in the basement with nowhere on the map to say where they are. I hailed the cleaning lady to show me. Then, when I got sick and said I had to go to the hospital and couldn't pack myself up...they said I had to check out because they were full. They didn't ask if I needed help to the hospital. When I finally asked where the hospital's were, the desk woman said' Oh, you need help?' Thank God for the concierge. He is the only kind one at this place.

<Content>This was my second year visiting this property during the month of June. It is always very busy and full of families and children. I travel alone. The staff does a great job ensuring the kids don't take over and disrupt other guests. Thr property is centrally located and within walking distance of most anything you would need. I also feel it is a great value for the price.

<Content>This resort has lots of amenities to keep you and your family entertained without having to drive. They have different adult activities every night and kid's activities every day. To save money we cooked breakfast and lunch in the condo and went out for dinner. The only complaint I had was that they only gave one parking pass per room even though we had a 3 bedroom condo.

<Title>“Wyndham Ocean Walk -- terrible and BEWARE”
<Content>I made my reservation in December 2011 for a June 2012 stay. When I got to the property, they couldn't guarantee the number of beds that I needed. I paid for an ocean view, one bedroom (expecting to get two double beds in the bedroom and a pull out couch in the living room). What they could give me was one double bed in the bedroom and a couch. Try sleeping 4 people in that arrangement. They moved me to an inside room -- beware. There aren't any windows -- well except one that looks into the hall. The hall light is on all night and the shades over the 'window' don't provide any shade. We could see out and people could see into our bedroom! Plus the light in the hall way was a bother when we were trying to sleep. Oh yeah --the kitchen! Well if you call a cupboard with 3 glasses, a drawer with 6 pieces of silverware, a stove that is crooked with four burners the size of a coffee cup a stove, well then there is a kitchen. The kitchen spanned a total of maybe 3 feet!. And one more thing... if you are needing to use the elevator (which most rooms do), plan to wait for 3 elevators to pass before you can get into one. That isn't just the day you check in (expect to wait 20 minutes to get an elevator on check in or check out days) every time we had to go up and down we had to let 3 elevators go by before there was room for us. My advice -- DO NOT stay at the Wyndham OCen Walk. It is crappy.

<Title>“Oceanfront disappointment”
<Content>My husband and I made our reservation many months ago as our son and family were staying there and we paid for and were confirmed for an ocean front room. Upon arrival before 4:30 on check in day we were informed there were no ocean front rooms available and they can not be guaranteed. We were given a room that they considered ocean view but what you mainly saw was Ocean Walk and the Hilton. We were very disappointed as we were paying for and were looking forward to being ocean front. Not sure we can trust Wyndham again. The beach, pool and location were fine.

<Title>“Wonderful view....”
<Content>We stayed at this location (south tower) for a dance competition in late June 2012. While our stay was mostly OK, there were several things amiss, mostly just annoying little things. Having read numerous reviews beforehand, I was a bit apprehensive as to what we would actually find upon checking in. Many reviewers cited mold in the bathroom, which we did not find. The general traffic areas in the elevators and areas around them were persistantly damp, however given the pool/beach traffic and the general humidity (it rained quite a bit ), doubt much can be done about this. Some of the positives are also negatives: the place is crawling with very young families with oodles of small kids--it is a great place for this, but starts to grate on your nerves a bit. Creates lots of elevator traffic and you wait forever. The decor is pretty outdated, really in need of some updating. No restaurant on site, only a little snack bar w/hot dogs, chips, etc. The bar appears to be nice, good drinks, nice place to hang out, drink specials were very reasonable ($2.00 beers). The garage is pretty well located, you have in/out privileges, so no having to tip a valet. Check out time is rather early, 10am, which is a pain if you are lugging around a lot of belongings, or have teens who are slow moving in the morning. Upon our arrival, we had NO towels. We requested and were brought the towels--one per person- pretty skimpy, however I didn't ask for additional, we made use of the dryer for damp ones. They do not replace, you are expected to launder your own, and they will provide extra detergent for that. There is no "maid" service, and not much in the way of cleaning supplies-could've used a broom (only had one of those push-sweepers) or spray cleaner. The kitchen was great, we tried to fix breakfast most days, a grocery store close by. Would have been nice to have been provided some salt and pepper shakers--no one wants to bring/buy this stuff. Having a washer/dryer was super--brought detergent from home. Nice to not have dirty clothes or wet towels. Beach towels are handed out extra, btw, also used for shower towels when we were short. The unit was unplugged--had to call maintenence guy to come move it and plug the thing in, though. We booked a one-BR ocean front--super, super view, loved the balcony. The sofa sleeper (cheap, 2 or 3 in mattress) basically is not useable--my daughter slept on it one night then moved to the xtra bed-- my husb and I crammed in the other double. Not much closet or drawer space--a must for a week long stay with dance costumes. Also the owner's belongings were locked in a large cabinet in the bedroom, taking up more of the already cramped space. Get the feeling there's lots of partying misbehaving--security hovers around the pool, harrasing people to show their plastic armbands (which we were not told about)--I get why the need is there, but really, we were a bunch of adults, 45-60 years or so, how much trouble could we have caused??? Still had a good time, beach is great, lots of decent, fun restaurants nearby. Prob would not stay here on my own--its def. not a HOTEL, its an ownership property, and they do try to rope you in to hear the sales bit.

<Title>“Very few things, ruined the whole trip”
<Content>We stayed here the end of April 2012 for the Florida States AAU Gymnastics. When I booked this hotel, I was soooo excited. It seemed like the perfect mini vacation for my family. When we got there, we checked in and went to our room. It was awesome and overlooked the beach. They had 2 pools and a lazy river. We immediately got dressed and headed down to swim. It was what seemed like the perfect start of a perfect weekend. We had rooms side by side with my in-laws. When they got there to check in, they got their room key. When they went up, they found there room was not cleaned. Since it was around 4/5PM in the evening, housekeeping could not get their room ready, so they were moved, to a different floor. One of the TVs was missing a remote and when I asked about it, they said there may not be an extra one. I told them, no biggy and left it at that. My husband was more concerned about reporting it so we would not be charged for a missing remote. As I was taking a shower, I noticed a TON of mildew/mold on the inside of the shower curtain. It was not just a day or two amount. It was weeks. It was covered from top to bottom and beyond gross. I pushed it out to the outside of the tub so we would not touch it. After all 4 of us took showers, there was a ton of water on the floor since the curtain was now on the outside. I now felt like the whole room was dirty, so I would not let anyone use any of the dishes in the room. When we came back from dinner, I asked for a new shower curtain along with towels to dry up the floor to be brought to my room. (I also asked for a remote because by then, I was curious exactly what type of customer service they had). She said everything would be sent up soon. About 15 minutes later, someone came with a remote. Then about 45 mins later, I called down as no shower curtain or towels has been brought up. We had to be up early for the gymnastics meet and I was getting upset by then. Finally a lady came. I answered the door, and she handed me the shower curtain. I asked her if she was going to hang it, she gave me a big sign, a rolled eyes and said "I guess". I explained there was no way I was going to touch it (by now, I was pissed) and I showed it to her. She kinda gasped and then understood why I refused to change it. She did apologize. I asked her where the extra towels were, and she said she had not been asked to bring me any. She would be back with towels. She never returned. I went to bed. The rest of the stay was just "okay". Unfortunally, it was ruined by what had happened the day before. It should have been great. We did have fun, they have a ton of great things to offer. But my frustration from the day before and how dirty I felt the room was, really really ruined it. A few days later, I called and asked to speak to a manager. The one on duty was busy so they gave me a voicemail. I never received a phone call back. About a week later, I called again and asked for the actual hotel manager. I was told there was a bunch of people in from corporate and the manager could not come to the phone but if I left a message, I would get a call back. Maybe not that day because of the meeting, but I would. I never did. I was going to go directly to corporate, but I have not yet. Very disappointed as over all, I should be able to give it a great rating. But as a said, a few things (HUGE things) really ruined. it.

<Title>“Nice vacation rental”
<Content>This is a nice place. It is not a five star hotel. So, if that is what you want, dont stay here. Most of the other reviews are right on. Although, I had a very nice experience at the front desk and the pool area is really cool. Chairs are prime property. When the sun goes behind the bldg, it is all shade. That is a bonus. It could use updating, but i saw people painting and cleaning in the common areas daily. Our bed was awful hard, but i am spoiled because i have a really nice mattress at home. It is what it is. Some are owned, so the decor is whatever they pick. My only problem was the mold growing on/in the lazy river. Bring your own beach towels and laundry soap. I would stay again.

<Title>“Great location, nice place”
<Content>You can't beat the location, staff was very helpful. We stayed in a one room condo, ocean view. Only issue is when you stay in the South tower where the properties are owned by individuals, you don't have wifi in the room (not for free or to buy) but it is available in the lobby.

<Title>“Pleasantly Surprised - A very nice stay & a lovely beach.”
<Content>After reading some reviews here, I was quite nervous about what I would encounter upon check in. Check in was a breeze. Less than 5 minutes & I was parking the car. (Full Disclosure: After a traffic nightmare, we were nearly two hours late, so that may very well account for my easy check in) As luck would have it, we were placed on the 19th floor of the south tower. This is the top floor of that building, so no pesky footsteps above us. The room was clean & spacious. I had requested two doubles & received one king bed, but that was not a deal breaker. The bed was a bit too hard for my taste, but there were plenty of pillows. The view from the balcony was breathtaking! I could have sat there staring out at the sea for hours...and the first night, I did. The kitchen was well stocked with all the necessary items needed to prepare meals. The living space was quite comfortable & my daughter enjoyed the large flat screen for morning cartoons before hitting the pool & beach. Now, the pool area was very nice, with the exception of several small areas with broken concrete surrounded by caution tape. For what is charged to stay at this resort, there are no excuses for these oversights & they should be repaired posthaste. Because I do not enjoy fighting to the death over lounge chairs on the pool deck, I spent most of my time on the beach. The chair situation at the pool is totally out of control. Plus, they allow smoking poolside and I don't enjoy second hand smoke while sunbathing. None of this mattered once I was on the beach. Once night fell & my daughter was sleeping, we enjoyed sitting on the balcony & listening to the surf. There were several groups of young adults staying a few floors below us. They were having a great time, playing guitars & singing, and were quite good. This didn't bother us at all, but I know some people would not appreciate the show interfering with their serenity. So, book this resort knowing that there is a significant amount of partying & alcohol consumption that may happen in your general vicinity. All in all, we had a great time here. Our room was comfortable & clean, if not luxurious. Do not expect soft beds with high end bedding. Knowing all of this, should we choose to return to Daytona Beach, we will most likely stay at Wyndham Oceanwalk Resort again, provided we were able to stay on one of the uppermost floors with a large balcony because the noise level & partying would make our stay in a lower level room too noisy & disruptive.

<Title>“Great place to stay!!”
<Content>We stayed in a two bedroom condo and loved everything about it. We had 4 children with us ages 4 and under and they loved the kids aquatic area. The staff were all very friendly and did everything they could to make our stay enjoyable. The hotel had a wheelchair that we were able to use all week for my grandmother. They also locked up our cargo carrier since it wouldn't fit in the parking garage! I do have just one complaint. I don't like the fact that they only allow one car to park in their garage per reservation. We had 2 cars for our room since everybody wouldn't fit in one car. Only one car could park in the hotel's garage and the other one had to park across the street for a fee. Other than that minor thing the place was great!! Would definately stay there again!!

<Title>“Aweful Management!!!”
<Content>I booked a 1 bedroom, oceanfront condo at Wyndam Oceanwalk. I gave them my credit card number and got a confirmation number. We called on our way to the resort to let them know we were checking in late and what kind of room we were getting. When we arrived, 20 mins after calling, we were told that the room we booked was not available. They wanted to put us in a "studio" which was the size of a shoebox and was not oceanfront. Our balcony faced another building looking directly into everyone's rooms. NOT a nice view!! The "studio" was literally 2 beds with walking space around them. We have two children and would have been extremely uncomfortable in that small room. On top of all that craziness, the "studio" was only $50.00 less than the 1 bedroom oceanfront. We were given our money back and we went home, I believe they should have at least offered us a 1 bedroom oceanfront room for the following weekend free, but they did not seem affected by the fact that we were very upset. I will not be staying here again.

<Title>“Average”
<Content>Stayed here last week. The good: *The hotel sits right on the beach and all units have an ocean view. Great for watching the sunrise. *Lots of resort activities for kids (pool, arcade, minigolf) on-site. *Lots of nearby fun on the boardwalk. *Easy access to the beach. We actually saw a dolphin darting by! *Kitchens in every unit. The Bad: *The hotel brochure said smoking in the units wasn't allowed, but apparently not so for the balconies. Some people smoked on the balconies. So, getting a non-smoking room doesn't necessarily prevent exposure to smoke. *High presence of security staff near the pool. *Limitations on pool towel usage. We were allotted two each for our 3 day stay. Be clear, even if you return the towels, you DON'T get any more ever! You are expected to wash them and use them for your entire stay. *Very crowded pool. Never found a poolside lounge chair during our entire stay (you need to go before 8am). I usually threw our towels on nearby pool equipment. *Early checkout time: 10am. In defense of this hotel, beach hotels are often difficult to maintain & this one is no exception. It felt a tad bit rundown. Cheesy decor in some of the units, tired looking facilities. But it wasn't terrible.

<Title>“Nice”
<Content>We loved the location and could walk to both dining and entertainment most of the time. Beach front view was fabulous, we rented chairs and bikes several times right out front. Having several pools and the lazy river was great. The staff was very nice and helpful but made it clear right away that this is not a hotel, it is a timeshare. The only complaint would be the elevators, they were very slow and crowded, they should have put in two or three times as many.

<Title>“Doesn't live up to our experience at Wyndham in Myrtle!”
<Content>Their pool area & slide are really good if you have kids. One of the valets was really helpful when we were trying to check in and temporarily supplied us w/ a foam cooler to keep our food items cold. Location is definitely convenient to some shopping, restaurants & amusements, but for us the area was too congested. We won't be back to this location. Rooms were obviously last updated a long time ago. We rented a 1BR condo for 2 nights, and that was enough. You don't necessarily get what you book. i.e. There were 4 of us (2 adults, 2 kids) & we expected 2 queen beds in the BR, but ended up with 1 King. The pull-out bed was of course not fit for sleeping on. I asked and they confirmed in guest svcs that they supply NO face washcloths!?! The kitchen area was tiny, and cookware & dishes were pretty sparse. The am sun really heated up the main area through the OLD & hard to open sliding glass doors (definitely need updating!) 2 OF THE 3 light bulbs over the bathroom vanity/sink were out. A tip: Anyone interested in going to that general area should check out South Daytona or Ormond Beach for a little less hubbub!

<Title>“Nice beach”
<Content>Beach front view was great. Everyone was friendly and the room was nice. It was convenient getting over to the Beachwalk Restaurants and shops. However we thought it was very loud even after 11pm. We also grew board with the surroundings quickly and ventured out often. Tia cori's (Mexican) and Don Vitos (Italian) both had good local food. If you like loud in your face vacation then you should go. Cost was 1,300 for a one bedroom ocean front for a week in early June. We liked it ok..but not my style. We won't be returning. Kinda prefer a smaller less commercialized location. But we kinda did this vaca as a changeup.

Went back to the office & was told ( in a very nasty way) that's not our fault it is housekeeping's job! I asked for the manager & when she came out very rudely said "what is your problem?" After I quickly put her in line I was given a new set of keys. That new location was nice, however first impressions are everything!

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>In making my reservation two months in advance and requesting a ocean front 2 bedroom suite. I was extremely disappointed to find out upon check in that my continued request for ocean front was not met. I was informed that my request needed to be inquired the morning of arrival. My daughter lives in Daytona Beach, and stoped by the hotel the day before, the morning of and requested several times for an ocean front view. I rented from your resort as a graduation gift for my granddaughter and my family as a reunion. I have never received such a run around when requesting a reservation. In spending a substantial amount of money for an ocean front room and receiving a ocean view of the roof top of ocean walk was not what I had anticipated. I can only hope that other customers do not receive this treatment.

<Title>“Great location, Great grounds, sad excuse for a Wyndham!”
<Content>My family and I stayed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk June 2nd through June 8th. Our rooms were nice- the only complaints there would be is that they separated our party of 12. 2 rooms side by side one room with no balcony 4 floors down and I must mention the room with no balcony is similar to a dungeon. Also, you must launder your own towels and they only supply you with the bare minimal and gave us not even one wash cloth. There was absolutely no room service- and when we requested toilet paper the person at the service desk acted as if it were inconvenient for him. I believe this issue ties right in to the awful customer service. And I do mean AWFUL! Most reviews are right on point as they are mentioning the god awful elevator situation and poor customer service. The grounds are very nice, our rooms were clean, up to date, and roomy. This is a large hotel, with lots of families with young children which makes the pool caotic. And I would definitely advise trying to check in early or wait a few hours after 4! That situation is a nightmare!! As I have stayed at many wyndhams and been treated very well I assumed this Wyndham would be no different- I was very wrong. If this hotel would get new staff, more elevators, and possibly stager their check in and out times it would help a lot. Our vacation was not ruined, but we will DEFINTELY NEVER stay here again!!

Need to spend some money on getting more elevators to accomodate the amount of customers being there are 24 floors in one tower. Very nice and helpful staff. Perfect location, free parking and internet service, lots of things to do in resort and nearby, good price.

<Content>We stayed in the North Tower, and it was a great experience. The rooms were clean and freshly painted. This was our first time staying here and upon a recommendation from some friends, we requested the North Tower because it is the newer of the two towers. With the beach, several pools, and the location, it was a very good experience.

<Content>do not stay here! this place was horrible. we go to check in at 1:30 and they said it would be a couple of hours until the room was ready we said that's fine we will walk around and look in all the shops so we were at the first shop not even 10 mins later and they called the phone saying the room was ready. we went to the room and when we walked in the room it smelt so bad it hit us all like a wall it was nasty. we were putting our luggage in the room and we had a 3 bedroom suite in the one bedroom we put luggage in there was something on the wall what appeared to be vomit or something and it was all over the wall. then walk out into the living room and the one chair had sand all over it we brushed that off but it was very noticeable if the maid cleaned. there was a pile of chewed gum in the middle of the living room! the pillows they used for decorations had a big tear in it. the shower door was broken and fell off while someone was showering. the hairdryer was bolted onto the wall and while someone turned it on it sparked and started to smoke so we turned that off. we were making food and turned the vent on so there wasn't smoke and the vent cover came off as soon as we turned it on and landed in our food that we had to throw away. the balcony was disgusting. the beds were horrible there was springs coming through the bed. the couch pull out bed the corner was broke on it so we had to use a pillow to keep it up so someone didn't break their ankle. This place was horrible we went down and complained and all they did for us was gave us a 30 gift card to use in their resort! this place is horrible do not stay here there is a hilton right next door go there!

<Title>“Bad management makes for a lousy weekend!”
<Content>Wow...where do I begin? Upon arrival and check in, we find out that our room is not an ocean view room which was what we had reserved. Of course there weren't other rooms available so we were stuck with a room with a window that faced the interior hallway, which meant guests walking down the hallway could see right in. We felt like animals on display at the zoo. The entire night wa spent listening to kids and teens running and yelling up and down the hall. In the morning I noticed there was no coffee maker-an amenity listed in the room description. So I picked up the room phone to call downstairs, but it wasn't working! 20 minutes later, using my cell phone, I finally got thru to the hotel. I asked them to bring up a coffee maker and send a maintenance worker to chec the phone. A man came and said it was the phone line and it was an ATandT problem, and they probably won't come out to fix it Bc it was a holiday weekend. An hour later still no coffee maker so I had to go out into the hallway and use the phone near the elevator to call downstairs. I was told they ran out of coffee makers and I couldn't get one. As a consolation, the woman offered to bring us coffees from the restaurant and she did. Now off to the pool! When we arrive the place is swarming with guests and not a empty chair to be found. So we decide to go down to the beach. But first we need towels so we head back into the hotel for them and found out that they've run out of those too! They have no alternative for the guests but to go back up to our room and use the bath towels and keep checking back every hour or so for the next towel delivery. Well we did as we were told for the next five hours, but each time we did, they always said they ran out again. (mind you there was a huge bin of dirty towels sitting in the hall all day - no one rolled it away to wash them, though ). As we ended our weekend we still had no coffee maker, a simple request , a broken phone, and i had to continuously rewash our bath towels daily. I will NEVER return to this resort, solely due to the poor service. The hotel is ill-equipped to handle a full house of guests on a holiday weekend. No one knows how to resolve minor issues at all (come on, couldn't someone make a run to a local Walmart and buy a dam coffee maker?? Housekeeping needs to devise a better plan to provide basic pool towels to guests. And if there aren't enough pool chairs to accommodate guests, the hotel should at least provide more chairs along the beachfront so there is enough space for all. My suggestion to those who still want to go: be prepared or be disappointed. Bring your own towels and basic room supplies because the staff won't do a damn thing to help you.

<Title>“Wyndham Ocean Walk was a great choice”
<Content>As soon as school ended, my family decided we needed a little R and R, so we traveled to Dayton for a few beach days. We chose to stay at the Wyndham Ocean Walk and were very pleased with our decision. The Ocean Walk was well situated on Daytona with a driveless strip of beach ajacent to the boardwalk with many restaurants, a movie theatre and shopping. We chose a one-bedroom condo, and it was spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable, and we had a great view of the beachfront. Unfortunately, just as we arrived so did tropical storm Beryl. We tried not to let it put a damper on our trip. There were breaks in the weather where we could go down to the beach and were even able to get some sun. We found the Ocean Walk met or exceeded our expectations in many ways. We will stay there again on futures trips. It was clean, comfortable and had a great location. Just what you need for a beach stay regardless of the weather.

<Title>“5 STARS! Excellent Place to Stay!!!”
<Content>After reading the recent Wyndham reviews for weeks upon weeks I was quite nervous to stay at this resort. I came in fearing the worst! …. My family checked in Memorial Day (May 28th, 2012, Monday) at 4:00pm. Check in literally only took 5 minutes!! We were directed to the 6th floor in the South tower (which I’ve read is the oldest tower and the north is better) since the North tower only houses 2-3 bedrooms we had to stick with the south tower (which made me nervous as to what to expect based on reviews). As we entered our one bedroom oceanfront room we found that not only was the room clean, well lit, colorful, bright with a beautiful view… we also found everything worked included the dishwasher, fridge, air conditioner, and washer and dryer. The staff was very friendly, they brought us extra toilet paper, towels, and trash bags. I’m not sure why people say the elevators by the rooms will drive you crazy because there weren’t any rooms near the elevators that are not the way it’s designed! There is music playing outside by the pool area but it isn’t loud enough to bother anyone nor does it play all night. All pools were clean and the security is very attentive to kids breaking the rules. We stayed for one week (Monday-Saturday) we found that many guest will arrive at the pool early to reserve a chair and not use them but we always managed to find an empty chair. If you have any problems what so ever always ask a staff member, that is what they are there for. I was very pleased with this resort and if we ever return this is where we will be staying. I would like to thank everyone at Wyndham Ocean walk Resort for making our stay so pleasant. My daughter absolutely loved the baby pool; we couldn’t pull her away from it!!

<Title>“Great outdoor facility, rooms and service OK”
<Content>Let me start off by saying, if I am going to Daytona Beach (the redneck riviera in my opinion) you have to lower your expectations by about one notch. That being noted, we have stayed twice at this place. What brings us back is the spectacular pool's, lazy river, splash area, and access to the beach. Its also nice being attached to the only decent restaurants on the beach. If you have a family, this is a perfect place to spend a long weekend. Inside the rooms, I found them a dirty for the price point. Dont get me wrong, they were not disgusting, just showed the signs of a heavily used, but not extremely well maintained place. It was nice having the fridge, coffee maker, washer/dryer etc. The A/C was a bit loud. Also, trying to get extra room towels was a pain, even though we had registered 5 guests. They had no wash clothes. I absolutely hate their pool towel process. You get one set of towels that you use for the entire stay. Most places have a cabanna setup that you get fresh towels every day. Once again, you are going to this location for the pool and the beaches, so I would recommend staying here.

<Title>“Won't Stay Again”
<Content>The facilities/amenities were wonderful but I think that all the staff is clueless in customer service. When I made the reservation, I requested to have the lowest floor possible-between 1-4 was optimal. When we arrived they put us on the 21st floor and said that they didn’t even have that note in the reservation that we had a requested the lower floors. I told the lady I wanted to speak to the manager on duty but conveniently “they were in a meeting.” I waited for about an hour before someone spoke to me and then the manager says that the 2B/2B condos like I had reserved are on the 21st floor and up. When I called to make reservations no one told me that. Manager stated that the reservationists are not on site…I told her that regardless of where they are located they should know what is on what floor. Manager then said she could move us to a timeshare but it would cost more. After much arguing about it being their fault, she said all she could do was place us in a 1B/1B for one night and then to a 2B/2B timeshare the rest of our stay for no extra cost. She stated that she was really helping us out by going this extra mile…especially to cram 4 people into a one bed one bath….WOW! So we finally went to our 1B/1B for one night, loaded all our stuff back on the cart only to be told for more than half the day that the new room was getting cleaned. We then had to argue with the manager again and she stated that we could leave our stuff in their cart rental room until it was ready….the rental room where anyone can walk in and take your stuff, and I’m almost certain that Wyndham wouldn’t be responsible! Finally we fussed/cussed and got to our room only to have no blankets on the bed. We finished our stay there and WILL NEVER return!!!

<Title>“Very popular but very run down!”
<Content>This property looks great on the outside but the units are very outdated and in desperate need of total upgrades. While this was formally a Fairfield property the Wyndham took control of when they bought Fairfield it certainly does not appear that Wyndham has done anything to improve the room conditions with, perhaps, the exception being the bed mattresses and pillows. We had a two bedroom, ocean view. The balcony and balcony chairs needed a good cleaning. The living room chairs were worn to the point of strands of material were hanging off the chair arms. The wood furniture reminded me of the type of unassembled furnitiure you would buy at Walmart. I will say that the room A/C worked very well as did the ceiling fans. Each tower has a multi-story parking garage. Wyndham limits parking to one car per unit. Additional cars have to park in the pay parking garage across the street which has access to the Wyndham resort via a sky bridge. There is a very expensive small store in the lobby. Save your money and walk down the street to the Kangaroo convenience store or the Walgreen's for your milk, candy and other small grocery needs. The 4th floor of the south tower opens to the Ocean Walk Plaza. The plaza has a 10 unit movie theatre. It also has a Bubba Gumps, Johnny Rockets, Starbucks, a wings place, ice cream store and a bbq restaurant. Across the street is a dunkin donuts/baskin robins and a burger king and a small diner. Two block away is an IHOP. On the ocean side of the plaza is the Daytona Beach bandshell were shows are put on regularly. Wyndham has two pols and a lazy river and convenient beach access. I was disappointed with registration as it was slower than it should have been. Free wifi access is available in the lobby only. Room wifi is available from AT&T for a daily fee.

<Title>“Serious issues”
<Content>This was our second visit to this resort. The grounds, resort and pool are all excellent but think twice about these three issues: 1- Wifi in room is pricy. $30 for a week for EACH device - smartphone, tablet, laptop 2- Desk staff was somewhat rude when asked for things. 3- We were scheduled for a breakfast information session. When we arrived, they couldn't find our name even though I had the paper with Caleb's name on it and our time. We were told they were too busy and we could do it another day. Gee thanks, but no. We were not offered the breakfast, the wyndham book, layout maps or gift cards we were promised. Not a classy resolution. Nice place, but....

<Title>“Another great stay!”
<Content>I never write reviews but after reading these bad reviews on Ocean Walk I felt like I had too. We just stayed four nights on may 20 in a one bedroom oceanfront booked directly through Wyndham and had a wonderful stay. This was the second good experience weve had there. Yes it is a timeshare and they do ask you to take a tour, both times we've simply said no thank you and they never asked again. Yes you have to show your drivers license to get a luggage cart, but In a resort this size you have to have some kind of policy to ensure people bring the carts back because let's be honest people don't. The room was clean and spacious and had everything we needed. I'm a little shocked of all the reviews on here fussing about a broken door handle and such, I would never let something that tiny ruin my stay somewhere. Every morning we watched them spray off every inch of the pool area which I thought was really nice. My daughter loved the kiddie pool and the lazy river. They filled up our little beach cooler with ice everyday in the snack shop free of charge, everyone was very helpful. Check in is not till four and they mean it so don't arrive too early, we did but they gave us our pool passes and we swam until about 3:30 when we got our room. It worked out good because it gave us extra time at the beach. This is a great place for families with children, and it will continue to be where we stay when we vacation in Daytona.

<Title>“This place is a horrible property”
<Content>I had the misfortune of staying at the Wyndham in Daytona Beach, Fl. this weekend (5/20-5/21) and it was a bad experience from start to finish. When I pulled up to check in I was not allowed to park near the front door even though there was room for a car to park. I was sent into the parking garage without my luggage or other property. The check in process was also a mess. I was asked for my car's license plate number, and, since I didn't have it memorized, I had to walk back out to the parking garage and write down my license number to complete the check in process. The rooms themselves were roomy and nice. However, I would have gladly exchanged the room size for a nice hotel room with personable employees and a property with some basic amenities. This property has no restaurant at all. There is pizza and salads available if you can find the lobby bar open. I was there around 3 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon and they were not open yet. I was told to complete the check in process I had to go over to another area to get my "pool pass and welcome gift". I did not want a pool pass or welcome gift so I went to my room. I was left several messages that I HAD TO get my welcome gift and complete the check in process. I stopped by the desk and gave them my room number and told them that I did not need my "welcome gift or pool pass" as I would not be using the pool and I did not want the "gift". This is a time share property and anyone staying here can expect a time share hard sell. So be advised. I wanted out of this property so bad that I got back to my room at 3 a.m. and checked out and left without spending the night that I had payed for in advance. When I went to check out they demanded my Driver's License as a "security deposit" for the cart that I had borrowed to bring my luggage down with. I have stayed in hotels for many years and never once in my entire life has a property demanded a "security deposit" for a cart for me to bring my luggage out with. I told the desk clerk that and she said that that was hotel "policy" and there was nothing she could do. Even though they had my credit card, even though I was paid in full in advance and had no balance with the property they still needed a "security deposit". This property is the worst hotel experience I have ever had. Along with no restaurants, bad policy, and rude employees they collected upfront for the stay. I now know why. I would have just cancelled and gone to the Hilton next door which I stayed at last year and should have stayed at this year. I had a group discount but no group discount is worth putting up with the unprofessional policies, attitudes of the employees here and time share hard sell.

<Title>“Not what we were expecting”
<Content>Just came back from a cruise and wanted a extra couple of days on the beach. The hotel was a good price and had parking included. I enjoyed the washer and dryer in our room and that we had a stove, microwave, and fridge so we could cook in the room. Then the problems started. First morning after we had to just woken up to make coffee and put dishes into dishwasher we found two cocaroches. They were not big but popped out. Our air wasn't working well so it was HOT in the room. We went down to get some towels to go swimming around 5 and they stated that they were out and wouldn't have more until around 9 that evening. Next morning we woke up and saw another bug. This time crawling over all the silverwere we just put away. Few outlets and the ones in the bedroom are behind the bed so you have to pull your mattress away from the wall just to plug anything in. Beds were ok but I have better at home. Probably won't be staying here again unless I have no other choice.

<Title>“Bad Service”
<Content>We were VERY displeased with Wyndham. I had paid the a 2 bed, 2bath last year and requested a lower floor due to medical problems. They said they never got it and tryed to put us on the 21st floor. No way. They put us in a 1 bedroom for 4 Adults. 2 had to sleep on the sofa's. There was no coffee pot and the air never worked. We had to get the repair guy to fix it hours later. We had to call for blankets and sheets. We were suppose to get our new room by noon. At 4:00 my husband had to get a manager. A whole day was wasted on that. We got in the new room it was nice but I had to call because of no cover on the master bed. The condo are nice but the service SUCKS!!! What was so bad that every time we walked by the front desk there was many many people having the same problems. Mad and upset. I will not EVER go back there. I paid alot of money for it. and they would NOT ajust the price.

<Title>“If you want a family vacation that's all pool & beach, this may do if your expectations are modest”
<Content>My wife and I were recently invited here for a weekend family reunion, and found the facility inappropriate to the family's use. There were no children in our party, and this place is all about family with kids. The only real amenities are the pools and beach access, with only a tiny, open lounge off the lobby and a snack shop that is the only "restaurant." There are no shops, no spa, no business center, no concierge, no guest services, and none of the other things you might typically associate with a hotel of this price. It's a one-trick beach resort of very large size but very little dimension. Our room appeared freshly painted, and was clean and quiet -- this is quality construction. The balcony view of the ocean was truly nice. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare our breakfasts, and a family having multiple meals in-room would find it more than adequate. The room also had its own washer/dryer stack. Downsides include the constant crush of people at the pools and the elevators, of which there are far too few. Be prepared to wait as long as five minutes for an elevator, especially during check-in/check-out times. The facility has far too few luggage carts and, without benefit of cart when checking out, I had to drag luggage for four (including my elderly in-laws' luggage) down a long hall to the elevator, down several floors, back down a long hall, and through the parking lot. When I went to the cart center earlier and was told there were none, the attendant said, "we have many people checking out this morning." And the reason they are unprepared for that is what, exactly? The worst part is, as with the cart attendant, a staff that are mostly indifferent as to your experience during your stay. With a few exceptions, these people just shouldn't be employed at a resort. The worst offender was a very large, semi-blond woman working the front desk one evening. My wife had left her prescription sunglasses in the lounge area that afternoon, and had gone to the front desk to ask if they had been turned in. The large woman told her to come back later, as they were still processing check-ins. Fair enough. My wife returned about 8:00 PM to ask about the sunglasses again; the large woman asked her to describe them, and then said "Nothing like that has been turned in." End of story. When my wife returned to the room and told me this, I went to the front desk; the large woman was occupied, and I quietly asked another woman behind the counter if a pair of sunglasses (I described them) had been turned in that afternoon. She called security, who brought the glasses to the front desk in less than two minutes. When I showed the retrieved sunglasses to the large woman, said that these were the ones my wife was looking for earlier, and asked why she couldn't have called security, she said, "I'm glad you found them," waved me off and turned away. She could not have cared less whether a $300 pair of prescription glasses had been returned to their owner. WHY IS THIS TERRIBLE WOMAN WORKING BEHIND THE FRONT DESK OF A RESORT???? You'll find similar indifference from staff in other areas -- we heard plenty of people grumbling about very poor customer service while riding elevators. In short, if you want a vacation that's all about pool and beach, and want to cook meals in your room, and if nothing goes wrong, this place may suit you. But then, so would pretty much every clean hotel along the Atlantic Coast, and there are plenty throughout the area -- including those located at much nicer, wider beaches -- that offer far greater value than this, and at lower prices.

Smoke alarm removed from ceiling and wires left hanging. Toilet needed 2 flushes each time. The deck was left dirty with cirgarett butts in corner.Remote on TV in Bedroom did nor work. The handle on the closet door was broken. No one ever responded to our concerns. Could be a great place to stay with some updating and mainentance.

<Title>“Purchased two exact rooms; got a shabby rental and a timeshare quality unit.”
<Content>I purchased a timeshare room and wanted another via my RCI membership connection.......they referred me directly to Wyndham. They offered me another room with just like my RCI room for ~$2300....for 10 days. It was during spring break so I paid the price. Upon registration and arrival in the room, I found myself in a very OLD and shabby unit. Nothing like what I am accustomed. My second room was very acceptable. They assured me they would move me from the shabby room and then ignored me for three days........upon which I decided to not ruin my entire vacation and accepted my situation....but not with them. I never heard from them again. Common areas are beautiful, but I received ZERO CUSTOMER SERVICE and a shabby room for $2300.........

<Title>“Dream Vacation”
<Content>I went with a group of 7 others during spring break for one week, and we could NOT have had a better time. The rooms were clean, fully equipped with cookware, washer and dryer, large television. Spacious bedrooms and bathrooms. Ugh, I wish I was still there. We stayed in a 2 bedroom oceanfront room. The couch pulled out and was a comfortable bed for 2. My cousin shared the master bedroom with her fiance, and my boyfriend and I shared a room with another couple. Location, location, location! Within walking distance to many stores, restaurants, and the boardwalk.

<Title>“Our Favorite!”
<Content>This was our second stay here in less than six months...both on timeshare exchanges through RCI. Both stays were in 2-bedroom condos (first in an oceanview, second in an oceanfront). We absolutely love this resort. It is the finest resort in Daytona Beach! The location is great (close to the pier and boardwalk on Atlantic Avenue). The staff is great, always greeting you and polite. The resort is kept up wonderfully and the layout is fabulous; and the concrete construction minimizes constant noise from others that you find in most condos. Of course, we enjoyed the oceanfront condo more (the view is priceless), but our experience (twice) is that housekeeping does an excellent job and the resort is updated nicely. The two outdoor pools and lazy river are beautiful and the two indoor pools are really nice in December (and good size). The resort is on a non-driving section of the beach, which is a plus. The activities program is second-to-none...especially the Texas Hold 'Em on Wednesday nights! We cannot wait to go back!

<Title>“Very Disappointed”
<Content>I booked a 2 br 2 bath unit. When I came into unit -- It was extremely hot and I assumed the a/c had been turned off. So I tuurned the unit on and we went out for dinner. When I came back the unit was still extremely hot -- had to call the office and someone showed up at my unit close to 11 pm. It took a while but the unit finally started to cool the condo after they worked on it for about an hour. Also -- the ice maker in my unit did not work AND the ceiling fan made so much noice and wobbled and shook so bad that we could not turn it on. There was also a HUGE hole in the door of the master bedroom and the couch had a rip in it. I could have dealt with the above -- but then around 10pm on wednesday night -- the Rock band at the restaurant next door (we were in a end unit) began to PLAY at 10 PM and played until 2:00 AM -- So when I called the front desk and asked about it -- they said they could not control that and they informed me that the band would play till 2:00 AM I told the front desk that they should have respected me as a person to give me a heads up about the band and inform me about the noise -- and BY THE WAY -- this was a NIGHTLY THING FROM WED THROUGH THE WEEKEND -- I can not even begin to tell you how loud the band was and then the screaming from the people in attendance In my younger days I would have been down with a live rock concert at 10 PM -- but not when I am traveling with guests and elderly parents. I was from out of town and had no idea what was next door to this resort. I felt they owed me the courtesy of informing me about what I would have to deal with being in the end unit. AND Again the unit was in disrepair I WILL NOT give the resort my money ever again -- Crappy CONDO -- Crappy Service Never Again will I go there !!

<Title>“gg”
<Content>When we booked the room we were not aware that it was a condo owned by someone and rented out. It was fine though as they offered the same ammenities that the motel offered. Only negative was that we did not have daily maid service. This did not pose a problem for us because we were only there two nights. There was a full kitchen and a washer and dryer and everything we needed. The ocean view was excellent. It is one of the nicer motels on Daytona beach as we looked around for our next trip to Florida. The staff was very accomodating. The pool area was nice, except you have to get to the pool first thing the morning to get a lawn chair our you will be out of luck for the day. Guests place towels on the chairs and hold them for the entire day, and they sit vacant as they go back to their rooms or off to lunch or who knows where and other guests cannout use them. We were very happy with our stay at the Wyndham Ocean Walk.

<Title>“Nice Grounds, Poor Rooms”
<Content>This hotel is actually a time share. The units have full kitchens and there is no daily maid service. When we arrived, there was a long line to check-in. While in line, someone handed us a clipboard to fill in information and sign to make the check in go faster. When we got to the front desk, they had to enter in all the information again (supposedly, the reservation information is not transferred to the registration) and then had us sign the printed copy again. Despite a check-in time of 4:00, our room wasn't "ready" until 4:30. When we got to the room, all the dishes and glasses were out on the counter. The floors were filthy and there were cigarette butts on the balcony (this is a non-smoking unit). And, to top things off, there was dirty underwear in the dresser! After a call to housekeeping, we found the dishes and glasses put back in the cabinets but the floors weren't cleaned and the underwear was still in the dresser. A second call to housekeeping got the supervisor to our room and the issues were taken care of. The elevators (in the south tower) were extremely slow to arrive. The hotel is in a great location and the common grounds are well kept. Our room was by the elevator and we could hear the elevator constantly chiming from our bedroom because there is a window to the hallway!

<Title>“Nice facility, but very poorly managed, and very poor customer service”
<Content>I can almost repeat many of the things that the previous reviewer stated. My husband and I stayed there from 4/14-4/21/12, and it was truly the worst experience I've ever had. We stood in line for 40 minutes to check in and then were given the keys to the wrong room. We tried to get another room and that process took two days. There were things missing from the new room, like coffee, soap, washcloths, and the bedspread. Then when the air conditioner stopped working, it took over 4 hours and several calls and visits to the front desk to get it fixed. There were always excuses: just came on shift, didn't know there was a problem, someone else was handling it, new staff members, etc. etc. The bottom line is that this facility is poorly run and has absolutely no sense of customer service. They are nice to you while they take up your vacation time trying to sell you a membership. But once they find out that you are not buying, they seem to have no use for you. There are times when you would call the front desk and the phone would ring for up to 3 minutes before anyone even answered. I honestly don't know how they can call themselves a 5-star resort. I would never go back there and I certainly would not refer anyone to this particular facility.

<Title>“One of our best vacations”
<Content>Excellent hotel in every way. We had a 3 bedroom in the 13th floor. The view from the balcony was out of this world. The room was very spacious. The hotel amenities is what really makes this hotel stands out; 2 indoor pools, 2 ocean front outdoor pools, lazy river and water slides!

<Title>“Nice place, BUT it has it flaws!!!”
<Content>The Wyndham Ocean Walk Resort is a nice place to stay, but it does have its flaws. The staff really does not know what they are talking about. You ask a question and they try to help you but you get the wrong information. Another person says something else. Please educate these people. We had a private condo, it was nice, BUT it needed alot of help. The rug had spots all over it, the freezer had a whole in it, the dishwasher had a few dents in it, the microwave was cracked, the sliding glass doors was extremely hard to open, the shower curtain was NASTY!! Scum, gross crap all over it, the water spiket was so loose I thought it was going to break while taking a shower. While getting the pool towels they ask you when you return them to wash them. We did not have a washer and dryer in our unit. The personnel wasn't going to give them to us, As the front desk said we can use ALL the accommodations in the resort. I said that to them and then they gave us the towels. The people who own this unit should fix and repair these things. I know it is hard to rent from the public but they should check out there unit. I also tried to get a upgrade but the resort was extremely booked, the National Cheerleader Competition was going on.

<Title>“Great place to stay.”
<Content>I had a 2 bedroom/2 bath unit that I booked on Redweek.com. I knew going in that there is no guarantee of room location or view. I did call and request ocean front. Upon arrival, I found there were none facing the ocean, but was given an ocean view. It was on the 19th floor facing north. From what could tell, there are at least 2 different floor plans for the 2 bedroom units. Ours on the side of the building had views from both bedrooms as well as the living room. The units facing the ocean are different. Their 2nd bedroom faces the hallway. The advantage to those however is that they are lock off units. They have 2 kitchens and 2 living rooms, so that is the trade off. There is a building on the north side that might be about 12 floors high. Had we been below that, our view would have been blocked, but there would still be a sideways view of the ocean. Our room was spotless. The furnishings, carpeting, and appliances were all in great newer looking condition. The bathrooms were huge, the bedrooms large. The balcony was probably about 5' x 18'. They provide you with basic essentials for bathroom and kitchen. It also has a stack washer/dryer. You do have to wash your own bath towels and beach towels, so just plan for that. The resort is beautiful. The pools are great with lazy river and water slide. There are 2 indoor pools and an arcade for kids. There is also a water park across the street and a small amusement park a block away right on the beach. I don't have children, but think it would be a great place to stay with kids. The resort doesn't provide chaise lounges on the beach. Another company rents them out. For 2 chaises and umbrella it was $30 a day. We bought our own and Publix down the street and just left them behind. Much cheaper that way. There are very nice chaises by the pool however. I read other reviews that those are hard to get sometimes. But, that tends to be the case at many resorts or cruise ships for that matter that I have been in. Parking was not an issue. We never had a problem and the weekend we checked in, were told that the resort was sold out. I would stay here again if I return to Daytona Beach. . I would definitely stay here again if I ever return to Daytona Beach.

<Title>“My annual vacation on Daytona Beach/Wyndham Resort”
<Content>This was the second time we had planned a vacation at your resort. We had booked 2 separate suites at least 6 weeks in advance. Upon arrival at 2pm, the first room was available for 6 people and we were informed our room was not ready. The previous people had not left yet 2PM. Please check back around 4pm and room should be ready. Checked back 4 PM room not ready 6PM room ready. Please make sure you check out promptly at 10AM on your scheduled check out date. Well, why should I worry about checking out in time ,nobody cared about us getting to our room on time,but we did promptly leave our room at 10AM. There is definitely a booking problem with management for these procedures to happen. A couple arriving next to us were told there room was not longer available somebody had doubled booked their room. They were fit to be tied no wonder. Next morning at 8:30 AM,we are ready to go sit by the pool and enjoy a day of relaxing. There were 12 pool chairs which had been reserved by other guests with Blue & White Beach towels. There was not a sole in the pool,hot tub or inner tubes that belonged to these 12reserved chairs We observed until 11:30AM when the actual reserved guests began to show up to occupy these reserved chairs. There were several other elderly guests besides us who would have enjoyed using these chairs during their prolonged, unthoughtful absence by giving consideration for others. There was not one personnel employee checking on this matter,which reflects poor courtesy to paying guests.One more tip to guests,do not park your vehicle under the edge of any balcony on the top level- when it came time to go to our vehicle,we had a surprise of our life . Someone had consumed too much to drink and eat decided the best way to alleviate his problem was to hang over the balcony and let it go,,down to the roof of our van,side windows, door handles,rear window and rear bumper.Which was dried on pretty good. Needless to say the trip home from there was pretty unpleasant- had to find a car wash.This will be our last trip to Wyndham Resort in Daytona, that was with a total group of 10 people.

<Title>“Motel 6 has cleaner rooms and better service.”
<Content>Terrible customer service. Mold on the shower curtains. We put our personal towels on the pool lounge chairs and security takes them if they; are on there to long but security lost them and they not responsible for them. Odd! There goes $40 bucks. They will not guarantee a parking space on the premises so we had to park across the street and walk to our room with 2 small children after an entire day from Disney. A lot of the rooms are not owned by Wyndham, they will have to call the owner to have something fixed. Toilet, AC, ect. Please do not take this review lightly like I did and decided to stay there after reading them. DO NOT STAY HERE!

<Title>“5 time quests”
<Content>Obviously we enjoy the WOW resort, having 2 young boys the pools, lazy river and slides are a huge hit. We also love that we are a short walk to dinner at the local hot spots. I was dissappointed in how the pool deck chairs were handled. It was like black Friday every morning. Lines develop at 7:30, chains open at 8:15, mad rush to save seats and then there is a chair natzi who will remove your personal items if your chair is unattended for more than 30 minutes...I heard it took more than 30 minutes for some quests just to get up to their room and back, and forget it if you wanted to go for a run along the beach and then return to your chair. Something needs to change with that policy but other than that we love the WOW and will probably return in the future.

<Title>“We LOVED Wyndham Ocean Walk!”
<Content>This place was awesome! We booked late and had a 3 bedroom for 3 nights then had to move to a 2 bedroom. Both of our units were beautiful. Came over Easter weekend. There were lots of families. Yeah the evlevators were busy. Yeah the pool area got crowded. But it was still awesome! Our check in was quick and smooth. All of the staff very pleasant. Everything was clean. This was the nicest place we saw on the beach. I would HIGHLY recommend it.

<Title>“Poor”
<Content>Stayed here as our hotel was overbooked. Car Park always full .. No help with luggage. Pool ... People stand in line at 7.45am for the pool to open at 8.30am By 8.31am all the sun beds are gone ... However by 2.00pm the pool area is in the shadow from the huge building. The elevator is always busy and if you stay by an elevator shaft the "dinging" of the doors will drive you mad!! Do yourself a favour and stay next door in the regency!!!

<Title>“Nice time in Daytona Beach”
<Content>Booked a 2 bed/2 bath condo over the internet. After reading tripadvisor comments I was a little leery but we arrived around 4:30 p.m. Very quick check in and up to our 23rd floor room. Balcony overlooking the ocean and pools. Condo had everything we needed, except washclothes, but a quick phone call had them delivered by housekeeping. On the 2nd day we discovered the DVD player's remote had no batteries. Another phone call and a quick response and we were good to go. Pool chairs are covered with towels right at 8:15 as the pool opens. I was able to get one chair on the 2nd day. On our 4th day I went down early and "reserved" 3 chairs. In no time a security guard informed me that if someone wasn't sitting in the chairs within 30 minutes, the towels would be removed. I fhad no problem with this but felt they should be more consistent doing this every day. One pool was very cold, the other was pleasant. I agree with the person who commented on the kids in the lazy river who were not using the tubes. Plenty of security around, they should enforce the rules better to make it pleasant for everyone. Lots of kids running around without parents, but that seems to be the norm these days. Had a lot of fun, enjoyed the Wyndam and would use it again.

<Title>“Wouldn't stay again”
<Content>We checked in the last week of March 2012. We had reserved a double queen room. We have 2 full size teenagers and doubles won't work so I confirmed that in advance. When we checked in we were told we would have to take a king and a double pull out couch. After asking for a manager and waiting for another half hour they gave us a room. When we went up to our room we found 2 double beds. At the desk they said it would have 2 queens. After traveling coast to coast we were to tired to go back down and go through the battle again. The room had not been updated in I don't know how long. The bath room was caulk over caulk over caulk. The shower curtain had orange mildew all over the inside. Gross! I went to the front desk and they said they would bring up a new curtain. They next day I called and nothing for 2 hours so I called again and they we annoyed with me. We couldn't take a shower! Pools were freezing. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

<Title>“ocean walk”
<Content>nice place, lots of activities if you want to participate, hard to get a chair at the pool, I wonder what time you need to be out there to get one? We mostly went to the beach because we didnt get up at 5am to save 10 chairs at the pool! lazy river was nice but lots of kids in it without tubes just swimming around. rooms were large, we had 2 bedroom deluxe, 16th floor, looking north, the rooms are a little run down since our last visit to the ocean walk but still a nice place to stay and we would go back. Only negatives were pool gate to beach was closed for some reason, all week long with yellow tape all around it and my mother and husband went on the timeshare tour, which they told her it was just an update on her current info and some rude ,nasty , hateful sales lady named rosa treated them very badly. Rosa was the worst and we have been on several of theses tours and never been treated like this, my mother doesnt cuss often but she came back to room and was very upset by the rude, nasty behavior she received from rosa she called her a nasty, rude, Bi*** . They tried to contact someone to complain but calls weren't returned. Also no vaccum in room to clean up a bit with.

<Title>“Nice resort but the little things add up”
<Content>Very large property. Nice pools for kids. Had a 2bdr/2 bath o.v. which was very spacious on the 23rd floor. Near the boardwalk shops. Online pics pretty acurate of the place. Now the little things: I'm still recovering from the ck-in process. What a mess. Waiting a LONG time. Ckd in at 5:45. Never did get a phone call as promised. There's one queue for ck in/room keys. Then you must go to another area for pool passes and the push for ownership. Bellman were very difficult to find. Waited for a cart; waited to ckin; waited for pool passes; waited for the elevator. Maddening! Of course, if you're an 'owner', you get to bypass this mess and go to a separate line. That's the benefit touted by the staff to being an owner. So the rest of us mortals get maddeningly disgusted. Hmmm, not good business sense. Unbelievably at $300 a nite, wireless service is NOT provided in the room. You are welcome to purchase it for $7 a day. Again, we were told 'owners' get wireless and they also get free papers. I had to go to the main floor to buy our paper. This is petty at the rates they charge. I love any beach, but Dayton's not on my favorites list. The tide made a huge difference in the amount of beach available to lay out. People would park right on top of you. No cars on this beach which I liked. Bicycle rentals were fun. If you're a pool fan, get thee to the chaises by 9am. After that, nary a one to be had. Also, The entire pool area is completely shaded by 3pm. The people are packed in like sardines. The pool itself was nice. Parking was interesting. I sat on the balcony one night and watched a dozen cars enter the south tower's garage, and circle all the way to the top floor. Of course not a space to be had, so they all circled back down. Couldn't a sign be posted? I asked, and was told, it is NOT safe for teens to walk the streets after dark. The best restaurant listed on tripadvisor is Bonefish Grille. Speaks volumes about the lack of good restaurants. Do not do the Chart House of the Hyde. Too many little things that added up to major anoyances. Won't go back.

This was very frustrating and I heard others complain but we ended up parking both anyways with no problems. The hotel was very clean and up to date. The elevators are very fast!! The pull out couch wasn't the most comfortable but it worked.

<Content>This is a clean hotel. The staff are friendly, the beds were very comfortable and the rooms included everything to get you going. We did pack coffee and filters as we did not know if stores would be handy. Daytona Beach has easy access to stores. I would definitely stay here again and do recommend this establishment...two outdoor pools, the lazy river, hot tubs and a great children's pool. If it's raining, go to the indoor pool, great work out facility also. You can't go wrong. This was $$ well spent.

<Content>Only there for a day trip from Orlando from Wyndham Bonnet Creek, we requested prior to heading out to Daytona if we could access this sister property while in there to make our stay a more comfortable day at the beach. It is gated, so we were given complimentary day access to wash/change rooms, parking, showers, pool. STAFF - very welcoming. LOCATION - very close to everything. POOL - large outdoor pool, indoor pool but we never used it, kids play area, lazy river:) It really made a difference especially with young children, it was a very hot day, throughout the day, a few minutes inside for the kids was very helpful. Thank you Ocean Walk!

<Title>“Great location and room”
<Content>I read the numerous reviews for this property before booking our recent trip. After reading about the issues many visitors had with the resort we dealt with Carmen and Dennis at Daytona Oceanfront Rentals and had no problems at all. My husband and I stayed in suite 906 in the south tower. We had a great view of the beach and the pools from our balcony (though the party music played continually through the day grew annoying after a while). The suite was clean, comfortable and well maintained. The WIFI was a nice touch. We had no problems checking in or getting parked (might have been because it was off season and a bit quiet). It was a bit cool so we didn't spend much time in the pools but it was nice to be able to access the beach for walks. We only had one sales call and I got rid of her quickly (apparently not about time shares, just wanted us to participate in a survey - yeah, right!). The staff we encountered were pleasant and helpful. And to top it off, our security deposit was refunded promptly. Altogether a pleasant experience and we'd certainly stay here again.

<Title>“Worst hotel room ever!”
<Content>Tried to contact customer service twice, mail returned. Wrote back to "Care at ocean walk.com" got no reply. This basically sums it up, wyndham doesn't care! Booked the ocean view room. Kitchen was ill equipped, drawers and cupboards falling apart, tv was an old VHS so DVDs could not be played, there was no coffee table ( I know, very strange ) bathroom door was falling off the hinges, the list goes on. When we complained we were told that we had booked an owners unit and they have no control over them! This was not booked as a time share, it was booked for wife's birthday through the hotel site, be aware we were totally ripped off and no one seems to want to address the issue. Could receivership be on the horizon?

<Title>“Disappointed”
<Content>I stayed at the resort the weekend of the 2012 Bud Shootout and was in a King Deluxe Suite and it was fairly nice knowing the age of the resorts on the beach. At the time, I booked my room for the Bud Shootout I also, booked my room for the Daytona 500 race. There was a 5 night minimum of which I only stayed for 4 but, was ok with it. The lady booked me in a Studio so, I thought it should be as good or better than the King Deluxe. WRONG!!! It was a small room with 2 Double Beds and so very small. I paid $100 more per night and also, one additional night. I complained and of course, nothing changed. If you have to call the front desk you are in trouble...they rarely answer. When I entered my room, the entry light did not work, no wash clothes in the room...and get this you have a 5 night minimum and they do not provide you with a room cleaning or clean linens unless you pay for it...a whopping $87 each time. I can only imagine what some of the rooms look like or the beds when people leave. Do not get misled when they say a Studio Suite. It is so very small.

<Content>My biggest complaint was that there were no locks above children's reach. They could easily open the door and walk out as our 2 year old did. Luckily we caught her before she got away but who knows what could of happened. The door needs a deadbolt, latch or at the very least a safety chain. I also was harrassed constantly by sales pitch..very annoying. The living furniture was AWFUL. We had a broken faucet in the bathroom and could not even turn the water on but we called and they did send someone up to fix it right away. We did not even go in the pools...they looked filty!! The place does need a good cleaning inside and out..just felt very rundown. Finally, on a positive note..the view is gorgeous.

<Title>“Never again!!!”
<Content>Make sure you allow extra time for the check-in. They are extremely slow and will spend most of the time with a "manager" trying to figure it out. If you get to your room and have things that require the attention of the maintenance crew, you better leave right away as it'll never get fixed. The pools are not heated as advertised. Also beware of the vultures that will try and lure you to the "sales pitch".

<Title>“Dirty Rooms & Bad Service But Nice Property”
<Content>The hotel service and the rooms were bad. The facility is actually in a great spot and close to many amenities. My daughter loved the pool area so we even came back thinking maybe we got a bad room on the last trip. The ocean view suite room was just as bad. Musty, no Internet and worn furniture. The shower door would not close correctly and they would not switch our room. The door was actually dangerous. We ended up leaving a day early and stayed with a family member in Palm Coast. We repeatedly left messages for management and never heard back from them. My wife called Peter Davidson at ------------ this week just to see if anything has changed. She left two messages and again, NO RETURN CALL. What a waste of such a good facility.

<Title>“One of the best places to stay in Daytona”
<Content>We just used an RCI exchange to stay at this property and had a great week! We had a one-bedroom unit -- a "B" unit without at balcony -- and were afraid we'd feel closed in, but it was actually quite a good space! We slept well and had everything we needed to make many breakfasts in. The couch was uncomfortable on our backs, but everything else was well designed and nicely decorated. We loved being able to walk out the door to the beach, to various restaurants and the cinema! It was not a particularly warm week, so we didn't sit out at the pool, but we did enjoy riding bikes and strolling down the boardwalk. Still, it's good to have a car (easy in & out, free covered parking spaces) to drive to lots of attractions -- we particularly loved Blue Spring Park (manatees galore!) and the Ponce Inlet lighthouse and area (the beach is particularly beautiful there). Do stop off at the concierge and get directions and lots of coupons!

<Title>“Ocean Walk - Beautiful property, TERRIBLE rooms!”
<Content>We enjoyed our stay at the Wyndham Ocean Walk, however the accommodations left a lot to be desired. To begin on a positive note, the general hotel grounds and amenities are well cared for and we thoroughly enjoyed the two indoor pools, the outdoor heated pool, the hot tub (spa) and the waterslide. Although during our trip the weather was cold and windy we were able to swim in the outdoor pool that had the waterslide as it was heated to an agreeable temperature. The outdoor lazy river was not heated (I am told it is very hard to heat moving water and keep it heated so this is understandable) and we did not use it. Also, the kids area was not heated so my children played in the pool. The pools were open until midnight (YAY!) which we took advantage of by swimming on our arrival evening late with our two children. The pools were never crowded, although if you wanted a lounge chair in the sun you had better get out and reserve your chairs early. The indoor pools were also very nice, uncrowded and heated to a slightly cool temperature that was still comfortable for swimming. After returning to the lounge one evening we found that they were doing Karaoke in the bar/lounge area that is part of the lobby. The activity director approached us and asked my seven year old if she would like to sing. My daughter loves nothing more than to entertain so she took him up on his offer and he managed the crowd and her singing with care to make sure none of the ‘rowdier’ guests got out of control while she was singing (not really much of a threat since it was a pretty sedate group, but I was happy that he did it anyway. It was a positive experience for us and very memorable. We were very happy he approached us because we never would have thought to do it otherwise. The hotel staff was all very friendly and helpful. We did need to ask for some extra dishes/silverware and had a running toilet that needed fixed and all of these were given prompt attention. We found the location of the hotel to be very convenient. I think they push that being close to the Ocean Walk Shoppes is a great advantage of the resort, but really we found the shops and dining to be passable and used them more for the convenience of location rather than because they offered superior product or great value. Now for the negative: the room. We booked a one bedroom which is usually plenty of room to accommodate my husband, two small children and myself. The room did have a lot of space, but really lacked any thoughtfulness to the design. We really had no place to put any of our stuff away which meant everything was out in the open and we were tripping over it during our stay. Even something like this can be overlooked if the rooms in general are in good condition. Ours was not. We only had two cups and two spoons in our kitchen for four people (we called and we were given more), there was no dishtowel or anything of the sort and really when they say in their description that there is a mini kitchen they are not kidding, there was barely room for one person to turn around. There was no dining table in the room, just a small expanded area of the kitchen counter with four tall chairs around it (not appropriate for small children if you ask me). If people are sitting at the counter while you are prepping a meal your counter space is significantly reduced. Our microwave door was duct taped because the bottom section by the handle was broken, the burners on the stove were not attached and the burners would not work (this was easily fixed by my husband who is very handy, but I never would have been able to fix it on my own) the fridge door handle was very dirty and it looked like someone tried to paint the fridge and the paint ran and it was never corrected. The dishwasher barely accommodated the breakfast and lunch dishes from my family of four and we had to run it twice a day (I recommend bringing some extra dishwashing detergent). No big deal to run it twice a day, except it was really very loud. The appointments in the living area were old and outdated and appeared to be unclean. We found an old moldy tomato on the floor and gum stuck to the bottom of the counter (actually my five year old found them). While we didn’t use the pull out sofa sleeper, it looked to be broken and was desperately sagging in the middle. The real problem was the bathroom. The mirror was so old that the corners were wearing and had no reflective value to them. There was black mold inside the handle on the shower and along the wall in the grout around the edge. There was no way I would allow my children to take a bath so showers it was for all. The shower curtain was just a curtain made of some silky material (no liner) that a) barely reached the top of the tub and b) was made of such a light material that when the warm water was on it created a draft which made the curtain blow in and stick to you while you were in the shower (and this was gross because that too was moldy). The toilet and sink top appeared clean. The layout of the bathroom was not well thought out. The door from the bedroom and the door from the hallway both opened in and took up most of the usable space in the bathroom. There was only one towel rack which was hung over the back of the toilet. Not only was this not enough space to hang wet suits and beach and bath towels, but if you drop anything off of there and the lid is not closed on the toilet it is heading right in! The beds were average and the pillows somewhat uncomfortable and hard. The TV in the bedroom was laughably small and there was an odd window to the HALLWAY in the bedroom?!!! The air conditioning unit was in the hallway closet and was really loud. If you have trouble sleeping with loud noises (it would circulate on and off so it was not steady and we found it disturbing whether you were in the bedroom or the kitchen/living area). We were on the eighteenth floor and the balcony was very nice and the view from it was excellent. The screen door to the balcony was broken so we really couldn’t leave the door open. The layout of the room was absolutely nothing like the layout they have on their website. The kicker was we went on a tour for the timeshare. The room they showed us as a sample room was beautiful. Immaculate, updated and clean, it really only made me angry that I was paying for the junky room I had and at the same rate as the rooms in the north tower. I questioned our salesperson who assured me that only the rooms in the south tower were old, that Wyndham actually owned the rooms in the north tower while they only managed the rooms in the south tower and had less control over the condition. Really I was appalled that they (Wyndham) would put their name on something so trashy and then ask us if we wanted to invest a large sum of money with them to stay at their properties regularly. If the rooms in the north tower were all really that nice then Wyndham should be ashamed for renting rooms in the south tower for the same rate and it should be advertised as a ‘lesser’ selection. If the rooms in the north tower were not that nice, then shame on Wyndham for being so misleading in their sales pitch! We did ask to be shown another room and were told that there were none available (I kinda doubt that since it was the first week in February). All of this was such a shame since all the common areas were well maintained and the resort location was so convenient. The only reason we didn’t leave was because we were not in the room very often and spent most of our time in these common areas or out and about in the Daytona area. Sorry Wyndham, you won’t be getting any recommendations from me and I surely will not be staying at any of your properties any time soon. I can handle a room that needs a little updating, but I cannot handle dirty to the point of disgusting along with dishonest business practices.

<Title>“Great Holiday”
<Content>We spent 3 weeks at Ocean Walk in 3 different condos and Fully agree with ED S and his comments. We found the resort a wonderful experience and have booked for 6 weeks next winter. The rooms were clean and all the appliances that you could possibly want. Everything was clean, check in was fast, especially when we had to change condos. They helped us with our move and got us into our next condo early. The pool area was great and hotel was close to restaurants and movies. We are looking forward to our stay next year.

<Title>“Are there two Wyndham Ocean Walk Resorts??????”
<Content>We (four of us) stayed at Wyndham Ocean Walk from Feb 5th through 12th 2012. I just can't believe all the negative things I read on here. We had an IMMACULATE 3 bedroom, 2 bath Unit #624. The place was beautiful, EVERYTHING worked like it should, we have traveled most of our lives and I can say this is one of the BEST places we have ever stayed at. The staff were friendly and very supportive and helpful. I usually don't do this comment thing but after reading some negative entries here I felt that I should defend the Wyndham Ocean Walk that we stayed at in Daytona Beach. Maybe there is another one somewhere? Just joking, but, I can't believe we are talkinga bout the same facility? Thanks again to all the staff and folks who worked at making our week a WONDERFUL stay.

<Title>“Wonders of the Wyndham”
<Content>Last spring break, sometime in March or April, my family and I had the opportunity to visit Daytona Beach, Florida for a week. Most of the nice hotels were all booked up, but my mom managed to find us a room overlooking the ocean at the Wyndham Ocean Walk hotel. We’d never stayed in a hotel like the Wyndham, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. The best word to describe the Wyndham hotel was massive. I love staying in luxurious places that have many amenities and lots of things to keep me busy. Wyndham easily met my expectations. It was about thirty stories high, and the building was a lot of different colors in the front. It was definitely an eye catcher, even considering the fact that it’s located in the busiest part of Daytona. The lobby’s floors shined and the pillars that supported the ceiling were striped with vibrant blues and greens. If you walked out the back door towards the ocean you were met with two huge pools, two hot tubs, a water slide, an enormous blow-up slide, a snack stand, and the beautiful beach. You could rent umbrellas and lounge chairs down on the beach if you wanted to have some shade from the sun while you spent the day outside. If you walked out of the hotel and turned right there was a theater, shopping center, restaurants, a live band, and more. People were constantly out enjoying the sites and activities. There was even a carnival with rides down the strip if you walked far enough! There was never a moment during my stay at Wyndham that was dull. When the weather was nice my family and I would enjoy the pools, beach, and other things that Wyndham’s resort offered. On the few days it rained in Daytona the inside of the hotel had plenty of activities to keep us busy too. There was a movie box where you could rent a movie to watch for the night, a game center, indoor pools, hot tubs, restaurants, golf, a workout room, and much more! The people that worked there were friendly and helpful; they knew how to make you feel welcome. The week I spent at Daytona Beach was easily one of the most relaxing and enjoyable weeks I’d had in a long time. The stress disappeared as soon as I laid eyes on the ocean and the exciting things to do at the hotel. Being at the beach always brings out my best attitude, and Wyndham made it ten times better. If you want a family friendly vacation then Wyndham Ocean Walk would be perfect for you. My family thoroughly enjoyed it, although the weather certainly could’ve been a little better. Going in the summertime might be better than the spring time; that way there would be almost no doubt that it’d be warm and sunny. Have a fun vacation! I know I did.

<Title>“Nice place for family visit in Daytona.”
<Content>We visited Wyndham Ocean Walk with my family in July of 2011, and had a very nice time. We had three separate families travelling together; we had an room next to my brother and his family, and my parents had a room with a view of the ocean, on the same floor. All of the rooms were very nice; we had a small diswasher malfunction when we entered our room, and maintenance came very quickly and fixed it immediately. They were friendly and apologetic for the inconvenience, we didn't have any additional issues during our stay. Check in was normal; not the fastest part of the trip but not unpleasant. They did ask us if we wanted to take the timeshare tour, and we declined; they were not unfriendly afterwards. My only complaint, in general, is when we tried to obtain more laundry soap, it took us two days. The front desk directed us to the concierge, who directed us to Housekeeping. Left the message with Housekeeping, who said they would bring it but did not. Called again and they told us to go to the front desk. Different front desk person sent us elsewhere - anyway, it was just laundry soap, not a big deal, but a little frustrating. The facilities were very nice - a couple of pools, hot tub, water slide, etc. They had activities for those who wanted to participate. I appreciated that they had an Under 18 computer room, and an Adults Only computer room - I did need to do a little work while travelling ,and with no wifi in the rooms and logged in on my computer in the Adults room. It was quiet and comfortable. I did notice, however, that of the three computers at the public computer bank, only one would print, and one of the others wouldn't connect to something. There was some frustration from those using those particular computers that they couldn't do what they needed due to those issues, or had to wait for the computer that did have everything working. I also noticed that people did have to wait to use a computer, although when I was there it generally wasn't too long - probably 15 minutes at the most. It seemed the guests using the computers did realize there was a line and took care of their business quickly when necessary. The beach in front of the resort is very nice; there is a very long stretch of beach to enjoy, so while it gets busy there's plenty of space. It DOES, however, get busy. The pools at the hotel also get extremely busy - it's hard to get a deck chair, and there are always a lot of people coming and going. We enjoyed being so close to Ocean Walk, as we did walk over and eat at several establishments over there. We're not big race fans, so we didn't spend any time in Daytona at those establishments. We spent most of our time just relaxing at the beach, and had a very nice time. We didn't find a ton of other activities to do in town (we visited the tropical fruit wine store, and the chocolate factory), but had a very nice time on our family vacation.

<Title>“Delighted and excited - With ocean views...WOW”
<Content>As you can see I am excited with this amazing 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment that had everything that opens and closes. This apartment would be the normal to Americans but coming from Australia to have this apartment with ocean views from out 16th floor balcony for 16 days was so amazing. I love to cook fresh food and wash my clothes with out having to bother anyone.All this can be done in your apartment. The 2 bedroom unit was around $189 per night. (We had 4 people share) 1 King size bed and in the second room was a double and single bed. Oh neglected to say I had a spa in my room. Amazing valued with incredible views. A walk or bike ride along the worlds most famous beach is a must.

<Title>“OK Property, Poor Customer Service Experience”
<Content>We stayed at the Ocean Walk during the off-season, mid-January, as an RCI trade. The one bedroom unit was OK, nothing special. The fold out sleeper sofa wasn't very comfortable for sitting, the kitchen was stocked OK, the bed comfortable but the pillows were not. The location is good and the hotel has several amenities such as a game room, several pools, and access to the beach and boardwalk. Where this property falls down is their "hospitality" staff. The people at the front desk and guest services are only interested in selling you more timeshare property or "upgrades" and will do everything they can to con you into going on their sales presentations...including promising things they won't deliver. And if they aren't selling you something, they are not friendly or helpful at all. They have an on site concierge...except she doesn't seem to be there very often or at convenient times for anyone planning activities. Took us 3 tries over two days to get a hold of her during her supposed work hours. The nicest people they have on staff are the janitors and housekeeping. Overall, the experience at this property was poor and I cannot recommend it.

<Title>“Great place to vacation”
<Content>I took an impromptu vacation to this place and was pleasantly surprised. We had a 3 bedroom ocean front unit that was beautiful,clean and well stocked. The pools were all warm and clean as well as the hot tubs. The lazy river was cold but my kid didn't seem to mind so much. The staff was as friendly as any cruise I have been on and the relative closeness of all the shops and restaurants made it so I never had to leave the premises. I was a little skeptical about the place after reading some of the reviews but I can say we had a great time. I guess some people are hard to please not matter what. I have never reviewed a place before but felt I should say a few nice things about my enjoyable vacation. I never was approached about a timeshare or anyone asking if I was interested in hearing about the place. It was a relaxing trip for us that definitely help us get though the northern winter blues.

<Title>“3 stars for amenities only”
<Content>Resort is dated but functional and great location on the beach. Our room is horrible and I cannot get an upgrade. Part of this is my fault for not booking a room with a view -its a room with two views of the hallway. It is very dated and the couch is completely sunken in. The room is like a blackhole, dark and closed in. Very disappointing.

<Title>“Stay here for location only”
<Content>Stay here for location, but nothing else. We are Worldmark owners and booked a 3-night stay here as our first visit to Daytona Beach. We used it as a home base to visit St. Augustine about an hour north. However, the resort needs maintenance and the service needs an upgrade! It gets 3 stars simply for its good location. There is no Worldmark check-in desk, so even if you’re an owner, you’ll stand in line with everyone else who booked this resort online or via a travel agent. When I went to a side desk near the front desk to inquire about check-in, the person (Patti Richardson was her name) looked very angry and unhappy and said, “This desk is only for VIPs.” I asked, “I’m a Worldmark owner. How do I know if I’m a VIP?” She said, “If you were a VIP, you’d know. You can stand in line with the others.” I don’t mind receiving an answer I don’t want to hear, but she could have cracked a smile. Looking back though, not only was she rude, but I am increasingly shocked that there was no check-in line for owners. Our wait in line was 25 minutes on a Friday night at 9pm. Not what we expected, and not a big deal on its own, but read on. Now for the room itself -- It was spacious, and I bet when the resort was new, it was probably a really nice space! All of the rooms were HUGE! The view was of the parking rooftop, and some of the city of Daytona, but it is what it is and I won’t fault the resort for the poor view. What I DO fault the resort for is the poor maintenance and the fact that our room wasn’t ready even after 9pm – - We were in room 1131. The kitchen was not stocked with any coffee, though the coffee filters, sugar, Splenda and creamer were in full supply. My husband went to the front desk on our second morning to pick up the coffee. He should not have needed to do that. The kitchen should have been stocked prior to our arrival. - The bathroom had no little bottles of lotion, shampoo, or anything at all. We were only supplied with two bars of soap. On Day 2, we went to the hallway, found a cart, and picked up the items we needed. This should not have happened. -The inside door handle to the shower was missing. Imagine stepping into a shower, and there is no way to shut the door. That’s what we had to deal with every morning. Additionally, the plug was missing at the bottom of the shower door to prevent water from leaking all over the floor. So, after each shower, water dripped all over the floor from the bottom of the door. -The door stop opposite the front door was broken. It was literally just hanging on the wall with broken wood around it. -The garbage disposal in the kitchen was missing the rubber protector which meant when you looked into the drain, you could see the disposal. When we DID use the disposal, a red piece of plastic shot out of the disposal because that protector was missing. -On our final morning, we decided to take one last dip in the hot tub as we’d done a couple of mornings before. However, none of the three hot tubs were working. Two were turned off and the water was lukewarm. The third hot tub was roped off. Another disappointment. -The kicker was when I went to take my final shower on our last morning and all four of the electrical outlets in the two bathrooms stopped working. The GFI buttons on the outlets were in the correct position, so we’re not sure what happened. It was likely a problem with a fuse or the breaker, neither of which we had access to. My husband notified a maintenance worker in the hallway so he could address it, but I was completely undressed since I had just showered. To put a “band aid” on the situation, my husband moved the dresser in the bedroom to gain access to an outlet with a mirror so I could dry my hair and finish getting dressed. Our stay here included a comedy of errors from start to finish at this resort. We have never missed a maintenance fee payment in the 15 years we have owned Worldmark, and were disappointed in the apparent lack of maintenance and courtesy at this resort. It was not at all up to Worldmark standards, and we were extremely disappointed with this 3-night booking.

<Title>“Great Time Had by All”
<Content>Dec 22-24, 2011. This was our first time visiting Daytona Beach and all, and all we had a great time. It wasn't wonderful but great. There was lots of security so we felt very safe on the property. We arrived really early and our rooms was not ready at that time, but by 2:30 or 3:00 they gave us the keys. Our rooms were on the top floor with beach view right outside our balcony, we couldn't have had a better location. When checking our 2 rooms, everything smelled, looked clean, fully stocked, and working property excepted we needed more towels. I called the front desk and they promptly brought us more towels. Our room was in a great location and it was very quiet on our floor, so we all had a great nights rest. Now the lazy river and the indoor pool was a different story. They were both very cold, we tried to use them but they were just to cold. So, went to one of the hot tubs to warm up only to find that it was broken. We were told that they were repairing it and to use the other hot tub. Well, because the pools were so cold and the other hot tub was broken there were to many people in it. So, our pool time ended and we went to the beach. I would say for us, we all were able to relax, enjoy the beach and enjoy each others company. We would go back again.

<Title>“Don't go for the beautiful pool in December!”
<Content>Dec 30-Jan 1, 2012 I have stayed at Daytona since my teens in the Daytona's Spring Break hay days! It went way down hill and has since been on somewhat of a rise over the last 5 or 10 years. That being said, it is still a bit on the rough side. This resort and the restaurants & shops attached to it make all of that much more tolerable. I would not put Daytona anywhere near the top of my choices though for a family vacation. Because of the good security and facilites on site, we were looking forward to a nice relaxing 3 days of mid 70 degree weather by the pool and beach, enjoying the property. Well the weather held up and the staff were quite friendly. The room was not ready even minutes prior to 4pm, and in all fairness check-in was 4pm and we got our room at 4pm. The 3 main pools out back were not what we expected. The two outer pools were maybe mid 70's, but nowhere near a pleasant temperature. The center pool which is the lazy river may have had ice cubes in it. I had stared at the photo of the lazy river several times prior to this trip and was very dissapointed it was not heated. The tiki bar (called something else) does not even open again until February! The beach was as great as always! The room was a one bedroom which is what we booked. The bedroom portion was adjacent to the elevators and noisy. The bedroom window looked out to the hallway and elevator and had horizontal blinds with decorative side curtains that did not move. So at night, if you like a dark room and quiet, you will get neither. The flatscreen on the wall was comical. If I can figure out how I will post a picture of it. It must have been a 19"-20" or so. It looked more like a laptop mounted to the wall. The main living room was spacious and had a very large flatscreen TV. The entire room was clean. It did not however smell clean or fresh in any way (more like the waffle house). The handle to the sliding glass door was broken off and laid with the remote controls like it belonged there. There was a full ktichen that we never used, but appeared to have whatever you neeeded. The location has a large 3 story small mall of sorts with shops and restaurants adjacent and attached to it. Opposite the shop area was a Hilton that looked pretty nice. I know it used to be Adams Mark back in the day. I have not stayed at that facility (Hilton) but would look into it if I decide to return. I would NOT stay at this resort again unless it were between the warmer months of maybe May - September and one heck of a bargain!

<Title>“disgusted”
<Content>This was a terrible experience.We checked 4 different rooms none were clean all had missing light bulbs (seemed to be strategically placed to hide dirt and mold).Sliding doors didnt lock. Blinds were broken and woudnt close and faced a hallway. The first room smelled of stale cigarette smoke so bad we could not go in. The last room I was surprised it actually looked nice until we had bulbs replaced and especially in the bath room the tub had black mold all around the inside of the tub and running down the outside corners of the tub. I called house keeping and they said it would be tomorrow before someone would come while we were out so they could remove the caulk and it would have time to dry?! However a lady came and scrubbed on the tub and then asked us if it was o.k. I told her to leave the cleaning supplies- I got in the tub in my shorts and cleaned this tub and used boiling water off of the stove to rinse it down and finally it was useable. We had asked for our money back to go some where else but they said we had to talk to the reservation line the next day! You have to leave a deposit to use a luggage cart that you have to pick up in another building.?! The amount of time it takes to check in is redicules 30-45 mins. No one there when you want to check out no one to answer the phone when you call in the morn. We were suppose to receive a voucher from their sales pitch within 14 days -after calling a number of times- we received it 5 1/2 wks later when the the instructions say it has to be returned in30 to even be acknowledged so we will have to see how that goes. We had other problems but we also spoke to 2 other couples at different times in the elevator who were upset by basically the same things we were.The location is nice as are the pools and the grounds are kept well. I will say we stayed in a Wyndham Days Inn and it wa s 100% cleaner and really nice especially for the money it was 1/2 the cost twice the quality.

<Title>“Great Ocean Front Resort”
<Content>My 2nd visit to OceanWalk and will continue to return. Situated with stores, restaurants and a movie theatre next door with many more within short driving distance. Daily activities geared towards kids, indoor miniature golf, computer/games/craft rooms and 2 heated pools/hot tubs with lazy river and water slide outside and 2 heated pools inside. Exercise gym and computer/billiard room for adults. Free Wi-Fi in lobby/computer areas. Unit is spacious, comfortable, full kitchen and balcony. Staff friendly and helpful. Grounds, building and units are well kept. Eatery on site serving basic meals. Bandshell directly in front of resort but closed during Fall season however, outdoor ice skating rink open right beside the Boardwalk/Beach. Lots to do in the Daytona/surrounding areas. OceanWalk is a large complex and at times can be very busy but the ocean front, boardwalk and beach area location compensates for any negatives. Stayed Nov. 26-Dec. 3'11

<Title>“Strange bedroom”
<Content>We rented our condos from Daytona Oceanfront Rentals. Carmen & Dennis were fabulous to us and they went out of their way to get us the highchair, pack and plays, and air mattresses we needed. The biggest problem I had was the "3rd bedroom" had a window to the hall right next to both doors. That meant that the hall light was on all the time every night & anytime anyone walked down the hall we heard them loud & clear. We had some family renting a "2 bedroom" condo that was exactly the same as ours, but the extra room was just a sitting room with a pull out couch & tv. If you're renting, go with a 2 bedroom! The pools were fabulous. The paved beachwalk is nice. It's close to everything. The beach was full of seaweed, but it was November on Daytona Beach so I expect nothing less.

<Title>“Great vacation condo in Daytona Beach”
<Content>We needed to find a hotel or condo near the Ocean Center Convention Center, and this is the closest condo, 0.3 miles away. We stayed in 711AB (South tower) and rented directly through a management company (www.daytonaoceanfrontrentals.com; Carmen and Dennis own the company and they are fantastic) and it was affordable and well worth it! It was a nicely decorated, spacious 2 bedroom, 2 bath condo (it can be separated into 2 units, but we left it open). There were 2 comfortable beds in each of the room, which was great b/c it can accomodate more people (since this was for business, no one shared a bed). A 5th person slept in the 2nd living room, although directly on the sofa since the sofabed wasn't very comfortable, but she had plenty of space. Check-in was easy and no one tried to get us to do a timeshare tour. The A unit is on the ocean front and is the bigger unit with a full kitchen. B unit is the back unit and I wouldn't rent that alone b/c it would be dark and the windows face the interior of the building. We didn't cook in the kitchen, but it seemed to have the basics needed if we did. The outdoor pools were nice and the lazy river was lots of fun! The beach is right in front of the pools (separated by a boardwalk). The unit had it's own wi/fi, but it was spotty. I think this is mostly due to spotty internet in the area (I heard similar problems at the Hilton and convention center). The resort was very convenient to restaurants and bars (Mai Tai's had great happy hour specials in the afternoon and at night). So glad we stayed here. Thanks Carmen and Dennis for your help!

<Title>“We stay here a lot”
<Content>Ocean Walk is an enigma. There is no question that it is probably the nicest timeshare on the beach but it is handled differently than the other Wyndham resorts. Many of the units have full-time owners who rent them out so there are not only timeshares but daily rentals, and also in the AAA book as hotel rooms. So there always seems to be a question about our reservation. The timeshare is, of course, a great deal for us, especially compared to the nightly rate. We have enjoyed very much the nightly stays available through the Wyndham points system. We have stayed there many times, most recently December 2010 and will stay again in January 2012. We have only been able to get to the front desk once when calling in advance and I always want to call in advance to verify our reservation, especially since they also have had, more than once, problems verifying our reservation once we were there. They only want you to call the regular Wyndham 800-number which is of no help for confirming our reservation onsite. There is also a long wait time on that line. Front desk people have not been very friendly. VIP desk seems to be no more with no early check in’s and when it used to be in operation, we had to wait until after 5 p.m. more than once for our room to be ready. One time, when we had back to back reservations, which they assured us were fine; then security came to our door at 11 am. demanding that we leave immediately I had to rush downstairs to verify our dates, which of course, I had already verified upon check-in. A front desk person had assured us it was fine. Like I said, there always seems to be a “question” about our reservation. One reviewer has said as exchangers, they felt like a second class citizen. Well, don’t feel so bad, owners are treated that way too. In that case, I don’t know who would get a nice front desk clerk. Check out usually requires a long wait in line as well (while we are sweating out the 10 a.m. or else check-out deadline!) There is also always something in the room needing to be fixed, the most common the televisions. They are missing remotes, missing the electric wire, cable connections are twisted or actually broken off, and twice were not even hooked up to any wires; so now we know to check them right away since at midnight, when going to bed, when we find there is no television in the bedroom, it is not the time to call and wait for maintenance. Shower doors off rails, toilet seats broken, no kitchen wastebasket, dryer won’t turn off …lots of maintenance problems which may or may not get fixed the next day. One time, right after the Fairfield name was changed to Wyndham, there was no bedspread on the bed. The bedroom looked so strange; it actually took me a while to realize that the blanket was on top with the mattress showing below. I called to ask for one 3 days in a row, I guess they couldn’t believe it either. Finally I asked if this was the new “Wyndham decorating system”…well, I don’t think they “got” it – but they brought a bedspread then! Most recently, the front desk person was not interested in any of our maintenance notes until we told him about the roaches we found. He perked up then! Apparently, they have changed the pool towels procedure from before, but it is still not ideal. They will charge you $15 each for not returning the pool towels but when you return them to the special office downstairs, the lady just says, “Thanks, just throw them out on the pile there in the hall. Goodbye.” Well, I wanted some sort of receipt to prove that they had taken out the carbon copy of my name from their file, but she said No, could not get one, didn’t need one. That makes me nervous. This to say that I am usually very happy even with non 5- star resorts, so this one seems so strange since as an obvious gorgeous 5 star resort, there always is an issue. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful resort, oceanfront, and art deco décor that will knock you over. Pools are lovely; outdoor bar is nice, morning breakfast is great with friendly waitpersons there, proximity to restaurants is good and we especially like the Starlite Diner right across the street. .

<Title>“Started rocky, but turned out to be a great vacation!”
<Content>The check-in here initially was a nightmare. My husband and I lodged here from Thursday-Sunday based on a timeshare my aunt booked for us. There was complete confusion about the one-bedroom suite v. room and having an oceanfront room v. Standard room. There is a disconnect between the reservation line & the resort. The reservation line tells you to request an oceanfront once you arrive, however, the resort says they don't change rooms. The resort customer relations rep got involved and took care of the situation in a heart beat! He upgraded us to a 2br oceanfront that just had remarkable views of the water and boardwalk. We didn't partake in any of the resort activities because the room was just incredible! The only downside to this resort is that checkout is at 10am...most places allow a noon checkout so that was the only downfall. We signed up for a timeshare presentation for Sunday morning, but canceled after changing our minds about sitting through the 90-min presentation. All in all, this was by far this was the best place we've stayed while visiting Daytona and would definitely consider staying @ Ocean Walk again!!!

<Title>“Double check your bill before you check out!!!”
<Content>The hotel was nice and the rooms were spacious but their billing / accounting department has problems! I stayed for two nights an the hotel charged me for four, I called an complained and was reassured it would be fixed. Instead of refunding two nights they charged a third additional night!! It took we all week to try an get it straightened out and supposably they money should be refunded next week, 8-10 days after checkout!!! In the mean time overdraft fees are stacking up, which they agreed to pay by check which could take up to two weeks past the refund date!! So in the mean time I'm out a week an a half worth of overdraft fees and I've been unable to use my account!! The only response I've gotten from the hotel is "sorry this happened".

<Title>“Fantastic Property”
<Content>Stayed at a private purpase timeshare for 5 days mid-october. The resort was top 10's, very clean organized, and well staffed. We stayed in a 2 bedroom with 3 peoplle, and had more than enough room. One person in our group was an elderly senior and the distance walking to the room was significant. The pool deck was nice and the lazy river an added plus. Great, great location, in the ,middle of everything. Close distance to the airport when one of our party left early. Great restaurants abound, but the kitchen was adequately stocked to easily have breakfast and snacks daily. Would definately recommend.

<Title>“Absolutely amazing!”
<Content>ok so I did not book through the hotel itself but through a private owner, Joe McMenamin. The thing is, I wanted my vacation to be a breeze and the other reviews I read were horrid. Some with pictures of a mold infested carpet I can not believe the Hotel itself was not shutdown for. The resort itself was beautiful. Location the best in the city hands down. From the oceanfront, to the night life, restaurants, even the convention center, right across the street. I stayed in the north tower room 1021. Like I said, private owner so the room was decked out! Hardwood floors. Huge flat screen in the living room and a mid in the master. Fully equipped kitchen which we put to use the first night in. Even came with dishwasher detergent for afterwards. The value of the hotel is incomparable. Even the Hilton next door could not stand a chance. The oversize balcony which had its own entrance from the master was phenomenal. If there was one complaint, it would be I did not stay longer. Joe even let me check in early! I give this resort hands down 5 stars. I did not eat on location but right on the boardwalk, which is conveniently attached to the resort was sloppy joes, and boy do they make the best Cuban sandwich I have ever tasted. The indoor pool was convenient because it rained on the second night. And security, a little overdone in my opinion, I suppose it may be good safety practices, but you better carry your pool wristband everywhere you go because they are worse than the TSA!! I have never booked directly through Wyndham so I cant say if it is worth it. All I know is that Mr.McMenamin's rooms were cheaper, you can view 360 tours on his website of the actual rooms you would be staying, and it was just an overall pleasant experience.

<Title>“November mini-vacation”
<Content>We rarely stay in timeshares/condos, so we weren't sure what to expect. The Wyndham has 2 towers/garages (north & south), and other than the height, not sure what's the difference. We were given an oceanfront unit on the 17th floor. Our 1 BR had a KG bed, small safe, TV, bathroom, stackable washer/dryer, kitchen/eating area, living room with sleeper sofa, TV, & balcony. The unit wasn't "perfect", but my house isn't either :). The Wyndham timeshare staff left messages daily, but we ignored them. The staff we encountered -- parking & pool security, check-in, and activities employees were friendly. We stayed 4 nights and didn't receive daily maid service, so if you're used to this you'll have to wash your own towels/sheets and bring extra toiletries. We encountered mostly cool & cloudy days, but enjoyed the little time we had in the pool area (slide, lazy river, hot tubs). Because of the height of the buildings, the sun disappeared off the pool deck by 1 pm (November & daylight savings time). There are plenty of indoor amenities -- 2 pools, fitness room, computer room, pool table, arcade ($), mini golf ($), scheduled activities ($), bar & eatery ($). The ocean walk complex is right next door with shops & restaurants. The "ocean walk" is a concrete walkway next to the ocean & leading to the pier (closed due to repairs). We were in Daytona Beach for a wedding, so if we ever returned, we would consider staying here.

Lazy river pool on-site, grounds & beach so nice. Resort activities very organized, bar downstairs. Restaurants/shops attached to building, small selection but nice when you don't feel like driving. Location is great, parking attached to hotel, overall great stay! We explored Ponce Inlet, St. Augustine and the Riverfront.

<Title>“not happy with stay”
<Content>We booked an oceanfront room, when we got there were told oceanview in the old building was the best there could do. If you looked out the balcony you could see the ocean if you were standing. The sofa was tore and had stains on the arms. the bathroom ceiling in the shower had mold on it. There was dust all around the baseboard in the bathroom. The rooms had recentley been painted. The hall smelled like we were at a fish markket, and other people were complaing about this. They were painting some of the other rooms which were oceanfront, probably why we did not get the room we had booked. There was no miniture golf, no ice or vending machines. The doors on the stall in the restroom by the pool were hanging off center so you could not close either one of them. The hairdryer stopped working so my husband went down to get another one and was told they would bring me one in 15 to 30 mins, it was at least 30, the man brought it said try it and walked off. The cothes dryer made a raking noise and the iron leaked. Will not go back!!!

<Title>“There Are Pros and Cons.”
<Content>Pros-great beach location; Ocean front; next door to the restaurants at the Boardwalk. The pools are great, especially if traveling with children. Great splash zone for the little ones. Lazy river is also a plus. For Daytona, you probably will not find a better selection of pools/water options. Cons-The rooms are dated and need remodeling. If you are a room person, this may not be the place. Also, we went with our family and a set of grandparents. We reserved a one bd rm king and the GPs also reserved a separate one bedrm king. We checked in at different times and both of us were given a one bedrm w two queens. We both had a little bit of a hassle actually getting the rooms w kings. Other guests said that, regardless of what you reserve, you don't get a king one bedrm unless you insist on it at check-in. Also- in our one bedrm, we had 4 towels for 4 people and one travel bar of soap for a 6 day stay. Yes, they have washer/driver, but when 4 people are at the beach all day and no one stays in and does laundry, you need at least 6 towels. Also, one travel soap is not sufficient. I asked for extra towels and one extra bar of soap and the front management said no. I had to make a special request to a supervisor- something about my condo was owned by another company or individually owned and they would not provide additional towels or an extra bar of soap. Really? This soap request had to be elevated to the next level- not kidding. Take home message: nice pools, but do not expect the full Wyndham experience as far as rooms or service. But, it is one of the nicer options in Daytona (we had other family obligations right outside of daytona and combined it w a beach trip, or we would have probably picked a different beach location altogether).

<Content>Slide was closed and pool deck was under renovation and they said nothing about it when we made the reservation. Nothing really stood out about this hotel over others we stayed in. Beach was nice but the beach rental umbrellas, chairs etc. were outrageously priced. Parking garage to guest room access was very inconvenient. For the price I would look at the Hilton or Plaza which is right next to this property on each side. Staff not all that helpful. Not a great experience.

The place is clean, a little worn but hey, its a popular place. The elevators is a little slow yes, but...there are a lot of ppl using them at the same time. We always rent from owners, so maybe that is why we are so pleased. The only complains I have its that some ppl go out early to book poolchairs by putting a towel on them and the leave for hours. Thats not nice!

<Content>The most discussing place I have ever seen in my life. Got to our room, door didn't work, security opened the door and we were horrified. Entire room was full of mold. Customer service was non existent. Toby, the supposed Manager on Duty was rude and belligerent. Jasmine at the front desk was horrible. Just an over all horrible experience. Tried telling us that the mold, which covered 90% of the 2 bedroom condo was from the recent rain. Because we rented from a private owner they would give us no break on another room. Told us mold was only in that room. That is absurd. Have called the Volusia County Health Department as well as the EPA. If mold is that bad in one room it has to be in the building. I was in the room less than 10 minutes and it actually burned my throat.

<Content>After riding a motorcycle from PA, pulling a small trailer behind it, we pulled into the wyndham in the middle of a rain storm with strong winds to be told to move that trailer off the property immediately, NO YOU CAN'T UNLOAD IT HERE! Attached to the bike it is no longer then a car and half the size. So 2 blocks away is a parking garage that costs $20 a day for this little trailer. The other couple that drove down has their car in the parking garage. Was informed 1 car or 4 bikes, WHAT A RIP OFF.....AND NO THEY DON'T CARE IF YOU NOW HAD TO LUG YOUR LUGGAGE FROM THE PARKING GARAGE 2 BLOCKS AWAY

<Title>“Disappointing.”
<Content>The location and setup of this resort is fantastic, and the rooms are great. However, I was immediately disappointed upon arrival to find out that even though I had already paid for the entire balance with my debit card, they wanted an additional $150 for hotel incidentals? Which wouldn't be credited back to my debit card card for up to 5 days??? Unfortunately, I was not made aware of that upon making reservations, nor was I informed that the main pool- the biggest pool with the slide- was drained and under construction! For the cost of the room, NOTHING is included! Even the coffee in the mornings cost $2 per cup. I was a little shocked at that. I've stayed at lesser hotels that provided a better experience due to better service. This hotel could be the best in Daytona easily if they would step it up in that department because they definitely have the most convenient location and best pool deck around.

<Title>“Had a great time!”
<Content>I thought this resort was very nice. You can’t beat the location! It is on a wonderful strip of beach that cars are not allowed on, which was very nice. It is right next door to Bubba Gumps, Starbucks, a movie theater and other great restaurants and shops. It seemed like a slower time of year, so there were repairs being done on the larger pool and the water slide. This was not a big deal to us because we came to the beach to actually lie on the beach…not next to the pool. The other pools were very nice though. We came mid week, so if you wanted a chair, there were plenty to choose from. Once Saturday came, it did get a bit more crowded. Don’t try to go down early and put your towels down to save chairs. There is someone walking around monitoring the pool deck and they will move your towel if it looks like nobody is there. They do require you to have a band on you to be by the pool. You can put it on your beach bag if you want. The 2 bedroom condo was very nice and clean. We were on the 18th floor, so the view was wonderful. It had everything we needed for our 4 day stay. The beds were nice and comfortable. If you run out of towels, you need to wash them yourself. The hotel staff was very friendly at check in, during our stay and at check out. The design of the hotel is somewhat “art deco”. It kind of reminded me of the 80’s, but it was nice and not overly done. There is only 1 parking spot to for each condo, so if you have more than one family going, the others will have to park across the street. This resort is right on the ocean, so people should keep in mind that wind, sand and salt can be damaging to paint and what not. There was always a maintenance person working on something when we were walking around. Security was present as well. It was a very nice stay and I would definitely go back to this resort.

<Title>“Very nice”
<Content>I stayed at this resort September 2010. We booked the 1bedroom suite. The room was pretty large. It had a small living area with a kitchenette and a separate bedroom. The bathroom did not have a whirlpool tub but that's ok.The room was super clean! I was a little disappointed that the room did not have a view, but if you request a room in the upper floors you may get lucky and have a view of the city. The location can't be beat. The resort is right on the ocean so if you book a larger unit you could get an ocean view. The pool at the resort was great! They have an adult pool, a kiddie play area and a lazy river. Awesome if you're traveling with little ones. The staff was very friendly. Overall, it was great experience. I would stay here again.

<Title>“Glad I didn't read the negative reviews ahead of time - made my own positve judgement”
<Content>Okay, I could nit pick, and comment about the mold in the tub area, shower door that did not close properly, the coldness of some staff, and the fact that the lamps did not work in the bedroom - but the overall stay was delightful. The bed, by far, the most comfortable one ever! Stayed in a one bedroom suite and could not have expected any better. We would really like to come back next year for a family reunion and try out the 3 bedroom suites.

<Title>“Resort?”
<Content>Our first experience at this resort was the security guard who seemed to be having a bad day and thought nothing of taking it out on us. Other than that, the staff was helpful and the location is great. We went to the timeshare meeting but our room was substandard with peeling wallpaper, dirty bathroom, water slide down for maintenance, and one of the hot tubs out of commission so why would we buy a vacation package to enjoy more of the same? One of the beds had a problem - meaning there was something biting us but just on one side (if that helps). There were a lot of disabled guests who told me this resort takes great care to accommodate them. To be fair, this resort used to be Fairfield so it's possible they will update it. I don't think it was worth the price with so many other resorts on the strip available.

<Title>“very good family spot!!”
<Content>Five years ago my husband and I spent our wedding night here and so for our anniversary this year I surprised him with a family weekend here. We had a great time and the kids enjoyed the very spacious one bedroom. The bathroom shower was a little dingy but everything else was clean. Our washer machine did not work so we had engineers who came to our room for about 20 minutes (while we had company) to try and fix it but couldn't. They replaced it with a smaller older one. The pool are was the highlight of our trip, as the kids enjoyed the lazy river and slide. I noticed some of the tiling had come off around one of the pools which looked a little dangerous. Daytona beach gets very busy sometimes with tourists and events (I should know I live here) so after five years I thought the hotel was in great shape despite minor details. Look forward to coming here again.

<Title>“Bad service, go somewhere else!!!”
<Content>The line at check in was extremely long and it took over 20min to get help from an agent. Did not have cribs availables since it was pass 9pm and the place where they had them was closed. I only picked out this hotel for the water slide, which is a joke of a slide. At around 4pm It started to rain and the slide was keeped open but when the rain stoped the life guard decided to close it, because on his opinion it was going to start to rain again and much worse, (the rain never came back) while he was closing it I asked him why he was closing it if the rain had stoped and I let him know that we have been at the beach all morning and that we have just started to use the silide, his answer was: you just got here but I've been here since 9am. There is a huge sign that states that the slide is open until midnight. I complaint at the front desk but nothing was done. We left the next day so we couldn't use it again. The rooms were clean and the price was resonable but the service was terrible, no help when you need it. There's no real place to eat, there's a store where they "make" food and some chairs outside to eat. There re many other hotels in this area that I would give a try before I had to come back to this hotel

<Title>“Our first time at this resort”
<Content>I could have rated it a 5, because at the time we walked into our 3 bedroom it had a smell of smoke. I thought this resort was a non-smoking place, odviously not, we saw people outside by the pool areas smoking. As we were exploring our place we noticed that we were missing a trash can for the kitchen, stove mitts, and extra paper towels. I called the front desk and notified them about this. Their service is excellent, they had a trash can in our room sent to us immediately and as I was walking in the lobby area I stopped by the check in counter and spoke with them and told them about the things needed and he was very concerned about my situation, including the smell in the room, so he said let me the stuff you need right know, and about the smell, can I switch rooms for you? My point is the people there care about their customers and want to make sure their are satisfied and enjoying the property. This place is really nice, if you want to have a nice meal, either have something to make in your room or you will need to go out somewhere to eat. You would have to drive to go to a nice descent place. Overall, I enjoyed it there and will go there again.

<Content>To CarlF. Baloney. They can not rent out an owners room. You have to rent them right from the owners or their reps. I know that there is a beef between Wyndham and the owners but. At least tell the truth. To those that want a good room. Rent FROM an owner.

<Title>“Great Vacation Place”
<Content>My Wife and I vacationed at Oceanwalk and had a great time there. This place is so convenient to restaurants like Sloppy Joes (good food and drinks), Johnny Rockets, Bubba Gump, Mai Tai, Quiznos and a ten screen movie theater that all is accessible from the 4th floor. Walk down to the boardwalk and ride the go carts or the feris wheel. Only $5 per person. We didn't have to drive at all. The lazy river was very relaxing. Daytona has really cleaned up and we felt very safe. Our 1 BR condo #1310 was beautiful. Great view from the oceanfront balcony. We rented from a private manager, Joe McMenamin. His email address is joemac1@cox.net. He has a good website with many pix of each room that is available. He has 2 and 3 br also. Link to his site http://www.tiptopwebsite.com/websites/index2.php?username=mcmenamj&page=1

<Title>“Not Our Problem”
<Content>I booked through Wyndham's website and upon arrival was given an "owner's" room by the front desk. This individually owned room was not up to Wyndham standards. Curtains were pulled down, furniture full of burn marks, appliances broken, bedding inferior, the room had sand on the floor and furnishings, and the baths had mold. The room was not clean and not stocked. The condo style room slept 10 people and was stocked with only 3 glasses. When we complained to the front desk we were told it was not thier problem because it was an "owner's" room and they couldn't do anything about it. I explained that I didn't book with an owner, but directly through Wyndham, and this fell on deaf ears. It took much complaining to get the room cleaned and appliances replaced, but management utterly refused to do anything about the bedding. They did agree to refund one nights stay, but I would have much rather have had a clean, comfortable room.

<Title>“Excellent Vacation Spot for Families”
<Content>Although we did not spend the night here, our kids with family, did. They spent 3 nights, on Labor Day Weekend, and we spent all day Sunday, with them, enjoying the day, swimming in their pools and walking the boardwalk in the evening. This resort has a lot to offer, for any age group, from adult pool to kiddie pool, to the Lazy River which was loads of fun for "Grammy", and her kids! They have indoor activities as well, for all ages, plus nice areas for adults to relax, too. Everyone was having fun, no rowdiness, no problems, and they do have visible security on premises. The 1 BR our kids rented, on 16th floor, was very nice, with perfect view of the ocean, along with large windows, in the hallway, to look out over the city of Daytona Beach! Hotel guests have private parking, on premises, but since we were guests, we parked across the street in the parking garage --- which was no problem, as their fees are reasonable for all day parking. This resort has Ocean Walk Shoppes, right beside it, which has restaurants, boutiques, souvenir shops, etc. and pizza take outs are very close by. Oftentimes, the bandshell that is part of boardwalk, has live music, on special days, and fireworks, too. Also, within walking distance is the Ocean Center Convention center, and Daytona Lagoon, which is another 'fun spot' for the whole family. All in all, this was a nice place, and will go again, and possibly get a room of our own, for the weekend!! They run "specials" occasionally too!

<Title>“We go at least twice a year!”
<Content>We love Ocean Walk! We have stayed here many times and just love it! The rooms are big enough for a family and have all the amenities needed. We stay in room 1506 or 2431. They are our favorites. 1506 has an ocean view and 2431 has a beautiful view of the city and the river which is breathtaking at night. The place is clean and everyone is very nice. They have an activities department which does lots of fun things for the kids. The pools are gorgeous as is the lazy river and people can't drive on the section of the beach in front of the hotel. It's awesome. Lots of nearby shopping, and activities too.

<Title>“Room was disappointing, not what I expected”
<Content>The facility is great except for the parking challenges. The staff was great as well. I thought my room was old, small, and did not live up to the Wyndham standard. I requested a handicapped room which had pedestal chairs in the counter only eating area. The bathroom had a tub with a chair? That's not what I call a handicapped room at $200 a night with a 3 night minimum required. The beds in the bedrooms were full size instead of queen and I booked it for 4 adults. The couch and chairs in the tiny sitting area looked like ones bought from a second hand store and were very uncomfortable. I booked my stay at a Wyndham property but my room was more like one from a low budget motel.

<Title>“We loved Edisto Island but weren't exactly thrilled with the Wyndham experience.”
<Content>The condo we stayed in was quite nice and well appointed. The guest services staff on the other hand was less than pleasurable or helpful. We moved our luggage to the condo in the afternoon and decided to head right to the beach to make the most of our time since some bad weather was moving in. When we returned we realized that the sofa bed was neither made nor were there any sheets/pillow or blankets. We contacted the guest services staff who indicated that because it was after 5pm (it was approximately 6pm) they couldn't do anything about that because "maintenance handles those things and they are finished at 5 and lock-up their things in a separate building." We asserted that our daughter had no place to sleep and they responded that there was nothing they could do. This was unacceptable. I drove back to guest services and calmly asserted that point. The manager maintained that she could help us in the morning until a man emerged from the back and said he would try to borrow a set of bedding from another unit. He returned with a bag of sheets and no apology. By then it was well past my daughter's bedtime and I returned to our condo to make her bed. When I arrived my husband said another bag of sheets had just been dropped off. Not a great first impression of the Wyndham idea of guest relations. Also, they said there was a fitness center but failed to let us know it was closed for renovations along with the game room that our children had been looking forward to using when it rained! Ugh.

<Title>“Average stay ... go during the weekdays only for a better time!!!!”
<Content>We arrived at midnight so check in was a breeze considering I was the only one there!!! By what I've heard, the check in in the afternoon is a nightmare. We had to get a cart to take our luggage upstairs. I had to surrender my drivers license to use it. We were on the 24th floor in the North Tower with city views/river views/ocean views which was beautiful. We rented from an owner so the room was very nice and updated. The bathroom was huge. So much room that we could not have been any more comfortable. It was just myself,husband,& baby. I pulled off the comforter from the bed because I don't care where you are at , I swear they NEVER wash them. Well underneath was the other blanket that was brown. Well glad I pulled that one off because I could see where something dried on it. It could have been bodily fluids for all I know....GROSS!!! Luckily I brought my own blanket to put on top of the sheets. The kitchen had everything you would need except the ice maker did not work!!!! That was a major downer. You should wear a pool band while in the pool areas, however I never wore mine & I was never questioned about it. The security does stand around the pool areas. The indoor pool in my opinion was not comfortable. It should have been warmer. We arrived on a Tuesday night and it was so peaceful. The elevators were quick. There were plenty of parking and no lines anywhere. We could find a beach chair at 11:00 in the AM. I say that to say this....by Friday when everyone showed up things we complete madness. You will enjoy this hotel if you can go during the week in the off season and not in June/July. We left a day early because the amount of people was crazy. We went out one morning and had to go to the beach because they had no pool chairs. The elevators were very slow with all the people coming and going. One of the problems came when I got on the elevator only to discover that a boy and his 2 freinds had pushed like 5 other floors randomly thinking it was funny. AND THERE PARENTS WERE NO WHERE TO BE FOUND!!! We did enjoy all of the pools and the lazy river was clean blue and enjoyable ! We would stay here again if it is not Labor Day weekend, or a weekend in general. We would come back during the week. That is when you can really enjoy the facilities and get your money's worth ! I also had to get my key card reactivated 2 times. The front desk was very nice and helpful and it only took a second. The second time I called from the floor and they sent up a security officer to let me in. He was very polite and helpful. Then an engineer came to fix our door...it may have been messing up the key cards or something. One last beef.....we forgot the pack n play for my baby to sleep in. Well the front desk said they were out for the night and for me to call back in the AM. When I called the next day, a man told me that since I am staying in a room from an owner that I am not allowed to use the pack n plays at the resort. I WAS LIVID!!!!!! A stay at the hotel is a stay at the hotel or so I thought. So I had to make a run to Walmart to buy a cheap one that I could take back later !!!! We should be allowed to use anything there !!!!!!! Watch out for all the pizza flyers that will be under your doors during the entire stay. You will be bending over a lot !

<Title>“"Needs remodeling but nice."”
<Content>Six of us stayed here the week of Aug 22, 2011 (all adults). The best feature of this resort is the easy access to the beach and the amazing view from the suite balcony. We had a 1-bdrm suite and a 2-bdrm suite. The 1-bdrm suite does not come with an outside view, so nice for just add'l sleeping and dressing space (that's basically what we used it for). The furniture and appliance were modern enough but the flooring throughout needed a change. Great breakfast at the cafe there in the resort and not too costly. The main pier was closed for construction so that was disappointing. I was surprised how clean this beach was considering it is a very popular beach and cars are allowed in certain areas. The umbrella and chair rentals at the beach can become costly if you are staying for a while so budget for that expense ($25 p/d). There are many small shops throughout and area the resort making it easy to get things. Those who like to shop there is a mall and bigger shopping centers nearby, but you will need to drive. The staff was nice and friendly and very accommodating to our needs. We requested more towels and got without a problem. And the hall light bulb blew so we call to ask them to change it, left the room when we return few hours later it had been changed. Overall, our stay here was very pleasant we had no major problems and we plan to stay again next year. If the rooms and resort had been plusher I would have given it a 5-star rating. But it satisfied our needs.

<Title>“Decent convenient place”
<Content>we stayed in a 3 bedroom suite on the 9th floor. It was decent enough. For the money I expected a little newer nicer place but it was OK. Examples, cheaper white cabinetry, older looking bedspreads, couches OK but a little on the utilitarion side. no seperated dining room. Very good spot to stay, close to amusement park, boardwalk (whenever it finally opens back up), shopping and restaurants. Big thumbs up to the kiddy pool and lazy river , although almost always packed the grandkids loved them. NO free internet in the rooms only in the lobby was a bit of a disapointment. Nice gameroom and play area for the little ones, should weather turn bad

<Title>“Room accomodations very uncomfortable”
<Content>Upon check-in the dissatisfaction started to creep into my mind. The staff at the desk didn't seem very friendly, much information (that was somewhat unnessesary) was required at check-in. After receiving a room number and key, we were then required to go to another person (across the room), who welcomed us and informed us they could help us extend our check out time on our day of departure (originally we had been informed it would be 10:00AM) to 2:00PM. Their main purpose, it turned out, was to encourage us to attend a breakfast scheduled for Monday morning. When I inquired if this was to solicit us for a time share, the lady was very evasive, and assured us there would be no "pressure". We then proceded to our room, and our immediate reaction was disappointment. There was no ocean view (we had reserved a one bedroom), the pictures on the website were in no way representative of what we got. When I went into the bedroom, the venetian blinds were broken (at the top and bottom) where anyone walking past could see into the room. I called the operator (dialing zero) and the person was not helpful, and was in fact rude. She ask if I wanted to speak to the supervisor and I told her that in fact I did. The supervisor's reccomendation was that I hang a blanket over the window. When I informed her that I did not "hang blankets over windows at home" and I had no intention of doing so here. I told her I did not pay over $1000 dollars to hang blankets over the window. She ask if I wanted to change rooms, I informed her yes I did. She stated there would be a "room cleaning" charge (remember I hadn't been here ten minutes yet). I questioned this, and she stated it was "policy". Then she switched and told me they were full up and there were no rooms available. The maintenance person, to his credit, found??? a new blind about two hours later and installed it. In addition we discovered; the can opener did not work, the phone in the bedroom did not work, the remote control to the living room TV did not work. I called again and was informed they would be fixed, they never were. I called back later, and they informed all had been repaired (they weren't) we had never even left the room. Finally, we retired for the evening resolved to make the best of it. The light that came into the room the whole night was like daylight there were no curtains only the blinds and the light from the bright lights in the hall could not be stopped (I guess we could have hung a blanket over the window). In the morning we were both very sore as the mattress was as hard as a rock (I now suspect we were indeed sleeping on the boxspring without a real mattress). I say this because on the day we checked out I discovered the edges were made of metal, I never removed the sheets to check, it was later that I wondered if it was indeed the boxspring. My wife had to sleep on the couch in the living room the last four nights as her pain just kept getting worse. The pool was good, the ocean great and Daytona and surrounding area wonderful, but I would never stay at Ocean Walk again. The experience reflected on the web site was practically non-existant, compounded by rude staff (bellman and maintenance person exempt).

Also a broken shelf in the fridge and torn upholstry on the couch. The AC didn't work when we got there, and the technician came by and turned it off & back on. It worked after that, but he warned us if it stopped again to just call and he'd come back (like it happens all the time). But the kids LOVED the pools, the beach and the lazy river and they had a great time. The staff were not super-friendly. Our room was barely ready at 4:00 and they wouldn't trade our towels after they got wet from a sudden downpour. It was not the worst place I've stayed, but I doubt I'll go back!

<Title>“The only good thing to say is the water pressure was good...”
<Content>This hotel needs some serious updating. The bathroom faucets were broken, permanent dirty stains in the shower, couches were uncomfortable and it needed a good coat of paint. It was clean, aside from the permanent dirt stains in the bathroom. We were constantly waiting for the elevators and a prank fire alarm woke us up at 6 am one morning.

<Title>“we loved it”
<Content>after reading the reviews here, i was pretty nervous -- but we did not experience any of the problems others have complained about. i booked a one bedroom suite for two nights - i wasn't expecting an ocean front room but we were given one on 10th floor. we got there early to pre-register and actually got our room keys right then (at around 1pm on a friday afternoon) yes it was very crowded around pools and yes elevators were slow at peak times but we really enjoyed our stay and our room was awesome. all staff we spoke with were friendly and helpful. bring your own chairs, beach towels (and an umbrella if you want shade) and you won't have to run for the pool chairs in the mornings. it's great having bars, restaurants and shops right next door - we've stayed at hilton next door and liked this place better (bigger room, better pools)

<Title>“Terrible”
<Content>We stayed there in November and were thinking of buying one of the units until our stay this time. The air condition went out and was not fixed and it was very hot, the tile was coming up in the floor in the hallway, the faucet in the tub was about to fall off the wall, it was a very miserable stay. When we first got there I had to ask for towels because it was not stocked with any for the kitchen or hand towels/ washcloths for the bathroom (which I thought was standard?)The only good thing was the beds were comfortable. We were told that there was free internet in the rooms at check in, but when we got to the room, you had to pay for internet unless you went downstairs to the lobby where it was free.

<Title>“These low review writers are insane”
<Content>We went to this resort in July 2011 and we were pleasantly surprised considering all the bad reviews on this site. We rented from an owner (americasbestvacationrentals.com) and got an amazing deal. This is the guy to rent from. When we arrived at around 10:00 (checkout time for those leaving) we were the first people there and we were greeted by the nicest lady ever named courtney collins. She pulled a few strings and got us into an oceanfront on the 16th floor and it was phenomenal. My family had lots of fun going to the well maintained beach, the boardwalk, the shops right next door and across the street, and most of all, the lazy river. Now one downside would be that it is almost impossible to find a beach chair and you may have to wait a minute or two for a float at the lazy river sometimes so if you have a chair or a float of your own bring them to save time. The pools are as clean as they can be at a resort which is right on the beach and the staff do what they can to keep it clean. We had an incident while we were there when a small child defecated in the kiddie pool. The mother informed the front desk and within minutes the pool was shut down and cleaned. The resort was very clean and the staff was very friendly. Everything was in working order and the amenities were plentiful. There was an internet cafe for when there was work to be done and an adult office armed with a printer and a fax machine. There is an arcade and a 24/7 play room with many toys and a wii for the kids to play with, which was a blessing for our family with 5 kids. There was a pretty up to date gym and a total of 4 pools plus the lazy river (2 indoor and 2 outdoor, on of the indoor ones had a projector and a screen which showed movies every night). Our room was immaculately clean when we arrived and though we did have a problem with a faucet it was fixed within 15 minutes by a very well informed staff member. The staff was very quick to come with extra soap and detergent and even an extra pot. But beware, this is a resort, not a hotel, there is no maid to come in and clean every day. there were 2 HD tvs which kept us entertained and no one was bored for a minute. Very tasteful and comfortable furniture. We had a splendid time and we will be back soon.

<Title>“Extremely pleased.”
<Content>I located this resort online so I was not sure how it was going to go. We had no trouble whatsoever. Check-in & out went well. The resort was clean, the rooms were newer, and neatly decorated. The amenities were great. We are planning a return trip next year. We only went for 4 nights, but wished we had stayed longer. There was so much to do on site that we hardly went anywhere. We had more to do and spent less money then prior vacations. The ocean view was awesome. I would highly recommend the Wyndham at Ocean Walk. Money well spent and memories to last a lifetime.

<Title>“Very dissapointed. Not up to Wyndham standards.”
<Content>We rented a privately owned condo (242 Driftwood) within a Wyndham resort area in Edisto Beach. Wyndham acted as the leasing agent so we expected a Wyndham level of amenities...we were wrong. When we first walked in the condo, the main drapes were in the corner as the curtain rod had fallen off the wall. A lamp shade had slid down around the base because the glue had given out. The dvd remote did not work (dead battery). There was no internet connection in the unit (no router). All the pans were gross! All the teflon coating was chipped/cracked. The show control knob came off in our hands when used. The bathroom sink plunger did not work. The ice cube trays were a joke. The freezer dripped water into the refrigerator necessitating us to put a bowl in to catch the water. We had cockroaches! And you could not open the dishwasher door all the way because of the kitchen configuration; the door hit the fridge. Needless to say, we checked out a day early and headed home. Not only would we NOT recommend this facility, we STRONGLY URGE anyone considering a privately owned condo leased by Wyndham to NOT DO SO. Buyer beware.

<Title>“Great Hotel for Kids”
<Content>Pros: The hotel is in a very nice location: beach front on a beach that does not allow cars and right next to a shopping/restaurant complex. The pool complex is excellent especially for families with very small children. They have a kiddie pool that is only about eighteen inches deep and that is filled with fun water activities. As a parent of two four year olds, it was nice to be able to sit back and watch them play for a while. The rooms are fine. Average describes them well. We had a mini-kitchen which was nice. Free parking in a hotel operated parking garage is an excellent amenity at the beach. Cons The staff seemed overwhelmed by the number of people at the hotel. For the most part they were unfriendly and unhelpful. No wifi. I thought that was a standard feature these days. Check in takes a while. Conclusion When we return to Daytona, we will definitely be using this hotel. Excellent amenities make up for the so-so service.

<Title>“Worst hotel experience of our lives.”
<Content>Everything was broken in our room. The towel rod, remote to the living room tv, and safe did not work. The bathtub spicket was coming out of the wall. When we arrived, the alarm clock and bedroom remote were under the bed. We didn't have any wash clothes or hand towels until we asked the front desk. The fire alarm started beeping at 11:30 PM but didn't see anyone until 12:30 AM. The view was great, but not worth all the lines and stress. The place caters to their time shares, but they have to wait in the lines too.

<Title>“FYI”
<Content>We stayed at Wyndham in Daytona the week of July 19, 2011 for 7 days. I reserved a room with a balcony but when we arrived at 10:00 p.m. we were told that our room did not have one, and they could not correct our request because they were over booked and would have to send 7 guests elsewhere when they themselves arrived..SMH... It was very upsetting, but it was late and we didn't feel like arguing..we just wanted to take the kids and go to bed. When we arrived to our room, it didn't have any windows..YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR IN A CLOSED IN CLOSET..and Nobody ever told us that they didn't supply the essentials as well, i.e. towels, toilet tissue..etc., We had to wash towels and wash cloths every day..ON VACATION. So I want to warn you, that if you do decide to stay here, make sure you request a room with a balcony and then call a couple of days ahead to verify this. Also, plan a couple extra dollars for all the things your family will need that are typically supplied by a hotel stay..THAT YOU CERTAINLY WON'T BE GETTING HERE, and last but not least...PLAN ON WASHING YOUR TOWELS AND WASH CLOTHS ON VACATION TOO...SMH.

<Title>“Service was terrible”
<Content>We stayed at this location July 2011 arrived on Friday afternoon around 200pm. Waited in line to check-in for over 30 minutes. Only one desk clerk on duty. Made it to the clerk went through the check in process and was told the room was not ready we would have to return at 400pm. Being from out of town and with parking very difficult we waited in the lobby until about 400pm. At that time we had to stand in line for about 20 minutes until an employee approached us and asked if we had done the precheck-in. Since we had at around 200pm he directed us to another line that we stood in for about 15 minutes again one desk clerk. When we reached the desk she told us the room was not ready. When we inquired as to when it would be ready she did not know told us to just come back around 430pm. We then called the front desk and asked for the manager. The lady who we spoke to wanted to know why we were calling for him. We explained the check-in situation and told her we had been sitting in the lobby since 200pm. She rudely told us that check-in was not until 400pm anyway and hung up. About 420pm we stood in line for another 15 minutes and were then given the keys to our room. The room was clean but one of the door knobs to the bedroom was broken. The location was very crowded and sometimes there was 5 to 10 minute wait for elevators. At the pool side it was difficult to get chairs or tables. As always people put their towels on the chairs early in the morning and sometimes didnt even use them. We tried to purchase drinks at the pool bar. As would be expected we had no cash with us in out swim suits. We were told to charge anything to the room it had to be set up throught the front desk. This was never explained to us when we checked in. We were not about to stand in line at the front desk again so we went to our room and made our own drinks. At the time of check-in the front desk directed us to another desk telling us we had to set up our pool passes. We met with the girl there who went through a long explanation of what the hotel had and area to do's. Then she said we could attend a short resort presentation about 90 minutes on Sunday and receive a free breakfast, $150.00 gift card and a $200 rebate on our next stay with a Wyndam. We agreed and went to the presenation. It was for a vacation club time share. We were bombarded with slide shows, talks, a tour of a room like we had just stayed in only cleaner. Then presented with a deal to buy into a time share for around $30,000.00 when we turned that one down the dog and pony show started. As typical the first person trying to sell us acted like he really didnt understand everything so the MANAGER had to step in and help. We were then hit with 4 more deals that finally went from $30,000.00 to $9,000.00. When those were refused a third person was brought in. He act more sternly with us than the first two. He presented us with a buy in at $2800.00. When we refused he acted some what upset. Finally we were able to get the items promised after 4 hours. I do not know if I will return to Wyndam or not?

<Title>“This place stinks! Stay away. Read all reviews and be warned.”
<Content>I don't normally give bad reviews, but this place deserves it. I stayed there for one week on business and my family joined me. I didn't have a choice where to stay on this trip so I didn't pick this place. After reading the other reviews there is no way that I would have chosen this place. Everything in the previous reviews is correct. Two and half hours to check in. Room wasnt ready by 4pm even though that is the check in time. Had to wait in three lines and after two and a half hours my room was still not ready. Finally given another room on the 16th floor of the south tower. Room smelled horribly. Squished bugs on the walls and ceiling, about 20 of them. Bathroom looks to be 20 years old and never renovated with mold around the tub and the faucet dripping. The oven knob was broken and the temp was not right and burned stuff. Another knob for the stove was missing. The phone barely worked. When I called down to report the squished bugs it kept cutting out when I moved and talked at the same time. After returning around 5pm the 2nd day the bugs were still there. I went down to the desk and asked for a new room. They said someone would be up right away to clean them. No apologies. They did clean them up that evening. The place was crawling with hundreds of unsupervised teenagers. People get in line at 7am to reserve a place at the pool by putting towels down on the chairs then dont return for 2-3 hours. One day all the pool/beach towels were out by 11am and they said they would not have any more for the rest of the day. The lazy river is supposed to be limited to 30 persons but one night I counted more than 60 in there. Parking is a pain and if you have more then one car you are out of luck. My family and I couldn't wait to leave.

<Title>“Too many problems, too long to fix them”
<Content>Front desk staff courteous but 3 days to get wash cloths to our room?? 3 days to get a nasty bathroom cleaned is too long to wait. I spent most of my time waiting for the elevator and waiting at the front desk to get problems reported repeatedly. Heard much of the same from other guests. Disappointed.

<Title>“A Two Hour Check-In Disaster”
<Content>We arrived around 3 p.m. on a Thursday for a three night stay for a large family. We waited in the first line for 30 minutes and made no progress. Then we got pulled over to another line. The lady said we may have a problem, but I will talk to the Management. She came back and said they were working on the problem. About an hour later a Supervisor (very nice) came over to explain the problem to us. They didn't have all the rooms per our reservation. I asked why not? He proceeded to explain how they have a lot of maintenance problems in their hotel and the rooms are not available. So we haggled for another 20 minutes to try and get decent rooms and got nowhere. We had to take some rooms we did not want. We finally got to our rooms around 5 p.m. Then we had to hassle with them later to get a financial adjustment. It is not worth it. Better to go next door to a much better hotel facility. We will not be going back to the Wyndham Ocean Walk.

<Title>“Disappointed in some ways”
<Content>I have stayed at the Oceanwalk several times in the past. This stay was average. Check in is at 4 p.m. right about the time people are coming up fromt he beach and pool to get ready for dinner. It took us approx. 20-30 minutes to get on an elevator and no carts available. For the size of this place, there sould be more cart available. We had to make several trips to our car to haul up our luggage, food, etc. As a suggestion, check in should be at 2 p.m. while the current residents are out at the pool and beach. Not so late at 4. I have never stayed in a place with as late of check in as 4 p.m. Parking is horrible. You only have 1 space for each unit. For those that have 2 and 3 families staying in one unit, they have to pay for parking in the public parking garage. For as much as it cost to stay at Oceanwalk, you shouldn't have to pay for parking. There should be some arrangements made with public parking at no cost to the Oceanwalk residents or some other form of parking available. There should be more tables by the pool with umbrellas instead of up on the patio where the doors are to the hotel. With so many people are now being cautious about sun exposure and it is so hard to find tables by the pool, etc. On the positive side, the staff has always been pleasant and courteous during all my stays at Oceanwalk. They do try to accomodate in such a positive manor. I did attend the presentation on the vacation rentals and Aaron was awesome, even though I could not purchase at this time. I attended one when Oceanwalk was a Fairfield resort and was very pressured to purchase. You can not ask for a more centrally located spot with alot to do . The Oceanwalk shops, theatre, and restaurants are such a plus when you have teenagers, etc. Also, so many souvenir places that you can walk to without having to get in your car and drive somewhere. Concierge is very helpful also.

<Content>Stay clear of this place. Here are the following reasons why! 1. No maid service.2. No extra towels or blankets,beds hard as rocks with kid size pillows.3. Rude staff.4.You have to do your own laundry and cleaning.5. Check in takes 2hrs and then they try to talk you into a time share.6. Elevators are slow and sometimes take 10 min to get on.7.Dryer broke, toilet had problems flushing, tub was backed up.8.Holes in room doors and panels falling off the sides.9. People steal your pool towels from pool side.10.Pools are dirty covered with hair and bandades floating around.11.No hot water in the south tower for over 6 hrs. List can go on and on trust me.

<Title>“Will Never Return”
<Content>Our family & friends have been vacationing in Daytona Beach for several years, this year's experience at the Ocean Walk by Wyndham was more than disappointing! In order to be fair and clear I will begin at the beginning...We rented for an individual owner who was very nice to deal with...the room we rented was a King Bedroom with a lock-out ... the layout was wonderful and there was an abundance of space for the 5 of us! We arrived approx 6pm on the day of check-in...The line was jaw-dropping, at least a 45 minute wait to speak with one of the three desk clerks. As we had rented all of our units from the same owner, we had pre-paid our rental fee, cleaning fee, & security deposit and signed a complete short term rental agreement. When we reached the counter, the clerk asked for another $150.00 cc hold/deposit...now we are talking $450.00 in deposit...when I asked about the deposit I was told... the larger deposit is for the property owner and the $150.00 for resort incidentals. Should have been a red flag but I didn't catch it...I was also presented with a resort contract, requiring my signature. The problem with this was the contradictions with the original rental contract. Check-out time, which is enforced with a financial penalty was different, the parking (which I will address later) was different...and when I asked for a copy of this document that was not their policy. All checked in and ready to proceed to our room, we learned there is only one bellhop on-duty and only 4 luggage carts...it was suggested by the desk clerk that we "just wait until around 10pm and then try to get a cart". The 5 of us proceeded to our 10th floor unit while the 4 others made their way to the 9th floor. On our route we found an unattended luggage cart sitting in the elevator hallway. Of course we grabbed it, telephoned the other members of our group and made tracks to the parking garage to retrieve our luggage, deposited it the rooms and returned the cart to the main lobby. Our unit (with lock-out) included two full baths...after 11 hours in our vehicle, we all wanted hot showers and dinner. Surprise! No hot water in the South Tower, response from front desk "They are working on it - Should be several more hours". When we returned from Dinner, around 10pm, we had warm water and virtually no pressure, which continued for throughout the trip. Rinsing my hair was a lesson in determination, it took forever, the pressure would barely rinse the soap from your body. The outdoor pool areas were like nothing I have ever seen or experienced...The South Tower pool, hot tub and lazy river were dirty with a scuzzy film floating in the water and in great disrepair. The North Tower pool was much cleaner. I did not utilize the Kid's Water Play area, so I can't comment on the condition. The Turtle's Nest Tiki Bar opened around 11am and closed between 2:30 and 4:00pm...I would think the hours would line up, more closely, with the pool hours, which were posted as 8:15 to midnight. On our first morning, our group was perplexed by the line of people we observed forming on the sidewalk, beginning at around 7am. Imagine our surprise as we watched the uniformed security guards (south tower) and resort-attired personnel (north tower) begin to appear. At 8am...the guards/personnel stepped up, announced his wish that everyone should "Have A Great Day" to which those gathered on the sidewalk and steps responded by jumping barrier chains and bolting to chairs and tables. Often arguments and disagreements followed, which the personnel of either were unwilling to mediate. So, if you want a chair or table on the pool deck, plan to show up around 7am, get yourself in line and then behave like an NFL front lineman to claim a spot. This happens every morning, without fail. We fondly referred to this process as "The running of the Bulls". If you don't mind afternoon pool activity in the shade, you can show up around 2:30pm, as those wishing to enjoy the sun begin to vacate the area due to the buildings shading the entire area from 2:30pm until dark. Over the course of our seven day stay we began to hear other guests grumbling and complaining about various issues. We were also able to gather a great deal of info about the issues. The front desk personnel were routinely hateful and prone to a "pass the buck" attitude. It was here that one explained to me that the South Tower Homeowners Association and the Wyndham Resort are engaged in a law suit, therefore the staff is there to service the North Tower and is unavailable for the South Tower Guests, with the exception of things which they choose to do (check-in). Which explains why the personnel is unable to cross the invisible line on the sidewalk, answer questions, provide assistance, or even conduct themselves in a professional manner. It was a nightmare...they even have segregated lost and found areas. (ie...if you are staying in So. Tower, lose an item, an No. Tower Guest finds said item, turns it in to the front desk, you must contact So. Tower Security, have their personnel agree to contact No. Tower Security to inquire and retrieve item (if found) and then hope that So. Tower Security (third party firm) returns item to you, the rightful owner. Parking...The property owner who I rented from was clear and adamant that parking would be provided for only one vehicle per unit...I understand, it is peak season and parking is at a premium. Imagine my surprise when we returned to the property on Wednesday evening (approx 10pm) following dinner and were greeted by "Garage Full" Signs. The attendant said we should obtain an additional pass from the front desk. Clerk informed me that the on-site garages were full, gave me a 12 hour voucher for the public garage across the street, stating they can only park 90% of occupants and if I wish to park on-site I need to have my vehicle in the garage by 7pm. Along with a stern lecture that the car should be moved in a timely manner as they would not be responsible for additional fees, outside the 12 hours. The homeowner, from whom we rented, was very clear...One Pass for On-Site Parking...When we retrieved our vehicle at 8:30am, the following morning, there was a nasty note on the windshield about overnight parking and a chalk time written in the corner of the front windshield. It is our family tradition to rent scooters for one 24 hour period while vacationing in Daytona Beach. This has never been a problem, the other resorts allow you to park these very small vehicles in an out of the way corner of the garage without issue or conflict...NOT SO AT OCEAN WALK! We even offered to park them in the same spot with our vehicle...which was more than possible given the vehicle size...The response was if you do that we will tow one or both vehicles. We returned the rented vehicle and thanks to Julie we were able to amend our rental agreement and avoid a total loss of prepaid fees. Thanks Julie! So are ya keeping up so far,..In-line for pool chair no later than 7am...Vehicle in the garage by 7pm...No parking of Fun Rentals. The bottom line is this...This facility could be top-notch but they are far from that...Divisiveness among the "Powers-That-Be" have created an unfriendly, almost hostile atmosphere ... What a shame! We are only a group of 9, but we won't be back...when I am on vacation the last thing I want is to be drawn into and effected by someone else's drama and conflict...No Thanks...I will return to a resort where it's all R & R!

<Title>“AWESOME EXPERIENCE”
<Content>Location, Location, Location! I am a long time visitor to Daytona and this is "THE PLACE" to stay. This is not a run down property. It is very nice considering that it is on the beach front. Salt air, sand and wet bodies make it hard to maintain a place like you would your home but Wyndham did not disapoint, it is clean, well kept and family friendly. I started my check in by asking the front desk ladies if they were going to mean to me like all the cry babies on trip advisor had warned of, they laughed and said they treat people right until they are unfair to them. My check in was flawless and friendly. The pools are GREAT! Yes chairs can be hard to find but I just looked and moved the ones that were empty. WOW, all the fuss on here and all it required was a little creative thinking. Elevators will get jammed if you drag your slow butt towards them when it rains but if you anticipate and go in a few minutes before the rush then NO PROBLEM! I do not work at or for Wyndham, I just want to be sure this place gets a fair review. I almost didnt book because of the internet cry babies and my family would have missed the best vacation we have ever had. This is an incredible property for the price. You will enjoy it.

<Title>“Check In process is BRUTAL”
<Content>The check in process is BRUTAL. There was a long line of people waiting to check in (and this was at the pre-registraion desk) and only 2 people working the counter. Check in took about an hour. The pool area is very crowded and you need to get down early if you are planning to get a chair on the pool deck. Also, be prepared to wait for elevators.. very slow. Overall, very clean and nice. The view was amazing and once we were all checked in and in our room we had a great time, just a slow painful start.

<Title>“Review from 13 year old boy.”
<Content>I went there a few years ago (I'm 13, but this is all true) and it was very nice, friendly staff, I had a bug-free room, and the beach was (and is) spectacular. They have shoppes, restaurants, and a movie theater connected to the resort. The resort has two pools, a lazy river and a water slide. When I went back, well, I'm writing this close to the resort, this was our last day:(. Anyway, the staff wasn't  as nice, they just seemed, so, pooped out? Pools and oceans all the same, and the shoppes also. I over heard people talking about cockroaches there, and, "It was so disgusting!" (Actual quote). Then after a legendary search throughout the land/resort for the mythical vending machines [Though I was unsuccessful (another downer)] I went back to my room, my mom said she saw a roach( Not in the room). Overall, it's a nice place, better than most.

<Title>“We loved our 5 days at Oceanwalk but there need to be some improvements before we would go back....”
<Content>There are several shortcomings that got in the way of a perfect holiday.... ** the shortage of enough elevators led to frustrating long waits...climbing ten floors with two babies was just not enjoyable but it became necessary ** lack of seating and poor furniture quality ....we rented a 3 bedroom and only had 4 seats in the living area ** lack of supervision for the lazy river made it not only dangerous but uncomfortable..kids without tubes were out of control and made taking the 2 year old on tube with us very dangerous and uncomfortable....the rules clearly state a tube must be used.... ** our 3 bedroom condo ( room 1023 in north tower ) is in need of a spruce up.....rug stains/ missing slats in air cond unit wall/ very tired couch/ paint missing over drywall repairs led to a run down feeling ** we had three families in a 3 bedroom unit but could only get one parking spot ** the resort is actually excellent for what we wanted ----- a family hangout with no schedules or pressure to do things...the location is excellent...we did not have to get in our car once as everything is right there ...the promenade and no drive zone beach are perfect....strolling the promenade in the evening was very safe....fireworks anf concert on Sat were superb....

<Title>“Poorly managed”
<Content>Our trip started off with a 30 minute wait in line to check in. Apparently it's like that all the time according to the front desk clerks. Seems the management could come up with an improved system. Then our room was missing pillow cases and wash cloths. No tissues anywhere either. The icing on the cake was getting back from a day trip at 1:00 am and being told the garage was full in our tower and being told to park down the street. (As a female traveling alone with 2 teenage girls I was very uncomfortable walking on the streets of Daytona Beach at that time of night.) For what I spent on the room I will stay someplace else in the future. There was wi-fi in the lobby only.

<Title>“Extremely Disappointed!”
<Content>After much research, we decided to book this hotel for the beach portion of our summer vacation. Upon our arrival, the Bellman was very polite and directed me to the lobby for check in. As I entered the lobby, there were two desk, neither was marked, so I stopped at the first one and stated that I needed to check in...the lady there was very matter of fact in telling me that I needed to go to the other desk behind me...At the check in desk, there were three employees who were huddled together chatting, laughing, and ignoring me! I had to request that someone come help me...one of the guys came over to assist, but during my entire check in process, he continued to chat it up with the other associates...their conversation went something like this, "she just came over here and turned the ringer on our phones up, well, as soon as she leaves today, we're going to turn them back down"! I asked the guy were we were to park, he acted like I just asked him to tote all of our luggage up 18 flights of stairs all at once, by himself! Once in our room, the accommodations were OK, but there were no washcloths...we made several attempts to phone the front desk for washcloths, but no one answered! We also noticed that the door appeared to had been previously "kicked in" and there was mold around the knob in the shower, there was also a toothbrush holder in the bathroom that was disgusting! The pool has several missing tiles around the edges and is overfilled, my husband, who is 6ft tall, was not able to touch the bottom of the pool at all! There was enough hair floating around in the pool to make a wig and there was mold growing in every place possible around the pool and on the stairs to the slide! I will definitely find a different place to stay if we ever visit Dayton Beach again!

<Title>“Like camping”
<Content>We went to a seminar with Gary Smalley years ago. He said to build family memories by putting your family in situations where you have to overcome adversities. He mentioned camping. I think this hotel qualifies in place of camping. After we checked in and mentioned to the people trying to sell us a timeshare how bad the rooms were, they told us the hotel is divided into two parts. The north tower and the upper part of the south tower are managed by Wyndham Resorts, and the first 12 floors of the south tower are managed by Wyndham Hotels. So you have a 30% chance of getting a really bad room. The resort rooms are periodically updated. The hotel rooms look very old. Resort rooms have granite granite countertops. Hotel rooms have Formica. Stains on the couch. Really bad stains on the curtains. The one thing that was recently updated was the washer. The hotel gives you one set of towels for the entire stay, so we were washing towels. The drain was not hooked up on the washer, so when it went to the spin cycle, it drained the water onto the carpet. Maintenance did come and get most of the water out, but it was still pretty wet. They didn't have fans to dry the carpet. They didn't offer to move us to another room. They told us to run the ceiling fan to dry it out. (Seriously, they actually told us that.) The carpet was still wet enough three days later that it would get our socks wet if we walked on the carpet without shoes. The window view reminded me of a motel. It looked out into the hallway and onto a rooftop. If you actually opened the curtains, you would have watched the people walk by your room (and they would have watched you in your room). The hall way smelled like urine, especially in the afternoon when the sun was shining in on it. (I guess that's like camping too, just go behind a tree.) No free internet in the rooms, but they do have it in the lobby area. Dave Ramsey says to avoid the time share traps. Instead, pay a little more and enjoy your vacation. Unfortunately, we followed Glenn Frey's financial advice, "It's the lure of easy money, it's got a very strong appeal." My advice if you do take the bait is to review the timeshare users group forum before you go. Some very good advice on that website. Bottom line, if you do buy, buy on the secondary market and don't borrow money to do it. Anything positive? The lobby area was nice. Pool and beach were good. Pictures posted on this website.

<Title>“Tips if you stay here”
<Content>We stayed here on a saturday through a monday in July. The Good- The hotel has nice finishes and the room we stayed in was clean, well designed and fairly up to date. I liked that it had a small kithcen as opposed to just being a hotle room. The pool is beautiful and there are lots of amenities such as beach towel service, kids activities, two indoor pools, a nice gym, snack bar at the pool, etc. Daytona also puts on a great fireworks display every friday night that you can see from your balcony. The BAD- Its a timeshare and they will pressure you to buy a timeshare. They will run your check in credit card info to access your credit report and then offer you financing for the timeshare. Thinking of buiying a time share? Ask a realtor if thery really are a "great investment". I am very much opposed to buying them, but I love to rent from teh people that do own them. But back to the review.... Also, be preparred for a horrible check-in experience. Lines and waiting. Other Guests- There were a lot of other guests. The pool and lazy river were so crowded that it made me not want to get in. This was likely due to us going at the most busy time of year- Im sure its probably not as crowded in the fall/winter. There were way more smokers than I am used to. I have a new baby, so I was not happy to be surrounded by smokers in the pool area. Daytona seems to be trying to move past thier "bike week" reputaiton and attract more families throught the year. The guests at the hotel were representative of this transition. It was not uncommon to see guests in the elevators with open containers in the evening, but no one seemed to be overindulging or acting in an offensive manner. TIPS= -If you book via a "third party" like orbitz or kayak or hotels.com be sure to confirm your reservation. There was a "glitch" in our reservation and if I had not called to confirm we would have gotten there and not had a room -They say check-in is at 4, but the earlier you arrive the better and more likely you are to recieve the oceanfront you booked. You can "pre-check in" any time and then show you your ID in ANOTHER line after 4 to get your room key. I suggest waiting until 5 to get the key so the line dies down. -When returning from the pool/beach, go down to the lower level and get on the elevators at the LL level. You will skip the wait on the main lobby level and not have to parade the lobby in your swim suit. Expect long waits at the elevator at check in. - Get a great rate by booking your room through someone who owns a timeshare there. there are a bunch of timeshare rental sites where owners post. When we stayed they were asking $900 for a 2 bedroom for a week as a last minute deal. If you can go last minute, you might be able to get a deal.

<Title>“Things have changed”
<Content>My family has been spending LAbor day weekend at Ocean Walk Resort for the past 6 or 7 years. We spend this time with 3 other families. A tradition that started 20 years ago. Our experience has always been pleasant. However when my family spent the July 4th weekend at Ocean Walk the experience was not as pleasant. Our checkin time was to be at 4:00pm but we were not able to get into our room until 5:30pm. The problem other than a inconvience was having to stand in the long checkin line 3 times to be told our room was not ready. We had my one year old granddaughter with us and we had no place for her to take a nap. On the other hand we were allowed to spend time at the pool and enjoy that and we were grateful for that. Also in the past there has been security supervision at the pool. This was absent and the "lazy river" was dangerous at times. There wre children and teen in the river without floatation tubes which made the ride somewhat less than relaxing. I felt that a small child was going to be ran over and injured and no one would know,

<Title>“Have gone for years, but this time was awful!”
<Content>We have loved the Ocean Walk resort year after year. Now they are only interested in promoting their time share. They called early one morning and woke us up to see if we would attend the 9am time share presentation after telling them no upon check-in.They would not accommodate us in any way. For 6 weeks I tried to add a night to my existing reservation. They told me they had availability, but that I would have to book a new reservation and there would be a two night minimum so I could simply extend my reservation by one night. Check out is PROMPTLY at 10 am- don't ask for an extra hour! Resort still has great amenities for young kids, but at a hefty price and AWFUL customer service. Beds not very luxurious! Only one parking pass per room even if you have a three bedroom unit! You have to pay $20 a nite across the street and ether are no in/out privilieges.

<Title>“Ocean Walk and it's issues put a damper on my honeymoon!”
<Content>We decided to go to Ocean Walk for part of our honeymoon. We loved Bonnet Creek and Glacier Canyon so we knew we were going to enjoy Ocean Walk.....wrong! Our ocean view room was given away since we did not flag it a "do not move." No where was that stated on their page. So we were upset about that. Then we were suppose to check in as VIP's and their VIP counter was not staffed (we learned later from several staff members that they were understaffed). We went to our room and everything at that point looked great. After a day on the beach and receiving wrong directions from a guest service representative to the local Walmart, we decided to seek out their out door bar by the pools and ocean. It was closed at 3pm due to understaffing (a staff member pointed this out). Then we decided to walk on the beach and go to dinner. When returning to the hotel room at 9:30ish we turned back the covers to find clear sticky stuff all over the sheets. I called housekeeping for a new set. It took over an hour and a half for them to arrive. My husband then decided to take a shower and the shower head was sitting on the soap dish in the shower stall and would not attach. A call to maintenance. Another hour + wait. My husband called to speak to a manger and the clerk said she would call right back. NOTHING. The next morning we went to seek out a manager. On the way we noticed a foul smell coming from the vending room. We think it was the sewer. The manager talked to us and did admit staff problems and wants to send us a two night stay on them for our problems. We will not be going back...why? Let me tell you....He had us go to a new room the next day. It was ocean view so we were happy until we saw the comforter which had a brown crusty matter on it....eeeewwww! Housekeeping brought us a blanket instead and took the comforter. Then at night I got up to go to the bathroom and found roaches everywhere. I also checked the kitchen...roaches. We researched them when we got home and they look like German Roaches. I frantically called a manager in the morning. She said she would move us AGAIN and would have someone write or call corporate and we would get a copy of the letter. NOPE! Never received that. Also we caught two of the roaches and gave them to the manager. The next manager had us wait for our room and when we did move an exterminator was waiting for us to move our things out and so another day wasted. The last room was also an ocean view but by this time we did not care. All we wanted was to get out of there and to go home and toss our luggage so we did not bring home those roaches. We went to Wyndham Bonnet Creek after Ocean walk and loved it there!! Never had issues at any other Wyndham resorts or hotels!! We love Wyndham....never again will we stay at Ocean Walk...it is not Wyndham quality at all!

<Title>“Great family hotel”
<Content>This was our third trip with our kids, 8 and 6. The location and accommodations are great for families, and this property has a few points worth noting. The location is excellent; it is close to the boardwalk and many places to eat and shop. Although DB is a place where beachgoers can drive right onto the sand, the beach in front of the Wyndham is closed to traffic, making it a bit safer for the kids. There are umbrellas and beach chairs available for rent for about $25 a day (umbrella and 2 chairs). The pool area is large and is well shaded in the afternoon by the building. There is a kiddie pool that will hold the tots' attention. The beach bar and grill has food for kids and adults with decent prices, but seating gets tough to find at lunch time so plan accordingly. This is a "Wyndham Vacation Resort," (timeshare unit hotel), not a full-service hotel so there is not daily housekeeping or towel service. Be prepared to wash your own towels with the in-room stacked W/D; they provide Tide laundry detergent. Sometimes check-in can be slow but overall I have been pleased with that part of the experience. There is free covered on-site secure parking for one vehicle per unit. There is no consistency with the attitude of staff; some are very pleasant and some are not pleasant at all. The free wireless internet is available in the lobby only. The rooms are fine. There is a decent amount of room in the bedroom and living room unless the couch is pulled out. The furnishings are not luxurious and the bed is not so comfy but everything has always been clean and average for a three-star motel. The balcony is roomy and the outdoor furniture is low quality but the view is unadulterated if you get an oceanfront suite. The "One-bedroom Suite" will never have an ocean view. You have to book an "Oceanfront Suite" to get the view. If you have an issue or complaint that should be resolved, the staff has never been accommodating. We have never had any major issue, however, and have enjoyed each trip. What keeps us coming back are the location on the beach, the lazy river, water slide, the view, and the layout of the room.

<Title>“WE were disappointed !!!”
<Content>I know Daytona Beach is sliding, but staying at this Wyndham did not help. We had a two bedroom deluxe suite which was worth about $125.00 per night not $300.00 The screen fell off and was never fixed, the plumbing leaked, the appointments were dated and spartan. The pool deck needs paint TOMORROW. The bullnose around the pool was filled with cracks. Sadly the pool had one bar and no waitresses walking the deck so getting a drink became an adventure, but not a vacation. Worst of all there were hundreds of children all over and no where for them to get anything to eat in the hotel except a little,side "EATERY" which closed at 9PM. Seriously, what is with that, it's SUMMER! The main bar was open occasionally when the bartender wasn't "Filling In" at the outside bar. Really a poor image here! Sorry, we may well be back to Daytona next year with the National Dance groups, but we will not be staying at this Wyndham unless management has an epiphany SOON !!!!!

<Title>“Wyndham Ocean Walk, Daytona Beach”
<Content>Wyndham Ocean Walk is on a great area of the beach were there a lot of things to do and places to eat that are really only walking distance away from the hotel. Obviously the beach was terrific and the weather was perfect in April, so we had a great stay. We really enjoyed the pools even though the lazy river was closed for renovation. Being on the coast, we did some great day trips and saw some great sights in nearby cities. The entire Daytona Beach vacation experience was definitely rated a four, but Wyndham clearly needs to make some upgrades to their units.

<Title>“We really enjoyed our stay!”
<Content>At check in the employees were very nice, inviting and helpful. You have to go to another front desk to pick up your wrist bands for the pool and hotel facilities which they ask a few questions and offer discounts to sit through a 90 min presentation if interested in owning one of their condos. The people here were very nice and courteous with no pressuring whatsoever. I had booked the room online as a package and it came with free breakfast, restaurant coupon, and two movie tickets. Nobody knew of this package, but the manager that day took care of the situation and had coupons for the hotel facilities delivered to the room. Next day the manager on duty called and informed me my other benefits were waiting at the service desk. I can't say enough about how helpful and welcoming the people were at the front desks. The only issue we had is that the condo we had was very outdated and had not been thoroughly cleaned. The TV in the masterbedroom had the power button busted out and the remote would not work to turn it on. I called maintenance and they were right there to correct this issue and mentioned these type TVs were going to be replaced soon, just not before our stay. The kids had plenty to do with all the amenities here and stayed busy all day and night. Overall we had a very enjoyable and pleasant stay and really liked it here.

<Title>“Be Smart if you rent here.....”
<Content>My family of 4 just returned from a week stay at the Wyndham - Daytona Beach. The grounds, beach, area are all fabulous. The rooms and many of the staff are not. If renting again, I would request a renovated condo. I paid $180+ a night for a room that was completely subpar to friends down the hall who paid the same. Issues included: non-working door lock/key issues, filthy cleaning job, dirty carpet, sinks that wouldn't drain, terrible pull out couch (3 inch thick mattress), front desk staff - females were not friendly, rude, not willing to assist. The area is great, lots of restaurants, shopping, beautiful beach and friendly staff there (not part of the resort). Some staffmembers were wonderful (maintenance and security). Some issues we reported, some we did not, based on how busy and out of control the resort appeared in trying to deal with number of guests. Overall, the room we stayed in (1806) was gross, but the outside and area were fabulous.

<Title>“This is a great place to stay, just two small issues but we would come back.”
<Content>My husband and I stayed here with two other couples. Wyndham was able to ensure that we all had rooms on the same floor and close to each other. The rooms were perfect, like small apartments!!! Everything was in the room that you needed: two TVs, a fully stocked kitchen, jacuzzi tub, balcony overlooking the beach and comfy bed & couch. It was so nice to have all the pools and be right on the ocean. Everything was so convenient. The only two small issues we had were the elevators and the parking garage. The parking garage is really small so be careful if you bring a big vehicle. The elevators were the worse I have seen. They only had four elevators for 25 floors and there were times when we had to wait a good twenty minutes to get one. Most of the time, the wait was five to ten minutes but I still think that is crazy. With as many rooms as they have, they need more elevators to accommodate all the people.

<Title>“3rd Stay at this Resort”
<Content>It is hit or miss with a room at this resort. Some of the rooms are completely remodeled and others need updating. This is my 3rd stay and while the rooms are very nice, this is the 2nd time we had a room where the bathroom was in desperate need of an upgrade. The shower was old and door on the shower appeared unclean. The microwave didn't work and the first night we didn't have air conditioning. The service was great though and as soon as we alerted the front desk, they had someone come up to fix both within the hour. 10am is a little early for a checkout, as most of the resorts we stay at have an 11am checkout. All of the front desk staff are a little pushy about attending the sales pitch for Timeshare but they do offer a cash incentive to attend - if you want to sit through 2 hours of an extremely hard selling presentation. The pool and resort itself are fantastic.

<Title>“Stayed here many times before and loved it.....not so pleased this time”
<Content>We come to Daytona every year because we love the beaches and over the last 3 or 4 years have always stayed at OceanWalk and loved it. The property is a bit more pricey than other places we could stay but have always felt the extra cost was worth staying there because the facilities were so nice and convenient. However, this time not so much. We decided to stay two weeks this year and the first room we were given was not clean and was showing signs of much wear and tear without being updated. We were moved to a second room but this room was as bad. The sofa and chair in the living area were dirty, the carpet was stained and dirty, and the drapes were extremely dirty, the handle on the door exiting to the balcony was completely broken off and had to be replaced, the bathtub was stopped up and would not drain during showers. We could not be moved to another room again because we were staying two weeks and they could not find another unit that was available for that period of time without being moved several times during the stay. We are not usually ones to complain, but we paid $2,300 for two weeks at this property when it was worth half that at best. We understand that properties begin to age but dirty is not acceptable. Probably will not be returning unless major upgrades and changes are made.

<Title>“Unfriendly staff, disappointed with service, or lack of....will not be back!!”
<Content>We were on the 16th floor in a room that had a burnt hole in the middle of the carpet. The bathroom counter was falling apart, the particle board was literally crumbling. Poor water pressure, not enough pillows. Need I say more. Children running around in wet swimsuits in the lobby, playing on the elevators and stopping at every floor. Teenagers wondering in off the streets, who shouldn’t be there anyways! Not enough security staff. They do not replace your towels, even if they are sandy and wet, the teenager working behind the desk (really texting behind the desk with her feet on the counter) said "There is no way we can do that for everyone." So we had to use the same towels for 3 days. I would like to add that it was very close to the ocean walk and our view was nice, also the pool was nice. Still I will not be back, paid a ridiculous price to be miserable.

<Title>“Nice place, but some drawbacks to deal with”
<Content>Get there way before check-in time to HOPE for an ocean front room because rooms are not assigned prior to check-in. Very few luggage carts avail, only 4 elevators for 25 floors in the North tower. Spent lots of time waiting for an elevator and walking around the resort becacuse is it very spacious, which is nice, but getting from your condo to the front desk can take about 10 min, then you usuallly had to wait to get service after that. We stayed in the North tower which was recently updated I think--everything was new, clean and nice. However, the jets on our jacuzzi were horrible, and the phone jack in the master bedroom didn't work. They sent a repair man up for the phone, but who wants all that going on while you are trying to enjoy a vacation? The lazy river holds 30 floats, but bring your own because they barely have 20. Slim chance of getting a chair by any of the 3 pools unless you put your towel there at 8am. Oh, and due to the resort's tall buildings you won't get any sun by the pool after 2pm. You have to move to the edges of the property or go out on the beach. Parking was okay, unless you come in after 9pm. With all that in mind, I would stay again but next time I'll be more prepared.

<Title>“From "A+" to "B-" rating”
<Content>This was our 2nd stay at Ocean Walk. The 1st time we were really impressed with the family-friendly environment, A+. We made our reservations for this spring vacation about 1 month in advance. We requested, and were confirmed for, an "ocean-front" 2 bedroom suite. When we checked in they gave us the key to an "ocean-view" room, North Tower, 24th Floor. We showed our confirmation number and the receipt from Ocean Walk but we were told the reservation should not have been made. Sounds like "bait and switch" to me. We were directly above 2 very large, very noisy air conditioning units. We could not keep the door open because of the noise. I wrote a complaint letter but have still have not heard back. I do not want a refund or discount, just an apology. We will not be staying there again. P.S. The "ocean-view" room was nicely appointed, but it was not what we wanted.

<Title>“Great location, decent experience.”
<Content>I stayed here for a week with my extended family in June 2011, about two years after a two-night stay in late 2009 (I felt that I didn't stay long enough last time to review it properly then). Admittedly, the first impression this time was not a particularly good one; the check-in lines were abnormally long-- even the VIP Express lane. To our disappointment, we were given only one parking pass; the other car in our party had to pay for overnight parking in a garage across the street, and the customer service associate didn't seem particularly helpful or sympathetic about the situation. The service manager did rectify the problem the next day, however. The hotel's location is right in the thick of things; it's right next door to the Ocean Walk Shoppes (with several "upscale casual" restaurants like Bubba Gump Shrimp Co.), and a short walk from the Boardwalk and the Pier. There is a Burger King, two pizza places, a Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks within a three-minute-walking radius. The only negative I can think of about the location is that the only way to exit the parking area is a right turn onto Atlantic Avenue (divided highway), so travelers must go down a couple of stoplights before making a U-turn, which is thankfully legal in Florida. Our room was a 3-bedroom suite, the largest type available at this facility. Except for the rather well-used couch, the interior was in good repair, and the bathrooms showed no sign of mold or mildew. The full kitchen is well-stocked with cookware; I recommend using it for breakfast and the occasional lunch, in order to save money versus the rather high prices in the on-site deli. A definite improvement from 2009 is the availability of free WiFi in the rooms. Don't get too excited; signal coverage is sometimes spotty and can vary from point to point inside the units, and speed is not particularly fast-- good enough for a Facebook status update or e-mail check, but video streaming is not feasible for extended viewing. Those of you who are worried about the pool's current state of repair because of recent reviews, worry no more. All pool facilities are now fully operational. I've included a photo of the "lazy river" and pool with waterslide; both were running just fine the entire time. There is a second full-size pool and gated kiddie splash area, which helped ensure that no pool was ever too crowded, even though this was during peak season. The pool deck could have used a couple dozen more chairs though; they were indeed in short supply. I marked the Sleep Quality down as "average". The beds are comfortable enough, but the fact that this is a high-rise facility virtually guarantees that another guest is above you, and is likely to have a different sleep pattern and/or occasionally rowdy children or teenagers. Overall, though, it is a decent place for a beach-centered vacation.

<Title>“Second time there and the whole family enjoyed it”
<Content>This was our second trip to Wyndham Ocean Walk. This time we had an ocean front room rather than an ocean view room. The room was great. Glass doors leading to a long balcony from both the living room and master bedroom. It was very nice! We brought our own towels so we did not have to worry about checking out towels and always being afraid that we would lose one and get charged the $20 or $25 each. The pools were not as heated as I thought they would be, but we managed fine. The Lazy river was broken, but was to be up and running 1 week after we left. The kids were very disappointed. During this visit we noticed there were no security guards walking around the pool. Last year, we saw a security guard always around the pool deck. We like to see the security and hope that they bring them back. It seems to keep everyone in line a little better when there is a security presence. We love walking to the ocean walk shops and retaurants. We feel that staying here is like taking a cruise, while on land. We all loved it and cannot wait until we go back.

<Title>“I love the amenities!”
<Content>I do own a time share at this resort as of August 2010. So far we have stayed twice at this resort and have enjoyed both stays. We love the out door pools and being right on the ocean. As you look from the balcony, none of the surrounding properties has the outdoor amenities that this resort has. Yes, it probably is dated. But, I am there for a week and it is still so much better than hotels. As such, it is a time share and you can pay for additional housekeeping services. I personally like that people do not come in and out of my room and the wash/dryer gives me all the fresh linens I need. With the visit in May all the staff was very friendly. The bellman was a wonderful find at the end of the trip. The activities for the children/families is great! I am not overly picky about furnishing as I am not buying them as long as they work. I do recommend this hotel as a great place to relax!

<Content>Stayed there last year and loved it . This year not happy hardly any activities as last year. Asked for trash bags and didn't receive them until the next day! Not enough staff working there. Not enough luggage carts, elevators horrible had to wait at least 15 minutes. Not enough chairs at the pool you have to go down by 8 am or you don't get one! There are only 196 chairs for over 700 rooms! The room was very spacious we had a 2 bedroom deluxe although we had ants in the bathrooms. Location is excellent shops restaurants boardwalk all within walking distance.

<Title>“Fabulous time...great staff!!”
<Content>My husband and I were finally able to use a wedding gift from 2.5yrs ago for a week stay in Daytona Beach, FL at the Wyndham! I was really skeptical having read all of the reviews, but to my surprise it was one of the most relaxing vacations that we have taken. The check in was smooth, but that may have been due to the fact that we checked in on a Sunday. We were on the 9th floor in the North tower and the unit was beautiful with a breathtaking view! Most things are actually in the South tower, but easy to access. The elevators were very slow though, so you will have to be a little patient. My husband and I actually took the stairs a couple of times because we didn't want to wait, but they are not well labeled, so you may have to hunt. The parking garage was packed with vehicles, but we expected that. Each level of the garage is accessible to the elevators by going through a side door. Our unit was top notch. Our gift was given to us by people who own a timeshare through the Wyndham, so I wonder if that made a bit of a difference with the shape of the unit. The only complaint with the room that I had was a little mold around the shower head in the main room. Otherwise it was excellent from the view to the bed and its comfort! The bar is only open a little after 11pm, but the bartender in the evening was fabulous! The drinks were great and he sparked conversation with ease. I think his name was Micheal. The Turtle's Nest out by the pool is great too! They do start serving food at 11am, but stop around 4pm, yet drinks were available until around 6pm. The shops next door were handy and nice to access. We enojoyed walking down the boardwalk and taking it all in!! The Mai Tai Bar is next door and I believe they have happy after 7pm!!! We didn't go, but I am sure it is a deal. That is now my favorite drink!! So, please DO NOT go to Napoli pizza acrossed the street! They have horrible customer service and I think the sauce is actually tomato paste!! Restaurants in the area that I have to recommend are: Crabby Joe's-- Sunglow Pier! We ate there twice!! Excellent view and food! Oyster Pub-for yummy oysters and a sportslike atmosphere..be aware the drinks are Not strong...beer a better choice! Tailgators- Up A1A a bit from the Wyndham, Karoke Sunday nights and great food! You will be amazed at the Gator Bites appetizer. Ocean Deck- A short walk a way from the hotel and very popular! Great drinks and Great food!! Old City Pizza-Great oven brick pizza and they deliver to the lobby of the hotel!! Barnacles-Grouper like you have never had it! Ker's Wing House- Great salad and wings! They are different than we are used to the wings here in the Northeast. Bubba Gump Shrimp- great for lunch!! Sloppy Joe's- Also great for lunch The beach is 26 miles long and nobody can own a part of Daytona Beach!! This makes it quite accessible and really enjoyable if you want to go to a section where there isn't a lot of people! We drove almost to Ponce Inlet to find a nice area of the beach where we felt spaced out and could enjoy taking a nap and relaxing. I would recommend the Wyndham with or without Children....they have so many things for the kids to do it is impressive! We would really go back in a heartbeat! Thank you!

<Title>“Not a good place to stay for business travelers.”
<Content>The purpose of my trip was business and I would rate this property low based on that fact. I have stayed at a few other hotels on Daytona Beach and decided to select the Wyndham Ocean Walk based on the Wyndham brand and thought it would be a nice place for the money. There were some positive aspects about my stay. Those being, proximity to Ocean Walk shops/restaurants, overall the property was nice, and the rooms were cleaner than other hotel rooms I have stayed at on Daytona Beach. There were more negatives for me including no free WIFI, no daily housekeeping service, no desk in the room to work from, tiles in the room were not installed correctly, and also I found some things in the room left behind by previous tenants. The daily housekeeping alone would not have been a deal breaker, but it would have been nice to have fresh towels. I had to request them twice from the front desk. I would not recommend this place to a business traveller.

<Title>“Enjoyed our stay... Even with the Love Bugs. :^)”
<Content>I travel quite often and was very skeptical after reading the reviews but our stay turned out just fine. We waited maybe 15 minutes at check in. Our room wasn’t ready but the guy was very nice and offered us another room on a lower floor in the south tower. No complaints about the room. Understandably, each room houses several hundred people per year so there are a few minor glitches but nothing like some of the poorly written reviews. The bugs everyone are talking about are called LOVE BUGS! We asked because they were everywhere (even in our room). Unfortunately, we were told they are seasonal and there nothing anyone is the state of Florida can really do about them. The love bugs don’t bite but are annoying. We live in Chicago so we understood their frustration with the love bugs due to our experience with cicadas. The timeshare people did call us once. My boyfriend simply told them we were in town on vacation and he wasn’t sure of our schedule. Needless to say, they didn’t call again. We called guest services in need of a crib for our 15 month old and they brought one up in roughly 20 minutes (with clean linen). Your key is needed at all times to enter the facility and beach area – no biggie. If your used to room service, stay at a hotel that offers so. This is a timeshare resort, so I knew they were not going to provide room service. I actually packed lighter and washed clothes half way through the trip. Overall, our trip was enjoyable.

<Title>“Great location; but not worth the price”
<Content>The Ocean Walk hotel has what might be the best location in Daytona. Private beach (no driving), indoor & outdoor pools, and is right next to a shopping/dining village. The problem starts when you look a little closer. We were 'hit up' 2 different days ( 4 day visit) to view their timeshare presentation. Not to worry; 4 days there meant we would never buy a vacation unit there. Guests are required to wear bracelets/anklets provided by the hotel at all times so that security can keep the amenities limited to guests/owners only. And yes, there was plenty of security patrolling the area. However, they had a habit of walking right past the 'fence hoppers' without seeing them. It didn't take Sherlock Holmes to find the interlopers; they were all locals with better tans than anyone else at the pool, none of them had id bracelets, they were drinking like fish, cussing up a storm, and smoking as if the nicotine was oxygen (and using the pools for an ashtray). When we notified security, the response was "yeah, we figured they weren't guests. Why, are they bothering you?" Yes, when i'm paying $200 per night, it bothers me. In the future, I would only stay here if the price was VERY good.

<Title>“Nice enough place, but terrible customer service”
<Content>This was our third visit to Wyndham Ocean Walk and what a disappointment. Always before the place had been immaculate and customer service had been excellent. I'm not sure what happened, but our room appeared to be run down, the furniture had stains, and the bathroom was not very clean. On top of that, the customer service was pathetic. There was one server working in the "Turtles Nest" poolside bar/restaurant and the wait at times was 20 minutes. Also one server working in the Eatery on a Saturday morning. She was very frazzled and even rude. A friend who was traveling with us said she received the same rude attitude from the lady who was distributing pool towels. There were fewer pool chairs than there had been on our past two visits and if you weren't at the pool by 8:30 am, you could forget getting a chair. There are way to few elevators for the size of the hotel. They were ridiculously overcrowded and once after waiting 15 minutes for an elevator, we decided to climb the 15 flights of stairs to get to our room. I'm not sure when/if we will go back.

<Title>“A Great Family Getaway”
<Content>We had four one-bedroom units for a family getaway. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with all the amenities we needed. Oceanwalk is close to everything and the kids love the pool and lazy river. Of course, Daytona Beach is the best around hands down. We had a little pressure to sit through a sales presentation, but did not attend. The parking situation leave much to be desired as they have more units than available parking. Also, there are too few elevators to serve the two towers which results in long waits for elevator service. Check-in and check-out would be improved if more valet carts were made available. We doubt we'll go back on a holiday weekend. Too crowded.

<Title>“Wont ever go back!”
<Content>This hotel while pretty on the outside was falling apart and overcrowded on the inside. Upon check in I was required to give them 150 credit card deposit, being seasoned travelers we are used to most places asking if you want to put something down for ammenities I have never been forced to before. When asking why this was necessary the front desk lady actually rolled her eyes and said," its just policy ." Being its a timeshare resort they really want you to sit thru the presentation on how awesome the place is and while they say there is no pressure to go they call you constantly. The pool was gorgeous and we enjoyed that until a security guard told me I couldnt save seats..while I tried to explain that my husband and daughter were in the pool he refused to believe me and tried to give my family's seats away. Next insult came when we left the grounds for dinner just to return to be told we couldnt park in the structure because it was full and to park in public parking where we would not have to pay for parking but the hotel would give us a voucher in the morning. Morning came and the front desk did not believe that we parked our car in the structure. They wanted us to give them our car information when I told them I had no idea what my plate number was that I wrote it down when we first got there so they had it on file they told me that my point was irrevelant and they needed it and stared at me as if I was trying to rob the place...I tossed them my insurance card and said here is my VIN thats the best I can do now give me a voucher.... I went thru all that for an $8 voucher!!!!!!!!!!!! I have never been so excited to check out of a place in all my life!!!! There is a Hilton right next door to this place, the people looked happy and the staff was always smiling....guess where we stay next time!!

<Title>“Not our style at all!”
<Content>We thought this would be. Peaceful beach getaway, however this resort is extremely crowded. It took up to 15 minutes to get an elevator and them people crammed in just to get on. The pool area is too small, there were way too many people for tis small space. parking was a huge issue, and customer service not the best. Our unit was a two bedroom condo, it was well decorated, but the noise from the internal air conditioner was very loud, and the bed hard enough to give both of us back aches. The beach was nice, and I think that is the main attraction here. I wouldn't stay here again, it's not what we are looking for.

<Title>“Great Location bad timing!”
<Content>We were hesitant to book this resort based upon poor reviews but were pleasantly pleased with the room, the amenities, and the location. The staff that we encountered were pleasant but had no issues that needed resolution as others stated. We reserved a 2 bedroom that was clean and comfortable, relatively new furnishings. Our view from the balcony was partial ocean front and great view for fireworks. The resort is quite large 19 floors in south tower and 25 in north tower - having said that there is not nearly enough parking nor space at the pools. That is the only negative thing we could say. Finding a chair at the pool or space to swim was impossible on the weekends after 9a. Other guests come down by 8a, stake out chairs, leave their towels and disappear. There are many pool security guards who will move your belongings if you do not return within an hour but its all about timing... Weekends are not very relaxing by the pool but there are lots of things for the kids to do, water slide, lazy river, kids pool and you can always rent chairs at the beach... The resort is attached to and within walking distance to many restaurants/bars so if you find a parking space don't tempt fate - leave the car and walk.....

<Title>“Wonderful fun... But impatient ppl beware!”
<Content>Just back from a 2 night stay and had a great time. We stayed on the 14th floor in an oceanview 2 bedroom deluxe and it was nice-not sure what was delux about it but it was comfortable for 2 families with 3 kids under 4. Considering it was a busy holiday weekend, I think things were as good as can be expected with so many people at one place. All of the negative things were a result of the holiday...I think. First, check-in took about hall an hour. Long line, but we got there at 4pm on the dot. Next, parking garage was a zoo and there are not many extra spaces. Only 1 car per reservation, additional cars will have to park across at the city parking garage for $10/day. Do not plan on parking on the street. A) There aren't many spots and B) I wouldn't consider your vehicle safe. I hate to say it since I am from the area, but outside of the Oceanwalk is pretty dirty-old area, cheap housing, lots of homeless people. If you have teenagers---don't let then wander around on the street. There is plenty to do at the Ocean Walk, no need to go outside. So, parking was time consuming but manageable. Next is trying to secure a luggage cart. Forget it from about 4-6! I asked and there are 6 carts! 6! For 800 rooms. Crazy. There are bellman and honestly, it's worth it to pay them and let them do the work. You are on vacation... Why save $$$ at this point. Once we got parked the elevators were the next hurdle. After 25 minute wait we hoofed it up 8 flights of stairs with 2 three year olds and a 8 month old and as many bags as we could handle since we didn't get a cart. Once we got situated though, it was pretty much smooth sailing. Yes, the elevators are slow! Don't get in a hurry or plan to take the stairs. About half the time we didn't wait at all, it just depends what time it is. Few things to consider... If you are going for peace and quiet look into somewhere else (New Symrna Beach is nice and quiet) or go in the off season. If you want a very fun place with lots to do.... Bingo! There are great pools. The kiddie area is great, the lazy river is very nice, there is even a waterslide into one of the pools. Chairs were hard to come by after 8 but like I said... Holiday weekend. Ppl get up early reserve seats with towels all day with out sitting down. I heard that if you point it out to security they will wait half an hour and if no one returns they will clear the chairs and let you have them. Sounds fair. security is out and about and seemed very helpful. Poolside bar was nice, sodas were only $2. Indoor pool was nice, they even host dive-in movies in the evening. Kids loved it. Beach was busy but since it's a no-drive area it's not unbearable. We sat at the very north end of the beach infront of the resort and the crowd was thin. A vendor had chairs and umbrellas set up. $30/day gets you 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella. Good deal if you don't want to lug stuff back and forth. If you do though stuff seemed safe staying down at the beach while ppl went back up to the hotel. We visited the Ocean Walk Shoppes only once for dinner. Not our best idea-waited til 7:00 along with everyone else and every restaurant had 45-1 hour wait. Either go early or call in and get it to-go. You can pretty much check in and not leave again until you check out. Bring food, snacks drinks-you will be set. Over all very fun place, just be sure to pack an extra dose of patience if you go during a busy time.

<Title>“HORRIBLE”
<Content>The staff was terrible. In my 4 days there I met 1 nice front desk person, 1 nice bartender, and 2 nice bell men. They were unprofessional, unaccomidating, had no customer service skills. The rooms were ok...beds were horrible, felt like they tossed a bunch of springs in a box. Nobody was helpful. I was interested in buying a timeshare and they told me that I was not invited to do the informational session because I wasn't "chosen". I was completly disappointed. The pool area was too small for the amount of people that were there, they did not have enough chairs to sit in. Parking was a MAJOR issue. They did not have enough parking to accomidate the amount of people staying in their hotel, and on top of that they wouldn't pay for the parking garage we were forced to park in. I would not ever waste my money on another Wyndham resort again!!!!!!!!

<Content>Very disappointed with recent visit. As an owner from Wyndham have never been treated so poorly. Room was a "owned" room but was in Poor shape. Not sent to member services by check in. When I went next day was told I would receive a owners basket. Never happened. Main pool in deteroratng condition with paint and tiles missing and broke. Had to call for towels and supplies. NOT our Usual Quality we expect and have received in the Past.

<Title>“one stop vacation”
<Content>had a great time. loved the hotel and all the activities. parked the car and didn't have to move it the whole time. everything within walking distance. pool area open late which is a real bonus love to return soon. If you come with friends only bring one car. the hotel will only permit one car. the other must use public parking. The public parking is only across the walk way but there is a charge.

<Title>“Extremely happy, definitely will stay here again.”
<Content>I have to say I was scared to death after reading the reviews on here but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at how great this place is. We stayed a full week and from start to finish everything was great. We were checked in within minutes, the rooms were very clean and nice, lot of space. We had 8 people including 3 small children and had plenty of room. The room we stayed in is owned by someone, I don't know if that has something to do with why our condo was so great and other people on here have had complaints about cleanliness and things being broken. Everything was perfect with ours. The rest of the amenities were great as well, lots of things to keep the kids entertained, all the pool and hot tubs were very clean. There were plenty of lounge chairs by the pool. The lazy river was fantastic. The beach was very clean. We didn't have too much interaction with the staff since everything went well. If I had any things semi-negative to say it would be the front desk staff are a little stiff, very business like. They could be a little more friendly and relaxed. Also the bedrooms that had a window along the hallway were too bright at night when trying to sleep. There are blinds but the curtains do not close so it is still really bright, we went to the store and bough black sheets to put over the windows and that worked perfectly. I will definitely stay here again and would recommend Wyndam Ocean Walk to anyone

<Content>This hotel has rooms that are truly "inside" with no windows. Be sure to request a room with a view. The regular beds are wonderfully comfortable but the pull out couch is terrible. Only one bathroom with potentially six sleeping in the suite is not o.k.

<Title>“Never Again”
<Content>Stayed here to attend a graduation held on Sunday at Ocean Center. I waited an hour in line with 2 young kids to checkin. After that I hauled everything to our room myself!! There were no carts or bell man. Sorry but I have never spent $500 to for a weekend and had to do all this myself. After making it to the 17th floor which a low floor was requested to the kids, it was 90 degrees so u check the A/C reset it per the front desk person and we go out to the beach, 2 hours later I return and it's still hot. I called front desk and they said maintaince would be right up. That was at 5 on Friday well as of 10 on Sunday I had yet to see any maintenance man and I called MANY times more to the front desk. So I paid $500 to be in a HOT room all weekend. Will never stay here again and would not recommend it to anyone else!!!!

<Title>“Horrible!”
<Content>We were booked for 2 nights and left after looking at 3 filthy rooms. The a/c didn't work in the first room, the sliding glass doors were filthy and the kitchen sink faucet was laying in the sink. Room #2, Bugs in the bathroom tub, wrong bed configuration and cigarette burns in the blanket for the sofa bed. Room 3 smelled musty, ants in bathroom and just plan nasty. When I spoke with the Manager Jarod I told him that we won't be staying due to the problems he would only refund the second night. We still had to pay for the first night! Please be aware that there is NO maid service at this "hotel" and no internet service in the rooms unless you are an owner. I still can't believe what a horrible mess this place was with the Wyndham name we expected so much more.

<Title>“Loved it!!”
<Content>We stayed at these apartments for a week through our timeshare exchange. I was a little apprehensive at first after reading a few of the reviews, but when we arrived I realised there was nothing to be concerned about!! The only downside being we were told on check in that we were in a sea view room but we were not, we walked into a very spacious 1br apartment, newly decorated, 2 new tv's. The lazy river was up and running( it was being renovated before, just wondering when people expect the hotel to do this if they could never shut the pool off?!!! However, they did notify you of this on the web site) the staff were friendly to us and tried to help with any of our problems ( not that there were many ) nobody bothered us about timeshare, but we did have a message flashing on the phone, we just ignored it!! We had no problem with getting a sunbed or leaving towels while we had lunch. Our apartment was very clean and we enjoyed our stay!!

<Title>“Very good location”
<Content>This hotel is located in the heart of Daytona Beach. The pools are very nice. There are plenty of resort activities to do there. There is a wierd thing about them not knowing whether two doubles or single king will be available. The bar staff is very good. The rooms were clean. Wish the house keeping staff would have stopped in. But on the whole a very good hotel.

<Title>“Wonderful in every way except for sleeping.”
<Content>Clean, friendly staff, beautiful grounds, warm pool, perfect in every way except for one major design flaw. The bedroom window opened on to a very brightly lit hallway. The bedroom window had a light blocking drapery, but they were decorative and did not cover the window! To get the room dark enough to sleep, we had to shove a blanket in it and pin the drapery halves together, which looked very ugly and made the room feel claustrophobic.

<Title>“Great”
<Content>We stayed in a 2 BR unit with a fully equipped kitchen, a dining area, 2 bathrooms and a balcony overlooking the pools and ocean. There were 3 adults and 3 children 10 and under. We had a lot of space and beds. The children enjoyed the pool with the big circular slide plus building sand castles on the beach as well as digging for whatever in the sand. The water was still a litlle chilly(71*) and kind of turbulent but the youngest still did a little bodyboarding close to the beach. The hotel is also located close to restuarnts and entertainment for adults and kids, next to the old Band Stand/Arena plus a very nice walkway overlooking the beach. All in all in was a very plesant 3 days. The only suggestion to better the facility would be to upgrade the 3 TV's to larger Flat Screens plus and Blue Ray DVD.

<Title>“HORRIBLE! Stay far away from this place.”
<Content>This is probably the first hotel I have ever been, where the staff shows no regard to their guests. It doesn't matter what problems you may run into because Wyndham is a HUGE chain and they know how to work the system, so they will always be right and you as the guest will always be wrong! All of the staff at the front desk are rude and they will tell you anything to get you out of their face. The pools were nasty and desperately needed cleaning...hair and cigarette butts floating all around in both of the larger pools. The lazy river was shut down the entire week we were there and you better not lay your towel on a chair and leave it...even just for a few moments to dip in the pool because the security guards will come by and take your towels and leave you a slip to go pick them up! Basically, they want your money, but they will do nothing to make sure you are happy once you get there. A member of their staff tried entering into our unit without knocking. The card/key was in the door and the door was opening, except we had the door latched at the top, so they were not able to get in. We called front desk, they sent security up and he told us to go on out to the beach and he was going to run a device to see who actually was entering into our unit and would let us know. We never heard a word from anyone at the resort. We asked the front desk again if they knew who was coming into our room and they told us that a "runner" had accidentally tried coming into our room. That i can understand...sorta! But, the Manager at Ocean walk proceeds top tell me that nothing else came up on the device except for our key that we used to enter with. Ok, so either the Manager is Lying or the device was erased to protect their staff member. We have been to this hotel before and always enjoyed it, but we also had an incident last year where someone broke into our car and stole our $1,000 camera and our GPS...in a covered and secured parking garage! We decided we would give it another shot this year and sucked all of that up as a loss, since we are the ones that left valuable in our car in the first place, but after vacationing there this year and seeing how the property has gone down hill...WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!

<Title>“Not what I expected”
<Content>For the price I was disappointed in this resort. I was looking forward to relaxing on my ocean front balcony each morning with a cup of coffee to hear the ocean but I could not hear the ocean over the morning power washing of the pool deck. I was looking forward to using the big slide but found out it's not actually part of the resort. There was an added cost of $30/day for each person. I was looking forward to the lazy river but it was closed. We had reserved a pack and play for our 9 month old grandson but when we got there they were out. We did get one the next day, though. I just think they should have offered to go buy another one. The resort did not offer beach front seating. If you wanted a chair and umbrella you had to rent them. It was $30 for 1 umbrella, 2 chairs and a small end table. Our 3 bedroom condo would have been much nicer if it were updated. It seemed old and the carpet and furniture seemed dirty. In spite of all of this, we had a wonderful vacation with our children and grandson but If would have realized how little use we would make of any available ammenities I would have booked somewhere much less expensive.

<Title>“Still a great place to stay”
<Content>Ok I have been dying to write this review for a week. We just returned from a week stay at Ocean Walk and these people on here had me very worried w/ all of the negative comments and complaints. We had thought about changing to Bonnett Creek in Orlando as we had been there recently but decided to give Daytona a try. It had been 8yrs since we had last stayed at Ocean Walk as we seem to have the hardest time getting reservations there. We reserved our condo in January and were quite excited until I came on tripadvisor and became worried by what I was reading. First and foremost you with the negative comments need to get a clue! This resort is showing its age a bit but there is a reason, they see so many guests coming and going and using this place of course its going to show some wear and tear. There was not a day that went by that I did not see people working, cleaning, painting all day and into the night. A lot of people complained about the lazy river being down, you can thank the last years Spring Breakers! We talked to management and they said last years Spring Break was horrible on them. They have been struggling to clean and fix all the things they had broken and torn up. This year they were more strict, they had security guards everywhere! They did fix the lazy river while we were there but they had security constantly watching as the pumps were what they tore up and they were so expensive to replace. As far as the rooms, we were in the North Tower and our room was immaculate! One thing I do notice about this resort compared to other Wyndham properties is that there are a lot of owned units here, not managed by Wyndham. If you rent from an owner and not Wyndham you are going to have problems, and you can not blame Wyndham for the condition of the units you need to talk to the owner you rented from. Lastly I saw a lot of complaints here about service. We had an issue right at getting into our room and a toilet not flushing, they were there w/in 10min - left to get parts and were right back and had it fixed. The Guest Services were always kind and helpful and glad to help w/ anything. Please rest assured this is still a great resort and I would not hesitate to stay here again. If I can be of any help to anyone please feel free to contact me. Thanks.

<Title>“Front Desk is awful”
<Content>There was only one person at the front desk when we were checking in. The person was extremely slow and didn't seem to understand the check in process very well. He stood looking at the computer screen clicking away that took almost 15 minutes even though we had advance reservations. We booked a one bedroom room for the 25th through the 27th. At the front desk we were told it was an inside room. I asked the person if he could give me a price on an oceanfront room. After another 10 minutes he handed me my key. I was just grateful to get it. The crowd behind me was growing. I went to the room and it was a crypt. One window looking in to outside hall. It was dank and dreary with no natural light. Not the way I wanted to spend my days while on vacation at the beach. I went down to the front desk and waited on line again. After a half hour I was told that because I made an internet booking I needed to call the 800 number and change it to the oceanfront that I wanted. The 800 guy was no help. He also stated that he couldn't help me because it was an online booking. He then said to go on the website and modify my room. Of course there was no internet in any of the rooms. I had to tether my cell to my laptop. Again, no area on the website to modify my room. This now has been 2 hours since I checked in. My wife and daughter was waiting for me to resolve this while it was a beautiful day. I went down and asked for the manager. Of course the manager would even come out to talk to me she sent another agent to ask me what was wrong. Finally after 2.5 hours I got another room that was great. I didn't mind paying for the upgrade. But the hassle of that front desk where they had no clue on how to run a resort. After this we went to the Omni Championsgate in Orlando. They we the total opposite of this hotel. See my review!

<Title>“Emergency Stay here - good deal.”
<Content>We are from the North Alabama area that was ravaged by multiple tornados on Wednesday April 27, 2011. We survived fine, but with no power estimated for 7-9 days which meant no gas and spoiling foods, we made the decision to leave Decatur and head South with our family Thursday morning. We actually found our condo on vrbo.com while driving on I-10 in Florida (using my Sprint cell phone as a wi-fi hotspot and surfing on the laptop - gotta love technology). We had no idea where to stay so we called a lot of places looking for a deal. We needed a 3 bedroom 2 bath at a minimum and found a taker at this resort. We got an incredible deal for Friday-Tuesday, and are very thankful. Given our unique situation, check in went smoothly. Our room is on the 20th floor with a fantastic view of Daytona Beach. The condo was clean and had toilet paper and that was about it. Fortunately we had brought everything else. The location is excellent with close access to lots of restaurants and shops. The pools are heated. I recommend this place.

<Title>“Dissapointed”
<Content>I would not reccomend this resort. We stayed for four nights and were very disappointed. We had to change rooms three times upon checking in. When we checked in and went to our assigned room, we could tell immediatly upon opening the door that the room had been heavily smoked in. We were traveling with my infant son so it was completely unacceptable to stay in it. We immediatly went back down to the front desk and informed them that we booked a non smoking room and needed to change rooms. They switched us to a different room and we moved all of our bags and belongings to a diferent room, the air conditioner was being worked on so it was pulled out and on the floor in the hallway so we had to switch rooms yet again. They did give us five $10 vouchers for the eatery for the inconvenience tho which was nice. The purpose of my visit was to meet with my wedding vendors because we are having our wedding at the resort in October. I had one of my vendors meet me at the resort to go over some things and she called me from outside because there was nowhere for her to park because you have to have a room key to get into the parking garage at the resort. I called the front dest to ask where she could park and they were extreamly rude to me and told me to go down to the parking area and let her into the garage with my room key. Its going to be such a hassle to have to do that for our wedding guests and vendors on the day of our wedding. We have already booked everything tho so its too late to back out now. The staff is extreamly rude and you always have to call severl times to get the front desk to pick up if you need anything. The lazy river was closed off for renovation also which was dissapointing. I also paid $17 to get interntet access in our hotel room because they don't provide it for free, and it had one bar of signal if we were lucky but it didn't even have a signal for 90% of the time.

VERY! they said they were updated and just havent got to the room we stayed in...however we had a bunch of people with us, and all there rooms looked like ours!!! They tried to get my to buy a timeshare..but not if they dont keep them updated! SAD NO dvd Player..but a VHS player!!! out dated! I will recommend it, only because you cant beat the loacation...however what you see on the internet is not what you get....and hopefully the lazy river is working because it was down when we were there, and who knows when it will be back up, is what the word was!

<Title>“Worst Ever”
<Content>We made reservations through our Wyndham Time Share ownership program. Don't believe the nonsense they tell you about how important you are to the Wydham Time Share program and how you get "Priority" on your reservations. We made our reservation several months in advance and asked what it would take to get an ocean view 1 room suite. We offered to pay extra and do what ever they needed to get an ocean facing room. Boy did we get the run around. From the Reservation Staff to the Front Desk to the Guest Services Time Share staff. Everyone gave me a different story. No one would even address the issue and each time we told the individual what we were told we would get double talk about how to get what we wanted. Staff at the desk were rude and unhelpful.

<Title>“Nice view. Very rude staff....basically you are an inconvenience to everyone working here. Stay somewhere else !”
<Content>Looking at this hotel the first thought is....it's a very nice place. We check into our room and it was half clean. Who cleans half of a room ? They cleaned the kitchen but left the cabinets open, microwave was open with the microwave plate laying on the counter and the garbage can sitting in the chair. The bathroom shower and sink were cleaned but dirt and hair in the floor. There were towels but no wash rags. The bed sheets were nice and tucked but the comforter was half on the bed. The people in the eatery are very rude. At check in they failed to mention that you have to wash your own towels, take out your garbage and the pizza guy can't even deliver to your room. But don't call the front desk and ask for towel exchange they will rudely tell you "that's why you have a washer and dryer in your room". This has been by far the worst place we have ever been. Paying over $100 a night for what? I don't know about anyone else but when I go on vacation the whole point is to get away and relax.....not to do chores the whole time and be treated with the upmost disrespect. So my advice to you is choose another place to stay !!

The only good thing was the beach and the pool was okay. The lazy river not working. So tired of excuses from staff for EVERYTHING! Go to the Hilton next door.

<Title>“Great hotel.....staff needs to work on their people skills!!!”
<Content>I traveled with a large group and everyone had the same complaints. Seems like staff love to give you a hard time. I requested a low floor and got the 17th floor. Another person in our group asked for 2 beds and was told none of the units in her room type has 2 beds although 3 others, who also had the same room type reservation, checked in around the same time got 2 and even 3 beds in their unit. Another person asked to be put close to another family and they booked them in 2 different wings. No matter what time you went to the front desk they made you wait. I have pictures of lines and several staff members talking in a group. I can see it happening once in a while but everyday and at different time??!! The hotel is beautiful and the location is great, for what they charge you would thing the front desk staff would be more helpful. Bell staff was awesome! We all made reservations 7 to 8 months ago to try and avoid these problems.

<Title>“NICE HOTEL, UNFRIENDLY STAFF”
<Content>Rooms were nice, great location. We checked in late and the front desk staff were very friendly, other than that the only friendly people we came across were the maintence people. The bartenders inside and out were especially rude.

<Title>“A short vacation to the beach.”
<Content>This is a nice hotel, with all amenities you need. We were puzzled by why there were no wash clothes or hotel stationary in the room. Lots of light bulbs were out and supplies of essentials were not available. It seems that the room is question is owned by a private party and this wasn't made clear until we got associated with the time-share aspect of the hotel, by an offer they extended us. The rooms that we were shown by the time share people were luxurious and roomy. Our hotel room was roomy. Also, making reservations costs more through phone contact ($25) vs. internet ($0). Definitely make reservations by internet.

<Title>“Run Away, Don't Do It....Yikes”
<Content>Moved rooms twice. No air once. Pipes banging in the second room that my kids couldn't sleep through and they can sleep through anything. Everytime you have an issue, they tell you "Technically, these are time shares, so we are not responsible for (whatever your issue is). The lazy river was green, not operable, and with dead insects floating in it. If your stay is only three days...they will not let you get fresh towels. To resolve my issues, the Front Desk referred me to manager, manager referred me to a management Company (Tina) and Tina has now referred me to Ann. Thirteen Days later and still no resolution to my issues. The morning we left...no hot water for the entire south tower.

<Title>“AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME”
<Content>Great roms, very clean, great staff. My husband and I brought 7 children with us for spring break, ranging in ages from 10-16. The room was spacious enough for the whole group. Plenty for everyone to do. My husband and I really enjoyes our time with the kids and their friends but WILL be returning alone as soon as possible. We had no complaints. NOPE not even one. The lazy river was indeed down, but everything else was so great that it wasn't a big deal. We were more than pleased and impressed with the staff.

<Title>“VERY VERY RUDE PEOPLE AND $20 DOLLARS A DAY TO PARK!!!!!!!”
<Content>Nice place good location but the workers are very rude and did not help the whole trip also what got me was that only one car can park in there garage no matter if you have one,two,or three bedroom condo and they make you park across the street in another garage that does not belong to them it belongs to the city and they charge you $20 dollars a day to park there. You think they would have something worked out with the city but I guess just another way to get you!!!

<Title>“Very nice location but some improvements are needed”
<Content>Ocean Walk is a great resport for families, singles and couples. There is plenty to do in the area and the location is great. There are some improvements to be made on the property and if you are a Wyndham owner, be prepared for the early morning call asking you to talk with some Wyndham reps about your "check in".. First of all, the resort location is fantastic. You are very close to several pizza joints and local restaraunts. There are a couple bars near by as well as beach gift shops. We didn't make it to the Ocean Walk shoppes but they were busy each time we drove by. The local pizza joints do deliever but you have to pick your order up in the lobby which isn't a problem. Parking wasn't a problem for us until the last night of our stay when we had to park in the south tower versus the north as there wasn't room. The resort is right on the beach and within steps of the outdoor pools. We didn't make it to the "boarwalk" but there are rides if you are looking for something to do in the evening. Now to the unplesantries. First of all, we are Wyndahm owners and expected that we wouldn't have housekeeping the week we were there. We got checked in late and were woken on our first morning by a chipper girl named Michelle saying that they wanted to come to our room to do a brief survey to see how check-in went and to bring a "gift basket" up. Knowing we would be asked to come to some presentation or other, I told her I wasn't interested but she insisted that it would "really help us out" and the questions couldn't be answered over the phone. She assured me the "visit" would only take 10 minutes. I called her back a couple hours later saying that we were on our way out if she wanted to send someone up before we left, we would see them. An hour and a half later, two Wyndham employees came up with a JOKE of a "gift basket". It had two bottles of water and four small bags of snack foods. I was very firm with them and told them I wasn't interested in going to any presentations, updates or anything else that would take time away from our family vacation. However, we agreed to answer their questions. They asked ONE question about check in and the rest of the 25 minutes was spent trying to convince us to come to a Member Welcome Lunch the following day and so forth. The gentleman also asked if we were aware that we could have had an ocean front room if we only had a few more points. Of course we knew this and pointed out that the room was all we needed for this trip. I had to tell the Wyndham folks several times that we weren't interested in ANYTHING and were just there to vacation, not to be bothered with meetings and the such. Needless to say, we didn't attend the lunch the following day. The resort staff members were very nice, but slow. We called the "Fun Center" to have a high chair brought to our room and were told that the woman working was the only one there and couldn't leave so she would have someone from the front desk bring the chair or we had to come get it ourselves. Well, no one ever brought one and we had to get it ourselves later in the evening. To boot, we had to personally return the chair the night before our departure, instead of housekeeping taking care of it for us. Another night, we requested a second blanket for our room and were told it would be bright right up. Well, 45 minutes later, I called again and they said "it should be on it's way". After another 45 minutes, I went to the desk personally and asked for the blanket and was told that housekeeping had to get it off the floor "storeage" and they had none at the desk. Finally, they called housekeeping and I was advised the blanket had just been delieverd, and it was. On the upside, we also requested extra lanundry detergent and it was brought up very quickly! The lazy river was not working and had been down for at least three weeks. This was the one thing my husband was looking forward to and one of the reasons he booked this resort. The water was green but no one worked on it the entire week we were there. Besides the green water, I'm not sure what needed work on the lazy river. Other reviewers have mentioned needing wrist bands to get into the pools. We were not given wrist bands at check in and none of the security guards questioned us, ever. Maybe this is something more geared to families with older children and college "spring breakers" who might be more prone to hotel pool hopping, I don't know. We brought our own beach towels from home so we had no need to use the hotel towels when going to the pool or beach. I have to say that the drink and food prices at the outdoor bar were reasonable and not overpriced as I expected. Beers started at $2 and food platters started at $3.50. We didn't go to the lobby bar or the "convenient store" inside the resort so I cannot comment on those prices. Overall, it was a nice stay for our family of three. We don't have enough points for an ocean front room but our one bedroom was just enough for us. There were college spring breakers but they weren't too much of a problem. At one point, there was a loud group of girls walking the hall and I politely stuck my head out asking them to quiet down as we had a baby who was trying to sleep. The girls were nice enough and apologized. I imagine that the ocean front room would have been quieter. On a side note (since I haven't seen it in any other posts), you can rent beach chairs and umbrellas on the beach from non-resort companies. We rented two chairs and an umbrella for $30 for the entire day (until 5PM, when the companies start packing up). The resort towers do begin to block the sun by about 2:30PM and it is difficult to find a place to sit if you get down to the pools in the afternoon. Our daughter really enjoyed the kiddie pool area and other kids played with her. It was a nice change from the louder big kids in the other pools!

<Title>“Not so awesome”
<Content>Our family decided to supervise my teenage daughters spring break trip. We rented what seemed like a nice condo from the owner. We stayed in unit 1906 at the Ocean Walk hotel. The unit was on the top floor and the view was amazing but the tremendous amount of smokers smoking on the balcony started early and continued throughout the evening so we couldn't use the balcony. The beach was beautiful but the religous man shouting through a megaphone standing on a bench 1 ft out the gate of the pool area made it unusable. The things he shouted were horrible and insulting. It was offensive that he was allowed to yell those things at anyones child. He would start at 10 am and shout until after 4pm and could be heard all the way on our 19th floor room. The lazy river was green/brown and not operable. The pool deck was packed from sun up to sun down and the water quality reflected the large swim load. The put-put wasn't free as stated in the directory. The nightly Karaoke was loud in the lobby which one evening included the full length version of Michael Jackson's triller. Its was a great video but WAY TOO MUCH SCREAMING for a lobby area. Yikes! Wifi was only free in the lobby so I know this went on every night. When we arrived and were given a list of "dos" and "don'ts" and were charged a $150 room deposit. We kicked off our shoes when we got there. The tile was grimey and our feet were black in minutes. I felt like I had to leave a kidney on deposit to get a beach towel as we were warned not to use the ones provided in the unit anywhere and that the towels were to be cleaned before we left. Eating options were ok but were a bit pricey. Our family of 5 never left a resturant under $80 and that is without alcoholic drinks. I don't believe I would recommend staying at this resort at this time. Not being able to enjoy the balcony, the beach, or the pool deck was a huge disapointment and certainly not worth what I paid.

<Title>“It was just OK”
<Content>Nothing great about it. First night the AC was broke and also the 2 of the 4 elevators were out. Half hour wait to get the armbands for the pool. The lady when I checked in was not rude to me, but when other guest had questions she acted like she was annoyed. The Pool towel check out is kind of annoying. The elevator situation was the worst, we still managed to have a good time.

<Title>“Great Place Even During Spring Break”
<Content>I stayed on the North Tower at the Wyndham Ocean walk during the week of March 13 through March 20 (Spring Break!). Although there were tons of college aged kids around, they weren't excessively crazy compared to those who go to less expensive hotels. This hotel is centrally located to all the nightclubs and attractions and directly on the beach. The rooms were large, with a washer/dryer, dishwasher, plates and silverware...fully stocked. The downside was that there was no housekeeping during the stay and we were forced to reuse our towels. 4 beach towels are provided per room with only one exchange per stay. The pool fills up during the morning and it's impossible to find a seat if you don't get there early. Around 2, the hotel starts hiding the sun and people start moving to the beach to catch some sun. The pools and slide were heated and warm. There were two indoor pools that very few people used. I was a little angry that the lazy river was closed and looked like algae or yellow water was floating around. My friends and I went down for Spring Break and I highly recommend this hotel. We picked up a VIP pass for $25 and enjoyed free beer from 8 to 10 and no cover for each club during the week. Great deal but there were tons of spring breakers taking advantage of this deal so there were long lines. The hotel is about two blocks away from Razzles, Aqua, and Lounge 509 which are the hottest clubs in Daytona. There's plenty of good restaurants nearby. 32oz mugs of beer for $3.29...I'd spend more than 4 times that amount in New York City. Try the BBQ place in front of the Hilton, Bubba Gump, Mai Tai, and Winghouse (a hooters clone). I'd go back to Daytona next year.

<Title>“Misrepresented!!!”
<Content>This was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had in Daytona for bike week! Please be advised that the Hotel/ Resort was completely misrepresented by the reservations personnel that we spoke with and we were completely misguided! We had been told that on-site bike and trailer parking was available as well as truck! This was a joke- only allowed one bike and truck- No trailer parking- took three bikes - couldn't park them at hotel- one per reservation- had to take trailer several miles away- No maid service - No room service- When we had asked and been told otherwise! Bike loading/unloading was terrible - No area ! Complete cluster!! No easy access. Buyer beware- First and last time- Been in Daytona for 13 straight years for Bike week and Biketoberfest- never again at this place- Normally at Holiday Inn / N. Atlantic- Will definitely go back. Tried something different with friends- NOT GOOD!

<Content>I have been staying at the Wyndham Ocean Walk since the first year it opened and always loved it, great location nuvo modern decor. This year it was really looking tired and old. Furnishings were worn, the window covering in the bedroom was broken and wouldn't roll up ( they did come and fix it) this place is due for a major overhaul, for the money we spent I think I can do better.

<Author Location>SPRING HILL FLORIDA
<Title>“Going downhill fast...”
<Content>We stayed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk, Daytona Beach last year during spring break and had a wonderful time, so we decided to repeat the experience this year. In comparison to last year's good experience, this year's was 'not so great'. The only thing superb was the weather. The positives first. Yes, Ocean Walk is still the best value on Daytona Beach for families who want a large, oceanfront unit with all of the comforts of home including a full kitchen that is near everything. The Hilton stands just next door but there is no comparison. No balconies, kitchens or decent pool there. I gave Ocean Walk four stars last year because it is NOT a full service hotel like the Hilton, with a sit down restaurant, room service, valet etc...If you want THAT, go THERE.I enjoy the convenience of self-catering. No lines, tips, bad service or getting dressed to go out to eat. And then there is the huge tab.We have saved literally thousands over the years 'timesharing'. Disappointments at Ocean Walk this year: The lazy river, a point of relaxation and fun last year was closed and had algae growing on the walls. I never once saw anyone working on it to get it up and running while we were there. The entire property had been invaded by spring breakers. Every night we were there they invaded and took over the South hot tub and drank beer there until the early hours, in a very loud and often vulgar manner. I was awakened one night at 2 AM by drunken screaming from a balcony nearby. That South hot tub itself was very unclean, murky and had a greenish tint all of the time we were there. I watched the South deck cleaners open up the deck each morning before sunrise. The fellow with the powerwasher would focus on the area around the hot tub and the entrance to the water slide, then quit. I guess he then felt able to say Yes, I powerwashed the deck" to his supervisor. Unmotivated, I suppose. Too bad his efforts did NOT show improvements. The entire deck needs to be powerwashed more often AND re-surfaced. The deck swarmed with spring breakers every day,and Ocean Walk catered to them by playing VERY LOUD music. The bar now advertises to the general public "$3 draft beer" on a large, permanent banner to the general public walking by on the boardwalk. At the Eastern boardwalk entrance, a room key is no longer required to enter the pool deck area. Thus, enter ALL of those who are not staying at Ocean Walk who want to use the deck and buy that cheap beer! Forget security. There is none at Ocean Walk any more. The room card security lock at the entrance from Ocean Walk shoppes complex has been disabled as well. I guess the security of Wyndham's guests is not too important anymore...at least not at Ocean walk. I felt safe last year letting our two tween kids roam the property when the security system was working and being enforced. I saw FEW people wearing their pool deck ID bracelets because that simply was not being firmly enforced. We wore ours for the first two days of our one week stay, then just took them off because.hey, when in Rome...The only difference was that we had the RIGHT to be in Rome while others obviously did NOT because of the lax security. This is probably the worst mistake Wyndham can make at this property because there are dozens of young people loitering around outside the resort on the streets at any given time. Obviously many of them are not there to go to church, as evidenced by their physical dress and appearances. In our unit: The balcony railing in our 2 BR unit was filthy. I wiped part of it with a white wash rag and it came away black. On the ledge outside the master BR window there was pigeon waste. The balcony itself needed a powerwashing too. The balcony furniture was grimy. In the unit itself, two stove burners had to be plugged back in before they could be used. The dryer squeaked loudly when it was used, there were cracked tiles in the unit, the dishwasher was loose, the master BR smelled slightly of vomit....Thank God the safe worked...I would have been somewhat afraid to leave my valuables out in the open with ZERO SECURITY... We won't be using our Wyndham points or spending our money at Ocean walk again unless there is a change of management to one whose financial hands have not been tied by 'corporate' and has a watchful eye for details. If there are no immediate changes Wyndham's Daytona Beach Ocean Walk, flagship of the Florida Southeast Atlantic seaboard should be re-named to 'Titanic' except no one is even polishing the brass anymore....Too bad. One more item.Each suite reservation gets only ONE parking space despite the size of your party,even if you are in a 3 bedroom which sleeps what,10 people? Great! All other members in the party who bring a car get to pay for parking in the public parking garage across the street.How unrealistic.Wyndham could not strike a deal with the garage to provide reduced rates or even free parking like OTHER nearby businesses do,in exchange for their guests' patronage? It's only good business....Aparrently the bottom line has to be REAL FAT,eh Wyndham?

<Title>“Rudest People on Earth! Hotel has become run down.”
<Content>I travel often and our company had a spring break promotion in Daytona. We have done it several years off and on. I had made a reservation same day for myself but had several others there from my company. When I went to check in after midnight, the clerk at the front desk was very rude and said she could not find my reservation. I gave her the details of the reservation, price, the information about the confirmation page., but I did not have the confirmation number due to driving down the road and not being able to write it down or print. I thought no problem and asked her just to start a new one and check me in. No problem right? Wrong, she informed me that I would have to pay the rack rate, you know the max rate posted on the back of doors in some hotels. It was $200 more then what I had booked and she was happy about it. Hey, it's after midnight, I'm tired and I informed her that was not correct. She was more interested flirting with the drunks that had stumbled up then helping me which really annoyed me. I tried pulling up my email etc but no confirmation number etc. This room was going to go unsold and I had enough details to be believable but no confirmation. Any hotel I have ever stayed at would have done the right thing and given the room to me at the online rate but not her. I asked for the manager, which after 30 miniutes came to the lobby flanked by to security guards. WHAT? and the very loud drunk bikers continued to come and go unnoticed by her, the manager and security. No one had gotten loud, cussed or anything except complain normally. The manager stuck by full rack rate despite me looking up the rate on a ipad and showing her that now the rate had even gotten lower for the next 3 night I was staying.. She was as rude as they come and did not care. So I paid the extra 200 for the first night and booked the other night under a separate reservation with her watching. Here's where it even got worse, the next day, because the new reservation, they made me move to a different room(same type, same everything because I had a different reservation. I wonder if the owners of these condo's know how bad these people are? The hotel was very load, dirty and just have gotten worn out. I travel to Florida year round and often and I will avoid the Wyndham properties. Here's more. Yesterday I received the email with the original reservation for the lower rate and now I must check my credit card to see if I got charged. Bet I did!

<Title>“I Couldnt Have Asked for More”
<Content>I traveled with 10 other law students on spring break to Daytona, FL. To our delight it was also bike week. That added an interesting twist to our time there. The great thing was that besides seeing the bikers on the beach and in the hotel you wouldnt know it was Bike Week. The room was such that the sounds outside didnt bother us. The condo was right on teh beach. We looked out our windows or stood on the balcony and it was right there. The rooms were amazing and more than we could have ever asked for. Renata was amazing to work with and the price was to die for. The hotel has 4 pools (one indoor) and 2 hot tubs, a mini golf course, gym, bars, snack bars, lazy river, kids pool, and a water slide. When it got windy we just lounged by the pool and hot tub. You could get drinks made by a bartender or bring down your own. There was a private entrance from the beach that allowed only guests to the pools. This place is amazing and we didnt want to leave. I will be visiting again!! Oh and there was a hot tub in our room for when the pools and hot tubs closed at midnight.

<Content>I don't know what hotel some of you have stayed at, but the past 4 years of staying at this hotel has been amazing. Very clean, nice people, great rooms, and very clean pools/lazy rivers. Towers do NOT block the sun unless getting toward the evening, music is NOT overly. loud, and there were DEFINITELY no roaches. Pool cleanining people are out there every morning before daybreak and staff is very welcoming not to mention the oceanwalk shops connected to the hotel. Great great family atmosphere hotel.

<Content>Stayed 2 nights with friends. No maid service, and staff was not that accommodating in regards to certain requests which would have made our stay more pleasant. This place is a set of glorified apartments set up to look like a hotel. They also pressure you to attend a 90 minute talk on sale of these units. Would not stay again and advise you to stay away. Business center had no printer. Free internet only in certain areas. Highlight was seeing space rocket launch from Cape Kennedy.

<Title>“We Want to Go Back”
<Content>We had some business in Daytona and were able to get one night at this resort in a deluxe room sleeps four. I had no idea there was so much to do and would like to have spent more time there. It was a points exchange room, so I have no idea if they have a nightly room price. I thought I got value for the points. The room was huge with full kitchen and big bathroom. There is a lot to do for kids such as a lazy river and minature golf. Next door there is the Ocean Walk shops and restaurants/movie theater. The unit had washer/dryer which was great mid trip to do laundry. The bathroom had a jetted tub and plenty of counter space. If you do eat out try Bubba Gump's Mahi/shrimp with Bourbon sauce. That was really delicious. I know this resort had more to offer, which is why I would like to go back and stay more nights. We went north about an hour to St.Augustine, Florida which is an easy day trip from Daytona. Do the trolley tour where you can get on and off and explore. Have lunch at Barnacle Bills which was recommended by the Park Ranger at the Fort. Good choice.

<Content>We stayed in both Towers. The one tower is new but dirty. Every appliance had ketcup or dirt on it, not to mention roaches. We had only one chair on the balcony and asked for a second and were told they didn't have one yet there were about a hundred by the pool and they told us they could not take one from there,lol. The new tower could be nice but they need to hire new cleaners and more polite staff.

<Title>“Ocean Walk Is Heading Downhill”
<Content>We have been staying at this property for several years now and have been mostly satisfied in the past. This year, however, things are a bit different. The two outdoor pools were not heated. They were listed as under renovations in December 2010, but it said they would be back operational by the end of 2010 (we stayed the 1-27 through 1-30). There is also a noticeable decline in the room interiors. There were light bulbs burned out, dust all over the lighting fixtures, hair on the floor in the bathrooms, and a non-working ice machine. In addition to this, the mattresses in the rooms were indented in the middle of each bed (we stayed in a 3 bedroom unit) making them not very comformable. Once you were able to get comfortable, you had all the lights from the hallways coming in through the bedroom windows, as most units do not have room darkening window treatments. Lastly, free wi-fi in the lobby - but you have to pay to use it in the rooms..... Don't know if we'll stay here again next year -- sad.

<Title>“Good price for room , great location but VERY OLD , Needs updating”
<Content>I stayed for 3 nights for the Rolex races this past weekend with my husband . I booked it becasue it looked nice on the website and location was great. Also it was cheap, only 140 a night for a 1 bedroom ocean front. When i fist walked in I was impressed, it looked very nice, The woman at the counter was rude. Then I got to our room and it was very outdated , looked very 80's. No housekeeping , I was told to wash my own towels. The handle to door broke off and there was no hot water. However, they did fix these things right away. They called me twice to try to get us to attend a sales meeting to buy a condo, which is something i am not intereted in doing during a vacation stay, send me and email . I was told that everything was open when i booked it. The tiki bar was not open , i was dissapointed, they said weather permitting , we just flew in from Philly in the snow so as far as im a concerned 60 degrees is weather permitting. The lazy river was green and there was a very bad gas smell from the pool heater which made it hard to sit outside, also they play music outside from 8 am in the morning untill 11 or so at night which made it hard to just enjoy the sound of the ocean . They even turned it on at 8 on a sunday morning when I would think people want some peave and quiet. I will not stay here again, I would rather spend another 100 a night for a little more luxury. I want room service and housekeeping when i go on vacation.

<Title>“Nice but for the price some basics should be included”
<Content>The Wyndham is a very nice hotel. There were eith of us that stayed in a three bedroom. There was sufficient space although it only had two bathrooms. Three would have been preferable. Was dissappointed that it only came with one parking pass. That meant an extra $60 for 3 days at the parking garage accross the street for each additional vehicle. Also, I guess because a washer and dryer is included with a sample packet of detergent, you are expected to launder your own towels and no room service is provided. That is crazy. Also, it was difficult to get pick up wrist straps/welcome package information. Front desk had no clue when personnel would be at their post. I got 3 difference times and all were wrong. Luckily it was cold and we did not need them.

<Title>“"Welcome basket" is a joke.”
<Content>When we checked in to Worldmark Ocean Walk in Daytona, we were told someone would bring up a "welcome basket" the next morning at 9 a.m. and ask us just THREE questions. The woman who came presented us with a COFFEE MUG containing two small snack packages of cookies and a Reese's Peanutbutter Cup candy bar. Then she insisted on sitting down in our dining room with us and our guests to "ask a few questions" which turned out to be MANY questions. It soon became clear she was going to pitch a sale for Wyndham points. I expressed frustration, and she responded by being extremely rude. "Are you in a bad mood? Have I done something to offend you?" I responded, "Please don't hastle me in the middle of our vacation." And the insults continued from this woman. To Worldmark and Wyndham: Please don't send these people to our rooms! We come to Worldmark properties to vacation, not to hear the hundreth timeshare pitch! The condo was great in most ways, but the intrusion into our privacy is inexcusable.

<Content>Broken toilet and clogged sink. A 1990's spring break feel to the hotel. Had a great time and would recommend this hotel to anyone who would like a throwback to the 90's.

<Title>“Not so great for the money”
<Content>When we arrived, I was very impressed with the look of the hotel (lobby and outside of the building) and the gentleman that checked us was extremely nice. But that was where it ended. When we got in our room it was dirty. There was a used bandaid on the end table by the phone, grass and sand on the kitchen counter, a lot of hair on the bathroom floor (I would not walk in there without shoes), and to top it off one of the beds had not been changed. So at 11:30 at night I was changing my own sheets. I asked for the room to be cleaned the next morning but it was not. For $167 (with tax) a night, I definitely will not stay again.

<Title>“Very disappointed”
<Content>We reserved these condo's "one year in advance" to hold a family reunion consisting of 12 of us from around the country. We drove from Reno, NV and our son and family flew from Phoenix. We reserved (2) three bedrooms, and (1) one bedroom to accomodate twelve people. One week prior to arrival the Wyndam reservation system called to inform us they didn't have any three bedrooms available and could offer (2) two bedrooms, with a pull out coach for the four teenagers, which included girls and boys. Everyone already had their plane tickets way in advance. This would absolutely not work so a manager said he would work on it. He called back a few days later and said he was working on it and would e-mail us the confirmations and call to tell us what he came up with. He never did and after frantically trying to contact him, while driving across country, I finally got another manager to get him to answer the call. He then informed us he had (7) one bedroom's, held which was absolutely rediculous. When we arrived it took me over two hours to get them to actually give us (7) one bedrooms as he only reserved five. I have to admit Dillia was absolutely wonderful in helping me with this. Later we were informed they only have (3) three bedrooms to sell in the entire complex and they sold our's out from under us. Needless to say we will never stay there again. The activities were poorly ran and in fact my husband dealt cards for the poker tournament one night because they had no one to run it. They were always late for activities and blamed it on people not showing up. I wonder why ?? My parents unit didn't have hot water and were informed to get up early and take their showers before everyone else. They were finally moved to another unit. The plumbing was very poor and the coffee maker and toaster didn't even work. Just one more hassel to getting things fixed. What a disappointing Christmas for us. They also said they would compensate us for all the hassel and we never heard from them, "except" to fill in this review, so that is what I am doing. It was our 3rd and last stay there.

<Title>“Easy living”
<Content>Stayed here Jan 15-17, 2011. I can not say anything negative about this resort. It was a busy Saturday, many cars in line unloading luggage. The staff member meeting me at the curb was delightful and precise about temporary parking directions while I checked-in. Inside, check-in was fast and friendly. I was on the way to my room in less than 5 minutes. My 1 bedroom unit had a full kitchen, microwave, full refrig, coffeemaker with coffee packs and condiments, pots, pans and utensils. A dining table for 4. Couch that could fold out as a bed. Large HD TV with remote. King size bed, HD TV w/remote, plenty of storage for folded clothes and a large closet. The unit has a, what Wyndham calls, hall view from the dining area and bedroom. Hall view is, actually, a view across the hall through large pains of glass to the Intracoastal Waterway. Bathroom was adequate, tub and shower, with plenty of linen. The resort has a pool, hot tubs, lazy river and waterslide on the oceanside. Indoor Pools. Exercise room with weights, elliptical machines, tread mills, stationary bikes. Reading and computer room with four computers connected to the web. Indoor miniature golf, Restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. The resort is close to many other dining spots. Within a block there is Starbucks, Bubba Gumps, Sloppy Joes, Wing House, Johnny Rockets, IHOP, Starlite Diner, Burger King, Napoly Pizza, Baskin Robbins, Duncan Donuts, Doc Bales’ Grill, Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse. Some others within walking distance are Earl Street Grill, Cruisin Cafe Bar & Grill, Hog Heaven Bar-B-Q, Dominos Pizza and many more.

<Title>“ONE OF OUR REPEAT DESTINATIONS BUT SLIPPING A LITTLE FROM PAST”
<Content>We did a 3 bedroom oceanfront this time rather than the 2 bedroom we usually stay in. The extra room was great my son had his own King size bed and my daughter invited a friend to stay with the extra room. We were on the 5th floor North Tower. The north pools were closed as were the hot tubs (one still open) but it was closed about thursday leaving none. The south tower outside pool was to cold for swimming although if you stood directly over the intake your feet got warmer. The Lazy river was green and turned off most of the time but also really to cold for swimming. The room was great few minor problems but maintanance had us fixed in minutes of calling front desk. Swimming in the pools for us is a big thing so we may stay away until they get those problems sorted out. But overall we do like the area. We rented from an owner and were very pleased, other than the pools.

<Title>“Great Place, Good location, Wonderful Complex”
<Content>We stayed a week at the Wyndham Ocean Walk in a 1 bedroom condo with an ocean view. We asked for an ocean front when we checked in, but the ocean view was fabulous. We were in the south building and the decor, furniture, etc were in excellent shape. The only complaint I had was that the kitchen was sparcely furnished. We walked on the beach, swam in the pools and used the exercise facilities. The customer service was lacking, but we were not bothered with a timeshare pitch. It was especially a good deal since I got it with a certificate on Skyauction.com

<Title>“Rent through an owner, not Wyndham itself.”
<Content>I stayed with my family in early November. I rented through an owner. The units were very nice and reasonable. We had an ocean front side (side A) and hallway side (side B). Overall, I am happy with the owner I went through and if anyone wants to send me a message to find out the owner, feel free. Everything that we needed was there: beach chairs, umbrellas, bedding, fully equipped and working kitchens, washer/dryers, beach toys, more...The view from the balcony was very nice. Ocean front just like the picture. The location of the hotel is really good. It is right on the ocean and within walking distance to shops and places to eat. It is in the nicer area of Daytona. The bad: Like most people have said on here, the customer service is really awful. We didn't ask them for anything like towels or paper products, because we knew we had to launder everything ourselves and buy our own tp, stuff like that. My spouse did complain to the management a couple times about a high pitched noise that made sitting on the balcony or around the pools sometimes unbearable. A security person determined it was one of the pool pumps. It was so loud, we could hear it with the balcony door closed in the living area of the room and all the way out to the beach. My spouse approached a manager about it a second time and the manager was a smart [-]. He said, well you could move to the other pool. No sorry. No we will repair it. Even if we moved to the other pool, it was so loud it could be heard no matter where you went. Oh. And the really STUPID rule with the pool towels. Get this. You are allowed to check out towels and you need to launder them. You can't exchange them for fresh ones except for one time the entire stay. So, if you exchange ONE of your towels, early, say one towel fell into the pool and you didn't want to drag the sopping went towel up through the lobby, onto the elevator, down a hall and into the room, that counts as the one exchange. You are NOT ALLOWED to exchanged anymore towels. Really, every hotel I have ever stayed at allowed towel exchanges anytime. The pools outside were so cold it felt like there were ice cubes floating in it. The inside pools were not much warmer. The ocean in November was warmer than the pools. Like other people have mentioned, there are tons of hair floating in the pools and hot tub. Supposedly, they will be replacing the pool pumps this month, but come on. Did they ever hear of a pool skimmer? The lazy river looked greenish, but it might have been the paint color. In any case, none of my children were willing to take a chance on that. The pool water looked clean in all the pools I saw, except for the hair. It is a nice hotel. The lobby is nice. The pool areas are nice. I think it could be a very nice place if they get rid of just about all the management people and the stupid rules they have. And let me emphasis again, go through an owner. You will get a much better room and if anything happens, you can call the owner and not have to deal with the management at that hotel. I would only recommend this hotel to a friend if they rented a unit through the owners we used. I would suggest to a friend that they stay during a less busy season, like we did. We had no trouble finding chairs around the pool, check in was fast, it was quiet, and I think had it been busier, we would have ran into some of the problems other people mentioned. BTW: There was plenty of security. There were police cars sitting in an area below us in a parking area to the side the whole stay.

<Title>“Customer Service was absent from my stay”
<Content>The hotel does not clean the rooms daily and you must wash your own towels if you would like fresh ones. I stayed in a studio room and it was VERY small and the beds were uncomfortable. I woke up everyday with my shoulders in pain. I find it to be unsatisfactory when the answer from the customer service department is consistently no when asked about different services.

<Title>“"Hotel" nice, location nice, Customer Service across the board terrible!!!”
<Content>We booked a large suite at this hotel. We had three bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen, balcony overlooking the ocean and everything was nice and clean. We stayed for several nights. The pools were great, our kids were thrilled. We also loved the ocean and we had a great trip in spite of the poor customer service. Checking in took forever and most of the time spent was waiting for the one person ahead of me on line to be checked in. My husband waited in the car outside and was told he had to move his car when we hadn't even received a room key let alone a parking pass. After checking in I was told that I had to see the concierge for pool passes. Before you can get the pool passes they try to get you to commit to attending a time share presentation for 90 minutes. Meanwhile my husband is still getting harassed in the car at the drive up check in entrance outside and all I want are my pool passes! Every room in the hotel gets one parking space. That is fine for a one bedroom but in our three bedroom we needed three passes. it was quite a hassle to get them and the public parking that they wanted us to use was an expensive rate. Every request to the front desk was an adventure in bad customer service except for the woman who finally opened a line and checked me in after waiting for a long time and the person in the sun room who allowed me to borrow a wheelchair for the weekend for my elderly Mom. Those two encounters were the only pleasant ones I had with staff the entire weekend. So if you need to stay in Daytona like we did and if you like to stay in the water and away from the people that work in the hotel, this is a great place for you. If you wish to be treated like a respected customer then look elsewhere.

<Title>“The absolute worse experience of my life!”
<Content>This was the worse service I have ever experienced. First of all, the rooms are very small, with a stove and full refrigerator. The door would not open all the way due to limited space; The TV was a 13-inch tube television (NO JOKE)...To make matters worse, I arrived late Friday night for a wedding on Sat...went out on Sat and returned to room about 4 to get ready for wedding. Room was not cleaned, called downstairs and they informed me they don't do daily cleanings. I asked for clean towels and they said ok..called back to front desk because towels were taking a long time and someone else answered and said we were encouraged to launder our towels & store is on 1st floor. We had to ask for management or a supervisor to get fresh towels delivered to room. I don't know about anyone else, but a vacation for me does not include doing laundry!

<Title>“FIVE STAR VACATION”
<Content>I spent 10/23 to 10/30 at OceanWalk, in a 3BR 2BA oceanfront unit, approx. 1455 sf. Check in was early and quick. The unit had 4 TV's, 2 were flat panel. I had some minor maintenance problems that were handled courteously and rapidly. I was able to get a passable bacon cheeseburger at a reasonable price at the snackbar. There was a lot of security present, which made me very comfortable after reading some reviews. I had some great meals at Aunt Catfish's in Port Orange and Under the Deck. The weather was so warm I thought it was summer! I had a great visit and I will definitely be back. I own I this location and Wyndham Las Vegas.

<Content>We have stayed at this hotel about four times before, the location is excellent. The resort itself has so much to offer to couples and families, beach, super pool, restaurants. There is so much to do within a short walk. Unfortunately, the unit we stayed in this time was in need of a total overhaul.I was saddened be the room's state, it does look like the resort is working on improvements. If you are considering a stay, make sure you get a newer room, it will enhance your stay.

<Content>We had a fantastic week at Ocean Walk in Daytona Beach - even though the weather turned cold at the end of the week! We stayed at Wyndam Ocean Walk on Atlantic Avenue. It is an amazing place to stay. You are literally right on the beach. Here is a picture of our view from our room. There were so many things to do - I wish we would have had 2 weeks of vacation instead of one! We toured the Ponce Inlet Lighthouse and then ate at Bubba Gumps restaurant. The view was amazing and the staff at Bubba Gumps were entertaining. We loved going to the Daytona Beach Kennel Club dog track. We had fun picking the racing dogs based on their names. We had a great time and ended up winning enough money to pay for our scrumptous buffet dinner. We can wait to travel to Daytona Beach again!

<Title>“Our room was burgarlized at the Ocean Walk!”
<Content>I read Trip Advisor before I left, saw that others had been robbed, and thought it couldn't happen to me - but it did! Thieves took our camcorder, digital camera and computer while we were out to dinner. Oddly enough, our safe did not work, which we reported but a part needed to be ordered to repair it. We put our money/ipods in a friend's safe that was staying at the Ocean Walk as well. We discovered after we were burgarlized that the door did not shut/lock properly. When you leave the balcony door open, it creates a wind tunnel, causing the door to slam. After this happens over and over, the door evenutally comes off balance and does not line up with the lock correctly. When we left the room, we thought the door was locked, we pulled it shut tight behind us and checked the door handle, but all you had to do was either push hard against the door or put a driver's license or a room key between the door and the door jam, and the door would pop open. We have video of how easy it was to open our door (of course we had to borrow a friend's camcorder since ours was stolen). Had my husband not noticed this, our room could have been broken into over and over. What really upsets me is it is just stuff, but my 17 year old daugter returned to the room alone that night at 9:30 while we stopped off at a friend's room. I hate to think of what could have happened if she entered the room and they were in there. The entire rest of our vacation, I did not feel safe. They did repair the door, but I did not feel safe staying there. The management blamed it on the private owner not providing proper maintenace, but honestly there is a total lack of security. There are 3 security guards on duty - 1 in the basement that distributes the keys to the maids, 1 at the pool area and 1 in the lobby. There are no security cameras or security personnel that patrols the hallways. Anyone can enter the hotel and go anywhere in the complex - you do not need a room key to wander around all 25 floors -except for the pool - they guard that really well. You also do not need a key to enter via the garage, you can just push hard against that door and it will pop open as well. Anyone has access to the garage from inside the complex. We did contact the hotel mgmt, security and Daytona Beach Police. While I was in the lobby walking the police office out, another gentleman stopped us and asked us if I had been robbed. He said his safe didn’t work and his room was robbed as well. Ocean Walk was advertised to me by the owner as a "5 Star Resort". I’ve been in 5 Star Resorts and this certainly is not one. Besides the robbery, the safe was broken, ants in the kitchen, dishwasher did not work, no remote, or remote did not work for the tvs. My husband repaired the bedroom door himself so it would shut properly. The room needed updating, but it has a beautiful view and location and we were willing to overlook these details. We cannot overlook a robbery. Not only did we lose our items, but we lose several days of vacation waiting in the room while the safe was repaired, working with the police, hotel security, and while the man repaired the door. The owner offered to repair the dishwasher and I said "never mind" I wanted to get to the beach just a little bit at least during my vacation! People are entering the Ocean Walk like lambs going to a slaughter. This is recognized as a place for families, yet they have no security to protect those staying there. Please think twice before staying here and putting your family in danger like I did. I didn't take the warnings seriously of other postings thinking it couldn't happen to me - it did and it can happen to you. If you have also stayed at Ocean Walk and were robbed, please contact me through Trip Advisor. I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, Hotel and Motel Regulation, sent letters to the Wyndham Corporation, the mgr of the Ocean Walk, Joe McMenamin, the private owner I have rented from, the Daytona Beach Chamber of Commerce, The Mayor of Daytona Beach and the Chief of Police. Ocean Walk needs to take accountability and responsiblity for their lack of maintenance and security.

<Title>“Ready to go back”
<Content>This was a very nice hotel at a reasonable price. It is also a timeshare property but nobody bothers you about doing a presentation. There are many amenities on site and I traveled with 2 teenage girls and a 3 year old. The kids didn't ever want to leave the hotel to do anything anywhere else. It is wonderful that it connects to a movie theatre and restaurants. All you have to do it hop on the elevator and you are in front of the movie entrance. It has a nice ampitheatre in front of it where concerts were going on one night. It is also walking distance to the Boardwalk. Loved it-will return next year!

<Title>“Our two bedroom was just fine”
<Content>We stayed in 1020 in the north tower and rented through a private owner. It was a two bedroom two bath, two balcony condo. We were there September 17th through October 1st. We had a great time. The property itself was not new, but we weren't expecting that. The lobby was nice enough, the carpet and seats were clean. We had no problems with the staff, but really had little interaction with them. Our youngest two loved the kiddie splash pool and played there often. We all loved the beach that is directly in front of the hotel. We were in the water almost daily. We really spent most of our time in the ocean. Our condo had boogie boards and chairs. We ended up going to the Dollar tree for more buckets, it is just down the street by Publix. Our condo was dated. The beds were a little saggy. A couple of the towels have some snags. It didn't matter very much to us. We tend to travel on a budget and want to be able to stay longer over staying fancy. Everything worked. The chairs were comfy. The tv isn't a flat screen, but really, who cares? There seems to be a lot of police cars that park in the driveway, we never thought it was because they were there in an official capacity. We kind of thought that they may have been eating in the restaurant there?! We never felt threatened or unsafe, but we were there when the place wasn't "in season". The steak house in the Hilton is wonderful and in walking distance, as is Starbucks. We found this to be a great family vacation.

<Title>“Great place for families!”
<Content>My family and I have stayed at the Ocean Walk five times and have always had a wonderful time. We have made it an annual family weekend getaway. It is in a great location near many restaurants and a perfect stretch of beach with no cars. The pools, slide, kiddie pool, and lazy river offer fun for all ages. The condos are large with plenty of room for everyone...perfect for families with young children. I was born and raised in Daytona Beach and have been to many of the hotels and this is by far the best.

<Title>“Could be an Amazing Property, but needs maintenance.”
<Content>This property SHOULD have it all. It has an amazing location, spacious condos, and resort amenities. HOWEVER, it is needs better maintenance and service. Our room, while attractively decorated and well stocked, was in need of a good painting, cleaning (mildew in shower mostly) and basic repairs. The nightly rate was high for the service received and condition of the room. In our 3 days there we had to call maintenance 4 times for a clogged toilet. (We CALLED more than that, but they came 4 times-for the same toilet). Our tv remote did not work, our safe was locked and could not be accessed, the coffee maker leaked badly, the balcony was covered with pigeon poop. Even check in was incredibly challenging. We asked to see two rooms before checking in (we were walk ins). It took over an hour to see to rooms and check in. Really? It took several calls each time to finally get someone to unclog the toilet. The hotel DOES have great amenities. We did not get to enjoy all of them, so I can't say if they were good. The hot tub/spa was clean and VERY hot, with a beautiful view of the ocean. There are several pools, a lazy river, pool bar and snack bar. One night they were even showing a movie in the indoor pool on a big screen. This property would be somewhere we would go every year if the service were better.

<Title>“location, location, location”
<Content>This condo only "resort" proved to be one of the best on the "strip". Not only was it ideally located for shopping and eating, it was within walking distance of a few child/teen friendly activities. The best part though was its beach access...right outside the back door.. and the various pools. With their "drink/food" friendly policy one could stock up in the condo and then bring down supplies as needed to the pool/beach. For someone on a budget this was a big plus! If you didn't want to do it yourself their pool bar was priced reasonably for both food and drink!! There were plenty of activities available at the hotel although I have to say that the college age kids leading the activities for kids were less than enthusiastic. Nonethless my two teens had a great time just hanging out at the pool, arcade, beach, etc.

<Title>“Had hoped for more for the price I paid”
<Content>We've stayed at the Ocean Walk before (both towers) and loved it. Very friendly staff. This time I have to say was not so good. The room we had was pretty run down. In need of paint, lampshade had broken loose from lamp and wallpaper boarder falling off the wall in the bedroom. Furniture was in very poor condition. The place it starting to show it's age. It put me on the beach I love with a great view and that's the best I can say about it. I would recommend this place, but suggest you ask to see your room first.

<Content>Worst downfall is very late check in and early ck out. Rooms are quite large, and supplied with all the basics you would need. However, the curtains don't come down in the bedrooms which makes for bright nights. Lots to do for the kids.

<Title>“Dont stay at this hotel very UNSAFE”
<Content>My husband & I stayed at this resort for Bike Week 2010. We left for the evening around 10:00 pm returned back to find our hotel room door broken down and our room was ransacked. Everything of any value had been taken such as $3,000.00 in cash from a shirt in our suitcase, my purse, wallet all my credit cards our keys to our bike, bike trailer, vehicle, jewlery cell phones. Had to call a locksmith to have keys cut so we could get home which cost us $300.00. The police tsaid the security at this resort was terrible and they have been having alot of trouble. The security guard that was on duty was elderly and they had no security cameras at all!! Overall we had a claim for around $13,000.00 as far as how much was taken. Basically the Wyndham manager did not want to deal with us was very unsympathetic and pretty much tried to avoid the whole situation. We were DEVASTATED. The manager ended up moving us to another room after this happened and the lock on the door of that room was broke. After just being robbed behind a door that was locked and moved to this room I was a nervous wreck. To make a long story short after having to put a fraud report on my credit file and cancel many credit cards etc. I asked the Wyndham if they would credit us the last few nights of our stay not even because of the break in but because we paid for an oceanfront room and they moved us into a tiny room with no windows and a door which was not even safe. Management told us they could not do anything for us and that we would need to take care of things on our own and use our homeowners insurance. Daytona Beach Police detective we are working with said this resort has alot of security issues and advised us to not stay here ever again.

<Title>“DON'T Stay At Ocean Walk - Rip Off”
<Content>Stayed for a week in June and went almost 3 days without A/C. Stayed in 3 different rooms (2 of which - needed major repairs). Management offered to reimburse us for one nights stay due to A/C issues, but, could not adjust our bill before check-out. Was told it would take 30-45 days to refund my credit card. Needless to say, I have not received a refund. Three e-mails, half-dozen calls to management have gone unanswered. We cancelled our resort time share visit....and glad we didn't make things worse by getting a time share through Wyndham. Have made a complaint with State of Florida!

<Title>“DO NOT STAY HERE!!!”
<Content>We were very excited to stay here due to the location ammenties available. We rented from Wyndham itself not from an individual owner. When we got to our room we found it very ill stocked and in disrepair. There were only 2 forks, 2 knives, no cooking utentils other than 2 large spoons and just a few glasses. This is a one bedroom unit for 5 people. Many things were broken and did not work. The wall paper was falling off the walls, the paint/plaster was falling off the walls, and there were huge water spots in the ceiling right above the bed were it had been leaking. The worst was the toilet that did not work from the moment we got there. (only one bathroom) It was thursday..by friday the maintence man "fixed" it...it still did not flush right. Friday night we were told on sat they would have someone to fix it at 9am. We left the room and came up for lunch, not one person had been in our room at this point. I called the desk and was told "they are coming right up" We came back at 430 to find "Dumb and Dumber" the "plumbers" attempting to fix the toilet. I was then told they had to pull the toilet. When I asked how long that would take I was told it would take hours and was advised to "use the public bathroom by the pool" . This is on top of all the hastle already including the fact we didn't even have pillows in our room and when I called for some I was told "we are out because people take them home" We did not get pillows until after 24 hours of my begging did they finally bring us pillows. They also finally brought us cooking items. I had to get the manager involved into getting our room moved after the toilet incident. He did move us to another room not before the plumbers broke the water shutoff taking out the toilet flooding the room. The grounds are needing a good cleaning and the bottom of the pools are black with dirt that you could see from our 19th floor room. There is paint peeling everywhere on the pool deck and no one had ever cleaned the pool. The lazy river is green and needed to be cleaned as well. As far as their activities dept. It consists of a bunch of college kids that are just "putting in their time" and do not care about making it fun for kids or families. The Ocean Walk could be a nice place due to the location but no one cares at all about it and it is falling apart. Someone needs to take charge in the acti. dept and get the lazy college kids who sit around all day reading magazines and fight over who has to go outside and run a 5 minute program. It was disgusting to watch. Makes you feel really welcome and want to come back.

<Title>“Lack of Management”
<Content>This place is a beautiful hotel so dont get me wrong in my interpretation but the Management or lack thereof was something that really ticked me off. We were on a fourday three night getaway for our anniversary and on day two we were the unfortunate recipients of a hammer drill a floor below tearing up tile in the kitchen or room beneath us. When trying to get to the bottom of the noise I attempted to call the front desk and ask what was going on. 15 minutes, two disconnects and a number of transfers later I finally got a customer care rep from god knows where in the hotel. I asked for a front desk and I got a run around. I asked for a manger to call me to see if I could be relocated to another room if this was going to be going on during my stay. Of course I got no call back and the manager blew me off. Not even a call back. Hence LACK OF MANAGEMENT title. It was a very disappointing piece of our little getaway but the rest of the stay and hotel was extremely nice. Location, Location. Location. They have that going for them. Just dont plan on sleeping late if an adjacent unit is working on their unit.

<Title>“Front desk service was poor, hotel needs updating, and not worth the money they charge.”
<Content>We tried to check in early and the front desk staff was very rude about it and made us wait for over an hour. Meanwhile, the bellhop had our stuff and followed us around and tried to get us into the room early. It all seemed a little shady. Since it's also a timeshare, they were always trying to sell us. You can tell the hotel is getting older and needs updating. I feel for the money we spent to stay, the whole place could have been cleaner and more modern. Pools were ok, but seemed dirty. On our third and last night there, there were teenagers partying in the room next door. They were loud, smoking, and when we finally called security they didn't do much but quiet them down for 10 minutes. If they have an age limit to check in and get a room, it certainly was not enforced. I will not go back to this hotel and will not recommend it to anyone.

<Title>“NIce hotel, front desk not helpful!”
<Content>Nice hotel to stay the rooms where clean, I felt like we where staying in a bettter part of town, the rest of Daytona looked run down. The front desk wasnt helpful and couldnt answer question very well. We had a car topper that we had to take off because the parking garage wasnt tall enough, asked the front desk if they had any where to store it was told they didnt, found out the last day that they did have a storage place for it. Which was nice to know after our stay was over. After we had it in our room during the stay. Also there is a wheelchair elevator that goes down so you dont have to leave the hotel to go next door, they didnt know that there was one, we where told by another member of staff that we could get a key for it through our stay, we ending up getting the key after having to explain to them what we where talking about. Asking other questions at the front desk we didnt get good answers. As for wireless internet you have to go to the lobby to use it, its not avalible in the rooms.. All and all our stay was good I would recommend this place!!! Also it did look like we where in a better part of town, staying there. Also if anyones wondering about handicapp access to beach they do have it!!

<Title>“One of the best vacations we have ever had!”
<Content>This was our second visit and after reading many comments on Trip Advisor, we were really nervous about our stay. We arrived late on a Saturday night with a huge challenge - Saturday in one room and a transfer to another for the remaining six nights. After hearing horor stores, we checked in. Not only were they accomodating, but we were able to complete the paperwork for both rooms, given a 2pm check out and were told that they would have a bellman pickup everything and hold it until 4pm on Sunday (even the food).....Not to worry as we called on Sunday at noon and were able to check out and check into our new room on our own. The 2br deluxe room was on a corner on a high floor facing the beach... the only negative was some worn carpet in the master bedroom. Other than that, perfect. Given that many schools had already gone back, the vacation crowd had thinned down.... Security was present by the pools, but did a lukewarm job of enforcement. The computers in the main room were always in use, but the ones in the "adults only" room were always available. The beach was terrific, the pools were clean, the lazy river was too warm for us..... The most impressive thing was when a horrbile storm moved in and how quickly the staff evacuated the entire pool area...the beach patrol should be commended as well as the entire Daytona Beach was evacuated in 15 minutes.... Ocean Walk is worn, but much better ammenities than when it was operated by Fairfield. The only true negative was the parking lot.... if you get in late, you may end up getting a voucher from the front desk and parking in the public lot accross the street. It doesn't appear that the parking lot is monitored for who is legally parking there.

<Title>“Would Never Stay At This Resort Again....”
<Content>We had $1150.00 stolen out of our room while we were at the pool. The money was in my husband's pants pocket with a shirt over the pants. He went to our room at 11:30 to get something to drink and found a maid coming out of the room with a purse on her shoulder. Security checked and her card was the only one that had been used in our room. The hotel was VERY uncooperative, the police were very helpful but the money is gone. The general manger of the hotel said they are finished with it and we will have to work with their insurance company. Even their insurance company said the hotel is not being very cooperative with them. Bottom line DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

<Title>“Threadbare but did the job”
<Content>We stayed in a condo unit that included a bedroom, bath with tub and shower in separate rooms, full kitchen, foldout couch in the living room, and a balcony with a view of the pool area and beach. Got whiffs of wireless internet, but couldn't get a good connection in our room. The room was pretty beaten up - the foldout couch was broken, shelves coming apart in the refrigerator, microwave "repaired" with tape, stained and threadbare furniture. In other words, we felt right at home! Seriously, if we were picky about that kind of thing, we probably would have walked out and asked for another room as soon as we walked in. Amenities are good at this hotel - several pools, waterslide, lazy river, excellent beach access, indoor miniature golf, gameroom, and so on. Lifeguard and other staffing at the pool area is almost nonexistent. Good place for the kids, they had a blast. Management was sort of responsive - they got to things when we stayed on them. The value was good, being able to fix your own breakfast and lunch in the kitchen saves big bucks. We'd probably come back.

<Title>“I never thought I could enjoy Daytona so much! Be back next year!”
<Content>Every year we take a family vacation to Ft. Lauderdale. The beaches are beautiful and the Wyndham Resort there is Gorgeous. This year my family (my husband, my kids 5 & 3, myself, sister and parents) decided to check out somewhere new. I found this hotel, convinced them to book and felt great about the decision. A few days before the trip I read reviews here for the hotel. I got nervous. People seemed to not enjoy this hotel. I thought for sure vacation would be a disaster (My family is not that easy to please). HOWEVER, the view from the room was amazing! It looked right at the beach and the pool area. The room was clean, sure the dishwasher was loud, the dryer was loud, didnt really dry our towels and we couldnt hang them over the rail. We just ran them when we weren't in the room. Yes, the elevators were slow, but theres alot of people at the beach in the summer. The parking situation is kind of ridiculous. I had to pay to park my car at another hotel, because only one car per reservation is allowed to park at the hotel due to the small parking area they have. Other then that, I never wanted to leave. there is so much to do! There are two pools, a lazy river (which is green on purpose), and a kiddie pool splash area, yeah you had to wear a bracelet while in the pools, but oh well. The chairs at the pool are all taken but if you really need one get there early. We barely sat in them anyway.The beach is RIGHT THERE and it is so clean. the sand was soft, the water was clear and we even saw dolphin! The Ocean Walk Village is right next door, but we never even took advantage of it because we cooked in the room every night. We were going to try to go somewhere new next year but we had so much fun that we are going back instead!! (Yes check in is slow, so send off the family to check out all the exciting things they will experience instead of driving you crazy while you wait for the fun to begin!!)

Our view from our balcony was excellent and the location is great for shopping, dining and relaxing by the pools and beach. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. My daughter celebrated her 17th birthday here and she had such a good time. She says she will never forget it. Great memories were made here,and that is what matters the most!

<Title>“Great Stay, a bit crowded though...”
<Content>My wife and i are long term owners of Worldmark, Trendwest, now owned by Wyndham. This resort is labeled as a Wyndham resort, and only a few floors are dedicated to Worldmark owners. i first have to say that the the staff was friendly, there is an onsite little market place that is convenient, and the prices were reasonable. there is also an interior bar that we didnt get to experience because of the open times, however, the bar outside by the pool area that also served food, was fine enough. the location of the resort is smack dab in the middle of Daytona Beach and is right on the sand. there are many other hotels surrounding the Wyndham Ocean Walk, including the Ocean Walk shops, VERY CONVENIENT. there is a Sloppy Joes, a Mai Tai bar/restaurant, and many other touristy places to venture. we also had the opportunity to watch a Summer Jazz festival that was going on while we were there (Aug 15th). the patio at the Mai Tai bar had a perfect view of the stage while we sipped our coctails. there is also a family fun center literally across the street from the hotel on the adjacent block called Daytona Lagoon. very fun arcade for kids, water park, bumper boats, and go carts. the hotel itself had 2 different pools with a lazy river and 1 kiddie area. the main pool had a slide that the kids and adults enjoyed. while we were there, there was also a very large inflatable water slide that cost $20 unlimited per day, or $3 per ride. most of the kids LOVED this ride. i'm not sure how often this is available, but i assume it's for the entire summer. there is a gate entrance from the pool area that leads you directly onto Daytona's Beach...very convenient! there were also beach bicycle rentals directly on the beach, along with some snack trucks if you get hungry on the beach, and dont feel like pool bar food. the resort rooms themselves were very comparable to what we're used to at Worldmark. Fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer. we stayed in a 3 bed 3 bath room because we had not only our family but two other families with us. we live in Jacksonville, FL, so it's only an hour and a few minutes away for a convenient weekend getaway, which is how we vacation anyway. the only thing i have to say about this resort, is it is a bit crowded for a Worldmark resort. as Worldmark owners, we do enjoy the exclusivity of being Worldmark/Trendwest owners. this Wyndham resort is extremely big with many accommodations, and was extremely busy...i'd say to capacity. i wouldnt say it was PACKED with people, but i will say that it was much busier than what we're used to with our exclusively Worldmark resorts. of course, this didnt bother the kids, since they just make new friends with the other families present. i'm guessing this hotel was this busy because we are in the Summer Vacation period, just before school starts. most families just want one last weekend getaway before the busy school year starts; this is the reason for us anyway. there is a put put miniature golf (free) on the 4th floor of the South tower, an underground pool hall and entertainment room, as well as an arcade right next door, an indoor pool, and even a business center with free internet where i saw a lot of teen agers facebooking :) there was no free internet in any of the rooms, but i suspect if you bring your laptop to the business center, there will have likely been wi-fi available. one last thing, the resort on the North side of the Wyndham buildings (opposite of the Ocean Walk side), did have a bar and pool of it's own. i believe this is the Hawaiian Inn Owner Rentals. our balcony and master bedroom faced the ocean, and the Hawaiian Inn's bar and pool were directly below us. at night, they have a singer there on Saturday night, and the noise came through the windows on our 14th floor that made it difficult to go to sleep. the music was on until about 1 am, so please take that into consideration. besides the noise from the neighboring hotel, and the amount of people, this resort was very nice, and very accommodating. i will say, that the floors reserved for Worldmark guests were VERY QUIET in comparison to the rest of the resort...likely on purpose. great hotel, great stay...definitely recommend for a FAMILY stay...

<Title>“Not what it used to be....”
<Content>We have been staying @ Ocean Walk for over 10 years and this was undoubtable the worst stay in all those years. We typically rent from a condo from an individual and have on occassion stayed in the "hotel" portion. But this trip booked through the online website was the most disappointing. I don't know if there has been a change in ownership or what but things were just not up to par. We picked this place due to the extra things they had to do there for the kids. However, the slide in the big pool was closed every time we went down to let the kids swim and the play gym thing in the kiddie pool NEVER worked the entire time we were there. Plus the lazy river /lagoon thing was a yucky pee yellow color. I just felt that they place was not being kept up as it was in the past. Plus the service was pitiful...not enough parking, asked for extra pillows for the sleeper sofa and they didn't have them, gave us a mattress pad and said use it. Plus the dishes in the room were very slim only one small sauce pan, had to call for one big enough to cook macarroni...so overalll I was not pleased. In addition, the room we booked was suppose to have an ocean view but we didn't and they wouldn't do anything about upgrading us, said sorry they were overbooked and couldn't move us. So we were in an inside room with a window to the hallway that didn't have a curtain that shut all the way. I wished we had paid less and stayed at a place that was more concerned with whether we enjoyed our stay or not.

<Title>“looks nice on outside but inside is another story!!!”
<Content>This hotel is very overpriced for the rooms that are offered. I spent $400.00 on a room for the weekend and was very disappointed. I took my son for his 15th b-day and when we got to the room i was disgusted.. The couch had cigarette burns on it , rips, tears and the couch was dirty!!! The barstools at table same way.. I went to complain at front desk and they basically did nothing...I also called the number I was given, which is the manager of reservations and he would call me back. It is now August and cannot get anyone to call me back.. For the amount of money they want for the rooms you would think they could maintain and keep rooms clean.. Very big disappointment.. Also just to let you know it is true about waiting 20 minutes or longer for elevators..The only good thing was the pools very nice.

<Title>“The experience was wonderful, I did not need to leave the property”
<Content>My only qualms were that the mattresses were too soft, so I did not rest well. Second, the fitness center needs updated equipment and more exercise options. There were no floor to use for stretching nor were there any large or small balance balls. I asked about these items at the service desk and was informed that the they were in the Wyndham Cafe, which to my knowledge has never opened, therefore unavailable. some of the fitness weight machines were rusty. I suggest obtaining newer equipment with the TV monitors. Aside from those issues, I truly enjoyed the facility.

<Title>“Had a great time, but you NEVER comply with our special request of a lower floor for THREE years in a row!”
<Content>Last year we were stuck on the 15th floor and this year we were really stuck on the 19TH floor. I am deathly afraid of heights so enjoying the balcony was a totally out for me. It did ruin a good portion of my trip especially in the evenings. We were told by a hotel employee that we should call two weeks in advance and check on our special request. I really don't know why this would be necessary when it was noted on our reservation. We asked for a king size bed and that request was granted so I'm not sure what the big problem is with asking for a lower floor. Oh well, we will be coming back next year with our son, daughter in law and their three very young sons and we'll see if you can get it right then when we ask again for a lower floor and two rooms together. I can just imagine losing the two year old on an elevator on one of the higher floors. I can assure you if our request is not complied with then we will be down at the front desk demanding that the manager do something!!! The three previous years when we complained the staff said nothing could be done for us which we thought was a very lax attitude considering the money we spent on those rooms all these years.. One other note, since we were stuck on the 19th floor the air conditioners on the roof were incredibly loud and very distracting especially when trying to sleep. Also, I would recommend after staying there all these years, please install ROOM DARKENING shades as the hall lights keep the bed room light all night long and is very annoying when trying to sleep! Other than these few complaints we keep coming back year after year because of the location..

<Title>“Very Nice but not worth the money!”
<Content>You can definitely tell a difference between the rooms they rent out and the time share rooms. Our room was nothing special, no better than the Holiday Inn. We had cigarette burns on our comforter, the bath tub looked older than dirt and we didn't have a little basket with salt/pepper, sugar etc like the time share rooms had. I will say that it's a gorgeous view and the kids loved the kiddie pool which was a good thing since the lazy river and the other 2 pools were dirty as ever, bugs, hair, green water. ICK, I didn't even want to swim in them. The best part of our trip was that we were there to spend time with our family that we don't see that often, so overall we had a great time!! But for a few more dollars a night, you can stay at the Ritz!

<Title>“Disappointing”
<Content>I traveled with four families. One of the families in our group arrived around 10 p.m., and they were told that the hotel was overbooked. All of our rooms were paid in full a week before our arrival. The manager on duty that night was not very helpful or apologetic. However, they were able to accommodate them the next day. They were put up in another hotel about a mile away and were told that they would be reimbursed for the night. It has been 3 weeks and they have not reimbursed them yet. The rooms were spacious but I didn't feel overly comfortable. The hotel stayed overbooked and our party was not interested in staying the whole week because we were very unhappy with the service and management, so we asked if we could get a refund since we wanted to leave early and they were overbooked and had people coming in that wanted rooms that they were turning away. They told us no and that if we checked out early that they would not be renting any more rooms. My toilet kept breaking throughout the week. We were so unsatisfied that we lost out on our money and left two days early.

<Title>“security guards acting like third world military”
<Content>saw security guards smoking while on patrol in parking garages? Beach the only plus, the facility itself too old with constant painting going on. They should decide if this is for adults or family resort. as a couple walking around hardly felt like a guest there as it seemed you were always being watched. not enough elevators-need to install add-on outside elevator-should not be hard to do. In all, not a good value.

<Title>“This is the worst trip to Daytona Beach in 10 years.”
<Content>To start our vacation, I had reserved 3 oceanfront rooms for about $2,000, for the week. When we checked in ,the lady at the front desk was very hateful. The room was not as clean as it could of been, I had asked for some fresh towesl and I was told to "wash them". I am on vacation, I did not come to wash towels. I had an EZ Up and a pair of flip flops stolen. The lazy river was nasty, it had green water and there was something growing on the bottom. The pool also had a greenish tent to it. This was my first and last visit to OceanWalk.

<Title>“Great location & great amenties.”
<Content>For the most part everything was great, but like anywhere there were issues. We had a studio which was fine for a family of 4who was not going to be in room much. Kitchen had everything you need. Bathroom is huge, but could use towel racks & hooks. Housekeeping slow & not effiecient, but IS CLEAN. Had a broken lamp & it was never repaired or returned during out stay, even though we asked. Housekeeping never came by in our 3 day stay. We did ask for more towels & never got them. Typically there is a phone book & flyers stating the hotel/resort amenties & info. There was nothing, no pen, no paper, no nothing. Beds were fine, pillow sucked, no other description there. Upon arrival there was only 1 very slow person working desk (1pm). Later in the day I did see a couple more people. Had 2 pools indoor nice size. Outside there is a Lazy river, 1 pool w/ volleyball net, 1 pool w/ slide, small kids play area w/ water. Sits right on beach & next to shopping movie theaters.

<Title>“Great place for families”
<Content>I was worried about this trip after reading the other reviews. I shouldn't have been. The best advice is to not judge your vacation based on check-in! This is a huge resort, and check-in was a very overwhelming and time-consuming process. However, others in line that had been there before said it was the most crowded they had ever seen it, and that it is not always that way. I booked direct through the hotel's 1-800 number. We got the exact type of room that we requested with no problems. We stayed in a one-bedroom oceanfront. The room, while a little worn around the edges (perfectly understandable given the volume of people they cycle through there), was good size, and while the beds were firmer than I am used to, they slept surprisingly well. The room was adequately equipped with everything we needed. Plenty of towels and nice bed linens. The elevators were only slow on Saturday during check-in times. We had no issues with slow elevators for the rest of our stay. The pool was very crowded, and the chairs were usually full, but we never went without one for a long period of time. People were always coming and going, and several people offered to give up their extras when they saw us looking. I think people just need to be more realistic in their expectations. This is a condo, so there is no maid service. I've never been to a popular condo on the beach where pool chairs are not hard to come by, so that is not unique to this resort and should be expected. The rates were way less than a comparable room at the Hilton, so you can't expect Hilton quality. Manage your expectations, and you will be well pleased with this resort. We thought it was a great value. We loved the convenience to the Ocean Walk Village next door, and we played the indoor miniature golf course multiple times. The Saturday night fireworks next door were a great start to our vacation. As long as you don't mind the crowds, this is a great place for families with kids because there is so much to do. We have already recommended this hotel to friends, and we will be back!

<Title>“Can't Wait to Return”
<Content>We just returned from a weeks stay at the Ocean Walk. We stayed in 2225A & 2225B; both were just as advertised. There are plenty of pools and the walk to the beach couldn't be shorter. I would like to address the "pool fights" mentioned by a previous review. I personally was down at the pool a couple of times when it opened at 8:15am. I put my towel on a chair sat down and spend the remainder of the day in my chair. I do not have a problem with security removing towels that are put on chairs at 8:15 to hold the chairs and not occupied until after 10:30am. The rules clearly state "no chair holding" for more than 30 minutes. In many of these cases the towels were not removed for a couple of hours. If you don't like the rules at the pool, bring your own chairs & set them up on the beach. Those of us that follow the rules do not appreciate your complete disregard for them. The only issue we encountered were slow elevators & limited parking but with the size of the buidlings & the fact they were completely booked this was not unreasonable. The staff was friendly; the hotel & grounds were clean; we will definitely be back.

<Title>“Wonderful Resort!”
<Content>We have just returned from the Wyndham Ocean Walk, and it was fabulous! We were in a unique situation in that, through no fault of the resort, we had three separate suites during our 5 night stay (don't ask!) We stayed in a 1 bedroom ocean front suite, and two different 2 bedroom ocean front suites. We traveled with 2 adults and 2-12 year old boys, and due to the generous dimensions of the unit with the two sofas in the living area, we actually could have been comfortable there for our entire trip. Of course the two bedroom suites were even better! The one in the North tower was gorgeous and had a connecting bedroom and living room balcony, but the guys were disappointed that there were no flat screen tvs in that unit. The two bedroom in the South Tower had flat screens in all of the rooms, which they loved! The only sour note was that at our initial check-in on Saturday we noticed some pretty disappointed guests whose accommodations were not what they expected based on the promises of third-party booking agencies. The front-desk staff was polite, but not able to make the desired changes. However, for each of our three check-ins, we found them very helpful and willing to make adjustments to suit our unique needs (such as late check-outs from one unit and early check-ins to the other.) My husband did have to stay on top of the situation, however, because this is a very busy resort!! It was very clean, the facilities were excellent, and the beach was beautiful! We highly recommend it, and intend to return next year.

<Title>“Fights at the Pool”
<Content>Wow! If you want to get into fights at the pool, then this is the resort for you. As is the case in many resorts, there is a "no holding chairs" policy. Everyone still does it anyway. The resort's policy is to tag a chair if they are left unattended for a half hour. After another half hour, if the security guards do not notice anyone using the chairs they put all items on the chairs into a bag and send them to a location inside the hotel where the guest would need to pick them up. So you and your family go up to the room to get a change of clothes or a snack for the kids or may even take a walk on the beach and when you come back down, your chairs are being occupied by someone else, who have had the same thing happen to them the day before so they are nasty and obnoxious. This, of course, leads to an argument. The guests of this hotel are caught in a vicious cylcle.They arrive happy and look forward to a relaxing vacation and by the second day they realize they need to invoke their more aggressive side. Your relaxing vacation turns into anger and frustration. There are also not enough elevators which caused very long lines. There are also not enough luggage carts. We wound up carrying up all of our groceries by ourselves. This took many trips and, of course, we waited in long elevator lines while we were doing it!

<Content>We had a great time! room was awesome...we stayed on the 4th floor, rm 409?? i think. Ocean Front Can't think of a single complaint honestly...oh except the railing on the bottom of the slider...its like 3 inches high and i hit my toe on it couple times....ouchy. No problems checking in, no problems checking out. Bath and Body products was and awesome touch. Kitchen had everything you need. bed were comfortable. Even our sofa sleeper was actually comfortable. I walked sixty feet to the theatre. I would recommend this hotel anytime. My daugher did the kids thing once and she had a great time. Lazy river was down for a day...but no biggie.. Gotta get out early to reserve a chair near pool and or beach. Unless you plan on going site seeing around town, you don't need a rental car.....don't waste your money. I came from California and was scared because some of the reviews.....just get ocean front, nothing other. Beaches are cold in Cali...nothing like Florida.....Thanks Wyndham.

When I arrived we had a room with no door on the bathroom. We had two families and no privacy. They did not have another room and they came up and put curtains over the bathroom door.

<Title>“My overall experience was good. The only...”
<Content>My overall experience was good. The only thing that bothered me was the service I and my family received from Dan Palmer, a man who worked the front desk at check in. He was an older man and was very rude and condescending. He refused to assist my family when we tried to check in, to the point where he shut down his computer and literally walked away. His manager came out to assist us, and because he was younger than Dan, I don't think he even addressed his behavior. Other individuals that were working the front desk(Brittney and Terrell) were awesome. I would suggest that if Dan doesn't like working with all different people, he should find another job. The other issue with this location is that if you park on the premises, you should not make plans to stay out late because if the resort is at full capacity, you will not have a parking space. You will have to park at the facility across the street. You are given a voucher, so you don't have to pay for it, but you lose a sense of security that your vehicle is not in the same location that you are. The food in the onsite restaurant, The Eatery, was great! The staff was very friendly and worked as effeciently as they could to get orders out in a timely manner. The quality of the food was very good as fresh ingredients were used to prepare it(I asked).

<Title>“Clean, location, ammentities all there, not bad for a timeshare”
<Content>We have 2 kids (6 & 4 years old) and just stayed at the Wyndham OW using our timeshare. Overall, it was a great vacation. Pros: Great location, had pools, game rooms, activities indoors (i.e. gym, craft room, movie rental box for $1 a night). Room had kitchen (with granite counters, which was a nice touch); allowed us to eat in some meals and not eat out all the time. Free in-room wireless internet worked great for us. Being originally from Long Island AND traveling to Myrtle and outer banks, we did not consider the beach 'crowded'. Sand was nice, surf was great and there was pleanty of space to be found. Walking distance to Ocean Walk shoppes for restaurants, a huge water park/go-carts/arcade and several restarants, so if you didn't want to drive, you didn't need to. Concierge is helpful - we got some good discounts (i.e. free appetizers at local restaurants) and discounts on some tours - highly recommend seeking them out when you get there. Would recommend that you bring a canopy or beach umbrella and chairs if you plan on sitting on the beach. A local company rents them for $30 a day (one umbrella, small side table and 2 lounge chairs), but that gets very expensive and given how hot the sun gets, we needed to fork over the money. Next time, we will bring our tailgating tent and chairs to save the money. On the downside, like the other postings, resort does need some updating...specifically, we thought the room furniture (esp the beds) needed new mattresses, carpet can use replacing and the 1980s beach decor was dated. Air conditioner was very loud as well. While everything worked just fine, hotel needs to start investing a bit. If it's important to you, I would also specify Ocean Front vs Ocean View. There is clearly a difference. We had ocean view (which we could see the ocean from our balcony...but it wasn't the ocean front we were hoping for (walk on to the balcony and all you see is ocean. Beware, too - we were on the north side of the building - we could see directly into the neighboring buildings and right above the garbage dumpsters. So, at 6pm (when we wanted to have a drink on the balcony, it stunk outside from the full dumpsters. We couldn't even enjoy our ocean view. Additionally, elevators got very crowded quickly - so when you can jump on one, do it, even if you need to go down a floor before going up. Timeshares are typically no-frills (no daily maid service, clean your own, sales pitches), so none of that was a surprise to us. Overall, for a timeshare resort, this one is a bit better than others that we've seen. We would consider staying here again if our travels point to the beach. Enjoy!

<Title>“Very Disappointed”
<Content>I booked my room on-line not knowing that this was not a hotel it is a time share. The room I was given was someones condo that the Wyndham rents out for them. I did not know that I would not get daily maid service which you expect when booking a room at a hotel (I was informed this once I checked in and the next day no one came to clean and I inquired about this at the front desk). I had a 1 bedroom suite that was supposed to be able to accommodate 6. Once we checked in I noticed we only had 4 sets of towels in the bathroom so I tried to call downstairs but the phone was broken. After going downstairs 3 days in a row to ask for more towels (which I was told I could not have because I had to use what the owner provided) and for the phone to be fixed I finally got the phone fixed and another set of towels to accommodate my family of 5. It was impossible to find a lounge chair by the pool every day. The worst part of it all was that I let them convince me to sign up for a 90 minute tour of the time shares. After listening to their sales rep for 90 minutes and informing him that I vacation with my family (mother and sister) most of the time and would have to discuss what he was offering with them he rushed me into another room and did not even say thank you for your time or shake my hand. He treated me horribly for not wanting to buy into the time share that very second. I have been vacationing in Daytona Beach with my family since I was a child and this by far was my worst experience.

<Title>“Would love to go back!”
<Content>I went into this blindly. We decided to take a vacation in Daytona Beach and none of us had ever been there. We have never taken a family vacation and it was up to me to book and plan the trip. I got on the internet, searched vacation condos in Daytona Beach on vacationrentals.com and several rentals popped up. The pictures and description of the Ocean Walk were tempting, so I contacted the agent/owner listed and made the arrangements. She was very friendly and helpful. I also felt that she was very upfront with me. She explained that even with a request for an oceanfront condo, we might not get it. Our condo may be situated on a corner that had a view of the city and the beach. It was only after I booked and paid that I started looking at reviews of the place and my heart sank. There were tons of unfavorable ones and very few good reviews. I was almost sick. I decided to just make the most of our vacation and hope for the best. After a hellish trip from SW Indiana, we got to the resort. With six of us and tons of luggage, we took two cars. There is room for one car at the resort's parking garage and the other car (if you take two) has to be parked elsewhere. The only place we could find was across the street at the Ocean Walk Shops parking garage. That cost around $16 a day. Next time we will try to find cheaper parking for the extra car. Our trip entailed a two hour traffic jam so I had called the resort to let them know we would be arriving a couple of hours late. They noted it and assured me it was no problem. Let me first address the "cons" I read about and what I found in comparison. Crowded busy check-in: Folks, it's a huge resort with tons of people checking in. It's going to be busy. Be patient. If you didn't get the condo you thought you were getting, I bet it's not the desk clerk's fault. No maid/cleaning service/laundry service: The website makes it clear that there are washer/dryers in each unit so you can do your laundry. This isn't a hotel. You are responsible for cleaning, doing dishes, and such. I don't know how so many people misunderstood that unless they just did not read the descriptions. Need for more elevators and luggage carts: Huge problem. The resort is comprised of two towers with at least 23 floors (?) each. Only four elevators for each tower??? It gets very crowded and lines form at check-in, check-out, and when rain drives everyone in from the pool/beach. I don't know how many luggage carts there are, but they need more. Not only are they used for luggage, but we found it necessary, as did others, for hauling groceries to the condo. Be prepared to leave your driver's license to use a luggage cart. That being said, we absolutely fell in love with the Ocean Walk!!! We did get an oceanfront room with a beautiful view from the 19th floor of the north tower. The 2 bedroom condo was on a corner, the kitchen had the basics needed for cooking and dining for a family of eight. There were six of us, two parents and four children ages 20-8. We loved having the beach just steps from the resort. The putt-putt course on the 4th floor came in handy when rain came, as did the computer rooms and arts and crafts studio. There are tons of brochures and coupons available from the concierge. We opted out of the "sales pitch" and were never once pressured to attend or buy. The mini-mall next to the resort I found to be noisy, crowded, and pricey. Our stay was fairly low-key. Deep sea fishing, parasailing, and shopping was as exciting as we got. We loved it. The pools and lazy river all seemed very nice and the kids enjoyed all of them daily. Me, I want the beach. There is a towel service for beach towels. You can check out towels but be warned, it is $15 for each towel you lose and don't turn back in. We took our own beach towels, but used theirs also to keep from doing laundry all the time. We also took extra bath towels and that turned out to be a good idea. We were supplied with several bath towels, washcloths, kitchen towels, a few rolls of paper goods, some trash bags, small packets of laundry detergent and dishwasher soap, and some bath soap and shampoo. Go shopping when you get there to stock up. The washer/dryers are stacked units and small. One night the a/c didn't seem to be cooling. I called about it and had help within two minutes. They instructed what to do and even waited while I tried it. Remember to turn on the icemaker when you get there. All in all, I was surprised by the bad reviews I read. Maybe your experience depends on when you go. Maybe it's how the owner/agent handles the unit. Maybe some people are just never happy. I don't know, but we had a wonderful experience and will definitely go back.

<Title>“getting worse”
<Content>This was our 4th time staying at Oceanwalk, and the Experience is getting worse and worse. I would not say our stay was terrible, let me list the bad points first: The hotel is in need of some serious upgrades. Our kitchen appliances were pretty clean but looked heavily used. The support for the counter/table in the kitchen was very rusty or corroded. Carpet was clean but looked very worn/ and faded. Good luck getting in one of the hot-tubs in the evening--they seem to be always populated by rather seedy-looking characters drinking alcohol. And, while I'm not totally against the occasional alcoholic beverage, there seemed to be WAY too many people that were drinking heavily by the pool area for this to be a good family resort. As for the good....well the things I mentioned above are NOT terrible, it isn't the worse place I stayed. The lobby looks pretty nice. We didn't have a problem with parking. They do have 2 big pools and the lazy River outside that are accessible, and it is right on the beach. Bottom line is, we are going to look for other places to stay form now in in Florida until we hear that Oceanwalk is doing some major renovations. A building that is only 10 years old (or maybe a little less??) should not look like a 25 year old one on the inside.

<Title>“Try to rent from an owner as opposed to booking with the hotel”
<Content>This is our third year staying at Ocean Walk and we will stay again, but here is some advice. Try and book your room directly from an owner so that you will know what king of room you are getting. Our room, that was booked through the hotel, was a Motel 6 room at best. The room was in great need of repair and updating. Most appliances were broken, including the microwave and refrigerator! We also wanted a room with a king bed, but were given a room with two full beds. The hotel had overbookked and could not give us another room. When you pay $200 a night for a room, the room should not be such a disappointment. We are currently looking into other hotels in Daytona for next year.

<Title>“Bad Experience”
<Content>I just returned from my vacation on Sunday - stayed a whole week. I took 4 teenagers, ages 16 to 18. After returning from Wal-Mart, we were not allowed to enter the entrance door of our parking lot due to some blood in the doorway. Come to find out 1 of my 4 teenagers had been attacked after exciting the elevator. In the elevator, a thug was stepping on my daughters toes. She requested several times for him to stop, moved and he continue to purposely step on her toes. My 16 year old son told him to stop as well as the cousin. After the elevator stopped and my kids got off, the thugs got off and followed them to the parking lot. One of them punched my cousins child in the nose - blood everywhere. My kids went to the front desk to report. After I found out, myself and my cousin was with them - police, medics came. We requested they pull video - we wanted to file charges. They were older and these were 16 year old boys. My kids had perfect description and knew what floor they had punched. They were to contact us when the found them. After leaving, I had a bad feeling they were not going to even look for them. They had also punched a hole in the wall by the elevator. The thug actually knocked his girlfriend around some in all the commotion. This was a nightmare, and needless to say ruined the vacation. We were scared to let the kids leave us after that. The child with the broke nose is in surgery today. He also has nerve damage. The hotel cleaned up the blood and patched the hole in the wall really quickly, but never contacted us again to see how he was doing or anything. As the week went on, his face got worse looking and hurting more. I phoned the hotel today to let them know I was disappointed in them never following up. That I worried about them in the ocean and on the strip, but didn't know I had to worry about them in that nice hotel. I was just told I would need to contact the Daytona Police Department - that their security wouldn't be able to arrest or do anything. There was absolutely NO CONCERN over this severely injured 16 year old boy. I find this very disturbing as well as everyone I've told this to. PLUS<<<<< the elevator is a nightmare. At some times the line would be 50 people long,,,you would have to wait 5 or 6 times to be able to get on. The parking was just as bad. You had to hurry home from eating because after about 10:00 there were no parking places left (they only allow you one). If you don't have one, oh well - park across the street and pay 20.00 a day. The room was nice, but did have a hugh roach when we arrived waiting for us! They provided us with 2 washclothes. Luckily we had a washer & dryer and I had brought my own washclothes. AND,,,the lazy river is very nasty and green looking - I would not dare get in it. Other than that,,,everything was fine!

<Title>“Our room was a disaster!”
<Content>When we arrived and made it to our room the bedroom door knob was missing, the bathroom door knob was broken and would not shut and lock, the chair in the bedroom had it's seat sitting in the floor, the carpet was torn up so that the tacks were exposed and my two year old stepped on them, the toilet was constantly torn up. I was told over the phone that I had an ocean front room, but was not given an ocean front room, as a matter of fact I was instructed that ocean fronts were not available to anyone other than the owners during this particular week. There were no available rooms to move us to. In my opinion there should always be available rooms because there is always the possibility of problems and mishaps. The first gentleman who helped us was extremely rude. The outdoor activities and set up was great for my kids. Luckily they were not affected by the trashiness of the room. I do not feel that I got what I paid for, nor do I feel that anyone truly went out of their way to try and accommodate us for the distrubing room.

<Title>“Never again”
<Content>This is our second time staying at Wyndham Ocean Walk, however, this time it was horrible. My family of 10 was staying at Wyndham Ocean Walk in two connecting units from July 11-16, 2010. The first night that we went out for dinner, my laptop was stolen from the room. After making the report with Wyndham Ocean Walk's security and Daytona Police, I didn't hear from anyone regarding our case. I had to call everyday asking for answer and to speak with the manager but kept getting their voice mail or they were away from the office. No one had the courtesy to check on us or give us any update after they told me that they will check on their camera in the building for any lead. By the way, you need to watch out when you rented through a private owner and not directly with the Wyndham Ocean Walk people because they became very unfriendly when you needed help. We ran out of toilet paper in the middle of the night so I called downstair for help. They said that because we booked through a private owner so they wouldn't help us even we were willing to pay for the toilet paper. What kind of service do they serve there? I don't think I will be back there in our future! They are losing touch with how to be in the service industry!

<Title>“Absolutely RUDE!!!”
<Content>This hotel is gorgeous however, it is like some people, what you see is not exactly what you get. First, our room was not ready when it was supposed to be. Second, We reserved 2 condos... our mistake, under one name. Therefore, they would only give us one parking space and we had two families. The lady at the front desk was less than nice about the situation as she sat there with a snotty smirk on her face as she showed NO care in the world that we just spent a massive amount of money to stay at this nice "looking" resort. She explained that because the reservation was under only one name (even though two condos) we would have to find parking elsewhere (the parking garage across the street for about $20.00 a day (for us, a total of an extra $140.00) or if we wanted, we could park at the Hilton for a little less). How about next time, we stay at the Hilton. Anyway, with her cold hard staring at me and a continued smirk- my friend asked, "so if we would have made two separate reservations for the two condos, we would have two parking spaces" and she said yes. She said that there simply weren't enough parking places to have multiple spaces for one reservation. HELLO- we had two condos!!!! They should be able to accommodate each rental, each condo!!!!!!!!! Anyway, she just kept her smirk and even gave an evil giggle a couple of times. She also said no less that 10x's that they only give 1 space for a 4 bedroom- WHO CARESSSSS! We have two condos!! When I asked her if that made since to her she just shrugged her shoulders and again smirked!!!!! Unfortunately, Cruella Deville was training a young man at the time ......such a pity. Oh, she did offer for us to speak with her supervisor so he could tell us the same thing and what did she have on her face as she said that- that stupid smirk!!! And to concur with what the others said- elevators slow... ................................................ . The slide was not working, and the lazy river---NASTY GREEN!! Have fun future guests, because after years of staying here---- we will be moving on to the HILTON!

<Title>“Great beach Wyndham a disappointment”
<Content>The beach and area were awesome! The sand and waves were great. This was our fourth trip to this resort in as many years. We booked and got good rates. That is where the "deal" ended. We had requested two double beds for four adults. We got one King with a pull out sofa bed that should have gone to the dump. They said that they do not garentee beds!!! We requested bedding for the pull out and had to wait over three hours to get it. The rooms included washers and dryers. Our dryer was so bad that after waiting for an hour and a half, we hung our towels up outside to get them dry. The facilities needed a lot of repairs and things we had noted as needing maintenance last year still need repairs. Since they fill the resort on weekends I guess they do see the necesity in doing maintenance. We stayed the two nights planned and extended our stay but moved to the Hilton instead. A much better staff and they wanted to make our stay enjoyable. I don't expect to return to this Wyndham.

<Title>“Nice Condos, Great Location, but very Crowded!”
<Content>The condos are nice and spacious. Double beds are too small for 2 adults so be warned...Ocean Walk is in a great location if you don't have a car and they have shuttles to the grocery stores on certain days. We had a car, and never had a problem parking. However, if you plan on guests visiting, the will have to park away from the resort. They only allow one car per reservation and make you display your parking tag or you will get your car towed. Burger King is a good lot to park in for free or if you want to pay, the Ocean Walk complex has a huge garage you can park in. They do charge $20 per day for in and out privledges. The resort has no internet service in the rooms. The lobby has wireless service but it is verrrrrrrry slowwwwww. I gave up and used the computers in the business center, but their printer was out of toner so they allowed me to use the computer at the desk to print my boarding passes. The pool area is great, however everyone must wear a wrist band each time you go to the pool...also be sure to take your room key to the beach with you..you will need it to get back into the pool area....To get a lounge chair at the pool you have to get out there by 8:30 or 9am..it gets really crowded! I did like the fact that security makes frequent rounds and if they see seats that have been empty for more than 30 minutes they leave a notice..another few minutes pass and if no one comes back they bag up the belongings and free the seats up for people wanting to sunbathe. So don't put your stuff down on a chair and go to beach..or you will find your stuff in the security office... Lots of activities at the resort and at Ocean Walk Complex next door. Visit the concierge office for discounts on all kinds of things...it is open till 4p. Restraunts, movie theatre, shops and night clubs are all in walking distance and they have free concerts at the band shell and fireworks off the pier on weekends. If you have a car drive north on A1A a few miles up on the left and eat dinner at Charlie Horse....great price for crab legs...we went twice! Another nice place to eat is Top of Daytona which is south on A1A...go early 4-6p for a special price menu...it can get expensive eating there after 6..great view and great bar! We flew into Orlando which saved us $100 per person on airfare. We rented a car and it is only 55 miles to Daytona. You can also take a shuttle from Orlando for $70 per person...its cheaper to rent a car if there are a few of you. We are Wyndham owners, and are planning another trip to Ocean Walk in December hoping it will not be as crowded at June was...

<Title>“Dissappointed! Overpriced hotel resort with serious problems.”
<Content>The view from the 24th floor (room 2426) was incredible and room features were as stated; However, from there our experience went downhill fast. When you pay 600+ dollars per night, you tend to expect certain amenities as a stated "HOTEL". The hotel does not clean your unit, furnish fresh towels or linens, make beds and provide room service. When I asked about these issues at the front desk, the response I received was " sorry we are a timeshare location, we do not own the units or have the staff for those services. The following items are additional unacceptable experiences that we dealt with: 1. Our unit master bedroom sinks did not drain 2. the units exterior balcony and rails were dirty 3. our neighbors hanging towels and suits from balcony rails 4. hotel guest children running through the halls all night 12:00 AM + (playing hide and seek from floors 22 to 26) 5. the 4th floor putt-putt course when we played was used by hotel guest teenagers for throwing a football to higher floors above almost hitting us twice ( we eventually gave up and returned to the desk for a complaint) 6. the pools repair and maintenance is poor with tiles loose and falling into the water, leaking pumps, the floating river in the pictures is actually a green algae color which is not intentional 7. poor parking with not enough spaces for hotel guests 8. elevator waits from 2 to 10 minutes 9. timeshare sales offers and calls to the room to attend 10. few porters for the bags. 11. high speed internet is only available in the lobby. This is an overpriced hotel resort where the staff, management and guest children are obviously unsupervised and need further direction and leadership.

<Title>“worst place ever to stay in Daytona”
<Content>We paid for and reserved this room over the internet, I put in that we had 6 people staying. I tought it was great price for an oceanview room for six people...little did I know, when we got there, the kids were greatly overjoyed. The lobby was very nice, we get our keys and find a place to park. We get in this room and it is one bed room with a king bed and a sleeper sofa!!! I have an 11,9,4 and two year old plus my husband and I. I was not happy. My husband went down and was told that since we did not make a reservtion with the hotel directly they could not do anything, we would have to tak t up with the reservation desk...so we did and they told him that they could not guarnette bed space!! really? and then to top it off they would not refund my money so I could find a better place. Don't waste your money!!!!! Oh I might add the pools were dirty and it was a smokers paraisde!!!!

<Title>“Great location and amenities, horrible service and even worse beds”
<Content>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The Good...The place is wonderful for younger kids offering every amenity possible. The beach is right there with vendors renting umbrellas for shade as well as rental equipment for water fun. Ocean view rooms were just that. Head on views and beautiful. The Bad..Location couldnt be better for proximity to the Boardwalk and all the action; however, that comes with the cost of a zillion people to wiggle through at the beach and all around the pool area. If youre not at the pool at the crack of dawn to stake out your chair, just head to the beach as they wont free up till the end of the day when everyone clears out to have dinner. This causes an hour and a half wait for the good restaurants like Bubba Gumps and Sloppy Joes. Go early to eat and you'll save a whole lot of time. After 6 it becomes a madhouse. The Ugly..the beds are THE most uncomfortable beds we have ever slept in. We ended up in the sleep sofa which was a hair less firm than the slab of granite in the bedroom. The kitchen had mismatched everything and no frying pans, just a couple of pots of the cheapest quality. Having needed a couple of ketchup packages for some burgers we cooked in our only pot...I went to the tiki bar to pick up a few and was met by the condiment nazi that interrogated me for five minutes to decide whether or not I could have the ketchup. I had to lie, then give up my room number and say I just bought the burgers from the restaurant or she was not giving up the goods. $200 a night and I had to wrestle for 3 packs of ketchup. That was it for me. I choose not to wrestle for pool chairs or ketchup with a rough crowd bearing "jail ink" tattoos. I'll stay anywhere else where at least I can sleep in the bed!

<Title>“Filthy and rude”
<Content>Pool area looked cool, but absolutely filthy. One pool had an amazing amount of human hair floating in it and the other had thick grease smeared on the sides. The lazy river was an unusual shade of green which my 8 year old thought was due to the resort using real river water- sadly, she was wrong. Parking was terrible. Our non-smoking suite had cigarrette burns and the bed had blood stains. We were told they weren't planning on cleaning our room when we called about the blood, but after 2 calls and 4 hours, they did bring us some fresh bedding to change on the bed. Towels were strictly allocated and limited, but fortunately, the units have washers and dryers so you can wash the towels yourself. Check-out is early- 10 am- which would normally be okay except for the significant elevator problems and tight restrictions on luggage cart usage. With the exception of the employee who greeted us in the driveway, all employees were flippant and acted as though we were trying to scam them out of something(like clean bedding!). Also, they employ a person to go door to door to make sure that you do not overstay. While I can certainly appreciate the need to turn the rooms over quickly to prepare them for the next set of guests, I think there is a better way then having a person with a clipboard knock on your door at 10:02(not exagerating) and ask why you weren't gone yet(happened to friends). The kitchens are hit or miss as to how well stocked they are with utensils and cookware(we had friends staying in the same resort, so could pull together a spoon, pot, and colander between 3 rooms). My family used the stairs whenever possible (10 flights!) and the stairwell smelled of urine. Of course, we had numerous offers to buy timeshares while staying there. Also, security was very poor. Security guards roam the pool area to make sure that everyone has a wrist band who is using the pool, but the actual hotel is completely open to anyone who would wish to enter and you will receive several flyers each night under your door from local pizza delivery places. It is a shame because the hotel has the potential to be a nice place...I would have just laughed about the parking and the elevator had the hotel had a pleasant staff. The pool set-up is neat and the location is great, but the management is horrible.

<Title>“Wyndham screwed up big time with this resort! 2 thumbs way down!”
<Content>We just returned from a week vacation at the Oceanwalk. We were really excited about the stay, until we got there. I wish I would've read the reviews posted here before blowing my money at Oceanwalk. The resort is way too big for the amount of garage spaces and overall resort space allowed. You have to be in the parking garage by 8pm if you want a spot. Otherwise you have to park across the street in city parking because the garage is full. At 8:15am, guests line up in the lobby to run and get lounge chairs around the pool. By 8:30am...there's not a chair to be found. The security guard said this was a common occurence. I stood and stared with my mouth hanging open at the sight. It looked like Black Friday shopping. The hotel was booked to capacity so even the beach front was crowded. People were basically sitting on top of one another. We drug all of our things to the beach front of the Hilton located right next door. Save your money and go to a smalled hotel.Bigger is not always better!

<Title>“Do not rent from Wyndham-Holiday Express; rent from a private owner!”
<Content>Let me start be saying that I love the location and the resort - ONLY when I rent from a private owner. DO NOT rent from Wyndham/Holiday Express!!! I rented from a private owner last year and was VERY satisfied. I did not have a single problem. This year I made the mistake of renting from Wyndham or Holiday Express and will never rent through them again. I rented and paid for a 618 square foot studio suite that was supposed to have two beds, a couch, little living room area, kitchenette and an ocean view. When I checked in at the Wyndham, the front desk failed to advise that the air conditioning had been broke for over 24 hours. I soon realized that was the least of my concerns. After we brought our luggage to our room, I realized that Wyndham must have put me in the wrong room. Our room was no more than 300 square feet, no couch, no ocean view, unless I leaned over the balcony and looked beyond a building and only one of the two burners worked on the stove. The room was not updated as the pictures on the website shows. There was a VCR with a 32” bulky TV. The wall paper was tearing off the wall. The furniture was hideous with what appeared to be grease stains smeared all over. I have stayed at cheap hotels with nicer living conditions. The stove had grease an inch thick and the floors were very filthy. Having three adults and a toddler, this was not a room I wanted to stay in for the next 8 days. I immediately called the manager on duty, Guido, and explained to him that I am supposed to be in a studio suite and not a one person efficiency studio and that my room was filthy (I have photos of the filth that I will attach. If they are not with this review - this means management took them off and did not want you to view them.!..) and there was not an ocean view balcony. Guido advised that I was indeed in the wrong room, but there was nothing he could do because there were no more rooms available. He did not offer to have my room cleaned, a refund - NOTHING. He told me there is not one thing he can do to fix my problem. He gave a name and number and told me to contact that person at Holiday Express. I called the number three times that week and left three messages, but never received a call back. Luckily we had beautiful weather and did not have to be in our room much; I love the resort and will go back but would never rent through the Wyndham/Holiday Express again. On my last day, I explained my room situation to another manager who advised that I would receive 30% back on my charge card the following Monday for the "room mistake". I would have rather had more space in our room, been in the correct room with nicer living conditions and been able to hang our clothes instead of the four of us living out of suitcases for 8 days than the 30% money back.

<Title>“spectacular”
<Content>Th hotel is everything like the pictures show. The staff was so nice and friendly. We got there early and was promised a blacony view, but when we got there they told us that we didnt have one. This great guy "Dan the Man" helped us out and rearranged things so that we could have one, as promised! The room was so nice, with the best view of the city walk/ocean. The one draw back of this place was trying to get a lounge chair by the poolside. Your not supposed to save your chair unless your actually sitting in it, but I noticed that at 800am, people were out there putting their towels on the lounges to save them. This wasnt fair, because by the time we got out there at 10am nothing was left! Too many people for the size of the pools lounges, but the beach is just a hop, skip & a jump away, right behind the pool area. Citiwalk is right next door connected to the hotel, so thats makes it awesome to go there anytime you want, no need to move your car, everything is in walking distance. Be aware tho if your bringing more than 1 car in your party(per room) you have to park across the street at the muni lot, and they charge a fortune! They charge you $8 per every 12 hours, but you have no choice to put your car anywhere else. It cost me $64 to get my car out!! Overall, I would stay again, the beauty of the hotel, the size of the rooms, the cleanliness, friendliness and everything else makes it worth staying!!! We had a great time!! Beautiful hotel with so much to do!!!

<Title>“Very poor customer service”
<Content>The hotel itself, pools and amenities were fabulous. Im pretty sure it dosen't get much better than this. We stayed there 3 nights/4 days and just walking into the room after an easy check-in made our day. Then the problems began. First night, the refridgerator stopped working, wich by the time I realized, spoiled most of the food I had bought. The lady at the front said she would reimburse me, just to bring her a list or a reciept, wich I did then we never heard from her again. The repair man was in and out that evening for about four hours, sometimes two of the to fix the problem, they replace the fan, but the fridge never did cool right. On to night number two. This was the start of a very hot vacation. The airconditioning in the room stopped woking, once again, repair men all over the place, they temporarily fixed the problem, only for the air to quit working again the next morning, we were told they were still working on the problem that they merely put a "band-aid" on the previous night, wich at $230.00 a night, Im sorry but I do expect more than a band-aid! On to the thirsd and final night of the trip, once again no air, and its late june in Florida and 100 degree weather! This time we did not get a repair man we were promised one, but he never showed up. Upon complaining to a manager, Jared Lunea, we were promised back a full refund from the nights stay that we did not have air. I was happy with that even thou it was two hot sweaty evenings my family and I spent with no air, but the problem is this, we never got the refund. We continue to call and leave messages and still get no return phone calls, we were then directed to another gentleman by the name of Peter with a Orlando phone number who is supposed to be in charge of the refunds, can't get passed his voicemail or even get a call back. Your hotel is magnificent, and would of been highly recommended, until the aftermath of a few different solutions to problems that your employees said they would resolve and then did not. At this point I am going to start calling the corporateoffice, better business beuro and complain to anyone anywhere anytime that will listen to me. Thank you for taking the tim to read this, if you did, Im sure I will never know as your company obviously does not put customer satisfaction at the top of its list, nor keeping their word.

<Title>“Never Again”
<Content>The first room we were given was very nice but not what I had reserved so I asked to see a oceanfront room, Joyce said no and switched us anyway. The room was horrid, dirty carpet, torn furniture, air conditioning had to be worked on and I wasted my beach time waiting for the lock to be fixed on the door. The room and the thought of what we had see first ruined my time in Daytona all together.

<Title>“Overall a good experience.”
<Content>Overall the desk staff was good although somewhat distant. I left a shirt in the room and notified security in the afternoon. The room was already occupied and I didn't feel the staff was interested in making contact or assisting me in obtaining my shirt. It was an "Oh well" attitude. I had to make the suggestion to call the room. In all fairness, other than this, which was my own fault, it was an enjoyable stay. (never did get the shirt back)

<Title>“Everything that could go wrong at this place did!”
<Content>First- Check in- didn't have the room I requested. After 45 minutes was able to give me my room. Room needs deep cleaning and painting! Sofa bed matt was filthy! Couldn't use! Thankfully, I had an air matt! Power went out and people were trapped in elevators. Only 1 elevator working for 19 floors. Parking garages get full. We had to park across the street and pay. Then wait a half an hour to get reimbursed the next day. Air conditioning went out for the whole north tower and they had to go around and flush each air conditioning unit . We were told at 8:30 am that our name was on the list. 13 hours later we went down to front desk and find out no one put our name on the list. We asked if we could leave and not have to pay for that night and were told the charge was already on our credit card and they don't have the authority to do credits at the hotel because I booked over the phone. So we were stuck there. By chance when we went upstairs after complaining Maintenance was in the unit next to ours and they came in and flushed our air conditioning. Then it started working. We decided to stay up late and watch some T.V.. We could only get Channel 2. I called the front desk and was told that the cable was out.. Wow!!!! This place was unbelievable! I am glad we only stayed here for 3 days! Daytona in itself doesn't look to have very nice properties to stay at . From the looks of the Wyndham it looked to be one of the better ones. I guess looks are definitely deceiving. The last kicker of the trip! >>> When I goy home my credit card statement was waiting for me. I open it up and I am already charged for my stay. The place also charged me $25. twice for the resort fee.. I called them up and was told " Oh yes, we did make a mistake we will credit you next month." So word of advice make sure to check your statements! The Wyndham is not the place I would ever consider for a vacation. All it did was cause stress and worry! This is my honest opinion!

<Title>“Very crowded, 30 minutes to get elevator”
<Content>We booked a two bedroom unit through the resort. Be careful getting a unit high up because there are not nearly enough elevators for the resort....only 4 elevators per tower. You will have to wait 30 minutes for an elevator unless you get on a lower level where you can use the stairs. Our unit did not ever have a DVD player, just a CD player, so don't forget to ask. Internet only available in lobby. They do not come to tidy up your room or exchange out towels. They police the pool area with 2 security guards. If you leave your belongings on a table or chair you will be left a note to notify you that your belongings will be removed if they are left for more than 30 minutes. The indoor pool had so much chlorine that you could harldy breathe while being in the room. Also lazy river and one pool were green during our stay....from the 21st floor you could see the algae growing in then. They even had to close the lazy river one day until 4pm. I assume it was because they had to shock it. The place holds so many people that it is worse than being at Disney World during busy season. Even the beach out front is so crowded that you cannot enjoy letting your children play while you watch because they will get "lost" in the crowd. Yeah the idea of a lazy river makes you want to stay there, but your kids will never get a turn. Sign says capacity is 30. Not nearly enough tubes. Security will make you leave the river without tube and nobody makes the children take turns.

<Title>“Not for me”
<Content>Beds are not comfortable, rooms are not clean. I didn't realize there is no maid service. The location is good, but the rooms are not very clean and for the price they should be very clean. I received a call the day after checking in from the people in charge of trying to get you to buy into a timeshare. Even after checking in at the desk and talking to the man upon check-in. They insisted that I tell them who I spoke to (I don't remember I'm on vacation). They told me they would call me every morning until I was able to recall who I spoke with. Don't they know who works at the desk and at what time. Doesn't sound like catering to the vacationer is at the top of their list. The front desk clerk was singing to the radio as she checked me in---not very interested in making me feel welcome. We were never able to even get close to utilizing the lazy river ride, too crowded. Each morning well before the pool opens the squatters are down there laying out their towels, so it's impossible to get a chair at poolside. On the day of checkout as I was gathering up my luggage at 9:59AM the security people appeared at my door to see if I was checking out. Wow, I can honestly say I've never experienced anything like that before. Tacky hotel with very little concern for their guests. Choose another location.

<Title>“It was worse than a cheap motel!!!”
<Content>Upon check in, we noticed microwave cracked and held together with tape, screen was torn, and bathroom doors were broken so they locked when you closed the door. The first night I woke up to banging in the walls inside the unit near the a/c that lasted for two hours. The next morning the a/c in the entire building was out for 12+ hours. We complained numerous times and were told it would be fixed soon many times, but no one could give us specifically when. I was told at 5pm it was fixed only to go up to the room to find it still not working. After several trips and phone calls to the front desk and management, someone came at 9:30pm. Tried to cook dinner in the room and only 1 burner on the stove worked. Lock on room door would not latch properly and you had to play with it to make sure it was locked. Lazy river was green the entire time and other two pools were crowded and hazy. Inside pools smelled heavily of chlorine and one had lots of "stuff" floating in it. Phones did not work properly and getting someone to answer at the front desk was very hit or miss(mostly miss)! We have stayed at the Wyndham several times before with a pleasant experience. Unfortunately, it has gone down hill and we will never return. Front desk people are polite, but lie to you (this happened several times regarding the a/c) We got the same line as other reviewers, "oh sorry the units are privately owned and we can't help you". This is B.S. as I believe it is a timeshare, so no one individual owns the unit. Even if it was individually owned, I booked on the Wyndham website and they are suppose to be managing the place and upkeep IS their responsibility!

<Title>“Annoyed and Aggravated”
<Content>Wyndham Ocean Walk is a time share owner, and private condo owner place. Of course the location is great, right on the boardwalk. Restaurants and shopping at your fingertips. So although this was convenient, there were lots of inconveniences. For example, upon arrival, you have to leave your driver's license in order to get a shabby falling apart luggage cart that you have to "check out". Then you have to check out Towels and promise to pay for them if you lose one. There are so few chairs by the pool area that you are not allowed to leave your towels on them for more than 30 minutes or the security gaurd will take them to allow someone else to have a seat. So if you go up to your room for lunch then you might as well surrender your spot by the pool. Anyway, the pools are dirty and the lazy river has not been cleaned in a long while. There are never enough floating rafts for you to get in. They are not policed like the towels so you can stand there and wait for a raft and you still might not get one. If you want to go to the beach, the area in front of the resort is very crowded and the local chair/umbrella company sets up their rentals on the first line at the beach. These cost $25.00 day. So four days at the beach, $100.00 if you didn't bring your own chairs. If you did bring your own chairs you have to try to squeeze them somewhere in between or behind the ones that are already set up, unless you wait for the tide to go out, then you have to worry about it coming back in, soaking all of your stuff. We had a 3 bdrm unit, (which are ALL ocean front), but we had only two crappy chairs on the balcony to sit in. What good is a balcony if you cant enjoy relaxing on it? Our room was fine, but we had to ask for kitchen items that were already supposed to be stocked. They were supposed to come up and inventory the kitchen for all of the missing items and they didn't, they only brought two of the items I asked for that I needed. THERE IS NO INTERNET IN THE ROOMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You have to take your laptop to the lobby to get on the internet! Or go to the lower level computer room. Well, I happen to be addicted to the internet while I have my morning coffee in my PJ's. Even Quality INN has free WIFI in the room? The positives: The activity club was cool if you like to get involved, they had fun things for kids to do and adults. There are indoor pools, a great gym, an arcade, an adult lounge, and a kids play room. You can even check out movies.

<Title>“Not enough deck chairs -- dealbreaker”
<Content>People who have visited this hotel before know that in order to have a chair at the pool, you must line up at eight am with a bunch of towels. You rush in when security opens the pool at eight fifteen and drape your family's towels over as many deck chairs as you can. ALL of the chairs are draped with towels by eight thirty. Those chairs are claimed by those people for the entire day. So unless someone in your party wants to be part of that early morning chair rush, stay elsewhere. The hotel is nice enough, nice pools, nice beach but how can you enjoy the pools if you have nowhere to sit?

<Title>“Looking forward to our next visit.”
<Content>This was our first time staying at this resort. We booked a vacation after viewing your resort on-line. My family was impressed with all the activities available daily. The variety of pools were enjoyable. We took part in movie nights by the pool, kids crafts and contests, music and dances and volleyball daily. We would like to make a few suggestions to improve the appearance of your resort. Our children loved swimming in the big pool with the water slide. My husband and I wanted to avoid this pool as there we huge chunks of hair floating in the pool. We were disappointed that the pool was not cleaned daily. We believe that this could be avoided with the proper care. In addition, when we took our girls to use the restroom by this pool there were six toilets filled with fecal matter and paper. We can understand that people can be irresponsible but we were disappointed that staff members did not check and clean the restrooms periodically throughout the day. Lastly, we would appreciate that spills and trash be cleaned up off the pool deck occasionally. This is a large resort and we believe that constant supervision of these areas are necessary for good health and enjoyment. We felt the priority of the staff was to monitor pool chairs and not the overall cleanliness of the pool area. We hope you will take these suggestions into consideration to make these well needed improvements. We look forward to returning next summer and are encouraging four more families to join us. We truly had a wonderful time at this resort and can see ourselves making this a habit. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Eddie and Kristen Antkoviak

<Content>The carpet was unreasonably stained. We booked for five guest and towels were left for four. When I requested more I was told to launder the ones I had. It was not made clear to guest where to dispose of the trash, so it was not uncommon to see it in the hallways. The indoor pools had too much chlorine and so little ventalation the fumes burned my eyes. The ones outdoors were always overcrowded.

<Content>This is such a wonderful place to stay. There are activities for the kids, pools (one with a slide), and a lazy river. It is steps from the beach and also Ocean Walk Village. We had a one bedroom oceanfront room which was great. It also has a kitchen with everything we could need for our stay. The room was clean and bright. This is our favorite place to stay when in Daytona Beach.

<Title>“It was a descent place to stay”
<Content>I was afraid to stay here after I made my reservations because I read the reviews, but after we arrived I was pleased. The room was clean and functional. Not the nicest place I have ever stayed but worked well with the kids. I had to call twice for towels and 2 days for toilet paper, even after sending someone from our room to front desk to get some-they wouldn't give it to them there. It is a nice place to stay if you take care of yourself. The staff was friendly with the exception of front desk, especially the security. Our bathroom door would lock us out alot and the dryer is very noisy, but the room worked for us. The pool was enjoyable, but yes you do have to go early to get chairs.

<Title>“Slow elevators, smoking on the pool deck, crowded pool deck, makes this hotel average!”
<Content>I have enjoyed Ocean Deck many times prior to this trip. The main problem is you spend alot of time waiting on elevators and the pool deck does not have enough furniture for all of the guest. If you don't have a space saved by 8:00 am your not going to have a place to lay out. You get bands to wear, but hardly anyone wears them and I think alot of the people in the pool did not even stay at the resort. When we did get a chair by the pool, people were smoking and thumping ashes on the deck. Security did nothing about this, but don't get in the lazy river without a raft, they watch this acitivity with extreme prejudice.

We had 2 units; one had the comps, ours did not. No complimentary coffee in the lobby either. Our door lock stuck in the lock position; had to manipulate the lock each time we tried to close the door. It just need a shot of wd40. Very noisy A/C unit.

<Title>“Great amenities if you're looking for an inexpensive beach weekend away with kids”
<Content>We've been coming back year after year since the resort opened and love it each time. The rooms are typically very clean and nicely furnished for a rental condo, everything seems updated. Oceanfront condos with separate bedrooms are great for a family. Weekends in the summer are the best, there's lots of entertainment for adults and kids on Saturday evening, there's a band playing in the bandshell, the whole family can enjoy the "Dive-in Movie" at the pool and the fireworks display over the pier every Sat. night through the summer. Location is perfect to enjoy a day at the pool or the beach, or both. Beach is beautiful, wide and located in a rare Daytona section that is not driven upon. Both indoor and outdoor pools are large. Shops, good restaurants and large movie theater right next door. Complaints: There are only 4 elevators and they seem to be crowded. There is often a wait on Friday afternoon check-in and Sunday morning check-out. Pool deck chairs get snapped up quickly also.

<Title>“Not worth the money!!”
<Content>We stayed the this condo from June 6th to June 12th 2010 and it wasn't a 'horrible' experience, but it sure wasn't the best either. The location is nice, seeing how it is right on the beach and there are plenty of shops and eateries close by. We also really liked the variety of pools etc... We had some issues with the room that wasn't so pleasant. Ready? We rented our room #1305 from a private owner...(I will NEVER do that again). This is the first time I booked an actual condo, therefore I didn't really know what I was doing. We needed a couple extra trashbags a couple days before we left and the front desk told me that our room was considered no entry (because it was privately owned) therefore I could purchase them at the eatery down in the lobby. We were supposed to have a starter supply of laundry soap and we had none. When my 13 yr. old son went to the front desk to ask for some, the guy told him, "Well, I'm not supposed to give this to you, but here. If the person you are renting from said they would have some in your room, then there should be some in there." So yes, I appreciated him giving us some, even tho it sucked, but his attitude was wrong about the situation. I noticed right away that the hotel and especially once you stepped off the elevators, had a nasty smell. It smelled like pee or dirty socks or something. The elevators were always so slow!! I think the fact that the bedroom windows faced the hallway was a little weird. I was thinking the bedroom windows would of faced the beach. The washing machine sucked! It didn't even wash the clothes. The room itself looks so outdated! With the money they are bringing in at that place, you would think they would update!!!! The carpet and couch was nasty! The ice box was loud, the ice maker quit working mid way through our trip and water started coming out of the bottom of the fridge. I contacted the maint. man that we were told to call with any issues and I couldn't even get his # to go through, so I called the front desk and told them and I had to leave a voicemail for the building maint. man. I never received a call back nor was the stuff fixed before we left. The lock on the sliding balcony door was broke. Since it was considered a 'safety hazard' they sent someone up quickly to fix it and I wish I could remember his name because he was sooooo nice!!! There were dishes left in the dishwasher....I couldn't tell you if they were clean or dirty. The room stank. There was what looked as blood smeared on the bathroom floor next to the wall between the 2 bathroom doors and there was also some on the front of one of the dresser drawers. The toilet wouldn't flush right. There was hair all over the bathroom floor, around the toilet and tub etc...The shower curtain...OMG! It was molded on both sides from top to bottom!!!! There wasn't even a liner on the shower. It was a cloth shower curtain! I also assumed (could be my fault) that we would of had at least one dish rag and one dish towel, and there was nothing. I would of brought my own, but was under the impression that if there were towels, there would of been dish towels too. The condo just wasn't clean. I have emailed the lady we rented it from 2 days ago and haven't heard anything as of yet. I stated all these issues with her and told her that I would want to know if the cleaning co. I was paying wasn't cleaning properly. I won't be back to this place.

<Title>“I wouldn't go back to the Wyndham, to crowded and not enough help!!”
<Content>The employees where in a hurry, get them in and get them out feeling! Our room wasn't ready, misinformed about the room. Wyndham ocean walk isn't all it's cracked up to be. Wyndham swiched our room to a Handicap room, which wasn't required, they swiched our room again, after we just unpacked everything. The room we stayed in was OK. I don't know why anyone would own it??? Not worth it. The stove didn't work right and the dishwasher was broke. The room next to our had a TERRIBLE foul smell that seeped into our room. I did see housekeeping, they tried to fan out the smell, IT DIDN"T WORK. I also asked for extra pillows and told the hotel was out of them... Also, not chairs on the balcony, again told they were out of them. (I did see a bunch of chairs all over, but Wyndham couldn't be bothered). My husband and I went on the tour, and that was a joke. Once they knew we were not happy they just wanted to get rid of us, and move onto the next, again Get them in and Get them out. So, We definitly wouldn't go back to the Wyndham Ocean Walk. I tried to speak with a few different employees, and not one helped out, they passed the buck to someone else. NOt good Wyndham, thanks for a terrible stay!!!! Glad we could vent online!!!!!

<Title>“Do your own laundry and don't ask for towels!”
<Content>This was our first time staying at this property and had no idea there would be no cleaning service during our stay. So, when we called to ask if we would get clean towels, we were told to wash our own. When I asked about getting extra laundry detergent, I was told if we had been members of the Wyndham "family" (whatever the heck that means) that we would get complimentary laundry soap. For the amount I paid, I simply expected better service than what I was provided. In addition, the elevators are packed, and having a son in a wheelchair, it was very hard to catch an elevator without having to wait in LONG lines. Finally, the lobby smells of a foul odor that reminds me of lingering vomit. Not appealing at all!

<Title>“Not what I Expected”
<Content>There are good and bad about this resort but the bad win. First of all the bad. Don't think about getting a pool chair after 8-9 in the morning because it will never happen. The resort is to big for the amount of outdoor pools and avaliable chairs. The units do not have Internet inside which forces you to go to the lobby to connect to the internet. Also if you have more than one car it will need to be parked across the street for 16 dollars a day. Watch out for the beds you will need to schedule a back massage when you get home. Off the lobby their is a small store which sells snacks and it closes at 9pm after which if you want a candy bar good luck. For the good. Next door to the resort is 5-6 places to eat and a movie theater. On Friday and Saturday nights they have music next to the resort for no fee. Their is a very small water park and putt putt golf across the street and when I say small maybe 1 1/2 acres total. The Hilton next door has a GREAT steak house called PRIME. To sum up my experience. I have not been to Daytona Beach in 10 years. It is ran down bad. Hotels have broken windows and are closed on the beach. Stores are closed and not much to do other than what is in a 2 block area from this hotel. The boardwalk is closed for remodeling till end of the year and the rides by the boardwalk are the old carnival rides that are pulled by trucks to local carnivals. I kind of felt like I was at a cheap fair ground. The strange part is that I was their the week after school got out and their was no 18-24 year olds around. Looks to me they ran off all of their party crowd and their money source went away and the town is dieing. If I were to go back I would stay next door at the HILTON.

<Title>“Don't Go - Save your money!”
<Content>Where should I start? I went with my husband and 20 year old daughter. This place is way over priced and way, way over rated! The first room was, (after we managed to get security to let us in because the electronic lock was broken) not the size room I reserved and paid for in advance and it was torn apart. The carpet was disgusting. The walls trashed and the vases or whatnots on the shelf next to the TV were broken and had sharp pointy edges. Luckily for our family we do not have small children. The couch, chair and stove where torn apart as if someone was in the middle of searching for something or perhaps got interrupted during cleaning. The trash was on the on top of the bar where guest are supposed to eat. I called to complain about the size and condition of the room and was told "Rooms are not guaranteed." What? They sure as heck took my money in advance to guarantee that I would show up! The least they could have done was to give me what I paid for! I was told "there is nothing we can do the resort is booked." No apologies on the wrong room no nothing - just tough. The front desk did agree to send someone up to clean the room, but when the maid got there all she did was drop off a couple of bars of hand soap and leave without cleaning a stinking thing. So resigned to getting ripped off and stuck in a substandard filthy room, my husband and I go to the bedroom to unpack for our two day stay and found that the linen was visibly filthy. I called down and ask for clean linen. Of course they didn't bring it so I had my daughter call back down and ask again. This time a male staff member was extremely RUDE to my daughter and asked her why I wanted clean linen. You would think that an explanation for clean linen would not be needed. The TV remote didn't work which wasn't a big deal until I tried to turn it on manually and found that the on/off button had been removed or yanked out. There was a whole where normally a button would be and I wasn't about to stick my finger in it so I called to ask for batteries. I think this fourth, fifth or sixth call to the front desk finally made them take note and miraculously a room (the type I paid for) became available. So now we are in room two after wasting hours of our vacation time. We get in this second room which at first glance seems to be cleaner and in better working order. We go about our day trying to enjoy the pool which by now is filled to capacity with nowhere to sit. We won’t discuss the issue with the pool towels and the policy on getting a clean one. Suffice to say, bring your own detergent. We go get lounge chairs and take them down to the beach where finally we can start to relax on our vacation. That night, my daughter goes to make her bed on the pull out couch only to find that she has no pillows. We only had three undersized flat pillows on our bed so we call down and ask for three more pillows. Two were to be used by my daughter and another one for me since a recent surgery requires I maintain a certain posture. This usually isn't a problem with most resorts. At any rate, I wait up fully dressed, listening to what seems like the loudest air conditioner on the planet and smelling something rotten emanating from the AC closet, so that I can answer the door when the pillows arrive. That of course never happened. I woke up fully dressed still waiting on pillows the next morning. We called down to the front desk another two or three times that day asking for pillows, only to be told that the maid or runner said she left them in the room (we were in the room – no one came). My daughter assured the front desk that we did not receive pillows, but was treated very rudely and suspiciously by staff again. Finally after hours of waiting and fussing with staff my husband and I went down to the beach. I won’t even go into the third degree the man at the wristband counter gave me when I tried to get wristbands for the pool area for day two. Apparently you have to put the hospital like disposable wristbands on loosely enough to take them off when you are not at the pool are (which for my husband is impossible) or wear the hideous red thing for however long your stay is, because they are only going to give you one. At any rate, my daughter calls me shortly after we leave the room to tell me, much to my horror and utter disbelief, that staff sent a runner to search our room. That was it! That was all the abuse I was going to take from these over puffed, over inflated, pompous you know what's, so I went to talk to management face to face. I calmly, because you get more flies with honey, asked for the manager in charge and was greeted by a very friendly young lady who assured me that they would be dealing with the runner who had the audacity to search a guest’s room. I explained part of the ordeal that we had been put through over the past couple of days and she seemed sympathetic. She told me to expect a phone call from a Robert somebody within the next couple of days. That never happened. I asked for corporation’s phone number on day one from a staff member at the front desk, but found that when I tried to call it, it was a bogus number! We checked out before 10:00 a.m. on our scheduled departure day. We could not wait to say good riddance to the so highly rated pathetic excuse of a resort. We all vowed to let anyone who asked us about the place know exactly what happened and what we thought. We vowed to NEVER AGAIN visit Wyndham's Ocean Walk Daytona. You would think the mistreatment would stop there, but nooo. Low and behold, when I got my credit card statement you will never guess what they did. You would expect that after knowing what their staff did to our family or how crappy and out of shape the rooms were that they put us in, they would give us a small discount, but noooo. They charged us for an extra room and I have been given nothing but the run around for going on two weeks trying to get it off my credit card! I’ve called the direct line of the gentleman that I booked the vacation with but he said he can’t do anything about it because it was a charge that the hotel or resort or whatever they claim to be, put on my card. I talked to several people at the resort before getting a hold of a manager or assistant manager who requested a copy of my credit card statement (of which I emailed her over a week ago). She stated that she would call me back the next day. But you know that never happened either! I’ve left her voicemail after voicemail, but all I hear are crickets. I have been reduced to disputing the charge on my credit card. My next stop, other than letting everyone under the sun know how miserable a state the resort is in and how absolutely despicable the staff members are, is to make a complaint with their local better business bureau, and the Central Florida Visitors bureau. Innocent law abiding citizens such as myself (who also happens to be a War Veteran) and my family members should not be subjected to having their only vacations ruined by such conglomerates.

<Title>“Seen it's better days--but still is a great place”
<Content>We go to Ocean Walk a couple of times a year. We went early April and early May. Our biggest concern was that the lazy river appeared green w/ algea both times. When you looked down from the balcony it was very noticable between the 2 blue pools. I emailed resort and got response back that it is painted green...whoever had the job of picking colors should be fired...who picks green for a pool? I really don't think it was paint. The resort was much better a few years back but I believe it is getting renovated which should help with the dated look. They need to bring the pool DJ back and keep the outside bar open later. Like the Blockbuster video rental machine though! Also the staff was very rude both visits. Also beware of renting a 1 bedroom suite---some have NO views only hallway view. Stick with a deluxe if your doing 1 bedroom. All 2 and 3 B/r have views. Also don't rent from actual resort...way too expensive. Ebay, Craigslist, VRBO etc. have much better deals from owners.

<Title>“Good location for lots of activities”
<Content>This was the 2nd Wydham Resort we stayed in while in FL. After the Wyndham Bonnet Creek in Orlando, nothing was going to be as good as Bonnet Creek. This Wyndham is located right on the ocean. Right next door to a bunch of shops, movie theater, amusement type rides. Was concerned we'd hear a lot of the noise from the Boardwalk area. Only one night, when an out doorband played (badly) until 11pm did things get a little noisy. Help was relatively friendly. The lobby while looked clean always smelled like a moldy mop. Pool area was clean but pool had a lot of sand on the bottom- but that would be in the nature of an ocean side pool. Poolside bar/cafe Turtles Nest was manned by super nice staff. Parking was an issue. We had 2 vehicles, motel only allowed one on sight. Had to pay ridiculous amount to park 2nd car in nearby lot- even though Wynhdam lot was never full.

<Content>Our first time to FL and would stay here again! Our room had everything we needed for our stay. It was clean and spacious enough for us to enjoy ourselves. Beds slept fine; good support. Hallways were quiet!!!!! That is a BIG plus! Security personnel was friendly ,yet ready to do what they had to do to maintain security. We felt very safe in the resort.

<Title>“Great time! Needs new mattresses. Outdoor bar open later.”
<Content>We went with 6 adults and 2 children. We had a wonderful time. Their are tons of things for the kids to do right there at the resort. You could bring all your groceries for the week and never have to leave or spend anymore money. The two suggestions would be to buy new mattresses(this is a must) and keep the outdoor bar open late. They close the bar when it slows down even if thats 5 p.m. We had grandma and grandpa to watch the kids so it would have been really nice to go outside and enjoy a drink i the beautiful weather. You can only park one car if you have 2 the second car goes across the street at $16.00 a day. No internet in rooms. Overall it was great and i would stay there again.

<Content>went for my four year olds birthday and we had a fabulous time. Loved the lazy river and it had a great kiddie pool section, just get there early so you can get a spot. The rooms were wonderful and it was extra nice to have a washer and dryer. Everyone on staff was polite and anything you needed they got for you. cant wait to go back again.

<Title>“Good, but some bad parts”
<Content>I was there for my high school graduation and I had eaten something that caused me to get sick all day on my graduation, and i thought it was stupid that the hotel charges to clean up that because I spent all day getting sick then cleaning it up on my own, oh and i was told i didnt get extra towels which was dumb too. And on checkout morning I made the mistake of leaving a few things in the drawyer, which I accept is my responsibility. However, it was never turned into lost and found. I know my clothes did not get up and walk away, so someone did not do their job because I definitely do not have them, neither does my family. I stay here three or four times out of the year because I love everything it has to offer, but I am thinking about switching hotels because I was pretty upset at how my stay here went. I would recommend this hotel to a friend but I would definitely warn them that if they get sick hotel staff won't send help for you and if you leave anything behind, chances are it wont be returned.

<Title>“Great Amenities/Lousy Rooms”
<Content>This is part timeshare and what they are renting are the old outdated units. The dishwasher did not work at all and the unit really was in need of some general repair (walls were scraped up, paint flaking on walls, etc) and updates (looked like decor from 80's). The amenities and location were great though. My 4 year old loved the pools and it was right on the beach and right by everything. We only paid $120 night so I felt it was okay for the money but if I would have paid anymore I would really be disappointed.

<Title>“Dissappointed by this visit!!”
<Content>The unit we stayed in was in very bad repair. The phone never worked, the room was dirty, we were never offered fresh towels or maid service, the toilet leaked, stuffing was coming out of the sofa, and we were just thoroughly dissappointed. We had stayed here 3.5 years ago with our daughters and their families through our RCI account and had wonderful experience. That is why we came back this year, but without the same experience. We were in 1702, and were told by a maintenance person on sight that the owner chose not to do the upgrades that other owners had done. We will probably not choose to return.

<Title>“AMAZING resort and GREAT staff! Would definately stay again!!!!!!!!!!!”
<Content>We are Wyndham Owners and spent a week at Ocean Walk in a 2 bedroom condo in the North Tower on the 19th floor in room 1927. We were able to check in early due to VIP status and were very impressed with how beautful our condo was and we had GORGEOUS ocean views from our room!!!!! There was granite countertops in the kitchen, fresh pain, new carpet, and everything was nicely decorated. The condo was VERY roomy!!!! Both bathrooms had double vanities and the beds were pretty comofortable. We received amazing service from the staff and everyone was so friendly we met-even other guests. Security patrolled the pool area since staying on a public beach, but they never made you feel uncomfortable they actually made you feel safe and were all very friendly to talk to. The beach location can't be beat! Gorgeous is all i can say about location! Really nice pools-only negative of the entire resort was lazy river needs to be cleaned really good or shocked with pool chemicals. The water slide was great and the bar out there was really handy for just sodas if you didn't want adult beverages. We never heard any noise above or beside our condo during the entire stay. Was very impressed by this resort and how close you are to shopping and eating places. Would definatly recommend and stay at again!

<Title>“I will suggest Wyndham Ocean Walk to "anyone" staying in Daytona,Bch.”
<Content>I came in on a Sunday morning.The staff hooked me up with my pool pass,pool towels and parking pass hours before check in.This gave me the ability to join all their guests for some fun in the sun.Before I knew it I was swimming in the pool,floating in the lazy river,and had an awesome colorful drink in my hand from the turtle nest poolside bar.Mind you, I had not even received my room key and I was all ready "stoked" about my decision to stay at the Wyndham.My room was ready exactly when I was told it would be.I was amazed at how fully functual the rooms are,I guess I overlooked the fact that the rooms were more condo like.I found you don't stay there , You "live there during your stay.The fact that everything is within walking distance was another plus.Diners,BBQ,Big named bars and resturaunts,shops,carnival oceanside,water park,etc.(even some kick butt sushi)all a stone throw away.I did not have my 8 yr. old daughter with me this trip,but the whole stay I wish I had.I saw kids of all ages having a blast!! I believe it rubs off on the adults,because I saw plenty of grown ups having a blast also.The beach rental services made it easy to get all kinds of beach needs,use them, and just simply hand them back in,versus buying them ,hauling them,cleaning,storing,etc.I guess what I'm trying to say is my stay was awesome and I think It's a win win resort for the whole family.OH YEAH,ladies,they have spa services.(like I said,"win win" )

<Title>“Great facilities hotel rooms need a major make over”
<Content>This was our second year to this establishment. The fact that there are several pools, and activities are a plus. The rooms need major work. The beds are horrible. The toliet didn't flush unless you held the handle. The refrigerator ran very loud, as well as the washer. The TV's are very old and don't even have RCA adaptors for video games or a dvd player. No dvd player even though there is a Blockbuster box on site. There was a VCR, but who uses vhs anymore. The decor is also very old. The tiles are falling apart. The size and the fact that there is a kitchen is a plus. There are no seats available at the pool because they are all taken by 8:00 a.m. There is live/loud entertainment poolside until at least midnight. You can only park one car in the garage and it costs at least $12 a day to park across the street. When you pay as much as you do to stay you should be able to park in the several empty spaces and save money.

<Title>“It was so-so....”
<Content>There is good and bad about this hotel. The rooms are privately owned so a lot of problems within the room cannot be fixed by calling the front desk. We had an oceanfront 1 bedroom on the 12th floor (room 1208). The room was nice, and fairly clean but yes, the window in the bedroom did go out into the hallway, which is odd, I thought the window would be to the ocean as it shows in the 1 bedroom oceanfront pictures. The room had 2 TV's but the TV in the living room has no on/off switch, there was a big hole where the button use to be and both of the remotes for both tv's were broken! The backs of the remotes were missing and no batteries. We paid good money for this room and expected to be able to watch TV!! There was also no fitted sheet, blankets or pillows for the pull out couch. There was a cover sheet with stains that we would not use. Security is CRAZY, especially if you have teenagers with you. There are about 10 of them around the pools, watching everything at all times. The good thing is the location is really nice and the ocean front sceanary is awesome. But you can get that with the other hotels in the area as well.

<Title>“Never Again”
<Content>Very disappointed with this hotel. First, not enough chairs and no sun after 3:00, because hotel is so tall. Second, several robberies at pool side and apparently this has been going on for sometime and hotel is not telling guests. Luckly we were not hit but witnessed at least 3 in 1 week...could have been more. Not worth it. Do not keep anything of value unattended.

<Title>“Great location...but not the best hotel for the money.”
<Content>The location of this hotel is great - close to shopping, food, entertainment, etc. It's right on the beach, so it's a wonderful vacation spot. The condo-like rooms with full kitchen are a nice amenity, but the rooms definitely need updating (walls, floors, bathrooms, kitchen, etc.) - a full remodel would be necessary for the price paid for the room. The swimming pools were great, but very over-crowded. The only way you could get lounge chairs or umbrellas on the beach was to rent them for $25 a day EACH. The hotel should provide those to guests for the price you pay to stay there (almost $400 a night for a 2 bedroom, 2 bath "condo"). Again, the location is ideal, so that is the biggest benefit of this hotel. The service was good, but not great.

<Title>“OceanWalk is still "okay", but the upkeep and maintenance is declining.”
<Content>We have always enjoyed the OceanWalk and have come here for many years. This was the first time we were disappointed. We noticed that the maintenance is declining. A chair in our room had the back off of it, and when we called maintenance they told us that the owner would have to fix it. The carpet was ripped and torn. The dresse was scratched and needing repainting. The condo was also not clean. We found doughnut sprinkles on the counter, a plastic Easter egg on the floor, and someone's medication (a pill) on the floor. Many dishes were missing. The lazy river was green the entire time we were there, and the pool had lots of sand in the bottom. It wasn't cleaned everyday like it used to be. The sidewalk used to be sprayed off every morning, but it wasn't cleaned the whole time we were at OceanWalk. We noticed lots of places that needed to be painted, especially around the lazy river area. The TV isn't HD and there is not wireless internet in the room - only in the basement by the recreation center. I love this place and hope this improves! I don't know if we'll go back or not . . .

<Title>“Well the resort is beautiful! But it has alot of Hang-Ups!”
<Content>I read some reviews, Decided to stay there anyway, Reviews were 50/50...So The resort is located at a decent spot, beautiful pools!<-- ( You may only enjoy if you are willing to be at the pool by 8:15am and you must stay put or lose your chairs-They will bag up your stuff and take it to a holding room--lol! They really need about 50 more chairs---so many ppl coming down at 8:25am and not getting a chair!) The Tiki bar was bad bad bad! dont waste your 8bucks for a tasteless frozen drink....the Tiki bar at the Regency next door has better drinks, prices and entertainment plus the are open late-- The ocean walk does have kids activities..but the honestly seemed corny/lame! Low Budget! Breakfast buffet was not a good bargain! food just ok for 13 each! You can go to IHop for less...yummy! close! As long as you go before 8:15 or be stuck in the sand for the day! THe food cart on the beach was not bad at all! The cook the food on the spot! we ate off it almost everyday! (pool bar menu is pricey! and the food quality was just ok! Our room seemed to be pretty clean...although the refrigerator leaked water periodically? They dont give you a broom to sweep the mostly tiled room/ the vacuum picked up nothin and smelt like it was burning! This was kinda gross..NO Maid service! You can request it but plan on losing your seat at the pool! Our door was hard to get latched you had to slam it several times and even then it would open! the sliding door had a completely broken lock! Which i would like to believe its a No crime area! but I would of been alot more comfy with the ability to secure the doors at night! And when we left! The elevators were maxed out soometimes 10-15min wait The Ocean walk shoppes are nice, and at your door step (there is only a few that are actually open) Alot of kiosk vendors Dont waste your loot on the ride simulator! The nearby waterpark was alot of fun! April 2010

<Title>“Terrible start turned in to great vacation”
<Content>The vacation started off to a smelly room and a bad mattress. Both of those incidents got resolved after we had to get the Manager involved in it. The Manager also had promised us some coupons for our troubles but we never received them. The internet in the lobby is no good. The fitness center was to crowded. Overall the Resort is in a good location with some nice amenities. The vacation turned out to be very nice and relaxing on the pool with bar . I would recommend the Resort but if you have problems with it you should get the Manager involved in it right away other then that you will be wasting your time waiting for somebody from the front desk to fix it for you.

<Title>“1st and LAST stay at Ocean Walk”
<Content>Horrible experience!! Check in at 4PM and waiting in line with 100 other people only to be told that your room is not ready ...we waiting in the lobby until 7PM...this must be a NORMAL daily experience, because we saw people waiting after 4PM everday!!! The staff were so FAKE, with their "I'm sorry, and smirky smile" that it became a joke to my husband and I after the 5th time in line waiting for the room!! There were SOO many angry people in line, I'm suprised this Wyndham had any employees! AND to make matters worse there are only 4 elevators for the ENTIRE building we stayed in. The elevators took FOREVER to reach the floor we were on and then when the doors opened, it was packed! You actually had to push the "up" button, get on, go up to the top floor only to go "down" to the lobby! EVERY SINGLE TIME!!! The telephone and TV did not work in the room. Only 3 bath towels for 4 guest. 3 of the 4 bathroom light bulbs were out. The only positiive thing I can say is that our room had 2 balconies.

<Content>Right on the beach. Clean. No internett acess in the room, is the only thing to complain about. Nice pool. Everything was perfect. A few restaurants in walking distance. We liked it so much we did not want to go home.The weather was nice and warm. We got a fantastic wiev from the 15th floor, both over the city and the ocean. Take the elevator up to 25th floor, that was a fantastic wiev.

<Title>“nice place, some minor problems, but overall very enjoyable”
<Content>went with family, grandpa and grandma, me, the wife, 5 year old boy and 7 month old girl... enjoyed our stay there... great three bedroom condo with a great view, clean, had an issue with the coffeemaker, called front desk and a new one was delivered within an hour, same with request for more laundry or dishwasher detergent.... agree with the funny mad scramble for chairs in the morning, but the security was very accomodating, if someone hadn't shown up at the chairs in half an hour, the secuity would bag the stuff and make the chairs available... please, if you think you can get down to the pool at 8am and put one towel across two chairs and then not come back until 11am you have another thing coming.... $2 drafts at the outdoor bar is a deal, good food too... the lazy river did need some cleaning but was too cold for us anyway, the pools from the balcony appears a bit dirty but when you are in the pool it was obvioulsy from the amount of sand on the bottom, they needed a good vaccuming... my main complaints, 1. parking, they only allow 1 car per unit, well, with a three bedroom unit you would think that many people would have two cars, sucked paying $16 a day to park across the street, 2. long lines in the elevators, true, it was spring break so it was crowded, but then the stairs were always open and available and not crowded, guess some people are a bit lazy... 3. the WORST part is the overall design/height of the buildings, during the time we were there all of the pool area was 100% shaded by like 3 in the afternoon, making it feel like 6 at night, the beach always had sun but we like to sit at the pool later, not much they can do about that.....

<Title>“Did NOT want to leave!”
<Content>We just returned from a one week's stay at Wyndham's Ocean Walk resort at Daytona beach.Upon arrival we were allowed to check in two hours early (based upon availability). The resort needs to buy more luggage carts. I waited twenty minutes for one to use.There are porters if you wish to let them do it for you on a tips basis.Tips are discretionary. The room itself was very comfortable.We were in the South tower on the 13th floor,directly on the ocean.Our balcony view was fabulous! The king bed was comfy and Wyndham offerred all the comforts of home.In fact,after the 4th day,it began too feel like home.There was a jacuzzi tub,washer and dryer,safe,ironing board,iron,full kitchen with dishwasher,all utensils,cookware and table settings etc...Wyndham thoughtfully supplied laundry soap,diswasher soap and much more throughout the unit.The units are also solid,quiet and very private.No noise once the doors are closed. The staff were all pleasant and efficient.We had two minor problems (thermostat and kitchen sink sprayer handle) with the unit while we were there and both were taken care of promptly.The location is perfect for partying or just doing nothing.Wyndham has "'won us over" to Ocean Walk.We know the Daytona Beach area very well and have been going there for years.It's not as swank and ritzy as the Hilton which is right next door,but it certainly is much more family friendly.You'll save big $$$ by just making a trip to the local Publix supermarket and cooking for yourself while you are there.Ocean Walk is NOT for those who want to pay out wads to be pampered.If that's what you want,go to the Plaza,Hilton or The Shores resort and spa.Ocean Walk was never designed to be a five star,full service resort.It is what it is.At best it is four stars because it lacks room service and a sit down restaurant.Ocean Walk has the best pool deck/tiki bar on the beach.Security is excellent.Parking is free in the secure garage.Electronic key card entrance to all ways in.Kid zone,PC zone for kids.Private billiards room with PC access for adults only! Gym,lap pool,lazy river,water slide,three hot tubs, indoor pools,dvd rentals,in-hotel store (prices are atrocious!).Sit down breakfast from the grill, bar with tvs in the lobby...and so much more.Wireless PC access in all lobbies.No wireless plan for the rooms yet! But it is coming soon.That and the fact that they do not hand out freshly laundered towels on a daily basis to pool goers were the only real negatives that we spotted.The answers were obvious for us:we were on vacation at one of the best resorts at "The world's most famous beach"! Why in the world did we need to have PC access in our rooms? The weather was perfect (There is premium cable TV available in all rooms as well as dvd players and a blockbuster rental kiosk on the LL level). The thing with the towels was equally obvious.It cost us nothing but a few minutes' time to launder them in our rooms every other day.Bring your own towels if you do not want to pay $15 if the resort towels that are allocated to you are lost. If things like this bother you,then you probably don't need to go to Ocean Walk.It's all about fun there! There is also a large multilevel shopping area with cinemas and restaurants attached to the Ocean Walk complex.Daytona lagoon offers BOGO tix on karting and much more. We certainly did not want to leave after a week of relaxation,natural beauty and exercise...We'll be back!

<Title>“Towed my car.”
<Content>Rude and completely unaccomodating. We stayed with friends for a cheerleading competition at the Hilton next door. They checked in but were not advised that only one car per room was allowed in the lot. Imagine my surprise when I came down to the garage and discovered my car wan no longer parked where I left it. When I discussed this with the manager at the front desk I was completely dismissed by her tough [--] attitidude and that we should have read the fine print reply. $191.36 cash exact change at the impound. They would not even discuss the possibility of workig with me on the bill. Instead they handed me a map and phone number for the towing company. Stay FAR AWAY from this place. Tons of better options in the area. Ruined an otherwise great vacation. Congratulations on your lousy service. Looks like others would concur.

<Title>“Ocean Walk expectations”
<Content>I was amazed at the activities that they have here. The little market store was convenient. The staff was nice. The room that we were in was ok. Silverware, pans and dishes were missing. The blow dryer didn't work. The overhead light in the kitchen area needed replaced. The noise was loud with the room being a center room. I didn't like the fact that we had to wait so long for an elevator. The view once you were outside was great. The swimming pools were beautiful, but shaded due to the large hotels . It was expensive, so we expected more from the room and its condition. I was very disappointed in the room.

<Title>“Not what I expected”
<Content>Property was nice. Location is great. We had to switch rooms as our original one assigned had a moldy shower and the whole unit wasn't very clean. The next unit was a little better but not great. I have stayed at Wyndham properties with timeshare owners and the units have been great. I was told by the front desk staff that when you make a reservation as a paying customer and not an "owner", you are not guaranteed a room type, i.e. one king or two doubles. Also, the rooms they offer paying customers are actually owned by private owners and "rented" out to paying customers like we were. My kids had a great time and the Ocean Walk restaurants were good. Melanie and Joe, the bartenders at the Landing Bar were awesome! Sadly though, due to the lack of room quality, I wouldn't stay here again.

<Title>“It was Terrible”
<Content>I paid around 160.00 per night and stayed 2 nights with my 2 young kids and husband. When I first checked in I got the wrong room, and they said they had no more of the room that I had reservered. I used the pull out bed for my kids and the mattress was gross. They only had sheets in the room. I went all the way down the elevator with my 2 kids to ask for some blankets and pillows and they told me no. We had no one come to take our trash of give us clean towels. I will never go back....

<Title>“Nice Family Spring Break”
<Content>We stayed at Ocean Walk March 26-31. Last year we stayed at a different resort but had friends that were staying at Ocean Walk and visited them so we knew what to expect. Actually there was a pleasant surprise. We were hesitant to stay there because last year the pools were FREEZING (had nothing to do with the weather because the pool at our resort was great) and it took our 6yo a while to get in. During our stay the pools were fine, could have been a little warmer but swimmable. The resort is great because you can walk to things if you want (great location) and you really don't have to leave unless you want. pools were clean enough although the toddler pool could have been a little cleaner. Check in/ check out was no problem, although we were doing it at days/times that weren't real busy. I did see a lot of people in line at busy times. The "market" was great for breakfast and the drinks at the pool bar, while pricey, are very good. The only real negative I have about this resort would be service, but not with the people. I think a resort should make it as easy as possible for people to "do things". Example: we need a dolly to take the groceries up to the 19th floor. I have to go all the was to the "sun center" (or whatever it is called), leave my ID, go out to the car, get my stuff, go to the room, go all the back to the place to return the dolly. Its not a big deal but put them in a central location so people don't have to "work" to do things. All in all a good place.

<Content>There were twelve of us on spring break. Kids ranged in age from 1-12. There truely was something for everyone Hot Tubs for adults, water slides and mini golf for the tweens and a nice baby pool for the ittiy bitties. A snack truck parked outside on the beach so you could get a pop or hot dog and not have to go to the pool cafe. The front desk was very friendly. and lots of restaraunts within walking distance. I would recomend this Wyndam.

<Content>We recently stayed at Wyndham Ocean Walk.We had a great time. We have stayed there quite a few times and have never had a complaint, The only complaints we had this time was that the pool bar closed before 5:00 just when everyone was coming up from the beach & wanted to enjoy a drink around the pool. and the lazy river pool was green & needed to be cleaned. No one was using it because it looked gross

<Title>“Location!”
<Content>The location of this resort is perfect. Set on the beautiful beach front. There is a lot to do within walking distance. Shops, places to eat, movies, ect. We found the employees to be friendly and helpful. We had a 1 bedroom unit facing the street. The view did not bother us but the hallway right outside your bedroom window did. You could hear every step and voice. It made it tough for the little ones to go to sleep. You could also hear anything said in the adjoining unit as only a door with a 1 inch gap at the bottom to divide. I would request a beach front room and/or the whole 2 bedroom unit the next time. The minikitchen/living/dining was one of the smallest we have experienced. The bedroom was a good size. Very, very nice pool area with slide and lazy river. Over all we enjoyed our stay and I would recommend resort.

<Title>“THE Place to Stay if you want to be in on the Spring Break Action!”
<Content>My wife and I just returned from a three night stay at Wyndam's Ocean Walk. It was fantastic, this is one of the largest hotels ON THE BEACH, and on the boardwalk. The famous Daytona Beach Pier is only a block or two south of the hotel. Several places to dine like Sloppy Joe's, ( a very good place to eat), Johnny Rockets, etc. can be found at the Ocean Walk attached to the South end of the hotel and the Hilton next door. The hotel is clean, well equipped with exercise equipment, heated pools, and lazy river, etc. The staff is friendly and very helpful! There is also a large band shell for live entertainment located here also. Two large parking decks are on the property, and another can be reached by skywalk across Atlantic Blvd.

<Title>“This is a great resort!”
<Content>I have just returned from a weeks stay at this resort for Bike Week 2010. We arrived on Saturday, Feb 27th and departed on Saturday, March 6th. I had read several negative reviews on this site regarding the hotel and was very hesitant to stay at this location but decided to do so because of the proximity to Main Street and the beach. I can't say enouhg nice things about this property. I rented a condo from an owner and was extremely pleased with the property. The staff was friendly and courteous and the rooms were spotless. We were given an adequate supply of laundry detergent and dish washer detergent. The linens were clean and fresh. The bedding appeared to be top of the line and was very comfortable. Even with the large number of people in the hotel we had no trouble with the elevators. The rooms were safe and no deficiencies were noted with the security. The patio door lock worked well and the room safe was in great repair. I am already making plans to go back to this property for Biketoberfest in October. I would recommend this property with no hesitation!

<Title>“Very Nice”
<Content>The Wyndham Ocean Walk was a very nice place to stay in Daytona Beach, FL. The staff was polite and our room was beautiful and clean. This room looked like it was just updated. It had 2 new TV's, new kitchen, new whirlpool tub, glass door shower, balcony, stove and microwave. The colors were yellow and blue and the furniture was great. The location was nice. Stop at level 4 on the south tower and you can get off to enter a new walk area to Starbucks, a Movie Theater, Restaurants and various stores. The beach was located near a pier and was clean. Also a little sandwich truck was on the beach and this made it easy to get a drink or hamburger.There were 2 outdoor pools, a lazy river, 2 or 3 hot tubs, 2 indoor pools. We also went to the computer room, game room, hotel's restaurant and the gym. The had alot things to do if you wanted-like crafts, yoga, trips etc. We loved all the amenities and the location the best. The last two days of our stay was the start of Bike Week and we did hear the "zoom,zoom" noise, but it wasn't too bad. Kids would love this place because they have a great pool slide.

<Title>“Great vacation at the Ocean Walk”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Ocean Walk the first week of Feb. The resort had no vacancy at this time according to the desk but did not seem crowded at anytime (may have been the weather). We had no trouble checking in, the biggest problem I had was deciding which floor I would like my room on. The entire process took approx. 5 minutes before my room keys were in hand. We had an oceanview room in the North tower (3 bedroom,very spacious 5th floor), it was a room that has not been updated yet but was very nice and clean. We did ask mid way through our stay see a two bedroom in the South tower to see what the resorts updated rooms looked like - very nice new color scheme and flat screen lcd Tv's. There is no longer a Spa in the resort, they advertise for one two blocks up the street and WiFi is currently still only available in the lobby but this is supposed to change in the next few months. The Ocean Walk shops next door offer several restaurants/bars, a few shops and a Movie 10 theatre. You could walk over through the 4th floor of the South Tower and then over to the Hilton through the Ocean Walk Shops without going into the rain. The Hilton has some lunch and dinner speacials at their restaurants worth checkingout. The lazy river was not heated while we were there so we did not use it. The pools were a nice temp. for the time of year as were the hot tubs. Did not use either of the two indoor pools or the children's pool with playground but checked and the children's area was heated. Security around the hotel was always present, although I found it odd to have the person at the front chasing you down for your parking ticket as you had to use a room key for entrance to the garage. I could see having them there to keep people from parking and blocking off the entrance to the garage which seemd to be occuring at check in as ther is no space for temp parking. There are lots of activities for both children and adults if they wished to particpate, including yoga classes, indoor mini putt, socials -wine and cheese, ice cream and different games. Yopu could signed out board games to take to your room at the activities desk and sign up for computer time. There is also a business center for adults separate from the time limit computers. The units were well socked with appliances, utensils, starter dish and laundry soap. The pillows were comfortable but could be larger (twin pillows on a king bed). The bed was okay for comfort, I have slept in better and I have slept in worse. Overall,we enjoyed our stay, the Ocean Walk is a very nice resort. It was clean, and I found the majority of the staff friendly and helpful, they accomadated our requests as best they could and went out of their way on occasion - we were unable to see the one bedroom rooms at the resort due to no vacancy but they did give us a key to see the two bedroom that was being updated. I can not comment on price as we are Wyndham points owners and used our points. I would return to this hotel with our children in the future. Side note: I would not reccomend doing the tour or the 45 minute update for owners here. It was like being held hostage for the better part of a day. It was a rainy day the day we did it or I would have walked out long before the time we had into it.

<Title>“In Need Of Repair”
<Content>We arrived at this hotel in unit 1105 and were extremely disappointed in the quality of the room. It looked like it was WELL used. There were huge stains on the carpet and bar stools. The bathroom cupboard was barely hanging and the wall had only an empty metal bracket instead of a towel holder. The wall paper border in the bedroom was falling off in several places. The sliding glass door handle was broken off! The furniture looked as though it was just picked up from the Goodwill. The 2 beds in the bedroom were so small, just barely bigger than a twin size. I had booked this trip a year in advance as a surprise Daytona 500 trip for my husband. I was deeply disappointed for the amount of money I paid for the package to be put up in such a dingy hotel. The one thing I will say is the view from the balcony was beautiful and the pools looked nice except that it was freezing cold so we were unable to use them. There is no restaurant, there is a store that you can order some breakfast items from that tasted ok. When we asked about changing rooms the hotel staff told us they didn't have anything else and were unapologetic in any manner. Housekeeping came 1 of the 3 days we were there and emptied garbage cans and left towels, that's about it. There was hair all over the floor, etc.

<Title>“I wish I could have been there longer!”
<Content>We moved to the Wyndham in Daytona after spending a week in Orlando. It was very laid back, and relaxing... even with all the people. I wish we would have spent more time. We stayed on the Trendwest floor. I don't remember which one it was, but we borrowed someone's timeshare. They booked us a deluxe 2 bedroom, as with Trendwest all these face the ocean. Considering, we had an INCREDIBLE view. The master bedroom had a jacuzzi tub in a nice size bathrom. The room was stocked in typical timeshare fashion. We had everything we needed. There is a Publix not far down the road (which has many small portion sizes). The hotel had a towel checkout limit, and you couldn't exchange. However, our room did have a washer dryer. The hotel is connected to a little shopping center with a few stores and food places and a Starbucks. Of course, it's also right on the beach. Although if you prefer there is a pool and a lazy river. I thought everything was kept clean and in good order. Although, I did read some complaints. I was happy! I thought it was beautiful. Onedownside was lack of inroom wifi. I went down to the lobby and joined all the PJ wearing people later in the evening. Another was our bathroom REEKED of smoke every so often. The Trendwest floor is no smoking....BUT the floors under are not. We were able to control it though, and it didn't ruin our trip. :-)

<Title>“Very nice place to stay, but don't expect much more”
<Content>Spent four weekdays here while attending a conference at the Hilton next door (the Hilton was sold out). Booking was a little confusing, as I didn't fully realize that I was essentially renting someone's timeshare. Whatever, I'm not picky that way. Picked out a one-bedroom deluxe oceanfront. Arrived around 8:30 PM, no problems checking in. Go up to my room, it's as advertised, looks very nice, clean, beautiful ocean view. Then I step onto the carpet. It squishes under my feet. Investigate further, water is on the tile floor by the toilet and the carpet where it meets the tile is soaked. Determine it's clean water, decide to leave well enough alone. By the next evening it's dry. Layout of the room is nice, everything was clean, kitchen was very well provisioned (I could have made waffles!), beautiful whirlpool tub and big shower. Even had packets of laundry detergent to use in the washer and dryer. Absolutely no complaints except for the standing water. Only other odd thing was that every window and the sliding glass door were all unlocked. The strike plate for the door was also loose. Fixed those things myself. I'm an engineer; I couldn't leave it like that... Go get my "Welcome Packet" the next evening and learn it's a marketing ploy to get you to listen to a timeshare sales pitch. Fortunately I'm busy all day every day and the nice lady behind the counter was not pushy. At this point I learn that the only food available here is vending machines or the glorified convenience store that is only open in the morning and early afternoon. Good thing the Ocean Walk Village is right next door. Come back to the room, flip open my laptop, start looking for Internet access. No joy. Only place it's available is in the lobby, but I could sit anywhere and it was free, just like the parking. Even though it was only about 50 degrees Fahrenheit outside the next morning, the outdoor pool was like a bathtub. Lazy river, etc. was all in working order. Wonderful! There was always a security guard out front and usually in the pool area. I never felt unsafe, even when walking back late at night. That may have been because the oceanfront was completely dead due to cold weather, etc. On the last day, I needed to store my suitcase while I attended the conference. It took an inordinate amount of time to locate a bellman to put my bag in the "closet." When he did finally show up, he did not have any claim tickets with him and just handed me a piece of paper with a couple of details as my "ticket." As a result of all this I was ten minutes late to the meeting. Go back to pick it up, again, no bellman, walk back with the maintenance guy to get my back from the "closet." It was an unused meeting room at the back corner of the hotel. It was not locked. This whole process took nearly 20 minutes. Ended up scrambling to make my return flight. Fortunately I only had to go back to DAB and not MCO. So, long story short, it's a beautiful hotel with a nice swimming area, but not much else. It is a great location, though. If I need to go back to Daytona, I will definitely price out staying there again.

Took the time to visit the Daytona 500 expierience and that was really cool - actually convinced us to come back for the 500 race. We stayed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk and had a fabulous time. We had a 2 bedroom condo and what a difference from staying in a little hotel room. They also had 4 pools and tons of stuff for the kids to do. We found an owner - Vicki - who rents out owners rooms there and we booked our stay for the 500 thru her - you can find her at DaytonaBeachRents dot com. Tell her Lee said to call.

<Title>“Really Nice Hotel with Lots of Activities”
<Content>We just got back from a trip to Daytona Beach and we stayed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk. I investigated the Wyndham and found such mixed reviews that I really hesitated in making a reservation. I looked at a lot of different options and found I could rent directly from the Wyndham, rent a room on eBay, or rent from an owner. I decided to find a room I liked and rent directly from a local owner so I knew what floor I was on and what the unit looked like and also had someone nearby if there were problems. We were SO happy with the room and would go that route again in the future. It was decorated beautifully, had new bedding and was very comfortable (we were on the 6th floor in the South Tower which was nice - we parked in the garage right outside our room). The people we rented from were incredibly nice and helpful. I was really concerned that we'd be pressured into timeshare sales since this is a timeshare location. We were not once even asked about timeshare sales. No phone calls, no literature, nothing. I also read that there were problems with elevators and that concerned me, but we had no issues at all. We have two children (1 and 4) and they had a ton of activities to do. It was FREEZING in Daytona this past week but there was still plenty to keep the kids busy. We went swimming at the indoor pools, the kids did some of their activities (which there were plenty to choose from), and we did the mini golf. I recommend staying at this hotel and will be back again soon!

<Title>“Loved the room!”
<Content>We had a 2 bdrm. The room was huge. The kids had 2 queen size beds and we had a king witha beaytiful bath and jaccuzi tub. Full kitchen and livingroom with balcony. Everything looked new. We stayed in the south tower which is closest to the mall. You walk out the 4th floor and you are at the movie theatre and restaurants. The weather was cold so we loved going to the movies. Plenty of restaurants near by. Hotel has a small cafe. The pools are beautiful. 3 outdoor and 2 indoor. The gym was great also. Better than most hotels.

<Title>“Great Family Vacation”
<Content>We had a wonderful experience. Check-in was a breeze. Our 2 bedroom condo was in great condition and very roomy. The only thing wrong was TV remote in the MB was missing the batteries, but maintence switched out the remote almost as soon we called. We were on the 12th floor with a view of the ocean. The kids loved playing in the pool and playing miniature golf. The weather was a bit chilly so we used the indoor pool the most. We did venture out to the outdoor pools but since the pool heater was broke we did not spend too much time there. Most of the staff was very friendly and helpful. Only one seemed a bit mean-spirited, but maybe she was having an off day.

<Content>I have stayed here 2x this year..both times was GREAT.. the 2bedroom lock out is A LOT better than the 2bedroom, but both are nice...There is not a lot to do in daytona so the Ocean walk has some thing going on every other hr...the kids loved it!! Look around for good deals. $200-$250 a night is kinda high for fall/winter. I will be going back with the family again and again

<Title>“Perfect Location! Resort has EVERYTHING!”
<Content>We stayed here for 3 nights in October. When I made the reservation to stay here, I didn't realize I was booking the best resort in the area! This place has everything! The check in was a little different. They are a timeshare resort, so after you check in, you have to go to this seperate desk to get your "welcome packet" where they try to schedule you for a tour. Yes, they do give you something for taking a tour, but we weren't interested. They were pushy for a moment but backed off. They only other complaints we had were you had to leave your license if you wanted to use a luggage cart, check out pool towels and if they weren't returned to the desk at the end of your stay you'd be charged $15 per towel and had to check out a pack n play. We used the luggage cart at the end of our stay and used bell service to get everything up to our room. Was well worth it since the rooms weren't close to where we checked in, We didn't check out pool towels since we were afraid we'd forget and leave them in our room, plus we already had our own. The other complaint was in the bedroom was a window leading to the hall. Although they had mini blinds up, the room was still quite lit up. We didn't have a problem with people walking by since we were towards the end of the hall, but was still weird having a window there. Would like to have seen black out curtains at least. Our room was on the 18th floor and couldn't have had a better view! You could sit on the couch in the living room and it felt like you were on a cruise ship....I look out the window to the balcony and could only see ocean! Can't get much better than that! The kitchen was adequate with everything we needed. We were able to go to the grocery store and get a few items to cook in our room. After that, we never left the property! There was no need. The pools were awesome!! Great kids pool, lazy river, etc. Beach was just right there so you could spend your day lounging from the beach to the pool, etc. Restaurants that were on property were pretty good as well. Didn't care for our meal at Bubba Gump, but service was great and staff was friendly. Overall, this is a wonderful place for families. They have lots of activities going on downstairs for all ages. We will def be back!

<Title>“AMAZING STAY”
<Content>We just returned from a 5 night stay at Wyndham Ocean Walk. It was the most amazing and relaxing vacation that either of us have had. We had an ocean view room on the 24th floor of the North Tower. The views were incredible. The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. The jacuzzi tub was an added bonus. The large stand up shower was relaxing. Everything about the room was great, the only thing we wished we had was opening windows in the bedroom so we could hear the ocean better at night. The central air was very efficient. Full kitchen ammenities and the washer/dryer were great to have. The hotel itself is a self contained community with every ammenity at your fingers. The basement floor has a inground pool, yoga studio, fitness center, childrens play center, billiards game room, computer center and more. There is a miniature golf course on the 4th floor. Ground level has a inground pool, eatery and bar. Outdoor pool area was incredible! Every morning we floated around the lazy river for awhile and then jumped in the pools and took great advantage of the water slide. I especially appreciated that the pools are 6ft deep in parts .... I know that in Orlando you are lucky to find a pool that gets to 5ft deep! Oh, and I'd like to add that the outdoor pools were NOT overly chlorinated! Infact, it was the cleanest and least chlorinated pool I have ever swam in. The indoor pools however, though very warm and inviting, did sting your nose and eyes a bit. It is a 1 minute walk from the pool area to "OceanWalk", where there are a variety of eateries, shops and even a 3 story movie theater! (The theater was awesome, seats were very comfortable). Across the street is a water park and indoor fun park. The water park was to our dismay closed for the season during our stay. We loved this hotel and can't wait to go back! It was the most relaxing vacation ever .... from the comforts of the room, to the magnitude of activites within walking distance ... from the refreshing pools to swimming in the warm ocean and walks along the beach, from Starbucks every morning to Coldstone IceCream for afternoon dessert .... and sitting at the maitai bar under the tiki torches and watching electric storms over the ocean .... absolutely amazing!

<Title>“Nice play to stay only a few surprises.”
<Content>We went on the trip for part business/part family trip. We went with our family of 4 plus 2 inlaws. The overall Resort was fabulous! Plenty of things to do at the resort, staff was pretty friendly and helpful and suite was very clean and nice. We only had a few surprises.... First when we booked the room we told the person that we would need 2 parking spaces. We were told it wasn't a problem the 1st space would be complimentary and the 2nd space was $10. What we didn't find out until we arrived was that only 1 of the 2 would be in the Wyndam Parking Garage. The 2nd space was across the street in the public parking garage. Not a huge deal, but a little aggravating when we all left to go somewhere. Then there was the luggage carts... if you want one, be prepared to give the attendant at the carts your driver's license. You won't get a cart unless you do. Again, not a big deal, but not too crazy about having to leave the license to get a cart. And finally, we did not know that they didn't have housekeeping come in unless you call and request (not a big deal though, I prefer people not running in and out of my room unless I'm there anyway). But we did find out after asking about getting additional clean towels that we had to wash the ones we had.(there was a stackable W/D in the suite). Again, not too big of a deal, but just wasn't informed. Pools could have used a vaccuum a little more but not bad. Overall it was a great place. Not complaining about these things just informing you of things we did not know at first. I did love the place. It was very well kept, staff was friendly, on site store and eating options. Just a few steps away is the Ocean Walk Shores Shoppes. There you find many different types of food, clothing, and a movie theater. Also there is the Bubba Gump Restaurant. There were plenty of pools on the property and security was seen constantly. I would stay at this location again.

<Title>“great trip”
<Content>loved this resort, plenty of security on the beach and resort to keep you safe, love the amenties. great lounge and little snack bar, couple of pools, a small lazy river and water slide, with a kids water area, also shops, restuarants, movie theater and water park next door. can't drive on beach at resort but entrance only a few blocks away if you would like to do that I did not like the parking, but I guess limited space near beach. Looked like other parts of Daytona were hurting so not much open, but did not need to go far, everything pretty much right there at your resort. A little pricey, and everyone does not get a window, a balcony toward ocean is precious.

<Title>“Great Hotel with everything you could want!”
<Content>This hotel was great because it had so much to do at the resort itself! There were bike rentals and beach rentals right in front of the hotel! Had a girls weekend with my family members and we had a blast! Nice big rooms so there was plenty of room for all our luggage! The only thing is that they allowed only one car parking ticket. We had two cars so we had to pay extra to park that car in a ramp across the street but other than that great hotel!

<Title>“Best Location in Daytona Beach”
<Content>This place was connected to the movie theater mall & beside the band shell! It has 2 indoor & 2 outdoor pools. Also an inside putt putt golf course and a putting area in the middle of the lazy river. Inner Tubes are FREE and it is definately fun for all ages. There is a cool bar by the pool but it is not the place just to be quiet and listen to the ocean- Always music blasting! There is a fun slide for older kids and a entire little kids play area with sprinkler and pool. You must get a ocean front room! The master bdrm lacks a balcony but has a jacuzzi. The 2nd and 3rd bdrms windows face the outer hallway. The hallway stays lite 24/7. It only has blinds and it's never completely dark in the room. I was in the master but if I had to sleep a week in the other rooms it would annoy me- really silly design! My unit had a mold issue under the sink cabnets. You could not see it but smelled it strong when you opened the doors. Same smell in bathroom toilet room so I just left door shut at all times. I have allergies so it was bother some. There must have been a leak at some point but no visible problems now, just the lingering smell. The staff was ridiculouly friendly and helpful. Lots of things for the kids to do all day and a fair amount for adults as well. There is only free parking for 1 car and $10 fee for each addition. TV's are older and small and there is no internet in the unit but there is a business center and free wi-fi in the lobby. It had a stackable washer & dryer. Kitchen was nicely furnished, also had an icemaker & dish washer. My unit had a vacuum sweeper and the belt broke. The maintenance person was surprised that the sweeper was there and said it will be replaced with a Swifter for carpet. . With seven people & dark carpet the sweeper needed to be ran every second day and I definately would want a electric sweeper to pick up more than just surface dirt! You had to sign for beach towels & they had a $15 charge per towel if not returnrd. We ate Pizza at 3 differnt places- Napoli across the street was open late and was the Best!

<Title>“Nice Place”
<Content>I would definitely go back to the Oceanwalk, Overall the resort is quite nice. All public areas are kept clean The security personnel were all nice. "MOST" of the front desk clerks were quite nice, helpful too. If they would just replace the two 'OLD' double bed mattresses with some new ones. The bedroom is quite large, they could put two queen size beds which would be better yet!! I wish I had taken some pictures of those beds!! You sank in the middle!!! The resort has a nice toddler's area pool, two outdoor pools, hot tubs, indoor pools, Tiki bar, children's activities center, I could go on. It is a family resort, so I guess at times it could be overrun with kids!! We visited the resort the last week in August, kids first week in school down south, so, it was nice, some but not a lot of school age kids. quite a few young families though,with toddlers. I did enjoy the beach and/ or pool areas everyday!!

<Title>“Relaxing, enjoyable - and glad I didn't stay away due to reviews!”
<Content>This vacation was a gift to us and after reading the reviews we seriously considered calling the gift-giver to change the location. I'm glad we didn't. There's good and bad in most all vacation stays. However, our stay at the Wyndham Ocean Walk was very positive. We had a clean, beautiful room with a great view of the ocean and the river. We were able to get some awesome pics from the LR balcony. The rug was worn and the furniture average, but everything was clean though so we really had no complaints. Very spacious. We were there at the end of August and had absolutely no problem w/ waiting for the elevators. The pool areas were clean and well managed. The Lazy River was green on the sides and bottom but the water was clear. We all really enjoyed the Lazy River and the awesome slide at the main pool. It wasn't as nice as a Disney or Universal resort, but it was well-suited for a relaxing vacation. The convenience was awesome - didn't have to drive anywhere. Movies, shops, drugstore, etc. all within easy walking distance. The ocean at our backdoor - wonderful convenience. The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. I didn't encounter one rude employee or anyone not willing to help when I needed it. Other guests were also very nice/friendly. I'm glad I read the reviews to get an idea of what to expect, but I think being proactive, calling ahead w/ concerns, etc. and going prepared really made a big difference in our stay.

<Title>“Bed Bugs!!!! Stay Away & Save UR $!!!!”
<Content>My husband, children and I were invited to go with a couple of friends and their children on a much needed trip to the beach. We stayed in a nice enough condo and enjoyed the beach daily. My son woke up one morning covered in welts. I assumed, because he has very sensitive skin, that he had a reaction to the sunscreen we were coating him in. A couple of days after we returned home I notice a small brownish-red bug in my daughter's room and didn't really think much about it because it has been a bad summer for bugs in our neck of the woods. After finding another yesterday morning and logging onto the internet to research bugs I discovered that we have BED BUGS!!!! I cannot tell you how upset and disgusted I am! I wish that I had thought to check reviews before going. I cannot believe that this is happening! Please, if you are considering staying here, DON'T! Aside from the uninvited guests, our overall experience was not great! We too waited to get checked in for over an hour. Several nights the fire alarm kept going off only to be met with an announcement to ignore. It was not clean and the people on staff were not friendly! Please stay somewhere else for your own good!

<Title>“Awesome - Very enjoyable stay”
<Content>We spent the week before school started at the Ocean Walk and had a great time. After reading other reviews I was concerned about the elevator issues but we had very few problems. Check-in and check-out were obviously busy times for the elevators, but regular usage was no problem. The staff was awesome - quick check in at 3:45 on a Saturday. The room was nice and clean with lots of dishes and utensils. The room was very very nice. No parking issues at all - we went out 1-2 times a day and always found a close parking spot on the first level of the parking garage. It appeared to fill up late at night but this was not an issue for us as we were in our room after about 9:00 PM. The pool area was awesome and beach was beautiful. Our son did a few of the activities for kids and enjoyed them. The activities staff was very helpful and nice. In some reviews people complain about the '30-minute chair reserve policy' but we liked it. It's so frustrating to visit a hotel where at 7:00 AM every morning people rush to the pool, throw their towel on a chair, and then claim it for the entire day (even if they don't use it more than a few minutes). This allowed us to find a chair when we needed it. We were disappointed at the lack of a sit-down restaurant on property, but there were a few places to eat within walking distance. The only complains we had were that Daytona itself is kind of a dump - very few nice restaurants, lots of old/run down/closed businesses, but we had a great time at the resort. Also no free Internet access! Free wifi in the lobby, but you're out of luck in your room. It's ridiculous that the redneck hotel down the street has free wifi but the Wyndham can't provide it when you pay $200+ night. We would have gladly paid for wifi.

<Title>“Walk on by the Wyndham Ocean Walk”
<Content>1. Upon driving 15 hours and checking in, I had to wait for over an hour and a half to catch an elevator from the parking garage to our floor. That was ridiculous. 2. The pool policy of confiscating all our stuff after 30 minutes is horrible. I was swimming with two children and we decided to get out of the pool. We got to our chair only to discover all our stuff was missing. It took me 15 minutes of searching out "security" guards to find out that they threw it all in a trash bag. This is a horrible, horrible policy for a "family" resort. Do you really expect people to just lay out and sunbathe and not get in the pools without constantly running back to security and "checking in" to make sure all their stuff doesn't vanish. It's a damn good thing I didn't have my wallet, cell phone or any valuables with me that day. 3. The utensils in the room were sub-par. We had to make due with a pizza cutter that was broken. The only pot in the room held about 2 cups of water and there were no baking pans at all. I have stayed at many different resorts through time share trades and this one was the worst stocked kitchen I have ever seen and it wasn't even close. 4. The door on the second bedroom of the unit we had wouldn't even close because of swelling or it was improperly hung. 5. The shower in the main bedroom wasn't very clean upon check in. It wasn't filthy, but it also looked like it hadn't be truly cleaned in a few weeks. 6. The pool area was roped off every morning for cleaning. We walked on the beach to see the sunrise one morning and security wouldn't let us walk through the pool area to access the beach. We had to walk through the resort down to the South exit to get to the beach. For a resort that is "on the beach" that is another horrible policy. 7. No fewer than 3 times did the fire alarm go off during the week. I felt like I was a freshman in college again living in a crappy dorm. All in all, we were quite disappointed with our week but made the most of it. Actually the expression "that's Wyndham for you" became sort of a running joke with us as the week progressed. I can not and will not recommend this resort to anyone.

<Title>“HUGE disappointment, will NOT be back”
<Content>We spent a week at Ocean Walk the last week of July. After reading the mixed reviews, we felt compelled to give it a try, WISH WE HAD LISTENED TO THE BAD ONES. Check in was a joke, waited over 45 minutes to check into a room you had already paid for in full. They did come around and pass out cookies, pizza and drinks. The front desk at this time were nice. Elevators were a joke. We always waited at least 15 minutes and several times we opted for the stairs which was not bad since we were on the 6th floor, but not a option if you were on the 19th. Pool area would and could be nice if it was taken care of. Lazy river always looked dirty and pool with slide ALWAYS had sand and junk in it even though they supposeably cleaned it every morning.We even seen feces in it our last evening! Parking was a joke if you came in late but they did pay for our parking the night we had to use the garage across the street. The security guards around there were VERY nasty and not kid friendly at all. The concept was good to have them, but they were very nasty to small children and patrolled things that didnt need it and things that did need to be addressed were over looked. You were suppose to wear wrist bands but again security picked and choose who they would check. We rented from a VRBO and room was ok. No sheets on pull out and we were told we had to ask owners, blender didnt work, little things like that.We did voice our concerns to the front desk but they were simply ignored. One staff member did agree with me that the security guards were very nasty but again that went no where. Over all huge dissapointment and we have decided our last visit to Daytona. Such a shame that a place that advertises how wonderful it is, really is anything but. DON'T waste your money, pay attention to the bad reviews. Believe me they are there for a reason!!

<Title>“Will definitely go back again!”
<Content>We arrived at 5 pm on a Sunday and the lobby was packed! However, we quickly got our room in about 10 minutes. I was quite impressed with the size of the resort how quickly we got in our room. The only downside to the resort is parking. There is only 1 parking space per unit even if you are in a 3 or 4 bedroom suite. There was convenient parking garage across the street. The parking garage had a special rate for Wyndham guests. However, it was rather confusing to purchase and use. This resort is 75% timeshared so more than likely you will be asked to attend a timeshare meeting for some gift. The pools, lazy river, and beach were outstanding - by far the best out there! The resort also has beach towels for all of their guests! Internet was found only in the lobby. The rooms were quite spacious with a great view of the ocean and beach. However, not all of the rooms face the ocean. Lastly, my family had a great time doing many of the activities the resort has to offer. Most of them are geared towards children. I will definitely try to get back there again!

<Title>“Fabulous Vacation”
<Content>My husband, young son (4) and extended family got back Monday from a week stay at the Ocean Walk. I have to tell you that this resort impressed me very much. I have traveled widely, and had little to no complaints with this resort. There were ten of us in a 3 bedroom timeshare. We had a washer and dryer, as well as a full kitchen. While it is true that there were not many towels, doing laundry was no trouble at all. You could start it in the morning when you got up, throw stuff in the dryer, and have it be done when you got back from the beach. The pools were great, and the beach was lovely. We brought our own beach towels from home, and bought a cheap umbrella for 20 bucks. The food poolside was a tad expensive (9 bucks for a burger and fries) but hey, thats hotel food for you. I really enjoyed the activites the hotel had during our stay. We went to karaoke 3 times, water aerobics 2x, and hip hop aerobics! They also had a pirate and princess party that my 5 yr old niece enjoyed, and a hoola hoop contest my 9 yr old niece competed in. My son has autism and had a great time with the pools and the ocean, which was a great relief to us. Our hotel room never felt crowded. I do agree that the elevator situation is a complete joke. We stayed in the North Tower, which had 25 floors. One bank of elevators (4 total) is not nearly enough. I also don't understand why there isn't hotel wide wi-fi. However, even with those things considered, we had a fabulous time. The room was beautiful, the pool was great, and the beach was just gorgeous. I would go again in a heartbeat!

<Title>“Filthy room; Overcharged $560; Do not trust Daytona Ocean Rentals or Wyndham Ocean Walk”
<Content>As an avid traveler who has had wonderful and not-so-wonderful hotel experiences, I am imploring you NOT to stay at the Wyndham Ocean Walk! I rented a one-bedroom condo at the Ocean Walk from Daytona Ocean Rentals (DBA Cindy Grutza). The room was filthy! The bed linens were stained (both the set of linens on the bed and the back-up set) and the blanket had cigarette burns in it, even though the room was supposed to be non-smoking. The night stand and kitchen table both had sticky soda stains all over their surfaces. And the last renter's toiletries were still in the bathroom (someone's used razors, dirty hair brush. old Ziploc bags and tampon wrappers are not my idea of cleanliness). It was a complete nightmare. To top it all off, the view from the balcony had been deliberately misrepresented. It looks as though Daytona Ocean Rentals took a picture of the view from a few floors above this condo and cropped the photo so you don't realize until you arrive that your view is 100% obstructed. Yes -- the entire hotel is between your room and the ocean. And with wall-to-wall windows along each internal hallway, all 20-something floors can see you while you try to relax on your balcony. I work in marketing; I know exactly how and why the picture was cropped like it was. To make matters even worse, Daytona Ocean Rentals overcharged me $560! They promised to refund the unused portion of our stay because of these problems (which is the only reason we checked out early; otherwise we would have purchased our own sheets and stuck it out). But when I got home from vacation later in the week, I received a handwritten note (oh yeah, she's that professional) saying she had changed her mind and would not be refunding our money. I have never in my entire life had a hotel or a merchant rip me off. It is the most frustrating experience I have ever had and I would never want another person to have to endure this. In an economy like this where people are struggling, I find it disgusting that there are hotels and rental companies who are trying to take advantage of people to make an extra buck. Please don't let this happen to you. Stay at the Hampton Inn; RUN from the Ocean Walk and Daytona Ocean Rentals!

<Title>“Our Family Would Not Recommend”
<Content>For several years we have wanted to take our young sons to the Wyndham Oceanwalk Resort. Though we already had our yearly Daytona Beach reservations in place we began to research the possibility of changing our plans and surprising our boys. Many hours were spent in search of an affordable room and reading different reviews. Even though some reviews made us second guess our change, we truly believed it would be the greatest vacation ever. Well, you decide! We arrived to a traffic and check-in nightmare even though we were allowed an early (2:00 pm) check-in. During check-in we were given blue armbands to wear during our stay. I have no problem with the armband if you can remove it before going out and if everyone else wears theirs while at the resort. If worn as supposedly required you make a good target for those looking to cash in on vacationers. Our unit (606) was an owner unit and it only had five bath towels. Our rental didn’t provide housekeeping so we were required to do our own laundry. So, with 5 bath towels we were basically doing laundry every day. I would recommend using the dryer while out of the unit due to the “jet engine” sound it makes while running. Lounge chairs were hard to come by. In order to get a chair you had to wait in lobby along with lots of other guests until 8:15 when pool area was opened and race to a chair. So, forget sleeping in. Also, be prepared to wait in line just to get in the lazy river. People aren’t allowed in it without a tube which is usually hard to come by. No “body floating” is allowed. On second day, buses, vans, and more buses arrive with youth groups attending a youth convention. Resort was overtaken by teenagers. People would “knock and run” on door and windows at all hours of the day and night. Elevators which required patience anyway were basically inaccessible when youth groups came in. The joke was to press all 20 plus buttons so it would stop at all floors all the time. If you pick this resort we recommend checking the Daytona Convention Center events calendar before booking. On third day, air conditioning in parts of the south tower quit working. Air conditioning was not restored for approximately 30 hours. Our 85 degree room was abandoned for an entire day. We were lucky to have family at a nearby resort so we spent the day with them. Resort management was very unprofessional, unfriendly, and unaccommodating about the whole ordeal. During our vacation we experienced many other unpleasant events similar to those we read in earlier reviews. Due to our experience with Wyndham Oceanwalk we will no longer spend our money or precious family time at any other Wyndham property.

<Title>“Would not recommend”
<Content>Very, very disappointed. Room was not what was advertised second bedroom was not a kings size bed instead two doubles (two adults could not sleep on) Aside from the disarray of the room. For instance: holes in the doors, wallpaper falling of the walls, a noisy dyer, washing machine did not work. Called for blanket and pillows all three days, never received pillows even after complaining at the front desk. We didn't want extra there were not provided for the pull out couch ! Outside on pool deck security always present but we still have a camera and a bag stolen in broad daylight. This probably happened because of the lack of appropriate wrist bands for the pool (they ran out for several days) So anyone could come onto the pool deck from the beach and security let them in. We were told that four bags were stolen that day and that security was not owned by the hotel they were contracted to an outside company.The pool was cloudy,sandy,salty and many times a hairball(serious) and other stuff would float by. There was little difference between the pool and the ocean.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!

<Title>“Beware of Promises Made By Wyndham”
<Content>As a VIP owner of Wyndham Timeshare points, I have had mostly good things to say about different Wydham properties. Ocean Walk in Daytona Beach, Florida, is a different story. First, as a VIP owner, I am supposed to be given priority for room selection (or atleast that's what they promise at the owner update sessions). On this trip, we were put in the South Tower. To put it politely, the South Tower is run down. The cabinets are chipped and peeling, there was missing kitchen tools, no pillows or blanket for the fold out couch, and moldy looking patio furniture. The front desk was polite about the shortcomings of their facility, but offered nothing to correct the situation. The only thing they offered was to send us out to dinner to make up for it. This fall they plan to start renovating the South Tower. Until then, I suggest you stay away, or demand to be placed in the North Tower. The sample rooms they show you during the "owner update" presentation are located there, and they look pretty nice.

<Title>“Perfectly fine place for family stay in Daytona Beach”
<Content>I read all of the reviews and was a little worried about what to expect, but my experience was great. Check-in is at 4:00pm - not a minute sooner - you've read it many times and it is true, so just don't get worked up about it. We (family of 6) arrived about 1 hour early, so we just walked around the resort until 4pm. The young man at the check-in desk was very cordial, and he go us pre-registered and parked, so we could just pick up the keys at 4:00 and get righ to the room. The room (oceanfront 2br on the 10th floor) was very nice, and it did not show some of the wear and tear that many beach hotels have. It's a little wierd this day not to have internet in the room, but we adapted. The kids also thought their view of the coke machine from the 2nd bedroom was funny (our oceanfront view from the master bedroom was just fine.) Pool chairs were tough to come by, but we had a great time out on the beach in the morning ($25 to rent 2 loungers and a big umbrella) and then hit the pools after the crowds left. The beach is clean and wide, and a nice tidal pool and sandbar appears at lowtide - perfect for the kids. Oceanwalk next door was convenient for food (we ate at a pizza place and Bubba Gumps, and there is also a Johnny Rocket's over there.) The water park across the street was great for kids (don't remember the price.) We also saw a movie at the Oceanwalk theaters. There's a Starbuck's at Oceanwalk too. Overall, very few if any complaints. Great room, great price, great location (no beach raffic in front of the hotel either.)

<Title>“Luxury Resort or Motel 6...You Decide”
<Content>If you want to pay "luxury resort" prices for Motel 6 accommodations, then this is your place! If you want to check-in to a "zoo", then this is your place. The only thing the Wyndham has going for it is location. Service? Non-existent. No valet parking, no bell assistance with luggage, no room service, no in-room internet connection, no daily room cleaning. Want clean towels? Better find a maid's cart -- they tell you to wash your own. Yes they provide a stackable washer/dryer in 1-bedroom units, but who wants to do laundry on a vacation weekend? When you walk into the lobby you feel like there is absolutely no control over the place. It's like a free-for-all with a lot of "lower class" people with tons of unruly kids running around in wet bathing suits dragging their blow-up air mattresses behind them. Smelly old men with Speed-o bathing suits in the elevator. Elevators? Only 4 small ones and SLOWER THAN A SNAIL. Don't even think about trying to get on one with luggage. That's a 30-minute wait to find one that's even close to being able to accommodate you and your luggage. Oh yes, did I mention the Spa? Or rather the non-existent spa--they advertise one, but it is permanently closed. Don't waste your money here. Instead book at the Hilton right next door. At least they can truthfully say they are a luxury resort. The Wyndham is a Section 8 housing project!

<Title>“Great Location, lots to do, but property in need of a facelift”
<Content>I was disappointed and expected the rooms and property to be much nicer. I don't know if this is a privately owned unit or not. (1627) I rented online and assumed it was a Wyndham hotel. We rented a two bedroom oceanfront unit in the north tower. I can't complain about the size, the unit was huge with pleanty of room. The two full/queen beds in the first bedroom were in horrible shape. The mattresses were sagging in the middle and were as far from luxury as you can possibly get. Unfortunately I got stuck with that room and did not sleep for two days. The pillows were also flat and the linens were heavily used and needed to be replaced. Even a matress pad would help. The king bed was also hard as a rock and way past it's peak. Seriously folks ... the beds were horrible. The kitchen and dining area was absolutely fine. The living room furniture was a bit grubby and needed cleaned. Balcony was nice and the view was awesome. Traveling with teens, finding something to do was not a problem. They enjoyed the pool and lazy river. The pools are on the verge of needing resurfacing or something .. they appear more green than blue. None the less it was fine. The tiki bar at the pool was fun ... but it closed really early ? Not sure why. We had no problems with check in or the service. They are a little stingy on parking ... only one vehicle allowed. I guess if this is a privately owned unit someone needs to tell the owner it needs some work ... if this is a Wyndham unit I'd say their standards have gone down hill. This is not a luxury property by any means but all in all we'd go back but hope for a better unit.

<Title>“Customer Service is a joke!”
<Content>My family and I rented unit 1304A & B in the south tower for 4 nights from an owner. When we arrived in our room, the smell was awful. The whole place smelled like rotten garlic or something. I too agree with everyone about the B units.... do NOT stay in one. Ours had a lovely view of the hallway too, which we were told it had a riverview, but I guess it did if you opened your blinds and looked through the hall out the back of the place. But who wants to open their windows into a hallway where everyone can look in your room as they pass??? There were no overhead lights either. All you had were lamps so it looked like a dungeon. Also, the first night we were there, the air conditioners on the entire 13th floor were out. We called repeatedly to the front desk and all we were told is we were on a waiting list. I finally asked to speak to a manager and she said there was nothing they could do. Meanwhile, my 4 year old daughter was pouring in sweat in her sleep in our 1304B dungeon. The front desk staff were rude and acted as if they couldn't care less! So I waited out in the hallway for the "engineer" and my mother camped out in the lobby along with other guests from our floor until they finally did something about it. Also, the water in the B unit never would get hot. The dryer in the A unit would run continuously all night even unless you stopped it. Elevators at this place are a nightmare. Especially in the afternoon thunderstorm time. We waited up to 40 minutes one time just to get on an elevator. Also, in the lazy river, be sure you get a hold of one of their 15 round floats or else the nazi staff will boot you out. They insist you have one of their floats in the lazy river, yet they only have a handful of them. So you spend a great deal of time standing at the steps waiting on someone to feel guilty enough to get off and give you a turn with one. Crazy! They don't allow anyone on the water slide until around 10:30 or 11:00 and they shut it back down around 5 or 6. Ridiculous! Room keys rarely if ever worked when trying to get back into the resort from the Ocean Walk Shoppe area. Had to stand there and wait until someone happened to walk by to let you in. Room keys also rarely worked for the parking garage and quit working to our rooms a day early! Ocean Walk is nice for the location... but that is about it.

<Title>“OceanWalk Unit 2222AB - Best Place to stay in Daytona!”
<Content>We stayed in Unit 2222AB which we rented from a private Owner (Carmen & Dennis) http://daytonaoceanfrontrentals.com/Ocean_Walk_2222-2224_2322.htm The unit was very spacious for our family of 4 (2 teenage boys) they LOVED having their own space. Unit 2222AB is actually 2 one bedroom units that have a door in the middle that connect the 2 into a Two bedroom unit. I appreciated the coffee s& filters stocked for us in the room so we could have coffee on our first morning before we went grocery shoppping. The unit was stocked with adequate dishes and pots and pans making meal prep convenient. The King Bed in the master bedroom was VERY comfortable. Definately a high quality mattress. The 2 double mattresses in the other bedroom was worn and one even sagged in the middle. THe towels were also high quality. THe condo contained shampoo, soap, dish detergent, bath foam. The resort DOES NOT have ice machines. Be sure to turn ON your ice machine in the condo freezers if you want ice. The resort does have a lot of activities for all ages. Women be sure to take advantage of their $5 Spa package on Tuesday at 1:30. It is quit the bargain for the price. It is actually a beauty control consultant promoting their spa products but you get to try a lot of stuff and it is in a very spa like environment. For $5 you get a warm neck wrap, instant manicure, facial, dark circle/eye treatment, foot treatments and seveal other pampering items. It is very well worth your $5 and a 80 minutes of pleasant treatment. I would recommend this unit to anyone, while it could stand some DEEP cleaning, it was suitable. My sons LOVED the wireless internet connection in the rooms. If you rent from the hotel and NOT from a private owner like Carmen & Dennis, you will NOT get the inroom free internet. Renting from this private couple was easy and they are very professional and pleasant. ALSO, Remember check out is at 10 am, your room Key will deactivate at exactly 10am. if you are loading things in the car and the clock ticks 10am, your key will not work. So be prepared. however, the front desk very kindly reactivated our key to get us back in the room to finish getting our stuff. We walked the beach for miles and there was not any other Resort that looked to compare to Ocean Walk. (I would consider the Hilton, but that woudl be the ONLY other one). The ocean walk is definately conveniently located to shops, movies, and restuarants.

<Title>“OK Overall”
<Content>Just returned to Indiana after staying in Ocean Walk resort. On the plus side there was alot of activities for all age groups, lots of places to go within walkin distance, staff was fairly helpful and nice. On the the downside we arrived early (noon) and were able to check in while waiting for room to be ready. We were told that it would be ready around 2pm and to check back. From there it went from being told to check back every 15 minutes to finally getting in after 5 pm. You would think that by knowing we were already there, checked in, and been waiting almost 6 hrs that the rooms would look alot cleaner that they did. Floors looked swept not mopped, carpet was iffy at best, no wash cloths, and no batteries in smoke alarm. Although the staff was somewhat quick to fix the problems they should have already been taken care during the time we waited just to get into the room. Vacation was wonderful after minor things were taken care of. I would like to make 1 suggestion to resort and that would be to either add more computers or allow access to internet from individual rooms. Would probably return if offered good deal on prices for stay

<Title>“very dissapointed”
<Content>My family has stayed at the ocean walk many times before and we have always been satisfied. We love the location. but when we went a few days ago we were very disseminated with the service. we were traveling with 7 people and we were in a 2 bedroom condo. there went enough beds so we called the front desk to ask for a roll away bed, which we have gotten every time we have stayed at the resort, and the lady said "we don't do that" we also called to get coffee because we already used what we had and the same lady replied "we don't do that". My friend and i had to share the small and uncomfortable sleeper sofa which we didnt have pillows for. after getting home from a movie around 12 am we walked down to house keeping and asked for pillows and the guy said "you have to go to the front desk", even though there were pillows right next to him. so we went to the front desk and a nasty woman said "ill send them up". The pillows never came, so we took the couch pillows and had to use those. my family was unaware that you can only have one parking space per room. so the nasty security guard yelled at my cousin and told her she had to park across the street. another security guard kicked us out of the lazy river because we didn't have tubes. the rooms were pretty nice, the TV in one of the bedrooms didn't have a remote though. at night there were a lot of drunk people in the lobby and in the hallways making lots of noise.

<Title>“I would rate this resort 5 stars but that won't be fair.....”
<Content>Over all, this resort is great. I have a year old son and 7 yr old daughter and they both loved it, my wife loved it and I loved it. At least my son looked like he loved this resort from what I can see. We parked our car after our check-in and did not need to get back in until after the check-out. Everything was right there. Everything you can think of to keep your kids busy is right there within the resort or they are right near. I was little concerned about bedbugs cause I've read some reviews but we were a okay. Rooms were clean, staffs were nice, I think (didn't really need them). Few negative things I can think of... pools can be crowded but that's expected. We had to search for the empty pool chairs but it was no big deal. Waiting time for elevators can be nerve racking but when you have two high rise building, there's really nothing much they can do so it was ok too. We go to Daytona Beach every year and I will be going back to Ocean Walk again for sure.

<Title>“I will go back as often as I can”
<Content>This place is great. Theres not much more I can say about it. I came here with a friend when I was 15 years old and I have raved about it ever since! I finally got to go back this month and I am seriously considering moving to Daytona just to be closer to this resort. The rooms are huge and they are so clean! I only paid $99 a night and I got an ocean front balcony, a full kitchen, and a bedroom seperate from the living area. Everything is modern and fun. Outside there are two pools, two hot tubs, and an area for kids to play. On holidays, (4th of July, Cinco De Mayo, Halloween,) there are special events poolside. I was there when Tantric performed in 2002. I just think that out of every hotel or resort available, I will always chose a Wyndham dor the rest of my life.

<Title>“Fabulous location!! A few problems with the room.”
<Content>Wow, all I can say is that this is a fabulous location. You are right on the beach, fabulous views from the balconies - we were on the side, and still had a great view. The resorts pools are great, include a waterslide and small waterfall, which the kids loved. Also, a lazy river, which was a little small, but that didn't matter to the kids. There was also a kiddie play area with 1 foot deep water. When it gets a little cold or too windy outside, there are also 2 indoor pools. There is a bar out by the pools where you can also get food. Or just pop right next door to the Ocean Walk shoppes for a large variety (Bubba Gump's is recommended, and I don't eat seafood!). You walk out the back of the resorts past the pool, out the gate (you need your room key to get back in) and poof, you are on the beach! This was the best part of being at the resort - plus it's in a no-vehicle-on-the-beach area. There are also beach vendors selling food and drink (cheaper than the pool bar). We did have a few problems with the room - hole in the wall, no towels, missing doorknob on guest BR door, shower door off track in Master BR, wet carpet, broken toaster, and, our favorite, a pair of kid's underwear from the previous guests found in the living room! They did resolve all the items we reported on the first day (toaster and underwear happened later in the week, and we just didn't want to bother). Activities center was very nice - went for an ice cream social and to paint ceramics. Reasonably priced. No internet access in the room itself. Wireless was available down in the business center. They also had computers there that you could use. Also access to a printer to be able to print boarding passes. Beware of the hair weave people at the resort. They charge $2 per inch for the hair wrap. She wrapped at least 2 inches longer than my niece's hair, and it started to come undone where it wasn't wrapped around the hair. She did fix it that same day, but the wrap should have been 2 inches shorter (and $4 cheaper) in the first place. Shopping - there is a souvenir shop called Oceanic Gifts on N. Atlantic, 2 shops north of Main St. Prices here were very reasonable, good selection, friendly staff. The one that's across the street from the resort (I don't remember the name), I would not recommend. They do the iron-on designs, and after 1 washing, the decal on one of the two shirts purchased already started to come off. They were also kind of pushy. Bottom line - the location of this resort really overrides the issues we had with the room. They were all minor issues, but the fact that there were so many of them made it seem worse. If we had the opportunity to stay here again, we probably would, despite the problems.

<Title>“Great Place for any age person!”
<Content>We just got back from our second week stay - one week in March and one in April. Both times we were there we were very satisfied with the facility. We had ocean front rooms overlooking the pool area. The week in March there were several college students staying there on break. The resort had several security guards on duty to make sure that no one got to wild. The pool area is fun for people of all ages. There is a lazy river in which there were infants riding on their parents laps to people that looked to be in their 70's floating around. There were lots of acitivites for kids, a computer lab, a nice fitness center, and indoor pools besides the outdoor pools. There are grocery stores close by, a beautiful beach to walk on which goes for miles, several places to eat nearby from a Burger King to a restaurant on the Pier, to Buba Gumps, and numerous shops within walking distance. The rooms we stayed in had 1 bedroom and were very clean and had full kitchens with all the appliances and dishes we needed. The hairdryer did not work in the room we had so we called the owner of our unit, Cindy Grutza, and she had a new one there for us the next day. Both times we stayed there we were completely satisfied and we plan to return.

The two bedroom suite had two balconies each overlooking the ocean and beach with two bedrooms with living room in the middle, full kitchen and dining room table. The lockout is two one bedroom suites connected by a door lockable each side. They were both time share condos that were available for nightly rental. I had read a previous Trip Advisor member's review about having a room with the only window looking out on the hallway and it's true! The room was very nice, but the bedroom window literally is on the interior hallway! This was no issue for us because the connecting room had a complete ocean view. So, just ask, if you cannot tolerate that! Personnel were very courteous and friendly, security is present and able to assist, Daytona definitely has a spring break personality! Overall, we had a wonderful experience: two adults and many teenagers. All enjoyed the lovely and entertaining pool area and controlled beach access. Guests wear wristbands to have access to the pool deck.

<Title>“Worst place we've stayed in Daytona”
<Content>We were discovery visitors. Very disappointed in room. Had a view of noisy Atlantic Blvd. Sliding doors that wouldn't lock and screen doors off frames. Sofa fabric was filthy with stains, (afraid to sit on it.) TV's were very old and not good reception. Lightbulbs in room were burnt out, tile floors dirty, shower floor dirty. Upon arrival were told to pick up our "welcome package". A few sheets of pink paper stapled together with TV listings and recommended shops. Any Hampton Inn is an upgrade from Ocean Walk.

<Title>“Comfortable, basic hotel in good location”
<Content>This resort is pretty basic compared to most of the Wyndham resorts we have stayed at. My husband and I stayed in the South Tower in a "B" room. I take it from our discussion with the Wyndham representative who provided us our welcome packet that these were on the lowest tier of rooms. Ours included a washer/dryer combo, and a full-size refrigerator and sink/garbage disposal in a small, stocked kitchenette. Admittedly, the fixtures in our room were dated and they did not provide tissues or washrags, but all of the appliances worked fine and the room was immaculate. The B rooms have one really odd feature: there are two large picture windows in the suite—one in the front room and one in the bedroom—but they both look out into the hallway! So for obvious privacy issues, my husband and I kept the curtains closed the entire stay…a bit disappointing when you’ve come out to enjoy the sun. We were concerned that there would be a lot of noise from the adjoining room, but we rarely heard our neighbors. Amenities were nice—indoor and outdoor pools, lazy river (unusual feature, fun for kids and adults), and hot tub that is on the edge of the property near the boardwalk so you can look out into the ocean. The pool bar provides basic sandwiches, burgers, fries etc. and drinks—it was a nice place to sit outside and grab a bite if you didn’t want to wander to far from the beach. The beach in front of the property is really, really wide and it was far less crowded than areas away from the resort. Service at the resort was fine (of course, they tried to con us into a “just 45 minutes!” informational session on the resort…the sales pitch gets really old every time we utilize our timeshare points). We had no issues checking in late (11pm) the day of our arrival, and we utilized their express check out option so that we did not have to stand in line at the front desk. All in all, just as we expected.

<Title>“GREAT FAMILY STAY”
<Content>My husband & I stayed with our son and his family which consisted of 2 boys age 4 & 7. We reserved the 2 bedroom unit and received one unit with full kitchen, bath with jacuzzi and large shower which was actually 2 bathrooms with one toilet. Adjoining was a lock out unit which was a smaller version of the other unit. The most important difference was one unit had a balcony with oceanfront - very sunny and pleasant. The lock out faced the hallway (no privacy) and had no outside windows and was very dark and dreary. Our units were very clean but were in the rental pool and needed some minor repairs done. As for the rest of the place - it was fantastic! It had 2 indoor pools and 4 outdoor including a lazy river. The bad was none were heated so they were not being used except for the lazy river. The hot tub was full of children. They also had a water slide which I never saw anyone use because it ended up in a cold pool. The beach was very convenient and clean. No cars on this section. For $25.00 per day you could rent 2 chaises, an umbrella and table. For $26 you could buy 2 beach chairs at Publix. The hotel furnishes beach towels. The hotel itself is time share so they offer things to do and many amenites for children and adults alike. They even have an indoor miniature golf course. There is plenty to do here if you want. It sits next door to restaurants and a movie theatre as well. Parking is limited to one vehicle in their parking ramp and is controlled. The second vehicle has to go in a pay garage about a short block away and across the street. We brought steaks and were very disappointed that with so many amenites, they did not have a BBQ grill. They have a restaurant and mini market on site. We wished we could stay for a week but the weather was still a little cool with the wind tho the sun hot.

<Title>“Not Impressed”
<Content>My mom had stayed in this resort about 5 years ago and really enjoyed it and recommended it to my husband and I. From what she told me about her experience verses mine; this place must have gone downhill fast! We stayed in a one bedroom on the North tower with a view of the Ocean Walk Shops. Our first room had wet carpet in the master bedroom entering into the bathroom. We called the front desk so they could be aware of it and we wouldn't get blamed for it. We didn't think much of it, just thought they might have cleaned the carpet before we arrived. The next day it was still wet and slightly worse. Called again. Finally they sent maintence up to take a look, all they did was put a caution sign on the floor in case we were to slip. My husband and I are usually pretty laid back people, but for the amount of money you pay you deserve a room without wet carpet that soaks your feet everytime you need to use the restroom or shower. Finally another maintance worker came up, told us they have had numerous issues with this room and the front desk should have never rented it out. They finally gave us another room. Another issue was we never had wash rags, asked for those twice finally gave up. Kitchen was missing several items that were in our other room. Rooms were not consistent with anything! I thought the pool area was over crowded, there were never any chairs available and noticed people putting their towels on the chair and not returning for hours. We were forced to pay the $25.00 twice on the beach in order to have a chair to sit in. Everytime we needed an elevator that was a 5-10min wait. For that size of a building four elevators are not enough. One postive note, most staff were friendly and helpful. I would have never chose Daytona Beach in the first place, but was there for a wedding.

<Title>“Loved the Ocean Walk and location”
<Content>I just returned this morning and wanted to pass on my experience. We arrived very early Saturday (April 4th) after driving all night. We knew we probably couldn't get into our room until closer to 2pm (VIP member) and we were right. We spent the morning and early afternoon laying on the beach and enjoying the gorgeous weather. We kept checking to see if our room was done and at 1:45 were finally told that our room wouldn't be ready until sometime after 4pm (we had been "assigned" room 515 in the South Tower since our booking months ago). They quickly relocated us to 527 in the North Tower (corner ocean front unit) so we could move all our stuff in. Upon entering our room, I quickly noticed grey painted footprints in front of the balcony doors and issues with the lamps in the living room. It was obvious that someone had recently painted the balcony, got paint on his shoes and stepped into the condo. You could track his movements turning around to close the balcony doors. I also noticed that the carpet leading from the master bedroom into the bath area had pulled up. This was reported to the front desk and I was informed that the carpet issues couldn't be corrected during my stay. No big deal since we were all adults and could watch our step. The rest of the condo was beautifully decorated with a table in the entranceway, a couch, two chairs, endtables, coffee table, entertainment center and TV in the living room, a dining table with 6 chairs and a eat-in bar attached to the kitchen counter with 3 or 4 more chairs. There was also a VHS player which was kind of funny to me since all other Wyndham resorts have DVD players. Good thing I always travel with our portable DVD player! The master bedroom had a king sized bed, 2 nightstands and a dresser with TV. The bed wasn't a comfortable as mine at home, but I didn't have any trouble sleeping at night! The dresser needs to be replaced though. The master bath had a two sink vanity, standup shower and whirlpool tub with a separate room with the toilet. The second bedroom had two double beds with a night stand between them and a dresser and TV. The rest of the resort was BEAUTIFUL!! I LOVED the colorful "boardwalk" with sun. The streets of Daytona had similar street artwork at all the intersections (fish, shells etc). The accessibility to the beach was WONDERFUL. We never used the pools or hottubs as we spent all our time on the beach. You walked right by the poolside bar (sold drinks and lunches), down the steps to the boardwalk and right onto the beach. The view from our condo was great too each morning and evening looking right over the large expanse of beach. The location of this resort was great too! With the Ocean Walk shops/restaurants etc right there it was easy to get my starbucks addiction satisfied each morning. We ate at Bubba Gumps too but could also walk to many (of varying price) places to eat. Right across the street is the Starlight, just down the road is Burger King and Hog Heaven BBQ (GREAT). We ordered pizza a couple of evenings (a MUST with teenagers). Since there are so many food choices within walking distance, you really didn't have to drive out each night if you didn't want to and after a full day in the sun and sand, that was sure a convenience!

<Title>“Don't take any personal belongings of any value!”
<Content>We had one of our worst vacations in our lifetime at Wyndham Ocean Walk in Daytona Beach and are still paying for the loss we sustained due to our belongings being stolen while we were out golfing! Hotle security handled the loss of our computer, digital camera, blue tooth and meds as routine! They even had a special device to check the card swipe and tell us that no one had accessed our room! Becuase of that, their insurance did not cover one item. They also said that we had an "option" of reporting the theft to the local police. What they neglected to mention was that they had arrested a solicitor earlier in the day, that , as our room was located next to a stair well, we ran in tp three indigents coming up from the stairwell to "solicit", placing their ears on the doors as they went to see who was around. They scooted off when we came out of our room. If you value a safe vacation, I would stay FAR AWAY FROM WYNDHAM OCEAN WALK in Daytona Beach!

<Content>The Oceanwalk is a great place to stay. You park your car and don't have to worry about getting back into it until you leave. Everything you want and need is here. The staff is very polite and professional. The rooms are clean and beyond you normal hotel room. I have bee there 3 times now and would never think about changing hotels at Daytona. Don't Miss this great resort.

<Title>“Wyndham Ocean Walk Resort...An Outstanding Experience!”
<Content>We stayed at the Ocean Walk Resort for 1 week during Spring Break in March. We LOVED the property! The rooms were wonderful--clean and modern, also a lot of room! The staff was very helpful and polite. They seemed genuinely interested in helping us have a great vacation experience. The front desk, concierge, and even maintanence departments all provided excellent service. What a refreshing experience! (We have had some other not so great experiences at Florida resorts and hotels.) We found this to be the perfect location for our family. We were traveling with our kids- age 19 and 20, so the location was perfect. Enough to do, but not much wild stuff going on! Our room was very quiet- no problems whatsoever. We definitely plan to return to Daytona Beach and definitely plan to stay at the Wyndham Ocean Walk Resort again. Our only disappointment was that we couldn't stay longer this time!

<Title>“rude front desk soured the experience”
<Content>first of all it was bike week,we are bikers..we do not drink,fight or cause a ruckus,the front desk treated us like second class citizens everytime we asked for anything..the hotel is awesome for location, close to main street,convention center,eateries. Nice pool, although it is shaded by early afternoon,get sun in the a.m. inadequate parking for large events..they seemed overwhelmed and understaffed with all of the bikers,I think bike week is every year, no excuse for being understaffed..the maintenance staff was very friendly, gave us directions. Not bothered by timeshare sales, nice beachfront, next to Bubba Gump and Johnny Rockets (hamburgers!, chili cheeze fries) when we checked out they actually asked us if we had remembered to strip the bed linens and get all of the towels near the door!! it is listed as a luxury resort...nice place, not luxury only wi-fi is in the lobby

<Title>“Great Place. Stayed Twice!”
<Content>My family and I have stayed there twice and we love it! The rooms are very spacious and have okay furniture. The pool are great, clean, not that crowed but they are not very warm. The mini-golf is great, inside, but can get busy on rainy days and during the evening (but that's a given). The shops are great! There is a movie theater, a few restaurants (Johnny Rockets, Starbucks, and more) surf shops, and stores that your wouldn't find at home. and it is nice because you have to use your room key to get from the beach to the pool so not just anyone can use the pool. It is also just a short walk to the boardwalk. The down side is there are never enough dishes to last two meals (you have to wash after every meal), there aren't remote's in every room but if you call down they will bring you one. The check in is slow and sometimes you have to wait. Others than that it is a very nice great place!

<Title>“Great room, great view, we'll be back!”
<Content>We came during the off season and it was great. Our two-bedroom place was HUGE with a large balcony overlooking the ocean. I'm glad we were here during the off season because it was not crowded at all. No waits for the elevator, no problem getting a chair by the pool and not a single proposition for a timeshare. Those are the three concerns that I read a lot about but they aren't issues in the off season. We enjoyed taking our son for walks along the boardwalk and on the beach. They have an area where kids can play in the lower level which was nice. The staff at the front desk was not very friendly, we never had anyone come by to clean our room or bring us fresh towels which I thought was weird. The screen doors on both our rooms were totally jacked up and didn't open and close properly. Those are all minor issues though. We will definitely come back again...probably when the weather is a bit warmer but still hopefully avoiding the peak season. I imagine it would be pretty crazy around here at peak time. Yesterday almost 75% of the pool chairs were filled even though it's pretty dead around here, those would go in a flash during peak season. I also had continuous wifi in our room which was really nice.

<Title>“Great Hotel - Found Great Deal!”
<Content>We stayed athe the Wyndham Ocean Walk when it was still called the Ocean Walk Resort and LOVED it! Most recently I was in Daytona with friends for spring break and found a great deal through a timeshare website - but I have stayed here under many different circumstances (ie : spring break with college friends, vacation with family and little sister, getaway with my boyfriend) and the hotel accomodated me in every aspect. The rooms are HUGE and clean with all the amenities you could want---including a washer and dryer in the unit which was a huge plus. Full kitchen with all appliances, large bathrooms with tub and glass shower, nice balcony with ocean view. Location is great ...there is a parking ramp if you rent a car or drive, so parking is not an issue. The Ocean Walk is connected to a complex of shops and restaurants and offers many dining choices. We really liked the Maui Nix Surf Shop with some great swim suits and gifts. Bubba Gumps Shrimp was just OK but had a fun atmosphere. There are other shops, ice cream stands, restaurants etc. in the complex and behind this area there is a bandshell. The first time we were there there was a car show in the bandshell (not really our thing)....but the second time there was some type of local band playing -- SUPER fun, dancing, singing, drinking. Great time! We like to walk down the beach to the pier and also ate at the restaurant there once -mediocre food at best, service was not good! but the pier is fun! The hotel has a mix of college kids, businessmen, and LOTS of families! The pool area is great with an awesome lazy river. This is definatley a family friendly resort, complete with a kids club!

<Title>“The Wyndham Ocean Walk; A Complete Package In Daytona”
<Content>We stayed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk for a week of R & R and were very pleased with our stay. Room 1808 is a 1 bedroom suite with a full kitchen, roomy living area, clean, modern bathroom and a king size bed with plenty of closet and drawer space in the bedroom. Our room was very clean with minimal ware or stains and the kitchen was fairly complete for preparing and serving basic fare and also included a washer and dryer stack. The suite's main attraction was the ample ocean front balcony with plenty of space for the two chairs and small table supplied by the hotel. The facilities of the property were well kept and were all any couple or family would need for a very enjoyable stay at the beach. Three pools with a kiddee area and a lazy river and a big twisting slide will keep the kid in all of us busy for a while and the famous beach is right across the the cement "broadwalk" from the pool area. There is also a pool bar and grill as well as 3 large hot tubs and 2 indoor pools. The only drawback we noticed to this area was that the sun tucks behind the building by 1PM and the whole pool area is in the shade the rest of the day. The hotel is adjacent to a 4 level mall/food court arrangement with a movie theater and several chain type restaurants. and across the street there is an amusement park / water park. The hotel's location is also close to other restaurants, super markets, and attractions. The Ocean Walk has everything we needed for a very enjoyable stay and you should consider it for your beach holiday as well.

<Title>“The Best Ever!”
<Content>By means of a bout of good luck (and someone else's last-minute cancellation), we managed to get a room at Ocean Walk during the anniversary of the Daytona 500. We drove all the way from New York and were only staying in Daytona for a couple of days before heading to Orlando. We're Wyndham owners, but we had never been at this resort before. We stayed in a two-bedroom lockoff, and it was fantastic! As soon as we arrived, the staff greeted us warmly and offered us a welcome packet. The packet included race t-shirts, $75 cash, and a dining card, if we agreed to attend an owner's update. The room was beautifully furnished an spacious for our party of eight (my parents, my husband and I, and our four kids). Our room didn't have a great view -- the living room faced the main corridor -- but we were very close to our parking spot and the elevators. The hotel is magnificent, with a lazy river, outdoor and indoor pools, and a children's pool. We used the private beach for a while, but got chilly and went inside. A ride on the elevator down to the second level took us to the Boardwalk shops -- dozens of stores, restaurants, and a movie theater! The resort is convenientl located along a strip that has many stores and restaurants; we walked to the 24-hr Walgreens. The racetrack is only a few minutes away, as are other restaurants, like Friendly's and Red Lobster. The owner's update was a sales pitch, but the staff wasn't pushy at all. I definitely recommend this resort to anyone staying in the Daytona area. The rooms are beautiful, roomy, and quiet, but there's plenty to do both in the resort and out. Couples, groups, families, and singles looking for a nice place to stay will love it!

<Title>“Great Resort but 1st Week Dec is the wrong time to visit Daytona Beach”
<Content>This was our first exchange with RCI, and though we have nothing negative to say about the resort, we would like to point out that the Daytona Beach area is extreamly quiet in the first week of December. This may be appealing to some visitors, but to us it left the place lacking in atmosphere and character. The beach was pleasant, though quiet again. Beach loungers were available to hire on the warmest days. I would have hoped that the hotel would provide these free of charge for guests, but the hire charge was only $8 per day. There is a large range of restaurants near by...you will need a car to get to them. The best dining experience we had was at the Chart House (10 minute drive from hotel). The views of the Halifax river were ok, but the food was outstanding and if you make a resevation through the Hotel you get a complementary dessert. Do not go to 'Fresh' the hotels second choice, the food was below standard. Overall a great place to stay.

<Title>“Things to consider ....”
<Content>My husband and I booked our trip through the website VRBO. The price for our ocean side unit was a good deal and the condo contained all of the comforts of home. However, when we exited our room into the hallway, you could hear the rumble from the first floor lobby area where Wyndham employees were constantly trying to push timeshare sales. In the check-in area, there where timeshare owners wearing t-shirts which read, "I made a big mistake by buying here, it's cheaper to rent." and passing out flyers with additional details of their lawsuit. We also saw people walking around outside with protest signs which read, "Timeshares are a rip off!!". In addition, while walking around the Ocean Walk shops, were were stopped a several times by outside sales people trying to talk us into a timeshare presentation for a $100 or hotel stay. While we loved the property and our actual condo, the disgruntled timeshare owners makes one second guess staying at OceanWalk Resort. It's not the atmosphere that I would choose for a vacation or for a romantic get-a-way.

<Title>“Great Family Resort!”
<Content>My wife and I just returned from the Wyndham Ocean Walk. Unfortunately, the weather in Daytona was not cooperative- it was in the low 60's all weekend. However, we got an opportunity to walk around the property to see what the Wyndham had to offer. Let me be the first to tell you- if you have a family with children, this is THE place to stay. The pool is divided into different sections. They have a lazy river, a kid's water slide, kids play area, and a regular pool. They also have an indoor pool and schedule lots of activities throughout the day for guests and kids. On Saturday night, we walked by the pool and saw they were showing a movie at the indoor pool! There is a game room, computer room, and kids craft room. We were not able to locate a restaurant within the hotel. Either we didn't find it, or they don't have one. My wife and I stayed in a 1 bedroom room. There was plenty of space with a full kitchen. It would have been nice if we had an oceanview room, but we were okay with the view of the Daytona strip. There were two things that were "red flags" about the Wyndham: 1) The elevators kept breaking down! Fortunately we weren't inside one when it happened! 2) There were people in the lobby wearing shirts that said "I made a HUGE mistake BUYING here, it would be cheaper to RENT." Obviously the Wyndham sells timeshares. But, seeing those people in the lobby was somewhat of an annoyance (in my opinion). Overall, we definitely look forward to going back to the Wyndham. We're hoping to return in May when it's warmer!

<Title>“Great location for Biketoberfest!!”
<Content>This is the second time, in four years, we have stayed at Ocean Walk, and it was just as great as it was last time we were there. We attended Biketoberfest 2008 from October 12th-19th. We are RCI members and always enjoy the full accommodations we get when we book through them. Pros: Beautiful views, large pools, lazy river, quick access to beach, poolside bar, indoor lobby bar, large spacious rooms, quick access to ocean walk village and boardwalk, quick walk to Main Street. Cons: Construction on North Tower during sunbathing hours, garbage chute, some of the units need to be updated, pool bar needs to serve food later. Overall we had a great time, and would recommend this place to everyone! Just make sure you get a balcony, some units are located on the interior and you will not have access to ocean or street views.

<Title>“Would Stay Again”
<Content>Our daughter had a beach wedding in Daytona Beach in September. We had friends who were generous enough to let us buy a week of time, points, or whatever you call it in a time share system. We were very impressed with the place. CONS: Everywhere you turn you are propositioned to attend tiimeshare sales pitches. Depending on your position you may want to consider it. We were offered $80 in dinner funds. We weren't buying, shopped at the local Publix grocery store (excellent!), and didn't want to spend the time, so we declined. Our room, though v ery nice, was in an interior hallway which was really weird because the only two windows (living area and bedroom) in the place overlooked an interior hallway, which meant anyone walking past could look at you like a zoo exhibit. The draw shades were light-proof, and we kept them down the entirety of our stay. We had no natural light when we were in the room. The view from the hallway was of the Halifax river and what we though may be downtown Daytona. Nice view, but it was a weird environment, as such. If you can do so, book an oceanfront room. The couch bed in our room was really filthy from food stains. We covered it with the extra blanket and sheets in the room in order to sit on it.. We reported this to the hotel. The sign on the outside hot tub says something like "children under 12 are permitted with supervision." Supervision for some parents is if you are within one-quarter mile. We thought there should be a ban on children in the hot tub altogether. We left twice because of the little rugrats (we raised ours, and don't care to have to watch those of strangers). The resort apparently does not recycle. We're not tree huggers, but we have recycled for years, and I cringed every time I had to put glass and plastics with the rest of the trash into the trash chute. But hey, that's just me The weekend we were there, there was a large adolescent youth group staying there. They held the elevators open, which were usually not a problem as far as waiting, were shreiking in only the pitch that adolescent girls can achieve, took over the pool/hot tub area in the evening, and pretty much stole one night of relaxation from us. This was a disappointment that the resort would rent to such a gaggle of hormonal youth, but they did. We didn't see an adult with these kids. We were glad to hear so many other guests express their dismay with this group, as we thought we may be the only ones. Even the lobby/bar area wasn't exempt from the noise of this group. It took an evening from us. We were not happy. PROS: **THE SERVICE IS EXCELLENT** One of the high points I found, was that I was willing to look foolish enough to walk through the interior hall with my laptop computer on and found a wireless internet access about 20 yards from our room, which was a **MAJOR BONUS* * iff you were willing to stand at a window with your computer. I was. Internet access is available in the lobby, but if you want to search for it, you may find it closer to your room. We had a few problems with our room: The TV in the living/sitting area didn't work. Two lamps in sitting area didn't work. We called, and within 90 minutes this was taken care of. Problems may be considered a "con," but the time it took to fix them put them in the "pro" category. One evening at 12:30 a.m. we realized our air conditioning quit working. A call to the front desk (they asked if we wanted it now or if we were willing to wait until the morning.... it was Florida, we weren't!) brought a maintenance staffer to our room in less than an hour, and the problem was fixed. We were quite impressed. The fact that the resort issues beach towels is a plus for guests who are flying to this destination, as they are heavy in a suitcase. There is an inside lobby with a bar that offers different theme evenings for those that imbibe, or just like a good time. There was a wine and cheese evening, a martini evening, and a karaoke evening for all you singers. If you enjoying socializing, this is a great venue. There was never a search for beach chairs. There were always unused beach chairs, and tables and chairs. If you're willing to pay the price, there is a restaurant/store in the lobby area that has *great* pizza, and good food, beer and wine available to purchase, along with just about anything else you might need, such as suntan lotions and a smattering of souveniers and clothing. I can't speak for all the beds in all the units, but we had a king size pillow top mattress that compared to our home mattress, which was so very comfortable. Not that we're willing to buy into timeshare, but if we were we wouldn't think twice about this one. Thinking about staying here? Go for it!

<Title>“Great Stay”
<Content>I enjoyed the resort along with my mother and 10 year old niece. It was a straight shot from the airport to the resort. I booked through Wyndham since I'm an owner and was very pleased. There were computer rooms for adults and kids as well as indoor miniture golf, indoor pool and activity center. The resort has a place where they sell breakfast, lunch & dinner; however it's not a restaurant. We found a grocery store nearby since we cooked to save money. We only had two days of sun since we arrived the week of hurricane faye. I must say the elevators were slow even though there are four on the north and south tower. We had a three bedroom which was plenty of room. Our flight was cancelled because of the storm so wyndham accomadated us to a one bedroom in the south tower for one more night.

<Title>“Weeklong stay booked through RCI”
<Content>We stayed at this resort from 09/05/08-09/11/08. We booked a condo rental through RCI for about $300 (through the military vacation packages). We arrived near midnight (left home late) and their front desk was open and very helpful. We were told to go by the customer service desk after 9am to pick up our wristbands for the pool and our "welcome gift". Of course we knew we would be hit up for buying a timeshare after reading the other reviews but we needed the wristbands, so we went. The staff was deceptive in trying to get us into their timeshare presentations, saying it was a "survey" to get our feedback. My husband told them he might or might not be available but they signed him up anyway. We got a free totebag and frisbee but never went to their presentation. Staff seemed overly pushy to sell timeshares and we even heard one griping to another about someone not buying one when we passed him in the hall, but after check-in we didn't have any issues with being pressed to buy a timeshare. Other than that, this place is top notch! Parking was great - there is a parking garage with easy access to the elevators. Luggage carts are few and far between but we carried our own luggage anyway. The room was impeccable - we had room 1915 which is a condo on the top floor corner. It had a master bed, 2 guest beds and a couch with a pull out bed. We had a few minor inconveniences (like the accordion door coming off on the pantry, and the light in the guest bedroom was out but we didn't use that room anyway). Other than those few minor things, it was great. It had a huge jacuzzi tub, 2 TVs, balcony with a beach view (which was not locked by the way - it looks like their outside renovations are complete). We had everything we needed - paper towels, dish soaps, pots and pans, dishes, vacuum - everything was provided. Downstairs they have a fitness center that looked nice, but I was disappointed to find all the treadmills occupied in the morning so I ran on the beach instead. There is an indoor pool which I saw only about 2 people in the entire time. There's a computer area with WIFI (no interenet connections in the rooms - BOO!!!). There was a nice looking childrens area where they can do crafts. They have activities which we didn't try, but heard someone complaining on the elevator that Bingo was only for timeshare owners, so be aware of that. We didn't swim in the outdoor pools but they looked very nice (if only a little dirty on the bottom at times, as seen from our balcony). We floated in the lazy river almost daily and it was nice. There is security everywhere (in front of the hotel and in the pool area) so we felt safe at all times. Be aware that there is a large entertainment area with stage right outside near the beach on what appears to be separate property. They had a loud concert on Saturday night until about 10 pm - it would be a problem for early sleepers on a lower floor (we could hear it all the way up on the 19th floor). There is a small "shopping" area attached that has a Quizno's and Coldstone Creamery but it's not good for much else. You can walk right out to it from the 4th floor. There's also a spa but we didn't try it. Overall we had a great time and I would definitely visit this hotel again.

<Title>“Great place to stay in Daytona!”
<Content>Originally was hesitant to book this place by the reviews but someone from this site recommended it and we're glad we listened. We were a family of 5 and the rooms at Ocean walk had plenty of room for all of us. We have three daughters ages 15, 13 and 9 who all want to go back. First of all, the staff was very friendly and helpful from the moment we drove up to the front door. The room had a bedroom, living room, full kitchen and bathroom and washer/dryer. We had an oceanfront balcony and were even able to watch the fireworks from there. The rooms were very clean and modern, although the carpet was ripping between the bedroom and bathroom. The hotel was in a perfect location on the quiet part of the beach near the shopping, restaurants and movie theater. The lobby was nice as was the pools, although the lazy river was not open when we were there. However, we had no problem getting five lounge chairs and we were not up at the crack of dawn to get them. I would not hesitate to stay here again if we go back to Daytona, and I am pretty picky about where we stay on vacation.

<Title>“Somewhat disappointed”
<Content>Rooms were clean, staff nice, but pool area was very disappointing. Main reason for choosing this hotel was for the slide and lazy river (kids), however the slide was only operational for about 1 hour during our 4 day stay. When we asked the front desk about the slide being repaired we were told that it was on the schedule, but they were unsure of the completion date. The Lazy River was operational during stay, but we as well as others noticed that there was alot of debri/trash (not just a little bit) at the entrance of river. We never noticed anyone trying to keep area clean with pool skimmer. Another thing that was disappointing around the pool area was the weeds growing among the landscape. In the pots that lined the lazy river there were weeds that were almost as tall as the bannanna trees....don't mean to be picky, but we were expecting more from this resort. Not impressed at all.

<Title>“Crowded and sleazy”
<Content>The best thing about this place was the inside of the condo - I have to admit that. It was a nice 2 bedroom overlooking the ocean with a balcony. Nice and clean. We rented it directly from an owner - DO NOT rent through the "front desk" - believe me. It's a time-share related booking and you'll be hassled. First - the worst problem. THE ELEVATORS! This condo has 25 floors and NOT ENOUGH elevators. You will wind up waiting through 3 and 4 sets of elevators just to get to your room and doing this day in and day out will drive you crazy. When you finally catch an elevator, be prepared to squeeze in with wet, smelly beach-goers and LOTS of kids. Next problem. The pool. The pool area is an absolute mad house - crowded, not enough chairs, not that clean, noisy - total chaos all the time. Next problem - the neighborhood. I knew Daytona was a little sketchy, but I did not expect this level of sleaze. You'll share restaurants and walks with bums and faux-bikers and roving gangs of teenagers. Be aware. Lastly - I have no way to put this delicately - the guests at this condo were.....let's say that all of them looked like they drove a beat-up pickup truck, chain smoked, drank warm beer from a can and have never had to make reservations at a restaurant. It's a very rough crowd to say the least. So....if it's sun and sand you are looking for, you can find more peaceful, cultured places to go very easily. Skip this place - it was not worth the money.

<Title>“Pretty flippin' sweet place to stay...”
<Content>I actually found our one bedroom suite on Daytona's Craigslist. I got it from tsadventure.com (The Blea Family). Everything went just as planned with the reservation and it was such a GREAT DEAL! One of my main concerns was the issues I'd read about the elevators. I'm a pretty impatient person and my husband is even worse, but it was only bad (but still just maybe 5 minutes) when the storms rolled in and everyone went back to their rooms. All the staff were great! Have a look at the display just outside the conciege for some good coupons to local places. Our room was nice and clean. We didn't have an ocean view, but for the price we didn't need one! It was kinda weird though having two windows in the room and they looked out into the hallway. People coulda totally peaked in through the cracks in the blinds if they were so inclined! I never noticed an issue with there not being enough poolside chairs, but we also went to the pool in the late afternoon. The kid's area is awesome for kids, my two young ones loved it! They also loved the lazy river and the slide. We didn't go to any of the restaurants at Ocean Walk, but I did go to the Starbucks (being an addict of it and all) and only got 2 outta 5 drinks right. That was not so awesome. Overall, we had a great time at Ocean Walk! I have TWO PIECES OF ADVICE..... 1. If you leave the parking garage, you better be back before the dinner crowd gets back....otherwise you'll be pressed for a space. We had to go to the other tower to find a space on two nights and had to go all the way to the top! It took FOREVER! 2. EAT AT BOONDOCKS! It's down A-1 headed towards Daytona Shores. You'll turn on right on "Mallard" and it's somewhere back there. I LOVE this place. We go everytime we go to Daytona. It's not real touristy so it's not way packed with a HUGE wait. I would definitely stay at Ocean Walk again!

<Title>“to crowded”
<Content>forget about getting in the lazy river, hotel is to large for such a small lazy river was there for over a week and wasnt able to get in it one time. If you want a chair or lounger around the pool you can forget it also unless you get up about 6 am and take your towels out to hold for you. booked 8 months in advanced asked for oceanfront and got ocean view by the movies and stores and the smell was so bad could never go out on the balcony. We were called every morning asking us to please come and do a 90 minute tour which always ends up to be about 3 hours. Will never stay there again not worth it.

<Title>“Great experience”
<Content>We stayed in a two bedroom, two bathroom condo at the Wyndham Ocean Walk from July 12-19, 2008. It was my husband and I, another couple and their son. We were thrilled to find a balcony overlooking the ocean when we walked in. We were a little worried after reading some of the reviews on Trip Advisor. We really didn't have any problems with the elevators or the property itself. The only time the elevators were really slow was when kids had been in there and pushed every button. That only happened a couple of times the whole week. The security guards told us they were evicting people when they found out which kids were doing it. We were never bothered by anyone trying to get us to buy a timeshare. The concierge was GREAT!!! Caroline and Georgia helped us with directions, coupons, and anything else we asked about. I noticed that there were plenty of activities for young children. The whole place was very clean and everyone was friendly. We loved being within walking distance to shops, eating, etc. We had a great experience at Ocean Walk and would recommend it to anyone.

<Title>“As Great as they claimed it was...really.”
<Content>I was a little wary of booking this on-line and not getting what we paid for. I was wrong. This was everything we expected and more. Clean, modern rooms with tons of space, professional and courteous staff, right in the middle of all the Daytona action, yet our rooms were quiet and very cool when we needed to 'chill out'. I was concerned about too much heat (hi 80's and lo 90's when were here), but it was cool breezes and awesome AC that kept us sane. A large variety of restaurants/bars are all within walking distance - I would avoid the hotel bars as they are way overpriced ($9 drinks and $4.50 for can of Miller...puhlease). Other reviews pan the elevator service here, and while it was not perfect, it was fine.. the waits were not too long (1 to 3 mins) and many times there was no wait at all. The concierge desk folks we're all very helpful and pleasant to deal with. If you can bring your own umbrellas and chairs, you'll need them and save $25/day in rentals. We will be back to this spot, two teens met a lot of new friends, had a safe and cool place to hangout and also had a great time. Minor suggestions: fix the pool hot tub jets so they all work, and fix that slamming pool gate!

<Title>“Great Time - Great Vacation - Great Resort”
<Content>We just returned from our vacation staying at the Ocean Walk Resort from July 12-19, 2008. We were housed in the South tower on the seventh floor in Unit # 708. I can honestly say it was one of the nicest places my wife, kids, and I have ever stayed at. The owner of the condo (who I booked the reservation with directly) was unbelievably responsive to any emails or phone calls leading up to the trip, and her description of the resort and the condo unit were dead-on accurate. The Unit was clean, smelled nice, was tastefully decorated, and had an wonderful view of the resort and the ocean from the balcony. The kitchen was fully equipped and extremely clean. The beds were comfortable and the cable television had almost 100 channels to choose from. The check-in was simple, the staff was nice and polite, the bar staff were very friendly, the parking garage was easy to navigate, the internet rooms and the weightroom were very nice. The pool temperature was perfect, there was always pool chairs to be had, the beer was cold at the Turtles Nest, and the security staff was friendly and always handy if you needed them. My kids absolutely loved the waterslides and the play park in the kiddie pool. Napoli's pizza place across the street was delicious, the Daytona Lagoon arcade was a nice way to spend a couple of hours, and the weather was great. This was absolutely the best vacation we have had in the United States - and rivals a few trips outside of the States. I would recommend the owner of unit #708 to anyone, anytime.......

<Title>“Great Vacation”
<Content>Stayed in a 2 bedroom with fairly good ocean view, right over Ocean Walk. Room was nice, but don't expect any room service as there is none. Units come with washer/dryer which is a huge plus, but you will need to wash your own sheets/towls, etc. Other than the very slow elevators, and yucky hotel food, blah! our experiance was terrific. Close to everything, beach was a blast and lots of stuff to do. Lazy river is very cool. Staff was friendly and helpful. Looking forward to our next stay here.

<Title>“Instead of renovating Balconies add elevators”
<Content>Wyndhym Ocean Walk itself is fabulous. Beautiful room, Great pools, ocean front, restaurants connected, nice employees but it's having growing pains. The elevator situation is a hassle. Four elevators for 26 flours with 30 some odd rooms on each floor is not enough. That's the North Tower, South has it's own issues with timeshare sales and access to Boardwalk Shops.When we were there, weather closed not only the pools but the beach as well, and the line for elevators was scary. We walked up 12 floors with pool chairs and cooler rather then wait. Our neighbor told us she waited over 20 minutes to go up! Wyndhym is trying to get a handle on "guests" who are not guests using the pool areas which is very nice. This led to some confusion as to what we needed to come back from the beach. You need a room key and a band. Pool chairs are all claimed early by phantom guests who stake out and leave. In the height of the storm, belongings were still left out and were there later in the day. The pool deck itself was not well maintained by guests or hotel personel. Cigarettes stubbed out under chairs and drink cups and garbage was not removed until morning. It made me sad , because it is a beautiful hotel. We had the same problem on our floor. Instead of using the garbage shoot , people would pitch their trash into the room and leave. When I called to complain, personal cleaned up, but it would happen again the next day. I think if they gave the information upfront, it would help. We had a three bedroom deluxe ocean front and it was nice, spacious, but not maintained. Broken drawers, broken dishwasher, not power in the master bath area, but front desk was nice and offered to fix everything. we were fine with things as was, but if you were staying a week it could have been a hassle. The rooms were very comfotable, with ceiling fans and nice linens. Good showers and more than enough towels. Bottom line,Enjoy, and remember, as two ladies reminded me in the elevator, as we were stuck between floors, you're on vacation, relax.

<Title>“Loved Wyndham Ocean Walk”
<Content>We have been owers with Fairfield/Wyndham for more than 8 years. This was our first stay at Ocean Walk. Frankly after reading some of the reviews, we were a little nervous about what we would find when we got there. Being timeshare owners we knew in advance this is a condo environment and did not expect maid service or trash removal like in a hotel environment. Our check-in process was a breeze and the staff couldn't have been more polite. We arrived early and our unit was ready and we were able to check in about 3 hours early. We were in a great 2 bedroom unit which was huge and the view amazing. It was clean, well stocked and everything in working order. We moved our car only a handful of times during the week because everything is right there to include restaurants, movies, shopping, ice cream, pizza, etc. The pools can be a little crowded like most resorts but you always have the beach and access is right there. This resort has something for everyone, young and old, couples or families.

<Title>“Going Downhill”
<Content>Have stayed at this resort several times, but this time was the absolute worst. If you stay, be sure and request a room numbered less than _15. We were in south tower on sixth floor in _16. The only thing we could view was the roof and side of the Ocean Walk Village. The roof of the building was covered with garbage and the stench was horrible. The furniture is becoming dilapidated, the drawers in the chest would not close, the table in the living room was scratched all over, the sofa was dirty. I had previously read in your reviews that pool security would remove items left unattended for more than 30 minutes, but never saw this happen. At 8 am pool chairs were taken and the same towels were there for the entire day, although we never saw a person using them. Due to the stench, I asked if another room were available, but told there was not. The desk staff stated that rooms were assigned at check in; however I saw others checking in after me who received better locations. The first time we stayed at this resort, it was nice and new, but nothing has been done as far as upkeep. The timeshare people were persistent and I even received a call from another service (not Wyndham) who wanted to tell me why not to buy a timeshare. I would seriously have second thoughts about staying at this resort again.

<Title>“Just love this resort!”
<Content>We have been going to this resort since the year my daughter was born (2004) every year. We absolutly LOVE this place. The rooms are like an actual apartment with everything you need. No dirty clothes to take home, you can cook and wash dishes with the convience just like home. This property offers a lot of things from vacation therpy spa which is great...Fitness center which we haven't used, computer room, activitys for kids most of the day. The pool inside I wish they would turn the heat up on the water. It was pretty chilly. I also wish they had a hot tub indoors because the last 3 years we have been there we didn't use hot tubs as there were nothing but a bunch of teenagers in it goofing until they closed down for the night. I think Adults should be able to swim and be in hottub at own risk of course, after hours. Us adults are unable to enjoy these amenitys when there are teens around goofing off and the pools are packed with splashing children and so on. Don't get me wrong I have children as well but it would be great to be able to go out late at night for a nice, QUIET swim. They could also use a few more elevators at the size of this place there should be 8 instead of 4. Elevator wait time at times is horriable. Even with the few things I may have complained about I LOVE this place & go every year. I come home & brag to my friends about what a wonderful place this is and have taken a few friends with us each year. OCEANFRONT is the only way to go..Beautiful view! Were going back in 3 weeks for this years vacation!!

<Title>“Nice except for smokers”
<Content>Other reviews cover it pretty well. Nice location and convenience to restaurants and movie theatres was nice. Our biggest problem is that our reservation said something to the effect of no smoking in the rooms; however, per the front desk, that is just voluntary and not enforced. Our room stunk badly and they would not or could not move us. They did provide an ionizer that helped some, but even when we got home and after clothes had been washed, we could still smell it. We normally use Marriott for traveling and timeshare, and I guess we have gotten used to their non-smoking policy in all hotels. Other issue is the mad rush to get chairs at the pool. I am an early riser and got them, but did not enjoy having to stand in a line until 8:15, then actually run/race with others to get chairs where we wanted them. Many people came and saved chairs, went to their rooms and then did not reappear for many hours. Deal - I rented a 1 BR deluxe off ebay for $399 for 4 nights, which was a great deal. Check that out before you make your reservation elsewhere.

Would only rent oceanfront, other views are not nearly as nice. Negative views are: #1 Elevators! Not nearly enough, wait time was awful at times, walked stairs instead of waiting! #2 Security Staff at pool entrances were rather rude during the entire stay. Guess they forgot who pays their salary. Other than listed items was a good experience.

<Title>“Wyndham Ocean Walk”
<Content>Wonderful location - close to EVERYTHING! The pool area was very crowded and you had to get there early to find a seat. The lazy river was great! When we first checked in our room was supposed to be an ocean view... there was a great view of the roof and a wall and if you stretched to the corner of the window you could see the ocean. I immediately went to the desk. I was placed in a much better room but with a city view, which was not bad and the room upgrade made up for it. The resort had a big problem with the elevators (north tower)- 2 of the four were out of service. Waiting lasted up to 30 minutes to get an elevator. They were repaired the next day but again the waits were up to 15 minutes during "rush hours". Overall the staff was attentive and welcomed us... the concierge was very helpful and had super discounts to the events around town - saved a bundle of money for the six of us! Short of the elevator situation we had a great time!!

<Title>“Great property for families!”
<Content>We loved this property! We stayed three nights in June 2008 - a two bedroom unit in the north tower booked directly through the Ocean Walk website. The unit was very spacious - HUGE bedrooms and bathrooms that easily accomodated our family of seven. The unit had a full kitchen and a nice big dining table, three tv's, plenty of room throughout. Everything was very clean and the one issue of no linens for the sofa bed was remedied very promptly. The staff were great from the beginning to the end. Brigette checked us in and was very friendly. She invited us to the timeshare seminar but wasn't pushy at all. The staff at the activities desk were also very friendly. Be sure to go to the concierge and get discounted tickets for everything, even some free tickets for miniture golf and the skyride at the pier. Lobby areas are very attractive and we didn't experience the elevator problems or other difficulties that others have cited. The pools were great, especially since that was what really drew us to this property. The kiddie pool was closed for what looked like serious maintenance when we arrived, but we were pleasantly surprised to find it open on the second day. The pool decks were crowded and chairs were hard to come by, but we spent most of our time swimming anyway, so we didn't really care that chairs weren't available. Drinks at the poolside bar were pricey, but no restrictions on bringing your own from your room. The poolside bar even had cups available for you so that you didn't bring glass poolside! Having restaurants within walking distance was great - we didn't move our car for three days! We walked to the pier, the boardwalk (what is left of it anyway), the arcade/mini golf/ waterpark across the street, and the shopping/dining area next door. Dining at Bubba Gumps gets very crowded, but the other seafood place around the corner had no crowd at all and was a decent alternative. Enjoy!

<Title>“Hmmm its getting questionable!!”
<Content>We just returned from our 10th year at this resort we go every year the middle of June for a week. I think next year we will definitely be looking at a different location. We always stay in the North tower (newer tower, the South tower is beat down). The unit was very nice but really needs a maintenance overhaul, I had to call several times about the dishwasher slamming down and not stay closed it still had not been fixed when we left. The bedding has been around for years and definitely needs to be updated, the cleanliness is top notch though. The elevators are a major issue and the pool area is very discouraging unless you are up and "saving" a chair by 8am you are left to wander around hoping to find a place to sit down. The security this year was very noticeable and needed, I know in past years people not staying at the hotel were wandering into the pool and outside bar area. They really need to do something about people saving the poolside chairs and not using them other then for some place to put their towels. I also saw an altercation at the pool area that was oncalled for, it used to be a nice family place but the drinking and beligerant guests are making it less family like. We get a 2 bedroom oceanfront corner unit for 1100 for the week and its a great deal but next year I think we may be checking out the Wyndam in Myrtle Beach, its new and hopefully operates differently.

<Title>“Love the oceanfront view but the resort could be better”
<Content>I stayed 5 nights for a business trip. Check in was very slow – apparently a lot of guests check in at 4:00. An hour later there was no line at all. The unit was roomy and comfortable, with a balcony and great view of the ocean. The first night I got up to go to the restroom and noticed someone sleeping in the hallway in front of my door. The elevators were slow so I sometimes took the stairs. The same trash that I noticed the first day in the stairwells was still there 5 days later. My room had a few problems, but a couple of calls to engineering eventually got them taken care of. The lack of maid service is a big knock against the resort. Who wants to take out their own trash and wash there own dishes away from home? I paid about $139 per night, plus taxes. If I had to pay for that instead of my company, I would probably complain about the price. Overall, I enjoyed my stay but it could have been better.

<Title>“Worst Hotel Ever”
<Content>I will never stay here again. Two of the four elevators were broken for most of our stay (not that four was enough to handle the volume of people staying here) which created long waitlines for the elevators, or caused guests to walk 10+ flights rather than wait. The security personnel were rude, as were the timeshare "pushers". There is no wireless internet access in the rooms, although much cheaper hotels nearby all offer this service. Additionally, there is no maid service for the rooms, meaning if you want your towels or sheets washed, you must do it yourself.

<Title>“NEVER WILL RETURN”
<Content>Very disappointed for the money you spend. We paid for Oceanfront, didn't get it. Hour wait on the check-in, almost an hour wait on the elevators because only two of the four were working in a 25 story building. And only two were working for 3 days. Some of our party had to walk up 20+ flights of stairs. When we didn't have the kids we would walk down instead of waiting over 20 mins for the elevators. We had a non working dishwasher, coffee maker, and toaster. If you have two vehicles you have to park one across the street at $10 per day. The beach towels provider and the room towels provided have to keep during your stay and you are responsible for washing them at your own expense after the first two boxes( 2 loads) provided. It was our first trip there and our last.

<Title>“Ocean Walk Okay Time”
<Content>We booked Ocean Walk through Redweek.com with an owner of Wyndham. He gave us a great deal for OW. We stayed for 4 nights and 5days. Arriving on June1 at 3:30 the wait for check in was about 30 minutes. Our reservations were for a oceanview which we did not get. I talked to the supervisor but they would not move us. Our view was of a parking lot which was very disappointing. Not to let that ruin the last of our vacation we just left the curtians closed. Be sure to confirm your OW view before you arrive so you wont be disappointed. On a happy note the room it self was nice and clean. Freshly painted and a well stocked applianced kitchen. Our bedroom and bath were large and roomy. The pool area was nice. Be sure to secure a beachchair by 9:00am. Do not leave your towels for long,the security, police the chairs around 9:45 and they leave a warning if you do not show up again within 15min. they will remove your towels. We saw some ticked off people. It is just to discourage people from claiming all the chairs by the pools early and not showing up for hours. The beach area was neat. Two chairs and Umbrella was $25 for the day. Well worth it but they pick them up at 5:00. I would have enjoyed them to at least 6:00. The OW mall was smaller then anticipated. Bubba Gump's for fried shrimp poboy's were great. They have a long wait so go early. The Daytona area could use a little facelift. If has become a little run down. The highlight of Daytona was the tour of the Daytona RaceTrack.

<Title>“Beware of the 5th Floor”
<Content>Okay - I'll take some of the blame. Purchased my week via Ebay. I was really nervous that I'd get a "cityview" balcony, but resolved that I could live with it. My husband and I have two little girls and my vacation is from about 6:30am-7am with a cup of coffee on the balcony. THAT is why I save all my hard-earned money over the year - to give the kids a great week and have a little mom-time on the balcony in the morning with my cup of joe. So we get to the hotel where I've booked a 2-bedroom suite. My worst fear - no balcony at all. If you get the fifth floor - #516 or higher, you will have no balcony, further, no opening windows. Your view will be the top of the OceanWalk shopping center and trash (including beer bottles and cigarette butts) from the balconies above you. It's hideous. Wyndham and OceanWalk would be better off taking all of those units out of service and turning them into offices or the timeshare area. Those units are probably the bain of the front desk manager's existence. Every other person in those units griped to the front desk - all were told they couldn't be moved. We even offered to downgrade our room to a 1BR to get out of that 2-BR suite. Wyndham needs to understand that people are spending big money to travel. As we all get strapped from every end of our budget, we demand better value for our precious travel dollar. If I spend thousands for a week in Florida, I better at least have windows that open. OceanWalk was nice in almost every other way. The kids loved the pools, the beach and the kids area in the basement. We had overall good service - there were some glitches. But I'll never go back to a place where they don't understand that no one wants to spend a week in a hotel without windows that open and looking at cigarette butts.

<Title>“Come back Fairfield!!!!!!!!!!”
<Content>Just got back from a 3 night stay at OceanWalk.....very disappointed in the service that Wyndham provided. We stayed here before when it was owned and operated by Fairfield and had a great time with excellent service. This time was terrible, as far as service goes. First of all, when I booked the room (we had a large 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit) I asked specifically about the balcony situation because I was told by someone that their balconies were being worked on and that I might have a locked out balcony. The man on the phone became very rude, and I said, well, I might have to cancel the reservation and go somewhere that appreciates my business, he said "that's your prerogative". Poor attitude. Anyways, we decided to take the chance and keep the booking. When we arrived, I had to stand in 3 different lines to check in. They kept asking me how I booked it (internet, phone, etc.) Each time, I told them, I booked it through your reservation phone line. They kept telling me to go to a different line. After standing in line for 30 minutes, our room wasn't ready, so they gave us our wrist bands and off to the pool we went. We went to pick up our towels and were told that we only get 1 towel per person for the entire stay. Yep, that's right, no fresh towels after a long day of sunscreen and sand. We have to wash them ourselves in our unit if we want them to be clean. With Fairfield, we got to pick up fresh towels each morning. We went back 3 times to check and see if our room was ready. Finally, it was ready. When we get up there (20th floor) the maids are still in there cleaning. So, we wait for 30 minutes until they are finished. Then we leave for dinner and we come back and we are locked out of the room. We call downstairs to get security up there to let us in. We have a 3 year old and a 6 year old who have to use the restroom. We wait 25 minutes for them to come up and let us in and then the guy tells us we have to go back downstairs to get new keys made. Well, guess what, 2 out of the 4 elevators in our tower are broken. So, it literally takes 20 minutes to go down stairs and 20 minutes to come back up!!! People were cramming into these elevators, making alarms go off and people screaming at each other b/c it is overcrowded. Crazy. There was a fight that broke out in front of my 2 children on the elevator. Nothing was done about the elevator problem for 2 DAYS and the hotel was sold out!!! That is unacceptable to me. The next day we wake up to a beautiful GREEN pool. Disgusting. It was roped off and closed for 24 hours while they poured a thousand gallons of chlorine in the pool. The other pool was also disgusting. Bandaids, hair, snot, you name it, was floating around. I never did see anyone cleaning the pools and I was up late and up early. So, when the green pool was closed, you can imagine how crazy busy the other pool was. We go to complain about all of our poor service and guess what, we were given 2 complimentary breakfasts just like one of the pp stated. We went to use the complimentary breakfasts this morning on the day of checkout, you got it, no breakfast during the week. No one told us this, so again, we went to complain and we were told that a manager would call us ASAP. No call so far. Only good thing was that the room was nice and quiet, it was clean, and the rate was good. Don't think we will be back though until Wyndham gets into Fairfield shape!

<Title>“Terrible customer service”
<Content>We had problems from the time we checked in. The person checking us in had to ask for help to complete the process, which took much longer than it needed to. It was a hot day and when we got to our room the AC was off. We later discovered it didn't work at all. The ceiling fan and balcony door lock also didn't work. Two hours after our call about the AC they finally sent someone to fix it. The room didn't cool down until the next morning, however, and we had a very uncomfortable night. The next morning we went ot the beech. When we returned we were locked out of our room. Accodring to the front desk our keys were only programmed for one day at check in. SInce we didn't have IDs on us at the beach, it was an ordeal to get new keys and get back into our room. That evening we got locked out again as our keys had been deactivated due to another front desk mix up. The next day we discovered that we also needed passes for the pool and parking garage, which should have been given to us at check in along with other resort information. After complaining about all of the problems they offered us free breakfast for the remainder of our stay (Monday - Wednesday). When we went for breakfast Monday morning we were told it is only available Saturday and Sunday. After explaining my dissatisfaction to two different managers I was asked to meet with a third individual to explain my problems. I was told she would be right with me. She never showed up. I finally decided complaining was useless and to avoid using Wyndham facilities in the future.

<Title>“Left Much to be Desired”
<Content>My husband and I took my 4 year old son and my 79 year old mother in May of this year. When I arrived I was impressed with the look of the lobby - that was soon replaced with disappointment when we reached the room. The sliders that led to the balcony had no lock on it so my 4 year could have gotten up and out in the middle of the night. The room was not clean. The sofa cushions were ripped. Clearly, only the areas that were walked on regularly were vacuumed. The carpets under the beds still had crackers from previous tenants and were covered in dust. We requested another room, which was granted immediately, only to find that the lower cabinets in the kitchen were rotten, wood crumbling on the floor. The TV in the living room was missing the remote and had no power button so you could not turn it on without the remote. The dresser in the bedroom had paint chipping off of it, real great with a little one around. The bathroom, all though picked up, was not clean. The floors were still dirty. They left all of 4 towels in the bathroom which you were expected to wash yourself. When you run out of soap you are expected to buy it yourself. The washers and dryers in the room are exrtremely small and are easily thrown out of balance. The dryer only worked part of the time. The lamp in the bedroom repeatedly popped lightbulbs. Only 1 of the 3 bulbs in the bathroom worked. For the money we paid for this room we were very disappointed. The kiddie pool which had awesome potential has loose tiles. These tiles had sharp edges and I was picking them up and throwing them out so the kids wouldn't get hurt. Not a good value. This place had so much potential and I could have dealt with most of the set backs but the personnell there didn't seem to care. I would call one extension after the next and no one answered and no one returned voice mail messages. I ended up repeatedly having to walk down to the front desk to get things corrected. For a resort , I felt the service was poor. Not the typical service we get at Wyndham properties. We won't be back.

<Title>“Did not match the negitive reviews”
<Content>A week before going to the Ocean Walk Wyndham, I began reading the reviews on this site and others and got very nervous. But once we got there I was very happy. The place is beautiful, very nice and helpful staff, and the kids LOVED it!. Our room was on the 5th floor looking out over the roof of the Ocean Walk shopping plaza that it is connected to. So needless to say we did not have a balcony BUT the room was huge. 2 bed rooms, the masterbed room had a huge king size bed, whirlpool tub that my kids loved, shower, etc. The guest room had 2 double beds and another normal bathroom with a washer and dryer. At first I was upset about not having a balcony but in all reality, we were never in the room anyway... so it didn't matter. I read previous posts about wet carpet from cleaning... there was one wet spot BUT I was just glad that the carpet was clean. Towels... they do not have room service to clean make beds, vaccume, etc. I thought I only had 2 bath towels for the week, so I requested more. They brought about 6 more up then I found the others in under the bathroom sink. I just washed a small load ever day or 2 of laundry and it was fine. They also rent you beach towels. One nice thing about doing the laundry is that I had NONE to do when I got home :0) The putt putt on the 4th floor was nice, the game room nice, computer rooms nice, lazy river... awesome, Turtle nest ... awesome, no one without an arm band was allowed up from the beach and that was nice, go cars across the road... awesome, Bubba Gumps next door.. awesome. To sum it up... I am ready to go back again!

<Title>“LOVED WYNDHAM OCEAN WALK - DAYTONA”
<Content>We stayed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk 5/10 - 5/17/08. We own time share and traded there. We had a 2 bedroom unit. The unit was great; the hotel is fantastic. Everything you can imagine is within walking distance with the Ocean Walk Village right next door. The hotel is clean, the service was superb, the employees were pleasant and made sure anyone that didn't belong did not get into the facility. The pools and lazy river are great. The children's pool area was the best. The hotel even had a bar area on the main floor with karaoke and added events on different nights of the week. Activities for children and adults alike was fun; example ice cream socials during the afternoon; bingo, etc. Popular restaurants and within miles; a Publix grocery is right up the street; gift shops right across the street. Great, great place; planning on going back again next year.

<Title>“Great Value and Location”
<Content>We were skeptical because we had read some iffy reviews and were very pleasantly suprised! This hotel has been recently renovated and is in great shape. The rooms are huge (we had a 1 bdrm ocean view suite) and it came with a full kitchen and washer and dryer. It was very clean. We were concerned that they would try to give us a strong sales pitch for the time share program, but they were very low key and left us alone after 1 attempt. The location could not be better. It is connected to a movie theater and complex with 3 nice sit down restaurants, plus fast food and sandwiches. The (4) pools are fantastic for kids. The kids pool has a big jungle gym built into the water. The bigger pool has a slide like those at a water park. This is not a Ritz Carlton, but very nice for the money and great for a traveling family.

<Title>“Very Nice”
<Content>My family I stayed in a two bedroom deluxe unit with an ocean view, earlier this month. The unit is very large (maybe 1100 or 1200 square feet, not including the balcony) and had a double sized balcony that can be accessed from the living room or one of the bedrooms. The unit itself was clean and well appointed -- sofa, two large living room chairs, rectangular dining room table with six chairs and a counter attached to the kitchen with three chairs. The decor is very nice -- great colors and themes. One bedroom has a king size bed and the other features two double (54 inch) beds. Rooms were very clean although the bedspreads were a bit tired. Each bedroom features a television with cable. The kitchen has a microwave, stove, fridge, dishwasher, dishes and utensils. The kitchen was very clean and fairly large. The dishwasher was a bit balky. There are two bathrooms -- one with a double sink, shower and hot tub and the other a basic sink and tub. Everything was spotless. You have a small washer and dryer, which worked very well. They provide you with soap, dishwasher detergent, a couple of small laundry soap boxes, shampoo, conditioner, etc. There were lots of towels, but you will probably have to wash them if you are staying for a week. This is not a problem. You can go out and buy some additional laundry soap. You bus your own garbage to a shoot in the hall. The unit itself would earn a grade of "A" in my view. There are two outdoor pools, one indoor pool, a 'lazy river' ride (inner tubes pushed by a current around a circular water track) and an outdoor hot tub. The pool area features good security coverage (they will ask you to produce your access card or an arm band) and is busy at certain points in the day. Very nice setup. The beach is not really private as a previous reviewer indicated but it is in a pedestrian only area and there is easy access to the hotel pool area from the beach. There is a bar by the pool, which seemed to close its doors at a reasonably early time. The water was 75 degrees in the ocean but you are advised not to go out too far due to the current (waist deep). The staff at the front desk and in the hotel were friendly and helpful. There was a bit of construction work around the parking entrance area but this was not a big problem. You could enter the garage through a back entrance. Overall, a very good experience.

<Title>“Super fun!!! Very Friendly!!!”
<Content>We just got back today from our stay at the Wyndham ocean walk. It was great!!! Check in-We had to wait a little but we did arrive right at 4pm on a Sunday. So it was to be expected! Staff very friendly. Room-Was great, clean, amenities fine. Beds comfortable. Nice sample of toiletries. Great view of the ocean. It was on the north side, but we could see the ocean from the couch and balcony. Overall hotel condition was friendly and clean. We were very pleased. The ocean walk connects to the hotel. So great lunches and dinners available. And of course a Starbucks right there as well! The hotels beach is private--- no cars allowed. Very comforting! We had a great stay!!! Hope this helps.

<Title>“Not so Great”
<Content>If you use a timeshare to stay here prepare to be treated like a second-class citizen. We did so and were stuck on the south side of the building overlooking the loud air conditioning units of the mall next door. The mall is very busy at night so the windows and balcony door were always closed. Our unit was spacious. The furniture was stained and dirty and there were roaches in the kitchen. When I reported the bugs to the front desk they didn't seem to care. The facilities on the property are nice but for some reason the kiddie pool was warm one day but ice cold the rest of the week. The beach is beautiful but strong rip currents keep you close to shore. (One man was carried out to sea when we were there.) You can walk to many restaurants. Finding a grocery store was a challenge, there is a PUBLIX about 10 minutes North on Atlantic Ave. This resort is not horrible and some of the staff are nice but I will not go back with my family.

<Title>“Bad Service - Will Not Return”
<Content>Came to this resort for a business meeting and had service issues with almost everyone we encountered. First, drove up to the front of the hotel just to find out about parking--the bellman/doorman must have been 100 years old and just didn't get that all we were trying to ask was where to park since our rooms weren't ready yet. Took like 5 mins for him just to tell us to go in the garage after giving us the 3rd degree about why we were there. After parking, the next encounter with staff was where the meeting rooms were. No one could explain how to get to the meeting area, and when we finally figured it out, the girl working that area was quite short and abrupt with us, not very willing to be helpful. Then, after our business was over we went to the front desk. What they don't tell you and don't have signage for, is that there is a separate check in area for owners or in our case, it was pre-arranged rooms for our compnay at the owners desk, so after standing in the regular line forever, we have to go to a different line. These front desk people were the SLOWEST and RUDEST people I have ever seen. They complained about their jobs and it took 2 people about 1 hour to check in 10 people, causing some in my group to be late for the next meeting. Be ready to sign your life away to about what you can and can't do at the resort. The only GOOD service was at the outside pool bar where the bartender was friendly, outgoing and very accomodating. The rooms were OK--nothing fancy or shiny and new. Oceanfront rooms are great for the view. Had maitenance issues with lights not working, and when I pulled the sliding glass door, the handle came off. For a family on a budget these would be ok rooms for a week, but I would never buy a timeshare here. The pool area was crowded, but the beach is easily accessible. I would not stay at this resort again for pleasure.

<Title>“Great place to stay”
<Content>We just returned from Wyndham Ocean Walk resort on Thursday 5/8, it's a really nice place to stay for families. We had a 2 bedroom deluxe with nice decor and all amenities available. We checked in Sunday and out Thursday without any problems/delays. The only thing I can say that was disappointing was the whole pool area was shaded by 2-2:30pm.

<Title>“Had a Wonderful Time and Don't Understand all the Complainers!!!!”
<Content>We just stayed at the Wyndham Ocean Walk for five nights and we had a great time there. I have been planning this trip for quite awhile and kept coming back here to read all the new reviews that were posted to see what I could find out about the resort since I had not stayed there before. After reading the reviews, I was very concerned and thought I had made a HUGE mistake to plan a family vacation at a place I didn't know much about. We arrived at about noon and our room wasn't ready so we checked our luggage and went and did what we wanted and retrieved our luggage when we were able to check in (my parents also rented a condo and arrived at noon and their room was ready and they went right up, so yes they DO let you check in before 4:00pm if the room is ready). I was very nervous about the condo but there was no need to be. It was a VERY nice room. We rented a one bedroom condo and we were on the 15th floor. We ended up on the side of the building, overlooking the Ocean Walk shops and had a partial ocean view. It was perfectly fine with us. If you are not willing or able to pay the extra for the ocean front rooms then you need to be satisfied with the view you get and we were more than pleased with the room, ocean-front or not. Also, if you are on the street side of the hotel, you do have a water view of the Halifax River, which is very nice. Our condo was very nicely furnished with modern furniture and a nice booth-like eating area in the dining room. We had a large bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a separate shower that was huge. The bedroom was really nice sized and had a king sized bed. We were very pleased with how clean and nicely furnished and painted it was. I don't know if some people don't understand that this is a condo, not a hotel but no....there is no maid service and it explains this in the directory if you take the time to read it. They are not going to come make your bed for you and give you clean towels. There is a washer/dryer in the unit and they give you two complimentary boxes or laundry detergent. It's a very small washer and we were able to do four loads of laundry with the two boxes of detergent we received, no problem. There was more than enough dishwasher detergent and liquid dish soap as well. I have no idea why anyone would need to go out and buy any themselves as I read in other reviews. I saw many people setting their trash out in the hallway for someone to take away and it sat there for a couple of days. I also read in the directory that you are to place it in the trash chute, which you walk right by to get to the elevators so we had no problem taking our trash and dropping it off and there were plenty of extra bags under the sink and also inside the bottom of the trash can. I had read about the issues with waiting in line for longer than an hour to check in but when we got there, I probably waited 1-2 minutes to both check in and check out. We had no problems with that. We also had no problems with the elevators. I never waited any longer than 1-2 minutes for an elevator at the VERY MOST. Generally it was there within seconds after hitting the button. Also, I never saw anyone placing towels on chairs at the pool and then leaving. We were down there several times and never had a problem finding a chair and never really noticed any chairs sitting with towels on them. There are PARTS of the pool area that are shaded after 1:00pm but certainly not the entire pool area. I was specifically curious after reading that so I made a point of checking on it and yes, there were certain areas that were shaded but definitely not the entire pool area. I could still find sunny parts up until about 3:00pm when we were there. We felt the pool area was more than accomodating for the number of people there but I imagine it might be different during Spring Break and I avoid travelling during that time due to the number of people you have to deal with. All in all, we had a wonderful time and would recommend this condo to anyone that asked. I thought the grounds were very nice, the staff was decent. Not OVERLY friendly but not rude either. There were several security guards around the building and in the pool area, which was nice to see. We would definitely stay at the Wyndham Ocean Walk if we are in the area again.

<Title>“Good for families with small children”
<Content>The Wyndham Ocean Walk gets a mixed review from our family. We were just there for a week with our almost 2 year old. Nice family atmosphere, right on the beach, nice kiddie pool area, restaurants and water park next door. The pool area is large, but probably not quite big enough for the enormous resort. If half the people didn't go to beach there would be trouble. It was hard to get a chair if you didn't go out early. Of course we were out by 9:00am with our little guy. The pool is shaded by 1:00pm so it's best to do the pool in the morning and then move out to the beach in the afternoon. We used a week of my in-laws time share vacation for our stay so it only cost us $150 for the week. Of course we were pleased for that price - but if we had paid more I'm not so sure... We had an okay 1 bedroom with a great view of the ocean, which was a bonus surprise. The units without a view looked terrible. Windows facing into the hallway that were beat by the sun all afternoon. Probably very loud too. In room washer/ dryer was great - not sure if they all have that. Especially since you don't get any fresh towels for a week. I washed ours frequently at my own expense. We got two packets of laundry soap and when I called to get more I was told I had to go buy it. Also couldn't get anymore dishwasher soap, dish soap, paper towels, or garbage bags. I just took a trip to the dollar store down the road, but I was a little surprised by how rude housekeeping was when I called to ask. Check in time if 4:00pm and we weren't allowed in a minute before that. You can park early though and use the pool and beach if you arrive earlier in the day. That was okay, but I did have a problem with check out time. It's a ten in the morning. At 9:30 my husband started taking luggage out to the car - he was surprised to find housekeeping standing outside with their cart ready to come in. They stood there and watched him make 2 trips to the car, then started beating on the door at 9:45. I was so surprised I didn't say anything at the time, but.... We didn't have much contact with staff members other than the rude housekeeping department. There were several security gaurds stationed throughout the resort that were friendly and did seem to be doing a good job of checking for wrist bands or hotel keys. Seemed to have a strage mix of time share owners, hotel guests, and residents that lived there full time. Overall good for families, but not very luxurious.

<Title>“would never go back”
<Content>it was my daughters 16th birthday party weekend, we checked into the hotel on friday i booked it with daytonabeach. com they ask if i wanted a roll away bed i said see. we go to check in the check in time was 4:00 not 3:00 like i was told. i get to the hotel and was told there was no rollaway bed. so i had to leave and go buy an air bed. we got up to our room and the carpet was so wet from the shampooing it that i fell on the tile floor, no one at the hotel ask me if i was o.k. they just moved me one hour and 45 minutes later to another room. i had to go from the 16th floor down to the lobby 4 times because the keys did not work. so it was not a good start. i had to sleep on a air bed with my back hurting from the fell. i ask them if i could have a room with a pull out and i would pay, they said they did not have a room. which i could not understand that the hotel is big. so we will not go back. and the towels you get is all you get you can wash them and pay for it. the ice you have to pay for there is not ice machines.

<Title>“What a difference 2 years makes”
<Content>Two years ago a great stay - can't say the same today. 1 hr and 45 minutes in line to check in!! A full page of maintenance items that needed to be repaired on the first unit they put our 2 families in. The door lock that never worked with the room's keys to the point that maintenance was replacing the lock at 10:45pm. The next day a new unit - the alleged only one left - unfortunately someone on a prior visit had vomited on one of the bedroom's floors and they didn't clean the carpet to get the stench out. No one taking responsibility. The manager "on vacation" DURING SPRING BREAK???? From our view on the 23rd floor the pools are in dire need of power washing (at least we hope it was that and not brown algea). Get to pool at 8:15am for the chaise chase as everyone places towels to hold their seat till their ready to come later. Stand in line after line for the elevators. Finally yes it was Daytona at Spring Break, but with the inside hallway next to the second bedroom window and partiers coming in until 4 am - no chance at sleep. This was a problem two years ago also and it wasn't Spring Break

<Title>“Beautiful resort”
<Content>I just wanted to say we stayed here after our week in Disney Saratoga and had some real Noise problems at Disney so we did not know what to expect being in Daytona March break. I have to say WOW! ..... We pulled up and were greeted by Security who said yes we have you booked in the south tower,heres your parking card and you can turn around and park now.It was only 11am and we had arrived early,No problem he said. The room was not ready as we expected because over 200 people just checked out but we could hit the beach and swim until then they told us, come back at 4pm. We have to say WOW! again, beautiful pools(heated) and lazy river(not heated though) the pools were about 80 but the lazy river 70 or so. The beach was beautiful, very very clean and lifeguards everywhere with police patol obvious(no drinking allowed). We went back at 4pm to get our room and it was ready 1817 if you get a chance. Very nice 2 bedroom facing south with a side view. The noise is moderate as it is the 18 th floor but you can hear the bars until 3 or 4 am ,Oh well it is not that loud. The room was clean and huge with everything you need. The stores were a little walk but tons of places to eat . Try Bubby Gump shrimp ,it was great. We had a great time but spent most of the days on the beach because the pool fills up fast (by 11am forget it) and the sun goes behind the building after about 3 pm so the beach is the place to be for sun as the pool is shadedby then. We would go back for sure...Just stay on higher floors if you can as the bars can be loud and we heard a few people trying to move higher. Oh, Security was outstanding....You needed an armband to get back from the beach and security was pretty tight about it as well. They put up with very little and we felt really safe which was a bonus with 2 small kids. Beach patrol same thing, we saw them swim out a few times to get kids out of the rip current...They don't take that well as you can get pulled out VERY fast they tell me. Enjoy ,,, we did

<Title>“More Than We Expected”
<Content>We bought a week here from Ebay...and were surprised at how nice the resort turned out...We arrived early, and were allowed to check in at 11am (normal check-in 4pm!) The grounds and building are really beautiful, conveniently located. Also, we were here during Spring Break...lots of college students here, but they didn't bother us a bit. The one bedroom deluxe we stayed in was awesome...clean, well decorated, and very spacious. The bathroom was huge, kitchen and washer/dryer a must. If we come back to Daytona in the future, we will definitely stay here. Staff, concierge, all were very friendly and helpful!

<Title>“Good spot for the price”
<Content>We stayed at this hotel 3/14-17. We were in room 1803. This is a timeshare property as well. Families would enjoy this hotel because of the amenities for the kids and access to food for all ages and prices. We had an oceanview room at it was nice. Screens on the balcony sliders was a plus as we could have fresh air all day and night. Although it was spring break, it was relatively quiet. The rooms are spacious and well stocked. The configuration of our room was puzzling. This was a 1-br suite. The bedroom is in the front of the room next to the hallway. The hallway had lights on all night so it was also bright in the bedroom They need room darkening shades badly. The only real annoyance was the constant push to try and get you to go the their 90-minute sales pitch. Upon arrival, notes under the door, phonemail messages, people asking you on the beach, yada yada. All in all, I thought it was a good place and would go back if I returned to Daytona.

<Title>“Everything it's cracked up to be & more!!”
<Content>I've stayed here twice. The first time was in a suite with my three children. We were with a group of four other families. This hotel is awesome for families. There is a kids water play area, lazy river, mini golf course. It is amazing. The rooms have kitchens, washers and dryers (a must have for the beach). The bathrooms are awesome! The second time I stayed was with my husband and three children. The room wasn't as large as the suite but still had the kitchen & washer and dryer. It rained almost the entire time we were there but luckily the hotel has an indoor pool so all of our fun wasn't lost. There is a movie theater, night club, & restaurant complex connected to the hotel. Lots of dinning options in walking distance of the hotel. A nice hotel bar, we recieved a complimentary drink with our hotel. The hotel has a nice cafe. It sits right on the beach for nice days and great evening walks. My whole family really enjoys this hotel and I think it is time for another few relaxing days!! :)

<Title>“We can't wait to come back!”
<Content>My husband & I stayed in a 1 bedroom condo at the end of February. We rented directly from the owner and had a wonderful experience. The resort is close to everything and within walking distance of restaurants. Ocean Walk offers many activities and amenities. The room and grounds are kept immaculate! The resort staff was friendly and accommodating. The resort is located in a no drive zone and I was surprised at how much I appreciated that. We can't wait to come back

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>We stayed here to meet up with my mother and father in law. We got the room from a friend so no money was paid for this room. With that said, my kids had a great time riding the waves in the ocean and swimming in the heated pools. When we had down time, they would take off and play putt putt or do one of the hourly activities. However, I didn't think the emplyees were all that friendly. We did have an issue where my youngest got confused and went up the wrong tower, Zack, one of the activities employees made sure he made it back to the room. When I tried to get him acknowledged at the front desk, the women didn't want to hear anything of it. She told me to write it in the survey that will be emailed to me. Also, our remote in the bedroom didn't work, we had some bugs in the bathroom and two lights in the bathroom were out. One light in the shower and one light above the mirror. Also, you have to go to the main floor or lower lobby to get wifi. Our kids had homework that needed to be done that required use of the laptop. We would have to pack everything up and go downstairs and pray that nobody else was using the one table that was available. We had an indoor room (lock out), the lights from the hallway kept me up most nights as the blinds do not keep out much of the light. I woke up many times thinking it was 7 and it was 2 in the morning. I did like the option to do laundry, however, it didn't feel like much of a vacation, becuase I was always cooking, doing dishes and cleaning. We would go back if it was free, but we would not pay.

<Title>“TERRIBLE Customer Service: No luggage carts, no bellhops, no help for handicap!”
<Content>The front desk couldn't find my reservation, so I had to drag my computer in (it was 42 degrees outside!) and go online to prove that I belonged there. That took nearly half an hour! No bellboys, no luggage carts at 1:00 a.m. Asked for a room close to the elevator, and was given the very furthest away. I am handicapped with a bad heart and hernia the size of a 18 pound baby! (VERY clearly visable!!) Dragged in the first two loads of luggage from the parking garage, struggled with them for nearly 1/4 block; garage is super big and only one door. By the time I got to the third load, I felt like I was havng a heart attack. I couldn't breathe, and started to have an asthma attack. I waited on the elevator emergency phone for 7 minutes for someone to answer. They never did, and lobby was totally deserted when I'd arrived. So much for being "busy". By that time, I had slumped to the floor and had to crawl to the alarm system in the elevator. No security cameras to be seen; security finally arrived and assisted me to my room...after the elevator door closed on both of our bodies (nothing stops it!!), and nearly knocked the wind out of me. No apologies, no remorse, no comment. My bags were dropped in my room, and case closed. It was a horrible, horrible experience. Unless you have your own luggage cart or a family to carry your bags, steer clear of Oceanwalk. They'll let your croak and not think anything of it.

<Title>“Great location, room sucked”
<Content>We stayed at this resort for a week to have a family vacation with our children, ages 1 and 5. We chose this resort for its location and amenties for children. I grew up in Daytona and am very familiar with the beachside, but this resort was built new after I moved away, so I was not familiar with it before we stayed there. Pros: Location is great, right on the beach. Attached to the boardwalk, which is undergoing renovations. Restaurants and a movier theater (and Starbucks) are right by the hotel. The hotel itself has indoor miniture golf, two indoor pools, a nice lobby, and a nice pool deck. The room was large and had a nice jacuzzi tub, the kitchen was well-stocked and the washer and dryer were very useful. Cons: The room we got was on the opposite side of the beach, so we had a view of the parking garage. The view was awful, we could smell car fumes when we had the sliding door open, and because the hotel is so tall, we could not even hear the beach or waves. The carpets were filthy, and my 1 year old was filthy from crawling on them. The service was ok, the staff responded to calls but were not always friendly. The bellman made it seem as if it was an imposition to help us with our luggage. Since we went in November, it was a little cool out, and the pool deck only had sunlight up till noon everyday since the very tall resort buildings blocked the sun after noon. So, we could only swim outside from about 9 till noon. The beach was covered in seaweed and there was only about 10 feet of beach between the seawall and the water. The seaweed is not clered off, so you really can't do anything on that stretch of beach. We drove to another beach to sit and play in the sand. Since this place is a timeshare place, we did do a presentation to get free Disney tickets. The presentation was nice and the salesman was pleasant. Be aware that Daytona Beach boardwalk area is still a little sketchy - not much has changed since I moved away. You will find homeless people hanging out on the boardwalk and asking you for money and cigarettes. Since I knew where I was I was not bothered by this, but if I had never been to Daytona, I would be unnerved by this. I would recommend you not stay at the boardwalk if you do not want to encounter this.

<Title>“2 Star Hotel That is Need of Renovations”
<Content>My family and I stayed at the Ocean Walk Resort in February 2008 and were not impressed with the hotel or Daytona Beach. Daytona Beach has great ocean front property but most of the buildings are tired with the exception of the Hilton next door. Daytona Beach and Ocean Walk Resort are in badly need of renovations. The rooms in the resort are spacious, but things are old. The resort is not even close to a 4 star. It could be a 3 star if they renovated the rooms and the pools. The indoor pools are very small and ordinary. The outdoor pools showed alot of wear. Service in the hotel was lacking, even though there was a lot of vacancy in the resort, we were still not able to check into our room until after 4:00pm. There in no room service or cleaning and you have to wash your own towels. It seems that the east coast of Florida has become very worn and not family friendly. My next Florida vacation will be in Clearwater Beach

<Title>“Beautiful Resort”
<Content>We stayed at the Ocean Walk Nov 30 - Dec 7, and were very pleasantly suprised by the size of the two bedroom unit. We had a tenth floor corner unit in the south tower overlooking the ocean. The sunrises were magnificent. We loved having our own washer and dryer in our rented timeshare unit. (we are not owners) All the staff were pleasant and helpful. Although we did not have any children with us, it appeared as though there were many activities for them to enjoy. Wireless service in the lobby with many tables and chairs to use was a plus. Next door at the Ocean Walk Shoppes were several excellent restaurants. We loved Adobe Gilas (and actually ate there twice!!) We also liked the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. The only downside we experienced was after 1 pm the sun disappeared behind the building, rendering the entire pool deck in the shade, which with the temperatures in the 70's made for a cool afternoon. In retrospect, we should have bought some beach chairs at Walmart, and extended our waterside time on the beach.

<Title>“Won't go back”
<Content>I took my 10 and 12 year old children to The Wyndham Ocean Walk for a week stay. We had a 2 bedroom/2 bath on the 10th floor. The room had a bad odor to it when you walk in the front door. I assumed it was because we were next to the garbage shute and even though we tried everything to mask the smell, it never went away. One day, I received phone calls every 15-20 minutes about the time-share presentation, which I chose to not attend. I then began receiving calls in the room from a "vacation club" down the street for a presentation. I can only assume they got my name and room number from the front desk. The staff was unfriendly and unhelpful. The front desk had only two people working at any given time, while the time share desk always had 5-6 people attempting to lure you into their presentations. The 2 bedroom was spacious and the beds were comfortable. One weird thing was that there was no door between the master bathroom and the master bedroom, so anyone entering could see you in the jacuzzi tub or see-through shower. They closed down the balconies two days after we arrived for maintenance and when I asked for a new room in the north tower, where they were not working, I was told there was no availability. I knew however there were numerous rooms available because I called as a new customer and inquired. The area around the pool only gets sun until approx 12:00 pm, then it's completely blocked by the buildings. One night, there was a wedding reception on the 4th floor and the music kept me awake until 1:00 am . Then, there was a building evacuation at 4:00 am due to a fire alarm. The lazy river was freezing cold and looked dirty. Overall, our stay was enjoyable because the weather was perfect and we spent time in St Augustine and on the beach. Next time, we will try somewhere else, as the Wyndham is all about selling timeshares and not at all about customer service.

<Title>“Great Ocean Front Room but Beware of Interior Rooms”
<Content>We stayed at the Ocean Walk the last week of November this year and had a great stay. We ended up with a beautiful 1 bedroom Ocean Front room with a full kitchen and jacuzzi tub. The room had super views of the ocean and nice, comfortable decor. However, when we first checked in, we were given a 1 bedroom interior room with a mini-kitchen. This room had no windows to the outside- only a window to the hallway- and was poorly maintained and extremely stuffy. We asked to change rooms and the staff was very accommodating. Thankfully for us, there was a great room available. The pool area is fun with a the lazy river and slide. We didn't travel with our kids this trip but they would have loved all the activities- especially the indoor 9 hole putting course. There were several computers available for free internet access and the activities desk had movies and games to check out. The hotel is located right next to the Ocean Walk shops and movie theater. We enjoyed eating at Bubba Gump's as well as the Ocean Deck- which was just a short walk down the beach past the pier. For another fun night, we went to Caribbean Jack's which is a short drive (5 min) but worth it for the fresh seafood and live band and location right on the marina. Overall, we had a great time at the Ocean Walk and would recommend it but make sure you don't have an interior room. We were very lucky to end up with an Ocean Front but anything would be better than the inside rooms.

<Title>“A great place to stay”
<Content>We just returned from a week's stay at Wyndham's Ocean Walk resort in Daytona Beach, and had a wonderful stay. We rented directly from the owner, and payed the same as we were quoted for the Quality Inn down the road. Our family of 4 stayed in a one bedroom condo, which worked out great as there are 2 double beds in the bedroom, so we could put the kids to bed at night and still have some quiet time to ourselves to relax on the balcony or watch t.v. The unit was exactly like the photos on line. It was clean and had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. The resort itself had activities on every day for everyone in the family, so we could choose to participate or to just enjoy the pools and the beach. There was never any pressure to participate. (The "dive-in-movie" was a big hit with us all.) There are security people all over the place, so we felt somewhat safe there, but it didn't take long to notice that there are many ways into the resort without going through security, so it isn't quite as safe as it seems, but even so...some security is better than nothing, and more than you will find in most places. We never encountered any trouble there that's for sure. Beware of the "short tours" of the resort scam. Ocean Walk is a timeshare resort, and you will be approached many times (or called in your unit) to come for a "short tour" of the resort, usually for a prize of cash, free gas, etc. You don't have to go!!! (unless you are truely interested in purchasing a time share.) You will just end up wasting valuable vacation time trying to get out of a high-pressure sales pitch. Thankfully, we were warned not to go, and now, so are you. We had a great time at Ocean Walk, and would go back without any hesitation at all.

<Title>“NO PARKING”
<Content>We arrived at Ocean Walk on Saturday before Biketoberfest. We were informed that we could park our bike but not our car as you are only allowed one parking place. Had we known this up front we would have stayed somewhere else (this was our 4th biketoberfest). Bikes can park several in a space plus in areas for bikes only we can be parked down the middle of the driveway so no one is blocked in. We stayed on the fifth floor and checked the garage everyday and it never filled up. Ocean walk is a nice place (little pricey) so if you are going to bike week or biketoberfest know this! Do not pull a bike trailer unless you can put in your room because they will not let you store it on sight (one bike and bike trailer do not take a full space). Plan on paying to park your 2 ft. X 4 ft. trailer for about 80.00 for the week. Don't think you can pull your bike on a trailer and pay to park the trailer only; you will be paying to park both your car and trailer (160.00 for the week). Do not buy the park across the street deal cause all cars have to be out on Thursday. Will not stay again!!!!

<Title>“Nice place to stay”
<Content>We rented an owner owned unit . It was very clean with very comfortable pillowtop mattresses. There was a washer/dryer in unit. The amenities at Oceanwalk are awesome. With a lazy river ride, 2 huge outdoor pools (1 with slide), a large kiddie playground type pool and 2 indoor pools and 3 outdoor hottubs. The facility is right next door to OceanWalk Shoppes with a movie place, 6 restaurants, Starbucks etc. Everything you need is within walking distance. The cons were some units have a concrete 3 foot wall on the balcony which will partially block your oceanfront view. Also when you go out on the balcony you can look over and see other vacationers that are next to you. If you want a private balcony you may want to go elsewhere or check to see if some units have them as not all the balconies were made the same. Overall the facilities are very very nice.

<Title>“Wonderful & Relaxing Week at the Ocean Walk”
<Content>My mother and I stayed at the Ocean Walk for the week of Sept 8 - 15, 2007 and we had a wonderful time. My mother is a timeshare owner here and it was our first time to stay at this location. We went to a free concert at the bandshell, which is right in front of the resort, the night we arrived. The room was comfortable and very nice. The view was outstanding from the 18th floor, where we were. We had towels but we did have to call for soap. The only thing that I felt was inadequate was the lack of carts for you to get your luggage and stuff up to you room. There are bellhops to assist you, but they expect tips. They told me when there are extra carts they put them in a certain place. I rarely saw any carts there. For a place with this many rooms there ought to be enough for people to use if they don't want to use the services of the bellhops. I would definitely return for another vacation.

<Title>“Loved It So Much!!!!”
<Content>We went to Daytona for a week and stayed here and had the time of our lifes. The hotel was great and very clean. We checked in on a Friday at 11:00 am and our room was ready. We went to our room and was so happy with it. We had 10 floor ocean front. We never ate at the buffet in the hotel because to me it was costly. We did enjoy OceanWalk Shoppes that is right next door for many dinners and cool shops. They had a bath junkies, candle shop and few others. The beaches were great. The staff at the hotel was awesome and was always willing to help out if they could. The lazy river seemed a little dirty. Well I am not sure if it was dirty or if it just needed to be painted again. The pools were great. Many showers to rinse sand from beach off of you. We had no problem finds chairs at the pool and we had four adults and always got chairs side by side. The bar down there at the pool is a little pricy but its nice to have a bar right there. There are people on the beach that sell food and drinks. There are a few companys that rent chairs and table and umber. for I think $25 a day. Whichis nice to have that there for you to use if you want. I would go back in a heart beat. I want to tell everyone that reads these reviews that you have to take it as people will only enjoy it if they want too. If they are set its going to be bad then that might be what you get. Just remember the sight for the hotel and the pictures are not fake thats what it really looks like. Enjoy and please visit this hotel sometime. You will love it.

<Title>“Big Bad Changes”
<Content>We stayed here a few years ago and it was great. Since then it has changed hands to the Wyndham. The timeshare hotel looks the same but the service and cleanliness has gone down greatly. They were flat out rude. When clean towels were requested and did not arrive, the front desk clerk very abrubted informed us that we were to wash our own towels. "That is what the washing machine is for" she stated. When my sister informed her that towels were delivered earlier that morning, the desk clerk replied by stating "well, then you are definitely not getting any more towels". They have not decreased the price of the rooms, yet no longer provide any housekeeping or customer service. Also, the poor service continued throughout the entire stay. Stay at your own risk. We will not be going back.

<Title>“Everything at arms reach/Great for families”
<Content>My family and I absolutely loved the Wyndham/Oceanwalk condo hotel. I searched for anywhere in the US that was reasonable in cost and had a lot to offer at the resort. I was not disappointed. I thought the pictures were too good to be true, I've made many mistakes other years. After experiencing the resort and everything they had to offer it was even better than we expected. Our goal was to have everything at our fingertips for our family so that we didn't waste time driving around to restaurants or shops. This held true at the Wyndham. There were restaurants and shops connecting to the hotel. There were two pools and a lazy river. The beach was right there. Best of all our children of 4 and 5 enjoyed the "dive-in" movie. This was a big screen they set up at the pool with kids movies the played at night. The kids loved to swim and watch a movie, it was fantastic. There was also a craft room that had so many activities for the children to sign up for when they needed a break from the sun. They made many souvenirs and just had a ball. The rooms were very nice. The kitchen and bathroom were like new and very clean. The only work that was needed in the condo was that the livingroom furniture and carpeting really needed updating. The view was fantastic. The pool deck is not very big but we found that with children we didn't really get to lay out much anyways. One bad thing was that one of the pools was closed for a few hours almost everyday from either glass or debris. We felt that glass containers should be monitored a little more closely by security or lifeguards. This caused the other pool to be very croweded but at least there was another pool to go to. I would recommend this resort for families. Our family will visit another location of the Wyndham next year due to our great stay. Hope this helped!

<Title>“Fell in love with Oceanwalk and Daytona Beach”
<Content>We have just returned from a week at the Oceanwalk in Daytona, and could not be more thrilled with the hotel and the local amenities. We had a fantastic room with an ocean view, and loved the convenience of being able to make our own meals in the room. This saved a bundle for all seven of us who had more than enough space to cohabitate for the week. The beach was fabulous...can't say enough nice about this place and can't wait to go back!

<Title>“Read this: Very nice place, but Check ahead about Daytona events!!”
<Content>If we had checked ahead, as you need to when staying in Daytona, we would not have had a problem. We took our three young children there for spring break week. I DID check to see that it was not the same week as most colleges, so that was not going to be an issue. The place was convenient, beautiful, clean, the room/suite we had was gigantic, tons of room. Great pool, beach, lazy river for kids. Everything's great, right? Wrong! We arrived on Sunday, supposed to stay until following Sunday, everything's great, then Wed. we see police putting barricades up on the sidewalks. We ask why, and SOMEHOW, when we made our reservation, they neglected to inform us that the BCR--black college reunion--was coming to Daytona Thursday. The complaint has nothing to do with race whatsoever, understand that, but if you are on a family vacation with young kids, and suddenly 75,000 college age kids--of any race--show up, you cannot imagine the noise, the crowds, the utter gridlock on the street. We could not go anywhere due to cruising on the streets, it took a half hour to go five blocks, the sidelwalks were jammed, there was skin flashing, a constant deafening thump of rap music, the smell of illegal smoke in the hallways and everywhere, very unruly behavior(going around with video cameras in a attempt to talk women into removing their shirts), so it was NOT a place for young kids. We had to throw a fit with the desk to get them to refund our prepaid fee for the last two days. Thurs night we did not sleep due to the yelling and music that went on ALL NIGHT. The kids were terribly disappointed we had to cut the trip two days short. The reservations people SHOULD have told us. So my adivce is to check ahead, make sure spring break, BCR, race week, or Bike week is not the week you are going if you want a family vacation, because there are the same problems(noise, traffic, lewd behavior) at all these events when thousands of people show up to party themselves silly. But the hotel itself is very nice, just make sure to CHECK AHEAD AND ASK QUESTIONS!

<Title>“Great place to vacation with kids”
<Content>My wife and 2 kids stayed at Ocean Walk this summer and we had a great time. We booked through [--] online and in just a matter of minutes we had our confirmation and complete set of check in instructions and tips for our vacation. We were even able to get information on deep sea fishing from the website which was a great help. Check in was fast and easy and the desk people were very friendly. We had an ocean front room that looked out directly over the swimming pool and ocean. the night view was absolutely beautiful! Our condo was very clean and well stocked with dishes, pots and pans, etc. There is so much to do at Ocean Walk that we never left the resort for our entire trip. They have great activities for the kids while the wife and I just relaxed by the pool. We will book again for next year, our kids can not wait to go back.

<Title>“No walk in the park!”
<Content>We stayed at the Ocean Walk for four nights. The staff were equivalent to the kids that man the drive thru at McD's. Customer satisfaction is a thought not a priority. We had no housekeeping during our entire stay. They only cleaned the room if you were checking out. The elevator situation was chaotic. They advertise crab on their "Seafood Buffet"--there were only shrimp and chicken. The pool was crowded at 10 in the morning. The saving seats rule was hardly enforced. I wouldn't stay at this hotel ever again. It was very run down and not well maintained. I guess if I was a drunk, partying co-ed---it would be great. I would highly recommend dining at Norwood's in New Smyrna Beach during your visit to Daytona Beach. The food is fabulous seafood and is owned by locals. They have an extensive wine list, also.

<Title>“Great rooms that you can't get to.”
<Content>Great resort but the lack of functioning elevators will keep me from returning. I was in a nice oceanfront 1 bdrm on the 22nd floor so stairs were not a good option. This entire facility was very nice but they could sure use some help with the onsite restaurant . (Pretty bad chow.) Overall, I was impressed enough to have bought a timeshare except for the elevator issues.

<Title>“it was just ok”
<Content>Ok we stayed here for part of our florida vacation. The first half was spent at Bonnet Creek in Orlando, (which was wonderful), for a few days of theme parks for the kids. We arrived early around 11:00 in the morning and our room was ready. We were asked if we wanted to do the timeshare talk and we said no, and they promised us we would receive no phone calls about the timeshare. Well we received 4-5 calls per day starting around 7:30 in the morning (not when you want to be awoken on your vacation by annoying timeshare people) It wasn't even just the hotel people, they apperently "sell" the names and room numbers of their guests to a timeshare week place down the street, because they called us numerous times everyday, and they said they got our names and numbers from the hotel itself. We complained about this and the hotel stopped calling but the timeshare week people did not. Other than almost every game in the game room being broken (both air hockey tables) and the mini golf being very bad the hotel itself is very nice. Our room was clean, the only problem we had with the room, was in the extra bedroom and bath, there are a total of 4 doors. Only two locked. That was a problem as we had 3 children with us to tend to not knock on doors. The door to the hallway locked and the door to the bath and bedroom locked but the actual bedroom door and the door between the toilet and bath tub did not lock. We had a nice view of the ocean and pools. The elevators at this hotel were horrible to say the least. The only time we didn't wait at least five minutes for an elevator was very late at night, and the stairs weren't much of an option as we were on the 19 floor. There are only four elevators and over 20 floors of rooms. When you did get an elevator they sometimes were to full for you to even get on, and you would have to wait again for another. The pools were very crowded, and were full of sand, you must have a raft for the lazy river so you also usually must wait for those. The beach was nice at low tide, there was a sandbar the kids loved. I am not much on swimming in water where I can't see what is around me, so I didn't care for the beach much, but the guys loved body boarding and the kids liked it. Like I said this hotel is okay, and since we didn't pay for it I shouldn't complain, but I would never pay to stay here.

<Title>“Awesome Ocean Walk in okay Daytona Beach”
<Content>Not a fan of Daytona Beach, but stayed just for Ocean Walk Resort. I was not disappointed! Park your car and forget it! Ckin was smooth, room in south tower was great, including lots of towels, linens and a well stocked kitchen. Had a city view balcony which was still nice. Our one bedroom was very spacious and clean. The amenities were awesome, including lots of freebies like indoor mini golf, computer room, games you can check out, movie nights by the pool, lazy river between 2 outdoor pools. One pool had a great kid slide, and near the other one was a great toddler water play area. Access to beach easy, with a security guard to make sure outsiders didn't use the pools. 3 hottubs! Also 2 indoor pools. A great gym, adult game room seperate from kids game room (although pool table was broken in kids game room). There was also a spa, although I never made it there! We ate lunch and had drinks at the poolside bar one day and it was very reasonable for a resort. Some days there was a dj outside, and poolside games. Inside just off the lobby was an inside bar, and a restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. Ate the buffet breakfast one morning; average meal and price. Noticed dinner buffets also, but didn't eat there. Tip: if you walk into the restaurant there is an area to the right that sells food to take to your room (coffee, drinks, icecream, fruit , breakfast items, etc). Adjacent to the resort is a great area with shops, restaurants, movies...even a starbucks! The bandshell is also right there, they sometimes have free concerts. The Pier is within walkiing distance, and on Saturday night they gave us a great 15min. fireworks show from poolside! The Only complaints we had were that if you didn't get to the pool by 9:30-10:00am you didn't get a chair, and they could use more elevators-they were always busy-especially at ckin times or ckout mornings and if the beach and pools were suddenly closed for a storm. Otherwise, a fantastic family resort-I would definitly stay there again!

<Title>“very nice property”
<Content>My family of 5 stayed for a week in a two bedroom north tower. The room was very clean. Plenty of room for all of us. The washer and dryer in the room was convenient. The only problems seem to be what everyone is saying. The elevators and the pool chairs. We would have to take the stairs on some days ( we were on the 11th floor) because the lines were sooo long. Also they tried to control the situation with the chairs around the pool, but we would go down around 10:00 and nothing left. There was plenty to do and the kids had a great time. We would definitely go back.

<Title>“Needs a good room cleaning to be great”
<Content>This is my second time staying here. Stayed two years ago and thought it was great. This time I found the room accommodations shabby and in need of a good cleaning. Carpeting, drapes, furniture and bedding were all stained. I stayed in the South Tower (like last time) and I think the North Tower has the nicer rooms. I rented directly from the hotel and was surprised there was no maid service. I have stayed at other hotel/timeshares and usually hotel guests have maid service. I did last time under Fairfield management but now it's Wyndham so I guess things are different. Public facilities are nice. The pool area is well-maintained. There are lots of kids and plenty of kids activities. My ten-year old loved the arcade, miniature golf area and the kid's computer room. Adults had their own computer room which was nice. Oceanwalk has the best location right next door to the Ocean Walk Shoppes and Restaurants. If they would clean up their rooms, this would be a top-notch place.

<Title>“Loved Ocean Walk and Daytona Beach”
<Content>Daytona Beach is a great place to vacation, especially with the kids. So many things for them to do. Daytona Lagoon was right accross the street. Stay at Ocean Walk and park your car and forget it! It has everything you could need. The Movie Theatre was great, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co, Johnny Rockets, Star Bucks, A Spa, you must have a massage! The Resort has activities for the kids and adults to keep them busy. I have to say that Ocean Walk was the nicest place I have ever stayed...with all the amenities, the beautiful room with a jacuzzi tub in the Master! Check out Bongo Billy's Banana Boat Rides and get a free t-shirt. Also, if you tour the property they will hook you up with some other amenities, I chose $150 worth of dining certificates, making my pocket book a little happier. If you want to work with 2 great people to book your Condo, please email Dennis or Carmen at [-] they manage several properties directly for the owners and they are wonderful people!

<Title>“Fantastic! The Best In Daytona!”
<Content>This has to be the best place to stay in Daytona. I took my family there for a week and had a great time. There are numerous activities provided by the resort for the kids (and adults) to do while staying here. There are crafts, games, outdoor pool-side movies at night, put-put golf, etc. Speaking of the pools, they have 2 full sized pools, water slide, two hot tubs, and a huge lazy river that the kids loved. All of "The Beach Scene" is here or within a 3 minute walk of here. The boardwalk is a short walk, a 10 movie theater is next door, go-carts & water park across the street, shopping, resturants, etc. is within easy walking distance. The staff is very helpful, very friendly, and they have many discounts or free tickets to local attractions such as the ski lift at the pier, dog race tickets, etc. This is the 2nd time we have stayed at this resort and we will most likely stay here again. The rooms are huge! In the deluxe rooms they have a king sized bed in the master bed room and a jacuzzi hot tub! The other bedroom has two queen sized beds and plenty of extra room. There are closets, a large dinning table, full kitchen, etc. The only draw back is the $2,000/week price tag. I would like to find a similar resort with a lazy river on the gulf side if anyone knows of one.

<Title>“Had a Great Family Stay”
<Content>After reading most of the reviews, we were quite concerned about staying. However, we encountered none of the terrible concerns mentioned earlier. Concerning check-in, while it was 9 pm, it took about 5 minutes as there was no line. The desk staff was helpful and gave us good information. We had a 3 bedroom suite which has a balcony facing the beach. The unit had no major problems. Minor ones included no TV remote for the master bedroom, and the living room tv remote did not work well. Cooking supplies as in pans, etc., were quite slim, but we managed. Due to what we had to pay for the unit, we chose to eat as many of our meals in as possible. The refrigerator and ice maker was turned to the off position when we arrived, so it took a few minutes for the frig and freezer to get cold and the ice to produce. The unit was clean and well done. We only asked for additional wash clothes and all were delivered within 15 minutes. Then the desk called to make sure they were delivered. There are 4 elevators which serve each tower. There can be a wait during busy times of the day. We used those times to get a short workout and take the stairs to our 10th floor. Our 4 kids, ages 10-15, enjoyed the mini golf and game room. The pools were crowded on the weekend days but slowed down considerably on weekdays. On the weekend, the chairs were taken or marked with towels very early. Mgmt did issue notices to those who had not used their towels within 30 minutes by not being at the pool. It all seemed to work out. Parking can be tight in the parking structure. By late in the evening, spaces are hard to find. I was notified that a $12 a day charge would begin by 6/1. We did not eat at the resort except at the pool bar one day. Due to the crowd, it was extremely busy and very slow. The pools were great, the water warm, and the late night activities such as the "dive in" movie was great. This was a large, inflated movie screen by the pool. Access to the beach was very convenient through a gate at the back of the middle of the pool area. Vendors are immediately behind the gate with umbrellas, chairs, etc. for $25/day. It was convenient to have everything next door such as the movie theatre, Johnny Rockets, Starbucks, Baskins-Robbins across the street, IHOP down the street, etc. The beach was great, waves were good...we had no problems at all. We would seriously consider the resort again. We paid about $300/ night. This resort is next door to the Hilton Resort. I believe these two resorts are by far the nicest in this area of the beach. Next door was the Daytona Beach Regency, which looked like a much smaller, yet well done resort with pool activities. But we know nothing about staying there.

<Title>“Wonderful Experience”
<Content>We rented our condo from a private owner and have to say that the view from the 7th floor was beautiful. We were located in the North Tower overlooking the pool with a slide. The staff was nice to me when I checked in and had no problems with my check in. Our room was clean, plenty of towels, and did I mention the view was wonderful. I asked for a crib after we checked in, housekeeping brought one up and then the front desk called to make sure we got it. The pools were awesome. We have stayed at alot of condos and this has become one of our favorites. I was scared before going on this trip from reading this website but after getting there and seeing if for myself I was not disappointed. My advise is to try to rent from a private owner. They do not bother you about buying a timeshare. The pools do get crowded fast but we go for the beach.

<Title>“Still a very enjoyable place to stay”
<Content>We stayed at Ocean Walk May 12-19. This is the 3rd time we have stayed at this resort. We are guests of my sister, who is a owns points through Fairfield (now Wyndham). We stayed in a 2 bedroom deluxe, oceanfront room in the north tower. I mention the tower because this was the first time for us in the north tower and it seemed a little nicer than the south tower. I have read the recent reviews of this resort and was anxious to let people know how are stay went. We were very happy - we had 3 maintenance issues when we got to the room (screen door, light bulb, safe) and all were fixed within 30 minutes of reporting them. It took about 2 minutes to check-in (about 4:30 on a Saturday) and about the same to check-out(about 9:30am on a Saturday). The pools were warm, the grounds were beautiful. We had no complaints at all. There were some minor changes - there was definitely more security than in the past and you had to were your wristbands around the pools. I welcome this. They no longer do the cookouts, instead they serve food out of the tiki bar. We did not order any food. They no longer had the "theme night" as in the past, but this was no great loss to us either. You could not access the beach from the resort due to construction on a city park, so this was a minor inconvenience but not the resort's fault. We did talk to the guy who brought up our luggage about the recent bad reviews and he did say that since Wyndham took over the employees were not as happy as they were with Fairfield and that with major maintenance issues they were taking longer to resolve. As I mentioned above, we had no trouble with our maintenance issues. The room was very clean and well-stocked. I will attach some photos of the place. I still think this is the best place to stay in Daytona and I think Daytona in general is making improvements to clean up the city and make it more upscale. Overall, we had an outstanding stay and our interaction with the staff was very pleasing. I tried to add photos, but they look terrible after I added them. They looked fine before this. Any help would be appreciated.

<Title>“Daytona Beach Resort Experience Disability Friendly”
<Content>Our family of 6 (1 of which was our 11 year old daughter who is disabled and wheelchair bound) rented a condo at Ocean Walk Resort from a private owner. The location was on the 23rd floor with an excellent view of the ocean right outside on the patio. As soon as we opened up the glass doors, the ocean sounded as if it were 10 feet away. The owner 's description of the facilities and all that was offered was very honest and accurate. We will recommend renting a condo to our friends and family (from a private owner) as our family had an experience of a lifetime. Did I mention that I never once woke up during any of the 5 nights we stayed because of the high quality mattress, until a little too late in the morning?

<Title>“Not what it used to be”
<Content>This was probably our 7th time to stay here....always a favorite, when I tell the kids and family we are going, we count down the days! Unfortunately there have been changes.....seems Wyndham owns it now. The rooms are still really good, we always get a oceanfront - best bet as you can yell down to the pool or check on kids from above! The service at the front desk was impeccable as always. The problem is some new "security" staff they have hired, 3rd party I am told. These people truly believe they are power! All they go around and do is criticize, yell at everyone, and make people feel very UNwelcome. The pools used to be open late, but these new security people are yelling at 9:45 that there is only 15 minutes left and they will escort you off the deck......The new setup at the outside bar is crazy....it used to be a happy bartender that served great drinks, and a separate BBQ grill with burgers, hot dogs and chicken sandwiches. Now, the bartenders are overwhelmed trying to get food out of a tiny window, and the back kitchen is SLOW..... I wish things went back to the way they were!

<Title>“Very Nice inside and out.”
<Content>We just got back once again from Daytona. Fairfield Ocean Walk is a great place. We found it to be very friendly and clean. Our room was not ocean view but, had a great view of the city. We love the feeling of being at a hotel but kinda like being at home. The beach is just right out the back, along with the pools. The pools and lazy river are very nice. The only complaint we had was the saving of chairs by the pool. On a busy saturday people would leave their stuff on a chair all day. Which leave the people that are actually there left with nothing. The room was very clean and updated. Lots of extras. Lots of stuff to do at the resort for kids and families. We loved it and plan on returning soon.

<Title>“GREAT Family vacation”
<Content>Was a little nervous after reading all the posts here BUT everyone had an AWESOME time!! We stayed in an owners condo we booked through a lady named Vicky who owns some condos there daytonabeachrents.com - she really gave us a great price compared to the resort. Check-in is a pain and SLOW (bring a book to read) but the family changed in the locker rooms and went and played while I waited. The room was fantastic!! som much room, full kitchen with everything, seperate bedrooms, washer/dryer and the jacuzzi tub in the master bath was really nice. These owners rooms had wireless broadband - the hotel rooms didn't - also the people here had put games and books and DVDs in the room too - pretty cool! The kids (7, 9, & 10) wanted us to live there! 4 pools - they loved the twisty slide and they must have floated around the lazy river about a 1,000 times. The resort has tons of kid and family programs - kids did the ice cream social every day, junk food bingo and all the pool and beach games - oh the kids liked the indoor 9 hole putt putt too. The resort is right next to a movie theater and restaurants, and shops and the boardwalk. Right across the street was a place called Daytona Lagoon with a water park, go carts and a bunch of arcade games. We looked at staying at the Hilton next door - but I'm glad we didn't they don't have balconies and they dont have all the room the condo had. We will definately go back and probably never stay in a hotel room again.

<Title>“We love Ocean Walk Resort”
<Content>The girls and I spent the last four days at the Ocean Walk Resort it was a treat to ourselves for Mother's Day. My husband made the arrangements for us, he rented directly from the property owner/manger. The girls loved it. We had a beautiful 2 bedroom condo with a full kitchen a large dinning table and a breakfast bar. The mattresses were brand new and very comfortable. The whole condo was absolutely beautifully decorated and we had a view of the ocean. The owner also had some recent movies on DVD for us to watch along with the great pool with slide and a lazy river, not to mention the Tiki Bar and the ocean just a few steps away, we could not have asked for anything more. PERFECT!!

<Title>“Horrible, Horrible Experience”
<Content>I have always read the Tripadvisor reviews prior to booking a hotel and always told myself I would probably only take the time to write a review if I had an absolutely amazing time at a hotel or if the experience was so bad that I just had to make sure I wrote about it. Well, here I am feeling so strongly about the bad situation that I just experienced at the Ocean Walk Resort, that I feel it necessary to write a review. I will start with the short story: I checked in and then checked out within 2 hours of arriving. Here's the longer version: When I reserved the room which was for a business trip, I reserved an oceanfront room with a King size bed. I called the hotel about 3 days prior to arrival just to double-check on the reservation and was told that it was there, they had me in a room with a king bed, and the guy at the resort even told me that my room # had been assigned and gave me that information. I found that odd (since we were communicating over the phone, how could he be sure I was the actual guest who was going to be staying at the property?...that was a safety issue in my mind), but figured they do things a little differently here. After checking in I went up to the room and upon arriving at the door noticed that the white doors were very dirty. Not a good sign for someone who is very particular about cleanliness in a hotel. I went in and found that the bedroom was right at the front of the unit, with a window that opened to the hallway where people walk up and down to go to their rooms. Because of where my room was I literally had a view of the elevators. I didn't really like that set up, (would have preferred for the living room to be at the front and the bedroom at the back closer to the ocean), but figured I would just close the blinds and pull the curtains on the bedroom window so that people walking by couldn't see me and the light from the hallway would not bother me when I was sleeping. However, when I went to pull the curtains closed, they didn't move. They were "fake" curtains that were purely decorative and not functional, so I could close the blinds (which didn't close tightly and the light from the hallway still shone through), but I couldn't pull the drapes. I decided that I would go downstairs to see if there was another room that was set up differently. I noticed as I was leaving that the room didn't really have a "clean" feeling and the furniture looked tired. Also, the bedspreads on the 2 double beds didn't match. That looked really tacky. I went downstairs and asked the front desk worker (a different person from the lady who initially checked me in) if they had any rooms that didn't have windows that faced the hallway from the bedroom. He said that they do have rooms where the bedroom is at the back of the unit that would match what I was looking for. He said they were a slightly upgraded unit. I told him I was fine with that, I would pay the difference in price. He looked for a room, found one that was supposedly available, and gave me my 2nd get of keys. I went upstairs and thought to myself "that wasn't bad...so glad I spoke up and asked about a different room". I went in the room and as I headed to the bedroom, realized it was an un-cleaned room. The bedspread was on the floor, towels were on the floor in the bathroom, the kitchen had not been cleaned...it was a little disarming. So I called down to the front desk and told them that the room was not clean. I asked if someone from housekeeping could come up and clean it for me. (I really wanted to stay in the room because the layout was so much better than the last room. I was willing to wait an hour if that is what was needed to get the room in clean shape.) The lady who I spoke to said that she had taken note of the issue. She seemed like she was hanging up but I had no game plan yet, so I said to her "do you want me to just stay up here and you will call me back to let me know what is going on?". She said yes. I had to call back down since time had passed without hearing back from them. I asked for an update and was told that I was being moved to another room. She then said the bellman will come to bring my new key. I went to the new room (this is now room #3). I go in and turn to put on the security bar and realize there is none. There is the normal bolt that you can turn to lock the door in the hotel room, but the security chain or bar that is usually in a hotel room so that even housekeeping cannot come in if you are in there was not on the door. I felt very uncomfortable with that, especially since I was going to be the only one sleeping in the room. Also, I have never stayed in a hotel that did not have that security feature. So I went back downstairs and told them that my room did not have the security bar. The girl at the front desk looked alarmed at that but then said that she would see if engineering could go up and install one for me. She came back and said that they actually could not install one for me. She said they would just assign me another room. She assigned me another room and I asked her if she could tell by looking in her system if this new room had the security bar. She said no, the only way to find out is by actually going to the room. So I headed up to the room (room #4). Upon entering, I realize there was no security bar/latch...again. I call back downstairs because I refuse to stay in a hotel room that doesn't provide me with the adequate safety features. The front desk person then says that she has another comparable room in terms of layout, but that it is smoking, and apparently that is all she had to offer me. I told her that I don't smoke and I want a non-smoking room. She responded that many times even though it is a smoking room, it doesn't smell like smoke. I said fine. She told me to just stay up in the room and someone will bring me my key. About 3 minutes later, after more thought, I decided that I didn't want to compromise and go to a smoking room. I decided to go downstairs to the business center to use a computer to look for another hotel. I found my way to the business center (which is really a pool hall/lounge with a couple computers along the wall), and searched for a nearby hotel that had availability without success. I proceeded to the front desk to let them know that I am checking out because they were unable, after 5 tries, to find me a suitable room (all I wanted was a clean, non-smoking room that had the security bar/latch). The front desk lady (the 4th person I have now dealt with at the front desk) proceeds to do stuff in the computer. She kept doing things and doing things. After about 10 minutes I finally said to her "I am just checking...I presume you are processing my refund back to my credit card?". She looked at me and said "no, we can't give you back your money". I told her that I had not even stayed in a room yet...I had not even been in the hotel itself for more than 2 hours...and in no one room for more than 20 minutes. She went and got another lady who I am assuming is some sort of supervisor. This lady is one who had helped me locate a room with a security latch earlier, so she was clearly aware of all the issues I had been having. She asked me how she could assist me. I told her that I was checking out and that I didn't want to be charged for the stay. She said that they have a 72 hour cancellation policy and that they could not give me my money back. I asked her what the charge would be and she said the whole amount had been charged to my card for the 2 day stay and they couldn't refund any of it. I looked at her incredulously and explained that the only reason I was leaving was because they could not find a suitable room for me after 5 tries and I was really tired and didn't want to continue the saga. She refused to give me back my money. That was the final sign to me that this was not the place for me to stay. How a hotel can keep $400 + from someone who never stayed at their hotel is amazing to me. She just kept telling me I was choosing to leave even though they kept giving me different options. So did she expect I would just spend the whole night going from room to room, hoping we would find a clean, safe one?? At some point any reasonable person needs to put an end to the fiasco, and I ended it after 5 tries. I wasn't going to argue with her...figured I will just dispute with my credit card company. The customer service was horrible, the rooms were not clean and looked very run-down (the closet in one of the rooms was broken and kind of just leaning up in the track, and the carpet was pulled up, as if a dog had just clawed it for a long time), and they did not have the appropriate safety features that standard hotel room should have. I called my boss to tell her that I was leaving and told her my experience. She said she was going to add my experience to her list because she had had so many issues already herself (she also did not have a security latch on her door in her room, among other poor customer service issues). This was the shortest & worst hotel experience I have ever had. I do not recommend that hotel at all if you have any level of class or discernment. If you just want a place to lay your head between sitting at the beach, then maybe it is the place for you. But if you want safe, decently clean, and any level of customer service, please do not stay here.

<Title>“Good place”
<Content>The Ocean Walk was an okay place to stay. I've seen a couple people on here say it's one of the nicer places to stay in Daytona Beach, but that's not saying much. I'd agree, but say it's an okay place, even for non-Daytona standards. The timeshared part of the hotel (you can rent through vacationrentals.com, and I'm sure those poor timeshare suckers will be really thankful you did) is pretty nice. Suite-style rooms, with nice living room areas, TVs in all bedrooms, great master baths, washer and dryer, and a great kitchen. Not even a kitchenette - a full kitchen with oven and range. If you're coming to stay for a long time, you can definitely treat it as a home away from home. The rooms are clean, but you don't get replacement towels each day. The beach is actually quite nice and not horribly crowded. The pool's a little different story - fairly overrun, but not awful. It's a little dirty and rundown - everyone in our party cut their foot while in the pool. Some okay stuff for kids, including a nice (but small) lazy river to float in. We didn't eat in the hotel's restaraunt, so I can't comment there. The parking's okay, assuming you have one car. If you have more than one car, it'll cost you and you'll have to hike at least across the street if not beyond. All-in-all, a pretty decent place to stay in an otherwise nasty tourist trap of a city.

<Title>“Too many people are too picky”
<Content>Before my trip to The Ocean Walk Resort, I did a lot of research on the resort. I looked through a lot of reviews till my eyes went cross, and when I got in the car for the trip I have to admit was just a little bit worried. We got to the Resort at around 2, and since our friends were VIP we had early check in. Granted we waited for about 10 minutes while the people in front of us took forever, but as soon as it was our turn it took about 3 minutes to check in. We didn't have to wait till four like people had talked about on so many sites. The bell hop was right there ready to take our luggage upstairs. The eleveators were quick (in fact the only time we had a really long wait was the day we left). After we got back from the grocery store we realized that our fridge did not work, they came up in about 10 minutes to fix it. they advised us that if it still didn't work they would come back. at about 10:30 at night we called them because it still wasn't working. They came up and replaced the fridge that late at night. That was the only problem that we had. The rooms were nice, nothing was broken or stained. The pools were the right tempature. Later in the afternoons the teenagers got a little out of control, but the security (yes they are every where around this place) quickly put stops to it. I have nothing bad to say about this place. It was the best place i have stayed in, and I have stayed at some really nice places. the staff is perfect and always willing to help (if the bartender is Nathan ask for his special drink). And I am not sure if the problem was fixed or never exsisted, but we never had to wait for a pool chair. There were always more then enough, and they do take your towl and stuff to the sun center if you do leave your chair for more then a hour. Also if you are looking for gifts a local gift shop across the street from the resort on the corner is the best out there. nothing is overly priced and has a lot of stuff. Too many people are picky about this place. They need to understand that this is a time share type enviroment. you are not going to get new towls everyday and you beds are not going to be made (although half way through our trip they came in and gave us new towls and made the beds). If you really want a great stay in Daytona Beach, stay here.

<Title>“Awesome Stay”
<Content>I read so many bad reviews before leaving, I was scared. But I must say, our stay (family of 4 - 2 small kids) was great! First, we booked privately through a timeshare owner. I did this online through vacationrentals.com. This I believe is the way to go. The owner owns the condo outright, so the unit was CLEAN and everything was great... even check in. My husband used the spa for a massage and had a wonderful experiene. The pools were clean and the overall resort was clean. The front desk stay friendly as were all the employees we encountered. I honestly can't say one bad thing. For all who are going... don't fret.. we had a great time!

<Title>“Great Vacation!”
<Content>We stayed at this resort during spring break, April 1-6. We rented directly from the owner, not the hotel. Check-in was a breeze, room ready on time, and the room was clean! (and I'm very picky). We bought all our own food, and even extra TP just in case, washed our own towels, which by the way, we had plenty for 7 people. You do have to wash your own towels and take out your own trash, but they have trash chutes on all floors. We felt very safe, always security walking around, checking wrist bands to see if you were a guest around the pool area. Always found a parking place, but we were never out super late maybe 9pm at the latest, with 4 small children. The only down side was that the elevators were slow at times, like check out times or "time to go to the beach and pool" times. But overall not too bad. Never waited for one longer than 5 minutes. You have to expect crowds if you go during spring break, and maybe even a little partying, but there was never anything that was too annoying, couldn't hear much thru the walls, and we had some parties going on above us a few nights. The pool does get crowded early, and you can't go down just to put your stuff on a chair, b/c if hotel staff walks around and sees no one in the chairs, they put a notice on them, and if no one has returned in 30 minutes, they remove your things and take them to the towel stand to be retrieved. I suggest renting 2 beach chairs, little table, and umbrella for $25/day, plus you can add extra chairs for $8 a piece. Pool does calm down later in the day, so go then. Whatever you do--don't order delivery from a restaurant called "Pizza, Subs and More". There was an advertisement in our room for it, so one night we called and it was the worst food ever! Not just a few of the things, but everything we ordered! We just laughed about it b/c it was so bad. All in all the price was right for the time of year, and I will definitely go back if I get the chance. But like I said, rent from an owner, not the hotel. Just so you know, Daytona beach is much cleaner and newer than what I remember from my "spring break days" many years ago.....

<Title>“Worst hotel ever!!!!”
<Content>I arrived at the Ocean Walk on April 7th and was immediately upset with the customer service. Got kicked out of line twice stating that we were not allowed to pre register. Room was not ready by 4pm. When we finally got into our room, we were given a 1 bedroom instead of two. When I called down to the desk they told me I had to get back in line to get the room fixed. When I finally got the right room, we all decided to take showers, but no hot water. The whole tower had no hot water and this had been a problem for 2 days now, and they checked me in anyways. I went down to complain and there were 30 some people down in the hotel lobby complaining about the hot water. I finally got my room changed about 10pm at night. What a vacation. Then when we got to our new room, there were no towels and it was smaller than the original room. When I went to the desk, I was told that the laundry is sent to Orlando and the truck hasn't come in yet. I was able to get a few towels, but no washcloths for 3 days! The next day I called to see when my room would be cleaned, since when I booked it a year ago, I was told it would have housekeeping included. The woman laughed and said "honey you must clean your own room, wash your own towels, and take out your trash!!!" So I paid over $300.00 a night for nothing. The next morning I again went to the front desk and was given free dinner tickets for all my problems. So my family went to dinner the next evening. We ordered chicken, and actually got 4 plates of completely raw chicken. We returned it to the kitchen and they were very apologetic, but my kids got up walked out and went to Burger King. They did make sure they took pictures of their raw chicken!!The next day we went to Disney and came back at midnight to no parking spots. One day we lost power in our room. You definitely don't get what you pay for here at this hotel. The staff got to know me because of my frequent complaints, and they stated since they changed hands from Fairfield to Wyndham, the hotel has gone downhill. They fired most of their housekeeping staff. The staff hates it. They laugh about the inservice they must attend where they learn about MAGIC-making a good impression on the customer. This hotel makes an impression on the customer, but not a good one. You must go down to the desk for toilet paper or anything else you might run out of. Its a joke of a vacation staying here. I saved up all year to take my kids on this trip with their friends, and I was thoroughly disgusted. I have stayed at alot of hotels before, but this is definitley the worst. There were parties down the hall with kids getting arrested. It was very loud. There were missing pictures on the wall, just nails in the wall, the sliding glass door to the balcony didn't shut properly, so we were left with sand flies all over our room every morning. And you would think when a different company takes over, customers would be notified since it doesn't include the same things as when the room was booked. If it had housekeeping when it was booked, it should have it when I stay there or my price should be reduced. The owners of shops in Ocean Walk also laugh about the hotel. They say when they have friends and family come down, they won't let them stay at Ocean Walk because its so bad, they stay at the Hilton. The security is a joke. I also picked this hotel because it was supposedly safe and you needed your key to get into the hotel, parking garage and into the pool area. There was never a security guard at the pool gates. The gates were always open There were always kids walking around from different hotels. The elevator waits were sometimes 10 minutes long. We were told during spring break to take the stairs, but we were on the 23rd floor. I would never go to a Wyndham Hotel again.

<Title>“Great stay”
<Content>We just returned today from a little getaway to Daytona Beach. This was my first time staying at a condo type stay and the experience was very good, I would stay here again. The view and amenities were excellent. A few things: Believe them when they tell you that checking in is at 4pm. You might want to stack up on food for the little kitchen as the Fairfield does not have a good restaurant and the little bar area is very minimal, mainly just for snacks.

<Title>“Ocean Walk - end of March”
<Content>We recently returned from a week a Ocean Walk. We were met there by our daughter and family , which includes two small children (age 1 and 4). When I read the reviews of this resort I wonder if they are talking about the same one I stayed at. You must remember this is a time share resort not a hotel. Very few time shares have maid service. If you want that you can stay in a small room and eat out, at a very high price. Otherwise, in a time share you have a generous amount of space and the convenience of doing your own cooking and saving money, not to mention the ability to work the nap times for children into the eating schedule. We arrived early and were pre registered. After returning from lunch at the shopping area beside the resort we were able to check into our two bedroom unit. ( We were given a temp. parking pass card which allowed us to park our car in the 8 story parking garage attached.) Check in was relatively fast and the unit was in a very clean state. Any problems, such as, missing kitchen ware, burned out bulbs or other minor issues were settled quickly. It was spring break time so it was a bit crowded but that was not the fault of the resort as indicated in some reviews. It apprears to me that some of the reviewers are expecting too much from a resort and life is not always perfect.

<Title>“great place to stay, but perhaps not during spring break next year”
<Content>We stayed at Ocean Walk the week of March 18th-24th and really enjoyed our stay over all, but I do have to say there were some things that really needed some attention and I hope the next time we go, things will be better since it has only been a few months since Wyndham bought this resort from FairField. Check in for us was to be 2:00 pm since we are owners with Fairfield/Wyndham and have vip status.. Well, we got behind about 6 other families and waited while 1 girl worked to get everyone squared away with their reservations, meanwhile, the non vip line had 4 people working and they were getting people through very quickly. When we got our turn, we were told that there was a "issue" with the room we were supposed to be in on the 13th floor, so they were going to have to put us in a room on the 9th floor (#928 North Tower) but the room wasn't ready yet, so we would need to wait and were told we could walk around and get familiar with the resort. We did and came back about 40 minutes later and still the room was not ready. I asked for the keys anyway and said that we at least wanted to get our stuff out of the car andneeded the key to get into the garage. The only way to get a luggage cart was to pay a bellhop to do it for you, they guard those things with their life. Our room was large and overall very clean and well kept, with the exception of the cracked toilet seat in the master bath OUCH! and the broken handle on the microwave and the screen door on the balcony that was unable to open and close. The jacuzzi drained while you were in it, so you had to keep adding water to it. I think the thing that upset me the most was the totally disassembled smoke detector in the master bedroom. i mean, someone had pulled wires and all. This bothered me immediately and was never fixed even after reporting it. Ironically, on Tuesday morning at 6:00 a.,m. the alert speaker that is also in the room, went off and we all quickly got shoes on and gathered at the door and went downstairs with many of the other guests from the resort, seems there was a small fire in the trash chute of the south tower! On the flip side, I have to say that the resort is very nice. The pool did get crowded early and this time of year it was with all the spring breakers that were hung over from the all night partying they did the night before, but the pools are nice, the beach area is great and the indoor pools are also nice. The folks at the bars are really nice and were really sweet with my young girls who were ordering Virgin Pina Colads all week. We will definately be going back there, but we already know that we don't want to go back during spring break. We will let the partiers have their fun and then show up...

<Title>“Has really gone downhill”
<Content>I have stayed at this property numerous times it has always been wonderful but my most recent stay was anything but pleasant. First, the room was not clean, carpet badly stained, sagging beds, and sagging sofa. There were no towels as in none in the room. Contacted housekeeping 5 times and the manager twice and finally got towels which were delivered with an attitute at 1:00AM in the morning. Dishwasher fell out on the floor when I opened the door. Ice Maker is frig broke. And no spoons in the silverware drawer and when housekeeping brought us 4, for our party of 8, they were dirty with food stuck on them. They now close the pool at 10 PM or no more taking a relaxing swim after visiting the Disney Parks. The pools used to be 24 hour. You also now have to wear these paper wristbands to use the pool. If you are disabled as I am beware. There is not adequate handicapped parking. I arrived back at the hotel around 10PM one evening and could not find parking and was told by the hotel to get back earlier if I wanted a parking place. Wyndam has taking over the property but it is under the same management as before. It appears that some corporate housekeeping needs to be done to improve management. I have posted pictures of the sagging beds, stained carpet, etc This will be my last stay at this property.

<Title>“Not as good the second time”
<Content>We had plans to stay three night at the this hotel & after hours we decided we could not stay in this enviorment. The rooms next door to us where filled with fifteen teens & under age drinking, loud partying all night long. Then we went to the pool filled with teens making out, drinking, swearing. We went to front desk and got charged for 1/2 day & hit the road. Would not recommend this time around. Last year we loved it. But it went down hill fast. Reconsider if you have values & young kids.

<Title>“Not All Its Cracked Up To Be”
<Content>My husband and I were very disapointed in this suppose to be up-scale resort. Our room had walls that were dirty. Lamps did not work. We had no coffee maker in our room. When asked to bring us one it took such a long time and person was rude that finally gave us one. Carpet was really bad. Phone did not work. We are just really disapointed in our stay there. We like the shops and theatre near us, but next time we will stay at the Hilton next door.

<Title>“dirty rooms !!”
<Content>The rooms smelled of smoke, empty beer bottles in our cupboards, the garbage can in the middle of the room, cushions off our saggy couch, toe nail clipping on the stained carpet and the stove elements out of the stove top. And this was after waiting 1 hour past check in because they were apparently cleaning our room and the inspector was checking it out !!! Oh did I forget to mention the pubic hair on the sheets that should have been changed and the blood on the pillow case !! We ofcourse demanded another room and they did give us one, too late to leave the hotel but we will never stay there again. Wish I had read the reviews ( all of them ). Take my advise read all the reviews. The negative ones are closest to the truth.

<Title>“Good week in Daytona”
<Content>We booked into Fairfield Ocean Walk Resort through RCI Timeshare. We rang from the UK to say we would be getting into Daytona on Sunday morning 18th.Feb. and had tickets for the Daytona 500 Race, they suggested we take the car to their parking and get their shuttle to the races. This worked great, no parking hastle at the races, we booked into our room when we got back. The staff could not have been more helpful, the rooms clean and well furnished, the restaurant was good and reasonable priced. BUT - as it was timeshare accomodation the rooms were on the inside of the hotel, no outside window, so you lived in artificial light all the time in the rooms, you had no idea whether it was sunny or raining without going down 9 floors to the lobby to look outside. But apart from this gripe we had a good week in Daytona. A. Carter. Stratford-on-Avon, England.

<Title>“3rd stay - All is well at Oceanwalk!”
<Content>Third stay at Fairfield (now Wyndham) Oceanwalk during speedweek (2/12/07 - 2/19/07). Stayed most of the time in a 2 bedroom deluxe unit. No problems with the unit. Everything was in good working order and very, very clean. I am posting pictures taken from our room. Please note, some rooms, I believe they contain a B in the room number, do not have a balcony or window to the outside. They face the interior hallway. You may want to inquire about your room type before you book the room. In addition, there are some rooms that do have a balcony but do not have an ocean view. We stayed in 2 different rooms during this trip. Both were in the north tower. In addition to the 2 bedroom deluxe, which faced north (beach view if we look to the right) we spent our last couple nights in a 1 bedroom deluxe which faced south, actually we had a view of the other tower and the lobby area. We didn't mind at all. I do not have photos of the one bedroom deluxe unit but it was also very clean, well appointed and everything was in good working order. Both rooms had a jacuzzi tub. Things to consider - I am not sure if this is true for all staying at this resort but we stayed as part of our timeshare/points system. There is no daily maid service. If you want a touch up, they will come and do that for a fee. Your bed will not be made unless you do it. You will not get fresh towels everyday. For touch up cleaning you are provided with a washer and dryer in your room, a vaccum cleaner, a dishwasher, a broom and a mop. They give you enough laundry soap for two loads and an adequate amount of paper towels, dish soap and dishwasher detergent. If you expect someone to come and bring you fresh towels and make your bed it is not going to happen (unless it is different for some folks renting rooms not as timeshares). If you are not sure if this applies to you, ask before you book your trip. If this (not happening) will ruin your trip you might want to stay somewhere else. If you enjoy a clean place with all of the ammenities you could imagine then stay here. Enjoy the 2 outdoor pools, outdoor kiddie pool, 3 hot tubs, lazy river, beach, Vacation Therapy Spa, 2 indoor pools, indoor mini-golf, restaurants and bars ALL ON SITE.

<Title>“Horrible Customer Service”
<Content>I must preface this review by indicating that I haven't even arrived at the resort yet. I booked a seven night stay on the Internet about a week ago. Relatively simple. I have since discovered that I will be arriving a day early. I attempted to book an extra night on the Internet. Since the time I needed required I book at least two nights, I couldn't complete the reservation. I called the resort. The automated answering machine transfered me all over the country to various booking agents all of whom told me I had to contact the resort directly to get the additional night on the existing booking. I have since called the resort directly Every Day for the last six days. Six Days!!! I've called in the morning, afternoon and evening. 7:15am, 11:00am, 3:00pm, 6:00pm, 11:00pm and even 1:00am. Each time I'm told the front desk is busy and they are not answering. I even left a message with my return number at the request of the hotel operator who assured me that someone would call me. That was 2 days ago, I still haven't heard a word. I will be arriving in Daytona Beach in a few weeks. At this rate I will likely be sleeping in the lobby the first night. It amazes me that an outfit such as this which bends over backwards to solicit Vacation Ownership in this resort has taken such a stance on customer service. I'm pretty much committed to my existing reservation so I'll stay there this time but unless there is some amazing excuse for such ridiculous service it will be my last.

<Title>“Good as it gets in Daytona”
<Content>A guest and I just came back from a two night stay and have to say that our experience was very good. This is a slow season which may have explained the very quick service and no elevator problems tha many reviews complained about. Our rooms were good, very clean. We had the ocean fromt balcony rooms on the 15th floor so the view was great. A couple of small maintenance problems were handled quickly and well. We did not use any of the spa or exercise rooms so can't coment on them. Reading prior reviews both good and bad made us apprehensive about what we would find on check in but we were pleasantly surprised and would return at the first opportunity.

<Title>“wonderful stay”
<Content>We just returned from a week long stay at the Ocean Walk. After reading all the reviews I was a little apprehensive, but we had a wonderful stay. We arrived Jan. 27th and were able to check in before the 4pm check in time. We had a one bed room unit and it was very nice-we loved having a washer and dryer. We never had any problems with the elevators- I do realize we were there in January,not July. The front desk staff was very friendly and nice to us-no problems at all. Most mornings we ate breakfast in our condo, but one morning we tried the restaurant downstairs-they had an omlet special for $4.99 and it was great-included home fries and toast-enough for two to share. We would return here for another visit.

<Title>“Great place to take your family”
<Content>We stayed at the Ocean Walk Resort in Daytona from Dec 27th, 2006 to Jan. 4th, 2007. We were two families, 4 adults and 4 children staying in a 2 bedroom ocean front lockout, south tower on the 5th floor. After reading all the reviews that are posted we were a bit worried about staying here. When we checked in they were going to put us on the 22nd floor but we asked for a lower floor and they accomodated us without a problem. We had two kitchens with all the amenities and two washer and dryer's. Even the dishwashing soap, laundry detergent and soap for the dishwasher was provided. Most of the reviews said to not expect any housekeeping and it was a problem to get towels. Of the 7 days only twice did housekeeping not come to our room and give us new towels they even offered to make our beds. The other days we called and had towels brought to our rooms within a half hour. This resort has it all and perfectly located. We would definitely stay here again.

<Title>“A Complete Disaster”
<Content>After spending the first afternoon searching for a clean room(the first one had a big dirt spot on living room and bedroom carpet),we thought we found one until my daughter went to take a shower and found hair in the bathtub and powder on the towels. Next morning the next room we got into was better but not great. It didn't have all the pots and pans for the kitchen. It took over 10 hours to get sheets for the sofa sleeper. We have had problems with room service-- only 2 out of the 8 nights we stayed here. The only poeple how seemed to care was customer service(I THINK ANYWAY). The only thing they are worried about is selling time shares and not taking care of guest.

<Title>“Horrendous service with the reservation company Extra Holidays!!!”
<Content>Instead of crediting me for a cancellation , they charged me two more times. Customer service is condenscending and supervisors are either out of the office or entertaining guests. The resort was just as bad, saying their records showed that I checked in and stayed there. It was finally resolved by someone at the resort itself and I just called the resort to see if I could book directly through them instead of Extra Holidays for our rescheduled trip, and they said no, they could care less about the bad service from Extra Holidays, no apologies, nothing! Also, if you make a reservation by phone instead of on line, Extra Holidays charges you an extra $5.00 a night, which they did not refund me. Now that I'm unhappy, I'll mention another negative. When we did stay there, my 3 yr old got sick at about midnight, and I could not get a pack of crackers or anything. They do not have a single vending machine and the unfriendly staff looked at me as if I was crazy when I asked if they might be able to get some from the restaurant or the gift shop.

<Title>“Offseason Bliss!”
<Content>We stayed at the Fairfield in early December, which is Daytona's "off season". To refute all the negative reviews, I must say that the resort was clean, the staff friendly and courteous, (especially the concierge) and the elevators were swift and smooth. If you want a great breakfast, try their buffet which includes a lady that makes fantastic omlettes! The dinner buffet, however, leaves a bit to be desired. I suggest trying one of the better restaurants in the area (Chart House, etc.), as the rest are mediocre. In the slow time, everyone on staff has time to cater to your needs and the atmosphere is cheery. Our room's furniture was colorful and eclectic, but not very comfortable, except for the beds, which were excellent. All in all, if you want to relax in Daytona, "offseason" is the time to go!

<Title>“Great View! It's near the pier,shops and movies.”
<Content>We stayed at the Ocean Walk Resort, Farfield ,for a little over a week during Thanksgiving 2006. We had read some complaints that the property was dirty. We did not find this to be so. The view, design of the rooms and location were fantastic. Yu are near the pier,arcades, shops and movies. Starbucks is a half a block away. We are from Portland,Oregon so we really enjoyed our morning latte. Some thoughts on the resort:: The design and architectural style of the resort is first class but it is not kept up as well as it should be and the staff although friendly aren't very attention oriented. They seemed lazy and not interested in resolving problems. I booked my stay for a week but later called to extend my stay by one night. They told me they would have to cancel my reservation and start again. If they did this there was a chance I would lose the whole reservation and no t be able to have the upper floor, ocean front unit I wanted. Since we booked six months ahead and I didn't want to lose my reservation, I didn't want to do this. At check-in I again asked to extend the stay. They said I could but would have to come down early on the check-out day to do this. I wanted to avoid getting up early and avoid the check-out lines so I tried to do it the night before. The desk-clertk said it was a done deal but the next day they called me twice, saying why haven't I checked out. My key also didn't work, after keying it twice. The maid also knocked on the door at 10:00 to make sure we were leaving,,when we weren't. It just seemed a little tacky and rude. Customers didn't come first. We had a very pretty two bedroom condo. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were very quiet with good black-out curtains. Although very well designed to look top quality, it had a broken armoir, a kitchen faucet that sprayed the counter, leaky tub and a dryer that you had to slam multiple times to close. At check-out I gave the repairs list to the front staff and they didn't seem to care or say they would get on it. The lazy river wasn't heated ( and it was thanksgiving vacation) and since it was cold out, the lifequard wasn't at the slide most of the day. It seems like they were trying to save money by hiring an unpolised front desk staff and defering maintence. Since many rooms are on a timeshare program, they seemed more interested in getting the money than keeping it or providing a quality vacation. Many of the hotels in Daytona are upgrading and refurbishing themselves, soon competetion will be tough.On a positive note, many child activities, arts and crafts were offered. The game room was fun. They had a large TV with Gamecube and Nintendo. There was free mini-golf and if you have teens, its near the movies and shops so you wouldn't need to drvie. Good restaurants are within walking distance. I recomment seeing the manatees at Blue Springs State Park, the Space Center and a trip to St. Augustines. We also went to the alligator/croc farm near St. Augustines. Great fun!

We arrived about 10 pm Sat evening, no lines for check-in, we were given a 1 bedroom deluxe in the North Tower on the 18th floor. What a beautiful unit we saw when we opened the door. It was not ocean view but city view - we were still impressed. It was 750 sq ft - nice full kitchen, great tropical colors, two huge overstuffed chairs and sofa in living room, balcony with great view of city and river. Masterbedroom was huge, and the largest bathroom I have ever saw with a huge glass shower stall and huge jacuzzi tube, two complete vanities with sinks. The next day we enjoyed the crystal clear pool and lazy river. This was a great week to visit since the resort was about half full. No problem with lines anywhere, the pool and lazy river were not full at all. The entire resort was spotless. Only had rain on one day, we used the indoor pool of the North tower, very nice probably 40 or 50 foot pool. We attended a sales presentation on the day it rained, was told it was 90 min long, but only took 40 minutes max. We did not buy but did receive $80 in dinner vouchers to use. The resort is perfect for anyone. If you like it quiet, go when kids are in school as we did, otherwise if you have kids go at prime time, either way you will enjoy yourself.

<Title>“Beach Lover”
<Content>Ive stayed at the Ocean Walk probably about 15 times. Yes there are some minor issues with some things, such as elevators, and the beach towels..but there has never been a problem with our service, very nice people. It is also in a convient location. Would recommend for families with children!

<Title>“Wonderful vacation”
<Content>Spent Labor Day at Oceanwalk with my husband and our two kids and my sister and her husband and son. We had a three bedroom unit. The pool needed some work, but Labor Day is the end of the high season, so I can understand that they can't close the pools to fix anything until the high season is over. As always had a great time. We tend to set up shop down on the beach, so I don't know about the problems reserving poolside lounges. Beach was great; there is now an ice cream wagon parked on the beach most of the day right in front of the hotel, which is convenient. We bought the lunch by the pool every day; it's really convenient. The steak sandwich is a steak, not sliced steak, a small individual steak on a bun. At $6, it's a steal! They will cook the steaks rare and they were delicious. There were fireworks at about 9:30 on Saturday night, which we watched from our balcony. Very impressive; it lasted about 20 - 30 minutes and had some cool effects. The kids all loved it. The arts and crafts were fun; our whole family made stained glass, which are now proudly displayed on our kitchen window... I highly recommend this hotel. My sister and her husband also loved it and are considering buying with Fairfield Resorts, which owns the hotel. I have noticed the many negative comments recently posted and I was a bit nervous, but we had no major problems. Our room was clean and tidy. It needed some work, but again, it was the end of high season, and most of the major fixing up is done during slow season. We have already booked a long weekend for next year. Kathryn

<Title>“WOW!! OceanWalk is the best.”
<Content>Couldn't have been a nicer vacation. Especially the Tiki Hut bar by the ocean. Beautiful full moon and the atmosphere was perfectly romantic. The rooms are grounds were immaculately clean and the staff superb. Restaurants, 10 screen theater, bars, amusement park.

<Title>“Very Disappointed!!”
<Content>I am not surprised to see all of the bad reviews here. Every bad review is right on!! Now I am going to add mine. My husband, myself and my twin 6 year old daughters were so excited to come here as our last vacation of the summer before the girls started school. What a mistake coming here. From the minute we arrived it was a disaster!! We arrived around 4:30 pm. Check in was chaotic. The bellman brought our bags to our room......he was coming down the hallway leaving our room and my husband asked him if we were "all set"?? He replied, "well, almost, your room was never cleaned". He said that, and just kept right on walking. He never offered to call someone for us, or try to help us out in anyway. When we walked into our room, I honestly thought I went into a state of shock. We travel quite a bit, and I am not exxagerating when I say that this room was disgusting!!! The room had a bad odor, the carpeting was filthy with crumbs, etc. None of the beds were made up and all of the bedding was in piles all over the floor. The bathtub was filled with dirty towels. The kitchen was full of garbage and dirty dishes. As we were walking throughout the room, my daughter found a spider on the rug, my husband found a dirty shoe (yes, I said SHOE) in the room safe!!! I feel like I could go on and on about the condition of this room and how bad it was. When they finally sent someone up to clean it, they told us it would take about 40 minutes to clean, which I thought they would have had to have been miracle workers. We didn't get into our room until 7:30 pm. The supervisor at the front desk acted like this whole thing was "no big deal". She then offered me a gift certificate at the restaurant in the hotel for breakfast. No thanks....the food was cafeteria food at best. We went for breakfast the following morning to the Hilton....just down the street. Wish we would have stayed there. The pools were dirty looking/stained as was the pool deck. Everything just looked run down. I would never, ever stay here again even if they offered me to stay for a week free!!!! People.....don't believe what you see and read on Ocean Walk Resort web page.......they make everything look really nice and clean, etc. and it is the complete opposite. If you are staying in Daytona, I would recommend staying at the Hilton. Okay, there was one good thing about this trip...........LEAVING!!!!

<Title>“For the price, not worth it.”
<Content>Stayed at the Ocean Walk on August 10-14. In town for a baseball tournament. Upon arrival, we were impressed, however the front desk staff seemed VERY somber at best and did not want to bother to answer any questions. When asked if our room had a balcony, it took three people to even find out the answer. They want all questions to be referred to reservations. Room was clean when we arrived.....................and it was not cleaned again by housekeeper. They did change the towels but not the floors, tubs etc. They took our pool towels which the resort charges you 15.00 a piece for. Never could get housekeepingon phone or front desk. The hotel is really over booked on weekends - they try to sell timeshares to anyone and everyone and their aunts uncles grandmothers - so the place is teeming with kids running amuck. SO crowded it was not enjoyable. Pools were cloudy and needed to be cleaned twice a day. Hotel restaurant was very over priced. I call a place like this a tourist trap. Daytona Beach needs a overhaul. Seedy at best.

<Title>“Very, very pleased”
<Content>After booking our trip in January 2006, then reading all the reviews on the web for Ocean Walk I was very apprehensive about staying there. I even called our travel agent on the Friday before we were to travel to see what to do if we had trouble. Needless to say, I was thrilled when we got there with how pleasant the place was. I really don't understand all the complaints. We arrived at 4 p.m. and was told our room was not ready, that it would be another half hour or so. We went to Bubba Gumps and had a late lunch/early dinner. When we went back our room was ready. The bellman came to our car in the parking gargage and then took us to our room. It was very clean, pleasant, had a balcony facing the ocean that I could have spent my entire vacation on. I didn't think the beach was overly crowded. We spent a little time in the pools and I was not disappointed with them. All the staff that we dealt with were very pleasant and polite. We had clean towels every day. Our beds were made only once but I didn't expect anything else. The kitchen was very nice with everything we could possibly need. We went to Wal-Mart and bought food for a couple of meals a day and anything else we needed and settled in. We had a very good time. If I were to travel to Florida again I would stay at Ocean Walk.

<Title>“Had a great time at Ocean Walk!!”
<Content>We stayed for a week through the timeshare and had a very good experience with the place. We got a room on the 19th floor and when we got up there realized that it would not work with our little kids so I went back down and asked to be moved and they were able to put us in a 5th floor, oceanfront room! We had to wait an hour for it to be cleaned but it was well worth it to us. The elevators are very slow, bad design. The first day expect to wait for 15-30 minutes for one, after that it really isn't that bad of a wait, couple of minutes at most. The pools are great, They get filled up pretty fast so we just ate an early dinner and got in when everyone else was eating. The only complaint is the parents who let their kids run wild and ruin the place for everyone else. That is not the resorts fault, it's just to bad. They changed the policy on the pool chairs on our second to last day. In the past the people would line up to grab every chair by 8am but on Friday they changed it to a policy of, the security walks by and puts a red tag on your saved chair, if you are not back in 30 minutes, the towels and things are taken to the new "sun center" and you can retrieve them there. We were actually able to get a chair very easily after that. I just hope they keep it up. I guess its no wonder there are wild kids with no supervision when they see their parents act so selfish and snatch up all the chairs they can get and then not use for hours! Overall, we would definately go back to this resort. Plenty to do within walking distance and the beach is great!! Rooms were clean and well stocked. We had a wonderful stay!!

<Title>“Will Not Be Back!”
<Content>This was our 3rd visit to Oceanwalk and will be the last. It has grown too fast and no one seems to know what to do. The morning races to put towels on the deck chairs is way too funny. There are signs that say only tubes in the Lazy River but parents just watch as their children bump into people while using it as a kiddy pool. You spend half your time waiting on the elevators. Rooms are never ready when they are to be. Everything there is not worth the rude guest and their rude children.

<Title>“Very disappointed”
<Content>I am one of the other 6 rooms that (HORRIBLE OVERALL /Jul31) is talking about...I just want to verify their story. The lazy river was not lazy, their were so many people in it in the afternoon, you could not see the water most of the time. We never saw housekeeping our entire stay, even after 3 calls and a visit to the front desk... On our 3rd day there, after a visit to the frontdesk complaining about no housekeeping we returned to the room to find a stack of towels on the bed, the old ones on the floor were gone, but nothing else was touched. No clean glasses, no coffee , no beds made, no soap..nothing..The only time we actually saw housekeeping was on our checkout day and they knocked on the door around 9:00 wondering when we were leaving..It is a beautiful location and they have 5 pools, but with service and attitude like theirs, they are on a downhill run. We have stayed at a lot of resorts in Florida since my family goes to a different one every year, and I have never been to a place with such an( I dont care attitude). If you are looking for a relaxing family vacation, dont go here. We never will.

<Title>“Horrible Overall!!”
<Content>We had 6 families each book a room with this resort. As soon as we walked through the doors it was down hill from there. We arrived at 4:30p.m. Check in was at 4:00p.m. After waiting for an elevator for 15 minutes just to get to the lobby to check in, then to wait for another 15 minutes for an elevator to get up to our room on the 8th floor, we finally get there and can not get into our room because housekeeping was still in there cleaning our room. We then had to sit in the hallway with all of our luggage for another 15 minutes, only to wait for a smelly, dirty, room with broken blinds, half of the light bulbs out and a broken balcony door. By the time we actually got into our room it was 6:30p.m. between elevators and checking-in. Again what a huge disappoint after all of that wait. Called twice about the broken blinds in the bedroom facing the hallways, they never came. Finally put an extra sheet over the window to keep people from looking in. The room smelled so bad that we didn't even want to eat in it. Very poor housekeeping. It also smelled like smoke. This was just the beginning. The staff was very, very rude and was not at all accomodating. The restaurant within the resort is a complete joke. The food and service was horrible. All the kids activities they advertise can only accomodate approx. 20 kids per activity. With the size of the resort you would think they would accomodate more, and did not care that your cildren could not attend. The pools were green and hot. There was no room to move and if you wanted a seat by the pool you better plan on waking up at about 6:30am to catch an elevator down to the pool to stand in line with everyone else to enter the pool area at 8:00am at which time the pool opens. At 8:00am people are scrambling to chairs like little ants to get a chair. The whole resort was flat dirty, especially the pools and pool areas. If you like to wake up to the sun rising be prepared for the wonderful sounds of the pressure cleaners cleaning the pool deck which they do from 6:00am through 8:00am. Teenagers from all over Daytona Beach were entering this resort to use the pools. If you like to hang around thousands of teens this would be the place to stay. If you would like some quiet, quality with your family, please do not waste your money. All six families we had there were fooled by their web-site. Don't let it happen to you. Even the bellhops said how terrible the elevator wait is at this resort. None of us will ever return to this resort.

<Title>“DO NOT Trust Your Luggage to Bellhop or Staff!!!”
<Content>I arrived at the Ocean Walk Resort in Daytona Beach on Wednesday, March 22 around 1:30 pm with my friend who also stayed with me. Our party that the room name was under did not arrive until 5:00 later that evening. Upon my arrival, my friend and I checked our luggage with the bellman to put into storage until our friends had checked in. Both my friend and I changed from our airport clothes into our bathing suits and put the clothes and bathing suits we decided not to wear that day, back inside our suitcases. This is the last time I saw all my valuables that went missing when I recieved my luggage back. I had my pillow strapped in on top of all my packed clothes. My jeans and belt, bathing suits and skirt, and wristlet that were presumably stolen were placed on top of the pillow , NOT under the straps, or in the easily-accessable mesh compartment under the suitcase lid. Unfortunately, when I reclaimed my luggage, many items were missing. A list of what was missing and approximate value: -Bebe Jeans ($125) -American Eagle belt ($39) -Pink Coach wristlet ($68) -Bebe black rhinestone bathing suit ($85) -Polo Ralph Lauren black bathing suit ($95) -Hollister rhinestone jean skirt ($48) It is unfortunate these items are not covered under insurance as the resort suggested... it just saddens me because I bought these items with my own money, most of them for my exciting Spring Break adventure at the OceanWalk Resort, and I ended up losing items (approx.$460 worth) totaling more than my 5 night stay at the resort ($236). When we arrived early and couldn't check-in, I didn't even give a second thought to not trust the resort to hold my luggage. But the fact that the items missing were the easiest to access because of their location in my suitcase leads me to conclude they were taken during the time they were under the supervision of the resort. *** Also, when we handed our luggage over to the bellman, we were told they would be brought up to our rooms upon check-in. I had to call down to the front desk to inquire about my luggage, and with no results, then go down and ask about my luggage because it still hadn't arrived in our room an hour or more after our party checked-in at approximately 5:00---and we were getting worried! ***** After 4 months now of communicating (phone calls, emails and paperwork) with the resort staff and management and doing everything they suggested (filing a police report with the Daytona Beach Police; filing a claim with their insurance company) it seems Ocean Walk Resort Management has elected to ignore my communications and thus take no responsibility for my loss while my valuables were in their possession.

<Title>“Okay, but be ready for a sales pitch...”
<Content>We had never been to Daytona and were finishing a vacation that started at Walt Disney World, so we were looking for calm and quiet. We checked in on Wednesday and checked out on Sunday. Check in was okay. We stayed in the condo tower. Our main complaint was that we kept getting pushed to go to a sales meeting on Saturday to encourage us to buy a unit (which we had no plans to do). As mentioned by others, chairs at the pool are all but impossible to obtain unless you go down at 8am to "reserve" a chair by placing a towel on it. After doing this one day, we decided the beach was much preferable (cooler, less crowded, and less obnoxious). We didn't use the "lazy river" but it was not supervised by hotel staff in any way, that we could see. We saw no rules being enforced. The beach is lovely with a sandbar just off shore which made the ocean less anxiety-ridden for those with little ocean experience. It was expensive to rent umbrellas and chairs (two chairs and an umbrella for $25) but we did this one day and were glad to have spent the money. Weekends are a MADHOUSE! Friday evening, the hotel started to fill up. Obnoxious kids were running the hallways until about 11pm, hitting windows (which open onto the hallway from the bedrooms), and making lots of noise. Elevators were almost impossible. My husband lost his driver's license while there and needed a police report for our return flight home. The hotel security staff was hard to get hold of. He waited in the lobby for a long time before anyone came to assist him. When they DID come, they claimed to call the local police, who were supposed to come to the hotel to make a report. No one ever came, even after prompting several times to the hotel staff, and finally we were encouraged to go to the police station in town. When we went there, we were informed that the Beach Patrol takes care of such problems and they are available ON THE BEACH, JUST OUTSIDE THE HOTEL! My husband and I wasted about 2-3 hours just trying to get this taken care of. We couldn't believe that the hotel staff would not know to direct us to the (very accessible) Beach Patrol. We enjoyed the beach, the hotel was okay, you had to figure out how to get towels (on the bottom floor by the indoor pool) and then wash and dry them yourself so that you would have them for the week. We LOVED having a washer/dryer in the room. We went home with mostly clean clothes! The little "mall" just south of the hotel was good for eating (Bubba Gump's and Adobe Gila's were our favorites). Drinks at the bar by the pool were expensive and nasty tasting. The food bar inside was handy and okay.

<Title>“very bad customer service!!!”
<Content>Was one of the worst customer service's I've ever seen. We got there early before 4 and I had asked if we could check in early, the lady was rude and I wasn't even arguing with her. Then when we did get to check in at 4pm. The room was filthy hadn't even been cleaned at all. They said they couldn't get anyone to clean it for a couple of hours. Then the a/c didn't work. The staff at first was very unaccomadating. After my husband went and complained and talked to the person who was in charge we ended up getting our one night we stayed there (because my husband had a business meeting there) for free. So they were ok with getting our money back. The hotel itself is really nice lots and lots of stuff for kids to do. The rooms were ok..but didn't think they were that great for the money you pay. The pool was very nice and the lazy river and the water slide..but it was very crowded..but that happens anywhere when you go during vacation time.

<Title>“do not stay here!”
<Content>I would not recommend this resort to anyone looking for a relaxing and fun vacation - the entire staff is very rude and it took over 1 hour to check in and then there was multiple problems with the 2 bedroom unit we stayed in - had a ant problem not thoroughly clean - overall, not a very nice room - The is no such thing as housekeeping - the only time we received any housekeeping is when we called to complain and then they took out the trash and that was it - we complained multiple times to management who said he would definitely get back with us but he never did - the pool area has about 400 chairs which are already taken by 8 am - people line up like vultures at the crack of dawn to put their towels on the chairs and good luck getting a chair, it is impossible. the beach is extremely overcrowded, you can rent 2 chaises and a unbrella for $25 a day, which is ridiculous. Their were cigarette butts floating in the pools - the elevators are dirty and dont always work properly. When I called to book this trip, I asked many questions, they told me I didnt need to bring anything with me, including beach towels, chairs, bath towels, soap, etc. Well, half the time there was no clean towels available - I was so disappointed in this resort, the restaurant is a complete joke, rude staff terrible food - it is like a food court area - The security is very lacking and the manager personally stated this to us - for the price of what we paid, we were definitely ripped off - We saved all year for this trip and feel really cheated - I would not recommend this hotel to anyone!

<Title>“Weekend crowds, Understaffed”
<Content>This hotel has lots to do. But on Saturdays it is SO CROWDED!!! Kids LOVED the lazy river. But I felt the "lazy river" became a loud, crazy zone of wild, unruly children pushing and shoving and turning it into bumper cars, with many "tube-jackings" (kids stealing inner tubes). Fortunately my usually quiet children stuck up for themselves and managed to maintain inner tubes long enough to enjoy themselves. The sign stated "children under 12 must be supervised" so I went in the River with them the first few times, but when I realized I was the ONLY adult in there being shoved & splashed, I quickly learned that the rule was not enforced. The bar at the pool served hotdogs and hamburgers, but we waited for 40 minutes by the scorching grill to get 3 hot dogs for $12. The beach was also EXTREMELY crowded. The beach chairs and umbrellas are not a part of the hotel and you must pay extra to rent them. We chose not to and just played in the ocean. On Sunday, things settled down a bit. We were actually able to get an elevator with only a 5 minute wait (15 minute waits were the norm on Saturday). We don't mind walking but they put us on the 17th floor). The lazy river was almost lazy instead of crazy on Sunday and Monday. The biggest problem that I did not plan for was the lack of POOL TOWELS! BRING YOUR OWN! OR, get a nice supply first thing in the morning and stash them in your room, or use the dryer to dry & re-use. You will NOT get pool towels past 10am... no matter what the staff tells you. They say "wait here I will be right back (even managers) and you never see them again, and no one comes with any towels. All in all, I would stay there again, but ONLY ON A WEEK DAY. Saturdays are too busy and too understaffed!

<Title>“Poor Service / Rude Employees”
<Content>Two family vacation stay July 4th week at the Ocean Walk Resort in Daytona. When we booked the vacation a year in advance, we were very excited about our vacation. After 1 day at the Ocean Walk, I though we were being punished. The service was almost non existent. Except for the rude Front Desk operator. It didn't matter who answered the phone (when they did) the employees were very rude and uncaring. The room we were suppose to get (we called to confirm on more than one occasion) was to be an ocean front but when we checked in after an hour standing in the VIP line, we were put in a room overlooking the alley with a construction dumpster right under our window. The housekeeping was paid for but we never rec'd anything. There were several things that should have been in the room but when we called to have someone bring them to the room (if someone answered the phone) it would be several hours and serveral phone calls later before it was delivered. I agree with the other reviews about the pool. There was not a chair available the whole week we were there. I had to purchase an umbrella on the beach for 25 dollars a day. Parking is a fright too. After a week of punishment I was ready to go home.

<Title>“Oceanview busy but great......”
<Content>.....We stayed at the Ocean Walk mid June myself, my husband and 2 children aged 10 and 3 years old........ We had an excellent 1 bedroom unit with fantastic ocean views...we checked in early about 11.30am and there was no problem at all....were told our room was ready and waiting.......we were very pleased with the room which had a full kitchen even down to a washer & dryer. The views were to die for, we were on the 17th floor which i was a little concerned about with having a very active 3 year old, as the balcony wall and rails were quite low, but our patio doors were quite difficult to open for myself, and my husband as the runners were slightly faulty, due to the salt air.......the beds were very comfortable, and good quality bedding.....A beautiful bathroom with plently of towels, the only bad thing about the bathroom was the cheap shower curtain rail, which with the slightess touch would fall from the walls.......but luckily my husband tightened it, so it was fine from there on........ ...The hotel itself is beautiful with 2 indoor pools which were beautiful and 3 outdoor pools which included a childrens pool and a lazy river..... i had a few bad points about the pool area though as there were very few chairs around the childrens pool, due to the fact that people without children would seat themsleves there..which really annoyed me as there were plently of seats around the main pools...this meant that families were forced to stand or sit on walls to watch thier children play in the pool.....Another thing which was really annoying about the pool area was the rush for seating in the mornings...people would queue before 7.30- 7.45 to get a seat, even though you were not allowed into the pool area before 8.00, after 8.00am it was manic, 100+ people running to get their spot.......by putting a towel or bag on the lounger, once they had done this they would then go, and sometimes not come back for hours, so when you came to the pool, the seats were empty, but we could not use them..! The hotel was very busy, but the staff i found were very helpful, in all areas. Great location across from Ocean Village shopes, and Daytona Water park. We would definately go back, but probably earlier in the year and would book the 2 bedroom oceanview unit. To myself my husband and children it was the best hotel on the beach....hope this review helped you. Written by D Honeyball, July 2nd 2006

<Title>“great resort, Awful Non-Existent Service”
<Content>Went with two families to this resort early June 06. As for the size and the activities and the accomodations, it was great but the service was HORRIFIC. The only time we got "housekeeping" was if we asked for it. We were NOT time-share guests, we were hotel guests. It was never explained that you had to pay EXTRA for daily housekeeping. The day we arrived we had to wait until after midnight for someone to bring us linen for the sofa bed that my son was sleeping on. The restaurant is a joke. It's more like a cafeteria and food is awful. Most everyone affiliated with the inside staff at the hotel was rude, if they "spoke" English at all. We suspect alot did but just didn't want to be bothered. The pool area was open 24/7 so that was nice. There were two large pools, a kiddie area and three spa's. There was an extremely limited number of pool chairs and people would send a member of their party down at 8 am to reserve chairs (it closed for two hours from 6-8 am for cleaning) and by 8:20 there were never any chairs left. The beach cabanas rented for $25 a day!! We were there during Tropical Storm Alberto and with three days of non-stop rain there were no extra activities planned or even an information session to explain to tourists what to expect. I would not recommend this destination, too many negatives, too few positives.

<Title>“if you are into that”
<Content>stayed there with wife and 4 kids, the resort was nice, the view was nice the staff except a few individuals didn;t seem to care. The service just wasn;t there. I believe one of the main problems with this resort is it is too cheap. There are way to many people for the space. When i expressed my concearns to the manager on duty there was nothing that i was telling her that she did not already know. when you have 700 dwellings with only 8 elevators guess whats going to happen, i won't repeat the problems with towels and chairs, its been said way to many times. I guess its all about what you are looking for in a vacation and what you will accept as service. we will not be back

<Title>“Stayed here with a 2 year old and a 4 year old.”
<Content>I stayed in the hotel the weekend before Memorial Day, so it was very busy. We checked in at about 10 pm after a long day of traveling with 2 young children and had no problems with our room. Another couple we were traveling with got to the room to find that it had not been cleaned, It was promptly cleaned within the hour. The hotel had a great view and the best pools on the beach. The beach area was the cleanest that we saw while walking the beach. I have read several other of the reviews and must agree that the service at the hotel wasn't the best that I had received, but the people were freindly and had good attitudes. It wasn't that the service we received was bad, it was that they seemed under-staffed and they agreed. In summary I will return to the hotel because the good far out-weighed the bad. I also found this web site to be very helpful.

<Title>“Ocean Walk , we were impressed”
<Content>This was my family's first trip to Florida, and we wanted to be close to Orlando but also close to the beach. We decided on Daytona Beach and then checked out the Daytona Beach Chamber of Commerce site. We found a private owner who rented out her Ocean Walk rooms on this site (--) 2 bedroom condo was reasonably priced for the season and we were impressed with the pictures of the room on the website. We continued to be impressed on arrival. The resort was beautiful the room was very spacious and perfect for our family. Ocean Walk is a wonderful location for children. There were many activities planned for the children and the resort was located close to shops and restaurants. The only negative experience we had was with the elevators, we were on a higher floor and the elevators were slow. The weather cooperated and we were there while there were fires south of us, but that did not affect our vacation. I would recommend a trip in May, our weather was beautiful and the rates were about 1/2 of what we would have paid during the same week in June. I also recommend renting by owner, we have had several great experiences!! Mark & Annie Bruner --Tyler, Jake & Marley

<Title>“Don't go here!!!!”
<Content>We arrived on a Friday afternoon for a weekend stay, and after a 45 minute wait to check in, promptly found our room to be trashed. Doors were falling off of the hinges or cracked, electrical sockets had been pulled out of the wall as well as the toilet paper holder, and the furniture had all been moved around. A call to the front desk promised a visit by maintenance, but nothing ever happened. We also never had any maid service at all during our stay, even after repeated requests! The place seems to be way too big for the staffing level and the facilities. There are not nearly engouh elevators for the number of rooms, and when checkout time on Sunday arrived, we waited for 30 minutes for a "down" elevator, then gave up and took an "up" elevator. It stopped on all umpteen floors on the way up and the way back down, always revealing unhappy faces in the corridor when the door opened. This place is a joke.

<Title>“I wish it wouldn't have ended”
<Content>We got a huge condo room that was big enough for four people. The only bad thing was that the people before us stunk up the room with cigarette smoke and it wouldnt leave. To fix that we just bought some air freshner. But everything else was fantastic. We were high up so the view was amazing. Breathing salty ocean air was just perfect and it was easy to find anybody you were looking for from that high up. There's plenty of room on the beach. We went parasailing also. I highly recommend that and go as high as you can go. The pool activities were interesting to watch. They do one every afternoon. But if you get tired of hearing people yelling and screaming because of the games then you can simply move your stuff down to the beach which is very relaxing. We stayed for seven days and still could've stayed longer. There are alot of things to do including the nearby drive to Disney World and such. I highly recommend Ocean Walk Resort.

<Title>“Fantastic Hotel - do not be put off by the bad reviews”
<Content>I am really suprised by some of the reviews as I had a great experience here. I paid about £80 per night (lastminute[-]) for a 3 night stay in a one bedroom apartment on the 9th floor with a sea view. I cannot fault the room at all apart from a couple of stains on the carpet it was immaculate and so were all the linens, I had so many towels I didn't know what to do with them! The living area was spacious and the dishwasher, fridge freezer, tumble dryer and washer were new and perfect - they even supplied washing powder. All the plates and silverware were good too. The location cannot be better, Bubba Gumps was good as was Mai Tai cocktail bar. If you fancy something a little more sophisticated I would reccomend the supper club which reminded me of a trendy soho bar - a 5 minute walk. I had a facial in the vaction therepy spa - it was expensive but FAB, I would reccomend you treat yourself ladies! My only complaint with this hotel is the same old issue that always comes up with the sun beds around the pool! Unless you grab one at 8am forget it. However this is not really the fault of the hotel more the selfish guest who leave their stuff by the pool ALL day then spend 2 hours there! The beach is good but rentals are pretty expensive.

<Title>“Absolutely Amazing! Can't wait to go back!!!!”
<Content>This place is fabulous. My husband and I were there for 3 nights with our 4 chldren. We would have stayed longer if we could. This resort has everything you need. We never had to leave the resort. Everything we needed was within walking distance. (we brought our own groceries and cooked our own meals) My children..ages 11, 9, 6, and 2 all had activities to entertain them whenever they were tired of the beach or pool..which wasn't often. The whole resort is A+++. A pleasant surprise around every corner. We can't wait to go back again. The beach is gorgeous and clean. The pools were immaculate and so enjoyable for all of us. The game room for the kids was perfect. The pier is beautiful! I can't say enough great things about it. If you are planning a trip here--you can email me with any detailed questions! I researched so many hotels and resorts before we traveled this year--I hope I can reassure you about this. We stayed in a 2 bed/2bath in the south tower.

<Title>“Gorgeous condos, but not the place to relax”
<Content>I would never voluntarily go to Daytona on vacation.It's Spring Break all the time! We were there to attend a wedding. This is probably the best place to stay in Daytona. We had an ocean view room. The facilities are awesome. We were there when the entire place was booked. The staff was great. We got housekeeping services every day. They came to the door and asked if we needed anything, wanted the beds made and gave us fresh towels. This is a condo so you shouldn't expect daily maid service. You have a washer and dryer and kitchen. We prepared two meals a day and snacks. The pool area is beautiful, but was extremely crowded. In the morning we had to run downstairs to stake out a chair. If you're not down there by ten, you won't get one. The DJ was there all day and the music was too loud. The concierge was very helpful. She obtained dinner reservations for us on Thursday night. Every restaurant was booked and had an hour wait, yet she found us somewhere with only a 15 minute wait. Be sure to book dinner reservations early in the day, otherwise you'll have a long wait. Also, people come here to party. At 3 am we were awakened by a drunken party next door..cheerleaders on the balcony! We called security and they took care of it right away. If you're looking for quiet or relaxation, this is not the place for you. If you're looking for somewhere to bring the kids, where there will be plenty for them to do, it'll be a great experience. Also, a word of warning. Check out time is 10 am. Imagine 300 families trying to leave the hotel at the same time, and the elevators are slow. Check out by 9am and you won't have a problem.

<Title>“A nice place, but certainly some buts to it...”
<Content>Let me start by saying that Ocean Walk has lots going for it, many people there seemed to be having a great ol’ time, and my kids (son age 10, daughter age 6) both loved the place. Ocean Walk is probably one of the best resorts in Daytona Beach, and with certain…..”corrections”…. it could be one of the nicer resorts in the state. BUT… there are certain things that keep it from being the premier resort that I expected and like I have enjoyed elsewhere, and I am not sure that those “corrections” can be effected. But let’s start with the PROS ------- POOLS – Two outdoor, two indoor, one Lazy River (the four pools are a good size, Lazy River not such a good size) Water slide on one end of the pool area, kiddy play area (small slide, lots of sprinklers) on the other. BEACH– There is very little beach in Daytona that cars are NOT allowed to be on (Why anyone would want to sit next to their car while on a beach is beyond me, why anyone would want to sit by someone ELSE’s car on a beach is beyond sanity) Fortunately, no cars allowed on this section of beach) ROOMS/SUITES – Spacious, nicely decorated, and well appointed (with the exception of surprisingly small TV’s, in comparison with everything else – but we weren’t there for the TV anyway) STAFF– Everyone we had dealings with was courteous and professional, though unlike other resorts we have stayed at, never felt anyone was “personally interested” in the guests OTHER leisure facilities – Well appointed exercise room, game room, pool table, computers, spa all on premises CONS ------- HOUSEKEEPING – non-existent during my stay. Over 50,000 Fairshare points to stay here, and didn’t even get a “trash and tidy” ONCE. FOOD – There is a coffee shop here; it is not table service, and quality is barely a cut above fast-food. One would think that a 4-star resort would have at least a 3-star restaurant. And the prices are ridiculous, for the quality. Four bucks for a hot dog with nothing (no fries, no kraut, no nothin’) at the poolside grill, and it’s bland as all get out. First high-end, “full service” resort I have been to without a full serve restaurant. BEACH – Early every morning, a chair-and-umbrella rental place sets out their furniture across the entire width of the hotels beachfront, about 2 feet between set-ups, taking up the entire “front row” of the beach (you know, the high tide line, the closest bit of soft sand to the water). They then wait to rent the set-ups to people throughout the day. If you are unable or unwilling to drop $25 for the day, or if you just prefer a sheet on the sand to a lounge and umbrella, you have to either go past the hotels boundaries, or sit behind the huge furniture, having it block your view of the water. Or sit in the wet sand in front of the furniture - not too comfy LIFEGUARDS – saw the highchairs, but never saw a guard on them during our entire stay. Not comforting with small kids, considering the strength of Daytona Beach currents. NOISE – EVERY day, for four hours in the middle of the afternoon (about 11 to 3) DJ’s set up speakers about half the size of a Volkswagen, on a balcony in the center of the pool area. They play music, one of them sings to his own electric piano accompaniment (I would tell him “not to give up his day job”, but it IS his day job ! ) and they blast the volume so loud that we could hear it way down on the beach, one hotel away. Poolside, you have to shout to have a conversation, except at the very far ends of the pool. I am not a loud music hater by any means, but these guys NEVER TAKE A BREAK. Those of us who like to be able to converse a bit don’t get anytime at all during those 4 hours, which I think is grossly unfair. If one wants to hear music non-stop, and there is no DJ playing, one can always use an iPod, or walkman. If one wants to hear only the ocean, or your own conversation (or your kids calling for you from the pool?) there is no “iPod for silence”. All management would have to do to be fair to all is let the DJ take a break for 15 minutes an hour. (I talked to the DJ – management insists on non-stop music) ELEVATORS – Two towers. Approximately 300 rooms per tower. Only four elevators per tower. Do the math. (You’ll have plenty of time while you’re waiting for an elevator to arrive, or while riding up or down from a high floor.) CHECK IN. – Even if your room is ready, you will NOT be allowed to check in to your room before 4 pm. You can check in to the hotel earlier, and get your wristband to use the facilities, but you still have to go back to the desk at 4 pm to get your room card. The day we checked in, so did 238 other rooms. You can guess what the line was like. Makes no sense at all not to let people have their room early if it is ready when they arrive. CHAIR CONTEST – The pool deck closes for cleaning between 6 am and 8:15 every morning. At about 7:45, people start milling about (not lining up – MILLING – there’s a difference – lining up implies order, courtesy, respect for first come first serve) the entrances to the pool area. At 8:15, the security guards – yes, SECURITY GUARDS – who have been keeping people off the deck step back, and the race for a chair is on. Within 3 minutes, all lounges and tables are saved. You wont be able to get one until late morning or early afternoon if you aren’t there by “opening bell” CROWDS – Despite all these great facilities, they DO NOT SUPPORT THE POPULATION. And this is not something that should be excused just because it was peak time; we ALWAYS travel at peak times (I work for the schools, and have two kids in elementary school – only take vacations at peak times – Spring Break, President’s Week, etc) and this is the worst overcrowding I have seen anywhere, except possibly the Jersey Shore on 4th of July weekend. This place has been OVERBUILT. Too many rooms, the towers are too high (they also put the pool in shade by 1 pm, and the BEACH in shade by about 3:30 pm), and there is no feeling of spaciousness or leisure to the place; rather, it is more FRENETIC than relaxing. I guess that last bit is a Con more from Personal Preference – not everyone wants relaxation at a high-end resort, and The Crowd here certainly seemed to like the frantic pace. The general population here seemed not so much a Young Spring Breaker crowd - more like a Carnival crowd. Not seedy, but certainly more tacky than we are used to in a high-end resort.But I guess htis is not as high-end as I first believed.

<Title>“Never< never again!!!!”
<Content>The place fantastic, wonderful pool and the beach... That't it! Over a week ago I stayed at this hotel for five days 3.26.-3.31. After we checked in we noticed that the room was not properly inspected. First of all the one of the cabinet in the bathroom was missing, the roller blind (curtain) that was covering the washer and dryer were broken, the disposal waste in the kitchen was not working, since it was full of silverware and thrash. In addition the nightstand in the living room was missing a leg. Two hours after we checked in we called the front desk and put in a claim for replacing the little table in the living room. Unfortunately, it took over 3 hours and nobody showed up. Therefore we called again and they told us that next day someone form maintenance will come and replace it. On Monday morning someone from maintenance showed up, took the table, told us that we will get another one soon, but it never happened... On Friday after a very nice stay at the resort, and very wonderful vacation, we were sure that we would come back again. However, on the 4th of April my credit card was charged 430 dollars, and I really thought that was a huge misunderstanding! I called the hotel and talked to the clerk from accounting, they said that the charge was because of damage to the the room and they listed 4 things that were missing or broken, the missing cabinet in the restroom, broken stereo (that we never had in our room), broken curtain. I was told that I would be transferred to the manager but I was not. They said that the manager is busy, and can call me back, but it never happened. In addition, I requested the full list of the things that I was charged, but they refused. I also asked to send the list of the broken things to my email, but it never happened. Yesterday I claimed the dispute at the Bank for an unauthorized charge on my account. EVERYBODY!! Be careful, and after checking in properly inspect your room and call the front desk! Don't do my mistake, I thought that for this quality hotel things like that just don't happen, but I was wrong..............

<Title>“Excellent hotel! You need to read this review!”
<Content>The only other places in Daytona that might be as nice are the Hilton next door to this facility and the new Shores hotel occupying the old Hilton location on the south end. I don't think any of them are as "happening" as this hotel is though. If you are looking for a little more seclusion, you might check out the Shores. If you want to be where the action is, this is the place! I purchased my rental directly from a condo owner on E-Bay. You can get much better rates than booking online. The room we had was outstanding! It was a street view but it was up high enough to see the ocean as well. The view of the city was outstanding at night. The room was ultra clean. I've read other people complaining about the cleanliness, but we had no problems. As a matter of fact, we noticed staff cleaning all over the resort constantly - railings, windows, etc. The same people clean this room as clean the time share units. It was also huge! Two bedrooms, full kitchen, two bathrooms (one with a huge Jacuzzi), dining room and a wrap around balcony! Why stay in a hotel room? My only complaint is the crowdedness at the pool. There really isn't enough room for the number of people in the hotel to all be at the pool. This is pretty typical for a huge resort, but I still don't like it. What I did like was that the guards were going around and removing towels from chairs that hadn't been occupied for sometime. My wife and I took a spot that we were suprised to find. Later the original "owner" showed up and gave us an earful. We told her that we didn't move her stuff, but she didn't care. I think the hotel should let people know up front they are going to police the pool chairs. I agree that they should, but it puts folks like us in a bad situation. The funny part was here stuff was on two chairs right in front of the "No reserving pool furniture" sign. Here's a tip: Can't find a place to sit? Follow a couple of the guards around. Eventually they'll move someone's stuff and you can get that spot. Be prepared to hear about it though! Check-in was a nightmare, but many people that had stayed there before said this wasn't typical. They were having computer problems. The next day didn't look even half as bad, so it probably was some sort of glitch. While we were there, everyone was nice. We didn't really take advantage of services other than the pool bar. They were very friendly there as you might imagine. The activities center and staff are outstanding. There is always activities going on either for kids, families or adults. Every day they have a DJ at the pool; crafts, games or activities in the Activities center; and lots of exercise class options. Each afternoon there is a Ice Cream party - great for kids of all ages. There were several things for adults in the evening like dance lessons and a billiards tournament. The schedule of events rivals that of cruise ships we have been on. They really have a first class outfit! All in all it was an outstanding trip! We would definitely stay there again.

<Title>“Perfect for our teens! Parents had fun too!”
<Content>My husband and I and our 2 boys aged 16 and 17 stayed at Ocean Walk from March 29 - April 3. In general we had a good time. The kids had a blast! There were tons of other teens (espcially girls!) at the pool and on the beach, so our boys were not bored for a single second. The pool deck is open 22 hours (closes from 6 - 8 a.m. for cleaning) and has 24 hour security, so we let the kids stay out "late" with no worries. The OceanWalk Village area was "crawling" with Security guards and police, so we felt very safe. I guess there was more security than normal because of BCR weekend. We checked in on Wednesday, we were first in line and it still took 25 minutes to get checked in by a very flustered new employee. On Sunday the check in line stretched all the way from the lobby into the bar and it was taking some very upset people over 2 hours to check in! Apparently the resort had trouble getting the BCR revelers out of bed to check out - thus the delay in cleaning rooms and checking in new arrivals. We rented a lovely 2 bedroom oceanfront unit from the resort. We loved the floorplan - we had 2 of everying! 2 bedrooms, living rooms, kitchens, bathrooms and even 2 sets of washers and dryers. The kids really enjoyed having their own "place"! The unit was very clean, the furnishings were nice (except one sleeper sofa had seen better days)and the carpet was ripping out where it met the tile. The jacuzzi tub in the master bath was awesome and the jets weren't too loud. The oceanfront balcony was spacious and our unit was supplied with 10! plastic deck chairs. We did not have maid service during our 5 day stay - but we didn't really need it and didn't ask for it. I just assumed being we rented from the resort, we would automatically have maid service. However, we were supplied with a generous allotment of towels everyday, including extra large fluffy blue and white striped beach towels. When we made our reservation in December, we requested an upper floor unit. We were put in a unit on the 4th floor (which is the lowest!). Turns out we liked being on the 4th floor. Easy stair access to the pool and lobby and we had a great view of pool deck and beach so we could easily see what the kids were doing. My husband (who is recovering from 8 months of chemo) could sit on the balcony and enjoy the pool atmosphere without leaving the room. The only drawback was the noise at 7:00a.m. from the power sprayer used to clean the pool deck. The resort was booked full during our stay, but it never seemed too crowded. At 9:30 a.m. there was still a good selection of chairs by the pool - by 10:30 they were all taken. I didn't really observe a lot of "reserving" chairs that is mentioned in other reviews. The pools are beautiful, but we were grossed out by the huge(3 INCHES LONG!)bugs swimming in the pool. Someone said they were palmetto bugs. COCKROACHES that can swim and fly! Yuck! They were only in the South Tower pool with the slide. The North tower pool was bug free. We really enjoyed the Pool Bar and the cheeseburgers from the grill! On Thursday, we rented chairs and an umbrella ($25) on the beach. On Friday, Saturday & Sunday the vendor was not there, maybe because of BCR? See the concierge for restaurant resevations and lining up acitivities. She was extremely helpful! She lined up jet skis and street legal scooters for the kids from a great place on Ponce Inlet that has all new equipment! (Scooters were delivered to the resort. Kids skiied at Ponce Inlet and on the ocean - best ever!) A few notes of caution: 1.) Parents - watch your little ones! A 3 yr. old boy left his parents condo on his own! His parents were frantically trying to find him and after an hour of hell, security did locate him. This could have been tragic! 2.) Another little boy got his arm stuck in the elevator. It took several strong adults to pry the elevator doors open to free his arm. (It was badly bruised)Be aware - elevators can malfunction and can be dangerous! 3.) DANGER!!! WATCH FOR CARS!!! DRIVE SLOWLY in the parking ramp. On Monday, an elderly woman was hit by a car in the parking ramp. What a way to ruin your vacation! People drive way to fast and walkers need to stay out of the driving lanes. I can't emphasize this enough! Overall we had a great time at this resort and would definitely go again. We love Daytona Beach!

<Title>“Nice”
<Content>PROS - Easy to get back and forth to room. Clean Rooms. 1 BR Unit was well spacious and comfortable for a family with 2 small children. Laundry in room was great. Entertainment by the pool everyday...music & contests. Kid's pool was great for small children - especially toddlers (mine were 5 & 7 and had fun in it). Consierge very helpful and made reservations for us quickly and got us a good table. CONS - Now let me say - don't let this list overwhelm you...all in all our stay was very good. This is only to educate you ahead of time. During the entire week housekeeping never came once - I washed all the towels myself. They try to tell you the striped beach towels are "for the week"...no thanks ...I'm NOT going to take my sandy wet towel out in the morning and NO I'm not going to wash those too! Hospitality of staff was very inconsistent - some were VERY nice and some really didn't have a clue what was going on OR didn't really want to help. Pool with the waterslide was not heated and even in high 80 degree weather - you didn't find me in there...even my kids wouldn't go in! Lazy River was not heated and freezing too. By around early afternoon at least half of the pool area is shaded (including the kid's pool) so it is imperative that if you want a good sunny chair all day...get out of bed and get down there right when the pool opens at 8:15 ...no joke...people are lined up waiting. Get as close to the fence by the beach as possible for the longest sun. Tips - When parking in the garage go DOWN instead of up - there are always spots on the lower level and you can go right in the LL door and up the elevator. If you go during spring break (or during any major convention ie. Car Stereo Convention) just know that it's a bit crazy. Maui Nix Surf Shop was great (the big one down the street) a lot of great stuff and my husband rented a surf board for a few days from them. Beach - Chairs are not provided by the resort and are generally available by a vendor for $8/day (x 2 x5 to 7 days...lot of money when you are only spending maybe the afternoon on the beach because the pool is now shady). We bought cheap chairs and some sand toys. On the way out I asked people in line if they had children and passed down the sand toys to be enjoyed by other children. Restaurants - Highly recommend The Chart House...then Stonewood Grill and Inlet Harbor was fun (kid's had a blast in wooden ship they have to play in). Hope you find this helpful. You will enjoy your stay at Ocean Walk (it's just not a 5 Star experience!).

<Title>“great vacation”
<Content>I was there with my daughter and her friend for their spring break from ASU. We had a 1 bedroom unit that was fantastic. Very clean and well equiped kitchen. Even though it was not on the oceanside we could see both the ocean and A1A. Everyone at the resort was friendly and helpfull we used the gym everyday and loved the people that worked the outside bar. We ate in the oceanwalk shops resturants , a few times at Bubba Gumbs(fantastic) and Johnny Rockets, and many other resturants in the area. One staff member even told me the name of a tattoo place so the girls could get new tattoos. We all went and got tattoos even me, MOM!!! Will return everytime I can get a unit here!!!

<Title>“Worst Experience Ever”
<Content>My family and I checked in on March 22, 2006, from the start staf was rude, the girl checking us in told us there was maintance issues, the male staff next to her told her she was lying. The tried to tell us we could stay for 4 days check out at 10 am and check back into a new room at 4pm, when I ask for a manager, Gery Rollings came up and he was no friendlier then the person we spoke to. He did make it where we did not have to check out and back in then we went on our owner evaluation which was scheduled for 45 min and lasted 2 hours. We found a bunch of baggies and a dirty needle, lipstick, and candy behing our behind our bed and in the window. I went down stairs and spoke with Joesph, he was the manager over time shares, he told me to contact the 800# in the book, after spending 20 min on the phone we still did not get anywhere. Finally we meet a customer service rep named Lania Savas she was very friendly and made us think she could help us but in the end the resort manager and another lady came and toured our room, and after seeing all the problems we had THEY STILL DID NOT FIX ANYTHING. i HAVE PICTUERES IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM

<Title>“The Best Resort in Daytona!”
<Content>Ocean Walk Resort is a wonderful vacation spot for anyone looking to relax in the sun. It is a five-star resort and definitely the best resort in Daytona! I had a wonderful time staying here. The service is excellent. I felt like a princess while staying here because all of my needs were met. The indoor and outdoor pools are heated and are very refreshing. The ampi-theatre, Ocean Walk Shoppes, huge water slide, 3 hot tubs and mini-golf course kept me occupied during my vacation. The Ocean Walk Shoppes are connected to the resort itself which made for very convenient shopping. (and the prices were reasonable) I was fortunate enough to have a view of the ocean from my balcony and enjoyed sitting out there at night looking at the stars and the waves. The staff are friendly and willing to help make your vacation as memorable and enjoyable as possible. I recommend this resort to anyone who is going to Daytona on vacation. The atmosphere is superb and the rooms are top-of-the-line. With a kitchen, living room, 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, washer and dryer I was given access to everything I could possibly need. If you are going on vacation to Daytona please consider this resort. Although it may seem expensive you are definitely getting your money's worth!!! It is all around excellent.

<Title>“Worth every cent”
<Content>Stayed at Ocean Walk during the Daytona 500 weekend, Feb. 15-20, 2006. Rented from private party owners, Room 2325AB in North Tower. Check in was a breeze, the view from the room was fantastic, and the pools were a welcome ending to a long day spent at the Speedway. Location was terrific in relation to the track. Only took 15 minutes to get there after the Daytona 500. Will never stay anywhere else again when we go to Daytona for future races.

<Title>“Nice but not clean”
<Content>We enjoyed this resort, but I didn't feel it was kept up very well. There was rust on the appliances in our room and stains on the carpet and furniture. Unfortunately, I don't know if I would stay there again. The place had a lot to do and was very nice, but I look for cleanliness first.

<Title>“I Would Come Back in a Heart Beat”
<Content>We're Fairfield owners, but had never stayed at the Fairfield Daytona Beach. We arrived late after a long drive from the Fairfield Nashville, but we were checked in quickly and the staff was pleasant. They didn't have any carts available for bringing our stuff in, but a security guard went and got us a cart which was very helpful. We stayed in the south tower and the room was very clean and had a great view and balcony looking at the ocean. Our one bedroom unit had a large whirlpool tub and large shower. It also had a stacked washer and dryer which we always like. The pools were very clean and a nice place to hang out and the beach was just down the stairs. The Lazy river was closed for maintenance, though. We only stayed 3 nights, but we would come back here in a heart beat. It was in a great location with many things within walking distance.

<Title>“Great Fairfield Beach Timeshare”
<Content>Just returned from a wonderful week (Sept 24-1Oct) at Daytona Beach. A good time to go as the high season crowd seem to have eased off. The Fairfield resort was more than we expected from some of the previous reviews we had read. We swapped our points to Ocean Walk to be close to the beach and have a quality experience. We had never been to Florida before so was somewhat nervous not knowing what to expect. The Fairfield staff from the front desk to check out were outstanding and helpful in every way. We had a wonderful unit facing onto the beach and pool area. We were on the 17th floor which gave us a fantastic view of the ocean and sea front, as well as away from any noise. We observed that the units on the reverse side of the facility had a nice view of the inland waterway and city, but you get what you pay for. This resort has most everything that an individual or family would want. You can have individual privacy on the beach or family fun with all of the in-house or local area activities. Attached directly to the resort is Ocean Walk which provides resturants and shops of diverse styles at reasonable prices. There are also many shops close by also within walking distance that provides for most of your needs. One problem which we experienced was the drive into the facility. It gets a bit crowded during the busy check in and out times getting the family, luggage unloaded, but the hotel staff attempts to process you as quck as possible, and provides good instructions as to parking and access alternatives once you are booked in. We read that problems were occuring at check in and with the resort elevators. We arrived about 3PM on Saturday and had no delays what so ever. For timeshare owners, and if you have a car, we recommend that you go to the Publix supermarket which is located about 2 miles north of the resort, to purchase your food and necessary needs. The hotel staff will give you specific directions, but it is easy to find. The hotel concierge staff were very helpful and provide some great advice and fantastic savings coupons for activities and resturants. Yes, during high activity periods, the elevators traffic did have some delays, a few minutes at most, but expected with the size of the facility and the number of patrons in the resort. One of the main attractions at the resort is the Lazy River tube float area. Fun for both children and adults alike. Also, the direct access to the beach from the resort is great with a shower rinse unit at the gate to clean off the sand. Let us highlight one point - there are safes in every facility for security of your personal property. We used the safe in our room, but forgot to remove our valuables upon checking out. Once we realized our problem the next morning, we quickly contacted the resort and they took quick positive steps to resolve our problem. They took proper steps to confirm who we were and went on to look into the problem. Within minutes they called back acknowledging that the possession were secured from the safe. The hotel security staff ascertained where we would like to have the items forwarded and took immediate actions to provide us with our items in a very timely and secure manner. The material was forwarded to us by overnight FedEx and we received all items within 24 hours. Wow!! What a relief and fantastice service by the Fairfield staff. Our thanks. Yes, we hope to return to Ocean Walk in the near future.

<Title>“Ocean Walk is Just Wonderful for all the Family”
<Content>I have been in numerous amounts of timeshare resorts in both America and Europe and this is by far the best. Our two bedroom unit on the 13th floor was just beautiful with amazing ocean views. Our two year old grandson just loved the activity pool and what was so good about this, was he was never out of his depth at any point in the pool. We had no problem with lifts or trouble getting sun chairs and the lazy river was our favorite past time....our wee boy fell asleep on this twice while sharing a ring with gramps. We have visited Florida twenty plus times from Scotland and we always say we will do a different area of the state each time, but now all we want to do is return to Ocean Walk. The staff were extremely friendly and always helpful. We should have checked in at 4pm, but they allowed us in to our apt at 12.30 which was much appreciated. The amenities around the resort are great and there are plenty of great eating places close by. Ocean Walk definitely deserves it's Gold Crown status. I cannot fault this resort in any way whatsoever...one very happy Scottish visitor who can't wait to return.

<Title>“We didn't want to leave!”
<Content>We arrived at Fairfield Ocean Walk Resort in Daytona Beach on Fri., Aug. 19, 2005 at 3:40 PM; we stayed for a week. Apparently, the resort was not fully booked. We pulled up to the exterior of the resort and saw about three cars waiting. I had read reviews of the staff being rude to those trying to check in early, but I decided that “you can’t win if you don’t enter”, so I decided to see if we could get in 20 minutes early so we could go ahead and park. I was pleasantly surprised to walk into the very beautiful lobby to see that no one at all was waiting to check in! I had expected to see the hour-long line that I had read about and others had experienced. I walked right up to the desk (no line) and asked about checking in a little early. The lady was extremely nice and, with a lovely smile, immediately told me that my room was ready and that she would certainly go ahead and check us in. That was a great start to a great stay at Ocean Walk! Check in was quick, and soon we acquired a young bellhop named “Charles” who was very nice and treated us as if helping us was the only reason he came to work that day! We made polite conversation as I walked with him to our room as he carted our large amount of luggage; meanwhile, my husband parked the car in the south tower garage. He had no problems getting a parking spot. We left several times during our week-long stay and never had a problem getting a good spot (although I could see that if the resort was filled to capacity that it could be a problem). Be careful about walking/driving in the garages, though! Too many drivers are driving around the tight corners like they are the only ones there! Slow down, please! :-) We were blessed with an Ocean-front 1 Bedroom Deluxe on the 11th floor of the South tower near the back-end of the bandshell. We had room 1114 A and were thrilled with it. Upon entering, I gasped at how beautiful everything was and to see the ocean right outside of the sliding glass door. The unit was very clean with nothing missing, and the neat shapes that all the towels/washcloths were in made us almost not want to use them and mess them up! It was not perfect, but nearly so! The shower was a little tricky to get hot water from, but my clever husband figured it out and it worked (although I only used it once and enjoyed the hot tub the rest of the time); we had to turn the knob all the way on in one direction until the water pressure left and then turn it back the other way very slightly where there was a very small “window of opportunity” for hot water! (although not with as much water pressure as we’d prefer). There was a stain on the carpet in one small area in the living room, but other than that, the blue carpet was very nice. You could see where a part of the microwave door had been broken and glued, but it wasn’t an eyesore for me, just a close observation of mine. I loved the cheerful décor, the ocean-front balcony off of the living room was wonderful for watching fireworks from the pier and listening to a concert at the bandshell one evening. I enjoyed using the Jacuzzi nightly after my swim! There was never a problem with getting plenty of hot water for the Jacuzzi, by the way. The washer/dryer was a great help (I probably did 2 loads a day, our own clothing & freshening towels/swimsuits). The kitchen had all we needed for cooking and dining, and everything was in great shape. My husband and I thought that our King bed was very comfy, one of my sons comfortably slept on the queen sofa bed in the living room, and there was plenty of floor space in the living room for my other son to use his air mattress with sleeping bag. They are teen boys and will NOT sleep together! ;-) During the day, the air mattres was placed in the entryway closet out of the way. It was plenty of room for the 4 of us; we all loved our condo! I couldn’t find any sheets/blankets for the sofa bed, so I called the front desk around midnight our first night there; they sent someone up within 15 minutes with clean sheets/blankets, which I thought was a reasonable wait. In everything, we found that we received wonderful service from the Ocean Walk staff! It was very hot during our stay, so doing anything outside other than swimming wasn’t even a consideration for us. We loved being able to go to the 4th floor of the North tower to play putt-putt golf in the COOL A/C in the middle of the day when the sun seemed its hottest. This was free and a lot of fun for us. The resort offered many activities for all ages, but we opted to do our own thing for the most part. I think that a lot of people checked out during the weekend, so Sunday through Friday left the resort much emptier during our stay. Since the resort was not too full, the pools were never what I would call crowded. I don’t know why, but pool wristbands were not used, nor given out during our stay. The lady at the front desk said that they weren’t using them; I was glad for that! Some may have saved their pool chairs, but it was not very noticeable if they did; there were always some empty lounges (usually many were available). I do know that the pools were always open except between 6:45am and 8:15am (or sometime close to those times). During those times, they pressure-washed the pool deck (I watched them a few mornings) and there were no towels or other belongings anywhere near the pools or deck. If someone had gotten up before 6am to save a chair, either their stuff would’ve gotten soaked or they would’ve removed them (so nothing was ever sitting down there at that time during my stay). The beach was never crowded during our stay, and we loved the ease of going back and forth from pool to beach and vice-a-versa (there are showers & spickets to rinse the sand/salt off as you enter pool deck from beach). I loved the lazy river (never a line for it, but clearly very popular), although I did suggest on our comment card (that we turned in to the front desk) that there be periodic adult-only float times i.e. first 15 min. of every even hour. Kids can get really rowdy in the lazy river…and it suddenly feels very UN-lazy during those times. There were some times that I could relax in the lazy river, although if it had been busier, I wouldn’t think enjoying it would’ve been as possible). We chose to attend a timeshare sales pitch our second day there and had a time window of being there anytime between 9am – 3pm. It wasn’t too bad and took about 90 minutes. We didn’t buy, but thought that the $50 restaurant-of-our-choice gift card and 4 Free adult Daytona USA combo tickets (with track tour, worth over $30/person) were worth the time. There were several other choices in gifts available also. The resort never called us about attending, but we were pursued by a man in a Fairfield timeshare booth at the Ocean Village Shoppes. We had already planned on going anyway, so we didn’t mind him asking us about it. All-in-all, we loved staying at the Ocean Walk Resort. My husband is pretty picky, and even he wants to go back whenever we take another beach trip! I could’ve easily stayed 2 weeks instead of the 1 that flew by too quickly! The place is beautiful, and I know that my instant camera photos will not do it justice.

<Title>“Rooms are fantastic, views are even better, not a place for relaxing”
<Content>We loved our room it was great and the view of the ocean from it was spectacular. The pools were quite noisy at times it definitly isn't a place for relaxing. This was by far the most crowded resort on the beach. It made the (4) elevators per tower crowded and ridiculously slow, we did however get a great workout because the majority of the time we had to go up or down we had to use the stairs. The crowdedness also made getting a pool side chairs IMPOSSIBLE to ever get, at least I never got one. They open it up at 8:00 and by 8:05 they are all taken so be first in line if you want one. There are signs that say you can not reserve chairs, and DJ Credible who is there from 10-2 daily announced that if people did that security would remove their belongings and they could find them at the front desk although during the 7 days we stayed there that never happened. When questioned about it we were told we could put their towel on the ground and use the chair but we were trying to vacation, not start confrontations. I feel the resort should have staff that does this. Don't get me wrong, we were completely satisfied with our unit and we had a fabulous time while we were there. The kids had a great time playing in the pools,downstairs in the arcade and miniture golf area. We also did the timeshare deal were we got a $50 dinner certificate and four movie passes, the resteraunt (the views,* great food*) we picked sent a limo to pick us up for dinner for no additional charge. The kids loved the experience. There was so much to do at the resort and in the immediate area that we didn't even find the time to use our movie tickets. We would definitly stay there again anytime we are looking to have lots of fun, if we are just looking for a little relaxation we'll probably go elsewhere.

<Title>“Last Minute Booking - Great Place for Teens & Families”
<Content>My husband and I, our 12 yr old daughter and her friend, and our 17 yr old son and his friend stayed at the Ocean Walk the end of July. We had been scheduled to go to Playa del Carmen to an all inclusive resort that week, but the night before our departure (really the early morning hours of our departure date) the forecast track for Hurricane Emily caused us to cancel our Mexican trip. We were all extremely dissappointed, having planned and looked forward to the trip for a long time. We were packed and determined to go SOMEWHERE, and were fortunate to get accomdations at Ocean Walk in Daytona, a 2 1/2 hour drive from our house. We had a huge 2-bedroom beautiful apartment on the corner of the 24th floor in the north tower. It was ocean front, with amazing views of the ocean and down Atlantic Blvd. The master suite had a jacuzzi tub, king bed, nice sitting area. The other bedroom had two double beds, a walk in closet and another large bathroom. There was a washer and dryer and fully equipped kitchen, including a blender for margaritas. We could only have that room for 2 nights. We then had one 1-bedroom for two nights, and two 1-bedrooms for three nights. The bellhops were very helpful, and stored our things the day we had to move. They even stored the refrigerated items for us. The next unit was in the south tower, (a little older) but was on the 18th floor and was beachfront with amazing views as well. It was smaller, with two double beds in the bedroom, a pull out couch, but a fully equipped kitchen with bar, VCR, and a washer and dryer as well. The bathroom was a little smaller but still nice. We didn't have to move after two nights. We just added another unit which was on the 12th floor for the boys. The girls absolutely loved the resort. There were constant activities with the game room, putt putt golf, internet access, and video games. There were tons of teenagers and they made some friends. The 17 yr olds loved the location at the boardwalk, and loved the fitness room. The hotel connects to the shops at the Boardwalk, which was really convenient. There were live bands at the bandshell and fireworks several of the nights. The hotel is beautiful, with entertainment by the pool during the day. It was the closest thing to the all-inclusive resort we could have found in terms of activities for the kids and entertainment. We did have to play the "towel game" every morning to get a shaded spot by the pool. The security guards actually would not let anyone on the pool deck before 8:00 A.M. to reserve a spot, so what ended up happening was everyone waiting by the door (some actually kind of hiding in the bushes - really!!!) and then at 8:00 making a mad dash to get your preferred spot. We were lucky and were able to get shaded tables at the pool with views of the ocean every day. One man actually fell running to get a spot one of the days. He got back up though and did get his spot! I noticed people coming down around 9 still able to get chairs by the pool, but if it was much later than that, they were taken. I also noticed the beach in front of the hotel was really crowded, but we considered it a trade-off to put up with a more crowded beach in exchange for a full service resort with all of the activities and amenities it offered. If it were just my husband and I, I would opt for a condo on a less crowded, more laid back part of the beach. But with teens and preteens, they'd probably be bored and this resort fit their needs perfectly. They had movies for rent in the lobby. They had crafts every day, and board games, footballs, frisbees, boogie boards, etcetera that could be checked out at no charge. Worth noting is at The Eatery just off the lobby you can purchase a drink, and get free refills the rest of the day. They also have $1 soft ice cream cones, and reasonably priced blizzards that were deliciious. We deep sea fished. We parasailed just a few hundred yards down the beach, and Ocean Walk guests get a discount. The boys rented scooters to ride around town and the beach and had a blast. Bubba Gumps is a neat place with good food. We also like the North Turn restaurant down in Ponce Inlet. It's right on the beach and the food is good. We also played putt putt golf. There's plenty to do in the area. Next time we're going to rent a pontoon boat and go down the river. Check-in did take a while, and a few times the parking garage was over full, so people were parking in non-parking spots. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this resort for active families that like a lot of activity and want to be in the center of all the action. I'd recommend it over Adam's Mark, which is next door. But if you want a less crowded, more laid back atmosphere, I'd pick something in Ormond Beach or Daytona Beach Shores. This truly is a full service resort with all the bells and whistles, beautiful rooms, and the kitchens and washers and dryers are big pluses.

<Title>“A honest review of the resort.”
<Content>I rented from a private owner at the resort.He had unit #1108 in the south tower.It was a one bedroom condo with a oceanfront view.I think renting from a owner is a better option than the resort.The first reason is price.I only paid $121.00 a night including tax and cleaning fees for 7 nights.If I would of rented thru the resort it would of been around $189.00 a night before taxes.I think the owners keep their rooms nicer in the long run.The resort treats your needs the same if you rent from a private owner.We got all the sheets,towels,paper towels,dish soap,laundry powder,shower soap and shampoo,lotion,and toliet paper we needed.The only negative about renting from an owner is you do not get daily maid service.The room has all the dishes and pots and pans you need to cook.The washer and dryer was very handy.I used it once a day to fresh up pool towels and bathing suits.I also like the nick nacks on the selves in the room.This made it feel more homey. When we arrived the pull in was full of cars and crowed.The security guard was very helpful out front telling people to go ahead and pull into the parking garage.There is two parking garages in front of the building on each side of the the north and south tower.The south tower is older.The resort seemed to be easy to figure out.When you park there is 8 floors in the south parking garage which coressponds to the floors the rooms are on.The Lobby is L in the elevator.The parking never seem to be a problem but,the spaces did seem to be narrow.We really did not ever really need to drive anywhere.We could walk to most things during our week stay. The lobby was packed full of people around 4:00p.m. on Saturday when we checked in.The owner I rented from allows us to check in at 2:00p.m. in the Vip lane.I believe it only took me about 10 mins. to check in the Vip lane but,the resort regular resort line looked to be at least an hour long.I am so glad I rented from a private owner after seening that line.The resort has a guy doing magic tricks for the kids in the lobby.They were also giving out coloring books and crayons for the kids.I thought that was cool.There were many bell boys getting peoples bags.We decided we would would rather do our own. We went up to our room and it was beautiful and clean.Our room was missing some items such as soaps,extra towels and such.I called the front desk and they brought up everything I needed without any problems.They were a little slow about it but,I think it was because the resort was so busy.The maid that had that brought our items was a nice young man that was 19.He was nice and Friendly.We chated for a while.He told me he works 8 am to 12 midnight 5 nights a week.He seemed cheerful and said he loves his job.I saw him almost everyday.He was always working hard and stopped to talk to me. The elevators were crowed and slow most of the time.We really didn't seem to mind, we had that problem at many other resorts we have stayed at in the past.A secret is just get in rather or not it is going up or down when the elevators seem busy. The resort had a week of activities set for the kids as well as the families.It changed every week.We decided not to do any of them.We like to relax and do our own thing.The activities room,game room,and indoor pool,gift shop and work out room is on the LL ( lower lobby). The outdoor pools were pressure washed and cleaned every am about 7:00.I believe they cleaned for almost 2 hours every am.People went out to put towels on the chairs about 7:00 and by 9:00 when the pool was open there were no open chairs.We did not seem to mind because we did'nt drive over 900 miles to use the pool.We went for the beach.The pool area would clean out a little by 3:00 pm.We went to pool then.My 2 year old just loved the kiddie pool.It has a small waterslide and steering wheels that turn on sprouting water.My 13 year old loved the pool with waterfall and waterslide.I loved the lazy river ride.I did it everyday.The line was long but, it was worth the wait.I also like the fact the resort has life guards at the pools.The pool was opened all night except the kiddie pool and lazy river.We never got in the other pool that had water volleyball set up in it.They had a DJ almost everyday from 10:00-2:00.They have a great pool side bar but I could not figure out their hours.They were open everyday but,They stayed open all different times. I loved how the resort had Ocean walk Village shoppes and restaurants connected to the 4th floor south tower bulding.You did not have to walk in the heat on the outside if you didn't want to.They have Bubba Gumps seaffod restaurant,Adoba Gila's Mexican bar and Restaurant,Cold stone Creamery,Johnny rockets,Harley Davdison shop,Mauxi Nix Surf shop,and a few other places.The resort has a small food court in the lobby but we never ate at it.The resort also has a lobby lounge with Karoke. The resort also has free putt-putt on the 4th floor in the north tower.You have to sign out putters and balls on the Lower lobby at the activties desk.We had fun doing putt-putt.You can also putt-putt around the pool area. The resort seemed to have tons of kids and teens running around everywhere.The security guards seem to have all of them under control.I noticed most parents were not watching their kids. I was very disappointed I never really got to get the Hot tub at night.The teens took over it at the night.My husband didn't like the fact we had to wear pool wrist bands at the pool.I didn't mind.I never saw anyone checking them anyway. The congeige desk was helpful with discount tickets and making reservations for us.The timeshare sharks never bother us not once maybe because we rented from a private owner? Overall we were very happy with the resort and staff.I was very happy with how clean the resort was.I am a clean freak.I have been going to DB for over 30 years and this my favorite place I have stayed at so far.I will be back next year.If anyone has any specific questions I would be glad to help just email me.Sweetiepie

<Title>“Not a place to relax at...”
<Content>Overall my husband and I would say this resort if nice BUT it was not what we were hoping our beach stay to be. We have stayed at other resorts and not had these problems so we didn't think we were unrealistic. Good points of the resort: *Clean rooms, lobby and pools *Pools stay open extremely late * parking in garage was easy and never full * walking distance to almost anything, you don't even really need a car * for a mere 90 mins of your time (listening to the timeshare sharks) we rec'd (2)$40 gift certificates to restaurants of our choice and a 2n/3d stay at another Fairfield resort *If you have kids they seemed to have a lot of activities for them. Bad points of the resort: *Check in was terrible and the line took 30-45 mins to get through. We got to the front of the line at 3:45, but unfortunately that was NOT 4:00pm, so we had to go to back of the line and start over. Check-in was so long they had a magician there to entertain the kids. * This was by far the most crowded resort on the beach that we saw. The made the (4) elevators per tower crowded and SLOW, ridiculously slow at ponts. The crowdedness also made getting a pool side chairs IMPOSSIBLE to ever get, at least I never got one. My pictures show how although most of the chairs are empty, they are "reserved" because people put their towels on them, some at 7:30am were already reserved. Yeah, there are signs that say you can not reserve chairs, and an employee even told us we should just "put their towel on the ground and use the chair" but I am trying to vacation, not police the pool or start confrontations. I feel the resort should have staff that does this. Although the resort was OK, we will be staying at a smaller, more quiet and relaxing resort next year. Also, we ended up in a room with 2 dbl beds and they were "booked full" so we couldn't ever get a king bed. The OceanWalk is just a hectic resort that is sooo large it makes it difficult to enjoy.

<Title>“Great Stay; Some Problems”
<Content>My fiance and I stayed at the Fairfield Ocean Walk Resort during the second week of May, 2005. Overall, we had a great stay, but we did run into some problems and inconveniences that diluted our experience somewhat. First of all, let's get this out of the way: Daytona Beach and the resort are both BEAUTIFUL. The Ocean Walk Resort is situated in a prime location on the beach, near the boardwalk and the Main Street Pier. It is connected to the open-air Ocean Walk Shops Mall and is a short drive away from both Publix and Winn-Dixie grocery stores. A few weeks prior to traveling to Daytona Beach, I spoke with a Fairfield representative who asked if I had any questions about the resort or my stay. I asked if they had any idea where in the resort we would be staying, since I have heard that there are SIGNIFICANT differences in room types based on whether you get a so-called "A" unit or a "B" unit, as well as which tower you are staying in (the north tower or the south tower). I was informed we would be staying in room 1822A, which is a great room with a great ocean view in the newer North Tower. When we arrived at the hotel at approximately 6:00 PM on Saturday, May 7, we were told we were in (I believe) Room 416 in the South Tower. I was somewhat confused because obviously this was not what I was told before. When we arrived in our room, we found it to be absolutely gorgeous, very spacious, with a whirlpool tub and very tasteful art-deco decorating. It also had two balconies, which overlooked... a parking deck and crosswalk for the outside mall. We were disappointed since we had gone to significant effort and expense to try to get a view of the ocean (this trip was the first time either of us had ever been to the ocean). When we called the front desk, we were rudely informed that there was nothing that could be done and that specific room assignments were not made in advance. We decided not to let our disappointment about the view ruin our vacation, and determined that the room itself was otherwise perfect and nicer than anywhere else we'd ever stayed before. An exploration of the hotel revealed a nice game room, an adults-only lounge, a computer room, an activity room for children, a small indoor mini-golf course, a gift shop, a well-equipped exercise room, an indoor golf practice area, two indoor pools, three outdoor pools, a lazy river, a poolside bar area, an indoor bar and a cafeteria-style cafe. There was also an area where an artist would draw portraits and characatures in one of the two lobbies and there always seemed to be some sort of activity going on, from a book sale in the lobby to a karaoke night at the bar. We were told upon checking in that we should visit the Concierge Desk for a "free check-in gift". Being hip to Fairfield's wily ways, we were well aware that this was a ruse to get us to attend a time-share pitch, but we thought we would humor them and see what was being offered. The deal on the table was gift certificates to various area restaurants in exchange for going on a tour of the hotel where we were staying and spending a couple hours telling a very insistent salesperson that we didn't want to buy a timeshare. It's debatable whether $60 worth of gift certificates is worth losing 2-3 hours worth of your time, but we went along with it and got the gift certificates without having to spend a dime. The salesperson was very phony and snooty, and the high-pressure tactics are very see-through to anyone familiar with sales techniques. The concierge desk was by far the most helpful aspect of the hotel. A very pleasant older lady with an accent (we sadly didn't catch her name) provided us with a lot of excellent information about local attractions and restaurants. ALL of her suggestions were spot-on and without her advice we probably would have missed out on some very memorable aspects of our trip. Her most helpful advice came when she was signing my fiance up for a complimentary Mary Kay spa treatment, and tried to automatically write down our room number as "1822A". Upon questioning her about it, it became evident that we truly WERE supposed to be in that room. After listening to our ordeal with the front desk, she provided a phone number to a man she said would do his best to pull strings to help us. And he absolutely did. This man listened to our problem and contacted the hotel manager, who contacted the night manager with instructions to move us to room 1822A. We were moved that evening, by the same man who had told us he couldn't move us! Our second room, then, was in the newer tower. It had a different decorating scheme and was even more gorgeous than the first room (both were one bedroom suites). The kitchen and dining area were larger and the view of the ocean from the 18th floor was absolutely breathtaking. We truly had no complaints whatsoever about the second room. We could see the beach, the boardwalk, the outdoor pools, the bandshell, the pier, and ocean as far as the eye could see, not to mention spectacular sunrises. We went to Saint Augustine one of the days of our trip, and the conceirge desk was helpful in that respect once again, providing plenty of brochures and coupons for attractions in the area, and providing advice on the best sites to see while we were there. The concierge also informed us of the Sterling Casino Cruise Line, which is basically a casino on a huge cruise ship that sails three miles off Florida's coast. The trip is about four hours and features table games, slot machines (even nickel slots), several lounges with great live entertainment, a free deli buffet, free drinks, and a great experience on a real cruise ship. There are a couple of cruises per day -- I recommend the sunset cruise, which was about 8 to midnight. The ship leaves from Port Canaveral, which is about an hour away from Ocean Walk -- but a shuttle bus takes you to and from the dock, so you don't even have to worry about driving (and you have a ready-made designated driver). The entire cost of all this: the shuttle, the cruise, the buffet, the entertainment, everything... is $5.00 per person. And you are not required to gamble, either. Neither me nor my fiance are gamblers: we only gambled with $20.00 for the whole night and finished down about five or six bucks. But we had a great time and you just couldn't beat it for the price. The beach outside the resort is perfect. The ocean is a great time also, but just be aware that when the sun starts setting behind the buildings you have to chase the sunlight if you're laying out in the sun. Another thing to keep in mind if you go swimming out into the ocean: stay aware of the riptide warnings, which are posted on the back of the lifeguard chairs. The currents can be extremely strong, particularly at high-tide. A wave hit my fiance and I out in the ocean and the riptides pulled us quite a distance from shore. My fiance is not a strong swimmer and although I am, the riptide was stronger than both of us. My fiance was in quite a bit of trouble and I was having a difficult time trying to help her. Luckily, the lifeguards are very alert and observant and quite good at what they do and tragedy was averted. The boardwalk area is fantastic. I haven't been to other boardwalks so I cannot compare this one to anything, but this boardwalk was quite fun. It is lined with eateries, ice cream shops, gift shops, arcades and other attractions. We managed to win enough tickets playing skee ball to get a nice souvenier shot glass from one of the arcades. All-in-all, Daytona Beach is a great place to vacation and the Ocean Walk Resort is a fantastic place to stay. The extremely friendly, genuinely helpful people at the resort seem to more than make up for the somewhat rude, unhelpful people on the staff. And as for the rooms, the location, and the amenities -- they are top notch. There is a good chance we may return to this resort on our next trip to Daytona Beach. -- BBR

<Title>“Only Place to Stay In Daytona”
<Content>We absolutely love the Ocean Walk!!! Have been to Daytona Beach for the past three years and we will never stay at any other motel - The Ocean Walk Resort is No. 1 for us!!! Loved the fact that there was so much going on at the resort - if you got tired of the Beach, there was the Lazy River, pools, game room, and hot tubs. My daugther and her roommate from college made the trip with me. We flew into Daytona Beach and had the best time. The staff at the Ocean Walk were Great. And the girls walking every day around the outdoor pools (offering drinks) was a nice touch! You can't go to the beach without getting a Pina Colda!!! Again, the Ocean Walk Resort is the only place that we will ever stay at while in Daytona Beach. We are already making plans for the next trip to DB in May of 2006!!!!

<Title>“Perfect family vacation- old and young!!”
<Content>We spent a week at Ocean Walk with our children, ages 8 and 9, and our parents (still young enough to enjoy life) and were even lucky enough to bring two college age sitters with us. We purchased a 2 BR ocean front on Ebay for $1000 for the entire week and that includes all fees, taxes and cleaning in one price. When our confirmation arrived, we had been UPGRADED to a 3 BR just for taking a handicap room. We immediately called and invited 2 girls from our college Sunday School class, who GLADLY accepted. We spend all day long either at the beach or pool with our children, and most of the time in the evenings also, but this gave us a chance to have 2 nights out with ADULT conversation without leaving the grandparents to BABYSIT- after all, it is their vacation also!! One evening after we all returned from dinner, my husband and I wanted to see a late movie, so we left the kids with the sitters and walked next door to the theater, what a convenience for us. The condo set up gave us our own private master bedroom, with jacuzzi tub and seperate shower and ocean front balcony while the children had seperate beds (full beds in 2nd bedroom) and the sitters had their own room with 2 full beds. The children would share our bathroom since I kept their clothing with me which gave the older girls the 2nd bathroom to themselves. It had a roll in shower instead of tub, but they were fine with that. It was extremely roomy so they could both get ready at the same time on the nights when they were going out alone. My parents had a seperate 1 BR, which they loved, giving them their privacy and peace and quiet. The hardest thing was arguing over who was getting up at 7:00 a.m. on vacation to go down and reserve chairs- I know it isn't fair, but it was necessary to have a seat at 8:30 after we had breakfast and headed down to the pool and beach for the day. We scheduled consecutive time slots for our children mid day in the video room (PS2, Xbox, or something of that sort) and it was a nice break for them AND for us. The room is right inside from the pool which made it convenient for us to lounge peacefully while they took a break and then we could walk right inside to pick them up when they were finished. Also, lunch by the pool is great, (hot dogs, burgers, grilled chicken, etc) and we could all eat for around $10 or $12 dollars, which was worth not going up to the room some days. When it rains, the indoor golf kept our kids busy. Adobe Gila's was not impressive for us, but we love Bubba Gumps and look forward to spending July 4th at Ocean Walk in a few weeks. Gotta start packing!!! FYI- Request an oceanfront or agree to take a handicap room and you MIGHT get lucky!!

<Title>“Well worth the money!”
<Content>We stayed at the Ocean Walk Resort May 24th through May 27th. We took our 15 year old son, 17 year old daughter, and 24 year old daughter with us. We have 4 children and we faithfully take a vacation every year. Through the years we have always looked for something the children would enjoy and every year we come back more exhausted than when we left. Trying to entertain 4 children and fight the long lines and traffic left us drained! This year was different though. When we parked the car in the parking garage, it didn't move until we left for home. Everything we needed was right there! One evening it was to the movies, one shopping, playing games in the arcade room, playing gooney golf, swimming, dining at really good places and much more. Our room was a 2 bedroom oceanfront and it was fantastic! We had 3 balconies all ocean view, two bathrooms, 2 refrigerators and stoves, all the utensils you could ever use. It was quiet and super clean. Around 9:00 am every morning maid service was there to clean our room and restock it and they did an excellent job. No one bothered us the whole time we were there. The only complaint I would have is they give you no layout of the hotel. I had studied the hotel out and knew they had alot of activities but didn't have a clue to where they were. So we began to explore and asked a security person, which was not helpful at all. We returned to the main desk and they said they didn't have anything to show the layout. We then found another desk where a lady that apparently sales their time share, gave us the information after asking us if we would be interested in buying. She did not pressure us after that and answered all our questions. All the game rooms and activities were on LL (lower lobby) the golf supplies are checked out on LL but the actual game is on the 4th floor. The fourth floor is also the exit hall to the movie theater and shops. We had the best experience with our vacation this year than ever before. We came home rested and can't wait to go back again! We highly recommend this hotel to anyone with children that wants to have as much fun as they do!!

<Title>“Pretty Good Resort for Daytona”
<Content>Really, the Ocean Walk is the only decent resort in Daytona. Daytona is very run down (alot of buildings boarded up or should be boarded up). The resort is big and very busy. Lots to do. The Village next door is great. Teenagers would love this place. Pools and grounds are very nice. We had a one bedroom, South Tower. It was getting pretty wrecked up from previous guests. The walls were a mess. No batteries in the tv converter, lamp shades missing, light bulbs missing, mirror in bedroom missing..I guess alot of things were missing!!!! It was pretty clean and the decorating was cheerful. Nice size rooms. Front desk staff..ok. It was very busy when we arrived..no luck getting in ealier. I had requested a lower floor but ended up on the 16th floor. No other rooms available supposedly. Got used to it after awhile. Elevator waits varied...could be long during dinner hour. Best advice..stay at this resort if you are going to Daytona Beach. You may be disappointed otherwise..some pretty bad ones. Oh ya, the beach was clean and great as always!!

<Title>“Wish We Could've Stayed Longer”
<Content>Our only complaint was that we could not stay longer. We stayed for two nights after spending a few days in Orlando. Our room was a beautiful one bedroom unit with a full kitchen and living room over looking the ocean. There were two full beds in the bedroom and a pull out sofa in the living room. The unit was clean and impeccably decorated. The sunrise from our room was amazing. The hotel amenities were second to none. There are several indoor and outdoor pools. There is a great water slide to the main outdoor pool, along with a lazy river and a wonderful toddler pool with plenty of toys to play on. Our kids had a blast. Also, the beach is just a few steps away, and there are beach chairs and umbrellas available for rent if you want to hang on the beach. The restaurant in the hotel is convenient and reasonable. We were able to purchase lunch for our family of five for under $25.00 - and it was good! The staff was pleasant and attentive. The Ocean Walk stores (a mutli-level outdoor mall) is right next door and accessable through the hotel. Great stores and restaurants. The main street boardwalk, along with arcades, bung-jumping, etc., is a short walk away. Definitely plenty to do!!! We will definitely stay here again!

<Title>“A really nice resort set in a so-so location”
<Content>We just returned from a stay at this resort. First of all the weather was great for mid-May and it wasn't that crowded. It definitely gets more crowded on the weekends and I can understand people's complaints about the pool chairs being taken. It's true. I would not want to come here in June-July-August. There are only four elevators that service the north tower and although the wait was never too, too long sometimes the elevator would come and it would be full. The resort itself is great. There are two outdoor pools, three hot tubs and a good sized children's pool plus a lazy river. The children's pool is not heated and you can tell. There are also two indoor pools. There are two rooms with computers with free internet access. There is a game arcade room for the kids plus an activity center with free playstation and a huge plasma tv to play them on. The rooms were very nice although our oceanfront balcony was concrete and you had to stand up to be able to see out. Other balconies are not so ask when you call. We rented through a private party and were considered guests of the hotel so we got daily maid service. The only other negatives are the noise. The smaller lock off units face the hall and people talk loudly and slam doors at 3am. We had both sides of the unit. The kitchen was fully furnished with everthing from pots and pans to dishwasher detergent. They even give you laundry detergent. My husband and I, our three year old and my parents had a really good stay. Daytona, itself, isn't that exciting although there are some good restaurants around. If you are there for the beach and the pool you'll love it. We also found the front desk staff helpful. Any maintenance issue we had was addressed very quickly. My parents went on the time share presentation and said the salespeople were pushy. They did receive $70 in meal cards plus a two night stay at another Fairfield. All in all we thought it had great amenities in a so-so setting.

<Title>“A great place for the price you pay”
<Content>I have to admit that I was a little skeptical about staying at the Fairfield after reading some reviews lately. My wife and I stayed at the Ocean Walk the week of May 7 - 14th. First, I think people need to remember they are staying at Daytona Beach not South Beach and are paying $140 a night instead of $400. If you keep this in perspective then you will be very happy with the Ocean Walk Resort. Our room was very nice and most importantly clean. We had a 1 bedroom in the south tower it was big almost like a one bedroom apartment with a kitchen and small washer and dryer. One downside was the housekeeping. Their did not seem to be any consistency the only thing I know they did in our room was replace the towels otherwise I don't think they did anything. I have read many people complaining about the pool, so let me give you some advice. First, you do have to go down and reserve a chair before around 9 AM if you want to have a chair that is going to be in the sun until 3 PM. I recommend the chairs lined along the fence next to the beach at the south tower pool. These chairs stay in the sun until at least 3PM, chairs closer to the hotel start getting shade around 1 to 1:30. If you want sun all day just go down to the beach. If you do go to the beach you have to pay $25 to rent chairs, umprella etc. The vendor is on the beach. Life guards do keep an eye on everyone just making sure they don't get to far off of shore. Finally, this is a family resort. If you came to get away from kids then this is not the resort for you. Remember more than half the units in this resort are time shares so families do come to these places to stay. Plus you are only 60 miles from Disneyworld once again a good reason why their are so many kids at the resort. My wife and I don't have kids but still managed to relax and have a great time. You will love the resort if you don't let the little things bother you and remember you are at the beach so life could be worse.

<Title>“AWESOME VACATION!”
<Content>We went to Ocean Walk the 3rd week in April 2005. Check-in was fairly quick and they had concierge to help us bring our bags to the room. There was a parking garage on site. The room was a 1 bedroom suite with a queen size sleeper sofa, full kitchen, living room, bathroom and ocean view. It was roomy and comfortable. It was great that I could cook breakfast and dinner in the room to save money, then we could splurge more at lunch when we went sightseeing. The resort offered daily activities for kids (and teens) ranging from sandcastle building, various crafts (for a nominal fee) to karaoke that was all supervised by Ocean Walk staff. They had plenty for the kids to do to keep busy and for a fee, parents could get away one night during the week to spend alone while their kids were cared for. The pool area was great, though one of the pools was unavailable due to some repairs, but there was still the kiddie pool, lazy river and other large pool, not to mention the indoor pools and the HOT TUB (which was heaven!) And you could walk right down the steps from the ool onto the beach. The Main St. Pier was a quick walk from the hotel (which is conveniently located next to Ocean Walk Village for shopping. Overall, it was an amazing vacation and we will definitely be visiting Ocean Walk again and recommending it to our friends and family!

<Title>“Stayed her on two occasions (semi long post)”
<Content>Myself and my husband first stayed here in Jan 04. It was wonderful, not one complaint. The room was superior, nice lounge. We didn't have to worry about the crowds due to the time of year. Our second stay was in July 2004 with our 2 children. We were arriving separately due to the fact I was just returning from Iraq. The room was paid for in cash including a cash deposit. After I waited in a very short line for almost 30 minutes, I was rudely greated by the staff. No greating what so ever. All she said was I need your credit card. I explained to her everything was previously paid for including the deposit. I need it for identification. I explained I would give her any picture ID she needed but she didn't need my credit card for identification. After that went on for some time the manager stepped in, needless to say I did not have to give my credit card. This was after a 20 minute dispute. We were supposed to have an OF room but didn't. Everytime we returned to our room, or to the parking garage for that matter the keys didn't work. One time I was by myself and had to go back in to the lobby so the could give me a new key. I was in there no more that a minute when the security guard came in screaming that I needed to move my car. Even though there were several other cars out there, I was not blocking the flow of traffic. I asked were can I move it to? His response was I don't care just move it. There were teenagers in the pool after 11pm practically having sex and drinking in the pool; cursing up a storm. There were no remotes for ANY of the 3 TV's in the room and when we requested them they said they should be in there and couldn't give us any. Parking was atrocious. Before arriving we had informed them we would have 2 cars, they said it wasn't a problem. It sure wasn't for them. We had to park our 2nd vehicle at the public garage and pay 15 dollars a day. There "food court" is the worst. You are better off going to 7-11. I have been treated better at a Super 8 than I had been treated here. Although this hotel is beautiful I would never stay here again. There are other very nice hotels in the general vicinity (Plaza Resort and Spa) that are much more enjoyable to stay at. I understand that dealing with people all day long can get frustrating, I myself work at a major international airport. So i know what it is like. I believe in customer service and it doesn't exist here.

<Title>“There is no place nicer on Daytona Beach”
<Content>There were six in my party; me and my 4 yr old daughter; my sister and her husband and their 2 kids, aged 14 and 15. We stayed April 17-24. Arrived at the resort earlier than the 4:00 check in time, but had no problem and in 5 minutes we were done. Allison waited on us and was extremely pleasant. We were given enough room keys for everyone, pool passes/armbands and even requested a visitor pass for the parking garage and got one. Incidentally, we reserved from a condo/vacation rental place from a private owner and got a steal of a deal. The resort was way more than we expected. By far the nicest place on the beach. I live here and have been through my share of Daytona area hotels and resorts. In my opinion there is no reason to go anywhere else when you've already been to the best. We rented a 3 BR; 2 BA in the north tower on the 13th floor. Great view, great accommodations. The master bedroom had a king bed with a huge bathroom that had a jacuzzi tub and a shower with a glass door. Just huge. The second bedroom had a king bed and the third had two full sized beds. The 2nd bathroom was very large with a tub/shower. Units are equipped with blowdryers, blender, toaster, micro, coffee pot, TV's in every room, alarm clock/radio's a stereo, dishes, pots, pans, silver, glasses; everything imaginable. You do not need to bring anything. Dishwasher detergent, palmolive and laundry detergent is also included, as well as bath and pool towels of all shapes and sizes. Room was touched up midway through the week, but that was OK for us and even an added surprise. The pools are wonderful, the activities, superb; game room, gym, indoor pools, computer rooms, one for kids; one for grown ups. Pool tables, ping pong tables, indoor mini golf...I could go on and on. You will not be disappointed. Please email me with any questions as I think I'm a good judge.

<Title>“poor customer servive”
<Content>I read a lot about the hotel/ resort online and was very excited to book a room. I called the reservations number and after holding 9 minutes I was disconnected. So I called back, this time I held for 15 minutes, but I did speak to a man, who was very, very rude! I asked him the rate on the hotel for a 1 bedroom for Apr 24-30th. He told me he did not have a 1 bedroom for that time so I asked him about a 2 bedroom. He quoted me $229.00 a night. I told him I had seen online you have a spring fling special for this time and asked him if I could get that rate. He then rudely asked me if I was planning on booking the room right them because if not it was not worth his time? I told him I was comparing rates to other hotels and needed the rate to give to my husband. He told me again he was not going to give me a rate unless I wanted to book right then. I asked him why did he not want to rent me a room and he then HUNG UP ON ME! So I called back for the third time. This time I held 23 minutes and was again disconnected. I am so disappointed in the service I received. They seem to have a nice resort that offers many amenities but I do not know anyone who wants to stay somewhere on their vacation that has such rude employees and bad customer service so I will not be staying at this resort and will not recommend it to any of my friends until this problem is corrected.

<Title>“Bad Service”
<Content>My aunt decided to take my grandmother and I here for a little getaway. She had made online reservations and had all of the papers with her. We arrived at the hotel and there my aunt was greeted with unacceptable service. I am a Rosen College of Hospitality Major at UCF so no I am not being unreasonable. My aunt said that she was here to check in and Nicolle could not find the reservations in the computer. My aunt handed her the papers as proof and this girl had the nerve to say that because it wasn't in the computer we did not have reservations where if she were a good provider she should have just gotten her manager to address the issue leaving that attitude out. She went off in a fussy manner to find her manager who then took care of the situation after waiting for about 15 minutes(we checked in around 10pm and it was not busy). Then she said in a snide manner "Enjoy your stay" with a smirk. I went down to the desk the next day and spoke with a manager who said they would contact me when the have investigated the situation yet they never did. Another thing that dissapointed me was the wheelchair lift to the Ocean Walk Shoppes. It is locked off and you are supposed to call a number to get a security guard to operate it yet there are no phones nearby(I looked). Thankfully I had my cell phone with me but imagine someone who doesn't have one... The rooms were nice but we had a handicap access room and there was a door to another room and it would not lock so on our second night the actual guests of that room came into ours which had me anxious the rest of the trip. Their welcome breakfast was ridiculous. They clearly do not anticipate guests. They ran out of food before the even even started and my aunt and I had to stand next to the wall. Thankfully my grandmother had her wheelchair with her.

<Title>“This place gets a bad rap from bad travelers”
<Content>I also stayed over the Easter vacation for a week and did not have a bad experience.........the beach is about sand and fun, not hanging out by the pool! I have stayed at many resorts and saving chairs is something that is done at all of them. It is part of the game! Early bird gets the worm! We saved chairs! After many complaints to management, visitors towels were removed and thrown in a laundry dumpster on wheels and people were not allowed to remove their towels and were instructed to just take any towel off the top! Now that is wrong.....one of the guests told me they had towels taken which were personalized by a friend who had passed away and they were taken by someone else....(that was upsetting!) I assume the complaint was made by a late riser who did not get a chair.....you could have any chair you wanted after 2pm.........We preferred to avoid the congestion and atmosphere of the pool area and spent all week on the beach! (which is why you come) I witnessed a traveler removing towels and throwing them to the ground so they could sit down! After witnessing this we decided to get up and give our chairs to the folks who had been mistreated and went to the the sand to relax away from all the fuss! Our room was clean enough and we received maid service each day to make beds, drop off coffee/laundry soap and make beds. We even called for xtra sheets and blankets for the couches and received them within a half hour. I found nothing any different from this resort compared to any other busy (700 room) resort! We will be returning here for another stay! Perhaps try tipping the cleaning lady the first day and see what you get! When you are on vacation you should not be sweating the small stuff.....just relax and enjoy!

<Title>“What's Not To Like About This Resort?!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at this resort 3/26 - 4/1/05. We were on the 19th floor in the south tower in a one bedroom oceanfront condo. I had read the negative reviews and was very hesitant about staying there. But I'm glad we did. Check-in with Mike was a breeze -- it only took 5 minutes. There were enough bellhops so that someone helped us to our room. The room was spotless, airy, and clean: fully-stocked kitchen; plentiful towels; vacuum; ironing board and iron; and homey knick-knacks. The daily housekeeping was quick and efficient. By the time we checked out, there were about 8 extra sets of towels in our room! The pools (2 outdoor pool and 2 indoor) were clean and inviting. People did try to reserve beach chairs at 7:30 a.m. by leaving towels; but I had no problem claiming a vacant chair and relaxing in the sun. The exercise room was clean and had sufficient machines that I didn't have to wait to get a treadmill. The security staff was assuring to me -- the door from the free parking garage to the hotel was not locked; so entry was a breeze. The resort staff were courteous and helpful. My only negative experience occurred when I requested letterhead. The concierge advised none was available. I phoned the management office and was told it would be sent to my room. The housekeeper who came to my room did not know what letterhead was. I had to define it for her in spanish. It was only after a second phone call to the management office that I received the letterhead. There are plenty of daily free activities for adults and kids. The mini mall next door has shops and restaurants: Bubba Gump Shrimp is always fun. The daily housekeeping was quick and efficient. We used the concierge's desk to get discount tickets to the trolley boat tour. Overall, we had a good time and if we go back to Daytona Beach, I would stay here again.

<Title>“Glad the vacation was over”
<Content>We just returned from our vacation to Daytona Beach and stayed at the Fairfield Ocean Walk Resort. I was extremely disappointed! I searched for months on the internet looking for a nice resort and all the reviews I read was a complete waste of time. According to the reviews it was a nice resort with one or two that had problems....should've listened to them! First the room was filthy, everything needed cleaned and wiped down, and the carpet was stained throughout. The shower didn't work properly (called to have it fixed our first night there, it still didn't work right). They booked the entire resort and only had room enough for maybe 1/4 of the people around the pool. People were "saving" (even though a sign said no reserving of pool furniture) chairs by the pool, I went down to the pool every morning at 6:00 A.M. and not one chair was available any day that I was there, there wasn't anybody at the pool either, everybody had saved the chairs/loungers etc. by putting their towels on them (and shovels, buckets, etc.) apparently the night before. I have stayed in many hotels/resorts and I have never experienced anything like this before. All I can say is it was very disappointing!

<Title>“someone put charge on my room and the hotel made it worst.”
<Content>the room was good since it is facing the ocean. however, i originally requested a non-smoking room but they gave me a smoking room. so i went downstairs to change, then they send me up to another smoking room. so it took me 3 times to fix the problem. when i checked out, i realized there's a alcoholic drink charge to my room (while i am alergic to alcohol). and it was from the bar below. obviously it is not my responsibility but the hotel staff made me feel like the one who's trying not to pay the bill. the worst part is they show me a receipt, what they so called "evidence" of buying the beverage. it DID NOT EVEN HAVE MY SIGNATURE on the RECEIPT!!!! they kept on saying this is the proof of me who bought the drink. ok whatever, after several back and forward arguement, they gave me back the credits with the worst altitude like they are doing me a favor and writing off the charge to allowance of bad debt. however, the pool was really nice. too bad it was still cold.

We were in a two bedroom condo and absolutely loved our room. Side rooms allow visibility of the ocean, A1A and intracoastal waterway...12 floors up and you're set, any higher is a bonus.

<Title>“Loved it (and I’m really picky)!!”
<Content>My husband and I stayed at the Ocean Walk Resort during our stay in Florida for the Daytona 500. I had done tons of research trying to find a nice, fun hotel and after reading comments on tripadvisor.com, this hotel looked the nicest and turned out to be wonderful. It’s located next to the ocean, and I suggest getting a room with an ocean view if you can. The hotel room was fun (yellow living room walls and a teal bathroom) and the furniture was nice (not the cheesy junky stuff you see at Best Western’s, etc.). The kitchen was stocked with pots and pans, dishes, utensils, etc. The pools are really nice, and the lazy river looked relaxing (even though I didn’t go in it). The concierge was a lot of help suggesting restaurants (such as Inlet Harbor) and finding out info on Universal Studious and St. Augustine. We also saw a big movie star by the pool and heard of another one staying there, so I defiantly think it’s one of the nicest hotels in Daytona. The only complaint I’d have is housekeeping. The room was clean when we checked in and we got enough clean towels, but our dirty towels stayed in a heap on the bathroom floor for 3 days and our sheets never got changed (but, it didn’t bother me enough call the front desk to request room service). I totally recommend staying here. It’s nicely located and is just a nice hotel. I will defiantly be staying here again.

<Title>“Dont understand how anyone can give this place a bad review.”
<Content>The ocean walk resort is incredible. We rented from a broker for a heck of a discount. Stayed Mon Feb,21st in a 2 bedroom in the new tower and the next 4 nights in a 2 bedroom in the old tower. Total cost was about 90 dollars a night. The suites were 1300 square feet. The first one was very luxurious with a side balcony. The one in the old tower was equally as nice but the furniture wasn't as nice, but it had an oceanfront balcony. The furniture was still much nicer than in any regular hotel Ive ever stayed at. The units have full kitchens and washer/dryer too plus jacuzzis. 2 bathrooms. Awesome pools. Absolutely the best place in the area. With all the activities and things for the kids to do we saved a ton of money that we would normally spend taking the kids to the parks,etc.....We also did a little grocery shopping and saved a ton on eating out as well. There is no construction whatsoever going on at this resort. One building next to the new tower is being refinished but doesn't affect this place at all. The Hilton at Ocean Walk is on the other side of the Ocean walk Village and that is being remodeled. I huess it was just purchased by Hilton and maybe people giving reviews are confusing the 2 places, but from what I saw most of the Hilton looked great too. Fairfield definitely has more to offer for kids and families though. The only time we were approached about a timeshare was by someone on the beach trying to get us to tour the Royal Floridian. Fairfield guest services left a card on our door offering a tour but we were never asked by anyone. On the last day we were there it was cloudy and rainy and we wanted a peek at the penthouse so we called them and set up a 45 min tour which turned into an hour but there was no pressure to buy and we got a 60 dollar meal at Ponce Inlet for it. As far as the 1 bedroom B units, some of them do face the hall but they are still lovely and remember that its a one bedroom studio not a condo. Just one more thing....In the older tower #1 only about 20% of the rooms are actually owned by Fairfield and the others are individually owned and rented by others so any poor service complaints may be due to who they rented from. We loved it and would definitely return there. Thanks!

<Title>“Had a great time”
<Content>Stayed at this hotel on 2/11/05 to 2/13/05. Had originally looked on internet for booking a room and found it through Expedia. Thinking I could get a better deal directly w/ this hotel , I called. Asked for the same dates and there was no rooms available. The reservation desk at the hotel said I better book asap through Expedia. I did, and got a room for approximately $140 per night. It was on the 18th floor directly looking over the beach and ocean. When you first walk in the rooms, it gives one a feel of a small Bermuda design. Soft yellow walls w/ tile floors. As soon as you walk in the room,you are in a small but quaint foyer,with a small table with a light.As you go around the corner it opens into a big room, with a fully equipped kitchen. In front of the kitchen divided by a small 1/2 wall is the living room with tables, and 2 fold out couches, tv,phone, and a balcony of 8X4,accessible via a sliding patio door. There are two entrances into the bedroom, which is its own room with in itself. Has big closet, window over looking ocean/beach, a Jack and Jill bath with full size "jaccuzi" tub, and a seperate single sink bath with walk in shower,toliet,etc.. It was extremely clean and had a room safe and iron/board in closet. The outer hall by kitchen has its own stackable washer and dryer along w/ 2 small boxes of Tide detergent. Each bath had own towels,plus additional in closet. Small extra blankets and pillows also avail. Over all, great beach feel, and you feel very welcome. The lobby is next to elevators, and accessible with no problem. There is a "u " shaped bar, made of dark wood, and always staffed. Check in was ok, Arrived at noon, knowing ck in was at 4pm. Was told room would be ready at 2. Had lunch at the pool,cked on room at 3, still not ready, but hey... I was early. At 4 room not ready, but went to VIP area of ck in as bartender told them I was coming over. They said, the room had been ready since 1pm, it was a computer glitch. I was fine, as the extra time let me enjoy the pool area,sun and more drinks. Got a free drink at bar for mistake. The next day, came back from being out, and room key would not work. Went down, stood in ck in line for 20 minutes, so I thought, I'd try VIP line again, they stated the key to room was malfunctioning, and reset it immediatly. There was never a time that I was pressured into looking at a time share as others mentioned. I did find it "quirky" that a magician was trying to get you to come over to his table of tricks in the lobby, I am sure to hook one on the time share. Never ate here, but has a small cafe attached to bar. Went to the Hilton for breakfast buffet. Otherr than that, all pools,2 hot tubs and lazy river were working. There is a hugh work out room. Heard to have a spa very soon. Indoor pool seemed nice ,but didn't partake. Over all not the Ritz, but a nice experience. Good pizza at KAO!!!

<Title>“Disappointing -- not what we expected from a Fairfield resort”
<Content>Just returned from a week at this resort and we were mighty disappointed. Took 3 days to get a box of kleenex; had no toilet paper, diswashing soap, potholders, coffee & coffee filters, shampoo, and very little in the way of soap. Generally, just a poorly outfitted unit. All hot tubs were broken, tv remote's batteries kept falling out since there was no back on it, VERY noisy bathroom fans, poor bathroom lighting, noisy ceiling fans in bedrooms, dirty refrigerator, construction noise every morning at 6:15, horrible, horrible decorations and colors -- just not at all what we expected from a Fairfield and we would have to think hard about returning. Also, we received phone calls every single day about attending a sales presentation -- annoying, to say the least.

<Title>“This resort has issues.”
<Content>I expected a better room for the price. The walls needed cleaning, coffee pot was cracked, T.V. remote was taped together with black tape, the Lazy river was broken, one of the hot tubs was broken, check in was a nightmare, no news paper in the morning, only 1 day set up for coffee, no shampoo in the bathroom, housekeeping did not leave extra T.P. as needed. I was there for 3 days for my 25 wedding anniversary and I will never go back again, I expected more from this resort, and left wishing we had never checked in. The rooms were clean and most of the staff were nice, however many thought they were better than anyone around them, I overheard much backstabbing of other staff.

<Title>“THIS IS THE NICEST RESORT IN TOWN AND WHAT A GREAT VALUE!!!!!!!!”
<Content>We just got got home from our first vacation to Daytona Beach and this resort was amazing! We got in on Sunday morning at 5 am. We needed to find a place to stay till monday night but within a price range. When we pulled to check the pricing i thought this was way out of the price range. We ran inside to check the prices and we were shocked only 109.00 a night! We told them 2 nights to stay and when we checked out Monday (today) they only charged us for one night! (because we got there at 5 in the morning) all the other hotels we stopped at were going to charge us for those few hours. We reserved the room and were completely satisified with the rooms. They were nice condominiums. The 2 ouside pools and hot tubs are very nice. The pools are open 24 hours! (except the water slide) This resort literally butts onto the ocean. There are many attractions and great bars nearby. We have no complaints about this place. They took great care of us and we will be returning customers in the years to come!

<Title>“Awsome view, beautiful resort, the best in Daytona Beach”
<Content>I was lucky to rent from a condo owner, therefore I did not pay the full amount of the resort price and I have the newest, cleanest and ocean front condo. There are so much thing we did around the resort, lots of restuarants right next door, live music at night on the beach... I can not express the feeling! The best place for a week vacation plus Daytona is so close to Orlando. We even drove to Orlando for dinner and came back relaxing by the beach. Please check out some vacation condo rentals websites.

<Content>Spent the Thanksgiving Holidays at Ocean View. Arrived Saturday, November 20 and departed November 27. Stayed in an one bedroom "A" suite in the new tower. Well equipped and immaculate! On the 17th floor. Fell asleep with the ocean sounds every night. Due to the weather, no need for air conditioning. Staff very pleasant and responsive. Lots of activities for every age group. Good location and best resort on the beach! Plan to revisit this resort.

<Title>“Big Changes at Ocean Walk”
<Content>What a difference a year makes. I travel for business often (airlines) and am also a RCI and Fairfield owner. I have become very a custom to being treated special at Ocean Walk and knowing the staff will immediately respond to any concerns, however on my last trip my room was filthy and the service was unpleasant! Check in was slow and uninviting took 1 hour after check-in time to get keys to room (two out of three keys worked)! Parking was difficult when I checked-in. When I brought this to managements attention (people not parked in spots total anarchy), and a young blond male manager who was on duty asked how would I feel if I was towed??? I parked across the street in public parking for six dollars a day and asked for a voucher I was told they didn't do that! I used to deal with Tara, or Tom however who were both quick to act on any concerns, and realized shortly after check-in both had transferred this was a problem!! I called several times for maid service and after actually speaking with someone at the front desk I was advised housekeeping had left for the evening! So I slept in a room with urine on the bathroom floor and debris on the carpet (there was no place to move me to). I was a paying hotel guest at the time and checked out the next day. Shortly I discovered I had been charged the entire stay on my credit card. I immediately called the resort and the sympathetic agent transferred me to the resort accountant. I left a message and waited three business days as a courtesy before calling back again. On my third call I received a short and rude message stating I had to call the resorts 1-800 # to receive credit back on my card and this process would take up to ten days. Further calls to the account went unanswered! When I finally got in touch with someone on the 1-800 who was a supervisor I received the third degree and was told they had no record of me checking out early. I called the resort accountant again no response, then the assistant resort manager Jon I think no response, and finally spoke with Maran (some manager who knew Tom). She was a god sent thank you! Finally three days latter I received my funds. I have stayed at Ocean Walk several times in both a timeshare and hotel capacity, and never had these kind of problems. I would never stay there again or recommend it (it used to be spotless and well managed). Im glad my points aren't there and I understand there is a Hilton opening next door I'll try that on my next FL east coast visit.

<Content>Stayed at the Ocean Walk Resort the week of 11 October 2004. Very nice resort, probably the best upscale resort in the area. A lot of beach erosion was present due the recent storms. The older hotels took most of the damage. I would recommend this resort as a number 1 upscale place to stay.

<Title>“Great getaway”
<Content>Stayed for 1 week, Oct.10-17 Wonder place to stay while in Daytona, this is a top of the line hotel for Daytona Beach. We had a 2 bedroom with a side view of the ocean, got a little loud with all the noice from the buildings next door, didn't get much of the ocean sounds, but the room was excellent!! The pools were not crowed at all but we were there in the off season, I could see if it were sold out it could get to be a real problem fitting everyone in the 2 outside pools. The buildings were a problem getting the afternoon sun, by 1:30 the sun is gone and both pools are in the shade. Stay away from the sales pitches they will give you, the room survey is not a survey it is a sales pitch, if you take it you'll proably get a dinner certficate so it might be worth your while. Answer excellent to all the questions or you will be there alot longer than the 45 minutes they promised. I would go back but not if the hotel is sold out, unless you are en earlier riser or want to beach, then you shouldn't have a problem. My 1 complaint would be the activites staff, alilttle lacking of interesting activites. One more thing, there were teenage kids everywhere and the staff is blind to what they are doing.

<Content>We recently stayed at the Ocean Walk Resort from October 7 to October 12. Like one of the last reviews said, most of the places on the ocean were hit by the hurricanes. The Ocean Walk did not appear to get hit at all. We really enjoyed our stay. After reading many of the reviews posted, we were eager to see if the resort was all that everyone said it was. Our check in was pleasant except we were unable to check in until 4. We arrived at the hotel at 1, so we had some time to kill. We spent it out by the ocean and by the pools. If I could make a recommendation, I would like to see the Resort let guests check in if the room is ready. They said ours was not, but I'm not sure that was all true. Upon check in, we were given our ocean front room, as booked. We had an A room on the 14th floor. It was, for the most part, well kept. The only suggestions I would have is the carpet in the livingroom needed to be cleaned or a new one put in. The kitchen was well equipt and well kept. Having the mini washer and dryer in our room was a big plus. They gave us some detergent upon arrival but we went to the store to buy more. We needed an extra blanket which we had to call twice for, but it was delivered in about an hours time. We found the staff to be very polite and friendly as well as eager to make sure our stay was good. I must say that I was disappointed in the cleanliness of the shower. The shower floor looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a long time. Also, the maids only do light housekeeping.....make beds, empty trash and provide fresh towels. They don't clean your sink or bathroom at all unless you request it. I called the front desk and requested they clean the bathroom better. They did. Also, the housekeepers do not speak much english, so we were unable to communicate well with them. There was food in the hotel which made it nice. They had an inhouse breakfast and dinner once during the week for a nominal fee, which was nice so we didn't have to go out to get food. They did have a nice pool side cookout with tropical music on the nice days. We were also able to rent chairs and an umbrella on the beach for $25.00 for the day. It was worth it. The outside of the resort was well kept, clean and very nice to sit out and enjoy. The inside of the hotel all in all was well done. We would recommend this hotel to those who want to get away and spend some time at a nice resort as a family or as a couple. There are scheduled activities to do for the kids as well as a game room and computers. We had a one bedroom condo with a pull out sofa bed in the living room which was great for our 13 year old. Our bathroom even had a jacuzzi in it which we didn't use. The Daytona beach area is very run down, so if you are looking to do a lot of shopping or pretty sight seeing along the beach, this would probably not be the place to go, but if you are looking to stay at the hotel most of the time and enjoy the ocean and pool area I would recommend this hotel. I am a very picky reviewer, so I would guess that many people would have a great time at this Hotel. I've read that some people had difficulty with long check in and elevator wait, but we came off season and didn't have any trouble. I'll bet that on season or during a big event, the check in, elevator and parking would be a huge problem. Probably 15 minutes away is International Speedway Drive where you can shop and eat and visit the speedway. This area is well kept. Please beware, that many of the surrounding hotels are very run down. The Ocean Walk is a new resort and was worth far more than the fee of $113.00 per night we were charges. I suspect because it was off season. Don't let the photos of other resorts on the internet fool you. Read the reviews.

<Title>“Unfortunate experience”
<Content>We had all our pool items stolen within an hour of our arrival (beach towels, swimsuit coverups, etc). Although security staff took down information, no one else on staff seemed too concerned. Also, very high pressure sales presentation. We would not go back even though our room was wonderful.

<Title>“Resort as excellent rate!!!!”
<Content>The Fairfield Resort at Ocean Walk are such helpful with any informations for tours, activities at resort, and all others. We adored the hotel, especially with our suite which made me felt like I was in "Trading Spaces" eposide and I had much of enjoyment and a lot of fun staying at the resort. I will suggest this resort to anyone I know who would consider going to Daytona Beach as their next vacation trip! Many thanks to the Fairfield Ocean Walk staff, especially Charlene!!!!

<Title>“The best on the beach”
<Content>This was the best resort on the beach. With daily activites for everyone, the pools, lazy river, and the washer and dryers in the room, it far surpassed my expectations. We stayed here 6 nights from August15-21. The first 3 were in an oceanfront room and the last 3 were in b units(unexpected last 3 nights due to change of plans caused by Charley) The b units were ok, little odd that the windows is in and interior hallway, but the oceanfront room was just great. I will be going back to this resort in the future. I cannot say enough good things about this resort. The pools were never too busy but was hard to find a chair if you like to lay out in the sun and were not there first thing in the morning, but we only needed 1 chair to put our stuff on while we were in the pool, and we were always able to find one. They have tons of activities and service was good. I recommend this for anyone visiting this area.

<Title>“Loved the Ocean Walk”
<Content>Stayed at the Ocean Walk August 2004 for 4 days. Purchased a 2 bedroom unit from a timeshare owner. The room was beautiful. It was on the 14th floor. It was not Ocean Front so we had a view of the Hotel next door and a city view. That was OK because I did not plan on staying in the hotel room. The short walk to the beach was great. The pools were great. The activities for the kids were great. The parking was a hassle (I agree). Our room reservation was not received, so the clerk had to call the timeshare company. (good thing we arrived early). Other than that we loved the resort. Definately would go back to the Ocean Walk.

<Title>“Great Times at Ocean Walk”
<Content>We just returned from The Ocean Walk Resort in Daytona Beach, FL and we had the best time. I was very careful to read all of the reviews posted on this site, the good, the bad and the ugly and I took it all to heart. First we booked our reservation directly with the resort. That is the only way to get a straight answer on what kind of room you will be in. I was given a room number and a floor at booking and was told it could change, but it did not. We had two double beds on the 4th floor over looking the pool and the beach. That floor also goes directly out to The Ocean Walk Shops and has a back entrance to the pool. The only draw back was the constant stream of prospective condo owners that were courted every day by the staff. You will most likely receive a call to come to one of the meetings with the promise of food and drink gift certificates, but we respectfully declined and were never bothered again. We arrived at 6:00 PM on a Saturday night and had NO wait at check in. I found the check-in staff to be very helpful. We even extended our stay by one night and had no problems. If I could make a suggestion, I would say that you need to bring push pins or make some sort of make shift curtain to cover the window in your bedroom that faces the hallway. Thanks to the previous postings, I was able to cover ours with sheets, which helped block out the light. Also, it is true that you have to get up around 7:00 AM to put towels out on the chairs to get a spot at the pool. Management says "No reserving chairs", but everyone does it, so if you don't play the game, you will find yourself without a chair. We did see a fight between two families regarding "moving their stuff", but the hotel quickly accommodated the family that had saved the chairs earlier. Just know that you do take the chance of having your belongings moved aside, but this was the only case we saw in 7 days. Also bring extra laundry detergent if you plan on washing your own beach towels (I would bring my own beach towels), they do provide you with small amounts of detergent along with paper towels, trash bags, etc. , but we did the wash before returning home and ate breakfast in frequently, so we found it helpful to bring extra items. Light maid service is provided each day (taking out the trash, making beds and exchanging towels for clean ones). Our vacation was fabulous. The pool, water slide and lazy river were great, and we were within 45 minutes to 1 hour of Orlando, so we were able to go to Sea World for the day without a long drive after. Basically there is an element of uncertanty whenever you travel. You have to roll with the punches and make the best of any situation, and we were pleasantly suprised when we didn't have any horror stories to report. We are looking forward to another stay in the near future. We will definitely return.

<Title>“The good, the bad”
<Content>Good...very nice room. Spacious, well equiped, nicely decorated, and clean. The staff I dealt with were all very competent and professional. Bad...long check-in, over an hour. No beach chairs, you have to rent for $25 a day. Very hard to get a chair at the outdoor pool area.

<Title>“WOW - We loved this place!”
<Content>We just returned from a 4 night stay and couldn't have been happier. We purchased our stay from an owner on eBay. It was in the new north tower and it was wonderful. We were on the 9th floor and our unit looked directly into the condos across the alley, however we could see the ocean to the right and still hear the waves at night. This particular unit did not have the A & B lockoff mentioned in other reviews, it was a 2 bedroom & 2 bath with 1 kitchen and 1 living room. The beach was beautiful, uncrowded, and just a few steps beyond the pooldeck. The pools (2 outside and 2 inside) and lazy river are perfect and relaxing. Check in was quick, sales pitches were in the form of a letter on the door daily (not a big deal), and check-out was smooth as well. They have a computer lounge with 3 terminals, fitness classes, and lots of activities that are free of charge. The gift shop is not overpriced, as I figured it would be and the arcade was well equiped as well. I have just a couple of somewhat negative remarks - there was sometimes a small wait for the elevators (the longest, probably 10 mins., when a storm blew in and the beach and pool deck were quickly closed causing everyone to need an elevator at the same time...the pool deck fills early so get there early if you want a chair...the parking garage can fill quickly in the evening (we never had a problem finding a spot, but there were several cars parked in non-spaces by the morning.) Finally, the resort is missing huge profit potential by not having an onsite convenience or grocery store (a large grocery is nearby.) If there would have been one there we would have used it even if it was a little more expensive. The decor and facilities are beautiful and we had a great time. We are even looking into ownership, which we have NEVER considered before. It was great having enough room for the family to stretch out without fighting for space, TV time, or privacy. We really enjoyed our time there and look forward to returning soon.

<Title>“Good luck!”
<Content>You don't always get what you pay for! I called to confirm reservations 3 different times and was assured I was getting this great brand new 1 bedroom condo. NOT!! Management couldn't care less. Sorry but all our rooms are full!! What a mess and we weren't the only ones dissapointed. The condo was very dirty and had big stains on the carpet. Brown gunk all over the kitchen wall, chairs, and mold in the bath. I was so dissapointed. As far as the pool deck goes that was great. Wonderful pools and great beach. Bad customer service. I begged for towels and never did get them so I had to wash the ones we had and I couldn't find anyone in housekeeping that speaks English. I do not have any desire to stay here again especially at these prices. Check-in don't be in any hurry and have plenty of other activities to do while you wait for your room. Some other people I spoke with had a great room. I guess it's the luck of the draw. Good Luck!

<Title>“Great location”
<Content>For Daytona Beach this is one of the best. We had a great 1 bedroom ocean front room. The full fridge made breakfast and lunch very convient. My biggest complaint is that chairs by the pool were very hard to get. I don't know what time people got up to save the chairs but we would go down at 7:00am and there would not be a chair to be found. This should be stopped. Also the pool is in the shade by 3pm but I went there for the beach anyway. I would recommend this hotel for a Daytona stay. But would say that there are alot better places to go than Daytona Beach.

<Title>“Nice place, Zero Customer Service”
<Content>Called ahead of time to check on rates, was quoted a price, they said come on in there are plenty of rooms at that rate. Upon arriving there were no such rates and the rates rose by $100 per night. Needless to say I was a little upset, asked for the manager, manager informed me there was nothing he could do. He offered no comprimise, no apoligies, nothing. I would have still stayed there had he at least apoligised that the info I rec'd came from the marketing company, not the hotel directly. I've stayed there before and the experience was nice. However since I received nothing resembling service, I left and stayed at a wonderful hotel Next door. I will not return to Ocean Walk. Seems silly that they would leave a room empty when they had a paying customer offering.
